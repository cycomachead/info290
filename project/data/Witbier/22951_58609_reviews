"Appearance: Pours brilliant gold, 1” off white foam cap, collapses into a film. Smell: initially a little bacon with a hint of smoke and some fruit. Taste: Fruity, malty sweetness with some orange, tropical fruit, banana and wheat. Mouthfeel: Very creamy, soft above average carbonation."

"Poured a hazy, light gold color with a little head that leaves a faint lace. Smells like, clementine go figure, smooth citrus taste and feel."

"Overall - A well executed witbier. This would be perfect on a hot summer Calgary day but I will enjoy this on a mild evening here in Cowtown."

"Clementine was ok - would've preferred more of a citrus flavor. Morris tap and grill 12/27/14"
""
"Aroma is wheat, citrus and strong coriander.  The flavor is yeast, spices/coriander, wheat, slight heat and a sourish/tart finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I just don't dig fruity beers.  If the clementine was an accent flavor to a really nice pale ale, that I could like.  But this beer is one note, just as advertised.  For those who enjoy beer like this, it may be great, but just not for me."

"poured very nicely, light head, a bit thin feeling for a wheat beer. My experience is nearly identical to tectactoe's. It had thin, sharp taste for a wheat as well, with a crisp slightly citrus flavor. Every time I took a sip, I was trying decide if I liked it, but it did fall into the ""okay"" category for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours beautiful golden color with ample amount of fizzy, lingering head and lacing. Aroma is fresh citrus/orange. Taste is refreshing with citrus and hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is carbonation and cool citrus. Overall, not bad !"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Very good Witbier with lots of spices and citrus flavors. Flavorful and with interesting choice of citrus hops (Summit) that matched perfectly. Recommended for style and better than references such as Hoegaarden."

"Meh."

"Medium bodied, slightly over carbonated brew.  Finishes with dry coriander and citrus.  This is a pretty drinkable beer that has a lot of yeast character that stands up to the citrus.  Worth trying, and a must for wheat beer fans.  I wonder what the Vitamin C content is in this brew."
""
"Single bottle from a 4-pack poured into a tulip glass. A cloudy lemon yellow topped with a half-finger of large white bubbles, with some stratified lacing on one side of the glass. Smells wonderful, with some dry Belgian ""burlap sack"" funk out front, followed by bubble gum, lemon rind, fresh orange juice, coriander seed, and buttered bread. Palate is almost like a saison but with added orange, lemon, and tangerine in the middle and end phases of a sip ... Dry and somewhat tannic but very fruity. Flashes of watermelon (!) and golden raisins in there amongst the citrus and phenolic/estery yeast. Some banana going on. Light to moderate body with carbonation quite tame. Finish is dry, with some green resinous hops apparent, although the bright citrus flavor carries on through to the end. Nicely phenolic, with some clove becoming more assertive over time. Enjoyable even if the citrus is rather too dominant in the overall flavor profile."

"I'm kind of getting a typical brash Americian hegemony thing emanating from this one - do they get all the metrics correct?  Sure.  Is it drinkable?  (You bet yer ass).  Is it anywhere near as subtle and complex as the world-beaters for the style?  Fuck no (I don't know how to express that with a Boston accent)."

"A beer that I really enjoyed & one that proved far too easy to drink. It's relatively simple would usually be a bad thing but it works very well in this case with the citrus fruits & orange complimenting the coriander and wheat flavours. This one tastes as a witbier should and is definitely one worth picking up."

"Overall not bad, again not a huge fan of wheat based beers, hefes, wits, etc, but this is pretty decent, nice spices that get perhaps a bit too much on the flavor but still nice, great orange and zest, nit bitterness on the finish with dry finish, decent creamy wheat, nice on a hot summer day."
""
"Overall, A pretty solid beer. generally not a big fan of this style but this wasn't bad....if i went out and someone had this on tap i may get it...this is a nice summer beer."

"Overall: quite a tasty witbier - very clean and refreshing. I don't think it has quite enough over the standard witbier to justify the price, but hey - still a damn good beer."
""
""
""
""
"Pours very cloudy, there is a lot of sediment here, although it suspends nicely with a good aggressive swirl. Taste is lightly sweet, faint fruit taste as you'd expect. Nice and refreshing, no edge to it at all. Really enjoyable if you're looking for a light summery beer."
""
""
""
"Of course, the alcohol wasn't that heavy here, which lead to this going down faster than it should have. While beers of this style tend to be light and easygoing, this could have been a bit more heavy and bold. Citrus lovers might want to substitute this for a glass of orange juice but now that the spring is here, there are much better examples of this to be found on your local retailer's shelf. Only worth a try for fans of Clown shoes."

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Hazy with continually rising effervescence, a bubbly head, but no real lacing. Bread with citrus and spice. Light and crisp yeast, citrus pith, and coriander brought to a head with a steely finish. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad tasting beer. This brew is heavy on the citrus, but light on spices and orange flavor. Its tangy taste is reminiscent of orange zest rather than slices. The beer is more like a good lager with orange zest and spices added later."

"355ml bottle. Shaker glass. Gold color & crystal clear appearance. White froth, close & lasting crown. Herbs & intense coriander, light maltiness to the nose. Sweet caramel malt, lemon & spiced flavors. Light body. Moderate to high carbonation. Low bitterness & slight sweet finish. Flat. Unexpected disappointing from Clown Shoes."

"This is a very solid witbier. I really like the citrus notes. I wish it was slightly refined, but there's something I really like about this beer. It was enjoyable right now in the winter, so I can just imagine enjoying this in the spring/summer."

"A very decent white ale, would go quite well with dinner (fish?)"
"Pale hazed peach body with a fluffy white head, forms thick and brings out the fine speckled lacing of the white head. Aroma is like a soft wheat grain tone with clementine citrus fruit additions with candied bitterness with hops wrapped around the citrus peel and spice additions. Flavors are bright with the citrus peel, coriander additions and clean alcohol finish I'm not sure what the abv is or the IBUs but they claim to throw in Summit hops usually a green vegetable note. My belief with their house yeast is to keep the sediment in the bottle. What's left is a light drinkable beer that Clown Shoes will sell by the tone, however I will set it straight this is not a hoppy American Wheat ale, but it's solid highly carbonated wheat that I enjoyed due to the clementine orange peel and spice additions. Overall go and drink some and form an opinion for yourself."

"Clown Shoes' version of a witbier is a success. Just the beer you need to ""smack that mean day upside the head""."
""
"Expected more haze in the pour. Was rather brilliant and dark-yellow to light-gold.. The yeast was no longer in suspension and had settled for the most part. Lively carbonation upon pouring but a very short-lived head. Nose is typical Witbier with hints of coriander, citrus (clementines and sweet orange peel labeled) and clove. Medium-light body and pleasant carbonation. Belgian lace does not form. Crisp, forward bitterness and spiciness, which includes peppercorn. A little sweeter than expected. Very pleasant. It tastes like a session beer, but the ABV (6%, although not noticeable) may be a too high for this."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 6/21/2013. Pours very hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of big lemon zest, tangerine, orange peel, grapefruit, coriander, clove, pepper, wheat, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, yeast, and spice notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon zest, grapefruit, tangerine, orange peel, coriander, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, coriander, clove, wheat, bread, floral. and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of malt, yeast, and spice flavors; with great flavor robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent witbier. All around great balance, complexity, and robustness of malt, spice, and yeast flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall I wasn't that into this beer and I thought it was a very average example of the style, all of the aspects of this beer seemed pretty average and there wasn't anything about it that separates it from all the other average Witbiers. This beer had decent drinkability, it was smooth and not filling, but the flavor didn't really hold my attention and I think it would really start to wear on me after drinking more than one so I think one would be my maximum. What I liked the most about this beer was the orange aspect, it wasn't bad and it didn't seem to be artificial. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, I think it needs some work. I wouldn't buy this beer again, since it really doesn't stick out for the style and it's a little overpriced for what you get. I would only recommend this beer to someone who really likes this style. All in all I wasn't impressed with this beer, there wasn't anything about it that made it a memorable Witbier. Better luck next time guys, Hoppy Feet is still my least favorite Clown Shoes beer but this one wasn't too much better, I'm still not sure about this brewery and I think it might be hard for them to compete against the local Michigan brewerys."

"Good witbier with the clementine being a slightly different take on the stereotypical organize you get with a lot of other similar beers. Has this poured out of the big boy bottle into the weizen glass. The color is a hazy darker yellow. Lighter mouthfeel as one would expect for the style. Liked it."
"Has a two-finger, fluffy white head. Pale gold and fizzy. Smells of melon, green apple, lemon, grass and sugar. Tastes sweet and spicy with faint notes of coriander, malt, peppercorn, apple juice, lemon and a slight hop bitterness. Complex and welcoming can and do coexist here. Light bodied, mostly dry but soft in the middle, and smooth sailin' all the way."

"A resounding ""meh"" could be heard each time I took a sip of this beer. It's one of those ""not bad, but not exactly good"" type of things. It's just... well, it's nothing special. It has all been done before, and Clementine doesn't do anything to stand out and make me want to drink it again. Huge fans of the style might enjoy it, but I won't be taking it out for a second date."
"This beer pours a cloudy light orange color. Tge head iw one inch of frothy white foam that recedes slowly into a quatern inch that sits until the beer is gone. The aroma is coriander and cardamom forward (which I like), and has a nice fruity wheaty thing going on in the background which has some nice peach and tangerine qualities. The taste is a bit more balanced between the fruit and the spice. It is very full flavored for a witbier. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a chewy texture, and lively carbonation. Overall, this is a fine example of the style, and I will drink it again."

"Overall, an OK wit, a little heavy on the spice."
""
""

"Fairly good beer but not really worth it at Clown Shoes prices. Thought it was straight forward and well made."
"F: Short bite from the wheat and fruity orange flavors that end up with a clean finish"

"Overall- Great summer beer. Refreshing citrus flavor. I'm glad I tried it a second time."
""
"Good solid version and nice for this heat we are in."

"Overall: a good first impression from clown shoes. definitely a well crafted beer but just not the right interpretation for me."
"I am sure that this is an older bottle. No matter though, it still works. The beer is fairly clear with a golden orange color. Nose is definitely wit but not very strong. Flavor is heavy on the orange with spice accents. Easy to drink and I feel like it is more of a Belgian ale instead of a wit, but it works."

"Overall: I've always been a fan of this brew (and brewer). Clementine doesn't necessarily do anything differently than most witbiers, they just do it all right. Among the best, if not the best, domestic witbiers I've had. Very afforadable and just an extremely well rounded beer"

"Pours a hazy deep straw color with a smallish bubbly white head that persists for a while. Smells of clove and allspice with a sweet light sugary malt base and a light lemony tart spicy wheat twang. The flavor is sweet honey and sugar with a bunch of clove and lemony orange with a tart wheaty edge. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a bubbly sweet mouthfeel. Not my favorite style and not my cup of tea. Stylistically I've had better examples of the style, this one has clashing flavors imho."

"Pours a murky orange with a foamy tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, spices, yeast, and some citrusy aromas. Taste is much the same with a citrus zest flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is light and refreshing."

"Now this is what I’m talking about. Strong fruity flavors, but still finishes with hops. Not too intense, but light enough that it’s a great summer beer and extremely drinkable. A great example of how to brew a Witbier and finally I've found an American brewery that can do it well with some identity compared to the German breweries."

"The taste falls a little flat, very estery, pretty sweet, oddly dry finish, not a lot of citrus in the beer overall. It is an OK beer but the overpowering yeastiness makes the beer, at times, feel solventy. I don't think I'd have it again."
""
""
""
"tasty wheat brew with a ton of citrus funk. the pour is cloudy and bright sunshine color, glowing loudly, with a tall white head with excellent retention. the nose is real orangey, i cant specify clementines exactly, but maybe tangerines or some kind of orange. zesty more than juice in the smell, with some sour sainson-esque yeast. the flavor is equally interesting, with the orange throughout, bitter and acidic at the end. the yeast is more spicy than i think it needs to be, as the fruit would be more enjoyable as a standalone dominant note in this one, but i appreciate the use of something non generic. somewhere between a saison and a hefeweizen i think here, its a cool take on this style. the wheat malt provides some body, but its flavor is outshined by the fruit. solid feel, a little too sturdy from the sediment to be as refreshing as it might otherwise be, but the carbonation is awesome and the finish is really cool, with the acidic sting of the orange peel and the sweetness of the fruit itself, combined with a funky yeast. overall a very pleasing beer at a fair price. this is one i will look forward to trying again if warm weather ever comes back..."
"I really enjoyed this beer. I will definitely pick up more the next time I see it on the shelf."
""
"O: I thought it was a good wit beer and was glad to take a stab at it."
""
"Medium bodied and very heavily carbonated with a strong peppery spice presence that lingers over the citrus and yeast notes into a dry finish. There's a very strong coriander flavor that dominates, slightly overpowering the citrus peel and bread notes. Peppery with subtle orange and tangerine notes. Tart, dry finish. Not bad, but the overpowering coriander makes this beer a bit one-note. Needs some more citrus sweetness to balance things out."
""
""
""
""
"I bought a large 22oz. Bottle of this and poured into a large pint glass. Very citrusy smell, hence the name clementine. This had more of an organgy citrus taste as opposed to some other Belgians which taste more lemony. This pours to a hazy yellow color, seems to be unfiltered and about 1/3 of white head and 2/3 liquid. Good carbonation. Overall a very awesome tasting witbier. One of the best domestics. Not sure about the other clown shoes beers but this one is excellent."
""
""
"O – Overall I would call this beer drinkable, and pretty good. If I had a wild hair I would scoop this beer up again, but it definitely isn’t something that I would seek out. Tastes nice though. Refershing. Would be lovely on a summer day."

"Pours hazy straw colored with a tall, white head that dissipates at a moderate pace. There are visible large and tiny bubbles in this beer. The beer mostly smells of orange, which works as advertised. I also detected the wheat and some mild spiciness in the aroma. The orange flavor is not as strong in the flavor as it was in the nose, but it does blend very nicely with the wheat malt. There's some mild spiciness in the taste as well, which was detectable in the nose. There are some clove, black pepper, and nutmeg flavors. The body is light with moderate carbonation. The finish is not entirely clean due to a spicy aftertaste. The drinkability is good. This is a good beer."
""
"Overall, what we liked best about this one was the nose. The fruit was there, and so was the spice, but we lost both in the flavoring. The mouth was overly boozy, despite a standard abv, and the orange was sadly absent. This booze even crowed out the typical warming spice of wits, making for an overly bitter, one-dimensional offering."

"This cam off a LOT more like a German Hefeweizen than a Belgian Wit. Either way, it's a tasty wheat beer."
"This beer pours a really hazy clouded blur with a raging carbonated fizzle that hisses at you as you pour. The color reminds me of a white grapefruit juice with the pulp still in, but the head dissipates almost instantly while the carbonation continues to pock-mark the surface with a torrent of bubbles. The smell is thick with that Clementine and orange-like smell alongside the proper wheat-funk and a slight banana-like smell seems to be there as well alongside some faint spices. The beer tastes banana-like with nice undertones of citrus Clementine and orange, kind of like a banana-citrus smoothie with some wheat cloying and cream at the back of the tongue. The after taste is light with citrus while the mouthfeel is really rough with carbonation and fiercely dry on the top of the tongue with faint bubbling still tingling the tops of the mouth. I was hoping for a little more of a citrus burst from this beer, but overall it just seems like a strong citrus backbone on a white Belgian ale. Overall it’s not a terrible beer, just not quite what I was hoping for, and not wholly memorable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: definite beer for a warm summer day when you want a pure thirst quencher."
"Has a nice light taste, despite an above average alcohol content. The clementine taste shows up with the finish, and isnt over powering. Shortcoming is drinkability. Having more than one or two in one sitting would be rare. But this beer would make a nice compliment to a tuna burger, or a spring salad."
""
""
""

"Had a bottle at Liberty St. Tavern. Not my favorite wit, but the subtle, earthy (not juicy or artificial) clementine flavor is pretty cool. The wit is too clean for the style, there's not enough Belgian spice, coriander, vanilla, or the like. It's more just a smooth, slightly sweet candied wheat beer. Not a bad wit, and certainly interesting. Worth a try for something different."
"This taste much like a Tripel with a lower alcohol content. It's as if they took their Tramp Stamp and laid off of the hops. This has none of the traditional Witbier notes. There's no wheat notes, lemon or orange, and there no coriander. A little disappointing for the style but not bad overall. If this were a Belgian Pale Ale it would be a pretty solid beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall it lacked the added punch I expected as it's essentially just a standard wit with a little more spiciness and a very nice aftertaste but somewhat bland outside of that. A pour mouthfeel tipped me over the edge and dropped it lower as by the end of the beer I went from thinking it was kind of good to very average."
"O: I believe this is good for the style, but for me, eh, maybe only again on tap. Maybe I tried this too late, note to self, try this again fresher next time."
""
"After having just had a Elder Betty from Magic Hat, it was interesting to taste another big fruit beer. This one wins for the remarkably nice sudsy and creamy mouthfeel. On the sweet and spicy side if you're in the mood. From the 12 oz bottle."
""
"Poured into a chalice a hazed tangerine color with a nicely formed 1/2 finger white head atop.Alot of yeasty phenols in the nose mixed coriander spiceed notes,Iam not sure if I have come across a wit with that much of a yeasty phenolic presence.flavors have a nice clementine orange presence upfront then the yeasty phenolic spiced flavors really pretty much take over,a light smattering of coriander in the finish.It's not bad but it;s a little yeast heavy handed in my opinion."
"O: very good witbier. Straightforward but solid. Would certainly try it again. Also paired well with a spicy dish."
""
""
"My first Clown Shoes brew. A refreshing summer witbier with saison yeast character, low ABV, and exceptional drinkability. I’ll take this with me during a hot weather outing anyday. 4.0"
""
""
"overall: Not bad. It's almost summer here in Ga (which means scorching already) and my favorite time for lighter beers (i mean lighter than imperial stouts). Abita Strawberry, Sam Smith Organics. This is ok, but I'll reach for the aforementioned first."

"Pours a golden orange color, plume of bubbly white head, decent retention. Smell is of ripe juicy oranges, light tang of wheat and bready yeast round out the nose with a faint bit of black pepper. While scent screamed citrus juice, taste was more akin to biting into a not fully ripened orange and getting a bit of the white rind as well, backed by bready and lightly spicy yeast, bitter to an extent. Medium bodied, bubbly and some lingering sweetness. Overall, there was a lot of fruit, but I've had juicer beers that used only hops."

"Poured from a bomber into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a nice orange straw color with a nice white head that dissipates to a small white head that leaves nice lacing on the glass. Smells of wheat and citrus, with the wheat dominating. Has a very sweet taste, mainly citrus, but the wheat is dominating and compliments the citrusy taste, which is probably from the hops. Carbonation is right for this light bodied beer that goes down very smooth. Overall, a good beer."

"Clown Shoes Clementine White Ale is a clear, pale golden ale with a fuzzy, white head that leaves nice lacing. It has a perfume aroma of orange and wheat. It's bordering on dish soap. Deeper in the aroma is some nice juiciness. It's light and clean and very crisp. It's tart and citrusy all the way through. There's a little orange peel bitterness at the finish. It lingers faintly after the finish. This would be an outstanding warm weather brew. It actually quenches my thirst. It's ridiculously easy to drink."
""
"@ The Gaff, Waltham. Pours to a hazy orange and thin head with little retention and lace. Aroma is orangey, spicy. Flavor is interesting. Some unusual sour lambic type flavors surrounded by orange peel, bottled lemon juice and coriander.mouthfeel is on the astringent side due to special ingredients. Overall it was off and weird but interesting and not bad."

"Lighter medium body, slightly higher carbonation, bubbly and refreshing on the tongue. This was good, but I felt like I was still searching for something more after finishing my glass."
"Light bodied with excellent carbonation, this is a very easy-drinking beer. As expected, the body is light and playful, having an almost seltzer water feel. The carbonation is nice and fizzy, which assists in the drinkability tremendously. A slightly foamy swallow hinders the crispness of the beer slightly but isn't terrible."
"Medium bodied, this beer coated my tongue a little bit. Definitely dry, and lightly carbonated."

"Whew...this may have been an infected bottle or just past its prime, but something was not right about this beer. It looked fine enough: orange-brown color with a thin wispy head. Typical wheat profile on the nose, mixed with trash and rotten orange peels. Taste was stale and harsh, more rotten orange (clementine), skunk, funk, mulch, and old bitter hops. The bottle date indicated it was only a couple months old, and it doesn't seem like a beer could go that bad that fast. Maybe this one is just a ""miss"" for me. Average mouthfeel, but more or less undrinkable. Drain pour."
"A fairly nice Witbier, with classic flavors of spice and orange peel, and nice refreshing bitterness overall. Pours golden, perhaps a bit darker than most, and with good clarity- perhaps too good. I like my Wit a little cloudy- this looks like a Euro lager in the glass. A decent head with some lacing as well. Nice tangerine aromas and a hint of spice. Very pleasant. The taste has that same bright tangerine note along with quite a striking bitterness from the hops. Definitely an American hybridization. The Wit notes are lost a bit in the hop presence, but it's all good- still quite tasty overall. Not quite as refreshing as it could be, but I think more Aprihop than Wit here is the goal."

"Poured into a weizen glass, an effervescently carbonated and clear yellow gold surges beneath a bone white head. Grassy floral zest, sour citrus, and crisp wheat malt blend here nicely in an aroma that hints at a refreshing brew. Smooth lemon citrus and honey flavors glide down the palate after being introduced with a mild bitterness up front and refreshingly bright malt body to follow. This has ""Seafood BBQ on a hot day"" written all over it..."
""
"O: A very drinkable and citrus beer, definitely a warm weather drink"
""
""
""
"Overall this a nice example of a witbier. Nice flavor and mouthfeel. Crisp and refreshing."
""
"Overall – not a bad tasting beer at all, and although not terribly interesting to think about, it does seem to hold pretty true to the general style."
""
"Pours a hazy light gold with a dense white head that settles to a soapy cap. Crisp aromas of citrus and wheat malt dominate, with a touch of spicy coriander, banana, and grassy hops. Pretty spot-on with the nose. The spice really jumps out, nicely bitter in the finish. Decent amount of banana as well. Mouthfeel is crisp, with a light body and sharp carbonation. Overall a solidly refreshing Wit, excellent as a ""cool-down"" after work."
""
"Overall, while not the best out there it's one of my ""go-to"" beers - cheap, tasty, and easy drinking."
"Not bad. It's a good, characterful take on the style, and for that, it may be worth picking up again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it still seems to have held up rather well and was kind of mad that it was this old. Still a great brew overall"
""
"Clementine in the glass has a light golden look with some specs of hazed orange as well. A cap of white stuff with moderate lacing. Smell is ripe off the tap with wheat, some citrus and orange at the forefront. some faint pale malt in the back. Taste is a wheat beer on the fruitier side. Some faint orange, peach, clementine flavor with wheat and a touch of coriander. Feel is pretty light bodied with a nicely done up carb. I could go for a pint of this in the summer."
""
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and sessionable and has some refreshing properties. Compared to other witbiers, it has a lot more citrusy flavors and a bit of acidity."
""
""
""
""
"Alcohol seems hotter than 6%."
""
"Old lady was kind of meh on it too, neither of us identified anything that was an off flavor, but it is easily worth $1.25 a beer, so it gets another half notch on the overall scale."
"O: A really easy to drink beer and a nice thirst quencher. I really enjoyed this beer - another pleasant offering from Clown Shoes, I have been impressed with this brewery thus far. This beer is quite sessionable and I will look forward to quaffing quite a few come the spring/summer - though I will have to trek into NY to purchase this one."

""
""
"It started out with a nice frothy 2 finger white head, reduced to a thin ring. Minimal lacing. Very cloudy, looked like a glass of grapefruit juice. Flavors rolled nicely off the tongue, wheat, citrus, coriander, grass, pepper. Slightly tart and dry, but very smooth. Carbonation was spot on. I'm not a big fan of wheat beers but this one left me wanting another."
""
"O: Overall a pretty good witbier. Honestly better than I was expecting - I consider this to be in competition with Allagash White. It's pretty simple like most witbiers, but very tasty and very refreshing."
"Something throws up a citrusy bitterness on the end, not unlike orange juice...not sure if this is from hops or orange peel, maybe both? Has a pithy, mild sweetness which gives it an interesting smooth/bitter interplay that is pretty refreshing and unique. I like it, not to mention Im a sucker for a good wit. This beer does a good job of standing out in a style where many versions are very similar."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very interesting spin on the style. I like it and would try this again."

"A nice summertime or anytime thirst quencher. Bright flavors with a crisp finish."

"Gearing up for a Clown Shoes tasting in the store, so I figured I'd get more acquainted with their beers myself. This one pours a lightly hazy golden straw topped by over a finger of white foam. The nose comprises wheat, lemon zest, lightly tart tangerine, black pepper, clove, and a twist of ruby red grapefruit. The taste brings in more of the same, but as powerful as the citrus is, the spices are the stars now: black pepper, clove, cardamom, even a touch of coriander for the sake of it. It's powerfully spicy, lemme tell ya, but I think it works here. Right on. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation, a wet feel and a dry finish (deal with that, people!). Overall, a very nice wit, a different take than I've encountered lately, what with the in-your-face spices, but definitely a welcome change-of-pace."
""
""
""
"Overall, nothing special. Ok light beer + fruit but much more to say. I'd skip it."
"Overall, interesting beer and very drinkable. I liked it and would purchase again. Wife liked it - YAY!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes like it smells, only with a little peng of super sweet citrus near the very end, which becomes quickly overrun by more whitepepper. This is maybe the most peppery wit I've ever had. Also maybe the hoppiest. It's a true (Belgian) rendition of the style, though, and the clementine citrus acts as only a mild accentuation of the other flavors, instead of as a cheap sideshow. Quite wonderfully brewed, actually."
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy, milky gold with a one finger head that sticks around. Aroma of coriander and oranges. Taste follows nose, coriander and other spices up front orange in the back, very feint. Thicker than other wits. This is good but not great. I wouldn't seek this out"
"O: A tasty, well made beer."
""
""
""
"Nice belgian yeast, hay, and citrus aroma. Belgian citrus flavor and very bitter. Slight hop finish. It is very unique. Id probably never buy again in a bottle, and glad I didnt get the bomber, but id get it if i saw it on tap. Im not saying I dont like, but there are better wits out there. But id drink it if you handed it to me...and enjoy it. Overall, good, not great; but very unique."
""
""
""
"Bomber from Half Time poured a cloudy gold with a lasting white head. Aromas of wheat, yeast, orange zest and coriander. Mouthfeel was light bodied and crisp. Flavors of wheat, yeast, coriander and ligt orange zest with a crisp lingering citrus/coriander finish. I did'nt notice any Clemintine character, just seemed like a decent Wit Beer to me."
""
""
"The body is a little heavier than I would like for a wit and the carbonation is good. Overall this one is solid, but not generally what I am looking for in a wit."
"Overall a good wit beer that's very easy drinking and hid the ABV so well that you’d think this was a light beer. Not my favorite style of beer, but I liked this one so much that I ordered a second."
""
"Good flavor, well balanced, even keeled."
"Overall: An odd little number, not really a traditional witbier at 6% and with a hop kick that, even 7 months in is substantial. It doesn't have the massive refreshing character that traditional wits do, but as a strong wit, or even a double wit (a style I normally hate) this is pretty darn tasty. I don't remember what the price was (I think around 5 bucks for the bomber), but I'd likely pick this up again when the mood for something a bit different strikes."
"But...the wheat base needs some more tender, loving care. And the mouth feel has all kinds of carbonation issues. I really have no reason to return to this offering."
""
""
"O-I just keep thinking that a good white ale should have some citrus notes, but you should not be hammered over the head with them. I will stick with my Allagash white."
"best witbier I have ever had. Hands down. The yeast (the most important part of a good wit) is top notch."
"Overall: I enjoyed this beer event thought there should be snow on the ground and not this crazy warm weather here in Boston."
""
"The sweetness from the wheat hits first with a strong follow-up of coriander and spicy phenols added from the Belgian yeast. Light velvety body with a sharper carbonation, this beer is a great refreshment, especially in the summer."

""
""
"pours out a hazy orange color with a big fluffy white head that stands two and a half fingers tall. head eventually recedes to a frothy cap leaving loads of lacing behind. the nose is greeted with orange and spice. the taste backs up what the nose experienced with lots of orange,coriander and a nice hop presence to balance it out. mouthfeel was crisp and bubbly with a short dry finish that leaves you wanting more. overall i feel that this is a good example of what a white ale should be."
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent, mild witbier."
""
"This beer poured out as a hazy yellow color with a pretty decent looking white head on top that sticks to the glass fairly well. The smell of the beer has some citrusy aromas along with the wheat softness coming though too. The taste of the beer doesn't have too much of a fruit flavor like I thought it might. The mouthfeel of the beer is light and refreshing. Overall this brew is a good summer beer for sure."
""
""
"O- Where did these guys come from? This is the second beer I've had by them and the second to make my jaw drop. I can only hope the rest of their lineup is just as stellar."
""
""
"O: This beer is very nice and different. I have never had a beer with so much orange taste and its very tasty. This is a great beer when you get tired of your typical beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice thirst-quencher at an awful price!"
"Opinion: Well, unfortunately this Wit didn't really do IT for me. I think that the lack of carbonation was the biggest flaw, so that is one of the easier ones to fix/change. I do like that the spices/additions aren't over-done. Though the Coriander is noticeable, it isn't ""hot"" as it gets in some Witbiers you try. The short and sweet is that I haven't given up on this beer. I would like to try it again on tap where the carbonation can be controlled better and then decide."
"A clearish gold with well carbonated, slow dieing head on top of a clovey, orange peel smell with some coriander and yeast twang; minot hoppy touch as well. Light bodied beer that follows the nose as a smooth passing but not watery brew flow of orange peel, spices, coriander, not cider but some type of plush fruit sweetness that are well balanced pass my tongue and then there's a slightly tart/dry and crisp finish. I wouldn't say this is my fave of this style or the best but for some reason I am really drawn to this one."
"O - I like it, and it is a nice witbier for citrus lovers. If that's your thing then pick this up."
"O: A good, drinkable witbeer. Certainly not the best to be found, but also certainly not the worst. Flavorful and easy to drink."
"O- Was a little let down with the strong orange/spicy taste and smell. A bit on the bitter end of the scale. Wouldn't turn one down, but not searching the streets either. Average-"
"Overall, a decent witbier that I wouldn't ever oppose drinking, but it certainly would not be first choice in the style."
"Flavor is dominated by oranges, more coriander and unknown earthy spicing. Pleasant enough wit, but nothing really special"
"There is not much here. The flavors that do show up, vanish in a second. Which makes this very unsatisfying. Nothing particularly wrong, just blah and ho hum. Not something I am coming back to."
"O: Not really much witbier character to this. Wasn't a big fan."
"Overall: A great overall beer that makes it so easy to drink. Would buy this again."
"Overall: The taste seemed a little watery as the spice and fruity notes fades. Other than that it was very crisp and refreshing. I would have another."
"Overall this one just didn't do it for me; we made careful selections in pour order to prevent something overpowering it, but in the this just wasn't one of my favorites."
"Poured a hazy gold into the glass with one finger of head that quickly disapated with little lacing. Smell was heavy on fruit and spice. Carbonation medium and a medium body as well. The taste was surprisingly heavy on the hops. It has a bit of that hoppy bitterness in the after taste that isn't usual in a witbier. Not horrible, but not as clean finishing as I'd like."
"O: I wasn't too impressed with this one. The flavors and the mouthfeel aren't exactly what they should be for a witbier."
"Appearance is a light golden tone with a one finger head. The nose of this wit has orange or perhaps clementine and coriander. Its` taste has some pepper, light hops, more orange/citrus, a bit of yeast too. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied with a nice, dry finish. This wit drinks easily and is quite tasty. I wish they distributed this in CT."
"This is a damned solid representation of the style, there is some odd lemon plus phenol character that just makes me think of cough drops....still, not uncommon for the style. Really one trick flavor...if there could be a bit more complexity somewhere that would be nice."
"O - I must admit I am impressed with this one. It's a solid brew in every category and one I'd love to pick up again on a hot day. If it felt more like a wit, I'd probably bump this category up to 4.5, but it's a little off for a wit and it is going to get all 4's instead. Good job guys!"
"Poured on-tap and served in a weisse vase, the beer is a golden-orange coloring, bright and unfiltered opaque, with no significant head whatsoever. The nose is citrus sweet and toasted wheat, with a decent blend overall. The beer has flavors that remain light throughout, with a sweet citrus overtone riding the typical spice palate of a Wit. Slight cloying mouthfeel to the beer, with an orange zest tinged aftertaste and a quick, clean finish. The beer is tasty, light, and crisp. Perfect for a hot summer day."
"Overall-Simple beer that I would substitute for orange juice in the morning. Easy to drink and refreshing. Looking forward to trying Tramp Stamp."
"O - Decent beer, my first from this brewery, a good summer beer, it is not outstanding but pretty solid"
"Pours a three finger white head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Hazy amber color, ton of yeast left in bottom of bottle. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Yeasty nose, a sharp wheat and yeast flavor. $2.35 for a 12oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"O: 7/10. a bit too sweet and cloying, maybe, but a decent witbier."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall a pretty tasty and refreshing beer. it definitely had more citrusy and juicy flavors then most wits, but it worked pretty well with the other flavors overall. Pretty enjoyable beer overall."
"Overall: A classic wit, no off flavors, no harsh edges, just a well made beer. Looking forward to the other Clowns."
"I'm glad I started with this beer. It's an excellent thirst quencher that I may buy again."
"O--This is a fabulous wheat beer. I love the orange/clementine flavor. This is a very powerful beer, though you wouldn't know it from looking at it. Clown Shoes continues to impress me."
"Pours cloudy, golden straw, with white head. Nose is over the top with orange, almost perfumey orange - in fact reminds me a tad of Grand Marnier. Plenty of the coriander on the palate, soft wheat, creamy medium body, and some additional perfumey qualities exhibited on palate as well. Prominent aspirin taste too. Finish is spirity orangey, and a tad sour."
"Second Clown Shoe offering of the evening. This one's definitely no Tramp Stamp. Heffeweizen wheat type beer with the orange already in it. This poured a nice orange tint into a pint glass, with a fairly voluminous head. Strong Belgian strain yeast scent, with some floral and citrus notes. Taste follows the nose. Strong on the Belgian yeast with some nice mellow citrus. Moutfeel is decent enough, although a bit thin. Overall, a nice summer beer. Not something I'd make a habit of getting, but I could revisit this on a moments notice without any reservations."
"O/D-Clown Shoes does it again. Was mildly unimpressed by the nose, but the flavor really hit the spot. This brewing company makes some impressive brews. This is one of my favorites."
"O: this is a good beer. doesn't remind me of other white ales, but a good beer."
"Unique in that not many breweries can pull off incorporating big citrus into a beer that traditionally only features moderate citrus. But I think this would be a good white ale without the citrus - just add some lemongrass and it might be more enjoyable. It adds something - I'm just not sure it lives up to the hype."
"D: ive had a few offerings from clown shoes, all really enjoyable, but this hasnt been my favorite. maybe expected a little too much."
"Overall: Good beer overall. With all the hype around Clown Shoes lately, I figured I’d pick up what was available. This is the first one I’ve tried/reviewed and it didn’t disappoint. Definitely worth a shot."
"Overall, a good hoppy wit that makes me want to try more from the brewery. Highly recommend if you are open to something a little different. Not avail here in TX so got from Ummagum in Chicago. Rotation - if avail near me, I'd get the occasional bomber. [O;Y]"
"Good orangey aroma and flavor. Sweet Clementine, bah bah bah."
"Not bad. Has alot of great elements. Has some odd elements. But I dug it. This was a 12 oz-er. Grabbed a bottle because of some recent highbrow opinions that (in my opinion) did not advance the mission of beer advocacy, but essentially were a personal ratfuck attack on the brewer. So, I am going to drink more of their beer and support the local little guy. I shop at his store often, and will now buy his beer more often."
"Bravo, clown shoes!"
"Overall - I would have to say that Clown Shoes Clementine is easily one of my favorite witbiers. Perfect summer time beer. If you enjoy a nice white ale, then I highly recommend giving this beer a try."
"Overall this is pretty ordinary for a witbier and hardly tastes like one either, but it does get better as it warms up that I will admit."
"This brew pours a nice hazy straw color with two fingers of head that quickly drop down. Aroma is great, there's the typical citrus zest and coriander of a wit, but with a hoppy kick in there to keep things interesting. The taste is great, it's a perfectly balanced witbier that provides nice orange zest, coriander, yeast, and hop flavors. They all work in perfect harmony, creating a nice wit that's quite a bit more interesting than the average one. The mouthfeel is a little thicker and more oily than I'd like. Drinkability is superb. Overall, a superlative ""American Witbier"" if there ever was one."
"O- Overall, this is another enjoyable brew from Clown Shoes. I haven't had one of their beers yet that I haven't liked. Recommended for a quaffable beer on a warm day."
"Overall, Clementine is a win for me. It is a perfect beer for a nice hot summer day if you want to drink a beer which is refreshing, good tasting, and not too heavy as to weight you down."
"Many thanks to Nuggethops for the chance to review this one. After a pretty aggressive trip to Costco in 90 degree and rainy weather, a nice witbier seemed like a good choice. Poured into my dfh snifter, pours a murky yellow-orange color. Bright white head, small bubbles, tons of carbonation. Smell- coriander, lemon peel, clove, just so refreshing. Taste- definite hops presence- a really nice bitterness, crisp orange/lemon zest flavors, coriander, light spices. Mouthfeel- tons of carbonation makes for a really dry finish, works well for the style. Drinkability- this is a great summer beer, perfect to cool down with after a nice hot day."
"A darn good witbier and the second solid beer I've had from Clown Shoes. This beer may be a touch too strong to quaff on a hot day, but everything else about it is very nice. I look forward to trying the rest of this brewery's lineup. Recommended."
"I get excited when I see this beer on tap at a bar and that is how a great beer should make you feel!"
"enjoyable, light, and the label isn't offensive ; )"
"O: A surprisingly good witbier that is almost like a Belgian IPA. Good flavors and a surprisingly strong hop presence that blends well with the flavors. Definitely one of the better witbiers out there."
"Hazy straw color with a thin white cap. Sweet candy roma with slight yeastiness. Sweet allover, but with a hop finish, unepected. A little yeast, lemon, grass, and banana. PRetty diverse flavor profile. Medium bodied, great carbonation. Really nice summer brew."
"Overall- The sum is greater than the parts on this one, and factoring in the drinkability it gets a 5. A great summertime thirst quencher and a very fairly priced bomber. Also can we talk about this brewers name… Clown Shoes!? Probably the greatest thing since sliced bread! Looking forward to checking out the rest of their lineup."
"O: This one is okay. Hoppy feet and hoppy feet 1.5 blew me away, but this one is just...meh. Lacks flavor for me."
"O- This beer accomplishes what it states on the label. A refreshing, easy to drink summertime brew. If you like wit's with a focus on orange/citrus flavors, try this beer."
"Mouthfeel: Easy drinking like a summer beer should be light and smooth around the mouth and tongue."
"Overall: Overall, this is my favorite fruit infused white ale on the market. It has a very smooth creamy feel to it through and through and delicious spice, citrus, and sweet notes too. Definitely a great go together with all things summer."
"Poured a slightly hazy orange-yellow, nice bubbly white head that left patches all over. Light and refreshing citrusy notes with a crisp lemony/earthy hop aroma. Hint of wheat twang. Flavor could be more assertive, but this is a nice summertime drink. Orange peel bitterness is slight but noticed in the finish. Smooth carbonation for a light, crisp beer."
"The taste is simple and pleasant. Soft citrus flavors mixed well with mild toasted malts and a good yeast profile. Very sessionable, and a slight chalky palate Worth buying again, but nothing spectacular that puts this Wit ahead of all the rest."
"D - this is a really enjoyable wittbier from Clown Shoes. Definitely a fruitier example of the styles, but the bops keep it in check. This was my first dive into this newest and it has left me wanting more."
"Overall a nice witbier. luckily there seem to be others around that I like but I would probably pick this up from time to time if it were available in CT."
"3.5 D: Aside from the taste (which is mediocre), this is a pretty good beer. Of course, the taste is most important, so take that however you want."
"D - Perfect after working outside all day. Tasty summer beer."
"O: Very well executed beer overall. Orange pairs well with this style, and if you're going to add fruit/essence, you might as well do it successfully. This beer achieves that. Quite good."
"Overall I really like this beer, there is so much going on. The malt backbone really let's the flavors shine through. There is a nice spice like a Belgian blonde, some nice citrus orange, and a creamy smoothness that all blends well together. A really nice beer to have out on the deck on a summer day and watch the sun set with."
"Witbiers tend to be easy to drink and this one is no different, I enjoy the larger presence of orange which adds a refreshing citrus element. This would be a great choice for summer drinking."
"The aroma was on the lighter side of things, lots of spices, wheat and grass like smells coming together nicely. A hint of lemon zest or orange peels in there as well, brightening it up very nicely. The flavor was superb for the style. Lots of coriander and spices running through it, a touch of clove and an almost banana like flavor in the middle. Lots of fresh grass as well in the finish. Wonderful body on this one was chewy most of the time and really just came across very well. Great carbonation kept it lively throughout."
"22 Oz bottle, date Late April, 2011. The beer pours a hazy straw color with a thick head and decent lace. The smell is fairly complex. I detect orange, bananas, spice (coriander?), and a pleasant bready smell. The taste is the best part of the beer. You can actually taste a hint of clementine, as well as a pithy orange flavor, and then a good bit of spice and a light wheat body. The beer is well carbonated and more dry than most wheat beers. Great beer for a hot day of yard work."
"Overall - Well, it has good flavor for a witbeer. But it's a witbeer. Refreshing with a nice flavor and quite a good aroma, but not anything jaw-dropping."
"Can't knock this beer, it's very good for the style. I'm very interested in trying their other offerings."
"O- A tasty if not extraordinary version of the style. Definitely refreshing."
"OA: Great summer brew, easily enjoyed in the sweaty months, I wish my cup holder on the riding mower was big enough to hold a bomber. I wish Clownshoes would put their stuff in cans."
"o: really like this one, the citrus character is awesome, and everything in good balance, drinks great"
"o: I haven't enjoyed a wit this much in a long time. This was refreshing and tasty as hell even if it is a bit different. I'm very eager to try more from these guys."
"Overall a good beer, maybe not a classic witbier flavor, but the orage addition is imaginative and works pretty well. A good summertime, refreshing beer."
"*Paired (extremely well) with a homemade breakfast scramble and a peach jam covered English muffin"
"Typically hoppy Belgians aren't my thing, and this certainly isn't within the bounds of the wit style, but it is still well-integrated, playing the hops and the orange peel off of each other nicely."
"A nice intro to this brewery's beers. Nailed the style and then some.Unfiltered look.A little banana and yeasty. Good lacing, spicyness from cloves and corriander (cinammon and grains of paradise) and yes clementine/orange taste. Above average mouthfeel. A nice one.Thanks Dr. Jay for sending."
"Overall this is a decent example of the style, nicely spiced, but nothing spectacular. I guess I just don’t get all the hullabaloo about this brewery."
"Prost!!!"
"Tangy orange, spicy coriander notes, some very minor leafy hops (Summit on the label) surface in the middle. Full bodied, with a dry aftertaste of coriander that lingers. Smooth wheaty body, spicing isn't overdone, and the bomber is no problem to finish. The orange notes are slightly bittersweet, more peel and pith than fruit. Fairly straightforward but with an interesting complexity. A nice warm weather refresher that i'll return to, hopefully will see this on tap around town."
"D: A really good American wit. Unfortunately, the weather's been pretty shitty the past few days, so I'm not as in the mood for a light refresher as I otherwise might be. I'll have to try this again in the summer."
"Very good drinker, would seek out again. See it as an excellent fit to warmer weather with grilled fish and vegetables."
"Comes out an extremely hazy, unfiltered honey color. Thin amount of head with a solid ring around the glass. The nose hits you with a lot of Belgian yeast. A good amount of coriander and orange zest. The taste is a lot of the yeast again. Some banana and coriander that is usual with a white but a good amount of the clementine zest. There is some hop dryness and a faint bitterness that pops out at the very finish. A very light body with a lot of that American 2-row caramel along with a heavy amount of carbonation. Refreshing."
"The CPJ"
"drinkability is good could have better feel but the flavor and light body will make me pick this up again"
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is a very god lighter Belgian-style beer that is worth drinking for a whole evening."
"I will try this agin when hot outside. Seems to be what it was designed for."
"Highly drinkable. This would be a great summer time thirst quencher."
"I enjoyed this beer for its color and drinkability although I wanted the citrus to shine a bit more than it did."
"Looks nice -- hazy peach with a bright white cap. About a half inch of foam coated the beer, lingered for quite a while, and was a bit clingy. Sour wheat aroma hit my nose first, followed by yeast and coriander, oranges. Low bitterness with the same characters as in the aroma, a little breadier and slightly herbal. Spicy finish with some lingering citrus and wheat. Medium to light bodied, a little heavier than I expect in a witbier, a bit soapy in texture with lively carbonation. I liked it and would pick it up again. Pretty easy to drink with some nice character."
"The flavor and mouthfeel aren't as robust or wit-like as the nose. Up front is bitter with just a slight fruit profile. The finish is very dry and crisp and doesn't have the wheaty profile I'm looking for. It is a nice, refreshing beer that seems really well made for what it is, but it doesn't taste much like a traditional witbier at all."
"A bit too much orange peel for me, but still a very good domestic rendition of the style."
"Pours a nice looking pale orange with a decent pearl white head. Average lacing and retention. Big orange notes in the aroma, definitely lives up to the name. A little disappointed that the nose didn't come through more in the flavor. Had a pretty standard wheat flavor profile, but with a minor infusion of clementines. Tasty and drinkable."
"The feel of this beer seems light at first but then takes on a bigger shape toward the back. Bigger then some Witbiers this goes down easy but has a small aftertaste that starts to get slightly puckering but then is gone. An interesting summer time beer."
"D: Excellent drinkability"
"D- A very drinkable beer that would suit anyone looking for a break from the norms of this style."
"Big tower of sea-foam head; cloudy yellow with a very active carbonation. Spiciness of coriander and hops with orange peel and yeast are blatantly obvious in the nose. Rolling crispness off of a fluffy medium body. All the right facets are here ... orange peel and coriander with a light bready malt flavor. Slight tartness evens the playing field, but the yeast does distract a bit more than needed with some chalkiness in the end. Coriander turns around and drops some bitterness, along with the herbal hop, for a pulling semidry finish. A good take on the style: not over spiced, and well balanced aside from the overtone of yeast."
"The beer is almost orange and is beautifully hazy with a thin quickly receding head. It smells of fresh dough, oranges, and clementines. The taste matches, with some pleasant bitterness coming through, Great mouthfee, smooth and silken, and even more drinkable."
"This is an easy drinking Belgian style ale. Well balanced and not overly spiced."
"D - This was a pleasant surprise. It's among the best witbier's I've had and I'd certainly have it again. All it really needs is a bit more punch in the flavor department. Very refreshing too!"
"D: Goes down easily, quite tasty, not too filling, nice kick and nice representation of style. I'm enjoying everything that I come across with this brewery."
"M/D: Medium bodied, very crisp and refreshing. A great summer beer for sure. Overall, very enjoyable and easy drinking."
"D: If I could buy a 1/6 barrel of this in IL, I would drink this all year round. It's that good."
"Notes: A big, bold white ale. An interesting interpretation and I like the added bitterness, but don't find it obtrusive."
"Drinkability: A great dessert beer. To me this is like a Blue Moon, if you remove the bitterness and amp up the sweet citrus. This is what I envision the style to be. I would get this again. A very good beer."
"This beer poured to be a golden yellow with an orange tint. It had an inch or so of frothy head with moderate carbonation. The smell was very strong of citrus-orange, lemon, or assumably clementines. There was also a spicy aroma. It was light-medium bodied and was crisp and smooth."
"All in all, this is a good brew. I have not tried much from the style, but it's good, but I'm not overwhelmed by it. I'd say, try it if you have access and like light session beers."
"D- Really easy to drink. A very good example of the style."
"Overall a complex and full bodied witbier."
"A decent beer. Wasn't too sure what to expect from this, but it was pretty solid."
"D - Just a really nice, refreshing Witbier curtousy of Clown Shoes. Out of the four beers these guys brew, I dont think they make a bad one. Each one has its own little spin on it and flavor assault. The strength of clementine oranges really makes this one pop."
"A very well done beer. Love the citrus plus hops flavor. Definitely could have a few of these on a nice warm day."
"This was fun and enjoyable. Pourd a 1"" head and showed lots of carbonation turmoil in the glass. Light applejuice yellow. Good smell of orange and citrus which carries through on the palette. Refreshing and very easy drinking summer beer. Minimal hops and not much zing to it."
"M&D - a nice lively mouthfeel and overall tasty, not supersmooth, but a witbeer with these flavors doesnt have to be, a nice beer, OK Clown Shoes, youve set the bar continue to make some good beers"
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid pale and wheat malt scent along with a really fruity clementine, orange peel, and witbier yeast aroma. It's light and dry with just the right amount of citrus character. The taste is good as well. It has a light wheat flavor with loads of citrus orange peel and clementines. It's dry as hell, but the yeast adds a nice fruity finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking wit. The clementines add excellent fruit character that melds nicely with the yeast esters and bitter orange peel."
"d - A decent fruity witbier. Lots of citrus and orange in the smell and taste. Wouldn't seek out again but would give another shot if someone had a bottle."
"Strong wheat flavor from the start to the finish of the taste. There's also some metal to the finish. The aftertaste is short lived and has an iron flavor to it. The body is typical, the carbonation is low. The combination gives the sense of a thicker beer than it really is. The swallow has a nice bitterness from hops. The aftertaste has a mild sourness."
"Considering im not a big fan of this style of beer it really impressed. Like an Allagash white with more of a citrusy kick to it."
"Drinkability: I wasn't crazy about the hop-forward addition to this one, but I could see how someone would like it. Certainly very good though."
"Great Job!"
"I like the flavor of this beer-very light for summer drinking and crisp."
"On tap at Armsby Abbey in Worcester. Being a cloudy orange brew, this one looks more like a Hefe than a true Wit. However, the aroma is dominated by citrus. The flavor combines the tart/bitter orange peel with the wheaty malts well. Spice on this is lower than others. Overall, a good refreshing brew from Clown Shoes!"
"Drinability is great. I am impressed, this is a very tasty and pleasant wit beer, the best I have had in the style in quite some time."
"The beer pours a hazy yellow color with a white head. The aroma is grain with some lemon and orange notes. The flavor is more of the same. I get wheat, yeast and oranges. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Pretty good."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a light golden amber with a 1 finger froathy white head. The head lasted a few minutes, and clung a bit. Aroma was slightly fruity, a small amount of bitter orangey smell. Taste had a small amount of pepper, with a touch of cloves, but was predominantely watered down orange, with a very small hint of grain. Felt ok in the mouth, slightly bitter and over tingly. Easy to drink, but not one to session."
"D - Very drinkable. Very summery. Good beer."
"This is a beer that I am definitely going to pick up again and again. Great package, even better product. Like I said before, my new summer beer!"
"Thanks, Gregg, for the opportunity"
"Poured the color of orange juice with a quarter inch bright white head that dissipates quickly. Nose was lots of citrus, coriander and yeast. Taste follows nose, but a little on the bitter side. Mouthfeel was light-medium in consistency with a pleasant carbonation level. A very nice witbier - very drinkable and the bitterness definitely adds some interest to the style."
"I could drink this beer all day in the summer. Will certainly purchase it again."
"The taste follows the nose. The tangerine and orange rind flavors are very pronounced. There is plenty of the coriander and other Belgianesque spices, such as star anise, to add complexity. There is also a very nice Summit hops that are a touch leafy, a touch citrus, and overall quite mild. The hop, orange peel, spice, and sweet malt complement each other quite nicely. The beer is fairly medium bodied which adds to its substance. This is a beer worth seeking out. The ABV is not present at all, the mouthfeel is very light on the tongue, and there really isn't much of an aftertaste beyond the orange and coriander. L'Chaim."
"Pours a cloudy pale orange. Nice aroma of cloves and orange zest. Taste is quite good. Starts with cloves and then pushes into a nice orangy spice. Although I would call it sweet by beer standards, its not at all over the top sweet. In fact the orange/clove flavor goes great with the White ale style. It doesn't take artificial at all. Very refreshing, and my favorite so far from this brewery."
"I thought that this beer was very interesting. This style for me has been ruled by the ""Matilda"" by goose island in chicago. I was expecting a blue moon with a HUGE slice of orange or a Delirium Tremens with a slice of orange lol if that makes sense. It poured the expected color. The thing i most noticed is that it really differentiated between ""clementine"" and just basic orange. The palate was like a combo of Clementine Orange Peel....the peel big time, and Clove, the clove like Hoegarden. It didnt have the mouthfeel of the Matilda for example, which was viscous and chewy almost. I gave it 90 points for creativity, and delicuousness. Althought after a bomber im all set."
"Fairly thin with a light mouthfeel for the style. Highly carbonated."
