4,10.2,4,4,4,4,4,"White Rascal brewed by Avery Brewing Company, with an ABV of 5.60%  This brew pours out a nice cloudy amber color, with a nice white head.  This brew has the look of most witbier on the market.  The smell is rich with  citrus grains, and malts. You kind of pick up on a sour sweetness in the smell of this brew.  The taste is  bold with flavor.  There is citrus and a nice smoothness of grains.  The mouthfeel is rich , but smooth. There is a lot going on in this brew. Avery Brewing Company did a nice job with this brew.  There is not overpowering in this brew, it has a nice balance to it.  Overall i'm giving  White Rascal 4 out of 5.","nicholas2121","Feb 28, 2015"

3.96,9.1,3.25,4,4,4,4,"Poured a cloudy golden color with a 1/5 finger of off-white head. It looks rather nice in body, though it could do with a larger, fluffier head. Scents of banana, clove, hints of coriander, earthy Belgian yeast, grainy, wheat bread malt and hints of orange peel with slight plastic-like notes. A standard, though overall pleasant witbier aroma that is true to style. Taste begins sweet, with a nice, clover honey-like flavor and a hint of bready malt, with notes of orange peel and coriander in the background. A faint tartness is also present. In the middle the honey-like flavors continue but the coriander becomes more assertive, along with hints of white pepper. The finish is semi-dry, with the flavors of coriander reaching their peak, alongside some floral, honey and white pepper notes. Aftertaste is semi-dry with notes of coriander, white pepper, orange peel and hints of bready malt. A very nice, true to style witbier flavor profile that is pleasantly sweet, refreshing, spicy yet not overpowering and a present, though not overbearing presence of orange peel. Quite nice. Mouthfeel is light bodied, with medium-high carbonation, a slight acidity and a semi-drying and vaguely creamy and smooth feel. Very nice, easy to drink and refreshing. Overall this is an excellent witbier. It stays true to style and provides a wonderfully refreshing drinking experience. While not the single best example of the style it is quite well executed and well worth trying.","Auraan","Jun 11, 2014"

Light medium body with a touch of slick texture. Average carbonation level - just a touch of effervescence on the finish. A tasty wit, but with a weak flavor profile that follows the nose. On the finish, coriander is evident. This one needs to enhance the flavor. As it is, its a very good lawnmower beer.","tillmac62","Mar 19, 2014"

I love funky yeast, but this was just downright weird. Without those notes this easily scores a 3.8. I'm sure ill cross paths with this one again and maybe The Rascal changes my mind. If light bodied American made wheat brews are your thing by all means try it.

3.68,1.4,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"From my tasting notes: Belgian wheat beers are not usually high on my list, but on this occasion the White Rascal really hit the spot. It poured a clear golden color with the distinct Belgian yeast aroma of bananas and bubble gum. For being a lighter looking beer the mouthfeel was quite full and chewy and the taste was full and complex. There were hints of clove, banana, and yeast with a bit of orange as well. There was a lot going on in this beer that I found really enjoyable and refreshing. While I don’t always want a Belgian wheat, when I do I will definitely look for the White Rascal.","brurevu","Nov 21, 2013"

4.12,13.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 11/26/2012. Pours very hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon, orange peel, pear, banana, coriander, clove, pepper, wheat, floral, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and yeast esters with spices; and good strength. Taste of lemon, orange peel, pear, banana, coriander, clove, pepper, wheat, floral, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, orange peel, banana, coriander, clove, wheat, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with malt and spices; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, crisp, and very smooth mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent witbier! All around great balance and complexity of flavors; and very smooth to drink. I really enjoyed this one; far exceeded expectations for sure.","superspak","Jun 25, 2013"

Lacing is quite good as well and there is a considerable amount of carbonation visible in the glass. Smell is lemony with a good wheat twang. Spices are well represented with a nice dollop of coriander, a hint of banana in the back. Taste follows the nose with a great wheat malt core and good spice component. Lemony bright with a slightly tart dryness. A bit of light crackery malt and faint banana/clove with a dash of black pepper. Feel is light with a smooth crisp carbonation. Superbly drinkable and a great version of the style. one of the best I've had. Well done Avery!","scootny","Nov 03, 2012"

The flavor has a balanced blend of citrus and honey. I am not a big fan of spices in beer, but the coriander blends well in this brew.

Nothing special, easy to drink.","raszputini","Apr 14, 2012"

4.6,26.7,4,4,5,5,4.5,"From a can (I know, heresy) obtained from a 6 pack at QFC in University Village near UW campus. Aroma is very sweet. Banana, citrus, gum, and very delicate. Very inviting a pleasant. Appears bright, but translucent. If you mixed orange juice with pineapple juice, I feel like that’s what this looks like. One to two fingers of white head. Tastes like sweet, fruity citrus. Pineapple, banana, coconut, plenty of other tropical fruits. It’s not overly citrusy or carbonated, it really has an incredible balance. It might be too sweet for the average beer drinker, but it’s just right for me. Palate has a perfect balance as well. Good carbonation, no bad residual flavors, goes down smooth. I can’t think of anything else I would ask for. Overall, this is one of the few beers that I feel comfortable buying a sixer of. It seems like no matter what mood I am in, I could be in the mood for this. This beer is what turned me on to Avery, and now I know I won’t go wrong with picking up any of their high brow stuff.","Smurf2055","Jan 30, 2012"

Color is a very slightly hazy amber with no bubble trails. Aroma is mainly yeast with some malt, fruit, spice, bread dough. Flavor is fruit, malt, a little spice, and some tang, but not sure where from. Body is ok and carbonation seems a bit light. Finish is estery, like flavor and average length. Ok beer, nothing special.","drpimento","Nov 06, 2011"

4.11,13.2,3,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Overall I thought that this was a pretty damn good Witbier and so far it is the best one I have had. I find most beers in the style have a 50/50 mix of orange zest and spices but with this beer the oranges taste more fresh and juicy then zesty and they outweighed the spices, I liked the this combination it was pretty different from most Witbiers and pretty tasty. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma, the fresh oranges really stuck out and it wasn't overly spicy. What I liked least about this beer was the appearance, the color could have been brighter with much better head and retention but that isn't that big of a deal. This beer had great drinkability and I could see myself enjoying a couple of these on the disc golf course. I will for sure buy this beer again and I would recommend this beer to any Witbier fan.

Avery is a great brewery and the canned craft beers was a pretty limited selection were I was shopping at for this trip. This was my best option I had, but I was pleasantly surprised. The BMC crowd had a pretty positive opinion on this beer, might have even converted a few BMC lovers into the world of craft beer today.

The aroma is of lemons and a belgium candy yeast strain. The smell is very bubblegum like in nature. The taste is close to the nose, there is a nice bubble gum belgian yeast strain taste that starts followed up by some lemonzest and then a slight hop bitterness at the end. The mouthfeel is well carbonated and slightly thin. Overall it is a solid wit. The candy yeast strain gives it a slightly different flavor than others in the class.

The taste is an amplified veraion of the nose. The spices create a smooth banana flavor that has the clove and cream taste afterwards. Great lingering aftertaste that leaves nothing behind. Smooth, medium-bodied feel that coats the palate. Overall, this is one of the better canned beers ive had. I'm impressed, very drinkable.","ChugginOil","Jun 14, 2011"
4.39,20.9,4,5,4.5,3.5,4,"First CANundrum - how to agitate the yeast into suspension. I went with a combination of rolling the CAN back and forth on the counter, followed by a hand-held back and forth inversion ala a paint mixer. The Crack did not release a gusher, but I was ready if it had. I repeatedly interrupted the Glug to CANtinue to agitate the yeast into suspension. I was met with a finger of very rocky, bone-white head with moderate retention as a result. Color was a cloudy, hazy lemon-yellow, like fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice and even some floaties for good measure. Nose was redolent with spices, the coriander just reaching up to tweak my nose, followed by the zest of the orange peel, then the mustiness of the yeast. I recently polished off some Blue Moon in a CAN that had been hanging around, but this beer puts that one to shame! Mouthfeel was a tad thin, but the riotous taste of the spice, the citrus and the yeast was memorable. I am still not a big fan of the style, but I know a good one when I taste it.

Rich notes of grass and hay opened it up, and melded seemlessly into a pear driven fruity yeast body. Very intresting and quite complex, but then the smack of the spice hit you and it was all over. Really intense here as the almost pepper like notes bounced all over the tongue and really just put on a great show.

Flavor is a good balanced witbier with orange peel, spice, a medium-big malt, low hops, and a little yeast all coming through without a distinct front or backside to the flavor.

It's lively, refreshing and clean refreshment yet it retains a consistency that truly suggests liquid french bread, nearly mid-body with just a bit of viscous feel.

I has a great citrus aroma, nice long lasting head, nice lacing, pale yellow color. But color means nothing if the beer tastes great. You can taste the citrus but also the variety of spices.

A citric smell permeates with some sweet wheat odors and spices, but nothing overpowering. A little thin for my liking, but still retains a good lemon peel pop with some corriander and is a little fluffy thanks to the yeast. A good wit but a little underwhelming.","clayrock81","Oct 08, 2008"

Again, the taste follows suit with wheaty bread-like flavor coated with spices amd a tart dry finish. This beer has a fairly thin body with a sparkling carbonation quality.

Smells of lemon, coriander, wheat, a bit of grass and yeast. Tastes spicy and somewhat sweet, yet it's crisp and refreshing.

Malty, wheaty flavor spiked with a faint metallic tang (yeast?) in the mid-mouth. Did not note the citrus or sourness that some others report.

Smelled like a quality Belgian white -- fruity, yeasty, and a little spicy. Like blood orange marmalade on fresh bread - yum. Above average taste for a domestic wit, nice yeast taste treads the line between fruity and bitter, some apple in the finish. I thought this was an unusually big body for this style, but it was balanced by carbonation.

Slightly sour wheat malt and yeast presents a dryish, mildly powdery texture. Evenly and pleasantly spiced with evident orange peel and coriander, riding into the finish with vague herbal hop presence. Very little bitterness, but some hop flavor is there. Good balance, neither leaning towards sweet, sour, bitter, or overly spicy. Nothing crazy or really out of the ordinary for the style, but it's solid and benignly drinkable.

On the palate, an offputting cooked grain note leads things off, followed by some fruity sweetness and a carbonation/acidity combo that succeeds in drying out things through the finish. Mouthfeel is suitably medium, with some yeasty thickness and acidity that lends a feeling of lightness. Overall, this beer contains representations of all the touchstone elements of Belgian witbiers, but none of these elements feel right; they're all executed with what falls somewhat short of success. The gestalt of that is that this beer is only mediocre; there are much better examples, both from Belgium and even from America, out there.","geexploitation","Nov 26, 2006"

Palate is nice and lightly spiced - coriander, orange peel, allspice, and just a hint of black pepper accent a crisp, light base of wheat and light aromatic hops.

Good yeasty and bready feel to the beer, but other flavors get to share time equally, a well balanced wit. Mouthfeel is not as tangy as I might like in a wit, but not off putting.

The taste is mostly yeast with only faint hint of coriander. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this beer fits into the rather large group of American made wheat beers that are bland, light on flavor, and just don't do it for me.

An underlying sweet malt and wheat body provides excellent balance. Drinkability is through the roof. There is a lot of flavor here, nicely balanced and layered, this is probably my favorite witbier.

A wonderful drink for a hot day, or even as a winter warmer. Definitely worth giving a go if you like witbiers, or spiced brews in general.

Theres coriander, an herbal, pepperyness, grain, and wheat. It has a very sweet and inviting smell. The taste is instantly refreshing: crisp, spritzy, slightly sweet up front, with a moderately dry finish. Its got a light, airy wheat flavor.

3.66,0.8,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Bottle obtained from the brewery and consumed a couple days later. Pours a gorgeous finger and a half fluffy pristine white head over a super murky light cream yellow liquid. Smells like scrambled eggs on toast. That was weird, but seriously, that was my first impression. A second sniff reveals wet yeast, clove, dark wheat bread, and salt. Perhaps some straight up H2S, sulphur. Tastes like a witbier should, perhaps a bit mroe watery than I've had before. Yeast, clove phenolic, a gentle tart citrusy zing. I was expecting, but don't get any, orange peel. Overall the beer is wet sweet enough that the clove and tart zing are bathed in a refreshing nectar, rather than standing tall and oppressive on the tastebuds. Md light body that hangs fluffy on the tongue. Moderate carbonation works with the flavors and mouthfeel.","mentor","Aug 15, 2005"
3.77,3.9,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Evenly hazy lightly greenish yellow appearance, medium head of bright white color. Laces in dripping rings. Aromatic, stuffy and yeasty with orange accents and light pineapple. Mouthfeel is sub-medium, carbonation is fairly lively but more subdued than some. Flavor is straightforward, senses of candied fruit, plenty of sugary sensations, chalky tones that range to chewing on a pencil, but mainly similar to many Wits. Finishes relatively clean with a lemon candy aftertaste. Seems about typical for style, a bit metallic in all over impression and not highly spiced, but pleasant enough.","ADR","Aug 13, 2005"

Throw in some tartness and spiciness. Tastes modestly sweet with light banannas and papayas. Citusy with ripe lemons, kiwi, and pears. Quite spicy with corriander, curraco, and pepper. Light but firm body is silky smooth and a quite creamy and slick. High carbonation plays on the toung. Light honey or powdered sugar sweetness in the finish along side of tartness and light bittering. No real hop presence. Slight alcohol flavors in the finish helps with the dryness and crispness. Good for the summer season.","BEERchitect","Aug 09, 2005"

The aroma is an interesting mix of bready yeastiness, earthy/ herbal coriander, and a hint of zesty lemon notes. The taste is just barely sweet up front which accentuates the spritzy, citrusy lemon acidity. This beer is quite light on the palate and is quite refreshing. There is sort of an austere, dry note in the finish which seems to come from the coriander. This is quite a nice example of a Wit, it is spicy and quenching with its light acidity. Again Avery proves that they can brew great standard gravity beer.","Gueuzedude","Jul 07, 2005"

The taste begins with a light spiciness that includes corriander, clove and lemond rind...all very typical wit...this tastes like a hoegaarden clone to me. It's not that this is a bad brew, in fact it's pretty tasty but i cant really distinguish it from the classic wit hoegaarden. Spicy (spicy as in a lot of spices not as in hot like a pepper) with a cloying sweetness and a crisp refreshing finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and moderately carbonated but i feel it could have been slightly more carbonated and it would have made the beer more refreshing. The drinkability is high as this is a tasty wit, and is quite a refreshing summer brew, possibly a cheaper alternative to the everpresent hoegaarden.","silver0rlead","Jun 12, 2005"

In the nose it's quite typical with notes of coriander and citrus rind; and it's light body passes almost unoticed across the palate with the exception of a delicate zest at the front of the tongue from it's very-fine bubbled, effervescent carbonation. The flavor is drier and more coriander-based than some examples, but there is some tartness and a touch of lemon there as well.

The nose features a peppery and clove-like edge to it, again its ok. Wasn't impressed by the mouthfeel, its almost a pure yeasty feel. The taste itself is pretty low key, almost like everything is muted; the spiciness, orange, and some melon.

This beer is mildly sweet and as smooth as silk, really light in mouthfeel with the yeast fluffing it up a little bit so its not too slick. I can taste the wheat malt, the orange flavor here seems a bit sweeter than other wits Ive had and it works really well.

Slightly bitter aftertaste from this very citrusy beer ( I took the lemon out immediately, so it wasn't from that). This was enjoyable bitterness. It is a very carbonated beer, which I liked and made it feel good and go down easy. Like most wheat beers, I this it would get tiring after a while.

4,10.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Pale gold in hue with tawny highlights, fairly hazy, I managed to keep the big glob of yeast in the bottle. The head was white in color; at the apex it was almost one finger in height. Head retention was fair; it rapidly slipped to a skinny cap. Subsequent lacing was unorganized and spotty plus it didnt cling all that well. I thought, maybe, Avery would tinker with a classic style. They didnt on this occasion. The nose is pleasant; it is as strong in potency as can be expected for the style. There is a big dash of wheaty-mustiness then comes a flash of spice, citrus, orange, and vanilla. I have no complaints with the bouquet. It is not flashy or very zippy but it is inviting. The palate is very tasty and it is not bold or crazy hoppy. The taste is ideal for the style. I like the big wheaty taste, which couples nicely with a bit of yeasty musk. Yum. The citrus bite is petite but big enough, once this subsides an orangey taste moves in. The finish is home to the coriander and other spices. There is a good firmness in the taste as well, some straight malt qualities too. I am surprised at the lively tang. The citrusy flavors only seem to grow in time (and warmth). This is very clean for a Wit as well, which is very nice; the spices didnt wear me down. Medium in body, lively carbonation, the mouthfeel is pleasant. It is very refreshing and just as drinkable. This is worthy of buying a six-pack of, a good warm weather beer.

The taste is very one sided; that side being a load of corriander. If you want to know how this tastes, buy some cilatro seeds, crush them in your teeth and gargle. I detect none of the curaco orange peel they say is in this, and I was rather disappointed by the yeast. The strain is not very strong tasting, and leaves this beer feeling almost too light and thin. I expected more clove taste also, yet only got light cinnamon in the last breath. The mouthfeel is very watery and the carbonation is weak.

3.97,9.4,3.5,4,4,4,4,"I enjoyed this offering from Avery quite a bit. I was expecting a bit more from its appearance but appearances aren't everything. The taste and nose to this beer were quite appealing. This would make for a nice, refresher on a summer day.","Boilermaker88","Feb 11, 2004"

2.43,-33.1,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,"I cannot think of any other way to describe the way this pours other than cloudy urine. It looked like grapefruit juice. The smell was actually unsettling. It had a rubber or plastic aroma to it. I was hoping that the taste would differ from the smell and appearance but it didn't. There was a small citrus taste, but overall, it was very flat and odd-tasting. Maybe I am just not familiar enough with white beer, but I am sorry to say that this one will make me steer clear of going after another one.","ALESwhatCURESya","Jan 24, 2004"
3.92,8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"This is a drinkable beer that can be enjoyed anytime of the year although I'm sure summer is the ideal season to drink this. I liked this beer and would happily revisit it again and again.","filabrazilia","Jan 19, 2004"
3.95,8.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"This beer pours a light yellow color with a small white head and leaves very little lacing on the glass. The aroma is a mixture of spices, wheat, some hops, and a little citrus. The flavor starts out a little hoppy and then has the standard wheat flavor, but has a nice bit of spices to make it interesting. It's a good beer, but not too special.","clvand0","Jan 16, 2004"

4.02,10.7,4,4.5,4,3,4,"Overall Impression: There is something in the aftertaste in this beer I’m not liking. It’s a good wit, roasted wheat, nice yeast, good spices, but it was too light and mild. Would guess this might make a good “I hate wits, but want to try one” beer. Would have wished for a date on the bottle, corriander fades so quickly. I was in the mood for something Belgian, and White Rascal scratched that itch.","HardTarget","Dec 28, 2003"
3.75,3.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,""A truly authentic Belgian styule wheat or "white" ale, this Rascal is unfiltered (yup, that's yeast on the bottom) and cleverly spiced with coriander and Curacao orange peel producing a refreshing fruity thirst quencher."","GCBrewingCo","Dec 13, 2003"

4.17,14.9,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"White Rascal pours a nice straw/golden colored cloud with head that was at first rather abundant, and then settled to about 1/4 inch throughout the rest. The smell was that of summer time, very fresh, a bit fruity, and floral with a touch of yeast. Unlike some of the other whites that are dominated by yeast in the flavor, white rascal is dominated by the spices. Very nice subtle citrus flavor along with other spices(coriander) balanced with the yeast and a touch of hops, i believe Czech Saaz in this case. A very nicely balanced white to say the least. I very much liked this beer and would put it up there with Hoegaarden and Allagash White and above Blanche de Chambly as some of the best whites I've had.","BittRnessabounds","Dec 05, 2003"
4,10.2,4,4,4,4,4,"No fear of spicing here - the beer teeters on the edge of being heavy-handed, but pulls back just a bit to hang on to drinkability. Lemony hazy, with powdery clove aroma. Sweet with yeasty clove and a citric brightness. This is what Blue Moon could be, if Coors knew what they were doing.","Brent","Nov 21, 2003"
4,10.2,4,4,4,4,4,"A solid beer across the board, this little rascal pours a dark hazy yellow with a starting white head of about 3 fingers. The head dissipates to athin layer over a couple of minutes but does its job of lacing the glass. The aroma is classic: lots spice and yeast notes crowd the olafactory network and sing of the wheat. The flavor is a bit less classic with a fairly subdued clove sense and rather nice citrus level that is a bit atypical for the style. Nice feel continues from start to finish with less dryness, but a nice gentle linger. Good drinkability especially in warm weather venues.","AtLagerHeads","Nov 14, 2003"
4.3,18.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a pale cloudy golden color with a fluffy white head. Aroma is that of a classic wit. Yeast, wheat, coriander and other spices are all there. Bright and creamy med-bodied mouthfeel. Very clean wheat front combines with a vanilla sweetness. Some mild bitterness exists in the middle with a lemony tang. The finish picks up the wheat flavor again in addition to some yeast. It seems to tie all the flavors and spices together. Excellent drinkability, as this wit goes down very smooth. If there's one knock on it, I wish the spicing was a little more prominent in the flavor profile. Other than that, White Rascal is an easy drinking and refreshing offering.","Winter","Nov 14, 2003"
4.04,11.3,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"The pour produces a beclouded lemon yellow color with the head plentiful and the color a brilliant white as this creamy delight evanesces a satiny sheet of lace clings longingly to the sides of the glass. Sweet malt and hints of yeast at the front, coriander and fresh grated orange peel also in this splendiferous nose, start sweet and tart, top is light to moderate in its palate pleasing feel. Finish is stinging in its acidity, the hops spicy and pleasing but not overstated, very dry aftertaste and another winner from this most magnificent brewery.","Gusler","Oct 12, 2003"

4.27,17.6,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"The head is small. It's also white and foamy. The bright yellow/gold beer is slightly hazy. Minimal spots of lacing. Gorgeous nose: buttery, grainy, nutty, fresh, flowery, creamy. The front is a simple combination of fruit, butter, pepper, coriander, and orange/citrus. The middle is tangy, fruity. A nice, dry, buttery, peppery finish. Surprisingly bitter. This is good. The butter gives this a slight edge in my book over some others. But I think the coriander is just a little overstated. Delicious.","kbub6f","Sep 15, 2003"
4.1,12.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a light golden straw color with a good-sized bright white head that has a surprisingly long retention. Nose is coriander and orange zest with a bit of sweet malted wheat. Taste picks up right where the aroma left off with some initial sweetness of wheat and barley followed by some spicy notes (mostly coriander) leading to a finish of some acidic orange citrus and semi-spicy hops. Light, crisp, and refreshing. A great brew for the summer. I could easily drink several more of these, and thankfully, therere five more in the fridge.","Morris729","Sep 09, 2003"
3.8,4.7,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This beer was recommended when I was in search of GLBC Holy Moses. This was a good substitute and sample of the Belgian-style wit beer. It is lightly carbonated and light-bodied. It has nice spicy notes and some hop to its flavor. A bit of a spicy aroma also. It is a wonderful seasonal beer that is good on a hot summer day. (although the Holy Moses on tap is better.)","RxforBeer","Sep 01, 2003"
3.44,-5.2,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This isn't a bad Wit. Pours a light gold color with a medium thin white head. Thin lacing. The aroma is nicely hopped with some citrus and spice thrown in as well. Light and crisp with flavors of citrus, clove, hops and other spices. The finish is somewhat wheaty and spicy. Overall a refreshing and crisp (if a little mundane) Wit.","Dogbrick","Aug 25, 2003"
4.18,15.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Very easy to drink. A solid wit. Cheaper and just as good as Blanche de Chambly and Hoegaarden. I'm inclined to get it again when I'm in the mood for a spicier witbier.","Mitchster","Aug 10, 2003"
3.97,9.4,3.5,4,4,4,4,"A solid wit that offers the usual array of orange and coriander aromas and flavors. Nose is solid and pushes the same sensations to the palate where some orange peel pushes into something slightly spicy. Hoppy foilage flavor -- dandelions and weeds! -- in the finish. An all-around good wit -- nothing too unexpected though it did seem a bit under-spiced and a tiny, tiny bit fuller bodied than I might think of for a wit.","marburg","Jul 20, 2003"

An aroma of hops, citrus and coriander. A taste of hops, citrus and coriander. A rather buttery feel to it, which is different for this style. Not a bad wit.","Wildman","Jun 12, 2003"
