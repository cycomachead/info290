"I'm a sucker for a good citrus beer."
""
"Serving type: bottle"
""
""
""
"Easily in my top 5 favorite American beers. Perfect amount of coriander and orange with the beer flavor."
""
"Poured a golden yellow with a god amount of head that lasts. Smells like a meadow full of wheat and clove with a hint of citrus. Taste is fantastic and goes down ultra smooth. One of the best belgian wheat ales I have had the chance to down."
""
""
"one of Shiner's better brews, and definitely a step up from shock top and blue moon. the coriander is not overpowering which is the case with some other witbiers in my opinion.  Overall solid witbier"
""
""
""
"A better than average Belgian White. Nothing fancy but a step up from your every day Belgian Whites."
""
"Decent wit bier but a little thin."
"Overall- The most disappointing Spoetzel beer I have tried.  I am a big fan of this brewer  and this beer just did meet my expectations."
"Excellent. I prefer White Wing over Blue Moon for a refreshing wheat ale"
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad take on a Belgian White."
""
"Pours a clear gold, with a slight effervescent bubbling that lasts well into the glass, producing less than a finger of rapidly dissipating, frothy & variously bubbled, white head that leaves no appreciable lacing. Aroma is wheat, sweet bread, coriander, Belgian yeast fruity esters of orange, banana & faint pineapple. Taste is typical for the style: wheat, pie dough, coriander, orange. The front half of the sip tastes similar to the nose being coriander heavy & sweet, fruity with the orange & banana dominant with pineapple joining in, in the latter half of the sip. Finishes disappointing bland & everything good & bad simply disappears in the dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, starts creamy but turns prickly, finishing a little bit slick."
""
"I hope this satisfies the save of my rating."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of oranges, wheat, grains. Taste is oranges, spices, malts, clean and refreshing. Feels medium-light in the mouth and overall a good thirst quencher, and a beer I could drink several of."

"Pours a clear, golden color.  1/3 inch head of a white color.  Good retention and good lacing.  Smells of coriander, orange, hint of hop, slight yeast, slight sweet malt, and a hint of pale malt.  Fits the style of a Witbier.  Mouth feel is smooth and clean,  with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of orange, coriander, sweet malt, slight pale malt, and a hint of hop.  Overall, decent appearance, aroma, good feel, and decent blend.  Still, nothing special as a Witibier."

"Overall (3.92) : The aroma, appearance, and taste are great. It went down easy and was flavored uniquely. The mouthfeel falls short but that's not a huge problem for me. The main difference here between this and other wits is that it's got a peppery feel to the wheat taste and the musky sharp cheddar dryness. I'd drink it again, and it's a good Wit if you're not too picky. I'd like another actually."

"Taste- Meh. Its not good not bad. A light wheat beer but hit me with some coriander at the end. I would drink this if i was already drunk. But there are better wheat beers."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear golden color with a thick foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are excellent.  Strong orange peel and coriander aroma.  Pretty much a malty taste.  No bitterness from hops.  Slightly spicy coriander taste at the end.  Okay beer.  Somewhat watered down.  Would drink if available but wouldn't seek out and would probably drink something else if there was a good beer selection."

"It beats some of the Macro Belgian Whites out there (ahem! Shock Top ahem!) but then again that doesn't speak that highly of this brew.  Honestly I would drink again but I wouldn't pick it up anywhere."
""
""
""
"Overall very light if any Witbier flavors make this a very lackluster take on the style. Avoid."

"This brew pours a clear, pale yellow color. It's mostly clear, with just a slight haze and a small head. It's not as attractive as I'd hoped. Some wheat-like tartness is notable in the smell...along with a hint of spice and citrus. No malt, and no real hop aroma. The taste is spritzy and a nice spice character comes out. On the sweet side. Moderate to light in body. It's a recognizable wit, but not much beyond average."

"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into pint glass. A: Clear, golden yellow. Some effervescence moving up the glass, a few bubbles at the top of the beer but no head and almost no lacing. S: Orange peel. Mild sweetness. I tried getting the coriander but I couldn't. Slight bit of malt. No hops. T: The taste pretty much follows the nose. Lots of orange, lots of sweetness. No hops at all. No bitterness for most of the drink. There is a very mild bitterness toward the bottom of the glass, but not much. M: Light bodied. Good carbonation. Very refreshing mouthfeel. O: This is not a bad beer, although there's not much happening with it. I would not pay for it again - especially at 8 bucks a sixer. However, if it was offered to be at a party or BBQ, I wouldn't refuse it. As a beer goes, it's rather boring. This is the first Belgian white I've ever had, so I can't rate it based on the style. If this is what the style usually is then I probably won't be a witbier drinker. I would have preferred a little hops. I think a beer needs some bitterness to make it a beer, even if it's just a little. On the other hand, as an all-around cold drink on a hot day, I certainly would not pass it up."

"I give this beer a high score because its the best white I have had up to this point. I've tried several, and I generally think there is a poor, sour aftertaste for this style of beer. I really Spoetzl's White Wing because it has a clear and crisp finish."

"I utilized an agitating pour, involving continually swirling the beer in the bottle as it was being decanted into a glass. This prevented any cascading, but it did produce two rocky, fizzy fingers of bone-white head with limited retention. Color was a slightly hazy light-yellow (SRM = 2). Nose smelled more like lemon zest than orange peel and with a black pepper spiciness. Oooh. It is already a hot, humid day, so I am hoping for something refreshing from this beer. Mouthfeel was thin, but fizzy, with loads of carbonation. The taste was kind of light for the style, but I definitely tasted the orange peel at this point. The finish was semi-dry with the coriander giving it a black pepper bite. It was, indeed, a refreshing beer, but it was lacking in taste."
""
"Pours a hazy golden with a creamy medium white head. Aromas of citrus peel and coriander. The flavors begin with some lemon, then light bread, and finishes with some spices and a hint of bitterness to balance. Mouthfeel is decent. Overall a good witbier."

"Poured into a standard pint glass, this is a bright gold beer with a nice thick finger's worth of head. The aroma is actually pretty good for the style--lemony, very fruity, a touch of coriander--and the coriander comes through quite clearly when drinking. It's thirst-quenchingly acidic, and very fruity. It's actually not that bed of a witbier--heck, I'd even say it's on par with Hoegarden--2014 Hoegarden I mean, not 1990s Hoegarden, before it got dumbed down. Unusually good beer from Shiner."

""
"The taste was a bit too much. I drank about 3 until I could get my mind on it. Tastes like orange citrus bathroom cleaner with a very slight beer taste. Bitter bite at the end. Has too much orange taste and not much else"
""
"Not bad. The appearance was a thin yellow with a bit of haze and a head that dissipated quickly. The smell was mostly citrus with a little bit of wheat. The taste was the same with a little bit of mint and then orange peel in the finish. Very comparable to Blue Moon. Was not overall very impressed."

"O: Overall an easy drinking wit, good snap and crisp carbonation. Worthy a try for a summer time quencher of a light affair."
""
""
""
"Lean body with a medium-light carbonation. Washes down with little difficulty. Could use a little bit of heap or girth. Otherwise, a friendly witte."
""
"The beer pours a nice light gold, that's pretty clear, not a lot of evidence that it hasn't been filtered. The aroma is a full wit aroma with flowery hops melding with the orange and coriander. The taste is outstanding covering all the basics for a wit, malt, hops, yeast, and spices blending well. A nice light feel, just as you'd expect from a wit. I thought this was a very nice effort from Spoetzl. While they usually give a nice low end version of most styles, a subtle style like a wit plays right into their sweet spot. One of their best offerings, I will be drinking more."

"Taste-Wheat, orange peel,coriander. Light and refreshing, a nice spring/summer brew, that would go down nicely on a warm day."
""
"Pours a hazy light orange with a foamy white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, spice, yeast, and citrus fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable, but the flavors are a bit watery in my opinion."

"White Wing might be overly simplistic in taste and body, but the overwhelming perfume of orange peels and coriander completely seduce the senses even as the ale carries an orange soda pop character."

"This is a nice little beer which, to me, tastes more like a Belgium witte than an IPA."
""

"Drinks very easy, but not one to session on. I was already a little tired of the flavor profile after about 4 ounces. Could do a few in August I'm sure. Would rather have a blue moon..."

"Picked this up as part of a mixed 6 because I tend to like wheat beers. Okay appearance, not the murky look that i like of wheat beer and decent smell, but kinda weak. Taste was much better than expected after look and smell. Overall a decent beer but not one I will revisit unless the cost is good. Also loses points due to being below 5%."

"Witbiers are never usually my favorite, but this at least is a decent take on the style, and on par with Lost Coast's Great White beer - inoffensive, simple, and does the trick if all there's only a bunch of adjunct lagers otherwise laying around. I do wish the body were thicker to accentuate the playful wheat notes, but it's definitely a decent option for those looking for a simple beer to sip on during the lazy, warmer days of the year."

"Overall I thought this was decent beer and a slightly above average example of a Belgian White Ale, I was a little worried that the taste might be too coriander and orange peel forward since the aroma was pretty intense with it, but it was fairly balanced when I got to the taste and that helped the drinkability. This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, pretty crisp, a little fizzy, not filling, and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, I think I could drink a couple of these in a row but I think I might start to get bored with it after that and I think this would make for a nice spring time beer. What I liked the most about this beer was the balance in the taste, no aspect was too overpowering. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it wasn't bad, but I thought it was a little too light and fizzy for the style. I don't think I would buy this beer again, but I might consider it if I'm really in the mood for this style and I would recommend this to anyone who likes the style. All in all I didn't love this beer, but I didn't hate it either, it kind of fell right in the middle for me and I don't find it to be that memorable but I would say it's still pretty solid as far as the Style goes, keep up the solid works guys."
"O: not impressed."
""

"O: Really a decent Witbier. Nice attempt at the style by Shiner."

"Pours a hazy straw yellow in color with about a half of a finger white head that settles down to the top and sides of the glass. Some spotty lacing is seen. The aroma is of corriander, wheat with a hint of orange peel. the taste is actually even better and a tad on the sweet side. Clean finish with a hint of banana but I am sure there isn't any in there. Overall a decent brew."
"Overall, White Wing is much better than most of the beers that Shiner produces. It's not even in the same league as what I would consider good Witbiers, and I doubt I'd buy another bottle, but I don't regret sipping this one."
""
"Overall a good beer. Definitely a great session choice."
"Pours out to a thin white head that falls to a thin ring and no lacing. Hazy yellow-orange color. Aroma is coriander, followed by orange peel and light grains. Flavor is tangy, spicy and light on the palate; built to compete with Shock Top and Blue Moon. Mouthfeel is light and clean--would be refreshing in the summer. Overall a decent quencher."

"Atmosphere is okay. Bubbly head, no real lacing. Nose is bready and yeasty. Tastes like it smells, bread with some indiscernible spices. Overall, this is an okay quaff."
""
"A very fine witbier that comes across well-balanced, decently complex, and delightfully tasty. Smoothness, warmth, and a subtle yet varied fruitiness and spiciness all come together and make a tasty beverage. Perfect for anyone looking for a lighter bodied and flavored beer but with substance and intrigue."
"O: Definitely an easy drinking beer and one that pairs well with spicier foods - I'm having it today with some chili. Light and refreshing."

"Shiner White Wine is going to replace Shiner hefeweizen, if sources are correct, and is only the second time Shiner has ever brewed a beer of this style. I find it a nice alternative to other Belgian wits and I like that it is a little less sweet than most. It offers some good refreshment and would make a good choice of beer on a hot day. Its lighter refreshment still offers enough taste and body to satisfy craft beer fans while still remaining approachable enough to satisfy the macro- brew crowd. It’s a good example of the style and one I will purchase again."

"This is a nice warm weather, Belgian inspired brew that's definitely geared to a wider market than craft been aficionados. It's a nice alternative to Blue Moon. It's easy drinking and tastes good enough to have a few. I have a soft spot for Shiner beers. I will definitely be keeping some around through the summer months."
