review_text
"The Banche De Chamby....is decent....but I don't think I would buy a six of it.  The beer was poured carefully into a tulip glass to avoid the settlement at the bottom of the bottle.  It was golden in color with foamy head that is not lacing.  The scent was chardonnay like with hints of orange spice.  The taste was much like a Belgian white.  The mouthfeel was light in body with good carbonation.  Overall its good and I'm glad to have tried it."

"O: I like this Unibroue offering because of the relatively low alcohol content.  It is a solid, easy drinking wheat ale."

"First sip at cafe in Quebec City June 2012 with Andy."
"O: Gotta say, little disappointed here. Was expecting a solid brew and was let down. It's an average beer in my opinion at best. Flavors are there, the look is there, but it just didn't seem executed well. As stated before, maybe a bad batch, but it was incredibly bitter up front which kind of took away from some of the flavors. I am more of a complex beer appreciator so this one might be a little bit light for my style. That being said I have tried others of a similar style and enjoyed them quite a bit."

"Hmm very refreshing, so much flavor compared to watered down american versions of this style."
""
"Taste: Some lemon, spices, and cloves.  Crisp carbonation."
""
""
"It's crisp and refreshingly light with a floral character  and some orange peel and coriander coming through. Delicious."
"Overall : Excellent fresh white beer. Missing a little taste and some feel, while not too heavy while eating."
""
""
""
"This tasted more like a hefe then a wit. I couldn't detect as much spice as I would like from a wit and there were a lot more banana esters than I would expect from a wit. It was a solid beer but a little off for the style I think."

"Picked up a single fresh bottle at Cafe Craft in North Charleston, SC. After scoring the tin foil cap and popping the top, I proceeded to pour the dirty blonde ale in to a tall wit tulip. Exceptionally cloudy with tons of unfiltered particulates floating freely. The drink dons a  3-finger frothy foam head of fine bubbles. Most of the foam dissipated fairly quickly, but it left a nice thin layer that endured. Decent retention with no lacing. Lots of coriander in the nose, with a citrusy orange zest. Faint grassy, wooden aroma in the background. The first sip brings a distinct lemon sourness, tart, with grains of wheat in the finish. Nearly undetectable clove spice. Simple. Aside from the coriander and citrus, the beer is lacking complexity. Mostly due to the sparing use of competing spices. Ultimately I think that adds to the charm of this one. The carbonation is lively and the body is somewhat thin. Refreshing. This beer immediately makes me think of summer time. With it's fresh lemon citrus flare and easy drinkability this beer is the perfect companion for a hot sunny day. While not the best wit I've had, I'll take this over any number of the crappy shandy varieties I've sampled."

"Great beer for its style."
"Overall: An excellent and high-quality witbier. Highly recommended."
""
"This is a very enjoyable Wit - from first pour, I was impressed by the orangey-gold colour, the slightly off-white head and the steady carbonation you find in most Unibroue offerings. This is an extremely drinkable brew - I can picture it fitting with a wide variety of foods and settings. The lovely fruit flavours - apricot, organge and bit of lemon give Blanche de Chambly a tasty, but not cloying overall sweetness. C'est fantastique!"
"This beer has exceeded my expectations and I would definatley recommend for any fellow beer drinker.  It has a smoothness comparable to the greats and it goes down quite easily.  It is a full beer that has a lasting flavor.  The only annoying part is peeling the tin-foil off to get at the beer, but after that its all flavor.  I am not a big fan of white ale's but as for as they go this one is at the top.  I would even consider drinking it on a regular basis.  This is my 3rd beer rating so I could have my beer goggles on, however i feel even at this inebriated state i am capable of judging accurately.  Before I thought the french were snobby jerks but now I am starting to like them."

"So overall would I recommend it ? Sure but not with big you have to tried it. I mean if you got the chance try it but if you don t get the chance, you don t have to try it. If you really wanna have a Unibroue, go for la fin du monde or don de dieu or even trois pistoles, is a much better option. But as a Unibroue man this is a good damn beer !"

"I'm not very experienced on this style.  My guess is it is probably good for the style that it is, but it's not for me.  Too much like chardonnay in wine speak.  Feels flat and flowery.  I much prefer some strong carbonation and yeast twang in my wheat beers."

"07/02/13 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. As it's early July this is right on the money. The most surprising thing is the fullness of the flavor that leaves barely any aftertaste. It's not particularly dry as most that have this trait are. I could drink this all day (& night)."

"Though pouring this gorgeous beverage looks incredibly promising, the taste and feel seem too light to leave an impression. The orange is almost overwhelming. The first kick is light but great, and the aftertaste is greater. It's all the steps in the middle that make this drink lackluster."

"What new can be said about this beer? It's a Quebec classic. Appearance is light yellow and cloudy as a good witbier should be. Yeasty nose with orange and spices dominate. Taste is clean and spicy with good carbonation. All in all a solid beer thatâ€™s true to form."

"Pours out to a creamy head, thin lacing and cloudy gold color. Aroma is citrus, coriander, and banana/clove/bubblegum notes. Flavor is generally good for style with the orange peel and coriander coming through and the aged hops and sharp tang of wheat in the finish. There is a hint of alka seltzer in there too. Mouthfeel is light and tingly. Overall a very good ale from Quebec."

"Drinkability at its best, hard to beat on a hot summer day. On the other hand, same flavors could be more bold and with a more robust body. So you can say it is not at par with other Unibroue brews (ps. Expectation is a bitch), but why not have a refreshing faithful to style wit? Lastly I noticed that when it warms up, changes completely and becomes more complex and robust. Which is common, but here it is more delayed than usual. I was a bit confused to go back or not to rewrite the evaluation."

"O - Blanche may please others as the bitterness and high carbonation may amount to preference. As it is, I'm unlikely to have this again as this style is one of the few where I'm looking for a six pack or larger at an affordable price. Shoot me, but I prefer Hoegaarden."

"An overly gaseous beer that kills the palate, and the nose is off putting to unfortunately go with it. I'll be passing on this one."

"This is a very hazy light golden ale. Carbonation looks very light on this one and head retention is nonexistent. That cork was in pretty tight but it seems flat. Aroma is strongly that of pale wheat closely followed by orange and a bit of coriander finishes it out. Mouth does show some carbonation,but it still seems somewhat thin. The flavor is a gentle blend of pale wheat and soft notes of orange. I get just a trace of coriander."
"Worth getting again."
""
""
""
"O: This beer has that typical spiciness associated with the style, perhaps not as spicy as a saison, but it's always definitely there. I like the berries and citrus in the nose, as well as the peach in the flavor. Definitely recommended, one of my favorites from Unibroue."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Disappointing, from one of my favorite brewers. Thin, not compelling, savory off-note. The nose is easily the strongest element."

"O: A solid witbier which is above-average and got my night off to a good start. Not up to the style standard (Allagash White), but still a great beer."
""
"DATE TASTED: October 19, 2013 ... GLASSWARE: Blanche de Chambly flute... OCCASION: trying to liquidate the summer stash before the fall season is unmistakable... APPEARANCE: faint, tepid hay-tinted body with champagne bubble and pencil-thin off-white head; no lacing... AROMA: beautiful wheat/clove connection reminiscent of summer; light banana dough and vanilla cream are latent scents... PALATE: fizzy, active and light-bodied; drinkable and refreshing...TASTE: lightly affected, acidic wheat that maintains its nasal promise--a spiced, seasoned flavor...OVERALL: What doesn't Unibroue produce that doesn't sing or sparkle? The ""lightweight"" of the case that nonetheless packs a pleasurable experience, crisp and aromatic ..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: this is an outstanding witbier, affordable at $7.99, I would definitely have this again and would recommend to anyone who enjoys the style. I have never had a bad beer from Unibroue, excellent brewery, one of the best in all of North America for sure."

"O - This was a lot more tame compared to what i have recently sampled from Unibroue but that's not a bad thing. This is a very refreshing and a easy to drink beer with some delicious flavors. This would be golden during a hot summer day and i think its an ale that everyone would enjoy."
"Pours a light straw color, hazy with a cottony head of white foam. The nose took quite a while to develop. It was faint to begin with then it gained some tart citrus, apple and a spice. The yeast wasn't that funky on the nose and the malt was a light sweetness. There was a nice fresh orange peel and wheat. The whisper of banana and clove and maybe some coriander. As it warmed it developed a stone fruit juicy scent that was very enticing. Taste is bland and a bit plain. The malt was a light cracker on the palate. The tart citrus was very strong. The spice competed for the palate and won out over any sweet fruit. The wheat imparted dryness and it was as dry as champagne. I liked that. It lacked flavor. The banana could have been more prominent and imparted a creaminess to the flavor. The clove could have added depth. The carbonation is the lions share of the mouthfeel and except for it this beer is thin."
""
"Hazy straw gold with a big frothy pure white head in the glass these bubbles take a long while to subside. The smell is pretty standard for a wit, it also has the typical Unibroue yeasty tang in there as well. Orange, banana, coriander and wheat bread round it out. Overall it may be a bit on the weak side. The taste is clean with this one with the wheat providing a solid base and the majority of the taste profile in general. Also in there are hints of spice, yeast esters and citrus. High levels of carbonation make this quite tingly, the finish is pretty clean and dry while the bitterness to sweetness ratio is fairly neutral with little of both. Overall it is another good offering from this brewery, maybe not their best but it is a good example of the style and one that I wouldn't mind having again."

"O-Very nice brew, and a step up from other witbiers and one of the best in the style that Iâ€™ve ever had."

"The witbier offering from my favorite Canadian brewery pours a nice murky burnt apple juice gold, with a ton of white head. An aggressive pour might leave cakes of yeast swimming in your glass, but it makes little sense to pour this beer like a sissy. You want the froth effect, trust me. Aroma is bready malt, apples, citrus, spice, a touch of herbs. Palate is a bouquet of the expected coriander, citrus pith and fruit (orange, lemon, a bit of tropical pineapple which combines with a creamy mouth feel to produce a pina colada effect), and a subtle apple cinnamon spice. Refreshing but not boring, finish is sweet and herbal, with a lingering yeasty sweetness almost like caramel corn. Almost no detectable alcohol or technical flaws I can pick out. Carbonation is lively and right where it needs to be to lift the fruit and spice. An archetypal Belgian witbier and I echo the other reviewers who feel this is the standard to which others should be compared."

"Remember, beer isn't always about what has the the most in your face flavor, sometimes it is about the subtle complexity, the hint of what lies underneath that brings you back for more. I am in California and snap this up whenever I can. Do yourself a favor and do the same if you're a fan of wheat beer!"

"Pours a hazy yellow into my tulip with a lumpy head that quickly fades to some nice fine lacing around the collar. Scent of coriander, orange, wheat, and a hint of lemon. Taste is much the same, well balanced and smooth, with a creamy mouthfeel. The ABV makes for easy drinking. It is a somewhat similar and lighter brother to La Fin Du Monde. Aftertaste is wonderfully clean and slightly creamy. Recommended, especially for the price!"

"But, they know what they;re doing up there."
"Light bodied with average carbonation. Smooth and very easy to drink. This is a great example of the Witbier style, and another winner from Unibroue. This would be a great beer to drink on a warm summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If you are going to buy a bottle from Unibroue, get a bottle of Terrible. You won't be sorry. I will say, if you are new to craft beer, then you need to start with a beer like this. Not this particular bottle, but a beer that is light and has subtle flavors like the coriander and the orange zest. I will stick with my Belgian darks!"
"Overall, a nice example of the style, but downgraded somewhat due to the price. Witbiers of comparable quality can be found at lower prices than the $10.99 I paid for a 4-pack."

""
""
""
"O: Very refreshing easydrinking. Unibroue quality"
""
"O: A rather refreshing beer and its quiet good but nothing astounding. Its pleasing and decent but nothing that stood out to me. I have 2 left and a 750ml as well so I'm a happy camper. I might buy it again but I would take other beers over it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A good example of a domestic Belgian Wit. Not overdone on the spices but could use a little more flavor."
""
""
""
"Really good example of its style. The flavor didn't seem terribly pronounced to me, but it was pleasant (if subdued) tasting. Ridiculously drinkable. I remember seeing a travel show at one point where they said that the proper way to drink a white beer was in three gulps. Who knows if it was a crock or not but it always seemed beyond my beer drinking abilities (I'm not a chugger); however, I could totally see drinking this beer that way."

"O: I love this beer. I love (almost) everything Unibroue makes. But what really makes this shine for me is that it's really the only sessionable beer they make. Yes, Trois Pistoles or La Fin du Monde are better beers, but you can't drink them all night at 9%. Also, I'm seriously not a fan of the Witbier style and the fact that I enjoy this so much is a credit to them."
"One of the better witbiers out there- Unibroue is a great brewery."
""
""

""

"Loads of pear... a Canadian benchmark that should appeal to many!"
"as my tastes get a bit more refined from trying all of these lagers and ales, and reviewing them, I find that this brewer in particular has some very creative offerings, ranging from very heavy almost heartburn causing tripel ,to this session worth wiess. i would reccommend this to any fans of wiess. and this brewer. they have a certain something that carries over through different styles, but is always complex, and obviously held to a very high standard of quality. not something i would drink every day, but definatly not one to miss, aside from hoegaarden, which is about on par in quality in my opinion, one of the best wheat beers available."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"While this isn't my favorite Unibroue offerring, it's still enjoyable. Very easy drinking, sessionable beer. More complexity than a lot of witbiers, which isn't surprising considering the brewery. I could easily drink this often, although it might be a bit more satisfying in the summer months. This went down fast, so it's clear i enjoyed the taste. Good job."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, kick ass. I am partial to darker brew, but to review in accordance with the style I think it was spot on. That being said, I still really enjoy it and will pick one up next time the temp rises. And honestly when compared to blue moon i think it blows it away...but thats just me."
""
""
""
"O: Solid. Not something I'd seek out, but good especially when looking for something refreshing. Not one of Unibroue's best, but that is hardly a knock on this beer considering the brewery's lineup."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was not impressed by the taste of this beer. Its very watery, and not very complex. Its easy to drink, and a nice mouthfeel, but nothing I would want to get again in particular."
""
""
"O - I've had Blanche de Chambly often over the past 5 or so years and it deserved a review long ago. This was one of the first Unibroue beers I picked up and one I would recommend to anyone. It's a good representation of the Belgian witbier style and probably the best coming from North America. Canadian craft breweries are often overlooked, but without question Unibroue is one that are excellent at what they do. Blanche De Chambly is a very good beer in an often under done style considering its Belgian. This is a worthy ale in the warm months and fairly easy to require anywhere. It's worth the purchase for anyone who appreciates class beer."
""
""
""
"O - This is a traditional beer that has traits of a belgian ale. Again, the yeast used adds a unique quality. I like coming back to Unibroue for their European vibe on craft brewing in North America."
""
""
""
""
"The best Belgian wit I've ever had. Even blows the ones directly from Belgium, right out of the water. Poured into a glass mug, slowly and surely, shook the remaining 3/4 and added all yeast and sediment into the glass. Frothy, milky head that stayed all the way throughout the drinking of this dynamite beer. Smells of fresh oranges, coriander and I get a hint of the sweet Belgian yeast as well. Lacing is super intense, almost looks like I bathed this one in a bubble bath. I would say that this is one of those beers that you should point someone to who is looking for accurate depictions on the Belgian wit style. The BJCP folks out there should study this one and disregard lesser versions like Hoegaarden that, while good, just don't stand out like this great Quebec brew. Unibroue is a force to be reckoned with and it makes an Alberta guy like me happy that this one came without the whining and crying that usually comes along with most things Quebecois!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"750 ml caged and corked bottle, best before 10-20-13. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a cloudy straw gold color with about an inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like wheat, lemon peel, coriander, and some cloves. It tastes like wheat, lemon and orange peel, coriander, apricots, and a bit of peppery spice. The finish is sweet and fruity. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's crisp and refreshing and is also well carbonated. It would be even better on a hot day instead of on a kinda cold January day! I think this is a good brew, it's definitely worth trying. $6.49 a bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Unique, well balanced and a solid representation of the style. I have grown fond of Wits due to their easy drinkability paired with that refreshing finish. Not the best out of this crew, but something that contends with some of the top notch in the style."
""
""
""
""

"Overall- A nice example of a wit. It is smooth with good flavor and a quite nice feel."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Overall, this is a pretty good beer, I guess I was expecting more. I don't know, but it's probably the wrong reason for this beer, its so crisp, airy, light and refreshing, It's probably better to have this guy during the warmer months, not colder. It's also pretty expensive for what it is, four double the price on a standard 355ml bottle, I' really expect something for that price tag to knock my socks off, and well.. my socks are still on. It's still pretty good, just over priced. Still recommend it."
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy lemon yellow color with a huge bubbly white head that quickly dissipates to a cap on top. Smells of lemon and citrus with a earthy herbal and yeasty aroma. The flavor is light and a bit tart with a lemony earthy herbal flavor with a touch of yeasty funk. Medium to light body with a spirited level of carbonation and a lightly tart and bubbly mouthfeel. I'm typically not a big fan of witbier, hence the reason I've passed over this beer for years. This is actually a pretty decent beer, I could see this as a future summer beer for me."

"O: When I saw the ""Unibroue"" label, I knew from my past experience that this would probably be good -- and it was. Unibroue is coming close to joining Samuel Smith's as my favorite brand. There's no doubt I'll go back for more of this excellent Witbier (better than some Belgian versions I've had), and seek out others from their product line."

"One of the most enjoyable beers for a summer on the patio. Light, citrus-y flavor and a smooth finish. The head is not overly foamy, can be well poured into a tall beer glass. Very opaque and cloudy appearance, not overly desirable to look at but the taste more than makes up for it."
""
""
"Pours a murky yellow with a fizzy off-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, citrus fruit, and some yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with a nice spice finish after each sip. This beer has a high level of carbonation with a crisp and prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Overall it's decent, wouldn't be chomping at the bit to try it again."
""
""
""
"Single finger head on a golden with amber hues hazy body. Aroma is light and us typical wheat with hints of lemon and grains. Flavor is milky and creamy with lemon pepper zest, corriander and hints of lemon juice. Light to medium body and high carbonation. Nice mouthfeel for the style. Highly drinkable and full flavored not seeming watered down."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 10/20/2013. Pours very hazy golden straw color with a nice fluffy 2-3 finger white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of lemon, orange peel, coriander, clove, pepper, wheat, light banana, earth, herbal, and yeast spices. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good complexity and strength; very pleasant. Taste of lemon, orange zest, wheat, coriander, pepper, clove, light banana, earth, herbal, bread, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of citrus, pepper, clove, wheat, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Very nice amount of flavor with good balance and complexity. Fairly high carbonation and medium body; with a very crisp and slightly prickly mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is well hidden with pretty much zero warming noticed after the finish as expected. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian Witbier! Very nice flavor complexity and balance; and extremely smooth to drink. Really enjoyed this one."
""
"The final verdict: Good summer beer, I will be sure to enjoy a few more of these during the summer. Get this beer, a grill, some lemon-pepper chicken, and mild Italian sausage. That sounds like the perfect combination for me."
""
""
""
"Great execution, if mild, even for the style."
""
""
""
""
"Worth a try for fans of the style. I wasn't initially in love with this beer, but its refreshing and might convert me. Nice character and balance to it. Adding the sediment yeast brings a great complexity."
""
""
""
"O-A nice easy drinking witbier but not top notch."
""
"Overall - Certainly recommended to everyone, especially if you are a witbier fan. I would buy and drink this again no doubt, a perfect beer for a nice warm summer evening on the deck."
""
""
"Poured from a 75cl bottle into a tulip flute hybrid, best by date of 12/21/13. This pours a slightly hazy pale yellow color with a short lived but large white head. The smells are of fruity yeast esters, banana and oranges. The feel is medium to lighter. The taste is okay a little wheat, some banana but they're light."
""
"Final Grade: 3.92, a B+. It seems a crime that Blanche de Chambly is the only Unibroue offering always available at the LCBO - these guys just flat out make great beer, and this wit is certainly no exception to that fact, but more Unibroues would be appreciated. This is at least as good as Hoegaarden, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of that beer (or the style in general). Definitely worth a shot."

"Mouthfeel and overall - Very sour on the tongue when the beer first hits it. Medium bodied all-in-all. Tingles the tongue and inside of the cheeks."

"O: Refreshing is the key word here. A simple and well-balanced Witbier."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"To this point in my experience, Blanche de Chambly is a champion among witbiers from a champion among breweries."
"O: Delicious and refreshing a definate favorite for the summer. Complex and well balanced. I highly recommend."
""
""
"O/D-A nice Wit. Pretty easy to drink with fresh and bright flavors. Solid yet unspectacular."
""
""
""
"O- What is there to say that hasn't been said about Unibroue. They brew good beers and that's about it. This is sadly the only one readily available at the LCBO now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Decidedly earthy and light on the ""Americanized"" spice profile, Blanche de Chambly is well-balanced and much more akin to what the early examples of a true Belgian wit would have been. I find the heavy carbonation, while helping this beer in part, distracts from the otherwise desirable soft wheat profile."
"O: Very easy to drink and enjoy with seafood or basic summer salads. The active carbonation and tangy flavour make for an incredibly refreshing brew. Simple and very easy to drink - great brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Quaffable and refreshing... A very nice beer... Undoubtedly one of my favorite Unibroue offerings... Whille note a seasonal offering, this is a terrific spring or summer beer with lots of sophistication and complexity... I will have no problem working through the half case that I just invested in..."
""
"Overall: A great buy especially considering the price and so.much that you get for it. Salud."

"Overalll: unique and enjoyable French-Canadian Witbier. Fruity without being particularly sweet."

"Overall this is a very enjoyable witbier. Love the belgian overtones in it. Another great beer from Unibroue."
""

"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured a slightly hazy golden yellow with a two finger white head that subsided to half a finger very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, spices, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, fruit, and spices. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a fairly decent brew. For the style this was a great representation, but I just wish they would have gotten a little crazy with it to add some more complexity to it. It was quite refreshing, but I just wanted it to challenge my palate a little more if I am honest. A great summer brew to enjoy while out in the sunshine though without a doubt."
""
""
""
"The feel of this beer is medium to light with some nice wheat feel that makes this an easy drinker. It goes down easy and has an easy feel that makes you come for more."

"I poured this into a goblet and noticed the thick head that formed and the golden straw color of the ale. On the nose this beer is very fruity/citrus-like in aroma which is to be expected of a beer of this style, but it had a crispness to it that was most appealing. On the first taste it was again what one would expect from a witbier..citrusy..especially to me a tangrine-like essence that was most refreshing. This beer is smooth, velvety smooth likely due to the 5% ABV, but I think also to the excellence of the brewing...just very well crafted. The best of the Unibroue range....perhaps not, but it is still an excellent brew that anyone would enjoy on a warm late spring day. As a session beer this would be one of my top choices..easy drinking, full of flavor, and high enough of an abv to have character but not so high as to be obnoxious after a few glasses."
""
"O- It's a great beer, but not the best by unibroue."
"Overall â€“ not a terribly intriguing beer to taste, but good-tasting still, and not dull either."

"This would go great with BBQ."
""
"Nicely tart and fresh nose, tastes even better. Excellent balance of tart/tangy/sweetwith some husky grain and subtle spicing in the background. Rather surprisingly thickish, but more than enough carbonation to keep things lively. Nice brew here."
"Bottom line: A very enjoyable beer for those who enjoy the style as it does not try to impose the flavor like traditional North American wheat beers."
""
"D: An excellent witbier that's tasty, refreshing, and eminently drinkable. It's a shame it hasn't been around in 750 mL bottles for a while."

"Poured from a 750mL bottle. Cloudy yellow brew, very nice head with a pretty good retention. The smell is amazing, mostly citrus notes with strong yeast aromas, very powderish. Taste is very good and confirms the aromas. For me, the major downfall is the pretty high carbonation. Otherwise, it's an excellence brew, full of aromas and very refreshing!"

"Hazy pale blonde, one finger of white head, light lace. Smell is yeatsy with spice, coriander, spicy malt, orange and citrus, on the second pint there was some light funk. Taste is yeasty and spicy, orange, citrus, wheaty, lightly tart and dry in the finish. Med-high carb, medium body, good feel. Solid easy drinking brew, high quality and quite nice."

"Overall - I still go by what I said for Unibroue, they don't make bad beers, but I wasn't as impressed with this beer. It felt like a simple witbier, their was no wow factor that I was expecting."
"Drink - Was happy to try this one on tap. It's one of the better wits available in my area and I'd drink it again anytime."
"Tastes like rainwater on a flower-scented evening. Spicy harvest taste. If only some brewer would give a pumpkin ale this kind of delicate spicing. Fragrant with a pleasing taste of sweet malt. Nice watery but carbonated mouthfeel. This seems totally typical of the Wit style."
"I enjoy trying Wits and seeing how they vary from brewery to brewery. A good take on the style and while not my favorite I found no flaws in it and wouldn't hesitate trying it on tap."
"The beer is completely transparent and appears a light yellow color. The head is smaller than expected, leaving some sparse lacing on the glass. The aroma brings apples, coriander, with a touch of lemon. Spiced green apples in the flavor. Suitable for autumn. Low carbonation and smooth on the palate, with minimal alcohol presence. The body is quite thin. A decent example of the style."
"Simply one of my favorites beers, it poors a great pale golden color, makes a lot of brew, smells fresh and fruits, the taste is mild, calm, with some little fruit aromas, the mouthfeel is perfect. This is, to me, the perfect beer to drink while relaxing, it really worths the try."
"O: Not bad, but not great either. I much prefer ephemere apples to this, or even la fin du monde, maudite, or any of the other unibroue styles."
"This is decent stuff. Not impressive, but definitely solid. Would I get it over other Unibroue beers? Probably not, but I sure do love that brewery."
"Poured a bright gold color with two fingers of head. Foam sticks around a bit, nice lacing on the glass to the end. Light smell, more malt than hop and very pleasant. The taste is nice and light with no bitterness or bite. This beer was gone before I knew it. True to the style, it takes no risks but delivers a highly drinkable brew."
"Just an all around excellent Wit. I think this is my favorite Unibroue offering. Overall, this is very simple, but so enjoyable. I can not recommend this enough."
"O- A really well developed balnced wit. On the shortlist of my favorites in the style. Really love how Unibroue gets depth of flavor, yet still balance in their beers."
"A cloudy pale yellow with a nice large lasting white head on the pour. Aroma and Taste is a nice citrusy orange peel, some banana, pears and sweet ripe fruit bouquet, with some light wheat, malt and tartness. A nice light to med body with moderate carbonation and a nice clean crisp mouth feel. Finish sweet ripe fruit, citrusy orange peel, banana with some light malt and fruity tartness. Overall a very nice fruity and flavorful brew"
"I'll admit that I am a big fan of Unibroue beers. I picked up this bottle out of my fridge simply because I wanted something light that I can count it. I wasn't even planning on reviewing it (the mood just wasn't there). But after the first sip, I figured that I do need to record a note about it."
"Overall: This is a good beer, but not what i expected. This beer leans more towards the fruit end of this style not the spicing or heavy wheat."
"I'm new to beer, so I'm no pro at reviewing beer yet. I would agree that It was overall a nice beer to drink. The smell was good had a very pleasant aroma, I found the taste to be average, the carbonation brought a new interesting feel to the beer. It was dark lagers that drew me into the world of "" beer", so even though I don't particularly like lighter beer's this white beer from Quebec was good. Hope you get a chance to try. Sorry about my review, I did my best!!"
"D - Decent witbier. Extremely drinkable and refreshing. Every beer I've sampled so far from Unibroue has been impressive."
"O - Huge disappointment. It isn't even close to comparing to Allagash or Hoegaarden. A boring, middle-of-the-road beer from a brewery that is capable of so much more."
"Overall: A very good take on a witbier. Everything is well balanced and their is plenty of flavor in this lighter bodied brew."
"Overall, this is a refreshing summer beer. While it probably isn't the best offering from Unibroue, it is a nice beer is reasonably priced in Canada."
"O â€“ Bright and clean. Itâ€™s missing a little depth, but the flavors that are there are well integrated and delicious."
"This one impressed me enough that now I would be willing to pay full price for a fresh bottle."
"Hazy yellow with a nice white head of tightly compacted bubbles. Decent retention that leaves a thin film with lively bubbles on top. Light coriander, lemon and a touch of orange on the nose. Also a bit of soft wheat in the background. Lighter on the palate than many Witbiers I have had, but it has a nice dry finish and a bit of spice, more of a lemon finish for me than orange peel. Mouthfeel is pretty light but it has a beautiful fine carbonation that only comes from bottle conditioning. Overall this is a really nice beer, for me I tend to like a little richer and bigger Wit (something like St. Bernardus which is one of my favorites) but does not mean that the lightness is a fault in this beer. This is a very well made, great summer beer and like the rest of the Unibroue beers, priced very well for a 750 of Belgian style bottle conditioned beer."
"O - really quite good; don't know why I don't drink this more often..?"
"Overall: Probably my favorite Canadian produced wheat beer."
"O- My favorite witbier right now. Perfect for the summer, not too heavy and doesn't just sit in you as though you chugged rye bread."
"Overall - A good example of this style. Refreshing, light and yet flavorful and complex. Nothing to blow you away but next time I want a witbier, I would gladly go for this."
"D - Great beer in a style with many mediocre representations. I'd take another one anytime."
"O-Overall this is a decent brew. Doesn't really set itself apart from other Witbiers. Seems interchangeable with the other beers of its style. Again, not bad, but nothing special."
"Enjoyable, full of flavor without being overpowering, and fairly low ABV. Bottle conditioning is a plus."
"O: While I suppose Blanche de Chambly is a good representative of the witbier style, it is also my least favourite Unibroue so far. Lackluster and vaguely boring, but never unpleasant. Recommended if you are keen on the style, otherwise not one with which to bother."
"Overall: Maybe it's all the imperial stouts that I've been having lately or something. This one just didn't seem to be the same beer that I remembered from trying before. Still very drinkable, but more in a Bud Light Golden Wheat than a Hoegaarden kind of way. The smell is still fantastic, but the flavor profile came across as watery. Definitely one for the summer, and one that I'll have again."
"This beer poured out as a nice looking hazy golden color. The head was pretty big with a nice white sticky lacing. The smell of the beer was of fresh cut citrus fruits and some bread yeast. The taste was sweet and lively from the orange and lemon flavors coursing through it. The mouthfeel was medium bodied. Overall this beer is quite enjoyable."
"Overall, this was a very refreshing brew."
"O- very light and drinkable...so many other witbiers at 1/2 the price makes this not a go to for the summer season"
"Smell is grassy and mild hop citrus. Taste is yeasty and very smooth aftertaste that settles on the palate. Another great from unibroue. I haven't tried many whites but this is certainly the most complex just so much in the taste, citrus grassy peppery and cloves."
"I'm enjoying my trip down Unibroue memory lane, and hopefully this stop won't be the start of any disappointment. It pours a hazy golden orange topped by plenty of white foam. The nose comprises orange zest, light lemon zest, coriander, light black pepper, and a light twinge of what seems like green apple. The taste holds notes of wheat, orange zest, coriander, clove, black pepper, nutmeg, and, again, a very light prick of green apple. The spicy notes really set this brew apart from its wit compatriots. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a very enjoyable wit from those masters of brewing from the Great White North."
"O~ I would definitely buy this again, a great tasting witbier."
"D: Overall, it was one of the better witbiers I've tried. It is a fine example of the style with its high carbonation and strong wheat components. It also provides a unique twist with the sweetness added."
"Taste is similarly peppery, with accents of clove, pepper, and a little heat. A solid Belgian-style wit beer. Not outstanding, but certainly session-worthy."
"Overall- Great ale! I haven't been able to find any cons with the beers from Unibroue and this is awesome! As of now, this is one of my top 5 breweries! This is very refreshing and without a doubt will be a favorite this summer with a lot of my friends liking wheat and hefeweizen styles."
"M - Nice, bright carbonation that I expect for a wheat beer. Slightly creamy, but thin and quite drinkable. Good summer beer."
"O: Really a good beer for what it is: A light, summer beer. I probably wouldn't seek it out, because I don't feel that it's worth what you'll pay for it. That being said, it is a good beer."
"Blanche De Chambly was a pale white-yellow color and hazy. It had a white head with decent retention and minimal lacing. The smell was yeast, spice and a bit fruity. The taste was yeast and light malt upfront with some peppery spice coming through towards the finish. The finish was dry and peppery. The mouthfeel was good with a medium body and medium-high carbonation. Overall it is an above average Witbier, but not one that I am likely to go back to."
"O- A very good witbier, this is really becoming one of my favorite styles, and this is a good example of one. Refreshing and complex, great beer in the summer months. Out of the four pack I purchased one of them was a little bit watery, but the other three were really good."
"One of my favorite examples of the Belgian Wit category-great balance of orange and coriander. Has more citrus character than most examples, which I like. Yummy."
"overall a very refreshing beer. would be very nice almost straight out of the fridge in the summer. not very complex, not a sipping beer, but a good gulping food beer"
"This beer poured a hazy bright yellow color, with a lively white head. The smell is heavy with wheat, and a bit of a citrus like lemon. The taste is strong, nice wheat charchter, and there is a nice spiceness to it, but finishes very clean. Very good carbonation and surprsing strong flavor from a Witbier, very nice on a hot summers day. Overall a very very good witbier."
"Overall a tasty and refreshing Belgian style. Cleaner than most."
"O: I was in the mood for a Unibroue... and this one delivered."
"O: Interesting... but I don't love it. 3.5"
"I could easily (and happily) drink multiple of these in a sitting, especially with the 5% ABV. Blanche de Chambly would be a great thirst-quencher on a hot day or would pair up nicely with a light salad."
"O - For me, this is a disappointment. I really like this style and was hoping for a bit more of a brewery of this quality and reputation. This doesn't even approach Belgian examples or Allagash White (my benchmark beer for the style)"
"D/O - Darn near perfect... best in its class of witbiers in my honest opinion. 5% this is something you could sink yourself in and just take gulps and gulps and never get tired of it."
"O: It is a good offering from Unibroue. Very very drinkable, quite cheap (cheaper than hoeggarden here) and solid tasting. Nothing really bad but just expected more from Unibroue."
"Overall, a good beer with refreshing qualities."
"Over priced? Yes. Good? Not really. A solid beer for the style but the pricing is just wrong considering how little is going on here."
"D: A nice wit that stands above the standard assembly line product in Canada."
"An exceptional witbier, and a definite favorite of mine."
"Drinkability / Overall: A very nice brew - light but full of flavor and I could easily have another one or two. Went well with a meal (Asian-style white fish and broccoli over rice) and I could have this all by itself. Very good beer."
"I'd love to have another bottle of this with some food. I think it would go with just about anything. It's drinkable without the food, but food would put it over the top."
"A good effort by Unibroue on this wit. At 5%ABV it's very drinkable, a beer I would definitely like for a summer afternoon session by the pool!"
"Still a damned fine witbier, a great brew to have around the house during the summer. At 5%, having several buckets of this at a time would not be a challenge."
"D: Not my favorite style but from ones i've had before this one isn't as good. It's way too light."
"D: great witbeer and would be awesome for warm summer days grilling and general outside sitting."
"Poured the beer into a glass. Poured very easy with a decent amount of head. The beer looks like an unfiltered wheat ale. Smells like a very sweet beer, smells like a lot of fruit. Tastes very watery and there isn't any of the sweetness I expected. The finish is smooth and leaves your mouth feeling quenched. A gritty beer for the feel. Overall, I would suggest trying this beer. I would like this beer if I was eating sea food. Cheers."
"Needless to say, I went on to other beers as I was not as impressed with this beer as I hoped I would be."
"D: A great example of one of the most bastardized styles out there. Blue Moon et al give it a bad name. This stuff is the real deal. Definitely worth a shot for anyone who is looking to rekindle their faith in this style."
"D: Mild, unspectacular taste and unnecessarily high carbonation will probably prevent me from buying this one again. Other offerings from Unibroue much preferred."
"For some reason every Unibroue I taste I am not too impressed with them and the same can be said of the Blanche De Chambly, but this is still a very decent beer."
"M: Pretty good. While being unfiltered in nature it didnt feel as if I was drinking sediment. The after taste lingered but just as the taste, it was nice and citrusy."
"T: Very smooth and drinkable and one of the better wits out there. Nice citrus flavor with a bit of pepper thrown in. Pretty good beer from Unibroue."
"Head of less than a finger atop a beer which color matches a 5 on the SRM beer color chart. No lace. Smells sweet, with a flower scent, some smell of fruit. Taste is fruity, there are traces of raspberry, cherry, honey, and malt. Not a lot of body or character in my mouth, but better than water. With this unique flavor, I would not mind having another."
"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass per the labels instructions. The beer pours a hazy and bubbly straw-gold coloring with a thin, white, airy head that recedes after a few minutes. Aromas of slight citrus, wheat/grain/cereal, and earthy notes. The beer has a spiced sweetness to it, mostly coriander, but also some hints of cinnamon. The spices do well riding the light and crisp body and the mellow malty flavors. The beer has a spiced aftertaste, with a smooth and clean finish. There is a slight linger to the finish with hints of the spices and sour tinge, but very mild. This beer is very light in body, and surprisingly the flavors are a bit on the light side, as well."
"This beer was a pleasant surprise, definitely worth paying extra for over cheaper alternatives of this style"
"D- unibroue is the undisputed north american king of belgian styled beers. this is no exception. check this one out if youre a fan of the style. it will not disappoint."
"D: I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but this wasn't a terribly good witbier (or beer in general)."
"Notes - I'm not sure how true-to-style this witbier is because of its slightly sweet nature. As a beer in general, though, it's outstanding: I would recommend it to any wheat beer fan. On the other hand, it's kind of pricey for only 5% ABV so it won't be an ""everyday"" beer."
"D- Nice wheat beer, I'll have to come back to this one in July."
"Pours a decent golden wheat with a bit of initial (quickly fading) head and no lacing. Nice scent, crisp and bright with a huge clove aroma. Nice taste, although it loses the general wheat 'crispness' through a lot of additional flavors, mostly a peppery and clove spiciness. Goes down alright, with some spicy roughness."
"D- Solid belgian white and lots of spice and good nose"
"D: great summer beer! great 4 pack to grab to share with newbies. check this nice unibroue offering out!"
"D - One of my favourites and the best go-to beer if it's available on tap. A great offering from Unibroue and highly recommended to any witbier fan. A great example of the style."
"Nice for the style."
"Overall not a bad beer but not one that I see fitting with the style just right. Darker in color, heavier in body, and lacking some of the depth that the great ones posess."
"D - Refreshing and easy to drink with good flavor...a very nice Wit"
"Overall, not a bad Witbier. But by now I'm convinced that any beer style from Unibroue would be good. If you want something light and flavorful, pick this up."
"D - Huge drinkability. Definate session beer in the summer. Considering it's been snowing nonstop this wasn't exactly the beer for the weather but a very drinkable beer that was no problem to get through and made me want another."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth, easy to go down, drinkable beer accompanied with good flavours."
"D - Very high. I can drink plenty of these. It is very smooth."
"I like this beer a lot. Also I should add that this a tough category ratings wise, as there are so many good witbiers. The high scores for this one from me are saying a lot."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"*Sorry for the lack of style, this is my first review*"
"This is a pretty solid beer. Not a very standard wit, but I really enjoyed this one. The complex malt flavors really make this a unique and interesting drink. If I see this one around again I'll be sure to pick more up. Not sure if I could go through a whole case next summer, but this would be a great barbecue beer."
"750 ml bottle. Pours Champaign like - golden with a large white head and lovely carbonation. Aroma of yeast, pear, banana and sweet malt. Light, slightly crisp body. Flavor of yeast, creamy wheat and fruit (pear, banana and some apple). Light, refreshing brew."
"This is a great wit, even two years after bottling. I'll be on the lookout for something super fresh, I'm sure it's top-notch then."
"D- i could drink this all night if i had them. great flavour, and the dry finish makes another sip irresistible. very nice."
"Drinkabilty - Nothing special, easy to drink, good summer beer. Theres no unquie flavor, and as usual, my motto is, if you need to put something into a beer to make it good, then its not worth drinking in the first place."
"This is one of the rare occasions where I think a beer stands well on its own, but doesn't quite meet the criteria for the style. Despite being cited as an example of style from BJCP, this beer doesn't fall in line with the rest in terms of balance of flavors."
"Drinkability - solid tap beer that will make for a good session beer."
"Pours a hazy gold. Head dies quickly into almost nothingness. Smells great - citrus, malt, and spice. Some banana. I'm pretty impressed with the taste, they did a great job on this one - light bodied and refreshing. Very drinkable. I still prefer Allagash White but this is up there with Hoegaarden."
"Overall: Good beer overall. Not my favorite witbier, but it's worth a try. Another solid offering from Unibroue."
"The body is light, crisp and bubbly. Very pleasing and easy to drink."
"Will purchase again."
"D - Falls alittle short of the Hoegaarde which has to be one of the best mass production beers available."
"Of the two wits I had today this one had the more distinctive aroma. Poured the classic hazy golden with rocky white head. With this one the coriander knocked me square in the olfactory gland. Loved it. Seems like this one would go great with a curry dish of some kind so that's what I'm making for dinner. The flavor of wheat, citrus, coriander was there as well. Overall like this beer quite a bit but find it not as subtly cool as the St. Bernardus was. More one note here and less complexity."
"Pours a cloudy light yellow-grain color with some nice haze and a bit of a white head with some lacing. The nose brings some coriander, orange, light wheat, and a bit of floral/earth characteristics. The taste is really light with a bit of wheat and citrus. Nice, light body with good carbonation and drinks very well. Not as good as their higher-strength Belgian offerings, but not a bad brew."
"Lacks intensity of some others, but still very solid for the style. I'd have this again, and easily one of the preferred Wits I'd give to someone to try."
"Enjoyable beer and complex enough to keep you thinking. Nicely done."
"This is a solid wit in my opinion. It's very drinkable, very true to style, and just delicious. Unibroue scores again."
"Poured into a goblet. Pours am orange amber with a nice fluffy white head. Great citrus, sweet, fruity aroma. Overall it has a nice crisp bite amd is really refreshing and drinkable. Awesome summer beer."
"It's a good example of the witbier style. Compared to a similar style, like a hefeweizen or a weissbier, I like it more than a KÃ¶nig Ludwig WeiÃŸbier, but not as much as a Weihenstephaner."
"D: Not a bad Wit, but oddly not as good as I was expecting from Unibroue.... The ABV is good and it is very drinkable."
"Value was great for 750ml paid 3.99, by far the Cheapest Unibroue I've seen. Well worth the price."
"Drinkability- Drinkability is good, but would be higher if this beer was a little bit less sweet. The sweetness of this beer makes you slow down a little."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and is also quite refreshing."
"Notes: Another great beer by Unibroue. This is one of the better witbiers I've had. Some can be a bit all over the place and out of control, but this one is tight and nicely done."
"T- Very nice caramel and apple taste. Kind of dry. It has a rye taste or rice, I was a bit drunk at this point. Slight bitter in the back of the mouth."
"From the 25-26 fl. oz. corked bottle dated 12-16-11. Sampled on September 19, 2010. It pours a golden-pale yellow with about two inches of foamy, white head. It is not as cloudy as I expected for a bottle fermented ale. The aroma espouses a little wheat, spice, and thin hops. Subtle is the catch phrase for that. The wheat is not as prevalent in the taste as I would expect but it is offset nicely with a tart citrus element and a little hops at the end."
"D- A good light drink. Like many of Unibroue's other offerings in style, but lighter. I enjoy it, and they did a good job on it, but it didn't stand out as much as I'd like it to. Still a solid choice which I'd never refuse. It would be a great drink for people unfamiliar with the style to show to get their foot through the door."
"Little head & a bit of lacing, though not much were evident. The aroma is not as strong of coriander, citrus and earthiness as I remember it, but it was there and enjoyable. The body seems lighter and should be a bit thicker, and the carbonation was much lower than I want it (and recollect it). Nevertheless an excellent wit to drink."
"No but seriously, it's a good beer."
"Pours a hazy orangish yellow color with a thick frothy white head which gives way to some nice lacing. The aroma is of light green fruits and citrus along with some spice notes. The taste is of citrus with a slight spice note, there are also notes of green fruits and corriander present. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated but lacking. The drinkability is very good, it is smooth and easy to drink. The taste is also well balanced not the biggest but very crisp and clean. Overall this could easily be a session beer."
"A little thin mouthfeel but good carbonation. Good drinkability but I find witbiers tend to get a little weird after a few of them. I would have to have several of these in a row to know if it avoids this."
"D: Dangerously drinkable!"
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied, but feels very thick for the style. Carbonation is moderate overall. Drinkability is decent, it had some good flavors to it but falls short of some of the better ones of the style. The citrus might have been a little bit overdone for me. Still a decent beer overall though."
"Pours a cloudy, creamsicle-orange color with a big white head that fades slowly to a thin cap with little lacing. The aroma is a lot like champagne - very dry and yeasty with hints of butter and citrus. The champagne theme carries over to the taste, with a lot of carbonation - crisp and dry. There's some other action mixing in, maybe some slight fruitiness. Hard to pick-up any bitterness over the carbonation. Body is medium for a whit and the finish is fast and clean."
"Notes: Generally disappointing beer from a very capable brewery."
"D - flavourfull and refreshing in both flavour and feel, a nice mix of belgian yeast flavours with citrus wheat beer characteristics, this beer will be a regular session beer for me"
"The excessive spiciness and unpleasant yeast profile make this rather hard to drink, not impressive."
"Pours a cloudy light orange colour with thick white head. Almost no lacing, but head retention was ok. Sweet lemon and banana in the smell with the wheat malt. Flavour has a tinge of tart with the refreshing sweetness. Nice carbonation. Perfect beer for a 30+ degree Toronto evening."
"jd"
"Pale straw gold colored brew, fair amount of haze. Very large pillowy white head topping it off. Sweet malt nose, lemon/citrus and yeast. Light malt front, lots of lemon grass and spice. Just a tiny touch of hops to round it out. Thin mouth and pretty wet. Wits are never my favorite brews, but this is one of the better ones that i've had."
"I will credit to where credit is due on this one. I found it on tap at D's Six Pax and Dogz in Regent Square (around Pittsburgh). I love wheat beers. German wheats were probably the reason I got into beer fanatically...and this one hits my preferences. It looks amazing. Just pure gold, cloudy goodness with a thick head. It smells like a field in the best way possible...lots of banana and yeast aromas. The taste was great. It wasn't a sensory overload of flavors like coriander or lemon/orange peel. It was just a clean finish and was very refreshing. These are light, full or flavor, and easy to drink...the essence of the wheat."
"Wish I had ordered another, very refreshing on tap."
"Surprisingly disappointing wit we have here - in fact I even prefer the ""big names"" like Hoegaarden if given the choice."
"Final Thoughts: Apart from the carbonation there isn't a lot wrong with this offering. This is pretty much what a good wit should taste like. Now granted a little innovation and spin might have improved it a bit, but it also might have also ruined it. If they can get the carbonation into the head, it would be spectacular instead of incredibly good. I'm certainly going to try more from Unibroue after this one."
"Drinkability> Go on then."
"Notes: a good witbier for the price and one of the more balanced interms of sweetness, spiciness, and tartness."
"Clean and crisp citrus flavor. Very light body and would make a great session beer on a hot summer day. Definitely wouldn't mind having a few of these outside with the grill going."
"Not the best beer, yet not the worst"
"D: Ready to move on after one."
"I only ever buy this when there's nothing better available; it's funny to sit down and really analyse my opinion of it. Not as good as I would have thought. Still, it's not terrible. I've just had much better. I'm sure I'll end up drinking this again sometime and will probably throw in the citrus wedge they serve it with; this one could use it."
"D: Very easy to drink and quite good. The high CO2 level may make it a bit filling."
"Drinkability was nearly perfect. I drank this beer more quickly than I should have."
"d- all the flavors are in balance and not overly heavy, definitely a beer I could drink all night long"
"Thanks to @ herrorara and @ cratez for recommending Chancey Smith's in London, Ontario."
"I was a bit worried because this was a twist-top and not pry off, but the top came off with a hiss. The pour was pretty good, but a nice white head that quickly subsided. The beer was a golden yellow, with a bit of haze. The smell was sweet with bready malts and a hint of citrus and baking spice (clove maybe.) The taste was definitely malt dominated with the spice from the wheat and yeast coming in a later and finishing dry with a bit of citrus and earthiness. It definitely is an understated Witbier, but done well with good balance and complexity of flavor. The mouthfeel was light and spritzy, which is exactly what I wanted on a warm summer night. Overall, very drinkable, and I'd enjoyable."
"Drinkability: It would be possible to plow this beer back all day, especially if hot."
"when older it tends to sour a bit and have sort of a hard finish. palate is soft coriandar and orangepeel that becomes a bit harder on the tongue. too hard for the style really. but otherwise a great example. although i have found that quebec is a haven of good craft beer... this brewery seems to have a consistent standard if not longevity in bottle."
"This is a great Belgian style wit."
"A simple but bland witbier."
"D - Went down easy enough, although I would avoid the last of the dregs."
"Drinkability: very drinkable, delicious and easy to drink, I highly recommend it"
"D: very easy with the light flavors and clean mouth feel."
"Overall-- not bad, but not one I'll buy again."
"A refreshing witbier with champagne character that goes more to the fruity side of the style than the spice side."
"Initially very light but as the yeast is added from the bottle it changes to a dark cloudy yellow hue. A fizzy white head goes away with not lacing at all. Aroma is lemony like a magnolia blossom. Banana and clove is muted. Soapy notes are a negative. A pleasant taste but a bit too lemony. The texture is light. A high carbonation is an interesting feature. Very dry finish makes this beer almost like a champagne. Unibroue is one of my favorite breweries, so I am sure that this is exactly the beer they were trying to make. It is unique but not strictly to my liking. Let me try it again in a year and see if my tastes have changed."
"I could drink quite a few of these and not be unhappy."
"It wasn't bad, but it's not my favorite witbier (that's still Walt Wit). I wouldn't be opposed to having this again, but I'll probably only go for this one in a line up of other Unibroues if it's especially hot out that day."
"The drinkability and mouth feel are again slightly better than average take that as you will."
"Nice carbonation in the mouth, slightly bitter in the back. Finishes nicely, a little yeasty a little bready...just OK. Not my favorite from them."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy light brown color with a 1 inch head. Smells of citrus, somewhat sweet. Taste is also a bit sweet, spices and citrus, finishing slightly bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a fine quality beer."
"Cheers to Unibroue for another good one!"
"Overall, this one is average...almost all qualities of it. It is a beer that would actually taste quite good at a very cold temperature on a very hot summer day. Not a beer that deserves further visitation, but one that is easy drinking and good enough to enjoy."
"Notes: This is a very solid wheat beer. It isn't quite as bright and flavorful as some that I have had, but it is a very nice refreshing and easy to drink beer. Very clean flavors."
"Nice refreshing beer for the warm weather months."
"Poured a hazy lemon yellow into its own glass, a tall tulip. Big three finger fine white head that shrinks to a ring. Lots of lacing at first, then none. Lemon and spice smells. Lemon and coriander tastes with a mildly spicy finish. Nicely round and well balanced. Lightly carbonated. Drinkability is very good. Refreshing. Could drink this all day."
"Overall: Overall it was a very good beer. The flavor was sweet, but well balanced. The smell was appetizing and I'd drink another if I had one. I don't drink much white beers, so I was pleasantly surprised when I had this one."
"I thought id revisit this brew as its been a while and sadly when this fine brew is finally gone its gone from our shores forever so anyway it pours a beautiful cloudy golden hue with nice carbonation that leaves a creamy two finger head and a rim of lacing,i must admit i remember the smell of this brew being alot stronger but it exudes aromas of all the usual witbier aromas of corriander,orange peel,belgian yeast and lemons,it has an above average mouthfeel with strong tastes of belgian yeast,corriander,wheat and finishes with a nice lemon zest finish,overall a nice example of the style which would be perfect with a nice piece of snapper and will buy again if its still around."
"Did water somehow get into this beer?? Was it too old??"
"Note- make sure to let this guy (and any other bottle conditioned beer) sit for a little while before drinking. It comes out of the bottle a little bitter and metallic, but the longer you let it sit, the sweeter and smoother it becomes."
"Once again, Unibroue has it figured out; simply the best Belgian Wit brewed outside of Belgium, and frankly on-par with its European predecessors."
"Drinkability - nothing special. It's light bodied and tasty, but it doesn't leave you crying for more."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Very much a traditional Witbier, and Unibroue completely nails it. Maybe a little more sour and musty than some, but that just helps add to its complexity, so that it isn't just a showcase for spice flavors."
"Overall - For a beer 2 years past its prime, it showed no signs of oxidation and the taste is very clean. Mellow flavors and is well balanced. Lovin' it."
"An average, drinkable, refreshing witbier. Not bad...not great."
"Crisp, light/medium body with lots of fitting carbonation."
"D: I think I'm getting bored of Witbiers; I've had some many different variations, that they just seem to be a light, refreshing easy to drink beer, but nothing that really is overly memorable or stands out. This is not a indictment of this specific beer, just a personal opinion of the general style of witbiers. For the style, this one is right on par, however. One of the top three favorites of mine which includes Victory's Whirlwind, and the original Hoegaarden."
"Pours a golden yellow color with plenty of sediment. The large white head quickly fades and leaves a thin ring. The aroma is of citrus, spices, and yeast. The flavor is sweet, fruity, and spicy, with a bit of a citrusy aftertaste. Light bodied with high carbonation. Witbiers aren't my favorite style, but this is a very good example of the style. This would be very refreshing on a hot summer day."
"Outstanding beer. Will definitely be seeking this one out again."
"Unibroue can always be counted on to make big exciting Belgian style ales. This offering, one of their first I think, is a really finely balanced and delicate example of a light and refreshing style. It almost seems like a departure from their bigger offerings we are familiar with, but in fact it shows the exact same attention to detail and excellence as almost everything they produce."
"O: An over-carbonated and poor looking Wit, yet, completely amazing. Drink this."
"Cheers."
"D: This isn't my favorite wit, but still highly drinkable and well crafted."
"So the wonderful thing about this beer blog is I have people recommend beers to me that I would never think to try otherwise. Well this was a recommendation, and I have avoided this brewery's beers for a while since I thought the art work was odd and almost ""Magic the Gathering-esque"". Well like that horrible waste of a time card game I found myself a tad bit interested in this brewery. Also like the card game I found it a bad move, and a waste of time. The beer wasn't anything special. It had some really weak head that disappeared FAST, the odor was really good, and the taste...well it was just overall too sweet. Almost over-powering. I'll give the brewery another try, but if it ends up with the same review I'm just going to ""Blame Canada"" just like they did on South Park."
"D: I chose to pour some of the yeasts in the glass, I think unibroue has tasty yeast, but can be over powering and have ruined some of their beers by pouring them in. I find this style beer to be drinkable in the summer soaking up the rays, this one is above average for drinkability on wit beers the spice is toned down from others i have had making drinkable and not over powering."
"D - I would have the high ABV beers again but this one seems a miss. Like the best lager I ever had."
"The nose was a light orange peel with the typical yeasty belgian smell. The taste was spicy with a lemon peel taste to it. It was well carbonated and the bubbles were rising throughout the drink. Overall a good example and well executed wit."
"Perfect as an aperitive. I would love to also try this with goat cheese or maybe raw shellfish in the future."
"This beer is good. It is not my favorite, and no it does not taste like the wonderful Fin du Monde. Nice head, the color is decent. I would drink it again since I have the Blanche de Chambly glass set at home.--- I would recommend this to a friend, but would recommend Fin du Monde before!"
"I didn't have any expectations for the Blanche De Chambly. It turned out to be a very good buy. The beer seemed to smell very similar to Blue Moon. It pours a pale yellow, almost cloudy. The taste is similar to Blue Moon as well (more Blue Moon from the bottle, not on-tap). There is a little bitterness in the aftertaste. Its a very ""bubbly"" beer, great deal of carbonation it seems. Chambly is a decent witbier. I would drink it again."
"Very drinkable, would make for a popular, refreshing summer brew..."
"Might've been better a bit more chilled."
"Will purchase a newer beer and re-review."
"Drinkability: Not my preference for witbiers, this one overall comes across a slightly one dimensional. I like the candy-sweet lemon taste, but it is quickly overcome by a singular coriander taste. However, this witbier is more session-able than others. Ultimately, it's a solid beer and good general example of the style, but not a paradigm, as it lacks that ""wow"" factor we all look for."
"D- A very solid Wit that I could see myself picking up again."
"From Unibroue, I guess I figured it out would be better than it was."
"This is a good sessionable witbier. Its not the best witbier I have had, but it was a very good and is equal to say a Hoegaarden. Allagash has been the best so far."
"D: This is perfect refresher on a warm day. It's not bad in the dead of winter either. A very nice Wit."
"D: Boy, this would be great on a hot day. Unfortunately, its about 35 degrees but still good nonetheless. Could be come cloyingly sweet"
"Drinkability: excellent on summer day and also year round"
"Pours a clear, pale yellow color. One inch head of a white color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of yeast, spice (clove), tart malt, slight sweet malt, and a hint of hops. Fits the style of a Witbier. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, slight sweet malt, tart malt, citrus, and slight spice. Overall, a good blend, body, and complexity - though, the high carbonation hurts the drinkability."
"Drinkability: A good beer for the summer or in general, the low alcohol content and smooth refreshing taste makes this beer a must try."
"Taste, confirms, this is like some twisted incarnation of what would happen if DFH made some fancy pants Newcastle brown ale with currant and eggplant harvested from the 3rd moon of Jupiter (i.e. weird for the sake of being weird). Just too much going on, and I realize its a classic, but just not enjoyable for me, in any sense beyond looking at and smelling it."
"Drinkability: It's smooth and not too heavy making for very good drinkability. Definitely a must try for anyone who likes a good Witbier."
"Drinkability: With a 5% ABV, I'd say this is a good Unibroue candidate for a 4-pack purchase."
"Crisp light body with just enough bubbles, not too shabby at all, this is an easy drinking beer that would be great for converting some blue moon drinkers."
"D- A smooth, light, drinkable beer. Not super memorable, but worth a try for fans of the style."
"This was an easy drnking brew, I easily finished the 750ml bottle by myself. if this was on sale, I'd gladly restock this in my fridge, as I'm not a huge fan of Witbeers, but this particular example was very good."
"D: Kind of a sweet ""desert"" beer for me. Good after dinner. No trouble finishing the 750 ml bottle but that was enough for me at one sitting. I hope this was a ""representative"" sample since the best before date was 7 months past. I did not notice any objectionable or ""off"" flavors."
"Since the belgian wit is one of the most drinkable of all styles in my opinion, and this is a very smooth representative of the style, I would certainly say this one is quite drinkable."
"Decent atmosphere. Nose is light and pretty characteristic for the style. Appearance... the same. Light color, big bubbly head. Flavor is pretty basic, but very nice. Overall, the is a pretty good quaff."
"Pours a hazy yellow, with a head that dissipates quickly. Spiced wheat aroma. Has bits of coriander, a little clove, possibly nutmeg, giving it just a slight spiciness. Not very heavy spices. The flavor is much like the aroma, only not as pronounced. It is rather smooth, and the low alcohol makes this a good session beer."
"Can you find a cooler beer in concept? I think not. Almost like a champagne in my eyes, with how the carbonation just engulfs your mouth. Such a fun beer to drink, and thankfully the fairly reasonable alcohol content enables you to do so in large quantities! I dont think Unibroue knows how to make a bad beer. Cheers!"
"D: high point along with the taste, it went down very well and it's mild enough to not beat one to death with complexity and ABV."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA perfect pint glass. It pours a hazy gold with an effervescent white head. The coriandedr is present in the nose, not sure about other spices. It generally smells ""sweet"". Lemons, oranges, and spices abound in the flavor, the finish is dry. A light bodied, highly carbonated brew that is too easy to drink. An excellent example of the style."
"I was a little surprised I had yet to review this beer I drank it quite a bit in my summer rotation. another solid beer from Unibroue and perhaps just a little better out of the 750ml corked and caged but it may just be in my head"
"Drinkability is good. This would be a great summer session beer. One with my crab legs on a cool winter night is pretty good too!!"
"D- flavor is sorta bland, and i'll blame that on an outdated bottle. everything else seems to be in order. a fine clean wit."
"Pretty delicious wit. I would have to rank it up there with the best in the style that I've had. Definitely worth a find for wit fans."
"D- I am more of a fan of darker beers, but this white beer has stood out among many I have tried. I feel this would go nicely with a well prepared mediterranean salad. I feel this is a beer for special occasions."
"On tap at the Winking Judge in Hamilton, Ontario. Pours a pale yellow body that is somewhat cloudy. Nice medium sized frothy white head accompanies. Aroma is cirtusy (mostly orange) with some floral notes to it. Smells like it is going to be refreshing. Initial taste is orange, but gives way to more of a light lemony taste, followed by some spicy notes. Nice! Goes down without a hint of alcohol. Unibrous seems to make all of their beers taste almost non-alcoholic. Good stuff."
"The lower alcohol on this brew is perfect for those longer nights spent sipping and chatting. A great, light alternative to (in my opinion) the much better La Fin du Monde. =)"
"Poured a cloudy golden/ light amber into a snifter, with two fingers of thick white head, and decent lacing. The aroma included banana, clove, citrus, pear, and fig. The taste confirmed this; banana and pear hit you first, dissolving to spiciness and subtle smokiness, and finally a thin tart finish. Very light mouthfeel, but spritzy. Very good session beer."
"D: Could have quite a few of these, goes down easy enough, very clean tasting, a good fair weather beer. I had 4 of the 6 during this session."
"D - Refreshing"
"D: I really do not like this style at all. That being said this is a great example of the style. It is a bit over the top which will help it out with beer geeks."
"D: Easy drinking and tasty."
"Drinkability - Very light and a very mild flavor. Perfect for those who enjoy, want and appreciate a light beer with a very mild flavor - Cheers!"
"*originally reviewed on July 2, 2009."
"Drinkability is good. These bottles are big but they go down fast."
"750ml bottle. Poured a hazy golden yellow colour. Nice fruity tastes thats typical with the style, but the citrus taste wasn't over the top, like other beers. So that was very pleasent. Quite drinkable. Could definately drink more of these in a sitting. I find the other Witbiers to be too acidy and citrusy, so its hard to have more then one of them. This beer, not the case. Quite delicious and definately my favourite of the style. Delicious beverage."
"D: A great well balanced beer, it's not to strong or weak on any end of the spectrum of what it should deliver."
"Overall this was solid. Not the greatest thing in the world, but I was really not complaining after I drank it. Would not mind trying again."
"Drinkability: It's really good, but it seems to begin to bite a little near the end of the glass. I don't know if it's the citrus or what, but having more than one or two at a sitting might be difficult for me. However, I could definitely drink this fairly regularly."
"I am not being impressed by Unibroue...again."
"Drinks easy enough in the summer, otherwise not too interesting"
"Pours a hazy light golden with a thin white head. Has a hint of blue/green tint to it when held up to the light also. Smell is rather muted, smells vaguely of malt. Taste is sweeter than a lot of wit's, wheaty middle, and spicy, banana finish. Mouthfeel is a bit light, nice low carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, this is a good witbier, but I've had a few better, available for a lot less money. Still worth drinking, however."
"12oz bottle. Pours cloudy straw yellow with a fluffy white head that lasts surprisingly well. Aromas of coriander and wheat, with a hint of citrus and some banana. Tastes of bready wheat with a bit of tang. Spices come through later along with very light lemon notes. Light-medium body with good carbonation for the style. A decent wit, but kind of characterless."
"Taste is tart fruit and wheat malts. Very satisfying on a hot day and quaffable without a doubt. This is a good summer brew. True to class."
"Drinkability- pretty good I would drink it again. It had light flavor but I still enjoyed it. It was good."
"D: Though not my favorite, I would drink again. Definitely a session beer IMO. I would enjoy most during the summer when all my ciders have been finished."
"Drinkability: excellent. A lovely session beer."
"It pours a hazy yellow with two inches of fizzy white head. The head has poor retention, and fades away to nothing fast. After swirling the bottom and pouring the dregs in, the colour turns an opaque peach juice orange. Aromas of orange, peach, coriander, and a hint of bread. A little bit sweet and a little bit sour, it tastes of tart orange & coriander with hints of lemon and bread. Sour wheat twang. The yeast held in suspension gives this beer a bit of body, the carbonation stops it from feeling too heavy. It's got a bit of substance without being filling. It's extremely refreshing, it's tasty, and it's very easy to get through this 750 and still want more."
"Very mild, fairly light, with mild carbonation results in a pretty drinkable beverage. Fairly refreshing on a hot summer day to boot."
"Poured a nice light golden color with a three finger head that dissipated with no lacing. Smells somewhat of a tart apple cider. Some spice. Tastes somewhat sweet and tart. Notes of citrus and some cloves and spice. Medium body, very bubbly. Drinkability is high; I could easily drink a bunch of these. Good summer beer."
"D: Goes down easy, a beer that does not ask a lot from the drinker and delivers on its promises. Could stand for a bit more complexity but not a bad beer overall."
" Very drinkable (especially in the summer months)"
"Refreshing and good. But nothing which will knock your socks off."
"Very nice. I don't know why I'm so surprised as I like everything from Unibroue. I guess I'm just not a huge fan of the style, but this one is fantastic."
"A little disappointed in this beer from a fine brewery."
"D - Not too strong and not too heavy. It goes down easy. Overall it's a pretty good Witbier."
"Overall, this is a quite enjoyable beer. This beer, more than any I've reviewed so far, gave me a little bit of trouble in that I *want* to rate it highly, but I have to downgrade a half-point here or there due to a few imperfections (at least, in my opinion). It's the difference between a rather good beer that could use a few improvements versus a mediocre beer with a few high points. I know I'd much rather have the former than the latter, but so often they get the same scores. I suppose that's why we should read reviews rather than just look at the scores."
"D - refined with interesting flavors, yet is also light and very drinkable"
"D - A very tasty beer, I wouldn't mind drinking a few of these."
"Drinkability: I'd have a couple of these. Not the best offering from Unibroue though."
"At 5% the drinkability is good but this is not one of my favorites from the great Unibroue."
"Drinkability: Very refeshing and crips, just expensive so not an anytime or all the time beer although it could be. Great biÃ¨re though just not legendary."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, mild kick, excellent representation of style, I haven't been the biggest fan of Unibroue, but this is by far the best beer that I've had from them and overall this is a very good refreshing beer to drink for a long time."
"Drinkability: Very good overall -- a nice mild tasting beer with some prominent flavors that are typically bigger in other offerings. I enjoyed it, as I have all beers from Unibroue, and this offering is certainly nothing to shy away from, even if it's not quite as good as some of their other beers."
"Light to medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. Overall this just wasn't what I'd like to see in a wit. Don't mistake me here, its not a drainpour but there's just a lot of better options out there for this style."
"D: It's light enough with decent enough flavor to be quaffable, but the intense carbonation hurts things a bit in that department."
"This is a fantastic example of a Wit. Perfectly drinkable on a hot summer day."
"I must say that even though this is not my favorite Unibroue beer, their brewery is amazing. Always quality products."
"D - Big time drinkability on a warm evening."
"D-nice easy drinker sessionsble. Fruityness dominates a bit. Overall, nothing bad, Very nice, although nothing truly amazing."
"CHEERS"
"Drinkability- Nice and refreshing, a good Witbier, nothing spectacular but overall a good beer."
"D- Eh, I would enjoy something else given the chance."
"Pours with an average-sized white head, that lasts for a little while. Color is dark yellow, with cloudiness throughout and good lacing. Aroma is citrusy, as expected (orange especially), with light yeast. Medium body on the palate, with average carbonation and a slightly bitter finish. Tasty flavor with average duration, moderate acidity, and lightly bitter. Good price, would definitely drink again... one of the better Belgian whites I've had in a while."
"I must add that Witbiers usually tend to be rather disappointing to me, thin in character and either too soft and sweet or too dry and bland, and often have unpleaant chemically-citrus tastes."
"Pours a cloudy gold color with a fluffy white head that dies down pretty quick. Smells good, a spicy, clove, yeasty, belgian aroma. A great flavor. Good cinnamon, clove spiciness with the yeasty flavor. A nice tangy citrus flavor in the finish. Very balanced and not too overpowering in any one flavor. Good mouthfeel, a nice high carbonation that adds to the spiciness of the beer. Drinkability is very good, could drink these all day long."
"Taste: The sweetness remains in the taste and the spiciness becomes a little more prevelent but not overpowering likes some Witbiers out there. It finishes off with a orange rind flavor that doesn't remain too long."
"(D)- Its 5% abv is no problem plus its a Witbier that is light, fruity, and refreshing. Just nothing to write home about, yet a good beer to drink on a warm summer weekend."
"I've had this many times and always thought it was a good wit but decided to put it alongside Hoegaarden to see specific differences. Cloudy honeyed orange with a small head. Definitely got the orange on the nose with some spice and a little caramel honey, but what grabs me is how much this actually smells like a hefe rather than a wit. It's highly carbonated and feels good in the mouth with a little sweetness and some nice citrussy flavours but it doesn't have th zesty zing of the Hoe. Still it's a pretty good take on the wit style if not a little close to hefe."
"Wits aren't really my thing but I found this to be a good experience of the style."
"M + D: A little prickly and sparkling, finishing with a spot of residue on the back of the tongue. It holds back a bit of flavour, which makes for a nice touch. Pretty modest alcohol, none of it coming out in the flavour - and better for it. Though it's not a massive or intense beer, I still find it much nicer to sip."
"I had this beer many years ago when I started my foray into the world of good beer. Since then I have seen it on the shelf many a night as I passed on it for a darker, higher abv brew. I drank many Unibroue's in this span. This included the anniversary ales, tres pistoles, maudite, terrible, don de and so forth. I finally scooped this one more time realizing my palate is now much more developed. I expected the prince of white beers. Instead I got the pauper. I don't want this beer ever again unless I appear at a party and it's budweiser or this."
"p.s. it is a fair representation of a belgian, style and quality!"
"Would make a good summer session beer. It's got some nice flavors for a lower ABV beer."
"Fairly refreshing overall, especially as the days get warmer and warmer. A very good example of the style - glad it's so easy to find around here, though I still personally prefer Maudite or Trois Pistoles."
"D: An above-average wit."
"The interesting thing is that this brew floats over the tongue. It feels as light as air. It makes it insanely drinkable. Everything in it is subtle yet complex. A good beer for a hot day."
"Blanche de Chambly is an enjoyable though somewhat uninspiring beer. Very drinkable; I could sit and drink a few and certainly would not complain. Easily a solid second tier witbier."
"Notes - Not my favorite from Unibroue, but not bad."
"D: Easy drinking."
"D - Refreshing and light...easy to get through this one quickly...nice on a warm summer night"
"Blanche de Chambly was one of my first introductions to witbiers and it long stayed as one of my favourite. Although there has been tough competition in that category as of late, I will still often look to Unibroue when hankering for something crisp, flavourful and refreshing. More often than not, Blanche de Chambly will hit the spot."
"Well recommended."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into my nonic pint glass. After stirring up the yeast, appears a cloudy golden straw color with an inch of bone white, lingering head. Nose and flavor is quite fruity - green apples, lemon, orange, maybe some peach, as well as some subtle spiciness from the yeast and finally, a dose of wheat. Medium bodied with medium to moderate carbonation. A refreshing, great drinking wit."
"Drinkability - I'd definitely have another, but unfortunately I only got the one! It goes down so easy and tastes great. Bravo Unibroue!"
"Good White Ale to be had here, definitely closer to a Belgian White Ale than most American brewers. 5% abv."
"D - Very drinkable, great subtle flavors and just enough great flavors. Great warm weather beer with tons of flavor."
"D- Good.... Nothing here will wow you. Kind of an easy drinking witbier."
"Drinkability: This is definitely a nice, smooth beer that just disappears. It is that easy to drink. I would rank the drinkability higher, but the taste is just not that much above average, unfortunately."
"D 4.5 - A very unique Witbier, I really enjoyed the tartness. Darker in color than most Wits, but still a very fine example of the style."
"D: It's not hard to drink, but it's got me fairly bored by the end of the glass."
"D: Clear, refreshing and simple. Not the first witbier I'd turn to, but an incredible take on the this satiating style!"
"I love just about all Unibrous beers and this is my girlfriends favorite beer."
"Very active carbonated mouthfeel at first, but this beer really dies down after a couple of minutes into a very flat beer. I remember this being better out of the 750ml...but anyways this is a very refreshing wit and a very good representation of the style."
"Watery (expected), but too much carbonation."
"Salud!"
"D Way up there. Low ABV and easy tasting make it so."
"While there's nothing wrong with this brew, the flavor isn't enticing, and I think there are better choices."
"This is one of my favorite white ales. It has the look of champagne and is light and bubbly. It has some fruitiness to it, but not overwhelming and goes down very smooth. This is a perfect summer beer and would probably go good with any meal as well."
"After such a great beginning, I had high hopes for the taste, which weren't quite realized. I taste yeast and dusty apple that is very reminiscent of Unibroue Ephemere. If it wasn't for the nose, I'd have thought I -was- drinking Ephemere. Also disappointing was a fairly thin body that contributed to a bit of a watery taste and mouthfeel. This is a light, drinkable beer, though a bit of letdown to me."
"This one is very drinkable and would make a great session beer."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable, but also very pedestrian. There could have been more attention paid to the flavor profile. A very solid Belgian Wit."
"Nice carbonation and very crisp. This is definitely refreshing."
"Medium bodied with a good sharp carbonation. Everything works well here. I've had both the corked and capped bottles side by side, and the mouthfeel from the corked bottles is noticeably better"
"Blanche De Chambly Ale is a good Witbier that is very easy to drink and is perfect for that hot summer day. I will have another and another..."
"D-Shmeh... Not the best brew, but pretty appropriate to the style. Would be a great sessionable brew on a hot summer day."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable."
"The best ""Witbier"" I've had, so far most have been disappointing."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Its not bad but not outstanding in any one area."
"D - Highly drinkable, great taste and very easy to drink."
"Notes from awhile ago. The drink had a pale yellow appearance with a very thick head. Aromas were very herby with a bready musk. A good earthy flavoring mixed in with a generally biscuity taste. Carbonation was great making it very crisp, refreshing. The drink was also light on the palate. Overall, a great beer."
"Pours a dark golden color with no head. Only a little froth around the edges. Not very good at all. Rather thin, light and a really nasty smokey flavor showing up. Tasted like it had lager characteristics. This is just bad."
"D-the carbonation can cause you a lot of gas if you intend to pound more than 3 of these back. A nice beer to have once and a while and worth a try."
"Overall, very smooth as it doesn't have a yeast snap and isn't as burnt as many wits. Not so light that I'd want a lemon in it though."
"Lots of carbonation, very bubbly in my mouth, just like it should be. All in all, a nice easy drinking wit, great for summer."
"Pours a slightly hazy straw color with a very nice tightly beaded white head that settles to a thin cap. Light aromas of wheat, coriander, and a spritz of lemon and orange. Perhaps the barest hint of anise as well. Crisp and well balanced with a touch of white pepper to balance the light graininess and citrus, but the taste falls off in the middle and doesn't recover on the finish. A little watery in the mouth, but very refreshing."
"Future outlook: This was part of a mini-mix pack from Unibroue. What can I say? I've been pretty consistently pleased with their offerings, and this is no exception."
"Good Belgian White. High carbonation. Fruity smell. Wheat, corriander, and lemon flavor. White head that dissapates to a small ring. I haven't had the opportunity to have many belgian whites but it is the best one to date for me. Hoegaarden was my previous favorite."
"Taste is also on the sweet side. Faint taste of banana. No bitterness or aftertaste. Wonderful drinkability. Will add this to my list of favorites in this genre."
"D= very high. I really enjoyed this beer more than I thought I would. Tastes great and isn't overehelming with alcohol. Nice brew"
"Poured into bubble pint glass. Poured a sharp, clear golden straw color, very attractive. I poured this a little to vigorously and ended up with over 2 inches of fluffy, bright white head that dissipated quickly, leaving just a trace of lacing. The usual spiciness (corinder, orange) are more subdued than I've experienced in the style. Smooth and balanced with just a little tang on the finish. The body is right where it should be, light while full. Wonderfully drinkable, I can see drinking many of these during coming summer. This style is one of my warm weather favorites, and I find this to be an excellent example of the style. After finishing the first glass, I swirled the yeast up off the bottom of the bottle. This made the beer cloudy and added a little more yeast and spice flavor. The beer remained equally enjoyable, serve to your preference."
"Drinkability - I think this is a very nice quenching beer."
"Pours yellow in color, and had a nice 4 finger head. Has a great taste, the taste to me is almost identical to Pranqster to me. has a peculiar [in a good way] taste in there that i cant quite tell what it is. This Good Brew, would get again, no problem."
"D - Renews my faith in witbiers, this is a good one"
"beer for a hot summer night"
"Pale white head of tiny, very active bubbles which almost seem to scrub themselves out of existence, lacing too quickly gone. Soft cloudiness to the pale orange to yellow color, close to full translucency, bubble beads large enough to be seen. Easygoing nose, just kind of smiles and offers the tangerine, lemon citrus, nutmeg and clove spice close to spiced pumpkin, uncoated malt balls, pie crust flakes, overall has an airy and open presence in the nostrils. Light to medium-bodied, possesses enough sourness in the lemon, orange citrus as well as heaviness in the clove, coriander spices to be fully light-bodied and nimble. Also, the consistent drying sensation concentrates it into the tongue rather than add to any lift. More hop presence, floral and mint residue with a gentle graininess, grassiness. Carbonation churns more than mixes. Extended finish makes it less apt you'll rush to the next sip."
"Cloudy orange colored beer with a head that overflows your glass if you're not careful.Aroma is spicy and flowery.Taste is spices,orange peel and florals.I do not like this beer in any way.It took every shred of my will to finish it.In my book this is one step above garbage."
"Overall, this is probably my favorite witbier. It's immensely drinkable. There are few breweries on the planet that are consistently as great as Unibroue."
"D - Not bad for a wheat beer, but prefer others over this one."
"Overall this was a tasty wit, but nothing special. A nice summer stand-by that's worth a shot."
"12 oz/Wine Specialist/$2.45"
"Pours a beautiful hazy gold with a small white head fizzy bubbles that settle quickly. Smells absolutely divine: complex sweet and tropical fruitiness, with a nice spiciness and gentle yeastiness. Tastes good but not great; flavors don't live up to complexity promised by the nose. Very actively carbonated, dances on the tongue. Exceptionally refreshing."
"There is something about this beer that made me happy. Maybe it was the way the citrus aroma reminded me of a Christmas kitchen, or maybe it was the lemony color as it poured into the glass. Maybe it was both of those things, but I know for sure that the taste was pleasant and light. This beer is now on my favorites list."
"Pours a semi-cloudy, sedimentary light yellow color. Huge head, somewhat lasting, good lacing, smallish bubbles. White aroma, some hops, sugary, pear, apple, spices. Nice mouthfeel, warm, clean finish. Taste of light pear, apple, fizzy, light."
"Drinkability: Not bad, but more of a soft drink than a beer. Not sure I'd buy this again, unless I wanted something very light."
"Drinkability: This is what I believe Blue Moon tries to be...This is an exceptional beer that I could easily have a six of and not blink an eye...It is not overly sweet or wheaty--Just a great beer"
"Nose is full of yeast and citrus notes with a bit of spice, ginger/cardamom/coriander perhaps. A light lemony wheat transcends. Midway through the glass a light yeast sourness emanates from a newly regenerated cap. Taste is similar and effervescent of carbonation and offers a rather malty nondescript finish. Malts are light however and help give the brew a good feel and finish. A bit more challenging than many a wit, and a bit more rewarding as well. Drink this and you'll never drink Hoegaarden again."
"D- I will take this anytime. A perfect summer beer but I enjoyed mine in freezing temperatures. This is one of the best witbiers that I have had to date."
"I could drink 50 of these."
"Cheers!!!"
"Poured a pale straw color with a billowing head. Smelled of wheat and citrus. The taste was wheat, coriander, and lemon. Very refreshing. I found the carbonation to be a little much but not to the point that it made it unenjoyable. This is a very drinkable beer. Low abv and very thirst quenching."
"This has wonderful sweet and citric aroma with some wheat tones. It has a lot of head and a lot of foam. I would say about tree fingers of white head. It has very cloudy brass body. It has a taste that start off sweet but turns bitter and sour as you drink. It has the standard bean like taste that you get from a wheat beer. It has a clove and coriander taste. The mouthfeel is thin. I thought this was a great beer."
"All in all, a solid example of the style. I'm not a huge fan of wits/whites, but I certainly wouldn't turn this one away. The lightness, the ample carbonation and the lemon notes make me think it would be an awesome refreshing brew in the summer, although certainly delicious and enjoyable regardless."
"Taste was some lemon again along with thhose spices"
"Overall, this is a very great beer. The mouthfeel is a little off, but other than that it is a very drinkable beer."
"A very drinkable brew that would make for great session fare. Some time outside shoveling the new snow warmed me up nicely so this cool beverage is really hitting the spot. Gotta remember this one next summer, as it would make a great cooling beverage on a hot summer's day. Recommended for fans of the style."
"D: very nice. a session beer for certain."
"Have had in bottles also, and the taste is very similar, but the aroma is not as pleasant."
"A very good wit. Bright yellow pour with a frothy white head. Spun sugar, bananas, lemon, and wheat in the nose. Sweet, wheaty taste with oranges, lemon, bubblegum, and a meringue-like sweetness. This beer suffers from going too big. Sticky, but refreshing."
"That said, I would never refuse one of these and neither should you. The aftertaste is worth it. And while I wanted something more right now, this is a very sophisticated taste - one which does not offend in any way. Very good stuff."
"Drinkability - This is an easy drinking beer that I could probably have 2 or 3 glasses in a session. A very good wheat beer."
"Taste: Smooth mellow citrus taste. Kind of reminds me of a macro-lager because it's somewhat watery."
"Pours very light orange with a huge, fluffy, white head. Good retention but little lacing. Smell is nice. A mix of traditional Belgian aspects (yeast and bread) and a nice bit of citrus and sweet fruit (apple, orange). Taste was plesant as well but a little weak I thought. Some bread, wheat, yeast and a little citrus kick, but not much. Overall it the taste just didnt jump out at me. Medium mouthfeel with a slightly oily sensation left behind. Overall a good beer and thanks to the low ABV very drinkable I thought. Not my favorite from Unibroue but a very solid offering."
"D: Light presence makes it easy to have more than one. I wasn't impressed enough to have more."
"Poured to a very pale yellow color with some carbonation bubbles, and a thin white head that dissipated quickly and left little lacing. Nose was fruity apple and the mouthfeel was slightly champagne-effervescent and dry. Flavor was somewhat muted, but a carry over of the apple mouth, all leading to a dry finish. Nothing special here."
"Pours a cloudy golden colour with a huge thick rocky white head. Smell of citrus and a tiny bit of vanilla. The cutrus is a bit stronger in the taste, but nothing really overpowering. No lacing but a white ring of froth follows it down to the end of the glass. Has a nice carbonated bite to it at the end and fairly light bodied. This is only my second witbier and im pretty impressed. The easy drinkibility of this bad boy makes me want to buy another."
"Had high expectations for this one and I feel kind of let down. Maybe because I just had an Allagash White the night before which was amazing. Taste is a little off to me... I mean it's the typical Witbier taste but there's this weird kick at the end. This makes for a very rough drinking experience and doesn't make it enjoyable. I would have one if offered to me but I wouldn't seek this one out in the future."
"Drinkability: is very high"
"Nice example of the style. Citrus is the dominate flavor, but has enough going on to make it an interesting beer. One of the better Belgian whites I've had."
"Very pleasant and refreshing, easy to drink, and great for a warm day."
"pretty drinkable beer yet unremarkable. nice beer, but on the lower end of the unibroue spectrum"
"Pours a hazy golden orange covered with an off-white and fluffy two finger head that peaks above the rim, stays for a bit and recedes with a thin sheet of lacing left behind. Smells of coriander, orange, lemon, yeasts and some sour grapes and bread. Tastes a little grassy with some orange peel, coriander and yeast blended in with some sugar. Mouth-feel is light, somewhat creamy, but with a little crispness at the end. This is a top notch wit for sure."
"D: The ABV and relatively smoothness make this one pretty sessionable. My only concern would be the carbonation level getting to me if I tried to knock a few back quickly."
"I highly enjoyed this! A real treat. Highly recommended!"
"D - A little rough to drink and not as enjoyable as their other offerings but still not to bad."
"Very refreshing and easy to drink."
"A complex and flavorful wit."
"This beer is a great example of a light, but complex beer. Sweet bready malts dominate the flavor, but notes of vanilla and allspice pop in and out. The wheat taste isn't as raw as Hoegaarden, and the aroma is a bit faint, but this is still a top-notch wit. Certainly worth trying."
"Poured slowly into a Erdinger Weisbier glass and produced a four finger white fluffy head . Cloudy dull orange with lots of medium-fine size bubbles, very active and persistent carbonation from this bottled conditioned beer. Sharp citrus taste, lively mouthfeel and a bit of spicy orange, maybe even ginger, in the finish. With a bit of air, a restrained citrus fruit zest, orange with a flash of marmalade here and there, very invigorating. Cleansed the palate quite well when snacking on cheeses and mild salami with good mouthfeel and drinkability. I did find it a bit gassy but otherwise delighted that it held up very well and I enjoyed every drop of this large bottle offering. Heartily recommended!"
"Drinkability: Fits the bill for a witbier, so this one is pretty obvious. Light, tasty, creamy. Has it all. Might not be the best, but its got good qualities to it. Recommended"
"Drinkability: Would be easier to drink if the carbonation weren't so high. As Stone says ""Yellow fizzy beer is for wussies!"" Just kidding, I still love you Unibroue."
"D: Very smooth a great summer brew."
"Eh. I'm a big fan of Unibroue in general, but for me, this just wasn't that interesting. Most of their other beers are stellar, but this was just sort of bland."
"Overall, this is another great example of the style Unibroue was going for. Not my favorite, but a perfect summer beer."
"The excellent subtleties on the palate more than make up for the lacklustre head and nose. A delicious witbier."
"D - Good beer. I like the Chamly Noir better but this is also a good one."
"D- I'm not the biggest fan of witbiers in general. This one is quite interesting with the strong Belgian yeastiness, but it also just doesn't strike my palate as an amazing beer. A good one for sitting on the porch with on a hot day though."
"Drinkability: Great, but price prohibitive, 10.99 a 4-pack bah-hum-bug!"
"Really nice beer, would definately have another one."
"[Mouth] mmm thin light and dry. Too much carbonationr, light citrics fruit and not enough malt and hop. Yeast flavors play with a good smooth citric flavor, a little more malt give a little more body..."
"3	D better than a mixed fruit wine cooler, but not great."
"D: Good all around. Not amazing though, which is slightly disappointing as Unibroue has continually impressed me. This is probably the only beer of theirs I'm least impressed with. Definitely still a good beer though...but not the best Wit."
"pours a very light color, almost like a watered down lemonade. has a small head but it is gone in no time. smell is good, very yeasty, that is the first impression, for a wit it has a very standard smell and flavor, knowing unibroue's beer i was somewhat expecting a mastery of the style, and while this is a good beer, it lacks a little body to it for my likings, that being said i still enjoyed it very much. taste is yeasty and spicy, mouthfeel is a bit watery, but it is highly dirnkable."
"Pours a cloudy, yellow color with a thick, foamy white head which provides some nice lacing. Aroma is of banana and vanilla. Very smooth and perfect for the hot sun. Slightly sweet tasting with some banana and yeast in the flavor. Very refreshing and clean."
"This beer is not bad, but not much better than average."
"A fine offering and worth trying, but not my favorite from Unibroue, nor my favorite Witbier."
"Nice eggshell white head but not much of it. Turns into a clingy ring after a few minutes that does lace a little. Cloudy straw gold. Aromas of coriander, sweet yeast, and orange peel are present though a little subdued. Classic Belgian White flavors. Allspice, coriander, lemon zest, wheat, some general fruit. Starts sweet on the palate and then becomes a little sour as the hops sink in. Light to medium body, high carbonation, crisp finish. Refreshing. Not the best Unibroue beer by any means but a pretty good example of the style."
"Overall this was a bit of a letdown for me. Maybe my expectations were off. The beginning was disjointed, the middle 1/3 of the glass was not quite good, the end was weak and disappointing. Might try it again in a pinch or maybe 3 years from now when I can't remember my disappointment anymore."
"Served in my Warsteiner pilsener glass. Poured a translucent pale yellow. Billowing bright white, rocky head could barely be contained in the glass before finally settling into a solid half-inch cap. Some bands of lacing, but poor adhesion. Scent of lemonzest and corriander. Taste follows nose, but flavors are less pronounced than the aroma suggested; addition of wheat also present in the mouth. Mouthfeel was light-bodied and somewhat flat tasting considering the dense cap, with a clean finish. Easy drinking brew, but I've had more flavorful wits. Overall character of this beer makes it quite sessionable, however."
"Loose, wet, and light. Bland marshmellows duck under an identical head. Merengue, watered down lemonade, and light additions of candy sugar. A wheat identity that retains no signs of 5%. Barely noticable esters hide between safe notes. Highly refreshing and elegant."
"Scored a single of this beer at Kappys. Pours a murky gold color, with a small white head, and some sediment floating at the bottom of the glass. Smell is very juicy, with citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons....and also some mango and pineapple. Taste is similar to a lemon pie, the pie crust is especially apparent. Great dose of carbonation on a light body. Drinkability is also very high. Easily one of the best Wits I have had in a while. The first time I had this it didn't wow me, but this time was a different story. Next time I will opt for the four pack or the large bottle. Cheers to Unibroue."
"It was nice light beer that poured a cloudy yellow haze with a thin white head. Taste of lemon citrus. A little tart, but good on a hot night.. it went well with pizza? I probably won't seek this one out again, I have a couple other white Belgians wheats in front of this one.. but I would say give it a try."
"This guy goes down pretty easy. Perfect for a hot day."
"D- A great beer for a hot day. It's very refreshing and highly quaffable. Blanche De Chambly isn't my favorite offering from Unibroue, but it's a good Wit nonetheless. Cheers!"
"D: With so many good wits available, I won't be turning back to this one."
"Witbiers really aren't my thing but this one was pretty solid. Certainly not one of Unibroue's best though."
"D-A great session beer, another excellent delivery from Unibroue."
"Drinkability: A fine, summertime brew that made watching professional movers destroy a tenant's furniture somewhat satisfying."
"Refreshing easy drinking beer that goes down quick. Not the best Wit but darn good."
"This pours a thick honey-golden, cloudy and almost opaque. The strong aroma is malty and wheaty, very appetizing. Flavor is delicious, mainly malty with considerable hints of fruit and wheat. Texture is smooth and refreshing.This is a great summer beer."
"This Canadian offering is a very pale gold with a misty character, a thin fizzy white head and average lacing. The aroma is light citrus with a very subtle graham cracker sweetness. The flavor shows a vague seven up citrus. It has pretty mild carbonation, very drinkable, a bit thin perhaps. I really don't pick up much complexity here, which surprises me with this respected brewer. Not my favorite but it's not a bad option to have with your meal."
"D - A very good wit, drinkability wise- a bit light on the spice, but very drinkable all in all. I would not hesitate to try this again, it went well w/ my egg salad on whole wheat. A very quaffable ale for summer."
"A bit too much on the sweet and fruity side of the Wit scale, but another pretty good beer from the folks at Unibroue."
"Crisp and refreshing drink with a fine light body and smooth, milky texture that finishes clean. Great drinkability."
"I will definitely get more. This is a great beer for a sunny afternoon."
"D - A pleasure to drink."
"D= This is a great example of this style from a great brewery. Definitely a warm weather staple in my house!"
""
"T: Very fruity and peppery body with a little hop bite. Very highly carbonated, bites into the tongue and makes for a clean finish. The fruit and sweetness is a little too strong, while very refreshing and flavorful not a great wit, much less beer. Probably my least favorite Unibroue offering, but probably just since I expect more from it. Still happy to have this in the summer, but would chose the allagash or southampton over this quickly"
"Poured into my glass, and tons of head formed, thick, white foam. Smelled fruity, like pear Taste was very carbonated, very light, not a strong flavor. Some yeasty bread notes, some fruity pear taste. I liked the finish, smooth, and not very stong. This would be a good beer with some fish, or light chicken, and I bet would go good with a nice, stong maduro cigar!"
"Unibroue did an awesome job with this brew; the wheat isn't too sour, the yeast isn't too powdery, and the coriander isn't too dominant. On top of the great balance, it's not as thin as some lesser wits. An excellent example of the style."
"This is a great beer that I can drink plenty of, hopefully on a deck over looking the ocean or lake, on a hot summer day. A very good example of the style."
"D- This is 5% and it is definitely sessionable so for that, 4, however, there is better sessionable beer."
"Drinkability is high since you could have this at a party and most everyone would enjoy it and you could drink several in a row no problem."
"Overall: Probably one of the better 'summer beers' (Hefes, Wits, etc) I've had this year."
"In the mouth there's a nice grainy crispness, spot on for style. Absolutely outstanding hot weather beer, as we are currently experiencing here in Phoenix."
"d: This makes an excellent hot day refresher."
"D - Easily drinkable, not bad overall but a bit weak in flavor. I would prefer more spice and less citrus."
"Drinkability: a superbly drinkable witbier. One of the tastiest brands from Unibroue."
"A wit bier kind of afternoon. Rather warm and humid. This one pours with the typical voluminous foam of a Unibroue beer, but the foam slowly subsides, leaving a white, rocky head. The nose is peppery and more generally spicy. Bitterness is kept very low leaving just a bread-like malt character and spicy esters behind. There are hints of phenols, but the finish is quite clean. I top up my glass, adding some of the yeast at the bottom of the bottle, which seems to add a touch more complexity and slightly more spice in the finish. Blanche de Chambly seems to have more body than the last witbier I tasted, which was Hoegaarden. Overall, this beer is perhaps slight less drinkable than some of its counterparts and I'm likely to stick to Unibroue's darker offerings."
"D: The first witbier that I ever remember having. Definitely in the upper echelon of the style. Easy to drink and refreshing."
"D- Yeah, it's refreshing, it's drinkable. Though it's kindof bland."
"Blanche De Chambly pours out a golden, slightly cloudy, quite bubbly brew. The beer in appearence is more reminiscent of a Belgian Golden Ale, more so than the Witbier styles. Nose is quite light, bits of oranges, peaches, lemons coming through the light yeastiness. Nose is somewhat lacking. Flavor is a bit light as well. The citrus flavors of a good Wit are there, just not quite pronounced enough. Once again, the lemon tartness,orange,yeast flavors are there. The mouthfeel is quite light, not as creamy as I prefer my Wits to be. The beer simply is too carbonated for my preference. I like the lighter mouthfeel, but just not what Im looking for in a good Wit. My least favorite from Unibroue-an otherwise outstanding brewery. I'll stick to Fin du monde."
"M/D - Rapid carbonation throughout, a bit much for a witbier."
"One could drink a good amount of this beer because of the smooth feel, but it is too boring to want to. Not a bad session Belgian in the summer."
"An approachable witbier, quite tasty."
"Unibroue has some very fine beers. The high alcohol content make them a decent buy. I enjoyed this one in my Duvel bubbler. It had loads of sediment in the bottom soI stopped the pour with just a littlebit of beer left. The appearance was very hazy summer squash color. Smelled of orange peel, coriander, some clove, and a little floral. Taste of upfront citrus with a touch of lemon zest and other mild spices. A fine witbier."
"I'd say this is probably the best regular strength witbier I've tried. The biggest downfall is the price, which is the only thing that would stop this from becoming a regular drink for me."
"Poured a hazy orange body with a one-finger head and some good lacings were left. A good fruit smell, like apples and pears along with the usual spices. Medium-bodied, this beer has a prevelant orange flavor combined with the yeast to make a tastey and very smooth beverage. There is also a good amount of pepper, clove and maybe coriander (I'm slightly guessing) that keep it balanced and gives this beer a nice little bump on the backend. Another great beer by Unibroue that is sessionable and a must try for any beer drinker."
"D. Worth it. Would have it again."
"A fairly delicious belgian wit."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale orange color. The head is two inches in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of coriander, orange peel, and lemon zest. The taste has more orange peel, and lemon than coriander. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. Overall, this is a very good witbier. I could happily drink this again."
"Is actually very tasty with some bitter dark chocolate."
"A decent session beer, when you can't find a better ale of this type."
"D- This is pretty different for a wit... although it's tasty I won't be jumping to grab another."
"As far as wits go a star choice. Thirst quenching."
"My compliments to the brewer - see you in Quebec is now only our list of brewing cities to visit in the next three years."
"all, of course, IMHO"
"Drinkability is average. I was impressed by the taste but I'm not sure if I could cirtus all the time, and the aftertaste was a tad funky, might just have been my bottle."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. It goes down easy and has a light, fruity personality."
"Taste is not as great as I expected. The palate is short and a bit simplistic. Large hints of banana, pawpaw and mango (in short; tropical fruit) with a slight hoppy mid palate, but virtually no aftertaste of which to speak. The flavours are alright for the style and hey, it's very drinkable but after that explosively blossoming sweet nose this taste is very disappointing. I just wanted more, to be honest. Mouthfeel is velvety and smooth but overall, there is a lack of character once I pour this into my mouth."
"Mouthfeel is overcarbonated, which helps the refreshment factor, but bulldozes through the flavor. A bit on the insipid side, this beer is pretty easy to drink."
"I think this beer has broad appeal and is a great beer to have handy for when guests come over (if you can't keep from drinking it all yourself!)."
"A really refreshing, beautiful drink. Absolutely smooth and drinkable, this may be the perfect session beer. A wonderful drop, and a superlative example of a witbier."
"My only complaint is it could be better carbonated."
"D - Goes down very easily. Smells very welcoming, but lacking in other areas."
"Overall- A good representation of the style. After the pour and aroma, I was expecting a little more out of the taste."
"is a spritzy summer beer 4 sure, this beer doesn't seem to fit the 5 degree weather right now but is quite delicious and surprisinly uplifting! i feel like going and blowing up my beach ball.. Pours a light hazy golden yella! .. some nice lacing .. lite summer floral hints with honey, a very pleasing smell for a witbier .. a surprise not for the brand or style, but for the amount of floties i had in the bottom of the bottle.. witbiers are winning me back, this helps!"
"A pretty good Belgian white, easy to drink."
"Highly carbonated, light-to-medium body, very dry, very crisp, but still refreshing. I think I would substitute this for the occasions where I'd normally drink champagne. Other than that, I can't see myself drinking this again. It's not that I don't like it necessarily, it's just hard to picture casually drinking."
"I'm almost done wiht my sample as I type this. This one gets a thumbs up. As good as it scored, I suspect it will fall before the Unibroue ""Les Autres"" Invitational comes to a close. Chambly Noire comes up later tonight."
"The beer poured a light golden color into my pint glass. It was hazy of course but its a wheat beer. The foam was a nice bright white color and actually had a bit of retention for a belgian beer. It smelled of spices, citrus fruits, and belgian yeast. Very nice overall. The flavor was good and of wheat and belgian yeast. Naturally, there was some orange and some other spices in there. The beer did have a bit of bite to it probably because of the wheat and maybe because of the carbonation. Definetely drinkable but just beware of the slight sourness."
"Bottle conditioned and courtesy of the LCBO. Cloudy golden body is topped by a medium white head. Fruity, spicy signature Unibroue aroma is mixed in with grain. Not surprisingly, this beer has a wheaty taste, but also undertones of fruit, and again that spicing. You can really feel the Unibroue yeast lines in their beer. Refreshing, and great for summer."
"D: As another taster stated, this beer is one that I could enjoy all evening long. Very pleased...the best Unibroue I have had to date (and they do a fine job)."
"It's the most sessionable Beer that I've had from Unibroue."
"Overall- One of the best witbiers I have ever had. I am on a Unibroue kick for the moment, and I can see exactly why. Solid and very true to sytle. Great!!"
"Pours a bit too clear for me (for a witbier). But hey, looks arenÂ’t everything. Right? Decent head. Nose is like old grass. Like it has a level of smoky quality to it. It might be like old, dead lemongrass. Not that I really know what that smells like. Flavor is good. Just a smooth witbier ride. Vibrant profile. Citric character abounds. Feel is smooth and thick. Another very drinkable Unibroue brew. Damn Tasty."
"Pours a slightly cloudy straw yellw with a bountiful white head that becomes meringue-like in appearance, and slowly settles down into a thin layer that leaves a little lacing behind. A strong citrusy and spicy aroma that mixes hop and belgian yeast notes. Crisp flavor of an american wheat ale multiplied by a complexity that only a belgian yeast strains seem to produce. Overall a refreshing beer with plenty of complexity to keep your interest but not so heavy as to wear out its welcome. It would be a perfect complement to an outdoor concert environment and a platter of fresh fruits and artisanal cheeses."
"Pours a hazy gold, with a two-three inch white foam head. Taste is wheat/yeast, almost hefe-weizenish in character, with some citrus overtones, a bit of spiciness, and a crisp lemon-y aftertaste. Good, but not overwhelming. Mouthfeel is appropriate, smell is more citrus-y than the beer itself."
"This beer pours an opaque pale liquid with suspended yeast particles and a small head, which quickly fades to an outer rim laceing. The smell is faintly grapeish with corriander and phenols in the background. The taste is dry, wheat bitterness is mildly detectable. Otherwise the taste is pretty neutral with some corriander and light fruity esters coming through. The beer has a very light body with cloyingness less than but reminiscent of the macro pilsners I grew up disliking. This beer is low on flavor but still goes down better then the generic macro beers of the world."
"D Very drinkable and refreshing, not overly artificially sweet like some wits(hoegaarden), but also not overly carbonated. Some nice fruitfull unique flavours make this wit very drinkable"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a best by date into a pint glass. It was a hazy golden straw color. It had a small bubbly head that quickly dissipated. Some carb and barely any lacing. The aroma was excellent as most wits are for me. It was heavy on coriander and citrus. In top tier of wit aromas for me. The taste was also excellent and in my wheelhouse for wits. Very crisp with a nice bite at the end. Overall, this is an awesome beer and highly recommend. Only issue I've had with it is the quality here in Texas. This batch was awesome but last 2-3 had been off which is most likely a distributor issue and not a production issue. (4.5, HR, T, Y)"
"I could knock this back all day. I believe it is drinking a lot better then Hoegaarden at the moment, and is much worth the slightly higher price tag on it then the more mainstream wits. Great job!"
"This is one of the top witbiers in my book, the beer pours perfectly cloudy as it should, smells of sweet citrus and has the taste to match. A good balance as well, that way if you plan on enjoying more than one you won't be overwhelmed with too much sweetness."
"D: Highly drinkable and refreshing. Well crafted and pronounced flavours. Another great Belgian from Unibroue!"
"After searching high and low for this one, finally found a good store that had 2 four-packs left of this one... Glad I was able to find this because it is without a doubt one of the best witbier's I've ever tried... Presented with a foil wrapping covering the head of the bottle, which was an elegant introduction to this outstanding beer... The appearance was top-notch, with a true witbier cloudy / hazy color revealing a superb aroma of citrus, yeast, wheat, and coriander that was really exquisite. Taste is out-of-this world with a strong presence of the flavors listed in the aroma... goes down smooth and refreshing... mouthfeel is great - I could drink this brew all night without minding the $6.99 I paid for a four-pack... too bad this beer isn't easier to find, as I really enjoyed this one and hope to be able to locate it again... Definitely a winner and certainly recommended!"
"D: Impossibly easy to drink. This is one of the most rewarding ""summer beers"" I've ever tried. An excellent array of aromas and flavors."
"Pale and cloudy, as expected. Head disappeared quickly. Spicy nose with a nice malt background. Great ester profile. Soft, sweet maltiness in the mouth with some zesty lime in the finish. The bitterness is low, enhanced by the (a little too) prickly carbonation and the finish is dry. This is a first rate witbier, one of the best I've tasted."
"Medium bodied and quite smooth."
"Review added 10-30-2007, translated from french 1-26-2008."
"This was my second time drinking this beer, I was much more pleased with this beer the second time around than I was the first time drinking it. It reminded me of a blend of a Belgian, mixed with a wheat flavor to it. While this beer is brewed in Quebec it was rather a plesant drink. Nothing against Quebec, I just have not had total pleasure drinking La fin du monde, so I was a little skeptical drinking this one."
"this is a really great Quebec wheat style beer. It's bottle fermented and has that yeasty richness that you find in this type. It's very highly carbonated but that works for it is spicy and is a special treat for the tongue. they have this on tap in some locales in Ottawa which is good in a city of bland beer choices but too often it is served flatter than it should be."
"Overall I find this to be a more flavorful, complex beer than Hoegaarden that is equally drinkable but more pricey."
"D - Tasty beer but pretty pricey when there are comparable wheat beers with just as much to offer."
"Somewhat reminiscent of a Hoegaarden, however this was more complex and better drinkability. Unibroue makes excellent ales. Very pleased with this and will look to purchase more in the future."
"Pours a bright golden orange color with a decent white head that dissipated into a white ring around the glass. The smell is quite good: Belgian yeast funk, candi sugar, orange peel and coriander. It has more of the Belgian yeast aroma than most wit brews. The taste is of orange peel, coriander, apple juice and light candi sugar. Not as heavy on the orange peel and coriander as most wits; which I find to be a good thing. The feel is light and way over-carbonated. The carbonation takes away much of the flavor. It kind of paralyzes the tongue. Not as strong in the witbier taste as others, probably due to the carbonation but it is still a good brew."
"Big C & C bottle that opened with a satisfying pop like a botlle of champagne. It poured a light and cloudy yellow with a huge fat white head that left moderate lacing. Slightly fruity nose with some bananas. Light mouthfeel. Flavor is of fruits. Very good to drink."
"D - Fair bit of moreishness, but I can't drink many white beers at a time. All the foam and yeast fills me up and soon enough makes me feel a little nauseas."
"Pours a beautiful clear golden color with a light head that dissapears. There appears to be very little carbonation. There is no lacing stickiness. Smell reveals a clovey sweet witbier smell. Mouthfeel is very carbonated and leaves it hard to taste. What I got was a very light, highly carbonated witbier. The best flavor of witbier I have had in a while. Mouthfeel was overpoweringly carbonated, but nothing a quick swirl can't overcome a little bit of. Wow, still very carbonated like a fresh lemon-lime soda. Overall I did enjoy this very much, once you get past the soda pop mouthfeel it's pretty darn good. I will have more of this."
"easily my least favorite Unibroue brew, but worth a shot if you like the style or the brewer."
"Overall, a good but semi-forgettable white. Recommended, still."
"Careful decanting pours a very clear yellow beer with a foamy head that falls to a thin collar that leaves no lacing. Smells of lemon, grass, and slight mustiness. The smell reminds me more of a saison than a witbier. Taste reveals a very refreshing lemon and grapefruit/orange peel flavors with hints of pepper and coriander. The mouthfeel is extremely light and thin, which is often the case with such a beer, although this borders on being too thin. Very crisp and refreshing finishing dry. Highly drinkable and enjoyable summer brew. I tried half the beer without the yeast and half with. I often enjoy the yeast and found this improved the beer."
"Tastes very similar to champagne with a wheat malt base..if that makes any sense."
"Poured this fine offering into my newly acquired sam adams specialty glass, pours a star yellow with little bubbles of carbonation and also a very serious fluffy head that hangs around for a while. Smell is tart and tangy lemon lime with hints of earth tones and a bit of lemon pepper grass. Taste is a bit biter tartness that is not over bearing but does go down nice and smooth, with a hint of peppery finish, this I enjoyed after i finished cutting my lawn and boy was it very refreshing. This to me has to be my favorite white beer to date and a damn fine offering, I will have this again soon."
"I poured this one and noticed the head fizzled away very quickly to almost nothing. The color is a murky gold and the smell is very inviting ( hints of citrus ). The taste was very smooth no aftertaste no bitterness. This could easily be a session brew for many. I look forward to having another."
"Even with all the yeast, it still came off as pretty refreshing. I still would not want to do a whole lot, the Unibroue yeast sometimes gives me heartburn"
"This is the definition of a refreshing thirst quenching beer. Right up there with the best of em. Pours with a nice frothy white head that settles but is still a good 1/2 cm thick the whole way down. This witbier is pretty clear, until I pour the sediment in. I think most beers taste better with the sediment in them (IMO) but especially this one. Now it is a cloudy yellow, nice on the eyes. Smells of delicate citrus, fruits, and the spicy Unibroue yeast is just noticeable. The taste is a clean citrusy followed by a slightly spicy yeasty finish. Very refreshing and smooth."
"It's almost something I'd consider a summer-desert drink - definately not something I could drink a lot of due to the carbonation."
"Pours a crystal-clear light-golden color, then muddied by the yeast pour. Fizzy one and a half finger head is short lived and leaves no lacing to speak of. Pale malt, candy sugar, and peach shnapps aromas, mabye some spices in the background. Two-row sweetness and strong steel-cut oats flavor upfront, followed by snappy Wit yeast phenols, mild coriander, and a dash of clove. Dry aftertaste, only the spices and some mellow peach esters hang around - briefly. The mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated, a very crisp beer with the spices completing a good balance in the absence of any hop character. The flash of fruit and spice mingle with the sweet malt and ester before quickly vanishing, and this sensation remains consistent to the finish with no residual or lingering flavors. A light and effervscent ale with many intracacies but modest in girth; a nice session beer or summertime quaffer."
"A bit thin in the mouth, and highly carbonated. Mouthfeel is not terribly impressive. Seems to be a bit filling probably due to the high level of carbonation."
"Not my favorite. Cloudy, caramel color, bubbly due to carbonation. nice mouthfeel, mildly sweet taste. slightly overcarbonated. Wouldn't reccomend this one too highly, many better alternatives. However, unibroue is still a great brewery, this just isnt one of their best unfortunately."
"Poured a 12 oz. bottle into a hefeweizen glass. Appearance is slightly hazy, no rich color though. Smell is not very potent, bit of sweetness in the nose, but that's about all. Taste is decent, but not the best I've experienced from a wheat beer. Mouthfeel is okay; carbonation is a bit much in my opinion. Drinks easily, but not really hitting me with enough to get too excited. I am not usually bowled over by wheat beers, but I as a purveyor of beer, I will still steer people toward this one before one such as Blue Moon."
"D - A decent witbier for a few, but I could focus my attention elsewhere."
"D- It's decent. Unibroue seems to brew many beers that fit the styles well, but lack the intangibles to make them world-class. This is one of those beers."
"What a great hot climate beer. I'll be drinking it all summer long."
"D- The light tartness is the most interesting flavor and the rest of the beer is very clean and light with not much complexity."
"Overall - A very good example of a witbier... not quite up with the best of the Belgians but not far off.... recommended..."
"Overall, I was disappointed with this beer. The flavors are very light and hard to pinpoint, and the carbonation makes it even worse. I'll have to try it again some other time."
"D - I was sort of disappointed by this one. It could have been so much better if it were more powerful and had stronger flavors. The flavors that exist are complex, but too fragile and delicate to be really tasty. I could drink this again, but for something so watered down it's pretty expensive. They need to pump up the volume on this one and it would be outstanding."
"d: a very light belgian style. not bad, just lacking for my taste. i'll stick to the heavier, more flavorful unibroues."
"Taste was somewhat citrusy, with an orange-lemon flavor coming through, followed by Belgian spices, coriander, and a grassy hop note. Well balanced and interesting. Mouthfeel was light and crisp. Overall this was probably my favorite ""blanche"" beer in Montreal, and one I wouldn't mind having again."
"Light bodied, creamy, very drinkable and refreshing. Well worth a try as a summer refresher."
"Drinkability is excellent, as is the norm for the style."
"Very good. Creamy, tart, and delicious."
"The beer pours golden yellow with a whispy layer of foam on top. The aroma is exactly what I want from a witbier, orangy and spicy. The flavor is good and matches the nose with a slight bitterness. The body is light, making it a great hot-summer-day beer."
"Overall - I think this is a great beer for someone who is just starting to explore the world of Belgian beer. I know I loved it the first time I had it, but I find it a little lacking nowadays. I definitely recommend drinking with the yeast added, it gives it more spice and a better overall flavour. I've tried it without adding the yeast, as well as on tap, and it is lifeless."
"Taste is crisp, a bit light. Corriander, yeast and slight apple/citrus. Just when I think a sourness is about to hit, it finishes off. Clean and refreshing. A good Witbier, will have another for sure."
"Using a special glass just for this beer. Pours a hazy, straw yellow color with a head that fades not too long after. Aroma is fruity with some hints of apple mainly and spices. Taste is spicy, crisp and goes down very smooth. Very delicious for a witbier and so very drinkable. Great for that hot day where nothing seems to quench your thirst. I would have to give this high marks for a witbier."
"pours a hazy golden straw color large white head fades quickly to just beer with almost no lace. aroma of pears and friut. taste apple, pears, peach, ending with a lemon tartness all mixing with wheat malt. mouthfeel very light, dry, crisp with lots of carbonation. great tasting summer wheat, light and refreshing and a good match up with summer foods."
"D- this is a great session ale. I enjoyed it thoroughly. I will probably have this again but not with great frequency because I can purchase comparable witbiers for better prices."
"This one was served with a nice fine white head that soon faded to a light covering. Decent lace. Hazy golden straw yellow. Typical Belgian style aromatic white ale aromas: spicy, citrusy, pale wheat, and yeast. Flavor's more intense with emphasis on yeast, bitterness on tongue, with underlying sweetness. Fine balance carbonation. Clean, fresh, and balanced. Good brew. Easy finish."
"malt and wheat upfront on the taste... some fruit and spice, but lots of yeast lingering."
"This is a very drinkable witbier that would surely hit the spot on a warm day. Give it a try."
"Unibroue's version of a white pours pale amber with a cloudy yeast sediment. The powerful, vertical jet stream of tiny carbonation bubbles shooting dead center from the bottom of the glass is impressive. The aroma is crisp and tart with a sour citrus bite. The taste is light and refreshing, like a sparkling wine. Afficionados with a more sophisticated palate toward fine wines than mine will undoubtedly enjoy the delicate nature of this beer. Mouthfeel is light - similar to that of a mass produced pilsner. This beer however is clearly light years more complex than a Miller or Budweiser. It is difficult for me to judge this style as it is not one that I'm familiar with, but I can imagine that it rates well with devotees of witbiers. Blanche De Chambly pairs well with the slice of Veggie Pizza that I'm having for lunch. Very drinkable. Give it a try! My low scores reflect my unfamiliarity with the style, rather than an aversion to it."
"This is a beer that is just too light and almost isn't there. It pours a slightly cloudy, yellow, with a pure white head. You can tell that it has plenty of natural carbonation just from the smell and the head. It seems as though they were using some champagne yeast with this one. The head is okay, not much lacing. The smell is sweet, lemony, maybe some coriander. The taste is light, light, light. It's a refreshing beer, a bit watered down, no hop taste at all, plenty of citrus and lemony overtones, maybe some oranges. It's on the dry side, and it just reminds me too much of sunflowers in summer. There is no after taste, and what taste there is is purely in the middle and dissipates towards the end. This is an interesting beer, well made, refreshing, clean, but just too transparent for my tastes. I can see this being enjoyed too easily by those who don't appreciate beer (the wine cooler crowd), as much as it being appreciated by those who do. Not for me, but I can empathize with those who like this one."
"T/m/d- Light and clean on the pallet...Light clove and bananna, orange and lemon flavors....very gentle, and mild....Very easy to drink and friendly to most pallets I presume. This beer very nice, buy for the price you can get one that is equally as good or better in a six pack for just 2 or 3 dollars more. I really enjoyed it, but for the price($5.99 or $6.99 it is just a little too much when south hampton and victory are around.)"
"D- could have quite a few of these, goes down easy enough, very clean tasting, a good summer beer"
"This is definitely a refreshing brew. I could have a few of these without any problem. Nothing terribly complex or overly exciting about this one, but it definitely holds it's own. A solid good buy."
"Though one of my least favorite Unibroue beers, this is still enjoyable -- as both a beer and a witbier. A bit light on the flavor and smell side, but that probably adds to the drinkability. I'll probably get this again in the summer."
"a refreshing beer with interesting, if muted taste...could become another summer staple."
"I drank this beer out of a pint glass. It began with a thick frothy head. The color was yellow and cloudy. The fruity undertones were strongly evident. I appreciated the complex flavors that this beer offered. It was a nice change compared to the other, more widely distrubed wheat beers. The only draw back was the higher cost."
"Overall, a very balanced witbier that I rather enjoyed. This could become a favorite of mine this summer."
"Overall im amazed with Unibroue, this brewery never lets me down, is it possible that Unibroue might be one of the top 5 breweries in the world???"
"Light and drinkable, but the flavors and texture don't match a crisp wit true to the style. An interesting take on the style, but not my favorite."
"This beer poured a cloudy straw color with a decent head Â– light lacing. The smell is fruity and floral. The taste is mild and slightly fruity Â– not overpowering. This is a delicate beer that is nicely balanced. The mouthfeel is a bit thin. IÂ’d consider this a highly drinkable beer Â– the smoothness and lightness of it would make it a delight for an entire afternoon. (Quenching)"
"Pours a pale golden color with a very airy two finger, snow white head. Full aromas of soft fruits, pear, yellow apple, yeasty tartness, wheat, vanilla, and lemon zest. Soft flavor profile with pale wheat, green tea, fruity herbals leading the way. The hops are subtle with slight bitter and spice character that fades quickly and florals that linger to throughout. Citrus notes start with a soft lemon and develops into some orange and faint lime tones and ranges from pithy bitter to juicy pulp. Light coriander rounds out this delicate beer. The finish is herbal with some dryness and something a little minerally. High carbonation at the beginning but actually settles down in the mouth to give it creamy mouthfeel. A very delicate beer that is more appreciative once youÂ’ve realized its subtleties."
"Not too hazy gold pour with a decent white frothy head that does have some lacing potential. Yummy bready, yeasty odor with very very subtle spice and fruit. Taste is sweeter than other Witbiers I have tried, but not overly so. The high carbonation leads to a bit thinner almost sparkling mouthfeel, but this drinks fine once it calms down a bit. A very enjoyable beer that I will drink again and again."
"Not overly complex, but it works."
"Verdict: I was impressd with the many layers of this beer. I like many wits, but this one stood out with its complexity. Delicious and very drinkable."
"Envigorating and not too heavy, this beer is a great intro to craft beer for a novice and a solid choice for the afficianado in hot weather."
"A great brew. One of my personal favorites due to the great taste and feel. I've had it in the actual place it is brewed at, Chambly and not only is the beer good, the restaurant is exceptional. A great beer to sit down and relax with. Highly recommended!"
"D- Really nice. Since this was a bit of a older bottle bananas and light amount of cloves started to show through making it more like a weak triple."
"I think this is THE beer to pound back. There's not too much to it, so it's easy to kill these without even noticing. This isn't my favorite witbier, but nothing to scoff at either. I'd happily drink it again... preferably on a ridiculously hot day on the lake :)"
"This might not be a session beer but it would be great with red meat or red sauced pasta cause it cleanses the palate so well."
"Overall, this beer would have easily been enjoyed more thoroughly in the summer due to it's strong orange sourness. Right now, it seems light and blander than I remember. Still tasty and good overall though."
"Mouthfeel was quite zesty with a medium body. Nice."
"Cheers!"
"A nice easy drinker from Unibroue, certainly a good example of the style."
"I was pretty impressed with this one, quite drinkable. This is my second beer from Unibroue, and I think I need to seek out more of their products, good stuff."
"I was really surprised by this beer, it was far better than i was expecting it to be(not that Unibroue has ever ever made a bad ale).It comes out of the bottle a light ,cloudy yellowish color with a nice thick head thats lasts just a few minutes and then disappears into a thin white lace.It has a very crisp, very refreshing taste(slighty tart flavor) and has an absolutely wonderful feel to it."
"I got this beer in Utah. It was very good. I thought it was kind of a mix between a hefewiezen and a lamic. The color was a light golden color, but very cloudy. It smelled kind of fruity. It tasted malty. It went down smooth. Good brew. Don't drink and review."
"Light golden color. Not much of a head or lacing but I probably poured it a little too cold. The first sense I had of the smell was apricot or other light citrus. The mild spicing comes through as a secondary but very welcome smell. Taste is what you expect from Witbier. Spicing is at what I would consider a perfect level, not overpowering but very effective in adding depth to the beer. Very high carbonation level as expected. Very dry finish, giving it an almost winelike feel. Another good beer from Unibroue. It wouldn't be my first choice of beers of theirs to drink but it's a nice one for a change of pace."
"This certainly isn't Unibroue's best offering, and it is not as complex as some of the other whites out ther. Despite that, it still has an authentic Belgian feel to it, and I would never turn one down."
"This ia great witbier. The smell is awesome without being overwheling, it really adds to the taste. It has nice spicing to it. It was incredible. Another great beer from unibroue. I have a love affair with this brewery now and will aim to try all of their beers."
"A nice beer to consume on a warm day...could be a nice gateway beer for some."
"Drinkability: Exceedingly drinkable. Crisp, fulfilling flavor with excellent properties. Well-crafted beer, with few shortcomings."
"I would like more body, and perhaps stronger dimensions in the flavour."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability were also better than I remember from the bottle. All in all a great experience with an old favourite. Especially since I had done 4 hours of aikido previous and was very thirsty."
"D - A nice, light beer that goes down smooth. To me tastes a bit like 'La Fin Du Monde', but nowhere near as strong. A nice alternative to Hoegaarden for witbier fans."
"It's like really good alcoholic mineral water. I was really pleasantly surprised with how different this beer is from other witbiers."
"The mouth is light and doesn't do much upon the palate. It's drinkable, but a bit disappointing."
" D- If your a fan of white belgium style then this is your beer. Try one and I promise you wont be disappointed."
"I really like this beer due to its complexity and flavor. I will seek it out in the future, just not by the case, though. I don't make that kind of scratch!"
"I have to say the same about the taste. It was very well-crafted, with none of that typical American microwbrew wits that are really sweet and saccharine. I got mild sugars with some yeasty and vanilla tones. Honey and mild citrus round out the palate. Very pleasant. I was somewhat disappointed with the mouthfeel, which to me seemed a bit watery for a Wit. But it finished rather dry and was overall a very enjoyable brew. Not one of my favs from Unibroue, but still a very good beer."
"Canada take on the Witbier style was a good one."
"D- Not too strong, but, then again, not to lively. This is a good witbier but as witbiers tend to be pretty low-profile, this isn't a beer that I would drink a lot."
"Drinkability: A little pricey, but would be a great summer beer that I will try again."
"It's flavorful, but delicate; and it makes a great apertif, or companion to some of the milder Thai dishes. If you've never had it, it's well worth trying!"
"Drinkability --> This beer goes down very nice. There is a lot of complexity in the taste and I'm sure I didn't fully capture it all in this review. I will definitely pick up another one of these in the future. Unibroue has done it again!"
"D: Quite a good tasting Wit from Unibroue. Excellent session beer and perfect for a summers day. Compatible with almost any food as it's not overpowering, but just very refreshing."
"The head on this one reminds me more of a soda's head. Just fizzy & dies away fast, leaving no trace. Smells like it should - yeasty & citrus. Tastes how it should as well. Accurate & true to the style, but just completely lacks any ""oomph."" It doesnt seem to reveal any special traits or any style of its own. I really dont like the mouthfeel. Too similar to soda - fizzy, and almost gives you the ""burning"" sensation in your mouth, like a cheap light beer. I must say I was disappointed, and I wouldnt be too interested in trying it again."
"Very light yellowish body is almost clear. Hosts a very large fuzzy head that is as white as foam gets. Carries a crisp wheaty nose with noticeable tones of citrus and soft mellon. Very crisp as it hits the tongue. Raw wheat feel is soft and accompinied by zesty citrus notes that are sharp. Very even and drinkable overall a nice summer style. Deffinitly best very cold."
"Drinkability and conclusions- a decent brew that goes down alright. Not my favorite from Unibroue, but it's hard to please me with this style."
"Pours a hazy golden color, almost no head. Smells yeasty with some fruitiness. Taste is citrusy with some spices and tartness. Mouthfeel is dominated by carbonation. This is ok for a session beer, especially in the summer but the cost is somewhat prohibitive."
"Pours a fairly clear golden color, a nice creamy white head dissapears quickly. I get yeast and citrus in the nose, but also some floral notes, rose? There is some effervesent bite to the beer, but it drinks fairly heavy, finishing with a cloying and clingy mouthfeel. The taste gives me some very light malt, and a tiny bit of sour apple. Not much here."
"But the aroma and taste? Dull and flat white pepper and spices, just weak notes of any wheat backbone. A very wimpy brew, foamy in the mouth, with a twinge of a soapy taste. A bummer, this was not a very impressive brew"
"Like most of the style, this one is crisp, refreshing, and dangerously drinkable."
"All in all a very good version of this style. Clean, crisp and with the right flavors. It's not necessarily my favorite style, but this is well-done."
"A decent witbier from Unibroue, a good example of the style."
"12 oz., bottle conditioned, best by 2/14/08. This beer pours a cloudy pale yellow with very active carbonation and a 3 finger, off-white head. It smells lemony with spicy yeast, orange peel, and light wheat and clove. There is a big wheat flavor that is almost nutty, a substantial coriander/white pepper quality, faint clove, mild hop bitterness but almost no hop flavor, and a spiciness that isn't as pronounced as I'd like. It has a medium body that is a bit prickly at first, but it calms down and leaves a light to medium finish. Not a bad witbier, but there are better ones out there to try."
"Blanche De Chambly pours a golden yellow with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. It has a very nice aroma, I can detect the yeast, but also tropical fruit, particularly pineapple is present. Mouthfeel is light with a sparkly carbonation. Tastes nice, you can taste a bit of fruit, the coriander really doesn't jump out at me though (which is a good thing in my opinion). Recommended, one of the more enjoyable witbiers I've tried."
"what a great beer to drink on a hot day."
"Drinkability is better than most Unibroue's I've reviewed due to it's modest 5% ABV. I reviewed this one just before having some Alaskan Wild salmon and this beer is the perfect companion."
"One of the better witbiers I've had with, surprisingly no off flavors, which I tend to get from those of the style."
"Taste of wheat and grains with spices with that typical yeastiness and it's byproducts. The coriander and orange zest are apparent. A decent witbier which is very refreshing to drink on a hot day."
"Overall, this is a brew that is somewhat lighter in flavor for most of what Unibroue produces, but it's definitely up to par with the quality one comes to expect from such a brewer. Definitely recommended, and a perfect summer refreshment beer. Would be great after a physical chore or just to sip on your porch on a hot day. A fine brew."
"I don't know, I didn't find the appeal in this one. Unibroue makes tremendous dark belgians, but this one, was way overpriced and average. I've had much better American witbiers. Has a decent soapy head, no lacing down the glass. Smells more of sour fruit, like lemon than banana. Tastes about the same, again not a bad brew, but nothing worth seeking out."
"This beer went down easier than just about any beer I've ever had, especially on a hot summer day. This might be my new beer of choice for the dog days of summer."
"I liked it, I do recommend it. I would buy it again if I don't see Hitachino white or Allagash white first."
"Another great beer from Unibroue. Blanche De Chambly is easy to drink and full of flavor. Definitely worth a try."
"Whitewashed lemon. Tiny head of miniscule bright white bubbles that evaporated leaving just a few stray bubbles at the margins. The smell is of faint orange and lemon tartness. Lemon zest and pith freshness along with touches of orange fill the mouth initially, more on the lighter side, but still distinct. There is a nice wheatiness present that leads into a distinctly coriander finish which is not overly long but it doesnÂ’t need to be. These flavors are well meshed and balanced and the light body and ample fine carbonation makes this absolutely drinkable."
"Drinkability: light, refreshing, thirst-quenching. Good introduction for a non-beer drinker."
"Pours very pale yellow color with nice thick creamy head that leaves nice lacing. Lemon zest and spices are present in the nose. Taste is clean and crisp with some hints of orange peel and a peppery spicyness that finishes dry. Overall a good wit that is very refreshing. This is a good brew for quenching your thirst on a hot day."
"Drinkability - this is very good, goes down well, and is very sessionable, especially in warm weather."
"This is a very enjoyable witbier. Not quite my favorite, as it lacks a little something to make it stand out from others in the style, but it's a good beer none-the-less."
"Still, this is a nice representative of the style and I buy it often in summer."
"The bad news is, my patience with this brewery has worn thin, and I don't intend to revisit them any time soon unless someone else is buying and/or understands my complaint with the brews I've tried and can convince me that they offer something else that doesn't share this problem."
"I can't say that this is a favorite of mine from either the brewery or for the style. It's a bit thin - but refreshing. Not a bad choice."
"D - Good on a hot afternoon, but not something I'd drink on a regular basis."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a large Marzen/Wheat glass. Well-chilled. Formed a large, pillowey, white head that lasted, eventually falling to a centimeter of foam over the beer. Dark straw in color, with a turbidity that is appropriate to the style. Aroma of light clove and bitter orange. The taste is of soft wheat, with the spices coming through on the finish. The mouthfeel is soft and light. This beer is a real quaffer; you can down two before you even notice it. As with most of this brewery's offerings, this is an outstanding example of a Belgian style (in this case wit or blanche de bruge) that often surpasses the Belgian beers available in this country. An excellent wit."
"A nice example of the style, but nothing overly remarkable"
"Notes: Another excellent beer by an excellent beer company."
"Hugely drinkable. Very crisp and clean mouthfeel with a very refreshing zest. One of the best summer beers I've had. I highly recommend it."
"I enjoyed and respected the brewer's efforts on this beer much more this time around and have made some changes above and increased my rating points accordingly."
"Iâ€™m falling in love with Unibroue! Needless to say moreâ€¦"
"D: I can, and will, drink a few of these. At ~5 dollars for a 22 oz bottle, I'll be returning to this during the summer."
"A nice beer to have on the patio on a hot sunny day."
"Pours a hazy light yellow/honey color. A very nice three finger white sudsy cap that slowly dissipated to very light lacings. Aroma is very nice with light honey and malty sweetness. Biscuit, yeast, and lots of citrusy lemon. Undertones of anise. Flavor is very near the aroma with biscuit and yeast. Lots of lemon and very slight spice in the back. Very refreshing with a light body. Carbonation is a little above medium. With the citrus, medium carbonation, and low alcohol.... this is a very smooth, quaffable beer. Great Wit!"
"All in all, Blanche De Chambly is a good witbier, but it's hardly spectacular. And - if Beer Advocate wisdom is to be trusted - certainly not on par with Unibroue's other offerings. InBev or not, I'd probably still take a Hoegaarden over this entry, though I would never turn a Blanche De Chambly down. Ever."
"Mouthfeel:"
"Appearance is what I would expect of a witbier cloudy yellow(honey like) with a big white head. Smell is very sweet strawberry , bananas, and oranges. Taste matches smell, very fruity with some spicey aftertones. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated but yet watery. Another good offering from Unibroue but not my favorite offering from them or the style."
"Â¡Salud!"
"Drinkability: Another good beer from the folks up North, this one has some nice flavors and goes down easy"
"D - Refreshing and flavourful. A very small-L light beer, but not watery like some wits and hefes."
"For me, witbiers are good at the start, when cold, and then they (unlike other beers) go south after they warm up a touch. Not so with this one. The flavor properly (in my opinion) changed during the warm-up, but all for the better. As such, I don't think I'd relegate this beer to a ""warm weather"" category, though it did seem a bit heavier than other witbiers, and I'm not sure if I'd want to have more than two at any given time."
"Overall: Such a clean beer from beginning to end. This beer just slides down as quick as some lagers in spite of the higher level of carbonation. Simple. Balanced. Certainly an enjoyable wit. The nose is more pronounced than the flavor, but I think it's countered by the mouthfeel. Definitely one to keep an eye out for."
"So I'll stick to the other beers from Unibroue for taste, and will not have this again when feeling for a wheat beer."
"Light Yellow. Nose of burnt popcorn, butter toffee, orange, clove, fruit, raw wheat and moderate spicing. Grainy wheat and malt character . Hints of fruit, clove and orange. Fairly harsh for a wheat beer. Overall, just not enough spice character for my palate. Although, when it warmed to room temperature it improved, especially in the aroma."
"D- takes three sips to get the full enjoyment of the taste, goes down easy"
"This is one Unibroue offering that I would consider buying again. Although all of their products are in the good to great range, I'm just not a big fan of the styles. This beer is refreshing, light and pleasing. The first time I had it a few months ago, it was terrific with a chicken dish my sister made. In fact, it's the best beer I've found thus far to pair with chicken."
"Good beer, but nothing to separate from all the rest, except the higher price and a head that just won't quit."
"Pours a light straw color, two finger plus head. Good retention. Lots of bubbles. Smell is of fruit and malt. Body is light and carbonated. Taste is of banana and light spice. This a great light wheat beer. I wish I had bought more than one. Recommended!"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable in the sense that it goes down easily, however, not all that interesting."
"Opinion: I think that this is a pretty good beer. I am not a huge Wit drinker, but I have been pretty happy with this one. It is light enough to be consumed like mad, but flavorful enough to please your palate. I think that it is a bit pricy, but that is the price you pay for being a beer snob."
"Overall: UnibroueÂ’s take on witbier or Â“white ale/beerÂ” is intriguing but falls a bit flat. Worth a try."
"Drinkability - A good wit, but I hoped for something more revelatory. I would definately drink it again, but I would take Allagash White or Lakefront White over this one."
"This is a pretty good wheat beer....I would only want one ; then move on to something less subtle...but if you like wheats....this is one to try...and it is definitely geting better as it warms a little."
"A decent beer, though nothing to write home about."
"Pours a hazy golden, thick white head forms, some pretty lacing and good retention. Smell is wheat, honey, banana spice, nice and fruity. Taste is witbier, some banana and spice, wheat, honey and yeast. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, a very refreshing ale."
"Drinkability: I have these every year at Thanksgiving and that is the style of food I would pair this witbier with. Mmmmm.. an old favorite of mine. :-)"
"This light yellow highly unfiltered wit is wonderful. Served in a traditional Unibroue tulip glass. The mouthfeel is smooth and light tasting, with good flavor. I can taste citrus and some spicy. The head lasts a while, no real lace except at the very start. This is one of my favorite Wits, quite interesting. Lots of organic matter floating around. Very drinkable with low ABV."
"drinkability: beer pretty much flies by. obviously a great summer beer, but hey it's freezing right now and this hits the spot too. top notch wit."
"D - One of the best witbiers I've had. I finally have another to add to my list of favorites for this style. The others are: Hoegaarden, Blue Moon, and Wittekerke."
"Drinkability: The ale is very drinkable with a low abv. Don't bother garnishing this ale with a lemon or orange wedge, it is too good to mix."
"Good head, about 2 fingers depth. It had a yellowish-brown color from top to bottom. The smell was outstanding with hints of citrus. The citrus taste was very apparent throughout the entire beer. The mouthfeel was excellent as well. The carbonation really came through. Overall, it is another outstanding brew from Unibroue."
"D: Awesome!"
"Not the best wit I've had but drinkable. Definitely a nice one when you want a crisp quencher to sip on."
"Served in an imperial pint glass. Another cloudy straw yellow body. A good, tight, white foam crowns the glass and follows down the side of the glass nicely. A snappy citrusy aroma up front. A light to medium body with that lemon zest citrus bitterness with a hint of white pepper at the end. The finish is crisp and refreshing. Very nice!"
"The mouth is medium to light with some tartness and tingle from the carbonation. On the first pour I kept the yeast out and saved an ounce or so in the bottle. After a few sips I gave the bottle a twirl and poured the rest in. It took some of the zest out and replaced it with more chalk and mellower fruit."
"Not really impressed with this one. I'll pass on them in the future."
"I would recommend grabbing one of these."
"Mildly dry taste for the style, sour lemon zest, medium wheat body with hints of banana. Gets slightly jucier towards the finish, a slightly peppery note. Not bad, but a little boring for Unibroue."
"I found this to be a decent brew and well worth a try. I would enjoy it more is the flavor was a little stronger."
"Not a bad witbier, light and refreshing though itÂ’s a bit watery. But itÂ’s still pretty tasty and I had no problem going through a 4-pack of this one. Recommended."
"12 oz capped bottle pours a cloudy hazy light pale golden color, spicy, earthy citrus aromas, nice white frothy head that sticks to the sides of my glass. Fresh wheat and mild spice-orange flavors, crisp carbonated mouthfeel, finishes clean and dry, great for the style, very refreshing and tasty."
"lame aroma. bland bland bland. i think this and the ephemere are made from the same tasteless base brew and then flavored (minimally). alcoholic tonic water"
"Drinkability: down a bit versus other witbiers since the tartness is a little too up front."
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer. A good stab at the style; however, for the price I will probably buy something else."
"Overall: I was expecting better. A solid stab; however, there are much better wits out there at a better price. I may pick it up again and give another shot."
"D: This goes down real easy. The guy at Sam's promised this would be the best wit I've had, and I keep looking for him to ask for my money back. I keep trying to like it, but am left thinking ""Why not just have a Hoegaarden instead?"" Worth trying though, and I'd probably drink it again. Unibroue does better than this."
"Cheers!"
"I would buy this again, it makes for an excellent local alternative to imported Witbier offerings that are available here."
"D - A very drinkable offering from Unibroue ... and at 5% ABV, you can easily rid yourself of a 750ml in no time. This is a good ""introductory"" beer for those who haven't tried any of Unibroue's brews ... this, or maybe the Ephemere. Can these guys make an average beer? Definitely the best thing about Canada! I'd recommend ..."
"This brew pours a golden straw color, with a nice head and decent head retention. Am detecting a sour apple smell as it warms with sweet fruits as well. Taste is more of the same, it has a nice fruity wheatyness that primarily leaves an apple flavor behind. Mouthfeel is nice and full for the style and in nicely carbonated. Overall drinkability is outstanding as this is another well crafted brew from Unibroue!"
"Found it strange that this is is wrapped with a silver jacket, but it's a twist-off... Light in color with a gentle haze. Depending on the pour there is a substantial head that dies rather quicky. Taste is great for a white, with a sweet start and a light lemony finish. There is a slight hint of bubblegum too. Also a perfect amount of carbonation, where it effervesces off your tongue but stays substantial. A great treat!"
"Poured a yellow color, nice carbonation, small head for a wheat beer and some nice lacing afterwards. Scents of citrus, sweetness, grassy. Very nice taste for a wheat beer, sweet with a nice mellow after taste. Light-medium body. Very drinkable, would recommend. Another excellent brew from Unibroue."
"Smells a bit sweet and tangy, coriander and citrus. Perhaps some orange. Taste is great, very refreshing. Light, crisp with the lively carbonation. Mirrors my observations with the smell. Orange, coriander, yeast, wheat. Reminds me of a hefe-weizen. Mouthfeel is pretty light, carbonation like a pop drink. Goes down very smooth, no real aggressive bite but a smooth aftertaste. I'd say this is very, very drinkable. Taste is very pleasant, and I'm a fan of wheats. I'd gladly take a six of these for myself, if I weren't concerned about price."
"D = Good but the price hurts it a little. Nice Witbier."
"Drinkability is good on this solid represention of witbier."
"The mouthfeel is light; the taste is orange and coriander and wheat and alcohol. They blend perfectly and make this a flavorful. crisp choice. The only distraction is th edrinkability, it has a sweetness that is not readily apparent, but you wouldn't want to kill too many of these, use moderation."
"A great cloudy beer; on of the five beers sell by unibroue in my country; smell fruity like tangerines, malt, broiled hops; taste much to wheat like franziskaner hefe weisse, but with the greatness of its aroma; good for salads, mexican food and cheese, appetizer, special parties; drink from the bottle or if it prefers on a goblet; 85% recommended."
"Overall, a non-threatening witbier that is perfect for the right conditions [a hot summer day with some fish]. There are better beers in this style, and this is certainly not Unibroue's best, but certainly worth a try. I'll have it again."
"A good witbier. Very crisp and drinkable."
"Poured a light yellow color with good white head and carbonation. No lacing observed. Smell is very spicy, citrusy with a hint of cloves. Tastes very spicy also, peppery. Also some citrus and corriander taste. Beer got cloudier as it got closer to the end of the bottle. Also got a better taste and smell as the bottle got to its end. Mouthfeel was very good, not too heavy, not too light. Overall this is a very good witbier, however I paid like 7 bucks for the bottle, not worth that much. I could find less expensive beer that I like just as well. I could see myself drinking this again"
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow with a huge fluffy head and very good lace. Aroma a slight wheat malt and yeasty. Slight citrus and hop presence. Taste of a light wheat malt, citrus and banana flavors. Yeasty with high carbonation. Sour - but a good wit sour. Very crisp and refreshing. A quality brew."
"Overall, I thought Blanche was decent, but it's the most singularly bland offering that I've had from Unibroue. I think I was expecting a bit too much given their name..."
"Drinkability: I could stand to have 2 or 3 more of these. Especially great for after a post-run or work out shower, or after work once you've settled in at home. Will definitely get these again at D's, especially if it stays warm."
"I really enjoy this brewery as hard as it is to admit being from quebec but hey I have to be objective and this is another nice brew from the establishment."
"SantÃ©"
"This beer pours a cloudy straw yellow. The head is white. It fades quickly leaving next to no laces. It has an aroma of bubblegum. It has a citrus aroma as well. Behind that, I detect a slight clovey aroma, and to a lesser extent some banana. It tastes like bananas. I taste slight malt flavors, but not much. It aslo has a citrusy taste. I can not taste any hop bitterness at all. It has a slightly yeasty taste also. This beer was a little over carbonated, but not so bad that it detracted from the flavor. It goes down smooth leaving a clovey aftertaste. This beer might not make a bad session beer. Although I didnt care for it too much, it has a very mild, non agressive flavor, and the alcohol is low. I will probably not drink this one again."
"Pours a very light yellow color, slightly hazy, but a very wit looking wit beer. Head is small and fast fading, leaving only a small film of white foam. Strong citrus and clove in the smell, orange peel also around. Taste is full and tart, very citrusy and malty, a very interesting witbier. Fairly good carbonation, but not the strongest. Nice witbier, fairly well represented of the style, but very refined."
"Mouth feel is light and highly carbonated. Nice and refreshing, it goes down quite easy. I think this is a nice version of a witbier."
"D: This one went down fairly easily, yet the aggressive carbonation is somewhat tiring on the mouth, and IMO, definitely annoying. Save the money on this one, and buy yourself some Hoegaarden."
"D - Great summer beer. Its moderate flavor would let it pair well with a lot of foods. This is one witbier I think can do without the yeast though, not due to flavor, but the appearance."
"Pours a hazy light straw with a big foamy white head and quite good retention. Smell is a subdued but fairly yeasty with a faint lemon note. Taste starts out a rather with a rather tart lemon giving way to a very doughy wheat body with a slight floral hop finish. Perfectly fine taste---however the spices in this beer seem to be almost entirely lacking---certainly less assertive than any other wit I've had recently. I can't call this a bad beer, but I was mildly disappointed considering the other great beers I've had from Unibroue."
"Pours a pale lemon yellow, with lots of creamy, foamy white head, that lasted longer than the beer. Smells yeasty, and wheaty, like a good bread roll. Slightly citrus on the palate, and less spices than most wits. Tasted somewhat tart, but refreshingly crisp. This is a really good summer beer if you like wheats/wits."
"Goes down very smooth, but I wish it gave me more to linger over."
"Drinkability: This is a very good and drinkable beer. An awesome job on all aspects. It could be just a little more balanced and playful in taste. The smell could be bolder. But this is a good beer."
"A slightly cloudy lemon yellow brew. Typical citrus aroma... especially lemon. Orange peel, lemon, and a kind of indescipt herbal note in the flavor. Shorter on the palate than Hoegaarden. I think the increased herbal overtones made for a slightly unbalanced product, but this is is still a very tasty and refreshing beer."
"Pours grapefruit juice with smaller white head for a witbier offering some soft lace. Mild aromas of white wine grape. Little orange peels or coriander but lots of lemon tart wheat. The citris astringency provides some bitterness. Light bodied a nice summer beer. Not your usual whit ( especially from Unibroues) but would compliment a dinner with poultry, fish, or shellfish."
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow, with a nice white head that dissapates quickly. Aroma is dominated by spices (clove, corriander and orange peel) and fruity ale yeast smells with a light bready malt backbone, very belgian smelling. Taste begins with spices; corriander and clove and a hint of orange peel, followed by a fruity ale esters flavor and a light bready malt flavor. Mouthfeel is smooth, carbonation is moderate and the drinkability is good."
"Medium in body with very light soft carbonation fed by tiny bubbles. Mouthfeel is slick, creamy, and very quenching. More complex and tart that bottled version. $2.50 a pint at Mellow Mushroom, what a steal!"
"Second tasting: Keep loving this beer more and more. Last night, I detected a lemonade flavor in the initial sip that took me by surprise. Not a bad thing, just didn't expect it."
"The beer poured a slightly yellowed white color with a 2 finger head that fell to a light ring around the top. The nose was a little bit of a let down. It was light citrusy and spicey coriander. Ther was a slightly odd almost dusty aroma. Weird. The flavor was good, but a touch light for my taste. Light orange and spiceyness, but just lacking. The feel was a light moderate wit han active carbonation. I'd like a touch more thickness. Overall, a nice brew. Refreshing and easy to drink. I'll try it again, as I remember it being better."
"This is pours a hazey light yellow with a nice head that sticks around for a while. The nose is full of citrus and spices. There is definately some coriander in this brew. Great mouthfeel and very drinkable. Overall a great beer. I'd definately recommend this beer to anyone."
"Very drinkable, throughs down a challenge to all but the Allagash white."
"This beer is now available in six packs which has prompted me to buy for the summer season. It pours a great hazed white/yellow with a nice head. The beer is all citrus, coriander, yeast and Belgium on the nose. This is one of my favourite wits because of the complexity that lies beneath the supreme drinkability. Think of it as lawnmower beer for flemish gardens."
"Though I have heard that Unibroue suffers on-tap."
"D: Easygoing and super drinkable. Unlike beefy pale ales that use an obscene amount of hops to try and make the hoppiest beer ever, the challenge of a good Witbier (IMHO) is to try and tame the spices that can make an otherwise delicate flavor into an undrinkable mess. Unibroue achieves this delicate balance with flying colors. By far one of the best Witbiers on the market."
"With my love for this beer and Celis, I guess I am just a sucker for this style."
"Poured out to a cloudy yellow color, with higher carbonation and a decent white foamy head. Best before date - 06/07/06. Aromas of grapes and citrus, with a floral character mixed in there too. Flavor was crisp, direct and consistant, with overtones of smooth malt, fruits and spices with a kind of salty like quality. Finished rather dry, with not much aftertaste. I think this beer would be better if it was aged longer. Worth a try."
"Drinkability: With not much to overpower the senses, this beer is easy to polish off. I cannot think of a reason to pick this up over some of the more intricate and delightful Unibroue offerings though."
"Taste is fully flavoured and gives you a nice sourness and fresh malty brew. Further quiet bitter for a wheatbeer. Bitternes is litle hanging and litle yeasty though. Mouthfeel is full and complex and enjoyable; especially on niceand warm days."
"Drinkability: This is a very good wit. The subtleness of the flavor is great."
"Nice very drinkable beer. Not as tastey as others, but nice."
"Wow.... pours a very hazy yellow color, with a fluffy head. Streams of tiny bubbles cascade upwards through this beer. Aroma of yeasty banana-clove, balance towards cloves in my opinion. Taste is refreshing, light on the tongue. Lively carbonation leaves little aftertaste. A very refreshing beer from Unibroue."
"I wasn't too impressed with this beer, but it's also probably one of my least favorite styles of beer. It is indeed better than other witbiers I've had in the past, but just not my cup of tea."
"Drinkability- Hmmm, not bad. Still not a Hoegaarden, but not a bad effort by Unibroue. I would get this one again."
"From a 341ml bottle into a tumbler. Hazy light yellow in colour with small white head with almost no retention (glassware may be suspect in this respect). Citrus and spice in the aroma with mild cloves This extends through to the taste which is very similar to the Hoegaarden. Mouthfeel is OK, not watery, but not particularly big either. Quite an enjoyable quaff on a summer evening."
"Solid Belgian White. I have not had to many other interpretations of this style outside of Belgium that can reproduce this beer, but Unibroue comes mighty close. I could drink this all day long on a hot day. There is a great thirst quenching quality to this beer."
"Served in a 12oz bottle with a best by date of 04-20-06. Poured a foggy, golden color with a thin, if effervescent, head. Had a crisp scent that was pleasing without being pungent. Tasted of citrus with hints of other fruitiness. Sharp flavor on the tip of the tongue, but smooth as it made its way to the back of my throat. Will try this Unibroue offering again, as I think I will appreciate its refreshing characteristics more as the weather warms up."
"Poured from a 750ml brown corked bottle. As per date code: bottled Oct. 4, 2004. Color is a cloudy gold, with a big white head, but soon dissipated to small collar. Yeasty aroma, coriander, orange peel (very similar to Hoegaarden). Flavour is light and fruity, with more yeast and coriander."
"Enjoyed with gouda and wheat crackers after a walk in the woods with Beulah, my dane."
"Note: One thing I noticed (I guess I should put it in here) is my keg leaked for about 20 seconds after everytime I closed. Maybe just a bad keg. But the beer was beautiful."
"Quite good. Light and drinkable, but fairly unadventurous. So far, it's a close second in this horizontal test."
"12 oz. bottle poured into authentic glass. Pours a hazy yellow-orange color with a frothy white head that lasts. Pale and wheat malt nose with some coriander and mild tropical citrus. Tasty witbier, it has a more tropical feel to it than other witbiers. It has a slight mineral background and is a little thin but the flavor is wonderful. A good example of a witbier brewed outside of Belgium."
"Refreshing and easy drinking. Stock some at a party and offer it to your usual white wine drinkers."
"Drinkability is good, could down this most days but it would be especially good in the summer."
"Drinkability is excellent for me definitely a session beer."
"Pours cloudy light amber, a lemon-juice color. Super head, again, Unibroue, I forgot to be extra careful in the pour. Copious, foamy, thick head with forever retention. Smell is mainly yeasts with a bit of citrus, banana notes, a little wheat at the base. The taste concurs, being lighter than most Witbiers but with a good base of wheats with a rather heavy yeastiness as well as a lot of lemon. Mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth. A very good beer, although not the best of Unibroue."
"Thx"
"The style does hold a nice mild mouthfeel and its lightweight-ness certainly credits its drinkability."
"I'll definitely be having more of these in the future."
"Pours a highly-carbonated and slightly cloudy pale yellow with a huge creamy white head and light lacing. Lemon and orange-peel aromas with some underlying yeasty spice. Flavor is initially citrus fruitiness, develops into a yeasty and slightly tart middle, and finishes with dry orange spices. Good carbonation and medium-light body. A tasty and very drinkable Belgian-style wheat beer."
"First sip reveals a light bodied brew with small tingly carbonation. The beer is very citrusy from start to finish with orange and lemon hitting my palate immediately and then some light spiciness mixing with a crisp bitey finish. Very clean and refreshing. I think I would prefer to have sampled this beer slightly chilled on a hot summer day while reading a book at the beach, or while eating burgers on the grill. OVerall it is tasty and refreshing but not very exciting."
"My first unibroue - this is good shit. I just had a couple Paulaner Hefe's so I am kind of comparing it to those - very similar. Nice cloudy yellow gold appearance. Pleasant spicy banana aroma but not real strong. Great tasting beer, real smooth with the banana flavours most predominant and a little maltiness. Definetly a great quaffing beer."
"A good wit, but very delicate and subtle. I think my taste buds are used to the brutish versions of this style that other breweries put out."
"The is a great beer that replaces Hoegaarden as the wit on my to buy list."
"Blanche de Chamble was served from a 12 oz botle. In a tulip glass, the beer was a pale straw color, and was topped by a voluminous fine white head. The nose offered rich powdery-musky malts with ample coriander and bitter citric zesty accents. A fresh cutting acidic lemony-orange aroma completes the package. On the palate, coriander citric zest-spiced nectarine-tinged pale malts hit with good crispness. Spiced malts please Â‘till a cleaner though musty spicy hop finish kicks in...leaving lingering spicy malt. The medium body was appropriate, as was the zippy carbonation. This was a very good, satisfying, and somewhat refreshing white ale that I would buy again and again, if it were available in the PNW."
"The body is really nice - feels heavy when it enters the mouth, but then quickly dissolves in the mouth like cotton candy."
"Not a bad choice by any means; makes for a good appetizer."
"Pours a champagne color with not much head. Blanche de Chambly is too pretensious a name for this beer, I'm sorry...not that the name should mean too much, the beer is fantastic. This has the best drinkability of the three Unibroue beers I've tried this weekend, since the abv isn't high enough to knock you on your ass after a few. Not that being drunk is the point of spending the extra money for Unibroue."
"Pours a murky straw, with greenish yellow tinges. The head is ridoculously large and billowy with excellent retention and masses of lace. The aroma is very aromatic; citrus sherbert and some tartness are the most prominent parts. The taste is very citrusy with a tart acidic edge. A sweet malt flavor shows up in the middle. Theres a chalky yeast character and some spicyness in the finish. The mouthfeel is a little viscous with a soapy feel, though still pleasant. This is a very delicious witbier, and definitely more tart that other examples Ive tried."
"from reading the label i thought that this beer would be a bit more cloudy. very transparent. the white head goes away soon and doesn't really leave anything in the way of lacing. smell is citrus and clean. taste is citrus, clean, and very little in the way of malt. hops blend in with the citrus for a crisp bite. a good beer."
"My least favorite Unibroue. Kind of a ""Don de Dieu light"". Doesn't have the citrus notes of the Hoogarden or Allagash, IMO. Nothing distinctive, although there is also nothing overly negative to say. As I said, lower the ABV on the Don, you'll have this one."
"I'm a bit put off by the starchiness, though I suppose that's to style. It matched nicely with smoked chicken and pork, salad, and even a cookie (each picked up the wheatiness of the other). A good barbeque beer."
"Slightly hazy, pale gold in hue with honey-peachy highlights. Not much in the way of animation reached the head, this didnÂ’t seem to matter much as the head reached a healthy three fingers in height. Bright white in color, for some reason I felt compelled to listen to my beer. As the head rapidly faded away it was crackling and popping. It was quite loud! This noisy chaos almost compensated for the rapid head depletion. Almost. There was no subsequent lacing. This is a respectable looking beer. The nose has all of the classic Wit characteristics but this offering seems to have one extra thing going for it. It smells fresher, lively. Pleasant. I enjoy the aromas of dried oranges, spice like coriander and maybe a whiff of ginger, wheat, vanilla, faint leather, and at the end is a hint of candied malt. The potency is small and all of the previously mentioned smells are light on the nose, this seems typical for the style so I will have to live with that. No complaints really, the bouquet is classy and inviting. I look forward to a sip. The palate is lovely; I donÂ’t think Unibroune breaks any new ground with this one though. Maybe they werenÂ’t trying too. As there is nothing wrong with being Â“dead-onÂ” for the style. I really enjoy the spirited carbonation (at the beginning), there was a million miniature bubbles dancing on my tongue. That is definitely one way to make a beer refreshing. The flavors consist of sweet maltiness, apples, vanilla, spice (coriander and I swear gingerÂ… yeasty can be tricky!), and some raw wheat flavors. I really enjoy the softness of the palate, obviously well-crafted. Once the aftertaste develops a citrus bite is found along with the flavors I mentioned earlier. It is enjoyable but not boisterous. Medium/medium-light in body, it seems a tickle thin, also the carbonation falls apart too quickly. Overall the mouthfeel is satisfying but not really that noteworthy. This is a good drinker, plus the abv is only 5%! I could kick back and enjoy a few 750ML bottles on some lazy Saturday afternoon. Of course that is predicated on me finding this beer again. Sure, there are a million reviews for it on BA but IÂ’ve never seen it in Kansas City (it sure the hell is not in Nebraska). I purchased my bottle in Burnsville, MN for $7.00. I like it."
"This beer has a very pleasant drinkablity, and one I would be inclined to try again."
"Blanche de Chambly may be true to its Belgian roots, but that doesn't mean that it's a beer that I enjoy. Even though I'll have no trouble finishing the bottle, it'll be the last bottle that I buy. Not one of Unibroue's best."
"Quite an excellent wit. This is one of my favorites from Unibroue, and one of the best North American witbiers. One recommendation: go for the 12 oz bottles and avoid the corked 750ml. This delicate beer can get cork-tainted very easily. The capped bottles are much cleaner tasting."
"Awesomely inviting corriander and yeast aroma. Fine, thick, bright white colored head leaves scattered patches of lace. Highly carbonated, hazy, sunshine wheat colored beer with streams of carbonation shooting to the surface. Light bodied beer with a crisp taste. Light, fresh lemony wheat flavor, finish is a bit watery. Good beer, finish is a bit dissapointing after such a great start."
"One of Unibroue's most popular, and a great one at that."
"Drinkability: Like a lot of whites, this one is highly drinkable."
"Overall, quite a disappointment. The head was huge, as expected, the murky dark yellow color is consistent with type but that doesn't mean it's nice to look at. The smell was the best part, nice malty, spicy aromas jump right out at you. The taste was a huge letdown, in no way lived up to the promise of the smell and just to boot, this beer had a decidedly watery mouthfeel, less mouthfilling than many pilsners for that matter. Overall, overrated, overpriced, underbrewed."
"Poured from the 750ml. Lightly cloudy pale golden. Lofty, fluffy porcelain white head. Frothy, soft lace remains. Rather tame aromawise, with musty, mildly bready yeast tones and floral honey tones dominating. Understated orange peel character. In flavor, prevalent is an herbaceous impression of coriander and grainy, tart wheat. Notions of bitter lemon peel with a trace pith like astringency provide a drying bitterness. Dulcet cloveish phenols and trace banana esters arise as the beer warms and complement sourdough tones. Lightly bodied with a token proteinaceous viscosity from the wheat, but otherwise nearly thin. Finishes with benign citric bitterness along with an too fleeting snap of bright, ripe orange. A well rounded, albeit prosaic wit. Crafted well, but perhaps the most underwhelming of Unibroue's classic interpretations."
"Drinkability/notes: One of the better Wits that I have tried. The 750ml bottle would provide an interesting alternative to serve to guests in lieu of a white wine."
"I was mildly disappointed with this offering from Unibroue. It seems as if they left the mute button on and the true volume of this beer was well understated. Still, it's not bad--just not the first I'd grab from the fridge."
"Pours a very creamy head into my trusty tuilp glass; very floral scent that sets up for a sweet experience. The balance and creaminess of this beer is amazing. I wouldn't think to call a witbeer creamy but this seems to be to me. Wonderful bouquet of flowers and citrus. taste notes of coriander, lemon, orange, and a very sublte hint of honey and pepper. this is one deeply satisfying beer . An amazing attibute to a warm summer's evening and currently takes my vote as the best of its style at present(sorry victory..) Pick some up, grab your loved one(s), grill the tuna steaks and enjoy!"
"wow what a nice wit. pours a very pale almost white color. Smells sour like your classic wit, very similar, a small amount of spices are present. Tastes yeasty, sour, slightly fruity, with a slight hop tingle at the end. Honestly a great wit, I believe it surpasses hometown favorite Lakefront White."
"This should be the standard Witbier that everything is compared to. It doesnâ€™t stand out as amazing, but it also does not disappoint in any way either. A beer that does everything well, with no exceptional highs or lows. It pours an average sized fizzy white head with fair lacing abilities. The color is a lightly cloudy yellow. The smell is of light citrus. The malt flavor is average, nothing offensive, same can be said for the yeast. The alcohol flavor is light as well. The flavor overall is light, with hints of clove lemon and honey. the mouth feel is light, and crisp. The body feels light and fizzy as well. This beer is good for any occasion, I donâ€™t think this beer can do any wrong. Although if you do want to ""kick it up a notch", try unibroue's La Fin Du Monde. In which they increase the ABV from 5% to 9% ""BAM!""."
"Cloudy straw yellow colour with a dense white head that produced some fine lace. It had a mellow wheat nose with some sharper citrus and spices. Flavour and mouthfeel had strong contributions from the yeast, which included a slight soapy texture. Coriander and a faint orange flavour were quite pleasant, coupled with a light bitter finish. Overall, quite spicy. Quite a light body, dry at the end and a little fizzy."
"Had on tap somewhere in Montreal..trying to remember, oh well. Cloudy straw colored concoction. That white whipped head went away fast. Aroma is surprise: banana and clove (ok, maybe it wasn't a surprise). Taste is actually nicely smooth, with some spice and wheat in the finish. Covers all the bases, but not sock knocking off great."
"Poured a pretty golden-yellow color with a nice fluffy white head. Aromas of fresh mown grass and citrus (lemon) and a variety of herbs I can't place. Flavor follow through the aroma profile, with grains (wheat) and malt the dominant character. Very light, clean, and refreshing. I enjoyed this beer, and would gladly drink more, but I felt that I enjoyed a couple of the Belgian white beers a bit more. Not a slam on this beer- it's pretty good, but I would go to a couple of others first."
"A nice drinkable beer."
"I typically really like witbiers, and this isnÂ’t really bad, but it wasnÂ’t what I really like. ItÂ’s a cloudy whitish yellow with a good head. Heavy carbonation (part of the problem) that gave it a bit of a cottony moutfeel. ItÂ’s pretty dry and herbally, and spiced well, but not too strongly. I would have preferred it a little less dry though. Nice lemony/coriander aroma."
"Pours a hazy straw color, quite cloudy actually giving this beer the characteristic white color. A thin white head sits a top this brew. Aromas of coriander, lemon, herbs, and a sour smell all are found in the nose. The flavor is crisp with a complimenting slight acidity. Orange, hint of coriander, apple, and grainy wheat notes are in the taste. This is a nice straight forward example, which really is what this style is all about. A perfect beer for a summer afternoon."
"Light feel, crisp and very effervescent from all of that carbonation."
"Another good one from Unibroue. The Wit pours a hazy yellow color with a large, quickly dissipating head and considerable lacing. The aroma is of wheat, fruit, and a little citrus. The predominant taste is the wheat with some spiciness. It's sort of like bread in a glass, in a good way. The mouthfeel is a little light (thin) but the beer goes down nicely, especially on a hot day."
"Pours into the glass a pale and cloudy yellow. A frothy, white head that slowly dissipates to a thin layer forms on top. Nice consistent carbonation throughout. The aroma gives way to coriander and fruit tones. The taste has a light to medium creamy body. A complex flavor of orange, coriander and pepper unfold. What a great Witbier! This could easily be a session brew. This also paired nicely with my Indian food. Another great offering from Unibroue."
"This beer pours a hazy light yellow with a good frothy head that lasted the whole way with ok lacing. The smell was malty, lemony citrus and fresh. The taste was a nice blend of malt and hops that finishes slightly dry with a hint of spice in the end. Mouthfeel was as impressive as the rest of the beer and it was quite good. I really enjoyed this beer."
"Pours a yellow, lightly cloudy color, medium sized white head that dissapates quickly. Fair lacing. There is some good carbonation going on. Its crisp, lemony, wheaty, very malty, finishes a little dry and spicy. I thought it was a very good belgian wit beer, and enjoyed it a lot. This is one of unibroue's lower alcohol beer. Its a good wit, but I've had better."
"Pours hazy orange/yellow with a frothy white head that remains. Smells spicy, yeasty and citrusy. Taste is of dried orange or orange peel, some spices, coriander maybe and touches of mild citrus. Good mellow yeast flavors and to be sure that mouth numbing Unibroue yeast that I love. Crisp, refreshing and very very drinkable. One of the best wits around."
"Poured out a hazy pale yellow/gold color with a good amount of carbonation. Smell consisted of a good amount of orange peels and spice. Some citric notes are also noted in there. Taste was nice. Lots of citric notes hit the palate first with some spice mixing in. But it's not overwhelming in the spice department. A little orange peel makes it's way through for the undertones. Mouthfeel was a little thin, espeically for a wit, could of used a little more body to it. But other than that, a very good wit beer."
"Pours a golden color with a massive white head. Aroma is very faint but i perceive a note of wheat. Taste is what you would expect from a wit, very clean, balanced. A hint of clove with some fruit are the flavors most apparent. Mouthfeel is nice an bubbly and drinkability is pretty nice. Not my favorite wit overall. I was expecting a little more from Unibroue as they are one of my favorite breweries maybe this style just doesn't do it for me."
"on draft @ the Gingerman in NYC. Light/dull orange in color. Very cloudy, white fine bubble head, leaves major lace. Powdered sugar in nose. Crisp, light, refreshing,fresh tasting. Lemony, and spicey, nice dryness in finish. Very pleasant thirst quencher, quality stuff, great with food and during warm weather months."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"The beer pours a nice gold color with a thick frothy white head. The aroma is good. It boasts of Belgian pale malts and that fruity yeast scent that I love. There seems to be some spices in here as well. The taste is good also. It has a nice light fruity taste with pale malt flavor. There seems to be some spices, but nothing too strong. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied brew with good carbonation. This is a good brew. It goes down easy and refreshes. It has good flavor; a beer I will have again."
"Pours out a hazy straw color, much like a hefe. Decent fluffy white head here. Aroma of fruity esers, bananas, tropical fruits, spices, and some bready malt. Taste is clean and flavorful. ther eis in fact a clove taste in the background here, some slight bready maltiness and some mild hop bitterness at the end of things. Very carbonated mouthfeel. This is a great tasting session ale. low ABV & lots of taste. Good stuff."
"The smell is nice, full of flowery citrus. The flavor is decent but not too exciting. It has a good balance of sweetness, hops, and citrus. The finish is dominated by citrus."
"All in all, I thought this was a tasty wit that was quite quaffable. The flavors were well balanced and it was a good choice for what turned out to be a warm day. Another good offering from the folks at Unibroue."
"Poured into a Rapscallion snifter, foamy half inch virgin white head formed on top of a slightly cloudy golden hued liquid. Some lacing, more like a slight foam that hurries to rejoin the liquid. Expected ""white"" nose, a sharp, yet wheaty smell. Initial bite to the flavor, then mellows out to a nice well-rounded wheat. As expected, a worthy brew from Unibroue."
"Great taste... light, sweet finish. This beer would make it easy to drink a bit too many!"
"pours a slightly cloudy pale straw with a pretty spritely carbonation. Smell is grainy with hints of spice and citrus. Taste is pretty light on the spice for a wit. Not nearly the orangy-coriander of say Hoegaarden. The spice comes in at the very end. A bit sweet but nothing offensive. Mouthfeel is fairly carbonated, but not overly so, more refreshing than prickly. Drinkability is good and this would be quite refreshing on a summers day. Not my favourite from Unibroue but still a pretty good beer"
"Very mild and drinkable."
"Drinkability: Very refreshing but there are better examples of the style."
"Pours a hazy orange straw type amberish color with a white head which leaves before its time. Fruity indeed this brew is. Very well balanced. Oranges and spice and some yeasty nice. I enjoy this beer much much more on tap, but it is still quite good bottled."
"Wow! A Unibroue with a low abv. This will be interesting. Pours a hazy, straw yellow, with an immense tightlyknit white head. Head is prolonged and leaves sheet lacing down the glass. Nose is fruity and floral, akin to other Unibroue offerings. Peppery spices and Valencia oranges occupy the nose. Taste is dry, tart, slightly yeasty, and refreshing. Dry and fizzy in the mouth. Very drinkable. Unusual for a Unibroue, but I like this one. Not as complex as other Unibroues, but I like it as a welcomed change of pace."
"This stuff ain't bad, but ain't great either. Very smooth taste without much flavor. Very fizzy at the pour, diminishes to a chunky solid white head. This tastes like (I imagine) the macros are supposed to taste, easy drinking for damn near everyone and a bit watery. I really didn't care for it at all."
"On the second bottle, I found subtle differences. I can taste a definite wood flavour in this bottle, as well as other slight tastes. Spectacular, this difference between two bottles: enough to add nuances and complexity, without risking consistency."
"Great tasting, vast drinkability, exquisite."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable wit, however, I definitely prefer the other more substantial Unibroue offerings."
"Pours out to a pastel, cloudy, yellowish-gold in the glass with a good sized head. Aroma is that of yeast and a faint spice. The taste shows hints of clove and light banana. This is a very easy to drink beer. The Quebec Quaffer!"
"Had it on-tap and it was even more refreshing but would not be ranked as high as the bottle."
"Poured a hazy off-yellow colour with a big white head that quickly dissolved The nose is kinda of a lemon and it is very reminiscent in taste to La fin du monde for a lot of folks. I don't get that in the taste but a lot of people do. It is often described as tart and the aftertaste is one of sour fruit (I guess that's lemon again) but, hey, Blanche de Chambly is, as they say, easy to drink and full of good tasting flavour. I like this beer for supper."
"This beer is perhaps not as complex as it should be, but is slightly bracing and quite refreshing. For me its particular lack of complexity actually increases its drinkability. I consider this to be a ""safety-blanche"" - something to drink when I want a wit, but don't feel like being challenged."
"Yes, not as big as Unibroue's other beers, but this is a quality wit, and certainly one that I'd have again."
"This is simply an average beer at best. Maybe I'm being harsh because my standards are so high from any Unibroue product but this was a severy disappointment. Looked way too thin in body and tasted that way too. Color reminded me of urine, pale and light yellow. Taste showed very little. Slight breadiness and a bit of spice, but it was super weak. A bit cloying as well. Still this was ok but not any better than that."
"Great representation of this genre and very drinkable."
"bien sur!"
"Another great Unibroue beer. Lots of carbonation gives this pale yellow beer a great head that recedes to a thin, long lasting film. Very cloudy and pale. Aroma was fruity and yeasty with apples very pronounced. Taste was a touch sour, tart and spicy. I think this is the first beer I really like better with the yeast swirled in."
"The nose is about yeast and does it well, but lightly. The flavor gives hints of spice and also creates the fruit sense called for. The feel is quite good; lgiht with nice crispness at the end. Drinkability is very good."
"Light golden brew with a nice foamy white head that stayed on for a while. Sweet refreshing taste with a fruity aftertaste. Good Unibroue yeast taste. This is one of the very good witbier, better then Hoegarden but not to the level of Blanche de Bruges."
"Overall Impression: Well made, but mild white. If you are new to white beers, this may be a mild starting point, but I like my whites with PUNCH. This has more of a mild push. The spices are close to the rest of the Unibroue beers Iâ€™ve tasted. I would up the citric acids, go heavier with the spices, especially the coriander, and think about another yeast strain to give it some more punch."
"This beer pours with an almost Champagne like head full of tiny little bubbles. I belive I heard somwhere that they use a champagne yeast for this brew. There is a slightly sour grassy aroma as you start your first mouthfull. The taste dances back and forth across your tongue. At first sweet then sour then the light corriander and back again. This is a mavelous beer to start of with to leave the mega brew world."
"Drinkability Â– This one went down well. I would have like to have seen a little more flavor, but a good witbier nevertheless."
"Overall, a good witbier. Not as flavorful as an Allagash White IMO, but maybe better suited for a hot summer day."
"Drinkability: This is probably one of the more drinkable beers I have ever had. Great session beer for hot and humid DC summers."
"Drinkability - will stay tasty for as long as you wanna drink 'em. Good flavor intensity makes this an easy session pick."
"Pours to a pale yellowish color with a white head. It has a spicy, wheat aroma; maybe coriander or orange peel? It also has a bready malt aroma. The flavor is also bready, with wheat and the coriander spice flavors. It is a light bodied, easy drinking beer. One of my favorite Unibroue products."
"This beer pours a cloudy yellow with a strong foamy head and lots of carbonation. Smells a little of citrus and some other fruits. The taste is very smooth and drinkable - very sweet and enjoyable. The fruits are very good, but the main flavor comes from the malts."
"Hazy golden in color. The high carbonation keeps a thin layer of head for quite some time. Aroma is of orange peel and coriander. Lots of coriander in the taste as well with a slight sugary sweetness. Very refreshing and drinkable. Another outstanding beer from Unibroue."
"There is an awareness of a witbier aroma - slight pepper, slight clove, and slight moist air along with a hint of orange. But the taste is way too subtle to be interesting. There's a witbier lurking around here somewhere, but it's too timid to come out and play. I got some bubblegum, some spice and some wheat, but in a murky and laid back manner. Not sure what Unibroue are after here - a gentle witbier that doesn't offend anyone? I think there's a big difference between playing safe and not playing at all."
"Medium gold color, small head. Apples and vanilla aroma. Malty and very sweet. Some spiciness, not very hoppy. More reminiscent of a cider than a beer. Kind of applish and citrusy. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly spicy. Tasty, but not very beer-like."
"Very drinkable, beautiful beer. At first, this poured a pale yellow, tranparent colour. Then the yeast falls in and it goes to a pale orange. Two finger head that left lacing throughout the glass. Smelled of spice, pepper, dried fruit and wheat. Tastes reminds me of a wheat field. Some floral and citrus hops, orange peel, dried fruit and a little spice. Coriander? And yes, wheat. A fluffy light mouthfeel that leaves you wanting more. Ah very good beer."
"Overall: Another great beer from Unibroue! One of their lighter beers, but not lacking in any area."
"When I drink this beer the first thing I think of is just how remarkably clean and crisp it is. The color, that perfect, nearly translucent, pale, hazy golden-almost pastel (if golden could be pastel) that just begs one to the well. The nose while a little muted offers just enough anteseptic spice especially clove. On the palate the beer acts like a sorbet, cleansing the palate and inviting another gulp or perhaps the next course. I like to drink this at a restaurant bar to get my appetite going for the good food to come. This is a clean as a whistle wheat that is tough to beat. I can see what Great Lakes ""Holy Moses"" was striving for-and I must say (off the subject at hand) they came awful close!!"
"Pours a hazy yellow with a big puffy head that stays around for quite awhile,the aroma is very lemony with a slight smokey hint.This beer is pretty dry with some definant lemony/citruit tones,doesnt have a long finish by any means.Almost to easy to drink,a great beer to drink in the summer."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a hazy golden color with two fluffy fingers of head. There is a little bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is a mix of fruity esters and spices. Light and pleasant on the nose. The taste has some nectarine to it, some spices, and a little diacetyl. The taste is light and crisp. The mouthfeel is fairly nice, a little carbonated. The drinkability is great, and this is a good summer session beer."
"A big ol' 750mL bottle just for little ol' me. Pours with an extremely light yellowish tint and a good deal of haze. Head is a fairly creamy and dense. Aroma is pleasant but one-dimensionally citrus and not nearly as powerful as some other wits. A nice, spiced flavor that presents all the standards -- lemon, coriander, and maybe a little banana. A nice clean finish rounds it out. It's very well carbonated -- kind of like drinking a witbier sparkler. This is undoubtedly one of the better North American wits."
"The smell is fruity, but the taste has more of a citrus quality with a slight biting finish -- crisp, light and dry. It has a light golden color that is a little cloudy and has adequate amount of carbonation. The head starts out well but dwindles fairly quickly. Not a lot of strong flavor, but this is a refreshing summer beer with pleasant Belgian characteristics."
"This brew pours a light cloudy yellow. There is a thick but fast fading head on top of the beer. The head left little lace. The aroma has a hint of citrus and yeast. The taste has the citrus start and the middle is a bit grainy with a slightly bitter/sour finish. There is a lot of carbonation in this beer and it is a light-refreshing brew and went down smooth after getting out my old home brew bottles for Scooter77. Overall, a slight bit above average. I whish it had a bit more in the flavor department."
"Notes-I ordered a CloneKit of this beer from Maltose and will likely add a pound of light DME and decrease the carbonation. Let's see how it turns out:)"
"Poured from a 750ml brown bottle, no freshness date. A pale cloudy gold, it had a big white head to start off with, but it soon dissipated. Yeasty aroma, coriander, a bit of citrus (orange peel?), small amount of sweet malt. Flavour is light and spicy, coriander seed is most predominate followed by a bit of citrus. A decent White, but not the top offering from Unibroue. Still, a decent starter for those who have yet to sample their line, it gets better from here."
"This particular brew poured a large white foamy head with fine-large bubbles that quickly dissolved. There was very little lacing observed on the sides of my glass. There was a slight spicy aroma to this brew. The body was pale yellow. The taste was smooth, thin and watery. In my opinion this Belgian White lacked character as there was nothing special about it."
"This brew poured a very large head of fine to medium sized bubbles that receedes quickly and leaves no lacing. It has a cloudy yellow body with some dark somethings floating it it. It has a mild malt aroma, a nice smooth start with a slightly tingly mouthfeel finish. Very clean taste that is unremarkable. Not bad, more like nothing there. Strangely, overall, I still liked it."
"Appearance a cloudy light yellow...consistent champagne like bubbles. Smell is light and lets you anticipate what the flavor will be like. Taste was light, yet refreshing with just a hint of tartness. Similar to a light beer, but with a lot more flavor. Mouthfeel was smooth, just a tad watery, but the flavor kept it interesting. Extremely easy to drink. After drinking an IPA for my last offering, the contrast was great. Recommend, especially for a warm summer day."
"This takes some getting used to, especially for those who are new to the style. This is one of my first true white beers. I keep wanting to gulp it! It's quite refreshing, quite drinkable, but there is something off-putting about its lightness. I may have to revisit this review after I have had more of this style of beer."
"This was the first Unibroue product I have sampled and I have to say I was very disappointed due to the hype and positive feed back I have heard about the beers that this Canadian Brewery produces. I will just have to sample the five Unibroue beers I have waiting in my cellar."
"Hazy yellow pour, thick, white and long-lasting head which laces nicely. Aroma is yeasty, malty, some banana, lemon and hint of vanilla. Flavor is mainly banana, some bubblegum sneaking in, and a bit of vanilla sliding in at the end. Medium body, lively carbonation. Doesn't seem to have the typical spices of the wit style."
"Pours a thick, very foamy head. Slowly settles down unevenly -- looks good. Pale, yellowish, very light. Rich, hearty aroma. Smells of wheat, not as lemony as many others. Tastes good. Feels a little ""scooty"" in the mouth. Not bad, but not as crisp as some others. Pleasant wheat aftertaste, but it's a little funny. Somewhat bitter. Going to enjoy this one, but I'm not going to rush for another."
"-F"
"Drinkability: Very high...Belgian-style wit's are one of my favorite brews to turn to in the summer heat and humidity when heavier and stronger beers would make me drop. I could drink glass after glass of this..."
"I guess people around here really don't care for wits, because this is a mark above Hoegaarden, Blue Moon, and other well-knowns. Oh well."
"Color is a golden pale yellow, slightly hazy, with a tight bubbly head of frothy foam thats bumpy and about three fingers high. Smell is lemony/orange with a bit of spicyness to it, its quite the sniffer, very strong. Taste is more of the same, lemony/orange sweet with a slight spicyness with a hint of yeast and wheat grain. Its got a light spritzer wine feel and hold thats very citrusy and slightly drying with a dry spiceness. Its a good belgian style wheat that resembles some triples, it's mostly smooth and slightly sweet and tart with a good citrusy kick. Drinkable indeed, but watch out for the sneaky 5%."
"Beer pours cloudy but light, with a good deal of setiment. Slight head which retains good lace. My real problem with the beer was its lacklustre taste. I was much more bland to me than the big two white beers (allagash and hoe). Tasted a bit watery when compareed to those. Still very drinkable and a great one to have if you just love White Beer."
"Having tasted Unibroue's Fin du Monde, I was expecting a lot out of this beer. I bought 5 liter cask on a whim, and drank it with two friends in one sitting. This is a highly drinkable beer, and a beautiful sight to behold, a glimmering golden cloud when held in the light. A very yeasty beer... especially the dregs of the cask! As far as wheat beers go, I would definitely take an Alagash White or a Hoe over this stuff. Just not as exciting as I'd hoped it would be. The taste was citric, but kind of boring. It had a bit of a novelty appeal, coming in a cask, but if I had it to do all over again I'd probably just spend my money on a few big bottles of Fin du Monde, which is a better beer for its style."
"This is an extremely light and refreshing beer from the folks at Unibroue. Pours a cloudy pale, straw yellow color with a light airy head, which leaves a thin lace that clings to the side of the glass. Aromas of citrus and yeast are detected. Flavors of lemon, orange, and mild hops are quite apparent. There was a mild, citrus after-taste in my mouth. If you enjoy the crispness of Wits, you will definitely like this one."
"It has pale malts with breads throughout most of the flavor. The aftertaste is nice and dry with lightly toasted white bread. The flavoring of this beer was weak. I expect a lot from Unibroue because of their excellence in their brews, and this was a little bit of a let down in the flavor category. It is a good drinker. Crisp and clean. It is just a bit boring because of the lack of complexity."
"We had no problem finishing this little cask, but no doubt I would have enjoyed this more had it been July instead of March. Overall this was a solid white beer, but not the best I?ve had, and definitely not the best Unibroue has to offer."
"The smell is strong: very spicy with some citrus. The front is very briefly sweet and almost dominated by the classic Unibroue spice. It turns suddenly dry, with a light middle. The alcohol is noticeable. The finish is crisp and just a little watery. The aftertaste is bitter, freshened by alcohol. Overall it's a good beer. The spice dominates the other good flavors. Can I put a slice of orange in this?"
"Yeah, I just got back from Canada and brought 3 bottles of Unibroue 750ml (La Fin du Monde, Maudite, and Blanche de Chambly) that I picked up for 5 bucks canadian, how great is that. Well, in comparison the 12 oz bottle this one appears a deeper golden haze with same yellow frothing head. Leaves a collar of lace around the head, but no lace is forming evenly througout the glass. The aroma is full of spices, banana, and a slightly citrus tone is also present very pleasant. The flavor is wheat based with many complements tantalizing the taste buds at the same time, such as a bubbly sharp sweetness of citrus mellowed by spices and a banana flavor created by the yeast. The mouthfeel is pretty much similar to some seltzer water with the high carbonation, but after having this mussels steamed in this the other night at Smokeless Joe's I can't get enough of it. Overall very drinkable beer that sits up there with the best witbier in the world my Hoegaarden. Very drinkable especially on tap, and just as easy to drink out of the bottle solid belgian style wit here for all to enjoy."
"If you've never tried a wit before, this is a good place to start. Then try a Wittekerke."
"I have never tasted a Witbier from the United States that comes even close to this beer. Fabulous - a true session beer."
"Very nice offering but I was a bit disappointed as to my expectations."
"This beer poured a cloudy straw color and formed a bubbly white head that subsided leaving trace lace. A small amout of carbonation was present. It had a light aroma of hops, lemon and spice. The flavor was light and crisp with elements of citrus and grain. All in all, not a bad beer for this style, but not to the level that you would expect from this brewery."
"This beer poured to a nice flurry merangue head, and after swirling in the yeast had a nice cloudy golden color. Its smell was of fresh lemon, floral fruits and a yeasty backbone. The taste followed suit with a nice clean and refreshing start that opened up lemon and citrus flavors and a nice wheaty presence. The mouth feel was nice and full for this light style and drinkability is fantastic. Get me going with these on a hot summer day at a cook out and you might have to wheel me home. They go down effortlessly. I love Hoeggarden by the bottle and even better on tab at my local tap room, but this has to be my second favorite wit beer and will make the rotation. I only wish it was priced lower but what are you going to do."
"This is an averahe beer from a stellar brewery. Maybe I have just come to expect to much from these guys. The beer looks lager with a thicker white head and a bit more carbonation. The smell is the usual for the style without a really strong coriander kick. The taste has a more mellow citrus flavor than I would prefer, and overall the flavor department just seems thin. Not very drinkable because of these negatives."
"12 oz. bottle, from the same source as my last Unibroue debacle. No worries here though. Pale yellow color, foamer of a head. Sticky white to beige bubbles, laced the glass nicely. This one is clearly not past it's prime. Nice hop inspired citrus smell. Taste follows, very tart, puckering snap to it. Subtle spices. Creamy sweet malt in the middle. Full bodied for such a crisp refreshing beer. Only the slightest trace of tart fruit taste lingers. Very good, way up on my list as a summer refresher. A small notch below Allagash White, and better than the others in it's class."
"Nevertheless, Quite Exceptional."
"The feel is a tad thin, possibly because of the somewhat low alcohol content? Also leaves a thin, filmy aftertaste but isn't so bad. Kind of plain I must say. Not a bad brew by any means but I was a tad disappointed considering the other Unibroues I have had. Great smell, but very very champagne like in all characteristics. I'd definitely have it again though, but can't see myself putting good money towards it."
"Champagne-like in appearance, clear gold and effervescent, with a billowy, perfectly white head. The aroma is yeasty, with light grapefruit notes and a light, spicy hoppiness. In the mouth this beer is crisp and tingly with a light feel. Flavor contains a light graininess, understated hops, a hint of banana, and a tart citric fruitiness. Finish is dry and long-lasting. I tried this with and without the yeast, and found that it has a bit more depth and body with. A good wit!"
"Opaque grapefruit juice color, creamy head od 1/4 of an inch, not as large as some. Little lacing. A white wine grape nose, some prickly pepper smells. Starts off very fruity, grape, lots of lemon, and some cider qualities. Thins mid mouth, and finishes somewhat dry with carbonation. Some sense of pineapple, especially in the aftertaste, Overall, pretty reserved in flavor profile, a little tight to my tongue with some reminders of carbonated water. Of the Unibroues, this is the most ordinary -- but then Wits are rarely my style."
"Well, this is quite a contrast to the winter beers I've been drinking lately, but that's not such a bad thing, not at all. A hazy white-golden body forms inside of the curved glass, and a thick white foam quickly takes over atop it. Don't pour this one hard! Aroma of strong spices and dried fruit, very nice. Pepper, clove, and raisin to be exact. As for the palate, it's surprising that this beer is so flavorful, having such a light body. The spicy products of the yeast, pepper and clove, are dominant. Dried fruit is underneath. Malt is present, but quite subtle. Hops are more noticeable and add a bit to the spiciness. Just a few banana esters in there. Very well done beer. Perfection for a wit. Quite drinkable, definitely a session beer or a summer refresher. Should also pair easily with fine foods."
"I was out with the wife at a French restaurant when I spied this on the menu. I ordered it, and they delivered it with a glass with a lemon. Sacra Bleau! After I discarded the ""lemon", I poured the beer into the glass. Very light color with a thin white head. The taste was surprising for such a light beer, Good hops and that certain ""Je ne sa qui"" of the Unibroue beers. I made a mental note to myself to remember this beer as the temperatures rise."
"The beer pours a very light somewhat Â“Chill HazedÂ” lemon yellow color, the head Herculean in size, the texture creamy with jumbo sheets of lace clinging mightily to the glass, both a dazzling white. Nose is malt laden, crisp and fresh, citrus tones also present. Front is sweet malt, the top lean with a tart and perilously acidic bite, chased by the pleasing hop spiciness. The aftertaste long lasting and quite dry, quite quaffable, but I tend to like the more robust beers from this brewery, but if youÂ’re into Â“WitÂ” beers, give it a sample."
"Pours a somewhat hazy light golden color with a frothy white head. Lots of carbonation. Light fruit aroma with notes of banana, orange, and lemon. Light and crisp in the mouth with light citrus flavors. Drinkability approaches infinity. This is one of my all-time favorite beers. I prefer the 12oz bottles over the 750ml bottles as they seem to have more flavor."
"Pours a pale yellow colour with an impressive head. This beer has an EXCELLENT smell and quite good taste. Definitely a MUST to try if you haven't already. I don't think though that it will be the best chocie with food"
"Blanche De Chambly: A cloudy yellow beer, with a very white head. Nice floral aroma, and the taste is very sweet and light bodied. A tiny bit of typical Belgian yeast flavor, with bananas. I really enjoyed this beer, a very crisp example of the style, easy to drink and extraordinarily flavorful."
" another."
"To say it's La Fin du Monde's younger brother would be a fair characterization."
"Hazy straw color with a low white head throughout.  Perfumy, fruity aroma.  Tart lemony citrus fruit flavor with a light orange character. I could not detect any spice flavors....   ;-(   Light bodied, almost too airy effervescence (which contradicts the low head)."
"This is a review from the 12 oz bottles.  Clear light gold (hazy of course if you add the yeast, which I did) with a foamy head that settled to a persistant lace.  Aroma is of coriander and citrus.  Has a somewhat citrusy flavor, and the coriander is definately detectable but not strong.  Somewhat thin bodied, with quite a bit of carbonation.  I've come to expect a lot from Unibroue, and this one didn't dissapoint.  An impressive wit."
"I purchased the 4-12 oz. bottles to share with friends.  This beer pours a beautiful head that stands up.  I was suprised how smooth and clean this beer tasted.  The citrus and coriander are prominent in the mouth.  It finishes a bit dry.  I would like to compare the 12 oz bottle with the 750ml bottle.  Another fine beer from a great brewery."
"I poured this beer from a corked liter bottle.  Refresing looking- pale yellow, with a hint of haze, but mostly clear.  A very clean smell, reminded me of a Krystal Weiss.  Sort of a floral/fruity aroma.  This beer is pleasent tasting, with a light yeasty kick, combined with some citrus flavor as well.  Definetely in that white beer range- sort of like a light hefeweizen.  Not my favorite style, I like more traditional weizens, but overall a nice beer to drink with a variety of food- especially in the warmer months."
"A real beauty and a perfect windup to a trio of top notch light beers (see Rebel and Sapporo)"
"Pours a little cloudy straw color with a thick head, bubbles are going crazy up and down.  A citrus flavor pours over palate with delight.  the light malts does overpower the citrus overtones.  this is a great beer, and i will going to canada very soon."
"Pours a hazy, pale yellow color with a big, fluffy white head that retains all the way down.  Great subtle orange peel aromas with some nice spiciness on top of it.  Great smooth orange taste starts the brew off before the spiciness of the cloves takes over and the brewgets a nice tart fruitiness to it at the end.  Nice creaminess and light body make this brew amazingly drinkable.  This is yet another reason why I have to visit Canada again soon."
"Excellent.  Pours with a creamy pale golden colour, and a decent head.  The nose is an impressive coriander and citrus, with a taste that follows up well.  A nice slightly prickly feel in the mouth, and I could certainly drink larger quantities of this.  The best Wit I've had, certainly better than Victory's Whirlwind or Hoegaarden."
"Yellowish in color with a pearly white head which reduced to a lace. Mild spiciness in the nose. Highly carbonated; crisp in the mouth. Taste is like--well, imagine Hoegaarden toned down about three notches. This is the least memorable of the Unibroue beers I've had. Not bad by any means, but not all that interesting."
"A wonderful belgian white - not as malty as some versions I've had, but spiced in such a way that the orange and coriander are distinct without being blatant.  The very-fine carbonation makes it seem a little fizzy, but it's otherwise a perfect aperitif."
"The beer is cloudy and golden orange.  It throws out a hefty white head that you can literally hear fizz away in a minute.  What ends up is a nice ring of head around the glass.  This beer has a nice aroma.  Sweet candy, raw wheat and cinamon.  There is a definite tart flavor in this beer that is stronger than in any other wits I have tasted.  Some tanginess as well.  The spice flavor is not over abundant.  There's the orange peel and something else that is hard to identify.  Something like cardamon or ginger.  This beer has a medium body.  The drinkability is pretty average due to the tartness of this beer.  Not bad, but I've had many a better wits this summer (Gray's, Lakefront, Victory and Hoegarden to name a few.)"
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow with a huge 3 finger white head that I've noticed Unibroue is notorious for.  The head dissipates in the form of perhaps a rootbeer float's head would.  The smell is slightly fruity and yeasty like some lower ranked Unibroue's I've had.  It is a very light bodied brew with a slightly dry finish.  Definitely drinkable.  I'd rate this beer an overall good beer."
"Hazy, pale yellow body with a pillowy, white head that dissipates quickly but never disappears. Smell is of spices with a light malt background. This is a summer beer for me and the light wheat body with a touch of coriander is a thirst quenching treat. A tongue coating peppery finish gives the illusion of a heavier body than the initial sip implies. Unibroue has plenty of butt kicking monsters, but this one is their easier going cousin."
"Poured a hazy lemon yellow, with coarse white foam that disapates almost immediatley. The smell of spices and citrus is a clean plaeasant aroma. The taste of cloves is what I first picked up. A very pleasant and interesting flavor, along with a touch of citrus. Almost a champain style, but beer instead."
"Notes: Part of the yeast was spilled into this sample ... it really added an other complexity to this brew. Not a bad White Ale to be had here, definitely closer to a Belgian White Ale than most American breweries have come. 5% abv."
"The first Belgian Wit that I have tried. The flavor is very refreshing, the ABV is low for an offering from unibroue. I could down several 750ml bottles."
"Cheers to frank4sail for the sample"
"A way below average Belgian Wit style beer, no head retention whatsiever, a bit cloying and sticky, you'd expect more from Unibroue."
"Pours a cloudy off-white, with an average sized white fluffy head. The flavor though not overwhelming is very balanced with moderate levels of sweetness and acidity with a hint of bitterness. The finish is quick and clean. Overall a very refreshing and interesting brew that I enjoyed. I donÂ’t know if it was the food that I was eating at the time, but I prefer (just by a little) a Hoegaarden over the Blanche De Chambly, but still a good White."
"Just a step down from Allagash as far as North American Wit's go.  Unibroue proves once again that it can do no wrong"
"WOW, Head like a fluffy white cloud, sticks to your lips like marshmellow fluff.  Bubbles engulf your tongue as the brew wantingly slides down.  Awesome white beer.  The wife loves it (who never likes MY BEER).  It is the champagne of beers. 5% ABV"
"An awesome white. It's hard to find flaw with any of Unibroue's beers."
"A very interesting white, not as spiced as some, and not as malty as most.  As I drank it, I kept wondering what it was that this sort of reminded me of.  Finally I was able to put my finger on it - a spumante champagne."
