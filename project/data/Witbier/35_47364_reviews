"Gave this beer a higher rating because it was one of the first craft beers I ever had and really enjoyed."
""
""
""
"Too heavy on the blackberry, almost like they added syrup to the beer."
"Great in warm weather, especially at night"

"Hazy golden color, aroma of wheat and blackberry. Flavor is disappointing not a true wit no taste of spice very little citrus just a lot blackberries. Would not buy again."

"O - I went into this review having drank this many times in the past. This is one of my favorite summer thirst quenching shelf beers. I usually don't give it the chance to warm up, but for the sake of the review I let it warm up from my fridge a little. The sub par taste really shines through when warm, still I think this is outstanding as a refreshing summer brew enjoyed cold, but compared to some of the great witbiers brewed locally to me, I do not think this is a good example of the style, blackberry or not."

"O: Sam Adams rarely gets the credit they deserve, and I think the same can be said for fruit infused wheat ales. Definitely recommended for fans of such beers."
""

"Overall - I don't think I'll drink this one again."

"unexpectedly good. Not recommended for lovers of the classic wit style...you will not find any classic witness here."

"Overall, the most enjoyable thing about this brew was its drinkability. Again, in line with our first thoughts on the first sip, this was a surprisingly refreshing brew. We tend to preconceive our thoughts about the “macro” craft producers, but for what it is, they did a nice job here. While this isn’t going to win any awards in our book, they kept it seasonal, fresh, and light enough to keep it flowing. That’s where this beer functions well. The flavored and aromatic inclusions were decent represented in the final product, and blended nicely enough, but you’re going to be drinking this one more for the experience and company of close friends than you are for anything groundbreaking on the palate or brain."

"Overall - This is a pretty good beer, I enjoyed the blackberry sweetness of the beer."
"Poured out of a bottle into a glass, this beer is a gold color that looks like honey. It smells sweet: extremely fruity with a hint of wheat. Sam Adams has a habit of getting things right when it comes to micro-brewed beer. The taste is extremely accurate. Sweet blackberries and fruit with the right amount of wheaty beer taste."

"Nice white, puffy head with good staying power. The usual cloudy witbier look, so nothing too out of the ordinary. I was impressed with the strong blackberry smell, slight tinge of hops to go along with it too. The aftertaste in these types of beer could be awful, but this one was wasn't too bad at all. What surprised me was the syrupy feel in my mouth, silky even. Overall, not one of the best Sam Adams, but decent for a summer-time offering."

"Overall, I'm a little disappointed in the amount of berry flavor delivered in the taste versus the sweet, juicy scent this beer has. Not a bad beer, but there are other fruit beers that are done better."
""
"Opaque yellow appearance with mild head and little carbonation. Very fruity aroma. Th blackberry definitely comes out here. Smells like hot jello right before you put it in the fridge. Yeasty flavor that kind of clashes with the fruitiness of the beer. No outstanding depth. Unfortunately we didn't like it too much due to our opinion that the blackberry fruitiness clashes with the rest of the beer."

"O: It's no Allagash White, that's for sure. But this is a grade-A panty dropper that has some mass appeal. I wouldn't be averse to buying this again for company - and I would easily choose this over, say, Blue Moon."
""
""
""
""
""
"An interesting beer, to say the least. I wasn't overly impressed but not completely discouraged after tasting this. It has the wheat flavours, coupled with the blackberry through out. It's worth a shot, even if to see what it tastes like. Personally, I felt underwhelmed but I can see the appeal."

"very refreshing all season fruit beer. it pours just a tiny bit dusty, mostly blonde, with maybe the faintest purple hue and an average white head on top thats gone in a few minutes. the nose is a little strange, with the fruit sweetness not really coming through at all, and the yeast and wheat malt being more dominant. not until the flavor can you tell its a fruit beer, the blackberry is strong and forward, without being too sweet at all. its summery and fresh, while being wintery and preserved at the same time, i like this beer because its one of the few in the genre that i think retains its drinkability for all 12 months. the finish is a little dry, with the yeast imparting just a hint of citrusy acidity and pep. nice feel, light in body with strong carbonation. its refreshing and satisfying and i much prefer this to most other fruity infused wheat beers out there."

"Pours a hazy honey orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, berries, and a slight vomit aroma. Taste is much the same with a mild tartness and thankfully no vomit flavor. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer that is drinkable but not something I would go for again."

"The aromas are mostly fruity and berry-like with a light malty backbone and a hint of spice. Flavors are similar -- fruity, spicy, berry flavors dominate while the malt adds some light bread background -- but the more generic berry aroma seems more specifically blackberry upon tasting. A bit too sweet for me, but about as expected on this count. Somewhat unappealing aftertaste."

"O:  I love the idea but the wit was not broadcast as well as it should have been. Aggressive blackberry and under achieved wit flavors. Not a huge fan (as a witbier)but it's really easy drinking. I think my wife would love this. Something I wouldn't buy again for myself but maybe for the lovely lady at home.  Should have just marketed as a fruit beer. "
""
""
""
""
""
"This ends up being a decent, inoffensive fruit beer that is pleasantly refreshing. Although labeled as a witbier, I didn't detect any notes that would lead me to belive that this was brewed with wheat. As a fruit beer, it does the job."
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer was a miss. It just didn't quite work. I think it would have worked better if it were a little bit sweeter (some of the other viewers say this beer is too sweet, which I just don't get. Maybe I got a weird bottle?)"

"O: Although this beer is easy to drink and might appeal to some type of people (such as those that like sweet fruity lambics), I thought that the blackberry taste seemed a little too pronounced and artificial."

"The beer pours a hazy piss yellow with an ever so slight hint of blue that makes the beer seem like a grayed yellow, almost like a corn syrup. The head poured thin and cream white, but dissipates very quickly leaving a thin wall of lacing. The smell is a nice bouquet of light blackberry and light wheat with an interesting spice lying below. The wheat-stink is definitely the dominant smell though. The beer tastes thick with a lovely mix of the wheat malty-sweet and the more sour-sweet of the blackberries. Slight citrus seems to be hiding in the back of the flavor, and nicely rounds the beer giving it a ghost of a bitter hint. The aftertaste is a lovely light lingering of the berries in your mouth. Mouthfeel is a little strange with very fierce carbonation that leaves a burn on the tongue but other than that the mouth is very clean and slightly dry with a wetter feel on its roof. The beer is slightly creamy in feel with a good lighter beer feel hidden underneath the harsh carbonation. Overall this is a very decent more mass produced beer. It is actually one of my favorite berry-based beers, I think, as they got the berry taste wonderfully mixed with the witbier style and I don’t really care if they used real berries or berry syrup. This beer is worthy of a try."

"better taste than expected. nice wheat with fruity taste. doesnt seem to have the same old hop style as all the other sam adams brews and is slightly surprising. some bitterness in the aftertaste, but it was to be expected from this brand. i havent met a supremely astonishing taste character yet from this brewer...."
""
""

"While Samuel Adams Blackberry Witbier smells great and has a really nice mouth feel, it's really just an average beer ... especially after a few sips when the blackberry seems to disappear. Personally, I could never drink more than one bottle in a session ... Good, but not spectacular."
"The beer pours a hazy golden-orange color with a white head. The aroma has a little bit of wheat, but what is really standing out is a very sweet blackberry component. The flavor is also full of extremely sweet, and somewhat cloying, blackberry fruit notes. There is some wheat, and maybe a hint of coriander, but the fruit is front and center. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours hazy golden with a two-finger length white head. Tiny bubbles can be seen streaming from the bottom of the glass. Lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. Sweet blackberries dominate the smell. I can also pick up some of the faint malt aroma as well. Blackberry hits the mouth at the beginning with the clean wheat malt taste coming through at the back. There is little hop flavor. There is some coriander as well. The flavors complement each other well. The body is light to medium with adequate carbonation. It is smooth and refreshing. The drinkability is high. Overall, this is a very good beer. If you're looking to experiment with fruit beer, picking this up as a single isn't a bad idea."
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a pale gold. Small white head. Nose is fruity with blackberry jam, faint grassy notes. Mouth is crisp with plenty of carbonation, but not too harsh. Lots of blackberry in the flavor, but not too sweet. Faint spice profile adds a slight spiciness that balances out the fruity sweetness well. Not bad. Refreshing beer."
""
""

"Refreshing, flavorful and perfect after a long day of unloading boxes. I'm glad I tried it, will re-visit from time to time - 4s across the board."

"Pours a slightly hazy golden orange in color, with a thin off-white head. Smells of a hint of blackberries. Taste begins with a hint of ghost blackberry sweetness, then following is an interesting pecan flavor, and then some bready, toasty flavor. A hint of tart blackberry in the finish. Mouthfeel is sort of light. Overall a decent beer, though a bit more fruit flavoring than I typically like in a beer. I really wouldnt want more than one 12oz serving in a session."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - An interesting take on a witbier. I'd like to see a bit more aggressiveness with the flavors, but that's not necessarily true to the style. Regardless, I love the wheat and blackberry pairing."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this isn't a bad beer. I've had it before but wanted to put out a fair review while I've had it recently. I'd have this again, preferably on tap."

"Few American-made witbiers impress me, this is no different. Not sure if blackberry is a fruit I'd add to one. But, it has a pleasant aftertaste and grows on you as it warms. 3.5"

"Pours to a creamy white head and generous lace. Color is deep gold with very little haze (I did not roll the bottle). Aroma is a combination of creamy malt and berries. Flavor is fruity and sweet mix of wheat, coriander and blackberries. Mouthfeel is light and CO2 is strong. Overall, I think this is a tasty refreshing beer that appeals to those who like fruity drinks."
""
"My first ever Wit. This one poured deep golden with a very small head. Aroma of spice and sweet sweet sweetness with only a hint of the berries. Flavor follows very much on the sweet side, wheat, honey, berries, some very faint yeasty characteristic. Dirty finish. Mouthfeel was a little heavy with some artificial taste to this. Lots of berries on the flavor, like syrup. Enough carbonation to lighten things up and make them relatively drinkable. OK."
"Pretty good flavored brew! Not really much on the fruity blends but this was nice. The appearance bout what you would expect from a wheat brew, anyway the taste is very basic with lots of fruity flavors perfect to introduce to a lady friend maybe. Mouthfeel is light and overall I would pick it again in a pick six!"

"O: This is a solid fruit beer. I like the blackberry flavor – refreshing and tasty."
"O: This is not the worst berry beer I've had, but it's certainly not the best, either. If you really like blackberries, I suggest having a blackberry flavored vodka. Stop putting your berries in my beer."

"O - This is about what I expected it to be: an average witbier overpowered by blackberries."
"Overall Drinkability - I'm not sure there's really a good way to make this beer. Having the flavor any thinner would make it seem weak and watery, but having it as strong as it is sort of drowns out the wheat and makes the concoction feel over flavored. There's no good way to balance it. If you don't like"

"I am going with one of my S. Adams' Perfect Pint glasses since that seems like a perfect idea to me. The two foamy, fizzy fingers of eggnog-colored head evidenced decent retention.Color was a deep-yellow with a lot of suspended floaties which I imagined was the spices. Nose was rich in blackberry, no doubt, but it was also kind of sweet for my liking. Mouthfeel was on the thin side and the taste was less sweet than what I had anticipated. Instead, the tartness of the wheat gave a nice counterbalance to the fruity sweetness. Finish was semi-sweet and while it was refreshing, one would be plenty for me. It might be nicer in the summer heat, but I just was not feeling it on this chill rainy evening."
""
""
"O: I recall trying this beer very shortly after it was released and being blown away by it. My intial impressions have changed in the past year or so. This beer seems to have become grittier and the blackberry flavor now seems a bit artificial. For what it is, it's not bad, but I wouldn't reach for it on a regular basis."

"Comments: Samuel Adams Blackberry Witbier may miss the mark for a Witbier, but it is a tasty, very enjoyable beer."
"O: The blackberry taste is too artificial for my tastes, even if they did use real blackberries. Definitely a beer for beginners or women who enjoy sweet fruity beers"
"GOOD, WORTH HAVING!"
"O-very drinkable but not a lot of complexity in this one"
"Not interested in getting this again."
"Overall, very respectable. Not a huge fan of fruit flavor beers, but no qualms with this one. Maybe a bit on the sweet side, but that's quibbling."
"O: Pleasant, and good with a savory meal, but not good enough to drink on its own just for the pleasure of it."
"The Sammy A Blackberry Wit is very nice and I am not normally a fruity beer type. The beer pours a hazy golden color with a 1 finger white foam head that dissipates into a thin foam film then ring. A medium amount of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Nice lacing left behind. Smells of blackberry and wheat with the blackberry very dominate. Has a sweet smell. Tastes of blackberry that is not nearly as sweet as the smell would indicate. A nice wheat taste on the backend really help balance out the sweetness. The mouthfeel is Medium to light bodied with a slighly creamy mouthfeel. Probably one of my favorite fruit beers. I would highly recommend this beer."
"I think this is an interesting twist at a witbier. I really enjoyed it because I had to step out of my box of for this beer. Blueberry is not often found this style. Yet the Boston brewing company has made this work."
"D - Solid example for the style. Complex and drinkable, I'd come back to this one."
"Am intrigued by ""fruit"" beers and love blackberry so I had to try it. Poured into a pilsner glass and inhaled the blackberry aroma. As stated by others, not a lot of head, lacing minimal and dissapears rather quickly, but the taste was awesome! I agree it had a rather thin mouth-feel but it was refreshing and went great with some Mexican food I was having. I found this at World Market and I could see this as only being available in niche markets. I will buy this again if I can find it!"
"O- If you like very fruity beers this is a nice drinkable beer. It is light and refreshing, however the fruit is very powerful. This is a great option for those who like beers that don't ""taste like beers", or those looking for an alternative to the common beer with something fruity. Fruit is slightly artificial tasting to those who don't like diet coke (if you know what I mean)."
"o - Overall a pretty good witbier. The blackberries definitely come through and the taste reminded me of that blackberry seltzer water. Girlfriend liked it too, I'd give it another shot."
"This is distinctly berry flavored and crisp. Perfect served ice cold on a hot Summer day. ( Hence , I suppose it's inclusion in the summer Variety pack!)"
"Overall – One of the few fruit beers that I might be able to drink more than one of at a sitting. The fruit taste isn't too obnoxious.. I'm not a big fan of fruit beers, but I'm happy I gave this one a chance."
"Poured from a bottle into a pils glass, the beer pours a golden copper color, with a very sparse, thin film of head. Very tart and sweet aromas, almost syrupy sweet, with a good baseline of toasted oats. Flavors are sharp and sugary, with a slightly tart berry flavor initially, and a roasty toasty cereal backbone. The beer is light and crisp, with a steady flow of medium to high carbonation throughout. The aftertaste is slightly dry and bitter tart, with fruity notes abundant. The finish is puckering and dry, with a slight cloying aspect. Great on a hot day."
"Overall: It's not terrible; definitely not my cup of tea, but not terrible. Stick to straight ales and lagers, Sam."
"Rather weak witbier. The blackberries are a nice difference, but the beer is too light and thin."
"O- I won't be buying this one again... But I would gladly accept one offered to me as it's drinkable and has some nice berry aspects as expected."
"O: Generally I don’t prefer too much sweetness in a beer, but the character of this brew demands it. Slightly artificial tasting, and definitely not a binge beer due to the sugary taste that lingers after the first round. Not an everyday choice, but I’d not turn it down if it were offered"
"Random trivia: I visited the Sam Adams Brewery in Boston when the brewers were trying out Blackberry Witbier, along with a Coffee Stout, on visitors, asking them to vote for their favorite. The winner would get put into production. I voted for the stout (for the reasons listed above), and obviously my side lost. Shame, too; the stout was excellent."
"O : Overall this is a some what decent beer, but too fruit and needs more balance."
"D - Overall a pleasant, fruity wheat beer for the summer time, but nothing that really reminds me of a witbier. Not bad for what it is, though I probably wouldn't be buying it outside of the summer variety pack."
"With my German heritage and lifelong love of beer, I believe in the Rheinheitsgebot. This witbier brodened my horizons. It smells wonderful and looked good in a pilsner glass. Good carbonation and color. After a 90 degree day, this was one of the most enjoyable beers I have ever had. The wheat provided a crisp, clean foundation for the blueberry without being too sweet. It left a refreshing and clean aftertaste with no sweet fruitiness. Easy to drink more than one. Another reason to be glad that Sam Adams was a brewer and patriot!"
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with an October (2011) expiration date. Sampled on July 9, 2011. The pour is golden yellow with good clarity and short lived fizzy white head. The distinctive blackberry aroma is omnipresent with only a slight whiff of wheat, malts, and hops in there. The body is thin to medium. The taste is alive with blackberries, a little spice, and a light hopped ending. This would be a nice beer for a summertime bonfire but not something I would drink regularly."
"Mouthfeel: The best part of this beer. An excellent level of carbonation and drinkability."
"Overall - A good beer, though it leaves a bit to be desired."
"O- A very nice offering from Sam Adams, the wheat and blackberry flavor are just right."
"Good carbonation, nice blend, good use a fruit, blends nicely in the wit."
"One of my favorite fruit beers. I would highly recommend this beer. It is a solid way to get into the world of craft beers or different styles of beers for someone who is just getting thier feet wet."
"o: Fruit beers are not my cup of tea, but this is a refreshing beer I could throw back all day. Well done Sam!"
"O- this beer isn't really doing it for me, the smell is the best part and even that is just about avg. This was light, a bland sweetness(if that makes sense) and when the berry flavor did show it up it reminds me of a cough syrup flavor"
"Not over done and it seems like Koch actually put in some time when he and his crew created this beer. Decent beer for a summer day."
"This was surprisingly good compared to my admitted unfair preconceptions. Hazy golden color, head is not substantive, lasts a short time. a bit of lacing. Scent was best part, summer wheat and blackberries. A decent lawnmower beer. Taste was a bit off for me, it would have been better if it had tasted like it smelled. Mouthfeel was ok, a bit dry. Overall, a passable beer."
"This beer pours out as cloudy yellowish color with a white foamy head that dissipates quickly. The armoa of the beer is sweet and full of fruit. The subtle smell of wheat is in there too. The taste is sweet as well with a pretty good blackberry flavor. The aftertaste is a mix of the fruit and the grainy wheat flavors. The mouhfeel is light and might be a decent choice for summer drinking."
"The Rest: A friend brought over a summer mix pack and the only two beers left were the Blackberry Wit's. Unfortunately, it confirmed my stereotype of fruits beers in that its a not very good base beer that tastes like they poured fruit syrup into it."
"Pours light golden color with a small head. Strong blackberry smell. Tastes of blackberries but still tastes like a beer. Just a very berry version of a beer. Quite a bit of carbonation. Blackberry lingers long after the beer is swallowed. I like this beer because the blackberry doesn't taste artificial and it still tastes like a beer rather than a fruity drink. I have had this before this review and I continue to drink it during summer months. I think even a non fruit beer drinker could enjoy this, IMO."
"Pours a pale orange color with a two finger white head. Retention is not very impressive and there is no lacing. The smell is of light wheat and artificial blackberries. Taste startw with the fruit sweetness and transitions to the wheat backbone. Mouthfeel is average for a wit, but the carbonation is a little aggressive. Overall this was a decent effort by Boston Beer Co, but I didn’t find it terribly impressive."
"Pours cloudy golden in color with a weak off-white head. Looks to be very well carbonated. There is just a few spots of lacing. Smell mainly of black berries. Also some very faint wheat malts. You have to really dig for it though. The black berry aroma takes over the nose. In the taste the black berries are toned down. There is a little more wheat and some grainy characters with the black berries being more of middle/background. Almost the complete opposite of the nose. Did the flip flop shit on me. Finishes with a sour berry flavor. Mouth feel is medium to light body with crisp carbonation. A summer beer for sure. Very clean feel to it. Good beer over all. I kinda liked the opposites in the nose and taste. I'm ok with the overly obvious berry flavors and smells too. Even though they were a bit over to top. Didn't disappoint me like maui coconut porter. I think if the title of a beer names an ingredient, that ingredient should be obvious. All in all this is a very drinkable beer. Especially on a hot 105 degree day."
"Overall: I don't think blackberry works with witbier all that well as I've yet to have a fruit-added witbier that does it for me. Varying the citrus peel is a good place to start if you're innovating this style but really its a case of ""if its not broke, don't fix it."" Might be a good introduction beer for people who don't actually like beer, but this is one that I will not be having again. Cheers."
"Pours slightly hazy, golden amber. Thin (~ 1cm) head, quickly dissipating, with slight lacing. First aroma is of berry, with a hint of citrus. Taste is the same, subtle hint of blackberry, but quickly fading into a light citrus flavor. Feels thin, yet smooth. Overall, a decent beer; one I could enjoy with a steak dinner or over a game of cards with friends. I do wish the blackberry element had been slightly more pronounced, instead of appearing as an ""also-ran."""
"O- Not ridiculously impressed, not better than my everyday fall back beer. It is decent, seems to taste more like a normal Belgian which I would rather buy from someone who is known for their Witbeir. My main problem was the lack of blackberry."
"O- Nothing thats really impressing here but as a nice sessionable beer with some black berry flavor it works pretty well."
"O: Was not impressed with this one and didn't think it was a good example of the style. I didn't hate it or think it's highly undrinkable, there's just better beers out there. I don't think I will get it again. I only had one, spouse had one and poured it out halfway through."
"O - Overall, I love the smell but the taste is a bit off. This is a fine beer for a hot summer day, but that's the only time I would drink it."
"O - Overall, good beer. If you're looking for blackberry, look no further. I would prefer over Abita Purple Haze anyday."
"D - Very drinkable. Not going to say it is the most balanced beer out there, but the blackberry flavor is nice and I am really enjoying the flavor."
"O-When I first had this beer (about a year and a half ago) I though it was the best thing out there. I've found better since then, but this still a great introduction beer and highly sessionable."
"The mouthfeel is nice, it's very smooth and highly carbonated. The drinkability, of course, is off the charts. That's what a well-done fruit addition will do. A great fruit beer from Sam Adams and one that I'm glad is widely available. Berry much better than Cherry Wheat."
"-6th and moore distributor, Philly 2010 summer"
"I like the Sam's Cherry Wheat much more than this one. It is a decent beer, but not a choice witbier."
"Perfect beer for an outdoor get together when its 90 degrees outside."
"This one belongs in the ""failed experiment"" bin at Sam Adams along with their Cranberry Lambic, Fake Cherry Wheat, and most of that ""imperial"" series. Also bet this one, like the Cherry Wheat, was made with sugary-sweet artificial blackberry syrup. Gak!"
"Overall, this was a good fruit wit."
"O: A let down from the old standby Sam Adams. Not one of the better offerings."
"D: A couple on a sunny day could be nice. Not something I would actively pursue, though, unless you really like fruity beers."
"Drinkability is ok, it' inoffensive and refreshing, but not something I'd see out or go for again."
"D=Can drink 1-2 of these in a row...may get sick of them after that."
"Poured yellow-orange in color with a large fizzy white head that had virtually no lacing.The aroma was that of light bready malts moderately sweet with a heavy blackberry odor. It tasted of sweet malts with a strong blackberry finish that only lasted a short time. Mouthfeel was light with a watery texture. Overall not a bad beer but not a great one either."
"Dr: Excellent price for the quality."
"Surprisingly refreshing for a fruit-labeled witbeer. Will make an effort to grab again in the future."
"Not my favorite but pretty much exactly what I had expected, which says a lot for this brewer."
"The first beer poured into my Noble Pils pilsner glass. Pours with a thin head that quickly recedes above a slightly hazy golden-orange body. The smell is like a dry raspberry/blackberry seltzer. Throw in a slight malt sweetness and some hop bitterness and there's your taste. It's pretty gassy and prickly on the tongue. Decent at best, not something I'd consider worthy of the Brewmaster's Collection."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Very easily drinkable; but just boring and bland. Very light bodied. One of Sam Adams worst offerings."
"Not altogether bad, but not among my Sam Adams favorites."
"i really love wheat beers. this one is right up in there. smooth with a nice berry finish. in the past i drove about 8 miles to a store that carried this, however they just built a store close to my house that carries the blackberry witbier. this makes me very happy- the beer itself is very refreshing and delicious, its one of my altime favorites."
"I've been trying more witbiers lately, odd for the season I know, but it's a craving I had. Sam Adam's blackberry witbier hit a chord with me. It has a nice balance between the berry and spices, and it has that crisp wheat taste. Smell is dominated by blackberry, but is not overpowering. Pours a classic hazy white-yellow that is common with witbiers, with a nice finger and a half white head that has lacing. Drinkability is good, but it is a bit dry and would make it hard to down more than a few at a time. Taste, has stated, was good. I personally found it very appealing, even if it wasn't the best witbier I've had. Overall I would definitely get more of these, very nice brew."
"OVERALL: A nice, dry take on the witbier that I enjoyed and would recommend in limited quantities."
"One of Sam Adams better wheat beers. Take that with a grain of salt because Sam Adams doesn't make amazing wheat beers (with the exception of the Summer Ale and Winter Lager, if of course you even consider the Winter Lager a wheat beer). With that being said, it was a good beer. I didn't find the blackberry to be too overpowering, but it was very present. I think it was a good balance, definitely not as overpowering as the cherry wheat is. The color is very pretty, it's cloudy and tan, but also has a hint of that purple blackberry color. Smell isn't anything special. Taste was good though, as I said, not too overpowering. The wheat is there and is balanced nicely with the blackberry."
"D - Pretty tasty and a nice price, but too fruity and dry to drink all night..."
"Verdict: Light, crisp taste, heavy blueberry aftertaste and some bizarre macro flavors that I can't call out but aren't pleasing to me. I would name an alternative blackberry beer but nothing comes to mind, meaning that blackberry lovers get what they can find... unfortunately, beggars can't be choosers! Certainly not the best Samuel Adams I have had but if you like wheat beers, light tastes and pungent Blackberry flavors than linger on your palate for hours after drinking... well, you have few other options. C (2.95)"
"D: Different from typical wits, but I enjoy every six pack I can get my hands on. The berry taste is refreshing and not overwhelmingly sweet...Cheers"
"Justin again hooked me up with another from his variety packs so thanks again man! Poured into a pint glass. The beer pours with a lively body that is a hazy golden straw color with about a finger of white head that fizzes away into nothing pretty quickly. Thin runny lace. I can easily smell the blackberry but it's kind of got an artificial sweetener smell. Kind of like sugar free bubble gum. This kind of overshadows any other aroma. Just sweet fake blackberries. The taste again kind of follows the aroma but a little bit better. It doesn't taste as artificial but a bit blackberry and a grainy aftertaste. Not a bad wit by any means. It's got a really light refreshing mouthfeel. And this goes down easy, nothing offensive in the end but I just don't dig the artificialness to this one."
"This was a decent Sam Adams. Very drinkable, very little hoppiness and light in flavor with ever so slight tartness aftertaste from the berries. Some of the more recent brews I've tried from the Sam Adams line are better than ones of past years. I definitely recommend this one from Jim."
"I wish I could find this more often, it is delicious."
"M/D: Medium bodied and easy drinking. A little too sweet for me, but not terrible. Just not one for me."
"This beer seems to fall short of the style and is pretty boring. It's at least average in drinkability, because there is not much to ponder about concerning this beer."
"Pours golden yellow with a semi-sticky head that turns into a ring. Not a lot of action here. Smell is outwardly tart and berry-like. The taste has a somewhat grassy base, but is dominated by berries - blackberry and blueberry. Feel is creamy and maybe a bit thin, but suitable. finishes with a sweeter berry taste and is easily drinkable. This beer is very comparable to Leinie's Sunset Wheat, but imo is much better."
"Finally getting around to this when I could buy a single - I haven't been optimistic enough to invest in a six pack. Overall, one of those beers where you take a sip and say, ""well, not bad."" Bright wheat malt and natural blackberry notes in the background. Although fruit flavor in a beer like this is best handled with a reserved hand, I would have liked just a touch more of the blackberry flavor to shine through and give it more distinction."
"I would take a Blackbeary Wheat by Longtrail over this. Just doesn't hit me the way I want it to."
"12 oz bottle. Hazy golden hue with a white foamy head and lovely carbonation. Aroma of grassy hops with hints of fruit. Medium, crisp body. Taste is sweet fruit (not cloying) with hops and bready malt provide nice balance. Medium fruity finish. Nice, refreshing beer."
"Pours hazy orange, with short lived white head. Aroma of berries and malt. Taste is malt with a slight berry note. Palate is light body and crisp with moderate carbonation. Finish is fruity with some light tartness. Overall a nice refreshing summer beer."
"It's pretty easy to drink. Moderate alcohol and crisp, you could make an evening of these."
"One of the better flavored beers. Pours and looks great. Aroma is pleasing and adds to anticipation of tasting it. To me it has just the right combination of balance. Taste of wheat that gives way to the berries without being sweet or overpowering. The berry flavor just barely lingers on the palate. This would make a great summertime beer on a hot day. Recommended."
"Overall: This beer has a crisp, light flavor, which is appropriate for the style."
"This beer pours a clear, light gold with little head. The nose is predominantly blackberry with a bit of wheat in the background. The taste is a bit of wheat over the palate giving way to a blackberry fade. It's got a thin mouthfeel. The beer may have been spoiled, there were chunks of sediment in the bottle. Sediment is expected in a hefeweizen but not in a witbier. Not sure what caused this or if I recommend it."
"D- This is a decent fruity wheat overall. Not as good as I remember the Boysenberry from yrs ago (which was at the beginning of my craft beer sampling-so I am sure my tastes have changed) but nonetheless this is still palatable. It could have more of a witbier presence and be a shade less soapy and more bready."
"This one pours a cloudy yellow color with a light head that left no lacing on the glass. The aroma is definitely that of blackberries. It smells sweet and there is a little hint of wheat to it as well. The taste is quite dominated by blackberries. Just like the nose suggested it is sweet and there is some wheat and grains present, maybe some citrus aslo. The mouthfeel was alright, it went down decent and had some crispness too it. It was decently drinkable. I don't think I will be going back to pick up more of these, but I think its worth a try."
"I like the Sam's Cherry Wheat much more than this one. It is a decent beer, but not a choice witbier."
"D - This is a simple fruit beer. It is well made and has no flaws, but I don't think it is true to its base style and has no complexity. There is nothing to hold my interest or make me want another."
"All in all, this is a quite refreshing beer and a great departure from the IPA's and RIS' that I usually drink. Then again, I'm a fan of good tasting fruit beers."
"I really enjoyed this beer and plan to get more when the chance presents itself."
"Pours a cloudy yellow color with a light tan head. In the aroma, sugary berries. In the taste, dry to start and then quite sugary with a light berry taste all the way through. A small bite and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a dry, sugary berry in the aftertaste. Quite sugary, nothing fantastic."
"D: Good while it lasts but a somewhat acrid finish makes me think I wouldn't want more than two of these in a row."
"Im usually not a big fan of lambics and ciders and fruit ales, but wow is this good! I got one of the old Sam Adams variety packs, and gave it a try, and was I ever shocked. The beer itself is light, hearty and not too fruity. The alcohol is hiden by the fruit taste and not bitter or too sweet."
"Appearance is a hazy yellow orange with a quick dissapating thin head leaving scant lace. Smell has a light sweetness of the blackberries mixed with a grainy wheatness. Taste does not have that over the top blackberry sweetness and is in good balance with the wheat. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. A refreshing twist on a Witbier."
"Summary: This is an average beer. I gave it a 7.1/10, or a C-. Not what I was expecting, but I guess I really didn't know what to expect from a blackberry flavored beer. I really like the smell. I think this would be a good holiday beer or a dessert beer. I would definitely drink another."
"The flavor profile favors the fruit over the beer. Grain and wheat notes take a backseat to the berry. Decent body, fairly smooth, and with a sweet, long finish. Too much of the sugary coating over the witbier spiciness, but flavorful."
"I don't much care for this one. It's drinkable, but can't imagine ever drinking this again. It could be a lot worse, I suppose."
"Doesn't drink very well, the fruit flavor overpowers everything, and there's too much carbonation."
"All in all, it's sort of boring but it doesn't taste bad. I probably wouldn't go back to this often for the simple reason that I prefer the taste of regular wits to this. I also miss the coriander in most wits that's missing here."
"D = a good summer beer, i would drink more than one if not for the soap but that could have been a glass thing"
"Pours a pale yellow color with a fizzy white head. Aroma is sort of musty and dusty with some sweet berry notes. Some faint citrus and grains. Pretty authentic blackberry flavor here, very ripe-tasting. Reminds me somewhat of berry pie in its sweetness. The witbier comes through a little bit in the finish with a slightly citric tinge and a dry coriander note. Clearly the witbier aspect is not the focus here, and without the blackberries this would be a subpar attempt at the style. A little too watery and sweet, but that's what they're aiming for. For a fruit wheat beer this is surprisingly decent."
"This turned out to be a nice deviation from the norm, and a surprising favorite out of my (slightly dated) summer sampler!"
"While it's called Blackberry Witbier I can't quite find the blackberry in taste or smell. It does pour a golden yellow color and drinks very similar to a wheat beer like Bud's Golden Wheat, except this as a much fuller taste. Something smooth enough to drink 3-4 of and enjoy."
"Taste is reserved, with plenty of berry flavor tnd the light grassiness from the wheat. it's decent but pretty straightforward. A little bit of bread or biscuit note in the aftertate but overall, what you see is what you get. The mouthfeel is delicate without being too thin, which helps this beer retain some class. Not something I'd run out and get but maybe Sam's best fruit beer, for whatever that's worth."
"Libation: It's too sweet, too fruity, too tart, too grainy and isn't a witbier. It's not awful, but I'm not coming back."
"D - Good for a party, but not something I would want everyday."
"This one is a light, easy drinking beer. At the first pour it had a nice head, but the head quickly dissipated with very little froth. It's appearance is slightly cloudy with a lemon yellow hue. The blackberry aroma is the most obvious, but after a minute the faint wheat and grain aroma come through. On the palate it is light and smooth, typical of a wheat beer, but the blackberry comes through on the back part of a sip leaving a slightly odd, unrefreshing aftertaste."
"This beer is similar to SA Cherry Wheat in that they both emphasize fruits as the main taste. If you're a fan of SA Cherry Wheat, go ahead and try this one, I don't think you'll be disappointed."
"That said, I would rate it somewhere in the C+/C- range. Not a brew I could take multiple pours of, but a nice transition beer."
"Disappointing pour, very little trace of a head, even though there seems to be quite a bit of carbonation. Thin lace left on the mug from each level where the surface of the beer was before the last mouthful. Color is a slightly cloudy dark yellow, an 8 on the SRM chart. Wonderful smell, trace of blackberry and orange with sweet malt. Just enough carbonation to give my mouth a zing. Very tasty, nothing harsh, sweet berry, with a touch of citrus and sweet malt. Good after taste of berries. I would not drink this all the time, but very good change up. I would recommend this beer for a pleasant change from the normal."
"D: A very drinkable summer beer. Goes down nice & easy. A great thirst quencher. I can't believe the ABV is 5.50%. This seems like it could make for an admirable summer session ale, but I'm not sure whether or not I would tire of the blackberry & currant taste."
"Drinkability: I can't see myself buying a six pack of this, but I'm glad I tried it. It went very well with a BLT sandwich on a warm day....but I'm not sure about having it alone. I've had better, but this combination of tart fruit and witbier do go well together."
"Overall a nice summer beer. I understand some of the hate, as it is a bit simplistic and doesn't resemble a classic witbier in the slightest, but its a pretty tasty brew."
"D - Too much fake blackberry, one and done for me."
"Taste, kind of fell apart, again, too much fruit taste, just wanted a little bit, no hops, just a a fruit beer that you're glad you only tried in a variety pack. At least its better than the lambic."
"Overall: Another ""meh"" flavored beer from SA. Not bad but not good either."
"Not a big fan of this one, but it's drinkable. I thought it was a bit on the flat side and lacked a decent berry profile. I expect more of a fruit profile if the fruit is in the name. Sweet and low bitterness, perhaps a bit too sweet. Would have liked to have seen more carbonation. Probably won't buy another 6 pack, but I finished off the one we picked up just to try."
"d- okay, not really my thing though, i'd rather belly up to a pint of fresh blackberries than drink them in my beer. contrary to popular belief, not all girls are into fruity beers - give me a face melting ipa or a big black stout any day. preach."
"This beer goes down pretty quickly, and there is nothing wrong with it; beyond that, don't expect too much."
"Blackberry Witbier poured a darker amber color, with a small head. It smelt very sweet, and had a strong blackberry smell to it. The taste was similair it was very sweet, and very strong blackberry flavors, the beer flavors didnt come through much at all. It was very easy to drink, and most non beer drinkers would probaily find enjoyment out of this one. Overall I enjoyed this beer, but it had no witbier flavors."
"Drinkability- 4 out of 5. I had heard mixed reviews about this beer, but I'm very pleased with it overall. It's not particularly complex, but it's not one-dimensional either. With the pleasant flavor and 5.5% ABV, it would be easy to knock back quite a few of these."
"I prefer my witbier ""straight"" - please. No fruit in my witbier...that is just me. Despite my personal preferences Sam Adams Blackberry Witbier is not a bad brew for ""what-it-is""."
"Very refreshing brew from Samuel Adams, and their best beer made with fruit."
"It poured a nice golden color with a nice one inch white head and it lay down to a nice thin lace around the edge. Very nice smell of fresh blackberry. A nice taste of blackberry, not overpowering and not fruity at all. I think it is a very well balanced beer and in my opion a very drinkable beer."
"I have to say that Sam Adams doesn't impress me. I give them credit for trying so many variations, but the truth is they're really only good at making boston lager. In my opinion, every beer I've tried from them is a clone of Boston Lager, with a twist."
"Notes: Sam Adams decided to focus on the blackberry instead of the witbier here. They did a very good job at making real tasting fruit notes. However, the beer itself is almost flavorless."
"Meh...it is drinkable, but nothing is outstanding. No bad if you want something you semi-refreshing and easy to chug!"
"D- OK as a refresher beer. Doesn't really fit into any meal, but fine as a snack by itself"
"D: I am not one for fruity beers, but I could drink a few of these. I am kind of thinking this beer would taste good with Leinekugel's Summer Shandy."
"Very drinkable. I was tempted to run back to the store and pick up more but decided against it only due to work the next morning."
"kind of hard to finish with such strong fruit flavors. would not seek this one out again."
"D - Drinkability is the strong suit of this beer. An excellent hot weather drinker, nice fruity flavors, nothing overpowering. Certainly not my favorite in the style, but easy on the taste buds."
"Drinkability is good, this is a very refreshing vitamin water drink"
"D: This was a very light and refreshing beer that was quite easy to drink. Like Blue Moon with berries added, and cleaner. I don't know if I'll ever crave this again, but it was nice to try once. I just wish it tasted more naturally sweet and blackberry-tastic."
"Drinkability: If you like blackberries and don't mind fruit in your beer, then by all means try this one on for size. Would think this one would go great with smoked meats, as the sweetness of this beer would be a perfect compliment or just drink after a meal for a nightcap."
"M/D: Very drinkable, somewhat acrid and acidic, but overall pretty unique and good witbier."
"M/D - medium bodied with decent carbonation, really nice aroma and ok flavor, just not one i'd go for again"
"Well....Wit's are not a fav. beer of mine, and I don't like fruity beer. However, when a Light and a Blackberry wit come in a Sampler, I have to buy to get hold of a Latitude 48. Not a terrible tasting beer, just too sweet for my taste. Kind of like a Wine Cooler....but of course with a light hop/malt presence. Not Terrible, just not my cup of...beer."
"Bready up-front, fruity and medicinal thereafter. Citrus peel and coriander spiciness is present beneath the fruit, which clashes a bit with the tart berry flavor. Mouthfeel is a bit heavy and cloying between the chewy wheat malt, the fruit and the spices. Not particularly enjoyable, this one's going down the drain."
"D- If I were to just smell it, I would love it everyday! Overall just not that over the top"
"Nothing spectacular and will not be on my list of drinks for summer."
"Disappointing as a wheat beer but a more complex malt profile or some more robust hop presence would have helped it a lot."
"Poured aggressively, a big head can be made to billow above a hazy gold body. Strong aromas of tart berries and candies that span the assorted fruit spectrum. It smells interesting, to be sure, but the sweetness of the aromas becomes tedious after a while. Sweet berries overwhelm the front palate...and the middle...and the back. I have to be in a particular mood to enjoy something this sugary-tasting, otherwise it's a total no-go."
"This beer is not exactly what I expected, but it is not terrible; not great but not terrible. For what it's worth the beer does seem to get better as it warms, it seems to take on more traditional witbier characteristics."
"Final Notes: Maybe good for those that love very sweet beer without hop character or as a dessert beer, but I don't really care for it and I won't be buying it by itself at any rate."
"I wanted the Latitude 48, so I had to get the whole Summer Styles box. Oh well, I guess I'll suck it up and drink the extraneous bottles. Tee hee. This one pours a slightly hazy straw with a minor bit of white head that dies away very quickly. The nose comprises a bushel's worth (at least) of berries, though whether or not they're blackberries is hard for me to say. Some bready bits congregate in the background, but don't say very much. The taste is composed of these elements as well, joined by a very light bitterness. Hm. The body is light, with a dry finish and a rather bubbly feel. Overall, not the best wit out there; the berries are strong yet vague, leaving me wanting something more, somewhere..."
"A hazy yellow orange color pour with a small fizzy white head , short lasting leaving some jagged lacing behind ,lively carbonation. Aroma of blsckberry slushie , grassy hops and orange zest . Flavor is wheaty , with some hints of spicy hops and lots of fruit , light body , thin mouthfeel , a good solid drinker but nothing here to bring me back for more ."
"Bottle. Good aroma:more currant than blackberry. Excellent color. Medium head that dissipates withing 5 minutes. Typical mouthfeel for a wheat beer. Main disappointment is flavor which is just so so. Tastes better with food like Ritz crackers. Not that great by itself."
"[Drinkability]: Drinkability is average. Not a true Witbier, but more like a fruit beer."
"Nah, it feels where it counts most: Taste. This beer has taste, no doubt, but not a very appealing one."
"This is a pretty decent beer. I really enjoyed the subtle blackberry mixed with the citrusy wheat flavors. Overall I felt it lacked a little something. If it's anything it's light and refreshing"
"Worth a shot, pick it up you shouldn't be dissapointed."
"Brown bottle with a brewery freshness month of September. Poured into a SA perfect pint glass, it appears a slightly hazed straw yellow color with a bit of orange tint to it. Head is more than 2 fingers strong of white foam backed by constantly rising bubbles of carbonation. As the head receeds, lace clings all about the glassware. The aroma of this beer is a big burst of blackberry fruitiness that is so bold I have a hard time believing this is not exaggerated or accented with an extract or artificial flavoring of some sort. Also in the nose is a bit of some other minor citrus notes, some candy-like character and a hint of sulfur. Taste is slightly fruity upfront from the berry but includes a tacky amount of wheat through the medium light, highly carbonated body. The flavor of this beer has an increasing amount of wheat character as it warms that becomes more sweet and also takes on a bit of some hefeweizen flavors of subtle banana and a bit of bubblegum through the back blended with the ongoing presence of the blackberries. The alcohol is a little more apparent than most for the style."
"Drinkability is average. This is the second sixer I've bought in the last six months, and that's about the right frequency. I like the idea of fruity beers, but this isn't one of my favorites, although it's certainly ok."
"D- a good brew for some warm days. I know that is said all too often, but it is drinkable. The berris are a good swing for a fruit type beer. I enjoy it"
"D- wouldn't have more then one."
"D: It's refreshing and flavorful, but a little too sweet. Despite the label's description, the fruit is subtle like a sledgehammer. The blackberry would work a lot better if it were dialed back a little."
"D: I""m basically ambivalnet here. not bad, not good... will definitley finish all that I have! but will look to other brews next time."
"Pouring a hazy amber orange, this is darker than a wit should be. There's an off-white head with nice retention and a little lacing. The nose is quite disappointing. Rather artificial blackberry character, medicinal in nature washes everything else out. Maybe some wheat is present, but there's some spice character as well. Just way too fruity, not enough yeast expression. The palate opens with the artificial fruit character dominating, medicinal in character. Then, the moderate spice character kicks in with a perplexing astringency on the finish. The spice character is definitely coriander seed in nature with that classic astringency I've learned to expect from it when used with a less than deft hand. Light in body with moderate carbonation, this beer dries on the finish with spice and artificial fruit noticeable. Disappointing stuff. I love a decent number of Sam Adams beers, but this certainly isn't one of them."
"Ummm... I like most Sam Adams beers, but I'm afraid this one isn't one of them. Looks fine. Medium amber and cloudy. Smell is like berry cough syrup. Honestly. With just a touch of malt. About the time I'd finished sampling the scent, the head was mostly gone. The flavor is a mixture of lager and cough syrup. A bit of malt with a sweet berry flavor in the background. The carbonation is about right I guess, for what it is. One will be enough if I can finish it. I suppose someone will like it. But to me it's just not very good. The flavors just don'[t mix. Sorry."
"As fruity wheat beers go, this isn't terrible, but it's not a style I especially enjoy, nor can I recommend this example. It took me an hour or so to finish one bottle."
"Drinkability - Its not a bad beer but as far as knocking back more then one or two seems a bit much. Its sweetness may be good for turning a wine cooler fan into a beer drinker."
"The mouthfeel is very crisp and refreshing, with lots of active carbonation. It is fairly drinkable, but not something I will ever buy again. Only had it because it came in the summer sampler, honestly, not worth it."
"Drinkability: Goes down pretty easy because it's so light. Fruit does get to be a bit much as it warms up."
"You could probably drink one or two of these before you decide to upgrade to a better beer. Nothing offensive just not a true witbier. Oh well, I'd still rather buy these for my gf than those crappy corona lights she drinks, this one is at least drinkable!"
"This brewmaster's special doesn't really work as a fruit beer, or a wheat beer. It's an apricot-colored, hazy, fizzy brew. The nose promises berries, toasty grains, lemon and grape --but the taste doesn't deliver. Flavors of blackberry, citrus and biscuit are simple and unchallenging. A slightly soapy mouthfeel doesn't help. This is a perfectly nice beer, but nothing special."
"I was wondering about this - an now I found out. Starts off not too bad: Pours with a light fine white head and some lace. Color is a hazy amber. Aroma is like a wit beer but with serious blackberries. Flavor is where it takes a turn for the worse. I can pick up the wit thang in the background but the berry absolutely dominates and twists the stuff in a way that reminds me of crass comercialization. Body and carbonation is ok. Finish is like flavor. Not a session."
"D: The blackberry is so light I wouldn't even constitute it as a ""must-try"" for blackberry fans. But, it is natural tasting and a pretty good companion to the light, smooth drinkability of a witbier, which SA has crafted pretty well. not bad, but I wouldn't buy any quantity on its own for myself."
"T: The taste is mellowed down from the aroma which is a good thing. I was expecting a fruit loop flavor, but the taste is fairly clean and crisp. The front of the sip has a slight sweetness that quickly changes to blackberry with a slightly bitter tart finish. Nothing over powering. Overall much better than I was expecting but nothing stellar. My expectations weren't too high after my last fruit experience from Sam Adams was the Cranberry Lambic."
"The syrup nature of the flavoring isn't in your face, but still somewhat bothersome. Being reminded of cough syrup is not something I tend to look for in a beer."
"The mouth is crisp and workman like. It is a light refreshing beer, but I will limit myself to no more than one every once-in-awhile."
"I don't like this as much as Cherry Wheat, but it's a worthy experiment on the part of the Boston Beer Company, and one I'm happy to have tasted."
"This is a beer that could be a hit or miss beer. Give it a try though."
"Cheers!"
"A strong smell of blackberry sweetness with maybe a little wheat in the back. The taste is of an overly sweet blackberry. This is a fruity wheat beer and it accomplishes that but to my tastes this is a pretty one dimensional beer lacking any subtlety. Sub par compared to what I'm used to from Boston Beer."
"Notes - When I smelled it I was afraid this was going to be one-dimensional, but you can definitely taste some spices in it. It's far from complex, though. I don't regret trying it, but I don't intend to buy it again."
"D: its easy to drink but not my cup of tea"
"Sweet and simple with classic witbier flavors buried in the fruit, enough so that I would call this a Fruit/Veg. Beer as for style. Decent drink if you favor the lopsided aroma and flavor of the beer."
"Samuel Adams Blackberry Witbier was a pleasant suprise for me as I typically turn my nose up at these styles. I think it is definitely worth a try for even the hoppiest of hop heads."
"D - Not the most drinkable beer in the variety pack. For a fruit beer, I was expecting something a little lighter and easier to throw back. This has too much of a seltzer bite and heavy body to be a real pounder."
"Overall, highly enjoyable, not overly complex beer, a worthy addition to the beers of summer mix pack."
"Served - Cold in Bottle"
"D-Not a bad beer per se, but not one I'll be likely to revisit in the future."
"M/D - Decent brew from Sam Adam's, not really one of my favorites from them. I am glad I tried the brew. To me it is a medium bodied brew due only to the blackberry taste. Probably wouldn't seek this brew out again."
"Drinkability - The flavor just makes this completely undrinkable for me. SOrry."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a small head that leaves minimal lacing. The nose is very sweet and very strong of blackberries with a little bit of malt. The taste is a fair balance between blackberries and malt. Also very sweet. Decent mouthfeel and good drinkability, this beer was made to be refreshing on a hot summer day, which is does a great job of doing, much better than the summer ale in my opinion."
"Very hazy light gold colored body. Fairly big white head disappears pretty quickly. Still leaves some lace behind. The scent is your typical wit smell, with a nice dose of blackberries. Same for the taste: nice refreshing belgian wheat backed by a nicely blended blackberry finish. Nice fairly full and soft mouth. Very refreshing. I'm not normally huge on wits, but this one i really enjoy."
"I hate that I'm always forced to get something I don't want in order to purchase the combination pack. I didn't expect much out of this and I wouldn't buy it again. I hope the Latitude 48 is worth it."
"Taste is as expected, mostly malt with a light aftertaste of fruit, namely the blackberry, not fruity or sweet enough to be a fruit beer, not yeasty/wheaty enough to be a witbier, falls somewhere in between and wish it would be more of both, carbonation is crisp though and it goes down quickly, sadly the gimmick of the blackberry needs to be stronger in order to work."
"Meh, I'm hard to impress with fruit beers but I thought this one left a lot to be desired. Too sugary to enjoy a lot of. One isn't terrible though."
"D: went good with the angel food cake i had with it, great dessert beer."
"Overall, this brew could have its place in the fridge on a very hot day as it is refreshing. Slightly disappointed, at least they could make it more balanced."
"D-I could pull of one or two of these, but in the long run it would be too sweet."
"I love wits and I like some fruity beers but this one didnt work for me. This Wit would be much better w/o the blackberry"
"Definitely worth a shot if you find it on your store shelf."
"D=A beer for people who love cobbler. Nice to have in the fridge when you're having a certain kind of company over. And a whole lot better than Cranberry Lambic for anyone."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Very crisp and refreshing, easy too drink and enjoyable on a hot summer day."
"Overall: I'm definitely on the fence with this beer. It's more ""authentic"" than Berry Weiss, but not necessarily better. I know it's hard to compare these two beers beyond the use of berries, so to be fair, I rate these about the same."
"Overall a nice addition to Sams line-up next to cherry-wheat."
"I tend to stay away from fruit beers, but since I like to check out various brews and saw this for the first time I figure what the heck. The look is average, but what I found was a good balance between the fruit and wheat. It has a very distinctive flavor which in itself I find enjoyable. It is not as smooth as other fruit beers, but it is close, and the best part is the fruit does not dominate the taste."
"D: If it was closer to summer I might give this a slightly higher rating. The beer isn't bad by any means but not something I would want to have regularly at all. After the couple of bottles in the sampler pack, I don't need to have anymore for a little while."
"This was a decent brew and I think it compliment the rest the brews in the seasonal pack I had."
"This is very clean for a wit, its smooth, finishes sweet and slighlty bitter. You can get a hint of ""fruit"" if you swish in the mouth, fairly hoppy and malty. Will drink again, but not one to drink a lot of."
"It was a very drinkable beer, went down easy and very savory, it was hard not to drink it quickly."
"Sufficiently complex to accompany gourmet vegetarian pizzas such as sun-dried tomatoes, feta and basil on focaccia over a virgin olive oil-based sauce."
"D- Well, this finishes pretty dry. I can't say I would want to drink a lot of these. I think this would be great after a a bike ride, a reinvigorating beer. In that sense, this beer is a winner."
"Lightly hazed light gold with a moderate sized head. Nose has berries and a hint of wheatiness. Flavour is berries of course, and a tart-sweet edge. Fairly substantial body, crisp wheaty twang and a mildly bitter finish. Easy drinking, refreshing brew."
"After the cranberry lambic fiasco I am wary about trying other Sam Adams fruit brewed beers but I will try anything once... Poured a hazy purplish color with a nice chewy look to it. Smelled of mild blackberries with some wheatiness. Taste was smooth as silk with a nice, not too sweet, blacckberry curtain with nice wheat esters and good balance. This is a sharp contrast to the cranberrry lambic. Reminiscent of Hoegaarten infused with blackberry and oh so quaffable. Cheers!"
"d-too much fruit flavor to be satisfying, more of a desert beer"
"D- Interesting fruity beer, but nothing I'd go back for."
"Overall, not a bad beer. I'll drink it again. One in a night would do for me though."
"D-I've got mixed thoughts on this one...an OK berry flavored beer but I was hoping for much more with the combination of blackberries and whit beer base...decent enough as a fruit beer but does not have any whit beer characteristics. Never the less I'm just about drooling thinking about pairing this with a fresh lobster salad."
"This would be a perfect beer to have after mowing the lawn on a hot summer day."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a clear, apricot color with one finger of beige foam that quickly receded to a thin collar. The lacing was barely noticeable.. The aroma was of artificial blackberries, wheat and hints of crystal malt. Totally fruit dominated. The flavors were better than the aroma, showing more dynamic characteristics and less artificial notes from the berries. Though the blackberry came clearly through it was tangy and balanced by the pale/crystal malt middle and a slight bitterness from the hops. The finish was long, really coating my tongue with the berry flavor. The mouthfeel was average, the body light and the carbonation good. Very similar to the Blackberry Wheat made famous by Long Trail only with more gumption and less artificial notes. Refreshing, summery and crisp but neither complex nor impressive. But if you're trying to get girls, especially college girls, drunk, don't miss it!"
"Drinkability: as a light wheat beer, Blackberry Witbier is not hard to drink. It's a bit difficult to classify, style-wise, but overall is not a bad beer."
"I was surprised that I enjoyed Blackberry Witbier as much as I did, not being a fan of fruit beer or witbiers."
"Do not recommend. Don't waste your money! I still have 5 left that I'll end up dumping down the drain."
"(12 oz bottle into pint glass) Surprisingly I really enjoyed this one. I was afraid of the standard Sam Adams hoppiness overpowering everything in what should be a fruit beer, but it didn't! Poured a beautiful amber color with a small head that fell fast. The nose was very much of the fruit, but also a little bit of earthiness that prevented this from smelling like a fruit syrup, which is a downfall of some. this went down very smooth, with a nice creaminess and lively carbonation bringing out a lot of the fruitness in the beer. The trademark hops were present right at the end, giving the beer a nice crisp finish that was almost palate cleansing. great job on this one!"
"D: I find this to be a really refreshing beer on the warmer days. It doesn't quite do the same for me when it's cold outside. I typically like ot start off on one or two of these and then increase the darkness of the beer from there. A solid Boston Beer Company Brew."
"This beer is fun and different than the usual, get the blackberry going, light, relatively smooth easy drinking beer. I wouldn't want to have more than a few, or buy a case of it but I'd buy a six pack and throw it in the mix every so often. Not too strong of a fruity taste, subtle but you know its there."
"Nicely effervescent not bitter. A nice refreshing crispness orbits with some lingering malt and yeast notes. Agood brew and nice to see blackberry in beer."
"This poured a golden/copper colour. Smell was of weak blackberries with some wheat notes, and the taste follows the smell. Mouthfeel was light and refreshing, and it was very drinkable, I could drink these all day. Overall, a great beer to drink during the summer months."
"The more I drink, the more I am reminded of grape soda."
"D: Two or three in a sitting, but because of the pungent, potpourri punch to the nose preempting each sip, for myself, three would be the limit."
"A decent fruit beer, as such things go. I'm not even going to attempt to view it as a wit. It might be refreshing to drink a couple of bottles of this on a hot day rather than in the middle of a Spokane winter, but I wouldn't want more than a couple. I was glad that the blackberry flavor wasn't too cloyingly sweet, but this beer wasn't too terribly exciting, and I won't feel the need to seek it out again."
"A decent beer, but not one that I would expect to garner considerable attention as a sixer. Not bad overall, decent Wit--moderately fruity, sweet, but one that could use a little bite to add a more complex flavor."
"On the other hand my girlfriend (an avid beer drinker bordering on enthusiast) was very impressed with this beer for basically the same reasons I dislike it."
"It doesn't taste that great but you could easily chug one of these, but why woudl you want to? Not too good."
"D: Very light fruit beer, tasty because i have always loved the blackberries, but if so, would have lower skill levels."
"D- There are much better options for a good fruit brew, but I did enjoy drinking this beer."
"Overall - it's alright. Nothing to be super excited about. There's better beer out there than this one."
"D - Ok for experimentation and for getting girls to drink more beer, but if you want a fruit beer you should get a fruit beer, and if you want to drink juice you should drink juice. If you want to drink a witbier....keep going down the isle."
"I was very disappointed with Sam Adams Blackberry Witbier. Normally, I'm a big fan of Sam Adams' brews. This beer looks delicious, but it was a let down after the first drink. If you really want a fruit beer from Sam Adams, the Cherry Wheat is a better option in my opinion."
"D - very sessionable, no overpowering flavors despite the fruit focus"
"D - Good. Very good. One of my favorite sesh beers now. 5.5%ABV is higher than some folks like but I think it's fine. I really enjoy this beer! A+++"
"Drinkability? It is easy enough for me to drink to have another when I finish this bottle but I would have liked to have seen this puppy under 5% abv. ;^)"
"Drinkability- I kind of think I might have gotten a less than great specimen, but on this particular beer I don't think I would want to drink too many of these. I'll finish this one, but I think I'll be content at stopping there."
"This one pours to a reddish yellow color with a small head. When first opened, the nose is filled with the sweet smell of blackberry. Not a lot of carbonation. Taste is slightly sour blackberry and another bitter flavor in the background that I didn't recognize. This one is good for the style."
"Definitely taste the berries. Its the strongest flavor in the beer. Medium to low bodied. No carbonation in the mouth. Beer is a little dry. Mouthfeel is fine. There is an odd bitterness that I am not enjoying. Drinkability suffers."
"The bottom line is that there is no harmonizing the berry-ness with the beery-ness of this beverage. There is no balance at all. It's a good, accurate, non-cloying flavor, but there is just no witbier there."
"Drinkability: Not bad, but not great. Certainly better than Sam Adams' other fruit offerings. Very drinkable and pretty enjoyable but not something I'd seek out on a regular basis."
"D: Wheat beers of any stripe are not my favorite so for me this would only be an occasional indulgence. For those who like wheat beers I could see them having several. A solid witbier with no strong faults."
"Not a bad fruit beer.... worth a shot."
"Pours a cloudy, golden color with little to no head. Blackberry comes through in the smell. Taste is a slightly bitter hop bite with wonderful, fresh blackberries in the mix. I am new to the Witbier style, but this seems very refreshing enough. A good one for Summer, because of those gorgeous Oregon blackberries coming through. Mouthfeel is slightly thin. Overall, a good hot weather quencher with lovely fruit notes. Makes me long to try more Witbiers."
"If I could find this in six pack form like the Cherry for the 9 dollar price tag I would be all about it but it's not really around this area anymore. Would totally drink it again if I saw it."
"Poured to a golden ornage color with very good carbonation and a thin white head that lingered well and left okay lacing. Nose was hoppy blackberry and citrus fruit, with a hint of malty wheat. Mouthfeel is a combination of tart, tingly and a tad bitter. Taste picks up on the blackberry from the nose, but throws in a little bit of soapy aftertaste. Finish is slightly bittersweet and short, but overall, this is not bad for a fruit beer from a big brewer."
"overall, this is prolly one of my favorite witbiers however it is a style i do not tend to drink"
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is carbonated, slightly creamy, and tarty. The body of beer is light in body with a tarty finish. I am really not surprised that the blackberry and the wit bier are out of whack. There is no balance to the beer either you get the blackberry or you get a stiff shot of the wit bier. Slightly disappointed, at least they could make it more balanced."
"not really digging on this beer. maybe it's the season or maybe it's just not doing it for me in general. a nice concoction, but one i probably won't revisit."
"I was disappointed with this offering and definetly won't be buying it again. The flavors are just not in harmony and it makes for an unpleasant drinking experience."
"D: This is actually quite refreshing and seems to be fitting for a hot summer day. My main problem is the fruit comes off as artificial and the malt bill comes off a little faint of what I would hope for in a wheat beer."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy, light brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of sweet blackberries. Taste is of blackberry but more tart than sweet, some hints of wheat are present. Feels medium bodiedin the mouth and has good drinkability.Overall this is a quality brew."
"This is a very good entry from Samuel Adams. The smell is bright and in style. The taste is definitely blackberry, it's even on the palate and consistent. This is a moderate body, on the robust end for the style, slightly sweet, somewhat bitter. This is very drinkable and an enjoyable beer. This is meant to be enjoyed, appreciated, not chugged."
"Pours a cloudy, golden color. 2/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of blackberries, syrup, yeast, and slight sweet malt. Fits the style of a Fruit / Vegetable beer. Mouth feel is smooth and sharp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of blackberries, yeast, and slight sweet malt. The best blackberry beer I've had so far. Why is there such a sharp metallic tastein most beers that contain blackberries?"
"D- You know, this really isn't the terrible beer some on here would have you believe. I'm not saying it's great. it's the weak link in the brewmaster's collection six pack i picked up (thank you black lager for keeping the team strong). but it's not horrendously bad. it definitely is blackberry focused, but the label tells you that. i think perhaps they went a bit overboard with the blackberry, but the concept isn't that bad. it's a reasonable beer that i don't altogether dislike."
"O: I went into this with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. I should have known better than to question Jim Koch."
"12 ounce bottle, best before January 2010. Served in a mug, the beer pours a hazy yellow/orange color with a half inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both average. The beer smells mostly like blackberries, along with some wheat/grain. Taste is similar to the aroma, however there is more balance between the wheat and blackberry flavors. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's a bit dry and has good carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it's smooth and easy to drink. I think this is a good overall brew, if I was in the mood for a fruit beer I'd buy it again."
"Overall: A all around pretty good beer, but not exceptional in any way. I would drink this again without hesitation, but I don't know if I would buy it. Certainly worth a try."
"Overall it's not undrinkable, but not that enjoyable. It's on par with the Cherry Wheat, so if you're into that, you'll probably like this one too. Personally, I'll pass on it in the future."
"D- Pretty drinkable on the right occasion. This would go well with a Thanksgiving meal or a savory dish."
"d- great session beer. easy to drink a lot of; smooth with just enough tart"
"Drinkability: This is a well put together beer by the Boston Beer Company. It isn't an incredibly complex witbier, but for the price, this is an easily cratable beer."
"Drinkability - Easy drinker for a change of pace. Couldn't sit and drink them all day."
"Bottle: Poured a hazy orangey color ale with white haze and a medium foamy head with OK retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of blackberry and wheat is sweeter then I had anticipated but still very much enjoyable. Taste is well enough balanced between sweet blackberries and medium wheat malt. Body is fuller then average with OK carbonation. Not bad overall thought I prefer my Wit without fruit."
"Overall I was pleasantly surprised. The beer is far from sweet and not what I expected. The blackberry flavor was subtle yet pronounced enough to know it was there. Not bad, a good summer drinker."
"D: It's not bad at all, but I think it would get sickening if you had more than one (most of these beers would for me, anyway)."
"Drinkability:Very light bodied, and plain. The finish really turned me off on this thing. Probably wouldn't pick this up again. Blackberry was evident just didn't do much for me."
"Drinkability: A pretty good beer. As I said, Boston Brewing did a good job at maintaining a balance with this, as it easily could have been too fruity."
"Unfortunately, the beer quickly goes downhill, and a glance at the label reveals why: ""Wheat ale brewed with blackberries and spices and natural flavor added."" There's the culprit: natural flavor. And the more I drink, the more this beer reeks of artificiality. Perhaps not technically artificial, since it is ""natural flavor," but ""natural flavor"" is foreign enough in beer to unwelcome, especially here. As a general concept, added flavor wouldn't hurt this beer so much if it weren't so painfully present and in the forefront throughout. The brewers managed to hit some great flavor notes, and hit them well, with the various parts of the beer melding together quite well, but my palate just can't see past that ""natural flavor"" to get around to liking this beer. Disappointing, and not recommended."
"D: A full bodied, decent beer with an above average taste.Like i said i felt like i was drinking a very dry fruity kind of wine or even a wine cooler, good for a beer or two but after that it goes down hill. Not what i expected from Sam Adams."
"I could drink about half of this. Not my bag."
"Poured into the pint glass, only managed half of pint of beer, the other half was foam, took about a minute to die down. Light golden pour, nose of fruity berries. Taste is sour, and the blackberry leaves a strong aftertaste. This is not something I can enjoy enough to drink the entire bottle...I'm hoping it'll get better, now, after just 3 sips, it tastes like seltzer!!! OUCH."
"Pours an appealing clear golden amber with a decent head, off-white, fairly fluffy and fairly persistent. Aroma is malty with a firm blackberry component that gets your attention but does not overwhelm the beery aroma. Flavor is like a good ale, and again the blackberry tone is firm but not too strong. Texture is smooth, refreshing, fizzy, lively."
"the taste of blackberries is way too strong. would be better if it were more of a witbier taste and more subtle blueberries. i could possibly have two or three in a sitting. i would drink again, but not anytime soon."
"I wouldn't call this a good example of a wit, but as far as fruity beers go they did a nice job restraining themselves. It turns out to be a beer first with blackberry added, rather than vice versa like many other fruit beers."
"For what it is, this isn't bad at all. Fairly simple and easily drinkable. It wasn't amazing, but the light blackberry taste blends well with things. This is a solid effort; the 6-pack will not go to waste."
"Drinkability: This is a refreshing late summer brew, but it will doubtless not appeal to many. I can't help but feel despite the label's talk of Marion blackberries that the flavor is little more than the same sort of flavoring one can buy at any brewing stone. Still, not a bad brew."
"Notes: another in the ""Brewmaster's Collection"" from Sam Adams. This one is solid."
"drinkability is decent. when it comes to fruit beers, there are generally two categories: the beers that overdo the fruit and end up tasting like fruit juice, and those that underutilize the best qualities of the fruit and end up leaving a lot to be desired. a small number of fruit beers walk between the lines and use the fruit in a way that accentuates everything good about the flavors and offsets the downfalls with malts and hops (see the Cantillons, Sweetwater Blue, Flanders Reds, etc.). this one definitely underutilizes the fruit, backing away from showcasing the blackberries and ends up as a mildly bland and underwhelming fruit beer. Sam Adams usually does much better than this. dissapointing."
"F- Clean finish with no lingering aftertaste"
" ~ While I am not a fan of fruit beers I have to admit this is not at all bad. The fruit flavor is subtle enough that it doesn't overwhelm the true beer character."
"While this may be a refreshing, tasty summer beer for some, I did not care much for this. The blackberry presence was much too strong for my liking, and seemed artificial. My fiancee, who enjoys Cherry Wheat, hasn't touched this beer since her first bottle for the same reasons. If the flavors were more subtle, it might seem more like a wit, instead of a Berliner Weisse."
"Definitely something I would share with first time beer drinkers that love that berry flavor. Plus, also a beer that would be appropriate for summer to autumn. One key note though, gotta serve it extra cold, because if you don't, it taste like cough syrup with a bitter after taste."
"i guess this beer might go good with desert or cheese or something. Overall this is an eh beer."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0907-DanielleV"
"Light to medium body with a crisp mouthfeel. Wasn't expecting much out of this one and by no means is it anything overly great, but for a nice hot day, these can actually be quite refreshing and easy to put away. Would have again as an outdoor summer beer."
"The Witbier is a great summer beer as it's light and refreshing, especially on a hot day. Definitely an excellent substitute for the crap beer that was in there before...."
"D: This has session beer written all over it."
"D: A good session or food beer. Probably one of the best of fruit-added witbiers I've had."
"D - I could drink quite a few of these. Good palate cleanser too if you are doing tastings."
"M/D: light bubbly and semi astringent just in feel but good drinkability suiting well on hot days by the pool."
"D- I could put these down all day, especially on a hot beach or something. Too fruity for everyday drinking, but if you like fruity beers, you'll probably enjoy this one."
"I could taste the blackberry. I could taste the wheat. Unfortunately I also was getting a nasty medicinal aftertaste, mixed with some unspeakable flavor I can't really describe. Very carbonated mouthfeel. I wouldn't call this beer terrible, I just wouldn't get it again."
"I hate to quote man-laws, ""do not fruit the beer," because I feel I contradict myself when I say I like Sam Cherry Wheat, Blue Moon w/orange, Shock Top, or Corona w/ lime, but I feel that Blackberry witbier goes a little too far. It ended up tasting too much like grape juice than it did a beer. Unlike Sam Cherry Wheat, which I feel puts just the right amount of cherry flavor in; any more and it would be too much. Sorry Jim, but this Sam was not for me."
"slight edit: upped the appearance and mouthfeel. a really admirable fruit brew."
"This was a very surprising beer for me. I'll normally do not like fruit flavored beers, the cherry wheat that Sam Adams makes I can't stand. There was something different about this one though, maybe because it was blackberry flavored, maybe blackberry is more what my pallet likes, I don't know. But this was a very good beer. A great beer for a nice hot summer day sitting out in the pack patio. Just when I think to right off Sam Adams they surprise me."
"This is not my style, but it is an easy drinker and goes well with hot weather. It's not a good representation of the style, but ok nonetheless."
"I actually like this.. but make no mistake.. you are not drinking a witbier with blackberries.... you are drinking a blackberry beer... While I do like it... one bottle will always be my limit."
"Finally picked up the Sam Adams summer sampler at Meijer. Leave it to Sam Adams to make a good fruit beer. (after the Cranberry Lambic fiasco, they owe us one) IMO fruit beers are too often desert beers. Not so in this case. Smell and taste have just the right amount of fruitiness. Well balanced, but fruity sweetness overides just enough. It's a good beer."
"Amber bronze with a billion tiny suspended yeast particles visable and a decent slightly off white creamy head that leaves fine lacing on the glass. The nose is blackberry and mild spice. The flavors are bittersweet blackberries and wheat with just a touch of coriander spice. Medium bodied with a prickly carbonation. Another in the long line of fruit beers by SA, not my favorite."
"Notes - Not what I would call bad just disappointing. I wanted this beer to be better than it was."
"Purchase before December of 2009 the bottle says. It's the middle of August so I'm in the wheelhouse. I pour it into my pint glass. It developes a thick dense head like shaving cream. The body of the beer appears hazy and opaque and orange/gold in color. I can certainly pick up on some fruit odors. I detect, well, blackberries, of course, but also earthy grains and spices. All of the aromas mix together well. Tatses yeasty, fruity, earthy, but also clean. Kind of medium/heavy body, light carbonation, and semi-creamy. Nice fruity burps. pretty easy drinker."
"D: Enough with the chemical flavorings Sam Adams, this is OK, but if it was fermented all with real fruit it would be a lot better, I've had fruit beers of amazing quality before."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it's more of a fruity beer than a Witbier, but it might be just a tad better than some of the other fruit infused wheat beers out there. Either way, it's not the type of beer I could drink regularly."
"Pours cloudy gold/amber color with a nice 1 inch fluffy head, and smelled of sweet berries, with a hint of malt and spice. Medium carbonation with a strong overall sweetness that overpowers everything else; powerful blackberry taste with crisp malt and hop flavor that finishes dry with a spicy note (cinnamon???), that had a metal taste to it which lingers in a negative way. It was too sweet for my liking and not one I would order at a bar."
"Medium body, with fairly high carbonation. Good balance. Crisp, refreshing beer. Basically, this has the feel of just what you would look for in a summer beer."
"Pretty drinkable, but wouldn't be my choice for a full night of overindulging."
"D- So recently i have been hearing more and more about these fruit, specifically berry and melon, infused beers when i happened to come across this product in local store. Was reluctant to purchase as i have herd about negative and positive, and when i hear fruit and beer i think lambic. I however was surprised. The beer was very drinkable and refreshing and adds a new dimension to the witbier class. Thumbs up from me."
"D- Moderate to fairly high, I wouldn't drink a bunch of these in a row, but I can see how some people could. A solid wit, although more of a fruit beer. Tasty, whatever style it is.... Although I prefer Long Trail's blackbeary wheat to this."
"good job sam"
"Pours a nice cloudy pale yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, yeasty, with some spice and blackberries. The taste is malty, sweet, yeasty, with a nice touch of spice and blackberries. Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad brew, hit's the spot on a hot day. Glad to see it here in Utah."
"Overall: for the record: at the PSU BrewFest last year (RIP 2009--still going to enjoy the trip, and thanks brother Jer!) we all voted for the Stout; unfortunately, the wit won over the populace; disappointment aside, the beer flirts with something fun, but comes up short, as most non-lambic fruit ales do..."
"D: The blackberry witbier is truly a ""Snapple of Beers"". This stuff, particularly when it's fresh is just a hugely sweet berry bomb, and though I thought it'd be horrid, it turned out actually rather pleasant. I feel weird giving it as high a score as I am, but it really impressed."
"Somewhat thin mouthfeel, but not really watery, per se. Medium-high carbonation is on the verge of being offensive. Although the beer is light and carbonated, it's a little too sweet to be very drinkable."
"Samuel Adams Blackberry Witbier was hazy golden in color with a white head. The head was two fingers thick to start, but soon became a thin layer that remained to the end, leaving a little lacing behind. The aroma was dominated by blackberries. It tasted lightly of blackberries upfront with spices and bitterness coming through towards the semi-dry finish. It was medium bodied with adequate carbonation. Drinkability was average. It's a decent enough brew and better than expected, but not something I would go out of my way for."
"The wheat beer underneath is pretty mediocre, nothing special. This is just light beer with lots of blueberry or blackberry notes throughout. The beer is very smooth, and although the label mentions spices, I can't really detect any. There's nothing to not like in this beer, it is simple, unoffensive, and that is about all you can say. There is barely any hop bite, or spicey anything in the finish. It is pure water in the mouth and very little aftertaste. The beer is just plain light and berry flavored, don't look for anything more here."
"Smell is malty sweet and spicy with a berrry undertone. Pours to a slightly hazy deep bright yellow with a nice foamy two finger head. Taste is classic sweet and sour witbier, sweet up front, sour in the middle and a bitter,slightly dry finish. Great use of blackberry that has almost the same characteristics exept for the bitterness. The blackberry taste is most evident on the sweetness up front, pairs well on the sour middle and fades with the bitter finally. Carbonation is good but not really evident or noticable with this flavored brew. When I picked this up I thought it might be to ""berry-y"" but its not. Another good go to brew from Sam's. Hopefully they replace the cranberry lambric in the holiday pack with this one for a solid holiday assortment."
"crispy and light mouthfeel, probably refreshing on a hot day. drinkable brew for sure."
"D: I can see why this would be included in the Samuel Adams summer pack. This is an occasional type of beer for me. With that said,it is a very drinkable beer that would be going down easy while hanging out by the pool in the summer..."
"Drinkability: This is an extremely drinkable brew, it is light but not watery, the taste is fresh and clean the sweetness offsets the mild bitterness allowing this brew to go down easy. The carbonation does cause some minor bloating and the bitterness hangs for a moment but those are minor issues of dislike for myself. This is a nice light bodied brew without being a light beer, and I could easily see this being an afternoon Bar-B-Q session beer."
"Pours a hazy orangish gold with a frothy white head that fades fast. The smell is mostly blackberry, sweet notes, some other fruit smells. The taste is sweet start with a nice blackberry flavor, but finishes with a club soda like aftertaste. Tastes almost like carbonated flavored water-beer. The mouthfeel is light, smooth, a good amount of carbonation that can get annoying. This starts out as an enjoyable beer, but the beer is one sided. This isn't one that is super drinkable, nice for a hot summer day, but a bit disappointing. Worth checking out for fruit beer fans, but not necessarily a strong witbier."
"Not mindblowing, but a good wit and good use of fruit. Wish it didn't need have natural flavor added. Two in the summer sampler is about right, not sure I'd session this or buy it in six-packs, but it's fine."
"A nice smooth mouthfeel, a wonderful refreshing beer for a hot summer day, but I'd rather just have a regular witbier."
"Easy drinking, although gets a bit old toward the end. Slightly monotonous that I would suppose is from lack of spice."
"Overall I'd say a very good beer by Sam Adams. Based on what I've tasted of other beers of similar styles, I'd say the Blackberry Witbier is very representative of its style while still standing out, thanks to the strong presence of blackberries. Refreshing; a good summer beer. The only real negative thing I can say about it is it's a little too carbonated for me, but, again, that's typical of this style."
"Semi-hazy, paler gold color, with a smooth head on top. Aroma...very fruity...blackberry dominant. Some coriander is present in the nose as well. Sugar cookies too. The flavor is a mix of subtle blackberry with subtle witbier. Buttery sugar cookies with a touch of coriandor and blackberry....I can live with that. A touch moee carbonation than smooth. A good summer beer."
"I'll be a bit honest, I'm not a big fan of fruit/veggie beers or wheat beers but this was a little better than I expected. It was a hot day and I for some strange reason or another was craving a refreshing wheat beer. A buddy of mine gave me a ""5 pack"" cause he didn't like it so I thought I'd give one a try. Poured into a Sam's Perfect pint, it gave a better look than I expected. Slightly darker than a golden pale and much more clear than I expected. There was only a slight haze to it and it had a white fizzy head that dissapeared pretty quickly. Very little lacing on the glass of this one. It smelled pretty good. You can smell undertones of wheat, but the smell of sweet berries (I'm guessing mostly blackberries) are much stronger. The first initial sip was quite pleasant, very refreshing and sweet. But the taste seems to become blander and blander with each sip. I didn't enjoy the mouthfeel, a little fizzy for my liking, and I would consider it under average for drinkability as well. Honestly though it was much more enjoyable than I though it would be. I cracked this one open expecting the worst, but it was ok overall, worth a try."
"D - Not bad considering the slew of fruit beers on the market that are malt liquor swill mixed with concentrate or flavorings to add a fruit flavor. I really hate fruit beers and this isn't something I would keep on hand regularly but considering the style it is due some respect."
"Dr. A very drinkable beer for a summertime evening. I wouldn't do more than one of these though, it's more taste adventure than an everyday thirst quencher."
"This would be a fun beer to try, especially for someone who doesn't like beer. Since I like real beer, I'll probably not buy this weak girls' ""beer"" again."
"I'm not a fan of fruit beers, and in all reality that is what this is. Most of the characteristics one associates with a witbier are missing from it. As a fruit beer, it was kind of lacking as well. The berry taste wasn't as dominant as it should have been. It wasn't a bad beer; I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"Ultra smooth mouthfeel, slick, with a tingle in the aftertaste. More body than the average fruit beer. Spiciness of wheat yeast really cuts down on the fruitiness and tones down the blackberries. The blackberries do not taste artificial, a somewhat difficult thing to do with a fruit beer. One of the best fruit beers I have ever tasted."
"D: A great mouthfeel and taste combo makes this beer very drinkable. A very good warm month beer and definitely a solid blackberry brew."
"It was drinkable, but I probably won't buy this beer again. I bought this one in a summer mix pack, so I only got two. My wife tasted it and liked it, so she will get the other bottle."
"D okay beer could drink some if had to. On the plus side my wife likes this lighter style so its a definate plus for her"
"Drinkability - Relatively easy to drink. The balance of flavors and sweetness make this a nice beer to sip. This is a much better attempt than the Cherry Wheat in my opinion, and I would not be against drinking a couple of these in one sitting."
"D: This would be a good dessert beer. I sense very few witbier qualities in here, though."
"Pours a hazy gold with with small to medium head. Aroma is wheaty- bananas and cloves. Easily noticeable, although not overpowering, blackberry note. Taste again is pretty typical wheat beer. Tangy with some spicy notes. Blackberries from the middle through the finish again mostly in the background. Mouthfeel somewhat light and well carbonated. Pretty drinkable. Overall this is pretty decent. I'm glad the blackberries are subtle in this one."
"I'm pretty pleased with this beer. I usually don't like sweeter, fruity brews, but this one does a good job of capturing the sweetness without being too sweet. Unlike some other beers (Lienie's Berry Weis, for example), the sweetness doesn't come off as ""artificial."" As a Samuel Adams beer, I was expecting it to have a bit more of their trademark hoppiness. Though lacking this, it doesn't make it a bad beer. It's a decent ""fruity"" beer, but not great. Either way, it's another quality product from the Boston Beer Company."
"Samuel Adams Blackberry Witbier pours yellow with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. I like the aroma, it captures a nice blackberry smell. The flavor isn't quite as satisfying, there is definitely a bit of blackberry in the flavor, but this is really an American style wheat with a just a touch of blackberry in the flavor. Not bad, I like the smell better than the flavor."
"D - Pretty easy drinker. Nicely balanced. Blackberries aren't actually overpowering, they are just hint. Kind of nice."
"The tatse is where this beer succeeds. It is a very mild sweet taste with a nice light spice at the end. This is a pretty good beer you can drink all night long."
"D: I generally don't like fruity beers, but this one is pretty good. Blackberry flavor is there, but not overpowering. I could easy put down a few of these on a hot summer day."
"I thought it was a pretty good beer. Its not a style Im going back to, but I like some of the fruit beers once in a while (Cranberry, Blueberry, etc.). Poured into a pint glass stolen from somewhere, an odd yellow, with a decent head that went away quickly. Tasted like blackberry, though not overwhelming at all, actually light. kinda thin and light for mouthfeel, but overall a pretty good beer, one I would try again."
"M- Enough fruit flavor to make it noticeable but not too overwhelming. An all around nice addition to the summer variety pack!"
"I mentioned that his was similar to a UFO Raspeberry hefe, I would certainly take a UFO over this but I would drink either if given the opportunity."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a cloudy golden color with a huge, thick white head. The smell is all blackberries and can be smelled from quite a distance. My only complaint here is that the blackberry dominates the beer and reminds me of a malt-ernative beverage. I will say on a second sniff, there is a wheaty malt backbone, but the blackberry is doing everything it can to cover it up. The blackberry is immediately obvious on the palate; I was worried that like the smell it would be too dominant. However, that sweet berry front end transitions into a nice grainy malt finish and ends neutral, not overly sweet like I might have guessed. The mouthfeel is a little on the thinner side and the carbonation is less than what I was expecting but makes for a very drinkable beer. Overall, not a bad beer, one of the more successful berry beers I've had. Not something that I would make a regular purchase of, but a good summertime beer for a change of pace."
"Soft chalkiness in the mouth, heavier than expected, good finish. Very drinkable, very inviting. A fruit beer to keep around."
"Neither fruit beers nor wheat beers are my favourites, but I could see buying this again if there was nothing that looked more appealing."
"MF&D - For a guy that usually passes on the fruit infosed beer, this one actually held its own. Crisp, refreshing and easy to drink. Not overly sweet. A good addition to the summer sampler pack."
"Refreshing, for sure, though the flavors are a little too down-played, and the blackberries overwhelm the aroma; a little more in the nose and just a touch more on the palate and this would be a real winner as far as wheat-based fruit beers go, as the blackberries are a nice addition and provide a very pleasant fruit character to the beer."
"Verdict: While it's probably more of a Fruit Beer than a true Witbier, the end result is not particularly exciting regardless of style. Compared with the other year-round Sam Adams fruity wheat beer, Cherry Wheat, this is a much more pleasing proposition."
"drinkability: overall it is what it is. If this helps people get into real beer than great."
"Light golden, transparent honey in color. Fruit, blackberry syrup in the nose. Tastes of blackberry syrup, malt extract, artificial cherry flavors. Light in body but annoying to the palate. Not a terrible beer but one that lacks realism. I expected some real ingredients from this large ""craft"" brewery, not some malt extract brew flavors."
"Overall, while this is a bit oversimplified for some beer geeks' tastes and a little unbalanced, it's a solid brew."
"Notes: Overall it's a nice light summery beer."
"[1xNG]"
"Part of the Summer Styles case, this blackberry witbeer poured out of the bottle in a smooth manner. Initially, there was a good amount of head, which quickly dissipated into the beer. The smell was a strong berry aroma with some hop and spice. The taste was good, considering I'm not usually into wheat beers AND into fruity flavors in my beer. One can feel the berry taste as soon as it enters the palate. The mouthfeel was ordinary. I could have two to three of these in a sitting in terms of drinkability. I paired up the beer with a turkey-based chili and it surprisingly did well with it. Overall, I enjoyed this beer."
"Really not liking the fruitiness of this one. Just not my bag I guess."
"The fruit helps out for sure for this beer would be a beer gone bad without it. I personally don't think it's worth a try if you have other options. Keep it in the bottle, don't put it in a glass. Much better."
"Drinkability- pretty good, I liked it"
"Pours a clear amber like color. There is a small head but it disappears quickly. The smell of blackberries is there from the start. The smell is not as subtle as I would have thought. The taste is blackberries with a hint of lemon. The blackberry taste is strong and stays throughout the bottle. Almost losses its beer characteristics to the blackberry. The mouthfeel is carbonated but dry. Overall it is a good beer to mix in on a hot summer day, but too many of them would give way to a candy like taste."
"D - It's a drinkable beer. Not something I'd like to drink all the time or even occasionally. It was just... okay."
"D: This beer was OK, but not great to me. The syrupy fruit flavor didn't really work in my mind, but the beer was somewhat refreshing."
"I thought it was a good beer, but overall I was disappointed. I thought the style was more similar to a hefewiezen not a witbier. I was expecting something more than this from Sam Adams."
"Pours a three finger white head that fades quickly leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Light-medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Slight blackberry nose. Flavor is wheat with some sweetness from the blackberry. $2.00 for a 12oz bottle from Northend Superette Manchester, NH."
"D: Fine. This one was drinkable enough, but I'd rather reach for a different witbier afterwards."
"I could drink alot of these, but probably wouldn't. An average pour."
"This went down easy on a warm afternoon, but I wouldn't drink it all night."
"Light bodied, strong on carbonation. Very drinkable but not really to the witbier style. How could it be with blackberries in it? It seems the berries hide just about all aspects of this beer that would make it a wit."
"First up from the Sam Adams summer pack, I enjoyed the blackberry wit. Mostly I was happy that they didn't just dump some blackberries into their White Ale. I might pick up a 6er of this if I want a change."
"Drinkability: A dessert beer. Sip and enjoy, but more than one might overwhelm you."
"It is as drinkable as watery Koolaid, and who couldn't chug one of those down on a hot day. It's light and refreshing. Very drinkable, but I doubt I would seek this beer out, or even choose it over a run of the mill wit (like Blue Moon), with a little orange slice, on a hot day."
"pretty tasty for a beer with fruit in it."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - As lite & refreshing as this beer is, Id probably only enjoy a couple 12oz bottles on a very hot day. It's still very good though, I loved how refreshing it is, and how the mouthfeel compliments the flavor profile, the appearance was lacking a bit though, but Id buy it once in a while I guess. Not a seeker but I think it's definitely worth a try. Cheers!"
"Don't pick this up looking for a sweet beer as it is mostly bitter. Has a tiny bit of a sweet blackberry flavor with quite a bit of the blackberry aftertaste. All the other flavors present are common go the witbeir style. The color is is golden with a slight white head. Smell is oh so strong of blackberry. Not the most drinkable beer do to bitterness but slightly above average"
"D - Quite drinkable with a strong and enjoyable fruit character. The base witbier is nothing spectacular and the hop level in the finish might be a bit excessive, but overall this is a pretty decent, fruity summer beer."
"Nothing about this is really interesting. It tastes OK, but I personally wouldn't buy it to drink for myself again. Might be a nice beer to use with the ""intro to craft"" friends and family though."
"The brew is a solid witbier at it's core with decent blackberry flavoring. Texture is typical of almost all of the Sam Adams brews but matches well with the other textures in the beer. Overall, it's a great desert beer that also works well with poultry. I don't know that I could do more than one in a sitting."
"I'm picky when it comes to witbiers and fruit beers, so I was a bit skeptical about this one. But I like it and it's something I could drink from time to time."
"I love most all of the Sam Adams beer. This is an exception. It is gross. Do not try it unless you absolutely love wheat beers. Not worth the $8 for a six pack."
"Gold with orange hues. Lots of prickle all through the beer and on the glass. Light foam head and a good bit of lacing, but all of the prickle is pounding into the surface and breaking it apart. A little of the head sticks on the glass. Blackberry nose and dull or blunt grain tones that come across like melted snow or wet chalk. The attack is gentle and sweet. The blackberry is definitely understated, which tends to be a plus in fruit beers for me. The grain rips through the mouth at first, but then calms down and provides an appealing flavor that you might call a ""traditional wheat beer flavor."" The blackberry adds a pleasant accompaniment to the grains that dictate the late part of the flavor heading towards the finish. The finish ends up on the syrupy sweet side of the tracks but the aftertaste eventually dries out in the mouth."
"Great on a hot summers day, lemony sweet aftertaste. I didn't think i'd like this one, but I did. In Philadelphia, this beers worth 50 bucks."
"It could be argued that there is a moderately good drinkability factor to the Blackberry Witbier if you are in fact looking for a beer that might be a good lawn mower beer and are not looking for something that is going to overly impress the palate."
"Drinkability - in certain settings I could handle this, but not always. Not one I'd pick for regular inclusion to the SA lineup."
"12 ouncer, with ""purchase before"" dating notched on the side of the label. Pours cloudy darker apricot, with an eggshell head and leaving mostly a thick collar and spots of blobby lacing. Obvious ripe fruit in the nose, sugary berries. Pleasant summer brew, berries prominant and carry through start to finish. MOre of a fruit beer then a wit, as I dont pick up much of anything in the way of wit characteristics. NOt a bad brew to help wash down a summer lunch, or would be an obvious choice to accompany a fruity dessert. Worth a try in warm weather."
"This poured nicely with a short off-white head and cleanly laced down the glass. I found the aroma quite pleasing with strong Blackberry and Black Currant tones but not overpowering. The taste was light but pleasantly fruity, again not overpowering. Enough carbonation and just a bit too thin for a witbier. Very drinkable in the end and a welcome return to new beer for me."
"This isn't going to be a go-to beverage for me, but it is a well done fruity witbier. Definitely drinkable, but nothing I'd rush out to buy."
"It's not a great beer, but it's pretty drinkable due to the good mouthfeel and inoffensiveness of flavor. Glad to see it in the summer mix pack instead of the cherry wheat, which I always gave away (though this is, admittedly, because I loathe cherries in all forms but raw, not because I believe this is empirically a better beer)."
"D: Very easy to drink in the summer. I did not really enjoy nor dislike this beer. Has a ""HI-C"" type flavor to it."
"D - A solid beer. Nothing special, but can drink alot of it easily."
"Pours a hazy amber color with two fingers of white head that had good retention. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. Has just a faint berry aroma. Not much in the way of witbier aroma. Maybe a little wheat aroma sneaks in but overall a very underwhelming aroma. Mild blackberry flavor, some cereal grains, very weak flavor. A grainy aftertaste. Has a light body and abundant carbonation. Overall a very underwhelming beer. I would of liked to have more of the blackberry flavor to come through as well as a stronger witbier base. I did not find it particular refreshing either."
"This is a very easy drinking Beer and Sam Adams has made a winner in this one. If you like Wit Biers give this one a try I think you will like it!"
"Drinkability- Given the weather one could really enjoy quite a few of these. They marry well with a number of dishes, or work well as an aperitif."
"D - This was a good beer, being a fan of blackberries I would have liked to have had that stepped up a bit more, but it is still a sweet thrist quincher"
"It's an ok beer, but it would of been better if the sugary part of the beer was toned down a bit."
"D: Certainly not SA's worst fruit beer (see Cranberry Lambic) but this is still undoubtedly a fruit beer as it retains very few characteristics of a witbier."
"not recommended"
"D- Easy to drink just not my favorite. If you like sweeter brews this one is for you. I'll pass on this one."
"Pours a hazy gold with brilliant white head. Smell: pale and wheat malt, sweet berry, a little yeastiness. Taste: wheat malt, an odd tangy/musty pale malt + leafy hop. Some blackberry flavor... it's being obscured by whatever spice is in here, but it starts to come thru at the end of the sip. Mouthfeel: light bodied, active carbonation. Ehh, this doesn't really showcase blackberries. For a berry wheat beer, I'd much rather have a purple haze, which itself isn't amazing, so definitely a miss from SA. This is year-round instead of the bock or dipa? Lame."
"D - Not sure if I could have many of these due to it being somewhat boring after the initial suprise of the taste. A good Sam Adams beer nonetheless."
"Not a bad beer. Just not that great."
"Overall, this is a nice summery thirst-quencher, good for drinking and not thinking too much about."
"Taste has nice hop bit really smooth and bready with good blackberry background very tasty beer. some carbonation but not to much goes down smooth and easy to just drink and enjoy i really recommend trying this."
"D: Above average."
"Overall, I find SA brews hit and miss. This one certainly isn't a total flop. I like it, but I wish they just didn't filter it."
"A heavier mouthfeel than most witbeers yet still on the light side of things. A good refreshing beer for the summer."
"D - It's a very good summer beer that tastes great, doesn't leave much to be desired, and goes down well with out tasting sugary or fake. I could demolish a six-er around a warm summer night campfire easily."
"D: Very easy despite being a bit sweet and fizzy."
"Drink is good for a tasting but definetly not for a session beer. A little to fruity and sweet."
"I didn't have much hope for this beer when I bought it, but I have changed my mind after just a few sips, don't let the berries scare you away, this is what Leinenkugel wishes they could do!"
"As for appearance and aroma..come on. I expect more from the brewers at Sam Adams. I don't usually harp about appearances of beer..but this is so far off from a wit. False advertising."
"what was sam adams thinking here - a very poor fruity example of the style - they should brew the longshot cranberry wit instead"
"This is not a bad beer, a little bit above average, and I do like the taste."
"D: Good on a hot day I bet. I would sever this brew with a chicken dish..Yah a spicy chicken dish! No not really I wo'nt be buying this one again. You try it You might like it. (I did not)"
"d- very good drinkability for a fruity beer."
"I must love self-torture cause I have a few gulps to the end. The offensive flavor kills the mouthfeel. I still have one more bottle from the variety pack to pawn off to one of my enemies."
"D - This is actual better than I had hoped for, perfect summer sipper for a hot day."
"Overall I like the taste and the idea but wish it were genuinely refreshing, instead it's just..""woah there is blackberry in my beer"". And after a few sips it become repetitive."
"D - This is a mass market appeal brew, and I have a feeling that it will sell nicely. This is approachable for the girls and non-craft beer folks, but tasty and refined enough for BA's like us to tolerate. Not bad at all. I have a feeling that this will be a summer staple in our fridge since my wife LOVES this stuff, and I think that its definitely better than Cherry Wheat."
"This tastes like I'm eating the entire potpourrie section of a grocery store. Disgusting. Skip it."
"I couldn't even finish one of these! This and the Cherry Wheat are the only Sam Adams products that I don't like; the other's are impressive when you consider the company produces on a mass scale and the beers are available everywhere."
"D. Alright overall brew. Not as strong in the fruit flavor as I expected. Pretty bitter overall, not bad, but not something I would seek out. Found in the spring sample pack."
"pours a translucent golden orange color with a decent white head. nice lacing. the nose is just straight up blackberries. smells like grape cough syrup. the taste is blackberries, subtle wheat, yeast in the finish, medium body, medium carbo. Im just not a big fruit beer kinda guy. This would be a perfect beer to get a chick drunk on though...."
"D: These fruity, slightly gimmicky beers never have a strong repeat-appeal, and this one fits the bill too. I don't need a repeat."
"Well this is not my favorite. Crisp but not overly so. Alcohol surprising for this beer. Flavor moderate. Blah."
"D - I suppose this is a decent wheat fruit beer as it has fruit flavor and is not super cloying (but still pretty sweet). But I'm left wondering where's the wit?"
"-Oelergud"
"Will definitely have this again."
"Worth drinking like most beers are worth drinking. What else can I say about that?"
"Given a choice between Sam Adams Blackberry Witbier and Sam Adams White Ale, I'd go with the latter 10 times out of 10. Even though this offering sounds good on paper, it doesn't come together well at all. Make sure you try one before springing for six."
"A one and I'm done. Good thing I've only got one."
"M/D- This one just did not do it for me overall. I realize what they are trying to do but overall I think it missed the mark for me. I was expecting more body and a bolder flavor."
"Refreshing, but a marginal witbier. Good if you like berried wheat beers."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce longneck bottle with raised lettering and a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Palate is sour fruity, easily blackberry and maybe blueberry mixed together, lightly malty sweet, and finishes sweet also."
"One finger of head that recedes to a nice foam. Pale ambe hue with a mix of sunshine yellow. Decent bubbling. Well incoporated aroma of fruit, mostly blackberries. The taste has some tart blackberries and some toasted malt and maybe some dried, yeasty bananas. Very clean, but fruity, malty, and yeasty. Grea summer session beer."
"Spice and blackberry hints in the smell. Murky, which I like, but a lack of head is disappointing. The notes are very interesting, not quite enough for what I want. But very unique taste. The palate stays a bit but not a lot. Goes down very smoothly. Glad I bought this."
"Overall, a damn good summer beer. I enjoyed this on a nice Fargo day and wanted more and more. I have a feeling I will be having this in my fridge all the time this summer. I highly recommend this."
"Drank okay, just didn't work on any level IMO, due to the soapyness"
"Better than expected. Nice job Jim!"
"D: Well, for a fruity witbier it goes down with relative ease. Not sure I'd drink more than 1 or 2 of these, but it ain't bad. Much better than Cherry Wheat or Cranberry Lambic--maybe this was SA's attempt to make a fruit beer for the beer geek crowd?"
"pretty drinkable, kinda reminds me of a smirnoff or something. prolly wouldnt recommend this to someone, unless its a chick, or someone really into fruit beers."
"Poured this into a pils glass. Looks nice, foamy head, cloudy overall. Smells like sweet-tarts. The purple kind of sweet tart. Kinda weird. Tastes more like real blackberries. The citrus flavors that weizen style yeasts poop out always mix with berries oddly, kinda making it taste different than anything that exists in nature. Still, I kinda like this one. Blackberries are my fav. Can't see myself buying a whole sixpack of this though. Kinda done with it by the end. How ironic... to be done, at the very end of the beer."
"D: Drinkable but on a hot summer day there are some other fruity witbiers that I would rather have."
"D = This is a decent beer to drink on the patio on a warm Spring day, not much more than that though."
"More sour than expected, I can take this or leave it."
"D: When I first tried this beer during the Beer Lover's Choice competition, I didn't care for it. When I made a mix-and-match six-pack today, I decided to give it a second chance. I'm pleasantly surprised with how it came together to become a decent summer beer. I still would have preferred the coffee stout, though."
"I got this beer as part of a Sam Adams sampler and was so impressed that I bought a 6-pack. I'm really digging this particular beer. It's pretty drinkable, and the blackberries make it just overall very pleasant to drink without ruining it. I've tried some other fruit beers where the fruit just ruins whatever else is in the brew, and this is not the case with the Sam Adams."
"D: Pretty decent drinkability, especially once summertime rolls around. I don't normally like fruit beers, but I've enjoyed both this and the Cranberry Wit from Sam Adams. They're doing something right, aka not overloading the fruit."
"D: Nice drinkability and one of the few fruit (berry) beers that you can consume in multiples. Nicely accented and one that would quench the thirst on a hot summer day."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability - Thin, light bodied mouthfeel. Medium carbonation. Really doesn't leave an aftertaste. This is an excellent brew for the Summer months. I can see downing a few after mountain biking or at a grill-out. The low ABV lends to it's sessionability. Sam Adams did a decent job on this one, even though it seems a bit out of the witbier category."
"Drinkability- while I think this is a decent representation of the style its not my favorite, its one that is definitely too sweet in a way for me to see myself drinking maybe one or max two of after dinner or after a meal, definitely more a summer time choice for me, an okay beer not something ill look for two often as i think if i was in mood for one of this style from them the cherry wheat is still a better pick"
"A decent refreshing spring/summer beer. Its way more 'blackberry' than wheat, and certainly enjoyable if you like berries."
"M + D: Body sits somewhere on the lighter side of medium, with a softer carbonation and a hint of dryness. It goes down very easily, and doesn't seem to even be 5.5% ABV. It's almost juicy enough that it gets quaffed pretty quickly."
"This beer turns out to be a bit better than I expected. Golden and with a slightly pinkish cast and a fairly short head. Very nice clean, fresh aroma of freh blackberries, yeast, and crisp wheat as well as a touch of orange peel. The taste isn't nearly so clean and fresh and vibrant as the aroma, but still, better than expected and not at all artificial tasting. Probably lighter in flavor than it should be, and heavy on coriander and a bit seedy. Could be juicier and more vibrant. Somewhat soft up front in the mouth but finishes crisper. I would drink this again- it's not sweet and quite refreshing and the blackberry is surprisingly decent."
"This is a well-crafter brew of which I commend the unique qualities I've mentioned above. I'm certain fruity beer lovers will gravitate toward this during hot summer days. I'll stay away though."
"D) A nice fruit flavored beer. Not a lot of beer going on, almost a malternative overall quality that will please some of the people all of the time."
"D= pretty good. Doesn't taste like much. I imagine this is what a lollipop with a blackberry flavor soaked in water would taste like."
"12oz bottle from Hannaford. Pours a hazy amber-yellow body with nearly an inch of off-white head. Blackberry dominates the aroma, with hints of spice and citrus in the background. Blackberry is rather dominant in the flavor as well, with a meshing with hints of cloves, orange, lemon zest... Medium in both mouthfeel and carbonation. Not the most drinkable example of the style, but quaffable enough. One thing comes to mind initially - Clearly Canadian soda. That said, it's a decent enough beer if you want something sweet and fruity."
" A fruit beer with decent complexity keeps things interesting."
"I expected this to be a fruity mess of a beer but it's surprisingly good."
"I am very disappointed with this beer to be honest. It is alright but not anywhere as good as I hoped. It has a sweet slightly berry smell. It has a corny taste with just a little bit of berry essence but much. It is a little bit sharp. I had to pour it hard to get the amount of head that got with some average lacing. The body is bronze amber. It has a smooth and medium mouthfeel. There is not much for carbonation at all."
"Overall - Kind of forgettable, but an enjoyable little foray into the fruity side of beer."
"Drinkability is well wont be buying this one again. If you like nice sweet fruity beers go grab some though."
"D - This is a good summer beer...solid on the fruit it's portraying...not bad for a free bottle"
"Recommended."
"The pour was light, about what I would have expected. Clear, light amber in color with a nice head of white coming up and over the top. Small lacing and nothing at all really remaining after about a minute. Light aroma with hint of fruit mixed in with lots of wheat and grain notes. Carried over into the flavor almost exactly. Light in every sense of the word. Light fruit notes, light grain and a touch of grass like flavor in the finish. It was loaded with carbonation and went down like water. Overall not bad, but I have had better for sure."
"There is nothing that would keep me from downing seven or eight of these. In fact, I suspect if this was the fourth rather than the only beer I had tonight, I would like it a whole lot more and I wouldn't be wondering who to give the other six to."
"Worth the $1.75 to try it..."
"I saw this today for the first time and had to grab a 6er. It poured up a slightly cloudy orange colour with an enormous white head that stayed in place for several minutes, so it certainly gets points for head retention. Smell was 75/25 blackberries and biscuity malt; nothing else. Taste was light malt, some spices not immediately identifiable, and then modest blackberry on the finish. The blackberry is certainly much more assertive to the nose than to the palate. Mouthfeel seemed okay, given the style, but I *would* have liked a bit more CO2, as this was nearly bereft of any at all. Drinkability is average, I suppose. A good beer, all in all, but nothing really special. Glad I tried it. I'll try it again this summer when it's 94F outside."
"I didn't care for this one too much. Strong malt with blackberry and spice. As the beer warmed up the taste seemed to get more bitter and maltier. Wasn't too easy to drink, maybe good for one but not two. I didn't feel it was a witbier, didn't compare to a Hoegaarden or other classic style. Seemed gimmicky to me. Give it a shot if you llke lambics or fruit flavors otherwise save yourself the time and money."
"Poured a cherry reddish auburn gold with one-finger white head. Smell is mostly tart blackberries and grape - akin to a light red wine w/o the oakiness. There isn't too much else going on thanks to the heavy berry smells. A light-bodied and smooth beer that almost is watery at times. This is a good drink depending on your tastes. It has an immense fruit flavor that overpowers anything else other than the sweetness (there is a barely noticeable crisp backbite). If you are not a fan of sweet or fruity drinks, this will not be for you. If you a traditional witbier drinker I'd refrain also, b/c the spices and citric/lemon tartness associated w/ wits is covered up by the berry/heavier fruits. I enjoyed this beer though, but will add that more than one or two and I'd start to get sick."
"Cheers again!"
"drinkability - Easy rinking beer, could drink a lot of these. Sam Adams did it again. Cheers!"
"Not bad. Aside from some coriander here and there, this is more of a straight-up fruit beer than anything else. Not as subtle with the berries as the bottle says, but not bad as a thirst quencher."
"Quite drinkable but still a bit pedestrian. Far superior to their Cherry Wheat."
"I was worried after reading some of these reviews, but this is a great beer for the style. I am not a witbier fan, but I do enjoy berry flavored ales. This is exceptional for the style and I'll definitely try some again."
"This is a fairly easy beer to drink. Nicely done, but there is room for improvement."
"Mouth feel is nice, with good bubbles that don't attack in a harsh manner. Pretty smooth finish. Would I have another? While I'm not a huge fan of fruit brews, this is well balanced. Lightly sweet and great flavor. Sure, pour me another."
"D: Not overly fruity, for this style. Also the taste is of natural fruit, instead of some cheap artificial additive. Balance is not bad and this is a drinkable brew."
"Pours a very clear, dark yellow colored body, with a big foamy white head, lasting, rocky. Very strong sickly sweet blackberry aroma, syrupy smelling but fresh smelling too. Fresh subtle blackberry taste, lots of malt. Grainy tasting. Somewhat nutty aftertaste with a lingering sweet berry-ness. Lightly carbonated body. Letting warm up a bit..Sweet maltiness. An okay refreshing fruit beer."
"I was tempted to prejudge this brew as rediculous effort to waste brewing resourses simply to nerd out and appeal to the geek-mafia... But it seems Boston Brewing has done a pretty good thing here..."
"The drink is lightly-carbonated, smooth, and medium-bodied, and I think one will be plenty for me."
"Overall, nothing really outstanding about this offering. However, if you like blackberry flavors, then give this one a try."
"I don't generally care for wheat beers - I got this one as a sample from a beer rep. I think the purists might look down their nose a little at this beer, but it has its appeal."
"Pours a cloudy orange gold with a thin head. Smells like blackberry or cherry cobbler. The aromas were kind of strong and overwhelming. The taste was of belgian white (of course), yeast, coriander, orange peel and then a strong blackberry or cherry flavor in the dry finish. I'm not a big fan of the cherry wheat and this beer reminded me of that. There was a watery feeling to this beer also."
"Pours a light amber with a subtle slick white head. It's partly cloudy, and looks very bubbly. Smells like berries. Tastes like berries. I think the berry flavor is too much. After a couple sips I cant tell if it's berries im tasting or something else. There is definitely an under lying taste i cant put my finger on, and it's weird. The mouth feel is good. Very light crisp and refreshing. Drinkability is so so. I wont have more than one in a row."
"Pours a straw-amber body with clean white head and light-medium lacing. My olfactory system is bombarded with an overpowering fruit aroma like berry-flavored children's multivitamins that have been crushed up, and then maybe mixed with cereal, as the malt barely manages to show through. Taste is again dominated by a fairly overwhelming amount of berry sweetness followed by a dry cereal-grain finish. I hate to be so critical of a beer, and maybe I've gotten a bad batch, or am just missing something, but the flavor is borderline-offensive. Mouthfeel makes up for it a bit, as it's got a little volume and decent carbonation. As for drinkability, I'd say moderate, as I can objectively view this as what might be a refreshing, fruity brew. That being said, I do have a personal issue with the aroma and flavor of the beer. In all honesty, I won't be picking this one up again."
"Overall, not a bad beer, especially for a fruity beer, of which I am rarely impressed. It has it's place, but I probably wouldn't buy it again."
"Color is a pale golden yellow with a very small white head that goes away quickly. Not much belgian lace. Aroma is full of fruit, not necesarrily blackberry but fruity like a wheat ale from the yeast. Flavor is very sickly fruity, not balanced. Some graininess. Mouthfeel is rather thin. OK for a game of beer pong but not one I would order again."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a 1/2"" white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a nice pale and wheat malt scent along with a fruity blackberry essence aroma. It's just like any other fruit beer, but with a bit of witbier spice thrown in. The taste is decent as well. It has a crisp, pale and wheat malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry with a sweet blackberry taste. It's tastes like blackberry extract; very fake. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an average tasting fruit beer. There's nothing exceptional going on here."
"12oz bottle into a Boston Lager glass pours a crisp pale orange with a thin head that lasts as a thin layer for a few minutes than diminishes to a ring. The aroma is an interesting blend of sweet fruits, blueberries and bubblegum, almost like grape gum in a way. The taste is a kick of sweetness with blueberry and pale malt presence and a slight hop presence in the finish. The beer is appropriately light and crisp with smooth carbonation. This is certainly an interesting variation on the style, one that could be enjoyable on a hot summer day."
"D: Very drinkable, especially for a fruit beer. I like this one a lot, but I also enjoy their cherry wheat."
"D: Easy to drink, and it avoids tasting artificial, which is a plus. A touch too watery and sweet for my tastes, but this is another solid offering from Sam Adams."
"Light flavored until the swallow, which is sour with the lightest amount of berry. One of the thinner beers I've ever had; it's also a little spritzy. Short aftertaste. All in all, a very ordinary beer."
"Drinkability: A fine beer to usher in spring with. Surprisingly refreshing and pleasant, considering how BBC's other fruit beer (Grape Pale Ale, Cranberry Lambic, and Cherry Wheat) all were total flops for me."
"The drinkability on this one is high, similar to the cherry wheat, but without the medicinal taste. The taste is much sharper on this without being overwhelming."
"It poured rather cleanly with a slight dark gold look to it with a minimum of cloudiness which I was a little dissappointed with. Almost no head to the beer...again a little dissappointing. It had a slightly sour smell with the wheat and blackberry mixing and was not at all unpleasant. It was fairly balanced on flavor, not too fruity or too lacking. In terms of drinkability, it was an easier beer than some but I wouldn't recommend more than 2 or three in one sitting."
"The beer fares pretty well. It's not what I'll reach for in a Witbier, but I expect the beer to be a hit with the Blue Moon crowd."
"The Sam Cherry Wheat is one of my summer staples, so I was expecting good things from this. The pour was nice with a golden color and decent head that was fairly sticky. Smelled something like what I was expecting, maybe a little more sweet and bitter than the mellow that I was expecting, but not bad at all. The blackberry taste however was a bit overwhelming. Reminded me of what Coors would taste like mixed with blackberry juice."
"in conclusion this beer is another quality addition to the sam adams brew master collection."
"Overall - I'm not really a fan of fruit beers. But this was a pleasant surprise. The blackberry flavor is strong, yet not overpowering. This is a refreshing beer. Great for a hot day. Much better than SA Cherry Wheat also."
"Poured from a fresh bottle into my pint glass. I'm a sucker for fruit beers that aren't overdone so I liked this. I occasionally like a Sam Adams Cherry Wheat and thought this was a lot more dry and a lot lighter in artificial flavor. It tasted like a nice balance of hops and malt with just a bit of blackberry. Mouthfeel was medium and drinkability was very easy. I could session this which is saying a lot for a fruit beer."
"This beer has a rather hazy orange-gold color. The head is small at best, though there's some nice lacing. The blackberry aroma is hardly ""subtle"" or a mere ""hint"" as the label suggests--it dominates the nose. Fortunately, it's less strong to the taste, though try as I may, I can't detect any wit flavor components. But at least it is not cloyingly sweet like many fruit beers, with a light bitterness at the finish. Medium-light body make it a decent quaffing beer."
"D: I could drink a 6'er or so. Reminds me of their Cherry Wheat with the powerful fragrance yet subtle taste of the fruit in the beer."
"-RR"
"Drinkability: Glad I got a single of this because it's not a wit in any way, shape or form. This is all fruit."
"D - I can't say I care for this much. It tastes like a carbaonated juice box. While it is refreshing, the taste is not too pleasing."
"My wife likes thse kinds of beers, so I bought her a 6 pack. Of course, I had to try one. In a pilsner glass the beer was a hazy light orange color with a small white head. It had a sweet berry aroma. I knew it was blackberry, but I couldn't tell that from the aroma. The taste was a little more straightforward in that I could tell it was blackberry, but just barely. I think there was a little citrus also. It had a metallic feel to it. Not one I'd like to drink again; my wife got the remainder of the 6 pack."
"I grabbed a 6 pick of this, as I've had some nice luck of late with the Germania group...nice new Imperial Series! A cloudy pale gold pour with lots of fizzy bubbles produced a dense fluffy white head that bubbled away fairly quickly. The aroma was a bright blackberry (go figure!) with hints of raspberry & lemon but not in an overwhelming or cloyingly sweet way. There was a fizzy crisp bite at first sip, which was not expected. The overall feel was watery & like a blackberry seltzer with a slight bitter aftertaste. The lemon-blackberry flavor was mild & not too sweet, which was nice, but I'm still not sure about this one. Not a good witbier in my book, maybe a wheat lambic? Interesting summer beer, but that's it."
"Not what I would call a strong witbier, or one indicative of the style, but a tasty brew nonetheless."
"D- never again. this beer has basically no redeeming qualities. the cap says it won a gold medal in 1986, the field must have been pretty weak back then."
"Thick and creamy mouthfeel, but the flavors are light and subtle. Taste is mostly tart blackberries, but there are some undercurrents of orange peel and wheat tangy crispness. A pretty good beer that would make a good summertime refresher."
"Not really my type of beer but this might taste good on a hot summer day. I still can't believe this beat out the Coffee Stout in the 2008 taste test challenge (the Coffee Stout was 100 times better than this)."
"Certainly worth a try!"
"D - It's not a great wit, certainly not a great flavored wit, but it is better than the vast majority of American Pale Wheats + fruit. In fact it's quite refreshing without being too challenging. A few bottle would go well with a day of work outside."
"I thought the blackberry was overwhelming. A little too heavy. I was hoping more of the wit would shine through."
"Drinkable soft beer, but only worth having once."
"D= very drinkable if you're not expecting a bold blackberry or a great witbier. Nothing exciting enough to seek out, though."
"Drinkability: I like this beer. I believe it is a very drinkable wheat. This beer takes me back to a good vacation on the Olympic peninsula with lavender and blackberries all around--so there is some personal prejudice...I am glad I got a six and not just a single."
"I've gotta tell you, I was a little disappointed in this beer. Wheat beers are tops as far as I'm concerned, but this just didn't hit the spot for me. The pour was a cloudy light gold color with a nice tall head in my pint glass. I noticed an almost artificial blackberry smell. The blackberry was also pretty stout in the taste department. It felt nice and light in the mouth, but then I was forced to swallow and repeat. The citrusy wheat taste being crossed with blackberries just doesn't do it for me."
"D 3.5 - not my first pick in a witbier, but wouldn't tunr it down at any time..."
"After drinking and reviewing this beer I read everyone elses reviews, as for mouthfeel I go something different then everyones. the place I went to get it most likely had it on the shelf for a long time. It might have conditionded differently. just a thought."
"Overall impression: I guess its drinkable, but the flavors are a bit cloying too me - I certainly won't be getting this again."
"The aroma definitely has has a berry fruitiness with detectable blackberries but not exclusively. There is also an adjunct quality to it. The appearance is hazy gold with a smaller head. The flavor is sweet but not cloying, it has plenty of berry but also lots of adjunct like malts without much in the way of wheat until the finish. The palate is smooth. Overall it is a nice beer with a couple of flaws but I like the idea here."
"Overall: I would drink this over a Leinekugel's sunset wheat, but that doesn't say much. I wouldn't recommend this."
"D- Overall, Samuel Adams Blackberry Witbier is a pretty decent beer that is worth a shot. It is not something I would purchase again, but not something I would turn down either."
"Eric"
"So, what's the verdict? Well, it's an above average beer. I want to like this beer more, but I don't. It's difficult to incorporate a fruit flavor into a beer and succeed. At least that's my view of the world. There are very, very few that pull it off. As far as this one goes, it's pretty decent. It has enough of a beer flavor to avoid being a complete disaster. It's worth a try, but it's not something I'd pick up regularly."
"D - This one is pretty drinkable. I think it would be a refreshing warm weather beer, and it's one that I'd try again. As others have said, it's not a true witbier, but still good nonetheless."
"Poured into a pint glass, cloudy burnt orange color. Initial scent of berry, then of the wheat, bready overtones. Sort of a dry mouth feel, definately easy to drink. Taste sort of reminds me of a blueberry ale. Yet this beer doesn't really have much flavor, kind of flat. Not one of SA's best. Just an average fruit beer."
"Overall, I was slightly disappointed by this release, but it's not too bad. Just a mediocre fruity beer."
"D - If anything, good for summer, however this would not be on my list"
"Ok, so this is the new Sam Adams beer. I'm sure it has it's target audience, and it's probably hitting it too. I can't help but wonder how the Coffee Stout would've done instead of this however. It's certainly the one I was hoping for, but this will have to do in it's place."
"D - Absolutely horrid. This beer was a drainpour after I got halfway through it. There's another bottle that came with the mix pack and I'm not even going to bother with it. This is a rare disappointment from BBC."
"Appears a clouded golden orange body with a large custard like creamy white head forming thick, decent retention noted. Lacing is coated evenly with each sip not bad. Aromatics offer a tart semi sour berrry note with citrus edges competing with eachother, along sided traditional Sam Adams house yeast breadiness. Flavor is again a bit sour with citrus and berry notes with a dry powdered yeast cake in the finish, spices are more prevalant in the flavor a bit of coriander and citrus peel. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a touch of cloying sweetness in the finish, did Sam Adams really need another fruity wheat beer? Overall a beer that doesn't do anything special for me I'll reach for the imperial series next."
"D: A very nice summer beer, especially good for someone who is not a hop fan but doesn't want a big malty beer. Not sure I would purchase again, but I would happily drink one if a friend handed it to me. Not a true wit, but worth trying."
"Mouthfeel is crazily carbonated. Really more like a carbonated soda. Chemical blackberriness. No real wit qualities at all. Probably perfect for a summer afternoon sorority mixer."
"PS, I noticed this after I'd been sipping on this beer awhile...after the beer's been out of your mouth for some time (i.e. when you're watching Pompey and Stoke City and forget to drink your beer) there's a kick of spicy clove that lingers in your mouth...it's just odd, cos it's not apparent at all when you're actually drinking the beer or immediately after it exits the palate."
"The beer poured into my glass a yellow orange with very little head which disappeared rather quickly. As I put the glass to my nose I got a sour blackberry aroma. It tasted alright. The blackberry was not overpowering. It tasted just like it smelled. It seems heavily carbonated. It seems more like a summer libation. It didn't hit the spot on a snowy February day. I prefer Sam Adams Cherry Wheat."
"Drinkability is moderate. The flavor profile is unimpressive, and the beer is missing some really important qualities. They should have created a great wit, and added a hint of blackberry IMO instead of going all blackberry with a hint of wit."
"When will Sam Adams come out with a super-hopped APA?"
"I was excited when I got the e-mail about this beer. I like refreshing beers. Got a six pack the other week from the local beer store. The appearance was like a normal wheat beer, slight cloudiness. The smell was very faint blackberries. The taste is very good and not overpowering. Good beer and worth a try."
"Because of the particular type of flavor, I am not sure I could drink many of these at a time. It was decent overall."
"D: Fairly drinkable. I can't see myself ever drinking more than one or two. I am not too big on fruit beers to begin with, but I am always up to give one a chance. This one doesn't disappoint, but it just doesn't capture my attention either."
"Purchased a six pack of Sam Adam's new offering, the Blackberry Witbier.The appearance is golden yellow without any haze. The aroma is completely blackberry. It has a tangy and sweet aroma that is pleasant, but perhaps a bit too strong. The taste hits up front with the blackberry, which is then quick to subside to a weak bitter taste. There is not a strong aftertaste. The mouthfeel has only a hint of carbonation, but the makes the beer have a crisp overall feel, which is refreshing. The drinkability is good. I could have a couple of these beers in a session and not get sick of them. Considering I am not a fan of many fruit beers, I enjoyed this offering. It could have been better, but overall an enjoyable refreshing brew."
"This may be a nice summer quaffer, but I dont think I will purchase any more. Who know. I could see this as another ""gateway"" beer perhaps but this one is more of a novelty than a solid, full time beer."
"D - This is an okay beer. It was very sweet and the blackberry flavor was a bit much. It mellowed and became more drinkable as it warmed up."
"I love BBC and all they stand for. Just wish they would use fresh fruit or the equivalent for their fruit beers."
"D- This takes a hit due to the medicinal blackberry flavors. Might revisit this one in the hot summer months. Worth a try though."
"Samuel Adams Blackberry Witbier is a cloudy gold ale with a white head that dissipates. The aroma is pure berry. Just berries. It is light bodied, quite bubbly, smooth and crispy. It tastes like an American Wheat. It really full of berries, slightly sweet and slightly acidic. It's a pretty unique beer."
"(D) This would be a great summer, mowing the lawn, BBQing beer. Too bad it's February!"
"Drinkability: Tastes too much like cough medicine to be that drinkable. I don't really taste any of the berry in the beer...and the high carbonation makes it taste more like a wheat soda. All of the berry is in the smell. I usually like Sam Adams' offerings, and I'm a fan of their Cherry Wheat, which others have complained about due to its 'medicinal' nature, but this was disappointing and underwhelming."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale orange color. The head is a half an inch in height, and recedes slowly into a nice firm cap of lacing. The aroma is of blackberries and tangy wheat. The taste is more beery than the aroma. There is still a lot of berries, but a lot more wheat. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a nice beer, but there isn't really anything that differentiates it from the thousand other fruited wheat beers out there. I could drink it again."
"also, they need to stop hijacking the style names. this is in no way a witbier of any sort, just as i hear the cranberry lambic is more undeserving of the ""lambic"" moniker than even the sweetest of lindeman's offerings. and let's not even get into their so-called ""hefeweizen""..."
"D- This would make a good ""mowing the lawn on a hot summer day"" beer. If this was classified a fruit beer it would score higher. As a witbier though, it's a serious disappointment."
"This would be a great summer session beer and very accessible for those just beginning to venture away from the weak offerings of the American beer cartel."
"Good. Nothing spectacular, but all-around a solid fruit beer."
"Probably not."
"Not bad. Easy to drink. Again, fruit beers aren't my forte but I'll give this beer credit for being easy to drink. A nice beer for the spring."
" Light bodied, easy to drink and the flavor is subtle enough not to conflict with most food."
"Overall , a pretty good beer to give people who don't enjoy the ""Average"" beer taste."
"I'm actually really impressed because I know some people really hated this beer. I don't try a lot of Sam Adams (I think I take it for granted), but this encourages me to try more. It's really refreshing and light with satisfying subtlety that I don't get in most of my beers. After my initial review I grabbed some blackberries from my fridge, ate some, then took a drink. Definitely highlights the blackberry in the beer even more as well. Nice job, SA."
"Drinkability: Overall, this is a decent offering, yet I wish the Coffee Stout replaced this one. I'd actually rather have a Cherry Wheat, simply because it has more body and the flavoring isn't as artificial as this. Looks like SA tried too hard to duplicate the taste of blackberry and went overboard."
"The carbonation in this brew, mixed with that fake fruit flavor, makes this feel more like a wine spritzer rather than a beer. It's medium to light bodied and crisp in the mouth - but it's not very enjoyable at all. That fake fruit, almost cough syrup-like flavor just doesn't do it for me. I'm glad I got this bottle for free is all I can say."
"Had I been in town for the taste trials, I probably would have gone with the other one."
"I'm a homebrewer and I made a Blood Orange Hefeweizen from ""Extreme Brewing"" by Sam C. from Dogfish Head, and this Blackberry Wit is almost as good. This is suprising, considering all of Sam Adams fruit beers have been terrible. There is indeed hope for fruited beer and this is the blueprint, Nay, the Blackberryprint. Awesome Beer, Great Job!"
"Overall, kind of disappointment. Still it's nice to see something new from SA."
"Very drinkable because of it's lightness, but probably wouldn't have another."
"MF/D: Drinkable beer, pretty light, tastes pretty balanced, good session beer"
"Pours a hazy golden color with a dense pure white head that settles into a ring. Definitely a couple shades darker than your typical wit. Big aroma of blackberries, honey, orange peel, and corriander round out this very sweet aroma. Too strong of a blackberry aroma. Blackberries dominate the flavor profile but wit characteristics pop through towards the end. Lighter corriander flavors and more of a cereal malt presence than your average wit. Decent malt body with lively carbonation, the berry sweetness runs throughout. The brew drinks very easy and I can see macro drinkers liking this beer. The blackberry might get cloying after a while as it does drown out any wit flavors."
"All around, a good new beer and a better option to the cherry wheat."
"d - not really what I expected. Seems to be another fruit beer in the lineup that just doesn't do it for me, though this is the best so far. Pretty drinkable and a great summer beer (much more so than the summer ale)."
"Overall another decent offering from the fellas at Sam Adams. It doesn't replace the old standby, Boston Lager."
"I am biased towards blackberries, as it's one of my top two fruit flavors, but this could've gone either way. Thankfully it went the good way. Nicely done BBC!"
"Classy stuff for a change of pace. Keep em coming"
"D: 5.5% ABV, not overwhelmed by berry flavor, and light mouthfeel makes this a decent drinker. Would be a great hot summers day beer."
"The college girls will probably dig this one but I sure don't."
"Not really much in terms of atmosphere. The blackberry smell and flavor seems a little artificial and metallic. Aftertaste is a little offensive to the palette. Serviceable quaff."
"D-Not right now at least I may sit on one or grab a single when its warmer might be better while doing some work outside on a nice day"
"Drinkability: For a hard core beer love, this is an insult. For the person that is looking for a wine cooler/beer, it will pass just fine. Nice mouth feel, medium bodied, easy to drink. I could see me drinking one on the dead of summer to cool off, but not at the pub when I need a beer."
"Nice, but uneventful overall, I've had better examples of this style..."
"Overall not a bad beer but not something I could consider a session."
"I wasn't expecting much given what this is and what I've thought of their other fruit beers (hate them). This is clearly the best of said fruit beers (not counting the Grape Ale which I actually didn't mind but it's not really ""their"" recipe), and I could perhaps drink this one again but I wouldn't seek it out, nor could I have more than one in a sitting. Give it a try, but you'll likely find it to be average, as I did."
"D: We're snowed in, and I just opened the first bottle of the six pack. It is going to be a good night."
"A different spin on the style. Sugary and grape-like. Towards the style, with a dose of blackberry. Not bad, but couldn't drink much of, at all."
"Drinkability is good on this beer. For someone that likes fruit beers, they could drink a lot of these without getting sick of them. For someone like myself that is not a big fruit beer drinker, they are still a good solid beer that is worth a try."
"While admiring the authenticity of this beer, it is a good fruit beer without being outstanding. If you're looking for a fruit beer with a strong fruit flavor, this may be the beer for you."
"Drinkability: I can see where a lot of people might like this, especially the BMC crowd, but for me its not ever going to grace my fridge or glasses. Its thin, gross and over carbonated. Wouldn't try again, not horrid, not close"
"D - A bit sweeter than your average brew but not too sweet. A step above the Cranberry Lambic."
"Picked up two bottles of these in a winter sixer sampler with the Black and Irish."
"D - I could see giving this beer to non-beer drinkers, to start them down the right path. As for a sessionable ale, I would have to say that I could not have more than one of these at a time. Way too much fruit flavoring, and not enough beer qualities."
"Purchased from the brewmasters variety 6pk. Pours a clear golden color with little to no head. Aroma is somewhat tart, not real heavy on the blackberries but you know they are there. Taste is a little tart, is weak in blackberry, but glad it is not overpowering in that department. Very easy to drink, not heavy what-so-ever, almost a watered down taste. Not very impressed, but will still drink it."
"A little underwhelmed by this, was just way too thin for me. Reminded me a lot of that Longshot Grape Pale Ale they had a few years ago. Just not much of a witbier and not much blackberry flavor. The result is a watery thin beer with a smidgen of blackberry on the swallow. Not offensive at all and easy to drink, but nothing fantastic either... I was expecting a little more from Sam Adams here."
"Could have been good in the summertime where it could replace a berry margarita. This is giving me a headache just by smelling it. Surprise surprise, my wife is a huge fan. More power to her."
"D- Way too sweet, but once you get past that... nevermind, I can't get past it. I think they could have done with a little less blackberry and a little more wit."
"I was surprised to see a couple of really negative reviews for this beer. My fiancee bought me a six-pack of it to try since it was a Sam Adams she'd never seen before, and I've really been enjoying it. The blackberry taste is nice, and not overwhelmingly fruity. I think what I like best is that it's got a great aftertaste, and is--to me--very drinkable. I could have (and have had) several in an evening. I will definitely be buying more."
" The first complete swing and miss for Sam Adams that I've had....Avoid."
"Samuel Adams has a huge winner in this brew."
"Overall: I'm normally a huge fan of all things Sam Adams. Although many do not like the Cranberry Lambic or Cherry Wheat, I feel that they are have their place depending on the time of year (I really associate the Cranberry Lambic with the holidays). Perhaps Sam Adams was trying to create another fruit-forward refreshing offering for the summer months, but this is by far their worst offering. It just tastes too much like berry-flavored cough syrup. You may want to try a bottle for the novelty, but I wouldn't recommend wasting your money on a 6-pack."
"Overall an acceptable fruit beer. The flavors are in better harmony than I had expected. I would like a little more beer flavor for a witbier. Still, the novelty is worth a try."
"It wasn't bad, just lacking in the beer flavor part of the beer."
"More of a Summer-time fruity beer..."
"Poored from 12 oz brown into standarn pint. Big head down to nothing with almost no lacing. Was not expectiung the yellow gold color was kinda hoping for a deep purple hue but oh well. It taste not so good kind of a berry mix but mainly standard witbeir. Not something I would pay for but as a freebie they are always good."
"At first the fruit is more apparent, but as it warms, the malt widens and becomes the stage on which the fruit and spice twirl. I was initially expecting a fruit beer, follwed by the idea that it would be a witbier with just a tiny hint of fruit. In fact, it falls right in between. It's not overdone, and you could have more than one, although I'm not sure how many occassions it would really fit in at. Still, it's pleasant and enjoyable. Nicely done!"
"mouth is light, and leaves a strange annoying aftertaste, maybe on a hot day this would be more drinkable but I will never buy any. Glad I didn't buy this one."
"D - A refreshing beer w/ mild fruit and enough taste to be worthy of the title blackberry wit. I guess it has more wit than ordinary wheat aspects since there is a spicy dry finish. I consider it a good beer, but only average drinkability overall"
"This was not a full beer so I will review this beer again in the future but at first taste it is not a beer I would have too often."
"5/4/5/3/12 (2.9/5)"
"*EDIT* Having now tasted the Coffee Stout, I finally DO understand how the witbier won....mildly shocked (and certainly disappointed) that SA put out two beers as lacking as these for their contest."
"Drinkability: Meh, not a huge fan. Not a drain pour, but not a favorite."
"The Coffee Stout was much better."
"Pours a very pale, transparent yellow color with a decent sized white head. The nose is nothing short of great, big tart blackberry aromas and soft, mellow wheat. The taste on the other hand is, to say the least, bad. Over ripe/rotten fruit notes that totally over powers any sort of wheat character the beer may have going on, at the same time it adds a synthetic sweetness that quickly becomes cloying. I could see how some people could enjoy this but, i drain poured it."
"Got a sample bottle from the representative. It seemed very tart to me, with a definite taste of the blackberries. It was a good brew if you like the taste of blackberry or berry fruit. The fruit seemed too overpower the taste of beer. Which is fine since the label says Blackberry Witbier. I would definitely stay away if you do not like the taste of fruit in your beer."
"Table and Vine held an event in which the Blackberry Wittbier (Wheat) was up against the Coffee Stout. I was able to sample both this afternoon. The appearance of the this one was pretty pale yellow with no real lacing or head. Aromas were the strong point for this drink. Deep blackberry aromas mixed with bready, wheaty textures. Taste and mouthfeel were a bit too watery. Although nice and light for a summery day, its strong blackberry taste (albeit weaker in comparison to the blackberry smell) did not really make this too refreshing or crisp. Overall, it had some potential, but it was definitely not balanced."
"This was a close second in the taste comparison but the coffee stout was a bit better. This wouldn't be a bad choice for a fruit beer but it wouldn't be my first choice."
