Light nose of coriander, Belgian yeast and a sweet fruity spiciness with lemon notes. Very light medium bodied with an attempt to be slick over a normal level of carbonation. The flavor profile is a bit weak, but nice. It begins with a blend of light spice that progresses to light coriander. In the middle, the citric lemon and wheat characteristics are evident. The finish is crisp with lingering notes of spice and citrus. A nice offering for a hot day session. A bit more body and flavor intensity would make this one outstanding.","tillmac62","Mar 13, 2014"

3.76,7.1,3.75,4,3.75,3.25,3.75,"The loud Crack evinced yet another brimful CAN, this one to the point that I got a bit of a spritz. The Lady is a squirter, apparently, which does not bother me, plus she is also spicy and inviting, so I feel like a good time is upcoming. We began with an inverted Glug to measure her tolerance and I found out that she does not necessarily like being turned upside-down unexpectedly, but that she deals with it nicely. The massive three-plus fingers of dense, bone-white head looked like meringue atop a lemon pie! I was so envious because as a teenage baker, I could never get my meringue right. Man, this stuf looked like marshmallow Fluf as it began to slowly fall! Before initiating my final pour, having left about a third still in the CAN, initially, I gave her a good shake to really stir things up. No sense in leaving anything in the CAN that you might want later, right? This really stirred things up, both literally and figuratively. Man, she was as angry as the hornets nest on the day that I dang near put my hand through it while retrieving a frisbee! She was swatting me with her tail and threatening to conk me with the bottle in her left hand. Color was a hazy sunshine-yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4) with some floaties in evidence. I lifted her towards me and inhaled deeply, taking in her spicy, clove-like perfume. She smelled like my first lover, an older patchouli-wearing hippie following a Grateful Dead concert on City Island in Harrisburg, PA in June 1983, shortly before I left for boot camp. She smiled at my recollection and threw her arms around me, allowing and enabling me to uncouple her seashell bra, which I kept as a souvenir (Don't believe me? See my Facebook picture from Iron Hill's Mahalo, Apollo! release party when I wore it in her honor). Ah, what a Lady! The mouthfeel was on the thin side, and the style usually evinces such, but the spices were just about right, said as I toss my golden locks. I agree with an earlier reviewer that it falls short of Hoegaarden, but if I wanted a Hoegaarden, then I would have purchased one, wouldn't I? That is a non sequitur, but nor have I reviewed the one that he felt was overly spiced. I CAN only tell you what I like and I liked this beer. It probably would not measure up as a Hula in the Coola Day (01 Feb, annually) beer because it is more suited to warm weather. Really. Have you ever made love in the water? Cold water sucks for that purpose. Fair winds and following seas, my Grey Lady! I'll see you in the summer.","woodychandler","Dec 05, 2013"

What's particularly interesting about this beer is that you don't get a big hit of orange or coriander like many wits, but what you do get is a very balanced and surprisingly floral beer, with notes of peaches (particularly in the aroma), tangerines, melon, and even a bit of the white of the watermelon, with a finish of lemon juice in water.

A cloudy amber color with big white bubbles on top and no lace. The nose detects a polite wheat and toffee combo covered in fruit nougat and mild citrus hop. The flavor is a bit odder with a musty, more herbal hop with orange tea and grassy edges. The hops work nicely to redefine this tried and true Blonde. It definitely grows on you as the must fades and more lemony ideas emerge. It’s medium-light bodied with typical vague carbonation. In the end it is a hit. Well done!","Durge","Feb 02, 2012"

When you burp have people stand back it hits with citrus fury and coriander cantor from your nares and stomach.

Deep straw in color, it pours with a thin head and the first sip reveals a noticeable herbal hoppy nose, perhaps indicating dry hopping. Light and spicy, there is only a faint whiff of the expected fruitiness. Instead, this is more of a spicy little pale ale with a little estery twist.","rings","Jan 26, 2011"

The nose comprises cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, wheat, coriander, and lemon zest. The taste holds notes of lemon zest, cardamom, coriander, light wheat, orange peel, and a tiny stab of hoppy bitters.

The aroma lends to its witbier nature, with yeast. lemon and pepper. The flavor likewise offers this up in a bright, bubbly but not too thin or light-bodied way. Clean and a bit creamy, this is a lovely summer beer, and not an IPA as my buddy thought (since it was called an ale!).","selecter70","Feb 07, 2010"

Oranges dominate the aroma, followed by lemons and some pepper, plus some floor polish-- the lemon kind, of course. Nice stream of bubbles in the glass, too. A real battle in the taste between the oranges and the lemons. The oranges come out on top, but not in a good way. Very little evidence of yeast or any real beer flavor: this is mostly a citrus cooler. And the beer is surprisingly flat given the bubbles. It tastes more like an orange rickey than beer-- just add ice, a swimming pool, a cheap novel and a humid afternoon. Blahblah. Pass.","gfreed","Jan 01, 2010"

This beer pours a dull, murky, gold with just a hint of a off white head that leaves absolutely no lacing and has very crappy head retention. This actually is one of the ugliest beers I've head the pleasure of pouring. The aroma is rather weak. Hints of lemon zest, cardamon, bready yeasts, and just a bit of ripe fruits. The flavor follows suit pretty closely. Ripe apples and pears, cardamon, biscuits, and just a slight tang used from the wheat malt. The mouthfeel is light with a bright carbonation and a bready dryness.

3.95,12.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"More importantly, Cisco's Grey Lady offers something that many American versions of the witbier style don't - refinement! The nose expresses wheat malt with a hint of coriander. It's far from overly spicy, and it's certainly not tart and fruity, or even chalky with citrus rind or yeast. Rather, there's just a pleasant edge to awaken the nose in an otherwise basic beer. The body is light to medium, as it should be; and the pinpoint carbonation is delicate but effervescent enough to bristle the tongue. The flavor follows suit with the aroma, but there is a bit more fruitiness to it (mainly orange, with some minor lemon). Once again, however, it's kept to a minimum, and it acts as a part of the beer rather than its main focus. It's delicate and refreshing, with just enough residual fruit and spice left in the aftertaste to remind you that you're drinking something just a little bit more interesting than the standard fare. Worth trying. And based on personal experience, a great summer quencher!!!","NeroFiddled","May 04, 2008"

The smell is floral, yeasty, with a touch of spice and fruitiness, like clove and pineapple and lemon. The taste is very interesting. It has all of the spicy, floral and citrus tastes of a classic wit, but there are some interesting added spices here. My guess is a touch of cardoman. The carbonation improves the overall mouthfeel, which is usually fairly watery for a witbier. There is a bit of a pepperish bite in the finish, which makes the experience even more enjoyable and lively.
