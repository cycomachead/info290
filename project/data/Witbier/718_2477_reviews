"This is a refreshing, easy to drink Wit. Back when Pierre Cellis ran Hoegaarden that was the go to wit but after Interbrew gobbled it up and instituted high gravity maching to reduce costs, Wittekerke was the best Belgian wit left standing. It has the light straw color and a thin, white, fairly quickly dissipating head. Orange peel and spice aromas greet the nose. It has a refreshing, citrusy, spicy taste perfect for drinking with a pot of mussels and pomme frites. It is light yet full flavored."
""
"D - Unbelievable. This beer is so full of flavor yet remarkably refreshing. It's not too heavy, not too light, and nearly perfectly balanced. In truth, it's probably the best white beer you can grab. Top notch."
"Strong head. Delicate aromas of fruit, orange peel. taste the same bitterness average."

"Delightful! Like Hoegarden, but better. The most lemony beer I have ever had, framed well, with yeasty notes, and a crisp refreshing finish. Looks great too."
"Finish: Semi-dry"
"A bit disappointing.  Too heavy on the sweet orange.  Hides the yeast notes.  While it is a Witt from Belgium there are better examples."

"The feel of this beer is light with a nice drinkable feel that goes down easy and leaves no aftertaste."
""
""
"Pours a light straw with a thin white head. Good retention, and nice lace. Aroma is of fruity spices, and candy. Body is light and creamy. Taste is of orange, and sweet tart fruit. Very easy to drink."
""
"Pours a light yellow golden with almost no head. Faint taste of orange peel. Light and smooth, but too light. Besides the orange peel, taste is almost an afterthought. A nice summer drink..."

"I liked this beer from the very first sip. There's is a  noticable level of citrus that iwill subdue your taste buds with pleasure. That is if you like citrus. This is a great beer to charish after a  long hot day. It has a cool and crisp finish that will make you say ahh, relaxation time."

"Overall: This is a very nice wheat beer that I'm glad I picked up. It has a nice mix of flavors that are all traditional for the style. Would drink again."
""
""
"This beer was an okay beer. It has an hazy and golden yellow color to it. The aroma was a good smell, at least I liked it. The taste was pretty good as well. I liked the green apple taste that it has. I could smell some vanilla in the aroma as well. I"
"Crisp and refreshing wheat beer - great flavor and color."

"Overall: A nice witbier. Not fantastic, but nice. Out of a can too."
"Overall: Very surprised here. Listed as a Wit but has the saltiness and light funk of a Gose. Either way I would not hesitate to reach for one of these."

"For yeast lovers this is a superb witbier that achieves near perfection, at least for my palate."

"330 ml bottle into pint glass, 41010 bottle code. Pours very hazy bright golden straw color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, apple, wheat, bread, clove, pepper, coriander, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon zest, pear, apple, wheat, bread, floral, grass, herbal, clove, pepper, coriander, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon zest, pear, apple, wheat, bread, floral, grass, herbal, coriander, light clove, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a very short bit. Good balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; with decent robustness and a very dry finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good witbier. Good balance of yeast, malt, and spice flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."
""
"Mouth: Insanely smooth and evenly carbonated. No stinging bubbles, and the ample amount of yeast sediment gives it a robust creaminess."
""
""
""
"Wittekerke pours a bright straw color with a small lacing head. There is a sweet fruity banana like aroma, with strong ester notes. The taste is light and mellow, crisp malt undertones, with fruity esters finishing it out. Good body, weak flavor. Overall a decent beer, light and crisp."
""

"Overall a sub par wit."

"a light straw yellow color about a one finger head and a light lace covering. nose is light with a lemon grassy smell. taste of mild citrus and light wheat malt. mouthfeel is smooth light clean. wheat beer is a style i like and i think a little more body to the taste would have made it that much better. i would buy again."

"The was OK, but a bit thin, even for a style not noted for fullness. Drinkability was good, I could see throwing a sixer in a cooler for a day of tubing or whatever. Overall, an OK brew, certainly not among the best of the style, but perhaps a good introductory example."
""
"O- Not fantastic, but a nice beer for putting a bunch away on a nice hot day. That's what I'll buy it for."

"And the light carbonation does not help. Lacing zest, I would have been satisfied with a good bubble and dryness. Instead it seems a bit filmy and sweet. Surprising with the huge head, but this one seemed a bit flat."
""
""
""
"O - five more in the fridge should go down easy on a hot day. Nothing amazing, but a nice lighter brew. Glad I bought it - man does not live by hops alone."
"Overall: If you are looking for a beer to help ween some friends of their bud and miller lights, this would be a good one to break out on a hot summer day."

"Not really my favorite style of beer, really quite far down the list of styles I like, but putting that aside this beer was quite tasty and easy to drink. A wheat beer that I can actually drink, I don't know if that's good or bad for me to like a wheat beer."

"Overall, I don't think I'll have this beer again; it really isn't my style. If I want a Belgian White, I'll stick to Rickyard's White."

"Witbier in a can, ahhh. Cloudy light straw with a thin head of white that doesn't last long. Faintly musty, tart lemon juice and orange zest upfront. Rustic wheatiness in the middle with more citrus at the finish. Super dry. It starts off really but finishes a bit insipid."

"O - There's no denying the refreshing and overall light, uplifting qualities of this beer. It may not really impress in any single area, and the chalky character was certainly a bit different, but it's extremely easy to drink. On a hot day such as today, I finished this glass off in no time and could have consumed another."
"I want a good Wit to either taste like Hoegaarden, Allagash White, or Triangle White, but this just doesnt. Its light and drinkable, which it has going for it. But thats it. Lack of spices really kills this thing."
""
""
"O- A light and refreshing beer, but seems a bit undertoned. Solid, but there are better options for this style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- An average to below average witbier, not something I would want to try again"
"Mouthfeel and Overall - This was the perfect beer to get with spicy wings. I could have easily drank this all night. Light bodied and extremely refreshing."
"Nice refreshing summer brew."

"A great summer beer. Simple flavors and excellent feel. Kinda reminds me of diluted lemonade. Very refreshing."
""
"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured a hazy pale straw yellow with a two finger white head that subsided to half a finger very slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, banana, grain, and spice. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, plantain, and subtle spices. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. This one really left me desiring more from it. The flavor was really quite muted and didnâ€™t have a lot going on in it. For the style it was average to say the least, but definitely nothing more than that. At least the aroma was a little nicer to bring it up above an average brew of the style. Worth trying for a craft brew n00b, but if you enjoy a good Wit, I would look elsewhere personally."

"This is great Ale for summer time. Nothing is over the top and it is very refreshing to drink. I like it!!!"

"12oz can. Pours a hazy pale yellow with a medium lasting white head with some lacing. Aroma of wheat, light malt, yeast with some light citrus notes. Taste is wheat, yeast, some grassy hay and sweet citrus notes. Palate is a light body with mild carbonation. Finish is wheat, some grassy citrus notes, light banana and malt flavor with some light bitterness on the end. Overall a good refreshing session wheat ale."
""
""
""
"overall - 4/5 - I'm not a huge fan of wheat beers, but the Belgian yeast takes it in a very nice direction. Nice for a warm sunny day."
""
"Review from 5/2011 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. ours a hazy yellow with a half finger of head with moderate lacing. Aroma of wheat, yeast, and the toffee like bready witbier aroma. Taste follows, mild, pleasant wheat with a hint of citrus, and doughy finish. Nothing remarkable, but a pleasant, low key witbier. Light to medium bodied."
""
"This was a decent beer, the flavor was very balanced and had good flavor, overall though it was pretty average. I would drink this again but wouldn't be really looking for it."
""
""
"O: Not a bad Wit, but nothing really stands out with this one... Little more plain Jane than I was expecting."

"Pours a murky light whitish yellow with a 1 inch puffy white head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Lots of clumpy sediments settles at the bottom of the glass after the pour. Random streaks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grains, spices, yeast, and some very fruity aromas. Taste is extremely fruity up front with some grain flavors on the finish. This beer has a crisp level of carbonation with a bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but it doesn't remind me too much of a traditional witbier. Much more fruity than others I have tried in the past."
""

"Sometimes you can't fight the late-night cravings for some brews, amiright? This one pours a hazy lemonade topped by about a half-finger or so of short lived off-white foam. The nose comprises wheat (bordering on sourdough), coriander, lemon zest, and a pinch or so of cardamom. The taste leans more heavily on the spicy side, with the cardamom and coriander meshing with newcomer black pepper. The lemon zest is still there, but a tad more subdued and enveloped by a slightly more assertive bit of wheat. The body is fairly light, with a moderate carbonation and a crisp-ish finish. Overall, a nice, easy-going, unpretentious wit. Good times, really."

"O: I was much more impressed with this beer the more I drank it. The appearance and smell are greatly lacking, though. Overall, I think it is a good beer, especially for one out of a can."
"Cheers!"
"Seeing how I drank this from the can, I can't really give a proper appearance judgement, so I'll just go about middle of the road in the rating, going by the general consensus. Typical wheat profile in the nose, citrus zest, and slightly metallic (plus the can). Taste of wheat, a bit sharp, lemony zest, and hints of spice. Light body, refreshing, and quite drinkable, especially for a summertime tailgate."
"O - Overall, this was somewhat of a disappointment. Expecting much more but this was simply an average witbier."
"Overall Drinkability - I'm going to have to review this again some other day just to make sure this wasn't a bad can. As it stands it's a horrible beer that I never want to have again, but feel obligated to just to make sure it wasn't skunked."
"O: This beer does have some good qualities, but it's certainly an uneven brew."
"O: I must say, my first canned Belgian beer was a bit of a disappointment."
"Worth a shot for a Witbier."
" Love the wheat!"
"This is a good wit and, in my mind, true to tradition."
"Sampled from a can - best by August 14, 2012. Pale yellow in color with a thick haze. Poured with a frothy white head that quickly reduced to a wispy cap. Wheat malt and lemon zest aromas with a hint of pepper in the background. Medium bodied with assertive, refreshing carbonation. Creamy smooth feel with a clean finish. Wheat and biscuit flavors up front with lemony citrus bitterness in the middle and a light peppery undertone throughout. Finishes pretty clean and is very refreshing. A great summertime wit,that's fairly simple and goes down really easy."
"Light bodied with excellent carbonation, this beer is a real pleasure to drink. Like a wheat beer should be, Wittekerke does not coat your mouth, nor get sticky. Instead, it is easily sipped, gulped, and everything in between. The mouthfeel is perfect for when you are dying of thirst and don't want to have to taste much."
"This one pours a very, very light and bright almost somewhat hydrated urine yellow in color. It smells of light malts with a strange funk. It doesn't smell like someone would do this intentionally. It almost smells like BMC salty grains. No bueno. It is sooo light and there really isn't anything wit related present. It's the lightest wit I've seen, it's the lightest wit I'm smelled, it's the lightest wit I've tasted. It doesn't feature the normal flavors or aromas. This is far below average in my opinion. It's thin in body and the flavor is so off that this isn't even drinkable. I know this is fresh yet it falls sooo flat. Oh well. Avoid this one."
"O â€“ Decent brew here that is great for a hot summer day. This is really solid ice cold but as it warmed it was not nearly an enjoyable. Itâ€™s a great brew for a hot summer day. Keep em cold and put em down."
"comes out a light yellow opaque with a thin white head that has some lacing and ok retention. wheat is the main thing on the nose here with coriander and clove floating in the background. nose could do with a bit more presence and complexity but what is there isnt bad. taste comes in with again wheat coriander and clove and adds banana as well it then slides into a overly grainy into hop finish that leaves this one really lacking. everything up to that grainy finish is great and it just seems to slide away at the end. good carbonation in this with a nice light body tiny bit of a hop puckering felt in there which is a nice touch. overall though this thing does everything well but the overly grainy taste leaves this falling short of the mark."
"Pours a hazy yellow with a fluffy white head that stuck around in my glass for quite some time and left a bit of lacing. Lemon peel and coriander on the nose and a bit of grain. Flavor is lemon, orange and coriander with a touch of sweetness and a decently long finish. It's been a while since I have had this beer and I especially since I have thought about it critically while I drank it, it has long been a camping/ pool beer for me and I am usually not taking notes in the pool... When I look back on my initial review, I was definitely a little green at that point (reviewing a beer straight from the can:) but my overall feelings haven't changed much, this is a solid example of the style, if a bit one note. It is also a beer that I would happily take on any outdoor pursuit where beer is desired."
"Overall / Drinkability: A great post-yardwork beer - crisp and refreshing. I think it would go well with food as well. Interestingly, one is all I want right now. It's good, but it leaves me not wanting more. I'm somewhere between pleasantly sated and thinking ""Umm, no more right now - maybe later."" Definitely above average, but I can't exactly call it good in the end. Overall though - nice looking beer with a good simple taste. Not an amazing witbier, but a good one."
"The mouthfeel okay. It had the sizzle of a wit. But in the end, I dumped out the last quarter of the glass."
"O- I was obsessed with this beer when I first started drinking Belgium and craft beers. After not having this for awhile, I'm not blown away like I was when I first had it. However, this is a good drinkable beer and really good on a warm day. At 5.0% ABV, it's pretty good."
"Purchased 6-pack cans shrink wrapped in plastic in Seattle (Metroploitan Market Lower Queen Anne). Pours smooth with little head, leaving a consistent, thin foam ring around the top of the beer as it's being consumed. Cloudy and straw-colored (as it should be), this drinks very well cold and fairly ok warm, but hits its peak served very cold. Most white beers often require additional citrus slices to balance out the beer and ""make"" it what it should be (think Shocktop or Blue Moon), but the blend of ingredients with this beer doesn't need any doctoring. It goes down smooth with a solid citrus and coriander taste, offering a consistent little bite in the back corners of the tongue and mouth. The carbonation is mild enough to drink heartily, but the taste and mouth feel want you to slow down and savor such a quality drink. This is a great beer for those with a domestic palate (Bud, Coors, etc) who are searching for a foreign, high quality white zesty beer made the RIGHT way. There is no need to add anything to this well-balanced, high quality witte beer!"
"I quite like how the various usual witbier suspects are so well blended in this offering. Equally detectable, yes, but better when appreciated in context with the others. The burgeoning summer-like weather would seem to cry out for this kind of beverage - I would agree, with the caveat that this particular one could be enjoyed year-round."
"Appearance is a yellow tone with cloudiness. The smell is citrus, primarily lemon, wheat too, a faint aroma in general. It tastes of corn, orange, some light spices. MF is light and clean, finishes dry. I think this is a pretty good wit and a good option to have a couple of while doing a spring clean up in the yard."
"( 39/50, 5% alc/vol, Vineyards) Cloudy white, with an orange hue. Has a small head of beige that dissappears rather quickly. Chunks of sediment hover in the beer, eventually fall, only to rise at each sip. Chunks so big you can tell what spice it is (orange peel, clove, corriander). Soapy, round, orange peel and watermelon essence. Sweet, fresh and corriander exploding from this white beer. Fruity tropical and round aromas that entice. Honey is pretty present. Incredible corriader and fruity yeast flavours. Strong sweet and fruity palate. Soft and slightly acidic-tart citrus that gives it a good tang. Slightly lifeless but ever so flavourful. Hoppy, soapy and floral hops gives it a nice oily texture that glides very. Body is rather thick feeling and heavvy due to sweetness. Delicious, refreshing and fruity. Great witbier coming from a solid brewery. Try it with mussels or olives."
"Overall not bad but I have had better. Not sure of some of the lower reviews comparing this to Sprite or Michelob Ultra. Definitely had more body than those lackluster beverages. Wouldn't buy it again but worth trying."
"O: A good beer in this style."
"Overall, I cannot recommend this beer to anyone, even if you love a good Wit Bier."
"Opinion: This is a pretty decent beer no doubt. For being so light, it has a deep flavor and aroma profile. It has a reserved, but well blended profile all the way around. I do have to comment that, while I am warming up to can beer in general, in this case the can makes it hard to get a good Belgian pour of your beer, so it ends coming out sloppy so that you break the tension in the beer and it will flow. The first two I poured, I tried to pour too slowly, so it ran back the side of the beer and spilled all over the place. I am thinking that the bottle or draft may be a different experience, so I will plan to try those too if presented the opportunity."
"Overall - I really like the flavorings of this beer. I'm a big fan of Belgian beers, not so much on wheats, but this one is very good. Light easy drinker and great for a spring, summer patio, evening beer. Highly recommend!!"
"O: This was much better than I expected and it holds up with the best in the style."
"Overall, I guess that I expected more, but I still enjoyed the beer and if given the chance to pick up some bottles I would."
"The color is weird. Almost green in the glass. Cloudy as all hell. But I'll drink anything. The second one I drank much warmer and it had more flavor, but still well balanced and light."
"Good, and interesting, though certainly not my favorite witbier. I would like some more citrus (especially orange) character, and the funk throws me off a little bit."
"Drinkability- Enjoyed two back to back. Had a buffalo chicken wrap and chips w/ guacamole with my second can. Reminds of of days when I used to live in Wien, Austria. A great memory bier!"
"D - I have to say I expected a little more flavor and body from this one. Not what I expect from witbiers. Having said that, I still enjoyed this beer quite alot. Its an easy sessionable beer and one I would love for the river in summertime. Like I said, not my idea of witbier, but an easy drinker nonetheless."
"D - Definitely a sessionable brew, this beer would be a great refresher on a hot summer day. Both drinkable and flavorful!"
"Pours a hazy, dull whitish-yellow color; thin off-white head with patchy lacing. Light aroma of bananas, light clove, and lemon soda; very light nose; like seltzer water and hefeweizen. Medium mouthfeel: lively, fluffy carbonation; solid amounts of lemon seltzer water, bananas, and lightly toasted malts upfront; basic biscuity malts; light character overall, but, in all honesty, I could drink a fair amount of this; an effervescent, light witbier. Medium finish: toasty malts, light banana, a touch of light spiciness."
"D: The beer is extremely easy to drink and has some refreshing qualities."
"D: Drinkable, not overly carbonated. Goes down easy although tastes a little thin. Would benefit from a twist of orange."
"Hey! It's a beer. That's about the extent of my enthusiasm for this beer (and what it gives to you, too). I wish I had checked with BA ratings before trying this, I would have passed on the chance (wouldn't mind my $2 back). Misses some of the key aspects of the wit style. Probably the blandest Belgian beer from Belgium that I've tasted, and that's not a compliment."
"A disappointment. This is really missing some of the pleasant lilting spice and the round mellow characters you can get with a witbier. It's light and drinkable enough, but it also feels very flat. Not a good example of the style."
"D - Can drink this easy enough without noticing it. It's nto good, but it's not like I hate it."
"D: As stated above, I've had this before and don't remember it like this. Maybe it is because it is in a bottle (couldn't locate a freshness date) but I can't put my finger on it."
"Drinkability: A very pleasing brew."
"This is a very solid wheat beer with a nice easy flavor. Very smooth and light in your mouth. I could have had a few more of these and would have if they weren't $6.50. Definitely a good beer though and worth a try if you see it."
"definitely a summer quencher or thirst slaker. easy going and approachable. but quite average in all respects."
"Notes: I sure can see how this could fit in certain settings and surely I would take it ahead of a macro, glad to have had the chance to try it in any case."
"The beer pours out of the can a cloudy yellow with a thin white head. Slight smell of citrusy wheat maybe lemon grass. Crisp beer, with a tastey citrus wheat and some yeast. This is a light beer and very drinkable but its light on flavor and eveything else."
"Drinkability: I would not be suffering to sit and drink these but it would not be by my choosing in the future"
"D: These are easy to drink on hot summer days. I could see this as being a lawnmower beer. I would have this again."
"drinkability - yes you could pound these all day but what the point"
"Poured this from a can to a very hazy pale yellow. Not much head to speak of, but what was there was white. Lots of lemon in the scent along with a bit of yeasty clove. Not a whole heck of a lot of taste here. Lemon is very faint. The spiciness shows itself here more than in the scent. There's definitely clove and coriander. There's a hint of pepper on the back end as well. Refreshing feel as it makes its way down your throat. I'd have it again, but there are certainly other beers I more enjoy in the style."
"I poured into a pint glass to a half inch of white head that settled to a thin cap. This beer is a hazy, pale yellow. There are plenty of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. The aroma is spicy yeast. The taste is some more of that spicy yeast but not much else. It's pretty bland tasting. I'm not getting the typical orange and coriander. It has a bite from the carbonation. It goes down easy but it is nothing special."
"This is a nice citrusy refreshing brew."
"D - Again, delicious! I totally dig this Wit, and it would benefit as an accompaniment to a meal."
"D - Very easy to drink a bunch of them based on how smooth it is. But with a lack of taste, it really doesn't leave me wanting more."
"Overall: An average witbier with nothing really outstanding. Worth a try especially in the summer."
"Wit looks like a typical wit in that it has a hazy orangish yellow look with some chunks/debris floating within the drink especially when the dregs are poured in. Nice sheets of lacing. Smells like a wit in that I get wheat, pale malts and some underlining spices. In taste the wheat is more pronounced than the orange and coriander, pale malts are not to shabby either. A simple drink in a can no less. Feel is light bodied with a ample carb. I liked it, but not enough to go for it again, I'll just stick to my Allagash White."
"D- nice and tasty not a real standout of for as far as the style goes but enjoyable all the same."
"Conclusion: I was looking through my reviews the other day, saw how low I'd rated this beer the one other time I had the canned version, and figured something MUST have been wrong w/that can. So I deleted the review and gave it another shot. Nope. It's just pretty bad. And this one is well within date too, so...My friend and I used to drink the Wittekerke bottles all the time and loved it; it was my first Belgian White that wasn't a Blue Moon. I dunno what's happened since then, or maybe my tastes have just changed THAT dramatically...at any rate, pass this one on by"
"Drinkability: this beer isn't spiced the way I'm used to witbiers being and it doesn't quite have the normal refreshment factor for me. Still, it's not too bad and is relatively drinkable."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale yellow color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of wheat, and not much else. The taste of wheat with a hint of orange. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation. Overall, this is a decent witbier at best. I don't think I would drink it again."
"Mouthfeel was the winner here."
"Overall this wasn't the most flavorful wit in the world but it's real easy to drink and is more refreshing than most. Worth a shot."
"D - Nice little summertime session beer."
"Drinkabilitly - Summer brew, of course, that would go down very easy on those hot days."
"Completely lacking the body and spicy flavor I expect from a witbier, this ends up resembling an American light lager in its bitter metallic aftertaste. Although it's thin enough for heavy consumption, I can't imagine anyone wanting to drink something that is so unappealing and uninspired."
"O: Ive heard alot of people say good things, but this was not my draft of beer. I couldn't pull any malt sweetness out of and quite frankly tasted like adjunct lager. I would have liked more malt character, fruity, and spicy notes out of this one. The appearance however was spot on, just not aroma or taste."
"If you are looking for a Belgian wit beer, I can think of several better versions, including some American brewed clones."
"D - This beer is an outright embarrassment."
"This would make a great entry beer for those who are scared to stray from their mass produced watery American pilsners & lagers."
"A nice session beer on a hot day, and/or a nice match for an Italian or Greek salad."
"Drinkability is excellent, I could easily see having two or three in a night."
"I tried this beer on May 21, 2009 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a hazy yellow gold with a thin white head. The aroma was a conconction of wheat malt, some banana, and some peppery spices. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation, and the flavour was grainy, wheat, and some spicy bitterness to finish off."
"D: Different, but overall it's less than average. I can't get into it."
"Swirl poured into a glass beaker. Hazy amber with a two finger fluffy white head which soon flattened to thin layer. Strong lacing. Smells lemony citrus up front with some complex spiciness going on. The taste is surprisingly mild. Citrus less apparent but there is a pleasant spicy blend. Very nice mouthfeel. The fine carbonation blends nicely with the spice flavours perking up a fairly light drink. Drinkability is high for a very drinkable style. Bring on summer!"
"Future outlook: Very pleasant, if unspectacular beer. Who knows....I won't seek it out, but it could end up back in the fridge someday..."
"I feel like I could drink too many of these without knowing it, which may or may not be a good thing."
"D: Overall, refreshing, but doesn't live up to what a witbier can be. Rather disappointed but at least it's easy to drink. If I had to do it over again, I think I would pass this one over and get something else."
"D - considered drinkable because its so light and airy, yet not too enjoyable. read a few reviews describing this as a ""wheat light"" and there really isnt much more to say beyond that."
"This stuff is really easy to drink. No offensive flavors and very well hidden alcohol. I only bought one but could have easily finished off a six pack of these."
"Drinkability - With this flavor I don't really want another one. For lemon lovers this could be worth a try but its not my thing."
"Serving type: can"
"D: A tad sweeter than most wits and a good flavour. I quite liked this one, I haven't had it in the longest time, I was glad to revisit it."
"d - very good."
"Not a bad beer but I would prefer to try it in a bottle to see if its any different."
"Flavor is spicy lemon rinds, with quite a bit of cloves and licorice. Wheat graininess is there aplenty but it seems to be missing the creamy body and mild sweetness found in many witbiers. Drinkability is high and would be easy to kill a few of these in a sitting. Not bad, but it is hard to pick this over a hoegaarden at roughly the same price point per sixer. Still a fun beer to try though and would make a good canned choice for a beer to float the river or chillin' on a beach."
"D: Because I can't seem to shake the feeling that I think I'm drinking Tequiza, this one isn't a brew i would re-visit over and over again. For a once in a while thirst quencher, perhaps, but not in the top ten of witbiers that I've had."
"D: Overall, it is refreshing, but to me does not live up to what a witbier can be. Rather disappointed I must say, but at least it's easy to drink. If I had to do it over again, I think I would pass this one over and get something else."
"Overall- Pretty good for style, but a bit too fruity and not quite enough of a yeasty/wheaty bite that I would like for a Wit. Still quite tasty and a great summer beer that I may bring to Bonnaroo with me this year!"
"This is an ideal session beer for beer enthusiasts. Belgian beer pong anyone?"
"Drinkability: It's not like I had to choke this down or anything. It was a decent beer, but in all honesty I wouldn't bother with it. There are other examples of this style that are readily available and superior."
"O: A metallic mess, avoid at all costs in the steel can."
"It pours with an out of control head that almost spills out of the glass. Crazy looking carbonation bubbles mixing with the yeast creates an amusing visual when waiting for the head to shrink. Color is foggy yellow. The smell is a bit floral, and a little sour. There is also a hint of fruity yeast. Taste begins with a fruity yeasty taste that leads to a mild sourness. The finish is quite yeasty. The carbonation was a little excessive in the beginning but went on the flatter side quite quickly. Overall an ok Witt that was quite reasonably priced. Not the best Witt but a very drinkable average Witt."
"As far as taste goes, I enjoyed it. But, then again, I love witbiers. The body is light but smooth. The flavors are rounded, subtle, complex. At first it seems dry and spicy. However, the more the beer explores the palate, a creamy sweetness reveals itself."
"Wonderful in appearance, pours a very hazy pale yellow color with a small fluffy white head. Rather light aroma, some faint spice and lemon skin. Light in body a bit sharp around the edges, well carbonated, refreshing and highly drinkable. A value Belgian Wit for sure."
"Had on tap at Capital Alehouse in Richmond. Very pale, very cloudy yellow with about 3/4 inch white head. The smell was fairly weak and breadier than I was expecting. The taste was very refreshing. I could sit and drink these nonstop. The taste was wheaty, almost to the point where it was more like a hefe weizen than a witbier. There was a very strong citrus taste toward on the finish that got stronger as the beer warmed. Nice balanced carbonation. The mouthful and drinkability were both great. Again, I could sit and drink these all day."
"Value: I paid $1.59 for a can, as a trial beer it's worth that price. I've seen it in six packs for around $8.50 and at that price, I'd say it's a decent value but not great. I have to wonder if I'd ever choose this over a decent hefewiezen priced at a buck and a half less. I doubt it."
"Pours a super cloudy pale yellow with a thin white head. Smells strongly of a Belgian yeast strain. Taste is very light and grainy up front, but the middle and finish have nice Belgian yeast esters. Very little spices though. Mouthfeel is good, nice low carbonation. Drinkability is good, light and refreshing. Overall a nice beer, though a touch bland."
"D - Not the best Witbier out there but I could see drinking a couple of them."
"Light bleached blonde, the whitest cloudy white ale I've ever seen. Smooth creamy white head that leves plenty of fine lace on the glass. The nose is orange candy, wheat malt, vanilla and coriander. The flavors are milder than the nose suggests but the same, orange peel, Belgian spice and wheat. The mouthfeel is pretty thin for the style and highly carbonated with a slight asprin bitterness in the finish. A nice beer but not in the same league as the best of the style."
"Picked up a single at PHP in Brookline. Poured into an Ommegang Witte glass. Very carbonated, you can hear the head crackling like Rice Krispies. Hazy yellow color. Average smell, faintly grassy. Taste was just slightly above average. Had some nice coriander and lemon taste, but it was very muted. Mouthfeel was thin and a bit soapy. Easy to drink, smooth, and low abv makes it goes down without thinking. Not much to this beer, just kind of a run of the mill witbier that quenches the thirst but doesn't blow me away."
"Poured into a pint glass; hazy golden with less than a finger of white head. The smell was one of lemon, orange, and feint allspice. The taste was more intense, with the spiciness surprisingly more prominent than the citrus. Spritzy, medium body; a nicely spicy session beer."
"Mouthfeel is light but highly drinkable."
"Pours hazy, opaque yellow with a good size creamy white head. Good looking lace. Typical witbier spice and yeast smells. Light wheat flavor, enough spiciness to give a little boost. Clean and simple taste. Smooth, slightly creamy mouthfeel. Good all around example."
"This isn't too bad, but it's a bit too bland. The flavor is quite good and it's very clean, so if it had just a bit more to it I think it'd be a very good wit. Not too bad, and pretty drinkable, but left me wanting something a bit more."
"Poured from a brown 11.2oz. bottle. Has a cloudy brown color with a 1/2 inch head and lots of floating yeast. Smell is a bit sweet with some spices. Taste is of citrus and spice, pretty good. Feels creamy in the mouth and goes down easily. Overall this is a quality beer."
"Not the best from Bavik, hate it or love it, but it's a really cheap Wit."
"From the 11.2 fl. oz. bottle no. 39701. Sampled on September 26, 2009. It pours straw yellow-white with a thick, puffy white head and extremely cloudy. The aroma has a rich sweetness about it as well as the wheat that I have come to expect from a Belgian Wheat. What I did not expect was how sweet the taste would be. It was almost like drinking sugar. That was a bit off-putting. A background of hops in there too. Something to drink with chips I suppose."
"The mouthfeel is delightfully crisp and light but not watery at all. As such, this beer is extremely drinkable and utterly refreshing. I was in the mood for a wit and didn't feel like Hoegaarden, Blue Moon, or Shocktop and I didn't want to fork over the extra cash for Allagash or Bernardus. My hopes were a bit low for this one but I ended up being pleasantly surprised. One of the great warm-weather beers but enjoyable year round."
"D: It's certainly unique. I'd never make it my go-to wit, but it is good and refreshing."
"Very good beer."
"Overall, similar but slightly more flavorful and refreshing than macro interpretations of the style. For instance, this compares well to Blue Moon - and makes a great picnic beer if you pick up the canned version."
"Notes: Nice to find in a can."
"This one is worth finding. I had it at the Cafe Intermezzo in Dunwoody, GA."
"Drinkability: Yes, it is"
"Overall, this brew is drinkable but not one I will try again."
"Overall- Both the bottle and can were good examples of the style. The can seemed a little lighter than the bottle. I can see taking cans to the beach/golf course/tailgate when bottles aren't allowed."
"Not a bad beer, but a pretty poor witbier overall. Wouldn't recommend it when there are much better options."
"D= Not a perfect witbier, but a pretty good one all things considered. I really liked the yeasty character and only wish the carbonation level was more to my liking for this style. All in all a very sessionable beer though."
"Drinkability - A very Balanced beer was in my glass, and is now in my tummy. It was refreshing, bold for it's style, and full of wonderful flavor. Although it was a tiny bit watery, it was complex and refreshing enough to keep my full attention. great brew. i'll have another..."
"D) True to form. Refreshing. Has a decent body feel, leaving one as though they did drink a beer and not some light colored concoction. I'd have another."
"Drinkability is fairly high because it isn't hard to choke down. That's as far as I'll recommend it though, because there are far better for style."
"Drinkability: A real snoozer. So filtered and meek, it's downright wimpy. I'm all for light and refreshing, but, come on, let's have some (any) flavor too!"
"Overall, a decent beer."
"Smell is of light crisp malt, bread, yeasty, banana, and mysterious hops. it's a little thin smelling and just feels like something is missing. Taste is light and thin although there is a crisp breadiness. mouthfeel is light and drinkability is alright."
"Drinkability: This beer goes down extremely effortlessly because of its lack of body, flavor and any other harsh impediment. I wouldn't revisit."
"D: Epitome of drinkability. Light and decently flavorful, but good."
"Pours a very pale straw color with that whitish tinge that wit biers have. Small but tight pure white head that dissipated into a ring, some minimal lacing. The aroma is grainy with lemon and hints of coriander. Grainy on the taste with a wheat malt crisp edge, some lemon and coriander. Pretty bland for a wit. The feel is light with fizzy carbonation; finishes with a grainy sweetness. Drinks real easy, good for drinking in the sun. The bier is just about average in all aspects. No real bold wit flavors, they seem to sit in the background. The grainy flavor seems to be forefront, while making the beer easy to drink, it seems to stray from the style. Perhaps a can is not the best vessel for this beer."
"I'd never heard of this brew before ordering it, and by the flavor could've sworn it was an American Pale Wheat Ale. In such a case, it would've been one of the best APWA's I've tasted. Nonetheless, it's a good option for thirst-quencher on a hot day, and complexity is enough to not be too boring (compliment? you decide)."
"D: Satisfying and easy drinking. I do want another despite not being blown away or impressed even. I'm not planning on buying another sixer again readily in the near future."
"Not bad. A standard witbier that feels solid, but a bit bland. Otherwise, you could enjoy this on a hot day."
"Drinkability: Mouthfeel is like a regular wit..refreshing. But the taste is bland...so I can't highly recommend this one. Its not bad, but its unmemorable"
"Taste & mouthfeel: Tastes like a lemon butter cookie. With white pepper on it. Even for the style this is rather bland, oddly buttery, and lacking the dry, crisp finish I look for in a good wit. Not awful by any means; this would be a solid picnic beer, it's just decidedly average."
"Pours a opaque light yellow with almost no head. There is no lacing on this glass from the small head. It has a lemon-orange smell with some spices. There is also a hint of sour apple in the smell. It tastes a bit like apple juice with some hints of citrus in the background--it's very sweet. It is very drinkable for the style, but it is thin and a light carbonation."
"Sorry, not impressed with this beer at all."
"D - not bad to drink but pretty much a one dimensional beer."
"This isn't one of the witbiers I'd run to, but it wouldn't be hard to drink."
"M-D- Fresh on the palete with nothing offensive at all. Mild wheats and malts have a mild astringent feel on the mouth. Highly drinkable Belgian wheat beer. Not my first or last."
"D: Drinkability is good, but I wasn't really wanting another by the time I was done."
"D: very drinkable and refreshing. A great lawnmower summer beer."
"The taste is dryish witbier again with a good pale lager element, grain but fruity with grass, hints of lemon juice and grapefruit (dry, light, freshly squeezed grapefruit juice, not the usual grapefruit I note in many US micros), and pear juice without the sweetness. It has a lightly bitter-tart finish and is rather dy. It's a bit thin but tasty."
"A chunky pour gives us a large pure whit head which quickly reduces to a moderate covering with little lacing to speak of. Color is a cloudy pale yellow. Aroma is filled with light fruits, coriander and sweet bread. Taste involves more coriander (though a bit more subtle than the smell) yeast, more light fruits (oranges, grapefruit) and a hint of sour grapes in the back. Very highly drinkable despite it's medium body and relative thickness."
"Pours a slightly hazy very pale straw color with a bit over a finger of moussy head that exhibits decent retention. Aroma is pleasant although a touch subdued. There is a fair amount of complexity here but it is in no way overwhelming. There is some spicy wheat, coriander, some light pepper, and a moderate zesty, orange fruitiness. Taste is pretty good. A grainy, at times spicy, wheat flavor is present throughout. The zesty orange citrus flavor is a bit more dominant here that in the aroma. The coriander is fairly subdued. Hop bitterness is very low. The finish is fairly dry and a bit tart. Mouthfeel is ok, medium-light in body with moderate-high carbonation, slightly creamy. Drinkaiblity is pretty good. I enjoyed this brew but I don't find myself immediately reaching for another."
"It's a fine beer to drink out of a can on a hot day or after a great day of skiing or riding."
"Overall this is a decent wit. Stil would rather pick up a hoegaarden over this, but the price is a cheaper, so it may when out when im in the mood."
"D: Good session beer, wont wow you, but conveniently packaged in cans for easy transport. Ok quencher on a hot summer day and light conversation."
"M: very clean and smooth. Light carbonation."
"Ah, the anticipation. This fine Belgian (hard to go wrong with Belgian beers, though) pours white and very murky/cloudy, with a thick head and sweet nose. The taste is sweet and steady, with light citrus and floral notes. Quite pleasant and very much what you'd expect from a Belgian witte (wheat) beer. And it's far better than Blue Moon."
"Wittekerke is nice, nothing over the top, just a simple citrusy brew. I envision this as a sunny afternoon porch sipping beer or even -dare I say it- a brunch beer. If you are a wit fan, give it a try. If you've had Bruexelles Blanche, Wittekerke is very similar and a bit of a bargain with a 6-pack of Wittekerke cans running about the same as a 4-pack of Bruexelles bottles."
"D - This beer is supremely drinkable and absolutely refreshing. Sure, it's not going to win any extreme beer contests or even the coveted ""Best Witbier in the World according to BA"" spot, but given the two different goals that can amicably exist within this style -- easy refreshment and complex spiciness (e.g. Allagash White) -- this one excels at the former."
"D= tastes not too unique but its definitally refreshing enough to drink a lot in the summer. I actually enjoy this beer quite a bit despite the lack of taste."
"I got a finger of soapy, bone-white head with low retention off of my pour. The color was a hazy lemon-yellow, like fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice. The nose was both musty and fruity, like bubble gum. The mouthfeel was medium with a candy-like fruitiness on the tongue. The finish was slightly dry and highly refreshing. This would be great on a hot summer afternoon."
"Poured into my SA Summer Ale glass. Pours a nice white head that recedes into a alright lacing. The color is light yellow with a cloudy haze. The smell is of light somwhat fruity. Taste is has a bit of malty sweetness. Then finishes a bit too sharp and dry. But not too bad. Mouthfeel is pretty good fairly light with decent carbination. Overall not a bad beer, good to have one of these just relaxing in the afternoon or to take to the beach because of getting it in a can."
"Creamy mouthfeel, sits well on the palate. Very drinkable, the aluminum taste goes away after awhile. A sixer in the summer can't be bad, though there are much better witbiers out the like Alagash."
"Bottle. Pours a pale blonde, small white head. Not a well done Wit in my opinion, aroma and taste were dominated by a vegetable smell/taste and yeast, sorta like celery or the like. Not to my liking when drinking a Wit. Won't be trying this one again."
"Drinkability: This is a very easy drinking beer. I could easily have killed the six pack watching a football game. Very light, reminds me of a nice summer afternoon."
"Brightly glowing yellow color in spite of the thick cloudiness, good froth on the pour which sticks around, hard to see the bubbles. Light and crisp nose of lemon, oats, barley and bitters, just smells like it's very dry. Full-bodied even as the flavors and general mouth feel are at first more linear and crisp. Lemon again most present, lots of carbonation in the mouth breaks up a good deal of the denser malt, barley and oat flavors. Starts off dry and gets sweeter as you swallow. Some mixed Asian spices. Lots of aftertaste, this helped by the big body. Slightly tiring, not sure I could pound a six-pack."
"I'll pass."
"Bottle poured into a pint glass. Looks lighter than your average wit beer, but plenty cloudy. I am trying hard but don't get anything specific from the nose aside from a funky twang. Oh wow. Twang present in the taste - almost lagerish if you ask me. Not a wit that I will likely try again..."
"The taste is quite subdued and watery, a bit sharp in places. There is an undefined spiciness in the beer, which is slight and hard to pin down. It might be some watered down vague coriander. There is also a lemony zest to the beer, maybe a touch of orange as well. The beer is quite yeasty, with average carbonation. There is a cardboard flatness quality in the taste. This is a decent, but by no means stellar, witbier and maybe a tad disappointing given its origin. The consistency is light to medium bodied, a bit more substantial than other witbiers, but the taste is just too lacking in character to rate this beer much above average. Refreshing yes, tasty and interesting ... well, not really."
"While a bitout of season, I became the happy recipient of a 6-pack of Wittekerke, Belgian wheat. With proper Witte-pint at hand, the bottle poured a nice yeast-cloudy pale yellow, leaving a full fluffy white head that thinned a bit as some clarity moved from bottom up. The head maintained a nice lacey retention & the overall appearance lept its cloudy color. The aroma offered up a floral lemon zest with a hint of spice. The flavor was an upliftingly sweet, but not too syrupy, lemon wheat-malt with a bit of hops in a bubbly carbonation that stuck around. As with all wheats, no additional lemon wedge need apply (you don't add a potato wedge to a stout, do you?). This was a highly drinkable, great summertime refreshing replacement to the Blue Moons out there. Not my favorite Witte, but definitely delicious!"
"Poured this milky yellowish white beer into a pint glass. It gave a good amount of head which reduces down to a decent amount of lacing. The smell of citrus and a malty wit beer greet the nose. However the taste is lemon with a bit of malts. Overall a good beer to have with friends while chilling out after a warm day."
"verdict: for the price and cleanliness, i'll be buying this again. better and cheaper than blue moon, that's for sure."
"A Belgian Wit out of a can? Nice... Pours a hazy pineapple color with a big fluffy white head, average lacing. Nice spicy, coriander aroma, wheat twang, somewhat sweet. Flavor has some nice citrus flavor, a bit of orange, nice malted and unmalted wheat flavor, spicy coriander again, light sweetness. Creamy on the tongue, carbonation on the lighter side. Light to medium bodied. Is this beer really this good? It's half the price of Hoegaarden but twice as tasty. A very solid, low ABV wit, that's the very definition of sessionable. Good stuff."
"It has a pale blonde cloudy and hazy body. It had a huge amount of head that would later form a very tight lace. It has a sweet, beany wheat aroma. It has very sweet and slight citric bitterness. There are little The mouthfeel is creamy is a very smooth beer. There is no really a whole lot of flavor but that is what makes this beer so good. What flavor it does have makes it very neutral and refreshing beer."
"Pretty smoothe feeling beer that doesn't dry the palate out but still calls you on to drink more."
"better than alot of other belgian whites,just not as good as St Bernardous"
"Very interesting witbier from a can. This is a borderline good beer only because of portability and that it's interesting as an imported canned wit. I'd like to try it on draft somewhere and see if I get a different nose and flavor out of it. Could have been the can."
"The color was the same, hazy light lemon yellow, with no foam or lace to speak of. The smell of sour lemon was very evident as was the taste. Sour lemon was very pleasant to the palate. If you like sour lemons you'll like this beer. Not, me. I scored it higher than I should of compare to the can version. Not a beer I will buy again!"
"Decent and standard. Good summer brew."
"a one dimensional beer but I dig the can. better wit's for sure but nothing worth avoiding in this one."
"Again, I think something may have happened to this bottle or batch, I've had it before and it's better than this."
"it looks like a nice opaque pear juice with a nice frothy white head. got some lil white floaties in my glass too. decent lacing. the nose is coriander, sweet orange zest, very floral. the taste is the same as the nose but with some mellow lemons in the mix. its a very mellow brew. i dig it. medium body, low carbo. very enjoyable"
"Overall, a solid wit, a little too sweet. It's a nice change of pace for canned beer."
"D- This is an ideal session beer and one that I truly enjoy having on a regular basis during the warmer weather of the spring and summer."
"This is one of my personal favorites, a great brew and a prime example of the Belgian White Style beer. It is very light for the style and is not heavily or overly carbonated, which both help in making it such an easily drinkable beer. Its not overly spiced like some of the other whites out there. Give this brew a shot if you ever come across it, you won't be disappointed."
"best in bottle... most leaved out."
"It goes down smooth and is very refreshing."
"D - In spades. One can swirl this down all damn day."
"D - Drinkability, as you might imagine, is high. This is a staple at the Abbey on tap, but I'd never had it out of a can or bottle before."
"D: As stated above this has a great fruity and well spiced flavor with an amount of carbonation that's low-medium but is perfect for the style. This could be a session Wit."
"It just makes me think that this is a witbier that jocks and meatheads could love."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Light on the palate, and easy to drink. Carbonation is low so not as to overwhelm the delicate flavor of this beer. Semi-dry in the finish with hop flavor quite prevalent. This is one that is very easy to drink, very refreshing on a hot day. In my opinion, this is better than both Hoegaarden, and Blue moon. In fact, it is better than many of the others of the same style I've drank."
"Shipped back from my trip to Indiana. Poured from a 330ml bottle with no dating info into a weizen glass. It was a hazy straw color with tons of carbonation. It had a huge white head that stuck around for a long time. Some lacing. The aroma was pretty good. It had the usual wit players plus a musty smell to it. Saw some describe as barnyard - I can see that. The taste was pretty good as well but lacked a bite to it. Also didn't finish as dry as most wits. I had this in Vegas a couple years ago and remember it smelling and tasting better so concerned about how it fared in the hot truck during shipment. Will need to re-review later."
"Am wishing now I bought more than 1 because Lethbridge is almost 2 hrs away. Must get favored beer vendor to get some of these in."
"Notes: A different type of of beer for it's style. I liked it and all,but I don't think I will go crazy if I don't see it again. Overall a fine brew with good balance."
"Very good beer, I truly enjoyed it and will be definately getting more!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The soft, silky texture in the mouth seems impossible to improve upon. It's liquid velvet, and the body is so easy and creamy. At only 5% and so balanced in terms of flavors and spices, this rivals Allagash White as my go-to beers for this style. This is more reserved and more sessionable then our friend from Maine's IMO... don't miss the opportunity to try this."
"D- solid session beer. not the greatest wheat beer, but a drinker i could do over and over"
"Hazy golden, copious white moussey head. Coriander/citrus plus mystery spice (fennel?) in the (slightly soapy?) aroma, a tad vegetal. Plenty of wheat twang with background pils sweetness. Fruity/citrus, floral, very mild phenolics, and a hit of aluminum from the can I poured it out of. Were it fresher, spicier, and packaged better, it could be a solid solid wit."
"This review was done without adding a lemon slice to the beer, while not necessarily traditional, it does help some of the flavors quite well. I would recommend adding an unsqueezed piece of lemon to this beer. Also, as my wife stated in her review below, store this upside down or give a VERY gentle shake before pouring to allow the yeast to rejoine the rest of the beer."
"Drinkability: Largely refreshing, but very mild and meek - seems like it could use a little more character. Dunno if the can had anything to do with this. Not an outstanding wit, but not a bad beer."
"An enjoyable witbier, mellow and polite, but also a fantastic host to the palate. A perfect hot weather refresher as well."
"D: very drinkable. very refreshing and one of the few quality beers we can get here in ATL in a can."
"they can't all blow you away."
"Recommended by my man George at Stadium Liquor. I am a fan a Hoegaarden, whatever, it's a good beer. Witbiers are a genre that that has few winners and far more losers. Wittekerke does look pretty damn good with it's murky lemon/lime appearance. The beer posses a minimal head that disapates within a few minutes. The lace is bubbly and beautiful. I really did enjoy this beer. It has a perky lemon smell, I swear I can smell a bit of cotton candy. It has a mild bite, subdued lemon taste complemented with flavors of wheat, grapefruit and manderin orange. The mouthfeel is so subdued, calm, inviting, crisp and refreshing. Aftertaste is clean and fresh. The aftertase flows through the nasal cavity and stimulates your face, skin and eyes to make your nerves feel somewhat alive. This Belgian Wit was a treat, the ABV is very tolerable. I can take my time with this 6 pack and enjoy every moment."
"Body is about medium and pretty active with a fairly quick snap to its carbonation that rests alot of flavors once it subsides and warms. Crisp, tangy, sweet, and quenchable easy to down a whole bunch of. A summer favorite of mine to keep around and pretty cheaply priced as well. However, it still seems better on-tap by a bit more lemony length I think."
"D: Pretty good. Not very alcoholic and some very faint flavors make it pretty drinkable as nothing is overwhelming."
"Poured a nice light orange with some cloudiness and a one-finger head that stuck around for a little and left some decent lacings. Citric notes real noticeable in the smell, especially lemon and some orange peel, combined with some spices and faint clove. A little sharp but the citric notes and spices blend together for a good taste with a medium body that flows smoothly over the tongue and with a little sweetness from some malts and the wheat. Has a semi-sweet finish that mixes dark fruit with some yeast. Since this was in a can and cheap I will definitely have it again."
"The beer was poured into a shaker pint glass, where it shines white-straw color with a cloudy body and a whipped head on top that retains very well. The aroma is mild fruit and a bit of rought grain. The taste is mostly a blend of sweet lemon and orange. There's some malted wheat and medicinal notes to be found in the brew, not much in the way of spices. A good beer for a warm summer day, especially while barbecuing."
"Drinkability: very refreshing. for fans of the Wit stlye, this is a must try."
"Served in my Warsteiner pilsener glass. Poured a pale straw gold. Poor clarity, but not opaque. Lots of effervescence and a few floaties in solution. Dense, fluffy two-inch bright white head with some large craters across the cap. Residual lattice of sticky clumps of lacing adhered during the tasting. Clean scent; wheat, citrus and yeast. Taste consistent with nose. Not much complexity and somewhat lacking in terms of the characteristic spicy character of a wit, but so refreshing and smooth. Mouthfeel is lively and light, leaving a pleasant residual tingle across the tongue. Extremely drinkable; went down easy and definitely makes a great lawnmower beer."
"Good drinkability, it's never hard for me to drink witbiers."
"D - quite drinkable but no more than any other hefeweizen."
"Taste is of light lemony wheat and is slightly yeasty without any sour notes. Well balanced carbonation yields a smooth drinking brew. A touch thin in the spice department perhaps, yet nothing over the top yields a reasonable balance."
"KB"
"Overall: Not my favorite witbier, but it will definitely suit the bill if you're looking for a wit to drink and it happens to be what they have. All in all, somewhat plain. Interesting that the ""kerke"" in question on their label/tap handle is a plain white clapboard frame thing, because that's the overall effect of the beverage: plain, unassuming, mainline-protestant-style witbier. No stone towers or fancy stained glass with this one."
"D - Yo no tengo, one was more than enough for me, I see people drinking this at bars all the time, but I can't really see why."
"Pours a pale yellow, with little to no head and rather still carbonation. On the nose, some rough, almost skunky hop notes (or a spice that smells like it -- this is from a can, after all) along with herbaceous and peppery elements. On the palate, quite bitter first off, then acidic, before a mellow biscuity malt quality comes through. The only thing that really does not work is the finish, which contains some unpleasant, vinyl-and-mint flavors. Overall, this isn't a bad witbier, and it's entirely likely that someone without the same sensitivity to whatever is coming out in the finish would enjoy it significantly more than I did. Even still, I thought it was decent."
"I do believe I have had my first skunk beer. Yikes! If you are reading this review, don't base your opinion by it! Got this beer from Total Wine and More in Fort Myers. Poured a decent straw color with some haziness and a small white head. Smell was of sweet citrus notes and some floral to it. The first sip made my lips pucker. It was so acrid I could hardly swallow it. The next sip was just and bad that even gave my throat a burning sensation. I belive this one may have turned to the darkside. I will have to try another fresh one sometime."
"D. A fairly drinkable and enjoyable brew."
"D.Easy to drink and very refreshing.Very good lawnmower beer or bbq beer."
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow color, nice carbonation, nice huge two-finger plus creamy white head, lots of nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty/yeasty, nice touch of spice, with some slight caramel tone. The taste is malty/yeasty, nice spice touch, and some caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a tasty brew."
"Authentic Summertime Bier..."
"D- The spice was a bit overwhelming to drink more than one, but overall a very tasty treat."
"For such a creamy feel, it was actually fairly light and crisp as well. I haven't had many witbiers, but this is one of the best I've tried."
"D: Decent quaffer, a good summer time drink, and reasonable for the style. I tend to find myself moving away from the wit styles, but this is something I might consider trying again."
"This is a highly drinkable brew, inoffensive and quenching yet just tasty enough to not feel watery."
"D. Very high, and gets moreso the hotter the day. Wittekerke isn't a great beer, but it sure is hitting the spot right now."
"Pours a very cloudy, murky, very pale yellow color with plentiful large bubbled white head. On the nose, it has a very pungent orange and clove dominated aroma. A little bit of pepper is there, but overall, a very tart and citrusy aroma. Flavor starts out complex but finishes quickly. The orange and citrus come through along with a tart cider like flavor finishing quite dry. It's not as thoroughly complex as Ommegang or Blanche de Chambly, but enjoyable nonetheless. Carbonation is high but with smaller bubbles as to bring a smoothness rather than a stinging touch."
"Very nice Wit."
"What can I say really, Belgian White is one of the most drinkable beers in my opinion. I've had many BW's, they're all distinct and I haven't met one that I don't like. This one is more distinct, mostly in flavor, it's more citrusy than others I've had (Avery White Rascal, Blue Moon, Hoegaarten, etc). I enjoy it very much but availability is extremely limited. One bonus is that, in my area, this comes in cans (and steel cans at that) so I can take it to the park whereas most BW's are bottled and glass is banned in parks."
"This is a thirst-quenching, tasty, and exceptionally smooth example of the style."
"D: Very refreshing but too bland to be particularily interesting. Definetely beats your run-of-the-mill-beer."
"Very fine beer, and goes with a lot of food. It's an easy partner for any meal. Don't miss."
"D: This beer is very easy to drink - it has some good flavours, but they are not as pronounced as I hoped them to be. Not bad, but there certainly are some better wits out there. I would buy this one again, but probably only for a good summer session."
"Poured a 12oz can into a Boulevard Pint glass. Poured a hazy straw yellow with a bright white head that left mild lacing down the side of the glass. Aroma is yeasty with a slight citrus smell. Taste is mild banana, lemony citrus and bread. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with slight carbonation. ItÂ’s a pretty drinkable beer."
"Drinkablity: Simple and very easy to drink. It was not as complex as expected, but it was still enjoyable."
"Really crisp, refreshing beer. The beer snob in me was pleasantly surprised. I didn't expect such a tasty beer from a can. Nice choice for a lighter beer, especially since I don't usually care for light beer. I buy this one often, especially for social gatherings where I don't want to drink anything too heavy."
"This was my first Belgian from a can and I found this Wit to be very refreshing, easy to drink, and enjoyable."
"Keep in mind, I am not incredibly familiar with belgian whites. It is my least favorite style of the country and I dont buy it often. Pours a hazy peach white. with normal head. smell is strong, but seems like it should be skunkier. smells like lemony citrus and some hops. Taste has some lemony notes with slight hop flavors. the taste virtually dies as the beer is swallowed. But there is an aftertaste that lingers for a bit but is not very strong. The last part of the taste is almost a musk. The mouthfeel is good but very thin, and the carbonation tingles a bit. Drinkability is very good, keeping in mind its only 5%. To be honest this beer just makes me want to go grab the strongest quadrupel in my cellar, but i am more disciplined than that thank God! Better than I expected for a beer in a can though, i will say that."
"Taste is orange rind, some spices, wheat, yeast, and a barely detectable malt backbone. Quaffable, good, but not a powerful tasting, nor smelling, beer."
"D- This beer has a crazy color with an interesting flavor,especially for a wit. I thought it was very novel but no worth another glass."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, not filling at all, very good representation of style, this is a good lighter Belgian beer that you could drink for a very long time. I could see myself drinking several of these."
"This was my first time having this beer, I happen to like this white beer much better than Hoegaarden, overall this beer did not have the spice that hoegaarden, but it did have a citrus aroma to it. This happened to be the second beer I have tried from Bavik and am quite impressed with what I have had so far."
"Overall, not a bad beer, but this certainly wouldn't be my first pick if I had a choice... There are definitely better witbier's out there... The appearance is a cloudy, yellowish-mist... The flavor, which was good, was citrusy/lemony,and pepperish and definitely worth trying if you're a fan of this type of beer... I wouldn't mind downing a sixer of this one... Although somewhat bland compared to other witbier samples, this was nonetheless a solid and respectable brew. Not particularly over-the-top or exciting, but drinking one would definitely lead to another so I would buy it again... Without a doubt worth trying at least once if you're a fan of witbiers, but all in all, there are better samples out there... I was satisfied, but not totally blown away... A predominately citrus taste characterizes this beer, which though not bad, is not absolutely terrific-get me another now... All said, certainly worth a try though..."
"So I actually got to try this at Whole Foods of all places and had a can of this with a slice pof pizza outside tonight, now I know that wasnt exactly supposed to go on that way, but it did and it was cool. So anyway it poured a bright hazy yellow with a nice two inch or so white head on top. Nice retention gave way to a good amount of lace. Lots of visible carbonation was apparent. Smell was full of wheat and yeast, very light with little in the way of any floral quality to it. The taste was decent enough, light grain mixed in with a touch of yeast, a little bit of a banana or some kind of kick in the in, with a smooth, and well carbonated light body to it. Overall not too bad, I have had better and I have had worse. It was average at best but no worse then that,. I could have had another easily as they were like water. An average witbier for me"
"This beer just doesn't have any richness to it. Not bad, but very average."
"I really enjoyed drinking this. For the price, it's definitely worth the investment. I can't complain a bit about this, though the style isn't my favorite."
"Overall a pretty good beer, thats easy drinking though not very interesting."
"Body was a paradox Â– that big head was followed by a smooth brew without much carbonation. Pretty nice brew, but IÂ’m wondering if I could make my way thru a sixer of them."
"Drinkability- I'm not real big on Belgian wits, but this stuff is pretty good."
"Appearance is light yellow color with a touch of head on top that dissolves down to a thin film. Nose is crazy citrus, lemon, and some pencil shavings (?). Flavor is smooth, clean citrus, light wheat. Body is medium with solid carbonation. This one's not bad, a very smooth drink, although not crazy complex."
"Can courtesy of Okbeer: Poured a golden yellow color ale with some small white hue and a medium size pure white foamy head with good retention. Aroma of wheat and some light coriander. Taste is also dominated by some light wheat with some commendable spice mix in which coriander dominates. Body is a bit light with too much filtration with some adequate carbonation."
" On underside of the Can the Best Before Date is 01-12-2008 this kind of packaging has its benifits. One to look for in Belgium railway stations or local beer/liquor shop in US."
"D- This a delicious, drinkable, and sessionable witbier. Low on alcohol and big on flavor. Probably best as a summer beer but can be enjoyed year-round."
"D - This was a pretty good beer. Not what you'd expect from Belgium."
"never saw this before and tried it at rocks bar in chicago. they served it in the wittekerke glass from the can. nice glass and a nice looking beer, it was a glowing cloudy straw with a great creamy head. sweet bready and lemony aromas. nice bit of sweetness and well balanced by a tart finish. chewy mouthfeel. very sessionable, this went down easy."
"Just before and through the finish, it becomes very bland and watery and and that ruins it for me. Too bad; Initially, I thought I'd really like this Wit."
"This beer poured a cloudy, creamy, milky white-yellow color (havenÂ’t seen this before). The smell is light and slightly floral. The taste is light and delicate Â– it has slight malt and hop flavors topped off with some floral notes. The mouthfeel is light and feels suited for this beer. Overall, this is a smooth and easy drinking beer."
"-Oelergud"
"D: I'd drink it all day long in the summer. Hell, I'd drink it all day long in the fall and spring too. A wonderful treat when all you want is a brisk, non-offensive beer."
"On tap in Tampa. Pours a thick white head, cloudy golden yellow. Was served with an orange slice, but I disposed of that. Smells of citrus. Tastes lightly of lemons and little of orange, but I missed the peppery sensation. Not a fan of the after taste. Better than Blue Moon, but I want to try more Belgian whites before I compare it further."
"This is a very easy drinking brew, but overall very a average wit. A worthy choice for a thirst quencher, but not so much if you are craving the taste of a classic wit."
"All in all, a very drinkable Belgian wit. This class has underwhelmed me, but I certainly enjoy this more than Hoegarten or Blue Moon."
"Drinkability:... If you can get by the taste... it's refreshing... thirst quenching... not my can o' beer though."
"Average Belgian wit, nothing to speak of other than a decently drinkable summer beer."
"Pours a nice hazy and cloudy yellow into a Witekereke glass(which looks like a small vase). Lots of thick head, that seemed like half of the beer. Kind of a standard Belgian wit, although a bit drier. A good summer beer, but nothing more than average."
"Pours a light golden color with a nice cloudiness and a pure white head. smells like corn more than anything, with some slight hops. Tastes average, me not being a huge hefe fan probably has something to do with its mediocrity. also has a little bit of bitterness to it, but nothing major. mouthfeel is great, and yummy. not bad, not great."
"D'ability - A clean but somewhat subdued interpretation of the style. Would be very easy to drink these one after another, but the same could be said for a light American lager."
"A nice Wit. Pours a hazy straw yellow with a nice size pillowy white head. Light lacing, average head retention. Aroma fairly good, cloves / banana primarily. Nice Wit taste, not as crisp as St Barnadus but not bad either. Fairly good astringency and citrus / cloves / banana taste. Mouthfeel is rich, a bit more sweetness in the finish than I would like, but overall a good beer. Drinkability is fine. At 5% with a very pleasant, refreshing taste, this would be a fine summertime session beer. I wish every place that serves up Widmer's Hefe could switch to something like this instead."
"Poured a light and hazy lemon yellow with a massive head of white pillowy foam. It had one of those head of foams that made me stop pouring half way because it would have overflowed the glass if I didn't. The head of foam had really good retention that left behind a white pillowy film, white foamy rings along the edge of the beer, and a few streaks of white sticky lace around the glass. The aroma started off heavy with dry pepper and with some juicy fruits and a slice of lemon behind it. After it really warms up, the dry pepper aroma dissipates and then is replaced by citrus fruits and a small drop of honey in the background. I'm not too sure what happened to the juicy fruits or the slice of lemon after the dry pepper dissipated. They must have left with the dry pepper. The taste was on the thin side with just a few small tastes of pepper, dry citrus fruits, a slice lemon, a few hops, and with a little dab of yeast to finish it off. There wasn't much going on in the taste. It was average at best. The mouthfeel was really light, not too watery, and with a minuscule aftertaste of grains, citrus fruits, and a little yeast. So this is where a few malted grains emerge. They weren't in the initial taste, so I guess the aftertaste called them up and told them to stop their hiding. I thought it was pretty much a slightly above average Belgian Witbier. I thought the can was a nice touch. This beer in a can would make a nice choice if you're going out on a hot summer day picnic."
"Pours a whitish golden color and has a decent thin head that only dissipates a little. The smell is sweet with some fruity aromas. The taste is quite smooth and moderately carbonated. It's bitterness is light but has a nice orange flavor to it. I'm not a big fan of wheat beer, but I particularly like this one. This beer is true to the witbier style and can't really improve much. The smell was a little mild, but other than that, I recommend this one."
" The only thing I'd change about this is the lacing, since it's average and not up to the level of this brew's other attributes. The aftertaste lightly lingers like that of a banana, and there's no bitterness or sharpness in the back here. Additionally, the 5.00% ABV can't be felt at all here, making this a great choice as I transition from winter's dark ale to the lighter fares of spring. Highly recommended!"
"Overall, not the tyical witbier and deserves it's place."
"This is a very good witbier. It's very straightforward. There's nothing fancy here, but it's very authentic. It doesn't pull any punches."
"I'm not sure if this keg was bad, as I see my experience was different then all the reviewers of the bottled version. The Sharp Edge didn't think so, although they agreed it sucked and gave me another beer on the house. If I ever get around to trying this out of a bottle or on draft somewhere else, I'll revisit my review, but for now I'm basing it on that very unpleasant experience."
"Drinkability - I learned I like Witbier beers. Nice clean taste, I could see myself drinking alot of these. This brand does come in cans, but I purchased it in a bottle."
"If you're looking for a one bottle masterpiece, then look elsewhere. If you're looking for a strong beer, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a quality beer for session drinking, then give this a try."
"Nothing spectacular here."
"wittekerke is a light bodied witbier that is distinctive but underwhelming. The taste is prodominately soap and lemon....it's hue is lighter and clearer than most in this style....the sourness of this brew makes it distinctive in this cluttered style. Must be ice cold as the sourness and soapiness only get worse as it warms. Less spiciness and floralness than you would hope for this style. Good on a cold day....but save the money and buy blue moon...which I dare say is better! Dissapointed and confused on how this is so close to the source of the style...maybe this is just the Bud light of witbiers...sorry! The fact that this beer still sells well(inside source) and is about 8$ a six REALLY makes the dissapearance of such a fine domestic version like CELIS WHT that much more painful!"
"Overall: A quality wit that deviates from the normal Hoegaarden or other more popular wits. Pick one up and enjoy ist's high drinkability and beer thirst-quenching ability."
"Barkeep, pour me a Hoegarrden please."
"One of my all time favourite session brews, and quite honestly, I am unsure why. I am simply inexplicably drawn to this beer. Even though I *know* Hoegaarden is a better representation of this style, I'll buy this almost everytime. Bizarre, eh? Anyway, This pours a cloudy, pale white/yellow with a beautiful snow-white head about an inch and a half thick. CO2 streams upward while moderate bits of debris float about. This looks like a really nice Belgian Wit. Smell is dry, cracked wheat and coriander. Plenty of coriander. The taste is fairly strong of coriander, as well, mostly on the finish, which is a bit bitter. Everything about this Wit seems to meld together nicely. Mouthfeel is very light, as is typicall for the style, and drinkability is very high IMO. As I stated earlier on, this is one of my favourite session brews, and I am particularly fond of this in the plastic wrapped 6pk can package."
"Drinkability: nice refreshing summertime brew. Light tasting beer would compliment many outdoor hot day activities."
"D - This is a very nice beer. A good refreshing summer beer. I like it."
"11.2oz can poured into a pint glass. Pours a hazy whiteish yellow color with a creamy white head that leaves lacing all over the glass. The aroma is loaded with a zesty citrus smell, freshly squeezed lemon juice and some spice. The taste is a little more subdued than I expected but is pleasant nonetheless. There is more fresh lemon in the taste along with some spice. Overall, this is a highly enjoyable wit that is especially enticing in those situations in which bottles are not an option. This would be perfect to take on a trip to the beach where cans are the only option. Highly drinkable and recommended!"
"Wittekerke pours a hazy yellow with a white head that fades quickly from a 33 cl can. Citrus/ lemon peel is the dominant aroma. Citrus flavors are nicely balanced with wheat in the taste. Coriander is not particularly strong in this wit, a quality that I like, not being a big fan of coriander. An enjoyable wit, worth a try."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a cloudy pale straw color with about an inch or so white head with good lacing. It smells like lemon, coriander and wheat/grain. It tastes like lemon, spiced hops, wheat, and coriander. It's light bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good. It goes down smooth, and it's nice and refreshing. This would probably be more of a summer beer for me, but overall I think it's a decent beer."
"Mouthfeel and drinkablility are very good, a bit creamy and goes down easy."
"A pale cloudy yellow beer with little head that disapates quickly. The aroma and taste are BLAND. A very little sweetness. No spices. The mouthfeel was light and carbonated. Not much to enjoy about this beer. Nothing bad but nothing good either. I would not recommend this beer except for a replacement to 7UP"
"Drinkability: I liked this beer a lot even if nobody else could appreciate the delicate flavors."
"I could drink a few of these, especially in the warmer months. This beer has convinced me that I need to try more Belgian wheats. This has surpased Hoegaarden as my favorite whit."
"Beer appearance is cloudy and moderately dark yellow. Carbonation was tight (small bubbles), and offered up some nice lacing. Odor was sort of spicy...and I think was picking up the coriander. Flavor was great! Spicy and light at the same time. I really enjoyed this beer, but would be reluctant to go to the canned stuff at the liquor store...just doesn't seem the same."
"Overall this is an OK beer and I'm glad to have purchased it."
"This beer pours with a hazy yellow color with a slight head. The smell is stronger than most whites, and it seems to be a terrific balance between the malts and spices. The taste is solid too, but as the bottle goes down it seems to become too monolithic and it loses the specialness to it. Its a good beer to get into belgian wittes, but nothing worth seeking out."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable Witbier , nice and refreshing. I prefer it over Hoegaarden , not much of any spice in this one."
"The smell is fairly good, with plenty of wheat malt and a minor amount of spice. The taste starts with wheat malts and gives way to yeast flavors. Some honey and citrus can be found in the end. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing while drinkability is good."
"D: It's no Hoegaarden, but not bad. Give it a shot."
"I know it's light and simple and even watery, but you know what, it's still pretty damn good. Very drinkable and light but with you huge flavors. It's sort of the best of a little beer."
"Pretty drinkable..would go very well with fish or pretty much any light meal."
"A good solid witbier in a convenient package 2 thumbs up"
"Solid thirst quenching summer beer. Probably a good one for anyone who claims to not like beer becuase of the bitter hops. I can't think of a good reason anyone other than a dedicated hop-head wouldn't drink this beer."
"Pretty good for a canned beer. Acceptable taste and palate for a Belgian Wit."
"This oneÂ’s really crisp and refreshing. Way better on tap than in the can."
"Surely drinkable."
"It's basically a lighter, smoother, softer version of a good Heffe. Lighter in color ( pale yellow) with the same cloudyness as a Heff. Aromas are softer and lighter. Nice sweetness from wheat malt, sweet citrus, honey, and sweet spices. Flavors are similar: a mild wheat and honey sweetness with corriander, curraco orange peel, and lightly peppery or cinemon-like. Good doses of citrus sweetness and smoothness: no bittering or tartness. Mouthfeel is light, creamy, powdery, silky, and smooth. Crisp finish with no drying. Low aftertaste. It's a lot like drinking a sweetheart. A very plesant beer for summer consumption or for the ladies."
"Would be a good substitute for orange juice in the morning, perhaps with French Toast that has been prepared with a little Grand Marnier. This beer would be perfect... ahem, bier!"
"All in all an acceptable bottle of beer...I just couldn't get past the bottom of the clothes hamper aroma."
"Nice light wheat body, crisp and watery with an ABV that would make this a hot weather, ""drink all day in the sun"" kind of beer. It's about the best Witbier I think I've tasted, cheers!"
"what a great beer, great on ahot day, goes down easy and not heavy."
"This was out of the bottle, but I was pleasantly surprised to see this on the cooler shelves in cans also. I'm heading back to pick some up for tailgating."
"Clean and refreshing, pretty cheap ($6.99 for a 6-pack of cans), light-bodied, and decent flavor with a moderate ABV. This beer goes down way too easy, especially on a hot day. I'd never take one of these over a Hoegaarden, but I'd definitely recommend it to anyone."
"Very enjoyable, refreshing but with great flavor. As far as canned beers this is up there with Dales Pale Ale in terms of quality. Frankly I wish more beers would come in cans."
" Taste is broad in texture and has a brief bitter splash before the refreshing finish. Smooth and easy to drink with a hoppy aftertaste. This is any easy beer to like and will be handy over the next few months"
"Drinkability: Compared to some other wits, this is a bit bland in both the aroma and the taste, although there is a nice coriander flavor; just lacks the banana and wheat flavors that are to be expected"
"This is not a bad lawnmower beer. A lot beter than the macros."
"Light straw. Odd nose. Grassy and herbal, hay and wheat. Somewhat fruity, but not coriander, more of a green melon and cooked onion. Taste is more of the same. Dry, vegetable-like, with turnups and cucumbers, along with green melon and lemon. Interesting but dull as hell."
"Overall, it was a fairly decent witbier, but nothing worth going out of the way for."
"What an absolutely refreshing treat. This well brewed beverage pours from the growler a cloudy light-gold color, with a descent but not huge foamy head. The smell is pleasant, with a nice spiced grassy aroma of herbs and fruit. The taste is wheaty and wonderful. This is brew of exceptional drinkability. I regret not buying more, after the very first taste. Definitely pickup growler of this witbier, or give it a try if you see it!"
"Pours out to a light hazed yellow color with a medium head of white foam, some notes of lace, and champagne like carbonation. Aromas of sweet malt and yeast, over fresh grain. Exceptional. Taste is light and refreshing; flavors of light malt, grain, mild hops, biscuits, yeast and corn go lightly on the palate. Mouthfeel was bubbly and refreshing. Quite nice. Good drinkability. This would make a superb summer quaffer. Recommended."
"A satisfying, refreshing, drinkable belgian that works very well as a palate cleanser. Hints of pear, peach, orange, tangerine, yeast and a little malt. I like the mouthfeel and this one goes down smooth. Not a bad wit at all."
"Generally refreshing, though not huge on flavor. It brings to mind a light wheat beer. An expensive lawnmower beer, or a notch above that."
"This is a nice affordable and refreshing wheat beer from Belgium of all places. It's 6.99 a six pack around here and only comes in cans. Nice alternative to take on a fishing trip or anywhere cans are preferred. Pours a nice hazy yellow color. Aroma is loaded with banana and spices. Flavor is a bit soda-popish as it is quite sweet, but balanced with a sour cherry finish. Nice banana and spice flavor. I certainly prefer this over most ""white"" beers including Blue Moon, etc. Hops are perceived first when it hits your tongue and then again in the finish -- however, this is a mildly hopped beer as you might expect. I recommend."
"Pours a faint yelllow with a nice head which quickly reduces to a fine foamy lace around the glass. Pale yellow with expended yeast floating around. Smells of bannana and corriander witha hint of cinnamon. First taste was smooth with some carbonation and slight bitterness. Not a very dry Wit and does not have the mouthfeel or taste of Hoegaarden or Weisenstephen, but would be an easy introduction to this awesome style."
"This witbier has a transluscent pale yellow straw color. The head is white and tite laced. The nose has hints of banana, corriander, and just a hint of clove. The mouth is hit first with the fruit and then a soft esthery spice wraped in a biscuit softly coated with honey that is carried over the tongue with a medium carbonation structure. There is a slight citrus linger. If you are not into the heavy cloved versions of witbiers this is a great place to start."
"I don't see why this has scored low with other BA'ers. It's a solid wit bier, drinkable and refreshing. An excellent example of one of my favorite styles."
"This is quite a refreshing brew. It probably will never challenge Hoegaarden for one of the top Belgian wits, but this is quite an exceptable brew and is worth a try if you enjoy the style or other wheat brews."
"Drinkability: An excellent session beer if you're unwilling to shell out the big bucks for a Hoegaarden or Blanche de Chambly."
"-UF"
"The body is very light and fluffy with a bit of a prickly sting on the tongue from the carbonation. Very refreshing, and very drinkable. Just don't give the beer a good long sniff before every drink like I've been accustomed to doing. Extra points for drinkability considering this is available in cans, for my fellow outdoor adventurist type BA's."
"Drinkability: I can drink a lot of these and love that it is a Belgian beer that comes in little cans. Very refreshing. This might be my new summer beer for out on the boat (or any other activity that calls for cans for that matter)!"
"Poured this beer from a 11.2 oz can into a mug. The color is a cloudy light tan color, look a little thin compared to what I have been exposed to from this style. It has very little head that is gone in a second. It has a very zesty citrus and light wheat scent. Nice zesty citrus and wheat flavors but a little thin in the mouthfeel. Not the best Belgium White that I've ever had but pretty good overall."
"Very straw like in colour with a definite haze. The nose is lemons and oranges with a little spice. The taste is quite light with citrus in the background and less spice than some wits. A little weak in body and flavour I find this beer to be strictly a summer patio quencher."
"All in all, a very drinkable beer. It's very evenly balanced and light enough to drink a few of."
"Very pale slightly foggy straw-yellow with a mist of sediment that very quickly and actively mixes evenly into the beer. A snow-white creamy cap of froth dissipates pretty evenly. Smells very lightly of wheat and toasty biscuit malt. Light, slightly spiced and slightly sweet wheat malts, fairly typical and predictable, with hints of lemon and biscuity malt. Typically light body for a typical Belgian wheat ale. Totally typical and average, this beer pulls a straight 3."
"One of the most drinakble Belgian wits IÂ’ve come across. It has a great mouthfeel and strikes a perfect balance between complex yet subtle flavors. A great session beer or revitalizing tonic."
"Good carbonisation makes moutfeel together with good taste als OK. And yes this is well drinkable on a warm day or even in fall now."
"Drinkability: Aside from the aroma, I think this is a pretty solid choice. I'm sure there are others out there (and viewing the list there are many more Belgians I want to try, as I've had more American Wits than Belgians), but it's worth a shot for sure, especially for summer and this Virginia heat, which won't quit for some reason."
"Appropriately conditioned body. Drinkability OK, but why?"
"This brew pours a light hazy yellow. A thin but persistent white head stays on top of this beer through 95% of the ride down the glass. Aroma is of lemon and a mild hint of spice/grass feel and must from the yeast. Flavor is a tart lemon zing with a crisp bitter finish. A light smooth mouthfeel and extremely easy to drink and enjoy. There has been a few post of the perfect lawnmower beerÂ….this is it. A must try brew."
"I wasn't as impressed the second time around. Still a fine daytime brew but I'd like it to clean up a bit better. Very citrusy lemon towards the finish and a light hoppy presence."
"Cheers."
"Reminds me some of Blue Moon but probably a little better...kind of a basic workman like White Beer....I'm sure there are many others out there better but this is easy drinking and very enjoyable..great for the golf course or the boat."
"Pale yellow/white appearance. More white than yellow though. Nice looking cotton white head with good cling ability and retention. Fresh smell of ocean breeze, sweet doughy yeast and lemon zest. Nice bit of carbonation. Body is pushing medium. Taste is decent. Some orange and spicey corriander tones that I usually find in quality wits, but not quite as pronounced. Tangy wheat mingles as well. Very solid can offering."
"11.2 ounce blue can, with some sort of dating/info on the bottom. Pours the expected, cloudy light yellow shade. Soft white head, with good retention. leaves scattered, sticky lacing. Nose is oddly metalic, with some spice and fruit. Medium bodied, notes of cloves, flowers. Fair wit, not the best, but worth a try. Refreshing stuff. Fine for a summer picnic. One of the more interesting canned beers out there."
"A hazey straw yellow colored beer. Has a big fluffy white head and great lace. The aroma is light with hints of yeast and a lemony tartness. The flavor has a light herbal character with a nice lemony note and a little corriander and spice in the background. Definitely a good hot weather drink. Quite refreshing."
"Pours a very cloudy, pale yellow (almost white) color with a whispy white head. Smell is a typical wit, soft grain with hints of spices, corriander, lemon rind. Taste is soft graininess, with a fruity and spicy background with hints of corriander, lemon and orange. Mouthfeel is light, crisp and refreshing with high carbonation, just what you want from a wit. Drinkability is high since this is after all, a wit. A pretty good belgian wit, if nothing special it's refreshing and drinkable."
"No complexity, but drinkable and refreshing. Would make a good lawnmower beer, if I wanted to pay $10.49 a six-pack for that kind of brew. But since I can find comparable domestic beers for probably four bucks less, I'm not likely to pick this up again."
"Either the US crafters are really good at witbiers (Holy Moses comes to mind) or the true European versions are far more understated than their American counterparts, but this was disappointing, to say the least. It was very, very mild, almost weak. I'll look elsewhere for European witbiers."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer. Very unique in just about every aspect, New to witbier would like to try more."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin, but refreshing. Drinkability would be high on a warm day. Pretty good, but not one to overwhelm."
"Medium boddied, pleasant sudsy mouthfeel. Refreshing and drinkable. Not remarkable, but solid."
"Nice fluffy white head atop a cloudy pale yellow beer. The aroma is a nice blend of hops and Belgian spiciness along with a funky banana-and-orange blend. The flavor is maybe not as tart as I'd expect, but it IS nice and flavorful, with a slightly malty flavor and a slight hop bitterness at the end. Some fruitiness is apparent as well. The mouthfeel is good too, with a fluffiness like the head. Overall this is a very drinkable beer but its a little more mundane than what I expect from a witbier - seems more like a German wheat beer than a Belgian witbeer. But that's a good beer too! Also, although I was skeptical of the cans, I think it improves the overall flavor and freshness (especially since there is no way light can spoil the beer in the can)"
"Not the best butt a nice thirst quencher!!"
"One other thingÂ…..I love to swirl this one on the tongue and in the mouth before the swallow especially during a long drinking Session in Belgium on the stronger Belgian offerings, it simply never fails to clear the passages and reinvigorate the palate and erase a flagging heavy or soggy feel after a plethora of hefty 8%+ brews. ItÂ’s a great mid-session Â“pick-me-upÂ” beer for whenever you feel a Sumerian Beer Trance on the horizon!"
"average witbier, and at $9 a 6 pack, qpr is very low."
"Vanilla milk shake. Creamy and ""I like Vanilla"" aroma on the wheat. Love the shake appearance. However, a barnyard onion like aroma and taste comes out in the actual drink, and subtracts from the rest of the surface. Was better warmer, and at end with sediment. Laces. Freshly in at Smokeless Joe's."
"Wittekerke Wit is damn fine beer. I had never heard of it before picking it off the shelf last month, but it's now one of my favorites of the style. Although I'm drinking this bottle in early January, it strikes me as the perfect summer brew. I'll be sure to load up when the warm weather arrives. Now if I could just remember where I bought it."
"Drinkability- Not a bad beer, but tastes more like a soda than a beer. Decent at best IMO. May try again down the line."
"(11.2 oz / .33L)"
"Overall: pretty refreshing and good for a lighter brew to end the day with. A decent, if not spectacular, example of a wit."
"A vigorous pour produces a huge bubbly head that quickly recedes into a clumpy fingerÂ’s width of snow white head. The body is the color of banana juice and lively with fat bubbles of carbonation. The aroma is thickly doughy with yeast, and pleasantly snappy with esters (banana, apple), a healthy dash of white pepper is present as well. The flavor is a lot more vibrantly fruity than some of the muted fruit flavors IÂ’ve tasted in other wits. Big zingy flavors of pineapple, apple, banana. A bit of rye bread peeps in along side a dense chewy dough. The finish has a tiny, tiny spicy hint. The fruit flavors are definitely the star here. Mouthfeel is slick and refreshing but has substance. The carbonation level is perfect, adds texture, but is not distracting. A very nice wit!"
"Pours a murky lemon color. Smells like lemon, pith especially. Taste is quite refreshing, but also different: Seriously, this is like drinking a lemon meringue pie. Nevertheless, it's quite refreshing, probably better for a warm summer day than a cold fall night. That, or dessert. ;-)"
"Appearance is lemonade yellow, hazy, and effervescent with a dense white head (decent retention). Lacing is tight and fine ? clinging to the glass. Aroma is sweet and citrusy (lemon peel), with a light grassy hop presence. Flavor is sweet and lively with a mild tart finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and effervescent with a tart finish. An interesting synthesis of sweet/tart/bitter flavors. Refreshing."
"hazy opaque yellow with a white fluffy head. mild aromas of corriander and lemon. definetly a thirst quencher. balanced light body an a decent mouthfeel good co2 and a thin watery aftertaste. a very drinkable and an excellent thirst quencher, on a hot day there good be nothing better."
"33 cl bottle. No freshness dating, but I know I got a fresh one. I'm a creature of habit, and I have a plethora of glasses, plus, I'm a stickler for appropriate glassware when consuming beer. So it was poured it in an authentic Wittekerke glass, which is frosted. So when I say it pours a clouded lemon yellow, the frosting of the glass may have impaired this. I'd assume it's clouded, having this beer a handful of times beforehand. It has a pretty nice creamy white cap on it. Citrus and spicy aromas with a bit of dusty yeast notes to it. Tastes pretty good, clean and lightly wheaty, with coriander in the background. My friend described a flavor of ""hot dog water"" in it, like the water left behind after boiling hot dogs. I'm mildly amused. I notice more of a grainy, clovey, citric aspect to the whole thing. But then, hearing somebody describe a beer absurdly sometimes tickles the funny bone. Very refreshing and thirst-quenching; well-carbonated. From what I understand, this beer used to be called Bavik White and was renamed after a popular sitcom in Belgium which translates into ""White Church"". Hence the white church on the top of the taphandle when I've seen this on draught. Anyhow, this beer is very drinkable, especially this fresh; and on a hot, humid night such as this."
"Wittekerke cans are available in the US, so I decided to buy a six pack to review. This is a pale straw coloured brew that is cloudy and has a nice off white head of foam, that lasts and actually leaves nice lacing as well. The aroma is very simple and consists of wheat, citrus fruits, and light spices. The taste follows suit, as this is a very uncomplex Belgian wit. The spices are subdued compared to other versions, and even the citrus flavors are not as pronounced. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth and the drinkability is good as well. Wow, this beer really reminds me of Belgium, where I often drink canned beers outside in wonderful surroundings. Although this beer is not as good as other beers that are available in cans in Belgium (Hoegaarden, Rodenbach, etc) This is one of the best canned (import) beers that I have had in the states, and at $7 a sixer, who can complain!?"
"Goes down smooth."
"Hazy, pale yellow-gold in hue, there isnÂ’t any animation that is noticeable, so it looks a bit dull. A white head topped off the beer; it was a little less than a finger in height at the apex on a normal pour. Head retention was poor as it quickly faded to a skimpy cap and then a foamy collar. There was no subsequent lacing. It looks like a Wit, just typical. The nose is musty, yeasty, wheaty, and vaguely fruity (mostly lemons). I only get a suggestion of spice; this aspect is too soft for a Wit, IMO. The potency is small. Yes, the nose is inviting but IÂ’m not really impressed. Really, what is this beer saying? Speak clearly please. Anyway. It is time to drink. The palate is the most favorable aspect of this beer. This is a very tasty Wit. I love the spiciness; it is perfect, not too strong but very wide and lingering. Once the lemon flavors and bright acidity kicks in, wow. There is a hint of orange zest too, plus suggestions of cloves, vanilla, musky wheat, soft bread, and earthy-sweetness. At the back are some vague fruitiness and more sweetness, sugary. Tasty. The aftertaste is musky, spicy, and wheaty. Refreshing. The mouthfeel is good; the carbonation is low and soft, medium in body. Silky smooth! This beer is amazingly drinkable but not straight out of the can. I experimented with drinking the beer without a glass. It was awful, very harsh and alcoholic. You see, always use a glass! Still, I wish the canned version were available locally as it would be a godsend during these hot Nebraska summers. I purchased a six-pack in Minneapolis, out of pure curiosity. It was a sound buy. It is very refreshing, low on complexities but tasty enough to care. Well worth trying and, yes, there are much better Wits on the market."
"Pours a hazy straw color and is topped by a thin pale head. My nose picks up a subtle spicy aroma with notes citrus, coriander, and grain. This beer is very light on the palate, lightly sweet, with a lemony spritzyness. This is simple and straight forward, a true Summer refresher. This is certainly one of the best can beers that I have ever had, though it is a distant 3rd to Old Chub, and Dale's Pale ale."
"Drinkability Â– This one was OK but I wouldnÂ’t buy again."
"Enjoyed on 5/15 at The Staghead, in Red Wing MN. Served in Wittekerke glass on a Wittekerke glass mat, nice touch! Color was a hazy yellow with bright white head. Very little aroma, a bit of citrus spice. Body was very thin but smooth. Taste was unimpressive, very little standout characteristics. I let it warm and it really didn't improve it any. Overall unimpressive, but not a bad beer. Will try again some time to re-evaluate, as the average to above average reviews here conflict with my thoughts."
"This beer pours a very golden-light color with a small but thick froth head. It smells of wheat, alcohol bitters and citrus flavors. The beer goes down nice and smooth when cold and tastes consistently wheaty and citrusy. This beer has uncanny smoothness and is highly recommended for a filtered wheat."
"This one comes equiped with a solid white head on it and a nice fresh aroma. A very cloudy brew with a watered-down juice look to it. This beer is very refreshing and doesn't have the strong wheat taste to it like some others. Citrus is definately present in this beer and it lasts from start to finish. A very nice wheat beer!"
"A drinkable brew, I Consider it the MRE of Belgian Beer."
"One sip and. . . oh god, awful. Like drinking a flour and water mixture. Nasty. This one gets dumped down the drain. glug glug glug."
"I respect this beer mostly for its authenticity. But my inclination is to demand more from it than it is apparently willing to deliver. A wedge of lemon might compliment the tartness, but I prefer a beer that doesnÂ’t lean on condiments to enhance its innate properties."
"This is a good Belgian Wit, but certainly not as good as Vuuve, Allagash, or Celis. Still, it's light and easy to drink, but even the mildly noticeable alcohol isn't akin to the style. It kept me wishing for more orange flavor and phenols."
"The beers as it dispenses from the 11.2 ounce brown bottle a bemused lemon yellow color with a modest in size and bright white head, the texture creamy, the lace a thin sheet to drape the glass. The nose has a hint of floral, crisp citrus like, IÂ’d say lemons, youÂ’d say limes, somewhat sweet, pleasant as they go, maybe a touch of coriander and yeast, start is lightly sweet, thinly malted, top is light in its fell to the palate. Finish is acerbic, modest hop presence, extremely dry and lingering aftertaste, a great Arizona Summer beer me thinks."
"Light yellow with a decent head...light smell, some citrus notes. Nothing spectacular, but ok. Taste was citrusy and light. Might be a very good alternative to light beer? Finished mildly. Mouthfeel was light and smooth. Drinkability was very good, definitely easy enough to drink more than one."
"The beer pours a cloudy pale yellow color with a frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a spicey yet sweet wheat malt scent. The yeast enhances the aroma and gives it a banana like fruity smell. The taste is average. It has a fruity wheat taste, but it is overshadowed by the metal can flavor. It also has a mild grapefruit flavor that isn't very good. The mouthfeel is average also. It is a medium bodied beer with less than adequate carbonation. This is an average witbier. It just goes to show, you never trust Belgian beer in a can."
"Smooth flavor and great aftertaste. The beer is very tasty overall. A little different then a typical wheat."
"$4.99 for a sixer."
"Notes: Zzzzz..."
"Hazy yellow, nice full white head. Lemon and coriander aroma with a touch of hops. Decent taste, but very light. Nice crisp wheat and lemon flavors. A distracting metallic lingering bitterness pervades the finish. The mouthfeel is average,as is the drinkability, as is the beer in general. This is a treat for the macro drinker. Beer Advocates would do better to buy Hoegaarden for a similar price. Or any host of better wits at any price."
"Overall Impression: Even out of a can, this is a great wit. One of my favorite examples of the style and it seems largely unappreciated. The spice level is balanced, making it deliciously drinkable. I've been told that the brewing method for this beer is atypical: rather than add the spices to the boil, they are steeped like a tea and added to the wort at bottling."
"Very drinkable brew. A decent, if not stellar wit beer."
"This is a good beer for a hot day."
"Flavor: t's an OK white beer, but nothing compared to Celis, Hoegaarden or Allagash. It doesn't have the crispness I'd expect."
"Light gold color, very cloudy, medium head. Aroma is fruity and sweet. A medium bodied white/wit beer. Mild tasting and flavorful. More flavor and body than a typical wit beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is smooth and clean. Aftertaste is sweet. Nice refreshing taste."
"This would be a great beer to have after mowing the lawn instead of lemonade."
"I've had this in the can, but it's also available now in an 11.2 oz bottle. Light citrus notes blend nicely with the bitter orange peel on the palate. Slightly cloudy appearance when poured into a glass, but not too much floating around. Great carbonation (especially for a can) adds to the refreshing appeal of this wit. I think Wittekerke is a good represention of the style and very drinkable for such an inexpensive brew. The shrink-wrapped six pack cans just add to the fun."
"Another canned offering. Hazy yellow, white head as is typical of the Wits, nothing spectacular. Some spice and citrus smell, not particularly noticeable. Tastes clean with a medium body, I mostly taste orange and lemon peels. More bitter than other wit biers, but not hop bitter of course. Some mild spices. Refreshing and very drinkable, especially since it came in a can."
"Again, not a bad beer. The overwhelming citrus flavor is surprising. A bit tasty, but not mind-blowing at all. Could make an interesting beer choice for a micro-novice. pat"
"This beer pours a cloudy yellow with a nice puffy white head and a little lacing on the glass. The aroma was a little wheaty and spicy with some hints of citrus. The flavor was very smooth and had a little spice with the expected wheaty-ness expected from a wit beer. This is a very enjoyable Belgian wheat and a good representation of the style."
"For a relatively cheap Belgian wit, not a terrible beer at all. Since it comes in cans (even though I didn't sample it that way), this shoots to the top of my can list."
"It would not be my first choice for a Begian Wit, but the can makes it convenient for location that do not allow bottles."
"A nice beer to bring to the beach where bottles are frowned upon. Pours an opaque, frosted straw color with a snowy white head that fades to a constant thin topping. Lots of trailing and clinging lace. The aroma is damp earthy and lime-aid-like. The wheaty malt body is thin and the bitterness is almost totally lemon-lime-like. Lightly sweet and mildly tangy. A slight back of the throat astringent sensation detracts a little from the overall drinkability, but all in all, fairly good canned beer."
"Wittekerke: A Belgian white beer, a hazy golden color, with tiny flecks, likely the yeast. Not much head, but what there is was rather thick, with nice staying power and lace. Aroma is slightly astringent, but rather weak. Hmm, very soda tasting for a beer, very much like a 7 Up, with just a hint of dryness/sourness toward the end. Very little aftertaste, but significant carbonation. Iâ€™m torn, this is very light, nice flavor, exceptionally easy to drink, but on the other hand, its more like a pop than a beer. When its hot, its worth reaching for."
"This brew poured a transparent yet cloudy wheat yellow colored body and a small head of fine white bubbles that was mostly lasting. It had a mild citrus like flavor. It is a drinkable brew but not great brew and one I would not go out of my way to get."
"Decent mouthfeel and a decent summer brew."
"Serve this baby ICE COLD!!! for maximum enjoyment. Here'e an understated (in a good way-sometimes understated can be rather charming, especially when it's 96 degrees and humid and your mouth is parched and begging to be refreshed) completly quenching summer beer. This one pours a pretty, hazy, pale yellow and offers up subtle aromas of citrus peel and grain. The snow white head provides a nice accent color, however this quickly fades. Still the taste is right on, with ample carbonation. This refreshes in the way a cool lemonade might but, it's an all grown-up drink that indeed tastes like beer. It won't win any awards for complexity so lighten up, and just enjoy it for what it is! Found it for 6.99 a sixer/ 11.2 oz bottles-sufficient bang for the buck I'd say. I'm pulling one out of the freezer now! Ahhhhhhhhhh-Deeelicious!!"
"A gateway beer, if you will."
"11.2 oz can. Poured a cloudy pale yellow, with very little head. There is some fine lacing left on the glass. Aroma of wheat and citrus is present. Taste is lighly tart, good carbonation, with no odd flavors, no sign of hop bitterness. Nice and smooth. I could sit and drink this all night. Of all the Wits I've had this is the best."
"Poured a hazy yeklow color with big blooming head,smell was very lemony and almost to sour.Like others who have reviewed this I think this lacked spiciness that Iam accustomed to with this style,way to one-dimensional.Not overly impressed with this one,there are many better out there."
"Pours cloudy yellow, big, white head doesn't stick around too long. Aroma is lemony, sour, some spices sneak through. Taste starts a little sour, a little sweet - banana, lemon, and some spices. Body is on the lighter side of medium A decent white, but I prefer the Hoegaarden or Allagash versions."
"My first introduction to witbiers occured this summer, and I was able to sample both Hoegaarden and Wittekerke on tap. I remember at the time really enjoying the Wittekerke even more so than the Hoegaarden. However, when I came back from California I really haven't seen this beer. So, I decided to sample it again this time in a bottle. Appears a light hazy golden hue, very pale int he pour with a gleaming foamy white head. The aroma is an amazing mixture of banana, spices, and honey sweetness this is one spiced up monster of a wheat beer. Wittekerke in my opinion does everything Hoegaarden attempts and does it better. Thank heavens I have found a real white beer. The mouthfeel is full and chewy with traces of the spiced up yeasty, wheat combo the flavor is well balanced and amazingly done. Very drinkable I am sold that this is the best Belgium wit style I have had to date."
"Normally I steer clear of anything that comes in a can but this one was highly recommended. Poured super cloudy honey colored with very little head and only mild lacing. Not much of an aroma but a very smooth ale and impressive to me only because of the can factor. I didn't really taste anything metallic at all. Subtle wheat taste and even less yeast flavor. I would definately drink it again but there are so many better than this. Great in a glass restricted enviroment i.e. boating, by the pool etc."
"Pours a very cloudy pale yellow... almost looks like lemonade. Has a thin white head, and leaves just a bit of lace on the glass. Aroma is lemon, yeast, and a touch of cloves. Flavor is dominated by lemon, with some musty yeast notes coming through. Mouthfeel is thin and light... a very refreshing ""lawnmower beer."""
"Thanks to NeroFiddled for this interesting brew!"
"A Belgian white in a can? A first for me. Pours a hazy pale yellow, like diluted grapefruit juice. Aroma is fresh and clean, lightly yeasty. Mouthfeel is likewise quite light, but not thin. Flavors of soft white-bread with a touch of lemon and tropical fruit in the far background. Nothing noteworthy, but quite pleasant and drinkable - sort of a Hoegaarden light. A lawnmower beer of the Belgian variety."
"Pours to a cloudy, straw color; looks a bit like grapefruit juice. It forms a white heat the quickly dissipates. The aroma is a citric zest fruitiness, but I also detected a grainy smell as well. The flavor again has fruitiness to it, somewhat lemony. It has a slightly tart finish to it. It is a definite refresher. It would be great on a hot summer day."
"I feel that this was much to sweet to be a wit beer. It has some good lemon characteristics and a nice wheat taste but knid of a dull sweetness that I don't like to much. I think this pales in comparison to Hoeggarden in bottle and especialy on tap. I didn't have it with a lemon so maybee that would even out the sweetness, next time we'll give it a go."
"Pours a pale yellow colour topped by a thick white head that settles down rather easily. The aroma was dominated by wheat. Taste is quite satisfying and it tastes fine at any time of the day. Look out for this beer. Worth tasting it"
"Soft texture, wonderful drinkability, some graininess, but still creamy, luxurious. I could drink this by the pitcher on a hot summer day! Tastes great anytime, though."
"Notes: Iâ€™d prefer this brew bottle-conditioned though the canned version is not bad at all and is a perfect switch if in a situation that restricts you to canned beverages only. All in all a decent white ale."
"The cloudy yellow body is topped by a firm and bright white head that holds well and leaves some nice lace. The aroma offers a somewhat sweet and fruity, lightly earthy and floral malt with a gentle clove note. The body is light, but with an extremely fine, natural carbonation that makes it oh-so-supple in the mouth. Like velvet! The flavor offers very lightly tangy notes of sugary lemon and orange peel along with a bright & fresh but restrained clove spiciness . Wonderfull. The finish is short, and lightly sweet, with a very gentle reminder of the flavor that was just had, beckoning you to have another sip. A very delicate beer. What I like about this beer is that the spice is so clear - although it comes at the expense of a limited yeast, and to some extent, malt character. One of my thoughts at first tasting this was ""Budweiser with spices"" but it's far more complicated than that. Still, this is very refreshing and quite enjoyable with some interesting flavors."
"Off-white/yellow color and simple, fine beaded head. Clear, bright aromas of honey and late-summer flowers: goldenrod, grasses etc. Supple, light texture carries subtle notes of fresh lemon juice, orange peel and acorn. Wonderfully uncomplicated. Creamy. Drink with ceviche, grilled bass or tuna salad. A great crossover opportunity for future True Beer drinkers as well as a great cleansing salve for tired Beer Advocate palates."
"Hazy banana color, close to the pineapple Lifesaver candy in color. Decent bright white sugary head of 1/2 an inch. Slight lemon aroma, not particularly yeasty. Very understated flavor, just a very smooth ester sense with a trace of vanilla and a very, very sweetened lemon finish (like a lemon bar cookie)...Wits are tough for me, some leave me unsettled in the swallow and some are excellent. There's nothing offensive in this beer but little else to challenge the tongue, either. So, to me, mediocre flavor but as drinkable as a frosty root beer at a carnival."
"Bright lemony aroma springs out when poured. Active, quickly dissipating head is perfectly white and the body is an extremely pale yellow that takes on a faint greenish tint at times. Nice balance of citrus and spices. Flavor tastes on more of the orange peel than lemon and coriander is noticeable but not too strong. Actually quite enjoyable and not bland at all."
"Cloudy orange-yellow. Fluffy white head that held long enough. Light floral tones on the nose. Very light and smooth, tanginess on the finish. The wheat really didn't shine through like I'd expect. Quite drinkable. I'll definatly revisit this one, as I have a gut feeling I missed something."
"light yellow in color.Nice citrus nose,lemon zest taste with quick dry finish,slight creamyness.Good representation of the belgian Wit.Would like a little more depth in a beer."
"Cheers to frank4sail for the sample. Send me a couple cases of this stuff bro!"
"Very pale-golden beer, cloudy with a thick creamy head.  Aroma was a bit floral and spicy with undertones of yeast.  Flavor was citrusy with plenty of yeast.  Very refreshing beer."
"I'll have to research the importer.  It was great while it lasted."
