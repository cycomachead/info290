"My all time favorite hefe, don't judge. It is perfection."
"Overall:  A nice, straight-forward light wheat beer.  While there are better, I found this beer to be very good and enjoyed it.  I would gladly drink this again."
""
""
""
"Hazy look.  Smells of spices with a little bit of citrus.  Smooth and refreshing taste.  I really like this Belgian beer, especially on draft."
"Light/pale color, almost fruity in smell, but had a heavy malt flavor in taste."
""
"O- A pretty good example of a Witbier as far as the Aroma and Taste goes but a weak body and oddly high carbonation for the style really damage this beer. Definitely not a bad beer, just not a great Witbier."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very carbonated compared to most Belgians - something I didn't like. Smells and feels great but better tasting Belgians out there."
""
""
"This was a great example of a near-perfect Witbier."

"Love this beer. Hazy look to it. Drinks very nice."
""

"D - Exceptional. This beer is a very good, widely available Belgian Wheat. Definitely worth one's time."
""
""
""
"2/22 - Draft (Delilah's Chicago) - Very crisp white pour, with a decent body. Smelled pleasant with citrus and other fruits. Taste was very good, and I enjoyed both the feel and texture. Not very strong, but the flavour made up for it. I like this beer and look forward to future pours."
"My favorite beer during the summer, refreshing and best with Orange."
""
""
"Overall - This is a very good beer, one I would highly recommend and certainly buy again, especially once the weather gets hotter. Give this one a shot, you will not be disappointed."
""
"Overall : An average white beer that is too bland and missing a little freshness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Such a good beer overall. Smell is strange at first, barn like. No hops in smell mostly citrus and coriander. The taste is mostly wheaty with subtle citrus and banana notes. Very crisp."
""
""
"My go-to beer.  I prefer to pour it in a chalice.  The color is always bright yellow with a perfect white head of foam.  By far the best mass market wheat beer in existence.  The true nectar of the gods.  The best part about it is that it doesn't taste like wheat at all.  Hoegaarden tastes like sweet citrus, with refreshing carbonation and a very smooth finish.   If I were stranded on a deserted island and I could only take one lifetime supply of beer, this would be it."
"Fell in love with this beer visiting my brother in Belgium back in 1998. When it finally became available in the states, I was overjoyed. The Americanized version was not quite as good, but still outstanding. As I come from a family of wine snobs - this is my go to dinner beer, though it is great anytime."
""
""
"I don't really like Belgian White's, so that's really my only beef here other than a horrible after taste."
""
""
""
"Great tasting and crisp. A staple in my fridge."
"One of my favs. A non-bitter without being too fruity"

"Typical Belgian. Very nice mouthful. Creamy, fine carbonation. Very nice when the mood strikes."
""
"I like this beer and will look forward to my next drink."
"Super silky smooth wit.  A little more watery than I remember it but still substantial in flavors & aromas."
""
""
"So tasty, so entirely refreshing"
""
"I like the cloudy appearance, but it's a little bit like the Bulgarian wheat drink called : ""boza"""
""
""
""
""
"A lovely beer, as far as I'm concerned, and one of those that opened my eyes to the possibilities of a wheat beer.  Excellent stuff all around."
"I am finding I don't like plain wheat jus flavored!"
"Not a real fan of coriander or cilantro in my food.  Same for beer.  This has a good look and mouth feel but I couldn't drink it.  I trust the brothers ratings and for most everyone this is probably a good beer.  Sorry to say this."
""
""
""
""
"Very refined beer, with pronounced spices aroma. Excellent in all occasions"
""
"The Taste is so much better than its cloudy appearance. Top of its class. So glad it is year round."
""
"The classic Belgium white wheat beer."
"Tastes very sour, kind of like saint monon but lower quality"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Crisp, flavorful and refreshing .  Highly drinkable and perfect when thirsty."
""
""
""
"One of my favorite White Ale's. Cloudy look with a great taste. My only issue is that there is barely any head on the beer, which makes it look a little flat when poured."
""
""
"Tried the original whereas there is a locally made version which is a very good reproduction; but for same price as was when imported, I don't think so.  When in Korea, you drink this because either there is no better option or you just don't know the taste of the real deal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good color and an easy pour with not a lot of foam.  Overall, good taste but, it needs to be really cold for me to enjoy."
"Very powerful estery smell that overpowers the rest of the beer."

"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 16A). Bottle 33 cl - Batch 02222:1319 AROMA: orange and citrusy aromas mixed with coriander. mdoerate sweet wheat background. hop aromas not discernible. APPEARANCE: pale straw color and hazy. average moussy white head with below average retention. TASTE: mild sweetness with a wheat component that persists. the coriander and citrus flavours are less stronger than the aromas. low bitterness with a semi-sweet finish. PALATE: medium-low body with average carbonation. OVERALL: the traditional wit with more subtle flavours than the aromas."
""
"O: For a witbier available at my local grocery store for a reasonable price, this is quite tasty. A little more strength in the body, and I'd call it a regular."

"Overall: I felt compelled to try this after a reviewer on this site claimed that once you've had one, you never go back.  well, that might be overstating the case, but this beer is not bad.  I really like Franziskaner, and therefore I think I admire the yeastiness of this one too.  I am not sorry I bought it.  I'll probably get it again: a good addition to the growing fridge collection."

"02/24/13 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. This is a solid, consistent brew that I use to build on, a la ""The Dirty Hoe"" (w/ a splash of Framboise) or as a session filler. If I'm drinking too much too fast I'll call for a Hoe, dirty or otherwise."

"An ok beer that i would have again if nothing better available. It made a good thirst quencher in Singapore back in the days, when it was this or Tiger beer. Tasty and has some character, but still not near as exciting as Blanche de Namur or Blanche de Bruxelles, which remain on top of the style in my opinion."

"O - A nice wit. I like the use of coriander and orange peel, which is perfectly blended into the rest of the beer.  For me the banana and bubblegum are just slightly too pronounced, nevertheless an awesome beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"By far the best Belgian White I've had.  Not only could you distinctly smell the coriander and orange peel, but it mixed well with the wheat and barely unlike any other.  Mouthfeel was smooth and crisp and it had a great citrusy taste that I found very appealing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I believe the brewer kept it simple with their blend of yeast. It's a soft, hazy, and mild Belgian Wheat Beer."
""
""
""
"A little too much spices for me, but better than OB or Cass when in Korea. I know this is not from Korea, but a lot of bars have Hoegaarden for some reason."

"To date the best beer I have had."

"I'm a white beer fan and Hoegaarden has it's own flavour which is stronger than for example Tucher or such. A must try beer."
"Refreshing beer, very light with a slight citrus taste. Would drink it again."

"Hoegaarden does some good Belgian beers for a large-scale brewery, and this is the most common one you'll find in bars and restaurants.  It's a witbier, and it's pretty middle of the road for its kind, though certainly many have tried to copy it over the years because of its success.  I think some of the local craft brews in the US have improved upon the original though."

"The vanilla and clove qualities make it taste a bit like a crisp, dry hefeweizen. The spicy, peppery qualities are thankfully mild, making this one pretty balanced and refreshing."

"Final score: 3.625"
"Excellent wheat beer. Great aroma with hints of banana and citrus. Easy drinking with delightful after-taste. One of my favorites!"
"Probably one of the worst, if not the worst beer I have ever had. Leaves a horrible taste in your mouth when you finish."
""
"One of my favorite beers. Great flavor of orange peel and coriander. A little pricey, but worth the buy."

"Pale, hazy yellow liquid in my wiezen glass, with an enormous, white, rocky head that takes forever to settle down to where I can actually drink it. Faint scents of coriander and clove fill my nose with similar flavors on my tongue accompanied by just the barest hint of banana bread. A little bit of orange peel makes itself known on the back of my tongue. Creamy, medium bodied. Not bad for the style, but there's much better out there."
""
"It's easy to look for ways to mark this beer down because you kind of want to because it's so well known and common but, being totally fair and honest, it is an excellent wheat beer. The head is fluffy white, the colour is exactly what you would like to see in a wheat beer - cloudy and golden with streams of bubbles - and the smell and taste is smooth, inviting and rewarding. I imagine I could sit and drink this one after another until I fell over and enjoy every minute of it. It's a really delicious and enjoyable beer that's accessible for almost everyone. It's both an easy entry beer and a beer you'll want to return to."

"Good choice for summer wheat. It always tastes different every time i try it."
""
""
""
"But honestly, it's solid.  Sweetest banana/clove/bubblegum scent I've had from a wit.  Light, rounded, yeasty taste with good carbonation.  Have it at least once."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.73) : Hoegaarden is one of those simple pleasures in life that cannot fully be explained in words. It's a Belgian beer and man do I love those Belgians. If you want to study a course in Belgian witbiers, start here - it's the beginning and the end of the journey."

"330 ml bottle into pint glass, best before 8/11/2014. Pours hazy golden straw color with a 2 finger dense and rocky white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pear, orange peel, light banana, coriander, clove, wheat, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spice, and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, pear, orange peel, light banana, coriander, clove, wheat, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, pear, orange peel, light banana, coriander, clove, wheat, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spice, and pale malt notes; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish as expected of 4.9%, Overall this is a damn nice witbier. All around well balanced and robust flavors of fruity/earthy yeast, spice, and pale malt; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"I really like witbiers, and I especially like ones with subtle variety of flavor. What's present here is nice, but there's not enough of it. Needs more potency or more complexity. But it's rather refreshing as is."
"Overall: I like this beer overall. I am a fan of wheat beers and this hits the spot. Sweet with some lemon."

"Its light, fizzy, fluffy, creamy and I love it! The first time I ever had this beer I fell in love with it and ever since then I compare most wheat beers I try to it. It pours light and cloudy with a soft gold color and has a very thick foamy head. Tastes very smooth and thin, yet it has a rich citrus and vanilla finish which rounds the beer off wonderfully. I'd recommend this one to anyone who wants to try Belgium beers!"

"DATE REVIEWED: May 22, 2014... GLASSWARE: Hoegaarden tumbler... OCCASION: freshman baseball--officially over, and marking the day with the official wit... APPEARANCE: pours a pale, golden yellow, unfiltered and misty with bubbles; white uneven head rings the glass; attractive... AROMA: profound yeast and lemon zest; a suggestion of citrus, but not enough to overpower... PALATE: bubbly, refreshing almost medium-bodied; a bit fizzy too; unlike most wits, it supplies a lingering aftertaste... TASTE: tart--banana! lemon is secondary, and some citric, slightly acidic elements in the aftertaste--this is what warm nights were made for...OVERALLL: I recall being really turned on to this beer in 2003, when traveling through Europe in record-breaking heat drove Shan and I toward sidewalk cafes and alcohol that refreshed; cutting through the sentiment, Hoegaarden does indeed refresh with enough character to be sought after among the myriad of summer ales...."

"O: A great beer to have with lettuce, fish or other light meals. Good to have outside, too, especially on sunny days."
""
"This beer is a decent beer. The taste is not that bad. It was an ok beer. I enjoyed it, but it was not my favorite beer that I have had. But I still would recomend it to frends and family. It just was not my favprite type of beer. I still would recommend it to friends that I drink with."
"O: This is a very nice warm weather beer. Possibly my favorite wit."

"It's one of the hell out beer! It's taste is awesome, you'll never taste a beer like this, is tasty orange citric feel and his beautiful green color it only make it better. Better consumes very cool, or draft, in bottle it might be a little fuzzy cause the gas, it's a tradicionaly wite beer, go for yourself"
""
""
"Overall: Steady eddie. Peppery, spicey in the finish."
"A little better than okay, for the light wheat beers. Strong taste of cloves, light cloudy white in appearance. A little bite when going down, another attribute. In the family of Belgian beers, my favorite so far is Stella. This one rates a close second."

"Hoegaarden Original White Ale brewed Brouwerij van Hoegaarden. This brew pours out a cloudy amber color with a small white head. The smell is ok nothing bad. You can smell the citrus in this beer. The taste is nice and crisp with some citrus. This brew goes down smooth. There is nothing bad about this brew. I would get this brew again. Over all, I'm giving this brew a 3.75 out 5."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours cloudy and the color of light straw. When held to the light in the room it's a lemony yellow. head is fat white and lasts. Nose was mild. Lemon a bit of pepper and some wheat like a light cracker. Taste follows the nose all the way. Lemon on light cracker with a bit of tartness on the back end. Watery and thin body. It finishes very dry and leaves a light sweetness in the aftertaste. Refreshing and very mild."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not one who usually goes for lighter beers but I really enjoyed this one. A simple style that was elegantly executed. It pours a light but hazy yellow with a nice white head. The smell is full of citrus and Belgian wheat. The taste is light with a bunch of citrus flavors like lemon, orange peel, and a hint of banana that add to the wheat flavor and give it a nice crisp finish. The mouthfeel is the only problem for me as it was a little too light for the winter but I can see this being a staple of the summer. Very much enjoyed and would definitely recommend to any blue moon fans looking to step it up."
""
""
""
"O- Nothing really blows me away, but an example that is true to the style."
""
""
""
"O - a great tasting wheat beer that I will revisit."
"Pours a hazy golden 'lemon' in color with a about a 3-finger white foamy head that stays around for a while before settling down to about 4-5mm. Some sediment is seen in the bottom of the bottle after the pour. A decent amount of lacing is seen with each sip. The aroma is of wheat, grains, lemon with orange peel and spice. The taste is about the same with the mix of orange and lemon zest coming through first with some spice for the finish. Semi-sweet also. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation. Actually not a bad 'white ale' that doesn't have a harsh or bitter aftertaste unlike some."
""
""
""
"By far, my favorite beer. I keep it on tap at home and enjoy it year round. A perfect summer wit bier that still refreshes in the cold winter months. I have had the pleasure of visiting the brewery in Hoegaarden, Belgium twice. If only I could get the american bartenders to pronounce the name correctly. They insisit on Hoe instead of Hoo. Nevertheless, this Belgian wheat has set the standard for all the american rip-offs like Blue Moon."
""
""
""
"Great yeast esters, with more malt body than I recall. Not my favorite style, and the skunky notes are slightly offputting. Finished a little weak, but a good, classic beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Not a big witbier fan but the flavor profile is pretty nice. Just wish it wasn't so toned down. Seems like its made to appeal to a wide variety of people that aren't all craft beer drinkers. Still not bad and quite refreshing."

"Oddly enough, Hoegaarden has somewhat convinced me to move from IPA and start drinking wheat-ier beers. Bottle is appealing, has a tart and spicy taste, is quite refreshing, and very easy to drink. I could drink it every day. It stands alone or is good with food, and has the benefit of being easy to find in grocery stores. Even Trader Joes has it, and it is cheap. Well worth it."

"Overall: I could drink this one by the gallon. Good, assertive taste from the wheat and yeast without being overly spiced like some wits. My favorite wit that I've had so far. Would make an excellent summer beer. I would rank Hoegaarden below most hefeweizens but above most American pale wheats. Exceedingly refreshing and a good change of pace from the boozy DIPAs and stouts common this time of year."

"good beer I like and will have more. has a nice head and some lace . would be good at a BBQ or a high end eatery. I think a lot of ladies would like it. it is not so strong aromatically . served in a pint glass slightly warm but good. this is my time with this beer and I will share with my friends my thoughts."

"Had on tap for the purpose of this review. This was a grad school staple however and I am quite familiar with this classic witbier in the bottle as well. A hazy banana yellow beer with a decent amount of white head and ample carbonation, Hoegaarden smells of fruity yeast esters first and foremost, along with some dry bread and phenolic spice notes like allspice or dilute clove. I remember this beer being hugely fruity and fairly sour as well, less spicy, and my memory was indeed pretty accurate. A little dry popcorn malt and lots of bubble gum/tutti fruity esters along with some banana, the spicy phenols take a back seat but there is a sour backdrop that evokes a little raw pineapple or maybe unripe apples or pears that prevents the sweetness from being cloying. The coriander spice shows up in the finish along with a pleasant lemony sourness but is fairly downplayed, to the betterment of the beer itself (drink this and then try a Rickards White or another mainstream US or Canadian wit and you'll see what I mean ... The Europeans use this spice more strategically and do not carpet bomb the taste buds). Mouthfeel is a bit chewy and there is some residual sweetness but the body is still fairly thin and watery, I guess its a witbier after all. If there is a standout flaw, said flaw is too much carbonation that masks the fruit and spice flavors more than is necessary. Still, any wit fan should know this icon."

"Uniquely spicy, but not for everyone or every occasion. I enjoy it mostly by itself, although it goes very well with meals, especially heavy ones. I love the smoooth texture, light quality, cardamom and orange spice, and full-yet-manageable head. Right now, other beers simply are bland to me."
""
""
""
""
"O: What happened? Either my tastes have changed or this beer has declined. I'm not sure which... Certainly it has that coriander-heavy quality that I recall. Not a terrible beer by any means. Just not what I remember..."

"As the standard for Wit Bier, Hoegaarden pours as one would imagine with a cloudy golden hue and a big head that lingers around just long enough. Coriander is persistent throughout the nose and flavor. This is backed up by zesty orange lemon and some spicier pepper notes . A light body and aggressive carbonation is is balance with a slight creaminess in the mouth feel that lends itself to an enjoyable and easy drinking beer."

"Overall: It's hard to complain about this since it is often considered to be the standard witiber, although it's certainly not the best. It's a refreshing beer with good flavor, but it's also not that interesting either. Without a doubt the best witiber that's widely available (I can find it at any grocery store and many gas stations) but it's not complex enough to be intriguing."
""
""
""
""
""

"O - refreshing with decent flavors, but too heavy on the coriander in my opinion"
""
""
"Wheat beers are like grilled cheese sandwhiches, since they are all pretty decent its very hard to find one that stands out. This one does in its unique, floral taste. Hoegaarden is tasty and refreshing, the flavor is floral with some citrus and spice. Quite light and smooth, bit creamy"

I would recommend this beer to anyone, especially for a first witbier."

"So this is a basic wit beer that is a summer classic. I really don't need to review much here, maybe over spiced which cheapens the taste but overall, you throw a lemon wedge in this on a hot summer day its quite enjoyable. The rating is really based on what it is, and that's a tasty beer to have in quantity during the summer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy pale straw yellow with one-finger white head that dissipates quickly to a froth cap. Decent lacing. Typical witbier aroma, orange zest and coriander. Taste is spicy with a faint malt sweetness. Goes down dry and finishes slightly bitter. Light bodied with effervescent carbonation make this one great summer session beer."
""
""
"I won't drink much of it because white ales are just not my thing, but damn is it a good example of one. Rickard's be damned."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This was the first beer I ever liked and I still like it alot to this day. The orange peel and coriander provide a more unique flavour than most beers and it stands out from the crowd as different. The lack of carbonation actually works in its favour and this beer is best enjoyed from the official glass, which adds to the experience if you are already a fan. The Belgian monks that created this knew what they were doing!"

"Poured 2/3 into a frosted pint glass, swirled remainder in bottle and poured the rest. Definitely a sexy and refreshing looking beer. Pours a cloudy yellow with nice foamy white head. Lots of noticeable carbonation and unfiltered sediment! Sweet aroma of orange and coriander. The taste meets the nose with the orange and coriander. Very smooth and light. A touch sweet, but good. Refreshing! Great Summer beer no matter how you slice it. I'd have again on a hot Summer day!"
"Overall: Good beer. Hoegaarden is a classic wit that manages to hold up well in this era of microbrews. Tasty and sessionable."

"HW is better balanced, with no alcohol feel in the mouth. Although lacking balanced flavor, LT does not taste overly alcoholic, but there is more alcohol feel in it. Both are light and, under the right circumstances, refreshing. With right foods (e.g., Thai and Indonesian curries and Indian food that is not overly saucy) LT can be a very serviceable beer, but the strong coriander flavor and odor make it unsuitable for most occasions, including everyday drinking. HW is a perfectly reasonable everyday pour, especially in the summer. Original or not, it likely would not survive a comparison to some of the better American varieties, such as Allagash, but it can certainly hold its own. Long Trail, on the other hand, has a long learning curve ahead of it as a brewery. Even their best products (pale ale and IPA) seem to offer only a single taste note, where competitors offer a bouquet of flavors and aromas. Hoegaarden does pretty much only one thing but it does it rather well."

"Overall I was a little disappointed. It was a good beer, but something that I would grow tired of after two pints."

"Will pour a five+ white head. Just as expected for a wheat, pale straw and cloudy, good head, faint yeast and distinct wheat flavor but what else would you expect - this brewery has it down after 568 years. 330ml bottle from Gift Specialists Oceanside, California."

"Cloudy pale gold with a huge white head comprised of tiny bubbles that takes a while to settle and laces nicely. The smell is clean wheat maltiness with lemon and orange citrus combined with some peppery spice pretty much spot on for a Wit. When it comes to the taste the spices come out in the front with the citrus moving to the background, a background well framed in by the wheat. Also perceivable is some yeast character but overall everything is a bit overshadowed by the coriander spiciness. The mouthfeel is acceptable with high levels of carbonation combined with a light body however I would have preferred it to be a bit crisper with a cleaner finish. Overall this is a very commendable example of the style and as one of the most easily recognized and available witbeirs it is doing the style justice"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"O: Solid and very drinkable but overall pretty plain."
"I like this beer -- particularly in warm weather it's very nice indeed. As is often the case I could stand for the mouthfeel to be more assertive, to provide a better foundation for the flavors -- it's a little too light, I think, for my taste. But all in all a classic that deserves it's standing."
""
""
""
""
""
"Served very cold in 22 ounce mug. Bright yellow, and hazy in appearance, very appealing color, but poor head retention and zero lacing. Smells really interesting, even for a wit, with all the smells from a bowl of fruit loops. Taste was strangely spicy on the front end, and then refreshingly sweet and fruity on the finish. Thin in the mouth, but bubbly somehow. I was really thirsty, and this beer hit the spot. I loved it so much, I decided to brew my own version of it! Way better than the more widely available Coors version of the same style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This seems like a love-it-or-hate-it. The spicing is probably too bold for those who prefer more subtle flavorings, but those who like things up close and personal would probably love it. I can appreciate both depending on the beer, but I fall into the love it column on this one."

"This ale is easy to like and very hard to hate. I've had Hoegaarden both from the bottle and on tap, and I've never noticed a significant difference between them. I enjoy mine with a slice and squirt of orange. As others have noted, Hoegaarden might not be quite as good as competitors like Allagash White, but it's cheaper and always refreshing."
""
""
""
""
"O: The beer that will convince almost anyone who ""hates beer"" that there's more than light beers and IPAs to choose from. A good summer beer best enjoyed neither too cold nor too warm. The bottle is a bit small at 11.2 ounces, however that's not entirely uncommon for imports."

"O: I bought a six pack a while ago when I was first experimenting with new beers. This is a pretty decent macro honestly. A bit bland but fairly sessionable and ,imo, better than some of the other belgian whit macros like Shocktop and Rickards white.

"The beer pours a hazy, pale straw and our vigorous pour provides a pillowy head of white foam. Wheat and coriander, and orange peel dominate the nose, with hints of lemongrass and spice. The lemony aromas take charge on the palate. The initial zestfulness gives way to wheat and bready malt flavors on the way to a spicy finish that showcases coriander, clove, and orange zest. Lively carbonation and a lighter body"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Its hard to complain with this beer. For the price and ubiquity, this beer has few faults. Sure there may be better examples of the style, Ommegang and St Bernardus spring to mind, but hoegaarden can go toe to toe with the best wits and it will hold up well in my opinion. Sometimes you just want a quick refreshing beer that you can share with anyone, for those days hoegaarden will always be near. Great beer to start people on as well."
"The first time I encountered this (probably early 2008), I thought it smelled like a complete disaster. The times have changed. This is a classic, and it is certainly has its charms. It's extremely light, but it works. It's not top tier (thanks a lot, Allagash White, for demolishing the competition), but it's certainly way better than Blue Moon."

"this is the standard of all wit beers. smooth, taste is great, and no lingering bitterness. perfect. Its not extreem in flavor or alcohol content, so many will under rate this brew. If you want a witbeer that has drinkability unmatched, flavor so smooth, taste so perfect, this is the beer."

"(3.5) D: A decent witbier with an inviting aroma but falls off the mark with a fairly thin and flat taste. Can't really compare this to the more full flavoured options out there."
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-light in body, with plentiful, but soft carbonation that results in a soft, foamy mouthfeel that is quite enjoyable. Closes semi-dry, with light stickiness lingering across the palate. Very drinkable, repeatedly, exceptionally inviting here."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice - a decent Belgian wit that I find to be highly drinkable. It looks good, and the aroma/flavour have well-judged notes of fruit and spice. Was expecting higher carbonation, but this is a fairly trivial point. It is possible that Hoegaarden has become somewhat muted through AB-Inbev ownership, but it still comes across as well crafted. Would be perfect on a hot day, and deserves to be sampled."
"Reliable beer. I always like the fact that this beer is not overly sweet, flavorful and still refreshing. And now it is easily available in Brazil at a decent price given Ambev distribution."

"-Overall 3.5: Good witbier. Nothing fantastic, but absolutely nothing wrong. This is a classic, and rightly so, but there are bigger and better wits and wheats out there to be had. Watch the price, though. A friend of mine picked up a six-pack of these at Publix and paid almost $10 for them, which is insane; you could buy a ""brew your own"" kit for wheats for $25 and make 50 or so beers that would taste as good as this Hoe."

"This is one of my favorite Weissbiers.... Unlike most wheat beers, this has a lighter (white) color to it.... Instead of citrusy notes, this beer has more of a berry note to it.... I've enjoyed it out of the bottle and even more so from the tap.... Even after having many beers overseas, this still remains amongst the top wheat beers in the world.... At least, from what I've tried."

"This beer pours up a very weak looking straw color with a three finger head and some lacing. The nose is oranges, and some bready notes. Mouthfeel would be kind of watery except for the carbonation. Taste is very typical wheat beer with some citrus. There just aren't enough hops as the dominant flavor is sweet malt. Just kind of average all the way around."
""
""
""
"O: A beautiful widely available Witbier, lacks some characteristics of the style, although very balanced taste which makes it very refreshing on a hot day. The lable on the bottle recommends drinking it at 2-3°C which I found a little cold, I let it warm up to about 10°C which really supports a broader flavour and brings out the citrusy-flavours more."

"Review from 7/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a pale, pale opaque amber. White ale is appropriate. Moderate snow white head and lacing, continuous bubble formation. Mild wheat aroma. Wheat and citrus, spicy pleasantly peppery carbonation. This carbonation is unusual and refreshing. Somewhat dry finish with lingering cardamon and bitter spices. Interesting and different."

"O: Good witbier with the classic Belgian smell and taste to it. Worth having a few."
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Not bad for a wit, I’d take this over Blue Moon any day (not that that’s any great feat!)"
"A quality wit that gets thrown about in fruit beers or stouts as a mixer. Great as is. Tis the season. 4.0"
""

""
""
"To me, this is a largely overrated beer. Granted, I am not a big fan of wits, but I really don't think Hoegaarden has as much depth as some of the better beers in this style. It feels light, but that floral taste is just overwhelming. A little more lemon zest would be nice. Something."

"O - This Witbier seems to be the most popular of all offerings within the style, and for good reason. It showcases a pretty tasty flavor with a nice, enjoyable level of spice, and is just a good all-around Belgian ale. There's no doubt that I could enjoy a few more of these brews during this time of year and definitely look forward to having one again soon."

"Great beer. Not really much more to say about it. If you've had a Blue Moon, Hoegaarden White is basically like it. The only difference is, when adding the lemon slice it has a bit more tart to it. A little bubblier mouth feel and a little harder to swallow. But overall a great beer. I accidentally poured from the bottle too fast so I had to wait for the beer to ""un-fizz"" in a sense to pour the rest in. But the head lasted nicely and the aroma was very lemon-y. Like I previously said, just a great beer."

"Had a bottle of this at Ginza Aster in Ginza, Tokyo. Poured into a Hoegaarden wide-mouthed pint glass. Pours a beautiful cloudy wheat hue with a thick white tasty head on it. Strong presence of hops, wheat, and other florals as well as some orange and bitters. The mouthfeel is smooth enough, leaving me with the sense that this was a quality Belgian witbier. I could drink a few of these before I started to get tired of the wheat flavor. Overall, a great ubiquitous option for brews."

"Overall good and very refreshing."

"On tap at Kreegans. Poured into a standard pint glass. Pours a hazy straw color with little head (more of a bad pour than a characteristic of the beer). Also served with a lemon that I discarded The nose was a pleasant lemony, zesty coriander. Very nice, quite spicy. The taste followed suit with lots of lemon peel and spiciness; coriander and kind of white pepper. The mouthfeel was a little thin but finished quite crisp and refreshing. The spiciness really makes the beer and complements the fruit well. Great beer for the summertime"
""
"Absolutely delicious! With a delicious fruity aromas this beer has a definite citrus and tangy flavour that cannot be missed. It is a great summer quencher and looks cloudy on appearance. I thought it was supposed to be drunk with a slice of lime, but it tasted nice even without it. Definitely would try it again!"
""
"Overall: I have had a number of Belgian white ales and this is certainly a step above many of the typical contenders. This beer fits right in the middle of mediocre and excellent. It does not disappoint but it is good to keep trying other white ales as well."
""
""
""
""
"O - Behind that ""hark back to country life"" thing this beer evokes, there's an urban sophistication lurking. Up comes this wonderfully oily, complex, urban-lakefront (Chicago), urban coastline (Battery, Vancouver) vibe. This is one of those beers that says ""there's more here, if you just take the time."""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I've heard about this beer for a long time, and it's pretty solid and seems to hold up to it's reputation. Great summer beer with lots of flavor."
"there is one word to explain this beer. DELICIOUS. I party a lot, So I typically won't buy something with such a price tag unless I am only treating myself to it. Which is exactly what happened. One sip of this and I wouldn't let anybody else near it. I am typically weary of trying foreign beer after I bought dirty bastard, Which had the opposite effect. Probably the best tasting beer I have ever had, And the drink-ability is only second best to American Badass. Treat your self to this!"

"330ml bottle. Snifter glass. Enjoyed once again. Light pale yellow in color, foggy appearance. White, close & dense froth. Orange zest & lemon aromas. Bitter upfront, sour lemony hints. Slightly maltiness backbone. Light body, high carbonation. Watery, citric finish & aftertaste. Quite bland overall. (Nowadays available at most Supermarkets)"

"Pours a hazy pale gold, with a huge, frothy head. There are notes of orange and coriander in the nose, but they are relatively reserved. The taste is mild wheat malt, with hints of citrus and spice. Easy on the palate and supremely drinkable. This one is a classic. It may not be the boldest witbier, but it is easy one of the most drinkable."

"Finally picked this up to complete a 6-pack in San Diego. Although this is probably the quintessential benchmark of the style, I feel many U.S. brewers have passed them up. Although the appearance and nose are pretty well nailed on this brew, the flavor was marginal at best. At times I was vividly reminded of those Emergen-C powder packets that you mix with water. Not worth the price by any stretch of the imagination."

"Nice carbonation level plays well with the light body and lighter flavors. Overall, again, this is a very average witbier. A true benchmark for the style: if you brew a better wit than this, then your beet is above average."
""
"Nice translucid color (yellow) poured in a pint glass. Medium white head with good retention thru the whole test. It has an aroma mixed of spices, citrus and wheat. taste is not of my preferences but I enjoyed the experience. Maybe I am not going to drink this regularly."

"Pure white head, barely reaches half a finger even with an aggressive pour, sizzles down to nothing quickly, no lacing, looks like a tight array of ball bearings sliding down the glass side. While the liquid is the palest of yellows, its glow and ability to hold light inside amplifies its presence, reaches a gauzy opacity, haphazard large bubbles whiz upwards. The wheat is gentle in the nose, a drying supplement to the base of orange and lemon citrus, caraway, coriander, cinnamon and dried yeasts and baking dough, apricots and pears underneath, bare whiff of banana without impairing cleanliness, subtly steady length. Medium-bodied, semi-sluggish and apt to just plop down on the tongue, even allowing for a slight prickle from the carbonation. The anise, coriander, cumin spice supplemented by vanilla bean, these elements contribute to a sweetness throughout that lemon, orange citrus. Peach and apricot pulp, maybe melon or apple too. A few bubblegum notes. Wheat and grains appear about midway to dry out the palate. Keeps a steady message without too many moving parts, user friendly and not out to overtly challenge anyone."
""

"Light flavor profile. Slight malts, coriander, hint of cinammon. Snappy finish wraps it up nicely. A refreshing wit, but on the understated side."

"People tell me to never trust a Belgian. I can believe it now as I have a foggy yellow glass, chilled yet I still think the bartender got this from a guy who visited the mens room while a bit dehydrated. The head is a pure white, like the clouds that takes a bit of time to dissipate. The flavor is smooth yet overwhelming. I taste sausage, sausage, and more sausage. Now that you mention it I have not had a traditional European breakfast for an extended period that very much out stretches the length of my own sausage. Its almost salty, which is not a bad thing, but very much would go with my garlic seasoned sunny side up eggs. And perhaps a piece of the toast, with the real butter from next door and not the grocery. There is a medium carbonation, and the lace is still apparent. It would be much more pleasurable if it was the morning, as it should be waiting for me whenever I roll out of bed. From now on I will only trust a German..."

"Freshness date printed January 7th. Its March 24th so despite its average mouthfeel its still pretty damn good. I'll be having this one tomorrow."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good but light flavors and aromas."

""
"O-obviously this beer is not for me. I honestly would prefer an AAL - with a lime. OUCH."
"Overall – Crisp and clean, this refreshing beer is just begging for a barbecue to be enjoyed with."
"o - Overall a decent witbier. The nose is pretty nice, though the taste isn't very flavorful and a bit bland. Very easy to drink. Not really something I would seek out again but something I would certainly drink again if I had a limited selection and was looking for a light beer."

"This beer has a pale color body with a small fizzy head that lays down quickly. The smell is a little of wheat, not much else. The taste is a little citrus with a tab bit of spice, i think it is coriander. The mouth feel is easy drinking and overall a ok beer."

"Very drinkable beer. Poured from 11.2 oz bottle into glass. A nice golden cloudy appearance, with a large white head. Smells very bready. Very smooth mouthfeel, but doesn’t linger long. Very well balanced taste with points of light bitterness, sweetness, and a little sour in there as well. Overall a very enjoyable beer."
""
""
"Overall, this is a decent beer but not the best wit out there. Pretty run of the mill."
"O: I try not to talk dirty of beers I don't like but I'm not exactly kicking a dead puppy by scorning this multi award winning macro travesty. Along with Stella Artois I think it's one of the most overrated beers in the world, and it's really expensive so I make no apologies for saying it's genuinely one of the worst beers I've ever had."

"This is a quaffable beer, but light and ultimately not flavorful. I'll pass in the future."

"Not something I'd have ever bought myself & it does nothing to convince me that I should explore the style further. I may enjoy one of these after doing yard work but there are so many other brews available with a lot more going on in them. It wasn't bad, just really boring. "

"Pours a murky light orange with a 1/2 inch foamy white head that settles to a thin cap. Small chunks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of wheat, banana, spices, and some yeast aromas. Taste is of wheat, banana, and yeast. The spices come through on the aftertaste. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good witbier that is tasty and very easy drinking."

"Pale golden peachy colour, one finger of white head with some lace. Smell is yeasty and spicy, orange peel, malty, light lemony notes, decent amount of citrus as well. Taste is yeasty and ""wheaty"" citrus, orange, coriander, spicy, soft malt bill, spicy aftertaste with orange peel in the finish. Med-high carbonation, medium carbonation, medium body and fairly dry, good feel. Nice and easy drinking, haven't had this in a while and don't remember it being as good as this, I would have this again down the road though."

"The taste is pretty similar to the smell. A nice balance of malt and wheat, very short lived, almost lacking. But the perfume of the yeast comes through nicely. However the beer is rarely watery. But again, very drinkable."

"Can't beleive I never reviewed this. Great warm weather beer, but I'm having one in January. Bright white foam, nice lacing and a hazy straw yellow color. Looks great. Smells of wheat, a little fruity almost citrus like. Taste of wheat, citrus, some banana in there. This is a great wheat beer, I wish I could have had it in it's prime (before it was bought out)."

"Poured a cloudy white/yellowish color, decent white head but unfortunatelty never really sticks around leaving no reminents. Smells of oranges, wheat, bubblegum, other citrus. Taste is light wheat and orange up front with a bit of lemony, citrus flavors also present. Mouthfeel is light and watery with prickly carbonation. Good taste, crisp, citrusy. Definitely could drink many and often."

"D - Hoegaarden was, in all likelihood, my first beer that wasn't a lager. It was also the beer that turned me onto craft beer. Although it might not be as great as it used to be in my eyes, it'll always hold a place in my heart. Nice, simple flavor, nothing off. Really easy to drink, and makes a perfect summer beer. I'm confident that no matter where my journeys through the world of beer take me, this will always remain a constant in my fridge and in my heart."
""
""
"Unfortunately, since those experiences my affection for Hoegaarden has steadily deteriorated. I don't know if it is due to loss of character and flavor because of the transport from Belgium to the U.S. or because I have now had several other excellent witbiers. Regardless, Hoegaarden no longer impresses me the same way. Sure, it still stands as the hallmark of the style and I'm not sure I've ever seen such a beautiful, pale white glow in any other beer... but now when I drink it the beer seems to be too watery and thin and the unique flavors seem to be far too muted. Still a good beer, but not a great one."
"Poured this Witbier from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. It pours a hazy, yellow color- produced a decent white head. Decent retention and nice lacing left behind. The aroma is unique for a Witbier, a shot of cracked pepper and citrus lemon.The beer is light in body, mouthfeel is smooth- flavor of soft wheat, spicy pepper, and lemon zest. After some research i found that the pepper flavor originates from the yeast strain they use and the sour lemon flavor is from the hop additions. Great beer, probably the closest that youll find to the ""original"" of the style. Never a bad choice to fall back on. Prost!"

"I'm not sure how accurate my review is. This is definitely one of my least favorite styles of beer. I'm just not a big fan of the sweetness, tartness, and lack of hops. If I had to drink a wheat beer I would probably choose one of a German Style."
"everyone tries to copy this white ale, but it still stands distinctly alone as the original for me. cloudy and citrusy smelling, with a big pillowy head. has notes of spice and orange cream as well as a mellow floral hop profile. lighter body makes it a really easy session, but only when its super cold. i find this one gets a little bitter and funky yeasty when it warms up, so best to guzzle it down well its still chilly. too expensive for what it is, but a great white!"

I would love to have this in Belgium to see if it's better over there."

"O: A light, refreshing drink, probably better suited for a hot summer afternoon than the cool autumn evening I tried it."
"O: Not bad, but not a beer I will reach for unless I have to."
"Taste is light and crisp, banana bread and lemon, full creamy Mouthfeel and a bitter finish. For a big brewery its decent."
"D: Balanced and seamless. Very approachable – soft and pleasant. Wits have been taken some interesting directions, but it is easy to see why the original remains a benchmark."
"O - A fantastic refreshing beer that is superb on a hot day. A great session beer and without a doubt one of my favourites."
"For me so far the king of wit biers, great balance of everything. Pours a nice hazy lite yellow, a finger of head sometimes. I don`t get much on the aromatics from this, but then again I`m not snorting it.Wonderful mouth-feel, very easy to drink. Summer drink to most, but if it taste good consume it whenever. It`s a bit pricey to gobble down in a session or two, but might just be worth it."
"Overall- Witbiers aren’t my favorite style, and this one certainly is subdued. It smells great, as most Belgians do, but it doesn’t transfer to the taste very well. Would I get it again? Maybe, but I think I will be more inclined to try more witbiers from here on out."
"O: Very drinkable and enjoyable. A nice wheat beer. Hard to go wrong with this beer."
"And its drinkability is world top!"
"Overall: very sessionable, but I prefer heavier, more malty tasting beers. I can see why this does well on tap."
"O- I feel like I owe this beer a massive thank you. Not the best wit out there, but for a time I thought this was the best beer in the world. This is when I drank all the macro swill. This beer showed me there is better out there, and was my first step into better beer. I lost my ""good beer"" virginity to this I guess you could say."
"O- not really my type of beer. but was worth trying. could enjoy this on a hot day."
"Overall: I got a six pack as a gift and boy it was nice. I will pick up some more in the future, most likely in the summer time."
"O - A pleasant hot weather thirst quencher. Very sessionable."
"As I said before, highly drinkable, sessionable even. Modest ABV, decent carbonation, fairly short finish. Refreshing. Not gonna make a BA jump through hoops but a good choice if faced with the standard BMC offerings - you'll see this one at a lot of non-craft bars and restaurants."
"overall i like this beer even though i don't want to because it is an InBev product. but i could drink this beer on a regular basis if it wasn't for that... now i have to wait to enjoy this beer for a while to protest the evil corp. .... LOL oh well"
"D: This beer is a classic which goes beyond saying and it should be tried by all who like this style and it could be an intro beer to those who are hesitant to try anything other then domestic or Heineken. I have had better witbiers but it is still refreshing and delicious served cold."
"Overall Impression: It is a nice summer time beer. Light and refreshing. Had this after working in the yard and it hit the spot. Will definitely keep in the fridge during summers from now on."
"O - I just like this beer, it has a good flavor. It a great summer beer. Happy that I got a chance to drink it this summer."
"Overall: Good beer that is tasty and drinkable. Fits the style well and is quite tasty."
"O – A good beer, for sunny days! But you keep thinking there must be a better one out there."
"O - Overall this is a fine fine beer. I think I still prefer Allagash White, but this beer is a great Wit nonetheless. A wonderful beer to drink on a hot day, but I could drink it any time."
"Pours a cloudy light yellow color with a fluffy white head. Malts and wheat tickle the nose with some hints of citrus. There is a good taste to the beer with nice blend of wheats, malts, and lemon zest that it's difficult to pick out certain elements as they blend so nicely together. A little too watery but nothing to fuss about. A nice smooth easy drinking beer especially for those hot summer days."
"O: Well orchestrated witbier. Very crisp and refreshing. Nothing overwhelming but a solid all round beer."
"overall: why yes, i am partial to wits. especially hoegaarden. yes i know there are better ones out there, but try and find alagash white in day-effing-tona. not gonna happen. hoegaarden, however, can be bought at publix as an afterthought to your grocery list, just when you've started to dread heading back out into the molten parking lot. yes it will be hot, but there will be a cold wit on the porch when you get home."
"O: A decent everyday offering. Definitely better out there. Not a refreshing as some."
"My –and a lot of other people's, I'm sure– go-to witbier. Not the best by far (a little too sweet IMO, looks pretty terrible compared to others...) but still delicious and a great benchmark to compare others to."
"Overall, the brew is light and eminently quaffable, sliding down with expected Belgian fruit-spice ease. Though mass-produced, this beer is surprisingly flavorful and interesting."
"Mouthfeel is light on this & makes it very drinkable. Alcohol is in the average range so you can easily enjoy a few on a hot summer day. It's mildly refreshing & certainly provides much of the draw to this beer. Overall, I'm not blown away by it but I can see where this would be the quintessential starter for the style. Prosit!!"
"O- Great session brew. Low abv. Complex. Tasty."
"Pours out a very carbonated white frothy head thats about an inch and a half thick. Cloudy golden in color. You can deffinatly smell the lemon and almost a sweetness. Taste is somewhat watery even for a white ale. The lemon deffinatly stands out right away, dries out into the orange peel. The mouthfeel is very carbonated, almost feels like a champaign. Overall an ok beer for those who like a beer they can drink all night long. A beer i would deffinatly recommend if you like white ales."
"I’ve had this before, but I really enjoy this beer. It was even better out of the tap. Perfect for the summer."
"Not a bad witbier at all, and certainly better than the other offerings on tap. I would have preferred more of a flavorful experience, but Hoegaarden is a perfectly serviceable brew and still miles and miles ahead of that adjunct dross that passes for beer at most bars today."
"Food match: I'm gonna put it out there; grilled salmon with a light salad and a fried potato cake... thats right."
"O: A very good witbier. Less spicy and a little sweeter than its American counterparts, but just as tasty and overall better than most witbiers I've tried."
"Hard to evaluate the appearance of a beer in a plastic cup, but it looked run of the mill pale orange with some cloudiness and a decent head. Lemony smell was evident. Beer was crisp and very drinkable with powerful lemony/citrusy flavor for a white beer. I don't generally like to associate beers with seasons -- if it's good, it's good -- but there was something very clearly summery about this one. Would drink it again on a hot day. Very good for its style."
"Pours out a yellowish cloudy body with a creamy white head. The lacing and retention are good on this beer. The nose consists of lemon peel, hay, biscuit, and wheat. The taste starts out with a lemony hops taste along with some spices, pepper, yeast and biscuit. The mouthfeel is a crisp clean smooth finish that makes this a good choice for a summer beer."
"I would drink it again, and of course, i never turn down a free beer :-)"
"O - Ive had this one on several occasions. I think the tulip glass really helped this one out. I don't remember this beer being this good."
"Edit 8/29/11: This version of Hoegaarden is far better on tap, which earns a B+."
"it tasted exactly like one of my least favorite styles, but overall it tasted great, it tasted of lemon grass, citrus, wheat, malt, bread, grainy. the mouthfeel was light to medium which definetely confirmed that this is a summer beer. I have tasted the bottle and on tap and I feel that on tap the beer has less of that wit taste, which i prefer."
"Overall: I enjoyed this one but found it to be lighter in flavor to my two favorite Witbier beers: Allagash White and Southampton Double White Ale. I did like it better than Blue Moon, which I found to be a bit too sweet for my liking. This beer would go perfect on a hot summer day when you're lounging poolside in the backyard and want to have a few."
"Overall: A very tasty and easy drinking white ale. Nicely balanced."
"Overall, an above average white/witbier, much better than most of the Canadian immitators."
" The taste is mild with some good flavors from the wheat which is cereal like -toasted and lightly sweet. There is a mild citrus tinge and hint of pepper from the yeast but overall this is flavored primarily from the wheat which has a nice fresh, clean flavor. The yeast adds to the beer without being to full to make it feel bready which I like. This is a good wit, not the best but it is an originator it has lost some footing to others in this style which I prefer like Allagash. I would not hesitate to drink this, since it is pretty widely available."
"The label is actually pretty cool too. Not sure what it means, but when I was sitting at the bar the lady beside me made a comment about it. (I actually used to see her all the time when I went into Kinko's. She is just a super nice lady!) Anyway, the beer is good. Not too uncommon, as most liquor stores will have it. Bottoms up people because this beer is good to the last drop."
"Overall- Wheat beers aren't my favorite style, but this is a nice approachable wheat. It has a great spicy taste thats a bit different from others. a decent beer. I would consider buying again."
"I've had this beer many times before, and is a favorite of mine in the summer, but never reviewed it until having some at Brewfest tonight. Pours a hazy yellow color with a nice finger head that fizzes to leave little lacing. Smell is wheaty, with some hints of lemon and banana. Taste is a nice mix of malts, some hops, wheat, lemon, and banana. Banana and a nice malty backbone prevail in the finish and serve to give a nice finish. Mouthfeel is light overall. This is one of my favorite witbiers, and a great summer brew."
"O: A refrshing, crisp drinking beer. the flavors a toned down quite a bit, but it has a real nice balance."
"Pours a hazy pale with a bone white, two finger head. As it dissipates it leaves a thin film of froth on the top with just a bit of lacing. Aroma is assertive on the coriander and orange with maybe a bit of lemon and wheat in the background. Flavor is tart and refreshing, orange tartness upfront, coriander mid palate, but a bit of a watery finish. Not much length. Decent medium carbonation. I know that this is supposedly the first Belgian White ale, but something tells me over the years of being bought out by larger companies it has lost something along the way and become a more watered down version of it's original self. But that's just speculation I guess."
"O- A nice, affordable and easily obtainable wit."
"I'd always avoided the white beers, assuming the would be too light to intrigue me, but Hoegaarden opened my eyes and leaves me willing to try some more Witbiers."
"O - how have I not picked this up before??? This really is one of the best hot summer day brews on the planet - Easy drinking yet with plenty of flavor"
"When I poured it into my glass it was a hazy pale yellow and had a frothy white head that disappeared quickly. The first thing to hit my nose was a definite sense of banana and yeast. After another sniff or two I picked up a bit of citrus. The flavor of the beer was in keeping with aroma. It had a great fruity/banana flavor, as well as a prominent yeasty/wheat taste. There was also a light citrus flavor that gave the beer crispness . Combined with a light carbonated body, I found this beer perfect for a hot summer day. I can pick up the spices used in the brewing. Overall I like this beer alot as a whitte beer. great for an afternoon outside relaxing with friends"
"Some breadiness and an lemon is beginning to creep as I continue to sip away, but I'm continued to be underwhelmed. This beer never wowed me, but I remember liking previous bottles in the six pack a lot more. The ""best before"" date is September, 2012, so freshness can't be an issue. Maybe it's just a bad bottle?"
"I usually deal in super strong hop bombers but this beer, for it's genre, is really nice. It almost invites itself over to you next BBQ and jumps into your cooler. ""Drink me! It's 97 degrees outside and I'm refreshing!"""
"if this beer was at domestic prices here in Alberta I'd drink more of it, but at 15+$ a 6er its pricy compared to some Canadian summer offerings"
"Poured on-tap and served in a vase, the beer is a bright, vibrant yellow color with a ton of bubbles and a thin, white, foamy head. Toasty oat aromas, both mild and smooth. The beer was served ice cold, so I had to let it warm up a bit before delving too far into it. The flavor reveals bready and spicy characters, with a bit of nutmeg and cinnamon. Smooth, creamy banana aftertaste, with a finish of crisp and bubbly banana creme. Light and easy to drink."
"Delicious and refreshing, I don't think I would ever turn a Hoegaarden down. I have had this before and will almost definitely have it again. I don't buy this regularly, but only because a) it's expensive and b) I'm not always in the mood for spiciness in my beer... when I am in the mood for a witbier though, this is the default option."
"Wow, this is different! My first Witbier... Looks like lemonade with a nice head that dissipates quickly. Carbonation is adequate. Smell is orange and lemon citrus. Taste is refreshing citrus...you really taste the corriander. Slightly creamy. Pleasantly refreshing, is very good with an orange slice. Great summer brew for hot weather! I would buy this one again. Glad I took my co-workers recommendation on this one!"
"O - If its available it is certainly worth drinking. But would like more from a belgian beer, and not my preferred witbier."
"I followed the directions on the back label as to how to pour this beer and my finger of fluffy bone-white head seemed to evaporate! Color was a deeply hazy lemon-yellow, like fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice. Nose had all of the attendant spiciness, referred to on the label as ""a subtle hint of coriander and orange peel."" Subtle like a sledgehammer between the eyes! For the uninitiated, the yeast gives it a pleasant mustiness, but the black pepper and orange zest are also prevalent on the nose. Mouthfeel seemed kind of thin and it had a nice interplay of the wheat and spices on the tongue, somewhat zesty and refreshing. Finish was semi-dry with the coriander really lingering in the back of the mouth. It was drinkable, but I am not a raving fan."
"Well, it's a classic. The flavors could be a little stronger and more complex, but there's little to complain about here. It's tasty and refreshing and great for a hot summer day. If you're not looking for much more than a solid, quenching beer, then look no further. Recommended."
"I look forward to my next pint!"
"Overall an average beer. Not horrible, I'd drink it again if no better options are available...but nothing to write home about. Typical, if underachieving, whit beer."
"D: This is a beer with a lot of flavor and a lot going on."
"D- This is a beer with a lot of flavor but not overly draining. Its a nice change from hoppiness to the fruitiness for a beer and is fitting for the style (not surprisingly)."
"Hoegaarden is a real joy to look at and to drink. It is cloudy pale in colour. The smell is sweet malt, citrus with some yeasty notes in the background. Quite a flowery taste, nectar and peppery notes with a malty sweetness. Smooth as silk aftertaste and mouthfeel. Low hop flavour. I would recommend trying it with a slice of lemon. I think it is one of the best"
"decent beer but the flavors are so light that it almost misses drinkable and enters into the land of bland."
"R.I.P. Pierre Celis."
"Great drink-ability... Definitely."
"O: I think there are better wit's out there, but this is an excellent standard to judge them by."
"D- 4 All in all, a solid offering and a standby due to its high availability, Hoegaarden is a classic of the style and should at least be tried by all. Though not supremely complex, it boasts good flavor and it is definitely consistent. It is not so heavy and I could put down this brew with ease. It's not my favorite style, but when in the mood it is a good one to fall back on."
"O: ...OK, why does this have a B+ rating? This is definitely a below-average representative of the style."
"Overall: I give it 4 - good!"
"Overall: This is a very refreshing beer, it's tasty and goes down easy. Definitely worth keeping in mind and definitely worth trying."
"O: This is like the prototypical witbier but with the orange peel and coriander aspects emphasized."
"Nice fizzy, hazy yellow with a thin white head, creamy walls of lace and descent retention for the style. Light, crisp, refreshing body. Nice fizzy carbonation with a lemon pepper aroma and hints of citrus, orange, and spice. Black pepper notes on the front with some light grainy malt backbone. Lemon and orange with an earthy, herbal zest. Overall very refreshing and easy to drink beer."
"I really enjoyed this beer. One of my favorites. It is a lighter beer. The beer had a very nice blend of spices that you can definetly tell are present, but not too over-powering. They give the beer a great flavor, and help it to finish nice and crisp with no unpleasant aftertast whatsoever. Also tried in a bottle. The spices in the bottle are a little more prominent, but still a great drink. I'd would say the beer is slightly better on tap when compared to the bottle version."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Dr: Priced fairly by Irish standards, but not a fantastic beer."
"A nice wit, that I guess is the standard for witbiers. If you're a Blue Moon drinker, try this instead, because it's better. Pour a hazy, pale yellow with a nice white head that retains rather well. Light wheat aroma with citrus notes. Light orange and lemon zest taste, with smooth bready malts that are somewhat overcome by the general wheat beer harshness; acidic, with a bitter aftertaste. Light body and easily drinkable."
"O: Overall, this is a can't miss classic when I'm in the mood for a witbier. Although Allagash white is maybe a bit more refined, I find this much zestier, and more flavorful in general. This beer is extremely refreshing and is a summer classic. As much as I find myself skeptical of it sometimes on the shelves, it never fails to satisfy. And at 8.39 a 6 pack here (compared to 9.99 for an Allagash 4 pack) I can't fight purchasing."
"I'm really writing this review because the last few Hoegaardens I've had (all from bottle, all poured into hexagonal Hoegaarden glass) have really hammered home that this is an ABInbev product. This makes me sad because Hoegaarden was one of the first beers I ever really liked. I feel that its quality has dropped off since I first had it in 2006. In particular, it now has that special distinction common to mass-produced beer: it when slightly warmed, it has a chalky, artificial taste that makes it drinkable only when very cold. Overall, I still very much appreciate the seasonings added to this beer, but something has gone wrong here with the wheat, yeast, hops, or fermentation, and I see myself heavily, heavily favoring beers like Allagash White over Hoegaarden going forward."
"A terrific summer beer!"
"Refreshing and very easy to drink, it’s a common beer that should be in the fridge of every household."
"Hoegaarden pours a hazy straw color. My first thought was that it looked like a very cloudy glass of lemonade. A solid three fingers of frothy white foam top the beer and come up to the rim of the glass, before slowly creeping back down towards the body of the beer. Lacing is a bit spotty. The nose is surprisingly coriander forward, but has a solid orange-citrus presence as well. Finally there's a touch of sweetness from the wheat to complete the picture. Everything that should be here is, but for my money the proportions and ratios are just a little bit off. If the nose is just a little bit out of whack, the flavor takes that imbalance a little bit further. It's not quite like what I'd imagine downing a bag of crushed coriander would be like, but it's approaching that territory. It takes me a few sips to make it past that and enjoy the small citrus flourish that's present as well. There's no real support from wheat or any other malt to rein things in either. The unquestioned bright spot here is the picturesque light body and active carbonation full of small, precise bubbles. I don't recall the draft pours of Hoegaarden I've had seeming so aggressively coriander dominant, but I don't think I'll be reaching for a bottle of this any time soon."
"Overall: I have a soft spot for this beer. This is my favorite of the widely commercially available whites, and is an incredibly pleasant yet subtly flavorful drink. Well recommended."
"O: You could have many of these and be satisfied. It has big flavour but does not fill you up like other wheat-beers can."
"A beer for everyone!"
"I loved this beer. This beer belongs next to your steak grilled outdoors on a cool summer day."
"O – I haven’t had a Hoegaarden in years, and this glass was much better than I remembered the beer being. Maybe my taste evolved, maybe the recipe changed, or it maybe it's just an extra-fresh tap. Either way, I definitely enjoyed it."
"Very sessionable"
"Pours a nice one finger head, looks very frothy, maybe even creamy. The head is completely white and the body is a hazy, clearish-yellow color. It's a very very VERY weird body, it looks like carbonated lemonade, I mean its cloudy, but at the same time it's see through, it's like see through for only so long, and then the cloudiness kicks in. It has hues of orange, but when you hold it up to the light it looks way more yellow. The head is also interesting, it reminds me of what the top of a mocha or latte would look like, so that's good, because it looks creamy! Overall it looks super weird, but pretty good, and the head is still hanging around a little bit. This bee also has a very unique smell, I don't think I've ever smelled something as unique as this, it's just bursting with citrus. There is clearly citrus, oranges, probably lemons, and definitely coriander. All the citruses are there, and they are pretty recognizable, but they smell a lot different than say a blue moon or something else that uses the same ingredients, maybe they use more of them, or just better quality, not sure which, but it smells really good and really unique. It also smell really clean, super clean and probably really refreshing, overall a very nice aroma. Very tasty, I don't know if it deserves a 4 for taste, but either way it is super tasty and super unique. On some sips there isn't much flavor, but on others it's just bursting with flavor, you get all the flavors that were indicated on the smell, orange, lemon, coriander. Not much in the way of hops, a tiny bit of malts, but who really cares when this beer is so tasty! The only reason I don't want to give this a 4 is because it is a little light and watery at times. It's super tasty, but I just don't think it deserves a 4. Mouthfeel is decent, nothing too outstanding there. Drinkability is pretty good, I mean it's a belgian white, so it's not going to be hard to put away. Overall the two things that impressed me about this beer is how unique it is and how well the smell represented the taste. Pretty damn good beer overall, not perfect, and not an outstanding beer, but a good beer that I have very little to complain about."
"Overall: Good place to start for wits, but maybe not the be-all end-all. Again, maybe I need to find a fresher batch and re-review, but I wasn't terribly impressed by this. Or maybe wheat beers just aren't my thing, as I'm discovering. It's worth a try, but it's not fantastic."
"O - I still love the hell out of this beer. Its a solid choice in its category. I could drink this every day, all day."
"The beer was a light hazy yellow with a bubbly white head that receded quickly. The smell has banana/ bubblegum aroma, with lemon and wheat. The taste is similar with the banana and bubblegum, I also tasted orange peel, wheat and grassy hops. The feel is light with soft carbonation and a dry finish. I really enjoyed this beer, I could drink this on any occasion."
"-Beer distributor 15th and Federal, Philly PA"
"D: Very drinkable. The standard of the style."
"O: The most average witbier available. the most widely available witbier (okay, maybe blue moon wins)."
"RIP Pierre, thank you for keeping this beer and the style alive."
"M - Extremely drinkable and perfectly carbonated. Just a little thin for my tastes."
"OK, I've tried Hoegaarden a few times and this bottle is not the best. I don't know if it's old or what, but I'm going to skew this review slightly because usually it's great. It has a really different color than most beers, kind of like a cream soda life saver, white with some yellow for those who haven't had that particular lifesaver. Anyway, it is hazy which is befitting of it's style. The smell is very original too, kind of fruity, but I couldn't tell you the fruit. Maybe grapefruit, or some kind of grapes. I think the taste is great! It's got alot of body from the wheat, with a tart finish on the tongue. Just the right amount of carbonation too."
"Taste is clean and on the crisper, more refreshing side for a wheat beer. Definitely not very hoppy or malty, just clean and full of wheat taste. Fizzy in the finish. It's not a great beer but definitely better than your average beer found at your average bar, and it's definitely refreshing. Availability also lifts this beer up in my mind since not a whole lot of beers like this are extremely popular. The fact that it can be found in a lot of bars and nearly always on liquor beer shelves is good for those looking to broaden their beer horizons."
"This beer was one of the first Wit beers I ever had. Purchased a bottle of it at the Laystone Pub in Bethlehem PA back in 2007. This beer was a hazy yellow with a bright white head. The beer smells very refreshing and citrusy. The beer was served with a lemon which I tried it without it first. It wasn't much better with or without. The mouthfeel is light and the beer is great for sometime."
"O: Once of my favortie whitbiers for its crisp cleanliness."
"Final Notes: A solid wheat beer. I'll be returning to it in the future."
"Poured into a Radeberger glass with a very hazy pale yellow and a big head that recedes to a small corner molding where the beer meets the glass. Smells a little sour, with lemon-y hop character and a phenolic yeast smell. Seems to be a little less character in the taste than the smell, just a grainy addition with a little dryness. Very easy drinking."
"Note: scores are given after tasting by memory"
"o: I have been a fan of Hoegaarden a long time, it's nothing too crazy, but is absolutely delicious, refreshing, and easy to drink. If someone asked what my go-to summer beer was, I'd probably tell them Hoegaarden. It's not the best witbier, but it's simple, kinda cheap, and readily available."
"When I first tried this a few years ago it really blew me away but these days not so much. Not sure if it's me or the brew that has changed."
"It's not as flavorful as I expected. It's pretty good beer, highly drinkable, very refreshing and it's a nice warm weather beer."
"Quite a nice witbier with good flavors and character."
"Overall - Unique and refreshing, I could really get into a couple of these on a hot summer night."
"Decent beer, decent drinkability. I'm personally undecided on how much I like the spices, but far from an unpleasant beer. Rather good in fact."
" The smell was the nicest thing I can say about this beer and even that didnt jump out at me!"
"The appearance of this beer is bar none. It is the typical cloudy wheat yellow beer. The smell of this beer is great with orange peel and corriander stereortypical of most other wheat beers. This beer usually comes with the perfect mount of head. If pouring this from a bottle use the instructions found on the side of the bottle stating how to pour the last 1/8 of the bottle into your glass after rolling it on its side. The mouthfeel is descent. Incredible drinkability. In Rome my friends and I used to have a bar in Campo De Fiori that we called the Hoegarrden Bar as it would serve incredibly sized drafts of this delicious nector for only five euros. This was a steal at the time in 2005 as most other drafts, including american imports were at least 5 euros as well."
"Drinkability: Pretty satisfying. Seems like a good summer afternoon beer to me."
"Poured a hazy pale yellow with an average sized white fizzy head that was mostly diminishing and had good lacing. The aroma was heavy with a leathery yeast scent, light flowery hops with notes of orange and allspice. It tasted quite yeasty with a mild acidic flavor at first and finished about the same except for the hints of orange on the tongue left , to linger for a nice while. Mouthfeel was light to medium in body and was suprisingly very creamy in texture. Overall a very tasty wheat beer, definitley worth drinking a few."
"Good Belgian beer. I know its widely available and that might make it seem to mainstream for many BA's but this is a good example of the style."
"D - Lacks a lot of bite; this was one of my first experiences with foreign-made Witbier many years ago; it was good for the time I had it until I came across beers from other craft brewers; with that being said, I still would not turn down this beer if it was offered to me and I would definitely have another"
"This poured a cloudy white with nice bubbly, foamy head. The smells is mild yeast, maybe some sweet banana like presence. The taste is sweet with mild banana, coriander, and wheat. The body is very smooth, making this very easy drinking. This is a pleasant change from the usual IPA. I could have another."
"Overall- Pleasant summery drink. One of the first true imports I ever had."
"There is a good beer trying to get out."
"This is an average beer, a nice, pleasing and refreshing drink, but with not much to say"
"D- This beer is a wonderful example of the style. The ABV is low which helps add to the drinkability. Crisp and refreshing which helps invite you back into the pint."
"D - Well i felt alright with this one if anyone offer me this as a drink"
"Overall, a good beer to have with a light meal."
"I've had a lot of wit beers lately and it's interesting how none of them are much like this, the original. A very interesting brew with big flavor and easy to drink."
"Appearance is a very light straw, and cloudy. Almost looks like a glass of lemonade. Pours with a thick and very pure-white head. Very little lacing is left on the glass while drinking. I'll give it an extra half-point on appearance for the unique shape of the bottle and classy label. Tastes of orange, lemon, and coriander are present but subtle, with a touch of hop bitterness at the end. Very crisp and refreshing. I really enjoyed this one."
"Hoegaarden is in my opinion the number 1 go to beer to persuade people to start trying different beer. It's foreign, tasty, nice to look at, and readily available. With it's all season taste and look, sexy lookin' bottle and funny name, this has become a favorite of mine, and a beer I'll be drinking till the day I die."
"Had this one for the first time at a friend's house yesterday. Poured a hazy, cloudy pale yellow color, with a generous, rocky white head. Aromas of lemon zest, fresh citrus and bread dough. Crisp, light bodied and refreshing, with more citrus and bread dough on the palate."
"Drink - This was a really refreshing beer that would be ideal for the summer months. It is very clean and crisp and would make an ideal session beer."
"D - This is a refreshing beverage with a little more character than your typical light-bodied beer."
"Overall, this was a nice light beer. I was definitely not expecting this beer to be that great and I have to say that I'm impressed. I'll be buying this one again."
"D - Drinkability is where this beer really shines. It's a great starter beer for people who are used to drinking American Adjuncts. It offers complexity without being overwhelming to unexperienced drinkers."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its roundedness. The pour revealed a simplistic looking brew, with a straightforward aroma, and a light, and crisp taste. While it is not exemplary for the style, this brew served its purpose and quenched our thirst."
"."
"A good witbier that would be best enjoyed on a hot day...goes down easily and has an agreeable aftertaste. I will definately have this beer again.."
"The best place to experience a Hoegaarden is on the Grand-Place in Brussels, served in the Hoegaarden glass, of course, as is the custom in Belgian bars. One look at this unique fluid, and you will understand why it is called a ""white beer"". Hoegaarden has a unique head, and translucent whiteness to its coloration. The flavor is another worldly experience as well. Very light, smooth and refreshing. Be warned, it is less like beer than a drink all its own. A must try beverage."
"DRinkability - Actually had a hard time drinking it. This is one I would like to try again while outdoor in the dead heat of summer. Everything about it screamed light and highly drinkable, but not appropriate with spicy food."
"Overall - I'm not a big fan of Belgian Whites. I mistakenly bought a single of this to sample in haste without reading the style (I thought I grabbed a Belgian Pale Ale). If you like easy to drink Belgian White's I'm sure you'll enjoy this one. Just ok for me though, not being a big fan of this style."
"Drinkability: Goes down very easy, like a good witbier should. Would be good on a steamy summer afternoon."
"D - Very drinkable as all wheat beers should aim to be. A perfect session beer for the Summer. Perfect abv and great flavour."
"Yeah, Hoo-gaarden is verrry drinkable. Excellent taste and balanced nicely in spite of the zealous infection of coriander. There are better - few more solid all-around."
"d- very easy to drink, one of my favorites to drink casually"
"This is a solid beer that you can find just about anywhere in bottles. There are some wits I like more but this is nice."
"def. a session beer....i could drink these all summers day long"
"Awesome session beer - probably my favorite. A classic."
"M, D- Looking for drinkability? This is the exemplar of drinkability. Don't start on these if you are too thirsty, or one may be likely to overindulge quite easily. Hoegaarden offers wonderful flavors and aromas for its weight, making for the perfect warm weather beer. It is a lightweight champ in that regard; but that description sounds masculine, and this beer really has a sweet, beautiful, feminine personality."
"Note: from the can this seemed somewhat flatter and weaker in taste than the Hoegaarden I'd had on tap before."
"Drinkability- Very easy to drink, love this beer. Always have it for my wife or father-in-law, decided to review it. Easy to find but like franziskaner better."
"Overall: A really nice beer, goes down very smooth and refreshing, like a nice summer afternoon. Definitely would recommend this and will pick it up again sometime."
"As a reformed beer-hater, a result of realizing there's more than the mainstream gag-worthy carbonated-pee out there, this is only the second lager I've ever reviewed. Probably a good reference point for me, in venturing past my ""safe zone"" of dark craft beers. While there were no dominant flavours of citrus and or coriander, this subtle, refreshing, yet creamy beer is the smoothest and most drinkable of its type that I know of. Perfectly balanced. Not even a hint of sourness as many other white/pale/wheat ales go. The aroma was cologne-grade pretty, of subtle citrus, with no metallic or glassy smell. Cute, innocuous-looking label perfectly reflects the contents. Surprisingly filling! A must-try."
"D-What a nice summertime beer this makes. Light,lemony refreshing and low ABV make this one of the better wheat ales."
"Verdict: One of the most interesting things about this beer is the spice kick on the end, which grows in intensity further into the drink, with big sips and as the beer warms. I guess this must be the coriander which is really interesting and enjoyable. It's almost like a holiday spice. This beer should sit well with a large portion of the drinker's crowd, old and new to the game. It's a lighter bodied drink than the average beer, but the flavor is wonderful and full of surprises. You won't regret the purchase. A- (4.05)"
"Being a home-brewer, you see a lot of spices in beer, and acquire a smell for fermenting yeast and sediment. This beer is great. Think Blue Moon without the citrus. This leaves so many meal-paring possibilities. As one fella, said salty foods would be amazing with this. Eye-catching color with a great carbonated mouthfeel will want you begging for more. No wonder why InBev bought it(Such a shame). A Belgium Standard."
"The appearance is just what I look for in a witbier, nice and unfiltered, very light straw color with a decent head on it. The scent is very citrus with lots of wheat. You taste the yeast, citrus and spices very well. I think this is a very tasty and easy drinking beer. It is a go to beer for me, inexpensive with a lot of flavor. Great for a hot summer day."
"D- Good brew, kind of filling, but always a good choice. Better out of tap than the bottle imo."
"I could have another but I'd probably want something better. This is a good introductory beer for this style I think."
"Would be good with some salted pistachios."
"Hoegaarden Witbier was a cloudy yellow-white color. It had a fluffy white head with good retention and lacing. The smell was wheat, yeast aromas, and spices. The taste was wheat, citrus fruits, and spice with a nice dry finish. It was medium-light in body with plenty of carbonation. Drinkability was good. This is a nice Witbier and worth trying."
"A good beer to have with a friend who isn't a fan of strong tasting beer, or to share with lady-friend - It seems to be (from my own experience) that beer female beer drinkers all have good things to say about this beer in general."
"D: Full of flavor, yet still light and refreshing. Combine that with a modest ABV, and you get exceptional drinkability. This beer is great year around"
"Overall, a very enjoyable and refreshing beer."
"This beer could become an ""old standby."" Its easy drinkability, and great taste are superb, lots of citrus and hops, but not too tangy or sweet. And talk about head, it's one of the best heads around! If you want a white beer, that's really smooth, this one is probably for you."
"O: One of my favorite session beers."
"D - Outstanding sessional beer, looking for solid Summer beer (look no further), and also fine for getting new beer lovers to try something not BMC."
"D - VERY drinkable, and quite refreshing. Like some other reviewers, this was my first ""good"" beer, and lead me into a quest for better beers. Still one of my favorites."
"Overall, a very good beer, especially for one where you want something toward the clarity of a nice glass of water"
"Pours hazy straw with a huge, foamy, white head. Aroma of orange fruit, bready yeast with hints of spices. Light, smooth, sweet body. Flavor of yeast, sweet malt, fruit and some spices. Finish is medium, sweet in the beginning, finally becomes dry. Just not my type of beverage."
"Appearance is cloudy pale yellow-tan nice thich pure white head about 2 fingers tall. Smells scrumptious with yeast and breads. Tastes refreshing and fantastic! I cant get over the color of this beer and the pure white conistent froth at the top, it just doesnt go away. Fruity citrus sweet undertone taste. Beautiful well rounded wietbier. I can drink these all day long."
"D- A fantastic beer overall, one of the nicest I think I have ever tasted."
"It's worth noting that I've had both better Hoegaarden's and worse ones, both straight out of Belgium as well. What's up with that?"
"I bought it a fortnight ago in the Netherlands, but it's still amazing. (I haven't kept it in the fridge). I recommend it to everyone who wants to enjoy a great 'Witbier'. Perhaps it's worth trying it with a slice of orange as well."
"This brew is very easy to drink. Easily a session for beer, for those who like wheat beers. It goes down smooth and creamy. Again, I have had better witbiers, but this is always a solid brew to have when available."
"This is a tasty brew for sure and at 4.9% ABV, the alcohol is fairly in check. Personally the coriander is a bit overbearing for me to want to put more than a couple of these back in a sitting. However, these are quite refreshing and full flavored and worth treating yourself to from time to time."
"D - Very drinkable. First had this beer five years ago. This is the beer that made me discover better beer. It was so different than any else I'd drank at that time. It's among my favourite wheat beers today."
"Easy drinking, though it would probably be better on a summer day rather than looking out at bare trees with threatening clouds overhead."
"YES ! Good beer. One of my favourite beer here in Singapore and I guess you can find it everywhere in the world since InBev bought the company years ago. Best wheat beer, even better than Erdinger in my opinion."
"This is an ok beer, but personally i find it a bit dull"
"Pours a very hazy pale yellow color with a 2-finger white head that had decent retention. The head fell down to a nice little ring at the top of the beer, and left no lacing. Smelled spicy, and of citrus, oranges, and wheat. Tastes of spicy notes from the yeast, citrus, orange zest, wheat, and a little hop presence. Mouthfeel is good. Good carbonation, a light-medium body, and goes down smooth. Sort of feels bubbly. Its a very drinkable beer. Goes down very easy and leaves you wanting another. Good thing I have a few more. Cheers."
"extremely drinkable -"
"Overall, a solid beer and a pleasure to drink."
"No bold flavors here; subtle, balanced, and very refreshing."
"Poured this pale yellow, cloudy, and very active beer in my glass, and it produced the biggest head of any beer in my recollection. The head was better than three fingers of a very rich foam. I has taken about five minutes and there is still head. The beer color is a 3 on the SRM chart. Smells like lemon, wheat, and yeast. Tastes more like potatoes with garlic, lemon, pepper, and wet wheat. About a mouthful of mouthfeel. Heavy body, almost can chew it. Very different flavor, it grows on your taste buds. Will have to keep a look out for this on the beer menu."
"D - A nice drink for the hot days. Subtle flavors. It is not a personal favorite of mine, but it is supposedly the ""original Belgian Witbier"". How can you not like the original?"
"D-A good but not great ""wheat"" beer. Glad to have tried, but not something I will purchase in future."
"Flavor improves as well yet seems somewhat artificial. More orange than lemon, slightly sweet and viscous for the style. A good carbonation supports the feel reasonably well. A bit of a spin brings back a cap of foam and a myriad of smells. Finish is short with a bit of lemon bread. Decent drinkability though nothing special and the spices seem a bit overdone. These delicate beers seem best from the bottle indeed."
"D - The flavors in this beer are not such that I'd want to drink multiples at a time. The spices and citrus are strong and a little overbearing on the palate. But I'm sure this would be a great ""by the pool"" refreshment on a hot summer day!"
"Easy drinking Wheat ale that would go down well on any warm summer day!"
"Pours a very cloudy yellow color with a nice white head and quite a bit of lacing. Nose brings forward some citrus and a bit of wheat. The taste is orange, citrus, slight spice, wheat, and a bit of grain. Definitely a fairly light mouthfeel with a bit of creaminess. Drinks fairly well, although not super flavorful."
"Pours a very hazy golden yellow with a thick white head and superb lacing. Smells of coriander, oranges, grapefruit, pepper and wheat. Tastes of coriander, orange peel, pepper, wheat, malts and tasty hops. Mouthfeel is medium with a nice carbonation. Drinkability is very good. The beer is an excellent selection."
"D: Another one of those really well known beers that everybody sort of has to try somewhere along the way. I haven't had this beer for a long time, but I did not find it did much for me on this occasion."
"Drinkability is great until you finish your first two pints. After that you need a nap. Definitley needs an orange slice."
" Very cheap, only eight for a sixer and twice that for a twelve. Add an orange and throw one to your old lady because its that easy to like. Sláinte."
"D:Was a true enjoyment. Very recommended would love to try on tap."
"Drinkability: I have a hard time putting this down for some reason, there might be just a bit too much coriander to make this very drinkable, it hits all the right tickmarks otherwise."
"(Reviewed August 2, 2010.)"
"Notes: I've given this beer so many chances and really want to like it but it just isn't that good. It is very watery and has no real backbone to it. The malt character is completely overpowered by the yeast leaving it very empty tasting."
"Cheers!!"
"Goes down way easy, but not in a good way."
"D - Easy to drink, flavours are nicely balanced with a good mix of sweet and tart."
"Decent beer with a distinct taste. Appears banana yellow in color with a two finger head. Smells of spice and clove. Taste is unique with clove and spice, crisp and easy on the palate. Not the best of its kind, but a good showing. Would drink as a session or with a meal."
"Hoegaarden poured a bright yellow color wth a large head. Strong wheat smell, with a strong spicey note. The taste was very traditional of this style, a bit stronger wheat taste, weaker spicey; a blue moon with flavor. Very easy to drink; not the stongest flavors. Overall pretty good not the best very refresing for an unusally very hot autumn day."
"Pours a completely cloudy straw color with a HUGE white head. Scent is extremely bold with tons of spices, clove, and banana. This beer is so unique. The perfect ""white beer"". Scent is just so lovely....it makes you wonder why beers like Blue Moon and Shock Top even exist. The taste is so well balanced...this beer is a perfect session beer. Great fruitiness along with sweet spices...as well as nice yeasty notes that just make this beer an amazing brew. Mouthfeel is great and drinkability is incredible."
"PS, Whole Foods caries cases!!!"
"D- At first, this comes across as a potent flavored brew and might be hard to want a bunch, but after getting about halfway through my sampling here, it gets much mellower as it warms up a bit. It is refreshing and would really cut through a spicy Asian dish well. On it's own this makes a really nice hot weather brew."
"drinkability; definatly a drinkable beer, tasty but not so good that it would be a disservice to the beer to drink in quantity and lose flavor."
"Drinkability is ok, on the side of wheat beers where I don't really like to have more than one. Overall well done, just not my beer."
"Pours out a hazy lemon/limeade. Clean white head tops this bier and settles to a thin creamy lace. Light and refreshing. Wheat and light corriander with slightest hind of citrus. A very nice faint tart at the finish is wonderful. Very drinkable/sessionsable."
"Overall, a great and authentic representation of a Belgian white. Not as good as St. Bernardus, but damn better than most American whites I have had."
"The mouthfeel is on the thin side and it isn't very pleasant to drink. Good to try once but I won't be coming back."
"D-Can drink this stuff for hours on end"
"I've probably consumed about 150 bottles/glasses of this over the past 5-6 years. One of my favorite beer experiences ever was pounding like two cold bottles of this after playing tennis for two hours with no water. Spices, yeast, fresh wheat balanced very nicely here. Awesome hot weather beer. Fantastic for what it is and what it's supposed to be."
"Really nice beer, but nothing for everyday drinking."
"Drinkability - Due to the taste of this and its low abv I could drink these all night."
"very light in color beer. taste is exceptional hints of citrus and if poured correctly has a very white light foamy head. Wonderful beer on hot day as it is not a heavy beer but is heavy on flavor. Has become one of my favorite beers. Am looking forward to trying this on tap at the Alehouse here in New Braunfels."
"Wonderful beer."
"Great beer. Belgium knows how to do it right."
"O: Classic Belgium Witbier. The spicy and citrus smell and palate makes it a delicious and refreshing option for hot summer days..."
"Delicate aroma; flavorful taste with a hint of coriander and orange. One of the few beers I enjoy ice-cold. I once found a recipe online to make Hoegaarden ice-cream, so I did. If you're a fan of this beer, I strongly suggest you try making it. You'll always find a six pack of Hoegaarden in my fridge."
"my all time favorite beer I never get tired of enjoying a cold pint at my favorite spot. The color, taste and smell are excellent the subtle hint of orange and the floral noes really match perfectly. I enjoy this beer so much I can tell when the keg is almost empty or fresh!"
"Overall, I didn't like this beer very much. I had higher expectations for it than what it turned out to be. Probably wouldn't go for another."
"D: I can't argue with the name ""orginal"" white ale. This has all the components of a great witbier, even if it is lacking that special something. It's extremely refreshing and a great choice for craft beer beginners."
"Overall: Very nice beer for a hot summer afternoon very fruity in flavor that goes down very smooth and allow multiples intakes, the go to beer of my wife; a little watery for my taste. Will have again with no problem."
"D: Meh. Not great, but not extremely off putting. One of the better option at the bar though."
"A good example of a Witbier. Easy to drink and flavorful."
"d: easy to drink lots of these period"
"Cheers!"
"RJT"
"."
"D - This is such a delicious and pleasant beer, if simple. Highly drinkable, one of my go-to favorites in the wit style. Session beer for sure."
"Served from bottle into Lindemans pilsner. Pours an opaque pale pale yellow with a three finger pure white head that subsides to none quickly. There was no apparent lacing present. The aroma was comprised of malt, fruit, citrus, wheat, and grains. The flavor was of wheat, bananas, malt, and grain. It was light on the palate with low carbonation. Overall it goes down very smooth. This might have been due to the lackluster intensity of the flavors and aroma present. I have had this brew quite awhile back when I first started into craft beer and have just now gotten a chance to have it again for a review. This is a good starter beer for people just getting into craft brew, but not overly good for its style. Just needs a little more 'oomph'."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable on a hot day. I had this before during a baseball game and thought it was pretty good in the bottle. In the glass it's still very drinkable and it quenches the thirst very well. Went well with a meal then (burger) and now (asiago and orzo chicken) and I wouldn't mind having another one. Despite the weakness of the flavor it's still very refreshing."
"D- Pretty easy to drink just not my favorite."
"The beer is a slightly cloudy and very light yellow color, with a thin white head that fades quickly and leaves a thin lace on the glass. The aroma is very lemony along with some wheat and a little bit of hops and spice. Flavors of lemon and wheat dominate the taste, but the flavors aren't over powering. There's some clove spice mixed in and a faint bit of hops in the background. After-taste is mildly bready with a touch of sweetness. Crisp and very smooth, light-to-medium body, medium-to-heavy carbonation, finish is clean."
"D: Very drinkable. Very refreshing. An excellent session beer."
"taste is interesting very nice fruit clove combo.. a little on the watery side -i would like the full promise of the flavor to be realized in the body.. but nice overall- it starts out big but finishes rather thin.. i guess that makes it highly drinkable.. in fact it is very refreshing."
"D- this is a drinkable beer, and could see myself having a few of these. There are better Witbiers out there, but this is a nice basis."
"Drinkability - Never again. If you are a fan of the clovey, witbiers I am sure you can find a better choice. Though I admit that it takes a really superb one to win me over, as it is not my favorite style of beer."
"The taste is sour-sweet, like a lemonade with some hops and some spices. All in all, it has good, complex flavours, but it will never be one of my all time favourite beers. By some margin."
"Looks like pineapple juice with a solid two fingers of perfectly white head. Pretty much how I think a White Ale should look. Musty aroma with hints of sulfur and spice. Somewhat thin in the body department. The wheaty citrus notes and a hint of banana are better expressed in the taste. Hoegaarden is quite refreshing and with a quick finish, you are ready for more, unless you hate it..."
"Extremely pale straw colored beer with big foamy head which subsides rapidly leaving some lacing. Smell is of bready yeast, some light pepperiness, mild phenols and maybe some light grapefruit. Taste is just average IMO pale malt upfront followed by yeast and rounded out by a spicy finish. Mouthfeel is just above average as well. This beer lack some of the body that its fellow witbiers have. Good carbonation combined with light refreshing taste and moderate body make this beer very drinkable. While this beer certainly isn't bad I won't be getting it again."
"Bought this at a Czech grocery store for $1.50. Pours out of a 33cl bottle a cloudy straw color, with a small white head that dissipates pretty quickly leaving little lacing. The nose is strong lemon and bubble gum. The taste is similar. Refreshing and tasty, not a bad wheat beer."
"Poured an 11.2 bottle into a Chimay glass (my usual). Decent head and good appearance. Somewhat cloudy, light golden color. A pleasant tasting belgian beer for not much more than a good American beer. Plenty of value. I consider this one of my staple beers."
"This beer is a leader in this style. It's unmatched in balance and spice. Don't pass this beer up. I've had this beer in Europe (not Belgium) and it's just as good as I tasted it it in America. I drank alot of Hoegaarden in Europe. The beer that I did this review with is from a Oklahoma Liquor store. It's just as good as the beer I had in Europe."
"A nice, simple witbier. Not hugely complex, but tasty and refreshing. A very nice summer beer."
"Good white ale. Actually, one of my standbys.... This beer is great with food, especially rich food. I love it with strong german and french cheese, knocks your socks off. It is light in color and really taste as well. It is a good beer to keep cold and ready to go. Citrus flavor and good body."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Even though this brew is distributed from InBev it's hard to turn your back on it."
"Hoegaarden Wietbier has a calm appearance with a very pale yellow tone. It pours nicely and then head is thick. The aroma is a subtle orange. On the palette, the bouquet opens up and a nice combination of spice and orange is revealed. The texture overall is smooth and light. This wietbier is quite drinkable especially during the summer."
"If you like this style beer and come across this beer on tap, do give it a try."
"Edit: after some more ""research", I did find one six-pack that tasted different. It was a bit stale tasting or like it had been frozen and thawed or something. It wasn't as bright and clean tasting as it should have been. If that was the first hoegaarden I had experienced I would not have bought another six-pack. The next set though from the same store at the same time was great. Not sure what happened but reading a few bad reviews among many good reviews tells me there are possibly some quality control issues with this beer. 5/6 good six-packs for me so far."
"12oz bottle into chilled pint glass,great summer brew,refreshing,appearance beautifullight golden color,nice banana,spice, nose;taste is refreshing &satisfying,belgian beers are always top notch in quality,for the style(witbier) definitley above avg. recommended..."
"Drinkability - Excellent summer beer"
"D: I think that the beer is one that represents the style and does so quite well. A beer that I find easy to drink and could go for more than just one."
"D - Drinks well, lighter drinks are not typically my style but I enjoy this enough to purchase more"
"Really good example of the style; however, much better wit's are to be had, but not as cheap as Inbev's Wit."
"D- An example why imports are over rated. basically a cheap version vanilla version of blue moon. I wasted 40 bucks on 11.2 oz bottles of cheap crap!"
"D-after having St. Bern Wit it's hard to compare or judge higher, but Hoegaarden is a decent and classic version of this style; well-priced, widely available and super refreshing (especially in the past week in the Mid-Atlantic)"
"D: Very drinkable and whenever on tap hot days it just seems right to order this one."
"Very drinkable. Not in the same league as Allagash White in my opinion but a pretty solid authentic witbier. Went nicely with my girlfriend's lemon spinach tortellini soup."
"D: This is a great summer beer that is quite tasty on tap."
"Bottle poured into a weizen glass. Best by date is 23/03/11. One and a half inches of frothy, white head initially forms but quickly settles. No lacing. Color is cloudy, pale yellow, like lemonade almost. Wheat, yeast and notes of citrus and honey on the nose. Sweet floral characteristics as well. The palate shows the same, but with a hint of coriander and a light yeasty finish. Very light bodied with nice carbonation. Very easy to drink. A great session/summer beer."
"Bottle. Aroma like rotting citrus. This an is excellent description provided by a non-beer drinker (my wife). Having owned several citrus trees myself, this description is dead on. It is not an unpleasant aroma, but distinctive. Appearance similar grapefruit juice. Foamy head that dissipates within two minutes. Taste is typical but watery. Feel is creamy and a little oily. Aftertaste is a flat and unpleasant. I really wanted to like this beer because it is readily available in this area. With each bottle over several sittings I liked it less. Might have been an old bottle, because I know several folks that enjoy this beer. Will try again later and re-evaluate if necessary."
"Cheers!!"
"Fairly high carbonation. Very drinkable."
"This is probably the most widely available witbier and a very good one, thus I often use it to judge other beers of this style."
"D - Pleasure to drink on a warm sunny day. Great appearance and nice smell, but a little lacking in overall flavor."
"Drinkability - Very much so. I find this beer refreshing on this 85+ degree southern California day. I use to not like the witbier style but it has definitely grown on me these past few months."
"Drinkability: Pretty darn good, especially with the clean finish."
"The quality of this beer cannot be denied. I'd love to try a fresh quaff in Belgium to give it a truly fair review."
"D- Damn good. Great wit. Constructed well, low alcohol and with excellent drinkability."
"D: The beer is very refreshing and quite sessionable, particularly during the warm weather in the summer months."
"Drinkability is smooth and easy. It's pretty good but not outstanding."
"Overall, a very decent witbier and, of course, the flagship for the style. I've had other witbiers I liked better but would be hard pressed to find one that is so readily available and as decent."
"Notes: This is an slightly above average witbier. Has very traditional flavors with not frills, but it is executed well which gives it this rating."
"Drinkability is great, with a fantastic flavor and 4.9% ABV, this is my favorite summer session beer."
"I'm told that Blue Moon was highly influenced by this beer. I believe it. I'm not a huge fan of Blue Moon, but I really enjoyed Hoegaarden. It reminded me more of one of my favorites, The Love by Star Hill. Almost a bitter taste, but a very nice, wheaty flavor. The aftertaste from this is acceptable also. In the long run, I would order this beer again."
"Not bad at all, but not sure if I'd pay the $10 Seattle retail price again."
"D: Overall, this is one of the better examples of a style that is dominated by sickly-sweet, over fruited/spiced, excuses for beer. This example bears little resemblance to Blue Moon and Shock Top, and I couldn't be more happy about it. I had to try this brew after reading up on Piere Celis and his contribution to Belgian brewing. I don't know how much InBev tinkered with his original recipe, but what is presented here is a well made brew."
"Drinkability - Easy to drink and a good light beer for the summer. A good session beer."
"Still a classic and the benchmark for the style. Widely imitated, but only a few have surpassed the original. I'll take one anytime, any day."
"Considering the large distribution of this beer, this should be the Witbier that mainstream drinkers choose, not the sub-standard Blue Moon."
"D: Easy to drink, good summer session beer, although it wasn't as good as I remembered. Pair well with a lite summer dish on the patio."
"Overall- i'm not usually a belgian fan but this one isn't to shabby. i reviewed the beer as is but i find it alot better with squeezing some orange in it."
"Malt comes out more as it warms and this is a highly drinkable beer that is an ideal summer beer. First had this beer in London back in 1999 and have enjoyed it ever since."
"D- My favorite white ale and my favorite wheat beer. I can drink these all day long :) I would rather drink this than eat breakfast."
"D-A great witbier and probably my favorite of the big ones."
"Drinkability - Very easy to drink. More of a summer beer of course. This beer definitely not horrible, but just not my first choice when choosing a wheat beer."
"Overall: Delicious beer. Nothing to complain about."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Nicely carbonated a very light body. Would make a pretty good session beer."
"Drinkability - This beer is very drinkable, and still better than most whites I've had even though I have a few issues with it."
"I love Hoegaarden. This is truly a great beer. Way better than most wheat beers. There is a depth to the flavor like a good bottle of wine has. There are traces of cinnamon, orange peel, and white chocolate almost. Speaking of which, I have tried this beer with a slice of orange or lemon in it, which seems to bring out the sweet citrus taste in the beer even more. In a bottle, poured into a Hoegaarden hexagonal glass, produces a beautiful head, and on tap is even better, although very difficult to locate a place in Australia that has it on tap. Try it with a slice of lemon or orange. Beautiful!"
"D: A very drinkable, refreshing beer."
"This isn't a bad beer but I think I expected more because its so popular. It tasted more like a lager than any of the other Belgian Whites that I've tried. Its still a good choice on a hot summer day but honestly I'd rather drink a Goose Island Matilda or a Blue Moon White Ale."
"O- Its enjoyable and crafty. Everything from the color to the spects of orange peel that lace the head make me want to like this beer. It might take time to warm up to this beer, but its somehow intriguing and makes you want to grab another."
"This beer is very light, clean, and easy to drink. Not much carbonation, so it doesnt fill you up. Be careful as its easy to drink this like lemonade, rather than beer."
"Bottle, home. Extremely ho-hum. The beer pours a pale shade of yellow with a tinge of orange. The head is large and pillowy, though it dissipates a bit quickly. The aroma is muted with a sour grain off note, citric acidity, light wheat spice and some spicing. The flavor is quite boring. It's a bit too acidic and the grain doesn't have a good flavor. Some grassiness and spice. There's just not a ton going on. Mouthfeel is fine. Not bad but not something that I'd care to order again."
"D: Much better than I expected from such a popular and mainstream brew. Really a nice beer for the price. Very refreshing. This is an all around good beer for the price. I think it easily beats out Blue Moon."
"D - medium to high. Goood flavour, not as good as leffe but still good. Price tag is a little restrictive to drinkabilty."
"This is and has been my favorite Belgian White for many years and now that it's available almost everywhere and still has the same great smell and taste, I'll always keep a 12er in the beer fridge. I have the original Hoegaarden glasses and this beer looks great in them. Great aroma and taste to match. It's a shame that Bud bought the company, but as long as they don't change the original recipe, I can live with it. There is a small amount of white head after the pour that only adds to the deliciousness of the beer."
"Poued according to the instructions on the bottle, into a 35cl IKEA Pokal glass (almost the same as a genuine Hoegaarden one). A white two finger head which rapidly dissapears into a thin layer. Cloudy pale yellow. Minor lacing. Smells of citrus and spice. Tast is similar. Very drinklable and very good on a hot day. A weak imitation of the on tap version, but still worthy."
"drinkability is so great. good anytime of year, but exspecially good on those hot summer days. this beer is a staple for me, i really love it for partys and weekend boozing, you can really pound these and still have a flavorfull good beer on your hands and not be wasted off of only a couple. if you want to get into belgians, but dont know where to start, this would be a great place."
"Not too intense at all considering the coriander and orange peel, but refreshing and tasty -- a perennial summer favorite with BBQ chicken and melons."
"I consider this a benchmark for style. It's so hard to rate a beer that really defines the style (like Duvel's done for the Belgian Strong Pale). Are there things I might tweak? Sure. But what other beer jumps out at you when somebody says Witbeer?"
"Decent wit, nothing special, but a nice classic example of the style. Easy to get and easy to drink, but there are so many better options for the price."
"Overall, this is a good example of the style, but It may be just a little too laid back, but it's still a nice beer that is definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability is the biggest weakness, as it becomes a little heavy on the fruit and esters by the end of the pint."
"All in all probably not bad on a really hot day but not one I will search for again."
"I don't normally swoon like this over a ""light-flavor"" beer, but this stuff is really damn good! The bottle, dressed as a monk, exudes the pleasant tastefulness of the Belgian white within. Pepper-taste, soft, non-intrusive. The spices really add a lot to this beer. It is highly drinkable, and I couldn't imagine a single beer-drinker who would dislike this masterpiece. If you ain't tried it, go get a six pack... TODAY!"
"D: Can drink a couple before getting bored with it."
"overall: i liked it, its alright. probably would not buy a 6 pack of this unless i didn't have many options but it was a good loose beer and worth a try. Almost tastes like and has the similar color as Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy."
"D - It could be a bit colder. It's a good wit that's available at most places that sell beer but it's not incredible. Definitely a refreshing summer beer but one I've had better bottles of."
"I really enjoyed this beer for it not being too sweet and for its spiciness. It is wonderfully unique that I will enjoy occasionally. Not an all the time beer."
"Drinkability: Very easy drinkability, great brew for the spring/summer or whenever for that matter. Definitely a session beer if there ever was one. I would definitely drink this beer again."
"Decent beer but would not buy again, I don't like wheat beers very much.."
"Notes: Seems like a very good example of the style. Wonderful summer, wheat beer. Would be a wonderful substitute for macros (I know, different style but same concept of easy drinking and refreshing aspects). Not amazing but easy to drink."
"A nice hazy orange color with decent white head that laces nicely. Smell is typical, orange, wheat, some clove. Taste follows suit, with some nice orange peel, lemon, clove, and some bready/wheaty malt. Some off-metallic flavors too, though not very strong. MF is light and smooth, pretty good for the style, and drinkability is great, a nice beer to just relax with--not too much thinking needed."
"The fact it's been available so (relatively) cheaply recently also helps."
"This is a good beer! Not the best, but it is good, and would order it in a bar! Nice glass bottle, the actual Hoegaarden glass is very impressive! Taste is good, I am satisfied! Nice head, decent color-blurry.-- I would recommend this beer to a friend!"
"Notes - Served at 46.5 degrees. The beer had an OK level of carbonation and I kind of wish it had a little more."
"I would call this a Belgian Lawnmower beer. Something to drink all day out in the sun or while watching baseball. I like it but I have had some Texas versions that I like just a bit more."
"The taste is excellent, a clean citrus and spice flavor that goes down smooth with a thin and somehow almost creamy texture; leaves a sweet taste in the finish."
"Slainte."
"It's definitely not the primo example of the style, nor is it my favorite, but nothing beats this brew in the summertime. Although it's a bit pricy, I'll have several of these on hand throughout the summer months. The perfect patio brew."
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors are not too strong, and it is not very filling"
"Big fat phenolic nose of band aid and clove and yeast. Flavors match the aroma, with the addition of some bready notes, hints of biscuit and toffee, plus a peppery spice in the finish. Marshmallow lingers. Dry and crisp moutfeel, semi full, finishes tingly."
"D - Refreshing, easy to drink and won't make you feel too full/bloated after a few."
"D: A decent beer, but simple and with an almost pilsner-like taste. Compared to other Belgian beers out there, I was underwhelmed."
"It's no wonder that this is a popular summertime quaff. Flavorful, crisp, and very easy drinking, this is some refreshing stuff!"
"D: It's a light but good beer, a little to sweet for my liking but i could still easily put aback a few of these.Great beer for a warm day."
"I used to have this more often, but have been too delightfully distracted by the many other (tasty) choices in this style range. I had one today because I wanted to wait a bit before cracking open our more special brews... good to have around for moments like this."
"A very drinkable beer, a nice session beer that would quench your thirst on warm summer day."
"Why haven't I had this sooner? From now on if I need a session beer, this will be it. All that needs to be said about this one."
"D highly drinkable, extremely smooth and tasty. the perfect companion to light meals, (salads and mild fish.) this beer also would be perfect prior to a meal it does a great job at cleansing the pallet."
"Served in an Ommegang Witte glass; pale golden color, hazy due to the yeast, with a thick white head. Lemony aroma, ""Belgian"" aroma for lack of a better description. Taste is a delicate wheat flavor, a little spicy with a bit of citrus. Mouthfeel is clean and fairly dry. Incredibly drinkable beer; not overpowering like some of the ""big"" beers, which is exactly how it is supposed to taste!"
"Note: Forget the orange/lemon that some people add. This beer is tasty and complex enough without it!"
"Not much else to say about this classic. Its one of the better Belgian Wits out there as it has a very nice and balanced flavor while remaining light and refreshing throughout. Try it with an orange slice for added zestyness."
"Drinkability: Very enjoyable."
"As far as I'm concerned, this is classic wit. Sure, there are better, but Hoegaarden has its place and its a gateway beer for Belgians, especially with the ladies. My go-to witbier."
"Finish is long and tasty, nice clean spicy finish. Significantly better than Blue Moon Belgian White."
"This is a true Belgian classic - easy to drink making it a summer time choice or for that matter anytime."
"Drinkability: Very nice. Much better than blue moon and I would have again for sure."
"I love this beer on a hot summer day or after exercising, it's so refreshing!"
"It is spritzy and refreshing, the perfect beer for a warm summer day at the porch."
"This beer is a staple for white beer, otherwise known as Witbier to the Belgian, which the wheat beer, white beer style. This beer is clearly what Harppon, Bluemoon, and others try to copy. I have found very few legitimate Belgian whites like Hoegaarden. I liked this beer. This beer is cloudy, the appearance is somewhat intimidating, but intriguing. This beer is lighter than I thought it would be for its cloudiness. Hoegaarden is very good, it has hints of citrus, and or coriander. Excellent with cheese of any variety. This drink is highly drinkable. Drink it."
"(D) Highly drinkable...multiple in one session would be easy."
"Tons of people drink this beer here in Montreal either bottled or on tap as its widely available."
"D - The relatively low ABV lends to the drinkability, and if you're a fan of the style, this is easily quaffable. A decent brew, and surprisingly, my first foray into the world of Hoegaarden. I'll be interested to try their other brews."
"D: Tremendous drinkable, truly refreshing. The kind of thing you could drink after exercising, and not feel weird about it."
"My favorite wheat beer yet. Fantastic taste. The smell was probably not quite as good as Blue Moon but the taste was untouchable compared to any other white ales I have had. Smooth pour, and very smooth drink all and all. Price was a little high, but well worth it in the end."
"Yellow very pale, her smell like coriander, citrus peel and apples. It feels even touches honey, as from a honey cake. The nose is sour and the beer is acidic in the mouth but round and soft. Little bitterness but a finish quite spicy. A very refreshing white that arises as a standard, despite the lower quality products from the brewery AB InBev."
"Drinkability: Could handle one or two but then I got to find my hops"
"D: It's light and tastes decent, so drinks very easily."
"Pours a pale cloudy yellow with a thin white head. Smells of sweet citrus, some wheat, and spices. The taste follows up on the aroma, but with more of a punch on the tastebuds. One can taste all the flavors in this beer. The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing. Not too much carbonation, but enough. Overall an awesome witbier and anytime beer."
"Overall- This has been a very enjoyable beer experience."
"D - Very drinkable and good session beer overall."
"Overall an interesting, well thought-out beer. Nothing spectacular but give it a try!"
"D: Excellent white wheat beer but i prefer the bitterness of german wheat beers."
"D: A beer that can be sessioned, but even without a high ABV, the somewhat complex taste might wear thin after awhile. Still, the average ABV allows one to finish off a six pack and not necessarily have to worry about the ramifications the next day."
"Cheers!"
"Overall - One of the best mainstream wits"
"Not particularly attractive. Pours murky pale white-ish yellow, minimal head, no retention, spotty lacing. SMELL is wheaty, yeasty banana and clove, hint of lemon. Pretty impressive for such a light beer. TASTE banana, clove like spiciness, modest malty sweetness, and light balancing bitterness. FEEL strong carbonation, thin and clean. OVERALL goes down like water, but with robust flavors. Seriously sessionable lawnmower beer."
"Overall I think it is a solid example for the style, the only thing worth being upset about is the lack of head. I appreciate the clove aroma and taste in this style and it is not overpowering at all, it blends well with the other scents and flavors."
"Pours a hazy yellow with a thick white froth and decent lacing. Soft and pretty aromas of banana, cloves, coriander, lemon, grains, & biscuit-like yeastiness. Very pretty nose & the best part about this beer. The beer is crisp and lean on the mouthfeel with flavors of lemon, lime, coriander, wild flowers, and grains. Pretty straight forward in terms of flavor. Overall, this is a solid beer that is a bit watery on the mouthfeel, but smells very nice and is very sessionable."
"Very mild yet pleasant aroma with hints of citrus and creamy feel to the palate. The mouth feel is VERY nice. Zero aftertaste. I found this to be a quality wheat beer with a very nice spice and citrus zest to it. Probably will buy this again."
"Overall a very drinkable beer for anyone, there is nothing harsh or flavor that stands out in this beer. There is a peppery flavor that is complimented by the texture and style of the beer. The slight after bite of sour is very distinguishing of this beer and is quite agreeable."
"Sometimes you get a questionable bottle, as these things travel pretty far in God knows what condition and what freshness."
"Pours a hazy, pale yellor color. 1/5 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and poor lacing. Smells of yeast, citrus (banana), slight sweet malt, and slight tart malt. Fits the style of a Witbier. Mouth feel is smooth and sharp with an average carbonation level. The feel is also very watery. Tastes of yeast, pale malt, sweet malt, citrus (banana/orange), and slight tart malt. Overall, weak body and watery, but still a good blend."
"Dr. Easy going, crisp and drinkable."
"Eh, medium to thin body, not very effervesant in my mouth. Some bitterness, some citrus flavors, not a whole lot going on. I may be serving this a little too cold, who knows. Drinkability fine, mouthfeel average. I'm bored."
"Mouthfeel/Drink: Thin body, the mouthfeel is slight carbonation. Drink at 3℃, too cold for winter time, but this beer would be very thirst-quenching in the summer."
"Pours a very cloudy straw yellow, fluffy white head, decent retention but minimal lacing. Smell is of hay, belgian yeast with faint hints of citrus, white pepper and corriander. Taste follows scent with a nice earthy straw and bready belgian yeast flavor, backed up with hints of citrus, white pepper and corriander. Light bodied, perfectly mellow carbonation, slightly grainy and refreshing. Great Belgian Wit that doesnt overdo any of the citrus or spices like other brands tend to do."
"Santé!"
"D: Goes down smooth and isn't too too heavy but couldn't have them all day."
"I like this beer."
"D: This witbier is one that I drink without a piece of citrus fruit on the glass. Also has it's own unique glassware to drink from."
"Along with Harpoon IPA this was one of my gateway beers and I could have sworn it used to be better. Still, I feel like I'm drinking a piece of brewing history, thank you Peter Celis."
"Poured out a cloudy, straw color with an enormous head despite a very cautious pour though it dissipated quickly not leaving behind any lacing. Aroma wise, I get a hint of wheat. The taste is very bland and it reminds me of an American macro to be perfectly honest. I get a hint of orange but that's about all. Its very smooth and easy to drink, so that is a plus, but overall kind of a boring beer."
"O: Good beer. Excellent example of a Belgian Wit."
"Refreshing like walking outside afer a summer down pour."
"Drinkability - Great for dessert. This beer makes me think of vanilla ice cream with a slice of cake. The sourness of the beer would offset well right before or after dessert."
"D: High! Very refreshing summer beer. Must be excellent with chocolate."
"Maybe I'm a little soft, but the alcohol taste really stands out for a 4.9% ABV beer."
"I just simply don't get this style of beer. The coriander and orange mixed together with hops and malts and yeast just have never made any sense to me. The smell is sweet and citrusy at first, but then it turns into something like bolonga. That sounds strnge, but thats what I smell. Very, very bad. It looks alright when poured into the mug. Very pale, cloudy with a big fluffy head. Then it went into my mouth. The spice and the orange and the hops and the malt just don't get along. Couple this with the fact that this bottle aparently has been around for a while. This add a slight oxidized skunky udertone to everything. It's just nausiating. Milllions of people love it. Different strokes. More power to you. In my opinion it's some of the most hidiously undrinkable stuff in existance."
"D- This one goes down the same every time, great. This is a great beer for summer time and good when really thirsty."
"D: Sessionable for sure. Nothing stellar, nothing to keep louring you back, but sessionable. In offensive, but perhaps unimpresive as well."
"Overall, this beer drinks well, it's worth drinking, however, I can think of a few more common brands I would rather have."
"Witbiers are a light, easy drinking style. Hoegaarden fits into this mould but it a little dull."
"Overall really a classic example of the witbier. As typical and common as it is, it really is nice for a drinkable wit. Nothing mind-blowing or crazy exciting, but just a solid, flavorful session beer."
"D: Nice, really nice refreshing summer beer. I've got a friend that told me he had this beer with craw-fish (swedish style) and it was the best thing ever - I'm going to try that next fall."
"Refreshing and extremely drinkable this is a world classic that has not been beaten down by the bean counters quite yet. As a wit should an nice silky smooth mouthfeel. Delicious, if you don't like Witbiers, get into practice they are a great style."
"Whatever it was, it was very drinkable and perfect for a hot summer day."
"Drinkability: I just bought one bottle of this but now I wish I'd bought a sixpack. At 4.9%, it would make a great session beer."
"D - Nice summer brew. Great lawnmower beer or outside on a deck."
"Easy to drink several glasses even 125cl especially on hot days without getting that feeling of having too much sweet!"
"This is the one beer always on tap in my house. And yes, I prefer it on tap."
"I poured into a pint glass to two inches of white head. It is a hazy, pale yellow. It has a spicy citrus smell. I also get a grass smell. It tastes spicy with some yeast mixed in there. I get some citrus and maybe some banana. It is crisp and refreshing after a long day of work. I will have a few, but this one will not make it into my regular rotation."
"Pale yellow, with cloudy body and white head with a touch of creaminess. Some wheat and citrus in the smell and the taste envelops some spice and orange peel with a well-balanced yeastiness and decent carbonation. Light to medium body and very soft, balanced finish that really goes down well. Absolutely going for another."
"I've always considered this the master of the wit, but it feels someone subdued, like I've been exposed to wild, untamed examples and this here seems too polite and mild. I can't mark it down though because it's well balanced and unpretentious, and very drinkable."
"D- Easy to get through this beer while still enjoying it. Seems like a good beer for someone who is just starting to explore different beers."
"On tap at Emmet's Pub near Park Street. Served in a Hoegaarden 0.33l octagon glass. Love that shape. Quick white head that disappears immediately. Opaque yellow color. Thin and a bit watery looking. Smell was a bit citrus like, with a floral hint. Taste is quintessential witbier. Fruity and spicy, orange peel and coriander all layered on top of each other. Low in abv and one of the most smooth beers you'll ever have. I know that it's one of those Belgians that is so widespread that it's almost too well know, but I think that this beer is the pinnacle of the style. When served in the right glass and from a fresh tap, you just can't beat it. It's a classic."
"D - A well built, great drink. Though it could benefit from tweaks to the appearance."
"Overall, a fantastic beer by any standard. Great anytime, but especially on a nice summer day. Fans of this style who haven't given this one a try yet should do so!"
"carbonation is present in small bubbles."
"Pours a hazy bright yellow color with a nice one finger head to it. The smell is very weak and faint and smells of wheat grains. The taste is of wheat with hints of citrus, however, not just your standard artificial taste that sometimes plaques the class. The taste is smooth and natural. The mouthfeel is slight carbonation and is creamy. Overall it is a very drinkable beer, very smooth and it doesn't give off an artificial over the top taste like other wits."
"Don't drink and review."
"Pours a cloudy lemonade color with a shallow foamy white head that fades fairly quicky leaving spotty patterns of Belgian lacing. The smell is earthy with a spicy note of corriander. Nicely carbonated, the mouth feel is light bodied and refreshing. Full flavored, the taste of earthy yeast dominates and is complimented nicely by the notes of corriander. A fine drinker by any standards."
"Well carbonated yet smooth, not really thin but very light one, almost watery with corresponding drinkability. Great summer companion."
"D: A very refershing summer brew, though I probably should've tossed the lemon slice that came along with it. This is a great wheat brew that is pretty widely distributed, a fantastic safety brew. The makers deserve props for making such a good beer so widely available, it has it's place in the beer world and it does a great job!"
"D: A really, really good witbier that brings more flavor to the table, mainly in the vein of wheaty tanginess, which seems to not do as well with BAs. I really like it, but I'm not a huge wit fan and tend to like hefes more. That being said, I think this is underrated here, but maybe the bottle suffers for the trip over. I enjoyed this a lot and will go back again over the summer."
"cheers!"
"D- Nice refreshing beer, ideal for summertime. I don't really get the sliced fruit thing."
"An excellent hot weather beer"
"Pours with a thin head into the chunky Hoegaarden glass that dissipates as you chug along. Looks resplendent with condensation and cloudy pale when you hold the glass against light. Smells of hot spices like clove, tastes like what it smells like, spicy with citrus undertones. Mouthfeeel is chunky, specially when you warm it up while twirling in your mouth. Carbonation is optimum. Drinkable throughout the year. The beer needs to be savoured - drink slowly and let it warm up in your hands."
"Pours with a nice thick head that becomes a ring of carbonation around edge of the glass until the beer is gone. Aroma is citrusy, with hints of orange peel, wheat, and a certain consistent strain of yeast. Color is homogeneously cloudy yellow/white with no sediment, just cloudy throughout. Wheat malt pervades the flavor profile, along with the estery yeast profile. More pear than apple, and more banana that either of those. The palate is almost bubblegummy, but refreshing nonetheless. This is a good entry-level blanche/wit. If you like it, try some of the harder to find examples of the style."
"In general, a nice and refreshing beer for a hot summer day. A bit sweet, a classic, but still one of the better white beers out there."
"Someone recommended this to me for a good summer beer, and I was highly impressed, since I'm more of a dark beer fan. This is one of the best lighter beers I've ran into in my small amount of beer exprience. On the more of drinkability, pretty good, while a too high for a sessionbeer, I could drink this during a long summer day."
"At a summer party past weekend I brought a 6-pack of this for myself while other folks drank the usual swill - Molson, Miller, Bud. Got pretty good and hammered off the 6-pack and only found myself tiring of the taste on the very last one. Thus the reliability/drinkability I mentioned. This beer is especially great with an orange slice, not the usual lemon. If you like orange of course."
"Yeah. With over 1000 reviews here I'm hardly likely to say anything new so I'll leave it at that."
"Poured with a good-sized, white head with not much lacing. Body is a very pale yellow, and extremely cloudy - completely opaque. Great aroma of citrus, coriander, and spices - especially black pepper. Light to medium-bodied on the palate, with soft carbonation. Nice taste of citrus and pepper, with a medium-lasting finish. Overall, one of the classic whites... very nice, but it may actually be a little TOO spicey."
"D - I have been drinking this beer regularly since I was in college, and never really stopped to think properly about what I was drinking. It is not the best beer I have ever tasted but it is one of the most interesting."
"D: Brouwerij van Hoegaarden has done an excellent job with their take on the Witbier. Honestly, I have just gotten around to revieiwing this white ale, and I can honestly say that you would be hard-pressed to find a more agreeable brew for your summertime (really anytime) crowd pleasing brew..."
"Mouthfeel is nice and silky, with a creamy body that is also light bodied and refreshing. This beer was on tap at a restaurant below my hotel room when I went to on vacation, and it was all I had for the 4-5 times I went there. Never got tired of this beer, and it was very versatile with the food served there."
"I get plenty of light citrus/orange hints among a little spice and a little wheat maltiness. Not a bad beer, but just somewhat thin on both body and taste."
"I think this beer is very drinkable - particularly when consumed quickly without pondering the taste. When enjoyed as most people enjoy beer, it is very crisp and clean with a nice beer flavor left in the mouth."
"Light bodied and a little bit fizzy. Goes down like water on a hot day, or any day for that matter."
"(D)- A great summer beer to quench your beer thirst. Simple and light, but memorable."
"D- I could drink this beer all night, but would likely choose not to just because of the sweetness and floral sensation. Still a good beer to enjoy on occasion however."
"It tastse decent, sweet, a little too biter at the end."
"If you have a chance, try it... but if you are a hopheaded malt loving maniac it may not float your boat. Thing is you'll never know till you try."
"Overall its a great witbier. just got it on sale for $14 a 12 pack at the supermarket. fell in love with this beer when i randomly tried a sixer of it months ago. one of my favs until i try another witbier thats better."
"Drinkability- ok except for the soapy taste"
"Verdict: I would try another Belgium beer unless you have tried ""many"" (not just a few or none) Belgium beers then I would try it."
"drinkability is not good since the taste is so bad but it is very light and could throw back many"
"pours a cloudy straw color with a fluffy white head..the smell is coriander spices some clove and a little oats and wheat..taste is better then the look and smell its has a subtle spice clove taste that is not overpowering it finishes with a wheat slight oat taste ...its really a pretty good witbier this is one to try if you want to start sampling belgium beers it very easy to drink flavorful and low abv..its a good one for the summer and one that i enjoy having every so often..yes recommended"
"D) Good, a good summer's day ale. However, for me the sweetness and floral smell/taste was a little much. It's a strongly flavorful Wit, so it's great if that's what you are in the mood for."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pale white/golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Somewhat cloudy and a delicious spicy smell, lots of citrus. Very flavorfull taste with citrus and spices very pronounced and quite delicious. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall this is a top notch beer."
"Drinkability: The drinkability is high. This is a decent wheat, though I prefer German style hefes."
"It's pretty good! Definitely not over-done, it is superlative in some pretty subtle ways. It isn't overly sweet like some American imitators, it is brightly yellow with a nice meringue head. Aroma and flavor is slightly sweet with a pleasing amount of Coriander and I dare say offer something that I think is wheatiness. Pretty good, but probably better a generation ago...the same way the first DIPA must've been revolutionary...now that every craft brewer has one, I'm a little less impressed."
" The ABV isn't too high, which is nice and improves drinkability. I'd definitely recommend this for a person on a hot day or just a session beer."
"D: Full of flavor, yet still light and refreshing. Combine that with a modest ABV, and you get exceptional drinkability. This beer is great year around, but definitely hits the spot on a hot summer day. Far better than most of the bland summer offerings from US brewers."
"D: Hoegaarden is one of those beers that i would describe as Upper-Middle Class, mass produced but good. Among upper middle class beers I would say hoegaarden is among, if not the most drinkable. Perfect for pounding or sipping during the warm months."
"Lots of copies of this beer, but Hoegaarden is the original and has my respect."
"A good beer for warm months. One of the better witbiers available."
"This is one of the only witbiers I have had and enjoyed. That said this is a pretty good beer."
"Overall, this is a pretty drinkable beer. Though it seems more suited to warmer weather, it would be welcomed on many different occasions. Not the most challenging beer, and after one or two I'd almost always move onto something different (i.e. though drinkable, not a session beer for me) but overall a nice quaff."
"Not an every day beer, but not bad to have in the fridge for hot days."
"Quite refreshing, overall, and decently balanced for your summer drinking needs. Maybe more than a tad overpriced, but that may be more a function of the environment, than anything."
" a hot day."
"Pours a cloudy yellow color with a one finger white head. Head leaves little lacing down the glass but the head stays around for a while. Pretty average look to it. Smells of yeast, spices, citrusy, pretty nice smell for a belgian, has that belgian smell to it. Taste is really good and taste like it smells. Yeasty, spicy, citrus. It's pretty smooth and refreshing for sure. Doesn't seem as complex as some other belgians I've tried but I think it's good somewhat more simple than some others. Very drinkable, I think if someone is looking to get into belgians or just try one this one would be a good one to try. I don't drink belgians to often but this is one I'd like to pick up again."
"From the 330 ml bottle marked 15/03/10-T-02217-3511 and sampled on June 5, 2009. The pour almost looks as thin as water when it fist spills from the bottle but within a moment it evolves into a very cloudy but pale yellow. Not a significant amount of head or lacing. The aroma is full of a roasted smoky composition and wheat and other field elements. A pretty god mouthfeel somewhere between medium to bold. The flavor is brimming with wheat and coriander but in better balance than other witbiers that I have had. A slight hint of citrus and tartness but overall a pretty well-balanced beer."
"D - Very tasty and quaffable, I could drink this all day long!"
"A good Wit for a first timer."
"Very drinkable beer. Nothing special as far as it tastes but it works perfectly as a general purpose refreshment beer. Works on a hot day, works with a cold meal or a hot meal. Just a really good all purpose brew, which I think is what it wants to be."
"Drinkability - It's a very good and unique white ale, with a nice crisp citrus-like flavor. Very easy to drink, especially out of a frosted Hoegaarden glass on a hot summer day. Adding a slice of lemon can add a little zing to this one, if desired."
"This is a classic witbier and I never tire of it."
" Just a simply brilliant drinkable experience."
"Well for the best known ""white ale," this is very dissatisfying, I wish it was franziskaner that was available on draft for 5 bucks at the Joshua Tree."
"Overall this is an easy-drinking wit and a nice go-to during the summer months at bars serving large amounts of InBev."
"d- very drinkable, easy to drink multiple."
"Simply one of the very best in the world, and tops in its category. Tried on draft and from bottle. Citrus and light spice aroma with medium head mostly diminishing. Very smooth taste and excellent session beer. ""Blue Moon"" cannot hold a candle to this world-class brew - cheers to the Belgians once again!"
"Overall this is a fairly easy beer to drink. I've rarely had a problem ordering one when I'm looking for something lighter to drink, and it goes well with a fairly good amount of grub."
"D: With an abv of 5% this is very drinkable, especially in the summer."
"D: Arguably the quintessential wit. Really easy to knock back several in a session, especially in summertime."
"The mouthfeel is more of a smooth than a crisp, though it is that to a point. The carbonation is active and body is moderate."
"The rich frothy collar rests atop the yellowish cloudy brew and suggests a white aurora towards the bottom of the pint glass. Aromas are reminiscent of orange Creamsicle, coriander, and some faint Big League Chew original bubblegum in the back. Citrus (lemon and orange) flavors mix, pale wheat, and clean hop tinge create a wonderful and refreshing beer, perfect for a wedding or a day in the backyard with friends."
"Had on tap with some frenchfries. Pours a hazy yellow color with no head. Lots of Lacing. Smells nice, a lot of yeasty esters and citrus. Definitely some coriander. Tastes like it smells -the yeast shines thru and there's a lot of character from the wheat malt. The high carbonation makes it refreshing and very drinkable."
" Hoegaarden is also a very light beer. It's not very filling, so it doesn't take much to knock a couple back, unless you've got some food around. Even though I haven't got one of the Hoegaarden glass, I must say that it's key to have some sort of glass, otherwise the sediment makes the last sip gross. Of course, I know someone who enjoys the taste, but it makes me cringe every time I forget about it and drink a bottle without thinking."
"D: Similar to a German hefe except Hoegaarden is not as heavy. This beer's low %ABV and smoothness make it a wonderful summertime refresher. Very easy to slam."
"The taste is also good, dry but not overly dry, a bit fruity or perfumy without being overly so, very light citrus or banana qualities, with a hint of 7-up. The feel is a bit zesty and tingly. It's crisp as well."
"MF&D - Light and refreshing. A nice warm weather choice."
"Overall a well balanced beer, very drinkable, perfect to cool off but lacks body and intensity. However i suppose this is typical of the style. Certainly a beer I would buy again, but only if the weather called for it."
"Flavor is citrus zest, crisp wheat body, and a spicy, somewhat bitter and balancing coriander on the finish. Yeast is somewhat understated for the style, and the mouthfeel is a bit watery at times. Refreshing and light, good beer."
"Far from the first time I've had this but it deserves a rave-up. Still one of the best wits going round. The balance is what I find other makers can't quite seem to match. The light fruity esters and that spicy nose don't luck out and fall away on the palate like many imitators. All componenets working together to make a smooth, very drinkable beer with plenty of flavour and loads of character. Yum."
"Drinks pretty easy, a little more drinkable on draft, a little more gassy, so some complexity is lost. A benchmark for the style when fresh/not stale. There are ones I like better, but would always recommend this one as your first wit"
"Overall a good beer and one that can easily be enjoyed, especially on a warm day."
"Easy drinkability."
"the first few swallows were not only refreshing, but filled with more of the lemon-peppery goodness. The warmer the beer for, the sweeter the taste was, overall pretty well rounded brew, an excellent thirst quencher. I suspect i could session these quite easily."
"D) A great beer to have when your having more than one. A great specimen of the style despite its mass production"
"overall an average brew, a little too much on the lemon side for me."
"-RR"
"D: Probably one of my favorite witbiers; generally enjoyable anytime, but especially in the spring and summer."
"Beer is a yellow light amber color. its cloudy with white head. Good retention. Smell is nice and simple of spices, citrus, cloves and hint of banana. Taste is nice and mild perhaps just a little to watery for me. Nice banana, citrus taste nothing overpowering. Nice and simple. Very mild carbonation beer that is easy to drink."
"While this beer is refreshing when it is refrigerator cold, the subtle nuances of the coriander and orange peel are not as appreciated as when it warms to about 50 degrees. A pretty tame wit that appeals to a broad audience, but there is little doubt this is a finely crafted brew."
"Initially I didn't care for this beer, I thought it was going to be like a Blue Moon, so I drank it like one. I then came back and took it for what it was worth(which is an entity unto itself) and I absolutely loved it."
"Drinkability- Its really good, there little body or overwhelming complexity to this beer. It went went well with my Chicken Caesar salad. (Very Sessionable)"
"D- Easy to drink and light alcohol makes this a go to in the spring/summer time. This actually goes down like water because of the feel and non offensiveness."
"D: Great light, crisp summer beer. Definitely want this white ale again. And at its price point, it's a very affordable brew."
"Definitely going to try to always keep a few of these stashed away in the fridge."
"Had on tap at Charlie Brown's steakhouse. Served in a pint glass a Crayola orange-yellow color with a half-finger of foamy white head which left sparse lacing. Aroma was banana, orange, cloves and lemon. Mouthfeel was much thinner than I thought it would be with little carbonation. Taste was like the nose, adding some along with hard sugar candy sweetness. Drinkability is low. Overall this is a mediocre beer which I did not particularly enjoy. I feel it does not exemplify the style. There was no crispness as there is in other wits I have tried, just a syrupy candy sweetness. Maybe it has something to do with it being on tap. I would only ever try this again from a bottle, in order to give it a fair shot."
"Pours a murky very pale whitish yellow. Nice sized fizzy head dissipates quickly. Aroma is wheaty; banana, cloves, lemons, and some yeasty earthiness. Taste has just a bit of underlying sweetness. Wheat tang with similar notes as in the aroma. Well carbonated and crisp mouthfeel, maybe a little watery. Quite drinkable. A nice summer beer."
"All in all, an acceptable wit that would be easy to session."
"D - Good summertime beer. I could def drink this while grilling some lemon herb shrimp. MMM."
"D- i could drink these great things all day long. No better beer for warm weather."
"This mild, fairly watered down witbier makes it perfect for a large target audience. There was nothing bad about this beer, but at the same time, nothing really jumped out to distinguish it from others. On the other hand, it's very refreshing and definately sessionable. Overall, a decent brew that I wouldnt turn down if offered."
"very drinkable no doubt, perhaps the standard in which witbiers are compared. easy to drink, wont get old but won't blow your mind"
"Drinkability: A good wheat beer, maybe not for the price. There are other better choices."
"This is a very sessionable beer with its rather low ABV at 4.9 percent."
"A long time favorite of mine, it's time I gave it a review here. Pours a pale, hazy yellow, with some decent lace work on the glass. A light spicy, slightly fruity aroma. Great fresh taste of crisp wheat, with a little citrus and lemon, and nice spicy zip at the end. It's a light tasting beer to be sure, but a lively one. Decent level of carbonation and a very smooth, very drinakble. Works well all by itself as a thirst quenching type beer, but also works for me with light spicy foods, like grilled shrimp."
"Pale golden cloudy color. Nice head and lacing that stayed around. Banana, wheat, apricot aroma. Goes down very smooth, and was very refreshing. It was gone before I knew it. Will surely have it again, and will share with friends that like wheat beer."
"Overall- This is a classic and defines the Witbier style that all others follow. The flavor is weak compared to Allagash White, but this beer is a good example of the style. This beer is better on-tap that in bottle, which I find to be extremely inconsistent."
"D- Easy to drink although I think that the fruit flavor would get to me after several of them."
"This is one of the best Witbier's I have had. It is a beer that always goes fast when you have people over, always the party pleaser. An excellent brew, for what is becoming a very commercial beer - hopfully it stays excellent."
"Hoegaarden is one of my top five favorites. Cannot stop singing it's praises."
"Nice white head sits on top of pale yellow body that is cloudy from the yeast. Almost no carbonation. Little bit of lemon in the aroma. More tame lemons in the taste. Juicey with a little bit of sourness. Pretty bland compared to other witbiers."
"This is a very good witbier, and is extremely drinkable. I know that a lot of people would disagree with me, but I don't really think that this is far superior to Blue Moon. It's certainly better, but it doesn't blow it out of the water. I personally feel that they are both exactly what I am looking for when I drink a witbier, light, crisp and refreshing. Exactly what I want when I take a rare break from my usual IPA's and DIPA's."
"Drinkability: Easily a session beer. I prefer its German relative hefeweizens over the Belgian wheat beer, but still a good beer"
"Which brings me to drinkablility. This beer is so light, delicate, balanced and so light in ABV it is gone before you know it. This makes a great brew in-between tastings, or perfect on a summer afternoon. I introduce this one to Bud-drinking friends, and there hooked.An eye-opener if your inexperienced with Witbier, or one to sit back with eyes closed and a contented sigh if you are. Solid standard worth drinking if you haven't."
"I've had Hoegaarden a few times, and everytime I have one, I really struggle to finish it. And I don't know anyone that particularly likes it either. This is the beer that, when someone in my group of friends brings in a beer that turns out to taste awful, somebody says ""yeah this is bad, but do you remember that Hoegaarden?"" Maybe I'm not the cloudy orange flavored wheat beer type, but I'm giving it two thumbs down."
"Final Thought - Definitely a popular brew that deserves a look. Great flavor, and easy accesibility means more people should give this a shot."
"Very nice."
"That being said, this itself isn't the beer it used to be since being bought out and commercialized by giant mega-conglomerate InBev. I won't take away from what InterBrew has done to pry the witbier style into mainstream beer culture but just as much praise (if not more) is due to the man actually from the town of Hoegaarden, the man originally responsible for the recipe: Pierre Celis. If you like this beer than do yourself a favour, take the next step, read up on and seek out the St. Bernardus Pierre Celis Signature Witbier."
"D) Not the best Wit around but they are good. Refreshing anytime of the year."
"A nice cloudy straw color, with great citrus scents. I refuse a lemon with this, its not needed. Nice smooth mouthfeel. Can drink plenty of these at a session. This is what a Wit should be. Clean and smooth to drink with a great wheaty/citrus kick. Perfect summer beer."
"Final Thoughts - As my first Witbier, I was impressed. Yes the flavor is a bit strange, but I enjoyed it up till the very end (when I got a mouthful of pulp). Frankly, I'm shocked that this beer comes from Belgium, as I'd expect it to come from a tropical location given the flavor. I'd get it again on tap if I wanted something weird or something fruity to cool me down in the summer, but I wouldn't buy a case of it though."
"d: Not my favorite wit, but I do like this quite a bit."
"D: Figured I'd try the ""original"" Belgian Wit, from 1445. Even though it is technically a macro ( ABInbev ). Decent enough, will most likely pick up a 6er to have around, but, with so many other decent Wits around...who knows."
"Good beer but not my favorite style."
"Not incredibly complex, but fairly smooth, very refreshing and a great thirst quencher. Looks like this would be easy to enjoy a few of on a hot day."
"To me, it is too watery. The cloves are the best part of the beer. This isn't my favorite wit, but it is definitely worth a try"
"Overall - Good witbier. A benchmark for all others."
"This was one of those eye-opening beers back in high school. It was probably the first bev that made me realize there was a whole world of potential out there. That said, I can't imagine how I used to down sixers of this."
"D - This is a real smooth beer with good flavor. I could have a few of these in a sitting."
"Wish I had my hexagonal glass with me for this one. Hoegaarden is a great witbier and a must have for the wit-purist. It's not my all time favorite white, but it's a classic."
"D- Quenches thirst and goes well with poultry and fish"
"Not too bad.... Still not a favorite of mine."
"Comments: Very good tasting beer that is not too strong with the spices and is very smooth to drink."
"It was smooth as I expected, and was quite drinkable. I might not have it again, but I recommend you try it."
"D - tough one for me. Sometimes I like it sometimes I don't. If I'm in the mood for it I can have a few."
"Mouthfeel is carbonated and tart. Clearly, very drinkable."
"This truely is my favorite white beer. It is one of the few white beers that I have had so far but it is the best. It's real good with guinnness as well."
"There is a definite kick of fruit in the taste. Now I can distinguish the orange peel. Hoegaarden gives you that acidity that I had expected with the citrus flavor. This is a balanced brew as with the sweetness of the fruit I am also catching some sourness as well. I also can feel the carbonation as it hits my mouth. It is a light-bodied beer that finishes dry with a slight bitterness in the aftertaste."
"A little too citrusy & overly lemony to the point that I'd tire of it after a couple, but a very nice light refreshing beer."
"An ok beer - I needed to wean off of miller lite/those kinds of beers so I started trying out mid and high end beers. This one leaves a kind of nasty aftertaste though.. Good taste, what a better beer tastes like but it leaves that aftertaste behind that isnt very attractive. Maybe its just me though.."
" ~ I think I could ease back into a comfy chair and suck back a six pack of the Belgians, no problem. Thanks Krista."
"Cloudy, unfiltered, golden-yellow appearance with a bit of white foam. Refreshing aromas of citrus and coriander. The taste is momentary sweetness balanced with the dark spice of coriander, wheat and citrus. Heavy carbonation but not enough to mask the spices. Hoegaarden's flavor and refreshing qualities make this beer so drinkable that I can never, ever stop after one. I look forward to someday tasting it in Belgium."
"This is actually a beer that can be enjoyed by almost everyone. Even occasional beer drinkers really love the flavor, as do experienced beer drinkers looking for a smooth wheat beer. The only downside is that it is a bit pricey, normally $9-$11 for a six pack."
"Very crisp and very drinkable."
"REVIEW EDIT - I don't know what the problem was, but ever since this review I get monstrous heads on my Hoegaardens."
"Here's the kicker: the flavour didn't change after that first sip. I didn't find any improvement or backsliding, and even the head stayed about the same. I took about 20 minutes to drink this beer, and throughout the experience I didn't find any development. This would be fine if Hoegaarden was outstanding, but I don't think it is. I was slightly disappointed - I had hoped it would develop more through the session. This may be an issue of white beers and my own taste, but I finished the beer without being too impressed. I expected more out of it, to be honest. I can only rate it as average for its lack of outright flaws. It's fine if you're going to have a few with friends who don't like anything heavier or more flavourful, but it's nothing to get too excited over."
"The price and availability of this beer make it that much better."
"Pours a slightly hazy, lemon-water yellow color with a booming pure white head. Soft, citrusy wheat character in the nose, soft, with hints of mint and hop bitterness. Bright to the tongue, lots of husky grain, clean wheat, and lime peel, doughy yeast and a fruity twang upon the finish. The only thing truly lacking here in flavor is its aftertaste, burnt and stale, musky and it stays with you for what seems like forever. Light in body, crisp enough, definitely refreshing. I've had many better witbier but a Hoe-y still remains drinkable IMO."
"D- A great representative of the Wit style. I felt it was a little heavy on the coriander and light on all other components. However I would gladly drink this beer almost anytime."
"Poured a pale straw color that was milky with a big impressive head. Head dissipated quickly. Definitely smelled of orange and wheat. Tasted similar to the smell with a nice dry finish. Beer was nicely balanced. This is a nice refreshing beer that would be a nice summer refresher."
"M + D: It's crisp, but not overdone. Dry, but not 'parching.' A decent body, but the flavour profiles are just not quite there. This beer has plenty of potential to be something very great... I hope to see that happen!"
"The mouthfeel is light (not quite as like as water) with a nice amount of carbonation. Drinkability is high; I could drink these all night."
"D - You could really enjoy this beer on a hot day...actually, several of these beers..."
"This beer is easy to find, easy to drink, and easy on the liver! A world better than Blue Moon."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was very white and the beer was very cloudy. The beer poured a really fluffy big white head that looked delicious. The smell was very breadt very yeasty and was favorable. However the taste was just not good for me. Certainly wheat beers are not my favorite, but if you like a slightly sour tasting beer you might like ot. I will not buy again."
"Drinkability is about as high as it gets. I wouldn't have a problem downing 4-5 pints of Hoegaarden on a given evening. This is one easy pleaser of a beer."
"Good witbier, and available almost everywhere. One of the best beers you can buy at wal-mart or almost any grocery store."
"A light and citrusy white beer with a hefty amount of spice mainly apparent in the after taste. This beer was very easy to drink and came in a thoughtfully designed bottle and six pack holder. The bulb at the neck of the bottle helped to ensure a better pour and the top of the six pack holder provided the phonetic spelling of Hoegaarden to help with pronunciation. The attention to detail and thought put into this beer is top notch."
"Take my opinion with a grain of salt, since this is literally my official ""third"" beer (not counting whatever I had when I lived in Mexico) since I've been searching for something I'd like. I'd definitely buy this again, and I plan on bringing it whenever someone asks me to bring drinks to a getty again."
"Still one of the better belgian witbiers."
"Beer is very session able , easy to drink. Not my favorite witbier but love the style so would drink again."
"Overall, it is a decent brew for something so popular. I could probably enjoy this at a bar or have this for a session beer."
"D: Good drinkability, the flavor is nothing out of the world but it's solid. Tastes fine without adding any oranges, which makes it better than Blue Moon at any rate. Still, with all the other good Wit's out there, probably not something I would seek out."
"It's just not my style I guess. I really didn't like it. But others might. I don't think i like coriander and orange peel in beer. In food sure but beer, no. Don't think I had a wit beer I liked... yet."
"it costs too much to be an every day beer but it is a very good beer and im glad i bought it. i'd buy this again and probably will in the future."
"I do plan on trying it again, however"
"Conclusion: Simple flavors of citrus and spice coupled with great drinkability; this would make one supremely refreshing warm-weather beer."
"(rated Dec 1, 2007)"
"Complex in aroma, simple subtle taste. A light experience but flavorful in palette. Good beer."
"D - Definitely drinkable. I really enjoy this brew, one of my favorites."
"Cheers!"
"mouthfeel is of good carbonation, great taste, easy to drink/session, dry, wheat creaminess/yeast.. yum :D"
"I love hoegaarden, I was never a big fan of wheat beers and still am not except for this and the 312 by gooseisland. This beer is excellent with a slice of orange. I love the exceptional clove taste and the fact that its actually brewed in belgium, very very easy to drink but too much of the clove taste starts to wear thin. Id recommend if you need a break from IPA's like I do sometimes, slip this in here and there."
"D: This is honestly one of the more drinkable beers for me, especially on tap. I would not pass this up anywhere, and if it wasn't for the price this would be my defacto fridge beer during the summer."
"Overall: This is a good wheat beer, there are some sweet and sour notes while drinking this beer. This has to be one of my go to witbier beer."
"Could drink many of these fast, but it'd get a bit boring."
"Yellow pour with a massvie white head. Definite sweet aroma and taste, with the orange peel and coriander strong up front. Some vanilla and wheatiness in the middle, mixed with clove and yeast. No real sourness to speak of. Wasn't really expecting such a good wit from a widely distributed beer."
"Coriander in the end, in the short aftertaste."
"Lightly cloudy appearance with a mild smell. Smooth intake - Spicy flavor. Mouthfeel is sharp with significant carbonation. Aftertaste is pleasant and short lasting. Easy to repeat. Overall pleasant - memorable. I have had this once from the tap - memory better than from the bottle."
"The original of its class, Hoegaarden is one of my all time favorites. Little flecks of yeast churn at the bottom of its cloudy yellow pour. The creamy white head has delicious aromas of cloves, bananas, and lemon citrus. It tastes initially tart and then sweetens to light grains, citrus fruit, and spices. Its light body is extremely refreshing and finishes on a lingering sweet note. Hoegaarden is quite possibly the most drinkable, summer thirst quenching beer I've ever had."
"Nikki"
"I could drink many of these in a night. Not overpowering alcohol, and i enjoy the taste. Some people might find the taste tiresome after a while though."
"hmm... the tap here might be watered down slightly. i've had it on tap elsewhere here in beijing, and had a much better impression."
"Pours the color of apple juice with a two finger head that has good retention and lacing. The smell is fantastic - sweet, fruity. The taste does not match the smell. I was expecting more taste given the smell. The taste is light, but what is there is good. A nice acidic flavor with the addition of something resembling apple. Would be great on a hot day."
"Fruity and light, but not as full a beer as I'd normally like. We did a blind taste-test with Blue Moon (designed after it), but could tell almost no difference besides color. Great with whatever you're eating, and with almost all company, besides the super beer-snobs and the super-anti-beer-snob."
"Pours a golden yellow color with thick foamy white head. Citrus aroma consisiting of lemon and orange peel, zest and other spices. Flavor very similar to aroma with a balance of peppery spice and citrusy lemon peel."
"I squeezed an orange slice over the beer. Pale cloudy pale yellow translucent color, big white head head, lasting. Flora aroma, hops, citrus. Lively taste, dry, smooth, a little bland, citrus taste-grapefruit, watered down taste."
"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable and very refreshing. This is a beer I would love to have around during those hot Houston summer days, but on my budget I don't have the means to get this beer that much. Highly recommended."
"The finish is pretty complex. It tries to be sweet, but the wheat is balanced nicely by the various spices. Only in the finish did I notice the orange peel."
"Hoegaarden is definitely on my top five list! It doesn't look like much, but it's REALLY good."
"D- I could easily drink this anytime. I look forward to pairing this with breakfast foods (@ night, of course)."
"Overall a nicely light and refreshing Wit and a staple of the style."
"It Had a fresh, citrus and coriander aroma to start off, along with an appropriately pale color. The taste was delectably spiced with notes of wheat and citrus, and was smooth going down, even smoother than those macrobrews that advertise their 'drinkability.' Could drink several of these in one sitting without adverse guttural response. Definitely a good choice for the price."
"Way drinkable, especially on hot days. Today was cold and rainy, but I still enjoyed it. My local grocery store has this beer for only $7.99 for a sixer, which seems like a great deal to me. Nearby on the shelf is Corona for $8.69. What a messed up world we live in. I shudder to think of the magnitudes more Corona sells over the cheaper Hoegaarden. Oh well, more for me!"
"Overall-a fine white ale, I've had better but this is one of the best you will find on tap in most areas. Solid job."
"I was pleasantly surprised.. this is a great beer. Pours a nice cloudy yellow as expected but this taste of it is just. unique. Very full in body and has a nice spicy kick to it while going down smooth. Very easy to drink and enjoyable all the way thru... would buy a sixer of this in future for sure."
"D: A good tasting, easy drinking Witbbier. Pleasantly complex. I could knock back a few of these and enjoy it."
"drinkability: Smooth and relaxing, drink in the heat"
"Very drinkable! Particularly on a hot day."
"It is to be noted that though this is this brewery's flagship ""original"" beer the real original recipe was taken by the original brewer to Texas where it eventually was laid to rest in peace. So sad. However, this is still one of the most famous witbiers available (I first tried it in New Zealand!) and was worth reviewing. Out of the bottle the liquid was a milky, straw gold color with a bright white head. The foam both retained and laced well throughout. The aroma was classic, orange zest, coriander and tangy wheat. The flavors were similar, though the first taste was floral hops and malt sweetness followed by the curacao orange zest and lemon flavors as well as coriander and cloves. The flavors were well blended with nothing dominating the others. The mouthfeel was very smooth and I found it great for quaffing on a hot summers day. This one was still a classic and for good reasons."
"Looks alot like a pulpy citrus drink with a thin white head. The smell is like spices, the taste is exceptionally spicy. no getting around that, a very pleasant taste. Has a bubbly feel on the tongue. So far this is easily the easiest drinkable white beer I've tried."
"4.0 D: Not bad at all, but not all that exciting. No off-taste is a big turn-on though."
"D - spices and non-clean finish detract from the drinkability, but overall a great beer."
"Creamy mouthfeel. Drinkable brew considering the style, but I just can't take the smell. Smell effects taste, and this one ruins it. I won't have this one again."
"Aroma is of citrus, coriander is pretty powerful. The taste is also dominated by the coriander which gives it a little too much spice. The balance of the tartness of the lemony citrus is thrown off because of it. Good amount of carbonation and medium to light body. I personally don't find this beer very drinkable, the flavour really isn't my thing, but I respect what it is."
"Very tasty brew. Could easily kick back and enjoy several of these any time of the day. I would consider this a gateway beer for anyone looking to branch out from American macros, light and smooth yet incredible flavor."
"Good beer, Ill have this again in the future, but it did not blow my mind."
"O- A thoroughly good beer. Quite drinkable and delicious. An easy drinking and approachable wit."
"Very very drinkable. Medium body. Terrific summer beer, no need for lemons, citrus additions."
"I bought a 12 pack of the stuff in bottles. I poured it (as directed on the bottle, lol) and was left with a nice gold coloured beer with a nice head on it. Took one sip of it and was like, wow, this is what a belgian white should taste like. Totally blows blue moon out of the water, maybe even into outer space. Mouthfeel is exceptional. As far as drinkability is concerned, I drank the whole 12 pack in 3 hours, so I think its right up there with the most drinkable beers out there. This beer is in my top 10 right now."
"You need to try this one."
"Try a 'normal' beer then have a taste of this::: the contrast (due to the spice) is quite 'loud'."
"Appearance is a hazy yellow color with a beautiful white head. Smells of wheat, coriander and a slight citrus/lemon scent. Tastes like a classic Belgian White, very smooth and refreshing with a slight tartiness in the finish. Mouthfeel is good, and this is an easy drinking beer. Its a great beer to enjoy on a hot summer day or while you're griling some food. One of my favorite Belgian beers."
"D - this is very easy to drink and makes for a great session beer. This is good out of the bottle and even better out of the tap."
"Enjoy!"
"D-4.0 A solid rep for a highly available Belgian spiced witbier. I LOVE THE LOOK AND TASTE BEST OF ALL."
"Overall a very drinkable beer, but its much more than that. The mouth feel and taste are excellent and it goes down very smooth. I know some bars put a wedge of lemon in it, but I usually have mine straight up. And if you get it in a bottle, pour it. Drinking it from a bottle is just not as good."
"D: It was Ok drinkability, I think there may have been a bit too much coriander."
"A pretty good summer witbier, would pair nicely with a plate of some fresh seafood."
"A thin mouthfeel and a very refreshing beer!"
"Prosit, MK"
"Pours hazy pale yellow with 1/2"" white uniform head that dissipates pretty slowly, leaving a continuous lace that turns spotty. Nice sour yeasty smell with a little tropical fruit and maybe a little pepper. Tastes about like it smells initially with a bittersweet finish that comes up suddenly right at the end of a short lived aftertaste. Smooth and creamy witha soft carbonation and a dry finish. This is an easy drinker that is light in carbonation and a nice flavor. Definitely a good summertime brew."
"Served in a standard pint. Poured a hazy, straw gold with a half inch bright, white head that eventually settled into a broken skim. Nose was somewhat nonexistent; some citrus and corriander. Taste consistent with nose, as well as pale wheat. Taste reminded me of a cross between Orangina and Zima. Mouthfeel was light and somewhat watery, with a clean, dry finish. Easy drinking lawnmower beer,but their are much better witbiers out there."
"This beer was my gateway into the world of Belgian brews. Tasty stuff, and a decent session beer that's a nice diversion from my usual."
"Mmmmm....tasty!"
"M/D - Light bodied and a touch thin on the feel. Well carbonated and very drinkable. Not the best wit out there, but a nice dependable stand-by."
"Popular beer for good reason; really not one of my favorite styles but definitely quaffable and the well-known benchmark for the Witbier style."
"Drinkability- Refreshing this beer really hits the spot."
"Very drinkable beer that's nice as a refresher on a hot day like most witbiers are. Appearance is a nice hazy golden with quite a bit of carbonation streaming upwards. Smells citrusy and herby with quite a bit of the yeast coming out as well. Mouthfeel is nice because of the fizzyness which I am a fan of. Very light on the tongue with a fair amount of sourness. Nice fruit tones as it goes down as well. Overall a very pleasing beer, nothing extraordinary but nice to wash down a summer meal on the deck with."
"Overall: Different refreshing and clean."
"Very quenchable and sessionable. A nice, better alternative to light beers."
"Overall, it's not bad but I have definitely had better. Like I said already, there are others that have a bit more flavor punch in them."
"Served from a bottle poured into an official Hoegaarden glass."
"D - The mouthfeel makes you want more, but the overdose on the spices keeps me away. I'm good with one of these, then it's on to something else."
"This beer is extremely drinkable...light, yet flavorful, a great easy-to-find choice for the warm summer months. This is one of the beers that got me into drinking better beer, and it's always a reliable beer to fall back on, especially for a session beer or in the warm weather."
"d: it's fine on a summer day and the ABV is certainly reasonable, but i would like a bit more adventure."
"Pours very cloudy, straw-coloured and milky, with a slick fading white head. Strong wheat twang in the aroma, yeasty, coriander, spicy phenolics. Sweet and prickly in the mouth, full bodied and round, slightly tart and citrusy. Mild and smooth, but definitely not boring. The ultimate refreshing beer. Spicy, complex, and smooth; I could do with three or four of these next time I mow the lawn."
"D. I could have a few of these. Not my fav. but at 4.8 its very managable."
"Notes: This is a pretty good brew but South Hamptom Double White has really been the only Witbier that I think I have ever brought more then once."
"D= Probably not the best Belgian wit I have had, but a damn fine one. An infinitely drinkable summertime ale!"
"D - If it wasn't so expensive I would drink it more often."
"D: The beer is soft, smooth, and highly drinkable. I would have liked more character from the citrus and a tad more spiciness, but the cleanness of the wheat itself defines drinkability. Very good for the style, I've had the high-and-mighty st. bernardus wit, and find few differences between it and hoegaarden. Even though it's relatively mass-produced, it's a beer you'll want to check out for a great witbier flavor. You'll want more than one."
"Pours a hazy but bright blonde color, with a fluffy bleach white head. Aromas present are lemon zest, coriander, and maybe a touch of vanilla. Taste is a bit lemony up front, with more dominant notes of clove, yeast, and slightly sweet fruitiness, the vanilla from the nose is nowhere to be found. Somewhat thin on body, but very clean on the palate, and very tasty. One could definately knock down a 6'er of these in one sitting during the summertime. Nice brew!"
"Finish is pleasingly tart and appetizing."
" Overall this is a pretty good beer. Drinkability is high since the flavor is so light and smooth. Its pretty widely available, so its a good example of the style that most people should be able to try."
"Drinks easy but a little too thin & mild."
"Mmmm, a tasty brew. This beer's cloudy golden color makes it look delicious and satisfying. You pull it in for a sip and a fruity, yeasty, orange peel and coriander aroma hits you getting you prepared for the taste. Citrus, fruit juice, yeasty, coriander, esters of banana and pineapple, faint bitterness towards the end. Thick and crisp. There are plenty of weak wheat beers out there but this one makes you feel like you a drinking clouds of rich spices and juice. I'm on cloud 9 with this one."
"On a hot summer day, nothing beats this beer. It has a great appearance as well, with a nice yellow color and a white foam. Easy to drink, with nice smooth flavors. Cheap, too."
"This is another beer and wit in paticular thatI've been consuming for years and one of the first after moving beyond the mass produced stuff. For one reason or another, I have not reviewed until today. Poured into pint glass at Tracks in Penn Station Manhattan whilst waiting for my LIRR train to celebrate my Mothers birthday. After taking out the lemon the barkeep placed on the pint. Partially hazy golden with a half finger head and decent lacing that faded to a half cap very quickly. Bottom half is almost clear. Nose is mild yeast and lemon and estery dash. Taste is moderate yeasty with lemon accents. Mouthfeel has spiced crispness at the start but weakens much to my chagrin.0r more succintly, it gets watery. Kinda chewy to start and carbonation remains with the legs. Unless my pallet has matured vastly or as many others have mentioned, th taste and body are not what I remember. Do recall reading they went back to old brewry and recipe but not sure. Not to say this is not a fine brew by any means and would recommend to all geeks and neophytes alike."
"Obviously there's a flood of Belgian wits or styled wits out there. This is not the best, nor is it the worst. There are far batter American made variations (there are also far worse). But, if you want one that satisfies all wit requirements with the added bonus of actually being from Belgium, Hoegaarden is your guy."
"pours an almost white palest yellow w/ a fluffy white head which sticks around for a bit leaving a nice broken lace in my chalice ; a bready, spice filled aroma, coriander and pepper(?), some fruits present, apple/oranges mostly ; a crisp slightly tart flavor quite similar to the smell, a soft malt flavor with lots of spice, a peppery front with some curacaou oranges and a powderish taste midway, some faint hop bitterness in the finish ; a light bodied brew, feels ""tingly"" on my tounge, plenty co2 ; a fantastic wit, and quite drinkable as well..."
"I admit, when I first saw this beer I called it like everyone else does hoe-garden when it is really who-garden. The brewers even put a handy phonetic spelling on the six-pack handle. Anyway, for a mass produced wit, this one has some decent flavor. Pours a bright canary yellow with a slight haze. Aroma is of fresh orange peel, a little floral, some coriander. Taste is smooth and bursting with citrus and zest. Great as a apertif and a good summer quencher, you can find it at most local grocers."
"D- The classic Belgian Wit. A very flavorful and refreshing summer beer. This six-pack didn't last very long. Cheers!"
"Pours a light yellow with a frothy white head that sticks around. Leaves some lacing as you drink. The smell is sweet, I picked up some banana and clove probably from the style of yeast, which was also present. This one has a big flavor, sweet, light and yeasty. A great balance, very bubbly and lots of carbonation. This one is a light and enjoyable beer with great flavor, I recommend checking this one out."
"I first tried this beer many years ago on a weekend trip to Brussels. It has now become one of the staples of my beer fridge. There's nothing crazy about it, but I think that is why I like it. It pours a nice cloudy white (hence the style) The mouthfeel is enjoyable, you can taste the body in the beer. The taste of the coriander is one of the most enjoyable aspects of the drink. I always recommend this beer to my friends who are interested in taking a step up to some more enjoyable beers."
"after poring the second one i added a razberry lambick about 10% this was the purfict 1 2 combo"
"Overall, this classic example of a classic style holds up to its many imitators. A solid go-to brew when in a bar who thinks Killians is adventurous."
"D - Melow and drinkable... Great example of a wheat beer..."
"The drink poured with a really murky, pale gold color. Decent lacing but the head evaporated quickly. The aromas were predominately citrus in flavoring and was not too overpowering. The taste was very sweet with a great, earthy aftertaste. Carbonation was excellent and helped the drink be nice and crisp. Overall, pretty good."
"Overall: very crisp, refreshing and really tasty. Great Witbier."
"D: Definitely drinkable on a hot summer day or a cold winter night. The Hoegaarden is one of the best example of a witbier on the market, I just wish it had just a little more flavor."
"i think this beer was very bad with a chemical aftertaste... my friend brought it over and was sayin how good it was, he brought over hoegaarden and i bought bodingtons iand i thought the bodington ale was much much better. this beer should not have this high of a rating on here, its even higher ten bass, come on now"
"D: This is reliable and tasty, but it's not that exciting. Honestly, it can be a bit underwhelming at times."
"I liked this one a lot more when I didn't like beer. It realy blew me away my first time. I couldn't get this here in Tenn. untill recently and I grabed it the first time I saw it. I wish I had only bought a single."
"Really outstanding drinkability and incredibly smooth and refreshing, this is an excellent wit I'll definitely try again."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied, very dry finish. That seems to be the theme with this beer. Dry. Not too bad, though I've had better wits before."
"Note: A band-aid off-flavor is often indicative of infected yeast. I think that's what's happening here. I'll review this benchmark Belgian Wit again at a later date."
"Drinkability- A very drinkable beer, most refreshing and delightful on a warm summer day."
"Drinkability is a must. Hoegaarden is a great beer to quench thirst with, but also a fun beer to drink at dinner and at live concerts. There's certainly nothing but fun that comes from this stuff."
"I did find this one very drinkable. It's not a heavyweight beer, so easy to drink more than one at a sitting. I find it a good beer for just enjoying and not having to worry much about high alcohol content, or being so heavy it feels you up. This is the kind of beer you drink with friends just for fun, and want something better than a mass market brand."
"Overall - a decent buy. This was on sale for 7.99/6 pack at Wegmans. It's a bit lacking in body and somewhat in taste (although the smell was pretty nifty) but it is an ok beer nonetheless and I may buy it again on occasion if I'm in the mood for a cheap Belgian wheat."
"This would appear to be the obvious wheat alternative to the Eurolagers. An OK wheat beer for those on a tight budget."
"Drinkability gets good ratings. A good example of a witbier."
"D: very good drinkability. prime example per style."
"The mouthfeel is very light and smooth, and the refreshing quality makes this a very drinkable beer."
"Fairly drinkable, however the lively carbonation is too much for me. I'll stop at one."
"12 oz bottle into glass. Pours a carbonated hazy yellow with a quickly diminishing white head. Smells earthy and spicy with some banana also. Tastes like it smells. Very light mouthfeel and very easy to drink. This is a very refreshing beer that has mass appeal."
"The pint pours a dull cloudy yellow color with a big smooth white head and thick lacing. The aroma is a clean and strong lemon and nutmeg, really a bright and unique masterpiece for the nose. The flavor is wheat and light citrus, fairly aqueous and very drinkable, but it also has a great creamy quality, like milk. Very fine carbonation. This seemed so much better than the recent version I had from a bottle. That was OK but this was really a tastey treat to me, and I don't typically go for witbiers particularly. I could have consumed many more had I not had an early morning schedule to contend with. A very nice surprise. Look for this on tap and enjoy."
"Pours a cloudy very pale golden color with a soft looking snow white head that leaves some patchy lacing as it falls.The nose is fresh and clean with just a touch of spice and yeast.Reminds me of tropical fruit bubble gum flavors with an assertive amount of hops and spicy yeast.The lightness of body and subtle dryness are enjoyable from start to finish.A highly drinkable Whitbier that is full of complexity and character.Good stuff!"
"Carbonation spices up on the palate nicely and balances really good with the acidity from the fruit. A favorite for sure."
"Poured in American pint glass, according to directions. Very pale yellow color, appropriately similar to wheat, but almost foggy; like the liquid left over after cooking seafood. Disappointing head that disappeared immediately, though it had nice coloration. Creamy in texture, though not very full bodied. Clean flavour, sweet and well-rounded, with a hint of faint bitterness in the middle. Finishes well without leaving an aftertaste; cleanses the palate. Wouldn't reccommend for heavier foods, but excellent to pair with lighter fare"
"D: This is a good Witbier. Very drinkable because it has some good flavors that go along with the summer. I enjoyed it."
"This beer poured a pale straw color, cloudy as it is unfiltered. It had a nice white head. The smell had a very strong citrus sent. The taste matched the smell with citrus and a hint of sweetness. Mouthfeel was good. Overall the drinkability of this beer was good. It is crisp and refreshing. But it also has good flavor. It is a good summer beer."
"*Scratch, scratch*"
"Poured a hazy bright yellow straight out of 12 oz bottle. Served with a wedge of orange. Smell was mildy effervescent with notes of clove an banana. Taste was really good; mild-mannered and sweet, with clove, banana and citrus notes. Overall, just a good, tasty wheat beer. I definitely recommend."
"D: Very drinkable because of the light body, well-balanced and smooth flavor, and pleasant aroma. It's sessionable, too. This style isn't one of my favorites, but I'll probably be picking up some Hoegaarden again."
"Hoegaarden is one of my favorite Belgian white ale's. I first was introduced to it while visiting Jacksonville, Fl. at the European Street Cafe and now it is available here in little ole Tn. Pours a nice head. Smell is fruity with the coriander coming through. Apperance is cloudy white after all it is a white ale. Taste is very good no bitterness or aftertaste just the coriander and citrus like flavors coming through with slight hop undertones."
"D = Very refreshing. Great beer for the hot Summer days. Highly drinkable (almost a 5)."
"This is a great example of an original Belgian staple beer. One of the best Belgians available in the US! Great head, with a fruity and balanced body. Crisp coriander finish. There seems to be a hint of orange or citrus intermingled in the body some where in the middle as well."
"D - Very light + Crisp, refreshing flavor + Clean finish = a very drinkable beer."
"Could be a bit off from the age: I proclaim it a decent wit."
"All in alla drinkable brew, b ut overpriced, even as an import at $10 a six-pack. It's a good beer, but not a real good value."
"D: A session brew if you like these flavors. I know they can be offensive to some, but I enjoy it on occasion."
"I really like this beer and it remains one of my favorite session ales as well as a good beer to pass on to those guests wanting something a little different. While it is on the pricey side, ultimately it's a decent value considering the product. By far my favorite witbier."
"a good respectable beer, but honestly it seems watered down. needs to be dialed up a notch. in anycase though it's a very drinkable tasty beer."
"Beautiful lemon yellow colour in the glass. Cloudy with very little head. Lavender and orange nose. Crisp dry finish. Spicey with hints of orange taste. Good hops. Good mouthfeel. A great summer beer to quench the thirst with. Well worth having regularly."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable - light and clean with a nice citrus flavor. Quite good."
"d - this is intensely drinkable. not only does it have that great spicy smell and taste, but it's light, has a low abv, and a very clean finish. Of all the beers I have reviewed I always find some reason why I probably wouldn't session with them, with the exception of maybe a few pilsners. This beer I can finally say would be a great session beer for me. It's something I could see myself drinking in any situation and enjoying many of. Finally a 5 for drinkability :D"
"D: Truly thirst quenching...very drinkable. A nice spring/summer refresher. A nice example of a witbier."
"D: A great drink for a sunny afternoon outside."
"Very easy to drink, nice and refreshing. This is a great beer for the warmer months."
"THE classic white ale that spawned just about every summer beer in the U.S."
"D - Drinkability is very high on this brew. While easily found in most places I have seen, the smell and taste always make this a winner. Price is very reasonable too. Plan on throwing multiple sixes down throughout the summer."
"pours a creamy golden, very hazy with rising, fairly dense head. head drops away fast but remains a thin layer on top. smell is very citrusy. taste follows- well balanced malt, citrusy and slight bitter hops. seems very light, the tiniest bit fizzy, good balance between a citrusy bite and great smoothness. leaves mouth feeling refreshed and ready for more."
"Pours just a slightly hazy extremely light straw color with tons of dense white head. The aroma bursts forth candy sweetness with tones of lemon, coriander, vanilla and a whole host of other spices. It doesn't come across as being especially ""zesty"" just herbal and earthy. On the palate, things become quite a bit more zesty, as the spices truly are all over the place. Herbal menthol notes really dominate, followed by citrus, chamomile, and coriander. The finish is dry and mouthfeel is highly carbonated but creamy. Overall, a very interesting beer and a complex blend of spices give it supreme drinkability, and I imagine a good match for a variety of foods."
"On tap. A classic white. THE classic white. Pours cloudy gold with a large frothy head. Aroma of bananas, yeast, citrus and spice. Taste much the same. Crisp, refreshing finish. Hoegaarden was the first Belgian beer that I really liked, and opened up a world of new and exciting beer to me. tastes like late Spring/Early summer. Wasn't my first. Won't be my last."
"D: Could easily drink a 12er on a warm summers night but would rather pound a Pulaner or German Blonde."
"Liquid sun shine, poured into its signature tumbler glass. Color was light yellow and hazy with a foamy white head. It has an inviting aroma of wheat, citrus, and spice. The flavor is much the same with a wonderful balance of wheaty malts, Belgian yeast, dried orange peel and coriander. Nice sweet/tart finish with good carbonation and a medium body. This is a great summer time beer and one of my favorite wheat beers."
"Overall: crisp, tasteful and perfect for a warm spring day"
"D - Very drinkable, went down easy both before and during a meal."
"Excellent example of the style."
"Very crisp and refreshing. I found that I hit the bottom of the glass before I was even done analyzing it. Extremely drinkable; flavorful, but not filling. I could do quite a few of these without a problem."
"D: Pretty drinkable, and quite enjoyable."
"Will remember this beer during summer cook outs , or mowing the lawn."
"The mouthfeel is creamy and slightly bready filling the mouth and sticking behind after the beer has been swallowed. I could easily drink a 12 pack of these beers without thinking twice, and I have. Great summertime Barbecue beer that goes down easy and wont fill you up or leave you bloated."
"Note:Excellent brew with a nice warm spice,all in all worth drinking."
"My favorite easy to find import; the beer that non beer bars have for me."
"A fine beer. Just so drinkable and refreshing. The prototypical Witbier."
"Very good brew, well worth it, worth the price."
"This is a great white ale. it has a good look especially in the traditional hexagonal glass that the bottle suggests to drink from. The aroma seems to be quite pleasant. The taste of this beer has always pleased my taste buds, Enough to rate this beer as one of my favorites on my list. It is very easy to drink considering it is only 4.9% alcohol. The texture of this beer is pretty nice, not to thick, nice on a hot day. This has been one of my favorite beers and i think this one can change the average domestic beer drinkers perspective on higher quality beers."
"D- Easy drinking, well-balanced warm weather beer. This beer was made for Texas, where it is often used as a porch cool-me-down."
"Poundable in the Summer heat. Someone told me this tasted of dishwater so I have put off tasting this beer for a while. Decided to give this beer a an honest chance tonite and was rewarded with a refreshing brew!"
"This beer was served a nice tan color with a creamy head and an orange slice. It had a crisp and refreshing taste and very clean finish. I hade it paired with a whole wheat pasta dinner and the wheat in the beer came through very very well. I enjoyed this beer greatly"
"D: Very refresing, especially on a warm summer day. Much like a glass of lemonade."
"This beer poured a pretty cloudy yellowish-white with a single-finger fluffy head that lasted for the whole beer. The smell is yeasty with some citrus and banana. The taste starts off with some sweet citrus that fades into some clove spiciness and finishes with some fruitiness. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated with a decent thickness. The sweetness and fruitness makes for a very drinkable beer."
"Overall this is a very nice beer, but this wit just doesn't do it for me. There is very little to absolutely no honey, vanilla, coriander, or orange-fruityness aroma or taste. I was expecting a lot more."
"A great brunch beer."
"The taste leaves a bit to be desired...I liken it to biting into an wheat-coated orange slice that's already been sucked dry: the flavor's just not all there. Some orange peel and a bit of juicy hops try desperately to leave an aftertaste, but the overly carbonated, thin body limits the enjoyment. I can see myself enjoying a Hoegaarden on a warm spring day, but I'm glad my girfriend bought the six pack and not me."
"D - this is an excellent drinkable beer, enough said."
"fresh bottle...just showed up in the market...best by date of 4/28/09....it is 2/23/08"
"D - It's a good beer. It is probaby best with foods that are not going to overpower. Maybe some white fish and breads. Also, probably better enjoyed in the summer months than when it's cold outside."
"A classic, but just tastes similar to every hefeweizen and wit I've had before. Not bad, but nothing unique other than the freakishly long lasting head. Coriander, clove and lemon tastes, light bodied, and easy to drink if you like those flavors in beer, which I don't particularly. Good if you like the style."
" I would much rather have a Hoegaarden than, say a Bud and I could drink as many of them both."
"This beer was a very unique and view changing experience for me that I will always remember as the brew that turned me into a beer drinker and I highly recoment it. It brought me into the world of beer and every new beer I taste is always compared to this one in my mind as a factor on how I like it. With the exception of Blue Moon....if a beer isnt cloudy and full of sediment like Hoegaarden is...I put it right back on the shelf."
"D - Good kegger for a special occasion, if you could get it."
"D: I could drink a bunch of this if my mind didn't know better. An extremely complex beer that reveals more and more character as it's consumed."
"Overall definitely a refreshing drinkable beer and lately it has been on sale at one of the local package stores, so I have been drinking more of it. Probably more appropriate for a hot summer day though."
"This is a good beer to drink in the hot summer months after you just cut your lawn. Its cool and refreshing and has a nice drinkability and mouthfeel."
"Pale straw color with a thin white head. Some decent lacing here. Smells of lemon and spices such as cinnamon and coriander. Taste is watery, with some classic witbier ester notes and too much spice. Mouthfeel is overcarbonated and thin. Pretty easy to drink if they're cold, but a far cry from the better witbiers."
"Drinkability: Added one bottle as part of a mixed 6 pack. I would definitely have this again. Low in alcohol this would make for a good summer quaffer that I will look out for in the summer when it turns hot."
"I drank a lot of hops today and wanted a change. I always have a Belgian Witbier around for nights like these. This one is a very respectable Witbier and always easy to find at a good price too. Along with being very drinkable"
"Solid all around beer. It's not too hard to find, and always enjoyable."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Chimay chalice. Pours a murky yellow with a slight wheat head that disappeared quickly but left decent lacing down the glass. Aroma is bready, with slight spiciness and banana. Taste is yeasty with a slight banana twinge to it. Mouthfeel is fuller than expected with a dry finish to it. A very drinkable brew. Definitely wont be the last one I drink."
"Poured this beer into a pint glass, It poured a golden yellow color with a white head that dicipated quickly, But had a good amount of carbonation. The smell of this beer is wheat,wheat,wheat and yeast. The taste is also very much wheat. But for a witbier, it is very clean and crisp, doesn't leave much of an aftertaste. The mouthfeel of the beer is very light and watery, but with a clean aftertaste. The drinkability of this beer is very drinkable. I could use this as a summer sessionable all summer long."
"Notes: A great witbier that's easy to drink, and pretty delicious if you enjoy the style. The only drawback is that it cost a little more than it should. I also hear that if you drink it in Belgium that it has more of a flavor kick that in does here. I guess it loses a little something on the plane ride over here. Nonetheless it's an enjoyable witbier."
"The bottom line: I have Hoegaarden on occasion because bars which are slightly upscale tend to carry it. It's not one of my favourites in the style, and it won't shock you in any way, but it's a perfectly tasty, and serviceable example of its style. Just be sure that you get the lemon out of the beer ASAP if it's served that way."
"White color. Nice spicy flavor. The spiciness fades as you drink leaving a crisp wheat flavor."
"Did i mention that i love this beer?"
"D= probably very drinkable if it hits your fancy at the moment-- very popular in Belgium."
"D- Good, a very solid beer. Actually, the first beer that I ever had in a pitcher ( what a treat)."
"Pours a cloudy yellow color with a copious amount of ultra white head. Smell is banana, yeasty, and some light fruity aromas, but mostly this one is about spice and clove dominates. Taste is crisp, and fresh with a limited amount of carbonation for this style. A good beer for the style, but overall it did not wow me."
"Drinkability: Not a bad beer, but nothing special. Wouldn't buy it again as I'm not keen to the style."
"OA: A very drinkable non-offending beer that will serve as a great wittbeer for the masses. Refreshing as a summer breeze."
"It has a classic Belgian yeasty smell to me. The taste has a faint citrus to it and coriander in the finish of the drink. In the mouth it is crisp and clean and light. It is a very easy drinking beer and it has a well in the middle where the bubble rise from the bottom to the top to release their carbonation. Cool."
"Overall, an enjoyable beer."
"After poured into a glass, it developed a large foamy head that went down relatively quickly. It had a nice light smell of a fruit, I would say banana. It had a nice crisp, refreshing taste. Leaves a pleasant aftertaste. It reminded of sponge cake for some reason. The beer itself didn't feel too heavy nor too light. All of this made it surprisingly easy to drink. A great beer, that I would definitely pick up again."
"I used to view this as the perfect Summer beer, but then I began to explore more beers, and its status has paled somewhat. I'm sure most people have tried hoegaarden because of its ready availability, but here are a few notes. Typical clouded gold wheat beer appearance in the ridiculously big glass. Large bubbly white head leaves some lacing. Aroma of spice (coriander) and lemon. Crisp grainy taste with citrus accents, packaged in a fairly light body with moderate carbonation. Refreshing, but far from spectacular."
"Pretty good, but not my favorite beer. The color is a very pale yellow and was served with slices of lemon in it. A little too light for my tastes but very popular among my friends. It's quite nice and drinkable but I probably wouldn't buy it for myself."
"Hoegaarden pours a cloudy light white-lemon color with a fluffy milk white head. It smells of sweet lemon zest and vanilla along with some spicy yeast. It is light, creamy, and refreshingly carbonated as it goes down. The taste is lightly sweet vanilla and lemon. The wheat and yeast are also light, and it finishes with a bit of spice. Quite refreshing and very drinkable."
"All in all, a solid wit. This is a GREAT beer to suggest to those who are new to good beer, as it is a solid first step into what Belgian beer can be like."
"The beer looks good with a pale, cloudy body and a wonderful dense snow white head. The smell is great, fresh wheat with a touch of orange zest. The taste is surprisingly mild mannered and easygoing with light carbonation. There is just a hint of coriander and orange on the finish that is really pleasurable. It's exceptionally easy to drink."
"D--Very nice beer if you are in the mood. I might get tired of it. I don't find anything about it that makes me want to come back and have more of it. Maybe if I had it in Belgium it would be different (freshness of this would certainly matter and make these flavors more pronounced)."
"Pours a pale slightly cloudy yellow color with a decent lace of head. Smell is all wheat and not much else. Taste is that of other wheat beers, lots of phenol flavor .mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and crisp with a slight dryness toward the end. I'm not a fan of wheat beers, because of the phenol flavors, but I tried to be impartial and so this beer comes out a tad above average for me. If I had to drink a wheat beer this would a decent choice."
"D - This is a very easy to drink beer I could easily drink this all night a true session beer"
"D- Easliy could drink many of these"
"Poured a nice light straw color, more pale than golden, with a great head but little lacing. Has a nice clean scent, hints of wheat and citrus. The flavor is overwhelmed by citrus, though. It's very light and refreshing, but tastes like a couple of orange peels were squeezed right into it before drinking. Goes down smooth. I'd drink another if bought for me, but I wouldn't get it on my own."
"The ""mouthfeel"" is what makes this beer for me. SO GOOD! my only beef with this beer is that it is grossly overpriced, but all for the better as i feel i must treat myself to it on special occasions. It is a very full bodied Witbier. Very tasty, but not too fruity. Smooth as silk. If the allure of gold could be transferred into a taste, it would be very similar to Hoegaarden, i am certain."
"Sampled again, this time on-draft at Dundee's. The lace sticks to the glass, and it remains good all around IMO, although not as good as I remembered when I reviewed the bottle about eight months ago. Still, I had a hard day and wanted to mellow out on a light fruity beer. At Dundee's, I thought it was cool to see it served in it's hexagonal glass."
"If you like witbiers, this is one for you. It has a nice, cloudy appearance and a decent and not overwhelming aroma. It has that orangey flavor typical of most witbiers. It's very refreshing and tasty. This isn't one of the most impressive beers ever brewed. but nonetheless worth your time."
"I am drinking this beer for the first time today. Very light color with a cloudy look, almost hefewisen looking, almost. A bit of a tangy aroma not much different than any avg beer. Mouthfeel is a bit thick, almost too thick for as light as it drinks. Smooth going down, i dont really taste much but the wheat and hops. A bit of an aftertaste but not unpleasant, just a bit bitter."
"D: Light and refreshing, but I think it is a little overrated. It was good, don't get me wrong, but it was not as incredible as others. Very easy to drink, but I wouldnt go out of my way to spend the 8 or 9 bucks on a six pack."
"D: This beer is quite drinkable, if you like the style. I don't, but I won't hold that against a good beer."
"You have to like this style (and a lot of people don't) but if you do, this one is a winner."
"D- refreshing and tasty,fits style to perfection, very enjoyable and recommended"
"The taste is citrusy w/ hints orange and peach, and the wheat sediments make it very smooth, although it is not a complex flavor at all and the spices, which overpower the wheat, are still barely noticable. Because of this you can just sit back and keep pouring it down your gullet. For the price (almost $10 for a six pack where I live) and its easy drinkability I love this beer and, believe it or not, this is one of my most favorable reviews."
"Poured from the bottle a pale white color with a touch of yellow. Head white as snow. Small amount of lacing. Smelled of citrus, banana and honey? Taste was that of banana with a citrus hint. Kind of refreshing and light. Almost a little bland though. Easy to drink in that there is nothing strong here at all. I didn't detect much aftertaste at all. Not highly recommended, but it's not bad either."
"D - This is a nice wit. Good wheat and citrus flavors."
"Drinkability: A suitable witbier, but the flavors are so light as to bypass refreshing and wind up being bland."
"Poured from bottle, 10 months ahead of best-by date 10/16/08. Pours very light golden honey, with white undertones and some swirling sediment. Head retention was light with trim around the glass, updated regularly by large carbonation bubbles. Yeasty and floral aroma, can't smell the citrus very much. Spices are supported by the carbonation and overpower the wheat. The carbonation fades, and the flavor left behind in your mouth is the citrus and banana. I find this beer to be a bit watery and high on the carbonation. A little less carbonation and more body would make for a more drinkable beer. Disclaimer: I haven't found a white that I really enjoy (although I do like all other types of wheat)."
"Poured from a bottle with a 12.01.08 drink by date. The color is a nice golden honey that is cloudy and topped by a nice one finger white head. The head sticks around very well. The aroma is fairly week but has mostly a banana smell. There is also some bread with honey aromas in the glass too. The taste has some mild spiciness to it. There is also a hint of orange that is described on the label. The mouthfeel is refreshing and light."
"Taste is bannanas, yeast, and a bit of lemon/citrus zest. Interesting, quaffable, but nothing to write home and rave about. It's unique look is probably not a plus, but it's definitely weird."
"Overall I wavered between a 2.5 and a 3 on drinkablity and I gave it the 3. I guess for the type beer it is, it's acceptable but not outstanding or very memorable. I won't be picking this up again, but for those who enjoy this style of beer it's probably worth at least a look."
"D: Not a bad wit but there are better ones out there and for less."
"Overall - I personally prefer Hefe Weizen to Witbier, so I can't help but rate this below my favourite Hefes. Hoegaarden is a good beer, but not the best Witbier I have tried."
"D - A pretty good summer thirst quencher."
"Tipped most of the bottle into a working glass then rolled the bottle before pouring. The glass was filled with a very pale, hazy yellow and capped off with a foamy white head. The head could have stuck around longer for a wheat, but still nice, and left a ring and and small patches along the side. The aroma is citrusy, like lemongrass, and spicy/ bready. The taste follows similarly. Light, citrus sweetness hits the tongue first, followed by a very balanced and mild bitter bite. The finish is somewhat refreshing and the aftertaste is again a sweet, malty lemon flavor. The mouthfeel is light, but not watery and the carbonation is very fitting, not very heavy. Hoegaarden is very nicely balanced, light and refreshing enough to be easily drinkable. It's a good representation of the citrusy, wheaty characteristics of the Witbier style. Very nice, sessionable macro offering. A very good intro to wheat beers."
"Followed the instructions printed on the label: poured the first 2/3 into the glass as normal, swirled the remainder, and poured the rest in. This made for a beautiful creamy head that lay atop a cloudy and extremely pale yellow. Very nearly white. Had some nice lacing, but had some trouble sticking. Delicious lemony smell with spices. Taste was excellent, lots of fruit and spices, most notably lemon, with a nice yeasty flavor. Medium bodied. Reminds me a bit of Delirium Tremens, though this would probably be much better suited for the summer and Delirium Tremens for winter, as this has far less alcohol."
"Drinkability: A solid beer, and very sessionable. There are better wits around, but this is easy to find and it's really quite decent."
"Original of the species. I've enjoyed this beer for over 15 years. Light yellow color, white head, and smells of spice and orange. I originaly found this beer at Trader Joes for cheap and very pleasantly surprised with the quality. Tastes like it smells and is very drinkable. Highly recommended."
"I first had this beer while on vacation and in a hot tub, and it did not disappoint. A nice light golden beer with a white foamy head, Hoegaarden is very tasty, with a nice melange of flavors and mild spices. Orange was most prominent. It is decidedly less spicy than other Belgian-style ales I've had, but also more accessible too. Its taste is smooth yet somewhat bubbly, nice and crisp. It is very refreshing, a terrific way to beat the heat, or to kick back with a few on a porch. Terrific in warm weather and great tasting. A really good find."
"D: A nice summer refresher, nothing too complex but a nice change from when your sick of pale ales!"
"Review translated from french 5-26-2008."
"I do enjoy this beer, I am a sucker for belgium whites. This beer has a good sense of spice to it, not bad, overall this is not my favorite but it does rank up there as far as good belgium beers go. I am looking forward to drinking the other selections they have to offer."
"D: I could not have been happier to be drinking this beer and it went down easy and smooth with plenty of strong flavors to savor."
"1000 light years better than Blue Moon, I wish this beer could supplant the ubiquity of that awful drek."
"Had this one tap last night, served in a pint glass. A very light colored, cloudy beer. A small white head with a bit of lacing on the glass. Smell is light with a bit of lemon. The taste is also very light with lemon notes and a bit of sourness. Very smooth mouthfeel. The is a very drinkable beer due to the very light flavors. Very nice."
"A true classic worthy of its reputation."
"Of the many white beers out there on the market, this is definitely one of the best I've ever had. Great blend of orange and coriander make this one of the most drinkable and enjoyable beers. I enjoy it with an orange peel, which helps bring out and accentuate the citrus-like taste, although drinking it alone really helps you appreciate the exceptional taste. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of white beers. From what I've heard - and not like this makes much of a difference - it has won the beer cup in its category many times - a consistent winner. Although $8.99 for a sixer is a little pricey, this is worth it without a doubt... one of my favorite of all time..."
"Was pleasantly supprised, considering this was my Belgian style, though it had come highly recommended by others to me. I would consider it more translucent that cloudy, being that i didn't see differences in the opacity of the beer while drinking. The head stared out as soapsuds and dissipated quickly but only to a ring around the collar that fell with the drink. Was supprised at the mildness, expecting a more robust and forceful taste, but was not under whelmed. The orange tone comes threw very well and mixes well with the taste of other botanicals. Smell was a bit lacking to me, though present. Would recommend this beer, would consider this as an introducer into beer for those who dont drink beer often or at all, especially those who dont like beer for the bitter beer taste that can be present which, in my opinion beer has a lack of."
"It has good balance. Smooth wheat and carbonated, but not over done on either end. But to be honest, I expect a more robust flavor out of my white ales. Solid, but overrated in some ways."
"D- Very drinkable and clean. This one goes down good and goes down easily. Great session beer."
"This is a great summer beer but is so drinkable, complex, and versatile I'll be drinking this year round. In short, very refreshing but complex beer (love those Belgians!) that is rapidly turning into my ""go-to"" brew."
"D: This is the second time that I have tried this beer, and was a bit reluctant after my first tasting. Age apparently has made me a bit mellower as I was delightfully surprised about this beer and it will fit nicely into my drinking rotation."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Great flavor and satisfying consistency."
"D - real easy to have more than one"
"Good beer. Not my fav. But I wouldn't kick many blondes out of bed and this one is no different."
"Poured from the tap into a pint glass, beer is a hazy pale yellow color with a thin head that dies out almost immediately leaving no lacing. Smell is not overwhelming, but is like one would expect from a witbier - coriander and cloves with a hint of citrus. Somewhat weizen like. The taste is much the same as the smell -sweet with spices and citrus, but not as enjoyable as some others of the style. Mouthfeel is pretty light in body with minimal carbonation. Overall, an easily drinkable beer but not an overly desirable one. Worth trying but nothing I will be revisiting anytime soon."
"Drinkablility is excellent, especially on a hot humid day. Low ABV and the clean dry finish leave you wanting ""just one more."" No overpowering flavors to get cloying after several... just a refreshing thirst-quenching brew!"
"All in all this is an excellent beer. Excellent head, taste, and highly drinkable. Not much else to say."
"Mouthfeel is crisp, dry, and refreshing. A light bodied beer, but I'm impressed with the refreshing mouthfeel and adequate carbonation. Drinkability is good also, I could drink these all day without ever getting tired of them, but also without ever having an excellent beer all day either."
"D- This is a nice and drinkable beer that I think few would find offensive or difficult. It doesn't stand out to me as something to search out, but I can see this working well with hot wings (recommended by others) or a salmon BLT."
"I've got a warm spot for this brew. It helped me through my year when I didn't have access to craft beer in Korea. This is a great import."
"Good flavors for this witbier but nothing really exceptional about it. This beer doesn't really have anything that makes it stand out. Just an over all decent beer."
"Bottle. Pours a straw yellow. Aroma is subdued coriander. Flavor is the same, some spices come out that aren't apparent in the aroma. Light, refreshing, goes well with several foods, from a great steak to a pizza. Good choice after a round of golf in the hot sun."
"This is one of my favorite styles. Poured into a pint glass. Cloudy, light tan color. I like the look of this. Nice citrus smell. Citrus taste also. Very refreshing. Drinkability is good - goes down easily. Great for a hot summer day or when you want something crisp. One of my go-to beers when I want a ""good"" beer out somewhere."
"Got this on tap at the Yardhouse in San Diego, CA. Was served with a thin cotton white head. Body was a light pale yellow, looks like a fresh squeezed lemonade. Im so glad they didn't put a stupid orange or lemon on it. Smells were sweet, lemony, citris, V8 type vegetable smells. Taste was a bit like banana taffy with hints of clove spice flavors. Mouthfeel was a bit of tingle on the tip of my tongue and a light dry acidic note. Overall a pretty good beer. I Love White Ales, so i might be a little bias on this one."
"Yellow, cloudy body with with a thin white head which stays with the beer all the way down. The smell is not particularly stong, but was sweet. Tastes strongly of orange, with some lemon too. Goes down very easily, and would make for a perfect beer in the summer time."
"D: Yep. It seems like I see it more out-and-about and compared with the other stuff, this is the choice when no microbrewed Hefes or Wits are available"
"Appearance is hazed light straw with a thick crisp head. Smell is mainly citrus that is crisp and clean. Taste of citrus, spice and wheat. mouthfeel is light with a good amount of carbonation that makes it crisp and refreshing. Seems a little watered down with the overall flavor, but still a very good summer brew."
"Bottom line: It's been a while since I last had some of this and I don't recall it being *this* light on the flavours. In my book, it's just so so. There are lots of others in the style that please my palate more."
"On this time that I actually looked to drink in order to review it, I was more apt to notice that I really didnt enjoy it nearly as much as I first thought. The smell and first sip are on the top of any list but I think the drinkability is where it really falls apart over time."
"The quintessential witbier -- maybe not what it once was from what people say, but still a classic."
"Poured white into a Hoegaarden glass, like seven up soft drink I thought at first; light honey hue in the glass, cloudy, murky, generously carbonated. Generous fluffy white head, two fingers with good retention. Smell of fruit rind, citrus. Taste is refreshingly zesty with marmalade, a touch of spice, lemon lime. Smooth mouthfeel with fullness and a very satisfying peach finish, citrus, a bit of sweet apricot too. Overall, I never realized just how pleasant this beer is until I sat down to review it, I'd be happy to have another right now."
"Hoegaarden Original White Ale pours a cloudy light yellow white with a frothy head that lingers in the glass. The aroma is yeast and citrusy corriander with a hint of sweet wheat. The flavor is crisp and refreshing, very slightly tart with more coriander and slightly chalky yeast. The hops are all but nonexistent, and the beer is very smooth and refreshing."
"Pours a pale white-ish yellow. The head is small and pure white. The smell is sort of lemony. Taste is of a slight Belgian style yeast, with a bit of peppery flavor, and lemon. The mouthfeel is pretty good, with a proper level of carbonation. Very drinkable, smooth and light."
"Taste: Light and refreshing with a nice lemony citrus introduction getting stronger on the midpalate. Hints of coriander and a light, balancing malt? Finishes crisp with a sort of biting feeling in the back of the throat."
"Overall not the best witbier ive had to date but still an excellent example of the style, even if its not the original Celis Hoegaarden. Recommended."
"One of the best anod more refreshing beers, wonderful as an aperitif or just alone in hot days."
"Drinkability- Hoegaarden is always a good choice in a witbier."
"I have noticed that many beeradvocate members have noticed this reduction in quality, and I feel as time moves on and all the older batches are off the shelves, the less favorable reviews will start rolling. In the mean time, you're gambling on every Hoegaarden you pick up."
"This one is not for me,will have a hard time trying again."
"I wanted to rate this beer on the first six pack, but liked it enough that I drank them all too fast and had to buy another six pack on a different day in order to remain objective during my review. That's a good sign by me."
"I tried this beer on August 30, 2007 at 'Houston's Steak and Ribs' in Toronto. The beer was a hazy yellow colour with a very white head that persisted throughout the experience. The aroma was a combination of wheat and malt. The mouthfeel was slightly carbonated with some medium-bodiedness. The flavour was wheaty with hints of malt. A good beer, but not a great beer."
"into the world of great tasting craft beers. I prefer it in the bottle than on the tap."
"All and all, one of my favorites beers. Too bad its not generally available in Iowa."
"Feels dry...expected. Drinks good. Yum."
"Poured into a pint glass. Wow, another nice rocky wheat beer head that stuck around for the duration. The label mentions coriander and orange peel, which are definitely noticeable along with other aromatics which I'm not sophisticated enough to identify. :-) Very enigmatic color...not even translucent. Easy to drink, reasonable ABV...definitely ""sessionable."""
"Drinkability: While I vowed I wouldn't drink another wit beer I got stuck with this during a pairing event. After having tasted a couple of American versions, this was definitely an improvement and from what I can tell, a good example of this beer style. Flavors were better balanced. The coriander (celery flavor) didn't dominate like the American version I've tasted, but still not my cup of tea though."
"Served to me with a light rim of head that did not go anywhere for a long time. Color was a thick, deep, cloudy yellow. Smell was great: bananas, citrus, and yeast. Taste did not dissapoint: pale malts, very little hop presence, and sweet flavors of orange, spice, and maybe even some banana. A delicious, refreshing witbier. Served to me quite cold, which was refreshing, but the flavors really came out when it warmed up a bit. Little carbonation and a medium body. Quite drinkable. A full beer that is not filling."
"D: One of my favourite all-time wits, one of the classics, immensely drinkable, a great summer or brunch beer."
"The aroma is perfumey with an instantly enticing spice and pepperiness from the Saaz hops. Hints of lemon zest and orange are also noticeable.The palate is smooth, medium bodied with a mild sparkling sharpness and refreshing bite. It has a tart citrusy quality to the flavor, with a peppery spice to it. There is an orange and a mild honey taste that provides a smooth relaxing sweetness. There’s some acidity and a mild bitterness in the finish."
"Nice summer brew, but a bit too sweet and watered down from previous years."
"This doesn't show up too often around here, so whenever it does I grab it! It has been a while since I had it, and maybe I had too high expectations. It poured up light straw colored and cloudy with a thick white head. I smelled yeast and some fruitiness. It was very smooth, and the hops were a nice compliment to the wheat malt and spice. I thought it was a bit thin, but otherwise, I enjoyed it. But, I was disappointed. I had somehow expected more orange in the flavor."
"Compared to the bottled Hoegaarden, my draft didn't seem quite as crisp, still it was pretty tasty. There's a big sweet creamy flavor with notes of Belgian spice and lemon. I kept waiting for the flavor to really open up, but it never came."
"D - Great summer brew and a taste that hit the spot. I kept coming back for more. Would keep a six of this on hand quite often"
"Hoegaarden was my favorite wheat beer hands down and my favorite session beer. When I ran into it at the a national grocery store I was very glad to see that a relatively quality import (and the original witbier) was enjoying mass market appeal. I have found that sense Hoegaarden's growth into a national grocery staple the beer has changed. The last several six packs I have bought were not completely cloudy as they should and clam to be and the taste seemed to be watered down. I am disappointed...did Hoegaarden change their brewing standards for US exports to appeal to the mass market and compete with Budweiser, Corona, and the rest?"
"Pours a hazy yellow with a thin, but large head. The smell is rather spicy with some banana and hint of citrus. The taste is a pleasant mix of Belgian spices, fruit, and a bit of hop bitterness. An average mouth feel, quite drinkable, a good session beer, and good one for a hot afternoon."
"Poured cloudy yellow with white creamy head. Very thin mouthfeel. Proper amount of carbonation. Notes of fruit (lemon and orange), and also spicy. Pretty good beer, though a bit on the expensive side. Nice lacing. Flavor really grows on you. Good beer that is now ubiquitous."
"Its a decent brew, but there are better examples out there."
"Even worse, this replaced Bully Porter at my corner bar. It may be time to find a new corner bar."
"Drinkability: Something about the taste I just couldn't get into, but by no means is this a bad beer."
"Not much of a wow sitting in front of the computer, but damn refreshing at a summer picnic on a sweltering day."
"Great beer for summertime drinking. It seems to go naturally with outside dining or patio/deck bar settings. Good classic white ale, with citrus notes and good cloudy straw white coloration. Very fresh and young tasting, which makes it drink easily. A classic beer that can be savored over and over."
"This beer was pricey but since I love white ales anyway, I wanted to try. Pours a nice cloudy, straw-white color with a thin head. Aroma is delicate and spicy with hints of banana and clove. Taste is nice and tart with the base flavors giving way to a citrusy mouthfeel with clove and spice. Pretty well balanced for a white beer. I'd definitely say it's one of the best examples of this style that I have had. Love the bottle shape too."
"A beer that is distinctively different and epitomizes its style in textbook fashion."
"Do I find Hoegaarden objectionable? No. Would I buy it again? No. I paid $7.49 and I'd much rather spend that much on a 4-pack of Duvel or a couple bombers of Ommegang."
"D: Overall a good beer that stays true to the style. Worth a try."
"Poured a tall, creamy, bright-white head that never seemed to fade. After a few sips of the hazy hay colored beer there were rings of lace around the glass. Bits of candied oranges, flowers and coriander in the aroma. The light flavor os wheat is accented by bits of citrus. Fine carbonation and crisp clean flavors make for a refreshing beer. It may be an overly commercialized brand, but the beer is a solid representation of the style."
"Drinkability: Drink with ease. Very refreshing with good, but not overpowering flavour, making you want to drink more."
"This is a really refreshing beer, and it goes down in a way somewhat similar to lemon squash and certain scrumpy ciders. The acetic bite is far more noticeable than any alcohol taste. It is an interesting beer, and I will continue to try it on occassion, despite the relatively high price."
"This beer is limp and watery. Though some wheat and citrus tones come through, it comes across as a non-syrupy citrus soda drink. Chalky finish and weak mouthfeel. I guess it used to be better."
"***Edited 9/14/07*** Still had one of these in my fridge and was nearly contemplating tossing it, but decided to give it another try. I was pleasantly surprised to find it wasn't as bad as I remembered. Still has an overall ""sourness"" to it that would really not make me desire having more than one, but its crispness *was* refreshing. Smell is still its best quality, imo. Enjoy.***"
"I thoroughly enjoyed the bottle and would definately drink it again. As it came in a 750ml bottle then this was a good amount, one was enough on a weeknight. Highly recommended."
"Poured a 12 ounce bottle into a glass mug. A nice, opaque, golden body with a small white head. No real retention worth noting, but it slowed to a nice lacing. The smell with sweet and fruitty. The taste was more of the same. Very smooth with banana esters very present in the taste and aftertaste. The mouthfeel was decent at best; a little on the thin side. Overall, a nice, smooth, refreshing beer. The fact that it is easy going makes it a very drinkable beer."
"It pours into a Hoegaarden glass with a cloudy lemony color, with a fluffy white head on top. It has the aroma of citrus and a sweet malt. It tastes just like it looks, a bit sweet with fruity notes and refreshing. I heard that this should go down in three sips, with I can understand why. A good summery beer."
"This is a very drinkable white....and getting to be very available on tap here in the NE."
"D - Very Drinkable, Especially in the summer."
"Thick, foamy head on a soft pour. Pale, cloudy, straw-colored with fairly vigorous signs of carbonation. Smell is mildly sweet with corriander and a mild citrus note. Taste is spicy and citrus. Typical of style, but somewhat muted. Mouthfeel is crisp and biting due to the high carbonation. Good body and refreshing. Very drinkable, but there are other beers that better exemplify this style. Still, very enjoyable. I would definitely buy this again."
"D - Incredibly drinkable. Not strong, or complex, but very good and very refreshing."
"Not a huge Wheat fan, but this one was a very easy drinking, somewhat (but not overly) sweet ale. Hazy orange (inviting) color with a white head that went away quickly, but hung on to the glass till the last drop. sweet fruity aroma, as well as the taste. I could drink this one all summer long as long as it is a nice hot day."
"Light overall flavor, good for summertime thirst-quenching. Not my favorite Witbier."
"Had this one a couple of times on-tap lately; seems to be the good beer that sneaks in the crappy beer joints. The look is excellent; nice straw-yellow color, opaque and hazy, with a nice two-finger white head on top. Nose is fairly mild, mostly citrus, but not a lot there. Taste is better, this one kind of sets the standard for the style, in my mind. Coriander, yeast, and citrus floats around all over the place. A little hops in the back, but mostly a wheat-beer-like taste. Feel is a little thin, although that does seem to be kind of standard for the style. A solid beer, definitely one I could make sessionable. If you haven't had this one yet, check it out."
"Overall, this is an excellent Belgian white; one of the classics. It's quite nice on a warm or hot day, very refreshing and tasty. The last half I enjoyed with a small quarter slice of orange, as is traditional in Belgium."
"Very nice."
"heard lots of good things about this beer, of course like alot of the beers i hear about i have to go over to missouri to get. Regardless has a nice color to it, with some cloudiness, smells like spicy hops with citrus notes. tastes great, more citrus flavor is evident as is more spicy hops, refreshing tasty beer, wish i could get it more often."
"really great example of a great style. looks great in the glass. big pillowy head, tons of bubbles. kind of a cloudy straw in color. the nose is really subtle, a little too subtle maybe for me. picking up some citrus notes. the taste is nice, delicate, not over powering. subtle clove and spice notes. maybe a little too laid back but extremely drinkable. not sure if it's my favorite in the style but definitly one of the more drinkable ones."
"M&D: creamy-textured on the palate, also slightly tangy due to the wheatiness and yeasts. But this really is not my favourite style, as the flavour tends to disintegrate after several sips as well as after warming up... Not a bad beer though, don't get me wrong~~"
"had this at a now-defunct french bistro and thankfully out of the two (TWO!) taps this was one of the beers available. served in a hoegaarden glass (kinda small glass), this was pale yellow and so cloudy it seemed whitish to me. big snow white head. bouqet was subtle but i detected clove or coriander, white bread/biscuits, and even bubblegum. yeasty aromas. taste is of lightly sweet malt balanced by a creamy carbonation and almost indiscernable floral hop background. somehow manages to finish clean. light bodied and creamy. i had a few of these no problem."
"Overall, this is a staple in my line of beers. I have gone back many times since my first and love this brew. A must try, hell try it twice in one of thier giant bucket sized glasses."
"12oz brown bottle with no freshness date. Poured 2/3 into a pint glass, swirled the bottle and poured the remaining 1/3 in - as the bottle instructs. Pours a cloudy pale yellow with a frothy 2 finger head, decent longevity and very nice lace. Smells as a Witbier should - lots of citrus/lemon with a slight peppery aroma mixed with a tad of banana and some yeast aromas. Upon tasting it is light in flavor although all of the correct flavors are present with a nice and lite sourness. This beer is lite and refreshing - very refreshing. Perhaps a bit lite in the flavor stregth but a very nice summer beer indeed."
"Drinkabilty is good though it might be a tad sweet. Not a bad option. I ended up having two before switching to Duvel and Chimay."
"Easy enough to drink, but not very flavorful."
"One of the more reviewed beers on BA, and rightfully deserved of its placement and grade. This is one that I will definatley look for in the future."
"D- This could be very refreshing on a hot summer day, which it is by no means here in Michigan right now. I'll have to give this another shot when its above freezing outside."
"Slammin' some ho's. Ahh, that never gets old! Interesting beer, it pours white with a good amount of head as the bottle tells you to pour 2/3rd's, swirl, and then pour the rest. Theres a lil' bit of something floating around in here...yeast? The smell is quite pleasant, like a mellow version of Franziskaner I'd say. The taste is like the forementioned, and I could pound these all night if it was going to be one of ""those nights"" because its just a great beer to session with. Not very filling, light, and has the hefe feel to it, which I love btw. The mouthfeel is light, but hey, its a light beer! For drinkability, again, one of the beers that could probably never offend me. Good job. This is what a light beer should be! A bit pricey though..."
"This beer has taken me off guard and I am very pleased with my purchase. The taste is natural and mild when compared to a Blue Moon and I would recommend this over a Blue Moon any time."
"The mouthfeel is light with brisk carbonation. This is a classic style example-- and a good beer."
"Overall this was a fine example of the style and I think I will be drinking much more of this beer during the summer months."
"Particular to having this on draft: I think it loses some of its characteristic flavors when served from a keg, this has a tendency to strip bottle conditioned wheat beers of taste as it is essentially decanting the yeast sediment without allowing it to really get at the beer. I think of Hoegaarden, other wit/wheat beers as being ""filtered"" when on tap."
"of those spices. It's simple, yet appetising and refreshing."
"One of the more accessible craft beers in America these days and it's pretty good given that fact. When just enjoying a couple of beers though I would prefer something a little bit more foody and full flavored."
"Drinkability - Light non-offensive and easy to drink."
"D: This beer is very drinkable, smooth flavor, creamy texture, and below 5% a good witbier, worth trying if you are interested in the style."
"curing common beer disease"
"had this on-tap at the local Earl's..big assed 24oz pint glass..beer was quite cold which may have affected any head retention. Faint aroma, but did detect some floralness. Taste was quite nice, muted fruit(peach/pear) and a hint of citrus. Smooth and slightly chewy mouthfeel. Would be a nice summer beer on Earl's patio."
"D: This is a very refreshing beer and very easy to drink. It has a very pleasant and unique taste. This is my first witbier but based on this beer it is a style that I'd like to explore further."
"Drinkability was very good."
"Overall, this beer was nice and refreshing and highly drinkable."
"Poured from a bottle, it's a pale, cloudy straw yellow with a big fluffy white head. The nose is a bit spicy and floral with a touch of citrus. On the palate, it's just as spicy as you'd expect from the aroma mixed with sweet wheat flavor and again, a bit of citrus behind the coriander with a very slight hop flavor on the finish. The mouthfeel is actually somewhat thin, which is uncharacteristic of how filling it is. Altogether, it's a drinkable brew, though spiciness is what I look for in my whiskies rather than my beers, but it is oddly filling, not unlike a good stout."
"D: A very nice beer, one that i could drink on a regular basis. This will find its way back into my fridge."
"Very good, moderately sessionable beer."
"Hoegaarden simply is what it is: a architype for the witbier style. Its not designed to wow the taste buds, but the flavors are far from offensive. Enough tartness to keep the beer from being bland and given the right conditions, the beer can be quite refreshing. This is one beer I prefer on the colder side of the spectrum as I feel it makes it a bit more tight and impactfull."
"This is a nice summer drink, I do enjoy wit beers and this is a good one , but I find the Allagash, and Hitachino white more flavorful. However they are more expensive."
"This is a very drinkable beer. It's light and goes down easy."
"Entering this from notes... Drank a large bottle of this by myself in England. Pours a hazy straw color, small white head. Decent retention. Smells of sharp bread and yeast, some wheat, citrus like oranges. Tastes much of the same. Fine example of a Witbier or White Ale - very spicy and yeasty. Medium mouthfeel, very easily drinkable beer."
"drinkability - Nice summer beer, you have to try this if you never tried a Witbier style beer. One of the top Witbier beers."
"Great mouthfeel. Medium carbonation makes this one very easy to quaff. The low alcohol percentage doesn't hurt either. Great session beer. This beer is an absolute staple. Not my favorite Witte, but damned good and easy to find."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not very filling at all, nice representation of style, I was at the restaurant for only about an hour and put away 3 pints. The only thing that would keep me from sticking with this beer for an evening would be that I might drink it too quickly."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with a fizzy head that fades down considerably. Not too much going on in the nose, some spicy citrus notes and some mild floral hops, it's pleasant though. Smooth taste of citrus, clove, spice, and rounded out with a slightly bready hop bite. Overall very drinkable and light, perfect for summer. Can be served with an orange or lemon to intensify the citrus elements."
"Adding a slice of lemon to the glass only enhances the flavor, IMO."
"I poured this beer into a pint glass. It has a great light orange/yellow color, but with minimal head. It smells like your typical unfiltered wheat beer, tasty! The taste is excellent, although I am a bit biased because I really enjoy this style. I served it with a slice of lemon, orange is a bit too sweet for me. It has a plain mouthfeel, but it is smooth and delectable. I highly recommend to fans of this style."
"Michael"
"As the name suggests, is bears a distinct wheat smell and taste. It tastes sharp with hints of citrus. Slightly over-carbonated for my liking, its very smooth and quite tasty. I could happily drink this all night, esspecially considering its now very reasonable price here in Australia."
"Great cloudy golden pour- good yeasty aromas with tangy citrus bite. Wheaty on the tongue- light airy head gives flavors a way to come through. Belgian yeast strains are GOD, and this is a great mild intro to the style. Extremely drinkable, and the aggressive carbonation makes this brew very refreshing and flavorful."
"Drinkability: Very smooth and tasty, I could drink many at a time."
"I can knock back more of these than I'd like to admit, and while it's not my FAVORITE all time wit, Hoegaarden Original White Ale is a definite contender in the wide world of witbier."
"Eric"
"The pour is a cloudy Pale yellow with a creamy white head that leaves a lot of lace. The aroma is peppery coupled with the sweet notes of orange and lemon zest. Quite nice actually. Flavors start out sweet with noticeable wheat flavors (of course). There is a presence of coriander that is interested and might catch you a little off guard with the first few sips. The finish is a bit flat and watery in my opinion. Mouthfeel is lightly chewy. Drinkability is average, better if your a devote follower of the white ales. Overall, I must say that is brew did not impress me with the first glass. It might have been the present mood affecting my objectivity. However, by the end of the session, I did find it and enjoyable brew. Best to buy and try for yourself."
"A 33cl bottle with a best by 4/2/08 date. It was a cloudy yellow with a small head. Aroma was citrus, as well as a grassy smell. I couldn't really appreciate the citrus when tasting it, mostly some spiciness. I thought this was a little too bland, even for a wit. Could be a decent thirst quencher."
"I think a part of me expected a better beer and a part of me wanted to hate this beer and a part of me got the exact beer I was expecting. I am happy this beer is good. It is the best affordable Wit available in Omaha. It kills ZÔN, Sunshine Wheat, and Blue Moon but Blanche de Chambly and St. Bernardus Wit are much better (but pricier). Im please it is available in Omaha. I found it to be a drinkable and likeable Wit; worth a try."
"Goes down easy with enough flavor to want more although I was thinking more in terms of food pairings than multiple glasses."
"*On tap in Europe*"
"D - Very high. Delicious. Refreshing. Quite nice."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. Refreshing. Even light beer drinkers would enjoy this one, but this has a lot more character."
"Pours a light pale orange, not watery but white, thus the style of the ale. Nice white head, not much lacing if any. Lemony orange smell, coriander. Taste of lemon zest, a bit of orange, banana, coriander. Moderately carbonated, a bit creamy, finishes quite dry. Not my favorite style, always thought it had some funk flavor, but not as bad as I thought in my earlier years. Good drinkability, a bit dry for my liking but that is ok since it is not bitter."
"Drinkability: An easy drinking classic."
"Drinkability: Very good year round. Refreshing in the summer and a daily sipper during the winter. Unfortunately my every day sippers come from kegs that I buy from local craft brewers. This is a great beer to have if you go out to a place that might not have the best beer selection."
"Slainte!"
"D - Very drinkable. Solid, easy to find Wit."
"Taste is very mild with suttle hints of bananna and wheat but very limited. Not a very tasteful beer and kind mild on the pallette. Still enjoyable once in a while, but not one of my favorite."
"The taste is almost like the smell, but seems more muted. Banana and spices, a bit of hops. It's not an overwhelming flavor, nor very interesting. Not offensive by any means. A fairly typical wit, certainly not bad, but nothing special either."
"This is my favorite kind of beer. Light and nice without being pointless. No unpleasant overtones of alcohol, not too fizzy. The yeasty taste really is this beer's forte."
"This beer is very drinkable it was so mild my wife even liked it. I was hoping for a little more kick in the taste buds."
"Overall a highly drinkable wit. Well worth the reputation."
"I've been wanting to try this because the only witbiers I've had are Blue Moon and Hitachino Nest. This one seems similar to a Blue Moon, only better. Nice color, very pale golden, good head. Tastes of banana, citrus, and pear. It seems near the end of the glass I noticed a more spicy flavor. Coriander was more prominent than other beers. Also, compared to Blue Moon, the mouthfeel seemed more full, more substance. Overall it was a nice, light, satisfying beer. If you like Blue Moon, definitely try this one out."
"The beer pours a cloudy sunshine yellow with a thin, bright white head. The aroma is all citrus. The flavor is citrusy, but not overwhelming orange like Blue Moon. I can taste the corriandor, knowing that it's there. It's very subtle. The mouthfeel is good, medium-light without seeming to watery. An overall good beer that is almost always in my fridge"
"pours cloudy straw yellow with a three finger white head which fades fairly quickly. you can definitely smell the coriander and orange peel or grapefruit would fit. tastes same. mouthfeel light just right carbonation a little bitter citrus at the end. drank five of these for the review and really enjoyed it."
"The appearance is a hazy, pale yellow with perhaps a one finger creamy head. Nice lacing on the glass. The smell is sweet and citrusy. This is a very tasty beer. Spice and lemon are most evident. Minimal hop bitterness. It is both sweet and sour like lemonade. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with mild carbonation. Very drinkable and refreshing. I tried this in November but I bet it goes down even easier in the summer. Overall, a very enjoyable beer that can be a nice change of pace. Not an everyday beer for me but one that I'll have again."
"I highly recommend this beer, it is one of my favorites."
"Hazy blonde. Head is much bigger, creamy, with good retention, and lacing which lines the glass. Highly aromatic (as in the bottle) with citrus, coriander and clove. On palate sweet and sour, with clove and banana on finish: perhaps more intensity of flavour than in the bottle. The lovely sweet-sour finish is lasting. Carbonation is more balanced on tap, creating a pleasant mouthfeel. Few beers could be called more refreshing. Superbly drinkable (particularly now that the weather is getting warmer in Australia). In spite of a good selection of other beers where I was drinking, I couldn't resist sticking with this."
"Hoegaarden Original White Ale pours a cloudy yellow with a huge white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. It has a nice aroma, citrus and coriander are both noticeable. Lemon and orange are most noticeable in the flavor with coriander lurking in the background, there's some grain and wheat at the end. Very drinkable."
"A summers day drink, not for winter nights."
"This is a very tasty beer that I highly recommend. However, I won't be drinking a whole bunch of it in large quantities. It seems a bit heavier than other beers I've had."
"Hoegaarden (pronounced whogarden) is one of the worlds best examples of a Belgian wit, or white, style. It is a light, crisp beer containing barley and wheat, and spiced with coriander and curacao orange peel. It is produced by Brouwerij van Hoegaarden in Hoegaarden, Belgium, for InBev. The brewery includes oats in the beer, which along with secondary fermentation in the bottle, results in a thick, white creamy head. The yeast causes some slight cloudiness, but does not take away from the flavor. It is an excellent summer beer."
"On tap in .5 liter glass. Poured pretty clear for an unfiltered wheat beer with a solid head that stuck around till the last. Aroma of lemon and wheat and some aspects of cloves, but no banana flavor. Initial taste was lightly bitter with a light palate. Lacking in overall mouth feel due to too cold a pour."
" Drink- Easy to drink. One of the first beers that opened my eyes to the real world of beers. This was the one that started it for me."
"D - One of the smoothest beers I've had. This is at least my tenth bottle of Hoegaarden, but I never reviewed it until now. I highly recommend it to anyone, especially those who want a stepping stone from the macros to something better. One of my favourite brews, and I will definately drink it consistently for years to come."
"Honest to goodness one of my favorites. I just love this beer."
"Only the second witbier I've tried and I'm quite impressed. When poured from a bottle to a pint glass this beer has a nice yellowish cloudy color with a decent head that sticks around for a bit. It smells of citrus and spice. The taste is well balanced with the spice on the back not too overwhelming for the fruity front. In the mouth it has a light smooth quality. Overall an excellent beer."
"I really don't think I can give this beer justice with my words, but needless to say I hope to have it again very soon. (And since I don't think this is sold in too many places near me it has forced me to branch out and try as many wheat beers as possible)"
"Pours great with a thick, foamy head and a great cloudy appearance. I also find this beer highly drinkable, but I think it's a little lacking in complexity. It's a little too peppery for me as well. It's not bad for a session beer because it's light and drinkable, but not one of my favorites."
"Light yellow, slightly murky body with a nearly white head, about 4 fingers thick. Smells citrusy mostly with some spice. Very well-balanced and tasty. Sweet, citrusy with some spice, but no flavor overpowers. Virtually perfect. Extremely drinkable. I'm very impressed. The best witbier I've tried, and a new favorite!"
"D - The light feel paired with a creamy-fruity taste adds up to a very drinkable witbier. The ultimate hot-summers-day selection."
"Poured a hazy yellow with a nice frothy white head. The smell was fruity, banana and citrusy, albiet not overwhelmingly strong. The taste is enjoyable, consisting of some sweet malt, a citrusy hop flavour, and some wheaty sourness. There is also an overall spiceyness which complements the individual characteristics. Hoegaarden is exceptional in its mouthfeel as far as im concerned. This beer is crisp and highly refreshing and has a light/medium body. I also think drinkability is high, especially in hot weather. This was the first wit i ever had many years back, and even though i've had a few which surpass it, i'll always hold this as a benchmark for the style."
"Beautiful, cloudy, topaz-yellow color. Coriander and banana nose is nice but a bit weak. Mouthfeel is excellent. Citrus (and perhaps a bit of clove?) taste is refreshing, light and Easy-Glide-smooth, but, like an over-anxious adolescent, it finishes too quick. This is an excellent summer drink. In fact its very much like a summer fling; fresh, invigorating, effervescent, but ultimately not transcendent."
"D- You could drink this all night. So could I. So THIS is what Blue Moon was trying to copy..."
"Slightly fizzy feel on the way down. But I could drink these all day, though it's so mild that I might need to have something strong to mix it up. Also a very good ""initiation"" beer to those not so inclined toward malt and hops."
"This is a very different beer from the main stream beers you find in america. it is even markedly different from any macro i have tasted. It is white, slightly golden with descent head. It has a smokey taste to it, thats all i can describe it as. it is definetly different from any other beer i have tried,"
"This one is highly carbonated, thin in the mouth, and very thirst quenching. I would get a pint of this again...especially in the spring or summer."
"Had to pick up a case of this finding myself more of an afficianado of imports and less of a hard core IPA freak. Surely the one beer to have when you're having more than on. Giving this a late review as the case is almost gone, but after having heavier brews, drinkable as they were, there is no problem savoring a Hoegaarden as the night comes to a close."
"All in all,a very nice brew."
"Gives me a tart tingle in the lips & tongue. Good body, very refreshing and not bitter."
"Great Witbier. Pours a very cloudy dull straw color with a huge white head that shrinks down to a covering on the glass. Strong and pleasant wheat aroma. Taste is great - wheat and citrus (lemon). Very crisp, absolutely delicious. The taste is strong but the beer seems light and refreshing. Mouthfeel is rich. Very drinkable, an excellent Wit."
"It's drinkable, smooth and refreshing. This is one that I think is much better on tap than in the bottle."
"Pours a hazy, ultra pale yellow. Large frothy white head. Smell is of light fruit notes and coriander. Taste is light on the palate, with small fruit underlays, as well as semi-tart sourness. Not complex, but easy to drink, especially on a hot day. Mouthfeel is semi-creamy, and drinkability is good."
"Final Statement: This beer is refreshing if you want it to be. Perhaps not as enjoyable to the novice beer drinker, however I know quite a few people that instantly take a liking to it."
"Adam"
"This excellent witbier was purchased as a sixpack of those evil 30 cl bottles. BB 31/05/07. I used the special hexagonal Hoegaarden glass to really appreciate this brew. Directly from the fridge, after pouring there was almost no head. What little _did_ form slowly disappeared. Pale misty yellow, some small bubbles rising. Very little smell, some sweets and err... banana. The taste was well balanced, fresh sourness combined with a light sweet yeasty flavor. A hint of bitterness, which lingered long after the other tastes had gone. This is a great beer to be had when thirsty, but _do_ try to sip it slowly so it can be fully enjoyed. BTW- ABV was 4.9 % according to the bottle."
"Maybe not the absolute best witbier out there, but certainly very good and easy to like."
"D- Very refreshing. Very easy to drink."
"There are some witbiers that are better, but not many"
"D- I could personally put away one of those 5 liter party kegs (Fassdosen, Partydosen) if I knew where to find one. That might unfortunatley only be a german/dutch phenom. Easy enough to say, the drinkabilty is very high on this beer."
"Very pricey beer but well worth it, one of the best Belgian Beers I've had, possible the entire Lower Counties. A great introduction to the White Beer style."
"D: Very. I love this beer, InBev or no InBev. It's crisp, it's flavorful, it's balanced, and it's really tasty. This will always be a quintessential summer refresher for me. Drinking one during the winter just isn't the same. I just poured my last bottle for the summer, I think, and I'll admit to being a little saddened by that. But there are pumkin ales and Oktoberfests in stores soon (or now), so that may not last long..."
"Color of gold white head- nose of bananas, yeast, cobwebs, and ???taste of yeast, citrus and hints of clove  light body  sweet yeast aftertaste Color of gold white head- nose of bananas, yeast, cobwebs, and ???taste of yeast, citrus and hints of clove  light body  sweet yeast aftertaste"
"Poured to a hazy golden color, with snow-white head, that lingered awhile, then dissipated to a thin white lace Aroma was spicy hops, with a hint of fruit. Flavor was very strongly spiced, mostly clove, and the finish was most refreshing. A very good beer for a hot summer night."
"Tastes of sour wheat malt, some underpinning of orange rind. Lots of coriander. Mouth is crisp and light. Very tasty, very drinkable. One of my old standbys for summer. A classic example of the style."
"Had this beer on tap before a late lunch. I love that you can't see through it in the glass! A muted yellowish color with a small white head that unfortunately was garnished with an orange. The smell was floral and grassy. The taste was well-balanced, just slightly sweet and so very smooth! This beer tastes good from the tip of your tongue to the back as the flavor changes slightly from front to back. Very easy to drink, another refreshing summer brew!"
"This beer is a great thing to experience. Great for a hot day, or when you just want to relax. I am very impressed."
"An excellent beer. I think that I like the Blanche de Chambly just a little more, but this was a worth opponent and I would certainly dirnk more of these. Extremely drinkable brew and hightly recommended."
"This is a very drinkable and refreshing brew. Perfect for a hot summer's evening when wants to quench their thirst, cool down, and have an interesting brew. Ill drink it again sometime for sure."
"Definitely a nicer beer. Goes down smooth, finishes clean. You can line these up one after another."
"Overall a delicious brew. In general, I prefer Belgian wits to German Hefes."
" Cliche though it may be, crisp and refreshing. This is surely one of the finest examples of the style out there. You have to try this one."
"I'm very new at this but I feel that I am finally developing my taste and this site is a great help. I tried this beer at the Winking Lizard in Canton, Ohio because it was the beer of the month and you get to keep the huge glass (can always use more glassware). The beer came with a really nice white frothy head and the liquid was a nice cloudy yellowish gold. The head stuck around for quite a while and the lacing really sticks to the sides of the glass. The first mouthfull is really interesting, it hits you with a fresh zesty, citrus hit and goes down really smooth. I hope I am describing this right but my friend and I both thought that the after-taste was very much like clove. I really enjoyed this beer and it went well with the popcorn and loaded nachos ( I know, not the most sophisticated accompaniment), and it really hit the spot on a hot humid day. I would definately order this again."
"This is rapidly becoming my favorite Belgian Witbier. Aroma is really great. Lots of citrus, lemon, pepper, and banana, and orange. Cloudy golden apearance with a thin head. Taste is light, dry, crisp, and thirst quenching and with not as much malt or breadeness. This is exactly what I like about Witbiers vs hefeweizens."
"Ultimately, though, what can you really say about Hoegaarden? Downhill or not, it's still the original, and it's still a very tasty, very delicious brew, and an excellent accessible introduction into a world of beer that most haven't evne begun to explore."
"An all round good beer."
"i liked it, but not as much as a few of my friends did. Nice cloudy pour head builds and reduces ather quickly, good carbonation. Tasted a little citric, This was my first witbier, im supprised by the big difference from hefes. Still the simalities outweighed the diiferences. A nice refreshing lighter beer with a crisp and fruity/spicey taste was what i was expecting. looking forward to trying it on tap"
"Got this beer on tap at the Bier Markt in Cleveland. Nice cloudy appearance, with OK head and lacing, good appearance for a wheat. Very nice lemon scent to the beer, with and excellent citrus and wheat taste. Beer went down crisp and smooth, excellent summer drink."
"D: The original! what can you say. A good one if you're at a bar and are looking for a Wit."
"By the way, this goes great with spicey food."
"This beer is light on the palate and is very refreshing. The carbonation does not get in the way of the complex flavor of this beer. It finishes dry and in my opinion there isn't anything that can beat Hoegaarden or any other wheat beer on a hot day. This is a beer that I will definitely be coming back to. It is definitely worth a try. It goes down easy and is very refreshing."
"Quite light and refreshing, especially today because it was hot as hell. When you're looking for something to cool off with, Hoegaarden is hard to turn down."
"This is one of those beers that make you feel good because it takes some of the heat off of you. A perfect choice for Summer. Extremely refreshing."
"Drinkability: This is a very smooth drinker. Tastes great start to finish."
"Quite refreshing and easy drinking."
"Enjoy!"
"This beer is very tasty and highly sessionable; it's a great light-tasting beer. Excellent choice for the hot summer months."
"great summer beer, goes down easy and is not a heavy beer so it is very refreshing."
"Drinkability: This is one smooth brew. Very tasty and easy to drink. It doesn't take long to finish off a sixer."
"Hazy light wheaty yellow color. Nice white fluffy head. Hints of lemon and wheat in the scent. Taste great, light wheat and lemon hints. Pretty good mouthfeel. Very drinkable. A good beer to drink in the summer. Fairly priced. Overall a very good beer."
"Good n' refreshing on hot days!"
"Recommended!"
"They keep trying to replicate this fine brew and they cannot. Very fruity esthers, some lemon, corriander going on. Nice light to medium body...extremely cloudy and wheaty. Great summer quaff! Pours a decent pillowy head. Very light, smooth and refreshing. Reasonably priced in Ohio. Great summer ale!"
"Drinking Hoegaarden at a sidewalk cafe in Europe is just about a requisite life experience. Ahhhh, takes me back..."
"I've never had a white ale before, so this was something new. I was quite impressed. I like the look and the flavor, but I'm not sure how likely it would be for me to get this again. Something about it's look/feel/taste make it seem a bit like a novelty. Would have this again with friends who like to try new and unique beers for sure, but on my own I think I'd get a hefeweizen instead. But definitely something to be checked out!"
"Overall: I assume that Hoegaarden represents one of the better witbiers out there. As such, I must admit that I am not a fan of the style. Cloudy beer beneath an anemic head with weak, spicy taste and a watery feel just dont float my boat. If anyone is aware of a truly great witbier I should try, please let me know."
"zingy with with light body and balanced taste - could have a few, especially in the heat of the d.c. summer."
"this brew reminds me a bit of Berliner Weisse (something I can hardly drink in a pure state) with a dominant citric acidity and sourness, however it has some additional spices (coriander) and peppery taste ... no doubt a great thirst quencher, but if the choice was mine, I'd go for an IPA ...."
"One of the best witbiers around!"
"Hazy washed-out gold with a pristine, thin white head. White pepper scent laces malty-sour wheat and coriander mash. A bit clovey, too. Chewy sprouted wheat with pepper and cilantro leaves combine with a mellow white grape and light dried banana sour-sweetness. Weighty on the palate, but light in body. Lightly expansive, almost creamy mouthfeel, but retains a citric juiciness that is eminently refreshing. In humidity like this, after barbecueing some salmon filets, this is without a doubt highly drinkable. Nice wit."
"DI like it. A good summertime selection and a good session beer for by the pool or at the beach."
"Highly recommend this beer - it's a good one for new beer drinkers or the hop-averse; my wife loves this one!"
"Drinkability: I'd drink this if I was offered it anyday, but that's not saying much. It's very refreshing and adventurous for the taste buds. Easy to drink and enjoy, nice looking."
"Pours a cloudy light golden/yellow color with a thick head of large white bubbles. Frothy. Aroma is spice. Coriander comes out with a bit of orange citrus. Taste follows suit. Not too overdone. Very well balanced flavors. Light bitterness and dry aftertaste. Great easy drinking brew. A staple of the summer months."
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow. Huge fluffy head, good retention,moderate lacing. Aroma did not jump out and grab me. Light citrus and spice, but not very strong. Body is light with a bit of a fizz. Taste is of citrus and spice,with a nice finish. This is a good beer, just very light."
"Pours a very pale yellow with a nice fluffy two finger head. Smell is yeast, lemon zest and spicy. Taste consists of corriander wheat and citrus with a nice clean finish. This beer is extremely refreshing. I can not think of many better things to drink on a nice hot summer day. Definately one of the best wit biers out there."
"The appearance is cloudy with a good amount of gold. Smell is coriander and dried orange peel as you would expect. The taste is very refreshing. I appreciate this White Ale more than other examples because I feel the spices are well balanced. In more extreme examples they lose what makes them charming as the flavors you appreciate in a more restrained version, such as Hoegaarden, try to bludgeon you to death about the head. Mouthfeel is of medium density and drinkability is high, especially when the temperatures are likewise. On a closing note, I don't care what abuse I take, sometimes I enjoy it with a nice slice of orange."
"Overall, this is a very good beer, perfect for the hot humid days of summer (like today). Yeah, it's not cheap, but it's worth it."
"This is a nice light delicious beer that packs a subtle punch. The head is stiff and frothy white with an nice even hue of whiteish gold. The smell is rich of lemon spice and wheaty citrus. The taste matches your nose and has an aggressive kick of honey as it flows down. It has a nice consistent flavor that is sure to satisfy."
"Given the presentation the taste is a bit disappointing, however it is good. Nice spice with lots of undertones that come out in the after taste. It goes down nice with just the right mount of fizz. My biggest complaint is that it needs a bolder emphasis on the flavour."
"D: A well balanced beer, as always"
"Drinkability: This is one of the best Witbiers you can buy for the price and availability in my opinion. And after all, it's summer. For around $10 for a 6-pack and for how much food you can enjoy with this, not to mention the ABV being fairly low, I'll be drinking Hoegaarden again."
"D - definitely a beer you could put back many of in an evening and not be too worried about the effects. A perfectly balanced beer, light and refreshing."
"Easy to drink, yet not challenging enough to want more that one."
"This is possibly the quintessential lawnmower/thirst quencher, and a personal favorite. Yum."
"This is an excellent hot-weather drink and fairly easy to find. I almost always keep at least a couple in my fridge. The only downside is that at around $8 for a 6-pack, it gets kind of pricey as an every day drink."
"I wasnt overly impressed here, but not disappointed either. Its an average beer that would work for a sunny day."
"Beer appeared as a pale yellow and was served with a very good head. Nose was of spices and maybe a hint of banana. Taste was wheaty, spicy up front. Hops were definitely not prominently there. Mouthfeel was lively with a light body. Drinkability was very good. This is a nice wheat beer and a good representation of the style."
"Drinkability: Refreshing and enjoyable, even if this is not my favorite style"
"Plus, that Hoegaarden glass is just magnificent!"
"Pours out a cloudy lemonade with a fluffy white head. Smells phenolic with the wheat snap. Hardly, if any, spicing. There are the yeasty and wheaty characteristics in the flavor, but it seems muted. Kind of like club soda in the finish. Mouthfeel is pleasantly carbonated and lively, but is too watery. All in all, it's rather refreshing and drinkable. A light wit with little to no spicing."
"Highly recommended."
"This is a very drinkable beer. It is very refreshing and not to much for the pallate to handle. I will definately revisit this beer."
"Cloudy light blonde in color. Moderately aromatic, full of fruit and spice, giving a scent of curacao and coriander, along with a light hint of hay. Flavor is light and airy, coating with a butter toffee blanket and loaded with light spice; coriander and curacao. A pleasant, yet unexciting witbier. Boy I wish I could have tried this 20 years ago."
"drinkability: Easy to drink on a hot day"
"Overall, a very nice introduction to wheat beers (and beer reviews). Looking forward to pairing this one with a nice slab of grilled salmon over the summer."
"a bottle from a sixer bought by dispholius. big white head on a clear and cider colored beer. apple/pear odor, not much else going on. very weak taste with some light spicy and sour notes. really just like a good belgian that's been watered down considerably. thin mouthfeel. not a pleasure to drink."
"Wonderful patio beverage, smooth and slightly sweet."
"overall, nothing to go crazy over but a solid summer beer. i like Great Lakes Holy Moses better in this style but this is neither as good or as bad as many people say it is."
"Drinkability - this goes down easy, and I could drink several in any one sitting."
"I prefer to have with lemon... tried one with an orange and found that it was not as good."
"Drinkability: I could easily drink this ale all summer long, although I'd like to see a bit more wheat."
"Overall it's not too bad of a brew. Unfortunately, it seems short on the good malt flavors and creaminess, which would definitely bump it a bit in the taste/mouthfeel."
"D - A nice light offering, especially on a warm day. Can sit back and have a few."
"This pours a light yellow with a decent sized white foamy head. The color is lighter than just about any beer I've seen. The smell is very strong and aromatic. The scents of pepper,lemon and coriander are the most pronounced smells. The taste has a creamy lemon,pepper,and wheat flavor that is very good and refreshing. The m/f is light and the flavors are all well balanced. This is a great summer beer,one that I will pick up as the temperature goes up."
"Overall: Really enjoy this beer and the fact that it's supremely drinkable enhances its appeal. Everything I'd expect from the style and comes close in my mind to being a ""wow"" example. When I think of witbier this particular one comes to mind instantly. I can only imagine what it must be like to get locally in Belgium."
"I am a sucker for Wits, especially on warm days (it hit 90*F here for the first time this year here), where I find them refreshing and invigorating. I have not had this in a long time, but I am quite happy to drink this beer, it is certainly much better than quite a few American interpretations of this brew (of course a lot of the American interpretations are better than this), which is a pleasant experience from this once only example of the style."
"I have had Hoegaarden many times over the past few years but I thought of rating this after just having it the other night at a work party which amazed me since they usually only have Miller Lite, Amstel Light and normal beers for the masses. No that Hoegaarden is a rare beer but enjoyable. The beer poured a very hazy light straw color with a bit of a white head. The aroma is nice and citrusy and a bit of a wheat nose. The taste is very crisp, lemony with a nice wheat body. Overall this is a very easy beer to drink and enjoyable on a hot summer day."
"I find this beer very drinkable but given (to me) it's unusual flavor would not be top choice all the time, but a good spring/summer brew."
"This one is fairly drinkable, but I think after a couple I would be looking for a change of pace. Not bad, not great."
"Hoegaarden is an ultra-hazy straw color. Head is large and frothy. Aroma is spicy and yeasty. Clove with a bit of bubblegum are noted. Taste has a crisp wheat flavor with plenty of peppery spice and phenols. Overall there is plenty of flavor here with enough complexity to keep things interesting. This is an easy choice for a summer/spring beer."
"Came a hazy light honey color with a one finger white cap and lemon slice in a mug. Cap dissipated quickly (due to lemon?) Anway, smell was clean, grainy, yeast, and lots of citrus. Flavor was citrus and biscuit. The grains came out very nicely and had a mellow hop bitterness. Some spice was coming through but not too strong. Mouthfeel was light-medium with medium carbonation. Very refreshing and I enjoy tap much better than the bottle of this beer."
"taste - predominantly lemon. nice buttery moutfeel makes it nice and smooth. nice spiciness keeps things interesting. very light and refreshing, i'll buy this again sometime in the heat of summer."
"Drinkablity: Light yet flavorful; quite drinkable."
"The drinkability is a moot point."
"****edit*** oh how our beer taste bud grow over time this is a great beer and a solid wit that i could drink all night long. Always revisit beers after some time you may find your tastes have changed"
"When poured into a Pilsner glass, it was this nice yellowish/white color with a 2 finger head of white color foam. The head of foam receded very slowly leaving behind plenty of lace behind it. It had a light aroma of different citrus fruits, cloves, and some yeast in the background. The taste was very much like the smell, it had many different citrus fruits (mostly lemons), cloves, and this all ended with a taste of yeast. All I can I say about the mouthfeel is that is smooth, light, and crisp. This would make for a very refreshing beer on a hot summers day. Pretty much an average Belgain Wit Beer."
"D - Probably better as a summertime drink. Goes down quite easy."
"Refreshing and easy to drink... a clear first day of summer beer. Only wish the lemon aroma stuck around a little longer."
"Sessions very well due to the moderate 5% ABV."
"i always find hoegaarden, or wits in general, as a perfect summer drink. sometimes when i long for the warm weather i will get a six pack of this and sort of mentally imagine it being 90 degrees out while sipping on one of these."
"I think that this beer would be a decent session beer. It is mild enough to not get overbearing. Also, the alcohol content is low enough to allow you to enjoy a few. While not my favorite beer, this beer is good and worthy of buying an other bottle in the future."
"Always one of my favorites and mixes well too. For those who aren't too found of beer doing half this with half lemonade is fantastic, little trick I learned in Germany while drinking wheat beers a few years ago."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: drinkability suffered due to the strange taste, but it was refreshing as a drink so I think it is good over all."
"Very hazy and pale golden-yellow color with a small , creamy white head. Some nice lacing left on the glass. Spicy aromas , some zesty citrus/lemon. Taste is light and refreshing , spiced and tart lemony-citrus flavors , some coriander ,sweet orange, wheaty-dry twang to the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light with a dry finish. This Witbier is definatly quite drinkable: refreshing ,appetizing ,and thirst quenching."
"A really nice beer that I'll definitely have again."
"pours a thick, white two-finger head and a very cloudy light yellow color. looks interesting. citrus and clove smells jump out of the bottle even before pouring. tastes and mouthfeel both are a little thin. the nose is the srong point for this beer. a super thirst quencher however and thus a very rare (from me) 5 awarded for drinkability."
"M/D - Smooth with some viscosity, parching finish compromises drink ability, especially for a white beer."
"So supposedly this is the benchmark witbier... or, according to some, it used to be until it was bought by InBev. Pours a very hazy pale straw colored, tinged with green. Decent head, but the green tinge is a bit off-putting. The nose is centered around coriander, with a basis of citrus (lemon/orange, some kind of hybrid)... very warm smelling and appealing. The taste is dominated by carbonation up front, then the coriander and a late, lemony taste in the back of the throat, oddly enough. The taste structure and mouthfeel is very light -- like the wine spritzer of the beer world, but in a good way. This is one tasty, eminently quaffable beer, whose reputation is justifed IMO... although I'd love to taste the older version of this beer, if it's actually different like people say."
"An old standby for me. I always go to this beer when I can't make a decision on anything else. The taste is light and refreshing, and strangely -- white! Almost a cross between a lemonade and a cream soda. Lots of lemon and honey flavors, subtle amounts of carbonation. Good in any season."
"At a low ABV (as with most witbiers) this is an eminently drinkable, enjoyable, thankfully easy-to-find brew. It's always good, but the one hesitation I have with it is I've found it to be one of the more inconsistent beers. My previous experiences with it have varied widely from tap to bottle, and amongst all the bottles I've had (dozens) I've found it somewhat temperamental to all the usual beer variables (more so than most): heat, cold, sunlight, darkness, temperature served, glassware used, amount of sediment swirled into the glass, etc. It's never been bad, just often varying a few degrees one way or another. Not sure if it's me or the beer, I'm guessing the beer, but I thought I'd mention it."
"I'll probably be picking more of these up when the weather gets hot."
"Pours with a half-inch head with some retention. Color is an amazing off-white with massive cloudiness. Fine lacing. Smell is nice and strong with notes of lemon, orange, wheat, belgian yeast and perhaps a bit of clove spice. Taste is mild, citrusy and wheaty. Lightly sweet and sour both. Very refreshing. Mouthfeel is light, but it coats well and has solid carbonation. Drinkability is nice- not too strong, or too heavy, making it easy to have a few..."
"This isn't really a thinking man's brew, I wouldn't say, but for a hot summer's day, I think it's a great pick - think spiced fizzy lemonade. Yum."
"This brew was a pleasant surprise. It comes highly recommended from a trusted BA. I will be sure to revisit this one in the future, especially once it warms up outside."
"A high quality, consistent brew."
"Opinion: I am really enjoying this beer. It has a light but complex flavor profile that tells me that I can put these away all night. The wheat takes a bit of getting used to, but I like the fact that they aren't accompanied with a bunch of cloves and bananas like you get just across the border. I have had this beer on tap before, but that was before I was really working on my palate...I would like to drink this beer more."
"Nice light yellow color with white cloudiness to it and a fair white head. The smell and taste of this beer are quite similar, and pretty much the standard for the style. Lots of corriander, loads of yeast, and a bit of clean citrus. I got more citrus in the nose than on the tongue, and more yeast on the tongue than the nose. ""Standard"" is what keeps coming to mind with this one. A beer to judge all other white beers by."
"This is my first Witbier so I really didnt know too much what to expect. After the pour I quickly realized why it is called a Wit, i've never actually had a beer pour this light. Had to grab my quadmate and show him this interesting hue.Its creamy clear with a slight yellow tinge. The smell is pretty decent, coriander and citrus dominate, smell is on par with what I was expecting. Taste is pretty good, coriander really comes through strong with a crisp refreshing aftertaste. This is a fairly smooth brew, the flavors subside quickly in the aftertaste. As far as drinkability goes, I can see myself drinking a ton of this in the warmer months to come. This is one of those beerstyles similar to a biere de garde and a saison in where the taste doesnt initially wow me, but I find myself buying it on a weekly basis because I really do like it."
"I like the way this beer tastes, but I also find it to be very bland. At 5% abv I don't expect this beer to be a powerhouse of flavor, however judging this against the best witbiers that I've had leads me to the conclusion that this beer is just lacking in the flavor department. Hence I can only rate it as average for taste. I do like the way it looks though. This is the first time I've had a wit in a while, and I forgot just how pale these things are. Kind of cool that something so pale can taste good, can actually have some taste at all."
"Drinkability: I could drink several of these in a row and be happy. Very drinkable"
"this is definitely a beer that drinks smoothly and easily. A pleasant surprise and a beer I would gladly order again."
"nothing special in the mouthfeel, medium carbonation. but at 5% abv this is an easy 5 for drinkability."
"Now, once and for all, it's pronounced ""who-garden," not ""ho-garden."" I heard at least seven people mispronounce it and the bartender corrected my correct pronunciation with the mispronunciation. Ugh! [edit] I might be wrong on that one. I hear that Belgians don't even know how to pronounce it."
"This is good in every respect. Well built and balanced, not outstanding, but not at all disappointing. A great thirst quencher."
"I poured this beer from the bottle into a Hoegaarden glass. It pours a straw yellow opaque color with a 1 head that fades slowly. Nice lacing on this beer. The aroma is a yeasty bread aroma with a lemon twang to it. The mouthfeel is very light with zesty carbonation. This taste is light and refreshing with a heavy wheat flavor than ends with a slightly bitter citrus bite. The aftertaste has a slight medicine and hops flavor. This of course is the flagship witbiere. I like it but there are some serious contenders out there. Hoegaarden is better on tap in my opinion. In the bottle a slice of orange in the beer kills that aftertaste where a lemon overruns too much of the flavor."
"The flavor starts out with a crisp, slightly acidic lemon/hop bitterness (though not too bitter) which melds into a lightly sweet wheatyness in the finish. Nicely balanced. The hops are very faint. There is also a spicy black pepper element hidden with the citrus."
"D- this was my first wit beer and I enjoyed it very much. This beer makes me want to try other whites, and I will definatly drink more Hoegaarden."
"Poured this naturally cloudy beer into a 0.4 liter the color of a whiskey sour. Smell is clove-like with undertones of papaya, pineapple, honey and a hint of jasmine. Almost a piña colada without the crushed ice. Taste is very consistent and smooth throughout with an almost dry finish, crisp yet subtle. I really like this beer. I think its time to chill some more."
"This beer came a cloudy lemonade color with a slight hint of tan. The head consisted of little bits of foam floating around the top. Smelled of a sweet wonderful sugar/caramel/banana blend that was very well put together with an undertone of musky wheat. Tasted initially of a powerful banana with a slight cherry sweetness and a little bubble gum. Some fruit flavors then made themselves noticed with some coriander and dark sour cherries. There also was a sour citrus flavor that permeated all aspects of the beer. The mouth feel was light to medium bodied with a crisp tingly carbonation. This was very refreshing with a light flavor and a nice carbonation."
"This is the best whitbier I have had so far in my beer travels. Absolutely 100% drinkable. Wonderful."
"Overall: a very enjoyable wheat beer. Definitely worth trying at least once."
"All around, a very nice beer."
"Pours a very pale cloudy yellow with a pure white head that stays very well. Smells of citrus and spices, with a medicinal note and some yeastiness in the background. Tastes of wheat and lemon, with spices and a slight alcohol bite. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and quite nice, and the drinkability is very good. It goes down very smoothly. The classic witbier, even if it isn't the perfect one."
"Pours with two fingers of thick foam. The color is very pale yellow and the liquid is cloudy- unfiltered. In fact, it looks like lemonade. The smell is of yeast and some fruits and flowers. Ity has a characteristic yeast and sugar taste along with some breadyness and herbs. Some metal in there too. Not bad. In a comparative perspectiveI think it scores rather high in the wheat beer catogory."
" I enjoy the Allagash and Sam Adams White Ale's as well, and this to me is a bit more ""tried and true"" than they are. Anything that's been around for centuries has to be doing something right, and enjoying the gentle spices and solid maltiness of this has only gotten better for me over time!"
"What makes this beer fun is that almost no two sips were really the same. Unfortunately it also left the palate rather exhausted after one which is definately going to hurt drinkability. Normally I would suspect this beer was spoiled, but I've had it from the bottle a few times and its not that far off, just a bit old maybe, but I chalk it up to the great and mysterious difference between bottles and draft. Its definately unique and different."
"Pours a straw color, with lots of streaming carbonation and nearly opaque with cloudy yeast. A massive snow-white head over three fingers reduces to a tight, long-lasting cap of foam; but produces minimal lacing. Strong belgian phenolic smell; like crayons and cloves. Extra pale malt and wheat aromas in the background. The taste is sweet, lots of wheat and pale malt, with a powdery yeast character. A subtle clove and coriander spiciness provides a delicate balance without need for much hop influence; which are almost totally absent. The body is light but gets some definte texture from the high levels of wheat proteins and suspended yeast. Mild aftertaste of phenols carries into the finish, but only compliments overall mellow malt flavor. This stuff just slips down the throat."
"Wow, this is really interesting looking beer. Looks like lemonade almost. Pale cloudy yellow. It has a very active carbonation mixed with a bite and the funky taste of belgian yeast which I have long gotten accustomed too and now enjoy. I could only really drink two pints of this because of the sheer peculiarity of the flavors, that and it was $5.50 a pint. Lives up to its name as refreshing an is better than any lemonade I've ever had."
"Drinkability: Super high and easy to drink."
"Mouthfeel: Overly carbinated and too light bodied."
"Pours a very pale, lemonade-like, hazy yellow with a medium-sized, white, frothy, slowly diminishing head. Very good lacing. It has a mild fruity wheat aroma and mild typical wheat flavors. Banana, light clove, strawberry, lemon. The finish is short and weak. It has a light body, watery texture and low carbonation. Its refreshing but very one-dimensional and weak."
"yeast"" for me"
"The beer as its spills from the 12-ounce brown bottle a nebulous white with a presentable head that is semi-creamy in texture and a brilliant white in color as it fades away it leaves a velum like coating of lace upon the glass. Nose is spicy, hints of cloves and coriander, sweet malt and a slight citrus like tartness, start is lightly sweet with a mild grain presence and the top light in feel. Finish is purposeful in its acidity with the hops light and pleasant, the aftertaste lightly dry, and maybe not as great as the tap version, a real nice change of pace from my normal dark, strong, alcohol riddled brews I normally quaff."
"Pours a pale and very cloudy yellow color with no head at all. It looks very intriguing. The smell is yeasty and a little estery, like my own home-brewed ales. We're off to a good start. The taste is.. unusual, even for a witbier. I like the style, and I like this one, though I'm having trouble describing it. It just tastes like a nice yeasty ale. Mouthfeel is heavy, almost like drinking juice with a lot of carbonation. All in all, it's very drinkable, not really a session beer, but as a treat, it's a great beer."
"D - Refreshing. Decent drinkability.I have not drank this in years and for some reason I remember it being much more flavorful and overall more enjoyable."
"Poured into a goblet, very pale yellowish off-white unfiltered brew. Very lovely, nice carbonation, and great medium head that sticks around for a while, pretty lacing. I always liked the look of this beer, even when I knew nothing about beer and beer styles. Smell is of cloves, coriander, and lots of citrusy notes. Taste is a bit bready, with a refreshing lemony zestiness, very clean, but not too complex. Seems a bit weak in the mouthfeel, and I find it a little soft on the palate, but it sure slides down easily. This is a solid witbier, and still one of my perennial favorites."
"Drinkability: I can drink this all night quite happily. This is the standard by which I judge witbiers, and my fallback beer when I want something to quench my thirst."
"Mouth feel is light bodied and moderately carbonated."
"Almost universally regarded as the prime example of the style, and with good reason; its light, refreshing, and easygoing but it also features a spicy acidity that keeps it interesting. All in all, a very drinkable combination. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability is a downfall , I did drink about 4 of these in an hour and a half , but I wouldnt want to have more then 2 of these in a night if I did have a choice. So yes white cloud is a nice beer to check out and if you havint had it before , it will be a must have for you to taste test for yourself."
"Drinkability - Overall an easy drinking white ale. Great for a warm day, though it would do even better with some food to take the acidic edge out of it."
"couldnt believe i hadnt reviewed this one yet, but here it goes: Pours a extremely pale yellow (almost white) that is quite hazy, with a thick and frothy white head that retains well...paler than most other witbiers but nice. The aroma has big fruity notes: banana, orange and lemon rind, along with some spice (corriander and clove) and a wheaty twang. The flavor begins with some nice banana and citrus notes, then some light spice (corriander, clove, anise), some wheaty sourness, bread dough and some more fruity esters. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing with moderate high carbonation. Drinkability is excellent. I realize it's unfashionable on here to praise inbev brews, but as far as i can tell this beer tastes about the same, and its pretty tasty."
"I agree with another reviewer, though, that for Belgium...there are better beers."
"This was one of the first craft beers I ever tried, and I haven't had it since then. This is a reasonably decent beer, one that I'll have from time to time but can't call a personal favorite."
"Truly a unique beer worth trying!"
"Overall, a very drinkable beer. Nice and light for a warm summer day."
"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into pint glass. Gorgeous head with decent retention, cloudy, very light yellow with a gentle green glow. Smell is lemon, spice, and grass. Taste is slightly bitter, oranges, pepper...nice twangy slightly hoppy aftertaste. Really full and refreshing taste. Mouthfeel is a little light. Taste like a Duvel just a bit lighter bodied and without the alcohol warmth. Not bad at all, drinkability is good but maybe not great. Definitely something I'd look to purchase again in the future."
"This isn't something that I'd really want to drink alot of, but it is an interesting experience."
"Sweet taste, but with a hints of yeast. More bananas and a dry character rounds this one off. Not as complex or as bold as other ales of the style, like a Celis White and especially Allagash. Still, it's delicious and should be tried by all."
"A decent beer, with a nice drinkability, but I fully admit to liking several American versions of this belgian classic better."
"Overall this is an excellent Witbier that simply craves you have a 2nd straight after your first. Highly recommended."
"An herbal white belgian beer, i try this from carrefour, expensive for a mexican beers, in general is under the average, good for cheese, german cuisine, and chinese, serve in a goblet, smeel herbs and spice´s, taste lightly bitter, very soft; you can try with something of mexican gourmet food; 60% recommended."
"Very drinkable and refreshing."
"Notes: I think this would pair great with mild food. Anything with spice might be a challenge. Well crafted and worth at least sampling."
"Notes: good solid brew"
"Notes: Good go-to beer in the summertime."
"pours a very light and cloudy yellow typical of a witbier. above average head (2 fingers +) with average lacing. smells of bannanas and cloves with a hint of orange peels. tastes very good. very smooth with evident bannana, clove, and citrus, a small amount of wheat. this is a smooth medium body with a semi-bitter finish. very good as a summer brew, wouldn't recommend it for any winter months."
"Easy to drink, not enough bitter for me, the almost flat carb maybe the flatness of flavor, and the smooth finish gives this a session status."
"Here is an interesting tidbit of information: This review is based on a bottle I received as a gift from Israel. It probably goes down so nice there in all the heat. One final note is that I think the bottle design is very nice - logo protruding from the glass, recognizable label, unique bottle shape."
"Pours an effervescent pale pale yellow with a snow white head. Aroma is strong with cloves, spices, olives, and citusy, floral hops. Flavor follows suit, spicey clove and bitter citrus hops. Mouthfeel is crisp, and light-bodied. This is a tasty, refreshing wit, like it should be as the mother of the witbier style. A truly drinkable, sessionable, all-around solid brew here. Doesn't blow you away, but covers all its bases and covers them well."
"Ironically, despite my fondness for Hoegaareden, I mark it down slightly for drinkability simply because I enjoy it so much I consider it a special occassion beer. I rarely have more than one at a sitting and it seems to mix well with others, which can't be said of all beers. Regardless, this is a quality beer I've enjoyed all over the world."
"Pours a very cloudy pale yellow, so cloudy you can't see through it at all. A good amount of head which leaves a lace on the glass as you drink it. The smell is spicy and fruity, very appealing. Tastes is spicy and fruity, citrus, has a bite to it. The mouthfeel is great, it's not thin at all. This is a very, very drinkable beer. There is usually a six pack of this in my fridge and it is a beer I enjoy regularly. A great all around beer."
"This has to be one of the best tasting and easy drinking beers i've ever had. I've had it on tap and in the bottle, and both make for a wonderful drinking experience. A nice cloudy yellow pours to a quick settling head. The smell is sweet and aromatic, kinda citrusy, not skunky in the least. Unparalleled in taste and drinkability, mouthfeel is very delicate, like a mildly carbonated soda, not aggravating in the least. This beer definitely ranks as among my favorites, and definitely one that will be in my fridge at all time."
"Cheers"
"Pours a very pale almost pastel yellow with a huge rocky bright white head. Settles to a small cap that lasts the whole beer, leaving behind some decent lacing. Smell is a very nice clean wheat malt with strong pepper and spice notes and a delicate lemon peel twang underlying everything. Taste is light, malty, and refreshing with a spicy coriander finish and some fruity banana and orange notes. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, highly carbonated, and finishes dry. This is definitely one of the classics of the style, and is an absolutely fantastic summertime beer."
"Enjoy!"
"A bit dry, but it serves to bring me back in for another quaff. Very highly drinkable witbier."
"A nice, all around, easily drinkable whitbier. Nicely balanced, with no one part overwhelming the rest. Perhaps more a dinner beer than a session beer (tried it with some lemon pork chops, which went quite well), but enjoyable nonetheless."
"Definately, on the sweet side upon intake but thankfully that is squashed fairly quicky by some spicier yeasty flavor. plenty of carbonation here too, but not overdone. Good summertime beer."
"Highly carbonated and tangy. This is a very good one, Ill have to take over to the next family BBQ, I know it would be a hit!!"
"Twangy. Like a ginger beer, but better."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Pleasant in the mouth, enough activity to keep it interesting. Easy drinking for a summer session brew, when Belgium calls your name from across the ocean."
"I'm not really familiar with this type of beer. I had it next to a red ale and Hoegaarden really knocked my socks off - I went in totally uninitiated and I think the experience suffered a little. But I shall try it again, I think I will appreciate it later..."
"Final Thought: Belgium just keeps on rocking it in my beer journal, their ales kick ass and this beer kicks some ass too, what a beer!"
"Drikability is dangerously high. One could put down half a dozen of these without even noticing."
"Appearance is a lovely hazy gold with an ecru head of foam and not much lacing. My least favorite aroma is pepper (in a Zin or beer!) but here it is in my beer, with an unidentifyable odor plus some lemon peel. The initial taste has notes of corn sugar, thick, syrupy, nasty something or other, lemon pepper, and sour mash. Finish has a raw grain taste that leaves a bitter taste in ones mouth."
"Overall- a very good beer on a hot summer afternoon. Maybe a little too pricey though."
"Appearance: Pale light yellow in color and cloudy with plenty of little carbonation bubbles. Head was big and pillowy and settled down to a nice frothy cover which produced nice lacing. Smell: More like a Hefeweizen than many other witbiers that I have had. Yeast aromas, floral scents and a little bit of lemon is present. Taste: Much like the smell. Yeasty and bready with some lemon flavor. Simple and clean tasting. Mouthfeel: A little creamy at first, but goes down thin and smooth. Drinkability: A nice beer for a hot summer day by the pool."
"Hoegaarden is the opidome of refreshment with high character and quality. Where the flavor and aroma profiles carry enough complexity with effortless ease, the body might make too quick of a transition and surpasses refreshment into a slight empty or watering ending. Still, nearly an ideal session."
"It pours a really light cloudy yellow. It didin't look appetizing the first time i saw it but after you drink it you will appreciate it. The smell is very citrusy. The taste is nice, more citrus flavors, orange also. Also picking up some cinnamon maybe. refreshing. The mouthfeel is interesting due to the carbonation, sort of creamy, moderate though. Very drinkable."
"12 ounce bottle, best before 17/05/06 on back label."
"I have been drinking this beer fairly regularly over the years, it is a solid (lowish alc) offering that is consistent and is a refreshing summer cooler, or middle-of-the-day beer. Also I can buy it at several outlets (even the local supermarket)."
"This is my first Belgium brew ever. Nice intro. Bottle sez best by 5-10-05. The pour was a very white/yellow with a big head which disapated after awhile. Brew sit's cloudy with a slight rim/head. Never had a beer/ale with this kind of taste, but I like it. Taste is kind of mellow with no bitterness at all. I really like this brew and I will buy more if available, I do wish that the alcohol content was higher."
"personally I would not pay the $10 for 6 again but its still a nice beer."
"Incredibly unique pour. The middle was a hazy, see-thru yellow that faded out to a whitish color as it neared the glass. Very cool. There was a tiny head on it that was very white. The aroma consisted of mostly lemons and a little bit of pepper. The taste was even more lemony. It reminded me a lot of lemonade with a lot of carbonation. Very smooth, silky feel to it. This beer is one of a kind and a definite thirst quencher. Perfect for summer. I am not a fan of witbiers, but this is probably the best one I have tried to date."
"Hoegaarden ('The Original Belgian White Beer' according to the label) isn't the best of this style that I've ever tasted, but it's pretty good all the same. While it's a little too laid back for me, I did enjoy all twelve ounces."
"Hoegaarden pours a very light pale yellow/white color with a suddy froth white head. Carbonation is incredible to the eye, lacing will coat your glass. The aroma is that of lemon pepper and cloves, with hints of melon and morning dew aromas. The taste is light and fruity, hints of peach and melons arrive to meat the zip of spicy currant. The yeast is held back. A well rounded beer and one that will find itself in the fridge again."
"Pale and cloudy yellow in color, with a medium amount of carbonation. Amazing coriander and citrus aromas. MIld but perfectly balanced flavors of citrus, various spices (including coriander and black pepper), and something akin to Thrills gum. Clean finishing and very refreshing. I could drink this all day. Oddly enough, it works quite well with hot and spicy foods."
"Goes down very nice and refreshes the senses. With no off flavors and a light flavor, this brew is very drinkable and would be great on a hot summer day."
"I guess I should thank my Father for introducing me to this beer, he buys a few cases every summer, God bless him!"
"Pours an extremely pale lemonade color with some cloudiness. Bananas and yeast are up front along with some coriander and orange peel. Although the mouthfeel is very light, the taste is quite full. Malts are big and bready, serving up some banana sweetness. Hops are a little spicy, with bitter lemon and orange peel characteristics. Lower carbonation than expected allows the flavor to come forward that much more. Finishes slightly fruity with some cleansing citrous. Any easy drinking wit, not bad for a warm day."
"Overall = Pretty darn good wheat beer. Recommended for those that enjyo this style."
"Pours with a big, fluffy head reminiscent of frothy egg-whites and lacing is left done the sides of the glass as the foam settles. The color is very hazy yellow. The bready, yeast aroma accented with a bit of freshly cut grass. This beer has a very delicate mouthfeel and a light body. A wheaty, bready flavor dominates with a subtle, grassy, spiciness mixed with some notes of lemon. Hops are played way down and the finish is just shy of being too sweet and accented with coriander. This is a very easy drinking beer. The spiciness is less distinctive than I remember it being, but the last time I had this beer, I had it on tap -- perhaps the reason for the difference? The wheat flavor is huge in this beer. If you don't like wheat in your beer, your not going to like Hoegaarden."
"Hazy yellow color with cottony white head that left concentric rings of lacing on the oversized weizen glass. Aroma is of lemony citrus and wheat, cloves, pepper and other spices. Taste is excellent for a witbier, a good example of the style. Light orange and zesty lemon flavors blend well with the sweet maltiness of the wheat and the light nutty flavor of the yeast. Very fine carbonation makes for a creamy yet peppery mouthfeel - very nice. Extremely drinkable, an excellent, refreshing summer ale."
"Very cloudy yellowish color with a fluffy off-white head. Smells like pepper and lemons. Taste is well balanced with the pepper flavors neutralizing the sourness of the lemon flavors. Mouthfell is thick and chewy due to it being an unfiltered beer. This beer is very drinkable year round, but best in the summer."
"The perfect example of a Belgian White Ale, Hoegaarden is light and refreshing with a rich, creamy texture. I love the smell when you first pop the cap and I actually prefer to drink it straight from the bottle, although directions for proper pouring into a glass can be found on the label. Try it with a slice of lemon if you like, but I don't think it needs one. A slight tinge of bitterness can be found on the finish."
"Overall: Hoegaarden makes one helluva wit. This is one of my favorite warm weather beers."
"Nice cloudy yellow appearance, pretty boring head dissipates quickly. Smells citrusy, slightly yeasty. The taste was a little dissapointing, I was expecting more hoppiness, but still a pleasant citrusy slighly sour flavour. Nice full bubbly mouthfeel, very drinkable overall."
"It's light bodied, almost too light, and when it warms up a bit it quickly gets a bit too sudsy and sweet. But it's very refreshing and interesting when quite cold."
"i always enjoy the belgian beers, top notch on most occasions, rarely a disappointing experience. i have had hoegaarden before, and always felt it was a rather pedestrian belgian brew. on review i still find it slightly underwhelming. Beautiful witbier appearance cloudy, and inviting. The smells aare a bit lacking, very faint for me, a little too subtle maybe. Flavor comes up a bit short ,i like a little more up front in a beer like this, it seems a little watery, almost as if i was using a frosted glass to drink it . That being said it is a very drinkable beer, not unpleasent in the least, just not a singular experience like so many belgian nectars, i mean beers. This is a nice beer for enjoying ice ice cold in the sun, on the beach, soaking up some rays."
"One of my all time fav's: Pours a hazy light yellow color with a large head depending on how it is poured. The smell is a little sour with nothing really taking precedence over anything else, its all well balanced. Initial taste is like a crisp Pilsner again with no forward taste. When you begin to swallow is when the texture really comes out. The lemons are definitely at the forefront of the taste, with carbonation taking it all down. There is just a touch of wheat at the end, but for the most part it stays really sweet like candy."
"A truly wonderful beer. If anything, it seems to gain a little something in bottled form. Refreshing and beautiful, and the yardstick by which to judge other wits."
"Cloudy yellow with a large white head. Smells like lemon zest, orange peel, and wheat malts. Taste refreshing. Lemon peel, bready malts, and fruity hops dominiate the flavor. Light bodied with a little bit of carbonation. I love this beer. Expensive, but worth the money if you want a great witbeer."
"Pale yellow in color. Cloudy with a fluffy white head. Head dissipates slowly and leaves nice lacing. Smell is yeasty with fruit (maybe lemon) overtones. Taste is very mild and not overpowering. Slight bitter aftertaste. Not a bad beer for nice spring day."
"Drinkability: Ugh! I tried my hardest to finish it, and I did (Only because it was pretty expensive). This beer has nearly scared me away from wheat beer. Fortunately, there are milder types out there."
"One of my favorite session beers, I try to always keep a few bottles around in the fridge, in case someone comes by who claims he ""doesn't like beer"". A true classic, one I love introducing other people to."
"Had on tap at the South Side Saloon. Poured a wonderful unfiltered white. Everything else about this beer was that of a typical witbier. Nothing about it really stood out in my mind. The bartender gave me a drink of this mixed with Liefman's Frambroise... it was different that's for sure. Well this one's not bad, but not special."
"The term white beer on the package is what first caught my eye. After asking around about the beer I found there was a large amount of people that would pronounce it wrong. The pour was way cloudy and very unfiltered as expected. The taste was great for a wheat. It was very thick, like sucking a pice of bread through a straw. The after taste was heavy in fruit and i kept getting an odd almost bacon flavor.. odd. After reading the box, this beer is everything they claim it to be... good."
"Good stuff this, an excellent coolant on a warm sunny day. I've had it on draught and bottled in England and in Belgium... it always tastes better in Belgium for some reason. Perhaps the weather is just warmer there! Anyway, the appearance I've only given a 3 because it still doesn't look right to me even though I've been drinking it for years. Frankly it looks more like milk than beer should. But never mind that, it has an excellent fragrance (full of spices, mainly cinnamon I think) and you can drink it all day. Reccommended."
"good but I didn't want to have more than 2 bottles."
"D- This is a wonderful beer and very true to form maybe because this beer revived this style of beer not to long ago. This was near perfect but I would have liked to see just a bit more spiciness and a bit more tartness. And perhaps fresher samples have that? Overhaul an excellent beer that I will drink again and again."
"Served on tap in my home bar into proper .5L glassware. Pours a hazy straw yellow with about an inch of fluffy white head. Smell is citrusy with some orange and corriander present along with some bubblegum scents. Taste is smooth, citrusy and a touch spicy. Fairly mild compared to german wheat beer counterparts. Insanely drinkable. My only problem is the mouthfeel, its a touch thin. That may be more a characteristic of the style rather than this beer though. A very solid representation of the witbier style and a great session beer. If you're not paying attention its way to easy to drink 3 L of this in one sitting without blinking."
"Ut vivat, crescat, floreat!"
"I had this on tap in London last month and it was divine. It is served with a lemon which accents the spicey and citrus tastes. The smell is of spices and lemon or orange peels. It came in the Hoegaarden Hexagonal serving glass which accentuates the experience. In the glass it is cloudy white with a little bit of yellow mixed in. The smell is of spices. If poured correctly (a technique which I have since mastered with my own Hexagonal glass and the Hoegaarden bottles I get at my liqour store) the head just hits the tips of the glass adding about half an inch to and inch at the top. Highly Recommended. This is my favorite Witbier."
"Finally tried this on tap at Ri Ra's in Charlotte after having a dozen chances before. Excellent witbier to say the least. Served with a lemon slice which affected the true taste. Sweet malts and hazy appearance. Could have drank this the entire evening but wanted to try some onther new ones as well. My wife really enjoyed this one as well."
"one of my favorite types of beer, and one of the finest beers I've had recently, highly recommended"
"12 oz., best before October 5, '05. Served chilled in an imperial pint glass. The beer pours a very pale, cloudy yellow/straw color with a 2 finger white head that doesn't leave lacing but remains until the end. Lots of bananas, coriander, and lemon in the nose, along with a hint of orange. The flavor is essentially the same but there is much less flavor than the aroma led me to believe. The carbonation is crisp and the body is very thin, bordering on too thin. It is refreshing and easy to drink but Hoegaarden couldn't keep me satisfied all night because I need more flavor and body than it delivers. Perhaps this is true to style, as it is my first witbier, but it just doesn't do it for me."
"Notes: Very good Belgian Wit."
"A cloudy pale yellow, almost white beer. Has a big bright foamy white head. There is a light citrusy, lemony aroma with some clove in the background. A prickely carbonation starts the flavor and leads it into a light lemony sweetness. Which is followed by some corriander and a bit of clove in the back."
"Slightly expensive in Australia, but worth the money. Definetly a good summer beer. Very drinkable. Even non beer drinkers would find it appealing."
"Served on tap at the Barley Mill in Calgary in the 500ml chunky Hoe glass. Yellowish (lemonade as others have described) in color with haziness from the suspended yeast. Short bright white head, but thick and stable and leaves some nice lace. A beautiful presentation that starts everyone around you whispering ""what is that?"" The aroma is quite citrusy, but clearly can smell the coriander and orange peel. The flavor is sweet and citrus. Very well balanced and refreshing. Light but still very complex. The standard for witbier, even with the Interbrew stigma"
"Served to me in a 23oz. mug, on draught. Looked exactly like a tall glass of lemonade, and truthfully the taste was not too far off of that. I think I like this beer from the bottle a little bit more. Lemon-citrus flavors explode in your mouth with a bannana-like aftertaste. This is nothing like I remember this beer to be when I first tried it several years ago in a bottle (right when it was first imported to the States). Still, an interesting brew. Seemed a bit too sweet so I could not order another one."
"The spice characteristic of this beer is quite strong: cloves, pepper and nutmeg are all evident. There is a heavy orange citrus that blends perfectly with the spice. A sweet bubblegum flavor balances out the heat. The mouthfeel is heavy but well carbonated."
"The taste was sweet and sour - lots of traditional wheat characteristics with nice malt and yeast. A spicy fruitiness is followed by a sour aftertaste that lingers for quite a while. Neither thick nor oily, it was a very pleasant session beer. Highly recommended."
"This beast pours a foggy wheat color with a white head that diminished substantially, but didn't completely evaporate. The bottle denotes that this cloudiness is to be expected, as it is unfiltered. The nose is strong in grains with a bit of acidity and fruits. It tastes of yeast, hops, and a modest sweetness on the end. This is a gem, in my book anyway. Enjoyable year-round!"
"Light in body and very drinkable. Pair this with spicy Thai or Indian food."
"I would have loved to try this beer before Interbrew/InBev got its hands on it. Still a world class beer in my opinion. When I eventually get to Belgium (I'll do it sometime in my life) I'll have to give it a try to see how it compares. Very refreshing and very easy to drink, which epitomizes a witbier."
"This beer is the supposed king of white beers. Besides it's impressive history, I can see why, too--a very drinkable and tasty lunch beer."
"Drinkability- This has always been one of my favorites. Much better from the tap than the bottle as most beers are. One of the most refreshing beers I have had."
"overall a fairly good beer. didnt seem to work as well as a hefeweizen. but thats just my opinion."
"Wit is one of my favorite styles. I am quite familiar with the style and brew it often myself. This is a fantastic example of the style; much better than I remember from past years from this brewery. It is crisp and tart and refreshing, with only a hint of astringency to mar an other wise perfect experience."
"Very drinkable. Probably would have had another if the boss hadn't been sitting there."
"So, anyway. I don't like the taste of this beer and I""ll never buy it again. However, I do recognize it as a solid beer, even though it doesn't suit my taste."
"Pours a cloudy yellow with a foamy white head that laces well. Aroma was a strong citrus smell with some spiciness as well, very different than other beers. Taste was refreshing like most witbiers, though this one tastes a little watery. Very citrusy and some coriander, definitely pleasant but use a little more ""oompf"". Light mouthfeel, but refreshing. I prefer this on draft on the bigger (20oz.) glass, but you must be careful, as many bartenders insist on adding a lemon wedge to it... It is much better without (of course)."
"The smell is a little light but still nice, having a bit of a citrus kick. The flavor in the taste similarly good but light. Spice undertones finish it off. The mouthfeel is smooth and light, and it's easy to drink."
"Well worth a try.. and try again!"
"A little thin and fizzy/tangy for my likes, but good. Very drinkable, almost like a spicy, natural orange pop."
"Pale lemon color with creamy white head. Spicy chap stick aroma with eucalyptus to boot. Thin, acidic, carbonated lemon juice. Bleh, what the hell. Perhaps I will need to revisit this one. For now it was too phenolic, too thin, and too lemony. This can't be the beer that inspired so many other wonderful beers."
"Well this beer is on tap at a local bar. I walked in and told them it was my 21st birthday, which it was, and the owner poured me a Hoegaarden. Jeez, it was a delightful beer! It tastes pretty much the same in bottles, which i'm drinking now. Buy this beer!"
"A very delicate and light beer thats really delicious. One of my favourites."
"Pours hazy hazy white with yellow tinge, looks like lemonade. A little head that swirls around while lingering. Tastes include yeasts (soury) with citrus and banana notes. But, all the flavors meld very beautifully. Smoothness is incredible. It's without doubt one of my favorite beers...ever."
"An cloudy pale yellow with a large, if somewhat soapy looking, white head. Nice lemon and orange citrus aromas. Starts off with primarily lemon and orange flavors, but quickly develops into spiciness and finishes with some balancing bitterness. A very well-executed intermingling of flavors, if perhaps a bit timid compared to past years. Light and creamy body which is appropriate to the style but not particularly distinctive. A very tasty and refreshing witbier which can be especially enjoyable on a hot summer day. Too bad it's less flavor-full than it used to be."
"Drinkability: One of the easiest beers in the world to drink loads of. It tastes pretty good, is totally refreshing and it's straightforward witbier-ness doesn't challenge your brain too much while you're drinking it."
"12oz bottle. Poured a nice cloudy pale straw color with a good bit of head. Had a nice peppery smell with a hint of lemon zest. The taste was fantastic. Wits are among my favorites so I've tried many lately and this one never disappoints. Overall, a great beer. PR 4.75"
"This is still a fine beer. I never had a chance to drink Hoegaarden in its heyday, but I do know it is a good choice for a summer's day. (or any day you need refreshment)"
"Easily consumable; very pleasant drinking, nothing spectacular in terms of flavor but a nice witbier nonetheless."
"The mouthfeel, at least for me, seems a bit stretched. Perhaps this is a more delicate beer than Im used to, but I have had some witts that are more chewy. Easy drinking beer here. This beer is a perfect compliment to a long, lazy, causal day of conversation on the deck or in the bar."
"This beer was very nice, poured a cloudy grapefruit color, smelled very citrusy, and tasted like an excellent wheat, without the cloves, which is what I guess it is! mouthfeel is light yet a bit creamy as well, very good! drinkability is excellent both in taste and abv, could drink these all night, no problem! Highly recommended!"
"I swear I reviewed this before, but it ain't here. Still arguably the best of the style. Crisp, citrusy, and quite refreshing. The epitome of the style. Lots of lemon flavor, nice, fluffy head. If I were to recommend a wit, it would be either this one or Allagash."
"12.oz. bottle. Has a cloudy, straw color with a decent head. Reeks of a spiced up polish sausage.Has a tangy, tart, sour lemon and clove-spice flavor.Light bodied. I've tried this brew a few times and still can't get past the extreme sour, tart flavor here."
"Extremely drinkable."
"212"
"on a re-review, in comparing this to Flying Dog In-Heat-Wheat and Avery White Rascal, this has a more flowery taste. Should I campare, maybe not, but for my own notes, it helps."
"This was a good, but far from great beer. It pours a cloudy orange and smells of lemon. The taste is spicy, with a peppery taste from the yeast the defining taste. This is a beer that I could enjoy during any season and as my first or last beer of the night, but only if there is nothing better available."
"Pours light with a quickly fading head. Citrus scents can be picked up with a little banana as well. The beer goes down like water with little flavor up front but midway through you pick up the banana and citrus flavors. The finish is very refreshing but leaves you wanting a bit more. A very easy beer to drink lots of on a hot day."
"Pours a hazed lemony yellow color into a traditional 6-sided Hoegaarden tumbler with a white head that dies pretty quickly. Some banana-like esters, toasted coriander, bubblegum like wheaty sweetness, and citrus notes in the aroma. Watery and slightly acidic upfront, then floral maltiness and traditional witbier spices kick in. A little heavier on the coriander than typifies the style. Hops are kept to a minimum, other than some Hersbrucker or other low alpha hop. Carbonation is good and keeps it drinkable, but it seems to lack something that I can't put my finger on even though I've had this beer numerous times. Maybe a touch more body and depth..."
"Taste is citrusy, coriander and spicy with an orange juice sweetness finish. This is a refreshing, drinkable and enjoyable summer brew. Perfect for a day like today in early August. This style really seems to be a staple lately and Hoegaarden nails this beer down. Recommended."
"had this at The Brittish Brewing Co. in Hyannis, MA. Bright hazy yellow with a decent white head. Smells fresh, sweet and citrusy. Some earthy mustiness too. The flavor has hints of light lemon in the middle, a little tart at the end, and the mouthfeel is watery. I like mine with the lemon squeezed in, I think it add more to the lemon character that is already there and turns this beer from a light flavored beer into something with a little kick."
"Smelled cirtus and a slight scent of banana. Malts, a bit of yeast and choriander came on the first drink, finishing smooth with a hint of lemon, maybe pine. Soft in texture, bubbly refreshing and light enough for another two or three."
"Nice amount of carbonation, very easy, drinkable beer."
"On tap at EJs in Baden. Served in the manditory Hoegaarden tumbler. Lovely 2 finger frothy cap...milky-straw color. Better nose than the bottled..mild fragrant spices, citrus and a musty note. Lemmon-peppery mouthfeel nice departure of clove and limes over sweet malts... clean dry finish. Much better on tap... possibly fresher...but definately better. A sedate and true white ale that still delivers refreshing taste."
"I had the pleasure to have this beer on tap in Holland. The color is cloudy yellow and it looks very appealing it draws you to it. The smell is of light hops, spice, lemon, and very yeasty. Mouthfeel is heavier than expected but is very drinkable and refreshing. It was served with a lemon slice but I like it without a lemon slice as well. It came with a nice head but didn't have good head retention. It left lacing all the way down the glass.Overall in my opinion this is a very good belgian brew."
"12 ounce bottle with best before dating of about a year from the date of this review. Pours a dull almost gray- lightest of straw tones, very cloudy. Lifting a world class white head and leaving top notch lacing. Nose is soft, lemon, sugar and soap. Creamy soft mouthfeel. Notes of, of course, lemons, vanilla, honey, melon and spice. Yeasty and pleasant. This stuff is great with anything you put on your plate during the warm months. Very drinkable, it tastes so good. A classic for good reason."
"Hoegaarden is one is the first beers I tried that made me realize there is more to beer that macroswill lager. pours a pale yellow and cloudly, almost milky. Giant head like a witbier should have. The aroma is of sweet malts balanced by coriander, bitter orange and herbal hops. The flavor is very well balanced, incredibly crisp refreshing and complex. The only downside is its a bit watery. Michael Jackson said that it used to have more flavor. The mouthfeel is luscious and great. Overall this is a no fail drink, close to perfection IMO."
"pale lemon sorbet color - very pretty with a huge head that slowly dissipates to a 1/4 inch head that stays the course with you. smells like a bread box no longer used but remembers its salad days. taste is so refreshing that it's hard to attend to flavor: a good beer's job, no? does carry a tang of lemon, but for the most part, the great carbonation balances that bread-dough, yeasty wheat taste that in lesser witbiers weighs down the drink. rather than profile, i guess you can say that the flavors function as a silhouette of the *beer* in se. i especially enjoy the bitter - smoothly bitter - kick at the start."
"a nice light light yellow beer with a nice thick although short head. It is very carbonated which brings out a lot of the flavors and smells. It has a nice yeasty aroma with hints of citrus and is slightly fruity. There are some light spice aromas and tastes but are subtle enough not to overpower. A nice light body but with lots of flavors. The taste is nice and smooth with hints of of fruits and not too bitter. Its clean and light. Overall a great summer beer!"
"This ale is a bit spendy, but it is worth the extra cash to try a beer that is seemingly true to style."
"Cloudy butter amber/straw colour with a dense, bright white head that produced plenty of lace. It had a crisp aroma, with lots of citrus and a hint of coriander spiciness. Spice carried into the flavour with some sourness and a bitter citrus finish. It had a creamy texture with light carbonation and a light body, perfect for summer. The raw wheat helped keep my palate dry, making it easy to have another."
"Drinkability: If you enjoy the taste, you can drink this until the proverbial cows come home."
"This is highly drinkable. I could down many of these in a session. Unfortunately, I've never seen this in bottles in my area. Otherwise, I'd keep this in mind for accompanying summer grilling."
"Goes down very easily, very little alcohol apparant, much better on tap, but a great treat for the summer"
"Fresh from the tap, cloudy and pale yellow. Reminds me of lemon juice or lemonade. Had just sat there and watched them tap the fresh keg, so this first pour came with a ton of head that reduced quite quickly to a light head, then nothing at all. Lattice lacing. Such a great aroma of bananas. I love the lemon with my wheat bears, just feel it is part of the whole experience, I love citrus. I love the scent of the banana and lemon intermingling, and the flavor of them together. This has such a clean and fresh flavor to it, so very refreshing and light. Mild and mellow finish. Perfect for days in the sun, but so perfect for anytime of the year too. Just a great session beer."
"I liked this beer from the bottle, but on-tap, this is killer stuff. Hazy light yellow for a color with a nice amount of carbonation. Smell consisted of oranges, lemons, some ginger in there as well. Taste held up to form as well. Slighty on the sweet side, but it balances it out with the ginger which you can taste all the way through the aftertaste. Again, killer stuff on-tap."
"Cloudy, yeasty, yellow pour. Smelled very citrusy. Taste was a yeasty bomb goodness. Drank quickly and well. I didn't try it with the lemon slice, so that I could take in the overall flavors. I definitely dig the overwhelming yeast taste, which allowed it to pair well with pizza and sample a few other beers without being overwhelmed."
"Smells agree with taste - yeasty and citrus"
"Opaque hazy yellow golden color. Lots of citrus, wheat and yeast come to the nose. Sweetness. The taste is of peach, citrus and wheat. Fruity, sweet but not excessively, almost iodated. Hops aren't really noticeable. Very drinkable. Maybe lacking some complexity in the mouthfeel but definitely drinkable. A great summer session brew."
"Overall, okay, and rasonably drinkable; i'd just prefer a flavor not clouded wit a sulfiric tone."
"Hoegaarden was my favorite beer before I got heavily into beer tasting. This beer is an unfiltered wheat that is combined with orange peel and a little bit of a peppery taste to make an excellent white ale. This is essentially the grandpa of that style. It drinks easily, pouring with a medium thickness white head and hiding its biterness until the very end thanks to the citrus flavors. Most anyone who has had Hoegaarden enjoys it and it comes recommended. It does seem to have less to it when you drink this beer on tap, though, so I recommend the bottles. (odd, isn't it?)"
"An OK brew I like stronger stuff normally, I prefer Duvel."
"Drinkability: I think there are better whites than this, but it is still very good and I think that one could drink this every day."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and rich, superb carbonation that tickles the tongue, but doesn't bite. Utterly delicious brew, a six pack would be a blast."
"Deserves all the credit it gets."
"Almost as widely available in France as Kronenbourg or Amstel, the venerable Hoegaarden is much better than both. Even bars that have a weak selection of French macro lagers carry this, so it's been my salvation on numerous nights out. Not amazing, but very solid  the perfect introduction to the witbier style for new drinkers."
"This beer feels somewhat controlled to me. I think I'd prefer a wilder witbeer, with more character in the smell and taste, and a more aggressive mouthfeel. Great beer to drink though."
"This is a text book Belgian White Beer. While reviewing the BJCP guidelines, everything was nearly to style. The beer poured a slightly cloudy, bright golden. The head was white and fluffy but melted faster than I had expected. The aroma was somewhat fruity and the malts and hops were overpowered. The flavor was full but more subtle than I expected. The fruitiness came through and the bitterness - not from the hops - bit my tongue. I was expecting more a raucous flavor palate but was good. The mouthfeel was a little more than light and the carbonation and acid did play with my tongue. I find this a very drinkable beer and would recommend it for someone looking to try their first wit beer."
"Big, white, fizzy head leaves spotty lacing. Beer is cloudy, pale, yellow tending to white-yellow. Buttery, bready, spicy nose. Nice. The front is spicy/peppery with a touch of schpoenck. But then it disappears. Very subtle body. Finishes dry, nicely bitter with some butter. This is a pretty good, tasty, dry wit. Could be a little more fruity for my tastes. Or at least a little more character of some kind."
"I followed the directions on the back of the bottle on how to pour this beer and the result was an extremely cloudy lemon color beer with a large frothy white head. Looked like carbonated real lemonade. Lots of lacing. The nose was tarty and acidic but in a very good way. The taste was really nice. Citric fruits with some sweetness were upfront accompanied by a peppery spice. The middle lost its sweetness and become tartier but was still fruity in taste. Coriander seemed to come into the mix there. There is also a wheat precense that seems to come with a clove flavor that reminds of a good hefe. Yeast provides a background and mixes well with the fruity flavors. Acidic finish lingers in my mouth. This is a beer that I could drink all night!"
"Wow, this beer is silky smooth, has a great coriander/orange aroma and a wonderful mouthfeel, very soft and inviting. So much more subtle and tasty than any other Belgian White I have tried. Too many other beers of this genre overdo the spices, this one gets it just right. I could drink these all night, but I would probably fall off my barstool. I think this beer would go wonderfully with some spicy food, or with something that has hints of curry."
"The real strength of the beer is its mouthfeel. This beer seems to dance on your toungue. The taste is of citrus and spice and is interesting. Would I have another? Probably one, but this i wouldn't drink this all night."
"All in all a highly recommended, reasonably priced weissbeir. Cheers!"
"Ahh, the original Belgian witbier. The bottle has directions on how to properly pour it. Basically, pour half, swirl bottle, pour rest. So I did. When all the beer was in my pilzner glass, the beer was a hazy, dark yellow. Like good lemonade with sediment. Massive, three finger head that disipated down to two. Nice, real nice. Hmm, what a smell. Big aroma of bread/yeast, floral citrus, various sweet peppers and spices, barley and wheat malts. Terrific taste. The sweet malts, spices and peppers are balanced well with the citrus and hop acidity. The mouthfeel is a little chunky. One of the negative effects of the yeast, perhaps. Delicious, terrific beer nonetheless. I wonder how long the remaining four bottles will last?"
"The color intrigues, and the flavor carries through on that initial impression. It's spicy and fresh, making it a thoroughly drinkable and enjoyable affair. The fun flavor and frivolous nature make this beer one that can be enjoyed during the warmer times, while the savory character make it a cooler weather quaff as well, quite a four seasons kind of concoction. And the overall lightness of being make it something you can pretty much indulge as much as you'd like. I will gladly have this one again, no matter what time of year, and I'll look forward to that time with a Mona Lisa smile on my face."
"Drinkability: All night long . . . baby"
"Cheers"
"The beer pours a wonderfully creamy light gold topped with a thin white lace. It smells of malt and citrus fruits. The taste is light and pleasing with dash of malt in the start and citric bite in the finish. It is slightly oily and carbonated. This is a wonderful beer to drink. It is not too heavy or too strong and has a taste that you will always find fits your mood."
"This is a very good beer that has enough character to make it complex but also has the right combination of elements to make it a beer to drink after strenuous activity."
" I can't think of many ales that top this one in terms of drinkability. This would be an ideal session ale."
"Very good head, nice cloudy appearance, definitely an appealing looking beer. Strong floral scent, with some fruit. I think I smell cinnamon apples as well as a definite banana scent. Nice mouthfeel, assertive but not overpowering. Definite fruit flavors, slight citrus flavors. Definitely a nice brew that I could drink several of."
"I guess this would be the standard for belgian witbier, and it honors that distinction by being a well made wit, not deviating from the style definition at all. Extremely easy drinking, without any bitterness that might turn away your average macro drinker. I'd recommend this to anyone looking to explore the world of beer. It makes a fine transitional brew that's different enough from typical adjunct lager, but not too challenging on the palate."
"this is a really nice white...it poured a lucid pale lemon yellow slightly hazy...ever so slightly...it had a thin white head and a definite nose full of clove corriander and more clove...think walking into an indian food market..that's the smell...and the flavor is like on the verge of citris that craves a lemon slice and follows with that wonderful clove and corriander with a twinge of wheat taste. This beer is odd to me...because i could both imagine drinking it at christmas with that spice but at the same time the drinkability and crispness of it...i could also see myself drinking it with lemon slices on a summer day on a beach in maine...versatile i suppose"
"Nice and easy drink... finish is mild but long lasting."
"This one pours a cloudy light golden color and topped with a nice white head. The aroma is the star, lots of nice corriander, orange, wheat and yeast. A light body greets you, followed by a spicy mixture of corriander, wheat, and clove , finishing with a big corriander kiss. It has a refreshing carbonation but could use a bit more body for me to really desire it more often."
"Flavor- The aroma follows through with a very nice, light mouthfeel, but with a series of grassy/herbal flavors. The citrus is much more subdued than I have had from on-tap Hoegaarden. The pucker of yeast is strong as well. Very nice all the way round!"
"Pours a beautiful hazy, waxy lemon yellow with a towering, fluffy white head. Smells of lemongrass, lemonhead candy, yeast, some banana ester, very nice. Taste is tangy wheat malt, with a citrus/banana character. Peppery with a hint of clove, and definite yeast. Wheat bitter finish that lasts awhile. A very good witbier, and I can't believe it took me this long to finally have this classic."
"Incidentally, I've tasted a concoction that mixes Hoegaarden with Lindemans Framboise. The name: A Dirty Ho. Not for me. A little too sweet."
"Smells like a White beer, looks like it. Taste is some carbonation and some of that fruit. Also honey and citrus. Could be apple, grapefruit, even spearmint. Couldn't finish so it was good that it was popular with my mates. Would be refreshing summer ale. Had on-tap in March 2005 and was terrible, again in May 2005 and was marginal again."
"Flavor starts a bit sweeter and more peppery than most wheat beers I've sampled; almost along the lines of a light belgian ale. However, the taste profile quickly changes to cloves and a fairly sour middle and finish. Fruity esters are minimal; sticks to spices. Fairly high carbonation overshadows a nice yeast and wheat body."
"Had this on-tap at Warren Tavern in Lakewood. It came with a nice white head on a cloudy, pale yellow brew. Smells spicy and a bit like alcohol. This tastes okay, spicy and somewhat bitter and sort of like bread, I swear. This is a drinkable brew but not my favorite."
"Even taking into account the natural pallor of white beers, Hoegaarden's appearance was disappointing. It was nearly impossible to pick up on any subtlety or nuance in its light-straw color through the thick wheat haze. This beer had a hoppy, clean smell with just a hint of hops and citrus. Bubbly and crisp, its mouthfeel overpowered the almost candy-like textures of the beer. Oddly, though, the aftertaste is much maltier than expected, with a fading bitterness. All in all, a fairly decent beer, though probably not worth the hype."
"It still tastes like a Hoegaarden. A great spice kick and a nice, refreshing crispness. It is very drinkable, though I've never made a night out of Hoegaarden whites. Maybe that will be an idea for the summer."
"Very light and refeshing, zesty feel, a little sour. Good in the winter, would be even better in the summer."
"I think that all people with even a slight interested in beer should at least try a Hoegaarden once."
"....And to think that I had been warned against sampling this one"
"What a refreshing beer! This is something that goes down extremely easily and complements food better than most beers I have had."
"Bottle - Hazy white brew with a nice white foamy head with good retention. Aroma of coriander is strong but pleasant. Body is medium and good have been a bit stronger. Very refreshing beer for those hot summer days. Wow, this is a good beer but I wouldn't have expected people to rate this one that high!"
"John"
"Kegged version seems to have a bit more to it both on the palate and the nose. Good to see this popping up around town at non-belgium bars."
"Wheat beers aren't my favorite, but there are far better than this."
"The appearance is gorgeous - cloudy yellow with a small white head that lacks contour but retains extremely well and leaves some lace. The nose is outstanding - fruity, tangy, wheaty. The mouth is light and prickly, as it should be. Some much for the nice things I have to say. The taste was, well, the diplomatic term would be ""subdued"". I struggled to find anything, and came up with wheat and citrus. There are no hops, no malt, no redeeming qualities. The taste of this bottle was surprisingly bland, even tasteless. I was hugely disappointed in what turns out to be the Corona of witbiers. No thanks."
"It's hazy, and there's no mistaking its wheaty characteristics. In trendy UK bars, it's a good choice from the tap or bottle. However, at home, it's not the best, it's just ""good"". I think this beer is better with food than alone. Certainly a good summer thirst quencher."
"F"
"A nice hazy straw color. Kind of looks like the frozen lemonade with the little bit of hazy going on. The glass filled with about an inch head and the aroma of wheat and citrus. The first taste is of citrus, clove and coriander. It is very nice going down with a little hint of spice that is not overpowering. This beer is very drinkable. Would be perfect for a summer day or like me year round. An all around good beer that I would never pass up if offered"
"($8.79 / 6-pack)"
"Note: This is my second Hoegaarden. The first one made me sick, so I wanted to stick it out and try another to insure it wasn't just a bad batch or something. But this one still just tastes nasty to me. The wheat taste just is nauseating to me. I know the reviews are supposed to be relative to it's style, but I haven't had many other white beers to compare this too, and the ones that i have had were not so sickening to me. Perhaps I'm allergic to the style or something, but I just can't recommend this."
"It tasted good, and it has a nice feel to it. It is a good beer but not as special as the price."
"The taste makes things no different either. The weakness ruins it because it appears as though the pale tone of the beer is caused by someone adding too much water to it and making it less tasteful. But, oh, well, a decent beer anyways."
"Pours a very pale cloudy yellow color - the description white is very appropriate. A snow white head of small bubbles sits lightly on top of the brew until receding to a thin lace. The aroma is citric with noticeable orange and lemon notes. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth with a zesty bite towards the end. Orange and lemon notes from the aroma, along with yeast notes, are quite noticeable on the palate, with the orange tending to come though a bit more in the finish. A touch of spice is also evident, although I cant pick it up quite as much as I would have expected to. This is definitely a refreshing beer with a fairly light, crisp mouthfeel. Im drinking it in October, but it seems that it would make a great summer brew."
"The perfect beer for a warm summer day. Pours cloudy pale gold with a creamy white head. The aroma is sweet and sour from the blending of wheat and spices. The flavor are smooth and crisp, with a perfect balance of sweetness from the malt and wheat, with orange peel and coriander all in a beer with a decent mouthfeel. This beer is exceptionally drinkable and should be in your regular rotation of summer beers."
"Picked up in England by a friend. The benchmark ""IMO"" for the wit beer style. Im not a big fan of yeasty brews but enjoyed thisone much. I poured the bottle into a rather large, oversize Hoegaarden glass, he also brought. It poured a cloudy straw pale color with a carbonated white head. Lace was not a factor. The aroma was of citrus lemon. The taste was fruity with a lite drying hop finish. Clearly the zest of lemon and coriander stand out most. The mouth feels the soft carbonation or foam like texture, left alittle dry. This was more than I expected for a wit, while also living up to what I expected a Hoegaarden to be! Good stuff!"
"A classic no matter how you slice it. Perhaps the most widely known of the style here in the states and the best selling (ya want to not like it!) as well. But, the bottom line is this is a very nice beer! I love the pale pastel lemon/yellow color and the textbook snow white head. The aromatics are focused and distinctly fresh orange zest and coriander in a very nicely balanced package. The mouthfeel is at once refreshing and cleansing-light to medium bodied. Flavors are very much orange, especially orange zest, and malted wheat. Spice notes trail on the finish and add dimension. This is an amazingly drinkable wit that I will continue to enjoy and look forward to drinking."
"Pours out a cloudy off-yellow with a very serious head (and I mean big) - well, its a wit. Suddenly no head and hardly any lace at all. Smells of yeast, malt, my wife's bread and some fruit. And like everybody says it is nice and spicey with a serious sense of a mouthful. Don't gulp. Drink and savour and enjoy."
"Overall Impression: Since it is considered the ""hallmark"" of this style in many circles, I was compelled to give it a 3.0 across the board. It's good. It was better before Interbrew, though (at the risk of sounding trite). I just think there are some other far superior wits out there. Two that readily come to mind are Blanche de Chambly and Wittekerke."
"On tap poured into a Hoegaarden glass. It pours a cloudy light yellow color with two fingers of head. There is a little bit of lace left on the glass. The smell consists of wheat, yeast, and citrus. A Pretty sweet smell. The taste starts with a yeasty wheat and malt flavor with some lemon. The finish is slightly hoppy. The mouthfeel is just a little bit light. The drinkability is very good. A nice solid Wit."
"Pretty and crunchy like tissue. Tissue-beer. I'm sure that will enter the tasting lexicon soon: ""tissue-beer."""
"Again, I love this beer, so forgive me for my gushing."
"I ordered this beer on tap at a local bar. It was fairly expensive, but I've heard good things about this beer and I wanted to try it out. It was a light yellow color, as the name might indicate, and was very cloudy. It was served with a lemon wedge, something that annoys me. It tasted like a hefeweizen with a hint of fruit flavor. Very smooth and drinkable, with no after taste. I'd drink more of it if it weren't so expensive. If you ever find it on tap, give it a try."
"this one is hard to beat on a hot summer day."
"Now this is definitely a white beer, pours out cloudy, the colour of diluted alfalfa honey. Smell is more subdued than I recall, a light peppery citrus. Sweetish flavour, that peppered citrus once again. This is very drinkable stuff and goes down very easy, I think I just might make it a session beer one night the next decent place I find it on tap. It beats Stella anytime for having a Belgian for a regular."
"Very yellow pale color, very hazy. Large head. Aroma is fruity and yeasty. Medium bodied wit beer. Fruity flavor, with oranges, coriander and ginger being the primary flavors. It a mildly sweet, lightly malty and slightly bitter beer. Clean, light and refreshing. Nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly swe"
"Poured a nice light hazey golden, rich carbonation with an uneven head. Aroma was slight and of cider. Taste was also disappointingly mellow. Slight malt, dominating cider taste, though dominating is an awfully strong word to describe the taste with, as it was not an impression maker. Similar sweet, sugary and malty flavor with a candy feeling left on the tongue. Easy to drink and a nice after working beer. Still, not up to the previous Wits I'd tasted."
"This beer pours a cloudy yellow (straw) color with a thick white head that leaves nice lacing on the glass. It was served on tap at the local pub with an orange slice on the rim of the glass. The aroma was very spicy with some fruityness backing it up. The flavor was not as spicy as the aroma would have predicted, but still just spicy enough to make for an interesting drink. There is also a very strong orange taste to notice. I really liked this beer and will have it again many times in the future -- if only it weren't so expensive."
"Poured according to the instructions on the bottle. Nice pale yellow color with fizzy white lasting head, with bubbles snaking their way up from the bottom of the glass. Smell is of orange peel and some lemon zesty-ness with a light yeast aroma. Taste is lively with nice spiciness that you would expect from a great Witbier. Not the same amount of flavour as the top beers in this category, however. Has a nice citrus, orange peel bite on the finish. Very drinkable. This is a great beer especially considering its mass produced nature. I'd love to try this in Belgium!"
"I finally broke down and bought a six pack of Hoegaarden. I had too. It poured a light, cloudy, almost void of what I consider beer color. A nice white lacey head though. My impressions were two fold as I will explain. The first beer was great. Nice hops, almost a wheat like taste. It went down great. I wanted more. Now the rub. It seemed to ""weaken"" as I drank on, almost begging for a lemon wedge. No, I thought, don't give in to the evil citris wedge. I fought the impulse and paid the price: a bland beer."
"Comments  I know the style is supposed to be light, but this was just a little bit TOO light for me."
"this one tasted much different on tap than in bottles. much more carbonated and crispy mouthfeel this time. also, no yeast residue, so it was slightly less spicy. still plenty of great coriander flavor, so no complaints here. a very versatile summer beer that is becoming a staple in trendy restaurants. an all around cool beer."
"Very refreshing. I would say I like the Allagash White more than this one (maybe due to the freshness of it on tap at the GLB). However, this beer is good, and thankfully available at many places, so I will definitely seek it out again. pat"
"Appeared like lemonade with a nice head. Got this offering as a 4 pack for my birthday. The smell was citrusy which gave a hint of what the brew would taste like. I admit that drinking this brew on the same night as an IPA was different, so I had to be open minded. The nicely carbonated brew was light and fruity in taste. I had to remember to half pour, swirl the yeast. then pour the rest. The resulting mouthfeel was smooth and light. Drinkability was excellent. One of the best in this category that I have sampled to date."
"Had this on tap last week. Pours out a cloudy yellow with a nice head. Smell is fruity with some malt character in there. Taste is good, but not that complex or well-defined. Some fruit in there along with yeast and malt with almost no hop bitterness. A nice quaffable beer that is refreshing..."
"Very enjoyable overall."
"Once again truly delightful Belgian ale. A white beer and white it is with a big soft head and a very light and hazy appearance. The nose is one of citrus and coriander with a slight sharpness to it. Taste wise Hoegaarden is in some ways slightly reminiscent of a cider, the citrus that could be smelled is still evident as is a slight tartness (perhaps from the particular yeasts used). It is very soft in the mouth and definitely a beer that I could drink all night. Hoegaarden goes well with many foods, last night I enjoyed it with camembert and lime, a combination that truly enhanced the sharp citrus flavours it contains."
"Hoegaarden is a great beer. If not for the price, I would gladly never set down a pint of this from about May until September. It is refreshing, drinkable, and very tasty. I often get pitchers of this and sometimes I'll even garnish with the lemon slices that accompany it (though I hear people complain about it, I enojy the lemon at times, other times I just set it to the side-- no big deal. I see no reason to send it back or flip out about it. You can't expect every 20 something bartender to know the customs of serving a belgian beer. anyway) Ho pours the most unique looking pint of beer I've ever seen (sadly, the bar I frequent does not carry the right glass for it, so I take it in a pint glass). It has a lemon yellow body with a very hazy efferfescent look. Atop sits a tall fluffy head of white lace. Smells of citrus immeadiately predominate. The first taste is delicately sweet with a very refreshing mouthfeel. The aftertaste allows you to notice the spices used in flavoring the brew, most notably corriander and some clove. Orange, banana, and the taste of yeast all combine to make a very interesting taste, but one that is not strong at all. Essentially, this is a great beer to just sit back and enjoy, not to scrutinize over. The original Belgian wit is an experience all its own. Enjoy!"
"This beer came to me a lemony yellow color that had a cloudy haze to it. It produced a pure white head that was creamy but not lasting, it fell and stayed as a ring on the sides of the glass, which produced a small amount of lace in some areas. The aromas were of citrus fruits (oranges (light), lemons), big spices (pepper, clove), light malt (warmer), and wheat grain. The tastes were of wheat, citrus fruits (lemons), spice (pepper), and light hops. Finished and left a dry wheat feel in the mouth. Light bodied which is perfect for summer. This is a smooth beer that is nice and spicy, quenches the thirst. Clean, rich, tart and sour all can be said about each sip. Not too bad !"
"Drinkability: this is strikingly similar to the German hefe's except Hoegaarden is not as heavy. This beer's low %ABV and smoothness make it a wonderful summertime refresher. Very easy to put away."
"Amazingly good brew for a hot summer day. Very refreshing and thirst quenching."
"Hoegaarden pours an incredibly pale yellow from the tap with a fizzy, retaining 1/4-inch head. Lacing is nice down the glass. The smell is a fresh melding of coriander, curacao, and earthy hops. Taste-wise is more of the same, with the spices and citrus notes playing major roles. This is a light-bodied brew which is lightly carbonated and refreshing. Due to its moderately low alcohol content and variety of flavors, this makes a perfect summertime choice. I prefer the tap version to that from the bottle. The classic Belgian wit."
"The original white beer from Belgium.. I used to really love this beer but alas my taste buds changed and Belgian style White beers just seem to have that odd coriander and orange peel flavor along with the fizzy head that doesn't meaure up to German style Weizen's IMO.. It is an interesting beer and with its low ABV very drinkable and not as carbonated as a wheat so enjoy if you can find on tap.. which is not difficult these day."
"On draught at The Claddagh in Columbus, OH. It might be blasphemy to say so, but I like Blue Moon more than this. Pours a light gold color with a thin white head. Bubbly with very thin lacing. Aroma is very bready and yeasty and clean. Light-bodied and slightly sour flavor under the wheat. I could not detect much spice or citrus which usually makes Wits more tolerable to me. The finish is a little watery, with more yeast and a little banana."
"Thx"
"This brew would be best purchased by the case, as I did, to ensure you do not run out during those long, hot summer days. Drinkability is off the scale - truly refreshing!"
"This Belgian White poured a large invigorating white creamy head with fine-small bubbles. The lacing was sparse on the sides of my glass. The body was a cloudy yellow. The aroma was fruity in my opinion and it had a slight bitter taste to it. I truly enjoyed drinking this brew while it lasted, right thedm?? This brew went down way too smooth!!"
"This brew poured an envigorated head of creamy fine white bubbles and a carbonated cloudy light yellow body. It had a mild banana-hop aroma. It started fizzy and buttery then finshed smoothly in a banana floral flavor. Indeed, this was another very nice brew."
"Pours a beautifull pale yellow(almost white) colour. What's worth mentiong about this beer is that it is very smooth and goes down loke water.An impressive Belgian Style Wheat/White beer. A nice choice when you are lookinfg for a beer to compliment your steak or any other food."
"A true Belgian classic that is very easy to find,pours an extremely pale/hazy yellow with usually a nice big fluffy head.Smell is tart with a spicey background,the taste is alot like the aroma but a little more spiciness comes thru along with a tart citruis flavor.Incredibly easy to drink,still a classic."
"Originally sampled on 28 June 2002. This is the definition of a white beer. Nice aroma, beautiful aroma, great flavor. The cripsness that wheat adds to a beer along w/ the spices, makes Hoegaarden the perfect beer on a hot summer day. I realzie that this style may not be for everyone, but I'll take one anytime."
"First, I've don't believe I've ever seen a paler color of beer before. Second, this is an exquisitely delicate beer flavorfest. The pour created a very, very pale and cloudy yellow body - lighter than lemonade, I do believe. The great white head was gorgeous, but it was gone almost instantly leaving a small residue for spotty, light lacing. The nose is clovish and citrusy, very delicate and clean. The taste does not disappoint, following through with a very clean clove taste and great mouthfeel - again, very clean and very delicate. This is one of the best wheats I've ever had and as it is far from my favorite style, it is nice to discover one that I consider drinkable and enjoyable. Cheers Hoegaarden!"
"Pours a pale yellow; a large white head sat at the top of the glass. Unfortunately, the head faded fast and left no lace. The aroma is of fresh cut grass, lemon, and wheat. The taste matches the aroma but in reverse. Easy to drink and this beer doesnt fill you up fast. I was a bit bummed out by this beer. I was expecting more flavors to this beer than I had. It was good, not great. Pretty average,"
"Pours a very cloudy yellow, huge white head that sticks around and sticks to the glass on the way down. Aroma is a little malty (bread), some citrus (lemon), and spicy (mainly coriander). Flavor is a refreshing mix of citrus and spices. Body is medium, ends acidic and slightly dry. Perfect beer for the summer."
"I've had this before in the bottle. Had this on-tap at Orleans in Davis Square. They served it with a lemon wedge, which I was a bit pissed about. On tap the taste and aroma seem much stronger. There is a much clearer lemon-citrus taste, unless it was tainted by the lemon wedge. All in all much better on tap."
"Pours a cloudy, pale yellow with a small white head that fades fairly quickly. Aromas of coriander, orange, citrus, and faint pepper. The nose follows through to the tastes of orange, coriander, wheat with a light sweetness that pairs with the slight peppery spice. Finishes slightly dry with a mild bitterness. Great Hefeweizen. My fiancee's favorite and everyday beer. Even better on draft."
"What a beautiful beer!"
"I never really understood wheat beer till I tried this one. Hoegaarden does it so subtly and so well. Light, cloudy, and yellow in color with a tall pure white head. The grainy tastes begs for you to add the fruit but it's better without it. A solid beer, and the first bottled wheat I'd buy again (yeah, I realize I ought to try a few more)."
"First off, I have to say that I'm rating a bottle and not a draught Hoegaarden. They're almost like two different animals. The draught is far superior and I don't understand why. At any rate, the beer pours nicely and looks beautiful in the glass. The problem is that it doesn't live up to it's reputation in my opinion. The flavors that come out in the draught are hardly present. It tastes to me like a pale wheat beer. The draught is far superior for sure."
"Bought and drank this one in Cannes, France. Cloudy, white, straw-golden brew forms a large whipped white head atop small bubbles with excellent retention and lacing. Carbonation is moderate, despite the huge head. Aroma is immediately yeasty with clove and very faint banana notes. I don't notice the orange peel or spices. Mouthfeel is soft with a light body. Taste begins with spicy phenols, a light rubbery note, crisp wheat malt with very little bitterness and no discernable hop flavor or aroma. Orange is just barely perceptable in the flavor. Alcohol is not discernable. Finish is lightly astringent just on the back of the tongue. A good, delicate, light, easy to drink beer, but not overly distinct or exciting."
"It looks a bit like a cloudy glass of yellow lemonade. The smell is on the light side but slightly peppery. The taste is not unpleasant but nothing really distinguishes as being much above average. It is very drinkable and would make a good all day beer."
"At first glance you wonder if the waitress accidentally brought a tulip-shaped glass of milky dishwater to your table. Then, oh yeah! This is the White Ale I ordered. It just looks the way it's supposed to!The cloudy pale, off white, tinted yellow color reveals a light body. Clove and hop aroma with a trace of alcohol. High in complex bitter hops with citrus undertones. Extra Dry. Fine Carbonation with a fizzy head and fine lace. Very sharp and spicy."
"Pours a perfectly white, thick, light head which settles to a thin layer. very cloudy. Pale in color, like white corn. Smells of spices and lemon and wheat. Tastes light and very well-rounded. smooth. so refreshing and clean, I would drink it all night in the summer if my budget would allow for it."
"Cloudy, straw color with a thick white head. The aroma is fruity; orange peel and coriander aromas. The flavor is fruity with orange peel flavors that flow to a smooth, subtle dryness. It is a light-bodied beer that is smooth, refreshing and easy drinking. The best wit I have yet sampled."
"I always wonder about having Belgian Wits on tap. I thought it was important to swirl the rest of the yeast and pour it in the bottle. Still, it was rather good. Pale cloudy yellow in color with a dense creamy white head. Strong lemony aroma, which is probably mostly due to the lemon they served it with. I would have turned down the lemon, but it seemed to compliment the beer well. Taste is citrusy and coriander. The perfect beer after cutting the grass on a hot summer day,"
"Taste: Classic White Beer flavor. I still like this one better than Allagash altough I may be alone on this one. One tap it, overseas especially, its even better, but this one is all citrus, clove, and coreander. Nice zing. Don't let them give you any lemon though, this has all the citrus I need Brewed Into the Beer. Great on a summer day, or, as a treat tonight, to ring in spring!"
"On tap baby, oh yeah..... poured out into the glass very hazy yellow, lots of mixing of whites and yellows, like watching watery latex paint mix. A huge creamy, thick, foamy head grew over and beyond and was quite a thrill to see. Smells right away of the orange and lemon, extremely citrusy. Nothing out of the ordinary for this Belgian beauty, but good non the less. Tastes of a citrus brew, very citrusy with orange and lemon strongly presented and felt, with a hint of spice, coriander I believe. Quite the drinker this was, I drank it to fast and gave me a buzz."
"And it's easy to drink. It's very light and simple, nothing too brain-bending about this one. I've made this a summertime session beer before, and I'll probably do it again."
"This beer Pours a cloudy, fizzy, pale yellow with a thin white head. A nose of lemon, bananas and slightly peppery. The lemon comes through in the taste also a pear taste is present. Quite a citrus taste. A light body good for a cool down in the summer beer."
"This is an excellent wheat brew. It pours bright cloudy yellow with very little head. Served with a lemon. The beer in itself was quite citrussy. It had a fruity flavor that did not overpower the wheat malts. Cirtrussy in the mouth but very drinkable. Very good."
"This wheat ale poured a very cloudy yellow color with modest white foam. The smell was lightly fruity (bananas). The taste was fruity (bananas), with the flavors of wheat, pears, apples, musty grapes, and some citrus-like tartness. The mouthfeel was smooth and clean with low carbonation and light to medium body. The drinkability was good. This was a light and refreshing ale, probably better suited to warmer weather."
"Not my favorite style, but good nonetheless."
"Very fresh smell of exotic fruits and spice, and of course wheat. The taste is also fresh but a with bit of watery mouthfeel. This beer is however very drinkable it's not bitter and only a little sweetness is present, I think this is a beer everyone can enjoy. :)"
"Ahh, HoegaardenMy favorite white ale. This was the first beer that I sample when I was converting to the world of better beer. Pours a cloudy, pale yellow with small yeast particles dancing around in the heavy carbonation. A thick, fluffy white head presents itself upon pouring and slowly dies down leaving a beautiful lace on the glass. Aromas of lemon and coriander are very prominent. The flavors of yeast, citrus and spicy coriander engulf the taste buds all at once. Leaving you mouth begging for more. A clean and refreshing taste is left on the palate. This is an exceptionally smooth and easy drinking beer. This brew from Hoegaarden sets the standard for all other wits."
"Cloudy pale yellow in color, with a thin, surprisingly persistant, pristine white head. The aroma is an invigorating wheaty, lemony scent. Taste is zesty, with a tart start, yielding to a somewhat spicy (corriander?) mid-palate, a finish of moderate floral hops, and a gently sweet aftertaste. Finish is slightly dry, body is medium-light, and the flavors are very well balanced and blend into each other oh-so-smoothly. Very refreshing and drinkable."
"""Wow"" with the color... Very nice and thinkly wheat- / yeast- cloudy. But I tell you, without the (required for style) cloudiness, this beer would look quite funny -- pale, pale, pale. Nice head atop and I was careful not to let any lemon touch the inside (if I use lemon at all, it is in the summer, and only after I have tasted many offerings). Taste was super, as was its mouthfeel and drinkability. Nice subtly spicy, sweet flavor. Decided to sample this one even though the bar was a chilly temp. Will be saving this stuff for the summer."
"Simple tasting and delicious. Well balanced flavors. Always hits the spot. Whenever I'm out I always manage to order one of these if available."
"Pours with the look of a sparkling champagne except with a white fizzy head that stays a just a tad longer. The color is a very pale hazed yellow-stained water. Light aromas of a light sweet fruit and a hint of yeast bellow out of the soda-like head. The light yet sophisticated flavors of light yeast and fruit and a slight note of a lemon twang make up a nice refreshing beer. The mouthfeel is light to medium and finishes nonchalantly sticky. Very well done! Op uw gezonheid!"
"Hazy, pale yellow. Nice head retention. No lacing to speak of. Yeasty, lemon aromas. Effervescent. A very pleasant, refreshing summer beer. Not big in taste or structure. This is a simple beer that has withstood the test of time. An easy drinking classic."
"Came in the new bottles that have just been released by Hoegaarden. A staple for any true belgium beer drinkers, it pours a classic pale hazy unfiltered yellow with a superb white head carrying all of the yeasty goodness this beer has to offer. The aroma is clove and banana laced, with other spices and coriander what a treat. More refreshing than a lemonade, in my opinion. A lighter bodied beer that has citrusy tone to it and then mellows out to form a great yeasty finish. Full of so many flavors with out over doing it, this is an amazing beer that I will never grow tired of. Yes it is drinkable on every level for quantity and enjoyment."
"Cloudy, light lemon-yellow beer with a tight, white, long lasting head. Wheat spiciness and coriander in the aroma. The taste is light and crisp, with lemon and coriander present supported by a touch of malt sweetness. The good mouthfeel helps support the light flavor. Excellent drinakbility, and one that is high on my list for summer. There's a good reason this is a classic."
"This blanche beer has cloudy pale yellow color with a weak white head that produces decent lace. The aroma is of citrus and is rather strong. The taste is similar with a lemon flavor standing out among the citrus. The mouth feel is crisp and light, very easy to drink. This has been a favorite of mine for 3-4 years now and will remain as so for some time."
"An excellent Belgian white."
"This is a great wit beer one of my favorites. Head it good if poored firmly out of bottle and does disipate quickly. Good clean lemon smell. The color is pale yellow and cloudy. I always swirl the yeast into the glass cause it gives it more depth and flavor. Has a little dry citrus flavor and some floral sweetness. This beer is one you can have alot of and is my go to beer when I'm having many. As refreshing as it is in summer with a lemon, I drink it year round sans lemon sometimes with lemon other."
"Pours a cloudy light yellow with a quickly dissipating head. After a few sips, I swirled around the remaining yeast in the bottle, and poured it into the glass. Aroma is very light consisting mainly of coriander and wheat. Has the typical flavors of a wit... cloves, coriander, yeast, and a touch of lemon. Has a light body and a prickly mouthfeel. This is a very drinkable beer, and is a good wit, but doesn't really have any outstanding qualities."
"D - Very refreshing but not at all complex on the palate as it is on the aroma."
"Pours with a thin ultra white head that sits over cloudy white/pale yellow liquid. The nose is mellow spices and yeast fruitiness...light and spritzy. Taste is a refreshing mix of of semi-sweet malt, coriander, lemon tanginess, clove and some fruit, all blending together wonderfully. Finishes light, drying out a tad. Invitingly drinkable, for such a light bodied ale this packs a fair amount of flavors into it...a classic!"
"the beer is an absolute wonder. a good body with tingling carbonation and perfect smoothness make it exceptional in your mouth. flavors are of yeast and bread. you get fruitiness all the way through after the bubbles tickle your tongue, and the beer tickles your spince with pure greatness. there is a little spiciness in it. this is a balls out top shelf White."
"This is by far the best Belgian white I've ever had. Don't get too excited though, I haven't had too many of them. Has a good wheaty taste to it, big suprise. It's very distinctive in it's taste. Goes down nice and smooth and very nice after taste. I think the color is pretty cool, it's unusual. Goes down nice and smooth with no heavy after taste lingering around like a bad uncle. But, that's another story!"
"Appearance category needs to be redefined when dealing with a brew such as this....lemonade with a head and very nice island lace..how odd....My first impression of this beer was rather sad but the taste blew me away...Lemon/honey with a lingering sweetness. Normally I would score drinkability low due to the sweetness but somehow the malts take over....This is a great summer brew..."
" Ok beer not the best its better in bottle!"
"This cloudy white/yellowish brew appears just as the beers itself tastes.  A fruity & floral nose, Hoegaarden goes down extra smooth and is especially refreshing with its fruity-citrus hints and perfect acidity.  On a hot day when 1 beer just won't do, Hoegaarden Wit will quench your thirst and leave you with rrom for more."
"Hoegaarden is so named after the town in which it is from.  The color is almost a glowing white with a hint of yellow.  Very easy drinking and works great as a summer time beer.  I hear a lot of people taking about this beer changing over the past year.  I haven't been drinking it long enough to notice a change so I can't speak either way on that subject.  Still a great fall back in my book."
"Pours a dull, cloudy straw color with a nice creamy head.  The aroma is mild citrus with hints of pepper.  The taste is a very refreshing, slightly sweet and sour mild lemon flavor.  Its very smooth in the mouth and goes down very easily.  The only real criticism I have is that it is almost too light-bodied.  From reading some of the other reviews, it seems that if you have this is Belgium, thats not the case; but alas, Im limited to what I can find here in Texas."
"Prosit."
"This was the first 'real beer' I tried.  It remains one of my favorites to the date.  The mouthfeel is marvelous, giving the drinker yet another quality to enjoy in addition to its taste.  Its taste is a raw collection of mellow tastes of lemons and pepper.  It is as the bottle proclaims a ""perfect balance between sweet and sour"".  If you decide to try a Wit Beer, try this one then try the others; it is the standard."
"This beer feels so good in the mouth, so smooth, you could salt away 4 or 5 with little effort. We rarely have a tasting where we will drink 2 of the same thing, but I swear if I'd had a 2nd bottle of this, we would have done just that. She made a statement about Genessee Cream Ale, but it's been ages since I had that beer. Genessee may compare in mouthfeel and overall zero likelihood of having any offensive components, but I don't think it could reach Hoegaarden's taste at all. As Marty Brennaman says when a baseball player swings at a pitch waaaay out of the strike zone, 'He couldn't havef hit that with an ironing board'. That's Genessee's chance of out-flavoring this ale. If you haven't had one, have one. If you've had one, have two. :-)"
"But dare I say that I prefer many of the more substancial, modern interpretations?  Call me a heretic."
"Pours a cloudy, pale yellowish color. Thick and foamy pure white head that holds well and leaves some lace. Lemon aroma with some spice. Light body a nice smooth mouthfeel from the carbonation. Flavor is sweet with a  pepper flavor that goes well with the light hop, sour-lemon flavor. Well balanced. Finishes a little dry and crisp. Refreshing and enjoyable."
"Cloudy, yellowish in color with a thick and foamy, bright white head that holds well and leaves some nice lace. Very nice, and somewhat unique, in appearance. The aroma is quite lemony with some gentle spice in the background. The body is light with a zesty carbonation that gives a pillowy soft mouthfeel. The flavor is sweetly malty and gently clovey. Very well balanced. It finishes gently, semi-dry, with a lightly mouth-coating malt and spice that leaves a tingle on the tongue. An exceptional, somewhat delicate, beer with alot of character that's refreshing and enjoyable."
"Very good. Comparable to a Hefeweizen, as wits are. Cloudy appearance, looks like liquid golden yellow cotton candy. A thick head of creamy texture is prevalent unless poured badly. A spicy and fruity blend of aromas makes up the texture of the smell. Orange and apples are the two scents that come to mind. Light, but not at all gassy. Great tasting! Citrus and spice. A very refreshing and quenching ale. Full but not filling."
"This is one of my top favorite brews. The beer pours cloudy and straw colored. Immediately, banana and lemon can be smelled coming off of the perfectly white head.  When sipped, the carbonation and sourness come first, then spiciness, and finally wheat. The hops come in with the coriander towards the end. The beer is modestly carbonated, and the bubbles are small and prickley. This is one great beer."
"Very pale, hazy/cloudy and little to no head. Fruity/citrusy aromas dominate the nose. Taste is sweet with some slightly tart overtones, with the classic orange/lemon peel citrusness (and acidity) and coriander spiciness. As all BAs know, beer drinking is its own reward, but this beer is extra rewarding. Simply outstanding."
"Yellow-white color, appropriately cloudy.  Medium head (bright white in color) that quickly fades.  Citrus, fruity smell.  Very mild, but refreshing taste.  Somewhat of a peppery, spicy finsih.  Faint yeast taste.  This is a well made, refreshing Wit."
"Pours a hazy golden white color with a pillowy white head that sinks a bit too quickly and doesn't leave much of a lace.  Huge orangey fruity aroma with some decent peppery spiciness in there as well.  Smooth yeast flavors as well as some fruitiness that floats in the background.  The spiciness is very vague and subtle and I wouldn't mind it being a little stronger.  Slightly thin but still very creamy this is still a very drinkable brew.  Definitely a good beer but IMHO it can't hold a candle to Allagash White."
"Hazy golden yellow color, fizzy white tan head, with inviting yeast lumps that linger to the bottom. Very smooth typical belgian yeast smell with subtle citrus undertones. Slight sweetness, very balanced. Rich yeasty flavors bounce around on your tongue, very good light citrus taste, make a crisp clean finish. Medium bodied, well balanced, and perfectly carbonated, a treat on tap. Easy to drink, and a real winning wit."
"Good wheat haze, slight taste of lemon on the finish. Taste not over powering, but, pleasant. Compare to other Belgium ale's, I find this beer a little above average."
"This is the Wit. Others may try to copy it, but I've yet to have a wit that is this good. The color of this beer is amazing - almost dayglow yellow with a tinge of green thrown in. Lots of fruity flavors with lemon dominating the pack. You don't really notice the spice flavors that much - a good thing. Mega carbonation makes this spritzy and refreshing. This beer has a calming effect on me and seems to put me in a great mood. Now if I could just get a few more million people to drink this maybe the prices will come down and I could have some everyday."
"Hazy pale gold with a pleasing aroma. Sweet flavors start off and finish with a slightly sour bitterness.  Classic belgian yeast taste.  A good beer, but not my favorite Wit."
"Not bad.  This is probably the one I would suggest for someone looking to get started in sampling Belgian biers.  It is a murky brew with a lacey head.  The aroma gives off a bit of citrus and spice, but not nearly as much as most other Belgians.  The drinkability is a high factor here.  Without the superior Belgian alcohol kick, one could have more of this bier and get away with it.  It took me more than one of these to get a good feel for it.  I concur with a previous reviewer, ""A good summer bier."""
"Hoegaarden:  in the bottle (bottle conditioned).  Pure white head, with a cloudy pale yellow body.  The head dissipated very quickly, but the beer itself was highly carbonated.  Very light and refreshing, with a classic Belgian/yeast taste, but with hints of lemon grass.  I’ve had this on tap, and it was terrific; it was good in a bottle, but on tap it was great."
"This beer poured a light straw color and was slightly cloudy with some carbonation.  It formed a white head which subsided and left very little lace.  It had a nice citrus aroma to it.  The taste had citrus and some hops, and the carbonation created a slightly tangy finish.  A good summer beer."
"Very pale with a slight yellow haze and tint.  The brew is soft in the mouth with melow flavors of citrus and slight fruit.  The smooth coating finish leaves you with a fluffy feel.  And the finish has a slight spicyness in the throat.  A excellent session beer and awesome with food.  I could drink them all night.   Very drinkable..."
"What an enjoyable beer.  Pours out to a very pale, hazy gold in the glass with a cloudlike, puffy, foamy head.  Taste is that of wheat, yeast, citrus and very light clove.  What a tasty beer!!!"
"Yeah this stuff is excellent. On tap in the big Hoegaarden glass...oh yeah. Cloudy yellow, almost white, head sticks to glass all the way down. Delicious spicy yeast flavor. Mmm."
"Cloudy straw hue and topped by a thick, ivory white sticky head.  Soft coriander and light citrus in aroma w/ a touch of phenol and yeasty mustiness.  Slightly tart upfront, but a mellow and pleasant sweetness follows.  Citrus and coriander spice flavors are understated and well integrated in the flavor profile.  Soft all around on the palette w/ a very smooth mouthfeel.  Finishes clean and sweet with mellow coriander flavor lingering on the tongue.  Has Hoegaarden White been changed ever since Interbrew took over? Maybe, but this is still a fine and well balanced wit."
"After the rat bastards at Miller sank Celis, I tried to seek out a replacement for their Wit.  Well, it took me far too long to get around to it, but I finally bucked up and grabbed a bottle of Hoegaarden (Pierre Celis is the former brewer).  Golden in color, sticky glorious head, the aroma immediately tells you that this is something special.  The coriander and orange peel hit you followed by the mellow sweetness of the wheat.  Its mouthfeel is smooth and velvety with a little zip on the end.  The blending of the spices with the highest quality wheat make for an over-the-top experience.  To me, this is really the benchmark for other Belgian whites.  It's probably to rich to have too many at one sitting, so probably not the greatest session beer ever."
"Excellent white beer. Cloudy appearance with nice head, citrus aftertaste. Light and refreshing definitely a beer to keep stock in your refrigerator."
"Hoegaarden is one of the best Wits i have ever tasted.  It is so smooth tasting with out a bitter after taste.  I found no matter how many you drink you will never get a hangover.  We all should plan a trip to this brewery to find the secret of Wit. Happy drinking"
"Deeply clouded, ""frosted banana"" color.  Small-bubbled head that's pretty persistent.  Lots of estery banana and nutmeg aroma.  Good balance between satisfying sweet malt that tends toward creamy and a touch of pepper and a slight hop cut.  The label says ""a balance of sweet and sour"" but I noticed a thankfully minimal amount of lemony sourness (this issue always crops up with me and Belgian styles).  Light, refreshing and setting a standard for the style.  Wits are always a little lacking and thin to me but this is a great example."
"Very Refreshing, citrus taste is very prominent, but not overbearing, Champagne like, it's more of a beer to have with a meal than a session beer. And at $8.50 a bottle for it down here thats probably good it is not a session beer. Probably the best Wheat beer i've had to date."
"Spicy with hints of Citrus. The foggy appearence is classic."
"A bottle of this with my lunch (at Nodding Head Brew Pub) was pretty much my introduction to the Belgian White. This brew pours a cloudy pale gold, with an average sized white fluffy head that doesnt stay around long before it becomes a thin strip of bubbles floating on top of the brew. Thin to medium body. The heavy earthy nose is mostly of malt and suggests cereal and caramel, with hints of flowers, and citrus. The flavor though not overwhelming is very balanced with moderate levels of sweetness and acidity with a hint of bitterness. The finish is quick and clean. Overall a very refreshing and interesting brew that I enjoyed very much! Good stuff but I don't think a could drink more then two in a row though..."
"Despite an interesting color and ok head, I was initially disapointed with the taste. For the past couple of months, most of my beer have been stouts, porters, brown ales and darker Belgians. Compare to those heavy bodied beers, this came across as kid of tasteless. It took me a good quarter of the pint to get to the point where I could appreciate the subtleties. Not as much coriander and orange in this as some of the others I've had and the body was still a little light for me, but not bad. Definite warm weather beer."
"Nice frothy white head.  Cloudy white appearance as the name suggests.  I get wheat on the nose, but surprisingly, no spice.  Nice easy drinking wheat based bevarage.  This would be a great summertime beer.  I was hoping for a little more orange/coriander/spice in the taste, but it tastes very good as is.  There's that nice zesty, tangy character that goes great with pools and sunshine."
"This is a luscious refreshing white, good for a sunny Sunday brunch. Nothing extraordinary but decent, indicative of the style. Doesn't get superb marks from me because I inherently distrust Interbrew. Their beers suffer from the enormity of the company, and their costs are prohibitive. I once paid $9 ($10 with tip) for one of these in an annoying Manhattan bar/lounge, so I decided to keep the glass."
"very good white  beer, i'm sure it had more complexity once upon a time, but it continues to be very good, it has never let me down."
"Great citrisy flavor form the hops and orange peel. Nice head and wonderful wheaty flavor. I only put 2 other whites ahead of this one but Hoegaarden definately has the best value."
"Notes: The original White Ale, and grandfather to many a Summer-style white ale. Seems to have less character lately, though if you have it over in Belgium it is better."
"Anyone who's had only American interpretations of Belgian Wit(white) beer before needs to try this. A real treat with a unique texture. Very flavorful."
"OK.  Went well with Chinese food"
"There are a couple I like a little better, but this is certainly a classic example of the style.  Very smooth and tasty."
