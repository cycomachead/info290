Some lacing is seen. Average carbonation but not overly done. The aroma is of mostly grains, wheat and coriander.

The nose and palate complexity was nice, easily drinkable, 4.4% you could session this one easily. The most surprising part about the whole deal was that the misses asked if I could get a six pack the next time I was out. She generally hates beer, and especially the porters and stouts that I like, but she enjoyed this. Kudos to Boulevard. I would highly recommend it, and I would drink and buy it again.","TheCondor","Jun 09, 2012"

The nose comprises wheat, coriander, black pepper, salt, Belgian yeast, lemon zest, white bread, and a small current of sweet caramel waaayyy in the back. The taste doesn't change too much up, though the lemon comes through stronger and the salt is amped heavily. I wouldn't necessarily call the result "salty", but it's far from "not at all salty".

The beers appearance lacks the uniform, creamy haze and soft head formation / retention expected. The yeasty spices are strong, phenolic, estery notes dominate the nose and flavors and not allowing the soft malts, breadiness, or hops to balance. The grain character rises and also keeps the soft, powdery, confection notes from shinning like they should. Lightly astringent from the lemon notes and graininess hurts the beer from the taste, on through the textures and finish. the carbonation is high with a bite and tingle, but not with the expected softness.

The corriander and orange peel are just right, there is a slight hop bitterness but no apparent hop flavor. The mouthfeel is light in body and the carbonation has a creaminess about it.

Pours a one finger pure white frothy head over a dirty light lemon colored liquid. Smells funky, bready, yeasty, oranges, and coriander. It smells pretty good, which is quite a compliment as I dislike funky belgian styles (this was sold to me as a 'summer wheat'...oops). Tastes...yup, funky. Not so bad as most--perhaps my tolerance for the style is improving. Here's what I get; candy sweetness, vanilla (actually quite strong and persistent), pears, mild oranges. The flavors seem muted and watery somehow, such that nothing really knocks me over here. There is a late spicey zing, but I wouldn't quite call it coriander. A bit of acrid carbonation sting arises upon swallowing to mix with the spice. Then some aromatic 'funk' qualities that I find dispicable rise up the throat. Md-light bodied and mildly carbonated. Well, they've got the style down pretty well, just a bit watery, perhaps. But I've had enough. I still don't like funky belgian styles, so down the drain with the last of it. I will score this according to style, of course, not my personal tastes.","mentor","0"

I even pick up some bubblegum towards the end of the glass. The flavor is more subdued with a very limited malt and a light, dry fruitiness. There's some coriander at mid swallow, and the finish is dry with a light touch of acidity. The light bodied but zesty palate helps to pull this off. A-just-above-average beer with a good label and name that has no flaws but leaves me almost wishing it had some to give it a little bit of complexity.

Fairly light in body for a wheat, and unfortunately fairly light in flavor as well.  The taste doesn't continue where the aroma left off.  Upfront wheat tartness is followed by very mild phenol and green apple flavors.  Finishes dry and unexciting. That being said, the drinkability is quite good.
