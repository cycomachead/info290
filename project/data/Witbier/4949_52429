Taste is light, really lighter than I hoped or expected.  Dominant flavors follow the aroma, a straw-like grassiness is the most obvious followed by a clean peppery spice.  Not a big flavor profile at all.  Carbonation was lacking and mouthfeel was dry but odd.  Overall the fancy bottle and big name chef on the label caused a letdown.  Doubt I would purchase again.","slackattack","Sep 17, 2014"

Hazy, lemonade-like yellow color, like a witbier. Big, puffy, white head -- velvety and natural. Unusual, bright, slightly citrus-peely (but not sour) nose. Also some sweetish, vanilla tones, and just a hint of toasting. A tad of white pepper like dryness. Light, fizzy mouth feel - quite champagne-like. Not much flavor. Rather offish, actually, with dull cardboardy notes. I cannot detect any of the advertised spices. Label does not indicate % alcohol, but I'd guess around 4-5%. Great nose, good body, poor flavor.

Even and nowhere near overpowering citrus is there as well. Carbonation feels a bit unusual. It's almost like champagne in a way? Definitely not typical, but it's not outlandish. Liquid is slick and smooth. This is an exquisite beer. Portrays many characteristics you normally see in other beers but delivers it in a more refined way with layers of character.","RblWthACoz","0"
