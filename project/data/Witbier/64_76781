3.75,-1.8,,,,,,"Pours a very pale yellow, almost throughs a tinge of chartreuse into things. Actually, coincidentally enough (ok, it’s just my willful belief) it’s almost hte same colour as the album cover (in the year 3030...). Finger and a half of white driven snow fades soon enough. You really get the cider on the nose. It’s sweet and crisp up front. Round pears and a bit of Belgian yeast. Minor light spices, not picking up much depth behind that. The cider takes front court again, spicy Belgian yeast brings pear to the party, and the Belgian spice segues nicely into the light cayenne heat at the end. The finish is surprisingly earthy and bitter; a characteristic that was not necessarily present earlier in the profile. Dunno if the cilantro and farro could be contributing to the earthiness, or if I’m just making hte connection because I was looking for them since I’d read the description, but at the very least it’s not completely without the realm of believability.","kemoarps","Aug 23, 2014"

The nose is both crisp and sweet, the apples come through as well as cinnamon spice, there is a leafy spiciness but not sure I’d peg it as cilantro, some orange zest and peach to apricot fruit too, yeast and pie dough, no hops of note, has very good staying power which is pleasing in place of the missing complexity. Full-bodied, super creamy and coats the entire mouth. The carbonation is all fluffiness, no cleansing aspect. The apples supported by banana, peach, pear and that same cinnamon, nutmeg spice. The cayenne comes through as an afterthought, muted. Even the flavors are sweet the texture gets dry by the finish so any yeastiness becomes truncated. More enjoyable colder, not that it gets flabby as it warms but the components start to blur. No problem throwing it back but leaves you with little desire for a second or third glass.","farrago","Aug 31, 2013"

Head retention is excellent, and there's a good amount of lacing. Aroma is fruity and spicy, the brew smells like apples (sweet and tart), peppery spice, bananas, straw, grainy malt, pears, and cilantro. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also grape, cloves and some very light cayenne noticeable. The aroma and taste reminds me more of a Tripel because of the fruit and yeast. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and is well carbonated. The soft carbonation helps make this brew easy to drink. Also, the 9% ABV is well hidden.

The nose comprises honey, cranberry, white grape, chili pepper, and apples. There's a fairly random mixture for ya, eh? At least it's good... The taste brings in more of the same, though with more white grape, the pepper has taken on more of a curry/cumin character, and some flowers enter the picture for the sake of it. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda gel-like feel.

I pick up citric notes and yeast as well as some peppery spice, but also get some type of apple like sweetness which I guess is the cider and there is a slight sweet malt aroma as well. This kind of reminded me less of a wit and more of a Belgian Pale only because the citric twang and spicey zip I associate with those brews is not as pronounced as one would normally find in a wit. They are in there, but there's also some plush juicy and tropical fruit notes and some sugary malt sweetness as well. Beer is light-to-medium bodied, creamy at times and sharp at others thanks to carbonation and the ABV is well-hidden.","clayrock81","May 20, 2013"

But I was taken aghast. This beer actually was quite delicious. The witbier category is well represented. A mix of the wheat and bitter of the spices and even the cider is added with a slight bitterness works well. It's well-balanced. The body is quite nicely put together. I would totally have this beer again and would recommend it to a friend. Cheers!","DMXLOX22","May 08, 2013"

4.06,6.3,4,4.25,4,4,4,"Beautiful golden ale brought forth from a cider base of pressed Fuji apples, cilantro, cayenne, and roasted faro. Hazed just slightly glowing golden body with a bright white head, forms fine lacing around the sides of my glass. Aroma has tart apples freshly sliced in the forefront with hints of herbal spice with a peppery cayenne kick in the nares....really complex well brewed offering from one of my favorite brewers and rappers Dan the Automator aka Deltron 3030 aka Del the Funky Homosapien. No overt sweetness on the palate just tasty sliced apples, spicy cayenne and cilantro interplay, a nice mix of flavors bready yeast biscuit malt and cracker dough added to the spectrum. Nares are lightly kissed with the spice additions of the cayenne and cilantro, a really well done carbonation level effervescent fine ale carries the beer just right across my palate. It works really well for me, the type of beer I can drink by myself, with friends, or with food it's a triple threat great tasting complex and drinkable you can't hate on that. Toward the end I paired it with a spicy Nicaraguan cigar Ortega Wild Bunch series #4 Tony the Boss Churchill great spicy smoke leather in the tobacco pairs well with the spice and light apple sweetness, I'm diggin' the combo it works together so nicely.","WVbeergeek","May 07, 2013"

Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright yellow-gold coloring and a fluffy, white, tall, bright head that leaves a cling all over the glass as it slowly recedes. Settles in a solid half an inch. Aromas of all spice, cinnamon, subtle apple sweetness, and a touch of cloves. Flavors are smooth and light, with a cider sweet backbone and subtle pepper spicing. Very light and very well balanced. The all spice and clove become highlighting accents instead of main characteristics. Very light, crisp, clean body. The finish is slightly sweet, with a hint of spice. Great balance to a very unique brew. Tasty, light, and hugely refreshing.","GarthDanielson","Apr 24, 2013"

The smell is quite typical of a good/great Belgian golden ale with the peppery spiciness which is backed by lemon and clean wheat bready character. The additions of cider, cilantro and cayenne may be just noticeable in the smell but they are subtle. The taste too is all Belgian ale with some additions. First you are hit by lemon and pepper. This is followed by great pale malt, biscuit and warming alcohol characteristics. The cider adds to the complexity of the fruity esters of the yeast and maybe it is just because I've read the label and I'm looking for it but it does seem as though the pepper and cilantro are also evident but only just and again to add an additional layer of complexity to a beer that is already quite impressive. The carbonation is relatively high and the peppery tingle makes this beer quite lively in the mouth. Overall this is a great twist on a great style using some interesting ingredients proving again that the guys and DFH have redefined what brewing and beer can be.","fank2788","Oct 26, 2012"

4.05,6,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours an almost-clear golden color with a medium white head. Some floaties floating around in there as well. Scent is verry apple-forward. Some lovely fuji apple aromas with Belgian yeast and pears...a little white grape as well. I'm detecting a lot of spices, but not necessarily cayenne in the nose. Not really getting any cilantro either. It does smell inviting though. Taste is quite complex, much better than I was expecting. Initially, I get a pleasant herbal flavor, immediately followed by floral Belgian notes. Yeasty belgian deliciousness with a TON off Fuji apples and a hint of cinnamon. The cayenne peppers make their appearance mid-palate, but VERY subtle. There is a hint of booziness, but nothing you would expect from a 9% "witbier". Unfortunately, still not detecting any cilantro. Some more light fruit flavors...pears, green apples, white grapes. Sweet Belgian-yeast finish. Mouthfeel is crisp and somewhat refreshing. Drinkability is high. Overall, I am VERY shocked by this beer. I went into this thinking it was simply a gimmick and would not taste good. I only bought it because I am a fan of Deltron 3030. Glad I bought it...very tasty.","DovaliHops","Oct 02, 2012"
4.32,13.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 2012. Pours lightly cloudy golden amber color with a nice 2-3 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Good soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big grape, apple, pear, pepper, clove, banana, bubblegum, cilantro, herbal, light cayenne, and yeast spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity, balance, and strength. Taste of apple, grape, pear, cilantro, clove, banana, pepper, herbal, earth, grass, bubblegum, wheat, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of light fruit, banana, pepper, clove, herbal, earth, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor balance and complexity; with nice complimenting flavors from the herbs and spices. Nothing is overbearing. No cloying flavors at all after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with almost no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic imperial witbier! Fantastic complexity and balance; and very smooth to sip on. This was very impressive.","superspak","Oct 02, 2012"

It's not nearly as crazy as you might expect from reading the label, there's only a touch of Dogfish weirdness here.","shand","Jul 26, 2012"

Aroma of wheat, coriander, sweet malt and Belgian yeast, smells nice. Flavor is delicious, integrated malt, wheat, sweet cider. Finishes slightly hot (cayenne?) and lightly hopped. Spicing is present but not assertive. Perfectly balanced and tasty. Nice medium to heavy creamy body. I liked this more as the second glass slowly warmed. the only negative is that the alcohol in this 9% beer is well hidden, it's way too quaffable.

The cider is pretty dry and harder to pick up to me with slight appleskin tannin which leads to the mild cayenne flavor with subtle heat on the palate. Overall a good beer, and interesting concept. I would have liked this better without the cider perhaps, it seems a little muted, but worth a try for sure as it stands apart as an original wheat.","Slatetank","Jul 16, 2012"

I am really saying it because this beer is very well done. The yeast is not obnoxiously strong, the beer is not too overdone in any one area of Apple, Cilantro, or Cayenne, and these flavors are all distinctly different which makes this beer very good in my book.
