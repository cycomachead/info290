The aroma has that straw and wheat sweetness with bold spices and subtle fruity yeast notes. The taste is of unfiltered wheat grains and spices (coriander/peppercorns). Faint metallic with a great nobel hop finish. Dry and semi-sweet with lingering peppercorns in the aftertaste.the body is light and refreshing. I can crush this all day long.

Prior to drinking this beer, Blanche de Chambly was my favourite in this style, but this completely blew it out of the water. At its price, its more of a luxury beer rather than an everyday drink, but as a change of pace treat, you can't do much better. An amazing beer that is complex, but at the same time incredibly drinkable. Highly recommended!","WeizenMike","Sep 03, 2014"

It took me a few sips to get the hang of what they were going for here, but in the end it's not hard to see why St. Bernardus Witbier is widely considered to be the best commonly-seen example of the style. This beer doesn't seek to overwhelm your senses with a variety of exotic adjuncts or spicy features - it's beautifully balanced, plain delicious and simply a pleasure to drink. A must-try, unless you just aren't a fan of the style to begin with.","thehyperduck","Aug 23, 2014"

4.41,6,4,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured from 330 ml bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. This brew is allegedly quite close to Pierre Celis' original Hoegaarden recipe and is widely regarded as a decent stab at what genuine witbier used to taste like before the style became industrialized and relatively insipid. This sort of snobbery aside, I do see what the critics mean. St. Bernardus wit is a milky banana yellow hue, super cloudy and infused with particulate material from yeast. Aroma is correspondingly yeasty, sweet, citrusy, and spicy with a touch of Belgian funk and a decent burst of clove phenolics. Few North American wits smell like this. Palate features Indian round coriander seed, lemony and slightly tannic but not overpowering, orange rind, sweet grainy malt that combines with the citrus to evoke lemon meringue pie, and a surprisingly rich earthy spice that prevents things from being too sweet. Dry and woody in fact, with sour apple notes and a touch of butterscotch in the finish. Nicely carbonated (which is to say highly so). Should this be deemed the witbier Platonic ideal? Quite possibly, although dare I say that I prefer the more aggressive Unibroue yeast in Blanche de Chambly? Its almost a dead heat between these two. In the St. Bernardus Trappist influenced take reviewed here, everything is truly in its right place and the overall effect is earthy, spicy, dry, and as well-calibrated as a Swiss watch. Precise and technically proficient but still a work of art in the Belgian beer sense.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 21, 2013"

Funny story… last night in the beer class, a guy likes the Maui Bikini Blonde Ale more than anything we tried. He would LOVE this beer! Oh well, glad I got to try this.

Aroma seems to be lacking a bit, and smells almost stale with hay and grass, some faint yeast. Good carbonation, with decent mouthfeel. Flavor follows rather dry, yeasty, and very little sweetness or spice on this one. I was expecting something mind blowing and felt that this was rather run of the mill.

My only complaint is that for the style, the St. Bernardus was on the darker side of the witbiers. I think I remember liking Hoegaarden better since it is lighter and has a refreshing lemon character. The St. Bernardus Wit is a great beer with outstanding flavors that I would certainly warrant picking up if I ever saw it at the beer store again!","ThomasMetal75","May 16, 2012"

Wheat and light belgian spice aroma. Citrus and light wheat flavors up front with a bit of sour and astringent bitterness quickly followed by the spices and light fruit.

Pours extremely hazy golden straw color with a nice 1 finger fairly dense white head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap. Some fairly nice lacing clinging on the glass. Aromas of pepper, lemon zest, orange, coriander, grass, bread, wheat, and yeast spices. Nice and well balanced aromas with decent strength. Taste of big pepper, coriander, lemon, orange, bread, lightly tart grain, and yeast spices. No bitterness; with lingering notes of citrus, bread, tart grain, and spices on the finish for a bit. Very nicely balanced flavors, without cloying sweetness. Fairly dry finish. Medium body and carbonation; with a fairly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel. Pretty much no alcohol presence as expected at 5.5%. Overall this is a super smooth, balanced, and very enjoyable witbier; as I would have hoped. Unfortunately it is a bit difficult to find unlike the rest of the lineup.","superspak","Jan 26, 2012"

Flavors of yeast, sugar, lemon, pear, banana, corriander, pepper, all wrapped in an incredibly smooth package that you just don't get from a typical wit.

Great nose - cloves, lemongrass, coriander and mandarin orange. Taste consistent with nose; however character in the nose is nicely muddled and muted so as to be crisp and refreshing as opposed to sweet and cloying. Mouthfeel is light-bodied, but feels more substantial due to the lively effervescence that leaves a semi-dry and clean aspect at the finish.

The smell is bready with citrus notes. The taste is tart up front with more citrus and spicy notes. Mouthfeel is dry, and not quite a chewey as an Allagash white. Overall, this is a great thirst quenching beer. The spicy notes are enjoyable as well. The biggest detraction is the body. I could use a bit more chewiness. Also, i enjoy a bit more floral notes, but this is still a fantastic beer. I compare it to Allagash white (my ideal beer in this style), but it would be hard to find another one in the style that is this good.","MSchae1017","Mar 22, 2008"

Smells of tangy fruits mixed with malts, cloves and a creamy sweetness. Tastes of bananas and apples with a slight tangy orange peel essence left on the palate.

It has a more subtle nose than other witbiers, with hints of apricot and orange scents. However, in this case the aroma does not explain the taste. Rather it has a full body and a strong yeasty citrus flavor with a smooth creamy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is perfect, with just the right amount of carbonation to prickle across your tongue. Although it has a low alcohol content it retains that nice alcohol flush at the end. My husband described this one as ""Blue Moon on steroids."" Although I thought this beer was delicious the creaminess was a little overwhelming and I'd probably only drink one in an evening.","jenbys2001","Jan 20, 2008"

ABT 12 is one of my favorite beers and often finds its way into my regular drinking schedule. However, when I realized St. B purveyed a witbier, my love of a good brewery and the most drinkable beer class I've come across were combined in a truly fulfilling brew. The head is soft and flat, the color is bright blond with a tinge of orange, and the feel is perfectly effervescent.

All the taste you would want in a wit but not overpowering in any way. Very flavorful. Some mild spicing shows up in the taste.

Pours a cloudy dull color..very dense with a huge carbonated white head (on a hard pour) that very slowly melts down to a small head. The wheat flavor predominates with some citrus (lemon) and spiciness (mostly pepper). The mouthfeel is crisp and rich and drinkability is great.

The citrus is noticeable, but not nearly as strong in the flavor as in the aroma. Coriander is present, but not overwhelming.

Tastes citrusy and earthy too, but these flavors are somewhat muted by the yeastiness of the beer. Light, closer to medium bodied because of the yeast.

The end sizzles a bit and leaves a sweettartness in the mouth. Lightly lemony with peaches and strawberry juice, this is refreshing and flavorful and pretty amazing.

Not ultra sweet smelling, which is good thing here. The taste is rather yeasty up front, but overall my first sip is better than expected. It is dry, not cloyingly sweet, with a light hop zing in the finish. I detect little to no outstanding spices here. It's really yeasty, too much so for me, but it is refreshing. As I sip on, a slight epoxy(?) flavor is emerging, a little like MH Circus Boy, and again this could be the yeast characteristic flavor.

Muted aroma, pale yeast and sweetened orange, but not excessive. Light mouthfeel, carbonation is not over-done, but fine and well-distributed across the tongue. For me, this is a nicely done Wit -- not showing its characteristics too obviously. Spices, Christmas cactus, and citrus rind flavors meld well and give a subtle husky nutiness to the flavor profile.

Taste was very light and unassuming in the beginning, but comes in with a strong wheatiness. In some ways the taste reminded me of watery pineapple juice. This was a light and refreshing beer.

More of a lemony fruit flavor with some sweet at the onset then tartness afterwards. A clove/banana combo I normally get in hefe's is noticeable here. There's a nice little spicyness which only compliments the beer but I don't get much of it after the first few sips. Solid St. Bernardus yeast holds the beer together and makes this wit better than most. Pretty good and balanced, in the middle of being either too tart or too wheaty, which is what I like.

The taste was not as robust as I had hoped, but many excellent subtlties became apparent with some attention. The crisp, dry, orange-tinged wheaty-firm base quickly revealed a refreshing light acidity. This acidity carried with it a host of earthy spice notes...light coriander, orange peel, lime. These flavors were carried through the soft finish and lingered for several seconds afterwards. The body was silky yet light and frim, matching well with the crisp and refreshing nature of this beer.

3.91,-6,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Very hazy, very thick, pale yellow/orange colog. Off-white head, very foamy, heald the whole way down. Smells slighly musty, not overpowering. Sweet on the tip of the tongue quickly showing its spice across and on the finish. Lots of yeast. Not heavy, feels good, could use a couple.","packetknife","Oct 14, 2003"
3.65,-12.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Not the best I've had of this style but not that bad overall. Cloudy gold ale with white head and minimal lacing. Big wheat aroma that's on the spicy side like a Hefe. Flavor is of malted wheat with a subtle hint of citrus. They do a better job with their Belgian Ales.","BierReise","Oct 12, 2003"
4.1,-1.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"11.2oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep hazy yellow with two fingers of fluffy white head. There is a good amount of lace left on the glass. The smell is slightly yeasty with tiny hints of orange, lemon, and wheat on the nose. The taste is light citrus with fruity esters. Only a hint of hops and yeast in the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth, very crisp. The drinkability is very good for this great summer session brew.","SheepNutz","Oct 06, 2003"

4.3,3.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Hazy pale gold hue, white rocky head, two fingers worth, slowly fades to a long lasting cap, little lace was produced. The nose is very pleasant, tart and acidic with lemon notes galore, yeasty too. The coriander was very light. Fairly aromatic bouquet inviting. Dry palate, unyielding clove upfront it is rock solid until the soft orange and gentle coriander flavor is introduced along with dry piney hops. The wheat taste is perceptible. Pleasant tart finish with a light acidic/bready aftertaste. Medium-light body. Soft yet supple carbonation. Lightly creamy mouthfeel. This is a pretty nice Wit. Plenty drinkable. If you like Wits this is a must try, in general Id still recommend it.","bditty187","Sep 12, 2003"
2.74,-34.1,4,2.5,3,2,2.5,"No big deal. Yeasty, thin and boring, no depth, or complexity. Lightly spicy and citrusy, yeasty, lightly tart, with a real stale, stagnant character, really nothing special at all, the flavour is one dimentional, the flavour is very thin, and well, just plain boring. Its drinkable though.","rastaman","Sep 09, 2003"

4.32,3.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Quite a good witbier, well-spiced. Though I prefer a little less in the spicing department, I think I could learn to like the over-the-top flavoring!","beergeek279","Aug 15, 2003"
3.84,-7.7,3,4,4,3,4,"A murky lemon yellow on the pour, head is adequate in size, the consistency spumescent, color a bright white as it dissipates the resultant lace a concealing sheet upon the glass. Bread dough comes to mind when I quaff this beer, tons of sweet malt, citrus crisp and quite refreshing is this nose, start loaded with malt and somewhat sweet, top middling in its feel. Finish is mildly acidic, the hops as expected, dry and somewhat tart aftertaste, cant really say Wits are my favorite Belgians, quite a treat nonetheless.","Gusler","Aug 09, 2003"
4.45,7,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Turbid pale golden hue. Thick, fluffy, persistent porcelain white head. Roughly textured lace remains. Vibrant wafts of citrus zest and sweetly herbal coriander dominate the aroma, with mild notes of yeast must and banana esters secondary. Understated in yeast contributions in aroma, but certainly well spiced. Snap of yeast and wheat derived tartness brushes the palate initially, then is ensued by mellow, yet brightly ripe clementine like citrus along with mild honeyish sweetness. Restrained, well integrated coriander emerges mid palate along with notes of candied lemon, reaffirming the vivid, crisp citrus presence. Lightly bodied overall, but agreeably proteinaceous and approaching creamy in mouthfeel. Paltry, nearly forgotten hop bitterness feigning a transient dryness surfaces late, only to be superceded by the oaty, grainy sweet, yet clean finish. An excellent witbier that's judiciously estery and superbly spiced. Soft and silky on the palate. Unparalleled in drinkability.","marc77","Jun 15, 2003"
4.5,8.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"St. Bernardus delivers the typical witbier appearance with a hazy yellow-orange body topped by a bright-white head of creamy foam. The head retention is excellent and it leaves some nice lace throughout the goblet. It's lightly floral nose is more delicate than many examples, but it still delivers all of the appropriate components including a soft note of coriander and a mildly zesty citrus peel that's both a little bit lemony and a little bit orange-ish. Somewhere in there, there's also an uncommon note of spruce that's really intriguing (but not strong enough to really garner attention). Some gently sweet malt also creeps its way into the nose as it warms. The body is light and it's very fine and gently effervescent carbonation tingles the tongue before warming to become lightly creamy. In the flavor, soft coriander appears up-front wrapped in a thin and silky veil of lightly sweet malt. It makes a suggestion of tartness but never really delivers it; and in this way it seems to fall into a middleground between the commonly sweeter versions and the more acidic interperetations. It finishes dry with a note of dull (chalky?) lemon, some gentle clove, and a lingering sweet note that's very mild but almost candyish in nature. Very refreshing; and quite interesting in it's subtle complexities. This is a must try for fans of the witbier style. Worth seeking out!","NeroFiddled","Jun 02, 2003"
3.63,-12.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Cloudy golden color, with an initially big white head that quickly and mostly diminishes to slight amounts of lacing. Aroma is super sweet, dominated by banana, with some clove in the back. Flavor is mostly banana, some of the clove sneaks in, and a citric sourness at the end. Body is medium. An ok wit, but it seemed to be lacking something.","goz","May 14, 2003"

4.57,9.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"I've had a couple bad American witbiers, but I've had very few bad Belgians. And this is another prime example of just complete mastery of style. A little too yellow to be a perfect wit, but it's got a nice head and a beautiful, slightly subdued, musty lemon aroma. Very nice. Tastes as it should -- citrusy, well-spiced. A fluffy lemon meringue pie -- in a beer glass! It, like Wittekerke, Hoegaarden, and Blanche de Namur, is a prime example of this style. This brew is loaded with subtle flavors that make this zesty beer so unbelievably light and easy to drink.","marburg","Apr 13, 2003"
4.82,15.9,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Taste is everybit as refreshing. Lots of citrus flavors, cloves, hot spicy coriander finish. Orange peel flavors and hot spicy flash at the finish then fade off to a super crisp dry finish. Very bubbly and light on the tongue. Highly carbonated and medium bodied. Easy going down and a very refreshing Belgian Wit. Look for this one and give it a try this summer, you won't be dissapointed.","StevieW","Apr 04, 2003"
