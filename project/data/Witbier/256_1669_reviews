"Hazy pale color with the unfiltered residue sinking to the bottom. It has a quickly receding head that isn't big to start with.  It smells like wheat with a touch of orange at the end, but isn't very strong.  Good balance of citrus and wheat with a little spice kick at the end. Nice crisp, light body with light carbonation. Overall, it isn't complicated or daring and follows through on what it claims to be. A solid wheat I could drink in any weather. Very refreshing and enjoyable."

"O- more like Blue Moon than Hoegaarden or Allagash. Would not purchase again but might be OK if you like light lagers, are in the heat or mowing the lawn."

"Feel: Crisp, and thin. Easy to drink, but could use a little more carbonation [4.25]"
"This was the first white ale and it was really refreshing and easy to drink"

"A good refreshing beer for the summer."

"Great refreshing beer.  Love it.  Great zesty wheat taste."
""
""
"Great Beer if you want to pound a couple after a long day."
"Awfully clear for a witbier. Orange peel, lemon, coriander, wheat, and floral notes form the aroma. Flavor is zesty, with orange, orange pith, and lemon peel underlying a light wheat backbone. There's a slight sweetness at the floral finish. Coriander is fairly subtle. The sweetness at the finish is slightly offputting."

"Very easy to drink, smooth wheat with some great undertones of citrus flavoring, just not too outstanding. Great summer brew - definitely would try again. Bought one as a sample pack at grocery store cuz I am interested in the Lost Coast Brewery and was not disappointed."

"Straw yellow in apperance with a decent white head. Smells really nice, fruits and some faint malt flavor coming through on the nose. The mouthfeel is nice and crisp, light and refreshing. Taste is pleasent, just not a whole lot going on. A light wheat beer with some faint hits of citrus. Refreshing for sure but not too complex."
""
""
"O- A good choice for a keg with friends coming and going, its lightness and refreshing qualities make it very approachable. Not able to stand next to better micro-hefes and certainly not top-flight German hefes in terms of flavor and complexity, but great for knocking around a few on the back porch."
""
""
""
""
"O - It's not a bad choice at all for a summer witbier. Low alcohol and ""drinkability"" (yes I went there) means you could kick back a 6pk with your buddy Jesse on a sloppy summer afternoon pretty seamlessly."

"The feel is much like every aspect of this Witbier and it is the lightness that it holds. The scent was not weak, just light, the flavor the same and the feel falls right in line."
""
"Its unfortunate that the beer struggles so hard for those true Belgian-esque flavors and textures. But his often misunderstood style deserves it. Again, its grain harshness, muted herbal display, lack of milky sourness and its void of quality vinous tartness really limit its quality."
""
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink and has some refreshing properties. It makes for a nice choice on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""

"Summary - This is a very drinkable beer, which is probably the best thing I can say about it. Not much special about it, but it goes down smooth and doesn't do anything wrong."

"Outstanding, unexpected, refreshing, rare, consistent, excellent, deep, light, complex; all words which can describe this beer. This beer was hyped up to me, as allot of beers have been. I thought I was going to get another flavorless lager just to make one of my friends happy I tried it. I was wrong. Very very good beer. Try one, and I bet you will order it again. Has something for everyone in there."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is a bit spicy, some citrus as well. Taste is very refreshing. A touch of sweetness, some citrus, wheat, not as much spices as the smell, but some are present. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall a good beer to drink on a hot summer day."

"O - A great hot summer pool beer. I was definately surprised with the amount of flavor this beer had. A very easy drinking beer. Not bad."
"Lost Coast Great White Beer ---4/5."
""
""
""
"At the price that this is locally, this is a neatly budget-priced option for bare bones white ales. Some of my friends in particular love this stuff because of how easy it is to drink. This paired decently with pork topped with tomato, onions, and lemon squeezed on top. On it's own, well... It's something I'd take over AALs at parties, but I don't know if that's a good thing or not. For better or for worse, it's an above average witbier at the very least."
""
""
""

"O: Not a bad beer, but only average. Would not recommended."

"What can I say, I'm a summer beer guy and this one doesn't disapoint! Great label, light and easy to drink. This is a great beer to enjoy on a hot summer evening with a few 'blonde' friends! One of my summer favorites. Try both with and without an orange/lemon slice!"

"Anybody who rates this below a 4 is crazy. This is one of the finest beers ever crafted. The only reason I don't score it a 5 is because it's a witbeir and I'm not particularly fond of them. But this great white, I could drink all night. Serve it with an orange slice."
""
""
""
""
"i liked this one. it pours a sort of average looking clear yellow to golden color, with basically no head just a few patches of leftover white bubbles. the nose is nice though, fruity and robust, glistening yeast, and something tropical thats tough to place. the flavor is very balanced between the light wheat malt, heavily filtered and refined, the fruity yeast, somewhere between a hefe and a belgian, and the hops, which are english in the bittering sense but american and the dripping juicy sense. this is a very tasty brew. a little too thin on the body, i need more heft in my wheat beers, but just right on the carbonation, which is lively but not popping off too hard. overall id rather have a tangerine wheat, but this was a useful pint of beer, worth the four bucks i paid for it, and one ill drink again before too long."
""
""
""
""
""
"It came out, it had a golden color body with no head. The aroma was of citrus and with some grassy, malty notes to it. The taste had some nice lemon notes and wheat to it, also some fruit and citrus also. The mouthfeel is was very good, good carbonation and easy to drink. Overall this is a good beer."
""
"O - average at best"
""
""
"Pours golden to straw with a hint of haze and weak white head. The aroma is mild with candy apples, malt sweetness and a dash of lemon. The taste is much like the nose with malt sweetness mixed with candied apples and lemon. But now a nice floral hop flavor and a touch of bitterness intertwine with the other notes creating a pleasing array of flavors."
"overall a decent wheat beer, a lot like a fruity pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great White poured a golden color, with a nice size head that did disapate quickly. There were nice lemon aromas, with bits of wheat aromas as well. Nice lemon flavors, but a weak wheat flavor, also some yeast flavors mixed in. The flavor was a bit weak, and watery. Overall it was a nice witbier, a bit watery, but still good, and was very refreshing."

"Poured from bottle into pint. Pours a hazy hay color with a lot of head. Smells of floral sweet malts and a bit of spicy citrus. Taste is of sweet but sour citrusy wheaty malts. Some clove and banana but otherwise too sweet and lemony. Its easy to drink but rather blah. There are better offerings usually around, although it is diff than most I've had of the style, just not overly pleasing."
""
""
""
"O- Overall nothing exciting about this beer. Pretty boring and tame."
""
""
""
""
""
"I happen to like the mouthfeel, even if it's off style, since it makes it great for summer. It's way lighter than a true Belgian Wit, but it's not nearly as sweet, so they balance each other out. I'm ambivalent about this beer and its lack of complexity, but the good outweighs the bad."
""
""
""
"Overall: When I first looked at the label, I was expecting a wheat beer, but I think I was also expecting maybe more to pack a punch. Considering that, I was totally looking forward to more then what I got. Not a bad beer, but nothing that blew me away. Just too average I guess."
""
""
"I cannot get this in Kansas City, if I could, it would be a summer time staple."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - It's been a while since I've drank a witbier.. this is a pretty good one."
""
""
"Barely more flavor than Coors Light. Give it a pass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was just an average witbier. Nothing special here. Definitely had better, but certainly not bad."
""
"Pours a clear light amber with a little yeast in suspension, one finger fizzy white head is gone quickly. Smell: lightly fruity, lemony coriander. Taste: wheat twang, coriander, herbal notes. Crisp carbonation into a slick finish. Overattenuated, boring. No thanks."
""
""
"I'm a fan overall and would recommend it for some casual drinking buds. Looks like a lager, smells and tastes like a wheat beer and called Great White, for a killer craft brew to try. Not super special, but it's a craft beer....so it's special!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Single finger head with lots lacing on a cloudy murky body. Musty hop and malt aroma with light lemon note. Light to medium body and Moderate carbonation. Musty and malty flavor. A little plain with a light lemon note. Overall very drinkable but simple."
""
""
""
"Overall; The black tea was interesting in the front of my tongue. Reminded me of earl gray tea(my favorite). Little wheat driven and more richness then expected."
""
"Overall - Light, but a unique and a distinct beer. It's certainly an American twist on the classic witbier. Session friendly."
""
"Overall: this is a decent witbier, even if it doesn't really look like one. I'd have it again."
"But as their best-seller, I can see why; its probably going to agree with everyone who drinks it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy light yellow with a 2 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a chunky island of foam. Small streaks of lace form randomly around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of perfume, fruit, and spices. There is a hint of grain as the beer warms up. Taste is of grain, perfume, and spices. There is a slightly fruity aftertaste as well. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer and not something I would revisit again."
""
""
"Medium-ish body with an appropriate effervescence for the style, sharp up front but fading fast. Slightly drying in the finish. This could easily be labeled a wheat and is easily confused with one. Good but nothing more."
""
""
"O - I like witbiers and this just didn't impress me. Instead of taking time on art design with their sharky they should work on balancing their beers better."
""
"O – Won’t be drinking this beer again. Not bad but it is nothing worth looking for 3"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the beer is really quite pleasant. I could see myself drinking several of these, but I couldn't see seeking it out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good, refreshing nonetheless, I like it but would go with Hoegaarden over it if that puts it in perspective."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: great intro beer."
""
""
""
""
"O-An average wit without much character."
"O-a typical wheat beer. not much that stands out. no real reason to buy this again"
"The Great White beer from Lost Coast is ok...the beer poured a pale straw clear color with vitually no head and no lacing. There is not much to the smell, slight faint citrus and spice. The taste is crisp tangerine and spice flare with some malt. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with decent carbonation. Overall the beer is ok....probably best for summer days!"
""

""
""
""

"O- Definitely won't buy this again. Price wise, there is no reason why this beer should cost what it does. Feel like the quality is just not there."
"Nice poor, very light head. This beer is unfiltered but not cloudy. It has a plesent light malt and fruity smell. Very smooth and refreshing. I taste wonderful spring water, light spices and citrus. I would personally highly recommend this beer. If you like even more fruit flavor then try the tangerine beer by lost coast. My wife likes that one."
"Overall this is OK. Better than macro swill, but friends are telling me my home-brewed wheat beer is more complex and enjoyable."
"O: I was expecting a lot more out of this. However it doesn't have much complexity. There was a slightly unpleasant after taste that I couldn't put my finger on. Definitely not bad, just not the best."
"O: Like I said it’s not a complex beer at all. But it does a great job of refreshing you. It would be great to drink on a patio or at the beach on a hot summer day."
"I like what Lost Coast is doing and how their beers stand out but it's tricky to review them! Definitely would be a great beer for summer."
"This brew poured out as a hazy looking orange color. The head was white and fluffy, leaving a pretty nice lacing behind. The smell of this beer has a good amount of citrus and some floral spices on the nose. The taste of the beer was refreshing, floral and citrusy. The mouthfeel was light bodied and smooth, it had a good carbonation to it also. Overall I found this brew to be pretty tasty, surely an enjoyable beer."
"The mouthfeel of Great White is rather light so if you are hoping for a really strong beer, I would suggest you look elsewhere. For those who like wheat beers and know what is good when it comes to the style then this mouthfeel will not disappoint. This offering is light and crisp and really is a good beer that will both satisfy and refresh on those hot summer days. The low ABV and the nature of the beer allows the drinkability of this beet to be quite high."
"Overall - not a bad brew at all, and somewhat intriguing, although not terribly complex. Still good to taste though."
"Kind of like what you'd get when mixing a bud lite with a glass of lemonade. Well, actually not at all, but you get the point - a non-sweet lemon drink. Has its refreshing qualities but would not pursue."
"Overall, I'll finish the 6 pack I have gladly, but I wouldn't jump to get more of this. There's much better beers that exemplify the style."
"A middle of the road attempt at a witbier. Lacking depth and yeast character."
"Overall a very drinkable California version of a witbier. At least that's my take. To me, it really tastes like a light version of Franziskaner. The same types of spices are there but ya just can't fully taste them. Sessionable for sure."
"Trader Joe's is helping me open my eyes to random new beers at considerably low prices. (They should pay me for all the shilling I've been doing for them lately...) This case-in-point pours a clear straw topped by a finger of white foam and populated by a bunch o' little floaties. The nose comprises lemon zest, orange zest, light grapefruit zest (this is one zesty beer, eh?), coriander, confectioner's sugar, a twist of lime, and a few drops of honey. The taste holds notes of lemon zest, coriander, light black pepper, very light lime, light grapefruit, a touch of banana, and a honeydew slice or two. Nice and fruity. The body is pretty light, with a meekly moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, a pretty nice wit, something I'm kinda glad I've found at TJ's."
"An easy drinking wheat beer, sure, but the other witbier qualities seem to be forgotten on the side of some NoCal highway."
"Pale yellow with a strong white head that does not lace. I was expecting more haze in the body than there was though. Nose is dominated by citrus, specifically lemon rind, and is otherwise one dimensional. Citrus is also in the body, though tea-like notes become more prevelant over time. Carbonation is low. Now for the truly damning statement: I would rather have had a Hoegaarden."
"Wit is one of my least favorite styles, though as I remember, Great White was one of my first craft beers and certainly my first wheat beer. I like it, I'm not likely to buy it again soon, and it isn't a very hearty Wit."
"Pours a light yellow with little head. Nose is citrus and mild spice. Taste is not what I expected; lemon and straw, but there's something off about it. Mouthfeel is light, crisp, and dry. Not disappointed I tried it while in CA, but not impressed."
"Notes: Dissapointed with this one after my positive experience with Lost Coast Indica on tap at the store earlier. I guess you win some and you lose some. This beer is not good."
"A citrusy witbier lacking spices, character, and definition. An extremely simple and average witbier."
"Move over Jaws there is a new shark in town! Great White is the perfect summer bbq beer. The pale golden color and amazing taste made me an instant fan after my first one. It has a nice citrus smell with a hint of what i think is vanilla and it goes down smooth. Go out grab some and have a bbq with your friends,you wont regret it."
"There are very few beers I won’t finish, but this is one. I couldn’t get away from the feeling I was drinking air freshener. Blech."
"D - Blah, the spices come off as flat and the malt is too sweet for it to be really drinkable. A little bit of tartness would go a long way towards balancing things out, as it does in the few good examples of the style, but this beer is completely lacking in such acidity and it shows in the flabby finish. Not terrible for what it is, but like most witbiers, it is not something that I would drink again."
"Final thought - at $7 this won't hurt your pocket and will impress the ladies"
"Notes: Great summer beer that’s very drinkable and refreshing. Good quality but not complex."
"Pours a clear golden color with pure white head that dissipated after a few minutes. Left very minimal lacing on the glass. Smell gives of a sweet grain and fruity tones. Flavor is sweet with hints of lemon and a bit of spice. Has a medium body and not a lot of carbonation and has a smooth finish. A good beer with many different flavors (lemony and spice)"
"Overall: Decent enough and easy to drink but this is really a wit made for the witless - way too sweet and not nearly spicy enough"
"Overall - A nice above average white beer. I found it had a more potent flavour on tap than it did in the bottle."
"This is a good beer any day but is even better on a hot one."
"Before becoming more familiar with beer and developing a pallet, this beer was enjoyable and refreshing. However, that has all changed. There is too much tangerine and spices added the beer, giving it a poor aftertaste. Color is a bit cloudy. All these aspects make this beer sub par. Overall an alright beer but not one I would actively choose."
"Overall: A very well made beer and an interesting experience, but with all of the crazy spices you can put in wit beer, this may not be my favorite example."
"O: A mix of sour American Pale Wheat ale and witbier, and not successful."
"Overall: Simply not a good Witbier"
"I've only tried this beer on tap, yet every time I have yet, I like it more and more. Head wasn't that big, with very slight lace. The nose was very pleasing, with slight citrus hints and a very slight hint of honey. On the palate is very refreshing! Well carbonated. I could taste citrus, with slight hints of sweetness. Overall, this is a very good beer. I would highly recommend this to someone who had never tried it. I will try it in a bottle next time!"
"D- this is very easy to plow thru alot of these..but just not alot of taste ..worth a try ..but i wont be looking for this one"
"D) A beer has to be truly stellar to stand out in this crowded category. I found this one to be good but average"
"Overall, just an average wheat beer for me. this was a one 6-pack that was for the time and perfect for the summer/early fall in HI. Beach beer."
"Poured aggressively for a 1-finger head, reduces to nothing, runny lacing, color is slightly-cloudy corn yellow. Aroma of slight lemon peel and very light malt, taste is the same. Very simple session Witbier."
"This was the only craft beer at the corner store in northern California that I hadn't tried, so may as well give it a go. Pours a golden-yellow colour with fizzy white head without any lacing. Smells strongly of lemon with some of the wheat malt. There is a lot of sweetness, but still some tart lemon flavour. Medium bodied carbonation. Easy to drink, but too heavy on the citrus and too low on the beer flavour."
"I guess I've had better domestic wit style beers, but this isn't bad at all. Have to say I'm a bit surprised by the low scores, as I thought this a pretty solid interpretation of the style. Of course having it fresh right at the source probably doesn't hurt."
"Poured into a pint glass. The color is a bit of yellow-gold with a bit of a white head and little lace. The nose is a bit of citrus, wheat, and light spicing. The taste is a bit bland with some pale wheat and very mild citrus. Body is nice with good carbonation. Makes up for some of the flavors. Decent beer, but not something I'd seek out again."
"Very toned down flavors in this one. Almost no spice to speak of. It was hard to pick out anything in the nose. This is an enjoyable brew though. Very refreshing."
"Great White is a great beer if you're not much of a beer drinker. But if you are an advanced beer drinker, this will seem rather weak and basic. It pours a lighter yellow color and is very easy drinking. It has a decent mellow flavor but no voloume in it's taste. Comparison wise it's around the same grade of beer as Miller Lite. It's not a bad beer by any means, it's just not a good beer."
"Drinkability: quite drinkable."
"Value: Lost Coast beers are an excellent value. This one is no exception. Not bad at all, paid $1.59 for a single. I'd take this over Blue Moon any day."
"Mouthfeel is light with a crisp amount of carbonation."
"Drinks really easy, liked this much better than a previous time when I had this on draft years ago (served too cold IMO), nice if simple take on the style"
"D - Pretty drinkable, would lbe a lot more so if it wasn't disgustingly sweet."
"D: This is my beer to drink when I just want a beer. Really enjoy the flavor that comes from a Great White."
"Note: Not at all what I was expecting from a white beer and I have to say I was a little disappointed."
"overall, i like it. good beer for a hot florida day."
"D: With the light subtle flavors this is a easy going brew, but the overall drinkability give off a fast drinking beer. Not many complex flavors bur just enough to go back to search for them."
"I'm going to forgo the usual format for reviewing beers, because this is going to be brief and to-the-point. This beer is just plain underwhelming. As I poured it into my Sam Adams perfect pint glass, the nice faint orange haze and lively carbonation was a promising start. Little did I know just how quickly things would turn. Very thin, watery. Malts barely surface. Coriander and some ""secret blend"" of herbs? Not detectable on the nose or palate. Lost Coast categorizes this to be a wheat beer, but it goes down like a summer ale gone horribly wrong. The 1.5 mark for drinkability isn't an exaggeration. I can't remember the last time that I refused to finish off a sixer of anything that I purchased... until Great White."
"Swirl poured into a beaker. One finger white head on a slightly hazy dark lemon. Very transparent for a wit. Citrus and bread smells. A bit weak in the taste department but defiantly a spicier rather than a fruitier wit. Mouthfeel is light and well rounded. Pretty drinkable although it's weakness might be a bit boring after a while."
"D - Wow, extremely quaff-able! It's been a while since I've had a Witbier, I'd forgotten just how refreshing they are. This one has a good amount of flavor, I think I'd buy this one again sometime. Cheers!"
"A decent witbier, highly drinkable and refreshing."
"this beers pretty average and not worth looking for"
"D- meh, not my favorite of the style. sessionable, but a little boring to have more than one or two."
"No noticeable aroma, taste is much the same, you might pick up faint lemon & coriander aspects of it, but barely, and you might be searching to find even that. No hops, no aftertaste."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and a perfect session beer. Great flavor and light body. Appealing to the senses. I'd highly recommend this to others, especially as a summer time beer. If anything, the beer is too light. After a six pack you're left craving more."
"Drinkability: Witbier Light. Totally unimpressive. It's not bad, and a little fun, but not high quality or very complex."
"D: a decent session beer. i could easily drink too many. although, while it is a great beer, it doesn't really fit in the style of a witbier."
"Very average but very easy drinking."
"D - I liked this ok, it was refreshing as a lawnmower beer to me and I would not turn one down, but I have had many better tasting wits with fuller flavor - it just felt middle of the road overall"
"I'd definitely do this one again!"
" I was pretty impressed overall, and found it quite tasty and fairly drinkable, which i'm learning is routinely the case for Lost Coast offerings."
" ~ I have to say this is not the best whear wit I've had. The flavor is good, which really makes up for the rest of the inadequacy."
"D - fairly drinkable, but needs more taste to compare to others in the style"
"On-tap at Tops Tasting Room, Tempe. Light watered down wheat, an uninteresting wheat. Looks OK with decent white head, smells OK, but not so drinkable. Some lemon juice and corriander and the whole thing is not so tasty, just doesn't get me. An entry level wheat."
"Not very appealing, though it is different than any other witbier you'll find. Originality doesn't always lead to a desirable product, unfortunately, and it's far too uneven with all the added spices."
"Drinkability: Nice beer but doesn't quite fit the style."
"I recall a version of Great White that was obviously unfiltered, delivered more taste than just the overpowering sweetness of this brew, and had a more substantial texture (consistent with its appearance). I first detected the transition from ""Old Sharky"" (as I like to think of it) to this current beer in the summer of 2008 during a visit to the Lost Coast pub in Eureka. Since then I have had it many times out of the bottle and once or twice on draft, with the same conclusion. I would be interested to hear if other long-time drinkers of this beer observed anything like the change I describe."
"D: ABV wise, this is highly drinkable, the coriander was too overpowering for me which makes this a beer that I would pass on in the future."
"Drinkability: Very nice and mellow, that is both refreshing and not overpowering. Perfect for hotter climates. I could certainly drink a few of these at any get together under the sun. ""Great White"" beer is worth a look, and don't worry...it's safe to go in!!!"
"D- An ""OK"" beer that is most likely better suited for warm summer days. I would defiantly drink one if offered however this is overshadowed by many similar beers, and due to this I would not buy another."
"Drinkability- pretty good, great summer beer, perfect for when you are working"
"When i think Great White the first thing i think of is citrus. its probably the first beer i tried long ago that was brewed with any kind of citrus ingredients. its aroma is mild, and appearance is light. it has little to no head. on the tongue it is light but creamy, with mild hints of that famous citrus that get more and more prominent the more you drink. although all in all its a light flavoring that adds a touch of individuality to an already descent ale. a real good beer to drink if your outside in the sun, at the beach or river bar, coming out of the ice chest a few degrees cooler than the fridge."
"Sample at Alan's HSC initation. Bottle from Howard's Market in Tehachapi, CA. This brew is a clear yellow-gold color with a thin white head that diminishes quickly. Spots of lacing. Odd aroma of malt and vegetables at first, but it dissipates into a mild spice pretty fast. Light-bodied with a flavor akin to a Pale Lager. Light hops and spice flavor with a bit of citrus. The finish is mildly spiced with a short citrus aftertaste. Barely average overall."
"Drinkability: A decent beer that I wouldn't want too many of. There are just so many great beers out there to conquer this one."
"I would give this a better drinkability review do to the fact that i cant ever just have one of these. working in my garage I found myself drinking alot more of them then I should. Great white goes awesome with spicy foods! I believe great white is the pringles of beers. once you pop you cant stop! great beer!"
"D: I don't think I would make this a regular session beer just because it's probably a bit too sweet for that. But it's still something I will come back to every now and then."
"It's a pretty decent summer option, which tastes pretty good even as it warms, if slightly bland."
"A great, unassuming wit, nice twist in the flavour profile from the norm, a decent quencher that would make an excellent sessional. I'm grateful for the one I was given and will have to pick up some more."
"Notes - OK mouthfeel but nothing really stood out for this witbier."
"Drinkability - an okay beer for a session, although a touch bland, I imagine a beer like this gets lost in the shuffle amidst the great beers of CA."
"Crisp. Obviously citrus notes hit you first when you smell that disappearing foam head. I quickly questioned the serving temp? I dropped the fridge to a chilly 34 degrees. Much better served cold. I chopped up a fresh Orange and placed slices in the bottom of the pint glasses. I had many complements on this move. I vote serve this beer cold and drink them fast. Face it... some summer wheat's can be disappointing, this one is not. Cheers."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable - good session wit. I would love to try this on draft."
"Not a great beet, but an easy to drink beer."
"Tucson summers are miserably dehydrating. This beer is refreshing and won't leave a dry feeling in your mouth that an IPA or pale ale will this time or year. The appearance is slightly cloudy showing it hasn't been filtered to death and the aroma that of any good wheat beer. I find myself enjoying a lot of this lately!"
"[1x]"
"The body is slightly better than average for the style. The drinkability on this excellent. This is one of my favorite go-to summer beers and a good change of pace from the heavier beers of winter."
"I suggest drinking this at the beach"
"Drinkability- This is good stuff. The best wit I have ever had. I couldn't think of anything better to drink on a hot summer day."
"I had this side by side with another witbeir. This one was the least complex and teast remarkable of the two."
"Drinkability- I don't hate it like I used to when I went to Humboldt State and every college kid was drinking 12 packs out of the bottle. It's better than I remember, but still not a very good example of a witbier. It drinks easy, but that's because there's not a whole lot going on and not much alcohol in it. Not offensive, but not note-worthy, either."
"Pours slight hazy yellow with white head. Nose is atypical for witbier style- very tepid, with faint citrus and somewhat yeasty. No lemon, orange/coriander, or anything distinctively witbier. Palate comes across as an ordinary wheat ale as well - nothing distinctive to the style."
"libation. Do yourself a favor and skip this pour for something you won't regret!"
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into a standard shaker glass. Appears a hazy bright yellow color with an inch of creamy bone white foam. Smells and tastes of light citrus such as orange and lemon, wheat bread, spicy yeast, and a mild hint of black pepper. A bit thin bodied, but not too drastic, with ample carbonation. Worth a try."
"Refreshingly carbonated, I could easily chug a couple of these on a hot day and not even know it."
"All and all, a pretty solid witbier if you ask me."
"A light golden hue with some cloudiness and a small head and no lacing. A zesty, peppery smell with minor notes of clove, lemon and wheat. A thin-bodied beer that bordered on being a tad sour as the citric notes (lemon/orange) are sharp and cutting and there is very little of the spices on the back to balance or wheat to offer some fluff/sweetness. An alright wit but I don't see myself drinking a sixer of this anytime."
"Hmm. finishing the glass was a task... any more would be unpleasant. Not sure this one really falls into the white beer category... more like a pasty, ghostly pale with some citrus. Not my cup of tea... just average on the whole. And I really wanted to like this one - 8 ball is one of my favorite stouts. But I just can't say much positive about this one."
"D: Nothing to speak of. Went fine with my quesadilla, but probably wouldn't have it as a stand alone."
"Drinkability: For all it's faults, it's still pretty easy to drink. With that said, would I really want another? Hmmmm... probably not. Was gonna give it a 3.0, but I'll bump it up to 3.5 for old times' sake."
"Clear golden color with a decent fluffy white head and good clumpy lacing. The aroma is clean rice cereal, a little skunky with a suggestion of citrus. The taste is crisp, tingly lemon wheat. Kind of whimpy, watery. Tart pumpernickel bitterness. Sharp and thin, not my favorite combination, but a drinkable refreshment in a pinch."
"Drinkability: Honestly, I couldn't find anything remarkable or special about this beer. I am sure some people really enjoy it, may even be their favorite? But its just not for me. Sorry."
"This poured a golden yellow color with nice white head that did not last. Aroma was of citrus fruits, spice, and wheat. The taste is of the same with the citrus dominating the flavor. Mouthfeel is good. Drinkability would be high on a hot summer day. This not great, but damn it is refreshing."
"Golden light blonde color with some nice white head on the top. Very aromatic indeed, citrus in full bloom. A refreshing taste that is light on the palate and very smooth coming and going. Great beer to compliment with some salmon and arugula salad. A summertime session beer without contest. Recommended."
"Overall an average session beer and an odd, half-baked attempt at a wit."
"Overall I agree with others that this isn't quite a wit. That being said, it's still a solid beer that I could drink a few of in warmer months. Worth a shot."
"(rated Apr 30, 2007)"
"From a 22 oz. bottle purchased locally. Aroma is yeasty, grainy and a little spicy. Color is a beautiful straw yellow, clear with a small white head. Flavor is grainy, with some fruit, fairly restrained with a hint of sweetness. Easy drinking and not over carbonated."
"Drinkability: not as refreshing as others in the style. Flavor profile is very mild and not overly exciting."
"D: This is a refreshing beer, and above average on the whole, but I'd rather grab a Hoegaarden."
"The body is somewhat thin and dry, lacking in richness and the taste is pretty much the same as the smell. Orange peel, some spice and not much more. It is far from inspiring and I will probably stay away from this one unless I have to, or someone hands me a bottle. Turning down a beer is always alcohol abuse in my book."
"The aroma is of wheat and a little bit of spice. The taste is clean with wheat dominating most of the way through with some bitterness on the finish. Coriander and lemony taste linger in the mouth. Overall not a bad one but not my favorite of this style."
"For almost $9.00/six-pack, I'll spend my money elsewhere."
"Thanks to Mark for letting me try this one."
"The taste is mostly just orange zest and orange cleaning chemicals. It has a hint of spices and herbs, a hint of lemon, and a very faint hint of grain. It's sweet up front followed by a mild, lingering chemically perfumy orange-cleaner bitterness that's sticky and lingering. It's reasonably easy to drink, at least at first, but the orange element is very tiresome."
"This is a pretty nice wit. In effect, it's a pretty timid copy of the better Belgian varieties (or some of the excellent American examples), but it's genuinely a wit at least. Very drinkable, refreshing, enjoyable."
"Despite all that, on a hot summer day @ say...Whitefish Montana...I could pound these all day long given the lower ABV and the ease that they go down. In that sense this is a decent Wit...."
"Appearance is slightly cloudy but brilliant yellow with a lively off-white head. Aroma is full of fruity esters like orange, lemon, peach, mango and then some bread dough like yeastiness and finally some fresh herbs like basil. Very complex. Taste...mmm...kind of like a summer meadow in a glass. Fruits, flowers, herbs, and yes, some maltiness, too. Just enough hop bitterness to balance any sweetness. Despite all the esters it's not a very sweet beer and actually finishes semi-dry for a very thirst quenching pint. I've had this now from the bottle and on tap at their little brewpub. It's outrageously delicious on tap and the brewpub has the best grub in town. A bit more subdued in the bottle but definately worth seeking out."
"Poured a orange-peachish mix to me, sudded and looked like a hefe. It was really good on the nose but the taste was not for me. Not to say it was a bad beer, the citrous was there but it leaned toward a wheat, citrousy side on the taste. The nose lead me to believe the taste was better than it was. Drinkable."
"Light bodied, I could probably drink 50 of these but I think I'll just move on instead (after killing all these of course)."
"Smell is somewhat subdued, but taste has a nice slightly tart taste with notes of herb and spice. Nice bubbly mouth feel, finishes nicely with little to no aftertaste."
"Would have another one for sure"
"Overall- Not a horrible beer. A good beer for summer as it was refreshing and crisp. Nothing to impressive though."
"Mouthfeel isn't too good either. Almost tastes flat."
"D- A decent wit. There are definitely others with less of a muted flavor, but this is pretty good. A nice summer brew."
"D - Easy to drink, refreshing, though not a huge fan of the style, there are other witbeirs I would probably rather buy."
"Would rate this just very average."
"Surprisingly full mouthfeel. Not full compared to other styles, but for a witbier, its damn good."
"D: Nothing objectionable but not really worth much of a look. Easy drinking but not much else going on. Not really a witbier in my opinion."
"Not bad if there was a ""light"" witbier category."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not filling at all, mild kick, good representation of style, this is nice, refreshing, lighter beer that I could pound down for a long time."
"Not terribly exciting to drink, but theoretically refreshing on a warm day?"
"I drank this beer only because it was one of my friends favorites, I'm a stronger beer fan myself. Not that bad and its a local beer, I'm from Humboldt County. Tastes very much citrus but not super strong. A good beer if your thirsty and don't want to get full or drunk."
"Pours a cloudy, yellowish white with a decent white head. The smell is of biscuity malt, with grains and a hint of spice. The taste is similar to the smell, with biscuity malt, grain and, unfortunately, only a hint of spice. A decent warm weather thirst quencher."
"Light cloudy yellow golden color with a fruity wheat smell. Nice sweet wheat like spice. A good all around refreshing easy drinking beer, that kind of like a cross of a Kolsch & Wit beer. Completely unlike a traditional wit, which for me is perfect, as I hate the yeast used in them, and is a style I normally don't enjoy. This one is easily drinkable, and milder flavored. Enjoyed equally well on a rerate and the only beer classified as a witbier I'd ever want to touch again."
"A suitable wit, nothing really exciting."
"Overall a flavorful wit. Very drinkable."
"Great White pours a hazy, golden color with a minimal head that fades fast. No lingering head and no lacing as the beer is quaffed. There is a strong orange-like smell with no hop aroma present. However, a coriander aroma and an underlying scent similar to strawberries is pleasant. The taste is full of coriander and citrus tones. On the back of the tongue there is a lemon lime taste like sprite. I wish this beer had just a little more spice to it. Great White has a thin mouthfeel, with a refreshing level of carbonation. Not one of my faves, but it's a good choice to beat the Phoenix summer."
"Overall: Outstanding taste, refreshing, while maintaining some body and lots of flavor make this my favorite ""refreshing"" style beer."
"D: A pretty good wit, could get the appearance better, but overall, a nice beer, I could drink this again."
"I highly recommend a trial of this beer, it is too unique to pass up"
"Beer poured a yellow orange color. Not much head upon pour into the Sam Adams glass. Nose is mostly of malt and wheat and not much else. Taste is of those malts and wheats and not much else. Mouthfeel is fairly smooth, is light to medium bodied, and decently carbonated. Drinkability is not bad. This is a slightly better than average beer that lacks complexity and flavor to be a superior beer."
"Wit? Or American Wheat Beer? Kind of in the middle here, the spices are certainly present but want to get upfront more to really find a niche amongst other Belgian wheat imitators."
"Overall this is a decent witbier. I could see this being a good summer staple if it were more widely distributed."
"had on-tap served in a pint glass, appearance was a golden straw color with a nice white head. smells of spices and citrus. taste is sweet, spicy and citrusy. mouthfeel is light-bodied and smooth. drinkability is ok. most likley i will buy this one again and drink it again."
"This beer started out better than it finished."
"I poured this beer from the bottle to a 45 degree tumbler. The beer wa straw colored and cloudy. It had a fine white bibbly head that decayed pretty quick. The taste was slighly sweet with a hint of lemon which I do not normally like but this was okay . It was a clean refreshing summertime beer that I would drink again."
"D - highly drinkable, good tasting witbier"
"D: I was very happy with this one. It is a sessionable brew that I would look forward to drinking again."
"Wow. something's not right here in the taste either. Broad, sweeping citrus and wheat flavors but something unidentified is making me wince as I sip it and I'm considering not finishing it. It's some kind of artificial tasting late breaking yeast note that just stops me in my tracks. Mouthfeel is fine but this one definitely does not agree with me and I won't be trying it again."
"Notes: I like it; a good interpretation of a white beer. Too bad it doesn't live to being a great one, as suggested by the name."
"This is a pretty bad Wit, but overall as a beer, it is interesting. The flavor isn't bad at all, just very different and not wit-like."
"Drinkability was OK, but would not bother to try it again."
"A very drinkable beer. Easy drinking, low ABV, not filling. Not great, but II'd have it again."
"Pours a golden orange color with a fizzy white head. The aroma is sweet and fruity with just a hint of corriander. The taste is very fruity much like the aroma and almost tastes like peach/orange tea. I really love the orange and corriander flavors in a belgian wit but these smell and taste artificial. Overall, this is a pretty drinkable and refreshing brew, but I am put of by the artificial flavors present in this one. I don't think that I would not purchase again."
"Drinkability - Light and refreshing but special? Nah."
"Drinkability is passable due to lightness of flavors, but a bit skunky. Not very enjoyable."
"An easy to drink beer, Very refreshing."
"This is a pretty light, watery beer that would probably be fine for sucking down on a hot day...but your pay a high craft beer premium for something that essentially serves the function of a macro light, so I'm not sure why you would. I was disappointed with this Lost Coast offering and won't be bothering with it again. A classic example of a dumbed down American take on a fine Belgian style."
"I had this on tap at the Surfside Grill in Crescent City, CA. It's served up with a lemon wedge and has a dark golden color, frothy thick head (about 3mm) but not any lacing. It smells citrusy, even after having discarded the lemon rind. It was served very cold and tasted bitter, but refreshing and mainly of citrus flavors."
"This is defnitely one of the better Witbiers that I've had. Not quite a replacement for Avery White Rascal, but close. Better than Blue Moon or Sunset Wheat for sure, I'll definitely pick this one up again."
"Disappointing attempt at a witbier. I won't get this again; it just looks and tastes wrong. And it's not very good as a beer in general, style notwithstanding."
"This beer poured much paler than I expected, with a very fizzy and fragile white head. Aroma is fairly spicy (clove & coriander?), but flavor and mouthfeel are quite flat and thin, which is a bit disappointing...as is the beer on the whole."
"Pours a very pale tan, almost like a pale ale, with little head that disappears rather quickly. Has a strong citrus scent, almost like fresh lemons. Taste matches the scent, very citrusy, no bitter hop. It lacks some of the normal Belgian White spice and bite. Kind of bland. Washes the tongue with light carbonation and a creamy fluid, true with all Belgian Whites. All in all, refreshing, not a bad beer, but falls a little short of the Belgian White category..."
"Notes: Not a big fan of this one. Not a big fan of the brewery in general. 8 ball stout is decent but thats where it ends in my opinion. Looks decent but I'll pass on this."
"Drinkability: I like the witbier style more than pale wheats and I'm sure most BAs would agree that a straight wit would've been more interesting."
"Drinkability-Not real impressed. Can't get past the canned corn."
"12 oz. glass bottle- color of bright yellow , with a medium white head - nose of bananas , floral , cloves , lightly hopped and spices  taste of candied , bananas , hopps and spices- body is light , and frothy  aftertaste of sweet , hopps and spices"
"Pours pale yellow with the requesite floaties of an unfiltered, withminimal white head and very little lacing. Some pear/melon/citrus scents mixed with light yeasts. Smooth with mild carbonation. The secret herb additives lend to a unique flavor that in my opinion lasts a little to long in the finish. All said, not a bad beer but not an unforgettable one either!"
"D - Overall, this was fairly disappointing for a craft brew."
"Flavor is spicy and really refreshing. The main thing you can say about this beer is that it is good to drink. Or maybe you can say it tastes more like a summer spice beer. When I first started drinking craftbrews I rated this pretty high, but now I have to rate it above average but not outstanding."
"Poured light straw colored gold, maybe just a little darker than I would've expected. Decent white head. Nose is very floral. As for taste, it is sweetly malty with notes of subtle orange. There's plenty of citrusy flavor going on too. Carbonation is mild. This would be a great beer to session."
"While not an exceptional wit, this beer is very easy to drink and would make for a nice session beer on a hot summer day - very thirst quenching."
"The mouthfeel is crisp and quenching. It does remond me of a wheat beer in that sense. Drinkability is average although --I would say it would be far more drinkable on a hot day."
"Light white head and golden color make it a very appealing beer for very hot days."
"I've had Great White on tap and it was okay. I recently had one in the bottle, so I figured I'd re-review it. Quite frankly though, I don't notice much difference. That could be because of its rather subtle nature. It still has the faint citrusy scent and flavor, a decent combo of malt and hops. The mouthfeel is quite light and a little underwhelming. But it's quite drinkable due to the all-around smoothness."
"Nothing outstanding, but certainly refreshing on a hot summer day."
"D: Easily approachable, but not too exciting."
"D- i see this as a good refreshment as with other pale wheats. I get the feeling that this is a complex and tough style to brew. Definetly a good stab at it. I'd love to try it on tap. Worth a try for those who like the style. I'm not rushing back to this, but who knows when i'll run into again."
"Overall, a quite drinkable wit. Not a paragon of the style, but better than Blue Moon."
"Light in body with ample carbonation and a slick, crisp mouthferel. Meh."
"Gold in colour with only a bit of haze. Lots of carbonation with a light and spritzy mouthfeel. One dimmentional lemon cleaner aroma. Flavors of lemon rind, pepper, dill, and soap. The unique herbal flavors keep things from getting too dull, but this is kind of a weak Belgian wit- American wheat hybrid."
"Over the top orange essence in this one, with a subtle biscuit background. Why can't american brewers get this style right? Tastes like Orange Pledge wood oil was squirted into the beer."
"A light and easy witbier, very drinkable. Dunno if I'd stock the fridge with it, but I could see myself on a patio asking for a second someday."
"An excellent summer cooler"
"drinkability: a very good summertime quaffer. super easy to drink, this makes great bbq or poolside beer. enough flavor to keep things interesting."
"This beer is incredibly drinkable. I love Lost Coast and find it nice to see it on the menu at places. I much prefer this beer over the macro swill that just doesn't measure up."
"Appearance is a murky yellow/orange color which slightly resembles a hefenweizen. Little head was present, which left very little, almost no lace. Smelled good, slightly sweet. Taste is slightly fruity and wheaty and again tastes slightly like hefenweizen but more mild with hints of citrus. Feels full in your mouth and is kind of creamy. I can't see myself using this as a session beer as it is too good and heavy, but definately good to drink a couple with a meal or to cool down from a hot day."
"I really enjoyed this beer. Nice summer quencher."
"drinkability: pretty high"
"Perfect spring/summer brew."
"To me this beer is not a very drinkable brew. The taste just doesn't do it for me, and it reminds me of something that would give you a killer hangover in the morning. Some may like that fruity taste, but I wanted a beer not a fruit punch. I will however, not shy away from trying other brews by Lost Coast."
"Smooth drinking wheaty brew, just a note of orange in the taste. This would make for a good summer session brew, wifey liked them but I think it could use a stronger malt kick. Found this in Florida, not availble in the mid-west."
"This beer pours a pale yellow with a thick white head. Smell is citrus, and I guess coriander based upon the other reviews (don't really know what coriander smells like though). The taste is okay, the citrus although muted is fairly dominant. Wheat beers really aren't my favorite style. This beer is okay, I'm not likely to buy it again, but it's probably worth a try."
"As a sidenote, I did have a bottle left over after this session. I tried it with some pepper jack and crackers (late night snack). They went fairly well together."
"Extremely drinkable beer, would be especially enjoyable during the summer time."
"Nothing special."
"Pours a yellowish orange color with mild head. Aroma is barely there, not enough to comment on. With the first sip the coriander jumps out and takes center stage with barely there citrus flavorsin the end. At the first drink I gotta say I didn't like it. A few more drinks and it's ok. By the end of the bottle I really liked the brew. A decent beer you have to at least try."
"So, what do I think? It's just beer. Reminds me of the major label beers, with maybe a slight bit more flavor, but not much. I find it bland and boring. Not offensive, but not standing out either. If you have only craft beers in your house, perhaps this would be good for somebody who says ""you got bud light?"". I will now look for something more flavorful because I feel like I haven't had a beer yet.."
"Tap@ Lost Coast. Smelt OK, lots of aroma. unfortunately it was a bit sweet. Heaps of lemon icing sugar (thanks pogo), too sweet and tart, with nothing to back it up, finishes short. yeah, too sweet, has a nice full body, but it is sweet, so it makes it a little cloying, and the flavour comes across as a touch artificial (even though it most probably isn't)"
"Pours a foggy orange-yellow with a snowy white head that leaves a clean corpse (though short lived). Aroma has sweet malts and...Trix cereal. I taste wheat with a dash of sugar and orange citrus and a nice level of carbonation. Easy to enjoy many. I seem to enjoy this one better in a party atmosphere than at home, but it's good all the same."
"Easy to drink however to plain for me and not enough bitter."
"Drinkability: A light and easy quaffer, perfect for beaches, picnics, or summer evenings. Nothing too complex here, but certainly worth a try."
"The taste is mainly the yeasty wheat flavor that you expect from a wit. Sweet citrus comes in quickly, and the finish is dry and spicy. Next to no hop bitterness, I think a bit more bite in that department would have done some good. Easy drinking, middle of the road witbier."
"Pours a hazy straw gold color and is topped by a frothy pale white head. Wow the aroma is interesting, it has a candied orange peel not to it that is much different than I typically find in a Wit, it is almost like an orange cream soda with notes of vanilla. The taste is dry and tart up front and the finish has that note of orange cream, but it is a bit subtler than the aroma. There is a very subtle, earthy, coriander note, but this is quite tame, which is good as I don't like a strong coriander note in beer. This beer is nice and light, and quite quaffable; a perfect summer refresher. Not quite as complex as the best Wits, but still easily drinkable and this beer style is my lawn-mower-beer of choice."
"My advice: try 1, not 12"
"Pours a cloudy light golden color with chunks of yeast floating everywhere. A 1/2 inch head quickly disappears, leaving almost no lacing at all. Scent is very mild, slightly sweet. Mild grapefruit, wheat and corriander are noticeable here, but the ""secret blend of Humboldt herbs(*wink*wink) is nearly undetectable. Mouth feel is light, dry, and pleasant enough, with lots of carbonation. Overall it's underwhelming. It tastes fine, it'd just overly mild. Still, it finished clean and is rather refreshing. It would make a good summer beer or a session beer, and is quite complimentary of mild seafood."
"Overall impression: I first tried this while camping my way up the California coast last October. Tasted great after a long day on the road while sitting around a campfire, so I wanted to revisit and see if it was as good in a less idylic atmosphere (sitting in my home office). This one was still tasty in this situation - not the most thrilling beer out there, but a good solid easy-drinker for the warmer days to come. If you have a friend you want to ease in to better beer this would be a great choice."
"Cloudy hazy light pale golden color, spicy, earthy citrus aromas, nice white frothy head that sticks to the sides of my glass. Fresh wheat and mild spice flavors, crisp carbonated mouthfeel, finishes clean and dry,good for the style and very average."
"O.K beer, I would drink this if you gave me one but I wouldnt hunt it down."
"Light-medium bodied, very refreshing and drinkable."
"This could be an easy drinker on a warm day, fairly refreshing but pretty straightforward."
"Note: I must say, while I'm not wowed by this beer ourtright, I have never come across a better pairing for sushi--it ROCKS."
"Bottles of this on ice, served in classy, stemmed glasses, would rival most snooty white wines. Warm Florida breezes wafting the smell of mahi-mahi on the grill would be the perfect match for this!"
"Drinkability- This would be a good beer to take to the beach or while doing something relaxing on a hot summer day."
"Smells of wheat malt, coriander (light), yeast, and lemony citrus hops. Taste starts with mellow wheat. Notes of coriander throughout. Medium-bodied and proteiny. Lemon-citrus hop bite strikes late and leads into a dry, lightly-bitter finish. Refreshing and zesty. I don't know if I would call this a witbier per se, but more of an American witbier (see citrusy hop bite). Not bad."
"Pours a cloudy straw color with a nice finger sized head leaves some light lacing. Aroma is on the light side lemon with some spice ontop of grainy malt. Taste is lightly sweet grainy with lemon coming thru finishes with light pepper and clove. Overall seems like a toned down Witbier for the masses. Mouthfeel is medium light goes down smooth and easy nice and drinkable Witbier just missing the big flavors of a good Witbier. Nice thirst quincher for the summer time."
"Pours hazy gold orange with a thick white head. The nose is fairly aromatic with with citrus overtones. This plain and simple is really a decent American Wheat. Not too much complexity but great drinkability and just enough interesting esters of fruit. A summer beer that would be a pleasure on a patio in a mellow mood."
"Poured a light gold with a slight amount of cloudiness and a weak head that dissipated quickly. The aroma was of coriander and a touch of fruity esters. The flavor began with a dry wheat flavor balanced by a subtle hop bitterness which was quickly overtaken by a moderate coriander citrus and a floral accent. The carbonation level was a little rough at first making this ale have a bit more carbonic bite when it is really cold and freshly poured. I prefer this one without fruit and served at a nice 45 degrees or so to let the wheat flavors balance the spices a bit more. This is not a bad beer to have as the spice is refreshing and the overall character of the ale is light bodied and smooth. Making it a pretty good wit, though the Belgian examples i have had had a more champagne-like carbonation and more character from the yeast."
"Great White is not a classic witbier. It isn't bad, but it needs a more definitive sense of self. 'Hi, my name is Myron, I'm a great white shark and I lack the killer instinct.' All together now, 'Hi Myron...'."
"Hazy golden beer with a shower of large bubbles rising to the surface. Bright white head that fades quickly to a film. Fairly strong citrusy coriander and yeast aroma. Mild mandarin and coriander flavor, a bit grainy and bitter in the middle carries into the finish. Body is on the light side, but the flavor still sticks to your tongue. A nice witbier, nothing special."
"The beer deposits itself in the glass a hazy light lemon yellow with a decent bright white head that is semi-creamy in texture; the lace formed is a thin sheet to conceal the glass. Nose is earthy and sweet, crisp and clean with a slightly sweet start that has a lean grain profile and a leaner top. Finish is stinging in its acidity, the hops apropos to the style; I have tried this beer two or three times, not really a bad beer, just not a good beer."
"This is drinkable if you are making tthe first tentative steps away from macro lagers. I suppose it would then seem flavorful. Otherwise this is a bland attempt at a witbier made attractive only by comparing it's price to that of it's Belgian brothers."
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a very pleasant wheat scent with a fruity yeast aroma. It seems quite citrusy. The taste is good. It has a refreshing dry wheat flavor with a fruity yeast finish. It goes down very easy and finishes a bit tart on the tongue. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a damn fine wit. It has wonderful aroma and flavor; a great summer brew."
"Very drinkable, this is one of those brews that is good without having one outstanding attribute. This is a brew that gets all the basics right. Best American Wheat Beer I have had yet."
"One of my favorite beers to drink during spring and summer."
"Decants a cloudy, pale yelow with a fizzy white head that retreats immediately. The smell is heavily fruity with a surprising hop tang and some citrus that must be the ""natural flavors"" the label alluded to. The taste is very similar to the nose.A slight bitterness shows first, then mellows out into a wholly complex but mild frutiness. Green apples, strawberries and lemons come to mind. Mouthfeel is thin and refreshing with a big blast of carbonation. Drinkability is fine, but would be great in July around midday."
"The citrus / herb flavors are somewhere between full and extreme. The beer may become better if toned down a little bit."
"I don't know, on some levels this beer was appealing and quite drinkable. It made for a decent change of pace. On the other hand, the over-arching perfumey nature of this beer was rather off-putting. Try and reach your own conclusions; as for me, the jury's still out and it's heading for a hung-jury."
"Drinkability  I thought the big grapefruit was a little off, but otherwise this was a valiant attempt at this difficult style."
"For all its faults its a very drinkable brew..would be great in the summer heat."
"22oz. brew bottled in August 2003, Appears a hazy golden with a white short lived head nice webbed even lacing. A pleasant citrusy spiced up wit delivers a smooth slightly bready yeast note through my senses, overall light and spiced up with some tropical fruit like annuances. Tastes, zesty citrusy zeal it with spices and syrupy textured sugar very tasty and dessert like, hold the twist of lemon for me this one's packing enough flavor. Sharp sweet tone from the malted wheat due their duty nice micro brewed wit in my opinion. Mouthfeel is medium in body slightly sticky texured very nice high carbonation going on. Drinkability, definitely brings me back to the summertime, just one of those brews desigined for warm weather."
"BEWARE!!! This stuff is very drinkable. If your Catholic roots(I'm Irish Catholic, so I can joke) don't make you an alcoholic, this stuff will! The apperance is a cloudy straw color with a very white head. I could see come sediment in the glass, guess it's the yeast, at least I hope it is. the smell is kind of like roasted p-nuts and some wheat. The taste is more wheat than anything, but not too heavy on it. It's well balanced and not all hopped up like some brews of the same genre. The bottom line is that I really like it and will get more than a single next time."
"As far as American Wit beers made on the West Coast, this one is definitely at the head of the class. The tendency of brewers on the West Coast is to flood Wheat Beers with so much hops that they eventually taste like sierra neveda pale ale. I am not a style maven by any means, but when you try a beer and it tastes like a style that is different than what it claims to be that can be aggrevating. This beer had a great hint of citrus in the aroma and a nice sweet initial taste with a slightly dry finish. I had this in the 22oz variety and it seemed that most of the spices were down in the yeast sediment. It had a smooth mouthfeel and a mildly creamy head. My only complaint is that I did not buy another one to bring with me back to the East Coast -- I'm not sure if you cant get their beers over here."

"Prost!"
"Pours a cloudy golden wheat color with a nice head that dissipates rapidly leaving a lot of lace. The smell is undefinably wheat-y, with some clovy spices. The flavor is pleasant but very mild, with little hops or malt, just....wheat. I'm finding a theme here! Not a bad offering from Lost Coast, but not terribly inspiring, either."
"Light gold color, cloudy, medium head. An unfiltered wheat beer flavored with coriander and herbs. A lighter bodied beer, typical of a wheat beer. Taste is a little citrusy. Flavor is mild, not much hop or malt taste; most of the flavor is in the spices. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"On the palate it is soft and smooth, making me wonder where all of that lemon juice went. Creamy, with sucrose sweetness, there is a decent lashing of dried, powdery bitterness on the finish. All the same, low-acid to a fault ...seems a little too ""designed"" for my taste."
"I was very disappointed in this beer. It completely lacked the crispness I like in a wheat. In fact it was a bit watery, in my opinion. I can't recommend this beer to anyone."
"I really like this wheat beer. This light unfiltered beer poured a hazy light straw gold in color with no foam. The smell was of a malty aroma with a hint of wheat. The flavor of barley malts, wheat and spice was very well balanced. The combination of malts, wheat and spice with a hint of a spritzy citrus at the end made this wheat beer a pleasant quincher. A nice bitter/sweet/tangy finish. The aroma and taste reminded me of a Belgium Style Ale!"
"Overall: Far from complex, indeed, simply put, this is just a floral wheat beer with strong citric elements, and a persistent herbal dimension. Still, this is nicely balanced, and a great beer for sinking whilst sat outside on a warm sticky night. Very drinkable and highly refreshing."
"Cloudy straw yellow with snow white head that dissappeared in a hurry. Yeasty aroma with notes of lemon and citrus. Slight crispness and light to medium bodied. Flavor is a bit yeasty and tart. Flavors fall apart towards end. Not nearly as nice as Allagash."
"accompanied by a slight carb bite on the tip of the tongue."
"Pours a very hazy golden straw color with a moderate white head that fades into a patchy lace. Nose is dominated by grassy wheat with additional aromas of coriander and lemon zest. Light to medium in body and very crisp and refreshing. Taste starts off with sweet malts and a bit of honey followed by some spicy notes of coriander and some acidic citrusy hops. A nice wit beer and a great brew for the summertime. Thanks to Loki for the sample!"
"beer pours light and hazy gold. Flavor is sharp and spicy with a bare hint of sweet wheat behind the rake of coriander."
"Pours a cloudy light gold with a persistent 1/4 inch white head that leaves rings of lace on the glass. Aroma is a musty mix of citrus, coriander, and cloves. Flavor is pretty light, with some lemon, a touch of coriander, and some wheat flavors. Very light and crisp, with medium carbonation. Definiety not the best wit I've had, but a very drinkable beer for the summer."
"Pours a cloudy, pale yellow with no head at all. Aromas of coriander, orange, citrus, and maybe some honey on the nose. The nose reveals most of the tastes of coriander, citrus, honey, and wheat. This is a very, very light beer with little mouth feel and light carbonation. Very drinkable on a hot summers day. Would be a little dissapointing on a cold winter night."
"Really like the labels of lost coast beers,poured a hazy orange color with nice fluffy head,smelled very citruisy (maybe a little overpwering) and spicey.The taste didnt match the aroma, a little bland,citruis was present but not enough for me.Not real complex but not horrible either."
"Hazy yellow-orangish color. Rocky, bubbly white head faded in a hurry. Zesty, spicy whitbeer tastes. Lots of coriander and tangy citrus flavors. Traces of lemon zest and orange juice throughout. Highly charged and very bubbly. All the refreshing traits of a BelgianWit, but a little uneven, thin, and watery. No where near the complexity, balance, and flavors of an Allagash White. It did serve it's purpose and was very refreshing on the dreaded Bartow to Yeehaw Junction stretch of Florida Highway 60."
"Great tap handle - the beer is not up to what I wanted.  I really expected more of a Belgium candy taste and would have liked more flavors any flavors.  This is an average beer, they all can't be great."
