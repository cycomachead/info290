4.03,1.8,4,4,4,4.25,4,"Poured a clearish yellow with two finger head and nice lace retention on top of an aroma of spice and yeast, along with minimal citric notes and that brett is coming through. A touch of sweetness in this one for some reason, as the yeast is prevelant and helps make the beer fuller bodied and smooth. The spices and citric notes are there and the brett gives it a nice funky taste on the backbite which is pleasant. An interesting beer as the brett addition works well and is something I wouldn't have thought would work with a witbier, but it adds some complexity to beer without overshadowing the traditional witbier components (yeast/wheat twang. clove/corriander spices, lemon/citric tastes).","clayrock81","Jul 25, 2013"

Aroma of Brett and Chardonnay is quite dominant with light peppercorn and spicy yeast notes also perceptible. Taste is a good mix between some dry Brett notes with some Chardonnay notes with some clearly vinous notes and some spicy peppercorn notes which don’t really fit in too well with the rest of the flavours. Body is light with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. This is quite enjoyable though with the amount of Brett and Chardonnay notes I am not sure I would call this a wit beer any more. Some spicy notes of peppercorn could be removed since they don’t really bring anything valuable to the whole mix.","Phyl21ca","Mar 08, 2013"

Pours lightly hazy golden straw color with a foamy 3 finger bright white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of tart apple, pear, lemon, white wine, hay, grass, funk, acidity, pepper, and yeast spiciness. Fantastic aromas with huge complexity and balance. Taste of apple, pear, lemon zest, white wine, pepper, floral, hay, grass, light funk, wheat, earth, and herbal spiciness. Slight tartness and moderate earthy spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, white wine, pepper, hay, grass, wheat, earth, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Great flavor complexity and balance; with a nice malt/peppery flavor balance with nice brett flavors; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very crisp, smooth, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Wibier! Huge complexity and balance of flavors; and extremely smooth to drink, though I prefer to sip on this one.

However, one shouldn’t judge a book by its cover. At least it has little bubbles rising in it, sort of like champagne. Strong aroma is fruity and rather sweet, more like a cider than a beer. Maybe the Chardonnay barrels imparted this. Flavor is - oh yeah, it keeps getting better! A malty core with firm fruity and yeasty notes, rather sweet but not cloying, just a hint of grapes and a subtle sour tone. Lively texture has plenty of fizz, though body seems to be a bit lacking.

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, wood, spice, tart, and earthy funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, funk, earth, and wood. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. There was something a little offputting on this one. Most of the things I have had from Anchorage have been spot on, however the addition of Brett to a Witbier might have been a little much for my palate as they didn’t blend as well as some I’ve had in the past.

Definitely the funkiest aroma of all the Anchorage beers...I hate to say it, because I like the aroma, but it reminds me of farts. At first, you get a stinky "fart-like aroma" with a hint of bile. Then I get some delightful brett funk with lemon and citrus. Very crazy, yet favorable aroma. As it warms, the Chardonnay barrel really comes through Taste is initially light and crisp...refreshing...like a classic witbier or berliner. A lot of wheat flavor with lemon and some tart, brett flavors. Nice chardonnay flavor. Tons of barnyard and some floral flavors. Finish is packed with pepper and light hops. Mouthfeel is light-bodied, crisp, and refreshing. Overall, I could see the aroma of this beer turning people off...but I'm a man who loves some funk in his barrel-aged wild yeast beers.

The lacing was minimal though. The smell of the lemon zest and French Oak were the strongest aromas I could pick up. The faint aromas of spices were in there too. The smell of the Oak made me think this beer was going to be much more sour or tart but to my surprise it was actually pretty mellow. The flavors had a good amount of wheat notes along with the oak and spice in the mix. The mouthfeel was pretty good also, nice and light bodied, fairly refreshing also. Overall this beer was pretty good, I'd probably drink it again but I'm more excited to try some of Anchorage's other brews they put out now. This was my first Alaskan beer and I enjoyed it.

This one comes off a bit convoluted, despite being not a bad beer at all. There's more chardonnay than witbier in this for me, and I wish it was the other way around. That said, perhaps holding on to a case of all these new anchorage beers wouldn't be a bad investment. The problem of course being that all of these are 15$ a bottle.

After I popped the top hints of must and grandmas old attic closet waft my way. Nice brett aroma. As it gets closer to the sniffer the brett comes across as damp earth and musty closest. Hints of lemon peel and spice. Just a little bit of pepper. The flavor is fantastic. Light and crisp. The brett is damp, wet earth with must and a bit of barnyard. Lemon zest and a bit of coriander. Really, it reminds me more of a saison or funky BdG then a wit. Really fantastic. The mouthfeel is a bit lacking. With as much brett, I thought it would finish a bit drier then it does.

3.42,-13.6,3.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,"A random case o' this found its way to my most local haunt, and I just had to try it. It pours a clear pale-golden straw topped by a healthy cap of white foam. The nose comprises white vinegar, Brett funk, tart lemon, sour mandarin orange, light white wine, coriander, and cardamom. The taste holds notes of Bretty cobweb, dry lemon peel, musty lemonade, light honey, coriander, cardamom, cedar, and a touch of spicy grape. The lemon starts out as a dagger-prick of tartness, but then falls off into a moldy version of the fruit, where it malingers for a bit, only to die off completely in the finish. Something here doesn't sit right with me... The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, fairly sticky finish. Overall, this was an interesting brew, one that partially succeeds and partially fails. After a short bit of research, I think I pinpointed the source of the strange flavor: Sorachi, my old nemesis. Alright, that would explain things a bit. Beyond my hate for this hop (and all that it does to lay waste to beers' flavors), this wasn't too bad. Kinda interested to see what a bit of age does to it now...","TMoney2591","Sep 25, 2011"
4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"One of my colleagues spoke longingly of trying some of Anchorage Brewing Company's beers, touting that they age their beers in French Oak Chardonnay barrels which sounded lovely. Triple fermented...Brett yeast...YEAH. Once I learned that my friend works with the graphic designer for ABC's labels, I had to try some! I'm partial to a great Belgian Witbier, so picked up a cold 750 ml of Whiteout. It's a solid beer all around, a nice twist on a witbier. Poured a cloudy white-gold with a pillowy head and moderate lacing. A lot of orange peel in the smell. The taste, three flavors really stood out - black peppercorn and the Brett yeast, but really that chardonnay flavor from the aging popped out, so much that my cousin - a big wine dude - wanted to open a bottle of a California chardonnay he'd been sitting on and taste the two side-by-side. (We passed - a little too much for a Sunday afternoon watching baseball. But it would be a cool experiment.) Could pair this with roasted salmon or a summer's salad...or even a great cheese plate. Had an intense artisanal grilled cheese with heirloom tomatoes alongside Whiteout and the acidity of the tomatoes and the sharpness of the cheese matched the peppery flavors of the beer perfectly. A solid first dive into Anchorage - looking forward to trying their Saison next!","MrELovesBeer","Beers"

4.27,7.8,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a slightly hazy super light yellow with a 2 inch puffy white head that fades to a craggy cap. Thin rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of wheat, lemons, and the funky brett smell. Taste is of buttered wheat bread, lemon peel, subtle spices, and some slight funky flavors. I have read that butter flavors aren't desirable in beer, but I am really enjoying this flavor. The barrel aging in the wine barrels is evident as a fruity woodiness. There is a a good level of carbontion with a dry, crisp mouthfeel on this one. Overall, this is a very good witbier from this upstart brewery. I am very impressed with this beer and this is one of the best of the style I have had. I will for sure be seeking out more offerings from this brewery in the future.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 27, 2011"

The nose is lightly sour, and funky, almost like sticking your nose in to a jar of pickled eggs. The sour is not as pronounced in the flavor, but the funk sticks around. It also comes off bone dry in places. I especially get the black pepper and the chardonnay barrel influence. Mouthfeel is light to medium in body, with a good dose of carbonation.
