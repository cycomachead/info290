However the sculpin in the case was its usual sculpinrific self. All this beer did was make me drink it as fast as possible to get it over with. Citrus? As in a tablespoon of frozen orange juice conventrate in a gallon of water. BLUE MOON has more flavor and complexity. Granted maybe this style is more susceptible to mishandling on the voyage from CA to PA than Sculpin...or it was a bad batch. Only way I'd try it again would be if someone handed it to me....on draft.....at the brewery.....in a sample glass. Not a fan of the new label. Sculpin rules!

A light bit of wheat and yeast. Taste is bang on with a wheat graininess and Belgian wit level of of fruitiness. A touch of hefe like banana and clove subtly flowing. Bubble gum with sweet light malt. Finish is crisp and mild characterized by a lemony zestiness. Smooth carbonation and lighter body make this a superb summer quaffer. This is the ultimate lawn mower beer and stands head and shoulders above the usual fare. Low abv makes this a no brainer when you are busy and thirsty.","scootny","Jun 26, 2014"

Pours hazy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger foamy white head with decent retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with moderate streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, pear, banana, orange peel, coriander, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, floral, grass, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, pear, banana, orange peel, coriander, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light bready tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, banana, pear, coriander, clove, wheat, pepper, bread, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance of malt, spice, and yeast flavors; with a good amount of robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, smooth, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice witbier. Very nice balance of malt. spice, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 02, 2013"

Bottle mentions unmalted wheat and oats - I thought the haze was from bottle conditioning/not filtering the the beer, but presumably the fine folks at Ballast Point have more experience than me. The nose is grainy with light citric notes and that faint ester kick that identifies the wit. In the mouth, we've got a lot if carbonation, lending a slight metallic edge to orange peel and lemon. Backed by a slight spiciness (some coriander was harmed in the brewing of this beer), the pale malt, oats, and wheat base provides a smooth if overly thin drinking experience. The low abv and generally thin character do little to piqué my interest, but Wahoo is a fine companion for not thinking too much and enjoying a crisp, refreshing beverage on a warm, sunny day (March or otherwise).","BretSikkink","Dec 19, 2009"

The smell was good and true to form: clear, crisp, and clean, plenty of wheat and yeast, nice and spicey, and cirtusy-sweet too. The taste was fairly average: it had all of the ingredients of a good witbier: plenty of wheat, malty and bready flavors, yeast, spices and clove (but not as much as the smell would indicate), and sweet, citrus flavors (more than the smell lead on). It was enjoyable enough, but it was just too sweet, and a bit watery. The flavor wasn't as complex or as full as I would have liked. The medium-fizzy carbonation and the thin mouthfeel only increased the feel that I could drink this beer like water.

The bubbles keep on coming, though. Pretty light in the nose, with some clean, slightly lemony, grassy smells, but little spice and quite faint. The taste is a little more developed and somewhat more assertive, but still a little soft. Still, pleasant tastes of lemon, light cream, an herbalness, a trace of minerality, and some light floral bitterness. The mouthfeel is soft and creamier rather than sharper.

On the palate, brisk bitterness and carbonation first off, followed up by a creamy coriander note and then a light, fresh fruit note. The finish is spicy and a tad yeasty.

Pale, straw, golden for sure but Wahoo shows me a bit of lemon too! I sniff and find cloves and a hint of orange. I drink and immediately notice a thinness to the brew but at least it is very smooth. Maybe from the oats used in the grist? Thinness aside, Wahoo is very drinkable and refreshing, a bit of tartness in the finish.

Orange peel and coriander play along a medium light body peppered with sparky carbonation. The wheat adds a gentle fruitiness while the orange peel adds some zip to the finish. There is a tingly mouthfeel from the carbonation and at times the body feels a tad thin. The finish is spiked with a dash of cloves and lingering orange rind zest.
