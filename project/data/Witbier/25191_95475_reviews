"Very solid.  The tart and acidic fruits work well, and I like the the ultra high carbonation here.  Another well done beer from Crooked Stave."

"O: An excellent Americanized version of a witbier. Likeable and easy to drink - provided you like sweet stuff."
""
""

"Overall: Another really good beer from Crooked Stave. Lots of flavor and incredibly refreshing. This is the perfect beer to sit back and enjoy on a hot summer day."

"Kind of light in the nose, but the flavor is fantastic. Lemon, orange sweetness. Some barnyard funk along with a pleasant tart sour. Definitely embodies the summer label. Good dry finish and very drinkable."
""
""
"Another great brew from Crooked Stave."
"O: Very enjoyable, refreshing, and easy to drink. Definitely a very well constructed brew with a great brett presence. Highly recommend."

"Also, how in the hell is this a ""witbier?""  It's sour as hell."

"This brew kicks serious ass. Crooked Stave is producing sheer awesomeness. Highly recommended."

"KLight to medium bodied with modest carbonation. Has a tart citrus aftertaste. This is perhaps the most unique Witbier I have ever had, and I mean that in a good way."
""
""
""
""
""
"Lighter end of medium body with a nice dry, musty brett presence that's well integrated into the elements of the base beer. Not as exciting as the aroma suggests with subtle funk, earthy hop, grass and straw along with peppery spice, sourdough bread and light fruit notes. Some coriander and ginger along with banana bread, wild yeast, citrus rind and light fruit. Decent but somewhat of a let down considering the complexity and appeal of the aroma."
""
""
""
"(O)- Easily a great witbier with the Brett addition to mix it up. A good level of funkiness with the zesty citrus brings a nice feel to the beer overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I had really high hopes for this, but it was kind of a let down. Not as much funk as I'd hoped for, no sparkle whatsoever, and fairly bland for a bottle that cost $8.99. This was o.k. but nothing I'll be seeking out again."

"Overall - I have had CS multiple times and I finally found a chemical bomb. just horrible. I had it on tap and it was amazing, but this bottle did not age well. I will go back to Crooked Stave soon though"
""
""
"As the name suggests, this beer has a heavy emphasis on the Brett. But I wouldn't label it as a Brett bomb. It has some balance thanks to some nice fruit flavors. It's definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A fun, interesting, and flavor-packed Wit."
""
"It's pretty drinkable, even if there's not much to it beyond the Brett-bomb. I love the funkiness, but some additional spice or body or anything would add a little balance and counter-intuitively, make a more intense beer experience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wonderfully refreshing and tart. This was a fantastic beer to enjoy on this 80 degree SoCal day. Was hoping for more blood orange, but very enjoyable despite that fact. Crooked Stave continues to impress!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Damn if this is not your typical witbier. There is a lot of citrus undertones and a nice funk. It's probably not recognizable as a witbier since well, it's 100% brett, but it's quite interesting and enjoyable to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Don't buy this expecting your typical witbier. Falls more into the vague ""Wild Ale"" category for me, which is more what I rated it to. Wonderful crisp, refreshing blend of flavors. Glad I held onto it for about 6 months before having. Will be picking up more of this."
""
""
"A unique take on the Belgian Witbier. 100% Brett. Belgian White, with blood oranges and aged in oak. It is nothing like a Belgian Wit, which I'm sure they don't care. Is it a well crafted beer, but not exactly one that I would want to replace the ever so drinkable and delicious Belgian Whites with. Also, it is too expensive for what this is."
""
"Brett is a gamble when it comes to storing beer, and while I've had success stories with it, this was definitely far less smoky, dry, and yeasty tasting when I had it fresh. I was only about a month or two off from the soft spot, but hey, it still turned out fine overall. While this wasn't nearly as intense as a bottle of Vielle I had a while back, it's definitely on its way there. Need some cured dried meats for this next time, and then I'll be good to go!"

"The beer pours a cloudy golden/hay yellow with a fluffy white head that thinly coats the brew throughout drinking and leaves some sticky lacing. The nose is a quite tart with lemon/grapefruit citrusy, brett funkiness upfront followed by notes reminiscent of raw mushrooms and spicy baby arugula. The flavor is dominated by citrusy, brett funk, some grain sweetness and a tart, slightly bitter finish. It has a juicy, light-medium body, with citrus notes accenting the tart, semi-dry, bretty finish and an unexpected lingering bitterness between sips. I'm very pleased with this beer, though pricey, I've already requested more through the appropriate channels."

"O-a nice witbier, enjoyed the tart and funky quality"
"M - Medium body; somewhat creamy. Moderate carbonation."
"What's not to love, all about the Brett, complex, yet amazingly drinkable and oh so refreshing. Wish I could get this by the six pack because I would totally session it all day. A really nice take on the witbier style."

"Bottle marked Batch 3. Poured into a weisse vase, the beer is a pale, hazy, almost opaque, lemon yellow coloring with a sparse, wispy, filmy surface coat of head. Steady carbonation flow throughout the body of the beer. Aromas of tangy cherry, citrus, and tart/sour notes. Subtle, but what is there on the nose smells solid. Flavors are very tart forward, with a toasted grain backbone. Cherry, tart and sweet, with lemon grass, blood orange, and lemon highlights. The tart character is solid throughout, and transitions to an astringent, dry character into the aftertaste, losing much of the fruity notes but gaining some more grain and green characteristics. The body is slightly effervesced on the palate to an almost sharp feel at the end. Very crisp, tart finish that dries and cleans your taste buds, readying for more. This is Brett to the letter, and it is a tasty brew."

"absolutely outstanding. crooked stave just owns this style of beer right now. even better than the spring version, this pours a less cloudy than anticipated pale yellow color with a lively white head over an inch tall but fading pretty fast. the nose is really bretty, sour too, and more well hopped than I remember the other one being. its got a defined citrus aroma, but I cant pick out an orange type specifically. musty wheat malt base. the flavor matches the nose, but is way more sour than it smells. acidity is somehow tempered by the wheat malt, which is nice, makes it a very drinkable beer. bretty funk all the way through, and the citrus is really prominent. a superior quality beer in every way, special stuff here. soft feel but super carbonated, an odd combination, its delicate and robust at the same time. I would drink this every single day if I could."

"M - milky smooth, minimal carb but very drinkable"
""
"Lemony yellow body with a light white head. Limited nose with some lemony tartness. This beer did not taste like a witbier. The brett is certainly highlighted but is taken over by the surprising acidity. I didn't get the blood orange anywhere or really even the brett funk that I expected. It wasn't bad, but this beer did not deliver on any of the notes I was hoping for."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light mouthfeel with high carbonation, and as I mentioned above, dry. Overall it combines for a nice mouthfeel. Very drinkable and sessionable; does not drink to its ABV, seems more in the 4.5% range. Overall a light and drinkable beer that has a solid amount of flavor as well. Nothing mind blowing, but it still leaves me with a good impression especially taking style into consideration. Pumped Crooked Stave started distro to California. I look forward to trying the other seasonal varietals of this beer."

"o - Overall a pretty good beer. I loved the nose as it was full of brett and oranges/citrus, while the taste had more spice to it. A good beer I'd definitely have again, though if I'm paying CS prices for their beers I'd prefer Hop Savant to this."

"Pours a murky yellow with a foamy white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, fruit, yeast, and Brett aromas. Taste is much the same with chalk and Brett flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of Brett bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that smells very nice but the chalk-like flavor I am getting is a bit odd."

"O: The orange addition is most prevelant in the nose, but the flavor is all those wonderfull sour Brett notes. An easy drinking sour with some great characteristics of the witbier coming through."
""
"This is the first 100% Brettanomyces fermented witbier I have ever had. Being 100% brettanomyces fermented, you would think that this beer would be overtly funky and musty, but that isn't the case here. While there is a strong Brettanomyces funkiness, it is mostly tropical in nature. The one fault that I do find in this beer is the use of blood oranges; they really leave an unpleasant, unwavering bitterness, not unlike if you were chewing on the rind. Besides the use of this seasonal citrus, the beer definitely is a winner."
""

"Pastel light yellow in color. Forms a smallish creamy white head, but what does form is quite stable and long lasting. No lacing. Aroma is Brett dominant. Tart Lemon, dust, and a light bit of funk. Taste is similar. Tart lemon, but not sour. Some light horse blanket and a slight chalky note. Maybe a little spice, but its faint. Almost like an old lemonade. Light mouthfeel. Lighter carbonation. Tart. A very nice beer, but surprisingly restrained Brett character."
"O- I really enjoyed this beer, the blood orange come out nicely in the aroma very fresh and not artificial. The Brett gives it a refreshing tartness. Wish I had easy access to this stuff."

"It's hard to believe I would think any sour beer could use a bit more subtlety, but this one could really benefit. It's very tart, but the wrong kind of sour. All up front, not well integrated with other flavors, a bit harsh and bitter like a pill. Like biting into the ""walls"" of a grapefruit. A 100% Brett Wit sounds like a winner in my opinion but perhaps the addition of the citrus didn't work so well. An intense and unique beer, but tough to drink and well overpriced."
""

"I'm really hoping that I got a bad bottle. Everyone on here can't be wrong about this. This beer was the first drain-pour I have ever had. Tasted like smoke and dirt, nothing more. Very disappointing. I would love to try it again because, like I said...I must have gotten a bad bottle. Has this happened to anyone else out there?"
""
"Great beer. Simple but wonderfully done."
""
""
"Overall- An excellent beer, one of my favorites. Unfortunately, this brewery releases very small batches and each one is different from the last. This makes each one interesting and dear. If you're looking for a first time sour this is a good choice being on the lighter side of sour. It probably won't win any awards for mouth numbing complexity but does well with its balance and funks it up enough to be interesting. Something I'd drink daily if I could get it."
""
""
"Overall - I can't wait to drink my other one and hopefully make a trip out to Denver to see this place in person. Great beer!"

"Sampled with a good friend that managed to get several from this brewery. The aroma hints at wit but the flavor goes well beyond. Very creative. The Brett adds both funky and tart aspects making this a rich and complex beer while still remaining very drinkable. I wish I had a regular supply from these guys."
""
""
""
"O: This was more of a Saison than a Witbier, but I'll take it."
""
"The beer is hazy and light orange with a small white head. The aroma is nice, offering citrus, brettanomyces, coriander, floral hops, farmhouse yeast. Enticing. Tart and sour. Light and refreshing, citrus and brett blend beautifully. Lingering saison yeast and tangy citrus. A delicious beer. Glad to have more of this one."
"O: Refreshing, easy drinking, yummy funk."
""
""
""
"Overall - Crooked Stave has elevated this witbier beyond its station in the beer world. Impressive."
""
"O: very impressive - the brett and tart citric components made this unlike the other witbiers I've had, reminding me of a farmhouse ale more than anything else"
""
""
""

"Bottle Batch 2, 2013. Pours a hazy yellow with one finger white fluffy head. Amazing Brett aroma with definite oranges and spice. Flavor is big and bold tart lemon with an orange sweetness on the back end that lingers with the tart. Very dry, lots of carbonation. Light body. This is an incredible summer brew, which I hope will be readily available next year here in Florida. Need to get my hands on the other seasons now."
""
""
""
"O: A great beer and would drink this more often and would recommend to friends if more readily available. I will defiantly buy this when ever possible. Crooked Stave is easily one of my new fav breweries. Hail Brettanomyces!"
"O - A tart yet slightly funky witbier from Crooked Stave that is definitely different from your normal witbier with its tart and funky presence. Refreshing and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty nice and damn refreshing overall. The nose is a lot better than the taste unfortunately, but it still gets the job done."
"Overall: As good as this beer is, I wish I liked it more but I found that the strong flavors clashed a bit on my palate"
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, good. Lots of citrus, lots of brett. A very odd 'witbier', but a good beer."

"O- this is my first brew from Crooked Stave and it did not disappoint, perfect for a warm summer evening, would reccomend"
""
"O - Again, one of the best saisons I've enjoyed to date. So well balanced and enjoyable in every component. True to style."
""
""
"T: Opens with a huge dose of brett. Some bready malt and a good amount of citrus linger behind. Blood orange rind, underripe green grapes and bread crust all in there. Finish brings some lingering oak and bretty funk. Liking this a lot and I definitely hope to see it a lot more."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This was a great saison and easily better then the majority of the saisons out there. My only two complaints is that the earthy brett dominated the citrus taste of the beer a little bit too much and the finish was a little bit too dry, both very minor flaws in my opinion. This was a fantastic saison regardless from a brewery that is becoming one of my favorites, definitely worth checking out."

"Poured into a Sante Adairius tulip - getting rustic tonight. The beer is an orangey golden color. Cloudy. Medium to small white head. Little to no lacing, bubbles burn out pretty quickly. The aroma is a big mix of wood, brett fruitiness and funk and blood orange with an interestingly musky, briny background - maybe more blood orange contribution. Blood oranges are an odd fruit for me, and I'm not a huge fan normally, but they work nicely in this beer. There's also some fresh pale malt sweetness. The taste really needs some time to warm up (I started out with it a bit too cold and the flavor was quite muted), but once it does, things open up. Nice wave of citrus tartness. Big blood orange flavor with rind and juice popping up. It starts out a deep vinous and blood orangey sweetness with some fresh, doughy grain. Then, there's an explosion of complexity, as layers of medium tannic oak, brett fruitiness, dusty farmhouse funk and tart/bitter blood oranges line up in harmony. Soft, full mouthfeel. Nice wheat body. This one crept up on me. When it was too cold, the beer seemed all washed out and mild. More and more flavor came out as the glass sat. There's a ton of excellent brett fruitiness to it - stone fruit, berries, etc. Tasty beer. My regard for Crooked Stave continues to rise."
""
""
""
"There's a lot of strategy that goes into an ale that seems so haphazard. Certain sharpness, delicate softness, and a cocoon of earthiness layers onto the palate brilliantly. Its a taste that's complex enough to discuss et nauseum or to drink with with unabashed thirst quenching relief."
"Overall: pretty good and easily drinkable. Not my favorite sour beer, of the sour beers I've had, but certainly good."
""
""
"O - Tart, citrus with a nice farmhouse impact."
""
""
""
""

"Pours a pale yellow color with a thin head that retains really well. The nose is musty, funky, mushrooms with faint tanginess from the blood oranges. The taste starts off with sweet lemon flavors that move on to a softer Brett taste - funky, bready cheddar cheese and mushrooms. These fade to a slightly sour, more bitter blood orange flavor. A bit of bitter hops rounds it off. Mouth is full and smooth. Overall, thi is a nice barrel aged Brett beer. Lots of subtle flavors thateldbtogether to form a complex, yet not overpowering Saison. Good stuff!"
""
""
""
"Nice snappy dryness on the end along with some tartness. Just shy of bready. Very easy drinking"

"Taste is tart citrus with loads of funk. The blood oranges really shine in the finish but its dominated by super tart lemony flavor. Dry and crisp...Wow this is just amazing."
