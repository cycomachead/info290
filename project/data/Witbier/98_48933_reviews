"This is a great refreshing Witbier. Lightly flavored Orange , with a delicious aftertaste. Very similar to Shock Top original, but without the sweetness. Highly recommend this beer"
"Perfect for after a hike!"
"Tastes like a giant banana jammed into a wheat beer! By far one of my go to beers when I can't have an IPA."

"A nice Belgian White, nothing special but still a good buy."

"Very good Witbeer. Doesn't need an orange slice in it to have that perfect taste. Noticeably orangey and sweet without going over the top. Delicious."

"Really light. Has a citrus and floral taste. Delicious."

"like yellow pee in color, you can see the carbonation bubbles constantly going to the top. hints of orange when smelling it.  Too light in flavor to me. Like drinking a carbonated apple juice."
"A very good beer, not quite outstanding but very enjoyable."

"This is one of the best Belgian style wit beers I've sampled.  It has all the hints of coriander and orange that other wit beers have (similar to Hoegaarden) and what I enjoyed the most about this beer is how crisp the flavor and pleasing the after-taste. This is one smooth drink. Will definitely have some more."

"O- A very nice take on the classic Belgian Witbier.  Very nice for spring through late summer, very refreshing and very easy to drink.  By far and away one of the better ""summer beers"" for the money. (3.62)"

"Harpoon's ""UFO White"" is a top notch Brew through and through,of course if you are not a fan of the style,you will probably hate it..[Derp!] anyway,I myself love this amazing Witbier,a very snappy bitter Orange flavor,and nice Wheat backbone with an almost Champagne like Carbonation ~Love it!"

"Reminds me of blue moon but with added bitterness. Hazy with a white head. Looks like a witbier. Smell is heavy on the bitter orange and plenty of coriander. Flavor is Strong on the citrus flavor. Aftertaste needs to be cleaner. Otherwise ok but definitely room for improvement. A below average Belgian wit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy yellow - like grapefruit juice - with a thin white head. Served way too cold but allowing it to warm didn't awaken the brew as I'd hoped. There's a nice bready, biscuit thing going on and the brew is quite pleasant. There's nothing off-putting but nothing noteworthy either. First Harpoon brew I've had in some time - just as mediocre as the others I've tried."

"O -It's spring time in New England so I figured I'd give this another go. I was able to discern a couple new flavors, specifically the bubblegum and grassiness. It's drinkable, but not terribly enjoyable for me. Best consumed cold and quickly. Note: edited from last year. My score for this increased a bit."

"Tastes mild and approachable as a session beer or a beginner's craft beer, with plenty of orange citrus and a kiss of spice around the edges. And while this seems to lack the complexity and depth of a typical German hefeweizen, it's still a tasty and enjoyable wheat beer that should appeal to just about anyone."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 10/15/2013. Pours very hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, orange peel, coriander, wheat, bread, herbal, light clove, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, yeast, and spice notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, orange peel, coriander, wheat, bread, herbal, light clove, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, orange peel, coriander, herbal, wheat, bread, light clove, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbontion and body; with a slightly creamy, smooth, and bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected for 4.8%. Overall this is a nice and pleasant witbier. Good balance and robustness of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

""
""

"M: I feel the carbonation is well-balanced. The carbonation gives you the crisp and refreshing feeling while not overpowering the multiple flavors in the beer. Even when warm, the beer is delicious."

"O - Pleasantly suprised with this beer. Again, Witbier's aren't really my style, but I enjoyed this beer. Like the smooth combo of malt and wheat, and the cirtusy falvor was natural tasting and not overly sweet. Not a beer I'd buy on it's own, but I'll certainly enjoy the other one from the Harpoon Winter variety pack."

"Perhaps I was just bummed that the DFH 90 was off, but this wasn't too enjoyable. Paired okay with the smoky wings I ordered. Incidentally, Smokey Bomes ""craft beer"" menu left a lot to be desired. Blue Moon, Leinenkugels, low end Goose Island, Shock Top, and Sam Adams."

"Slightly orange/lime aroma. Poured Hazy lemon-yellow body, fizzy whiteish head. Head dissipated immediately, no lace. Slightly sour, mostly orange flavor to it. Makes the mouth pucker a bit! Not bad overall. A good enough choice on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured out of the bottle into a pint glass. Appearance is a hazy straw gold, with a limited white head. There's a great citrus taste with some mild malt. The mouthfeel and carbonation area bit much. The smell was a bit light, but you definitely got the orange. Nice for summer."

"This beer is crisp and clean for hot summer days in the back 40, but the mouth feel in particular leaves something to be desired. Usually with witbier, the taste is refreshing and then lingers with that dry clean finish. This had the refresh, but each sip didn't excite me to come back to the next."
""
""
""
"This is a do not buy again for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: As some have said, it would be unfair and unreasonable to expect this to be on par with some of the other, much more expensive wit's available out there. In fact the only two other commercially-available wits that I would prefer to this are limited to 4-packs usually priced upwards of $10. That being said, the very fact that such a decent, refreshing wit can be found in cans for under $15 is fantastic. And, quite frankly, if you're looking for an above-average warm-weather beer that beats your average ""summer ale", UFO White is a fantastic option."
""
""
""
"It's an alternative to big-box light beers - ideal for the summer. In that regard, it's a great beer."
""
""
""
"O - Just a solid beer, and likely an underrated one at that."

"Poured into a Sam Adams glass, developed a nice full head which laced very well and had good retention. Appearance was cloudy and yellow to straw in color. Aroma was very stong of citrus, orange in particular, with notes of banana. Taste was of a mild citrus, more orange / lemon, with hints of spice. Mouthfeel was light with a mild, citrus aftertaste."
""
""
"I will definitely buy again - very good beer for a gathering to let people try."

"The flavor lands closer to the mild side of Wits. This would be an easy introduction into the wheat world. The flavor mimics the smell. Full bodied with elevated carbonation."
""
""
""
"overall: differently better than the regular coronas you find out there on a late saturday night but I wouldn't recommend this beer to a friend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A fairly decent wit. A little more bitter and sour then most, which I actually like, and with the slightly chewier body it makes for a quite nice drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very nice citrusy wit."
""
""
"Overall: Going into this beer I was possibly expecting something a little more flavor. Bread-like hops and some decent light zest sort of made this a passable brew, but seems to be masking the fact that there are so many more beers in this category that are totally better. Not bad though for its price. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Had to cut it with an oatmeal stout so as to not waste the 3/4 bottle what is undrinkable"
"Overall - More of a dessert beer to have with something like cheesecake, vanilla bean ice cream, banana creme pie, or dark chocolate. Does not stand alone very well."
""
""
""
""
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was cloudy as expected and I expected to not like it. HOWEVER, the smell of vanilla wafted close to my nose bringing me in. One person said it smelled like baby powder? Fair head was seen at first then gone fast, no lacing at all either. Taste was good with a citrus taste something in the orange family I guess. I would drink this beer again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Less fruity flavored than most belgian whites. This one was kind of dry, but still very drinkable. It had a nice pale orange, white color and smelled of freshly ground orange pulps. The head was thick and creamy and had a beautiful appearance. The smell and appearance of the beer were much better than the taste because it was a little dry, but overall it is a decent beer."
""
""
"One of the lowest scored beers I have had in a very long time. I feel like someone removed 75% of the beer from my bottle, added water and re-capped it. The flavors are not off or terrible it just tastes like bucket of water. This watery feel kills the flavor and mouthfeel. I could think of so many Witbiers I would buy before this one. I was never a huge fan of the style but this gives me an ENORMOUS appreciation for the others I have reviewed."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I like this witbier and would recommend that witbier drinkers try it too."

"O: Not the most complex wit, but it has the usual fruity yeast and coriander in there to make it good. Would be a good easy summer drinker"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"i like this maybe best of all the ufo beers ive had to date. it pours a hazy bright yellow color with a tall white foamy head with decent retention. the nose is zesty like orange peel, peppery yeast, and more hops that i am used to for the genre. the taste is really fruity, lots of orange peel and juice to this, a little sweet, but the hops tame that perfectly. feel is awesome, really snappy and crisp, light in body for an unfiltered beer, and a ton of carbonation. again i see this more as a summer drink than a winter one, but it found its way into the winter box. i really enjoyed this though, and it makes me want to try the other ufo beers."
""
""
"Overall: This isn't something I would ever seek out, but if it was in a pack, or given to me, or the best thing around, I would be more than glad to drink it. A pretty standard witbier without too much going on. Definitely would appreciate it more during late Spring or Summer."

"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a pint glass. It was the first hefeweizen i've had so didn't know quite what to expect. Always been a fan of wheat beers and citrus beers like Shock Top. It had a nice orange color and fair sized head that faided quickly. The taste wasn't quite what I expected but surprisingly refreshing, a nice citrus aroma and taste. Not heavy, and would go great at a barbecue or grill out."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange with a thin white head that fades fast. Smell is mostly orange peel and coriander, with some other subtle spice notes in there as well. The taste is bigger than the smell, starts strong with the orange and moves into a nice spice blend, very strong but not overwhelming. The orange peel comes on again in the aftertaste, a sweetness sticks around throughout the beer. The mouthfeel is has a lot of carbonation and is spicy, but light and crisp as well. Overall a refreshing beer, nice flavor, the sweetness could get old, but nice beer that I could drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very easy to drink and tasty beer. Not the greatest witbier out there but one of the best that's readily available."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a pretty good brew.. I would enjoy it more if the spices were a little less mild."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Not too shabby. Probably not something I'd buy again, but I can see how other could enjoy this beer, especially during thew summer months."
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a light unfiltered yellow color ale with a large foamy head with average retention and some light lacing. Aroma of light cloves and coriander is refreshing. Taste is a mix between some coriander with light orange peel notes and some wheat malt. Body is somewhat fuller then average with good carbonation. A bit short of the spices but easily drinkable."
"Overall, surprised by the strength and sweetness of the flavor. A good intro to this brewery's capabilities."
""
""
""
"Draft poured into a shaker. Was a hazy-gold/orangish color with a bright white head and some lacing. Smelled of citrus fruit especially orange, bread, and peppery and spiced. Definitely tasted orange sweetness; citrusy and spiced. Finished a little dry, but on the hot day that I had it, it was perfect! A definite repeat order."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability is good on this beer. A lot of nice tastes, nothing overbearing, very nice beer in the summer heat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A great session wheat beer here that has some spice and complexity that adds to the drinkabilty and interest here. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"O = I kept coming to the conclusion that this was more of a summer ale than a true witbier. But if you're in the mood for a summer ale, this one ain't bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very impressive brew here. Everything you'd expect from a witbier (sans the tart) as all parts are represented and none over power the others. Everything balances and flows into each other. Nice refreshing summer witbier right here, i'd def be interested in trying on tap or buying a case for a summer gathering."
"O- I always expect more from Harpoon and wind up being underwhelmed (100 Barrel Series aside perhaps). Fine to drink and more complex than, say, Blue Moon but just didn't hit the spot for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a decent beer, nothing spectacular nothing bad. I'll be able to finish the six pack but maybe would only seek this again on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
"A pretty good and enjoyable wit, easily sessionable and quite thirst quenching on a warm day. I bought a sixer of these and will enjoy every last one of them."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is extremely easy to drink and is definitely a sessionable beer, though one best enjoyed on a hot day. This beer is extremely refreshing. I will definitely have another one of these this summer and super happy that it is now available in cans."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours cloudy yellow with a white head that barely clings to the side of the glass. Slightly bready, citric aroma. Tastes like... well I mentioned the bread and citrus. Medium mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Seems like a sort of two-dimensional beer, but they are two very tasty flavors. Overall, a nice refreshing drinkable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The UFO White provides even better flavor than a Blue Moon. It is great with a slice of orange or just by itself. It has again that fuity flavor as you would expect with a Wit. It has a nice white head with a clear yellow body. This is something that I have really enjoyed to drink in the summer time and goes great with things like a peach cobbler or apple pie."
""
""
""
""
"Very refreshing orangy taste. Perfect for the summer. Quite easy to down a few of these while hanging outside on the deck. Also a good entry level beer for those just getting into craft beer - I could serve this at a cookout and everyone would be happy."
""
""
""
""
"This isn't a bad beer. It gets points for drinkability. With such a big citrus character one may confuse this for breakfast beer. For the style it lacks complexity and that hint of spice that I find desirable in a Wit. I won't seek this out again, but I wouldn't refuse it either."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a nice little witbier that is a bit more interesting than many American takes on the style. I do have to knock off points, though, as the head retention and lacing were both pretty pathetic and the smell was a bit too spice heavy for my liking. Still, this is a very good wit and is well worth checking out if you get the ooportunity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A good wheat beer that mainly tastes of wheat with very little citrus undertones. It's a good session beer, though, and I'd like to try it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"From the tap, the beer was a dark hazy yellow color with a wispy head. Lots of lemony character coming from this one, and necessarily in a good way. The citrus is out of whack and bulges into an unpleasant acidic sourness. This beer needs some tweaking to bring it up to snuff."
""
""
""
"Wheat beer isn't my thing but this turned out to be allright. I got it in a mixed 6 pack from a well-meaning friend that knows I'm into craft beer. I'll not be buying any but if I were doing yard work or otherwise baking in the sun, I'd not turn one down. It's crisp, smooth and rather refreshing. "
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium to light mouthfeel and a dry finish. A good witbier overall; would be very enjoyable on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass long-neck bottle with a pry-off crown, served a standard Pilsener glass."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty much just like Blue Moon...it has that sweet creamsicle take on a wheat beer. Really not much going on other than that but I'd take this over most macro lagers any day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pale, light yellow with a slight bright white head. Goes quickly. Aroma of mostly wheat, a hint of spiciness and orange peel. Pronounced wheat flavor, hint of toasty bread malt, light coriander lemony spice and a kick of orange. Subtle flavor, but pretty well done. Finishes dry, but smooth overall. Definitely a very drinkable beer and a tasty sessionable offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not a bad brew but not much going on here. Carbonation is a little high. Nice wheat flavor, easy to drink but no strong flavors making this white stand out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured in a weisse vase from a bottle, the beer is an unfiltered, almost opaque, pale, cream-yellow coloring with a foamy, light, frothy, big bubbled, white head that settles out to about an inch. Aromas of banana, cloves, nutmeg, and roasty/toasty characters all over the nose in a good, flavorful blend. The beer's palate is an interesting blend, as well, with the spices and banana characteristics, but also a quick highlight of citrus throughout. The roasted quality comes through once again, with an effervescent ending to the profile. The afteraste is surprisingly light despite the flavorful nose and palate, with only a hint of the fruit and spice blending. The beer was fairly light bodied, but smooth and creamy throughout. The finish is clean and crisp, making this an extremely easy beer to drink."
"Just another gross example of an american wit. Huge rotten vegatel coriander flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The beer is easy to drink and has some refreshing properties."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Like I said, it's pleasant, but boring. Not horrible, but I wouldn't drink it again unless it's really hot out...and it's definitely not that right now. Completely meh."
""
""
"Overall: Really not a bad beer at all, about on par with Blue Moon IMO. I prefer it to the regular Harpoon UFO, and I greatly appreciate when I see this on tap when I end up at macro-dominated Boston bars. Not worth seeking out, but don't hesitate to order it on tap when options are limited."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is a bit harsh because it is over-carbonated. But that's what makes it ""refreshing"" and a great session beer. In fact, I'm going to bring this to Thanksgiving dinner. It will be a good way to introduce the Bud drinkers to good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not the most authentic or well-crafted and refreshing American wit I've had, but the UFO White does pack enough flavor to keep me occupied and also keeps me from reaching for any fruit to add to it. Sessionable and a better option than Shock Top for sure."
"UFO White is very close to an American Wheat with just enough wit bier characteristics in the mix. The Ale is easy drinking and thirst quenching. UFO White is a little on the bland side when compare to the better wit biers."
"A cloudy straw yellow in color, tones of Oranges dominate the flavor.Nice finger and a half of head after the initial pour,dwindled down to a good 1/4 inch at the last gulp.I must say this had a very flat taste despite the bottle date of 2/15/12. Perhaps a bad batch? I am willing to try it again though. Certainly not a typical white/wit bier."
"O: a nice brew, great for a hot summer day (even though right now it's a cold fall day) refreshing and nicely drinkable"
"O: A very sessionable beer. Mine went down in a few minutes. Good stuff."
"The Rest: Medium bodied but lacking in some of the more fruity characteristics that I prefer in wits, this is none the less a decent beer."
"This brew poured out as a hazy yellow color with a nice fluffy white head on top. The lacing wasn't too bad here. The smell of the beer has some light grains on the nose and a pretty hefty amount of orange citrus on the nose. The taste of the beer was pretty refreshing, would be very nice on a summer day. The mouthfeel is smooth and sliky. The drinkability of this is really good in my opinion. Overall this beer is quite nice I think."
"Pours a sunny orange/ yellow color with a fluffy white head. The smell is dominated by orange peel and cream, almost like a dreamcicle, there is just a little spice in the background, maybe a hint of clove and that's about it. It tastes of wheat and more orange peel and lemon, it's very citrusy. The beer has a medium body with lots of carbonation and a dry finish. This is an ok wit, the orange peel pretty much over powered everything else though."
"O – Not bad, but not great. A touch too acidic."
"A good beer for summer. A very loose rendition of a witbier, but not bad at all."
"M. Very mild and easy going. A little watery to start off with, but honestly not in a bad way if you can believe that. Light bodied, I could drink these all day, especially on a muggy one like this. Quite refreshing."
"Poured a massive 4"" white head. Hazy lemon yellow color body. Very slight smell of citrus peel and spice. Equally light taste of the same, yet still quite watery. I'm being honest when I say this strikes me as not much more than a BMC version of this kind of beer. It might have an edge over something like Blue Moon but not much else."
"An extremely carbonated hazy yellow. A large amount of big bubbly head. A lot of yeast character up front. Coriander and clove spice. A biting wheat aroma. Sweet and bitter upfront with the coriander yeast notes popping through followed by some tangy orange/lemon wheat. A peppery hop finish that is crisp and slightly sour on the palette. Goes down smooth and refreshing but after a couple the finish starts to scratch at the back of my throat."
"An easy drinker, that stays very true to style"
"The smell was very grassy, lemony, and a touch of yeast. The taste was very nice: Citrus up front, hay, biscuit, yeast and a touch of cilantro. This is a very clean and refreshing beer...I see summer BBQ written all over this one, and quite frankly this would be a great intro to craft beer."
"Nice and refreshing. Easy to drink, but not the greatest Witbier I've ever had."
"Nothing mind-boggling, but a solid effort. The folks at Harpoon aren't running a skunkworks project with this wit, but it's still mighty nice on a hot, humid day. Bring a few down to Pier 53 at midnight if you want to know the truth..."
"O - It almost feels like a cross between your typical American white with a slight Belgian touch, particularly the spiciness. A perfectly refreshing beer that doesn't sacrifice flavor for drinkablity."
"Overall- A very solid beer that I love in the summer. I avoid it for the most part of the year, but this was the right day for it... Hot, Humid, and a good mid day beer on a lazy afternoon. This beer is not winning any awards that I would be offering other than when you want a simple, enjoyable beer, this is a good one."
"Overall, I really liked it. I ordered a second one!"
"D - Very drinkable. Light and refreshing, but the citrus flavor keeps it from being empty. Also makes for a better finish."
"Overall I really liked this beer. More so than the UFO pale ale. May go back and throw a few in a six pack but at the time it was a flavorful light drinking beer."
"D - Although not overwhelming by any stretch, a few of these could be had on a hot summer day with no complaint from me."
"Drinkability - I could have two or three of these in a row and not get tired of it or want something different."
"very easy to drink, i could see this going down super easy on a hot summer day playing some frisbee golf. overall, the citrus is a bit artificial, but its easy to get past. wouldnt search this out in a hurry, but i could see coming across a six pack in the far future that would seem a good choice."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied, spritzy, crisp, and dry."
"Mouthfeel is light body, medium carbonation. Fairly nice. Overall easy to drink though I don't love the flavor which is what beer drinking is all about to me at least."
"D- Kind of hard to get used to at first but i plan on buying this beer again for sure!"
"D--This beer has a super high drinkability due to its low alcohol content and light body. I could see myself drinking a few of these in a sitting, but the carbonation is going to get to me after a while for sure."
"D-Under 5% abv, rather drinkable the carbonation may get to you though after a few."
"This is a fairly standard Witbier. Pours a very light hazy golden with a white head. The strong flavors of coriander are proninant as is with most wheat beers. I complimented it with orange, which works well as I suspected. I have come to not expect too much from wheat beers and this isn't any particular exception to that, they all taste very similar. I probably won't seek this one out."
"12oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint. Best by 03/15/11 indicated on the bottle. Pours a pale, semi-hazy, yellow with a loose, quarter inch, off-white head that quickly dissipates into a broken skim and a thin tight band around the edges. No lacing presents during the sitting. Nose reveals coriander and a trace of lemon zest, but for the most part is somewhat subdued. Taste is fairly bland - while the nose is fairly mild, the flavor profile is somewhat watery and only expresses a suggestion of the citrus and coriander identified in the nose. Mouthfeel is light in body with an effervescent carbonation. While the drinkability isn't bad, it lacks a bit of the character I've come to appreciate in the style. All and all, a fairly lackluster Witbier"
"Drinkability: This beer has a lot of American Wheat character with just a dash of wit tossed in; rather dull compared to the better examples of the style"
"Overall, an ok, unoffensive wheat beer"
"Drinkability- good possibilty of me having more."
"Taste is again quite lemony with the coriander and standard wit yeast. Mouthfeel is pretty creamy and thick. Quite an easy drinkin. Beer but not that tasty."
"This one is probably worth a try if you are big on witbiers. It's mellow, yet flavorful. Still, I wouldn't really recommend it over anything else; not that noteworthy."
"Served in a tulip glass. Pours a really murky light golden color with a pretty hefty white head and some good lacing. The nose is a bit of light wheat and orange plus some lemon. The taste brings more orange, lemon, wheat, and a bit of grain. Pretty plain, but it works. Nice light body and some good drinkability. A good hot-weather brew."
"It's pretty easy to drink, a little rambunctious on artificial taste IMO. But an easy summer drinker."
"Cloudy blonde with cornsilk highlights when backlit and a fluffy bone colored head that leaves some filmy lace on the glass. Wheat malt and citrus zest with coriander in the aroma. Wheat malt tang with orange peel, coriander and bubble gum flavors. Medium-light bodied with effervescent carbonation. Well balanced flavors and refreshment make this beer an easy drinker."
"Really enjoyed the UFO White, nice nose as well as taste. Though some other reviews noted too much orange, I tasted more lemon, citrus flavors. Yes it is murky, nice color like unfiltered honey. A good summer on the deck beer, refreshing and not over filling."
"D- This is a great tasting beer. ABV is low enough that I could drink this all night long! Very impressed with this beer. Harpoon you made a fantastic beer with this witbier."
"I tried very hard to like this beer considering I spent about $13 on a six-pack of it. The more I tried it, however, the more convinced I became that not only that it just wasn't for me, but I couldn't find much of a comparison to most other bières blanches I've had. A poor take on the style, I'd argue. I I'll take a Hoegaarden or La Trappe instead, thank you very much."
"pours a hazy yellow with a one finger head that disappeared in a matter of seconds and no lace to speak of. smell was ok with a faint fresh orange aroma. good balance of wheat and orange very similar to a blue moon. mouthfeel is light and medium carbonation fit well with the beer. a little high priced but cold on a hot day it fits the bill."
"D - Moderate sessionability"
"Oh I could definitely have a night of these. A tasty beer through and through that you should use to celebrate the arrival of our overlord masters. The truth is out there."
"D- Very good drink ability with this beer, could drink this for an entire session with pleasure."
"D: Decent beer for the style. As with beers of this style it is a bit too sweet. Well worth a try."
"Try Magic Hat's Circus boy--slightly different kind of beer, if you like UFO white. UFO Hefeweizen is not to be missed, it's hard to go wrong with Harpoon."
"D - Nice balance and an assertive crispness that make this beer very refreshing. Very sessionable and worthy of having another."
"D: The drinkability of this beer is its forte. This is a beer that I don't mind buying a six pack of and keeping in my fridge for any time of the day."
"a proper wit with a powerful orange. a nice cloudy yellow. almost too excessive orange. a very one dimensional quality of fruit that doesn't have a crispness of herb. no corriander really. not a clean finish but something bit creamy and cereal finish. a lot of cereal... smooth and not grainy. no protein in the finish."
"Overall, one of he better from these guys. perfect summer beer. Nice complexity and mixed spices. Worth a try if looking for a cheaper wit."
"the drinkability is pretty good. it's spotlessly clean and it's pretty refreshing. that being said, it leans in the direction of somewhat bland. not a bad beer though, it could just use a little more substance."
"Drinkability is high, in that the zesty carbonation cuts through the malted wheat."
"Still, it's a refreshing beer and a good example of style."
"UFO White has a nice, soft feel to it and even has a mild creaminess to it. It lacks a gripping yeast presence and is a touch overboard on the orange. Coriander is right on and the wheat tang is strong. A little above average for a wit, but is certainly my favorite UFO from Harpoon I have had. Easy drinker, but there are a few other wits I would grab before this one."
"D - Good drinkablity for the fullness of flavor from this beer."
"Drinkability: A pretty solid white that made for very ideal, very appealing for drinking during the dog days of summer."
"D: The carbonation might slow you down a little bit, other than that this would be a great beer for a cook out. This is a year-round beer but I could not see myself buying this in the winter."
"Picture on the bottle shows it served with a slice of orange. Please don't do this, it has plenty of orange as it is."
"Cloudy gold with a short, fine white cap. Decent head retention, a bit of lace. Crackery wheat aroma with a bit of citrus zest. Malty flavour, light wheat sourness, orange zest, slightly spicy finish. A bit dry, light bodied, moderate carbonation. Pretty good, easy drinking."
"Very drinkable though, much like a Blue Moon."
"D - A somewhat mediocre wit, but it is light, crisp, and refreshing, and isn't this what people look for in a wit anyway? Could drink a few of these on a hot day."
"After having the UFO Hefe I was happy to pick up this six pack (as it was also on sale for the week!!!) and give it a try. Glad I did. Just a refreshing as the Hefe and just as enjoyable. I look forward to finishing this six pack (especially as the afternoons warm up)."
"Wow, this one was a pretty good surprise. I really enjoyed it, I did have a feeling it was going to have a decent citrus feel. nice light feel, smooth beer, overall this is one of the better white beers I have had in a while. Will have another when I go back to Texas"
"Overall a good, solid ale that could be enjoyed anytime but would work very, very well on a warm summer day. Would do this one again,"
"D: A very easy drinking and likeable wit. Tart, tangy, crisp and clean. By all means 6 pack worthy making for a perfect picnic beer that is easily sessionable. Sure to quench the thirst and satisfy."
"T & M - I don't know what this is. I have trouble detecting flavor in wheat beers. I get the banana but its more mild in this than other wheat beers. There is mildly lemony note in the finish. Mouthfeel is pleasing and creamy. This beer seems a tick past medium bodied and the flavor is solid - nothing thin or watery about this."
"D: This definitely hit the spot, refreshing, and not too fruity. Can enjoy a couple with the low ABV. Probably the best under Harpoon's ""UFO"" series."
"Cheers!"
"D- Not a great Wit but a not half bad brew. This would be nice on a warm weather day. A definite step up on Blue Moon."
"D-very drinkable and refreshing. I would drink this again but with some reservations. Something about this beer reminds me of Zima."
"Pours a hazy golden straw color with a large white head. The aroma is what you would expect, coriander and orange peel. The flavor is mainly coriander with some orange in there as well. The finish is spicy coriander. This is not bad, but is a little heavy on the coriander resulting in an unbalanced overall flavor. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Medium-light body. Tingly, prickly on the tongue. Crisp and refreshing. Not exciting, but very drinkable."
"I thought the mint and lime character was interesting, but not enough to carry this beer. I wouldn't pour this out, and if I bought a six I would finish it, but I don't think I'll ever get it again. I'll stick with hoegaarden next time, but to be honest I would even choose Blue Moon over this."
"It's a decent brew. Not something I'd go out of my way to get, but if you like witbier styles, it may be one for you."
"Poor, especially in comparison to the Wolaver's wit I tried for the first time 3 days ago--there's a good wit. This is poorer than Blue Moon."
"A basic wit - easy enough to drink and ""refreshing""."
"Going down easy, this beer is just the right about the right ammount of smooth drinking and light mouthfeel that it makes for a really good session beer and a better Hefeziezen. A really enjoyable beer."
"This is a simple, delicious, easy-drinking, very wet summer beer that will quench your thirst due to the 4.8% abv and 10 IBUs. This is superior to the very similar Long Trail Belgian White ale. A very nicely done American version of the witbier. HIGHLY recommended (in the heat of the summer)."
"Clean crisp lemony aroma. Extremely refreshing and drinkable brew, light tangy-lemony taste and very mild spice, no grassy coriander and no banana hefe-weizen notes--this is the most pure and delicious expression of an American-style witbier. Fairly simple but fairly perfect, I keep coming back to it over other wheat beers in the fridge. Well done."
"Personally: A very ""light"" wit beer, I would choose this over a Corona any day."
"Poured a hazy very light pale straw color. Aroma is strong w/ coriander & orange peel. Maybe my palate was off, because this sample follwed an IPA and Summer beer, but it basically tasted like fizzy lemon seltzer water to me. Thin, weak, and highly carbonated. I guess its easy to drink, but severely lacking in flavor. I would rather drink a PBR over this any day of the week."
"poured into a pint,hazy golden with a massive white head that is in it to win it.nose is tart and slightly sour and citrusy.taste is citrusy,somewhat tart,with bready malt characteristics,slightly lemony,and yeasty.moderate body and carbonation + a nice balance gives this beer high drinkablity.my dad would probably like this beer."
"Overall, this is my favorite UFO that Harpoon brews. Its a good solid beer that is smooth, easy drinking, and has a solid amount of flavor."
"D: Quite drinkable, goes down nicely on a hot Texas summer day. Still, Harpoon's offerings in DFW besides the Leviathan series have left me somewhat underwhelmed."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle marked 09/15/09-095. Sampled on August 8, 2009. It pours a hazy pale yellow with a thin white head. It looks the part minus the sediment. The aroma exhibits a combination of wheat, malts, and something slightly fruity. The mouthfeel is about medium and enticing. The aroma has a bit of spicy corianders with a hoppy aftertaste. Harpoon did a pretty nice job on the traditional witbier recipe."
"Overall, this is a very decent white ale and one to pay the extra dollar or two if you are reaching for Blue Moon. Refreshing and light, a great summer beer."
"Smells and tastes like orange juice, coriander and buttery Harpoon house yeast. Breakfast beer anyone? Creamy mouthfeel. Simpler and gentler than most wits, it's no comparison to the Allagash Whites of the world but enjoyable in it's own right."
"Drinkability: A very good witbeir that is incredibly true to style. Very easy to drink and very refreshing. All the flavors are mild and work together very well. Definitely a great summer beer to just kick back and relax."
"Verdict: UFO White is perhaps a more floral take on the Witbier than most, but still a solid enough brew that's perfect for Summer."
"This beer pours a nice, hazy straw yellow color with a thick one finger of white sticky head to it. Head retention is pretty good leaving ample sticky lacing on the glass. Nose is full of spices - pepper, clove and corriander, wheats, and nice softer orange hint. Taste is of wheat upfront, making way to a generous though balanced amount of orange zest, touch albeit mild of lemon, with a nice finish of clove and corriander. Lighter bodied, medium carbonation, slight creamy up front but becomes crisp and finishes dry. This is a fantastic summer beer with very good drinkability."
"This is a nice solid witbier from harpoon."
" ""white"" can be a great, flavorful style especially when the yeast cancarry it's own!"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not filling at all, mild kick, good representation of style, although there are better Witbiers out there but it's still a decent beer to drink for long time."
"Poured from a brown bottle into a weizen glass. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smells of lemon and orange. Taste is crisp and very flavorfull. Citrus and malt, quite delicious. Medium bodied in mouth and very drinkable. This is a quality brew."
"Overall it's very easy to drink, but the orange flavors started to get to me after a while. I'd say it's a pretty decent beer, just not spectacular."
"Off the tap at the brewing co in Windsor, VT this beer was a cloudy, lemon-yellow color. The two-finger head was white, the retention good and the lacing in curtains. The aroma was of orange, citrus hops, coriander, floral hops and pale malt. Bright and well-balanced. The flavors were good; orange and hints of citrus peel, coriander, a touch of lemon and pale malt. Like the aroma it was balanced but it was also crisp and dry. The mouthfeel was watery but smooth, the body light and the carbonation light/medium. Though heavy on the citrus notes (the added flavor showed) and a little slick it was a good example of a witbier and very summery."
"12 oz brown bottle obtained at Hannaford's Supermarkey Derry, NH. pours a light straw color with an inch of off white head that dissipated under a minute, sadly. Scents of lemon and orange zest fill the nose with a malty, tangy sweetness to it. Can taste the lemon at first but quickly subsides and the tastes of orange zest with a pithy quality to it along with a biscuity taste in the finish. moderate carbonation. reasonably good beer for the price you pay."
"Harpoon is all about these UFO's.. every time I go to the store I see a new flavor.. guess they take a stab at a witbier here. Pours a murky golden color, nice head at first which quickly dissipates.. not much lacing to be seen. Somewhat light body to it and highly carbonated, really jumps around on the tongue. Get some nice fruitiness to it, and has a nice sweetness... nice and clean/balanced finish. Not too shabby.. certainly a tasty beer that goes down easy, and I liked it better than the other UFOs."
"12oz bottle obtained at the local Hannaford. Pours a murky light yellow body (after yeast was swirled in) with a short-lived half inch of off-white head. Smells like orange, lemon zest, coriander, pith... Tastes fruity, with orange, pith, lemon zest, a grape or apple like quality? Spice/coriander and a slight hint of maltiness also are present. Light-bodied with moderate to low carbonation. Very drinkable. Pleasant, balanced, and very quaffable. A fairly solid white."
"Pours a slightly hazed yellow orange color with a small white head and rapid rising carbonation. Lemon flesh, citrus hard candy sweetness, mint leaves, herbal tea, and yeasty wheat in the nose. Every bright on the mouth, tingly and attention getting. Very easy to drink, flavorful enough, this certainly doesnt need any added fruit as the label suggests. Good beer, although not my favorite in style, it becomes a bit sticky and cottony on the tongue after a couple of sips. With that said, this is a welcomed addition to the Harpoon line up and dare i say this is the best ive had in the UFO series."
"D) A Witbier - not much of a stand out. Average, with no wow, or intrigue."
"D - Pretty drinkable. If I had bought more than a single I'd probably have a few. Good summer beer."
"This beer is exactly what I have come to expect from Harpoon's regular offerings(excluding the Leviathan and 100 Barrel series). A good quality beer that I can really enjoy. A lot of breweries are good at making big beers but just can't make multiple session brews to enjoy on a normal basis. Thumbs up Harpoon."
"The beer pours a cloudy gold color with a 1/2"" white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has your standard wheat and pilsner malt scent along with an above average orange peel and coriander aroma. It's not as crisp and refreshing as some. Maybe, it has a bit more pilsner malt. The taste is decent as well. It's a good drinking beer, but it falls a bit flat in it's complexity. It's not as spiced as it should be and the yeast doesn't provide enough esters for that really tart fruit taste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a solid witbier, but I feel it could be better. All in all, a worthy brew."
"GC"
"Very drinkable. Great summer beer. Consume. Repeat."
"D..Easy to drink, especially on a warm day. Not the best Harpoon in my opinion, but since it's very easy to drink, this would make a suitable summer session beer."
"Pours a light straw color, hazy and cloudy. Neat little puffy head but not a lot in the way of lacing. Smell was very disappointing, not much at all save a sniff of pale wheat. Taste... pedestrian. Like a standard, average wit. Big emphasis on wheaty flavours, a hint of spicing, but not much. It was pretty light, and light in body, which leads to a bit of watteryness. Decent drinkability though, it should for something so light. Not much to say here. Mediocre all the way through, and you can do better."
"Appropriately orange in color and hazy in appearance. Poured a frothy white head that quickly disappeared. Subtle aroma, taste is light with obvious orange flavor. Highly carbonated makes it feel a bit thin. A good summer brew to enjoy on a hot day. Considering the lower ABV, can spend an evening drinking this beer."
"Drinkability is pretty poor go and seek something with some balance and some redeeming qualities not digging this brew at all."
"While Harpoon's version is missing the tart plum fruitiness seen in most Witbiers it makes up for that with balance and drinkability which is what the style is about."
"The feel is fizzy like a bubbly champagne (more champagne!). Creamy and not at all watery. An unusual wit, not unlike Brian Regan. A terrific American version of the style."
"D: Very drinkable. Low abv will make this a summer favorite. I like this one a lot."
"Pours a light golden with a thin white head. Good retention and very nice laceing. Aroma is floral with hints of fruit and spice body is light and crisp with a good amount of carbonation. Taste is of citrus and spice. Very well balanced and refreshing. Excellent for this Summer."
"Not bad but I don't think i'd be searching it out again"
"Overall a light beer thats easy to drink but a bit too sour on the back end for my taste. I'd go for something else in the Witbier category if given the choice."
"I will be drinking this beer again and would recommend it to others."
"Quite drinkable despite my criticisms, it's just not up to par with their retired 100 Barrel Series version or Allagash White."
"Picked up a sixer at Walsh's in Brighton Center for about $10. Poured into UFO hefe glasses with a wedge of orange. Cloudy yellow color. Huge white head that lasted for some time. Smell was a nice bouquet of spices (coriander, orange peel). Taste was very refreshing but subtle. Great flavors of a witbier, but with a hint of citrus. The added orange aided that flavor. The flavor, though, was a bit on the muted side. It was there, but not very pronounced. Very smooth on the palate, and easy to drink. A good session beer, or end of the night brew. I can't help but drink this beer and just think it's just a version of the UFO that was tweaked a bit. Either way, if it's going to be the new Harpoon brew, then I welcome it. At least it's better than the UFO Raspberry."
"The taste is not pronounced one way or another. It is a light witbier, very refreshing and drinkable. It has the coriander, lemon, citrus, some rind flavors, some light floral bouquets, some dryness in the finish. The beer is a tad too light for me, but it is a very respectable representation of the style."
"Not bad. More drinkable than their standard UFO. Not the greatest example but certainly very drinkable and would make a great summer beer."
"This will be a great summer beer. Super drinkible. I will be keeping some in the fridge for the warm months ahead."
"This beer will soon be the front runner for atleast the Harpoon UFO style."
"Drinkability- Harpoon should have much success with this one. Clearly the best of the UFO beers by a mile, and I would suspect not just good to the typical BeerAdvocate. I'll go out on a limb and say that this will soon be Harpoon's best selling beer."
