4.18,10.3,4.25,4.25,4,4.5,4.25,"1st time trying from the variety pack.  Did not catch the citrus taste as much as the coriander and chamomile but overall this is a very good beer.  The label says best served at 48 degrees.  I poured this at 52 degrees and this difference was of no significance to me.","atypicalmaverick","Thursday at 09:18 PM"

4.25,12.1,4,4,4.25,4.5,4.5,"Great Lakes Holy Moses brewed by Great Lakes Brewing Co., with an ABV of 5.4%  This brew pours out a cloudy amber color, with a nice white head. This is an unfiltered brew you can not see though it. Holy Moses has the look of most Witbier brews on the market.  The smell is sweet with citrus ,some grains, and malts. Now for the taste, it is sweet with some spices and malts. There is also a nice citrus flavor in the taste. Holy Moses has a lot going on in it. The mouthfeel of Holy Moses is rich smooth and clean.  There is nothing overpowering in this brew, it has a nice balance to it. Overall I'm giving Great Lakes Holy Moses a 4.5 out of 5. I would buy this brew again.  Thank You Great Lakes Brewing Co.","nicholas2121","Thursday at 04:09 PM"
4.25,12.1,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"      Overall, I'll give Great Lakes Holy Moses - Great Lakes Brewing Co. a  4.25. This came as part of the spring variety packs, and as far as I'm aware as of this review, this is the only way to acquire this choice brew besides going to the brewery itself. Pick this up in the sampler& part the waves of bland witbiers.","Caveworm","Apr 01, 2015"

Taste is light, fruity, and sweet. Not quite sure if this is really my thing, its very different from what I usually drink. It reminds me an awful lot of Trois Pistoles, and at such a lower price, might be called it's cheaper relative. Doesn't quite have the same depth, and is more lightly carbonated. Very drinkable, its well balanced, but in closing, not quite my thing.","srv33","Jun 25, 2012"

Nose brings a good dosage of wheat plus some light citrus and spice. Flavor has a bit too much spice and doesn't showcase the malt and citrus character enough. Light body with crisp carbonation and a dry bit of coriander in the finish. Pretty good brew from Great Lakes.","Thorpe429","Jul 17, 2011"

Scent is of lightly musty dried grain, moderate amounts of white bread and peppery spice and very faint notes of lemongrass. Taste folows scent, pale dried and lightly musty grain, white-breadyness, firm black pepper and only a faint presence of lemon rind, somewhat bitter finish and only lightly sweet. Medium bodied and creamy, like many other beers from this great brewery, somewhat dry finnish to this one. A wheat beer with a very mild approach to sweetness and citrus, letting the grains and yeast to do most of the talking.","rfgetz","Jul 16, 2011"

There was not one distinctive taste that jumped out at me, but the overall spiciness was too much. It felt smooth in my mouth and throat, but the aftertaste was not refreshing. I would never drink this again.","TuffNut87","Jul 09, 2011"
2.99,-21.1,4.5,3,2.5,4,3,"Overall I thought this was an average Witbier. It was ok but not great and I feel like that is because of the heavy amount of spices in the beer, a little spice can go a long way and it seems like there was just to many spices in this beer, it wasn't as bad as Harpoons Winter Warmer but most of the flavors in the beer got drowned out by the spices. I liked the look, mouthfeel and drinkability the most about this beer. I liked the large amount of spices in this beer the least. I don't think I would buy this beer again, there are many other widely available Witbier's that have better balance. If you are a die hard Witbier fan and like your beers heavily spiced then you might want to give this a try but I wouldn't put that much effort into it. I can't say this beer is as solid as the rest of their lineup and it could use some tweaking, so far this has been my least favorite brew from them. As far as Witbiers go I wouldn't turn it down if I was offered one but I feel like Blue Moons Grand Cru was better and more balanced making that still my favorite Witbier to date.","StoutHunter","Jul 03, 2011"

Pale yet bright straw yellow colored liquid, considerable amount of bubbles whirling around as well as fine particulate matter, certainly plays the part visually. Unusually thick and dewy nose, lemon to orange juice and reduction, coriander and cinnamon spice, croissant dough and fresh yeast, lemongrass and violets, apricot, peach and some banana fruit, the chamomile semi-muted. Medium-bodied plus, feels fluffy and very expansive, the carbonation helping it fill the mouth entirely. The clove, coriander, cumin to black pepper spice gives it verve and here the lemon, orange citrus drier and with more zing. There is a bitterness in the grassy element, more pronounced as it warms. Yeast, pie dough, honey comes through, finishes sweeter with elevating apricot, peach, apple fruit. The flavors are deep if not especially complex, what makes the beer is the alternation of textures, very tactilely engaging.","farrago","May 31, 2011"

The taste starts out with a biscuit like taste that quickly follows with some citrus, and orange peel. After that the spices and coriander takes over and finishes off with a nice bread taste. The mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and has some bite to it thanks to the spices. Holy Moses, this has got to be perhaps the best witbier I have tried and the taste is much more balanced than some other ones that either had too much spiciness or too much citrus in it.

Although advertised to have a big floral aroma, generally the aromas were faint - wheat, sweet citrus and a very faint hint of coriander. Creamy smooth feel with very refreshing carbonation. A few different flavors are present, but none of them dominate. Sweet wheat malt beginning followed by light citrus/banana flavor and a light spicy/coriander finish. Very smooth and well balanced. I'm a rookie to this style so don't have much for comparison. Expected more spice, but appreciated it wasn't overspiced...which is my experience with pumpkin ales.

The smell is of orange peel, coriander, wheat, banana, clove, and cracked pepper. A slight yeastiness is also perceptibly trying to squeeze through from beneath, but to only partial avail. The taste is very similar, though the grains and spices are more separated than public facilities following Plessey v Ferguson (too soon?). The first wave consists of the wheat and orange peel; the second of coriander, cardamom, pepper, clove, and even a strange hint of salt. The banana is only mildly there, as though he's got somehwere better to be, constantly looking at his watch and tweeting the time away while everyone else has the time of their lives. Some people, y'know? The body is decidedly medium, with an active carbonation that comes in briefly but strongly in a sudden burst of effervescence.

Light, clean orange and grains of paradise aroma with a little pepperiness to it. Very German flavor to it for a Belgian style, especially with the big frothy head. Reminds me of sitting at bars during the summer in berlin. Extrordinarily dry base for the spices with a crisp finish. A little clove like yeast flavor like a hefe. Pretty complex but not overly delicious. Mouthfeel is very smooth from the wheat and a nice level of carbonation. Since it's so light you can drink a lot of it but I'm still looking for a little more flavor like you find in a good hefeweizen or Belgian wit.

The nose is subtle orange, and on the palate the first impression is the lively carbonation bite, followed immediately by orange spiced with coriander, but with an appreciable hop bitterness.

Powerful carbonation and some really great lacing as well. In the glass this beer almost looks like honey. The aroma is thick with coriander and citrus fruits, I also picked up some bitterness from the aroma. I let the head die down before I took my first sip. This beer feels crisp and pleasant. Overall good citrus flavors complimented by spices. The first one I had on its own, and my second one had a slice of fresh lemon. Both ways were good but the lemon really added to the overall flavor.

However, the BJCP guidelines seem to confirm my general thoughts: that this beer is too bitter and lacks the sweet citrus notes generally associated with Witbier. I fear that an American Witbier--a neutered, more Pils-like version of a Witbier--is developing just as the boring American Hefeweizen developed here in the States. Holy Moses is a good beer on its own, but it lacks the uniqueness that generally leads me to choose a Wit over a pale lager.","Windigstadt","Jan 29, 2008"

The only detracting feature is its lack of staying power. It seems to fade just a bit quicker than it should. Feel is good. Overall though there is a biting edge that detracts from things I have to say. And also it seems to lack a balance that would make it easier to drink.

Two fingers of white foam top off the pint glass, but the head isn't as durable as one might suspect from first glance. The smell and flavor are a wonderful amalgam of fruit and spice, with banana, grapefruit, and orange co-mingling with ginger, coriander, and a dash of pepper.

The citrus comes through towards the end with the bitter bite. This one is a different witbier but still comes through with the usual characteristics. The mouthfeel is medium/light with a decent balance and good carbonation.

Smooth, creamy mouthfeel with larger carbonation fizz midway through the swill. Prominent spice level coriander is pretty zesty and even a little hot. Interesting chamomile addition gives it some pungent earthy herbal tea character. Notes of bitter hops, citric lemon, and underlying dryness rounds out the taste nicely. The finish is earthy and dry with notes that are floral, perfumy and a little oily on the palate. Pretty bold characters here, not shy on flavors.

I was able to pour a good head without any trouble and I noticed that I missed some of the yeast in the bottle. The smell is nice and even, but to be honest my sense of smell is still in training so I couldn't pick out any details. The taste is smooth but a little crisp, probably from the citrus.

Medicinal phenolics in the nose, with a load of coriander and citrus. Wheat and phenol flavor upfront, followed by a zesty blend of mild citrus, herbal chamomile, and faint coriander. The spices are overdone but fade, and the phenols hang on too long in the aftertaste. The carbonation is low, and the body is thin, but it gets some texture from the wheat and yeast making it smooth if not a little too tart. The phenols dry the finish and the wheat/yeast become slightly chalky effecting drinkability- but I would still consider it an above average warm-weather beer.","PBRstreetgang","Aug 03, 2005"

I'm certainly not a connoisseur of witbiers--in fact, I've tried very few--but I get the impression that the fruity and spiced flavors are supposed to take prominence over the maltiness.

There is even a hint of hops near the finish, helping this witbier to stand out in a crowd. Mouthfeel is light and malty smooth, slightly dry.

Lightly perfumy in the aroma, my guess is that it is the chamomile. Other typical witbier aromas of unmalted wheat, coriander and orange zest are evident. Lightly sweet, spritzy and a good witbier. The chamomile definitely shows up it the taste with a light tea-like feel. Very flowery. Hop bite is light, but present. A friend brought me back a few beers after touring the brewery and he told me they serve it with an orange wedge in the tasting room. I think it's a mighty fine example of a witbier without it.

4.51,19,5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"What a good day, when you go down the liquor store a day like today in our country's drinking culture known for piss beer and lime wedged filled clear bottles there is nothing more refreshing than walking by everyone else with a six pack of Great Lakes Holy Moses. At the beginning of the pour a crystal clear gold but this is followed by the swirl of the bottle to get all of the yeast from the bottom in order to place the haze and transform the appearance into a beautiful sunrise on a slightly hazy morning. The massive foaming head glistens as I attempt my first sniff at the aroma. Wonderful hints of clove and the yeasty citrusy zest with coriander and other spices going on. When I sipped on this fine summer day treat I was welcomed with much of the same flavors and the bite of the wheat malt and a hint of vanilla like smoothness. Wow this beer ties it all together so nicely the musty yeast producing such great tones along with all of the spices added this beer deserves so much credit in the world of wits. Mouthfeel light and fluffy but syrupy in the finish just sticks to my taste buds I love it. Wow drinkability, well I'll have another what a great treat for anyday just a well constructed beers and if your aren't into wheats try this one out it may just sway how you feel about them.","WVbeergeek","0"
4.51,19,5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Served with a thick white head that rises above the top of the glass like a giant cloud atop a misty yellow mountain. The aroma is dominated by bananna and clove notes, but there is also a nice yeast component that lends a fresh bread note, like manna from heaven. The taste is light and fruity. Coriander spice, with a creamy bready note as well. Light apple and bananna fruits on the tongue. Decent bitterness on the finish lingers a bit on the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is robust and creamy, which when matched to the fine carbonation leads to excellent drinakbility and a tremendous sense of refreshment. After searching for nearly two years for this beer, I can say it is nearly a religious experience. Another world class beer from GLBC.","aaronh","Apr 20, 2003"
4.6,21.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Well, this beer is finally back in a bottle for non Ohioians and less traveled Ohioians. It poured a cloudy yellow color and formed a huge foamy white head, no doubt due to the heavy carbonation present. The lace latticed the glass as the white clouds vanished and evaporated. I tickled my senses with an aroma of malt and hops with a delicate hint of spices, but not banging you over the head like some other wits do. Coriander was noticible, but my recovering sinuses dealing with the crazy Ohio spring failed to descern the other ones present. The flavor was of hops and spices with a finish that had a tangy feel to reflecting the spices and carbonation. Another fine Great Lakes beer.","Wildman","Apr 18, 2003"
4.15,9.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Had on tap at D's...Luminous golden color with a thin bright white head. Zesty, malty, and delicate spicy aromas fill the nose. Taste is much the same, but malts and lemony-like zesty dominate any spicy elements. Smooth and medium bodied. Drinkability was there...Interesting and not one-sided like other wits can be. This is yet another quality offering from GLBC.","allboutbierge","Apr 11, 2003"
4.8,26.6,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"This is one excellent beer, pours a goldish yellow hue with a white head. Smells of wheat malt, coriander, and yeasty spices. This stuff tastes just as good as it smells. Refreshing spiciness mixed with wheaty maltiness. I'd recommend this to anybody who has a chance to try it.","jtw5877","Apr 06, 2003"
4.45,17.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability: One of the best beers I've had in a long time. Quite surprising given my loyalty to the hops. I only with that this was available in bottles to take back to VA with me.","OldFrothingSlosh","Beers"
