I was only about a month or two off from the soft spot, but hey, it still turned out fine overall. While this wasn't nearly as intense as a bottle of Vielle I had a while back, it's definitely on its way there.

The nose is a quite tart with lemon/grapefruit citrusy, brett funkiness upfront followed by notes reminiscent of raw mushrooms and spicy baby arugula. The flavor is dominated by citrusy, brett funk, some grain sweetness and a tart, slightly bitter finish. It has a juicy, light-medium body, with citrus notes accenting the tart, semi-dry, bretty finish and an unexpected lingering bitterness between sips. I'm very pleased with this beer, though pricey, I've already requested more through the appropriate channels.","ThePorterSorter","Jan 09, 2014"

4.18,2,4,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Bottle marked Batch 3. Poured into a weisse vase, the beer is a pale, hazy, almost opaque, lemon yellow coloring with a sparse, wispy, filmy surface coat of head. Steady carbonation flow throughout the body of the beer. Aromas of tangy cherry, citrus, and tart/sour notes. Subtle, but what is there on the nose smells solid. Flavors are very tart forward, with a toasted grain backbone. Cherry, tart and sweet, with lemon grass, blood orange, and lemon highlights. The tart character is solid throughout, and transitions to an astringent, dry character into the aftertaste, losing much of the fruity notes but gaining some more grain and green characteristics. The body is slightly effervesced on the palate to an almost sharp feel at the end. Very crisp, tart finish that dries and cleans your taste buds, readying for more. This is Brett to the letter, and it is a tasty brew.","GarthDanielson","Dec 06, 2013"

I would drink this every single day if I could.","StonedTrippin","Beers"

Smell is of malt, grain, fruit, yeast, and Brett aromas. Taste is much the same with chalk and Brett flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of Brett bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

While there is a strong Brettanomyces funkiness, it is mostly tropical in nature. The one fault that I do find in this beer is the use of blood oranges; they really leave an unpleasant, unwavering bitterness, not unlike if you were chewing on the rind. Besides the use of this seasonal citrus, the beer definitely is a winner.","flayedandskinned","Sep 28, 2013"

Blood orange rind, underripe green grapes and bread crust all in there. Finish brings some lingering oak and bretty funk.

4.16,1.5,3.75,4.5,4,4,4.25,"O- This was a great saison and easily better then the majority of the saisons out there. My only two complaints is that the earthy brett dominated the citrus taste of the beer a little bit too much and the finish was a little bit too dry, both very minor flaws in my opinion. This was a fantastic saison regardless from a brewery that is becoming one of my favorites, definitely worth checking out.","jaasen64","Aug 05, 2013"

4.11,0.2,3.75,4,4.25,4.25,4,"Poured into a Sante Adairius tulip - getting rustic tonight. The beer is an orangey golden color. Cloudy. Medium to small white head. Little to no lacing, bubbles burn out pretty quickly. The aroma is a big mix of wood, brett fruitiness and funk and blood orange with an interestingly musky, briny background - maybe more blood orange contribution. Blood oranges are an odd fruit for me, and I'm not a huge fan normally, but they work nicely in this beer. There's also some fresh pale malt sweetness. The taste really needs some time to warm up (I started out with it a bit too cold and the flavor was quite muted), but once it does, things open up. Nice wave of citrus tartness. Big blood orange flavor with rind and juice popping up. It starts out a deep vinous and blood orangey sweetness with some fresh, doughy grain. Then, there's an explosion of complexity, as layers of medium tannic oak, brett fruitiness, dusty farmhouse funk and tart/bitter blood oranges line up in harmony. Soft, full mouthfeel. Nice wheat body. This one crept up on me. When it was too cold, the beer seemed all washed out and mild. More and more flavor came out as the glass sat. There's a ton of excellent brett fruitiness to it - stone fruit, berries, etc. Tasty beer. My regard for Crooked Stave continues to rise.","popery","Aug 02, 2013"

Certain sharpness, delicate softness, and a cocoon of earthiness layers onto the palate brilliantly.

The taste starts off with sweet lemon flavors that move on to a softer Brett taste - funky, bready cheddar cheese and mushrooms. These fade to a slightly sour, more bitter blood orange flavor. A bit of bitter hops rounds it off. Mouth is full and smooth. Overall, thi is a nice barrel aged Brett beer. Lots of subtle flavors thateldbtogether to form a complex, yet not overpowering Saison.
