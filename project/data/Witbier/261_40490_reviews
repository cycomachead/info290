"Appearance: Hazy straw like the sun trying to burn its way through an early morning fog. The head is surprisingly thin for a wit. Smell: Perfumey and spicy, citrus, white bread, traces of banana and wheat. Taste: Spicy, ginger, orange, wheat, hint of banana. Mouthfeel: Medium body and slightly above medium carbonation."
"O - Impressive nose, decent taste, interesting wit.  Taste and feel both seem rather light--seems like a good summer brew."

"Terrible Terrible terrible terrible lousy"
""
"Pours a deep yellow with a white head. Very citrusy aroma and taste. Light feel and taste."
""
""
"Pours a very hazy yellow color with a nice off white head that trails the glass. The smell is full of all spice and orange peel. The taste was very refreshing with a lemon peel in the beginning with the malt and spice coming in on the finish. Very interesting and tasty beer."
"poured from a 12 ounce bottle"

"Can into tulip thanks to Cisco rep at Beachwood BBQ Seal Beach who just happened to be eating at the same time I was. Light yellow with thin white head. Aroma is coriander, clove, citrus zest, wheat malt. Flavor is similar with earthy bitter undertones. Spice notes are very strong. Finish is crisp and dry. Light bodied and thin feeling with moderate carbonation. Not something I’d go back to."
""
""
"Overall: Nice little number from Cisco. Yet another beer I'd hand to Blue Moon Guy and be like, ""Guy, try this instead."""
""
"I found this beer to very watery and for the most part, tasteless. The body is very thin and spices and hops hardly make a showing."
"Served at a tasting. Just underwhelming overall"
""
""
"Really, it looks ok and smells ok. Taste was terrible. Ended up dumping it. Just this weird tingy zip on the tongue."

"Excellent and very different. I remember asking the server about it and she said, ""I haven't tried it but someone else said it tasted like soap."". I'll take one!!! Pleasantly suprized and wound up having 2."

"this is hopelessly underrated. that, or the recipe has changed a lot over time, because this is a wonderful belgian wit, funky as heck, almost saison, even a touch of brett almost in the yeast profile, which makes the beer. but lemongrass and lemon verbena radiate in the nose and the taste too. faint copper hue to this pale yellow brew, head is short lived, but my pint glass might be a little greasy. the flavor is great, bright wheat malt base, and a fantastic herbal character, both hoppy and grassy and botanical like. its super carbonated, huge bubbles explode on the tongue, and the finish is about as dry as you can get. im not sure what more people were looking for in this, maybe body? its really light, so easy down as to be easier to drink than water on a hot day. the low abv makes this okay though, or at least it does for me. the infinite session beer, flavorful and dynamic, expressive and well crafted. cisco has always impressed me. everything i taste from them reaffirms my admiration for them, this is very unique as wits go and positively delicious."

"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a yellow/whiteish color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of spices, some lemons. Taste is tart up front, lemons, wheat, some spice, but not as much as the smell would have indicated. Refreshing but somewhat mild. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer."

"Taste-Wheat,in-the-background spiciness. Very subtle flavors, but very refreshing and easy-drinking. A pleasant warm weather brew to be sure."
""
""
""
""
"A little more citrus than I prefer, but a refreshing, easy drinking beer. Becomes floral late. Kinda flat."
""
""
""
""
"It's got a little more spritz than crispness, but it does have a nice running dryness with a spicy bite on the tongue, and it's fairly smooth as well."
""
"O - Interesting combination of the herbal tea, lemon, and the fruity citrus. The aroma is quite nice that leads into a bit underwhelming taste, but still a nice beer. Very zesty and refreshing. I would enjoy this beer more if the spices and fruit were a bit more powerful."

"I liked it; I'm glad I tired it. But, I regret that I got an entire six-pack. Just to say it again, POUR THIS ONE INTO A GLASS!"

"O: This is not a bad witbier, but it is a bit unbalanced and one-dimensional. There are definitely better out there, but this one should not be entirely avoided."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A beautiful pale pour with a small fizzy head and cloudy body. Great lacing. Aroma is clean with notes of hay, celery and magnolia seed (Lemon Pledge). Some graininess and Belgian funk from the yeast. Mouthfeel is light and somewhat tart. Flavor is quite malty with grain being the most predominant. Floral hops finish clean. It's a very nice beer. Refreshing and complex."
""
""
""
"Overall this is an interesting and funky Wit that has a lot of merits."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Definitely not a favorite in the Belgian Wit category. The sourness of the beer was unpleasant and seemed to put the beer half way on the path to a Berliner Weisse. Sourness has a place, just not in Witbier."
""
""
""
"There some uniqueness to Grey Lady- Its a more savory taste with exotic spice combinations to give the beer an identity. However, I wish that it remained breadier and creamier later in the session before falling apart."
""
"Light golden pour with just a touch of haze. Massive head with a lacing that retains very well. Light nose of coriander, Belgian yeast and a sweet fruity spiciness with lemon notes. Very light medium bodied with an attempt to be slick over a normal level of carbonation. The flavor profile is a bit weak, but nice. It begins with a blend of light spice that progresses to light coriander. In the middle, the citric lemon and wheat characteristics are evident. The finish is crisp with lingering notes of spice and citrus. A nice offering for a hot day session. A bit more body and flavor intensity would make this one outstanding."
""
""
""
""
"O: Where many witbiers can be understated in their complexity, this one is brash and bold with its flavor additions. It certainly makes it stand out from the pack. An excellent beach beer on a sunny summer day."
""
""
""
"As beers go, I'm sure this one is appealing to many. But for my own personal tastes, this one is not for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky light yellow with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is very mild with some malt, spice, and slight citrus aromas. Taste is much the same with lemon zest, spice, and tea flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that has some interesting flavors and a fairly subdued aroma until the beer warms up."
""
"Just not a good beer at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very light yellow in color, almost like lemonade. The smell is of citrus and coriander or allspice. A light white head but it feels very bubbly on the tongue. Refreshing with a slight spiciness. A really nice Belgian White. I'll definitely enjoy drinking the rest of the samples in my Beer of the Month Club."
""
""
"Overall - I really like this beer; obviously a wit beer; a sophisticated blend of spices; very light on the palate; a beer meant for mass consumption on a hot day. Very nice..."
""
""
""
"O- an above average wit in my mind, and I could drink a six of these easily. Aside from the appearance a very good beer."

"The loud Crack evinced yet another brimful CAN, this one to the point that I got a bit of a spritz. The Lady is a squirter, apparently, which does not bother me, plus she is also spicy and inviting, so I feel like a good time is upcoming. We began with an inverted Glug to measure her tolerance and I found out that she does not necessarily like being turned upside-down unexpectedly, but that she deals with it nicely. The massive three-plus fingers of dense, bone-white head looked like meringue atop a lemon pie! I was so envious because as a teenage baker, I could never get my meringue right. Man, this stuf looked like marshmallow Fluf as it began to slowly fall! Before initiating my final pour, having left about a third still in the CAN, initially, I gave her a good shake to really stir things up. No sense in leaving anything in the CAN that you might want later, right? This really stirred things up, both literally and figuratively. Man, she was as angry as the hornets nest on the day that I dang near put my hand through it while retrieving a frisbee! She was swatting me with her tail and threatening to conk me with the bottle in her left hand. Color was a hazy sunshine-yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4) with some floaties in evidence. I lifted her towards me and inhaled deeply, taking in her spicy, clove-like perfume. She smelled like my first lover, an older patchouli-wearing hippie following a Grateful Dead concert on City Island in Harrisburg, PA in June 1983, shortly before I left for boot camp. She smiled at my recollection and threw her arms around me, allowing and enabling me to uncouple her seashell bra, which I kept as a souvenir (Don't believe me? See my Facebook picture from Iron Hill's Mahalo, Apollo! release party when I wore it in her honor). Ah, what a Lady! The mouthfeel was on the thin side, and the style usually evinces such, but the spices were just about right, said as I toss my golden locks. I agree with an earlier reviewer that it falls short of Hoegaarden, but if I wanted a Hoegaarden, then I would have purchased one, wouldn't I? That is a non sequitur, but nor have I reviewed the one that he felt was overly spiced. I CAN only tell you what I like and I liked this beer. It probably would not measure up as a Hula in the Coola Day (01 Feb, annually) beer because it is more suited to warm weather. Really. Have you ever made love in the water? Cold water sucks for that purpose. Fair winds and following seas, my Grey Lady! I'll see you in the summer."

"Overall: This is one of my favorite beers. It’s a very simple beer, extremely refreshing, good flavor, with a good mouthfeel. It may be lacking in complexity, and it certainly doesn’t exhaust the style, but it really does hit the spot. I’ll keep drinking this as long as they keep making it."
"A very creative Witbier, different from what I had tasted so far. It cannot be more refreshing, though its body could be a bit bolder."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I had this for the other day and I was quite impressed. At first there isn't very much flavor but it ends on a very nice spicy note. I would say peppery. The alcohol flavor is well masked by the spices. I was expecting it to be extremely spicy but to my pleasant surprise it was not overwhelming."
""
""
""
"This is fruity and light and so most BA people aren't gonna hype it. But it's really quite exquisitely brewed."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This brew needs a de-spicing to have any chance to go anywhere -- it has way too strong of clove character which overpowers all the other possible flavors this brew may have. The coriander is also too strong and the astringency heightens the bitterness and pithiness of the citrus notes. Not a good beer from Cisco."
""
""
""
""
"A fairly simple, but quite pleasant witbier. It isn't the most attractive beer in the world, but not too bad- straw colored with little head, but fair carbonation. The rest is pretty good. What's particularly interesting about this beer is that you don't get a big hit of orange or coriander like many wits, but what you do get is a very balanced and surprisingly floral beer, with notes of peaches (particularly in the aroma), tangerines, melon, and even a bit of the white of the watermelon, with a finish of lemon juice in water. It is a bit thin in body, but overall it's probably underrated."
""
""
"NB: This was a fairly fresh batch--less than two weeks off the line."

"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer. Pleasantly surprised by the spiciness. Maybe I've just not had enough of the style but this seems differently spiced and I commend them for it. Would gladly get again and recommend it for a nice summer day. Cheers!"
""
""
"A wonderful balance of mild semi-sweet citrus, white peppery-crusted bread, mildly tart yeast presence. This is a really flavorful little beer here. Spiced well as it doesn't burn me out. I gulped and gulped this one until I was looking through the bottom of the glass before I knew it. Perfect beer for the upcoming warm months that is both tasty and refreshing - a great combo."

"O- I was worried this one might have died a while ago since it's over six months old, but there are no signs of skunking or oxidation. It's just an overly spiced witbier. Not bad, but not great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle, poured into a Unibroue tulip. Very slightly hazy light yellow body, white head, low retention. Can't read the smudged bottle date. Minimal, clear lacing. Aroma includes lemons, clove, a touch of slight funk. I'm actually surprised that this is a wit, it smells more like a saison. Taste is also saison like, quite dry. Taste is similar to the aroma. Not perfectly to style but not a bad offering."
""
""
"Earns points for the novelty. A fun one to try, but primarily for the novelty points."
""
"T: Pretty mild taste with a touch of citrus zest. Lemongrass, faint lemon juice, a faint wheat tartness, mild green apple and some grassy hops. A mild biscuit malt backbone holds it up. Mouthfeel is definitely a bit watered down but has some tight carbonation that makes this drinkable like crazy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This isn't a bad beer, but it has its imperfections. The yeast seems to be the best part. It's fruity and offers a bubblegum note. The spices are absent save for the mild coriander. There are better Witbiers out there, but this was good once."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lighter medium body, decent carbonation, a little watery and transparent on the tongue. This isn't bad, but there's definitely more flavorful and expressive examples of the style out there."
""
""
"O: I am disappointed beyond belief, considering the premium pricing for this. The nose was nice, though. Maybe they ought to go into candle making instead of beer brewing."
"O: Only OK."
""
""
"Not their best."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice and cloudy presentation with a quickly disappearing white head with nice lingering lace. Light nose with a bit of citrus and a light spice character. This beer carries the familiar light and refreshing flavor and mouthfeel but is a little lacking on the expected complexity of a true wit."
""
"Overall pretty solid witbier, I am just not drawn to it, but I do like it and could have this again."
"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a cloudy, lemon-yellow color with a dense, foamy, white head. The nose is heavy of citrus and coriander, with some herbal highlights. Smooth, spicey palate with a lemony backbone. Coriander on the palate after you finish, with a slick finish overall. Very refreshing and easy to drink."
""
"Overall: Enjoyable, but forgettable."
""
""
""
"Strangely drinkable. The flavor is odd, different from other wits I've had. Very easily sessionable and thirst quenching in warm weather. Falls short in the flavor; not the profile but the potency. It feels a little watered down. Otherwise, quite good."
""
"O: Very easy to drink, very enjoyable, and very refreshing. This is a sessionable beer and a really good one for a hot summer day."
""
"Overall: This one is almost tasteless. It is refreshing but there is almost nothing to say about the flavor."
""
""
""
""
"D - This is a pretty standard wit, which is to say that it is lightly spicy, drinkable, and little else. Not great, but if you want something mild and inoffensive it would work."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Citrusy lemon orange zest blend, noticeable coriander in the aroma. Light and fresh impression. Taste is similar, citrusy and dry, crisp and lightly tart, dry wheaty aftertaste. Feel is slightly watery, but it's zesty and quenching. Overall enjoyable, and something i'd seek out again in sixer form. Seems tailor made for warm spring and summer afternoons."
""
"A correander taste was definetly noticable."
"O: This is one of those beers that's not bad, but doesn't quite rise above the fray."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is noticeably spicy, with a slight lemon tartness. This is a very sessionable beer that is light bodied but has plenty of complex flavors. I will keep an eye out for this. A fun spring\summer beer from Cisco."
""
"Overall: B-"
"This is the strangest beer ever, but I like to think of it as ""unique""! Even though I usually drink Barley Wines, Quadrupels and Imperial Stouts, this lighter beer is one of my favorites because it also has so much flavor. It tastes like tea (white or yellow) with lemon and a touch of honey. Doesnt taste like a beer at all, light, pale yellow grey color. Has undertones of coriander, malt, hay and caramel. Earthyness and freshness similar to French Verveine tea. It has very little body, but enough maltyness, fruityness and texture to make it interesting on the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer goes down very easily. There’s nothing really special about the taste, but it would make for a nice easy drinking beer on a hot summer day."
""
""
"Found on cask at The Cask Republic in New Haven, CT this special treat was actually a uniquely dry hopped edition featuring Centennial hops over the usual Grey Lady, and the results were quite nice. A cloudy amber color with big white bubbles on top and no lace. The nose detects a polite wheat and toffee combo covered in fruit nougat and mild citrus hop. The flavor is a bit odder with a musty, more herbal hop with orange tea and grassy edges. The hops work nicely to redefine this tried and true Blonde. It definitely grows on you as the must fades and more lemony ideas emerge. It’s medium-light bodied with typical vague carbonation. In the end it is a hit. Well done!"
""
""
"I really enjoyed this beer. I am attempting to expand my beer palate and not just stick to one style. I will definitely look out for more beer by this brewery."
"O - its a pretty good beer. good ideas in there but its just not quite executed well enough."
""
""
""
""
""
"A pretty nice witbier altogether. I would like to see some more apparent spice in the flavor with a touch less of the sour fruit, but not bad."
""
"I could definitely power through a few of these during a hot day on the beach six months from now, but, right now, it's not a great choice and I was not impressed. Go with the Whale's Tale Pale Ale or the IPA over this from Cisco; not their best."
""
""
""

"O) A great, refreshing beer. Session-able."
""

""
"over all not that impressed"
"O: Can't quite wrap my head around this one. The aroma was very interesting and inviting, only to be let down by that odd flavor. Starting to really think I got a bad bottle. I really like most of the other beers I've tried from Cisco... Will try again when it's back in stock by me and re-review if any different."
"O/D-Overall, I believe I like Witbiers more than the regular craft beer drinker. This one is good aside from the initial metallic taste. I am not extraordinarily happy with my $10 6 pack. I would not buy this ever again, but I will drink all six of these without much complaint. Aside from maybe the Woods series from Cisco, I find their beers to be underwhelming."
"o - i really liked the beer. it is a big change up from most beers i try, which are usually darker. it is extremely drinkable, and i could see myself downing a lot of these with no problem. even while reviewing the beer it has barely lasted me 10 minutes. if you are not opposed to high carbonation and strong citrus, you will like this beer!"
"O- Cheap, crisp, refreshing, and a winner. Good stuff to beat the heat."
"A better than average wit, and a good choice for a muggy Boston afternoon. Nothing remarkable, but quite drinkable and easy."
"D - Sorry Cisco, but something about this one was a bit of turn-off... Not a beer I would recommend or even welcome again in the future... Seems it should be quaffable, but given the odd mix of flavors it just isn't... This one misses the mark slightly in several areas which unfortunately combines for a large"
"Very refreshing and crisp yet with some complexity as well. Really love the cookie-like character the anise gives it."
"O - This was just way too thin for my liking. A little more body and this could be a strong offering. With that said, on a very hot summer day this could be a thirst quencher."
"O/D: It has its moments with taste, but it's rather bland, overall. The mouthfeel really killed it for me. Not a huge fan of dry beers, but this one was just odd overall."
"Picked up a single at Abe's. This beer is oddly tart, and based off the huge head, I wonder if there might be a slight infection. Aside from the too-sharp lemon character, there's a distinct wheat dough aroma and flavor. The mouthfeel is of here, but this has the makings of a nice wit."
"Overall this was a solid beer and one that’s easy to drink in the warmer months. Worth a shot."
"Hazy yellow with a large amount of carbonation. Big bubbles foam up the sides but disappear quickly. Nose is yeasty and cereal malts, grainy and bready. Flavor is pale cereal malts and creamy wheat with a big spicy hop and yeast character. Finishes with the spicy notes subdued and just a lemon zesty tingle. Average balance of wheat, yeast and hops."
"Not really a fan. I guess I can see how some people could appreciate this beer, however it didn't really workout for me. The beer itself resembled soapy, foggy mountain dew. This beer was refreshing and tastes alright on a warm day, but felt watery. Again not my favorite style of beer to begin with, but was overall disappointed. I think the appearance of the beer also ruined other aspects for me as well."
"This witbier is a honey golden color, with appreciable notes of Belgian yeast and citrus fruit complimented by spices such as coriander and ginger. There’s a trace of grassy hops on the back end, and Grey Lady is a refreshing, well balanced ale from start to finish. At 4.5% ABV, it’s a nice session beer for Summer."
"O - Really far too light to me. Not enough spicing, not enough citrus...feels rather watery."
"mouthfeel - this beer is a great summer beer. not sure if i will get more because there are cheaper summer beers that are just as nice but definitely worth a try especially if you like citrus."
"O: Refreshing and balanced. Overall, not a lot of character."
"A decent light body with good lively carbonatino. A little bit of a sticky finish. Overall, this one is unimpressive. The flavors and aromas seem a bit off. I'd say this is one that could be passed over pretty easily."
"Clear, pale gold with a soapy white cap. Decent head retention, just a couple clumps of chunky lacing. Lemony wheat aroma, citrus, crackery, spicy, pear, grassy. Low bitterness, light grassiness, less lemon than expected, doughy, mild spice. Tastes okay, but a little thin compared to the aroma. The body suffered somewhat from carbonation that was quite high initially, but felt lifeless once it (quickly) degassed. Medium bodied and off-dry. Overall it was okay, but it didn't wow me."
"Pours a quite bright lemony yellow color with huge cap of prickly, bubbly white head that lasts and lasts. Scent is quite pleasent - belgian yeasts at the front with lemon and watery fruits and spice. First sip was quite a palate shocker - tart, sour and bitter lemon rind dominate with lemon scented cleaner astringency. Whats behind it isnt much better as it tastes like musty pond water after your palate is used to the harsh tones. Body is uber light, a step above water, overly active carbonation. I don't know whats going on here, but im not a huge fan."
"A bottle, a lovely spring day, I was pretty excited. Pour had plenty of head, but that went away real fast - not an iota of lacing to be seen here. A pretty, cloudy lemon-yellow color though. Smelled first of bananas and pears, digging those esters. But the taste - I mean, of course it should be sour, and I like sour things, but there wasn't a whole lot else going on there. Definitely overpowering any subtlety on my tongue. Pleasantly carbonated and fun to drink and all - and it <i>is</i> a really nice day out - but I was a bit disappointed."
"Lemon lime soda beer, it would actually make a very nice soda, but that is the whole problem here. Too thin for any style with a flavor that is out of check. Now that I think of it, it tastes a lot like Baja Blast, an exclusive soda to Taco Bell."
"A northeast witbier eh? Hazy clouded bright yellow sunshine golden with a bright white head flowing thick. Leaves behind fine even lacing down the sides of my pint glass. First smell I can tell there's citrus peel and coriander but the yeast notes override the spice with nutty/bready notes from their house yeast. Let me try my first swig from these guys. Like a spiced citrus coriander smoothie, what's going on is there cream and chammomile in this. It tastes like I added heavy cream to herbal tea. Wow the flavor is wilded one of the heaviest citrus/spice/creamy texture wits I've ever come across it lands in the WTF segment of my palate. When you burp have people stand back it hits with citrus fury and coriander cantor from your nares and stomach. What's up with beer labels and ugly mermaids, I've seen a couple this year, think Coronado and maybe one other. Overall it's like a coriander/cream based/citrus peel smoothies as you get thru each sip each one becomes more enjoyable but as a whole from the years of drinking different witbiers this is still a WTF experience?"
"O - it's decent for what it is. If you want a wit i'd recommend you try it. Plenty of better beers but I wouldn't turn it down if I was offered it again."
"Poured a 1.5"" head. Hazy straw yellow in color. Smells mildly of citrus, spice, and malt. Taste is even milder than the smell but continues the citrus and spice. Almost like a weak herbal tea. Although I agree with last word on the side label that it's ""Quenching!"" that's easy to say when you've got just a step up from water. But hey, at least the ""Grey Lady"" wasn't actually grey."
"Pours a fluffy two finger white head. This dissipates to a thin ring of lacing only, kind of disappointing. Smells of a big belgian, La fin du monde esque. Clove, banana, more ripe fruit, pears. Tastes pepery, light crystal sweetness, some banana, clove, cinnamon maybe. Thin thin bodied, medium carbing. A touch of lingering hop bitterness. Overall this is descent, very easy drinking and refreshing. Nice smell and good taste but the body hurts this quite a bit. I will pick this up again on a hot hot summer day and drink ice cold. $1.89 a single."
"D - Very drinkable. I could drink these all night. Very sessionable and pretty consistently pleasant. This is the first beer I've tried from Cisco, who I've heard great things about, and I am excited to try more soon."
"This is not my style of beer but then again this is not my style of brewery...12 bucks for a 6 pack of local brew says it all. This beer needs to stay on that little island"
"Overall: a citrusy disappointment. I'll suffice to peel off the label and retreat the country estate in my mind."
"O - Overall, I can tell that they tried with this beer, but its nothing spectacular. Its definitely worth a shot if you're into the style, buy for a quick buy, id maybe reconcider. A one thumb up."
"Sampled on March 12, 2011. From the 22 fl. oz. bottle this pours a fairly cloudy pale yellow with practically no head but continuig carbonation. It gets cloudier as the bottle empties. The aroma is crisp with its orange and lemon citrus punch and vague spices. The body is on the thin side. The taste also has a solid lemon and orange peel zestiness with a kind of yeasty backdrop and a mild hopped ending. It was refreshing but not necessarily a go-to beer."
"Drinkability is ok. This is a mild,refreshing drink but nothing exceptional. I wouldn't seek this one out again."
"D: Drank easily, low ABV, easy finish, non-confrontational flavors. While it's easy it drink, it's not flavorful enough to have the desired ""can't put the glass down"" drinkability."
"Drinkability: This is an above average beer, simple and refreshing. This is the kind of beer that I like at a BBQ, to enjoy it and not need to think about it."
"This is described as a Belgian-style Wit, although it is definitely an Americanized version thereof. Deep straw in color, it pours with a thin head and the first sip reveals a noticeable herbal hoppy nose, perhaps indicating dry hopping. Light and spicy, there is only a faint whiff of the expected fruitiness. Instead, this is more of a spicy little pale ale with a little estery twist."
"Hoping I will be able to find this back home."
"This one was pretty tasty. I didn't taste the spices until the very end. The last sip had a subtle ginger taste to it. So far I've been happy with all the beers from Cisco that I've tried. When it said it was brewed with spices I was a little leery but the overall effect was not as offensive as it can be with some beers."
"Pretty drinkable. No complaints here."
"M/D: Light to medium bodied with decent carbonation. Just not good. Not going to finish this one, and don't normally pour beers out. I doubt it is too old since I got it in MA, but its possible."
"I assume this is not a summer seasonal since my December 6-pack was very fresh. I'll be looking for it again when warm weather returns as I thought it to be very refreshing overall."
"The feel of this beer is light and refreshing. It has a nice water like feel that is very quenching as well as being easy on the pallet. The low ABV makes this beer a great session beer and went well with the pizza I was having."
"poured a not quite clear light golden color or cloudy if you swirled in the light bottom sediment. half inch head with a very little lace. first whiff smelled of peach and mild orange. taste of wheat malt and the same fruity peach and orange but what hurt the taste was the very weak carbonation. mouth feel was light but flat that just killed the whole thing for me. also not getting that coriander or spice that should be there. this beer a pass."
"A notch above decent, & would be a good answer to a session of sweaty weed-pulling or similar labor."
"Pale yellow pour with a lot of fizz like a soda pop that quickly disapates. Lightly lemony aroma. Wonderful fruity lemony malty taste. A little lemon a little cloves and nutmeg? Smooth and refreshing, particulary on a hot day. My favorite from Cisco Brewers."
"D- Nice wit, clean, crisp and well worth a try"
"The flavor is good, but a bit over spiced for this beer's light body and puny malt presence. There's a lot of clove and cardamom, perhaps too much so, plus a hint of cinnamon. Not overly sweet, which I appreciated. Chalky yeastiness. Mouthfeel was thin and a bit watery, but at least this is a light, easy drinking beer that is also flavorful. Not bad, but not worth the price Cisco commands for its beers."
"Drinkability: A solid wit, and an interesting one - spices abound here, probably a little too intensely, but not in an unenjoyable way. This one's quite drinkable too - low in alcohol (4.5%), dry, spritzy and bright, and inviting. A few recipe tweaks would make this a true world class wit."
"D - i keep drinking these yet i dont know why, not my style. this one though was very uninspired and plain."
"Pours a hazy yellow with a lively white head. The aroma is phenolic and fruity, with apricot and ginger. The flavor is like a gingersnap - light, crisp, gingery and a little fruity, with some cinnamon. The mouthfeel is very light. Refreshing and summery."
"D: not supper high, but you can hang your hat on this for a while"
"d - A very easy to drink witbier. Some nice citrus, lemon smell and taste. Would try again."
"Overall, an interesting, lemony witbier. Not what I would expect, but definitely worth trying out. The lemon character is the stand out feature in my mind."
"Got this bottle from jdiddy in the recent Heavy Metal BIF, paired with King Diamond's ""Welcome Home"". It pours a hazy golden straw capped by a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, wheat, coriander, and lemon zest. The taste holds notes of lemon zest, cardamom, coriander, light wheat, orange peel, and a tiny stab of hoppy bitters. The body is a very light medium, with a moderate carbonation and crisp, refreshing feel. Overall, a tasty, understated wit, a very nice summer quaff. Get some!"
"D: Interesting. I drank this ""beer"" following a run, so the light and refreshing nature of the beer kind of hit the spot. But at the same time, it missed on several levels. So this wasn't bad and I would drink it again, but not really my favorite either."
"Sadly the bottle, as in many cases, does not live up to the draught. A hazy pale yellow pour with white 1/4"" inch head but sticky lace. The aroma lends to its witbier nature, with yeast. lemon and pepper. The flavor likewise offers this up in a bright, bubbly but not too thin or light-bodied way. Clean and a bit creamy, this is a lovely summer beer, and not an IPA as my buddy thought (since it was called an ale!)."
"In a pint glass this beer was a hazy pale gold color with a small white head. A pleasant citrus aroma, some fresh hay. Lemon taste, a bit of malt, then the beer just flattened out. Really blah mouthfeel, very bland. Not a very good wit. I won't be tryin this again."
"Pine-Sol color... er, i mean, somewhat dark lemonadish in color with a loose and fluffy head that was rather difficult to generate. Oranges dominate the aroma, followed by lemons and some pepper, plus some floor polish-- the lemon kind, of course. Nice stream of bubbles in the glass, too. A real battle in the taste between the oranges and the lemons. The oranges come out on top, but not in a good way. Very little evidence of yeast or any real beer flavor: this is mostly a citrus cooler. And the beer is surprisingly flat given the bubbles. It tastes more like an orange rickey than beer-- just add ice, a swimming pool, a cheap novel and a humid afternoon. Blahblah. Pass."
"It looked lively and bright, but it ended up tasting quite stale and leaving a strange aftertaste. Maybe there is something wrong with this particular bottle. All and all, a little disappointed if this is suppose to represent New England beers."
"A decent attempt but not really fulfilling a good witbier."
"Pours a cloudy yellow with little head and no lacing. Smells flowery even more than the citrus and juniper berry. Taste is very flavorful and a tad spicy. More floral notes. Definitely had the delicate characteristics of a Belgian beer. Mouthfeel is carbed and light. Very enjoyable brew."
"D - Great session beer. I am not a fan of wheat beers and this one impressed me. Great well balanced beach beer : )."
"Holds flavor well throughout. Very drinkable, solid brew."
"An interesting concept that isn't quite my style, but a very interesting new interpretation of a wit."
"This beer pours a cloudy light straw color, no head and barely any lacing to speak of. Nose is clean crisp whiffs of yeast and wheat with an ample amount of banana and clove. Taste starts smooth wheat, grains and spices (clove and corriander) fill the middle, and the finish is flavors of banana and apple. Light bodied, high carbonation, crisp feel with a nice clean finish. This is a highly sessionable summertime beer."
"There is some balance, going from sweet-ish to dry-ish. It could be tastier and creamier, but hits general outline of the style. Pouring the last of it made it murky, but didn't improve it. A decent interpretation of the style overall."
"Taste is very different than most wits, I almost get a cinnamon-sugar type flavor here. For some reason it works really well, it tastes delicious. Body is light, and the finish is pretty clean with a lingering coriander spice note. It was very easy to polish off this bomber before I even finished the review, I guess that makes it highly drinkable!"
"Pours a very clear, very pale yellow colored body, looks like a cider. Small wispy head, white in color, very quickly diminishing. Effervescent aroma once swirled, some citrus and light fruit, like pear. Some funkiness too. Some funky taste, drying. Malty sweet, with a pretty clean finish. Not very flavorful. Waiting to warm. Funky fruity flavors, not my thing."
"Poured hazy orange with a nice crown of foam. The best smelling witbier I've ever experienced - coconut, piña colada, pineapple, orange marmalade, ripe almost green banana, candy orange slices with raw sugar, lemon zest, and a bit of spice from the cardamon. Tart fruity esters with light cracker crust reminiscent of lemon meringue pie with a thinner than expected mouthfeel. I shared this amongst friends and wish I had more. Seek this out."
"Picked this up on my last trip to Boston and trekked it back home. Instantly put into my kegerator. I poured a 22oz bottle into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a dull, murky, gold with just a hint of a off white head that leaves absolutely no lacing and has very crappy head retention. This actually is one of the ugliest beers I've head the pleasure of pouring. The aroma is rather weak. Hints of lemon zest, cardamon, bready yeasts, and just a bit of ripe fruits. The flavor follows suit pretty closely. Ripe apples and pears, cardamon, biscuits, and just a slight tang used from the wheat malt. The mouthfeel is light with a bright carbonation and a bready dryness. I'm rather disappointed that I lugged this back from Boston in my pack instead of buying another bottle of DFH Squall to bring back home."
" The yeast could be more flavorful but it's a good one for summer!"
"Drinkability: so-so witbier in my opinion, as it needs a bit more pop fromn some citrus and less clove."
"Tasty wit!"
"Pours a one finger white head that vanishes leaving no lace. Cloudy amber color, quite a bit of yeast in bottom of bottle. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Slight yeasty nose. Flavor is slight lemon and yeast with some honey at finish. Good on a hot day like today (91). $7.25 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"Mouthfeel is a bit of a dud, as this one was rather flat. Thinner style and swishy in the mouth. Overall, I had no trouble downing this, and was ok with flavors presented, but the structure of the beer was off. There are better ones out there."
"Flavor starts off nicely with a spicy, herbal kick and a hint of sweetness. Green tea leaves and a decidedly citric hop burst finish the experience. Body is highly carbonated, but it compliments the light mouthfeel and adds a refreshing quality to the Wit. All in all, a solid, thirst-quenching brew that I could see myself having again, especially on a hot Austin day like today."
"Overall, an excellent wit that kept getting better as it warmed. Try this one a tad warmer than normal for a wit. My sample is half a year old so can't wait to try a fresh one later this year (I knew it was older when I traded for it. Was dying to try it even off season. Johnnnniee is amazing trader and would never send old beer to you. I requested it) to see how it varies. Highly recommend. Would be in heavy rotation if available here."
"D - A nice local attempt at the Belgian style but a long way to go. Still enjoyable to drink though."
"This is a fine American play on a Belgian Wit."
"Grey Lady takes what I love about Wits and runs with it. The nose is phenomenal and the drinkability is killer. In a world of mediocre American Wits, this one is a top-notch Belgian contender."
"Overall though I have to say I was quite impressed with this one. Easily one of the best I have had in the style as far as flavor, just needs a little work on the body and it is there. Still, very solid and something I would love to try again."
"Drinkability: Not altogether bad. Let's just leave it at that, huh?"
"Out of the bottle this one poured a pale yellow color with a chalk white head one finger thick. Displayed very nice retention and lacing. Soft nose of citrus and nutmeg with maybe, coriander? Complex flavors. Lemon zest, sweetened grapefruit like candy, generic tropical fruit in the middle followed by the dry nutmeg finish. The strong nutmeg on the generic fruit adds a pumpkin pie like quality. Medium carbonation could be smoother. But a great tasting beer and worth trying!"
"From a twenty-two ounce bottle Pours pale/white in color, slightly cloudy with a small almost head. Smells of lemons, fruit and malt. First sip is flowery. Very sweet and flowery but with a strong bitter finish. Light bodied with above average carbonation."
"Drinkability is ok, it was very light, but to sugary, making it a challenge to finish. Also, it's more of a generic Belgian pale then Wit, I'm not even sure if there are any oats, although there is some orange peel on the finish."
"I like it. Good first impression for a brewery that just barely started sending beer to VT."
"D - easy drinking and palate pleasing."
"More importantly, Cisco's Grey Lady offers something that many American versions of the witbier style don't - refinement! The nose expresses wheat malt with a hint of coriander. It's far from overly spicy, and it's certainly not tart and fruity, or even chalky with citrus rind or yeast. Rather, there's just a pleasant edge to awaken the nose in an otherwise basic beer. The body is light to medium, as it should be; and the pinpoint carbonation is delicate but effervescent enough to bristle the tongue. The flavor follows suit with the aroma, but there is a bit more fruitiness to it (mainly orange, with some minor lemon). Once again, however, it's kept to a minimum, and it acts as a part of the beer rather than its main focus. It's delicate and refreshing, with just enough residual fruit and spice left in the aftertaste to remind you that you're drinking something just a little bit more interesting than the standard fare. Worth trying. And based on personal experience, a great summer quencher!!!"
"A well crafted Wit with full flavors. Not as light and refreshing as other versions of the style."
"This is a thoroughly enjoyable beer with enough novelty to make it a particularly interesting witbier. The beer pours a hazy yellow with lots of carbonation and a fairly frothy white head that does lace. The smell is floral, yeasty, with a touch of spice and fruitiness, like clove and pineapple and lemon. The taste is very interesting. It has all of the spicy, floral and citrus tastes of a classic wit, but there are some interesting added spices here. My guess is a touch of cardoman. The carbonation improves the overall mouthfeel, which is usually fairly watery for a witbier. There is a bit of a pepperish bite in the finish, which makes the experience even more enjoyable and lively. This is an excellent beer from a brewery that is fast becoming the best regional micro in New England. L'Chaim."
"Like most wheat beers in warm weather, a pretty drinkable brew."
"Hazy yellow-colored beer, extremely lively carbonation, and a typically-Cisco massive & creamy head. Smell is all lemony/orange and spice...it's fantastic. Tastes just like it smells, heavier on the lemon. This is amazing beer. Super-refreshing, this would be a perfect beer to pair with some seafood. This might turn into my go-to beer for the season."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is a very nice beer to drink for a long time, if you're in the mood for a good, lighter Belgian beer."
"I was not as impressed as some others have found this. It is a solid witbier flavor but otherwise is a rather neutral offering."
"Served in a tulip glass. Pale straw in color with zero-head and very little lacing during the tasting. Scents of lemon zest, orange peel and spices (clove, corriander, etc.). Taste similar to nose, but grassy character becomes pronounced, as well as belgian yeast. I have to say that I generally like witbiers, but some of the flavor characters tend to be a little over the top for me during the latter half of the tasting. This was not the case with Grey Lady; very flavorful, but also somewhat subdued. Pleasantly effervescent mouthfeel and slightly tart (lemony) finish. Drinkability was superb. I really enjoyed this beer."
"D: Very high. As the label says..Quenching! I am sure to pick this up again."
"I'm really enjoying this--my first bottle was one of those ""wow"" beer experiences that, well, as a beer lover i'm always seeking. Bravo."
"A new release from Cisco as far as I can tell. There is a cool label, with a mermaid on the cover. Goes for about eight bucks a bomber. Pour is golden, with nice white heading. Taste is of lemon, wheat, and other tropical fruits. Definitely one of the most drinkable and well executed Wits I have encountered in a while."
