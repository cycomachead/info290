Visually very appealing even thought the head does fall off fast and leaves only a think ring. Nose is lemony with a touch of ginger for a back note. It has a cracker like malt scent on the nose. Tall wheat with a perfume that is a touch sweet. A bit of spice form the sorachi ace hops but not too much. Pervading sweetness. The taste is a creamy and soft malt on a delicate hop body. The ginger is very understated but it lends a bit of lightness to the drink rather than heat or spiciness. Lemongrass uplifts the nose and this one is delicate and yet has a fullness on the palate that is all about flavor and not heaviness. The wheat is naturally sweet, crisp, dry but also soft. Yielding. Has a nice juicy middle without any real tartness and a delicate blending of the hops and the what malt finish it not dry but with a touch of sweetness.","utopiajane","Jul 18, 2014"

The smell of lemongrass scented stir-fries is followed candied ginger desserts. The piercing spice of the bitter hops refreshes the palate. In fact, this beer nearly nails all the peripherals of witbier. But there is no sweetness in flavor; the spiciness of the ginger is refreshing, but one-dimensional.

While it sounds delicious to have lemongrass in a Wit, you're left wanting after a taste- everything's just a bit too muted. The beer isn't terrible. just too bland, soft, and boring.

Light in body, a foundation of malted wheat, banana, lemongrass, spicy ginger and coriander- there was an evident tea like quality as well. This was an interesting take on a Witbier- Outside of the box ingredients used made for an interesting session beer.

I used the inverted Crack & Glug and ended up with over two fingers of dense, bone-white head with great retention. Color was a very cloudy lemon-yellow and it looked like a glassful of lemon meringue pie. Nose was zesty with the lemongrass and the ginger seemingly fighting for supremacy. Mouthfeel was soft, like it was caressing my tongue and the melding of the flavors was beautiful. Lemon, definitely, but as to what type of CANdy they were alluding to, I do not know, Lots of nice ginger spiciness also and I was beginning to mull over which dishes I would order at a BYOB with a sixer of this in tow.

It says it is brewed with Sorachi Ace Hops which come through just enough to give it a nice spice bitterness, and it has some ginger too. It is still very much a wheat beer but with these other flavors it pulls in some flavors similar to a Belgian style tripel.

2.82,-24.4,5,3,2.5,4,2,"Took a growler home from the brewery. Cracked it when it was a week old. Good head retention with an average golden hue. Aroma is nothing to speak of. Very little spiciness to it. Getting a bit of wit type yeast aroma, but very low on the lemony or ginger notes. Aroma is best described as flat. The beer is clean, actually a bit too clean with an unbalanced bitterness that just doesn't fit with a refreshing wit type brew. Swampy finish with a bit of muddled earthy ginger flavor. Overall not a favorite. If you're looking for a refreshing wit in charleston mothership from new belgium and allagash white are readiy available and preferable.","beernut7","Jul 23, 2011"

The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, bread, floral notes, and subtle spices. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I had heard lots of people in the area talking badly about this beer, so I jumped at the chance to try it for myself. I found it quite enjoyable and easy drinking. It was pretty much spot on for what you would expect for the style with the addition of a few subtle spices to give it a little kick and stand out from the rest.
