"Meh. Not very interesting for me."
""
""
"A very solid white ale, with some seasoning as expected of a ""Christmas beer"".  A great blend of the refreshing body of a white ale combined with the tastiness of a winter warmer."
""
""
"Serving type: bottle"
""
""
"Aroma of winter green spice, banana, wheat, faint orange, nutmeg. Taste sweet orange peel, spices, ginger.  Ok!"
"Pours a hazy yellow with a thin and fizzy head that trails the glass. The smell is very bold with a lot of allspice and nutmeg coming through with some of natural minty scents from the wheat heavy style. The taste was a bit more subdued though with the spices being on the finish and not much in the overall body. Not bad, but not for me."
"O: one note;"
""
"Overall:  I’m not a fan of this beer, but it really isn’t the fault of the beer or Sam Adams, as I’m not a fan of witbiers.  Actually, Sam Adams did a good job with this beer, as it captures all that a Belgian witbier should have."
""
""
"Bottle poured into pint glass"
""
"Very good! Not too spicy not too heavy! Loved it! whish I would have tried it sooner seams to be out of season now! Next year it will be the beer I drink on Christmas! Yes simply because of the name!"
""
""
""
"this beer is spiced damn"
""
"Too much christmas spice for a delicate beer style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's okay in a variety pack but I wouldn't seek it out on its own."
"I was able to score a six pack of this beer at a very good price this past weekend. It has a darker shade of yellow with some hints of orange, coriander and a slightly malty aftertaste at the end. A very solid tasting beer from Sam Adams and one I can see myself trying again someday."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really enjoyed this beer. I enjoyed it along side ken burns doc on prohibition. I really loved the taste and feel. It is a very nicely crafted beer. One of my favorites. Sadly I can't get anymore now that its January. Shame on me"

"DATE TASTED: December 19, 2014... GLASSWARE: Ommegang Rare Vos... OCCASION: the last shopping trip done... APPEARANCE: pours a fizzling, rapidly diminishing off-white head; body is a hazy orange with little effervescence, belying its pour... AROMA: pungent, aromatic flowers; thick, musty coriander, mulled wine and faint orange peel... PALATE: warm, middling and rather mild; a blunted finish...TASTE: slight, sour, oddly malty at its end with  cardboard-like grain; matted flower esters too, with some cinnamon and spice--surprisingly not an enjoyable combination  ... OVERALL: usually Sam produces some new treats during the Christmas season, but this one is more of a trick, with uneven mouthfeel and odd flavors that left it largely untouched at our holiday get-together..."
""
"This beer is very tasty! It has a nice amber hue and a great Christmas smell. It taste awesome, of nutmeg and orange, but the feel on the tongue is a little bit weak. I give this rather distinct beer a great overall score! Go Sam Adams!!"

"Looked good, Smelled good, the taste just wasn't there"

"Easy to drink spiced wheat beer."
""
"Poured aggressively, creating an enormous white head that fills the tall weizen glass to the rim. After a minute or so, the foam receded leaving a rice-cake like layer floating atop the golden, honey-colored ale. Minimal lacing. Although slightly hazy, the appearance more closely resembles a blonde ale than a wit. The label promises cinnamon, nutmeg and orange peel.  True to form, bright citrus scents greet the nose. Sweet pineapple, blonde malts and popcorn compete with hints of the aforementioned spices. The flavor is maltier than I expected, and the citrus is dialed in more than the aroma would lead one to believe. Pretty well balanced, as there is a fair amount of complexity, but it comes together in a way where little comes to the fore. The thin mouthfeel and light carbonation are bolstered marginally by the faint wheat haze. Ginger, nutmeg and a hint of grain in the finish. On the positive side, this is a pretty non-controversial beer. One could easily mistake this for a somewhat generic American lager with a little holiday spice added. I would have liked to see them go a bit bolder with this one. Also, if they are going to market this as a witbier, aptly named ""White Christmas", then it should at least stay more true to the style. A whiter, wit-like appearance & less clarity. The underlying brew in this one is just not up to the task. The refreshing summer pale wheat ales just don't have the chops to compete with the darker spiced holiday offerings. I get what they were trying to do, but this one just doesn't move the needle much for me. I would gladly trade this beer for more Old Fezziwig, or even some of the past beers that have graced the winter seasonal 12-pack. Holiday Porter & Cherry or Chocolate Bock are all welcome replacements."
""
"Pretty much the same as summer ale with a bit more spice. Meh."
""
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle poured into a glass, would be a decent summer beer in my opinion as a witbier."
""
""
""
""
"Got this in a variety pack for winter.  S/kind of a sour type wheat with slight citrus.  T/the typical wheat beer with some spices in the back end.  I did detect hints of spices mostly on the first few sips.  There is light carbonation which is nice. O/It is a Sam Adams.  What can you expect from most of their beers?  It is drinkable but does not keep my attention throughout the beer.  I would not seek this out by itself but unfortunately I had to get the pack to get the Old Fezziwig."
""
""
""
"O - Decent witbier, good use of spice.  An integrated, tightly constructed beer that does not wow, but delivers a reasonable drinking experience."

"Poured a 1inch of fluffy white into a 16oz Georgia Bulldog pint glass, and the body of this beer had a light golden color with a cloudy white haze to it. The aroma was by far the best part of the beer, having a nice mix of nutmeg, cinnamon,  and orange. The taste pretty much matches up with what you get from the aroma, and as you drink this beer you get a light frosty lacing all along your glass. The mouth feel of this beer is thin with light carbonation.  Samuel Adams White Christmas is a good beer, and it hit all its marks of being a Witber."
""
"A very good smooth christmas taste. It is definitely one of the great Christmas beers."
""
""
""
"not a bad beer, but nothing special.  drinkable like most Sam Adams, but ehhh"
"Worst sam Adams I've had"
""
"I really enjoy this beer. Thank you Samuel Adams!"
"The wheat flavors dissipate as the beer warms up and the spices begin to bloom. Great lacing and a nice head. Compared to other Sam Adams offerings I'd say this is subpar, but I'm not a big fan of wheat."
"Eh not to great would rather spend the extra for a good craft"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Alright witbier, however for Sam Adams winter collection, I think I prefer the Winter Lager."
"Not a fan of the style."
""
"The taste follows the nose this being a pretty standard wheat beer with spices. There is also a hint of some sort of citrus taste and everything blends together quite nicely but nothing really pops or stands out.  It is an interesting choice by Sam Adams to blend a wheat beer with holiday spices.  It might be a good beer to use in order to introduce a friend to wheat beers."
""
"Overall, this beer was a fair-to-middlin' seasoned brew. I really enjoyed the citrus with that slight clove afternote. I said earlier and now repeat, I wish this beer could have asserted itself in some way, maybe with a little more orange zest, but I can't say I was disappointed overall. Great seasonal brew, I would definitely try it again next year."

"Samuel Adams White Christmas brewed by Boston Beer Company, with an ABV of 5.80%  This brew pours out a nice cloudy amber color with a nice thick white head. White Christmas is an unfiltered brew you can not see thought it. The smell is rich with grains and malts. Now for the taste is sweet with some grains. You pick up on some citrus and spice in this brew. There is a lot going on in this brew.  I like how this brew is different from most brews on the market. The mouthfeel is clean and finishing. There is nothing overpowering  in this brew, this brew has a nice balance to it. Boston Beer Company did a nice job with this one. I would buy this brew again."
""
""
"      Overall, I'll give a 4 to Samuel Adams White Christmas - Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams). It wasn't a very profound brew, but a good diversion away from the heavier, darker ""winter beers"" released by these guys and most other brewers. I might buy this again to bust the rut."
""
""
"Nice light, cloudy, hazy color. Very good witbier in my opinion, especially for winter."
""
"The feel if this beer is light and has a great smooth finish. This is highly drinkable and only a slight aftertaste that goes away quickly."

"Orange peel with a hint of Christmas spices. I don't know why but the people at Sams can't seem to figure out that orange peel is a strong ingredient that overpowers any others.  They have the same problem with the white lantern.  I want to like this beer, but until they try harder with their recipes I'll always look elsewhere for creative brews."

"I was highly disappointed with this beer.  I am no beer expert but I have had a wide variety of beers and this is one of the worst beers I have ever had. Its a creative blend, high quality beer but the taste was awful. I can't really think of words to explain it but it is tough to swallow."

"12 ounce bottle, best before March 2014. Oh well, better late than never! Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy golden/amber color with a half inch off-white head that stayed around for a good amount of time. There's a small amount of lacing. The brew smells like nutmeg, cinnamon, clove and some orange and orange peel. It tastes pretty much just like the aroma, but with the addition of some wheat/bready malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating with moderate carbonation. Not a bad brew, but I wish I would have been able to try this when it was fresher. Hopefully I'll be able to this upcoming winter!"

"Overall this is not a bad beer, appropriate for the holiday season, worthy of a shot."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It did not live up to my expectations. It is not a bad beer, but it falls short. Yet, I would still have it again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A prominently orange peel citrus taste with an almost non-existent nutmeg/cinnamon hint. Not to impressive but pretty drinkable."
""
""
""

"Overall, this was a good one I almost missed for the season. I'm glad I took one last look at the bottom of the cooler at my number 2 carry out."

"O-Sam Adams could greatly improve their winter mix pack by replacing this with another Old Fezziwig."
"Pours a hazy orange in color with about a 1/2-finger white head. Some spotty lacing is seen. Very pleasant aroma of mixed spices and malt, especially the orange peal coming through. A pleasing taste that isn't bitter and you can taste the spices and orange peal but it is not overwhelming unlike some seasonal brews. I really liked this one and is one of the better Samuel Adams also."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured out of a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours slightly cloudy orange with a tiny white head. Smells of some wintertime spices and wheat, not overly strong. Tastes of orange and very slight wheat with spice. Beer is light bodied, nice carbonation, nice finish. Overall a very good beer."

"This is an easy wheat to drink and if you are new to the style it would be a pleasant place to start. Smooth, slightly sweet, mostly cloves...easy drinking. Not much else to say, I think it needs more spices on the nose and tongue...it pretty much tastes like a watered down honey/clove wheat. I'd drink a couple out of a sampler but probably wouldn't buy on its own."
""
""
""
""
""
"I enjoyed this. It's a relaxing drink. Basically, it feels like a weaker lager with some spices thrown in it. Decent, but obviously nothing you'd praise from the mountain tops. Spices are the dominant theme, but not too dominant. I will get this again next year in the seasonal pack."
"O: A step fuller and creamier than the really bad ones of the style, but I did not care for this one a whole lot more than I care for those. Flavors are as described on the bottle but taste synthetic and syrupy, and everything has an oily texture to it. Not the worst the definitely not the best offering from BBC."
""
""
""
"Pass. Sam Adams can't make a white ale/witbier to save their life."
"To good health and good beer."
""
"Semi cloudy straw color with moderate head and moderate to heavy carbonation. It has a spiced citrus aroma. Balanced spiced taste with slight citrus (orange) and hop notes. Refreshing and smooth. No element is too harsh or stands out excessively. Finishes much light it starts, maybe with a bit more citrus."
""
""
""
""
""
"Scents of cinnamon and nutmeg, slight vanilla and faint bready malt. Its decent, but very much dominated by spices, less yeasty and bready than a witbier normally smells. Taste begins rather sweet, with lots of sweet malt, sweet spices, mostly nutmeg and cinnamon and slight vanilla. Spices become more prominent in the middle of the sip, sweetness remains. Finish is sweet and spicy with a grainy aftertaste that has hints of vanilla. A good dessert beer, quite sweet, though not up to snuff for a witbier. Good for what it is though. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation and a crisp finish. Again, rather true to form, nothing wrong at all. Overall this is a decent witbier and a good Winter dessert beer. It doesn't standout from the crowd of witbiers, but for a sweet dessert beer its quite nice. Its enjoyable, but not amazing, a good middle road beer."
""
"I dont know if everyone else is missing something, but I really enjoyed this one. From the first sip to the last, it was tasty. The mouthfeel could use some work: for some reason, festive beer should be more chewy than this one presents. Give me a mixed six of this and Fezziwig and my holidays would be ""all set""."
""
""
""
""
"overall: I was surprised by this beer. It is a surprisingly easy to drink well made witbier. Its flavors follow the wit style quite well, and the final product is actually a fairly decent desert beer (I classify it as such due to how sweet it is). I would be happy to drink it again and found no real problems with it at all. 4\5"

"O - I got this as part of case of ""Winter Favorites"" but it's not a favorite of mine. I don't mind a little spice in seasonal beers but this was just too much. Even a spiced beer should still taste like beer. If you like a lot of spice, this one is for you; otherwise not so much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So this was a definite yes for me. Upon opening the bottle you get hit with the scent of the spices. The beer tastes just as described and if I could compare it to something it would be a spic cake with hits of beer. I really enjoined this beer however those who don't like heavily spiced beers I would not recommend this."

"Pours a hazy medium golden color with a smallish white head that dissipates quickly. Aromas of pepper, anise, nutmeg and cinnamon overpower the nose of this one. Light sweet maltiness and a hint of wheat grain round out the aroma. The flavor is over spiced gingerbread cookies. There's a hint of beer in here, but the spicing makes it hard for me to find. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick spicy mouthfeel. Not the beer for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- it's ok but nothing to get worked up about"
"A hazy pale gold in the glass, a swift pour yields a thick frothy head comprised of a mix of large and small bubbles. Once this subsides a nice layer remains which laces a bit. The smell is all spice up front. I'm hit by copious amounts of ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon and orange. Beyond the spice there is a bit of wheat character both in terms of malt and characteristic yeast notes. The taste is ok, at first the spice is very noticeable. Beyond the spice there is a decent wheat beer base with the pale malts and wheat providing a bit of subdued sweetness. There is a surprising amount of hop in there as well and this bitterness combines nicely with the orange and citrus of the yeast to round things out. Body is pretty light as a fair bit of carbonation and low residual sugar prevents this from feeling heavy. Despite the spice the finish is also pretty clean with just a bit of citrus and spice lingering, not cloying at all. Overall I'm pretty happy with this one, seems like a take on the old Sam Adams White Ale but maybe with things toned down a bit. This is a good example of the style and a nice change of pace for the season."
""
"Pours bright light copper, active fast white foam. Settles out. Cookie spices - cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, orange. More orange than not. Taste is a soft malt, citrus back, light hop. Clove heavy. Wheat and orange. Kind of overspiced. Not a big fan of winter wits, and this one is not very good."

"o: Not bad as a dinner accompaniment (spaghetti and meatballs), but not a whole lot of flavor. The young bar crowd that is not into craft should find this at least slightly different. Probably would be a little better suited as a pre-Halloween offering. By December I'm wanting something dark that tastes like dark beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, this is a typical Sam Adams spice-laden lighter beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My brother brought these over, had it poured from the bottle into a weizen glass, the 8th beer I've reviewed from Sam. I think the winter whear beer is a tricky thing to execute, want to get enough spices in there such that no one would confuse it for a summer, without going overboard. Hazy yellow color and soft white head. Obvious notes of citrus and spice, particularly nutmeg. Nice when you want a winter beer that might not weigh you down too much. I think it's a bit underrated on here, good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I like this very much. When i first took a sip I thought for a second I took a bite of a ginger bread cookie. However, the smell is a little off setting: Not so inviting. I like the hints of cinnamon and nutmeg that has a subtlety that is unmatched by any other Chirstmas beer."
""
"Overall, the best things about White Christmas were its aroma and its drinkability. We enjoyed the aroma for its spicy inclusions, driving it deeper and making it aptly seasonal. The drinkability, on the other hand, simply facilitated being able to slug these guys back. While it was technically flawed in its overly watered airiness, this exponentially increased how easily it was sipped. Otherwise, we were disappointed that the flavoring didn’t express the same level of suitability that the nose did. Each component sat on its own, with the generic gritty grain underlying the spices and fruity tops. These never really came together, and were only loosely approximated by heavy wateriness. Harsh comments aside, this, as with their Blackberry Wit, hit the spot for what it was, and had its moment amongst friends who spent an evening catching up."
""
""
""
""
"This is a pretty good beer, but it seems kind of odd as a winter beer, and yet doesn't seem to fully develop the qualities of a good wheat beer. I suppose it's just my bias, as I associate this type of beer with hot weather. This was purchased as part of a holiday variety 12 pack- 14.99 and a worthwhile purchase."
""
""
"O- Between the metallic flavors and the carbonation issue I was pretty let down by a beer that I thought I would really enjoy. Damn."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall impression: A refreshing, slightly heavy-handed witbier. Not sure I'd put it in the ""Winter beer"" category but it was pretty good. Glad to have sampled it."
""
""
"Pours a nice, cloudy golden brown with a small head. Smells great. A nice spice with the scent of the citrus standing out. Taste is awesome. Perfect for winter. Hint of citrus and spice perfectly balanced by the cinnamon and nutmeg. Mouthfeel is also good. Goes down smooth, not too carbonated. This is probably my favorite seasonal beer."

"Samuel Adams White Christmas ---3/5."
""
"O: This is a great light and smooth beer to have when you're having a meal or just want something refreshing that still has a lot of flavor. Definitely a nice beer to add to your winter beer selections (though it can easily fit in a harvest collection as well)."
""
""
""
"Pours a nice yellow amber with a half finger head that quickly dissipates. Smells like the spices of cinnamon and orange peel and less if none of the nutmeg. Nice spicy aromatic smell initially that on later smells is not perceptible. Same with the taste. After the first couple of sips the taste becomes nondescript. The initial aromatic taste is quickly gone after your palate gets used to it. Had a clean and refreshing taste with some bitterness at the end. You get a tiny hint of orange peel but not much. Tastes like a regular beer to me. Nice crisp and refreshing beer that is fairly reminiscent of winter."

""
"Overall a pleasant take on a holiday witbeir without going overboard. Easy drinker."
""
"O- I was a bit underwhelmed with this beer. High drinkability but not much else"
""
"On the fuller end of medium body with a peppery spice presence that lingers over the yeast and sweet citrus notes into a slightly dry finish. Prominent zesty spice up front with clove, cinnamon, ginger, allspice and nutmeg followed by strong bread/yeast flavor, sweet citrus rind, banana, bubblegum, apple cider and subtle pumpkin. Tastes appropriate for the season but it's slightly watered down and the flavors don't mesh very well. Kind of bland except for being heavily spice and having strong wheat/bread flavor. Even the spice blend feels a bit generic and the orange peel is buried underneath the other notes. Okay for this time if year but not something that I would want to drink more than once."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: I'm not a Samuel Adams fanboy, far from it. However, White Christmas proves that the brewers over at Boston Beer Co know their stuff. Crafting a beer that could please joe six-pack and serious beer geeks as well is rare. Nice job. Would I drink it again? Yes."
""
""
"The Verdict: Very good. A witbier with a subtle blend of spices that don’t overpower the tongue, this is one of SA’s better seasonal offerings. If you’re a Blue Moon or Shock Top drinker, give this a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"As aforementioned, pretty sure it was a bad bottle (my brother did drop this one, perhaps he broke the seal and it went flat or something). May try again in the future."
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this I found it to be an excellent Witbier with a holiday twist."
""
"Notes - A safe brew by Sam Adams yet compelling enough to bring the similar nostalgic feeling of hot chocolate on a cold winters morning. Another great beer by Sam Adams, thanks again my friend!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A pretty decent example of a wheat beer with a nice twist."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a really good Christmas dessert beer from the holiday spices."
""
""
""
""
"Taste: Like I said the wheatiness of this wheat beer is not strong, but nevertheless (and as it should be) you pick up what characteristics."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is an okay beer, nothing that great, probably comparable to Blue Moon which I would go with over this one. Got this one in the '13 Winter Favorites pack and wish they would have left one of the 3 spice beers in there out and put the Holiday Porter or something in instead."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I like the holiday spices they used, I just wish they would have toned down the orange peel a tad. Still it is an interesting take on a witbier and I would drink it again."
"Overall: An average witbier. I like the light holiday spices, but I would not get this outside of the holiday sampler. One of the weaker beers I have seen in the winter sampler."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not bad, not sure I'd pick up a six of this, but pretty decent in a seasonal pack. I've only had three other ""Witbiers"" so I can't really compare too much to the style, but as a beer, it's pretty decent."

"Overall: It's hard to deny that this beer will satisfy most beer drinkers and even those who generally avoid beer during the Christmas holidays because it is refreshing. The smell is fantastic, but the taste is not very bold, and like most Sam Adams beers, it seems more tailored to the commercial audience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is really quite typical of a wit with the toasted pale malt notes, citrus, and mild hop bit. But it feels generally clean all the way through."
""
""
"Pours golden with a nice frothy head that lingers and laces well. Nose is of spice, mostly nutmeg. Light body with good carbonation. The taste is subtle, but of spice, with it being more nutmeg than anything else. Finishes cleanly with a slight spiciness that lingers. A solid non-complex beer, but not outstanding. It needs more flavor, be it from more spice or dark malt."

"A good beer, though a bit subtle flavor profiles overall."

"O: A nice blend of yeast and spices. Not overly dramatic but a nice sessional brew to enjoy during the holidays."
"O: Overall, not bad, but not great. I'm not a huge fan of witbier's, and dont really consider them winter seasonals, so I likely wont be purchasing this one again. Worth a try though."
""

"Pours out a hazy brass with a barely there head. Smells of crackery wheat with definite cinnamon and orange. Not picking up much Belgian yeast. Spices are pretty strong in the flavor. Too sweet and not enough yeast character for my expectations of drinking a white beer. Mouthfeel is way to sticky and definitely lacks carbonation. I don't get why they have three beers in their holiday mix pack with essentially the same spice profile (White Christmas, Winter Lager, and Old Fezziwig). Not feeling this."

"Pours a hazy pale golden yellow with a medium off white head. Aroma and Taste of sweet biscuit malt, wheat, yeast, with some light spicy fruity notes and some mild bitterness. Palate is a medium body, crisp with moderate carbonation. Finishes with a combination of sweet malt, wheat, yeast with some light spicy fruity flavor and mild bitterness, slight nutty flavor on the end. Overall a good drinking session ale."

"The beer pours a nice light gold with a crisp white head that has real staying power. The aroma is pretty much aniseed, but at a very pleasant level and character. Since that's what I expected (and what I liked about it) it works for this beer. They really did a great job with the taste on this one. It has a nice light malty character with good fruitiness, and then the Aniseed at just the right level to be all over it, but still allow the other tastes there rightful place. A home run Wit in my opinion. The feel is light and a bit oily. This was one of the best efforts for a Wit I've had in a while. Great job with the spicing."

"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, White Christmas is a hazy, straw-golden color with a thin, creamy white head. The most obvious part of the nose is the spice boquete, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, nutmeg, ginger and allspice. The level of unchecked spice smell actually makes the nose a bit nauseating. The level of spice is fairly high in the taste as well; however the nice balanced, toasty, malty backdrop it enhances fares much better in flavor than in smell. The mouthfeel is quite pleasant, medium in body with a chewy, slightly creamy carbonation. Overall, not a favorite of mine by SA, not my favorite Witbier - but if you're looking for a ""Holiday"" beer, this would fit the bill."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, best before April 2013. Pours hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon, orange peel, wheat, clove, pepper, pear, floral, biscuit, and earthy yeast spiciness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and spice notes. Taste of lemon, pear, cinnamon, nutmeg, orange peel, wheat, light clove, pepper, floral, biscuit, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, cinnamon, nutmeg, wheat, biscuit, light clove, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance and complexity of malt and spice notes; with spices being more muted than I expected from the nose; and zero cloying flavors on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a good spiced witbier. Good balance of malt and spice notes with good flavor robustness; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"O: Overall wouldnt drink in multiples. The nutmeg and cinnamon seem a bit out of place. A wit that wants to be a xmas beer, yes i get it, but something that comes off a bit more intriquing on paper then palate. A bit sweet overall, the flavor is not bad, just odd, seeming a bit forced and misplaced, i get the notion and concept of being different just may take a bit to get used to here."
""
"Taste is on the sweeter side, starts out with a sweet malt fruit which leads to the orange peel citrus, that is followed by some spicing like nutmeg and clove, the spicing seems a bit overhanded, coupled with the sweet malt it becomes a tad cloying, decent carbonation and body though."
"I'm not a big fan of this style. I got it in a combo pack. It was pretty good, for the style, though. Very orangey and very yeasty at the same time. I usually don't like that much, but it was fairly inoffensive. There was not too much coriander and seemed to be more on the clove side as far as spicing. Very inoffensive, though. More suitable for a general audience. Despite this, I really wouldn't want to drink this around Christmas time. I'm glad I held onto a bottle until late March before reviewing it. I don't like to be too harsh on styles I don't like and at the very least, I'd like to review this beer at a time when I'm more open to it. This is a much better warm-weather beer than a cold weather one. Winter is a time for very dark beers. This is very much a light and fruity brew."

"Overall - Decent, a little too spice heavy, really not much balance to this. Really sweet and easy to drink. Nothing special or something to seak out, but worth a drink atleast."
""
"O: Not a great offering but not a bad offering either for the style - a touch too much spice and sweetness for my personal preferences but it does not make this beer something I would tell people to avoid. I like the idea but just might like it better a little more toned down."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a light straw amber with a half finger white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of mild wheat and bready malt with a hint of spices. Flavor is dominated by cinnamon and light cloves supported by wheat and sweet malt. Light bodied with peppery carbonation. The witbier character is subdued, but a well balanced flavor of light sweet malt, wheat and Christmas spices delivers on the name. Mild and pleasant."

"Overall/Comments: Overall this was a solid yet unspectacular offering that is a nice change of pace from most winter beer. I enjoyed this one. Part of the Sam Adams Winter Classics or alone as a 6-pack. Classified as a Witbier at 5.8%. Consumed 1-2-2013"
""

"Overall not a great wit. The flavor is a bit off. It tastes un-fermented. Blue Moon is better."
""
""
""
""
"3.05/5.00"
"Overall: an enjoyable wittier that is easy to consume."
""
"Although this beer did not blow my socks off, it was highly drinkable and unique as a winter seasonal. I would love to see more breweries integrate a spiced witbier into their winter lineup, as the flavors pair perfectly with many foods served during the holiday season."
"Thanks Dad."
""
""
"One of the worst Sam Adams offerings. Awful, almost sickening smell and a taste that matches it. Putrid odor. Not sure why these guys thought drinking potpurri would be a good idea. Looks like any other Belgian Wit beer, in terms of color and clarity. Mouthfeel and carbonation are all completely normal, but the smell combined with the flavor profile make this absolutely off-putting."

"O: Nothing special to me, though I readily admit this isn't a style I seek out. It is what it is, and its a spiced Wit. Nothing more."
""
""
"Drinkability: It is decent and there is nothing wrong with it. However, there are a lot better winter seasonals out there — some of which I am sure are brewed by Samuel Adams."
"Overall, it's not a bad beer. This beer might need to age a bit for the ingredients to play nicer with each other, but I'm not sure how long you can cellar this stuff. It's fairly easy to drink, especially around the cold weather months, though a bit more alcohol and heat would be welcome."
""
""
"Pours a hazy straw color, moderate head. Scent is very pale with notes of pilsner and wheat malts, giving a little grainy tang to the nose, some faint seasonal spicing and a touch of lemon peel. Taste is light as well, faint notes of wheat and pilsner malt, lemon rind and seasonal spicing and faint as well. Lighter side of medium. Drinakable - yes, memorable - no."
""
"I have to hold Boston Brewing responsible here. This is a poorly executed holiday ale. Throw me an Old Fezziwig or a Holiday Porter any day over this."
"Taste begins with some soft wheat notes followed by a brief middle with sweet orange. Spices swiftly sweep the palate and offer a decent linger to the finish. Rather light in malt profile and overall depth of character. Decent and with a spritzy carbonation throughout the glass though a bit thin overall in feel. Overall an interesting take on a holiday spiced brew though not in a striking way."

"O-I deemed this beer to be decent. I really enjoyed the spices in this beer, it's great for Christmas time but other than the aroma this beer was not to impressive to me, but very glad I had the chance to try this. Although, I would reccomend this to other beer loving friends."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a weiss-vase, the beer is an unfiltered, pale, yellowish coloring with a thin, sparse, filmy coating of white on the surface, with a little more substantial build up around the edges. Aromas of cinnamon and coriander on a bready backbone. The nose is subtle, other than the spices. Flavors of rich bread, with a heavy dosing of the clove, nutmeg, cinnamon, and coriander spicing. Very well blended in the spicing, but very spice heavy overall. The backbone of toasted grains and bread support, but get somewhat overshadowed. The aftertaste is warming, with the spices blending around on the palate, leading into a clean, quick finish. Tasty, light beer that would be a crowd pleaser during holiday get togethers, but there are Witbiers out there that have more to offer."
""
""
""
""
"The name is the only thing about this beer that justifies its inclusion in the 2012 Winter Classics pack. There is nothing winter Seasonal about wits and it replaced the Black and Brew which I thought was an above average coffee stout."
""
""
"Overall: Wits aren't my favorite style and this is not one of my favorite Wits"
"Poured a hazy orange color with about an inch of foam that spent itself quickly. Sme decent lacing in a Sam's pint. Aroma was typical wheat beer, very faint on the spices. Noted orange, nutmeg, cinnamon, maybe cardamom?, coriander. Taste was average. Nothing outstanding, but nothing bad either. Some spice notes, typical wheat beer haylike flavor. Lingered a bit on the tongue, but somewhat thin mouthfeel overall. Nice carbonation level. Wife liked it..."
"A nice spicy winter beer."
""
"The White Christmas can in a Holiday mixed pack...a much better replacement to the Cranberry Lambic. The beer pours a cloudy yellow with thin white head that is not lacing. Definitely smell the orange peel....not so much the nutmeg and cinnamon. The taste starts with a crisp citrus start and then the spice bolstered by the cinnamon kicks in. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a tasty beer...but it will not replace Fizzywig or Holiday Porter as my favs."

"The worst beer from Sam Adams I've ever had and something I'd be glad if they got rid of."
"something tells me the witbier spice is probably artificial, but it works here. probably wouldn't have more than one at a sitting, but the one's tasty enough."

"O-one of the better seasonal offerings from sam adams imo; I'm reviewing it more as a flavored white ale rather than a belgian witbier style in mind"
""
""
""
"O – White Christmas is a decent witbier. The spices impart a festive flavor. Would drink again."
"Bottle: Poured a cloudy orangey color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of light ginger notes with some coriander notes also perceptible. Taste is a mix between some light notes of wheat with some coriander and ginger notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Not bad but really nothing to write home about either."
""
""
""
"My only regret is not buying more."
"Pours a cloudy orange-gold with a fluffy white head that settles to a thin cap, leaving lots of soapy lacing. Mild aromas of crisp wheat, nutmeg, cinnamon, and a touch of citrus peel. Not much going on, but pleasant. More mild flavors of wheat, banana, clove, cinnamon, and candied orange peel. Mouthfeel is smooth, with a medium-thin body and ample carbonation. Not a particularly Sam Adams offering."
"Overall, a fairly subtle Christmas offering. Not really a great wit or a great winter brew, though. Fairly middle of the road."
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad brew at all, to judge it as a winter beer is a little tough it seems to be lost in confusion when it comes seasons."
"Not half bad, sort of an odd ball to the group. Would have love to see this amped up to 7% abv or a bit more but they kept it safe. I'm sure they'll be snatched up during any holiday parties being a witbier and all."
""
""
"Pours a two-fingered white head that fades quickly to ring leaving traces of lace. Light-medium carbonation. Medium body. Hazy straw color. Nose is orange peel, flavor is sweet orange peel and finish is sweet and dry. 12oz bottle part of 12-pak $13.99 Market Basket Concord, NH."
""
""
"O: Not a bad holiday offering at all. It's not superb, but it is definitely drinkable and is just different enough to be interesting. If the folks at Samuel Adams keep this beer in the rotation for next year, I'll be curious to see how it develops."
"White Christmas poured a hazy yellow color with a good size white head. There was a yeasty aroma with hints of nutmeg and cinnamon. The taste had a belgian wheat like backbone with strong cinnamon and nutmeg flavors. Strong flavors, but seems to flood the palate. Overall a nice good flavored witbeir."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a pleasant enough beer, just not that exciting. Taken in context, I think it went well in the Winter 12 pack, however."
"Mouthfeel: It is spot on with the body not to light that it loses flavor but not too heavy that it is hard to drink"
"An ok beer, nothing special. A mixture between an American wheat ale and witbier with a subtle hint of holiday spice. As with a lot of SA wheat brews, there is a big presence of lemon."
""
"I don't like the mash up. The citrus is bright and shiny and the cinnamon is dull and heavy and they just don't play well together on my palette."
"O - It is a nice beer. Not my favorite but as always, Sam Adams makes a competent brew that may please a lot of people."
"A pretty good witbier. Of course it draws similarities to Blue Moon, but this has more of a rounded out feel and more natural citrus quality to it."
"Overall this is a good witbeer, but the taste doesn't quite pop. If I loved the style, it might be better."
"Not my favorite offering from Boston Brewing Company. A pale wheat ale with some flavors injected that just don't work."
"O-Tastes a bit remniscent of egg nog with the combination of spices and creamy mouthfeel. The carbonation is too much and takes away from the smooth potential of this brew. An admitted Belgian wheat snob this beer is an ok drink but just doesn't cut it for me."
""
""
"I opened my first bottle of White Christmas absolutely parched and pooped out from a long night of gift shopping - if it failed to impress in those conditions, with that big a handicap in its favour, then I can't be very optimistic about my next bottle. (Note: it wasn't any better.) Call it whatever you want, but this is really a ‘hot day in July’ beer and, at this quality, doesn't warrant attention for anything else."
""
""
""
""
"M - Thin body. Vibrant carbonation. Dry finish. Quite drinkable."
""
"Foggy gold body with a slender, creamy white head. Spicy, powdery sweet aroma...cinnamon, citrus, coriander, and clove. Very mild. A lot of spices in the flavor too, though not overly spiced. Lemon, orange peel, lightly sweet wheat malt, and nutmeg. Creamy, medium-light body. Meh, I don't know...I'm not really feeling this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a light to medium bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. It has a smoothness about it that almost makes the brew feel more chewy. I know they were going for a holiday ale here but the spices are a bit over the top until the palate becomes accustomed to it. I appreciate the chance to try this brew, but it isn't something I would purchase."
"Overall it is not a bad beer; I'll stick with Winter Lager though."
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty nice beer. This could be a side project on their White Ale that I originally thought this was. Pretty enjoyable and probably would be enjoyed more in the summer, than in the cold winter. A nice little find too."

"4/3/3/3/3"

"A really well-done holiday witbier. Well-balanced with subtle complexities of the ingredients making their appearance with every sip. A very good beer to enjoy if stronger, darker, more potent winter/holiday ales aren't what you are looking for during the cold season."
"Pours a pale golden color. Smells spicy with a note of wheat. In the flavor, sweet crisp wheat and a dry spice. Coriander and clove are easily identifiable. Little bitterness but not too sweet. Orange peel and allspice round out the flavor profile. Medium bodied, well carbonated and finishes clean. Overall this is a drinkable winter offering from Boston Beer Co, certainly a solid offering."

"Overall I thought this was an OK beer and a average example of the style, there was nothing that was out of place with this beer, but there also wasn't anything that stuck out as being really well done. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was little too thick for me and the flavor didn't do the best job at holding my attention, one would be enough for me, I don't think I would want two in a row. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance, it looked like a proper Witbier and it's just what I expect to see in this style. What I liked the least about this beer is the only thing that stays as strong as it did in the aroma was the sweetness, I would much rather have more wheat and spices. I don't think I will be getting this beer again, I might get it if it's release next year but a six pack is enough for me for this year, If you really like the style I recommend trying it but I wouldn't tell my friends that they have to try it. All in all this beer was decent and pretty true to style bit it was a little rough around the edges and needs a little more fine tuning, as far as noteworthy holiday beers I don't see this one making the list, and for the style I think I would rather have Bell's Winter White Ale. Samuel Adams makes solid beer and that;s what this is, but it's not all the memorable."
"Samuel Adams White Christmas is probably the surprise Christmas beer of 2012 for me. I really expected to hate it. I don’t…at all. It’s surprisingly good. Not great, but good. I’d suggest picking up a six-pack while it’s around. It’s definitely worth a shot."
""
""
"O - This is a pretty good seasonal offering from Samuel Adams. It might be a good introduction to the wheat beer style for someone new to craft beer. Mild but tasty enough to win converts from the macros."
""
"Taste is more of the spices -- cinnamon and nutmeg come through, as does a hint of orange zest and wheat sharpness later near the finish. This is a strong and well-flavored brew, and certainly enjoyable in small amounts."
""
"By the way - I hope to go back to Key West numerous times, however the bars are a little disappointing when it comes to craft beer. The highlight for me was the ""Loaded Landshark"" at Margaritaville, which is a Landshark Lager (awful on it's own) spiked with lime tequila. Good times."
""
"12 oz bottle. Thanks Samp01 for sharing. Pours hazy golden with long lasting, creamy, white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of wheat malt, sourdough, and hints of spices and pears. Body is medium and smooth. A lot of spices, wheat malt, citrus fruit fill the mouth. Finish is long and spicy. Overall it is nicely made wit."
"12oz bottle, pours a hazy, ruddy, yellow color with a tinge of rusty orange, tall white head sticks around and leaves some lace as it fades. Aromas are oddly musty, wheaty, spicy, orange peel. Tastes are wheaty, nutmeg, cinnamon, yeast, still musty, orange. Thin-to-medium mouth-feel, higher carbonation makes it feel fuller. Finishes fairly clean with slight tartness & dryness. Overall, this was a disappointment. I don't feel that the cinnamon & nutmeg belong here, maybe some familiar clove might have rounded it out a bit?"
"O - Overall, quite good, and though I'm a sucker for wheat beers, not my favorite seasonal from Sam Adams. But I'd drink it again and hope I like it as much a second time around."
""
"O= This is a solid beer. Not really heavy in the spice and ""christmas"" flavors. There is a little however if you search for it. It doesn't have that classic SA winter beer greatness however. Maybe they just spoil me this their other holiday beers. This was a little bit of a let down."
"Overall it was good, and I wanted to like it more but this is just not a style I’m crazy about. A good American choice if you like this style of beer."
"Overall not a fan of how the flavors come together, although the problem may be that I don't enjoy the underlying beer. Technically good, but not very enjoyable. Would not recommend."
"O: Meh. Mediocre beer, but still not bad. Drinkable, but not recommended. A 'meh' witbier."
"O – This is a really tasty beer. If the appearance and aroma were a bit better, this could be a 4+. I like the idea of doing a spiced witbier for a winter seasonal. While I do like heavier beers, it’s a nice change of pace from the stouts and winter warmers – particularly when you live in Charleston and it’s been in the 70s for the past week."
""
""
""
""
""
"This isn't trying to be a Belgian ale, so I won't fault it too heavily for failing to live up to the style guidelines of a proper wit. That said, the base beer is not a good vehicle for all these spices whatsoever."
"O: Basically Sam Adams white ale with some well executed seasoning, though this brew has a sense of execution and craft that is a bit above what they typically produce. A solid offering. I havent had a wheat beer in awhile and this hit the spot, good change of pace from IPA's and Porters."

""
"Overall – A delicious and flavorful brew. A nice winter style twist of a classic wit. Sam Adams dose it again."
"The beer pours a dark golden color with modest foam. Nothing special, but not too bad either. The aroma comes across with a bit of a sour lemon aspect mixed with spices vaguely reminiscent of the holiday season. This trend continues onto the palate with lemon leading to a sturdy wheat center. Cloves, nutmeg and other spices pick-up at the end. This brew has some odd notes to it and isn't put together in a particularly cogent way. The idea is just fine, but it could use some more tweaking."
""
""

"Drinkability is pretty high, it's a solid spicy wit. I maybe wouldn't drink 6 in a sitting, but 2-3 would be nice and festive."

"White Christmas pours a light bodied cloudy gold in color with a light white head around the glass. The nose is pretty straightforward and simple. There is slight Belgian yeast character with a touch of coriander and nutmeg. The flavors have more of a presence but finish quickly. It features slightly sweet pale malts, some nutmeg, cinnamon, and coriander. It's seasonally appropriate. It drinks light in body and is pretty drinkable. Would I buy a six pack? No. But this beer is well suited for their Winter Classics Variety pack."
""
"O: Well done, but not a favored style."
"A nice variation on one of my favorite styles. They have taken a classic summer beer and made it nice for the holiday season. Definitely a beer worth checking out."
"Would work with craft beer newbies at a holiday party...."
""
"Overall: Decent holiday brew, I will buy this one again."
"Overall a pretty average beer. would be improved with better head retention, less spice/more beer taste, and slightly less carbonation."
"This is much better than I had expected. Some of the spices used are the typical ones: ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon. But then there's the addition of vanilla which adds a rich, creamy taste. This is definitely not a typical witbier. I could definitely have several of these with family during the holidays. I'll probably pick up some more."
"The beer poured a pleasing yellowish-orange with a perfectly white head. A tall head that quickly shrunk small. The carbonation was high with this beer as you could see the uncountable number of bubbles flying up the glass. White Christmas has a very pleasing order of oranges mixed with cinnamon and the appealing odor of a good ale. Mouthfeel was average, nothing worth mentioning and although I graded it lower on taste, I gave it a higher overall score since it really stands out in the ales I have tried. (Too bad I only got two out of the sampler box I purchased...)"
"Overall, a miss for Samuel Adams. I don't know why they got rid of the decent Black and Brew for this but not a good idea."
""
"Purchased with the Samuel Adams Seasonal Pack. Poured into a Pilsener glass with a decent 3/4 inch head. Has a a murky yellow-orange color. Smells include coriander and lemon. The taste has a typical witbier taste with some very strong notes of coriander. The overall mouthfeel is decent with a smooth yet slightly acidic. Overall a very good beer. Would definitely suggest trying it."
""
"The alcohol was pretty well-hidden here and even though this wasn't a session beer, I could easily have had another in one sitting. While it's not Boston Beer's standout offering, this was a welcome change from the darker and heavier seasonals that are lining the store shelves now. If you're a fan of the White Ale, this is a step up from it with a nice holiday flair to it."
""
""
"Pours an extremely cloudy golden-orange with a single finger head that quickly dissipates. Very strong citrus notes but the witbeer style overwhelms any and all other flavors. up front. Mouthfeel is a tad chewy yet acidic. The aftertaste and finish is where this beer shines. Once the dust settles all the spices tend top pop. Recommended if you like the wheat style."
""
""
"an oddly spiced witbier, but it works for me. the pours is really cloudy, pale yellow, with a smallish white head. the nose is tons of orange peel, dried, with some typical winter ale spices as well, but the catch is that its a wheat beer with a hop kick as well. lots of wheat malt and spent yeast cells in the taste up front, spice comes in the middle, again with a lot of orange zest, and is quite hoppy in the finish, pleasantly and surprisingly. good carbonation, lighter than medium body, highly drinkable and frankly a very enjoyable beer. this is something distinct, i think new this year, but one that i would like to see stick around. i could be happy drinking this all winter. one of the highlights of this years winter mix."
""
""
"Overall: I think I would take it over the ole Samuel Adams White Ale, though just barely. Speaking of, is this its replacement? Gee, man, that's gotta be rough, being laid off on the holidays. Poor White Ale. Thanks, Obama!"
""
""
""
""

"O - A pretty solid representation of the style by SA. Much better than their White Ale. Nice to see a decent new seasonal from them after some abominable recent outings."
"Just Sam releasing two seasonals to take up more shelf space, the more limited of which (being this one along with their pumpkin and shandy) that are made for the masses with simple and relate-able ingredients and are on the sweet side. Sigh"
""
"I felt that some agitation may be in order so I poured about one-quarter into a lass, then began to swirl the beer while still in the bottle before resuming the pour. I ended with a finger-and-a-half of rocky, eggnog-colored head with good retention. Color was a VERY cloudy orangish-yellow. Nose held an interesting melange of spices with the cinnamon and nutmeg wrestling for dominance. Mouthfeel was medium but now it was the cinnamon and the orange peel fighting it out on my tongue. Finish had a pleasant nutmeg-driven vanilla-like flavor. I have to agree with a previous reviewer that allowing it to warm really brings forth the spices. A very nice holiday ale, worth checking out while in limited release."
"pours a cloudy darker golden color a one finger head that quickly faded to just a skim on top of the beer. a light lace which also faded quickly leaving a little here and there. smell was average with citrus, cinnamon, and nutmeg being picked up. taste from the wheat gave it a nice tang and there was a good balance of the other flavors and spice. mouthfeel was disappointing as the carbonation was sort of flat and not crisp and tight as it should have been also could have used a little more body to it. its a ok beer and it fits the witbier style but its not best out there buy a long shot."
"Pours a hazy bright yellow color with a half finger to one finger stark white head. The head leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is of corriander, citrus fruits, and at the back end hints of vanilla and nutmeg. The taste has to warm for all of the flavors to come out. The beer starts almost like their summer ale. There is corriander and citrus fruit with a hint of wheat. The back end is where the spices come out, cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla play out on the back end. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and crisp. Overall it is a solid beer, it was a good change of pace in the variety pack from all the heavy dark stuff."
""
"12 oz. bottle purchased as part of the Holiday mix pack. Pours a murky light yellow with a half inch of white head. Coriander, pith, citrus, and vanilla comprise the aroma in that order. Pith, yeast, vanilla, lemon, and coriander make the flavor. Medium in body and carbonation. Pretty good overall. Much better than Samuel Adams White."
""
"This beer really needs to warm to be truly appreciated. The orange peel and nutmeg are predominant in the nose, but the wheat malt and light floral notes from the hops. Undoubtedly the hops are contributing to the citrus as well. Because of the additives that make this a ""holiday"" beer, I'm not sure I'd think of it the same as a regular witbier. This is a very enjoyable quaff."
""
"O - This is a nice witbier. I like the effort to do something different for a winter seasonal."
""
"One of Sam Adams more successful seasonal beers. FAR better than the dreaded cranberry lambic."
"O - Overall, seems like a bit of a bastardization of the style. Tastes a bit ""artificial"" and forced to me. The added spices weigh things down and takes away much of the refreshment aspect I come to expect out of a witbier. Glad to have one, but think that is where it will end for me."
""
""
"Definitely a repeater."
""
"Worth trying for sure!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I thoroughly enjoyed this brew. So far, the Sam Adam's holiday pack has been outstanding. This particular beer is one of my favs so far. Highly recommended."
""
"Overall, 3.5s across the board. Unfortunately to me this just reeks of pumpkin ale all over again, so maybe I'm missing the point. It's an easy drinker for sure, and if this is the worst of the holiday mixer, I'll be pleased going forward."
""
"The color when poured was a hazy golden yellow with a reddish hue. The smell of sweet spices filled the nose with a very pleasant aroma. When tasted, there was yeasty nutmeg, cinnimon, with what seems to be a hint of allspice or corriander. What a pleasant, not to sweet or bitter. A well balance of component to make this years Christmas Ale a very, very pleasant surprise. Another winner from Boston Brewing."
"Atmosphere is pretty decent. Bubbly head, but no real lacing. Nose is bready, citrussy, and fall spicy. Flavor is bready with sweet, bittersweet, and earthy spice components. A bit of an off-putting aftertaste. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
""
""
"O: Not bad, decent holiday offering. Doesn't go overboard with the spices and drinks relatively easily. Actually pretty refreshing on this Thanksgiving night."
""
""
""
"Soft, wheaty malt up front. Light sweetness. Bready. Light clove and banana, before citrus and spice take over. Orange zest with some lemon. Muddled holiday spices (cinnamon and nutmeg, mostly). Bready, wheatiness reclaims the finish, with lingering spices and citrus. Medium bodied, with a protein-y wheat, smooth feel. Not as bad as I was expecting. Kind of a nice change of pace from all the porters, stouts, and Celebration I've been drinking lately!"
""
"Pours a hazy orange with a big frothy white head. The smell is dominated by the wheat with a good deal of orange, the cinnamon and nutmeg are secondary. The taste starts with the wheat and the citrus, the cinnamon and nutmeg are constant, and finishes with a peppery aftertaste. The finish has the citrus coming through a bit stronger. The beer is smooth for the most part, the finish with the peppery notes detract from the mouthfeel, but overall a nice blend. Overall a nice beer with good flavor, nothing that stands out, but a crisp beer that is enjoyable. Nothing amazing but still a quality beer."

"Not my favorite from the Winter Classics pack for sure but this isn't a bad beer..."
""
""
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint, golden yellow pour, medium head, light lacing. It has a sweet aroma, lots of cinoamon and clove. The cinamon and cloves are very prominant, lingering sweetness on the finish. The body is light, moderate carbonation, very sessionable. A very enjoyable beer, the spices worked for me, not really a traditional wit, but enjoyable."

"O: I remember that the very first Samuel Adams I ever had was White Ale, which I remember liking better than this. This is an off-spin of that white ale and a great beer for this type of year. Although, I do miss that Black & Brew!"
""
"This holiday beer is offered only a couple months per year so make sure to get your hands on some while it is still available. The taste is befitting of a holiday brew and the balance of flavors will prove agreeable to most who try it."
"Like I said, I like the balance, and the nutmeg and orange flavors I get make this good any time, in any weather. You really don't need to have a white Christmas to enjoy this beer. One of the better beers I've had from Samuel Adams, to be honest. The beginning of each sip is somewhat floral, but the finish is bready with a bit of cinnamon -- like cinnamon bread or something along those lines. Refreshing, easy to drink, and quite unique. Well done."

"Overall- I liked this one. I think I'll go get another one. An interesting ""lighter' take on a Christmas ale. Not overdone, and pretty refreshing and drinkable for a holiday brew."
""
"Wit Christmas? This beer is a hazy straw color with a brilliant white head. Plenty of effervescence, with clearly visible bubble streams. The smell is spicy, with a notable holiday bend (not a normal coriander wit, but instead a bit strong on nutmeg). The smell is sweet as well, with some pale malt and wheat notes, and a bit of citrus and stone fruit. The taste is solid. Better than expected....bready and mildly spicy. Good balance and very drinkable. Fuller in body than typical witbiers, but very appropriate. I enjoyed this more than I thought I would."
""
"Pours a cloudy, maize color. 2/3 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of strong lemon, citrus hops, sweet malt, hint of wheat, and slight spice (cinnamon and all spice). Fits the style of a Witbier. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, spices (cinnamon and all spice), hops, and slight citrus. Overall, good aroma, body, blend, and appearance."

"This was an interesting combination of a white ale and a spiced beer. I can’t say it’s too much different from the typical SA white except for the ramped up spice level."
""
"Overall- I liked this one. Solid winter seasonal from Sam Adams."
"O: A lot of nice qualities in this seasonal offering from Sam Adams. It doesn't have a very intriguing nose of flavor profile. It plays it on the safe side, but is a nice addition to the winter sampler pack."
""
""
""
""
"Really not bad. Not my favorite style, but this one is put together well."
""
"overall i am quite impressed at the attempt to meld together a wit with some holiday spices. if only this had some belgian yeast flair, then it would be dynamite. as it presents itself, it's just pretty good and definitley solid. i can only think that this would be a great drinker after some outdoor winter activity to quench a need and a thirst."

"Pours a hazy straw color with a thin white head that lingers a while. Smell is typical wit, citrus and clove, but then a hint of spices in the background especially cinnamon. Taste follows suite, lots of citrus up front with a fair amount of spice flavor towards the finish. Interesting flavor, definitely different than what I've had before, but just average in terms of taste. High carbonation, medium body, and a rather thick mouthfeel. It's worth trying I think, but I'll steer clear from now on, not a favorite by far, but an interesting use of the style."
""
"O: They really nailed what they were going for with the whole holiday spiced wit, but I'm not too sure it works within the style. It's enjoyable, but nowhere near what I expect a wit to be"
""
"O-i do not like this. its just off. it has a certain stickiness much like the sam adams winter lager. tastes very adjunct, and really nothing like what a witbier is supposed to taste like. its not refreshing at all. I started to think that Samuel Adams was slowly starting to make beer of better quality, but this beer reminds me that the brewery is only a step above the macros."
""
"Well, shit. If this were from another brewer the reviews would be a bit better, I think. I like to give credit where credit is due, and it's nice to see SA finally brewing one-offs that play to their strengths, instead of pitiably aping the styles that other brewers are doing. This is a Sam Adams beer, and a damn good one."
"But def a beer I'd buy again. I liked it a little more than the winter lager"
"Pours a murky light orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, citrus zest, and spices. Taste is much the same with a mild spice bitterness with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but nothing very Wintery in my opinion."
"Cheers!!"
"Overall – A well made and very drinkable beer. The flavours work well together and I could actually drink a few of these. Worth checking out."
""
""
"Poura a cloudy golden orange with a thin white head. Not much retention, and no laceing. Aroma is of citrus, and spice. Body is on the light side of medium with some carbonation. Taste is of orange peel, and spice. Tangy with a crisp refreshing flavor. Some hints of bready malts make this somthing differant,and very enjoyable. Merry Christmas!"
""
"This one has a huge citrus character that blends nicely with the wheaty malts. The spicing is not overdone, which is nice. This is easily the best Wit I've had from Sam Adams."

"Sam Adams witbier, all right all right. Pours out a dull straw color with a feeble head. Slightly transparent, decent haze. One whiff and I knew I had to take another...because I couldn't smell anything. On a deep inhale, I got some citrus and wet grains. Flavor is similarly nondescript, just a little tang upfront followed by a decidedly more pleasant husky grain finish. Does not really strike me as a wit, more like a mediocre hefe. Not that every wit should be a slave to the bananaclove flavor profile, but if you're going a different route, at least make it interesting. The strongest part of the flavor here is the mellow but long lingering wheaty aftertaste. The most notable feature of the beer as a whole is its incredible texture, which only makes me wonder what could have been if they had nailed the taste."

"O - Far from a miss. This beer gives a nice winter-styling to a traditional Witbier. I prefer the more notorious Belgian brothers of the style, but I do applaud this American adaptation."

"Overall I was unimpressed with this one. I had to choke down the last few sips. Not a winter style in my opinion, either."

Pours hazy yellow orange with a thick white head and lots of tiny bubbles. The head dissipates slowly. The flavor is an interesting taste on the classic witbier. The wheat malt backbone is there with juicy orange flavor. I get the cinnamon and nutmeg, but they are not overpowering. The spices instead complement the flavors of this beer well. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. The beer is very smooth and highly drinkable. This is a very good beer. Like a previous reviewer, I agree this beer gives us a reason to enjoy a wit in the winter."
""
"It's just weird to me. The spices make this something warm and cozy, but as a result, all the fresh, crispness that comes with a traditional white. It left me confused, even though it is good. I would certainly have this again though."

"O - A lot of wheat crammed into this brew. Aroma shows good complexity and traditional wit characters. Taste is dominated by wheat but finishes with a cool curveball. Great feel and appearance to the beer. Throws a good switch to a common summer style, a good excuse to enjoy wit in winter."

"An interesting varation of their white ale with spices and a mouthfeel that while very unique, doesn't quite fit the style all the way. A worthy effort regardless."

"O/D-Sam has put out a couple neat beers recently. This one is more dud than stud. 85% Witbier, 15% Winter Warmer. Weird little guy. Damnit, I can see two or three bottles from this six-pack becoming refugees in the fridge for a month or so."
"O - I think the beer is good. I can't say I would buy it again though. Tasty, looks good, smells inviting. The whole cinnamon/winter spice thing in a white beer come off a bit strange to me. Sam Adams makes it work decently though. Worth a try. Cheers!"

"Drinkability is awesome on this Christmas Ale. A great load of spices with a lower alcohol than most, makes this beer one to drink a 6 pack or more of. Great selection that I am glad I got a 6 pack of. I need to get to the store to get more before its out."
""
""
"Overall: An interesting new offering from Sam Adams. It's an interesting concept to remove the normal witbier spices, like coriander, and replace them with winter warmer spices, like cinnamon and nutmeg. I think it mostly works here and this is a beer that I definitely wouldn't mind having again or seeing in the mixed packs."
""
""
"Taste-Orange peel, nutmeg, cinnamon, spicy wheat. An interesting ""lighter' take on a Christmas ale. Not overdone, and pretty refreshing and drinkable for a holiday brew. Flavor gets a little muddled upon warming. Not a great fireside brew, but suitable for a holiday ""refresher"" or opening gifts on a warm Christmas day in the tropics."
""
"A novel idea that just doesn't work. I really wish Boston Beer would stop with the forced wheat seasonals. This might work as a blonde, lager, or porter but as a wit it just doesn't...at least for me."
"It came in the Sam Adams winter pack, and overall I like it, but I'm not positive I would go buy a six pack of it."
"Overall - Not very impressed. Reminiscent of their Harvest Pumpkin ale, minus the hints of pumpkin. Is it drinkable? Yeah, but I wouldn't want to buy it again, and I'm hoping it's a one-and-done in the Winter pack."

"It's 84 degrees out here in Florida. Christmas? Why not! White Christmas pours a golden-white color with a finger of head. The aroma is heavily spiced with all the usual suspects - cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, etc. There's also a strong orange aroma here as well. The flavor is very well-composed, the bouquet of holiday spices interact well with the strong orange flavors. The aftertaste is the nicest part of the beer, with the orange, a touch of wheat, and a bit of lingering spice leaving a very good impression. The mouthfeel is light and moderately carbonated, and the drinkability is good. Overall, White Christmas is a nice holiday beer. I'm not sure it needs to be with the fairly similar Old Fezziwig and Winter Lager, but it's tasty and well-done. Balance is the name of the game here."
"I think it's way the hell too early for Bing-o to be crooning his signature at me, but that's a vain argument for another time. This stuff pours a hazy golden straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises orange zest, coriander, light wheat, and a pinch each of black pepper and clove. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some brown sugar and some fairly strong ginger. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, though nothing is necessarily outstanding here, this beer was pretty tasty and enjoyable. The spices are definitely present, but they're also balanced against the citrus-y wheat so they don't get out of hand. Not bad."
