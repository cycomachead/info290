"On tap at Toone in Brussels"
""
""
""
"One of my favorite light beers. A better blue moon.  Justified."
""

"Manneken Pis pours pale cloudy straw with a hefty 3” finely bubbled pure white foam cap. The nose is bready and spicy with orange peel and citrus notes. It has a very creamy palate with white bread, orange, citrus and spice up front and finishing with a refreshing tartness. Light bodied and effervescent."

"Overall : One of my favorite Witbier, perfect while eating."
"Comparable with other leading Belgian whites"
"This is amazing belgian ale. The best witbier I ever tried!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: As Belgian witbiers go, you could do a lot worse than this - although I like Hoegaarden and its ilk, this just seems to be a cut above them. Would be a go-to witbier if it were more readily available, and I'd certainly have no hesitation about having it on tap."

"Generally a fan of the style.  This one was pretty good.  Very clean and smooth, sweet and somewhere between orange and lemon in the taste.  A little spice (coriander?) does not really stand out but lingers.  Very tasty, refreshing and easy to drink.  Optimal summer beer.  A little thin or maybe I would say flat.  Extremely enjoyable beer that I would gladly enjoy at anytime.  If you like wheat/hefe/wit this is a good one, if you want hop move on."
""
""
"Really effing tasty"
""
"I love the look of this! Hazy, thick head with amazing retention. A pear like, light honey and straw yellow blend. The carbonation looks so lively; like an alka seltzer tablet was dropped inside! Aroma is citrusy and sugary  sweet, especially orange. Not surprising considering the bottle says it was brewed with orange peel. Tasty is mostly citrusy and orange sweet. A very refreshing taste, like an orange soda. (I mean this in a good way) Feel is creamy and smooth. The carbonation really settles and there is very little left towards the end of the beer. I drank this on a super cold east coast mid November evening. I could see how this beer would be even better in the summer. However, I had it with a light and healthy meal of broiled salmon, Brussel sprouts and pear salad and they complemented each other nicely."

"11/14/12  On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Lovely light lemony flavor. Where was this wonderfulness during the summer?"

"I had this on tap at Garaje in SF. I find the spice notes overpowering in most white ales. Not this one. It's not as good, or as complex, as Allagash White but definitely a quality beer. Overall, I can't imagine a better session beer for a hot day. I would not hesitate to pick up a six pack for soaking up some sun, if I knew where to find one."

"The first thing I noticed in this beer is the lack of any yeasty flavor/aroma which is a huge plus in my book. Lovely bright color and a faint aroma of orange peel. Couldn't quite taste the coriander but it didn't bother me too much. Overall, a very refreshing beer."

"Light  body, high carbonation. Overall a refreshing, flavorful witbier. A good summer drink that I would gladly have again, especially on a hot day."
"Flavors of Apple, Ginger, Lemon, Soft Coriander. Super Clean Finish. Great Session Beer."
""
"Too wheaty and citrusy for me."

"One of my favorite beers so far."
""
""
""
""
""
"Kind of a Disney-esque rendition of the style, the coriander and wheat malt sweetness more or less exaggerated for our amusement, it would seem. Easy to drink, but not all that complex, as duly noted, and not something I could see myself repeating, outside of the goofy marketing trope that sucked me in here."

"Pours straw golden color with a thick foamy head. The head dissipates after a few minutes with effervescent bubbles rising to the top. Smell of Belgian yeasts and coriander. There is a slightly sour component to it. Strong malty, banana taste up front, follow by moderate carbonation, with a spicy coriander taste at the end. Very refreshing beer. High carbonation. Witbiers were my first foray into craft beers (Hoegaarden), but I have moved on to other tastes, mainly hoppy IPAs and Pale Ales. This beer provides a refreshing, nostalgic feel, though."

"I am not normally a huge fan of witbiers as I find the coriander taste to be a little unpalatable. But this beer is a change. It is quite tasty and really refreshing. Nothing extraordinary, but certainly very drinkable and a great option on a hot day."
""

"The hint of coriander brings out a crisp clean flavor when served with and orange slice, lemon slice, or just by itself. When I'm sitting by the pool in the summer I call it my lemonade because it's so refreshing. The Belgians make the best beer and chocolate in the world and this beer is my favorite white/wit. Served by the can is not as flavorful as the glass bottle or the tap..."

"Overall: Very nice, drinkable witbier. Nothing too exciting, but certainly nothing offensive"
""
""
""
"Overall: Easy, fresh and simple. Nothing too exciting, random, but does it's job."
""
"Pours a pale straw color with small foamy head that fades to bits of lacing. Aroma of fruit, some coriander, wheat, spice and touch of yeast. Taste of citrus, fruit and spice with some wheat. Mild bitterness with a tart finish. Fairly light body, quite smooth with a bit of a grainy texture. Decent beer for the style but nothing special."
""
""
"I don't usually like witbier and to be honest I bought this thinking it was a sour because of the name. Still, turned out to be quite refreshing. I really love the smell but it dissipates quickly and the head as well. Flavor wise this is pretty good."
""
""

"Tasty Witbier, good for a change even if you have a preferred brand given its originality."

"Excellent beer. Slight hint of orange with a defined wheat taste and a slight creamy aftertaste. I've had this in a bottle a long time ago and remembered the aftertaste being a little stronger. In the can it is a little subtle as is the taste as a whole. Had it been a little stronger, I would have rated this a 5. Overall still an excellent beer in a can or a bottle"

"Drinkability is great a clasic wit exhibiting all the best characteristics. Pretty mich a qentissential seession beer for me, although I could use the orange dialed back a touch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I complained to the bar about it and got this beer off of my tab. I couldn't imagine that the bar messed it up as it seems to be a brewing problem. I'll definitely re-review when I have this again. Undrinkable obviously with the diacetyl."

"A lawnmowing beer, if cold"
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Heavily carbonated, with bubbles that feel large on the tongue. This counterbalances the full bodied feel from the suspended matter floating around in the beer. I think I would want to have just slightly less carbonation to emphasize the unfiltrated nature rather than seem to diminish its effects. As I kept drinking this and the carbonation started to come out of the beer, it started tasting more how I wanted it to. Overall, this is a good beer and above average, but certainly less than anything astoundingly notable."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer is truly a classic that one can enjoy from time to time. I know I will."
""
""
""
""
"I've recommended this beer so many times that I've forgotten I haven't actually had it myself. Wow. Anyway, this stuff pours a cloudy straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises cracked wheat, coriander, clove, lemon zest, and a pinch of black pepper. The taste brings in more of the same, with the emphasis placed on the spices, though the lemony wheat surely isn't mild. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly drying finish. Overall, a solid, spicy wit, worthy of all of those recommendations I've given out in the past."
""
"In all, a slightly less than balanced brew from Lefebvre SA that I expected more of. By no means is it bad, but when it warms it becomes brain-ier than expected. Surprisingly disappointed for my four pack that costs around $12."
"Had this after mowing the lawn. It hit the spot on a nice spring day. Light and refreshing with good fruit flavor."
"O: 3.5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lots of spice flavor in this one with peppercorn, coriander and citrus making up the main taste. Not bad but a bit unbalanced and thin feeling."
"O: Nice refreshing summer beer. Not the best Wit i've had but I would feel at home sessioning a few of these on the porch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap in Belgium this beer of course reminds you of a typical Belgian Wit. Light yellow with that unfiltered cloudy appearance. Aromas of wheat and definitely orange peel. Similar taste with the only distinguishing feature of this one is it is a little hoppier than most. I like the style but nothing exciting stands out with this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a nice beer, very reasonably priced and comes in a can for summer drinking. Worth a try."
"Overall, this is a respectable, no-thrills witbier. The essentials are there, but they're a little out of balance, and the body is lacking. Probably would go better with a warm summer's day than an unseasonably cool spring evening."

"Overall / Drinkability: Solidly above average Witbier. Tasty, very drinkable. I could have had another easily, but I was seduced by all the other beers on the menu. I can imagine this would be quite good with food. Only the aroma was a letdown."
""
"I love beer, i got to know the bartenders pretty well at my go to pub and one of them suggested Blanche to me...I immediately fell in love...hands down my favorite beer. No matter what time of year hot or cold climate...i've only ever had this beer on tap but would love to try it other ways...I highly suggest also trying this beer with a shot of a Strawberry Lambic...sooo good!!!!"
""
""
""
""
"Manakin pis is actually pretty good - nice and light - more of a hot weather beverage, though"
""
""
""
"It has an unexpected pale yellow color and cloudiness from the high level of wheat used. The bitter orange added during brewing comes across nicely balanced. This is a good beer as a break from all the heavier winter beers while still being appropriate for the season."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Poured from a 16.5 oz. can. Has a cloudy yellow/whiteish color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of spices, some fruits. Taste is smooth and refreshing, spices, mild fruits, highly drinkable. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall this is a solid beer"
""

"A rather mediocre witbier, even coming from Belgium. The other person I had this with told me it tasted like ""rice"" as it warmed up. While I don't exactly agree, it does indeed get grainier and more astringent as it sits, and none of the yeasty phenolic notes intended for these types of beers end up sprouting out. For the price ($8), it's not the worst, but it is sadly underwhelming overall."

"O - this beer serves every purpose. One can sip it and spend time distinguishing its special characteristics and one can just as easily grab a bunch of tallboys and knock them back without thinking about it (especially given the pleasantly-low ABV). Very impressive, can't wait for all beer to come in cans..."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from pint can into a goblet. This pours a clear light yellow color with a large but short lived white head. The smells are crisp fruity, light citrus with a few spices. The feel is medium with tingly carbonination. The taste is light also but decent a little wheat, some sourness, a little citrus but all crisp and light, not bad but I prefer a slightly bolder beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a really easy drinking beer. The funkiness of this beer can be a bit overwhelming at times, but overall it's a pretty darn good beer. I drink this again if given the opportunity, but I'm not going to go out of my way to buy it."
""
"Very refreshing and I could see drinking this again."
"Cloudy pale yellow color with decent white wheat beer head that well tolerates before gradually subsiding to thin foamy layer atop, the appearance looks familiar to other typical Belgian wheat beers. However, upon a sniff, it blows a surprisingly inviting aroma comprising of banana, orange, coriander and some spice, well mellow. The taste is good and quite exquisite by the fruity estery touch leading by banana, orange peel along with some spice from coriander and clove. Hop plays behind a curtain by adding vague bitterness. Medium in term of body rejuvenating the palate with lively carbonation and dry finish, on-tap makes it much fresh, fruity, sweet and mellow, my salutation for the brewer making this thing out so simple but same time with many details to challenge the taste buds."
""
""
""
""
"500ml can. Pours a hazy pale yellow with a large slowly dissipating white head. Aroma is of wheat, Belgian yeast, sweet citrus lemony, with some light ripe banana notes. Taste is sweet light peppery fruity, wheat, yeast some light grassy notes and a bit of light tartness. A crisp light peppery body with some mild carbonation on the palate. Finish is sweet lightly spicy fruitiness, Belgian yeast, wheat a and bit of tartness ending with some sweet ripe tart banana notes. Overall a good light refreshing brew"
""
"Refreshing yet mostly unsatisfying. Judging from the bottle content the little Urinator on the label seems to be there with a reason, warning the drinker what he/she may expect."
"16oz can, pours a cloudy, pale golden yellow with a tall, fizzy, white head that holds good retention, but leaves little lacing on the glass. Aromas are wheat, spice, coriander, grassy, fresh, lemony citrus. Tastes are lemon (lemonade-like), wheat, spice, yeast. Body is full - maybe a little too full, it is very smooth and creamy though. Overall, nice to try, but probably wouldn't buy it again."
"Smooth for a wit and a bit fuller, this is a good brew. Afteraste is a really nice, mellow fade from the taste, no surprises."
""
""
"Overall, a different, yet nice take on the style."
"Mouthfeel is light, water-like, refreshing. Drinkability is super high."
""
""
""
"Recommended witbier. I don't typically enjoy the orange-y sweet versions of the style. This one's a bit drier, and I must liken it to a true Belgian Blue Moon. The beer to get all of you Coors drinkers away from that particular beer and into something a little more complex."
""
"The main thing this has going for it is the flavor; its different. I feel like its dominated by blueberries. Like everywhere. Fresh blueberries. A bit of underlying yeast, but its all an odd blueberry flavor just everywhere."
""
""
""
""
"I will readily cop to having agitated the CAN as I wanted any lees to be in suspension and not flocculated at the bottom of the CAN. As a result, The Crack unleashed a brief spray of beer and foam before I could get The Glug started. No CANsualties were reported and soon I had what CAN only be described as Lemon Meringue Pie in a glass! I was looking at a finger of flluffy, dense, bone white head with excellent retention above a cloudy pale-lemon yellow liquid. Nose was quite musty, very yeast-driven. Mouthfeel was creamy, like soft serve ice cream or instant pudding and the taste was of bananas and old newspapers, very musty. Wild! Finish was semi-dry and the mustiness really lingered, plus a lemony tartness began to come through. As a self-avowed hophead, one would be plenty, but for those who enjoy this style, having it in a CAN makes it a good choice for the beach."
"Bottom Line: If you like Blue Moon this is all you."
""
"Beer is light with a grainy finish, not a great wit but a decent one for the price, interesting overall but I don't think I""d have it again."
"a super super light beer, would need gallons of this to get drunk or full, which isnt necessarily a minus. pours cloudy and glowing pale pale yellow in color, 2 inch white head. smell is quite citrusy, with lots of belgian yeast making things exciting. flavor is the same as the nose, yeasty and fruit, insanely light. i wanted more from this beer in terms of flavor, its good, but its watered down i think. feel is very very light on body, with pretty bright carbonation and some creamy texture. this is one of the easiest drinking belgian beers ive tastes. a pretty good with overall, but so many others can do the trick just as well or better. this was good, but i had higher hopes."
"O - Nice Belgian wit. Not much complexity here but it's very crisp and enjoyable, especially on a hot summer day."
"Lemonade like appearance poured from a 16 ounce pounder can, labeled straight Blanche de Bruxelles leaving out the Manneken Pis terminology. Beautiful pearl white head forming thick and cloud like arising out of my Belgian chalice like rising dough bread. Aroma especially citric/tropical fruit is really nice. Cookie dough, coriander, earthy herbal hints a very complex witbier, this may change some minds about the style. Spicy yeast complexity with a touch of acidity rising out of my glass. Flavors are bright with apricot, lemon and a creamy wheat flavor that really balances things out along with yeast esters and spice additions especially the coriander. Actually leaves ample bitterness with the spice, lingering on definitely complex. Mouthfeel is creamy texture, medium bodied tight flowing carbonation. Overall impression of this beer is excellent a grade A witbier, like I said this one may just change some minds for those who say they don't like this style."
""
"The palate opens crisp, ultra light and quite refreshing. Flavors of coriander, rose water, citrus (less bitter orange peel and more ripe oranges and orange juice). The mid-palate is a little watery with a cracker-like wheat character. Quenching and crisply carbonated, this beer finishes a little watery with a light coriander note, a little bit of orange fruitiness and a touch of wheat tartness. Quite nice, very drinkable."
""
"Overall I don't understand all the latest hate on this beer. It's got a good balanced taste, sessionable ABV, and even now comes in a can! Will have to look for this when I need something light to pound with a ton of balanced flavors!"
""
""
""
"Overall: this beer is OK, and it seems well-enough crafted, but its flavor profile is not really what I look for in a witbier. This seriously tastes like someone poured a shot of cointreau into a Hoegaarden."
""
""
""
"Very cloudy Belgian white with an underpowered malt background providing a sweetish taste(which is decent, definitely enjoyable at the right time) and cloying sweet mouthfeel(definitely not so good). Overall a decent beer for cooling off, nothing to write home about."
"M: medium body, however it needs to be served cold like 4 degree, after it gets a bit warmer, I can sense the alcohol in my mouth, brings less peasure."
"Blanche de Bruxelles might not have a Y chromosome but it's a damn pleasant beer to drink, especially when the weather is nice. It probably belongs more so at a table of Jupiler drinkers than it does St. Bernardus but in all honesty falls somewhere between the two, like a witbier flavored lager. Recommended pairings: thirst, sun and patio."

"330ml bottle.Oversized glass.Enjoyed on jul´11. Pale straw color. Cloudy. White froth.Lasting crown is dense.Creamy lacing rings. Coriander, vanilla & slightly orangish aromas.Slightly acidic,subtle butter,sweet caramel malt & bread. Medium body.Cloying sweetness. Apricot notes on the aftertaste.Not as refreshing as expected."
""
""
""

"Again, there are no surprises here, not outstanding for the style but one could certainly do worse."

"I recommend this wit. It is one of my favorites, now."
"Belgian lawnmower beer."

"Pours a murky whitish orange with a 1 inch white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin broken rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of jasmine tea, perfume, and light citrus fruits. Taste is pretty much the same and to me this tastes very much like jasmine tea. This beer has a light level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but it really doesn't seem like beer in some regards."
"Medium body, slightly higher carbonation, refreshing and zesty on the tongue. A highly drinkable and tasty beer - this would be nice on a spring/summer day."
""
"A hazy straw color with a soapy white head. Smells of fresh wheat and a bit of lemon. Sweet bread flavors start the flavors out, followed by some spicy coriander, and a lemony finish. Mouthfeel is smooth. Overall a good witbeer. I would get this again."
""
""
""
""
"O: This might very well be the best witbier I ever had. I had this beer in the fridge for over 12 months, I don't know if it changed anything to the beer because it seems very awesome and the reviews seem to show it's more of a ""meh"" beer. Anyway..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's not a beer that I will fiend for in the future, or really remember again until I see it, but I definitely wouldn't turn it down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavor is nuanced and layered, with coriander, sage, citrus zest all playing in the background a pleasing melody. Wonderful, sweet finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well... like that label says, it is white. It is also cloudy with two generous fingers of head. There is some good retention and lacing. The nose is pretty bland - nothing much going on here. There is subtle orange flavor upfront, but it tastes pretty bland as well. There is a nice bitter finish which is the best part of this offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just not what I was expecting in this Belgian White. Poured an hazy yellow white color with very little foam. The flavor was sort of flat, with a sour/bitter taste and very little in the flavor department. The smell had a yeasty aroma and not much of anything else! To a well balance ale, lacking flavor, aroma in all departments!"
""
"Notes: This beer has more body than other witbiers that I have tried. Subtle carbonation lends a very silky mouthfeel. Tasty and quite refreshing. One of the most drinkable beers of this style that I have had to date."
""
"Overall Impression- An average Witbier until the finish and it was ruined! Overly priced as well for this one... I will not be returning for another one of these ever and will probably steer people away from this if I were to see it on-tap/bottle. There are plenty of other Witbiers out there, why not enjoy the good ones!"
"I would recommend giving this one a try. It could almost suffice, in terms of refreshment, as a glass of water on a hot day."
"This beer poured out with a nice hazy yellow color to it. The head was fizzy and white but does have a bit of retention and lacing. The smell of this beer had a nice fresh citrus aroma to it with healthy does of yeast on the nose. The taste of the beer is lightly flavors with what seems to be lemons and has a good amount of wheat in the aftertaste to smooth things out. The mouthfeel is light bodied, refreshing, smooth and drinkable just about whenever. Overall I'd only wanna have this in the warmer months but it is a nice brew all around. Not bad!"
"The color befits the label, which is a treasure. A boy peeing. It has that color. But the taste is right there where it should be. Fruity, yeasty, hoppy. Very nice and clean. This is one to try when you want to try some of the lighter side."
"11.2 ounce bottle. I found a single of this so I thought I'd try it. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a cloudy straw gold color with about an inch white head. Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing. The brew smells like wheat, lemon and orange peel, and coriander. It tastes like oranges, orange peel, coriander, wheat and lemon peel. I think I pick up more orange/orange peel in the flavor of this beer compared to the other witbiers I've had in the past. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's crisp and pretty easy to drink. I think it's a good, refreshing beer, I'd buy this again. It's a good choice to drink on a hot day, or any day."
"Overall- A very nice little witbeir. You could drink a lot of this and not get bored."
"Overall, for someone who may not like stronger citrus/banana taste in the wit beers, this beer would be a good choice. I think I will drink this a bit more often during the summer as opposed to the more mainstreamed fare you can find in grocery stores."
"I'm sorry, but the beer keeps on screaming: drink me!"
"This Witbier pours as a cloudy, pale yellow and has a light white lacing. The aroma gives off a slightly sour smell that isn’t off-putting. Within the aroma you also get a mild orange peel smell, some lemon zest and a faint spiciness from the coriander. When you take a sip, the sourness from the aroma show’s itself slightly in the taste, but isn’t overpowering. Once that fades, you get an enjoyable balance between lemon and citrus that’s light in body and leaves the tongue clean. Malts also give this beer a slightly sweet taste that doesn’t take over."
"Presentation: Packaged in a 335 ml Euro-style long-neck bottle, served in a standard Pilsener glass."
"Overall a great beer here."
"This is probably my favorite witbier, and is truly an exceptional beverage. The added fruitiness isn't exactly to style but it is pleasant nonetheless. My favorite thing about this beer compared with other members of the style is that it avoids vegetal coriander notes, which are common in most witbiers (but shouldn't be!). Delicious, refreshing, thirst-quenching, and near-perfect."
"D - Very enjoyable and extremely easy to drink. Session for sure."
"D - Great stuff; unique and flavorful; one can be enjoyed once in a while"
"Poured out in a wineglass this beer looks like a whitebeer should. Two finger head and a cloudy yellow fluid with no carbonation. Citrusnotes together with koriander. Some sweetness in this beer but very nice to drink."
"MO- Everything except the taste of this fits the bill for a wit. It just isn't that tasty and refreshing."
"Pale yellow transparent. Lemony nose with wheat to identify the Witbier the first lick. The lemon in the nose is reminiscent of lemon meringue. Her mouth is smaller, just with the zest of citrus and wheat and smooth without bitterness or spice. Lack of personality in the body and structure but easy to drink."
"very good refreshing beer in the summer, however, may accompany dishes with a delicate flavor even in cold weather."
"Super easy to drink. Thirst quenching. Could pound a number of these at one time. A summer beer. Nothing complicated and rather straight forward."
"O - A very nice wit, maybe the best wit Ive had. This brew has a nice balance and mixture of flavors and quenches the thirst."
"My wife had this one on tap last Tuesday afternoon at the Wynkoop Brewery. Served in a tulip, poured a cloudy, hazy pale straw color with a big white head. Aromas of coriander, wheat and light citrus. Well carbonated and light bodied, with flavors of wheat, citrus and coriander."
"This beer is a strange one, it's what I imagine most homebrewers are actually producing every time I hear ""Oberon Clone"". The orange peel coriander combo punch is very present and almost overwhelms the light sensibilities of this particular brew. The head and carbonation were pretty cool, it was light and foamy and effervescent. Drinkable in the spring or after mowing my yard, this is very refreshing and delicate. Nice color and all that jazz. hops? Meh, not all that distinguishable. Pretty good beer."
"Despite its unique qualities it is very drinkable. I am excited to try it again soon!"
"Drink - Just an average beer. I'm happy I gave it a shot, but I wouldn't seek it out again."
"GRADE (BOTTLED): D"
"It's not a beer with a lot of sizzle. Hop-heads should look elsewhere. But this does what a beer should - it satisfies and leaves me wanting more."
"I love wits, and this one does it right. Love the orange, and really love the high amounts of coriander. This is one of the best I've had."
"Moderate in alcohol content. Excellent choice for those that love wheat beer."
"Drink- Very nice for the style. Will have to have it again during the hot summer months."
"The presentation of the lemon in this beer is the best I've had. It makes the beer have a refreshing quality, and it's fantastic for throwing in the middle of a beer session in between heavy stouts/tripels, a real palate cleanser. If you're looking for a beer thats ""refreshing", where do you turn? Coors light? Ugh. No. Every other refreshing beer has distinctive flaws. Try Blanche de Bruxelles."
"D - Very sessionable and approchable but I'd probably prefer the Hoegaarden Witbier in comparison (4)"
"Mouthfeel was OK, as was the drinkability. Seems to be in the line of Maes Pils as a Belgian session beer. It's better than most of them, but I'd rather have one or two less of the stronger beers."
"A good summer standard, especially with fish."
"Taste also has a strong, citric orange presence. Plenty of coriander, pretty unique wit. Strangely attractive for me though, like it is more enjoyable than it should be...a case of the whole being greater than the sum of it's parts. Has a nice, refreshing tartness. Mouthfeel is creamy and supremely smooth. The more I drink, the more I like it. Even though this is not the first time I have had this, it is a wonderful surprise, borderline excellent! Even though this is a bit pricey, I will be buying it again soon."
"D - Very easy going and refreshing as well. Would recommend it."
"D - This is a very nice example of a style that is often overly spiced and too sweet. There is a nice, subtle malt character with a thick, creamy body that American interpretations often lack. The spices are present, but the coriander is bright and lemony and the orange peel is so subtle that it is only really noticeable in the aftertaste. This beer serves as a pleasant reminder that Wit beer can be enjoyable when brewed with skill and restraint."
"Very easy to drink and quite refreshing."
"d- okay, glad to have tried this, but i wouldn't get it again. it's a bit weak flavor wise, i would choose several others over this."
"D: light and drinkable, although I think the sweetness detracts and lowers this score."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and is also quite refreshing and thirst quenching."
"drinkability/overal: the sweetness in the front of this beer hits me in a not so great way, especially proceeding the peppery finish its just not working for me. a good representation of the style i suppose but not something i would recommend."
"D: Perfect on a long hot day."
"As expected, very drinkable and refreshing Wit. Really enjoyed it."
"D: If these weren't so darn expensive in my area, this would be my preferred witbier for the summer, at least for now. Loved Hoegaarden, but it's availability made it easy to acquire, thus the palate got bored. Still, this one and Hoegaarden are the major examples of classic witbiers."
"D - Exceptional! Every quality of this beer is nonintrusive and mellow. Soft aromas, taste, and mouthfeel makes this go down very, very easily."
"Crisp, clean, well made...a very nice example of the style, made for those days when you need a thirst quencher. Very drinkable and enjoyable...would go well with fish, oysters, shrimp dishes and curries."
"D - Perfectly drinkable on any occasion, especially during the summer. It's a great, smooth, and easily drinkable witbier!"
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a tulip glass a hazy straw yellow with a thin diminishing off-white head. Aroma is sweet malts and fruits with mild spice. The taste is sweet fruits and spice with a decent citrus finish. The beer is medium bodied with mild carbonation. This is a good refreshing Summer brew to say the least."
"The drinkability is exceptional -- a very tasty beer with a relatively low ABV but a lot of well-balanced flavor that develops as you drink it. A great beer for a summer day."
"Good to start with the style but not its finest"
"A nice, solid and pretty mellow witbier. Nothing amazing, but good and affordable."
"D) Wonderful summer ale. Low alcohol content says its okay, have another."
"At the Eulogy Tavern in Philadelphia. Into a stemmed glass, poured a cloudy yellow with a finger of white head and great retention. The nose wasn't that pronounced, but some hints of clove, coriander, and apricot. The taste was more bountiful, with big traces of apricot as well as clove and coriander, and a big apricot, modestly dry finish. Looked like a thin beer, but the surprisingly full/medium body was impressive. Decent beer for sessioning, if you love apricot flavor."
"Drinkability: Despite being too sweet and orange-like, it is still very refreshing and a nice Witbier overall."
"D- a delightful offering welcomed at a time when blue moon is seeing a surge in popularity around here thanks to some artsy new television commercials. that's ok. this beer doesn't need an orange to enhance or accentuate it's flavor. it doesn't need viagra either. it's soft and timid and fantastically drinkable with a cool summery dryness. lovely brew all around."
"drinkablity is high, especially on a hot day, i would drink another if i had one on hand, great for pairing with meals as well - overall very nice"
"Very light color and high carbonation as is the style. Extremely drinkable for lunch. Low in alcohol and light in color and density. I'll definitely have this one again."
"D- This is a nice summertime refresher. I would gladly drink this over and over on a long summer day. Do yourself a favor and try it. Easy drinking and lower ABV means you can drink this for long while before having to switch to something else."
"Drinkability personified. Poured from the bottle into my footed beer glass. Awesome one inch pillowy head. No lacing to speak of. Smell was light with a citrus and coriander nose. Heavy on the citrus. Taste was delicious and light and refreshing. Mouthfeel was light as well. The best thing though was drinkability. Light, delicious, Belgian, great for a hot day."
"Overall I'm a little disappointed by this one. Not one of the better witbiers I've tried."
"This is an excellent wit. Cloudy as expected. The color was lighter than I expected and is misleading of the flavor to come. I was shocked at the amount of flavor from such a light beer. There's a complex and fruity character with a hint of almost rye character with some sweetness. The nose is inviting, but subtle. Lacy head stayed with the beer to the bottom of the glass. Soft and silky mouth-feel with an almost dessert wine appeal."
"Overall this was a solid wit and makes me wonder why I so rarely visit the style. I'll be having a few more of these in the coming months I'm sure. Worth a shot."
"d: Everything was here, there just wasn't quite enough of it."
"D: Great example of the style; I'd choose this over Blue Moon or Hoegaarden anyday."
"On warming. Like I said above, I was served a really tall one of these, so I have the chance to monitor the changes in flavor. Half down, it has concentrated on the curacao, drying out and gaining a yeasty character which was overpowered in the beginning. This continues to grow as we warm together. At this point, I have to say that the original pour was way too cold, overbalancing to the citrus. At about 50 F the balance is very nice, with all flavors mixing to a shallow body commensurate with the overall style."
"D- I love this style...I could drink this all day. Preferably on a beautiful warm summer day. Great beer."
"I think this would be a great beer to get smashed on, but not to sit and enjoy."
"Darn tasty and very drinkable. This beer also tasted great in a fried fish beer-batter."
"D: Refreshing, even in the winter."
"overall a pretty good witbier."
"D: Incredibly drinkable at 4.5% ABV. Have a handful and enjoy."
"D: This is an okay beer for what it is; it's quite drinkable but I'm not sure it's one I would want to drink that much of anyway."
"Overall: I really liked the taste, as it's got a good balance between lightness and flavor. It manages to feel light, but still be moderately bodied while mixing in an unobtrusive citrus flavor."
"D: The last time I had this, it was on tap and sandwiched between two much stronger beers. Because of that, it came across as too light and not flavorful enough. This time; however, I had it alone and was able to appreciate its true qualities. A perfect refresher on a warm day."
"On Tap at the new House of Brews."
"Blache de Bruxelles pours out a very pale straw color with good carbonation and a thick head. Its aroma is dominated by the herbal lemon of coriander, followed by some bitter orange and spicy, raw wheat. The flavor follows the aroma. With strong coriander that is very pleasing, not obnoxious. Tart, spicy wheat and yeast in the background. As with other aged wit beers - malt, wheat, hops, and yeast flavors have greatly faded leaving the coriander and citrus to dominate the profile. These flavors appear to intensify over time, but though they demand your attention, they do not ruin the experience, but rather become the experience."
"A very crisp and refreshing drink, with 4.5 something you could drink more than one and still be able to labor in the yard afterward."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale orange color. The head is a fluffy white could of foam that recedes slowly leaving nice lacing. The aroma is of coriander, some orange peel, and a little wheaty tang. It is a nice aroma, and true to style. However, it lacks a a certain vibrancy that would make it great. The taste is like the aroma, but with more orange/lemon notes. Still, there seems to be something missing. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a velvety texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a decent witbier that I could drink again without many complaints."
"D: A very solid wit. Worth seeking out."
"D - dangerous in that i REALLY wanted another."
"A exemplary witbier."
"Overall not a bad Witbier, highly refreshing, for me it is on par with Wittekerke, just ahead of Hoegaarden."
"D - This beer is extremely drinkable, especially on tap, where I think this beer really shines; out of the bottle, I would give this one a B+"
"Drink ability is good. Extremely session able and light. Not the best or most complex witbier but its still good."
"Pours a hazy yellow straw color with a small fluffy white head. Some decent lacing on the glass. The head would die down, but a couple swirls of the glass and it would return. Smells kind of orange with bread, spice and floral hop aroma kicked in. There is something a little bit off in the aroma...almost buttery sweet, it just took me back a little. A very nice orange, citrus flavor at first up front with a muted hop and coriander spice flavor on a distant sweet malt backbone. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, but would have to swirl the glass a few times to get that effect, otherwise is was a tad bit thin. Good drinkability. It's tasty, but the sweet orange flavor is sort of wearing me out towards the end of the glass. Might have a few of these though if I was out on the patio on a hot day."
"Light bodied with medium carbonation and a somewhat dry, crisp finish. Another highly drinkable option for the summer days. I mean this isn't necessarily top of the line stuff but its hard to argue with this one on a hot day. Worth a try."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable, could easily do a session with this one. I had two with dinner (lamb and roasted veggies) and it was the perfect accompaniment."
"D - Killer summertime drinkablilty. Somewhat boring for a high class brew... based on the bottle, I expected more complexity, but this is a very nice brew nonetheless. Dont get me wrong, this is a really good brew, but when something from Belgium is corked and caged I expect a little more."
"D- Very high. This is a good, slightly lighter alternative to Hoegarden. In my opinion, it is different enough to be considered one fine Belgian wit."
"Drinkability: This is a pleasant enough witbier to be drinkable and satisfying but but it is not one I'd go out of my way to seek out, but f it came my way I'd be fine with having another."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable... perfect for one of the first warm spring days of the year."
"D= This is a good example of this style. More tart than other wits I have had, but it was very drinkable."
"It goes down without trouble, but that's something of a disappointment. I like some bumps and bruises along the way. Something that really asserts itself, but this does not."
"Good to pair pasta!"
"C'mon, who could resist a beer with the Mannekin Pis fountain on it? At least it wasn't pisswasser! Anyhow, the 11.2oz bottle poured an excessively pale to straw cloudy yellow with a dense white bubbly head. The aroma was very mild, but a flowery sweet lemon & ginger. The taste was smooth,near-flat and a mild yeast wheat, a bit sweet, but not tacky. Smooth, bright & soft, this wheat mated with pilsner & flowery herbs left a nose full of grandma perfume afterwards. Weird summery beer that left my wife a little surprised as well...In fact, her response, was ""what a 'gay beer'"" (see: ""In Brugges"")."
"D- At 4.5% I could drink this all day in the summer if my pocket could afford it. This is probably just as good if not better off of a fresh tap. A fine example of a wit."
"11.2 oz. bottle, best by 6/19/2008, sampled a month before that date. Brewed with ""barley malt, wheat (40%), hop, sugar, yeast, coriander, curaçao."" Pours a pale sunshine hue, with a few dregs, light carbonation (despite being an etched glass), and a half-inch cap of bone-white head. Nice spicy aroma, a little sweet, with a light dose of wheat. Coriander and wheat are noticeable on the palate, with barley in the middle and orange showing up later. Very tasty, but way too mild. It has a lightish body, with medium carbonation and a short, lightly spicy finish. Not too bad of a beer, and pretty refreshing, but not the best witbier around."
"This witbier is a good one to drink while socializing, listening to some live music or just passing some time on a lazy afternoon."
"Pours a hazy yellow with a big, quick rush of bubbles resulting in a mountain of white head which peaks well above the rim. Retention is excellent, with some wavy, thick sheets of lace forming right above the cloud of head which is left behind. Aroma involves lemon, coriander, apples and wheat. Tastes a slight bit tangy, but not as bold as the smell. There's also some subtle sweet malts, lemon and then small amounts of coriander finishing things off. This beer could use a bit more umph in the taste department, but its light-bodied and superbly drinkable, which can lead to a perfect fit for some occasions."
"Notes were definitely lemon and coriander. Very clean finish...I enjoyed this beer, would make a great session beer...would recommend! if your're a Belgian White lover..."
"Hazy pale yellow ""white"" with a 1/2"" white head that falls to 1/4"" and holds there. Lemony citrus, ripe orange and a spiciness in the back of the nose. Bready malt..wheat..fruit and citrus middle and a spicy finish, no slouch on flavor. Medium body with mid to high carbonation level. Good witbier..glad it is available."
"D- Very drinkable for this style of beer. Even if you aren't a fan of this style give it a try. It is excellent."
"Poured a light straw color with a decent head and small amounts of yeast swimming throughout. It was a citrusy, lemony smell. It had a rereshing quality and was a bit yeasty. Moderate carbonation and a smooth finish. I would be able to drink several of these especially with the low abv and refreshing quality it has. Solid example of the style."
"D - This is a very good Wit that tastes very good and thats very easy to drink very sessionable worth trying"
"This beer looks whitish with pale sunshine highlights. Just awesome bubbling in this close to opaque colored beer. Great, bubbly, almost merengue-like head and quick yet all encompassing lacing. The aroma makes me think of creamy wheat and tart yeast. The taste is equally as interesting. Very creamy an tart texture. Citrus and grains of paradise plus this sweet to tart yeast character adds even more complexity to this wit. One of the best looking wits I've ever seen. Because of the weird texture for this style and some of the flavors of this beer, its not as drinkable as I expected."
"D: This isn't my favorite witbier in the world. It lacks true character in the taste department. It has some good points, but it's not that great."
"D - Very drinkable, but not a Witbier Grand Cru"
"Poured into a taster from a 750 ml bottle. It was a unfiltered whitish pinkish orange coloration and the foam began as a good amount reducing to a lingering aftermath on the surface. The aroma was one of blends with orange and coriander. Taste of this beer was like a grass, orange zest and light amounts of coriander. There was a good aftertaste of the beer as it left."
"Bottle from Cava Wine Bar in Capitola. Poured into a Witkap Pater goblet. Hazy white peach flesh color with an eggshell head that leaves some nice gobs of lace. Mild aroma, mainly grassy and zesty with some orange peel. Not a lot of coriander here oddly enough. Flavor is mealy wheat and some spiciness, grass and yeast. The flavors don't really fit together quite right, like they're out of proportion to each other. It's not enough to really nail down and explain but it's enough to easily tell that this is rather inferior to, say, St Bernardus' witbier. Average palate."
"Pours a cloudy yellow with a white head and seemingly a lot of carbonation. Smell is of orange, wheat and slightly skunky. Luckly, the skunk doesn't transfer over into the taste. The taste is solid for a wit. Not too strong, but still good. Overall, a good wit."
"I would have to say this is my favorite of the Wit beers I've had here.The aroma of orange peel and spice was just right.I could honestly drink this all summer long.I would strongly suggest you give this brew a chance."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Light on the palate and very refreshing, this one is everything that it should be (although it might be a bit too light). Carbonation is delicate and clean, not quite crisp, as that would imply more of a cleaning and highly fizzy feel. This one is easy to drink, but if I want a good wit I'm not going to go with this one. It just doesn't do it for me. There are may others out there that I prefer to this one. Plus, for the price, I think that this is way overpriced. I'll be sticking with Wittekerke and Holy Moses until I find something that I like better."
"Drinkability - as good as the standard wit but nothing to pay extra for."
"M&D- Feel is light-medium and very drinkable with light carbonation"
"I would recommend this beer. I do think that the main thing that stands out though is the appearance over anything else."
"D - Between the tanginess and carbonation could only drink one. Otherwise else, very delectable."
"The taste is sweet to a slightly dry finish. It has bananas and spices with a lightly perfumy sweet citrus quality then a wheat-grain finish and lingering aftertaste. The flavour is persistent but light. It's a little oily and very soft in the feel, the softness soon becoming exceedingly tiresome, as does the light but persistent sweet ornage-flower element. This beer seems basically good but it does nothing for me and I can't drink much of it."
"Any beer with the image of a cherrub pee-ing shows the sense of humor that is worthy of a purchase. It pours a very murky straw color with some rusty hues mixed in. The carbonation forms a subtle head that fades quickly with a bit of lacing. Aromas are very sweet with wheat and barley, spicy with pepper, corriander, orange peel, and yeastiness. Very bready and richly flavored with hints of lemon zest, acidic citrus notes, and with an earthy, pungent, herbal hop character that rounds out the sweetness but also gives a less-than-clean distraction. Heavier weighted than most Witbiers, but much maltier too with some unresolved sugars. Finishes sweet and spicy with a lingering hop, lemon, and bready note. Pretty good, it kinda steer toward St. Bernardus' Witbier, but stops shy of it's balance and quality. Certainly a non-offensive beer that should be tried at least once."
"D: Crisp, refreshing and a sweet drinking wit that definitely hits the spot making for a summertime quencher and worthy of a six pack recommendation."
"Pours a cloudy light yellow color with a one finger white head comprised of little bubbles with good retention. Lots of sweet orange aromas with some floral notes in the background. There is a sweet orange flavor up front mixed with honey and corriander and a sour orange peel finish. High carbonation, light body, a refreshing mouth cleansing beer. Solid drinkability, the contrast from the sweet orange beginning and the sour orange ending is interesting and well done. Worth a try."
"Pours a hazy bright lemon yellow with a scant single finger head that dissipates rather quickly. Nose is lemony and crisp with notes of coriander. Taste is about the same as the smell, not too much depth here. It is light bodied with a fair amount of carbonation to hold it up. Overall, I like it and it appeals to me as a decent brew to drink on one of those boiling hot summer afternoons."
"This is a unique witbier. It is not like a typical witbier and has an artificial candy flavoring, which I don't mind all that much at first, but gets to be a bit annoying after a while."
"This is a decent enough brew, but it is a strange interpretation of a wit. The sweetness is a bit much to keep this on the refreshing side, and without the top note of coriander to balance out the citrus peel I almost feel like I'm drinking some kind of flavored beer."
"D: Really refreshing, pretty light. Leaves a slight astringency in the back of the mouth."
"Pours a light orange color, generating a small head that tapers off quickly. It's bright, may need your shades. Aroma is fruity, dominated by oranges with some bananas mixed in. First thing that stands out is a thin, watery mouthfeel. That is backed up by a citrus combination but the top flavors are certainly oranges and mango. It tastes like a semi-sweet orange, with a bland flavor. There may be a dash of cinamon spice in there but that may be a reach. It is refreshing enough but I was expecting more. This is also priced to be an above average beer and I feel it falls short of that."
"Pours a pale, cloudy yellow with few creamy inches of good head. The smell is understated, and has hints of cream and vanilla. Taste is surprising for a wit. Cream and vanilla are prominent with a brief sourness which I didn't expect. It's a thick-feeling beverage with low carbonation, making it fairly filling and still decently refreshing."
"The drink is softly carbonated,crisp and refreshing with excellent drinkability."
"Taste is very citrus and smooth. In mouth, the bubbles are very present. The beer is refreshing. Good summer beer for light drinking."
"Pours a haze pale yellow/orange color. Decent amount of foam and light lacing. Smell of unmalted wheat, a bit of graininess, including a faint dogfood smell. Slight coriander and citrus. Taste of pale malts and wheat, slightly sugary, a bit of orange, and not much else. An ok wit, but not anywhere near a favorite."
" Not the greatest,but it held it's own."
"D, Notes: An overall bland and uninspiring wit."
"Citrus zest to the taste as well, combined with spice, all following an up front carbonation. While this white ale was exceptionally crisp and refreshing, it just seemed... a bit one note, to me. The spicing wasn't as complex or well-rounded as I would have liked."
"D: Drinkable, I enjoyed that this beer was different from what I was expecting but I'm not sure it was in my wheelhouse. I would recommend it but I'm not sure I'll be having again."
"Blanche De Bruxelles is a disappointment because it lacks... witbieriness. A better base beer would be a good place to start. More orange peel and more coriander would be a good place to finish. There are much better versions available for your warm weather drinking pleasure."
"This is an extremely light blond/gold almost white beer that's very cloudy and has a good white head on top with some good lacing as well and lots of carbonation; this is what an angelic beer would look like to me. It had some lemon/orange aromas to it, some mild wheat, a very faint skunk aroma almost like Heineken, and some dry alcohol aromas as well. I first got a few hints of banana on the tip of my tongue, some mildly tangy citrus and spice flavors overall, it was very smooth, not crisp, but very refreshing; it has a bitter aftertaste and a medium body leaning on the light side a bit."
"Bottle. Cloudy yellow orange color with a full, fluffy head of foam. Subtle nose, mainly dominated by citrus. Butter toffee, orange and lemon hints in the mouth. Pretty nicely balanced between sweet and bitter. A fairly decent white ale, not one I'd buy again but it's well crafted."
"Served in my Warsteiner pilsener glass. Poured a pale gold color. Three-inch dense, bright white head with lots of tiny bubbles effervescing in the solution. Good retention, with some spirals of lacing present during the session. Strong scents of citric acid and spice up front. Coriander, orange peel and a peppery character, followed by a clean, wheat presence in the background. Mouthfeel is light and effervescent with a mild astringency. Extremely sessionable wit. Might make this a summer staple as the weather warms."
"Monk's/$6 (?)/16 oz"
"This is a bit on the citrus side for me, but would definitely be a great brew for a hot summer day."
"A pretty good witbier, it went well with today's warm weather after I got off work. Next time I'm in a mood for a wit, I'll remember this one."
"Plentiful flavor, much delight on the tongue. Good witbier!"
"It almost lacks character, but has enough overall to be pleasant enough. A nice enough example of a milder example of the style, though weak at points."
"D - This is a decent witbier. It's slightly above the average example, but perhaps doesn't stand out too much. It's very well done and refreshing though."
"A truly average beer in flavor, no real reason to try another."
"Nice lightish body and high drinkability. I seem to remember the bottles version having a bit more complexity."
"On the label there is a picture of a man pissing."
"Dare I say that this is the best wheat beer I've had thus far? I prefer the lighter wheat flavors. One of the easier beers to try."
"This beer was much more flavorful and enjoyable on-tap. The bootle version leaves a lot to be desired."
"Mouthfeel is OK and drinkability too."
"This is not the Manniken Pis that we used to get. That stuff was IT! This isn't too bad a substitute, but still it ain't it. Pale hazy yellow in color, white head and decent lace. Slightly sweet and tart. Not too thin. Drinkable. Some citrus but little spicyness."
"D: Definitely can do this on a warm day over again"
"Poured into a pils glass to an almost clear body with hints of yellow. A large amount of carbonation that caused a two-finger, rocky head that left no lacings. Orange peel sticks out in the nose, as does a faint trace of other fruit (lemon and banana?), but there are spices in there. Didn't really pick up corriander, like the label says, but I picked up faint traces of clove and vanilla. Orange peel and citric fruits mainly in the taste department, and with the hops only getting minimally involved despite the heavy carbonation, this is a very smooth, easy drinking beer that is complemented by a small amount of spices. Not the greatest witbier, but a fine good drink and I could easily be downing a few of these with buddies on a warm day chillin' outside (pardon the oxymoronic pun)."
"I'm parting company with most of the reviewers of this beer. This beer is pale in color, very pale, and the taste matches the appearance. There is an ultra white frothy head with some lacing and retention. This beer is also quite cloudy. The aroma is off in that I'm getting an elmer's glue whiff on top of the slight citrus imparts of the pineapple family. The taste is just weak, watery, and transparent. There just isn't enough to this beer. There isn't much ""there"" in this experience. There are some spices, maybe a little allspice, there is a touch of pinapple, maybe some coriander, but it is all so subdued, there isn't much to write about. I'm disappointed in this beer. I was hoping for quite a bit more."
"Overall a wonderful, gentle and lively Wit that I'm glad to be reunited with (formerly Mannekin Pis). So soft and lovely. So welcoming and playful. Its clean and upbeat flavors can either be stretched and savored, or quaffed and gulped. Whatever your pace or speed, this ale's got something for everybody. I very much feel 'at home' with this beer. OK, now I'm REALLY ready for spring!"
"D: With a bit more subtlety in the coriander flavor this beer could be a terrific drinker. As is it is still a pretty enjoyable beer."
"Verdict-not much in the flavor or aroma department, but incredibly refreshing, light-bodied, low-alcohol beer that goes down very easy. If you normally buy Becks Light or Amstel light as your ""drinking beer"" try this one instead and knock back a few."
"Very good beer. Poured a white-ish, yellow color with a nice 1 inch head. The smell was of fresh citrus fruit and hay.. and the taste was great. Not too sweet like I had anticipated, but very mellow and well-balanced. Definitely a beer that I would recommend."
"wow, big surprise on this one! ... . very easy drinking ... somewhat tart but youthfully fruity... . low lacing .. . a very nice witbier that seems to have all its ducks in a row .. .. recommended if you can find it on tap!! '..how can we be down 2 to city on the 50th anniv??'"
" D: will buy this one again, well worth it, tasty, light, refreshing...like gatorade for the drinker"
"Overall, not really bad, but I wouldn't order a bottle again. Maybe I'd try it on tap, to see if it's any better."
"Very drinkable beer but seems stale for the style. The characteristic fruity/citrus notes are flat and the orange peel bitter seems missing. The medium full mouth feel is nice and appropriate indicating oats in the recipe."
"Pours a clouded straw gold with a white head. Nose is like immature grass that has been cut. Not green grass, like a yellow grass that is still maturing. Flavor is mild with character. Subdued wheat flavors with a mild yeast. Feel is thick on the mouth as there seems to be a residue almost that clings to your mouth. A decent one, but nothing to run to the store to get. Nice to drink, but no Oscar winner."
"Very pale yellow in color. Nice head on top. Fruit and orange are hinted in the aroma. This witbier is lightly flavored of coriander, much of the flavor involves fruit. There's some tart lemon in there and a brush of ctrus. Much of the bitterness comes from the carbonation in the beer, which is pleasant. A fine witbier."
"A 24k gold beer in this chicks book. A smooth Belgium unfiltered wheat. Add a lemon or not, still great. Probably hard to find, but worth trying to find. Previous favorite was Hoogaerden. There are probably some even better Belgium wits but can't say enough good things about this one."
"A hard-to-find Belgian in my area, copped a four-pack for about $9.00... Glad to find it, as it poured a nice witbier creamy, hazy lemon color with a soft head... Smell is very pepperish, with coriander and lemon aftertones that are very noticeable... Taste is definitely good... nice wheaty, fruity flavors that are apparent but not overwhelming... This beer is not bursting with flavor, but definitely has a pleasing and enjoyable taste that is very drinkable and has a nice mouthfeel... a light beer that would be great during the summer but can be enjoyed any time... Would certainly go for it, even though the price was kind of high... Recommended..."
"Pale translucent yellow with a moderate, soapy head that gives little lace. Smell is slightly wheatish, but the characteristic spice of a wit is not particularly noticeable. Some yeast, minimal coriander, citrus finish. Thin bodied mouthfeel, light overall. Easy to drink, but undistinguished. Not much point to this one."
"Drinkability: Light and refreshing; a decent wit."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easy, not filling at all, very good representation of style, mild kick, this is an excellent beer to drink for an entire evening. Its flavorful, light and wont have you on the way to getting buried after the first three or four of them."
"Poured into a nonic glass. It appears cloudy and glowing yellow/orange much like a hefewiezen. About 1/4 inch bright white head sticks around as well as to the sides of the glass as it goes down. Nice texture, smooth. The flavor of yeast isn't overbearing, yet it is still a big player in the flavor of the beer. Subtle coriander and citrus poke through, although it doesn't quite taste as well placed as some Wits I've had before. A good sessionable, cheap belgian wit. Not shabby."
"Review added 11-14-2007, translated from french 1-26-2008"
"Not recommended. A boring beer on most fronts - not event he yeasty quality saves it."
"It was about the only thing at Monk's during a weekday lunch that wouldn't knock me on my arse, so I went this route. And I have to say, I could have done better. I didn't expect it to really stand up to Thai Curry mussels, but it didn't even show any effort. There's just not enough there. And yet, under different circumstances, it would drink readily and inoffensively. Still, the next time I'm in that situation, I'll have a brawny Belgian and deal with the consequences."
"poured a slightly hazy golden yellow with a thin white head that disappated fairly quickly. Mild nose with scents of lemon coriander, some orange peel perhaps and spice. Lemon and spice, on the tongue with a medium dry finish. A pretty highly carbonated beer with an active mouth feel. While it is extremely easy to drink, it's not something I will actively seek out, how ever if I just come upon it in a bar with only a few brews on tap, theres a good chance I'll take a pint"
"D: One of the better wits I have had out of Belgium, funny label too, any fan of wits should try this beer, very tasty, and easy to drink."
" Pale ""straw"" yellow. The glassware is frosted so its hard to tell how hazy but I would assume it follows the style. Aroma of citrus and light hop bitterness. Taste follows suit with light citrus and typical wit spice. Faint acidity like a lambic but nowhere as pronounced. Very light body that washes clean from the mouth. Very easy drinking beer. I enjoyed this as a change from more intense beers but not one to keep in my repotoir."
"Poured a pale cloudy golden with a wispy pure white head and spotty lacing. Subdued lemon, orange, and coriander on the nose. Taste is similar to the aroma, but a little more bland. Slightly grainy, a little watery, emphasis on the coriander here, which carries through to the finish while the fruit drops off. Spritzy mouthfeel, but the overall effect is of a soft beer. Nothing special, there are plenty of better Wits."
"Overall- Not bad, but 1 glass will do. Just too sweet for me."
"[Served chilled, in a wheat ale glass]"
"Obviously the label art is a winner with me..."
"never even heard of this one, on tap at Raleigh Times"
"I think this is definitely my favorite mass-marketed Belgian White. Hoegaarden used to be such a good beer until it was bought by AB. For those that don't know, AB shut down the Hoegaarden Brewery and now brews it at the Stella brewery. It looks and tastes a lot different. What a shame. I dont miss it too much though, as I was a bigger fan of Blanche de Bruxelles anyway. Great white, cloudy color and perfect crisp taste all the way through."
"Manila paper colored and foamy. Candy tangerine marshmallow aromas lead to estery bubblegum and fermented vanilla scents. On the palate it's dry, tart and round with obligatory coriander, wilted orange and chipped chalk flavors. It gets the job done. Nothing horrible."
"33 cl bottle dated best before July 3, 2008. Pours a nice lemony yellow with a lasting, pillowy off-white head. Excellent retention, stickage and lacing. Lightly perfumy aroma amidst a healthy dosage of tart citrus, coriander and unmalted+malted wheat. Lightly dusty in taste, this witbier has all the qualities of a summertime champion. Semi-sweet maltiness with the light spicing you'd expect from a witbier with a slight suggestion of vanilla nearer the finish. Citrus comes into play, but not as pronounced in flavor as some other witbiers. Nice creamy mouthfeel. I'm surprised I haven't noticed this one before."
"11.2oz. Pours a cloudy and very whitish pale yellow color with a nice white head. The aroma is wheat with some coriander, spices, and yeast. The taste is very refreshing with some wheat, citrus and spice flavors. Mouthfeel is light bodied and crisp from the carbonation. Drinkability is very high, this would be a perfect beer for the hot summer outdoors here in Florida. Overall, this is a pretty solid wit that is recommended."
"Drinkability: Certainly not the best wit out there, but a reasonable beer nonetheless"
"Easy to drink and low alcohol, but unmemorable overall."
"D- Easy to down several of these, on the other hand. That is, if it's affordable enough for you. I would rather have some other beers, IMHO."
"D- I could drink the four pack these 11.2oz bottles came in. But I'll share at least 2 of these."
"According to the label, this is a Belgian Wit beer brewed with orange peel and coriander. How can something that sounds so simple taste so good? This is the brewer's art. This pours an opaque yellow with a fine white head that dissipates quickly. The smell is faintly citrussy. The taste is wheaty with some orange and lemon notes. I found it to be well balanced and highly drinkeable. As good a wit as I've ever had."
"Poured into a pint glass from a bottle. The beer pours a very hazy white/straw, forming a creamy 1 inch head, leaving medium spots of lace. The aroma is light citric wheat. Not too strong or complex. The taste is mostly of lemon and orange, with a slight hopiness. Smooth medium mouthfeel. Very easy to drink. Overall, this is a good witbier. I will definitely be having this again."
"Pours a cloudy straw yellow color with a fluffy white head. In the nose it was all about orange, citrus and corriander. A dry taste and a small coriander taste. It even had a small tartness to it. Very easy to drink, better than most Belgian wits because of the citrus and the small tartness."
"D- This beer has a light and crisp flavor but it is very subtle and bland."
"From my notes 6/5/2007 pours two-finger white head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Light cloudy amber color. Sour citric nose. Light carbonation and light bodied. Flavor is sourish wheat, not what I was expecting. 330ml bottle for 2.50 ($3.43) from Manneken Pis souvenir shop Brussels, Belgium."
"Pours out a hazy lemonade with lots of bubbles rising to the top which maintain the foamy head. There is lots of lacing going everywhere. Smells really sweet and fruity with a hint of Evangeline Maid white bread, which is kind of nauseating. Citrus stands out more than coriander. Tastes candy sweet and reminds me of cotton candy in the flavor (or, better yet, cotton candy flavored Bubble Yum). Coriander comes out a bit more than in the aroma, but the citrus is ever present. Really, there isn't much more I get from this, and, seriously, that cotton candy bubble gum flavor is out of control. Too much of that white bread thing is making me gaggy. Mouthfeel is almost too smooth. Really watery here. There is no way I'd buy this again."
"White yellow with a creamy head. In the immortal words of my buddy Rick, ""it looks like lemon merangue"". The smell is lemon peel and coriander. Refreshing and crisp. The taste has the citrus zing you expect from the style but a malt that you don't. It smooths out the flavor and reminds me of a kolsch. The mouthfeel is creamy but a bit thin. The drinkability is good but its much better when the beer is cold. And I say that as a fan of beers that belong at cellar temperature. Good but not great."
"Quite sour and still so sweet. Lot of layered flavors, interesting but not the easiest beer to drink."
"D - Overall, I'm not impressed. Nothing glaringly wrong with this beer. Maybe it just not in my taste profile."
"D: Grabbed this without any other impetus than wanting to try a new witbier - should have passed. Nothing worth coming back to here..."
"Pours pale straw yellow with a small and short-llived thin head. The nose is full of soft oranges and wheat grain shot through with faint clove notes. Flavor is also very gentle. Oranges and creamed wheat with very slight pepper and clove notes. Weak on the spiciness overall. The mouth-feel is pulpy and velvety; not enough carbonation. Dull but passable."
"D - I certainly won't bother with this one again, almost no flavor. It is bland at best."
"Notes: What Hoegaarden used to be...I recall drinking Hoegaarden for the first time in 1995 and it was a revelation. Over a decade later, Hoegaarden is a shadow of its former self, watery and insipid. Its downfall is well documented, but I reminisce because this beer reminds me of what was good and right about Hoegaarden back then. Its floral and light, yet has surprising, thirst quenching depth for the style. Tasted on tap at the Gingerman in Austin, TX."
"Overall: Has potential, but I prefer more flavor. This just didn't do it for me."
"Pours light gold, almost a yellow color, with a slight greenish tinge. Bright white head that fades to a collar. The aroma is quite citrusy, although it seems citrusy more from the yeast used than from added spices. There's an undercurrent of coriander, but nothing overpowering. All in all the aroma is rather simple and slight. On the palate, very brisk acidity that is unbalanced with spicy softness. Some banana flavors pop up, but from the mid-palate on this beer is pretty watery and bland, and provides nothing to impress. The finish is a touch sweet and vinous. Mouthfeel is thin and lacks enough carbonation to make up for it. Overall, I'm not too impressed with this. It's OK, certainly not bad, but it has little to recommend it over other wheat beers."
"Not crap but nothing to pay $6 for. I am sticking with Allagash or Legacy for my Wit fix."
"Poured from a 33cl bottle with a best by date on the back label. The label was interesting with a drawing of a man pissing on it. Not sure that sends the message I'd want on my beer but to each his own. It poured the usual wit beer white and had a decent head that quickly settled. The smell had the expected coriander and orange peel but the orange had a different smell that other wits. Not sure if they used another type of orange or what but it wasn't all that pleasing so a little hit on the smell score. The taste was pretty good but lacked a good finish that would have gotten a better rating. Overall, it's a good but not great beer. I really enjoy wits and could see these having a once in awhile place in the rotation. (4, RR, T, Y)"
"A quite decent Wit."
"Served up in a pint glass with a fluffy white head and chalky cloudiness. Smelled a bit of lemon, grass, a tiny bit of grain, and some coriander. It was faint, but this style has always relied on subtlety. The taste was along the same lines of the smell but a bit more pronounced, and maybe a little more grain and some subtle orange peel. A little bit of yeast is there to round out the mouthfeel and balance the acidity of the citrus. Finishes dry. I can't wait to pick this up in bottles just in time for the summer."
"Overall, a very drinkable session beer. Wonderful on a hot day. While it lacks some of the spicy characteristics of other beers of the style, it is still a fine and worthwhile brew."
"Overall Impression: Just what I needed after a long hot walk! My numbers are probably skewed given particulars of my experience, but arent they all?"
"Appearance of this beer is a mere understatement. It's not only hazy, it's grayish, and the head is gray, not white as may be expected from a White Ale. Smell is modest, yeasty-citric. But the taste rewards you: after a spritzy sweetish start you're pleased with natural acidity and rich fruity-spicy tones. Aftertaste is equally pleasant. Perfect summer beer."
"Draught in Nice, France, as ""Bière Blanche de Floreffe"". Served with a quarter slice of lemon, which I instantly pulled out of the glass. Hazy pale colour. Pleasant lemony aroma, some spice too. Moderate citrussy flavour, faint notes of coriander. Drinkable and refreshing, but not a ""big"" beer."
"BB 07-09-2006. White head that's not to stable but a good white cloudy pale golden beer make presentation avarage. Nose is lots of orange, wheat, koreander amd litle sourish. Creamy and litle banana complete the smell. Taste is also litle flat and not 100% fresh but well drinkable havind lots of orange peals mostly sweet in it, wheat & (barley)malt, sour note and litle earthy. Drinkable but flat mouthfeel also missing carbon dioxide and taste. Overal a drinkable wheatbeer but dull IMO and rather go for something with litle more creativety."
"Bottle: Poured a light hazy yellow ale with a medium head and very little retention. Aroma is bit weak with some wheat and some orange being noticeable. Taste is also a bit weak with some wheat again and medium sweetness. Lack some character to make it truly special."
"The beer pours from the ¼ Liter brown bottle a cloudless gold with a massive bright white head that is creamy in texture, lace forms a tight sheet to conceal the glass. Nose has crisp malt sweetness and a slight hint of yeast, crisp and clean to the senses, start is nicely malt laden and somewhat sweet, the top is light to moderate in feel. Finish is stern in its acidity with a modest hop presence, a decent drinking beer."
"Pours a cloudy very pale yellow under a surprisingly short-lived one finger white head that was little more than fizz. The nose is yeasty, and fairly subdued. The mouth is painfully carbonated and lightly sweet. Tastes a lot like watered down tonic water. There's a touch of malt and a hint of yeast in the taste somewhere, but this is mainly soda. I detected no hops. The aftertaste is yeasty. Yup, quite a bit of yeast. Sure, lots of yeast. Not much other than yeast. My wife, the wheat beer fan, tried it and said ""you're kidding."" Maybe it was a joke..."
"I was in Brussels on a Saturday morning so I stopped in the first pub that had some decent food and a wit beer. Why a wit beer, well it is nice and light, with a fruitiness and pleasant spiciness from the wheat and added spices, and more importantly it was morning and it seemed an appropriate breakfast beer. This Wit was a nice cloudy whitish color and had a hint of refreshing acidity. It had a bit more body than I typically associate with a wit, but it did have a nice mild spicing to it. I must admit it was not incredible, but it was definitely satisfying."
"Acquired in the Philly Gathering Beer Exchange."
"Appearance: Pours a cloudy pale yellow in color and spritzy white lace. On the nose there are hints of lemon and orange peel. On the palate the taste is crisp, fruity, coriander, orange peels, lemon, low malt character. Mouth feel is crisp and sprtizydecent brew."
"A very light and refreshing beer. Good for the summer and hot days. Good anytime really. Very enjoyable with a clean finish to it."
" Cheers to the BA Victory Beer Exchange for the sample."
"This beer poured into the glass a watered down lemonade color. Its clarity is in 2 stages: 1) beginning first pour  crystal clear, 2) last pour where it becomes cloudy. The head was a creamy, thick and snow white in color. It lasted from first sip to the last and created a nice creamy lace on the insides of the glass. The aromas that came from the glass were of bananas, spices, light malt, citrus  lemons, and fresh baked wheat bread. The tastes were almost exactly the same. Flavors of bananas and cloves (like a creamy banana cream pie), sour lemons (light), pepper, hops, grain (like a wheat field), and a hint of alcohol all rolled over my tongue. It left very little to no aftertaste. Good carbonation, crisp and light. A good beer and decent representative of the style. Quenched my thirst."
"Don't get me wrong; this is a very refreshing brew that would best be consumed on a nice hot summer day. I just feel there are better interpretations of the style to be had. Should be tried, if for nothing else, the kid takin a wiz on the label."
"Spicy, lemon cented toilet cleaner aroma. Sweetish, spicy, toilet taste (not that i've ever drank toilet water). Strange, fizzy, definitely not a good example of the style (IMHO), but i suppose it has its moments."
"A very nice Belgian. Belgians know how to make beer, that's for sure. The Kid whizzing on the label is a classic. I heard that the story is that some little kid whizzed to put out a fire, thus saving the whole town. I wonder if they let the kid have one of these brews...hmmm?  The new bottles are sans the kid whizzing....too bad.  A refreshing white."
"Notes: A very delightful palate of complex flavours, an ease to drink ... enjoy this fine creation."
