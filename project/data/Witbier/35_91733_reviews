"Interesting? A beer that's overwhelmed by the spices. Not bad, but nothing I'd go out of my way for again. Decent enough."

""

"Overall nice tasting beer to start off your day!!"
""
""
"As it stands right now, this is my favorite beer. Came home to my parents house after months away and found one in the refrigerator, haven't seen another one since. Wonderfully balanced and the flavor is near perfect. Good for any time of the year, summer especially good."

"Something to session or introduce with and probably better on a hot day, but not a flawed beer, just not super interesting."

"Interesting. Not the kind of thing I could see myself having more than one of in a sitting, and all of the flavoring makes me eager to try cooking with it."
"Bottle: Poured a light golden color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of coriander and sage is quite dominant with light sweet wheat malt notes also noticeable. Taste is also dominated by sage with quite a bit of coriander, light orange peel and light wheat malt with some light residual sugar notes. Body is light with good carbonation. Quite enjoyed the spice mix but a fuller malt profile would have also been beneficial."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
""
"O-As it warms the balance gets worse and worse."
""
""
"For the style, i do not think this beer delivers anything spectacular. pours a pale golden color with a thin, white head that disappears quickly. initial pour provided an intriguing blast of sage, with citrus notes and some grain mixed in as well. across the palate i get less of the rounded wheat characteristics from other examples of this style, but it isn't substantially off. corriander spice and citurs are the primary flavors wafting across the palate as the beer goes down; would not have guessed there is rye in the mash. easy drinking and inoffensive, this beer would refresh on a summer afternoon, but won't cause revelation."

"Overall - worth trying, but not something I need to have again. It was OK, refreshing enough, and good enough beer to drink. A couple was enough, though."
""
""
""
"Overall - Interesting enough to warrant trying once. Not something I'd buy a six pack of though."
"This beer has a lot going on and feels kind of like a bunch of ingredients thrown together rather than one cohesive taste. Drinkable and a bit refreshing even but not something I will seek out again. The 2 in the summer sampler pack were enough."
""
"Bottom line, I really don't enjoy this beer much. Too sweet and too many competing flavor profiles take away from this."
"Overall: Enjoyed more than I had anticipated. What can I say, I like a little sage from time to time."

"O - Not bad, not great. The witbier element is too subtle. It's more of a spiced beer than anything else. With that said, it is easy to drink and refreshing on a warm day."
"Overall this is a nice little pool side brew. I like the sage addition - it plays pretty well in this brew. Definitely worth a shot."
""
""
"O: A decent beer. A good entry into the spiciness of rye malt without being overpowering. Good summer beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D- I don't know what the hell is going on with this one. Way too heavy handed with the sage. Maybe if the formula was actually a witbier with just a hint of the herb then MAYBE. This one is all out of whack."
"Taste starts out with a light citrusy presence, rye is a bit more noticeable in the taste but isn't really a strong presence nor adds enough spiciness to be a twist on a witbier, carbonation is nice and high, bit of an odd bitterness in the aftertaste (the kind from eating the rind of an orange peel)."
"Overall: A unique twist on the wheat ale style. The spices kind of overpower everything but the taste is decent overall."
""
""
""
""
""

"O - a fairly decent wheat beer; tasty and refreshing"
"Overall: I’m not a fan of this beer, mainly because I don’t like Belgian whitbiers and German weissbiers. That being said, the flavors are interesting and I’m assuming that it’s a pretty good example of what a Belgian-style whitbier is supposed to taste like."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good beer. Not sure why this beer has such mediocre reviews. For a summer beer in a taster pack, this is really solid. I'd definitely buy a six pack of this for hot summer sipping."

"12oz bottle best before December. Served in imperial pint glass. Beer is pale yellow and just slightly cloudy, with a very thin white head. Aroma is of lemon and orange peel, with a hint of coriander in the back, but nothing to blow away your senses. Ooh, very fizzy. And once I get through the intense carbonation the coriander flavor is really dominant. And past that the beer is way sweet. I find the herbaceousness is the harshest part of this beer, and along with the intense carbonation it makes for an outright unpleasant drink. I find myself wanting either higher more hops to up the raw IBUs of this beer, or simply higher attenuation to dry it out. Oh, and the label promised a rye beer, but there's only the most subtle rye flavor hiding behind all this sweetness and flavoring nonsense. I guess the idea of a rye wit was novel but I'll pass next time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The extra spice makes this one unique but still another pretty mediocre, over-orangey witbier."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability- It was ok. I would drink it again but probably wouldn't buy it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a interesting take, similar to philadelphia brewing company's fleur de lehigh, the rye is interesting take."
""
""
""
"Overall, an okay wit. Too much spice for me, however. I'd only want one of these."
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured this Witbier from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a hazy orange color, produced a thick head that has decent retention and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of malted grain, spicy rye and sage. Medium bodied, there is a base of spicy rye, sage, and white pepper. Crisp, easy to drink- the use of sage and rye gives a spicy twist to a classic beer style."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a strange muddle of flavors. Not such a great idea."
""
"Pours a golden, slight hazy color( pretty clear for the style) with white head and dissipates rather fast. The smell is that of the traditional witbier with the addition of some other uncommon fruit and spices notes which gives it a pleasant aroma. The taste is is mostly of rye and sage than that of the traditional witbier. The mouth feel is rather watery and disappointing. I feel that the addition of sage and rye to a witbier is something that was a good idea, but could have had a better execution."
""
""
""
""
"This seems like good beer for the warm days of summer and it seems like a beer that will pique the interest of many and raise some eyebrows due to the unusual flavor profile. I don’t know if I will be seeking it out anytime soon, but this is an interesting beer that does have some good things to offer."

"Overall: People on this site slam Sam Adams for not being 'craft', but I fail to see how throwing orange, coriander, and sage into a beer fails to make it 'craft'. It's a unique beer, good for a one-time drink but I'm not sure I would want to drink again. A decent beer, but the sage is too off putting."
""
""
""
"It's not fantastic, but it's an interesting new beer to try from the summer mixer-12 packs."
""
""
"D/O: Eye-opening rye breaks up what is otherwise a parade of expected features. Wit beers work best when they are treated with delicacy, but this is typical of it's maker's clumsiness with the style. Hopefully others will see in this a needed new direction for the style and make it happen with more favorable results."
""
"Overall, now that I've tasted this beer, I'm shocked by how low it's rated. To me, it was balanced, interesting and well-made. Sort of an American take on a classic Belgian style, and it performs well."
"O: Overall this beer is not very original but that does not mean it's horrible, its decent, I could drink a lot of these, no sweat and no complaints and I'd be alright with buying it again, I'd say give it a try."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer and I thought it was an average at best example of the style, the sage seemed interesting when I read about it on the label, but when I got to the taste and aroma of this beer the sage seemed to be too overpowering which didn't give this beer the best balance. This beer didn't have good drinkability, it was a little tough to finish the bottle, it was a little smooth, but the overpowering sage did not hold my attention and one would be enough for me, no way would I want to session this beer. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, they were both nice and turned out to be the highlights of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was how overpowering the sage was, It would have been a lot nicer if the sage was toned down and the rye shined through a little more. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's not what I look for in the style, and I wouldn't recommend this beer unless you really like sage. All in all I wasn't a fan of this one, Samuel Adams generally knows what their doing, but they got a little out of hand with the sage this time and the beer suffered because of it, better luck next time guys. Blueberry Hill Lager was my favorite of this years summer pack, the rest of the beers were average at best, I think last years summer pack was much better, I don't think I will get another one this season."
""
"Pours orange tinted gold. Low to no foam. Bready rye nose. Orange rind/coriander pokes through. Starts witbier and then takes a right turn with the sage/rye blend. Earthy. Chalky hefe close. Just hints of all the spices. Comes together well. Reviewers here seem to be more down than up, but I thought it was decent."
""
""
""
"Definitely a unique and unusual flavor combination, but this one's not a favorite I'd care to revisit."
""
""
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, this beer seems like a lighter version of their Summer Ale with a stronger spice flavor, so if those two things are what you like in the Summer Ale, you’ll like this beer."
""
"Overall: This was part of the Sam Adams Summer Sampler I picked up. The other beers were pretty good but this one was not my favorite, in fact I could not even finish this beer. Fans of herbal beer would like to check this one out. Fans of the Witbier variety may be caught off guard with this brew."
""
""
"The beer appears light golden with a small head. The aroma offers bready malts, spice, particularly coriander. Chemicals and oddness. A rye beer with coriander sounded pretty nice, but this one misses the mark entirely for me. Soapy and grainy. No fun."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I wouldn't get it again, but I'm sure it's still better than other beers out there."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, spice, and strong sage aromas. Taste is much the same with spice and sage flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a sage presence that is fairly dominant over any other aromas or flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Ok brew. Not my first choice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I agree with everyone else this is a very bland, boring addition to the summer variety pack even more so than the Summer ale. Sucks."
""
""
"I had ths poured into a pilsener glass. I'm usually pretty excited to try the Sam seasonal pack every few months to sample the couple of new ones that they put out. This guy...was pretty disappointing. This is the third different wheat rye beer I've tried, and I haven't really liked any of them, so it's possible that I just don't like the genre. The citrus and lighter flavors of the wheat just make for a weird mix with the earthy, spicy flavors of the sage and rye. The smell mirrors the flavor is golden with just a bit of haziness to it, which to me shows that this beer is really just a mix of two styles trying to be something different. Not sure it works so well."
"Not an awful beer by any means, but one of my least favorite Sam Adams. Loved it's appearance, nice medium color and good top. However, it smelled a little dank (which I've almost never experienced w/ Sam Adams). Tasted kinda dank too. Sour and rather bland for a Sam Adams. Not all that impressed w/ this year's SUmmer Variety Pack."
""
""
""
"Trying the little white rye...its getting more and more difficult to separate the ""white"" ales and lagers from Sammy A. While the little white rye is slightly different than the others...it still follows the same path. The beer pours a semi-hazy yellow with thin white head that is not lacing. The smell has a spice and rye flare. The taste carries a orange peel coriander spice that clear the pallet quickly and finishes dry. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall it is ok....but not enough for me to go crazy and by a 6...12...or 24. The revolutionary rye was much better."
""
"Light citrusy aroma, pleasing. Pours a hazy yellow with thick bright white head. Head has good retention. Taste is mildly sweet and citrusy, notes of spice that are not overpowering. Nicely carbonated refreshing mouthfeel. Definitely a ""pour me another!"""
""
""
""
""
""
"My pour created a finger of eggshell-white head with moderate retention. That was of no matter as it was the nose that really got my attention - the kitchen began to smell like potpourri! Color was a hazy deep-gold with a cloudy core, as though I should have better agitated it in the bottle before pouring. Leaning in, I caught a good whiff of lemon zest, orange peel, black pepper and a general spiciness. Oh my. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was quite citrusy, initially, then the spiciness took over on the tongue. Finish was quite dry and refreshing, thanks to the interplay of the spices. I am not sure that I got the rye, unless that was the source of the black pepper. No matter. This was tasty and a welcome addition to a hazy, humid day in mid-Spring. One more that I hope makes it into CANs for the summer. Just sayin' ..."

"overall a bit too spicy for many, but it barely crosses the line for me. i might revisit this if the rest of the samplers are tasty enough."
"It's a good beer."
""
""
""
"A decent wit. The rye seems to mellow the coriander a bit but the beer still drinks bright"
""
""
"Well, it's interesting. A bit too leafy/herbal for my taste, but it works well enough overall to be drinkable. I had no trouble drinking both in the variety pack, but wouldn't seek it out."
""
""
"OVERALL: This has too much citrus peel and herbs. BOSTON BEER CO, listen!! Not every beer you make needs citrus peel or coriander!! Not to mention spice rack herbs. Bleh. Over spiced and the flavors just don't work. Pass on this one."
"Overall – An easy drinking wit with a bit of rye and some other lighter flavors incorporated within. While nothing of extraordinary regard, it was tasty and makes for a nice summer style brew."
""
""
""
""

""

"Poured into a Samuel Adams perfect pint glass. The beer pours hazy golden with a thick white head and lots of visible rising bubbles. The nose is full of orange, coriander, and sage. I also get some peppery rye, which adds more spiciness to the bright aromas. The taste follows the nose with the wheat and barley adding some nice backbone to this beer. The citrus does meld well with the rye, coriander, and sage. There's that spiciness and earthy quality that balances out the citrus pretty well. There's also a bit of tartness in the flavor. The body is light with moderate carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. The beer drinks pretty well. This is a good beer that hits the right notes and works as a refreshing summer beer."

"Samuel Adams Little White Rye ---3.5/5"
""
""
"Between White Christmas, White Lantern, Blackberry Wit, Imperial Wit and now LWR, Sam is really pumping out the witbeers. This is the best of them all says I."
""
""
""
""
"O - Well, sometimes Sam Adams makes really good seasonals, and other times you wonder what they were thinking. They just got a little to clever for their own good with this one. Why do they make so many of their summer/spring beers so sweet?"
""
""
"Aroma of noble hops it seemed initially though an artificial lemon/flowery nature becomes more prominent as the cap settles. Sage comes across more as rosemary on the nose while the coriander and rye escape me when cold especially. Hop aroma adds a pine character with exposure. Rye texture is quite prominent in the taste while the lemon notes return on the finish. Rye gives the feel a fullish body while the citrus keeps it in check, though it does get a bit harsh for the style with warming. Overall pretty decent brew and a bit of a different tack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It' interesting enough but a little overspiced for my tastes. If you like corriander laden brews this is for you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hazed yellow color under a quickly dissipating off-white head. Smells quite sage-y with a coriander and bright citrus backdrop. Herbal, peppery, and floral. A much more prominent grainy wheat element shows up mid-sip and less sage all around. Orange peel and coriander sweetness transition to a lavender-like floral note and faint ginger. An interesting take on the style for sure. I really like the fresh grain in the finish. Medium bodied and perhaps a touch undercarbonated, but a solid, refreshing beer overall."
""
"3.25/3.5/3.5/3.5/3.5"
""
""
"Drinks very easy, could do a few on a hot summer's day, I'd easily put it above Hooegarten Wit in it present state. This one exceeded my expectations"
""
"Served up in a growler, the beer poured a hazey golden color with a thick short lived white head. aroma was malty with clove, honey and citrus. The beer was light on the palate with a slight hops finish and tasted like it smelled, of cloves and citrus. I have never had a rye beer so I really am unable to make a comparison but, overall I thought the beer was very nice. I will give the mouthfeel a little bit better than average rating as I enjoy the yeasty aftertaste. The brew seems to get better as it warms."
""
"Hazy and golden-yellow in color...white head and a bit of lace. Average, but nice-looking beer. The smell is interesting...lots of pepper, seems like a mix of white and black pepper and something a bit more exotic. Earthy and spicy. Some underlying stone fruit. The taste is similar...the spice and pepper kick in quickly...not much malt...drier than I expected. I don't get rye, but there is a notable grain streak running through the beer. Fairly full in body. Full carbonation. Drinkable and interesting, but not something that would entice me again and again."
"Pale copper hue with a bright white head forming fine speckled lacing with a hazed finish, the nose is full of sage and coriander. Spicy rye upfront in the nares with the sage/coriander combo not a bad beer. Flavor it's seeping through with all of those, let's put into perspective. Harsh spicy flavor full of a wave of coriander and sage with mixed vegetable green notes. Full bodied slick mouthfeel can't wish or wait for much more. Overall this beer is a job and somebody has got to do it."
""
""
"Pairings: It would taste good with corned beef and cabbage."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As I poured this beer I instantly received a nice scent of citrus and a nice lite colored beer. The first sip was very refreshing and tasteful, with a nice fruity aftertaste. The flaver of this beer stayed with me for a long time before I took my next sip, I look for summer time and hot weather to try this again."
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours hazy-golden with white, long lasting head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of wheat malt, ripe fruit and spices. Body is full and crisp. Taste is of spices, sweet malt, citrus and cotton candy. Finish is earthy, spicy and sweet as well. Nice summer brew."
"It does taste exactly like a Wit, but it's just different enough to be interesting. Spices are well moderated and nothing stands out by itself. I wouldn't have identified the rye either, but overall there is a pleasant malty smoothness with some sharper notes. A faint bitterness at the end along with that rye back of the throat scratch. Well made, sudsy, and fairly rich for a Witbier."
""
"Kind of an interesting beer here. Has an unusual flavor, kind of a nice change of pace. One of the better beers in the summer pack, wouldn't mind another bottle or two of it."
""
"D- Not bad, but not my favorite. It's worth a try and is quite sessionable. I just find Sam Adams attempt at styles like this to be a bit on the weak side."
"I had no idea sage came in various colors, much less white, but, yet again, beer has taught me something about the world at large. Gotta love it. This stuff pours a mostly clear light brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises light orange zest, spicy greenery (which I assume is the sage peeking through), black pepper, light coriander, and a pinch of what seems like banana peel. The taste throws some sweetness on the orange and ratchets that citrus a couple notches, but, don't you fret none, darlin', the spices, particularly that damn sage, shine through in the finish, lingering their momentarily, making sure my tastebuds fucking SAVOR their very existence. It's not a pleasurable encounter, sadly... The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, what may or may not have been a decent wit is torpedoed by the addition of the sage. I kinda wanna know reasoning what led to that particular conclusion, 'cause it musta been in a fairly purple haze..."
""
""
""
""
""

"Another Sam seasonal that I can pass on."
""

"O: Definitely not your typical wit. The combo of sage, coriander, and rye don't really mix all that well, especially once the orange peel comes into play. Gets better as it warms, but it really isn't anything more than average"
"Overall - Decent brew, but it's not my bag. I wish breweries would stop using sage (or most herbs, really) in their beers. It just doesn't fit, in my opinion. For a beer with Rye in it's name, it's odd that the sage character is more prominently featured... but maybe that's just me. I wouldn't care to have this again."
"O: very pleasant. i enjoyed this beer with a pork chop dinner. a very understated brew, but very refreshing. not the most creative witbier. reminds me of a lighter, spicier blue moon."
"I have to say this was better than I anticipated. Better than the average summer brew."
""
"I've concluded that this beer is ok. It doesn't really draw me in really..."
"i wasnt sure what to expect from this little white rye. it pours a gold color with a tinge of cloudiness. there is sage in this beer and i comes hard to the nose. the taste is clean, not too bitter and the sage creeps in at the back... and its not too over powering. i think it makes for a really interesting beer. the over all taste is light enough to go into a ""summer collection box"" (which is where i got it). i do have to give them props for the sage flavor i have had some other herbal beers in the past that made me feel like i was drinking soup. but little white rye has enough sage to be interesting with out the over all beer being off putting. i was pleasantly surprised by this."
"My first thought was that it tasted like a crispier Blue Moon. The smell is enjoyable, and the taste is slightly more so. The citrus and spice are wrapped in a wheat-tasting body. A certain spice lingers in your throat after each drink. It's not a bad drink. I probably wouldn't get it again. However, I do like that spicy/peppery burn aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
"O- I just wasn't feeling this one, the sage notes left a funny aftertaste, not my favorite Sam Adams"
""
""
"Overall- A pretty good beer. Sam Adams needs to release this in 6-packs."
"Addendum: Re-sampled today. Yes this is a good beer; sell in six packs please."
""
""
"A nice beer. I would buy it again."
"Low C-"
""
"Pours a hazy golden color with a thick white head. Bottle states it is an ale brewed with orange peel and coriander with sage added. It has a nice smell, smells like summer, with a tad bit of citrus smell. Definitely has a slight citrus flavor, a small amount of activity when poured. Not a lot of texture, but that suits its summer billing. Would certainly be a good summer grilling out beer to accompany some backyard food."

"This poured out as a clear golden color with a decent white head on top there is a decent scattered lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer is strong with sage, there is a nice amount of orange peel on the nose also. The taste of the beer is herbal, some subtle citrus, there is a spice note in there also. The mouthfeel of the beer is smooth, nicely carbonated and drinkable. Overall it's a decent beer. More of a Gruit than a Wit to me."
""
""
""
"A decent rye-infused ale that would add a little more character to a hot summer day (looking forward to those!)."
