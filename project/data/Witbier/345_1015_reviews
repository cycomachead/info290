"Witbiers will never be my favorite style, but this is a pretty solid version of one. Nothing crazy or outstanding, but just eminently drinkable and tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice American witbier that is very drinkable and great in the summer. Great part of the new summer mixed 12-pack. This and Summer Love alone make the pack worth picking up"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nothing here sets the world on fire - it's just a solid witbier that's so easy to kill. Actually, it's a bit more effortless than a lot of other wits. I could easily down two or three bottles of this on a hot day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Just an ok take on the style. There are no serious flaws, though the body could use some more substance. It just comes off as bland. A very middle of the pack offering."
""
""
"Taste more like Hefe than Wit."
""
"Overall: One of the better Witbiers in my opinion as I am not a big fan of overly funky sour Belgian beers."
""

"O: A good witbier for sure here way better than I was expecting even for a company as well respected as Victory. The orange was subdued and coriander just didn't get it, was in the smell but wasn't in the taste, which probably helped this beer to my taste. Nice stab at a style that is my least favorite wheat style beer. Also glad it smelled like green apples but doesn't taste like it."
""
"overall; this could have been a truly great wheat beer. but the chalkiness in the mouthfeel really ruins the experience. i wish i could say it's worth trying anyways but i really don't think it is. really a shame."
""
""
"Straw yellow in color with a heavy haze. Poured with a thick white foam that quickly reduced to a wispy cap. Wheat malt, bubble gum, yeast and unripened banana aromas with hints of mint and floral hops. Medium bodied, with a smooth oily feel down the middle, and light tangy, slightly subdued carbonation on the edges.Wheat malt and light lemon flavors up front with tangy pepper flavors through the middle turning yeasty toward the end. Finished cleanly with a light bready and yeasty aftertaste. Refreshing and easy drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A decent wit with some Belgian flavors. A little too light and bland for its own good. A think a little more hop kick, and more floral fruits could relaly kick this up a notch. Nice to drink again but this just reminds me why victory maybe stopped making this annually."

"Overall, the best thing about this beer is its aroma. Here things are kept in check with warmth of spice and heartiness of grain. These are lost a bit through the flavor, however, with things lightening up a touch too much, becoming diluted and lost amongst the wetness of the wheatiness. The spice base laid down through the aromatics is thus lost and depreciated. Otherwise, for a light sipper of a Wit, this guy goes back smooth, ultimately making it easy to appreciate. While this is not our new favorite Victory offering, it does the style well, and will sit against most of its competitors."

"Date tasted: July 5, 2013... Glassware: Rare Vos shaker... Occasion: camp week #1 in the books, and reviewing an old friend....Appearance: pale straw haze; thin off-white head that stills quickly; appears easy-drinking but not overly attractive ... Aroma: tart citric bouquet, with orange and lemon scents softly against some pepper--more intriguing combination than the average summer wit... Palate: a soft yet firm mouthfeel, smooth at the teeth and lacking all (any?) presence at the throat--mega-refreshing, as recalled... Taste: a bit of pepper sneaks in, but far and away a doughy, orange twist that easily sifts down the throat; not complex, but enough profile to compel... Overall: An old friend indeed--this was the first beer I found that fit the easy-drinking summer plan once out of college; surprised I had not reviewed it yet, I had to go back to it; for better (or worse), a case of this could vanish in a mere day or two; better than the sum of its parts...."

"Pours a murky yellow with a foamy tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, grain, spices, and Belgian yeast. Taste is much the same with a slight citrus flavor on the finish. There is a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is pretty refreshing."
""
"Mostly full bodied for the style with a nice wheat/malt aftertaste. Overall a good beer but nothing makes it stand out to me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a solid witbier."
""
""
""
""
"Golden color and pours a good head but dissipates over time with little lacing on the glass. Nose is lemon and honey. Decent carbonation on the front end. Lemon, orange and other subtle citrus flavors give this witbier a refreshing summer heat flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-A nice summer beer however it is downhill after the nose."
""
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle into pilsener glass, no bottle dating. Pours hazy golden straw color with a small fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some light spotty lacing clings to the glass, with a fair amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of lemon, orange peel, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, grass, earth, and yeast spices. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and decent strength. Taste of lemon, grass, pepper, tangy wheat, orange zest, earth, bread, clove, and yeast spiciness. Light spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, wheat, pepper, earth, and yeast spices on the finish for a short bit. Good amount of flavor, with nice balance and complexity. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a nice crisp and lightly creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is very nice witbier. Good amount of flavor and nice balance; and extremely easy to drink. Very pleasant and enjoyable."
""
"O: A good thirst quencher for a very hot day, but not on par with other brews from Victory. Reminded me of Vedett Extra White, minus the atmosphere of Café Belga in Ixelles (which adds a +5 to any beer)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a yellow hue with a thin whitehead that leaves minimal retention and some lacing. The aroma is yeast, lemon, wheat, and malts. The taste starts out with some lemon, wheat, yeast and follows with some spices and finishes off with more lemon and some grass. Mouthfeel is a nice crisp clean smooth feel that is very easy to drink and overall this is a nice crisp and tasty beer that is nice to drink on a warm summer day or whenever a beer this good sounds good."
"Overall – I was expecting more from this brewer. It's very drinkable bot not very exciting. The fruit flavours come across as a touch artificial too. Nothing worth searching for."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A great every day beer , must try!"
""
""
"O: Not a bad Belgian-style wit at all and certainly more palatable than some of the popular macro versions out there. The 5% ABV is right on point with just a hint of American bravado in the malt bill and herbal hop flavor. I'd have another, especially on a scorcher like today. In fact..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Just an OK wit; drinkable but lacks something in the Belgian spice department"
""
""
""
""
"O- Not a bad beer, but doesn't blow me away, easy to drink, but it is a little weak, seem like it would be perfect after a long hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A good and refreshing beer, especially if it's hot outside."
""
""
"Overall, a pretty decent wit. A little much on the sweet and spicy side."
"A refreshing beer for the summer but that's about it. Lots of others in the same category."
""
""
""
"Overall: Definitely drinkable and refreshing. Just not complex enough to separate it from others in the genre."
""
"The body is light with slightly low carbonation. Overall this one is solid. The aroma could be better but we can put this one the list of go-to summer brews for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a small 1/2"" white head but it had decent lifespan. The body is a hazy raw sienna yellow color with ample tiny bubbles. It smells mildly of malt, grain, and citrus. The taste mirrors the smell but adds a special toastiness to the malt as well as a touch of sour. Decent finish focusing on the sour."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a pale, somewhat watery yellow coloring with a steady, slow flow of carbonation and a slim ring of white film around the edge of the surface. Aromas of toasted grains, biscuits, and a slight tangy citrus highlight. Flavors are roasted, with a banana and clove backbone that supports the smooth, creamy body. A slight nutmeg and cinnamon highlight throughout, as well. The aftertaste is roasted and clove spiced, with a smooth, creamy finish. Extremely easy to drink, and decent flavor profiles, make this a great summer brew that is a bit heavier and more full than the average fare. Tasty!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A nice change of pace summer drinker. Sessionable and pleasant."
""
"O - Wishing more Vienna malt was on scene. I am glad some of the more potent Witbier spices were restrained. And this is probably a blue-ribbon-worthy thrist-quencher on swamp-ass summer days. But it was a bit offensive towards the end. They say, life gives you lemons, make lemonade. Same, I think might begin to apply to Victory's Whirlwind Wit.... this would go great with sugar and water."
""
""
""
"Anyway, once again Victory comes through with a quality brew that I'll look forward to every year."
""
"Absolutely an ideal Belgian-style witbier. Blue Moon wishes it could be so tasty. Another winner from Victory."
""
""
"O: Very light and refreshing, a delicious beer that is very much sessionable. The beer would be amazing on a hot summer afternoon. Definitely one to have again - maybe a regular in the summer cook-out rotation."
""
""
""
""
"good session brew while sitting and drinking outside on a nice warm sunny day."
""
""
""
"O - I saw this beer had just started appearing on the shelves for the season so I picked one up fresh. The appearance and smell were unimpressive, but the taste and mouthfeel were very refreshing. It is a very sessionable wit that goes down easy and doesn't pack much of a punch. It won't be a beer I turn to often but I suppose it could fill a tiny wit-niche in my repertoire."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a flavorful, balanced witbier. I really enjoyed it. Wits aren't a favorite of mine so I don't often get into them, but I would have this one again if I were in the mood for a Wit."
""
""
""
""
"O - very light witbier, overall tasty but not overwhelming"

"O-A typical Witbier, tasty but nothing godly. not a bad investment"
""

"D: Shoots wide of the signature look. No hazy, no lace, and a touch dark. Taste is okay, if a bit more herbal – less sweet, not really any orange peel, and maybe more firmly hoppy than most. Mouthfeel is okay, if a bit drier. Belgian yeast aspect is rather pedestrian. Okay drinking, but not really a go to Wit."
"A great smelling though ultimately dull witbier."
"Coriander has a little edge to it here, I also am still getting the lemongrass...I wonder if Victory uses it in this one? Theres also a blood orange citric presence that is cool. Nice balance of sweet and spice, neither dry nor cloying...I like it quite a bit. Im a sucker for a good wit, and this one is one of the best new ones I have tried in quite some time. Its always a good thing if my beer is empty before I can finish typing my thoughts!"
"O- Overall, Whirlwind Wit is a very solid wittier that is very quaffable. Would purchase again. "
"O: A solid beer, but not one I would really seek out. This is one of Victory's weaker attempts (and this is my favorite brewery.)"
"Light bodied with great carbonation, this beer is very drinkable. The strong carbonation causes this beer to literally fizzle away in your mouth. Luckily, the strong carbonation does not seem detrimental to the flavors."
"Drink- It's an average beer with it's place in the market for a good summer beer to cool you down and not get you too buzzed. A little lacking in flavor but oh well. Only a single 12, not a six pack."
" The wit has a nice flavor of belgian yeast with some slight citrus accents it seems to be a little on the floral side with the hops and almost soapy with a creamy wheat flavor in the middle and only mildly sweet but there is enough peppery and lemony quality to make my taste buds take notice. Overall this is a standard wit, pretty tasty, but lacks a little depth in the malt and yeast.I found it a good beer to go with orange chicken I paired it with."
"Excellent, one of my favorite Witbiers."
"Medium to light body with lots of flavor. Oranges and wheat malt come through the most, with a slight taste of coriander. A certain sourness and tanginess is detected, leading to a quick and clean finish and dry mouthfeel. The carbonation is a little off I think. It causes a weird spritziness that distracts me from the taste a little. Its not annoying, but curious and interesting. Overall, this is a nice summery witbier with just enough tang to satisfy those taste buds and enough flavor to back it up. Its a decent brew, but I think I prefer Victory's Sunrise to this one."
"O - This is a very good witbier. I'm glad I finally broke down and bought some of this."
"D - Quite sessionable... Easy sipper... Simple, straight-forward and well executed... Not my favorite Witbier and not my favorite victory offering, but it will do just fine in a pinch..."
"I bought 7 bottles of beer. 2 bottles of this. That 2nd bottle will be sitting around for a while."
"Light and refreshing with some very pleasant flavors going on."
"O- Nothing too special about this beer, only thing that really stands out is my constantly wanting more from the beer whether it be flavor or smell. Really lacked the strong yeast characteristics that the style is known for and left me quite bored."
"This Wit pours out as a cloudy yellow color, it's got a fluffy white head that settles into just a thin white lacing over the beer. The smell has a pretty good citrusy and spicy aroma. The taste had some bready yeast along with the citrus from the nose coming in on the flavor. The spices settle into place in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was light and refreshing. Overall it's a pretty good Wit."
"Good Wit Beer. One of the better I've sampled, looking forward to more after this one."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A fine beer for a hot summer day. Not too much to complain about. Not my favorite style, but I could see myself mixing one of these into my mix and match sixers once in a while. Especially in the spring/summer."
"O: Man is this sessionable. Light, tasty, and refreshing. The whole is definitely better than the sum of its parts!"
"Overall an excellent brew!"
"O: A solid witbier. Look forward to cracking more of these this summer."
"The mouthfeel is light with carbonation being on the higher side. Overall it was a drinkable beer, but not a great one of the style. It was A little weak overall, almost feels like a light wit beer if there were such a thing, or a light beer with coriander and orange peel added. An easy drinking summer beer, but not one that scores great against it's peers."
"Very good on a warm spring day! Very good all around!"
"Extremely drinkable and sessionable warm weather ale. Had this sitting out in the sun and it hit the spot. Quenches thirst. Not my favorite wit ever, but probably up there on the list and I would have this again."
"The second beer this eveing was the Victory Worldwind Witbeir! The color was a cloudy golden with thin white head. The nose included hints of clove and citrus. The taste was decent...was not overpowered by clove or citrus...very good balance. There seemed to be an additional spice, but I could not name it. The mouthfeel was good enough to enjoy."
"Victory Brewing Company is a fantastic brewery that routinely brews very impressive beer. Whirlwind Witbier is definitely impressive. Generally, Witbiers are relatively simple and straight forward. This one is no exception. But, the flavor is really nice. Couple that with the fact that it’s extremely drinkable and you have a winner."
"The CPJ"
"O: The jury is still out whether I'll get this one again. I guess if there's nothing else around at the time, I'll take the plunge."
"D: honestly with so many solid brews coming out of Victory i was expecting a lot more out of this. slightly refreshing, but definitely better examples out there. keep on moving..."
"Although a light offering, this beer is darn good. Very easy going flavors with a unique profile. light and flavorful and easy to drink wins all the time."
"T: Pale malts, yeast, clove, banana and lemon meld together pretty well. Nice, light mouthfeel that works for the style. It's a little too sweet for me and not one of the best wits I've had, but it's not bad at all."
"o - this was picked up as a makeweight to a case of prima pils and I'm glad I did - it won't change the world but its a perfectly acceptable summertime beer"
"Drinkable but pretty forgettable."
"The aroma was somewhat light, but once you let it warm up it started to come out at you a little bit better. Very nice light fruits, hints of banana and apricot, lots of cinnamon and nutmeg really far in the back, with a touch of a pepper like smell as well. The flavor followed suit just the same, with a very nice, light body ale. Tons of carbonation and a really crisp, clean feeling. The first flavor to come over was the light grain, and a touch of yeast, some banana poking around in there as well, with a sparkling quality to it. Nice touch of bitter grapes toward the finish, giving that little bit of a hoppy touch to dry out the finish and get you ready for another sip. Not a hint of alcohol in here what so ever, as this was really solidly put together. I could have kept drinking this one all day long, it was just that good. Really a very nice, high quality ale."
"pours a light yellow color with pure white head. not very cloudy even after making sure to get all the yeast in there. smell is of belgian spice and that slightly musty aroma that comes from Hoegaarden. taste is heavy on lemon-like citrus and tastes very much of the wheat. less spicey than many belgian whites. It's almost like an American Wheat with some lemon added in. It's decent, but nothing spectacular."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a cloudy, golden yellow color with lots of suspended yeast visible. The white head quickly dissipated to nothing, and only scant traces of lacing remained. The aroma was a pleasing blend of dry wheat, light spices (coriander in particular), hints of vanilla and traces of orange peel. The flavors were refreshing and very similar to the aroma but the core seemed flat. Balanced and appropriate for the style but aside from the distinct coriander on the finish, the malt and the hops profiles were light and rather uninspired. The mouthfeel was good, the body medium/light and the carbonation fine."
"d: this beer goes down quickly. i'll buy it again when the weather becomes more conducive to witbier enjoyment."
"Orange amber with visible yeast and a nice fluffy white head. Had a nice aroma of banana, clove and bubble gum going on. Slightly sweeter taste than I expected, with a nice floral nose and slight citrus taste. Very refreshing and easy to drink, a great summer beer. Probably not the best witbier I have ever has, but pretty tasty and affordable."
"Overall a very average witbier. Although it sure is a refreshing beer, I found it too light bodied. This definitely needs more malt, more spices and less water and carbonation."
"Slightly hazy and golden in color, this is a beer that just looks like it is going to be refreshing. The first taste brings a bit of spice (coriander) with hints of banana, lemongrass, clove and yeast. The beer finishes with a tartness that just calls you back for another sip... another glass... another two glasses, and at 5% Abv this is a beer where you can have a few of in one sitting and still feel fine the next morning. The flavor is so light and refreshing that it never feels heavy on your stomach."
"The carbonation is bubbly and pleasant, adding to the overall crispness of the beer. Easy drinking and sessionable, but there's definitely better American interpretations of the style."
"Not too refreshing for a witbier, didn't really like this one."
"D: This beer is light and goes down easily. It simply feels too thin. More carbonation and would help."
"Very drinkable and enjoyable beer."
"D: This beer is very drinkable and enjoyable"
"Drinkability: this is a very pleasing witbier. Victory rarely disappoints me, and this beer is no exception. I have thoroughly enjoyed consuming it; now if only it were available in six packs around here."
"D: This was not super clean and tasty, but it wasn't bad either. Easy to drink but boring. There are better summer beers out there."
"Drinkability: This beer won't kick you in the teeth with flavor, which makes it pretty sessionable."
"Overall an okay beer. Not impressive by any standards especially for a Victory."
"What happened Victory? first the pils then this one.... hmmmm, maybe there is some funk in the brewery that bothers me..."
"Great beer for a humid night like tonight!"
"D: I enjoyed this Witbier, which is usually not my favorite style. The spicy yeast character won me over and I would have another."
"Drinkability: Fairly standard Wit but very refreshing. While definitely good, I had expected a little more from Victory."
"Very drinkable. Good hot summer day."
"Pours a nice yellowish golden color with a big fluffy head. Has very nice retention but no lacing to speak of. Aroma is very appealing. Has a banana clove thing going on with some lemon peel. Taste is very similar to the aroma. Has that banana flavor. Very smooth. Really an easy drinking beer. Overall this is really a nice beer. Really god drinkability on this one. A great summer beer especially on a hot humid day like today. Highly recommended."
"Served from tap into a standard pint. Pours golden yellow with a one finger pure white head. There was no lacing evident throughout. The aroma was comprised of wheat and bananas. The flavor was of bananas and had a wheat bite as an aftertaste. It was light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a not a bad Witbier. Needs more complex flavors to be the greatest of its type, but it does pretty well with what it has currently."
"D - Tasty drink, something you can consume a lot of in the summer months, but has nothing that really makes it stand out from the crowd."
"Pours a cloudy, pale gold color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of lemon, slight tart malt, hint of hops, and slight sweet malt. Barely fits the style of a Witbier. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with a high carbonation level. The feel is also slightly watery. Tastes of lemon, pale malt, slight sweet malt, and a hint of hops. Overall, more reminiscent of a Weissbier than a Witbier."
"This Wit is quite refreshing. Clove-like yeast flavors are most dominant. Carbonation is light, and this beer finishes pleasantly dry and crisp. Even though this beer is built around the yeast, it avoids the phenolic and spicy yeast flavors that I dislike. I'm enjoying this one!"
"Among the better domestic wits. I'll be pairing this up with some grilled chicken and salad (as in not-grilled)."
"i like this beer, i have become partial to witbiers lately. i would recommend it for a hot day, or for when lounging and you want something simple yet enjoyable."
"D-With the beer's light body and lower level of carbonation, it definately is drinkable but has a lackluster quality."
"Overall: I'm not a huge fan of wits but this one is good and exceptionally good on a hot June afternoon. If this is an older beer as others in this batch have been it doesn't seem to have suffered any from improper storage."
"pours a hazy pale yellow color with a fast receding head with a brilliant white ring..smell is wheat and bread with coriander and citrus peel.some belgian yeast bananas and other spices..the taste was clean and crisp with a clove and citrus peel hit followed by bananas and spices..mouth feel was light/medium and refreshing on this warm summer day..this white hit the spot after work..it had a nice Belgian yeast taste present with clove ,coriander, and bananas and a wheat bread finish.very refreshing..will drink again and recommend"
"Victory's Whirlwind Witbier was a light color, with a very small head that dissipated quickly. It had a spicey smell to it. It has a light taste, but very flavorful. There was alot of spices, and some hints of citrus, and bananas. It was very easy to drink. Overall a very good beer, a very different beer from victory. One of the better summer beers out there."
"Pours a very pale hazy straw yellow color with almost no head at all. The aroma is that of wheat backbone with hints of clove and a little banana present. The taste is good, nice wheat backbone with hints of clove, banana, and maybe some citrus. The taste is ever so slightly watery. The mouthfeel is moderate carbonation. The drinkability is good, nothing to make you dislike this beer. The taste is good and strong, a nice summer beer."
"Drinkability - Despite me wanting a little more to the flavor and smell, it's a very refreshing summer beer. Mild and understated, perhaps too easy to drink."
"D- Nice crisp summertime beer. I liked the way this tasted all together. There was a ton of yeast in the beer which I could have done without. Overall crisp flavors and clean tasting. Do yourself a favor and try this beer out."
"Poured into the evertrusty Zatec fluted glass. Got 2 fingers of head from an aggressive pour. Smells like classic witbier, coriander, belgian yeast, corn tortilla. Flavor is kind of citrusy, flavorful, and a bit of the aforementioned corn tortilla/enchilada. Refreshing, savory, great example of style."
"D- Easy to drink. great beer for warm weather. Spring/summer refreshment at its finest."
"Pours a very nice, hazy yellow color, with a good amount of white foam on top. Aromas of wheat, lemon and orange zest. Flavors here are very similar to the aromas, with the citrusy flavors balancing nicely with the Belgian yeasts. A very good, refreshing summer beer. An excellent white beer."
"D: The beer is very refreshing and drinkable. It's a good choice for relaxing on a hot summer day."
"D- *ridiculously* drinkable. Its got a very nice flavor, and doesn't overwhelm you or bog you down at all when you're drinking it"
"Drinkability: A good summer beer and is a good way for your friends to kick that stupid Blue Moon trend. This is one beer that you don't need an orange slice in."
"D: A witbier that's more lively than most which makes up for the average taste and atrocious appearance. I'd definitely reach for this again on a hot summar day but I really hope it looks a bit better next time (ie. no floaties)."
"D: It has a good drinkability factor. Not as much sweetness as most of the style."
"Whirlwind strikes me as a really nice thirst quencher for a warm Spring or Summer day or a backyard barbecue. It is bright, light in body, not overly sweet and a bit tart. Nice qualities for the season!"
"D - I may have to have this again since I lost the bottle for my label collection but I enjoyed this just as much as other offerings by Victory. Go golden monkey!"
"Pretty yellow..."
"D-its a thirst quencher, great beer for anyone looking for a summer beer for bbq's, etc..although, probably my least favorite offering from Victory that I've tried, i prefer hefeweizen styles over witibier, although they are quite similar. the lack of head and lacing was a little disappointing. between this or Sam Adams summer ale, I'd choose this every time."
"D - not the best Wit but pretty nicely done, light and very easy to put down, highly drinkable."
"Hazy golden with plenty of yeast in suspension, but disappointingly little head and not the best lacing. I am a big fan of wit beers in the spring/summer, but the aroma on this let me down a little with much more prominent clove character than I usually prefer. Citrus and wheat malt were also there, but the clove seemed to jump out the most to me. The flavor was better. Still plenty of clove, but a lot more white pepper and other spices joined up with wheat malt sweetness and orange peel notes. Medium body with slightly spiky carbonation and a nice clean, slightly tart finish. A drinkable beer to be sure, but not my favorite representation of the style."
"Drinkability - Overall very good. Its almost as good as the one from Maine, and that is pretty amazing in itself. However its priced similarly, at least where I buy my beer, so although this is very competitive, it is not a winner."
"This is a light-bodied beer that is easy to drink. Not a great cold-weather beer, but nice for warm temperatures."
"A rare disappointment from Victory... This could be old or something... As it is, I won't be going back for this one.."
"M/D: very easy to drink, too easy. Mouthfeel is smooth and soft."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a stemless wine glass. 4/2010 freshness date on the bottle. Poured yellowish orange with a thick off white foamy head that quickly disappears. The aroma had yeast, grasslike, with lemon citrus notes. Strong spice, pepperlike, clove, fruity flavors. The taste of banana blend nicely with yeast. Orange and lemon citrus flavors in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is very light making this a very drinkable brew. I first tried this at a brewfest then I purchased a number of bottles, very tasty indeed."
"Notes: Not the best witbier I've had, but something a little different. I don't know how to describe some of the feel, but it feels delicate. It is more refreshing than flavorful, but serves its purpose nicely."
"Into a Hoegaarden glass: Poured a hazy light yellow with a finger of bright white head, that collapsed quickly, and laced spottily. The smell, in a word, was MILD; standard clove and lemon, but not very complex. The flavor confirmed this; certainly needs more flavor strength. The feel was light, but somewhat watery. Certainly light enough to session, but needs more flavor and complexity."
"d- I had high expectations for this beer based on the company and I tend to like most wits. This one was a good, though not great beer. I certainly wouldn't mind another, but it's not on the top of my list. it's very refreshing and yet a very simple wit. the simplicity of the beer has its benefits and drawbacks depending on the drinker and the situation. but another Victory beer i can feel comfortable calling quality."
"Whirlwind Witbier may not be Victory's most impressive beer, but it's a rock-solid example of the style and is as drinkable as a midsummer day is long. There aren't many American wits better than this."
"D - Full flavored wit, maybe a little too flavorful for long sessions"
"Notes: Victory is simply a solid brewery, probably one of my top 5 favorites."
"Overall-nice balanced wit with good flavor, recommended."
"Pours a cloudy golden, lots of suspended sediment and no head. Smells a nice fruity maltiness, sensing perhaps a bit of peach or apricot. It's got a solid medium body. I enjoyed the flavor very much--slightly fruity and spicy. I enjoyed it very much and would definitely have it again. It was very drinkable and a great summer brew."
"Notes: Feels like a nice version of the wheat beers: true to the spirit and very drinkable and shareable. In fact, it is a good beer that probably does not need or sustain much thinking or detailed recommendation to offer it."
"Drinkability: A good beer for summer drinking and easy to have another when out for dinner and an evening of good conversation. This is not the best wit I've had but it is a well made tasty one that is worth trying and drinking."
"It's a good brew but lacking punch. It could really use a slice of orange, which for me says it's missing a bit of flavor. But perfect for a hot day on the deck."
"Hazy bleach blonde with a thick creamy white head that leaves some decent lace behind on the glass. The nose is fruity, lemon and orange zest with overripe banana come to mind with a nice whiff of wheat malt and coriander. Belgian tasting yeast and spice combine with citrus fruit flavors nicely. Smooth and medium light bodied. A good beer for a hot day. Nothing amazing here, just a nice witbier."
"From a 12 oz. brown bottle. Pours a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smells of wheat, cloves, citrus, a lot going on here. Tastes like it smells. A lot of different flavors combining to a quite delicious tasting ber. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and goes down very smooth. I would definatly recommend this beer."
"Don't drink and review."
"Appearance is a very clear yellow. Sort of just average, nothing bad but nothing too appealing. Smells quite citrusy but the overall aroma is fairly light. Orange peel and lemon are there with just a hint of spice. Tastes like standard wit ingredients; citrus, corienader spice. Very clean and light. Mouth is light-bodied (not watery, though) and has a nice bite of carbonation. Its a good, easy beer that would be easy to sip in the heat at a bbq or such."
"D: Summer beer for sure and easy to drink a few and not be tired of the flavors."
"Medium body, somewhat heavier and thicker than I like my wits. Good carbonation. This is easy to drink, but just above average in my opinion."
"Very drinkable, but almost too delicate. I wish there was a little more depth to this."
"D - Very enjoyable, especially on a hot day. I could drink this all day easily and be quite happy. Very refreshing."
"D- just average in my opinion, but extremely drinkable. no flavors lean to far to one side and nothing really stands out. thirst quenching and refreshing. great session beer."
"One of my favorites of the style...and this a favorite style of mine. That says something!"
" Starts off with zesty leomon and orange mixed together with a spoon of spice. the taste left a bit more to be desired, felt like watered down citrus. still, felt good with a medium body and some carbonation to leave me refreshed"
"High drinkability, easy flowing."
"Pours a hazy light golden with a white head that fades to nothing in short order. Quite lemony in the aroma with some coriander and even a little bit of grapefruit juice. Taste is similar. Medium bodied for the style, crisp and zingy with lemon, white grapefruit juice, and some tangy herbalness. Pretty refreshing if a bit simple. Still the zestiness of this one satisfies nicely on a hot day."
"overall - Definitely not the best rendition of the witbier style, but it holds its own. I will definitely finish this six pack, but I don't think I'd get another, especially since I can find Allagash white in my area now."
"Drinkability is pretty damn high thanks to the abv, but $10 for a six-pack is asking a little much. Victory continues to impress."
"Tap @ Pizza Port SB. Poured hazy, bright yellow with a short white head. Minimal lacing. Fresh wheat and bubblegum nose, perfumey. Some spice, but the bubblegum is strong, almost like a German hefe. Clean, refreshing taste. Lemon, orangepeel, and wheat abound. Nice spiced back. Coriander and yeast esters are strong without overpowering. Clean, tart finish. Lighter mouthfeel, but kind of flat. Good beer."
"This is certainly not a very complex beer, but it is exceptionally drinkable. It's tough to put the glass down which is the key determining factor of a great session beer in my eyes."
"Overall a middle of the pack witbier. I wouldn't get it again just because I know there are better options."
"Drinkability: A revitalizing, refreshing witbier that positively makes you want to leap out of your seat with a renewed burst of energy to go find your server and order another beer. It makes a trade-off for less body and overall flavor for an added bonus in ease of drinking and refreshment."
"Rather enjoyable. Spicy in the aroma, slightly sweet in the flavor. All around a good beer. Recommended."
"Cheers!!!"
"I would actually rate this higher than a lot of people in that I'm in a ""Belgian-phase"" right now and may have rose-colored glasses. My first witbier, I thought that even though the mouthfeel was flat, this witbier had a unique taste which intrigued me. I could very well see myself ordering a few."
"This is what you expect from a brewery effecting a Belgian-style wit rather than the way it's been ""Americanized."" A good beer and very drinkable with a low ABV."
"If your are a fan of the style, surely try this."
"D: A very drinkable witbier. It's quality. Try it."
"Pours somewhat of a golden color, clearer than I expected. The yeast doesn't cloud the beer like some witbiers I have had. Tastes very crisp and clean, with a tad bit of spiciness. The beer is a little too carbonated in my opinion, but it doesn't take much away overall. A great summer beer and thirst quencher."
"Excellent drinkability. Dry, lightly sweet and tart at the same time with a delicate spice in the finish. Well done."
"D: This is a drinkable beer with some good attributes, but there are definitely better examples of of the style out there."
"D: A drinkable and quality wit, but a bit ho-hum."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into my shaker glass. Appears a cloudy bright yellow color with two fingers of fluffy bone white foam. The head leaves little to no lacing. Smells and tastes of lemon, orange, a hint of cloves, slightly spicy yeast, and some bready, wheaty grains. This witbier is medium in both body and carbonation with a crisp dry finish. Quite quenching."
"D- A drinkable wit at a low abv(5%) i could drink a few of these in some warm weather. Good flavor from a local company, good enough for a return."
"Not a paragon of the style, probably, although this is the first Witbier I've had in a long time and so I can't really judge it on that. It's not super-complex, didn't really open up new notes as I was drinking, but top marks for thirst-quenching. Would drink again, and good for the price."
"Overall: not bad but would not want more than one of these. Leaves a bitter aftertaste sort of like an ex-wife."
"Poured a golden yellow with a thin white head that dissipated quickly. Smell was very light yet quite clean and crisp, also earthy notes. Taste was fairly light but very earthy and grassy. Similar to a smoother macro with minimal carbonation. Nothing too special, just a very clean beer. very pleasant and easy to drink. Not complex at all, good to try if you like Belgian witbier."
"Highly drinkable. Whirlwind is sweetly grainy, mild, and dry, and the combination makes a great beverage."
"D - Not bad. I could easily have a view of these. The only thing that would hold me back would be the excessive spicing. Then again, I don't drink wits all that often, so it might be that I just need to be reacquainted with the spice character. I picked up a single for $2 to give it a whirl(ha....I guess). Not bad, but in my opinion it doesn't stack up to Hoegaarden."
"Pours a very thin white head that barely sticks around long enough to be called a ""head," no lacing as one would thus expect. Cloudy straw yellow color, opaque without density, some bubbles inside visible. Unassuming nose of clove, ginger spice, banana, golden raisin scents, more mandarin orange than any other citrus, the bready element more doughy than baked, light does of carob too. Fairly full-bodied, ""it's got back"" and moves at a slow pace. The carbonation might be too low and hence a contributing factor in its relative lack of crispness. The clove spice pulls back, the orange to lemon citrus not really taking its place. Maybe a suggestion of apricot, peach, banana fruit. Presents more of a mineral water character which reminds one of organic beers. Honey glazed bread elevates through the finish."
"Drinkability- very drinkable and refreshing, would make a nice summer wheat beer on a hot evening with a barbecue worth another try"
"This beer has lots of bubbly carbonation. It is a bit thin-bodied, which makes it a good hot weather beer, but it seems to lack complexity for the style. The sweetness coats my mouth and hurts the drinkability a bit. Overall, not the best from Victory, but an enjoyable summer offering."
"Pours a transparent light honey color with small fleeting head. Weak artificial vanilla extract aroma makes me turn away. Feeble taste of light floral, stale vanilla, and watered-down hops. Drinkable but not enjoyable, i prefer a thicker and richer wheat beer. There's no personality here and no richness of flavors."
"Im usually not into American Wheats. The aroma is Leininkugle flavor drops and the body is a bit Coors Light. The head disappears with light lacing. Aroma of vanilla, marshmellow, and flowers. Tastes a bit artificial. Germany and Belgium still hold my heart within this style. Not for me...maybe after I run a race."
"D: Decent drinkability, its no hoegaarden spice wise but has a clean flavor making for a good summer time drink."
"It's by no means a bad beer, it's just lacking. I found it too be a little too watery and somewhat bland. On the upside though, it was very refreshing and drinkable."
"(rated Apr 10, 2007)"
"This beer gets points for drinkability, because it was quenching and went down easy, but not very interesting, and not much dimension of flavor. I expected more from Victory since Hop Wollup is one of my new favorites."
"Cloudy orange. Hazy. Big frothy head dissapears into a small ring around the glass. Smell is slightly grassy - maybe a slight citrus smell more orange than anything. Taste is quite crisp up front with a grassy finish. Notes of clove are there. Mouthfeel seems a little week, but could be from growler."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellowish/ orange color with a very thin head. Spicy aroma with hints of citrus orange and lemon peel and banana. Very smooth and crisp with spicy pepper, lemon zest, citrus peel and banana flavor. Slight malt presence as well. Aftertast is a bit metallic and soapy though."
"Drinkability: Refreshing, certainly..and light to medium bodied. Relatively low ABV, and tastes good. Pretty good witbier"
"love victory and I really need to get up to the brewery soon"
"Very much a middle of the road Wit."
"Another tasty brew from Victory. Definitely has sessionable quality to it. Crisp and refreshing."
"This is only my second witbier (first was Hoegaarden) and I'm already a fan of the style."
"D: Another solid offering from Victory, not the greatest Wit beer I've had but a nice supporting actor that shows that they shows off their width of knowledge."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Poured a medium foamy head on a cloudy body. Smell of lemon strongest, light wheatness, and the taste follows that same pattern, although the spice finish is very nice. Came across as rather flat on the mouth, however. Pretty good beer, nothing extraordinary, but the spice level is very good."
"This is a nice, dependable, tasty bev. Nothing amazing, but very satisfying."
"This beer poured a cloudy golden color with a small head and some fairly aggressive carbonation. The smell is sweet fruitiness with a little spiciness. The taste starts off with some banana sweetness that gives way to a little bit of citrus and spice in the finish. The mouthfeel pleasant, with a decent thickness and less carbonation than I expected. This beer is a great example of the style, but lacks in complexity. I wouldn't mind having a couple more, this is a nice refreshing brew."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: goes down smooth and easy but lacks in overall complexity. In my capacity for understanding Belgian style brews this is a fairly average attempt. But Victory brewing still has my vote...I like their brews! Whirlwind is ""worth a try"" in my book!"
"Bought a six pack of this from Consumer Beverage's in Orchard Park, NY. My ratings may be low for this beer because I noticed that the best by date was in March after getting home. I have always enjoyed Victory's offerings but this one had a sour taste with virtually no head immediately after pouring. Very disappointed but will give Victory the benefit of the doubt as I'm sure that it is because of the date. I'm actually more annoyed with Consumer's for keeping on the shelf and myself for not being more alert."
"Drinkability - This is a very good beer and especially tasty in these warm summer months. Just had one with some chicken fajitas, the pairing worked well. Whirlwind gets two thumbs up from me."
"Try it if you've tired of the cliche' Sam Summer, or Blue Moon"
"cloudy yellow color with a short white head with some lace not a lot. aromas a lot better spicy with clove and pepper and lemon. peppery tasting up front wheat and tangy yeast hits you next ending with spice and clove great taste. lots of carbonation which just adds to the taste. only thing is could not get all the sediment off the bottom which i think would also have added a little more to it. just added to my list of good witbier."
"D: Pretty good. Light but with some flavor to keep it interesting. It was finished pretty quickly. . . ."
"Poured with a murky yellow color with some orange in the light. Decent head at first, but it quickly evaporates. Mostly what is nice to see is all the floaty flakes often in suspension in the lower quarter of the drink. Some lacing but it usually settles down. Aromas were strong but not too appetizing. Pine smells were particularly noticeable with really zesty lemon. It felt both natural but artificial at the same time: really invigorating aromas that also smelled like a Lysol spray. Still give props for its uniqueness in my book. Taste was much better than what the aromas would tell: very refreshing and strong in citrus, bready flavors. Somewhat watery but perfect for the summer heat. Like I said, so far for the summer, this must be one of the more refreshing beers I have had. Strong flavors, but wicked light, refreshing body. Overall, if you can get over some of the awkward flavoring, this is a good one."
"D: OK drinkability. A very decent witbier."
"Not a bad beer, average by my estimation. I wouldn't be opposed to drinking it again, but not more than one or two; and if other options were available I'd go for them."
"This is an average witbier but a very refreshing summertime beer."
"Light yellow cloudy beer with a quickly fading head.Aroma is disgusting,it actually smeels like mustard.Taste is nutmeg and lemon...yuck.I am a fan of Victory products but this is just plain unenjoyable.I will label this as one step below garbage.Yuck."
"D- This one is no standout but it does its job for a summer seasonal, its refreshing and highly drinkable."
"Overall - Very drinkable. However, I was expecting some orange zest as this is supposed to be a Belgian Wit but I could not detect any. It would have scored a little higher if it had detectable orange in the aroma and taste."
"Slightly hazy medium gold with a small, white head that quickly diminishes to a thin film. Some very light lacing early. Smell is fruity, crisp and mild. Taste follows, with its fruitiness being most notable, but some spice shows up halfway through. Lemon, coriander, green apple, and some spicy, bready yeast toward the finish. It has a medium-light body, lightly dry texture, and moderate carbonation. At the time, I really enjoyed this beer because it was very refreshing and easy-drinking. In retrospect, I would have liked a little more character in there. It was a very mild beer, but good nevertheless."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Light and almost flat soda like on the palate. Don't get me wrong, I like what this beer has become in the past two years(unfortunately for me, I thought I was buying something fresh) but the ginger taste it has taken on with a really light and delicate carbonation makes this feel like a ginger ale going flat. However, this is one that I'll be looking for again, I will try to find this before the season is up this year and I'll definitely be interested to find what it tastes like fresh. Hey, it must be good its held up pretty damn well for two years."
"D: Not the best witbier out there, but certainly worth a try."
"D: This is a decent wheat beer. It has all of the typical characteristics, including the aftertaste on the finish. There is nothing particularly interesting that sets this brew apart from so many others. It's a decent summer drink and it will probably be more palatable to those that appreciate a decent witbier."
"beer is light and goes down easy. I'm not a wheat beer guy at all, but this one is very drinkable. I'd definitely have another if i ever bought wheat beers except to sample them."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a slightly hazy, golden yellow with 2 cm of white foamy, quickly diminishing head. Aroma is floral and fruity, lemon and a hint of orange. Initial flavor is kind of a watered down citrus drink with some wheat. End flavor is similar, after taste is not long lived. Light body, minimal carbonation, minimal lacing, and the alcohol really never made it out in taste or aroma. Overall, it falls into a style of beer I tend not to appreciate, but I guess it is par for the course."
"D: Warm weather beer. A good beer to have in the fridge amongst the offerings for the acquired taste. This is the beer for the girlfriend to have."
"D- Easy to drink but lacks complexity and originality. I will give this one another try sometime if given the chance."
"D. Fairly drinkable, a good beer but better on tap."
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a sticky off-white head. Aromas noticed are dried fruit and a belgian spice character. Taste begins with that belgian spice up front, and slightly gives way to a combination of toasted malt and a very small citric hop presence. Mild carbonation and light-medium body make this brew very drinkable. Great summertime brew here."
"Drinkability: Sessionable to the extreme - It'd be easy to drink a few of these without a second thought. Sadly, I've only got one."
"Drinkability: Sometimes, it's hard to describe beers. However, I feel this is a solid witbier if not the best that I've had. Definitely worth trying."
"Good drinkability, a smooth wheat beer that isn't amazing, but great to drink."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was an amber brown that had a touch of reddish orange. When poured had an 1 finger bubbly white head. Head disappeared quickly and left only a small ring around the top. Fair amount of sediment was visible, but didn't notice it in tasting. Aroma was yeasty with touches of green olives. Taste seemed to have banana and white sandwich bread. A little acidic in the mouth, but fairly easy to drink."
"M/D: Crisp, carbonation a little prickly, light, smooth bodied. Decent drinkability."
"It poured a nice color, with a nice cloudiness, not much head or pronounced aroma. I did not get much of a yeast taste, nor overly pronounced citrus flavors. It seemed to be a watered down version of the witbiers I enjoy."
"D: Went superbly with grilled eggplant and grilled soft shell crab. This is one Im going to be having several of through the summer in the back yard. Thanks Victory."
"Poured bright golden yellow into a pint glass with a small head that fizzled away soon and swirls of cloudiness. The smell was nice and bready with yeasty fruits and a hint of spice. The taste though, was all cloves and spice. After that you can taste the yeast and wheat, but they really are eclipsed by the spice. Mouthfeel was good, creamy with a nice amount of carbonation and overall it's a nice quaff on a warm day with a hot dog. Not my favorite wit by any means though."
"D - I wouldn't mind having a few of these, even if a little flavorless. Nothing terribly offensive, but there are certainly better witbiers out there. Refreshing and smooth overall."
"The feel was very smooth but overall the body was almost flat. There should be more carbonation here. A refreshing and tasty brew with a mediocre feel."
"Notes. I was surprised how much I hated this beer.The first Victory offering I would not reccomend."
"A decent witbier, but not a brilliant one by any stretch. The beer pours a fairly pale yellow with some cloudiness. There are no yeasty bits floating about and the cloudiness is faint. There is some carbonation to the beer, but it is quite watery. The smell is quite good in that you will get the very typical whiff of wheat, some bubblegum berry like notes, and a bit of spice. The aroma is standard fare, and good. The taste is a bit disappointing, but not bad. It is fairly subdued, but there is spice, rind, lemon citrus, some berry like sweetness, and then there is a sourish, slightly off taste in the finish. I'm guessing some nutty flavors popping through that shouldn't really be there and some pepperiness. The lingering aftertaste is not winning any points for this beer. This is a drinkable beer, quite light and watery, not all that substantial, but not bad either."
"Pours a hazy golden color with thick chunkies floating around, no head to speak of, despite my swirling of the bottle, and minimal lacing. Smells sweet and malty and taste is the same with loads of spice and orange peel. Medium bodied, very light carbonation and all around decent witbier."
"Oddly enough, I do not think that this review really represents how much I actually like this beer..."
"To me, Whirlwind Wit misses the mark as to getting dialed in to the style. Yes, it has some of the characteristics of the style, but the feel and especially that smokiness are too much of a distraction. Drinkable; yes. Quaffable; not so much."
"It looks and smell fine enough. Aroma-wise, perhaps a bit more coriander and spice than I like in my wits but there's a clove smell than ties it somewhat together. Taste is but maltier than expected. The wheat is cllovey but it has a smokiness that is altogether non-witbier. Even if it's not awful - the strange flavors lower the drinkability."
"D: Quite a good witibier, easy to drink and tasty, one of the better American ones that I have had."
"The mouthfeel was very smooth and a hair light, perfect for the summer. A very refreshing brew. Probably would be good with some seafood or something Asian...?"
"Pours a semi-transparent golden amber; there is a fair amount of cloudiness apparent. Aroma is rich, malty and wheaty, with a very strong lemon component. Flavor is well-rounded, malty with a decided citrus overtone. Texture is smooth and pleasing. Perfect for a warm afternoon or with a light dinner."
"All in all, drinkable enough in warm weather, but nothing too differential to others of the style. Comparable to a Blue Moon or Hoegaarden."
"Solid wheat beer from Victory. Classic cloudy gold color when poured from the bottle. Initial taste is crisp and clean taste with a hint of grass in the taste. Limited after taste. Great beer for the summer time after mowing the line. No reason not to go buy a six pack."
"Solid if unspectacular. The beer pours a brilliant, hazy golden with a white head that dissipates quickly. Good estery Whitbier aroma with a pleasant flavor of spice - mostly clove and coriander. Nice, rich spicy mouthfeel with a good carbonation on the tongue. Good, refreshing beer."
"O: Too spicy for me, not impressed."
"D - Pretty decent offering from Victory, but certainly not one of my favorites. It's got quite a spicy kick and lots of flavors swirling around, though. Give it a shot."
"D: The addition of the spicing really adds to the taste and mouthfeel, but when comparing it to others of this style its not quite as drinkable due to the spicing."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Poured cloudy gold with a white 1 inch head leaving behind scattered lacing. The beer smelled fruity with citrus and banana standouts. Tasted bready and sweet with hints of lemon and orange and faint hints of banana. Well carbonated with thin to medium body and a nice bready yeast mouthfeel. Very nice example of this style. Nice warm weather brew. A must try."
"MF&D - Thin-Medium body, easy drinking. Great choice for a summer brew."
"d: This is a perfect summertime brew."
"D- goes down smooth without any issues and i could easily put a few of these away. Very light in and alcohol doesnt pose asfar as flavor."
"Bottle bought from the Park Slope Food Coop. 12oz with an experation date of 4-30-08. Poured a cloudy orange with an extremely thin head. Very effervescent. Corriander aroma. Tart and citrusy sweet. Very tasty. Fizzy fresh mouthfeel. Very drinkable, I really miss having this beer. Hopefully it will make it down here in TX soon."
"The lighter side of Victory."
"I paired the last bottle in the six pack with pasta and a marinara sauce, and despite being a mediocre beer, it was a nice match for the tomato sauce."
"not one of my favorites"
"Clear, light lemon peel yellow with minimal white head. Smells strongly of lemon. Sweet lemon zest and tart lemon with moldy belgian yeast and a bit of clove. I have to be honest this beer smells terrrible. The taste is only slightly better: light lemon-lime soft drink flavoring to go along a bit of wheat and yeast (not the same as the foul smelling stuff from the nose thank goodness), and a bit of spice to go along with it. Mouthfeel is light and watery, lacking the significant carbonation characterized by the style. Have to be honest; I was not expecting it but this was one of the worst beers I've had in a while. I hope for Victory's sake I simply got a bad bottle."
"Overall? Despite the akward appearance, it's a tasty beer that would appeal to a wide array of people."
"The flavor starts out rather tame, with the wheat and malt up front. Banana flavor along with some earthy spices round out the flavor. Not exactly a whirlwind of flavor, but it's nicely crafted. Mouthfeel is bubbly and thin, but not too watery. This is a decent session beer for those who enjoy wits."
"Taste is similar, very clean though. The flavors from the spices and yeast aren't very aggresive and let the body really shine through--light and crisp with lively carbonation that is just right, tremendously drinkable. I wish i was drinking this on a hot summer day, it would be extremely refreshing. Very solid offering overall from victory. Man, the more I drink it the better the yeasts start to taste. I wish there was more yeast in mine, i like em real cloudy. I also wish it looked better in the glass, but I guess you can't have everything."
"At first glance, this beer poured with minimal or no head... The aroma is a sublime citrus-scent with wheat predominating. At the initial taste, nothing fancy or over-the-top, but nonetheless a good, decent witbier that deserves some recognition. I've tried better and I've tried worse, but overall I was not dissapointed with this selection. Was able to find this in November, although this is supposed to be a summer-time beer... The taste is a little spicy but cannot compare to some other brews I've sampled... All said, worth a try and definitely an above-average sample..."
"Poured into an IPA glass with a pale straw color. Generous, white foamy head dissipated quickly. Subtle smells of cloves, yeast and wheat. Taste was somewhat thin - definitely a witbier in presentation, but lacking the flavor of other wits out there. Nicely carbonated and somewhat lively in the mouth, with a slightly bitter finish. Not bad, but I've had better."
"Pours a gold color with a think white head which quickly dissipates. No lacing at all. Smell was clovelike with some yeasty notes. Taste was weak. Very faint clove like flavors and not much else. Very water-downed and light-bodied. Easy to drink but not much else going on. Expected more."
"This beer does a very good job of mixing carbonation and zest with clean, wheat taste. It is not near the top of Witbiers that I had tried, but it is definitely a solid beer."
"this poured a hazy gold with a minimal and quickly diminishing head and no lacing to speak of. nose was nice, with classic wit aromas of lemony citrus and spicy coriander. malt presence was minimal in this, as it was mostly sour with a bit of spiciness. somewhat thin and puckering. lacks the soft malt character which i find appealing in a wit."
"D- After all, it is a great beer. But, the taste is rich and fruity, leaving you after a couple wanting something a little more stout. Could over-do this one with too many."
"Pours into the tumbler a highly-carbonated pale yellow. A bit clear for a wheat beer and not much head evident, but there is good lace left on the glass. The smell is loaded with creamy wheat, soft orange, and sharp clove notes as you'd expect for the style. Superbly creamy body is light and effervescent. Tastes super smooth and subtly integrated. The soft wheat tones blend right into the creamy orange and clove spices. Not especially adventurous, but spot-on for the style."
"Very nice belgian wit. It had an excellent golden coloring with great head and lacing. It was very smooth with a nice wheat scent and flavoring. It had nice soft flavor hints of spices and orange that gave it a nice touch. Well worth a try on a hot day, or any type of day for that matter."
"D: Tasty, goes down as easily, not filling at all, very good representation of style, it’s a good lighter beer to drink a lot of, but I would pick a several other Witbiers that I’d choose first."
"Taste is mild and pleasant with a clean start onto a more creamy mouthfeel then a slightly more fruity finish. In my opinion the finish and back end of this beer are where it shines. Those hints of berry, orange, lemon, round, yet peppery coriander, are present. Lingers on the sides of the tongue making you want more. Good, subtle, quaffable beer, very quenching and pleasant."
"Beer is good - Victory brews some of the best!"
"I had this on draught a few weeks ago at the Taco Mac on E/W Connector, but wanted to have a go at it in a bottle. I must say, it is quite different. Appearance is much more on par with style guidelines from the bottle, with a pale yellow, cloudy look remenicent of Hoegaarden or Wittekerke. Smell on draught was very *average*, while smell from the bottle seemed a bit richer, and thus, a little more impressive. Taste on draught is very good with loads of spice and delicious flavours. Taste in the bottle was muted spices and seems a bit thinner. Mouthfeel in the bottle seemed a bit less impressive than draught, as well, and likewise, drinkability. I enjoied this for sure, and would probably buy it again, but it's a bit better on draught."
"D- Very refreshing, a good example of the style, especially from the US."
"I expected a bit more from Whirlwind Wit, but it's not bad. I get it if I see it on tap at a bar or at the brewery, but I probably won't buy anymore bottles."
"D: This is a disappointing offering from Victory, which is one of my favorite breweries. It's missing most of the good things about a witbier. Not particularly drinkable."
"Overall - I love this beer. Its right up there with Hoegaarden as my favorite of this style."
"The taste is big and citrusy up front with flavours of clove and some banana but it all works up front only..the flavours fall off quickly midway through and it finishes really watery. If at least some of the flavour lasted, I'd have liked it more. Pretty disappointing for me and I'll not revisit this brew."
"Victory's Whirlwind is a witbeer in the style of Belgium greats like Hoegaarden. Unlike a Hoegaarden though, which can be a bit too grainy and murky at times for the superheat the season is giving us right now, this may be unfiltered but delivers a much cleaner presentation from start to finish. Scents of citrus and bananas, a nice fizziness on the tongue with a nice balance of lemon peel and light bitter hops to keep it from being too sweet (the downfall of many an American made wheat style for me) and general earthiness. The aftertaste reminds me of something a little spicy and is that blueberries I'm thinking as well too? This is a damn good twist on the summer wheat styles. Completely thirst quenching and refreshing especially on a doing yard work in a scorcher of a day like today. If this is any indication of Victory's does with they're other brews I will be sure to try some of the other things they make soon and (hopefully) on a regular basis."
"drinkability - One of the best Wiribier beers I have tried, nice for a hot day."
"Starts a touch fizzy but fleshes out with some good thickness on the finish. Refreshment is not a quality lacking in this beer as, regardless of how true to the witbier style it is or isn't, this goes down easy. This could be a bore in the winter but it's more than welcome in the heat."
"This is descent Witbier, very crisp and highly carbonated. Pours a very light and hazy gold. It has a citrus taste with a slight spice and bitter mouth feel. I'd say overall very drinkable, just about everyone can enjoy this style of beer. Cheers!"
"D: Overall, not as impressive as I'd have liked. With the summer having already rolled around, I've been keeping my eye out for Wits, Hefeweizens, Pilsners, etc. that would be great to drink on a hot day. This one lacks too much in the flavor and mouthfeel departments for me, so I'll probably keep searching."

"Very drinkable, smooth, and thirst quenching."
"Pours a hazy, light amber with a fairly thick, solid white head that reduces to a surface covering fairly quickly. Nice nose of tart fleshy fruit and citrus with a bit of a spice aroma. The taste is a wheaty, bready, doughy maltiness that lingers in the back of the throat as tangy fruits make their way in. Exceptionally smooth. Crisp, light, fizzy mouthfeel that was just a bit thinner than I would have wanted. A very nice quenching beer that goes down easy and has some complexity. It might not hold my interest over the course of an entire evening, but it's a perfect summer refreshment. Particularly with a lighter meal like a salad nicoise or shrimp, mozzarella, tomato and basil salad."
"Go and get some."
"I'll have more of this. Very drinkable. Perfect for a summer refresher. Spot on for style, and not as yeasty as its German cousin the Hefeweizen."
"Poured a slightly hazy yellow color with a fizzy white head. The head snapped and popped like a soda...and then fizzled to nothing. Mild aromas of dough, citrus, and grain. Taste was very mild, but citrus lemon dominated the palate with grassy and earthy undertones. Thin mouthfeel. Overall this is disapointing compared to Victory's other brews. Definitely sessionable, but there are so many better Witbiers out there."
"D - ok drinkability."
"Good price by the case as well. I have had this on tap at the brewery, and it is even better, fresher, I encourage all to give it a try."
"Drinkability is decent, a good example of the style but a little plain."
"Pours a hazey-golden in color, appears almost white (and quite opaque) in the muted light of the bar. Thin whisp of a head and minimal lacing. Light wheat malt and a hint of subtle aromatic spice on the nose . . . peppery. Tangy and zesty on the first sip, with coriander being the dominant (albeit not overpowering) spice. Lightly tangy-sour,and with just enough crystal malt sweetness to counterbalance the yeast and spice. Although this was served rather cold, it tends to open up nicely as it warms. Lighter in body and mouthfeel, Whirlwind seems almost watery at first, but the body, too, tends to develop as this warms. Ample carbonation, and combined with the zesty, spicey, yeasty aspects makes this a cleansing and almost brisk drink. Lemony (lemon rind?) aftertaste lingers and augments the light, aromatic hops used, definitely not very bitter. Insanely drinkable . . . Whirlwind Wit has been a very consistent brew over the years, and for that reason remains my favorite American rendition of the Witbier style."
"Got this one in a bottle on a make-your-own-sixer. Pours a straw color, a one finger of head with some oddly large bubbles that didn't stick around. No lacing to speak of. Basically it looks alright. Nose is wheat, some yeast, and fruitiness; mostly lemon and a little apricot. Taste is strong and interesting for a witbier. In no particular order: breadiness, citrus (lemon mainly), good amount of yeast and coriander. Feel is medium to thin body, solid carbonation. Worst part of this one is definitely the look; after about 10 seconds, there's basically no head; it seems like this might be a bottling issue. In any case, it's tasty, although not necessarily one of Victory's best. Could be sessionable, although I might go for Hoegaarden over this one."
"12 oz bottle, best by 4/8/08. Pours a pale cloudy yellow with a finger of white fizzy head that quickly reduces to a ring of foam. Nose is nicely yeasty with a slight lemon zest and a bit of peppery spiciness. Taste is a nice smooth wheat overlaid with a slight lemon and citrus fruitiness, with a yeasty slightly clove finish. Medium bodied with a moderate/high carbonation, clean and smooth drinking. This is a pretty solid beer overall, easy drinking, and good for the warm weather."
"D - Exceptionally good, this beer is easy to drink and refreshing on a hot day."
"I am a bit let down by this beer, but only because I expect so much whenever I try a Victory beer for the first time, and I have heard some great things about this particular beer. I think it is a bit too heavy on the lemon for my taste. I'm sure I'll give it another shot in the future however."
"Very light watery mouthfeel,almost like drinking water. Lacks taste to be drinkable for me. Not offensive in any way,just nothing to keep me interested. Would be a good starter beer for the ladies."
"Recommended."
"D- This is a good session beer. I will probably get this one again but its not my favorite witbier. It is very good and tasty though."
"This beer poured a very cloudy straw color and formed a small white bubbly head that left trace lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, citrus and yeast/bread. This defininately smells like a hefe style beer. The flavor was of hops, citrus and a small bit of dough. The body is light and the finish a touch sprite. A nice hefe, it's just a shame it's hard to get in Columbus."
"Whirlwind Witbier pours a cloudy light yellow with a fizzy head. Aroma is sharp and grainy, with a good amount of chalky yeast and just a hint of coriander. Taste is almost dry, with a nice light spicy flavor. Yeast flavor is there but not overdone. It was so nice out today, I felt like I had to have a good easy drinking summer beer tonight and this beer did not disappoint."
"Overall impression: Decent wit - plenty drinkable, but certainly not the most interesting I've tried."
"Drinkability: Tastes good and drinkable...like a wheat beer should be!"
"From a 12 oz bottle with a ""enjoy by"" date of 25 Oct 06 ... oops, Im a little late. Light yellow with a nice strata of bubbles rising to a thin airy head. The aroma is slightly yeasty, somewhat sweet and inviting. The first swallow was nicely fruity, lemony without any citric acidity. The characteristics carry thru the whole glass. Dont think the somewhat lack of freshness hurt this one at all. Nice light Wit. (#2737, 3/7/2007)"
"M/D- Easy to drink, light, crisp, bubbly....nice domestic wit....also a good one for people trying to get into craft beer."
"Poured a light gold color with a heavy haze, i had followed my assumptions and swirled before pouring. No head to speak of, but a light lace that stayed til the end. The smell reminded me of finished wood and farm fields. Initial taste was kind of grassy and even a bit of pine, which gave way to a slightly sweet, but mostly sour, citrus backing. A standard body, but with plenty of carbonation. Finished dry with the sourness lingering, very easy to drink. Definitly more interesting flavor-wise than the standard IPA's i'm used to. i'll have to pick up a few other brands to compare this to."
"D - It's not going to dethrone Hoegaarden...but the Whirlwind is going to right by its side! One of the most refreshing summer beers I've sampled."
"Taste was also pretty good. Tasted like a wit should (from what I know), and I tasted spice and coriander. Not the best witbier I've had, but pretty good. There wasn't anything artificial-tasting in this wit, which can't be said for others (Blue Moon). The label claimed Belgian yeast...but I'm not refined enough to detect those sorts of things."
"Victory makes the tasties."
"Another incredible beer from Victory. This is my quintessential summer beer. On a hot day, sitting outside, this is pretty hard to beat."
"The texture is about right, maybe a touch too much carbonation. Taste is decent but unspectacular. It has the citrus and wheat trappings; there's just isn't any zing like when I pop a Southampton or a Hoegaarden. I've got 32 days on the drink by date so that's not it. I guess it's just a fairly uninspired offering from Victory. Oh well, guys, get 'em next time."
"This is a terrific example of a belgian style done well here in the USA. This beer pours a light yellow color with a moderate head. The smell is exceedingly sweet, and you can tell there is not much more to it than spices and malts. The taste is strikingly similar to beers i've had in Europe of a similar style, most notably Hoegaarden. A perfect blend of spices make this an ideal beer for just wanting to have a solid witte beer."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, quite thirst-quenching and drinkable. You could certainly put down 2-3 of these before you realized it. Which I believe I will proceed to do...."
"Best before Oct 25. Light color, slightly cloudy, little head. Nice clean smell, bit of Belgium, but not outstanding. Grain, straw, maybe a little grassy taste. Really nice mouthfeel and drinkability. I'd prefer something a little more bitter for sessions, but this is a great summer thirst-quencher."
"This beer pours a pale hazy yellow with a thin head that dissipates immediately leaving nothing. The smell is in your face with the wheat with some lingering sweetness. The taste is where the beer is most impressive. It is of course strong with wheat flavor but there is more to it. There is also a lemony flavor as well as something that I cannot describe as anything other than cake batter? Anyways the beer has a light body and is a tad overcarbonated. Overall, a drinkable beer."
"Its drinkable and not offensive, but it is a very mediocre beer. I'm hoping that I got a bad batch, because I typically expect a lot more from Victory than this."
"Pours a hazy straw with the yeast pour, thin one finger head quickly dissapears and leaves no lacing. Mild aroma of wheat, coriander and orange peel. Sweet extra pale malt and tannic wheat upfront, followed by a pleasently acidic clovey yeast bite and weak orange peel and coriander spice. Aftertaste of light herbal hops and spice that balance the flavor and dry the tounge. Thin, almost watery body and lively carbonation make this a bit too crisp even for the style. This is a light summer beer with a nice overall flavor, superb drinkability, and a few mild nuances, but I have come to expect more from such an over-the-top brewery."
"Overall, this beer has a ways to go to match Hoeggarden and Blanche de Chambly, two witbiers I tried this past weekend."
"This ones tasty for sure on tap. Seek it out. The fruits in this one really steal the show."
"D: Very tasty. I'd recommend this as a summer offering any day. Goes down very fast."
"This is a delicious and crisply refreshing summer-time quencher. Pours hazy sunshine yellow with a creamy white head. Aroma is bready citrus with flowery hop notes. Taste is bready wheat malts, slightly spicy, citrusy hops and notes of summer fruit (berries) from the yeast??? Refreshingly tingly on the palate with abundant fine carbonation. Light mouthfeel, combined with overall refreshing character makes this a very drinkable summer treat."
"Overall, this isn't the deepest, most complex beer in town, but if you're looking for a basic summer beer with some craft touches, Victory's Whirlwind is a good place to start. This along with Arcadia's Whitsun are both great, reasonably priced options for summer quaffing."
"I tip my hat to beerbeing for the brew!"
"Overall: A good amount of carbonation in this brew. Qaulity flavors, but nothing above and beyond. Still a refreshing, true to style wit."
"Drinkability is good, not high, no complaints, but nothing to draw my back. Prosit MK"
"You see lots of tiny suspended sediments of yeast amidst three columns of bubbles and a pale yellow mixed with frost covered glass. Ther smell is as pale as the look, but in a not so good way. Hints of spices but very muted and some slightly sweet wheat mixed with very pale and crystal malts. The flavor really reflects the aroma well. Light wheat and pronounced malt character with mixes of spice. Very sessionable beer if it had better flavor."
"Very light and refreshing with a palette cleaning dryness in the aftertaste."
"Pours clear? Pale, no cloudy, with no head as it fizzes out and leaves scum. Odd for a wit. That stick, sweet wheat aroma, and little for hops. Taste is pretty good surprisingly, dry and not ultra sweet, somewhere between SA and Hoegaarden. Drinable and refreshing on a hot day. Does the job. Mouthfeel is not milky nor heavy, bit of tang from the carbonation. Despite defying typical rules, this one wins. Finding it fresh required traveling a way, and it's not one I'll seek out, but it's a good drinker for a style I have a hard time finding selections I enjoy."
"I think this is one of the blander witbiers I've tried, and it hurts me to say it. Victory is so good at most beer styles..."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden, small white head forms, but goes fast, a few lace spots. Smell is sweet, wheat, citrus/vanilla, and banana/spice. Taste is sweet up front, some spices, citrus and wheat, vanilla and banana in the finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low carbonation. Not a bad wit, thanks DrJay!"
"Paired well with a simple baked cod dish served with couscous and wax beans. Not strong enough to overpower either the fish or the sides, but bubbly enough to cleanse the palate."
"Overall, it's not terrible by any means, but it's disappointing nevertheless. It's not a very good example of the style."
"Drinkability: One of the better and more readily available (in the summer that is) domestic Wits in my opinion. Perfect for this ridiculously hot weather we're having in mid-July."
"Pours a light, milky lemon/straw color. The head is somewhat shallow, but bright white. Its an average looking Wit. The liquid is very effervescent. It presents a grassy aroma, full of coriander and citrus. Spice, lemon, orange peel, and esters. The taste is fresh and citric. Theres plenty of coriander and citrus in the aroma, along with a mildly tart acidity. Its not very complex, however, and (despite just a little twang) lacks real wheat flavor. Its slightly sweet in the foretaste, which provides a nice balance to the tartness. Theres a little yeast flavor in the brew as well. The beer gets a little bitter near the finish. Its fairly refreshing and pretty easy to drink. Ive had this one in the past, but this current experience didnt hold up to my memory."
"Better than the Weiss bier they make and better every year I have had it. The sulfury smell and taste is not in this beer any longer and they seemed to have tuned back the spices. The smell and the flavor of the corriander and/or zest melds well with the wheat and yeast flavors. The hazy beer leaves good lace and has a solid body for style. Very drinkable for long enjoyment all day."
"On tap at the Victory brewpub. The beer poured a hazy yellow color with a medium white head and minimal lacing on the glass. The aroma of this beer has some yeast and wheat notes and noticable touches of orange and spice. The taste is refreshing and has the same year notes and citrus tones that make for a very drinkable summertime beer."
"Pours a rather clear pale yellow with a nice foamy head that dissipates quickly. Nose is a bit yeasty with light lemon notes. Taste is a good balance of sourness, light maltiness, and refreshing citrus. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, no lacing and sort of flat. Overall, an enjoyable easy drinking witbier."
"Cheer!"
"Overall, I am very impressed by this effort. This is a well-balanced and eminently drinkable beer. Perfect for sitting out in the summer sun, sipping while catching rays or any other seasonal activity."
"d: very enjoyable. Something to be enjoyed on a very hot day (as I did)."
"Pours a golden color, plenty of haze, a small white head. I had tons of carbonation, but it faded after a few minutes. Smell is mostly of yeast, as expected for the style. Maybe a hint of citrus, but the yeast dominates. The taste is the same, a very light mouthfeel, not a very potent flavor but good for a nice hot summer day. A tart almost fruit flavor rounds out the end with no big aftertaste. A good brew, easy to gulp and easy to enjoy."
"Definitely worth a try in the summer."
"12oz brown bottle with drink before date of 10/26/06. Pours a cloudy light gold with minimal head and OK lace. Nice tart yeasty smells. Aromas of orange and honey. Standard wit flavor. Tarness with hints of banana, clove orange and honey. Crisp and easy drinking. Not the best example of the style but still a decent and good summertime brew."
"Pours with a light apple juicy color with minimal head that forms a ring, but no lace, around the top. The nose is very lemony, with a low-end and subdued coriander note; the effect here is not nearly as aromatic as many other witbiers. Plenty of acidity up front that tickles the sides of the tongue, followed by a slightly bready and spicy finish. The taste emphasis is much more on acidity and cleanliness, it seems, than robust taste. Overall it's fine but nothing special -- refreshing but a bit boring."
"Drinkability: Something that I would have to buy and try again on a hot Summers day. As of now, this would have to be one of the best Summer beers I've tried lately. Another winner from the brewery form Downingtown, PA!"
"Purchased at Mr. Bottle Beverage in Berwyn, PA; new shipment so freshness expected. It pours to a slightly hazy golden, with only a small quarter inch of a very white head. Aromas are brisk and quickly noticeable; lemon zest, orange peel, general citrus, cloves. Carbonation is on the lighter side, tangy citrus predominates followed by a clove flavor that combines with a smooth mouthfeel. Lemon takes the cake for aftertaste without being overtly forceful at all. Easily drinkable in warmer weather, especially now on a hot, humid, and very rainy day. This would be one of my choice brews to watch a ballgame with."
"Overall- nothing special here. Has a nice tart flavor."
"Da little too flowery for me, but a nice change of pace for the summer, I suppose. Doubt I would have it again due to the perfume notes."
"Another good beer from the folks at victory. Keep up the good work."
"D - Based on other reviews I have to imagine I got a bad bottle but I did have several other people sample this one and they all agreed. Another person came up with bologna. Liquid hot dogs or bologna are very unpleasant."
"Quite a wheat beer. Has all it should, and then some."
"Good take on the style - love that belgian yeast. Refreshing but not weak."
"this an awesome beer, victory does it again."
"Victory's Whirlwind Witbier is only slight above average across the board. The smell is slightly fruity and grassy. The taste is understated, in being faintly lemony and grassy. The after taste is wet and there is a minor residue of some sort which sits on the tongue. Definitely not worthy of a $9.99 price tag. At half the price it might become a somewhat acceptable brew for quenching a thirst after mowing the lawn. Depending on your geographic locality, there are likely to be siginificantly better witbier options available. Can't recommend."
"Cheers!"
"The appearance is average for a witbier, pale golden with an average head that didn't persist through the whole beer. I am not keen on witbier with too much coriander, the scent is a bit stronger on coriander than the taste was, but it was still quite wheaty and zesty. I thought the taste and aftertaste were the standout qualites of this beer. Sweet, refreshing wheat malt is what dominates the taste, but there are many undertones from coriander and nutmeg flavors, to orange and lemon zest. The spice in this beer creates a zing in your mouth, like mint would for instance, as you have one or two. That mouthfeel, along with the light bodied character make for a very drinkable beer. I had trouble not giving it a 5 for drinkability. One of my favorite hot day brews I have come across."
"I could drink this all day and into the night. Like the bottle blurb says, I think this beer is going to be my spring fling."
"A light, but authentic wit. Pours a hazy straw yellow without much retention on the white head. Smells yeasty with a bit of malt in the back. Tastes not of corriander so much, but just light belgian malts, yeast and citrus. Refreshing to drink. Not a great wit, but true to style and pretty nice to drink."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a light body. The beer is well balanced. This beer may have replaced my previous favorite summer brew. This is most definately a beer treat. This will definately be my summer go to brew."
"Slightly hazy, light yellow/gold colour with a thin whisp of white head that falls to a solid ring. Aromas of coriander, sharp lemon, yeasty bread and floral hops. Coriander is quite strong in the flavour and the malt is crackery and wheaty. Low bitterness lets the lemon character show through in the finish. Lightish body with moderate carbonation. Slightly drying, fairly crisp on the palate. A nice beer for summertime."
"While the thin body is a little distracting, it does make this beer extremely easy to drink quickly. A good alternative to usual lawnmower beers, but just average as a wit."
"poured from bottle into a wide mouth goblet. This beer has a pale yellow cloudy appearance with a very thin head and almost no lacing. It has a strong wheaty, citrus, and coriander smell to it. It smells quite nice. It tastes somewhat ""yeasty"" with a tart/dry lemon/orange backtaste. It finishes quite well and I think it would be a great session beer. It reminds me of ""lawn mower beer"" but with great taste behind it."
"Drinkablity - goes down very easy and is good beer. Very sessionable."
" I prefer my witbiers to have more of a wheat and citrus base to them, but this was just as good in my book, even though the flavors were not what I'm normally used to. It's always a treat to expand my tastes and palate to something new and untried, and this beer accomplished those tasks quite easily. Certainly worth a shot for those who love well-crafted witbiers, a session brew, something a bit out of the ordinary, or all of the above at once!"
"Very satifying, a perfect warm weather relaxer. Hard to pass up on this."
"Overall an easily drinkable beer. I will finish the six pack that I bought, but probably won't buy another. I have had many better beers of this style."
"Everything you'd expect from a Witbier - hazy, cloudy visablity, well carbinated, with a sweet wheat-orange peel aroma. Doesn't really seem to add anything new to style, but it captures it perferctly. A very light body, which allows it to be very refreshing."
"Not a bad beer here,"
"Not one of my favorite Wits. I was expecting much more from Victory, who brew some wonderful beers. Bizarre, odd flavors throughout and probably tainted by oxidation. Needs cleaned up with some more sweetness. Just not tasting good to me. For what it's worth, I bought a 6'er of this and took 5 bottles of it back to swap for some odd-n-ends singles."
"I had trouble finishing this one, good thing I had a Miller Lite to wash it down. Miserable beer. I am very disappointed with Victory for this one. DONT BUY!!"
"Overall a Wit that started very promising (appearance & smell) then just kinda took a dive. Very muted in the tart/citrus components but definitely hearty in the musty yeast and hearty malt profile. Malt vs. Quenching tart...the malt wins by a TKO."
"Drinkability: This is a very good ale, perfect for sitting and watching the world pass by."
"This is a nice little witbier, similar in my estimation, to Hoegaarden wit. Nice lemony taste to it as it is a fairly clear wit. The smell is lemony also and has a little head upon pouring. Very smooth and drinkable if you love wits, this is a pretty good american version."
"This brew pours a hazy pale yellow color. The head is small, white and diminishes quickly into sparce lacing. The aroma is of orange peel with coriander in the back ground. The taste is rather mellow: orange, coriander, and tangy wheat in the finish. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with lively carbonation that makes it very refreshing. Overall, this isn't the best witbier, but it is still very drinkable."
"Drinkability could be very good on the right occasion."
"Overall I find this a pleasure to drink, and drink, and drink, and drink..."
"Victory is a solid brewery and they just keep putting out good beer after good beer."
"Drinkability - I enjoyed this sixer, it would make a good summer drinker."
"I drank this while sampling Hoegarden and Holy Moses. I wish I was able to do something like that more often."
"Smells peppery and of orange/lemon rind, and a little of something I smelled in the hospital today. Taste has quite a bit of lemon, with wheat and a bit spicy and grassy. This would be really good in the summer. Good carbonation and body, but without the aftertaste paste. Again, would be great summer beer."
"Pours a very pale, clear yellow, with some bubbles coming through that look like sand. Aroma is very strong, in a good way of citrus zest. Flavor is light, but there is enough there to keep you interested. The blast of orange or lemon zest hits you, and then it's wiped away by the malts and heady carbonation. This is probably one of the best American takes on this style. I'm SO happy that Victory is distributed in Michigan now."
"A light amber cloudy looking beer with a smallish head.I'm always excited to try new,to me,Victory beers.This is very aromatic.You can really smell the fruityness and floral scents.This has a very fruity,lemony,grassy,taste with a bit of wheat.A nice full m/f.Not my favorite type of beer,but you can't go wrong with this offering from Victory."
"This is one I recently picked up at the advise of a local merchant. I'm used to drinking the good old standby Belgian blonde, Blue Moon. This is a nice alternative. A hazy pale gold color. Has a nice scent with hints of straw. A bit of a fruity tast that finishes nicely. Overall a pretty good alternative to Blue Moon. Very drinkable, could easily spend the whole night drinking these alone. Think I may have found myself a new Belgian style standby."
"Thanks to Far333 for what is probably the final installment in my ""summer of witbiers"" - for some reason, I've been spending a lot of time with witbiers and hefeweizens this summer (the hops are getting jealous). Poured a hazy golden, perhaps a little less hazy than most. Some fruity yeast in the nose. A touch bready, with some distant clove notes. An odd finish that I couldn't quite put my finger on - sort of artificial, almost plum, but that's not it. A detraction from an otherwise solid beer."
"A pretty solid witbier. Murky gold color, good carbonation and lace. Fruity wildflower combo on smell and taste. Very nice Belgian-ish complexity. This doesnt seem to sell too well--I have no idea why. For the style, this is almost the ideal example. Unfortunately, its not my favorite style. I think this is worth trying to use in a pancake batter with some morning bloodys."
"The great aroma and taste are enchaced by an excellent mouthfell that's alternately creamy and fizzy, making this a great warm weather brew that's suited equally for savoring and pounding."
"Bit cloudy golden with White head that stays and provides creaminess on palate. some lace. Mild cherry flavour, tad sourness, some wheat taste. Watery mouthfeel. Was moderately fresh and refreshing, but only average in flavour. Pleasant but unexceptional product of the Victory line."
"Overall, not great, but certainly a refreshing summer drinker."
"Pours like the Orangina. Pale orange and fizzy. Nose is wheaty with some surprisingly strong hop tones. Flavor is even more wheat; and sweet at that. Hops take a back seat to some orange and lemon peel. Hints of the alcohol--even at 5% ABV, but not bad at all. However, the flavor also reminds me a little of lime soda. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. This beer is nicely refreshing on a hot summer day."
"The smell is dominated by citrus and yeast. The taste is somewhat plain, being entirely of lemon and light malt, but it still comes out fairly well. The mouthfeel is nice while the drinkability is pretty high."
"Overall = I really enjoyed this one, which might be influenced by the 86 degree heat I'm currently residing in. Thie hit the spot and really satisfied. Definitely recommend this one."
"good, refreshing but beyond one the yeasty taste in my throat might be bothersome. probably not worth going out of the way for but a good beer."
"The beer poured an opaque light yellow with a thin white head. It showed the type of sediment you want in a wit. It was a pretty stright up malt and citrus aroma. The flavor also had plenty of malt and citrus in it, but also was tart and had a melon quality. It is light bodied with a dry crisp hop finish. It was a very good beer, and quite comprable to Belgians. This is one I will have to sample again when it is in production."
"The drinkability is less than great becuase the total package is not very desirable in my opinion. Best Before August 29th. Good thing I got to it in time or else it may have been ugly."
"Poured a cloudy pale straw color. At middle of pour I poured straight in, as I was getting no head. And never did. Just small lacing around edges. Didn't have much smell, maybe some grassy citurs? Clove? Not sure. Tasted very tangy, and peppery. I expected more citrus and spice. Mouthfeel was light and fresh, but still tart and tangy. Didn't like that tang much. For the style, I've had better. I'm no beer judge, but it didn't seem as good as other witbiers I've had. I'll still drink it, but not one of my top choices."
"WTF did they do to this beer? This is the first time I tried it since they put in the new brewhouse and I'm not impressed. This used to be a wonderfully drinkable beer with orange and subtle spice flavors that made it quite refreshing. Now its just overloaded with phenolics and all you can taste and smell is cloves. I can't get past the phenolic flavors enough to even finish a bottle. Just horrible. Hopefully this is just temporary and they can get it back to where it used to be."
"This one is another winner from the Victory line, definitely worth a try if you like the yeast."
"Tastes of sweet wheat malt, spicy and lemony. Light banana. Mouth is lightly sticky and yet crisp in the finish. Not bad but somehow it's a bit thin and the flavors just don't quite mesh. A decent enough summer beer though."
"This one was perfect for tonight, right after mowing the lawn in pretty hot temperatures. Pours an average pint, okay carbonation and thin lacing, typical cloudy appearance. Excellent smell of banana and clove, great taste to match. Very easy to finish off and would be a great session beer for the evening if i had more than the one single I purchased. Will definitely look for a six pack next time."
"Drinkability is good could have many of these at one sitting not that I would really want to though."
"Needless to say, I was not very impressed with this beer. In fact, I found it to be rather offensive. I'm not a huge fan of witbiers, but every one I've had has been better than this. Fizzy white head that dies after a few seconds, even with a strong pour. No lacing. Clear golden color. Coriander and cloves in the nose..can't really pick up anything else. As far as taste goes..in my opinion, the coriander and spices are way overdone, but then again, that's my personal taste. Nothing stood out for me and I didn't find any aspect of the beer particularly exciting. I feel bad giving such a great brewery a bad review...it's hard for me to believe Hopdevil is related to this brew."
"Mouthfeel is thin but harsh due to its sharp spiciness, and the carbonation at the back of the throat is a bit strong. This beer has its place on a hot day with light fare, so make sure you have a few on hand for this summer. While not ""big"" enough to pair with burgers or sausage, try this with grilled peppers or a raw vegetable platter."
"Body is light and spritzy with an almost watery mouthfeel and very little aftertaste. Extremely thirst quenching and perfectly suitable for a 93 degree, Charlotte afternoon.."
"Whirlwind started off a little bit suspect. The head was a little short, and its body looked too clear. The outlook improved quickly. The aroma was fantastic, full of fresh citrus. The taste was very good. Citrus dominates on the tongue at first, but the spice carries the finish. Whirlwind is a worthwhile wit. (sorry)"
"Drinkability: Are you kidding? This is one of the best wheat brews I've ever sampled. Excellent taste and a smooth, well rounded profile, all around. This is one to stock up on for the summer. Very highly recommended!"
"It poured with a large, white head above a cloudy, straw-blonde liquid. The color was somewhat unusual for a wit, putting me in mind of something else not worth mentioning. The nose was a very pleasant mix of orange, lemon, and black pepper. It had a good, thick mouthfeel with a nice tanginess on the tongue. The finish was definitely one of pepper."
"Victory is one of my favorite breweries; a lot of their beers are world class. When they decide to get serious about Belgians, this one will be too."
"suprisingly light in appearance and pours with a nice head that dissapates quickly. not much in the lacing department. tastes like lemon pepper, and smells plummy. makes my tounge tingle, so it has ample carbonation. decent attempt at the style but kind of a let down from victory. good beer to knock back on a hot day."
"Vert refreshing . Spicy flavor that is not overwhelming. I would recommend as a good summer beer. The appearance and smell are above average. There is no bad after taste here!! I'm having one now,and really enjoying it!! Though on the light side, worth a try."
"This is a nice thirst quenching brew overall that's quite flavourful as well. If it wasn't for the lackluster appearance of thebrew, it'd score much higher if you're looking stricly at numbers. Ignore the appearance factor and grab this one and enjoy."
"This had to be a bad batch, If someone at Victory is reading this, please tell me some young brewdude screwed up a batch. You couldn't possibly have released this intentionally. I tried 2 bottles, and this is one of the worst tasting beers I have tried yet. Anyone want 4 Whirlywinds?"
"One of my favorite US produced Witbiers. Pours a murky yellow with nice fluffy head. Aroma is yeasty, spicy, like a Witbier should be. Taste... crisp, refreshing, slight orange and corriander notes with a nice spiciness in the finish. Great on a hot day or to cleanse your pallete. Immensely drinkable."
"This would be nice on a hot summer day, very drinkable, just not overly complicated."
"pours a well carbonated light yellow body with a nice frothy head. Classic lemon smell and a sence of freshness. and a bit of a belgian pale ale. taste i find to be a blend of a wit beer and an american hefe. decent lemon tones dominate the flavor, a little orange essence, enough hops to balance everything out and a hint of spice on the finish. very refreshing, clean finish. one of my new favorite summer beers, in a tie with harpoon UFO and allagash white. mouthfeel is watery and refreshing, desired for the style. as for this beer i find it more drinkable than the UFO and Allagash because of it's lighter body is just more crisp and refreshing. although sometimes i sence the body is too thin, reminding me of a light maco beer."
"very refreshing on a hot summer day. Score one for Victory again"
"Cloudy pale yellow in the glass with minimal head. Nice smell with lots of odors mixing but not clashing - citrus, wheat, spice. Taste the same as smell but by the end the spice becomes the main flavor. Very thin mouthfeel and smooth finish. At first this was tasting very refreshing and i was really enjoying it. Toward the end of the glass it just didn't have the zip that it had early on and kind of finished with a little dissapointment. I would certainly drink again but i'm not sure what happened about 1/2 way through. If i would have rated a 6 oz sample taste and drinkability would have been 1/2 points higher."
"A staple 'round these parts during the warmer months."
"Appearance is pale yellow, almost white like hoegaarden, cloudy and with a thin, whispy white head that dissapates quickly. Smell is classic wit: cloves, corriander and orange peel maybe...fairly fruity with a hint of bananna also. Taste is a little tangy for a wit (pretty similar to just a regular hefe) with a big fruit component and a milder spice flavor. Alot of bannana and citrus fruit with a clove and corriander spiced background. Pretty good wit, especially from a non-belgian style brewery."
"Finger licking good!"
"Pours a hazy, golden color with a short-lived frothy white head. Great yeasty, fruity nose. Refreshing taste; very citrusy, with again a strong yeast flavor. This is a very well done example of a Belgian witbier. Mouthfeel is a little thick, but in no way heavy. I could picture downing quite a few of these on one of the hot, sticky Northeastern summer days that are headed our way in the next month or two."
"A nice spring/summer wit with good flavor. Probably my least favorite Victory offering so far; which is saying a lot since this is a pretty good version of the style."
"2005 edition purchased at the brewery. Poured a hazy amber color with moderate white head. The smell is absolutely fantastic, a mixture of cloves and spices that won't quit. The taste follows though and is absolutely fantastic. Leaves an thorougly enjoyable taste in the mouth. A superb drinkable beer. I've waited since last fall to have this beer again and I wasn't disappointed."
"Drinkability and Overall: This a wonderfully refreshing summer beer. Damn near perfect for the upcoming warmth, and I'm sure I'll be enjoying many of these throughout the season. If you enjoy this, I'd say give Allagash's White a try as well. Go Victory."
"Drinkability- May have to do this one again to see if it's the same and I got a bottle that was past it's prime. Otherwise, considering, it was a pretty good wit."
"Not the best mouthfeel and not very drinkable."
"Sampled on 6/11/04"
"Wheat malt tang up front. Medium-body, good carbonation; solid protein-chewy feel. Coriander and orange slide in as expected. Finish is wheat bitter and yeasty, just like a good witbier should be. Refreshing, thirst-quenching, and great to have around in hot weather. Another victory for this brewery. Haha."
"Appearance is a glowing, slightly dark gold color, with just a little ring of head around the inside of the glass. Smell is of orange and coriander, just like the label says. Almost has the scent of mulled applecider. Taste is also very well spiced, like something you'd find released in the fall (which is when i am drinking this, so it kind of works out). Mouthfeel and drinkability are bothe very good, nothing cloyying or offensive at all. Another solid victory beer."
"Pours a dark yellow/golden color with a small head that dies off quickly. The aroma is strong with corriander/orange and has a little spiciness as well. Grainy flavor and a little thin. Little sweet maltiness. Some lemon and orange citrus. Although this is a decent beer, I think this beer could have been a lot better."
"I picked this one up on my reck through central IL last weekend. This beer pours a pale, hazy golden color, with a finger of head that falls to nothing. The nose has a blast of coriander citrus in there with a bit of lemony zest. The flavor is okay, with an orange and lemony citrus twist, but its overall a little thin. The mouthfeel is just a hint thin for me as well, but with an okay creamyness in there as well. Drinkability is just okay. Nothing special about it. I would take another crack at it, but only another bottle."
"Mouthfeel is good, it rolls over the tounge nicely. The drinkability on this one is pretty good too...I think I might tire of style after awhile...but a few would be nice. It's a nice lighter brew that will give your palate a workout. Overall, I'd say this is a quality witbier from Victory and it's worth it to hunt this one down."
"Victory Whirlwind Wit was served from a 12 oz bottle. In a pint glass, the beer was a lightly hazy, pale honey golden color, and was topped by a short-lived white head. The nose presented nicely herbal, oregano-like maltiness, coriander, bitter orange, and a pleasant pungent-spicy hoppiness. On the palate, a light coriander-spicy pale maltiness released a nice and zippy lemony-citric zesty aspect before entering a lighly bitter weak finish. The body had a nice fullness for the flavors of the beer, and the carbonation was appropriate. Whirlwind is a nicely done example of the style."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" white head over the bright (almost glowingly) yellow brew. Head disappears relatively quickly, with ok lacing. Aroma is nicely wheaty, as expected. Taste is upfront wheat grains, and then as that fades, some citrus notes make their presence known. Mouthfeel is thin, more so than I would expect for the style, but have to give it props for being smooth going down. Drinkability is good, and although this is not a beer I personally would go out of my way for again, it is an acceptable brew for the style."
"Thanks goes out to Bighuge for the hook-up."
"A Whirlwind Cheers to BigHuge for this sample!"
"The first pour was slightly hazy, by the last pour the beer looked like a murky and golden bog. Light and straw yellow in color. Thin but creamy head topped the beer off. The aroma is yeasty and sour with a light graininess. Theres hints of sour apples. The taste is lightly sweet, light in body, flavorful and refreshing. Has some cider-like qualities. This is a very nice beer. Effervescent and clean, void of anything harsh. Easily enjoyable."
"Bottle: Poured an off-white colored beer with a small head with minimum retention. Seems to lack carbonation. Aroma is quite nice with a mix of sweetness coming from the malt and from what seems like fruit. Taste is a bit too sweet for my liking (or for what I usually expect from witbier  maybe too much cascade?) but still a nice mix with the spice. Overall, this is a very good drink with maybe a bit too sweet."
"Very drinkable beer."
"Largely clear, golden in hue, I can see each individual yeast particle suspended in this Wit. The head was white in color and modest in size, at its height the head managed to be about a half finer in height. Retention was fair as is it faded away in a moment, a soapy collar was all that remained. Subsequent lacing was minimal, spotty, and it didnt cling well. The appearance is basically what is to be expected, albeit a bit dull. The nose is bright, plenty lively with a funky yeasty twang; plus aromas of citrus, mildly spicy, and peaches. Wheat. Simplistic. There is a good amount of potency to get the few individual aromas across. I like the nose. It is inviting. The palate is as bright as the nose indicated. There is a good amount of flash, spicy, cloves, coriander, and musty yeast flavors. Citrus flavors like lemon notes too. Mild acidity. The foundation is a solid amount of wheat. Like the nose, the palate is simplistic, even for a Wit. This is a good summertime beer. Refreshing. Spicy aftertaste. There is something about it that is decisively American, maybe because the spicing reminds me of, get this, Blue Moon! Im serious. Nor am I complaining. In Whirlwind the wheat/malt backbone really steals the show. Medium in body, moderate carbonation that is lively and playful, overall the mouthfeel is pleasant. I found this to be very drinkable. I bought a six-pack in Burnsville, MN and I waited to my last bottle to review it. This is a solid beer from the folks at Victory. Try one."
"Pours a medium-sized head that dissipates quickly. Hazy yellow color. Slight lacing. Banana and citrus aroma. Sweet citrus flavor. Reminiscent of Celis White and Hoegaarden White, but even fresher and better. Starts to lose its flavor after three weeks."
"Murky light auric hue. Ample, seemingly pillowy soft porcelain white head. Frothy, sparse lace remains. Musty sourdough and citrus peel hints upfront in aroma. Secondary are rounded, ripe banana esters and judicious, herbally sweet coriander. Clean and welcoming aromawise. The flavor profile exhibits a fine balance of citric acidity and grainy, bready wheat sweetness. Spicing is agreeably understated, with coriander melding seemlessly with the static clove phenol undertone. Orange peel provides more pithy bitterness rather than flavor, and serves to offset residual sweetness lending a quenching near dryness. Lightly bodied overall, but with a lightly viscous, proteinaceous mouthfeel from the wheat and perhaps oats used in the grist. Banana esters augment as the beer warms adding additional depth. Finishes with hints of spiced lemon juice and honeyish malt. A spot on witbier, without a single rough edge or flaw. Superbly drinkable and soft on the palate. Thanks to Bighuge for reuniting me with the Whirlwind."
"Chalice at CAH Innsbrook. One of the better American made Witbiers."
"Very little head, maybe a quarter inch, which quickly faded. Served in a pint glass from a 12oz bottle."
"I think this is an excellent interpretation of this style. This is one drinkable and thirst quenching beer."
"Overall: This is one of the best American-made witbiers on the market - simply flawless in every way. This beer is not only very tasty, but also extremely refreshing and thirst-quenching - a perfect summertime beer."
"on tap, poured a nice cloudy light orangy/yellow. White head. fruity, citrus nose. Medium carbonation and a creamy smooth mouthfeel. Moderatly spiced. Great style for summer quaffing and wictory's attempt was crisp and refreshing on tap. Very enjoyable."
"Not bad, but I've had much better wits ..."
"Color of lemon juice, big fluffy white head emerges quickly and leaves thusly as so, lace drips back quickly into the glass leaving very miniscule spots sticking. Aroma is all wit beer, zippy with lemon and bright orange rind spice, other yeasty spices, coriander, and a beefy wheat sharpness. Taste is more of the same, zippy and fresh with lemon and orange peels and pulp, spicy citrus, wheaty sharpness. Mellows out nicely as it warms. Good feel for a Witbier, kinda fluffy, medium body, soft with a good carbonation zip still presenting itself. Finishes spicy and then floats into wheat textures and touches of citrus. This was very nice to drink once it sat a while, at first out of the fridge and cold, it was almost too much, so let it sit and enjoy it more then."
"Not a bad finish to the BIF 7.0 package, courtesy of Foxman."
"Aahh, this is one of my favorite summer thirst quenchers, and close to one of my favorites of the style; i think definitely the class of the amrican wit style. Pours a beautiful lemon- yellow color with a two inch+ foamy white head. Excellent clarity and glass-lacing. aroma of corriander citrus, lemon, citron, almond essence. Taste is so wonderfully refreshing, crisp lemony with a hint of anise. the memories of ocean surf and walks along the beach on the cape and at the shore linger and linger. Similar to the taste experience that rides though the palate for wholesome satisfaction. Very, very mellow, balanced and refreshing. Wonderfully satisfying happy-style beer. A ""cool"" beer."
"Haven't reviewed a Victory beer in quite a while. This did not disappoint especially on a summer afternoon. Poued a super hazy yellow color with virtually no head. Smelled juicy and ripe like mellon or peach. The taste was pure pineapple taste with a slight tart citrus flavor, but not quite lemon. It was very juicy and full bodied for a witbier. The mouthfeel is perfectly tart and scratchy and full of tiny bubbles. Tastey beer and perfect for the summer."
"Medium bodied"
"ng"
"D&N: Very nice, tasty with a bit of a bite."
"It has a very clean and crisp feel in the mouth and is a pleasure to drink. I just would like a little more to the taste."
"Poured out a cloudy light orange color with some decent carbonation in this brew. Looks a little darker than some other wits on the market now. Smell consisted of some light spiciness, orange and a touch of lemon. Some yeast can be detected as well. Taste was pretty much the same as the nose. Light spice comes through with some orange and yeast blending in. Clove mixes into the action as well. Reminds me a hefe almost. Mouthfeel was nice and smooth and full-bodied. Even if you don't like the style, you have to admit that this is a damn good beer. It has a nice character but it's very controlled in the taste department. Excellent for the spring and summer months."
"Arrived at the table sporting a cloudy pineapple juice color. Thin layer of bright white head soon fades to a edge-only circle. Some lacing of the glass is noted. Aromas are yeasty, spicy, orange zesty, and a bready/doughy note as well. Flavor is like a cross between a mild Belgian ale and a hefeweizen. There's the wheaty flavor from the hefe mixed with the zippy spices of the Belgian. Different, and it comes off well. Crisply-carbonated and slides down the gullet quite easily. Finishes with a clean palate and just a dash of ""wheatness"" on the palate. Superb summer beer for these soon-to-be-arriving hot and humid Richmond summer days."
"I said it before and I'll say it again...it's sassy. The aroma sets a high, lively bar, and the flavor somes in at about the same level. Balanced in its way, and chick-full of tasty tidbits, it pleases the palate and glides down smooth and mellow. It's emminently drinkable if it's what you're looking for, and decently so even if it's not. Whirlwind is aptly named for all the right reasons, and it's one more reason to regard Victory as highly as we do."
"The beer pours a cloudy pale gold color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is good. It has a very fruity yeast scent that enhances the already dry and light wheat aroma. It has a nice banana type smell to it very nice. The taste is good, but not great. It has a nice wheat flavor with that fruity, yet dry wit yeast taste. It goes down easy and is a bit refreshing. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine wit, but I've had better. This isn't the best Victory has to offer."
"This was my first Victory beer and I can definitely say I wasn't disappointed. The beer pours a hazy yellow color out of the bottle and the bottom of the bottle will usually have a good deal of yeast. The smell isn't that exciting but you can note a bit of a citrusy smell as well as a smell of spice. The taste of this beer, at least to me, is very hard to beat. It is a bit sour and full of citrus flavor. It is not a heavy beer and feels great on the tongue with its ample carbonation. As far as drinkability is concerned, this beer is one of the most drinkable you will find. I bought a six-pack a few weeks ago(along with a lot of other beers) and this time that I went back to my old reliable liquor store, I bought myself a whole case of it, something that I rarely do because I usually like to mix it up. Maybe one day I'll get sick of it but I highly doubt it. I can't wait to have these when summer comes along."
"It is rather rich on the first sip. The maltiness offers hints of citrus and apple. Surprisingly, the carbonation becomes more pronounced as the beer warms mid-glass. It actually becomes more refreshing as I drink it. It finishes clean and slightly sweeter."
"It looks like apple juice -- no head to speak of, and a cloudy yellowish pear-like color. There was a small amount of sediment in the bottle. The aroma had a biting spiciness reminiscent of some Belgians. The taste was very smooth and refreshing with almost a clove spice flavor and sweet fruit in the aftertaste. Very little carbonation -- I don't know if that was the result of the age, but it added to the drinkability -- it went down like a fruit juice, which also describes the mouthfeel. This would be great while grilling on a hot afternoon."
"A decent witbier, but not particularly outstanding in any way."
"Tastes oh so nice. Very fruity with a lot of that belgian spiciness I've come to love. Lots of fuit and lemon with a bit of bitter grass. Finishes slightly dry and sweet. Lots of carbonation despite having no head at all. Very drinkable."
"The appearance was golden hazy yellow. I swirled the yeast around about midway through the pour because it was attached to the bottom of the bottle. This made it really hazy. Thick white head that dissipated pretty darn quick, not much lacing left when it was gone. The smell was spicy, perhaps cloves. The taste was spicy as well, again I got a clove taste right away. Some fruitiness in the background, a bit citrus like. Mouthfeel was a bit this for my taste. Too little body for me, but defiantly crisp. Perhaps if it wasn't 6 degrees outside right now I'd appreciate the light body and crispness more. Drinkability was good. As I said, I'm going to drink this again when it warms up and I'm not in winter stout drinking mode. All in all, an excellent Wit though."
"Mmmmm...Victory sure knows how to make a good brew...this offering presented the nice cloudiness assocaited with this type. Smell was nice and citrusy, with a mellow tone. Taste was extremely nice...citrus...wheat...in a beautiful balance. Well rounded in mouthfeel, with a crisp citrus quality that was extremely refreshing...right upn there with Paulaner."
"Poured a hazy golden color with a thin head that receded to the rim. The aroma is very floral, with strongs notes of citrus and spice. This is an extremely crisp and refreshing beer. The coriander and bitterness that is noted by the tongue is followed by a slight sourness after swallowing. The citrus flavor provides a nice balance. The spice lingers on the tongue for quite a bit. Extremely drinkable, as several can be enjoyed without getting bored. One of my favorites in this style."
"This is a wow witbier. Cloudy yellow with tendencies toward something darker, more orange. The head is a little flat, though. There's a good flowery perfume aroma. Soft citrus, light coriander come up front wiht a good dry wheat in the finish. This is a little heftier than the supposed style stalwart, Hoegaarden, but the soft, almost creamy mouthfeel makes this a surprisingly satisfying beer without being heavy. Tasty beer."
"A refreshing thirst-quenching albeit a rather plain Wit. Nothing all that special, but one worth a taste."
"Drinkability: The 6 pack I purchased will not live to see the ""drink by"" date, let me tell you what. I'll definitely give this one a shot the next time it's released. If it's quite good a few weeks shy of possibly being stale, I'd love to see what it would be closer to its release."
"itself. For now though, not impressed."
"This is one of my picks of the summer brews. It pours rather cloudy, and it very pale straw in color. Very slight head. The citrus taste is very clearly present. The fragrance is also rather citrus-like with somewhat of a yeasty nose as well. There is a somewhat tart spicyness to it, and for some reason I think of grapefruit as I drink it. There was noticable sediment in the bottom (which I do pour in my glass and welcome it!) This beer is a bit thin in the mouthfeel, but while that may not be a strong point, it does make it a very easy drinking summer brew."
"This witbier poured a hazy, yellow color with creamy, very white foam that dissipated rapidly and left no lace. The smell was dominated by citrus (lemon) with a very mild banana/clove aroma and a very faint hint of bubblegum esters. The taste was fairly sour, with the citrus flavor strong but with wheat and some hints of spices (coriander), and very low hop presence. The mouthfeel was tart and lemony with medium-light body and low carbonation feel. The aftertaste was tangy and spicy. This was a light and refreshing beer, but a bit sour and a bit thin."
"Cloudy peach with a bubbly, white head. Sparse notes of lace remain, while active carbonation is present. Nose is appealing with the obvious notes of yeast, coriander, and freshly peeled orange rind. Flavors of citrus, yeast, and coriander all come in to play as expected, yet the spiciness is well done. Finish is a bit thin and vaguely acidic. Mouthfeel is soft and lightly carbonated. This wit is extremely refreshing and drinkable. An excellent summertime offering from Victory, I wish I had more than one bottle."
"Overall it's just nice very drinkable Wit. Really a perfect middle of the road easy drinking beer. Much more on target with aiming at belgians than the Golden Monkey."
" I have a soft spot for the good people of Victory. As such, I will order this over imports more times than not. I think this brew is solid and can stand proud next to the others in the Victory Line-up."
"All I can say is ""eh"". In some ways this was a major disappointment. All of the other Victory brews I've tried have been spectacular. This was simply average. However, average for Victory is pretty good. Cloudy appearance. Poured a foamy head that disippated. Yeasty, peppery aroma. Lemony, spicy flavory, but not that strong. Light, brisk mouthfeel. A good Summertime brew, there are better Witbiers out there."
"Whirlwind is pretty windy, alright. In fact, if you stood in a wheat field and opened your mouth, it'd be a dead ringer. I don't know what else to say... it's good, but it doesn't quite run with the rest of the Victory family."
"A nice beer I just find it a little dry for my taste. Poured with a nice fluffy white head and color was a hazy yellow. The smell is of dry wheat and earthiness with a hint of pepper and zest. Tasted initially like a hefe with the addition spices but was much to dry to the mouth. While the foreshadowing spice flavor is dry I wish there was tad bit more sweet malt flavor to this brew but not cloyingly sweet. Although not bad by any means could be much better."
"This isn't as amazing as many of the beers from Victory, but it has character and is a nice refresher for a hot summer night like this one."
"Very bubbly, carbonated and thin bodied Wit with a soft fading head. The aroma is very citrusy with coriander and orange peel. Taste is bubbly almost like champagne or more like a mimosa. It's an OK interpretation of the style, but there are better ones out there. There just doesn't seem to be oomph that most Victory beers have and this is one that is at almost all beer festivals.. thirst quenching yes.. highly drinkable so-so. Better on tap."
"Thanks to francisweizen for this one. It pours a cloudy color with a 1/2 inch white head. The nose is clean and crisp. It is somewhat citrus-like. The flavor has the slight sourness that I'd expect in a Wit beer, but with the crispness that seals the deal."
"I thought I'd give this one a try after I noticed one of the local HB clubs had a clone contest for it. I figured it had to be special. The interesting thing about this wit is the spice kick. Can you say pepper? What a wonderful surprise to taste a sharp twang of pepper in a wit. While I am not sure they use pepper precisely, it is nice to see someone breaking away from the style barriers a bit to offer our palates something different from this great style. It had a steady citrus aroma coupled with a cloudy appearance. Overall this is a beer I will take a drive to find."
"This beer poured a beautiful straw yellow color with a small sticky white head. The sediment is not visible whatsoever. The smell is full of banana and I thought i caught some black pepper in the background. The taste is very smooth and easy drinking, kind of sweet and surpisingly strong with banana, and a crisp finish that left me smacking my lips. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. I could drink these all summer if they weren't so expensive. One of my favorite wits along, right behind Hoegaarden."
"Very good after a long day of work, I could polish off a case given the chance, mild and very recomended, enjoy"
"Had a pint of this on tap at a local bar and must say I was very pleased with it. I had bought a case of Whirlwind bottles in May, and found them to be satisfactory, but having a freshly pulled pint was much better. The beer pours a deep golden color, with a very thin fluffy white head. Seems to have less haze/ clouds than other witbiers, but definitely unfiltered. Spice is present, but not oeverwhelming. I tasted good floral notes, and a prescence of orange, complexed by some spice. I assume it to be the typical corriander/clove mix, but it felt restrained somehow. Some sweetness, perhaps vanilla also. Because of the complexity, I found it to be incredibly drinkable, and very refreshing. A nice switch from say hoegaarden, if only for its unique spice character. A great summer beer."
"I had this on tap at Victory. It is a fine, cloudy yellow-golden color in the glass. Decent white, fluffy head. There is a somewhat spicy aroma. The corriander comes through. Many flavors come to the taste buds. It is very rich and full. An excellent example of the style. Not quite up to Hoegaarden or the Allagash, but still superb!"
"Though I am big fan of Victory, I think Great Lakes Brewing Co's Summer Seasonal, ""Holy Moses"" set such a precedent for Belgian style wheat beers, for my taste buds anyhow, that while I couldn't wait to try these guys witbier, I was not super crazy about the interpretation. To me the beer seemed to lean way too heavy on the ORANGE! I mean, that's the main thing I tasted here-like orange juice was added. I think I prefer a drier, more subtle example such as Gray's witbier or, of course, Holy Moses. I bet this would be spectacular however, with an order of teryaki sea bass!! Decent beer, but not my personal style."
"The beer is a very, very light yellow - almost white. There's no head to speak of. Smells fantastic. Spicy and lemon scented, like a good white. Tastes chewy. A very nice wit.. clean, of course. Not too complex, but simple and too the point. Very enjoyable and drinkable."
"Pours with a hazy golden color with a flufyf white head. The aroma is very citrusy with coriander. Taste is spicy and lemony. Overall it's good for the style, but there are better ones out there. There just doesn't seem to be the abundant amount of flavor that's in most of Victory's beers."
"Came across as a thin mouthfeel but actually had some good wheat firmness to it. This is beautiful served cold from a keg. Avoid bottles unless they're super fresh."
"Appears a golden hazy hue with a vibrant white head not as pale of golden as a Hoegaarden, but this is a fairly authentic Belgian style wit using a Belgian yeast. The head doesn't billow as thickly as I was anticipating, but I am still impressed with the vibrant white head with fairly large bubbles. Aroma is very lucious with spices and cloves flowing through it, and the characteristic sharp sweetness from the malted wheat complement eachother very well lightly hopped to produce a favorable representation of the witbier. Taste is slightly acidic good carbonation cause the tingling mouthfeel from this lighter bodied beer, but the first thing that comes through is a rush of bitter sweetness balance with a faint trace of the yeast characteristics of citrus, cloves, and other spices in there. Very nice drinkable summer beer for any wheat beer lover like myself, yes I could drink quite a few of these. I still prefer Holy Moses, Allagash White, Hoegaarden, and Wittekerke over this, but it's still a great representation of a classic style by an amazing brewery like Victory."
"Victory has made a fairly good witbier, and a good transition from people who had previously only had Blue Moon."
"A hazy, lemon-gold beer served with a fluffy white head. Head shows good retention and lacing. The aroma is a crisp coriander and wheat malt note, a touch of sweetness, and then nice cloves. The taste is a strong lemon, malt, and clove taste, reminiscent of Hoegaarden but taken to the next level. It is sweet and crisp, but then is slightly puckering on the finish. The mouthfeel is exceptionally creamy and feels like a much stronger, malty beer, but still refreshes. This beer is delicious and well balanced, making it a great summer refresher/session beer. Actually, the mouthfeel would take it well into the fall months. I've had this on tap and in bottles before, but I don't remember it being this good!"
"The taste was not all that nice either. It had a fairly strong citrus taste, but not a traditional wit beer taste. The yeast taste was absent. The beer was OK, easy to drink and refreshing, but I’ve had lots and lots better wheat beers."
"Decent wit, but I'd take Allagash's White over this any day."
"Overall a fine example of a Witbier. Pleanty of refreshing sensations for your tastebuds. If I could change anything it would be a wee bit more malt flavor up-front and a little less carbonation in the beginning of the taste profile. Come those dog days of August this is going to be a beer of choice."
"Poured a nice deep/hazy yellow color with real nice big rocky head.Aroma of lemon zest is most prevelant with some subtle spiciness,taste was spicey and a little smokey with a good lingering tartness to finish it off.A real nice wheat beer that is real easy to drink,well done Belgian style here."
"Pretty inviting spicy, zesty nose with hints of orange peel and lemon...taste is sourish...lemonlike...the sourness retreats the deeper in you go and a subtle spicy yeast flavor emerges....Apperance is cloudy yellow, with a bunch of sperm like chinks of yeast floating throughout the glass....mouthfeel is dry...and drinkability would rate average at best...I've had better Whits.."
"An inviting and intriguing aroma eminates from a hazy golden body with orange cloudy hues. A thick frothy head floats on top. Scent is lemony, bready, citrusy, a full of notes of mellowed malts. Taste is much the same with a combination of bread and sweetened lemon-like flavor in the forefront. Complex, light, and pleasing to the mouth this is a beer you could throw back all day on the couch or in the sun, shade, or bar."
"Drinkability: This is a good example of a wit. It's by no means a great one, nor a bad one. It's just...good. Not the best American version, but still quite tasty. I could drink this anytime..."
"This is a very pleasant beer. Complicated and yet refreshing."

"Pours a hazy yellow with a white head that dissipates to a few little mounds of foam. The aroma of spices, especially coriander, is detected right away and then fades a bit. A bit of yeastiness is also dectected. A crisp tasting witbier that is medium bodied and moderately spiced. Finishes nice and dry. I'd say this is an example that is pretty true to style. A cute label that depicts a cartoonish wisp of foam that almost makes you think this should be a winter beer. Worth seeking out."
"Cloudy hazy light pale golden color, spicy, earthy citrus aromas, nice white frothy head that sticks to the sides of my glass. Fresh wheat and mild spice flavors, crisp carbonated mouthfeel, finishes clean and dry, great for the style, very refreshing."
"Pour is a cloudy yellow/peachy color, slowly diminishing large white head which leaves nice lacing. Aroma is sour, lemony, yeasty, some orange. Flavor has the sourness, lemon, orange, some apple pokes through towards the middle and end. Body is medium, a decent example of the style."
"pours a cloudy golden with a bright white fluffy head. the aroma is yeasty and spot on for a wit. taste: citrusy (not in a hoppy way) spicy and a bit medicinal. the sweetness of the citrus is abruptly chopped off with the spicyness. a solid example of the style, which is admitedly not my favorite. A good summer brew."
"($1.34 / 12 oz.)"
"Having never been a fan of wheat beers, but having always been a fan of Victory beers, I figured that if I was going to learn to appreciate this style, then this brewer would be the one to show me how. Although I am still not enlightened as to the delights of wheat beers, I have to say that Victory seems to have nailed this style. The color was a deep golden yellow, with cloudiness that prevents seeing through the glass. The head is bright white and lingers for a little while. The aroma is strong, reminiscent of a belgian ale. The flavor attacks the senses immediately, and delivers that big round taste that envelops the tongue. There are hints of citrus and pine, no hop to speak of. It's a big flavor, just not one that I can gravitate toward. Victory seems to have done a masterful job with this style, but I can't seem to get through the entire glass."
"Drinkability: Doesn't stack up to the other wheats out there, or the other beers produced by Victory. I had come to expect more from them, and was let down by this offering."
"Hazy yellow ochre color with a head that's as big as a Golden Monkey. Laces in flat sheets. Yeasty aroma, some notes of estery lemon and allspice. Pretty thick and carbonated mouthfeel , makes the swallow unsettling to me. There are some fruity flavors mid mouth, peach predominantly, but rather than a clean finish, there is a flattening -- despite the carbonation. OK, not a favorite in an already not-very favorite style for me."
"The beer pours a somewhat chill hazed golden yellow with an imposing white head, creamy in its consistency and the left over lace nice clinging sheets. As I noticed the dross clinging to the bottom, I was able to decoct the beer, allowing the yeast and other goodies to cap the head. Bread dough, lemon lime crisp and sweet nose that is very pleasant. Sweet malt start, the top a bit light, but the pertinence of the hops and the stinging acidic and tart finish make up for the lightness. Dry and long lasting aftertaste seals this most pleasing to the palate beer, and how lucky you East Coast BAers are to have this readily available."
"Big, beautiful head, white as driven snow, lemony color. And there's the aroma, right away, all those fresh and delightful notes we love in a witbier-the lemon, the orange, the spice.Light, but substantial texture. So fresh! Alc. content not given, and not detected. Hoppy as all get-out! The ultimate summer beer, and a note-perfect interpretation."
"Yellow-orange in color and clouded by yeast, with a big head of white foam that vanished within minutes. No lace at all which is unusual for this style. Aroma of lemon and clove with some musty yeast. The flavor was very wheaty with a citrus character that seemed more sour than bittersweet and fruity. Zippy carbonation on the tongue and a very quick clean finish. An okay wit, but there are better ones out there."
"Bottle is several months old... just lightly hazy even with a yeast swirl. The body is yellow with a peach cast, topped by a densely foamy white head that holds well as it's buoyed by a solid carbonation (probably because of the age of the bottle). The aroma is lightly tart, mildly spicy, brightly lemony and lightly yeasty. The body is light/medium with a very fine and effervescent carbonation that leaves a spritzy tingle on the tongue. The flavor is lightly sweet with a soft citrusy fruitiness (even some dark fruitiness... light cherry?) and gentle clovey spiciness. It finishes short and clean with just a mild lingering sweet citrus note. Incredibly refreshing and enjoyable. Flavorful but mellow with the yeast characteristics dominating over the spiciness. Very nicely done."
"Sorry, not my kind of brew....the lemmony taste is interesting but the cloudiness of this product is not appealing. Lingering after taste, almost bitter sweet leaves me wanting something else to cut the taste. Medium body with ample carbonation."
"This is a good example of the style.  It pours the color of lemonade and looks more refreshing.  It has an average head, and the smell is of citrus, a little spice.  The taste is really great and refreshing.  The beer did seem to be more carbonated? Foamy?  The bubbles were shooting up the sides of my pint.  Drinkable, refreshing, crisp.  This style and this beer specifically are perfect for warm weekend afternoons."
"Pours with a nice head that dissipates rapidly.  Aroma is slightly sour at first, then the spices start to come through as it warms up a bit.  Color is pale yellow, fairly clear vs opaque. The spices really come through in the flavor as the beer warms up a bit.  All in all, a pretty tasty brew, and very refreshing on a summer day."
"Pours with a healthy, fluffy snow-white head over cloudy white/yellow beer. Nose is lightly lemony, with a good dose of spiciness & yeast fruitiness...very appetizing. Taste is light and crisp, with elements of spice, fruit, clean tasting malts and just barely there hop bitterness. Finishes clean, light and delicious, one bottle is not enough! A very good interpretation from the Victory boys."
"Thanks for the hospitality, Bighuge!"
"A decent attempt at the style, there is better out there and even the mass produced beers of this style are just as good if not better. Still worth a try."
"A decent white from a US brewer but not quite refined to be the velvety pleasure that some wits can be, and not bizarre enough to be the confounding nirvana that is Hitachino Nest, a strange but awesome Japanese interpretation of the style which you should definitely check out. While this Whirlwind is solid, it doesn't live up to Victory's other, better brews. On its own terms, it's a bit soapy, with some good spices, but the Belgian yeast overshadows everything -- it's off balance and a little unpleasant. As a scholarly exercise, it's a successful American interpretation of a tricky Belgian style, but as a beer-drinking experience it's merely so-so."
"The beer's a hazy glowing yellow color.  Particles are in suspension.  Very nice nose.  Nice wheat malt aroma with spices like cinamon, nutmeg and corriander mixed in.  The taste is excellent.  I am starting to enjoy good wits more and more.  Great wheat base.  A little bit of a Belgian-like tanginess.  Refreshing.  Spiced to perfection.  Very good Wit."
"pours yellow and a bit cloudy. this is a white beer with a kick. i did not have this with lemon to tone it down, and it was just not for me. i am not a huge white beer fan, but the hacker-pschorr was much better"
"Most weiss beers I have had are very similar, but this one tasted very unique. Looks like the others, cloudy and straw colored, but this one bit me. It had a yeasty spiciness that at first I didnt quite expect, but as it warmed and I had a few more sips it tasted quite good. A unique interpretation and definitely worth trying if you like these kind of beers."

"Pale yellow body with slight carbonation. Hazy, unfiltered. White head of rapidly popping bubbles. Lemons and spice in the nose. Maybe some orange peel. Taste is very refreshing and light.  Enough body that it is not beer flavored water. Spices enhance but do not dominate. Not a style I've had much experience with, but I think this is one of the top summer quenchers available. Victory continues to show it is one of the great breweries."
"This witbier from Victory is not the best I have had, but it isn't too bad.  The aroma and inital taste are a little more hoppy than any other wits I have experienced.  Color is nice golden, head is fluffy white and mottled.  Kind of sloppy finish."
"pale orange color with much cloudyness.  fruity nose.  White head and lace.  Sparklely feel with citrus yeast notes. Excellent summer beer.  A keg of this will be on order for my brothers pre-wedding event the last weekend of june. Quality ..mmmm"
"A solid representation of the Belgian wit style. Victory is one of the top US breweries and this is another excellent brew from Downingtown."
"Notes: $8.99 a 6-pak in Massachusetts, and worth every damn penny. Whirlwind Witbier could hands-down become one of my favourite ""gotta quench my monster thirst"" beers. A prime example of a Belgian-style Witbier in all respects."
