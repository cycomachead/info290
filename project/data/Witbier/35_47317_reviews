"I don't understand the reviews that saw this is super sweet, I don't taste it. Really strong white and very good"

"10.3% ABV and does not hide it.  This doesn't mean it's a bad beer, in fact it's one of my favorite Sam Adams offerings.  If you want a beer that has a great taste and punches you in the face with its ABV, you have to try this.  Regardless it is worth trying at least once."
"Sickeningly sweet. This tastes as if you took one of those gummy orange slice candies, then melted it, mixed it with orange triplesec, carbonated it and put it in a fancy overpriced beer bottle. If you like candy and oranges and lots of alcohol and sugar, then you'll like this."

"This is beer too sweet for me,  however,  it may be wonderful with sauerkraut and sausage and pork."

"IMHO... This beer is very out of balance. Way to much sweetness that is not offset by the hop additions. Mouthfeel is chewy and luxurious. Smell was all alcohol and cloying sweetness. Taste was just like the smell to much of both alcohol and malt. Apperance was nice. About a finger of head and good lace on the glass. Overall the overpowering sweetness in both the smell and taste was just too much."

"Samuel Adams Imperial White - 10.3% ABV. Mead like. Heavy on the honey and wheat. Bold crisp alcohol note. Pungent fruit (plums and apples) and coriander notes. Admittedly not my forte' but it does invoke that throwback Medieval style robust fruit and wheat beer. Very strong. Bold. Thick. Pretty good. 3.5 out of 5."

"An Absolutely amazing Imperial! So sad its be discontinued, but luckily I bought out the store for years to come. This beer is great off the shelf, and astonishing in taste years later. I have four year old bottles I open for very special occasions and the taste is similar to a fine port wine. in about 10 years when my stock is empty I will be upset with Sam Adams for their mistakable choice of discontinuing it."

""
"Sweet, enjoyable, repeatable ."
""

"O: This one doesn't work for me. It tastes a lot like the gose from Sam Adams I just reviewed. I hope all four beers from the sampler pack don't taste like a variance from the same base recipe. Anyway, it just tastes like stale old beer that was stored improperly. The alcohol and the sweetness is so big that it makes it hard to drink. Tastes a bit better as it warms up, but still meh."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/1/2013. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy golden orange color with a 2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, wheat, bread, honey, caramel, coriander, clove, pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester notes; with decent strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, honey, wheat, bread, caramel, coriander, clove, pepper, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon/orange zest, pear, apple, honey, caramel, wheat, bread, coriander, herbal, light clove, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance, robustness, and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very slick and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good imperial witbier. Good balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Overall this one is fairly drinkable and full of complexity. Overall this is not one of my personal favorites or styles. But it is quite well crafted. I would highly recommend it."
"This really has turned into more of a Belgium Dubbel with the candi presence, dried pitted fruit as well. I bought this due to the fact I got whacked off one bottle which I believed to be a great pre-flight craft. Fresh this was too perfumy and a lot of exentuated wheated present ie bananas and clove. This has aged in a way I had not imagined. One of the highest caloric intake brews and not sure I would ever waste any more time with this-don't feel like running extra miles over this."
""
""
""
""
"Honestly I tried this because of a friend. After drinking it with all my buddies I made the statement ""It tastes like a stronger version of Boston Lager"". After saying it all my friend tried it again and came to the very same conclusion. However thats just me. Tryi it for yourself."

"*I do, in full disclosure, tend to favor the witbier style, making my opinion slightly bias in favor of this Imperial White."

"An interesting citrus and spice witbier. Thicker and heavier than expected. A solid effort."

"All in all: a 3x boozier, 3x sweeter ,(and 3x more flavorful), SA Summer Ale."

"Imperial White pours a darker amber color with a small but long lasting lacing head. There is a sour and malty aroma, with hints of plums. The taste has a lot of plums, and a mellow yeasty taste, lots of spices and Belgian candies. Boozy and warm flavors finish the taste. Full flavors, and drinkable if you sip. Overall a very boozy and spicy witbeir that has no creamy wheat flavors."

""
"Aroma is sweet and ""rummy"". Pours a rich amber brown and hazy body with large beige head. Head reduces quickly to an oily film that spots the glass. Taste is thick coriander spice and a rum like booziness. Warming, not a good choice for a summer drink but could be enjoyable on a crisp fall evening! More like Wheatwine than Witbier."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is handsome solid amber with a large cap of receding foam. The aroma has notes of classic wheat with coriander and just a hint of booze. Chewy on the palate, fruity, and too-boozy--almost vinous. The spice is there at the end, but not enough."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Because of the thick body, malty/fruity taste, and conspicuous alcohol, this one drinks like a barleywine. Not your typical wit, but a tasty brew nonetheless."
""
"Overall - Had potential, but ultimately it's a bit of a boozy, sticky mess. Nothing I'd buy again. In terms of how it drinks, it's probably much closer to Belgian Dubbel than what I would imagine an ""Imperial Wit' to be."

"O - A very unique beer. This beer is not outstanding, but it's very good. One of the more unique beers I've ever sampled in that yes, it's obviously a wheat beer, but has many characteristics not usually (or ever, in my experience) noticed in a witbier. A very good but not outstanding beer that I'd recommend it for any extreme beer fans."

"From a 12 ounce bottle, this beer is a rich amber color, not exactly witbier in color. It does have some haze, and a brilliant white head. The aroma is enchanting...loads of spice (coriander, pepper) and a caramel, toffee, candy like background. Some candied-fruit is present in the aroma as well, along with yeast, banana, and a hint of clove. Woody and booze-like. The taste is moderately sweeet, but not at all with the crisp, tart-like qualities of a traditional wit. Interesting and very enveloping. The alcohol shows up in a prominent warmth. Full body. This is a cool weather brew. Nice."
""
"O: I was very surprised with this brew, I'm somewhat skeptical of Sam Adams and picked this up on a whim. Very glad I did, very well put together brew, I would buy this again"

"Poured into a Samuel Adams perfect pint glass. The beer pours slightly hazy copper with a thick, off white head that dissipates slowly. The beer appears to be well carbonated due to the presence of lots of tiny bubbles rising in the beer. Not much lacing is left behind on the side of the glass. I pick up the wheat in the aroma as well as the spice notes. It's not a strong aroma overall, but I can pick up hints of coriander with citrus. Also make no mistake about it. The booze is noticeable in the aroma even when this beer is well chilled. Like in the aroma, the spice notes take a back seat to the malt and the booze. The spices notes are there and I do get the coriander, pepper, and citrus in the flavor. The sweetness is almost like honey in many ways. The body is full with enough carbonation to make this beer clean on the finish. The alcohol provides a nice warming feel. This is a good beer for what it is, but I wouldn't necessarily classify this as a witbier. It doesn't quite reach the levels of quality of an excellent wheatwine, which is how I'm judging this beer."

"Samuel Adams Imperial White ---4/5."
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Slight head, but no real lacing. Nose is full of character with some fruity and indistinct sweet notes. Bready flavor with lots o' balancing components.... fruit, honey, spice, and citrus. Overall, this is a good quaff."
"Overall this was just not my thing. I was excited at the prospect of the style from sam adams, but this just isnt their best work. I'm sure with some tweaks to the amount of sweetening ingredients they used it could become much more enjoyable."
""
""
""
"This is my first imperial from Sam Adams. This beer looks nice in the glass and pours well ,but both things are soon forgotten as the taste is sickly sweet banana flavor with some strange spice after taste. It's body is syrupy It's like a cross between a cheap malt liquor and a badly made witbier. In fact I'd probably rather just have the malt liquor. Sam Adams is not my favorite brewery but I normally find their beers session-able. They need to withdraw this one. I may have been harsh on this beer but i expect better from them."

"This is a very attractive beer to look at, and the smell of malt and spices is pleasant. But eventually you have to stop staring and sniffing and actually drink it. Then you are just assaulted. All the fruits and spices and malt and booze just hammer you. The common theme with all these imperial series beers is this syrupy sweet flavor bomb. It works really well in the Imperial Stout. Not here."
""
"The smell was interesting, I was initially intrigued. Really is a beautiful beer, loved watching it while it filled up my glass, like bubbly golden straw. Really large head. But, right when it enters your mouth you are just struck with a strong pungent burst, it discourages you from taking a large sip, I powered through and was not rewarded. It is really just disgusting. Too many flavors buying for your attention, and they are like steam rollers on your taste buds, they don’t get along. Save your money and don’t buy this beer, it’s only good to look at. I ended up using 75% of the 24 oz bottle for cooking because I couldn’t handle anymore awfulness. I really don't understand how anyone could enjoy this beer."

"I can't help but wonder if I had a skunky bottle, given the lack of ""best by"" date. I would be curious to see how this one tasted after a good year or two of cellaring. Maybe it's just a very unbalanced beer. It's pretty to look at, so I guess there is that."
""
""
""
""
""
"My pour produced a massive two-plus fingers of dense, bubbly tawny head that cascaded from the bottom and fell from the top, leaving nice lacing in its wake. Color was a cloudy orangish-amber. I definitely got coriander and anise on the nose along with a soft mixed fruitiness, reminiscent of chewing/bubble gum. Mouthfeel was smooth and creamy but the taste was a bit too riotous and unbalanced for my taste. I found myself unable to distinguish between all of the flavors trying to happen all at once on my tongue. I got vanilla, loads of spice and dried dark fruit, but it was all too much to parse. Finish was kind of hot on top of everything else. Man, this was much too intense for the style! Not everything needs to be ""imperialized""."

"I was keen to try this after having the Sam Adams Imperial Stout which I personally enjoyed. This turned out to be a pretty unique beer, certainly not like other Witbeirs I've had, and I can't recall seeing too many other Imperial Whites. It was a pleasant change from the beers I usually drink, but nothing too outstanding. Very very sweet as I'm sure is expected, with some semi-complex flavors make for a nice, if not extraordinary, white."

"To be blunt, this beer blows. It's sweet and has an over-the-top alco-boozy taste that lingers like you just took a swig of isopropyl from the medicine cabinet. No wait, that might actually taste better. Mouthfeel and appearance are fine so maybe just look at it in the glass and then go get something better to drink."
""
"Eh. This just hits me as too sickly sweet. And the fact of that makes it so that it overpowers anything else that may be trying to show. So, it's a one act show with a strong alcohol and boozy tone stepping in for an intermission. A miss in my book."
""
""
""
"Overall the tastes are a bit heavy and sweet for the style. Not really a fan of this Imperial Wit style although this is one of the better ones out there asn the yeast phenols are under control where some are not. Not great by any means but could be worse."
""
"Concur with other reviewers about nice appearance and mouthfeel. I drink witbeer routinely but in this case the cardamom completely overwhelms everything else. There is nothing subtle about the flavor, it is just cardamom. I found it nearly undrinkable and returned the unused bottles. Not one of their better efforts."
""
""
"I have a feeling this is a pretty old bottle but at 10.3% it should hold up pretty well."

"That this beer has a 79 is wrong. The Bros. need to review this."
""
""
"Overall: An interesting take on a Witbier. A decent taste, but a little too syrupy and sweet."
"Got a growler of this limited variety and finished the whole thing so I must have liked it well enough. Labelled as a witbier but was a little darker than most and certainly stronger and bolder than you would expect in that generally lighter style. More like a belgian ale, really. Overall a solid beer that is more of a sipper than a session. I think I liked it more getting it in a growler when I wasn't expecting to get anything on tap. Good and solid, not great."
""
""
"O- The back of the bottle describes in aptly- pushes the boundaries of a wit style. Could have been more, but as my first imperial white I like and appreciate it."
""
""
""
"O- This sounds terribly insulting, but the beer was great till I actually tasted it. From there, the booziness of the beer just made it difficult to drink. The problem isn't that the abv was high. It's that the alcohol wasn't balanced or tamed by any other characteristics."

"Poured this one into a perfect pint glass. it has a nice dark golden color body with some head that disappers quickly. The smell is on the sweet side with some citrus coming through. The taste is very bold up front, very sweet and strong of banana taste. I really don't taste any of the spices. The mouth feel is a little thick and it leaves a little bit of a after taste in my mouth. Overall i really didn't enjoy this beer, way to sweet for my likeing bad too boozy."
"Overall –While on the sweeter side, this is a nice flavorful imperial white. It is easy to drink and is at a good price. Sam does a wonderful job once again ad I would recommend this brew!!"
""
""
""
"O: it didn't receive overwhelmingly strong reviews here, and I must confess, I still haven't had any other witbiers, but this is an good beer. It is the pale version of an imperial stout - it has richness and delivery. Perhaps true devotees of witbiers take exception to this because they're used to a different product. Totally understandable. Maybe this is average for a witbier, and granted, its not terribly complex or sophisticated, but it is a helluva lot better than the BMC swill out there."
""
""
"Smooth & rich mouthfeel with fruity notes, subtle spicing and alcoholic warmth...goes down easy like a $20 hooker (sorry lol) The finish is spicy with again the alcohol flourish. One of my top Wits."
""
"It's a really great brew for pilsner fans looking to find something more."

"Not used to a witbier with this much gas."

"Tasting the beer, up front there will be a those spice and coriander notes, followed by honey and sweet malt flavors in the middle. The end is rounded up by some belgian style hops, but the sweet notes are still dominating. The 10.3 ABV are well hidden. An interesting beer, well done for the style."

"Samuel Adams is the most consistent American brewer. They try so many things and they never seem to disappoint! This beer pours a beautiful light golden color with a hint of spice and a light cream colored head. The beer is perfectly carbonated and is smooth for a beer with ten percent alcohol. It is rather sweet and goes down very smoothly. Easily one of the better white beers I have tried in a long, long time. Props to Sam Adams, the real American king of beers."

"O- I think this belongs more in the English Barleywine category than the Wit one. I'm really loving this, and wishing I hadn't waited so damn long to try it. I can't wait to age a 4-pack of this each year. I love all of the Sam Adams Imperial line!"

"This is a decent beer. It's definitely worth checking out. Most of the flavors are typical to the style but the additional malt and alcohol add depth and character that make this an enjoyable sipper."
""
""
""
"I like this quite a bit. It most reminds me of Brooklyn's The Companion, but this has a lot more depth of flavor and better mouthfeel. Good show!"
""
""
"O: Overall, this would be an excellent beer if it weren't for the overpowering alcohol. Maybe aged for a year or more would mellow it out enough for the malt and spices to shine a bit more."
"O - Interesting take on the style. I found it a potent witbier that pushes the envelope."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The best thing about this beer is the color. I'm not sure whether to applaud Sam Adams for pushing the boundaries on a witte beer or to totally ding it because it resembles nothing close to the style. I hate to say it, but it's an absolute mess. Give me a Whitewater IPA instead."
"O- Overall, I enjoyed this beer. I enjoyed the way it felt as I drank. Wish the sweetness were toned down a bit though."
"This one pours a hazy white-orange color with a tiny head. Aroma has a wheaty citrus aroma along with a fairly high amount of alcohol. The taste is wheat, citrus, and alcohol. It's not terrible, but the style just probably isn't well-suited to being imperialised. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and well-carbonated, and the drinkability suffers a bit. It's an interesting beer, but not one I'd probably be prone to having again."
""
"Overall: A witbier, really? Let's put that aside for now. This is a wonderful brew. Complex all around, floral, sweet, fruity, caramel, bready, tart. Wow! 10.3% ABV, tastes more like 6.5% ABV. Intense yet pleasant in both the aroma and taste."
"O: really neat that this beer uses no caramel malts but the sheer amount of 2 row makes it orangeish. Too boozy, missing cloves, banana and bitter orange in the taste. Sweetness is prevalent though. Wouldn't buy again."
""
"Oh well...I had to try it."
""
""
""
""
"An OK beer overall, although I was expecting a bit more. Definitely a witbier. Good finish, though."
""
""
""
""
"Hazy deep amber with thin off-white head. Noticeable orange-peel coriander aroma. Hoppy fruit bitterness to start. The heavy fruit sourness in the middle is a turn-off. Not terrible but I’m having a hard time wrapping myself around this one. This isn’t what I expected so I’m disappointed. Seems like more an attempt at an IPA."
"O: Full bodied, heavier beer. Noticeable flavor even right out of the fridge. Develops nicely as beer comes to room temperature."
""
""
"This one's a failure; doesn't resemble a Witbier in any capacity, ""imperial"" or otherwise."
"O-The light subtleness of a witbier is missing, none of the spices and wheat flavors are present. Also the alcohol is not masked well at all."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not the best Sam Adams on the market. Way to sweet, and way to boozy for me. Nothing like the complex delicacies found in your standard witbier."
"O-not a fan. I was really curious when I saw it because I had never even heard of an imperial witbier being done. Luckily it was pretty cheap but Sam Adams definitely did not create a unique brew here, or at least not in a good way"

"Overall Drinkability - As a witbier, I can't really grade this beer since it's absolutely not a witbier. For being an ""imperial wit", as it sets out to do, it's very, very interesting and quite enjoyable."
""
""
"overall: this one doesn't seem to get much love but it's a standout imo."
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy light brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by alcohol, a touch of spice. Taste is also of alcohol from start to finish, a touch of citrus is present. Feels light in the mouth with a slight alcohol burn and overall this is the 2nd beer from the imperial series that I have tried, and the 2nd epic fail."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Recommend this to anyone who is seeking a ""sweet"" beer. Don't let the honey fool you this beer has KICK. Super smooth and tasty, no it's not a tripel or your favorite or your favorite abbey ale...it is what it is. Special blend of orange and honey easy to drink but not for everyone."

"Definitely an interesting concoction. A different kind of strong ale that is really pleasing if taken in the right attitude. Sip very slowly."

"I am a big fan of Boston Beer Co. Sam Adams Lager is my go-to beer in a non-craft-beer bar. However, Imperial White not only doesn't do it for me, but it actually pushes me in reverse. Maybe my expectation is just too different from the result. After all I expect witbiers to be light and refreshing. which hardly goes well with imperial designation."

"O: Well, I doubt I will revisit this beer. Two swallows and it was a drain pour. I tried to put myself in someone else's shoes drinking this, wondering how anyone could possibly enjoy drinking this. The smell will be the thing I remember most about this beer. Nothing else in the smell came close to smelling like beer I know of. I can't imagine my palate developing to the point of appreciating this beer one day."

"Appearance is cloudy, dark and gold. Smell is well balanced for a Witbier. Nice notes of orange and coriander, very noticable to the nose. Taste is very similar to a barley wine with hints of a Witbier. Mouthfeel is very creamy on the tongue, however it does leave the mouth nicely. Overall this beer, barley wine, will leave you short on a Witbier. Ok brew and it is drinkable, you just need to know what you are getting."
"Overall, i don't know what's changed in a year. I've been trying a greater variety of beers, and this beer has had a chance to mellow a bit. All i can say is that right now i like it. I doubt my other bottles will have a chance to age any more, as i'm thinking of drinking the rest much sooner than another year from now."
"Pours a brownish-orange color w/ a nice one finger off white head. Excellent lacing on my snifter glass. The nose is coriander, orange, malt, and wheat. Not super strong- a little on the weak side for me- but not bad. The taste is a little of a let down. It's just too over the top sweet for me, and that doesn't let me appreciate anything else in this brew. Wheat, coriander, and a boatload of sugar are what I get. It's almost like drinking sugar water. Feel is super sweet- cloyingly sweet- and relatively thin. Overall, I probably won't look for this again. The over the top sweetness ruins it for me. Cheers."
"Overall, this is a pretty intense beer. The only reason i kept it for so long is because I really didn't like it at first. The aging helped this beer a lot. And I have one more bottle I plan to age even longer. But, If you're looking at the Sam Adams Imperial series, the stout is a better choice."
"I only had a 4oz pour, but i could not finish it. I appreciate a brewery taking chances with a beer, but to me, this one did not pay off."
"Pours a deep cloudy orange into my southern tier snifter glass. 1.5 finger head with good retention and decent lacing. Smells like a belgian, sweet, spicy, with high alcohol nose. Taste is sweet and spicy with slight orange booze flavor. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy. Seems to thicken as it warms. Very nice. Overall this beer is pleasant and enjoyable. In moderation of course."
"This is definitely not for the faint of heart. If your norm is along the lines of Bud Light or if you consider Corona adventurous you may as well hang it up. This beer is fantastic for those of us who appreciate a kick in the ass. A great tasting beer, but definitely catches up to you quick. A bold flavor, but great nonetheless. Fair warning is to drink it cold and finish it while it's cold. It is substantially intolerable when warm in my opinion. Definitely a good beer overall."
"Modestly carbonated, sticky and thick mouthfeel…again none of the refreshing or clean aspects of a Wit. Not pleasant to drink, just ill considered and weird. I don’t know if every style should be imperialized in the first place, but I was open-minded and somewhat excited to see what they came up with. Big letdown here. Definitely can’t recommend it but if you can buy a single they’re usually pretty cheap and you can decide for yourself."
"O - This is a delicious beer but doesn't taste much like Witbier. A Belgian Strong might be a closer comparison. Either way, recommended."
"Overall: Decent tasting beer. Not bad looking but is a little strong. Enjoyed it as this was a beer I've been aiming at for a while but I would not make a habit out of it."
"Overall: This was a decent tasting and looking beer, but it did not match up to the description given on the bottle. It also was not as complex as I was expecting. I probably won't buy this again. Samuel Adams has other offerings that are better crafted and better value."
"(O) Not what I expected out of a witbier, even an imperialized one. This thing drinks more like a barleywine and doesn't have that nice, cloudy light body to it. Kind of a spicy mess that is either too spiced, too fresh, or too much put into a simple beer. I have two bottles left and I plan to age them and see how they do with some time. I'd like to think it can't get much worse."
"O - Too sweet for me. Honestly the booze doesn't bother me that much, but it's just not very well balanced and really syrupy on the palate."
"Overall - this is one awful beer. I usually am kind to most beers but this one has to the least pleasant beers I've ever sampled. I guess this would be good if you had a cold and were out of Nyquil..but I tried 4-5 sips (hoping it would get better) but it did not. Drain poured after 5 sips."
"Overall, this drinks like an attempt that didn't really work out. For an ""imperial," the flavors are too mellow, not enhanced by the extra ethanol presence or heaviness, and don't come together well. Ditto the scent. I don't see myself revisiting this one."
"O: Pretty good high gravity beer for a decent price. The wife even approves of this one."
"kinda mixed about this witbier. maybe if the sweetness was toned down a bit i would have given it a higher score. overall i would recommend it."
"O-Ok, but for an amped up white, a beer like Hoegarden Cru tastes truly like a concentrated version of Hoegarden. This is a completely different beer-if it wasn't for the orange aroma I would not relate it to a witbier. The oily syrupy mouthfeel of this beer is a little offputting for me, but this is a decent beer that I wouldn't mind having again. Wonder how it will age."
"Had a single in my fridge and drank it tonight. Poured into a stemmed glass. Very different look than what I was expecting. I was hoping for a cloudy yellow beer, but instead I got a clean sunset orange color. Not bad looking, just different. Looked more like a Belgian pale ale. Smell was sweet, but in a cough syrup way. Taste was pleasant but nothing special. It had flavors of grapefruit, cotton candy, and lemon zest. Mouthfeel was a bit thick for a witbier, and overly sweet on the palate. I am not sure why they want to showcase this style of beer to be over 10%. Just strange, and I am not sure the high abv helped. An overall odd beer that I am happy to have tried but I don't see myself buying again."
"A complex and sturdy ale, and well worthy."
"Tasting the beer, up front there will be a those spice and coriander notes, followed by honey and sweet malt flavors in the middle. The end is rounded up by some belgian style hops, but the sweet notes are still dominating. The 10.3 ABV are well hidden. An interesting beer, well done for the style."
"Overall:Not the best in the Imperial Series by SA but drinkable. Will not turn down if offered but won't actively seek again."
"I had been tempted to try out the Sam Adams Wee Heavy, but now I fear it too may be victim to the same unfortunate tastes."
"O: Much bang for your alcohol buck if that is what you are after. Interesting flavor combination that leaves me wanting to try it again."
"Ditry burnt orange color, huge 2 finger head, massive carbonation rising through the beer keeping the head a solid tight bubbled 1 finger head. Overwhelmingly sweet on the nose. Big fruit flavors such as oranges, apricots, coriander, nutmeg, caramel, and of course alcohol. Nice sweet orange and apricot taste, heavy on the sweet sugar, makes it very sticky and thick. The taste is so sugary sweet its putting my eyes in the back of my head. Heavy on the mouthfeel, this beer is a big sugarbang. Very tart. Overall, i had some trouble with this one, i couldnt handle the sweet, it seemed artificial and syrupy at most times, others i could get a good sip. I could afford my self no more than one of these in one sitting, but i certainly wouldn't rule it out."
"Overall, this beer definitely pushes the boundaries of what it means to be a Witbier, as it contains all of the flavors regular fans of the style expect, but pushed to an almost inconceivable extreme. This beer is the flipside of nuanced. No doubt this will have a polarizing effect, some thinking the result fantastic and others finding it too powerful. Personally, I think it's superb."
"Overall-Great tasting beer. This is my first ""Imperial"" white ale/witbier and really liked it. Prefer this over their Dobblebock and Imperial Stout"
"Pours a semi-hazy orangeish hue with a huge fizzy foamy slight off white head. Aroma is full of orange and citrus. In the flavor, honey, orange marmalade, lemon and suggestions of coriander. The wheat malt base and orange flavor last long into the finish, the 10.3% alcohol is felt but barely percievable in the taste, just a hint at the end. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, alittle syrupy, not bad for such a big beer. Overall, this is a good ""Imperial"" wit. Strong and satisfying."
"O: Not again please. Thank you very much."
"O: Not my favourite, but not as poor as I feared. A very interesting creation, and a worthy one at that. Recommended, even if I wouldn't want another anytime soon."
"O - A great Sam Adams choice. Pretty bold, which I expected from this Imperial series. Flavorful and pretty accurate to a strong Belgian Wit."
"O: As a fan of both ""big beers"" and Belgian ales I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. It is an attempt to make a Witbier into a big beer and I think it is quite successful. That being said it won't be for everyone, as it strays quite a bit from the typical Witbier and flavor wise it isn't what one would normally associate with big beers. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Belgian ales AND big beer, and also to anyone who enjoys an experimental beer; it's certainly worth trying at least one."
"O: not the best Sam Adams offering I have had but it is above 10% which is pretty sweet."
"O - The worst offering from Sam Adams I've had to date. Much too hot and sweet without any complexity and completely overwhelming. Avoid!"
"Overall - I really enjoyed downing two of these, but felt as though it lacked a little carbonation for both its style and alcohol level. A solid interpretation of an imperial wit."
"Overall, this is one of my favorite beers. And aging it is an amazing thing."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on June 30, 2011. It pours a murky, hazy copper-amber with thin white head that sticks around for awhile. Loads of bubbly carbonation ascending upward. When I check out the aroma my first thought is that it is more like a Barleywine than a Witbier with its sweet caramel maltiness and alcohol bite. Maybe a hint of spices. The body is durable on the tongue. The flavor clears out the senses due to that 10% ABV I expect but otherwise I get some sweet malts and thin spices and a whole lot of punch (not fruit punch...I am referring to its alcohol nip). It impresses me more as a Barleywine rather than a Witbier."
"Overall - Overall, this beer was too sweet for me. I enjoyed every single sip, but I would not pick up this beer again over something much less sweet."
"Overall a nice enough beer, though the unusually high ABV (for a wit) and the over abundant sweetness impaired my enjoyment."
"Very sweet and somewhat boozy, candied orange and crystal malt reminds me more of a faded imperial IPA than Witbier. Extra sweet and caramelly. Dry prickly finish, alcohol is way too forward here, just unapologetically boozy. Slick and syrupy feel, high gravity largesse, it coats the mouth and nearly triggers the gag reflex... that's no good. Yuck. Going to be a drainpour for the last bit of it. Not recommended."
"Overall, I find this brew very interesting. The beer does not remind me of of a traditional White ale. But, it is certainly worth trying. To me it is just a great American twist on a classic style."
"This pours a hazy tan with a good head, I see yeast and other particles floating around, from the looks of it this is an unfiltered beer. The head retention is very nice and has a mostly white color. The smell is malty and wheat with a little bit of citrus, not bad. Good mouth feel, the alcohol is very present. there is some carbonation, its a medium thickness. The alcohol burn is present in the taste, more so than I normally like but the abv is high. I don't get the wheat flavor I was expecting, but its still good. Overall a decent beer although not quite my favorite, I'd still prefer the boston lager if I'm drinking sam adams."
"O- Certainly not your (insert random relative's title here)'s Witbier. If you think of this as a Wit, you might not enjoy it. Instead think of it as some crazy big beer with roots leading back to witbier then you can enjoy it for the unique creation it is."
"D - this beer is all up front in its flavor and at 10.5 % abv I wouldn't do more than 1"
"O: Pretty good.."
"Overall: Very heavy witbier, awesome job Sam Adams! (Heavy in the Marty McFly way)"
"It's a good beer. It's got the makings of a Belgian, but it's a bit rough around the edges and that's the difference between this beer and something from Belgium."
"With the 10.3% alcohol I'm already feeling it half-way through the beer. The flavors are great and I would definitely drink this again. My only complaint is that it's a little too sweet."
"O: Not bad...not great...not quite sure what to think of this imperial white..."
"Overall: This beer is better to me than the average of the reviews seems to be. I think it's solid, but doesn't necessarily fit the style, but style be damned. SA typically doesn't let me down, and this isn't an exception to that notion. I think one is plenty overall, though, it's a little heavier and the ABV kind of kicks my butt."
"It's over-priced - there are similar good quality witbier that can be had for less. For this price, I will usually want to get real German bier!"
"This is interesting for calling itself a wit, but not bad. I'd place a flavor profile like this in a Belgian strong ale genre."
"The Imperial White Ale was probably my favorite of the three that came out in this series. I thought that the Stout and Bock would have taken the crown but they didn't. This beer pours out much darker orange than I expected it to for being a white ale. The head was pretty thick looking and left behind some good lacing. The smell of the beer has the typical coriander and yeasty citrus aromas along with some spice. The taste translates the aroma into flavor and even gives off some floral flavors as a bonus. The mouthfeel is much thicker than expected as well. The be isn't all that heavy but it had some serious body to it. Overall it's a really nice brew and really worth looking into."
"The drinkability is there for me, in moderation. This is no lawnmower wheat, this is a sunset, deck sittn wheat. Oh ya!! If its not ""true"" to style cause its to strong or sweet, it works for me just fine."
"The coriander and orange flavors remain intact and I guess the wheat does too, but I have a hard time thinking of this in terms of wit. The texture is honey thick and tastes almost as sweet. Thick, drippy booze squeezes this one like an anaconda. It is complex, and quite tasty, but its not a witbier to me. Belgian strong pale, yes. An interesting experiment. Worth a try."
"Overall - Even though this is listed as a witbier, beware, this is not your typical wit...I actually went to the brewers website and this is actually explained in detail, that the brewers intention was for a very bold, strong representation of the style. Well they did, and then some! I truly like this beer, but I don't love it...definitely a nite-cap, definitely not a sessionable beer, this is for sipping. And my recommendation again is to try this one around 40 degrees to really appreciate the complex flavors...because once you get up into the 50's, this becomes a sweet syrupy alcohol bomb. I will purchase this again, but know what your getting yourself into...big flavors, big alcohol, and a big buzz...you've been warned, in a good way ;)"
"Overall, this is a very interesting beer that is very rich, and well done for it's style. However, I can't say it's definitely something I'll be buying again."
"This poured a disconcertingly bright orange with a heady scent of sweet wheat and didn't get much better. I found it overly sweet, kind of like a chocolate orange had been dunked in eggnog and left us with a weirdly cloying mouthfeel and no hop bitterness to mention. Actually became a drain pour in the back half."
"Overall: A little too extreme of an interpretation of this style. It sacrifices traditional witbier hallmarks and drinkability and for booziness and heavier body."
"Notes: It’s much heavier and less drinkable than a normal Witt beer. This is interesting but way out of style."
"I pass on this in the future."
"O- Overall this is a average drinking beer. The alcohol does really come out a ton and for that it makes this beer a little unbearable at times. Well I shouldn't say unbearable but just average overall. The ABV is a little high making this a one and done drinker."
"D/O: Very light and drinkable despite all of the flavor. This is rather troubling considering the alcohol content. Overall it is a very good beer."
"Poured Clear Orange, with yellow hue around the edge.Fluffy white head, deminishes quickly....light lacing. Orange peel and coriander spice in the nose, with lots of heat from the alcohol. This is a big beer, and a huge wit. Thick, syrupy mouthfeel with lots of malted caramel, bitter orange peel, spice, and lots of alcohol. I can really feel it on the exhale. This is an interesting take on a wit. Not sure of the aftertaste....clove?"
"For 10.3% abv it goes down very smooth."
"O/D: It's a ""one and done."" Enjoyable, but simply too heavy for a wit. Good offering by SA, though."
"Overall I think this beer could have been a bit more subtle. It is a white after all."
"Mouthful has a bit of a creamy touch to it."
"Samuel Adams Imperial White was amber in color and hazy. It had an off-white head with decent retention and lacing. The smell was sweet malt and fruit. The taste was sweet malt, fruit, and spices (pepper, coriander). The finish was fairly dry with some lingering spice and throat warming alcohol. It was medium-full in body with plenty of carbonation, a bit creamy. This is a tasty beer and worth a try."
"O- Can't see myself drinking too many of these due to the high abv and sweetness. This is a strange beer. In a blind taste test, I would have never guessed this was a wit. It tasted like a boozy fruit beer. You can't knock them for pushing the envelope, but this does not taste like a witibeir. I would drink it again though."
"Overall a solid beer, but perhaps a bit to sweet. The first thought that comes to mind is wheatwine light. Would love some more attenuation or complexity."
"O- Solid beer and can have one in a sitting even with the high ABV making it very easy to return to this beer"
"Overall I think the Imperial White Ale is a bit much but still a good dessert beer after a homemade dinner....Drink up!!"
"D - Great drink; very easy to drink; not sure why it was given such a low score but this definitely stands out for a Witbier; I could have a few more of this"
"D: Meh. I will not have this again, it is a train wreck of a beer. A novelty at best. I really need to remention the tannins in this beer. I dunno if it comes from the hops or the added herbs, but it's kinda funky (in a not flattering way)."
"Overall started as a nice tasty brew, but the alcohol basically overpowered the rest of the flavors at the end."
"The beer was poured into a glass. The beer is very clear with a very nice amber look. There was very little to no head. A very nice smell with a strong citrus smell. I taste oranges and spice in the beer. There is a weird gritty feel to the beer. Over all the beer has a decent amount of taste and would pair well with a steak. Cheers."
"Drink is meh, quite a bit of booze, sticky and syrupy, weird flavors and spices, meh."
"I'm not a fan of wheat beers, but these spicier witbiers are more interesting to me. I've never seen an Imperial White before, and now I know why. It's a cloudy beer with a spicy nose, but each sip establishes an expectation that I never taste. I expect this beer to round off and finish with coriander, cloves, and citrus. Instead, each sip finishes boozy and stunts my taste of the beer's spices. I tried drinking each bottle differently - opened and poured immediately, open and left sitting to air out a while, cooler, warmer, etc. - but each time the booze dominates the scene. Normally higher abv brews don't bother me (I'd rather a RIS over a stout), but here I'd rather have a witbier over this imperial one. Maybe let this cellar a few months and see whether the booze figures out how to live with the spices?"
"Drinkability is average. This beer lingers for a while so one beer could be enjoyed for a long period of time."
"D - Big taste, big price, big on alcohol. Don't have more than a couple and expect to taste much else that night"
"The beer pours an orange color with a decent-sized white head. The aroma is about what I expected. I get a lot of coriander, with a little bit of orange peel to balance things out. Smells like a regular witbier, only more intense. The flavor is similar. The predominant flavor is the coriander, but there is some syrupy, sweet orange marmalade notes in there as well. There is also a little bit of detectable alcohol. Easy to drink. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. I am not a huge fan of Imperial Whites, but this one was pretty good. It has a nice balance of the coriander and orange, which is what I look for in a witbier - imperial or otherwise."
"D/O- I've had this a few times in the past but there's always been plenty of time in between sessions with this beer. Thank you Boston Beer Company for starting the Imperial Series."
"Mouthfeel is full with a lush amount of carbonation."
"Overall: Not for the weak of heart. This is very boozy. I'm going to put a bottle away for a year or two and then revisit it. I have a feeling age with help this one remarkable."
"Overall, glad I tried it, but it's nothing special (and I generally love Sam beers). I wouldn't turn my nose up to one in the future, but I doubt I'll ever ask for one specifically."
"An extra note. This is not a typical white beer, so if you're looking for something along the lines of Allagash White, Harpoon UFO or Southampton's Double White, this beer won't fit that flavor profile for a second."
"Sam Adams Boston Lager has always tasted salty and overpowering to me, it's never been a drinkable beer for me, but if you happen to like it, save your money buying this overpriced version. There's nothing special here."
"I don't know. Do we need Imperial Wit ales? They did bock and stout, how about a belgian strong or IPA or DIPA instead?"
"Heavy mouthfeel. Good for one or two but certainly not any more than that."
"Verdict: Probably the most disappointing Samuel Adams I have ever had. The obvious marketing tactic in this beer is a high ABV, as the beer both fails to make any sort of connection to the Witbier style and instead goes for power and wow-factor through alcohol. Unfortunately, the appearance, taste and mouthfeel all suffer in regards to the audacity of this move, and the end result seems like a regular old samuel adams plus liquor to create a beer that will intoxicate you faster and with less drinks. If that's your motive for enjoying beer, get it... but be wary; $12 for a 4 pack of any beer even at a high ABV for the sole purpose of drinking to get drunk is really not the most affordable way to go out; there's cheaper beer for people that enjoy that sensation. Case-in-point: I didn't enjoy this beer. Avoid. D+ (2.4)"
"Overall, this is a great brew....I will buy more."
"Pours a dark orange, head dissipates rather quickly. Mouthful feels like alcohol and creamy. Not a Wit by any means."
"D - This has decent drinkability. It would be easier to drink if it was a little less sweet, and had less of a booze presence. It isn't a bad beer necessarily, but it is a lot different than I thought an imperial white would be. Overall, it's a decent beer. I would try again if some one else buys it for me."
"Overall: Not my type of beer.Not what I expect a witbier to be."
"overall this was a bad release i have to say, it is just too hot, unbalanced and just does not work on any level."
"Drinkability: Unfortunately this was not what I was expecting. Probably would not try again, unless someone gave me one. Disappointing."
"D: I figured I would try a 4-pack, as I am a fan of the Witbier style. This one fell far short from enjoyment in my book. I'll stick with my Hoegaarden and Allagash, or the Southampton Double White if I'm looking for a higher flavor/ABV witbier."
"D- Awful, thick and medicinal with a booze burn."
"After having Infinium for New Years last week, I can't help but make comparisons with this beer... I was one of the people who actually enjoyed Infinium and found this to have similar taste and nose, minus the butteryness of Infinium. It's a bit darker and less carbonated, but other than that, they are very similar IMO. I know this was made before Infinium, so it seems like BBC likes to use many of the same ingredients in a variety of their beers. Not a bad thing by any means, but I just thought it was interesting that this and Infinium (by my tastes, of course) tasted so similar."
"I am usually impressed with Sam Adams products, this one leaves me hoping it gets better with age."
"I understand now why this is the first Imperial White beer mass produced, it is terrible. As there was no ""best by"" or ""bottled on"" date on my bottle so I am not sure how old it was and that may have had an unknown effect on this beer. The beer pours a thick looking orange color with light head. I noticed some sort of solids sink to the bottom of my beer, mildly concerning. The smell is very boozy, some orange is noticeable. The first sip was enough for me to know I wasn't going to enjoy this, but continued on for a couple more to at least get the experience. In the taste the citrus shows up again accompanied by some coriander and spices. The mouthfeel was big and heavy. Overall, I didn't really enjoy this beer, I poured the last half of it out. Jim Kotch, this was a noble effort, but I don't think Imperial whites were a style that was meant to be."
"Stored at a constant temperature in a wine cooler since purchase. Pours an actively carbonated golden amber. Very fine protein sediment has started to develop and is suspended throughout. A thin, microbubbled, tannish head rings slightly around the glass. Smell is ripe white grape, rich lemon, and herbs. Taste is a potpourri, sort of a blend of sweet and sour ale, bananas, and wet, rich grasses. The feel is thick, like a heavy white wine, and the finish is sour and tart, as well as boozy, and a bit sugary and sticky. In the end tho, a sour face persists. Drinkability is medium, but this is a heavy beer.."
"The alcohol was obviously present and tasted like vodka had been added to the beer. The flavours all tasted fake and added, and I literally poured it down the drain before finishing a bottle."
"D: Definitely an easy drinker for the high ABV. Well done, Samuel Adams."
"There seems to be an ""Imperial"" category for many a style, but not witbiers, which you would think makes pretty good sense. That is, until you run head-on into this offering from the BBC (confusion with this acronym only exposes one's non-American upbringing here...)"
"12 oz bottle. Pours hazy amber color with a thick, white lasting head. Aroma is of yeast, fruit and wheat malt. Full, tangy body. Lots of fruit on the palate as well as caramel, yeast and alcohol. Long, sweet, fruity finish. Interesting, enjoyable brew."
"I was curious to try this beer coming back from Germany, having been hooked on German White (as opposed to non-German versions). Starts off with almost a syrupy like mouth feel but is a very consistent and smooth taste. The higher ABV is felt towards the end but isn't obvious in the taste and results in a very well balanced beer. Not my favorite but definitely one I'll get again. Though maybe not recommended, drinking it with a slice of lemon makes a big difference for the better in that the acidic citrus really does a good job of balancing out the very basic mouthfeel."
"The beer pours a hazy copper color, had a white head but faded fast. The smell of the beer is of booze and licorice. The taste stars out with a weird sweet taste, but is boozy all the way through. The sweetness tastes like possibly wheat, with some caramel sweetness. The mouthfeel is medium, and the carbonation is low. Overall it is drinkable, but I guess im not overall impressed with this one."
"I remember trying this one when it first came out and strongly disliking it. Figured I'd give it another shot after ""developing my palate"" (I hate using that phrase, as it really sounds kinda wine- (or anything-) snobby, but I can't easily come up with a better one). It pours a hazy Clemson-auburn (why should Auburn be the only tiger-based school with a color, hm?) topped by a short-lived half-finger of white foam. The nose comprises mandarin oranges, lemon zest, light cardamom, and light toffee. Unfortunately for these elements, they're all covered by a thick fog of McCormick's vodka, plastic bottle and all. Sad, really. If it had meshed somewhat nicely, like a strong screwdriver or something, it would've been fine, but this is just too much. The taste is more of the same, with a bit more orange this time 'round (moving closer to a peel, though). It's just an overly boozy mess of a taste, just like the smell, but is somehow less astringent. I can't explain it, either. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta sticky feel. Overall, this is just too much for what it might even want to be. The booziness is so omnipresent and malignant that I really don't want to continue drinking this very much, much less get any more bottles."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish color with yellow hints and an off white head. In the aroma, quite spicy, cinnamon, dry alcohol, kind of like rubbing alcohol. In the taste, orange and or coriander, a cinnamon spice and dry alcohol all the way through. A smooth and medium to big bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dy orange citrus and spice in the aftertaste. Alcohol is too big, kind of smells of rubbing alcohol or like hairspray."
"I like wits quite a bit. Noble attempt I guess, but I just don't think this works very well."
"D - Overall it was pretty enjoyable. I could see enjoying at least one a sitting and will have to try the other beers on the imperial line."
"Drinkability - Ehh...glad I got only a single. I like the other two SA Imperial series beers, but this one missed the mark in my opinion. Very boozy and thick - almost too much to drink for a 12oz bottle."
"Pours a cloudy moderate golden color with a white head. Nose brings a lot of booze and some stone fruits, peaches, and a bit of banana and spice. The taste is really dominated by booze with some slight peach flavors in the background. Feel is very poor, nearing on awful, with some cloying sugar and booze. Way too thick, even for an imperial wheat beer. Much thicker and more boozy than the typical wheatwine. Not a good beer."
"Moderate carbonation and a fairly light mouthfeel despite the sweetness and higher ABV. Vanilla and caramel up front with lots of orange/tangerine citrus and a warm, boozy finish. Pretty tasty, but splitting the bottle two ways turned out to be plenty."
"Just read LiquidBread's review. Looks like I'm not the only one. Ew!"
"D= For me this is not drinkable to much of a boozy taste for me but it's hard to drink for me didn't really care for this beer at all."
"D - one that I was surprised by, and yet another (just like DfH 90 Minute) that I was pretty sad about once I finished. I think I bought the last one in the store. time to bug them for more"
"this is big and warming. before finishing my glass i felt the need to remove my outer shirt. first beer of the night, really boozy."
"Drinkability - not a bad beer at all but damn is this thick. On top of that the alcohol isn't really that disguised. I don't know, this one just confuses me. Like I said its not bad but neither is it a must try."
"Sam Adams Imperial White pours a beautiful dark amber color with a nicely delayed head of foam as bubbles rise to the top. The taste is interesting. It seems to start out bitter only to diminish quickly. The only way I can describe it is that it seems to have a sort of ""cotten candy effect"" Something new to try but at full price probably not a regular drinking beer."
"This is a little out of guidelines for a witbier, to me, along with the extremely high abv. characteristics are that more of a trappist ale."
"Pours a caramel bronze into a pint glass. Odors of orange, but also, somewhat unfortunately alcohol and what my wife calls sharpie marker. You can definitely taste the orange Belgian spices, but the alcohol is also extremely prevalent. It has a very thick mouthfeel, almost syrupy. Overall, I like this beer, but it's a bit too powerful for my tastes. I could never drink more than one, even if I had the desire to do so."
"Almost like drinking a shot. The appearance is nothing to write home about. However, the aroma is intoxicating. The most wonderful taste going. I can't quite place it, but it is very good. Just the rite consistency and feel. I could keep drinking these all nite."
"Pours a hazy amber with no head. Smells sweet and malty, with banana and caramel. Tastes of spicy coriander, yeast, banana, white pepper, and cream. Very long finish and slightly sweet. A little too sweet and stodgy in the mouth- particularly for any species of wit. A pleasant enough beer which although spiced like a wit doesn't give me the feeling at all of drinking a wit. The extra malt it took to get the beer up to ""Imperial"" strength pretty much eliminated the crisp, citrusy pleasures of a wit and created something else entirely- somewhere farther along the spectrum toward a dunkleweiss, at least as far as flavor and mouthfeel goes. Still, not bad- just not wit like in the least- other than the additives."
"D,notes: I wasn't expecting this. Not much like a Wit but this beer tastes pretty good. A little too thick on the mouthfeel."
"Second Sam Adams Imperial I have tried. I think they're gross. I will shy away from the others."
"D: Nice upfront malts and spice with quite a hot finish that make it hard to finish. A good warmer in a cold day."
"This beer while not a true wit is very good."
"Seems ""wit"" is a bit of a stretch for this one. Seems more like a belgian spiced ale type of beer. It doesn't detract tho, it only makes me question the style a bit. If it had been listed as a belgian I wouldn't have thought twice."
"D-It is to good found myself drinking a few quicker then I should and the high octane of this brew hit me hard 20 proof shouldn't be this easy to drink"
"When it's cooled below fridge temp, it takes on this amazing somewhat viscous, cloudy and sparkling amber texture unlike any other beer I've seen."
"Nice thickness. Alcohol is present but not overwhelming. Drinkable, if you can get over the sweetness."
"the first three sips are quite interesting... it has a intense syrup of grit and bit of honey malt. i can tell there is some wheat that has gone turbid. although this does have a floral barley wine quality its acidic quality seems more like something that is over fortified. as does the bite. its acuatually has a similar to a braggot in palate from outside of smoothness of mouthfeel. the mouthfeel is cold tablet like."
"to be honest this beer is good but for me is better suited drinking on a cold day than a humid July night"
"This is a fine witbier that pushes the envelope. A departure from the style in some ways, it almost takes on the character of a strong red ale. More for sipping after a good meal than refreshing."
"Taste is very good. I am a fan of Belgian style ales and that is what this is. Proper glassware is important. It is not a White/Wit. It is sweet, and as it warms it is boozy (10%). To me it tasted more like a good Belgian Quad. I will add this to the stock of my beer fridge."
"12oz bottle served in a goblet. pours a hazy, light amber color with a finger of head and moderate lacing. so far so good. the nose is fruity, boozy, and malty with some spice evident. taste? simply put, not good. a well-intentioned brew that falls flat. too boozy, too sweet. tried to like it, esp considering its cost, but ended up a drain pour. not for me."
"I've put off picking this beer up for some time, but am glad to have finally tried it and may pick it up again."
"D - This is a huge beer meant for sipping, but it is surprisingly drinkable despite the obviously high alcohol content."
"Notes: Nice offering from these Imperial Series, closer to an wheatwine-strong Belgian ale interpretation of a witbier more than anything else. It remains intriguingly drinkable but there is little if anything about the ""boundaries of a witbier"" like the brewer suggests."
"Beautiful cloudy light amber smelling slightly of citrus. Tastes like a traditional witbier up front, citrus and wheat but with a stronger bite. The high alcohol content is very well hidden so beware. Still tastes smooth on the back end , but I began to taste the alcohol a little more. Overall, another good beer from Sam Adam's"
"M/D - a bit thicker than I was expecting, a bit too sweet for me, but not completely undrinkable."
"I would have to agree with the label on this brew. It is not a standard witbier and should have its own category. That said, the alcohol needs to be masked better in this brew. I've had stronger stuff done better in that aspect."
"D: Overall its a good beer but thats about all i will give it. It could be a little better and the flavors, in my opinion, arent very well mixed together. It seems like this beer still isnt quite sure what it wants to be."
"d: a little much for what tends to be a more drinkable style as heavy beers go, kind of a challenge but what do you expect"
"D- I didn't think this was one of the easier beers to drink. Nothing in this brew really felt balanced. I guess some styles aren't meant to be ""doubled and imperial."""
"Mouthfeel was fairly heavy & sweet. I thought this was OK, just not at all fitting with the expected style."
"Maybe I was just in the mood for this, but I really enjoyed this more than what most of the people I was with thought of it."
"While perhaps not the truest to style of Sam brews, this is surely the most interesting thing to come out of this brewery in a long time."
"Drinkability: I appreciate what Boston Beer Company is trying to do here. It gets my applause. But after tasting it I said to myself, ""Was it really necessary to put this one out for public consumption. It's an interesting brew. But a four-pack among friends is about all I need...ever. A true sipping beer. This beer does not ""push out the boundaries of a witbier," it crosses the boundaries."
"drinkability - It's a decent beer but i can barely drink 1... i just want it to be over"
"drinkability- this is a beer i took a while to drink and just sipped on it. and didn't want more."
"This isn't a witbier. This is more like a wheat strong Belgian. Not impressed, maybe one of the least enjoyable Sam Adams I've had."
"Medium body, medium mouthfeel- good overall. Drinkable, even though on the heavier side. I like this brew, and were it not the last one in the fridge would be opening another right now..."
"This beer poured a dark orange color with thin white head that dissipated quickly. Didnt have a very strong aroma, but I did detect some fruit in the nose. Taste is fruity, some spice, and some alcohol is evident. Mouthfeel is heavy. Drinkability--probably would not have more than one of these at a time. Mediocre."
"Better than your average wheat beer. Sweetish aromas. Pours creamy head, and creamy above-average thick mouthfeel. Carbonation greater than average. Satisfying and drinkable. Some orange, spices. Some sweetness, fruitiness, the bias is not too sweet."
"Edit: So I had one bottle of this left and tried to drink it again. It was a drainpour about 3 sips into it. There were disgusting floaty things in there which reminded me of diluted vomit, especially since it was thick and uncarbonated. It smelled of rancid candied orange peel. It tasted as one would expect a vomitey rancid sweet orange beer to taste, and is completely undrinkable. Wow. Seriously avoid this one. (Numbers are from first review, thought it was more fair than the bottle I laid down for a bit, hoping it would improve)"
"Buy again? Yes. I'm a sucker for Sam Adams Imperial series."
"Notes - Not much carbonation and I think a little more carbonation would help this beer. Not bad considering the ABV but I think it could be better."
"D - Seems like a strange marriage of a bock and a witbier which I find surprisingly enjoyable, but I don't think I would seek out another 4-pack. It'll be interesting to hide the rest of the 4-pack and see what this tastes like in a year."
"Pours a somewhat hazy orange amber with a fairly thick and fluffy, if not too persistent, off-white head. Aroma is wheaty and yeasty with a citrus, mainly lemon, undertone. Strong flavor is wheaty and lemony, a little sour, with hints of fruity sweetness and hop bitterness and an edgy alcohol bite. Texture is milk-smooth, fairly fizzy, and a little edgy."
"I like it. As a matter of fact I like it a lot. Witbier? I don't really think so but who cares, it's good."
"Tried this in a bottle, based on a friend's recommendation. Appearance, beautiful amber, cloudy with lacing throughout. Smell and taste--much more Belgian than what I'd expect from a witbier. Lots of citrus, spices. Reminiscent of candied orange slices with a big burst of alcohol. Warm going down. I really like this beer but the alcohol-taste could be a little more subtle."
"Style defying. The massive sweet wheat and fruit combo backed by a manly alcohol backbone works at first. However, about half way through I started wishing it would just lighten up."
"While this isn't something I dig usually, I can definitely appreciate it for what it is."
"drinkability - the age hurt this one even though the label reads age for many years - it has turned into i dont know what a strong ale i guess"
"drinkability - more than one of these would be overwhelming, it isn't a great beer and the alcohol is present"
"This really feels more like a Belgian dubbel or even tripel than a witbier, and overall I like it. Not bad even if it is a bit confused."
"I think this would have been more aptly named ""Double Summer Ale"" because that's exactly what it tastes like. Not that it's a bad thing completely, I really like the summer ale. However, some of the flavor and surprise of the summer ale is lost in the alcohol."
"haven't tried the other imperial series offerings, but this one makes me ignore the naysayers and take a gander."
"D - weird one here. definitely style-defying...loads of sweetness and fruits but hair-growing alcohol. enjoyable, but i'm getting weary (and buzzed) about halfway through the bottle. a pleasant winter sipper."
"Putting aside the fact that it may or may not look or feel like a wit, it is tasty and the alcohol (while present, and high) doesn't overpower at all. Pretty easy to drink."
"Drink - .. I had a few beers earlier today,.. but this one is weighing me down. It should at 10.3% though. Good thing this thing comes in a 4pak."
"M/D - Pretty big and heavy body which is refreshingly nice for a witbier. A little bit of an alcohol taste way in the background that lingers but still finishes slightly on the drier side. Complex flavor leaves you wanting more."
"Overall, this beer is very good, and I highly recommend this for any Witbier lover!!!"
"Feels a little over the top. Id be inclined to try this at ~8% ABV. I can only do 2 or so of these before it gets too much."
"Only drawback, its so much, so sweet, so different, that you shouldn't drink more than 1, and at 10$ a 4p, its reasonably priced for the quality."
"D - Low, not only because of the high ABV, but the strong taste makes it enjoyable, but too much for more than one or two in a single sitting."
"In summary I think this beer is worth sampling, but for me it won't be a regular in my cellar."
"I took Samuel Adams Imperial White out of my buddy's fridge, not expecting much. I was wrong. This is complex, tasty brew that I enjoyed."
"Overall, I have been very impressed with the new things Sam Adams is trying. My beer snobbery is being turned on its head as American brews are catching up to the European masters."
"Not like any other Wit I've had.... very strong on all levels.. Give it a go... Like a Wit on steroids !!!"
"Medium to full body, mouthfeel is a little thick. Overall this is pretty good, obviously stronger than the standard wit but pulled off very nicely. I wouldn't want too many of these but to just slowly enjoy one, it is good to have."
"At 10.3% ABV, the Imperial White is not something one should relegate to party duty, but I could easily claim a 4-pack as my own for one evening. This is - thus far - my favorite beer brewed by the great minds of the Boston Beer Company. It is an outstanding execution that offers a pleasant challenge to your sense of taste."
"I'm not much of a fan of witbier's but this one made a believer out of me. I recommend it to anyone."
"I liked this beer but it was not what I expected from the lable. I don't think this is the best representation of the style."
"Poured from a bottle to an Ommegang chalice. It pours a very hazy amber, very thick. It did not produce much head but has pretty good lacing with what little head it did produce. It smells of sweet fruit with hints of alcohol. It has a very smooth and somewhat thick mouthfeel. It tastes like sweet citrusy fruit. Pretty good."
"Not exactly something I would drink at a bar and or a nightly basis. However, I would enjoy this beer on special occasions specially during colder months."
"Overall this is amazing beer."
"As much as I enjoyed this, it could be even better if they amp'ed up the wheat aspect a bit more. Definitely a repeat buy!"
"D - Interesting beer, definitely not a very well defined style. I would have to say that it's interesting to try, but I don't know if I'd pick it out again. I think it really needs more wheat-malt-like character. It seems to really be missing."
"Overall I was disappointed with this beer. The amber color with light cream head was very aesthetically pleasing but the taste didn't live up to the appearance. It was too heavy and the flavor characteristics were too strong for a wheat ale. I have one more in my fridge, but don't plan on buying it again. That being said, it was very unique and worth trying if you are a fan of the style and in the mood for something different."
"This is an interesting specimen. Worth a try for fans of witbiers, IPAs and barley wines as it offers characteristics of all three styles, but unfortunately not the best characteristics of the three. The best part of a withbier is its light fruity character, and this is too heavy for that. It likes the hop bite of a good IPA, and is a bit too citrusy for a good barley wine. An interesting project though and glad I had it anyway."
"D- Not a drain pour, but definitely not my bag. Too sweet, not-to-style and overcarbonated."
"Drinkability isnt high becuase there was something I just really disliked in it."
"I was taken with this beer immediately upon having my first one a couple weeks ago. Glad I didn't get hung up on thinking ""wit"" when approaching this, because it gives a pretty swift middle finger to tradition. And all I really care about is what's actually in the glass. Between this and Noble Pils, Boston Beer Co. prove they can still do great things with beer across a wide spectrum. Make this one a year-rounder please!"
"Overall, I'm rather impressed with this one... A Witbier? Not sure about that.. More like an abbey ale and a damn good one.. Went well with the extra sharp white cheddar and whole wheat crackers..."
"Cheers!!"
"D - I'd probably stop after one but I'm curious to see what age would do to it. Again, not a bad beer but I wouldn't call it a wit. A little strong and rich to be drinkable."
"Overall - I'm really diggin' this even though I thought I wouldn't be. I'm interested to grab some more and see what a year does to it in the cellar."
"The beer pours a hazy dark golden/orange color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a very rich, pale and wheat malt scent with some light spicing and a fruity yeast aroma. There is some alcohol warmth, but it's minimal. The taste is decent as well. It has a thick pale and wheat malt flavor. It's not as spicy as a traditional white ale. It borders on wheat wine territory. It goes down smooth with a bit of heat in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good beer. I'm not overly impressed, but I wouldn't turn it away if it was offered."
"Samuel Adams Imperial White is delicious beer that has held up very well in the nearly one year since its release. It isn't as good as Bell's Batch 8000 and Southampton Double White Ale, but it isn't that far behind. A yearly release would be cause for celebration."
"Seek to try it out but don't slam back a four pack. You'll be praying in the morning."
"This is a good drinkable beer that will soon catch up to anyone who does not pay attention to the label."
"Pours to a translucent amber-copper color, head is decent and holds up well. It has a nice spicy citrusy aroma with some coriander, clove and lemon flavors. The alcohol flavor overpowers the beer itself but you can still get traces of the coriander and clove with a bit of sweetness."
"It has an awesome head. That is creamy and has thick foam. There are a lot of tight bubbles to the tan colored lace. There is body is brown with moderate carbonation. It has an awesomely smooth and creamy mouthfeel. The aroma is fruity with clove, citrus and banana like esters. It is not as hopped as one would imagine. It has a wonderful citrus flavor. It has a smooth and full body."
"I was extraordinarily impressed with this beer. With the price tag it will be an occasional re-buy. Great gob SA!"
"interesting? yes. a winter warmer? hell yes. overall a good experiment and satisfyingly acceptable? no."
"Pours medium honey-amber with a short bit of foamy head, lacing is very minimal. Nose is a bit alcohol-y up front with yeast and bananas following. Taste starts off with strong alcohols, but then evens out with sour, breads, and a hint of bananas. Not very sweet. For the ABV it goes down pretty smoothly."
"D: It's in the upper echelon half of beers I would choose to drink."
"D-Not bad for 10.3 abv, but not the sort of thing to drink on a warm afternoon. It is well suited to sip with dinner or some appetizers like light cheeses fall seasonal fruit."
"Ive tryed the imperial stout, and this and I look forward to the double bock next week, as these have been enjoyable brews from sam adams."
"D- Not excellent, but not bad. This is a beer for sipping, not gulping."
"Flavor is fruits blended with caramels and spice. Bubblegum and banana esters make an appearance, as do the slightest hops. Finish is quite dry."
"This beer had a cloying maple syrup flavor that was surprising and a bit unpleasant. I found myself wishing that I could have the other flavors that this beer offers without the sweetness. It's not without its merits -- the syrupy flavor I found so overwhelming had woody and brown-sugary notes that tasted good with salty food. It's definitely a beer that you'll want to drink with snacks, though I'm not sure if it would complement a real meal. I quickly got tired of the sheer sweetness, though, and couldn't get through an entire beer."
"D - While lately I've found the Imperial [Style X] (where Style X is traditionally a light, quaffable beer) rather annoying, I'd been wondering how Sam Adams would pull off a really big wit. Although this beer has several enjoyable elements, I found the alcohol a bit messy - boozy even for a Weizenbock, to my taste. Worth a try, but not something I'd regularly revisit."
"Unfortunate that this is a Sam's offer - pretty disappointing."
"Poured into a Chimay glass, appearance is opaque, hazy amber colour with decent head and little lacing. Smell is like that of orange and a liqueur. Taste is fresh orange, honey, and coriander with a heavy bite. Very heavy mouthfeel with a wet tasty finish. This is a premo beer that is perfect for after dinner or with a fruit pie."
"A slightly hazy amber color body with a medium sized off white head , medium carbonation , some spotty lacing left . Aroma is of sweet orange and coriander maybe a hint of peppercorns .Flavor is very sweet , mostly orange with some very sweet honey and coriander flavors and a hint of alcohol on the finish , some yeasty fruit notes and a bit of yeast . Full body with a creamy mouthfeel . A little too sweet to be sessionable but I found it to be quite enjoyable and good ."
"Overall, a pleasant beer that I'll happily drink the rest of the 4 pack of, but I'm not sure yet about a second purchase."
"D. Not my idea of an Imperial White. Darker color and way too boozey. Spices and flavors are drowned out by all the alcohol."
"The mouthfeel was all about the alcohol, some bitter bite at the end. Sense this is a high gravity it's a once an evening brew, good carbonation and a light feel on the tongue."
"This beer, while interesting and a great example of a strong beer without a strong alcohol taste, is not one that I could drink very often. As I finish the bottle, it reminds me more and more of candy than beer; some extra hop flavor (there is very little, however this is characteristic of the style) would help to balance the overwhelming sweetness that is present. This beer would make a fantastic addition as an ingredient in desserts."
"D- Drinkability suffers, just because this is a very unique brew, the first double wit I've ever had, and it's hard to say whether I actual enjoy it or if I'm just captivated by it's experimental nature."
"Drinkability: An interesting witbier. The high alcohol content makes this a unique wit. Maybe not worth the price, but certainly worth a try."
"Drinkability: An okay beer, but the high ABV is a bad thing in this case, as there isn't much more to it than alcohol. I still like it, but it doesn't get a high grade as it's very one-dimensional."
"In the vein of a lot of Dogfish Head stuff, I gotta give SA credit for trying something kind of bananas (literally), despite my not actually enjoying it tremendously."
"I'll drink almost anything that Boston Beer puts out, although it's a hit or miss with them. I enjoyed this beer, but as with many of their other beers in their expansive collection, I'll probably just have it this once."
"Not a witbeer, although notes of coriander are present. Not the usual white, a light orange brown with some initial head when poured into a snifter. Tastes more like a dark Belgian ale- think Gulden Draak with some hops. High alcohol, smooth mouthfeel and very drinkable. Major buzz from the 10.3% ABV. I like it a lot even though you are not going to be drinking a lot of these at once- one of the special offerings from Sam Adams that is worthy."
"Taste is yeasty, pears, alcohol and sweet. This beer has a rather sour aftertaste that affects the drinkability the alcohol is also not very well hidden"
"I'm not really a Witbier fan, so I avoided this beer when first released. Curiosity eventually got the better of me and I had to try it. Pours a nice coppery color from the bottle with very little head. Similar fruity/spicy aroma common to a Witbier, but stronger. First sip and the high ABV is immediately obvious. Goes down with a nice warm burn. The hoppy bitter of a Witbier is almost completely missing. This definitely has more of a rich, malty flavor, sweet and sugary. It may have a Witbier base, but this Imperial White is something unique. Like some others have said, it seems more characteristic of a Belgian Tripel than a Witbier. If you're looking for something true to style, avoid this. If you're looking for an easy-drinking surprise in a high gravity beer, definitely give this one a try. I'll be picking up more of these."
"Not what I'd call a Whitbier, but, pretty damn tastey and a surprise from Sam Adams."
"Avoided this one out of the ""Imperial Series"" but glad I finally found it on the discount singles shelf at the local liquor store. All three brews are good and I'd recommend them for their merits."
"Either way, an excellent offering which concludes my trip through the SA imperial series. Not a single thing wrong with any of them."
"D: This is a drinkable beer, but if you're expecting a light and airy Witbier look elsewhere."
"a bit of a battering ram that i doubt the pioneers of this style would have foreseen"
"D - i can't get over how heavy this beer is. not a session beer, but very worthwhile to sit back and enjoy. out of the imperial series currently for SA i would rank this behind the double bock."
"I absolutely loved double bock by Sam Adams when I tried it but this just isn't the type of beer that transforms well into an imperial style, IMO. Its not that bad, just something I wont buy again. I am the kind of person who sees a unique kind of beer and must try it simply out of curiosity so if you are like me, by all means give it a shot. However, if I am in the mood for a witbier, I will go with the lighter versions which are more smooth and crisp instead of this thick syrupy version."
"Drinkability? I'd have to say....not so good. The abv is 10.3% and I can ""feel"" every percentage point, believe you me. I won't have a problem finishing the other 3 bottles of the 4 pack but that won't be accomplished for some time."
"Pours a quite dark copper color for a wit, not near as light as most white ales, and with hardly any head and lacing (I know the extra malt makes it darker, but then it's still not a white ale). Decent scent, some nice malt with a slight fruity aroma. Malty taste, with the alcohol covering up most of the wit attributes; hardly any pepper, citrus, clove, or any other flavor over the high alcohol and malt flavors. A little rough going down, too."
"D: I really enjoyed this beer, my first imperial white. Deceptive in its strength, the high alcohol doesn't inhibit drinking more than one of these babies, and the taste isn't overly sweet and spicy like some wits can be."
"The aroma is great, full of fruits and lots of malt, full full full, it doesn't lack for interest. A bit of tang, a touch of wheat, very nice. Taste is along the same lines, full of complexity. Citrus in a tangy beat, nice malt, a bit hot. Mouth is medium full, slight carbonation, again the alcohol is a bit hot, and it almost works, but a little too hot. In all, a tasty beer, very interesting, fairly complex."
"Moderate burn of alchohol make a little rough finish to this one."
"This ale when poured into a glass was the color of a hazy thick deep amber, with little foam and a medium amount of lace retention. The smell of spices like cloves, cinnamon, orange peel, also a hint of wheat and yeast. What a great balance ale that is one of my favorites in the Sam Adams Series!"
"Very nice deep dark amber with no head, slight lacing. Aroma is quite boozy for being over 10% abv. Quite spicy and slightly syrupy but not as much as 120min IPA. Pretty solid big beer from Sam Adams. It is really pretty good."
"D: An enjoyable drink, spicy, dry and edgy. Comes off like a cross between a dunkelwiezen with yeasty attributes and the spiciness of a white that worked well together mending the best of both styles. Six pack worthy but take is slow at 10.0%abv it goes down like a 7.0-8.0%. Good enjoyment overall and fairly easy for its high abv."
"Pours clear gold with a tight but hefty head. Aroma of bananas and spices along with a breadiness and some alcohol. This beer hits the tongue with an interesting and complex flavor; typical hefeweisen fruit, clove, and grain, sweet but mostly balanced, but finishes almost unbearably boozy and medicinal. The ten percent ABV does a seriously poor job of integrating with the pleasant flavors of the beer. Mouthfeel is fine with active carbonation, but drinkability is nearly non-existent due to the extreme alcohol flavors- I'd honestly just as soon drink Nyquil, the booze is so overwhelming. I finished a four pack over the course of several days but would absolutely not buy more, and am a little put-off to the rest of Sam's imperial line up as a result."
"I'll have to admit that this is my 3rd bottle and the more I drink them I'm enjoying them more. I don't ever think this will be great. The alcohol is too dominant, the richness is too intense, one bottle is the max per session and the aroma is only mildly appealing...yet this is okay and I'll enjoy the fourth bottle."
"Yum, but not at all what I thought it was going to be."
"I'm a big fan of Witbiers, but I was greatly disappointed in this beer. The amounts of hops in this overpowered everything about this beer. I could not taste any orange, coriander or any of the others spices associated with witbiers. I would not reccomend this beer."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, imperial white is much darker than your average Witbier, more of a cloudy copper-orange color with a glistening off-white head that leaves Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, imperial white is much darker than your average Witbier, more of a cloudy copper-orange color with a glistening off-white head that leaves nice lacing on the glass. The smell is fruity sweet with an orange-banana juice profile; there is also some coriander, slight alcohol and just a touch of spice. The taste follows suit nicely with the sweet fruitiness coming to the forefront, but on the swallow there is a huge alcohol burn. Citrus and coriander definitely present and a touch of peppery spice. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a rich and creamy head and a dry, mouth-coating film finish. Drinkability of this is pretty good considering the 10.3%, probably not one you would want to drink the whole 4 pack of in one sitting. Very interesting take on a Witbeer."
"* Bought the Imperial series in single bottles at The Andersons in Lima. A little on the pricey side but no different than you'll pay for a premium beer in the local pub"
" This series has been an adventure, and i thank Boston Brewing for it. I like that they are trying new things. And I would say they are being quite successful at it. This beer is by no means good, but on that note it's really not bad either! I'll be drinking these to kick off nights with the in laws! Boozy but that's not always bad when you need that buzz to relax a bit!"
"D - The Imperial Series has not been my favorite. It seems like its an attempt to just up the power of the flavors of all the ingrediants and amp up the booze. The balance just insnt there for me."
"Taste is also rich and hot with alcohol. Spices are mild and blend well with the extra malt. Starts soft but finishes tart with acidic citrus."
"Good experiment. Result? Not sure what they were going for or if they accomplished it. Next..."
"Drinkable in the sense that I would have one again in the future. I don't think it would be in my best interest to have too many of these in one sitting."
"Overall, by being to boozy, it overshadows the highlights of this beer. Just too much in one beer. More like a Belgian ale than a witbier."
"D: Overall I would compare this more to a tripel than a wit but it was pretty good nonetheless."
"No question that this is an 'imperial' brew ringing in a 10+% ABV. I must admit though, even though there is some alcohol warmth with some sips, its still a smooth and drinkable brew. Personally I find this to be one style that doesn't need a jacked up ABV. I like my witbiers to be as quaffable and refreshing as possible. Just my .02"
"D: This struck me as Hoegaarden on steroids. Very big and intense. I'm glad I tried it."
"Hazy, dark, orange, amber pour, with medium viscosity. The off-white-to-tan creamy head settled in at about 2 inches. The nose provides ample evidence of wheat, with citrus, and spicy notes. The nose leans toward power and I expect a hefty brew. There is almost a medicinal note? The palate is rich, enveloping, warm, and lingering. The alcohol is evident. This is not a summer session wheat ale! The Belgian lace is well-developed, leaving clear rings as I sip, although after a few minutes the head is gone. Malty, fruity, less citrus than expected and more coriander with hints of mace and vanilla on the palate. Long, pleasant lingering. I’ll try this again as the weather cools."
"First thing noticeable upon quaffing is how creamy and thick this beer feels. Add in the sweetness and the beer almost seems syrupy to a fault. Orange and lemon peel flavors are there aplenty along with black licorice and alcohol. Witbiers are a style I can do without the whole imperialization thing. They lose the refreshing and crisp aspect that I like in a good wit. That said, this is an interesting beer that I find somewhat enjoyable, but I dont think I will be buying another expensive four pack of it anytime soon."
"I found this beer to be very interesting. Looked pretty good, slight haze, had an off white yellowish/orangey colored head to it that fades away pretty quickly. Had some slight lacing to it, not very much. The smell was kind of all over the place. Had a strong citrusy/spicy. The taste was good to, but there was just so much flavor to it. It had one particular taste that I couldn't quite put my finger on. Almost seemed like a orangey type jam flavor. You can taste the alcohol a bit in the aftertaste but not very strong. The mouthfeel and drinkablility were good. No carbonation bite and despite the high alcohol content you couldn't really taste it. I don't regret trying this at all, not normally my cup of tea, but pretty good."
"I thought it was interesting that Sam Adams chose to do an Imperial White as part of their bold series...and was actually the last one I thought I might try...but, as it turns out, this was the first one I picked up...and it is pretty darn good. This is definitely not a beer that I could have more than one of, but is one that is enjoyable to sip on, and one that would pair nicely with some spicy foods, or a really good, marbled steak."
"D: With the refreshing taste and inviting mouthfeel, I could see drinking a lot of this."
"Overall, I liked this beer; boozy but good."
"Not a particularly enjoyable beer. Pours a delicious looking yellow haze that is nearly completely opaque. Great head and lacing too boot. Smell of bananas and...alcohol. Taste is similar too. Almost burns as it goes down. Not something I'd look for in a white. Starts like a good example of the style, fruity and hazy, but then gets a little carried away with the alcohol. Couldn't imagine having another, unless the first got me drunk enough..."
"Samuel Adams Imperial White is a cloudy, dim peachy amber ale with a very thin, dense white head that leaves tenacious, thick sheets of lacing on the glass. There is a lot of alcohol in the nose. It smells tangy, fruity and spicy. Banana is present. It's quite full bodied, very smooth and dry. It's a touch chalky at the finish. It's a touch sweet and very fruity. It dries up through the taste and gets spicier and boozier. It's sort of like a Wheatwine, or an ale version of a Weizenbock."
"I am sure glad I tried it but there is no way I will be having this again. The balance is flawed, and the alcohol is very present."
"D - Too sweet and somewhat a mess of flavors. I wouldn't try again."
"Overall, no...not again. That was enough. White beer??? This muddled mess tastes fake."
"Tastes sweet, apple and cider notes mixed with with a banana cream. Some spice and honey. Every other sip I can taste some alcohol. But...how is this a white? It's more fruity than anything. Pour a thin head, smells of banana nut cream. Reminds me of the Hard Apple Ale from Moose's Tooth Pub & Pizzeria"
"Final Thought: A little disappointing, almost an overly exaggerated Witbier with less appeal than a well-crafted Wit."
"I would suggest avoiding this one. Thanks to JaBier for providing this one, even though I did not enjoy it."
"Feels fizzy and bubbly. An alcoholic bite on the way down. It's a mix between a hef and a Belgian ale. They don't go together as well as I'd hoped."
"D: This is an extreme beer that's for sure. Not quite my taste."
"D - This was a solid imperial white...it loses just a little for the high ABV...I've been very impressed with the Imperial Series...all three are solid for their styles"
"The drinkability is impressive for a ten percent wit. This style is usually nowhere near a favorite of mine, but this beer is quite nice."
"Drinkability: The high alcohol contnent masks the aftertaste after a few gulps, and thisbeer becomes very good. I easily finished this beer and the experience became better as I drank."
"As far as drinkability goes, the ABV makes this beer somewhat less desirable. But this trade-off comes with a good feel on the tongue that is well worth it."
"I haven't had too many wheatwines, but this seems to me to skew close to one. Think of this as a wheatwine, and you'll be OK. Interesting, solid effort from the BBC."
"A thick, syrupy interpretation - like a candied version of a wit. Quite boozy, too. Interesting...different."
"Solid palate impact, nothing outstanding but a decent mouthfeel overall."
"A feeling of awe comes over me when I see a Sam Adams brew at 10.3 percent abv, but why does it have to be an Imperial Wit. Appears a deep honey golden hue with a creamy off white head, body is clouded and full of spice. Aroma proves the appearance with coriander, orange peel, and loads of honey like sweetness with booze hidden decently in the smell. Syrupy feel to the flavor with spices booze and honey sweetness cloying from the front the back. Mouthfeel is just as cloying as the actual flavors going on a fuzzy furry feel like licking a peach comes over ya. Carbonation is supposedly soft and fluffy but I'm getting syrup and booze with a touch of remnants of a white ale and a honey like blur passes my senses. Drinkability is pretty pour not a beer I would sit on any pedestal I guess I have to look for the Impy Stout, and I know the Bock had some redeeming qualities at one point."
"Hazed turbid amber and impossible to see through with a big soapy eggshell colored head that leaves plenty of fine lace on the glass. The nose is overripe banana, coriander, cinnamon and a touch of fusel alcohol. The flavors mirror the smell, tons of malty sweetness, spice and warm alcohol in the finish, this beer is bigger than any wit I've ever had by far. Creamy, borderline syupy mouthfeel with smooth carbonation. This is definately an extreme example of the style.. and I like it. I couldn't possibly drink more than one in a sitting but I am impressed with the boldness of BBC to brew such a monster. Worth a try."
"Sam Adams Imperial White pours pretty dark for a White ale. It's a hazy amber with a short-lived white head. The aroma consists of bready malt, banana, and alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium in body with a nice carbonation to it. This is a sturdy wit beer to pair with food. Wheat malt and cloves are upfront with banana in the background. There's a fruitiness to the finish. Touch of cinnamon. Alcohol also becomes more apparent in the finish as the beer warms slightly."
"Drinkability - a big beer for sure, I enjoyed it and will see what time does to this."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly for the high alcohol content it goes down really easy, definitely worth a try."
"Overall, I was a bit surprised and actually enjoyed this beer, as I am not the biggest fan of witbiers. It has reasonable flavor and it's thick enough to appeal to my stout loving side. Overall, worth a try at the minimum and I will likely have a few more to enjoy."
"EDIT: the warming alcohol and the mouthfeel were both so intense that by the time I neared completion this bottle's contents were nearly undrinkable. Strike what I said earlier about this not being ""a bad beer."" It is."
"D- Lost some points in the drinkability category... mostly due to it's syrupy mouthfeel. I also started to feel like this would be the type of brew that I would get a headache from if I drank a bomber of it (not sure why that happens with some of them... perhaps a good forum topic for later). I enjoyed the complexity in this offering and was thrilled to hear that the Imperial Series would be a regular release now for Sam Adams."
"Pours a three finger off-white head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Slightly sweet raisin nose. Flavor is raisin, background alcohol, nothing like a white more like a Belgian strong ale. Good whatever it is. $2.75 for a 12oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"d - this beer has the thickness and characteristic sweetness of a double bock which is unfortunately a beer style I do not like. This is a lot like a fruity sam adams double bock. I can't finish this beer without some food to break up the heavy sweet onslaught. Did I mention this was a thick sweet beer? *shivers*"
"Drinkability: The one bottle will suffice, thank you. Forgoes the refreshment and grace of a standard witbier with its burdensome body and cloying nature. My kingdom for some effervescence! By the end, my trip to the bottom of the bottle had slowed to a mere crawl, even with the much needed aid of some water."
"i paid 10.99 for a four pack and am very satisfied. after two im through and will save them for another date, a good buy and very drinkable"
"Served: in an oversized wine glass."
"to drink this beer is a blast it's a fun brew, it goes good with sausages ,or corn and salad with a mild dressing ,I'm even going to age a bottle!! and i would get this again not often though."
"Drinkability: Good but not Great. Its a refreshing beer considering its alcohol content... I wouldnt buy it again but its good."
"Thick, very thick. This beer could definitely use some more carbonation. Sans vigorous pour it starts with a brief moment of prickliness, but in general it is overly thick and chewy."
"Pours a hazy orange honey color with a small frothy white head. Excellent head retention and lacing. Flavor is overpowering spice, very sweet and honey like. It's tough to get past the over use of spices and honey but its definitely says ""hey I'm here"" to your tongue. The malts are a bit over-powering too. The alcohol is all there but I found myself not wanting to finish this."
"Pours a dark cloudy yellow with a frothy white head. Aroma of lemon, tangerine heavy spice and slight banana. Flavor is overpowering spice and very citrusy. Sticky short finish. Its tough to get past the over use of spices, frankly I didn't finish this one."
"Bottle. Pours a slightly hazy orange with a small white head. Aroma of sweet melon, honey, and sweet orange. Flavor of alcohol, sweet melon, banana, some vegetal notes. A rather bland and boozy Belgian and certainly not reminiscent of an imperial white. This is pretty bad, and I couldn't finish the glass..."
"D 4.0 - If you like Wit beers, try this one. Be warned it is rich, bold, and strong!"
"D- This beer puzzles me. The 10.3% ABV seems over-the-top for an Imperial White. It's odd that this beer has an even higher alcohol content than their Impy Stout and the Doppelbock. Other than the smell and the taste being pretty hot, it's a fairly tasty beverage."
"Overall, too overdone. This a a beer that has potential to cut into the Blue Moon crowd, but it is way too intense. To me I thought it could have been a Blue Moon with orange vodka floating on the top. Too high in alcohol and too much citrus that overwhelms the nature of the witbier. I couldn't even finish one 12oz bottle. Diabetes in a bottle at best. Hopefully this great brewery will try again and get it right..."
"(D)- Despite its sweetness and relative smoothness, the high abv (10.4%) really puts this beer out there into the sipper department. Its just so darn sugary!"
"D: Despite the alcohol, easy to drink, and sort of refreshing after a long outdoor day."
"It's just a rough taste that I don't like. The last sip made me gag and then I figured it was time to get rid of it."
"Note: I noticed that the label said you could sit on it for a while, but I can't imagine that making it any better. But hey, that's only my opinion."
"Dont get me wrong this is an intriguing intense beer and after a few years in the cellar she just might grow into something really special, but for now whoa!"
"The mouthfeel is big for the style and the beer does cloy, but a great session beer."
"Pours dark golden with slight hint of amber, with off-white head. Nose leans more towards grain/malt, with a small ripe fruit component in there as well. On the palate the alcohol is right up front to me, with big wheat/malt flavors, sugary & tart flavors, and some dessert sweet spices towards the finish."
"D- Similar to a wit, but quite different. Not as refreshing, but enjoyable in a different way."
"I love a good witbier and have had some great double whites, but this just isn't one of them. Pushed the style just a little too far."
"A really good Witbier. Something I would recommend. All of the beers in the Sam Adams Imperial Series have been a hit with me."
"D - Nice. I like it. Don't know how I would feel about the single though."
"A bit chewy, but I am really digging this from start to finish! Well played Sam Adams! I accept this as an IMP Wit, not a wit, but even then; I'd take it over watered down offerings, no problem!"
"Samuel Adams Imperial White pours a hazy orange/copper with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is on the fruity side and not as full as I would hope. The flavor on the other hand is pretty strong, it's malty, a touch fruity (citrus), some clove, not really much coriander. Somehow, it still doesn't quite have the best qualities of a good wit, perhaps because I think of a wit as being an easy drinking summer kind of beer. With this much alcohol it certainly doesn't fall into that category, but more importantly the flavors don't really gel in the way a great beer does. Not bad overall, worth a try."
"I really don't like this beer, not even a little bit."
"D - Well balanced, not overwhelming in flavor, alcohol, or thickness--which is certainly a good thing. Definitely above average for the style, but not a champion. Quite drinkable, but with a 10.3%abv, is certainly a sipper."
"I am very happy for the Imperial Series from Sam Adams, as it has been a nice & unexpected local step into strong beers with character. I was not sure what to expect, as ""imperial"" & white beer rarely are promoted. The dark-orange-brown pour with reddish edges was not expected, as I thought it would look closer to an Allagash. The white thin head & minimal lace were harbingers of the alcohol strength that soon became quite evident in the aroma of sweet malts & citrus-yeast. The flavor was sweet, much more than expected, with caramel & barley, leaving alcohol in the nose, reminding you to sip this beer slowly.Wheaty plum & orange hints rounded it out, but the overall impression was a dessert beer, or barleywine. Definitely a nice sweet offering but not a quantity beer in terms of drinkability."
"D-Really strong alcohol front and finish. Little depth to the overall drink."
"Pours a nice orange cloudy without much of a head. No lacing either. Smells wheaty, malty, sugary, boozy, hoppy. Taste is mostly sweet, with hints of booze and bitter hops. Mouthfeel is nice and syrupy and thick. Drinkability isn't great because of the sweetness and booziness."
"D - picked up a 4 pack to use to drink and to cook some mussels with, certainly not in the style of witbier I was looking for but I figured as much with the 10.30 abv, could see about 2 of these in a night...good beer but does not fit the style...wish i could score this beer twice, once based on style only and once on the actual beer itself"
"Drinkability- Potent, and a bit heavy for my liking especially on a summer day."
"D - I can see this served as dessert during autumn temperatures (with spice cake, for instance) or with cigars. This is beer may have its own category and at 10.5% I'm not altogether certain this is worth seeking out unless you can find it as a single."
"This beer is fairly simplistic and really not all that great. Not horrible either though, just not exactly enough like a Wit to be what I was looking for."
"Weird beer here, not sure how to classify this one. Tastes good but not really like Belgian White Beer. It is OK."
"Overall, I'd say it would be best to pass on this beer. The packaging is beautiful, but Samuel Adams needs to go back to the drawing board on this one. With some tweaking, and dialing back some of the flavor elements, particularly the overpowering sweetness, this could probably be a good beer."
"D - Interesting to try, but I won't buy it again."
"overall just an okay beer, that packs a punch."
"The combination of the syrupy thickness and the cloying/artificial-tasting sweetness made this one incredibly hard to put back. This is definitely not a traditional witbier... nor is it what I would expect an ""amped up"" witbier to be like. I don't think I would drink it again."
" Overall,very flavorful and complex, although a bit strong for the style."
"Overall- A potent Wit! Not bad."
"Pours a dark orangish colored body, with a smallish whitish head, that is diminishing. Very strong aroma of dark fruit, grapes, figs. Some sickly sweet aroma too, syrupy sweet smelling. Some lighter fruit too, but it's masked by the dark fruit. Maybe as it warms up more. Dark fruit taste. Lingering back taste of malty nuttiness. Very taste. Very light tasting compared with the aroma. Some light fruit. Tasty, but heavy. Will like to see how this one ages. Very floral and fruity. Carbonation, and soft mouthfeel."
"Overall--I'm not quite sure about this. I'm not shy about alcohol, this is really too much, I think. Too sweet, too much alcohol presence, and just too much orange I think. Could really use some better balance in almost all regards, I think."
"Pours copper-orange, cloudy, with no head. Interesting flowery spice aroma. Taste is BIG. Sweet, oily with nutmeg. Lightly carbonated. Alcohol is huge and medicinal; distracts from everything else going on. This is a great choice to tie one on quickly, but a little too over the top otherwise. That said, there are some interesting flavors and aromas going on in the background, so not a complete bust by any means."
"TopperXCP"
"One of those brews that, along with Utopias, proves that the widely available, often commercially-viewed Boston Beer Co. is truly a craft brewery at heart. A perfect brew for to celebrate the American Craft Beer Week, as it is truly an example of a well-crafted, boundary-breaking beer. It would certainly be interesting to see, as the company suggests on the label, just how this beer stands up to cellaring."
"Pours a hazy amber-copper with a creamy off-white head. Nose is strong and sweet, with abundant alcohol and apple, floral notes. Very boozy smelling. Flavour is similarly big on alcohol and fruity fermentedness. Orange and coriander are background at best, obliterated by the heavy malt. Quite sweet, bordering on cloying and with a touch of acidity up front. Slick, oily mouthfeel with a low carbonation is substantial. The sweet/boozy mix is interestingly complex and somewhat reminiscent of Samichlaus, but drier and with a bit of a wheatiness. Definitely different, although I wouldn't recommend it as a regular brew."
"While the flavor here is enjoyable, the cloying sweetness, combined with the high ABV would keep you from throwing very many of these back. Just smooth out that sweetness a touch and this would be very nice, though. I may put a couple bottles in the cellar and see what they do."
"Wow! I'm surprised that with so much malt the spices actually come through with such sharpness. But I'm getting ahead of myself. It pours a cloudy amber with an orange cast and gold and brass highlights beneath a short head of creamy yellowed-white. The head retention is good and it leaves walls of tiny spots and streaks as it goes. However, for a beer with such a healthy dose of glutinous wheat, and so much malty girth it should be better. The nose is fruity, and rind-like. It's citrusy (lemon) and gently spicy. In the mouth it's medium-full and spritzy , or perhaps that's zesty - with so much body I'm not sure it can be 'spritzy', so, yes, zesty. The flavor is as the aroma suggests but much more full. The malt also steps up to the front. It's wheatish and sugary, and it suggests caramel, or at least darkened sugar amidst the fruitiness (apples, lemon, plum). In a way it makes me think of a warm oatmeal breakfast treat. Oats and cinnamon? - not quite, but along the same lines in a way. It's also interestingly more clove-like than coriander-ish. That must be from the yeast. It's interesting, rich, and satisfying. The alcohol never shows, although it probably helps to focus the finish; and the bitterness is balanced to work with the spiciness so that it off-sets the sweetness of the malt just enough, and then lets it finish dry with a swirl of spiciness. Full and rich, and somewhat complex. Worth trying."
"Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with strong carbonation."
"Pours a clear auburn gold body with cloying but quickly dieing tan head. Citric and clove are evident in the smell, but some heavier hops and stick, sweet caramel notes are also prevelant. An interesting beer indeed for a witbier lover, as the high ABV is mostly hidden but slightly noticeable in the hoppy dryness of the beer. Medium-bodied and balanced, goes down smooth w/ orange and spices evident, along w/ sticky, sweet malt. Not a normal witbier by any means but a great beer to relax w/ and a must try."
"Pours from the 12 oz bottle an orangish-amber with a thick foamy head that settles into a heavy collar. There's an almost macro like fizziness...LOTSA bubbles rising to the top. Aroma is wonderful, a mixture of fruit (orange & banana) and a caramel/toffee note. The flavor is big, bold and wonderful as well. I pick up hints of the aforementioned fruit plus the caramel/toffee, plus a bubblegum like sweetness. The alcohol is present and gets more noticeable as the beer warms, but doesn't take away from the experience. The mouthfeel is quite substansial...this is a thick, almost chewy beer. Overall, a big, bold, BEAUTIFUL beer from Jim Koch & the crew at Boston Beer Company!! This is top notch stuff, and I hope there's more on the shelves when I make my next beer run!!!"
"MF/D: Too much alcohol for me. Too sweet as well. Not my cup, but I can see the appeal."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" beige head over the cloudy golden amber brew. Head falls gradually, with average lacing. Aroma is sweet, lightly citrus. Taste also is sweet to start, which segues nicely into a lightly tart lemony close, with a lingering warmth. Mouthfeel is WAY smooth, and drinkability is excellent. Very nice brew once you get into it."
"Damn fine brew for $2+ a bottle, may sure you grab a 4 pack before they're gone."
"The flavor leads with orange, drops in some pine resin, the coriander and other spices are prominent, while the malts take a nap mostly. What's there is awfully sweet, bordering on syrupy, with impressions of Nyquil creeping in. Really not a bad experiment, but this is one witbier that's gone too far."
"D: One big sipper, and maybe a little too sweet even taken slow. There's a lot going on in this beer - unfortunately, most of that is sugary sweetness. A whole lot of sugar sweetness."
"D- I was skeptic for good reason, i mean a 10.3% witbier, come on. It is exactly how I thought it would taste like though, A trumped up wit beer focused on sweetness. I'll take a regular wit any day of the week from Sam as a 10% witbier in the summer does not seem like a good look. With that said this is not the worst thing created, just predictable."
"This one starts off with a big, spicy, sweet aroma. Just a bit of lacing hangs around. Taste on this one is huge with bananas, herbs, malt, bitterness and alcohol. It's thicker than I was guessing it would be. It finishes with some hop dryness and spiciness that lingers. Very interesting and is a big beer to finish. 12oz is more than enough."
"Drinkability: This is a sipper.... but its quite nice. It should not be considered a ""lawn mower"" beer. This is for a nice relaxing evening. Rich and hearty texture."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, viscuous, and sweet. I just wasn't feeling this one."
"Overall I think this is a tasty but slightly over-priced beer. I think there is way too much alcohol for this to be an everyday beer which is a shame. I might get this again if I wanted to get drunk in a hurry. Otherwise, there are tastier beers out there."
"D - One or two, maybe the third of the four pack, but I doubt I could drink the entire 4 pack at 10.5 percent abv"
"Pretty well drinkable."
"D- I drank one and was pretty much finished due to the high alcohol content and cloying flavors. I appreciate this one because I have not had a witbier that pushed the boundaries as much as this one."
"Pours a hazy amber with a thick white head. Smells like sweet caramel malts and alcohol, doesn't really smell like a typical white beer. Tastes is of sweet caramel malts, alcohol, and some orange peel and coriander in the background. The only thing I didn't really like is how thick it felt. It is a bit syrupy. It tastes very good, so the drinkibility is good."
"D - This was a great beer, the style is not done as much and it was a pleasure to see someone take it up to the next level, this was a very tasty beer and great for the originality"
"Mouth is a bit dry but crisp. Drinks slow and is a new style for me. I am excited for more styles like this."
"Not something I would drink all the time but with the popularity of this style growing I am exited to try some more of them."
"I wasn't very impressed with this one and have had many better witbiers. This seemed to be an attempt to take a regular witbier and add a bunch more alcohol than expected without any additional complexity in the flavor."
"If you are a fan of belgian ales, this one is definitely worth a try. I am going to try to track down some more this weekend!"
"d: This is just too much of a good thing. If witbier were Coke, this would be straight up syrup. Still, this was oddly appealing."
"I poured into a nonic to an inch of head. It was a cloudy, copper color. It smelled of bananas, alcohol, and sweet malt. I was expecting this beer to taste horrible, but it did not. I was definitely different for me. I tasted of really ripe bananas and seemed syrupy. But at 9%+ ABV, it was not a bad way to start the evening."
"Pours a cloudy, orange/copper color. 1 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of banana, alcohol is noticeable, clove, some other citrus aromas, slight hops, and slight sweet malt. Fits the style of a Witbier. Mouth feel is thick and smooth, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, sweet malt, slight hop, spices, slight citrus, and a hint of tartness. Hard to define the rating system on this 'Imperial' White. Way too strong to be a good Witbier, but it is meant to be an 'Imperial' and is tasty. Overall, a relatively smooth beer, the blend of flavors is nice and the aroma is pleasant."
"M - Very well done. The carbonation is just right and the beer is full bodied."
"Edit: After having more than one bottle the alcohol really starts to become too forward."
"This beer pours a cloudy orange color. The head is an inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is completely overpowered with cardamom. I like to detect a hint of cardamom in a wtibir, but this goes way overboard. The taste is the same with a linger aftertaste that leaves me felling like I've just eaten a tablespoon of cardamom. The mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, I do not like this beer. This is the third or forth imperial witbier I have tasted, and thy have all been bad. I think I can understand why too. Witbier is a style that is all about delicacy, and you completely lose that when you try to imperialize it."
"D: I can't say that I really enjoyed this beer although I am glad I tried it."
"D = I mark this down because I tihnk this would be hard to drink many of in close proximity and for a once in a while beer, there are many I woud put before it. That said, it may just not be my cup of tea, it is not a bad beer at all."
"Overall, this is a ridiculous beer, but you have to be in to this kind of beer in order to enjoy it. Fortunately, I got this as part of a customized 6-pack, so I didn't blow the money on the full 4-pack. I'd recommend the same."
"Side note: I saw someone refer to this as almost being a wheatwine, and I kind of see that, as the beer warms up. It's an interesting perspective that might make you think about this differently. It's not quite as deep as the wheatwines I've had, but I can also get four bottles of this for roughly what a bomber of a wheatwine is."
"Pours a nice hazy dark golden brownish color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy head, with some nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, some yeast notes, banannas, coriander. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, yeasty, a touch of banannas/coriander. Medium body. Drinkable, not to happy with the taste of this brew so far, my bottle sez 10.3% ABV."
"Hazey sunshine amber tea color. Not a whole lot of foam or head. Only a couple of slow, tiny bubbles. Super heavy, sweet wheat and yeast malt aroma. Sugared fruits with maybe soe fruitcake. Very yeasty sweet smelling beer, especially as it warms. The taste has a juicey-juice fruit flavor upfront. The yeast, malt, and wheat combine to make a great lightly toasted fruit melange. Green apple skins, bubble gum, and some sweet cloves. I wish the palate of this beer was more dry than syrupy sweet. his beer was good sweet, but some typical witbier dryness would round this beer out nicely."
"Without knowing what it was I would probably guess right by the 2nd guess but I'd immediately wonder what was going on here and why it was so sweet."
"Although it's a little hot in some places, this is one pleasing beer. I wonder what aging will do to this? Anyway, approach this beer as a strong golden ale rather than a witbier, or you'll be overwhelmed by the flavor."
"D- This is definitely a sipper. With a beer of this strength, I definitely expect some alcohol in the taste but the alcohol pretty much completely takes this one over."
"Overall this is an alright beer, but this style just doesn't lend itself to ""imperializing"". It's bordering on being too sweet, and warming up does nothing to help it's cause. Worth a shot if you're curious."
"Not something I'd come back to any time soon."
"Verdict: Imperial White is not a bad beer, but a baffling one. If given this in a blind taste test without knowing the style, I'd have no idea at all what it was - Wit certainly wouldn't be my first guess. To me, Witbiers have always been light and quenching beers perfect to enjoy on a warm Summer's day. Imperial White is just kind of a syrupy, boozy wildcard that just begs the question ""why?"" Of all the styles to ""imperialize," why Witbier?"
"Overall, I actually enjoyed the original white over this (I drank them side-by-side). It was a lot easier to drink and more enjoyable than this. I really was looking forward to trying this beer, but I think SA went in the wrong direction here."
"d: easy to drink, not what i envisioned at all but an enjoyable beer with decent balance if you're expecting a sweet, malty beer with high abv"
"Cloudy orange amber color makes the pour look a lot like honey, and the head atop is small. The smell is that of coriander, orange peel, and banana, and it is quite strongly scented too. The taste is definitely several notches above a typical Wit, and the concentrated phenols rush in rapidly to form a barrage of clove, white pepper, banana puree, and apple skins. Surprising the taste is very short lived as the alcohol immediately dries the palette leaving a warm but vacuous aftertaste with a ghostly spiciness. Needless to say the next sip is necessary due to these parched throat conditions. Definitely different than a typical Wit, and probably closer to a wheat wine than anything else. I am glad Boston brewing company is still experimenting."
"Drinkability - This is very sweet - too sweet - I am turned off by the sweet syrupy thickness to it. Nothing too over the top flavor wise, but the alchohol is still present even with all of the sweet sugary flavor and spices"
"Drinkability- an overall good beer but to me a tad sweet from what i usually would be looking for in a white beer, couldn't myself in anyway have more then one of these in a nite just to much sugar and sweetness mixed with such a high alcohol level, this one would knock you on your butt and you would never see it coming, worth a try as its pretty unique"
"This reminds me more of a tripel than a witbier, but even looking at it that way, it's still terrible."
"I've never seen an imperial white so I had to buy it. $10.99 for a four pack. My bottle says 10.3% alcohol as opposed to the 9% listed above. It's the color of an old worn penny and has a dense and creamy vanilla-colored head. Opaque, too... Not too easy to see through. Fruity and spiced aroma. The bottle says orange and corriander and I'd say that's an accurate description. It's heavier than any wheat beer I've ever had. Thick and syrupy with a large amount of alcohol warmth. Grainy, earthy, bittersweet, and spiced. Lingering sort of sour aftertaste. Lots of different flavors. Some good, some not so good. LOTS of alcohol warmth. It feels like I'm drinking wine. This is a slow-sipper not to be drank in large quantities."
" This is a sipper brew, and really should be mor refreshing with a nice complex yeast for complexity but it's all malt and juicy fruit."
"Overall a detached brute of its parental beer style. I'm all for pushing the boundaries (i.e. Devil Dancer, Bell's 'Batch' beers, etc.) but this really doesn't work for me. Wheat malt is probably my favorite malt used for beer. Hopefully the wheat malt allocated for this beer could be used for another prototype. I compare this severe deviation of a traditionally delicate beer to Slayer singing my children a bedtime lullaby."
"Strong smell of bananas and apricots in the nose, and a big spice hit on the tongue. Strong hints of cloves, coriander and a vaguely peppery thing in the background. I think they might have tried a little too hard with this one. It's too sweet and cloying for my taste. A bit thin in both the finish and the body. I don't care for it too much. DISCLAIMER: Wheats, whites and hefeweizens aren't the sort of beer I like to drink, but they are beer and I feel I should give them a fair crack of the whip and be as impartial as I can."
"Oh, and my bottle says 10.3% ABV, not the 9% listed here on BA.... was this a different recipe or not?"
"Full thick body. Light carbonation. Very drying."
"This is my second SA Imperial series. The stout had the same ultra alcohol burst problem too. One more to go it appears."
"Tastes very much as its aroma indicated. Starts off like a heavy witbier, and that's really nice, but this quickly gets consumed by an assload of hellertau, nearly unpleasant, and then some strong alcohol burn at the end. Not bad, especially considering how unique it is, but really not good."
"Kind of sweet taste is a little much for an otherwise pretty good beer."
"D- one big bad motha, can't sit here and pound these all night but, hell, there's so much flavor that one can disappear pretty quick. all the wheat provides a luscious body but other than that, it just seems like a different style of big belgian beer considering the added spices aren't that noticeable. still overall it's an attractive, delicious beer worthy of a chalice or tulip."
"This is a dynamite beer....very ""Imperial"" and very complex....a sipper but I could handle a couple or more at one sitting as it continues to excite the more you drink it....great stuff..."
"A thick and consistent tan head covers a hazy reddish-orange brew. A nice stripe of lacing is left behind. A big whiff of coriander mixed with sweet malts is noticed at first. Some sugar, grapefruit rind and beer bread also exist. Tastes super sweet up front with some spice, subtle hops and huge malts all working their way into the experience. Also very sugary and bready with some sourness and alcohol heat figuring into the end. Intense at first until all the elements begin to separate and become discernible on their own. It's well carbonated with a medium mouthfeel. A very unique beer. Maybe too much so."
"I've had a few imperial wits before, Sam Adams does a pretty good job with this one. It just feels heavier than the other big wits I've had before (New Glarus, Bells Batch 8000) and not as much banana as I'd like. Still, a pretty good beer."
"PS. The glass is great too."
"D - This is quite possibly the best wheat beer I've ever had. It really is finely crafted with great aroma and flavor."
"Poured into my pint glass out of a 12 oz bottle. This beer pours a sort of hazy, dark gold/medium copper color. White head is about an inch when poured, settling to a nice thick ring lining the inside of the glass and a thin surface coating. Nice lacing. Has a floral, sort of fruity tang aroma with orange and coriander spice. Sweet malty taste along with the aforementioned coriander spice and fairly sweet tangy citrus. A touch of hop bitterness on the back end and just a hint of alcohol rounding out the taste. The sweet orange flavors do tend to dominate, especially as the beer warms up a bit. It does end up being a little bit too much for my taste. I hope it mellows out a bit with age as I am aging one of these in my cellar. Has a crisp, medium to full bodied mouthfeel with moderate to heavy carbonation. Easy to drink. A good effort here overall."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beer is a booze laden syrup. Honestly this beer is awful!... Sometimes you have to strike out to hit a home run. This was definately an example of swinging for the fences and striking out."
"D- This is a big beer with some spice and plenty of heat but there isn't much depth or balance. I don't know what age would do to this but without the alcohol heat there would be much character left."
"This beer is horid. Stale bubblegum and rotting bananas, did I mention that? Sam Adams Three Weis Men, the one off weisbock, from a few years ago was stellar, this however is shit. Hands down the worst Sam Adams product I've ever had."
"Poured a hazy copper color with a head that was only about a finger high, but quite thick. This head dissipated fairly quickly, but left plenty of lacing. As far as scent, I got a combo of juicy fruit and allspice. At 10.3% abv, my fears of overt sweetness were confirmed. I'm guessing this is unavoidable pumping the alcohol up this high on this style of beer. I do kinda like this brew, it is just too rich and sweet for me to have more than one. In fact, I would prefer this to be bottled as 6 8 ouncers rather than 4 12 ouncers. This would be a nice dessert beer or even a winter beer."
"Its been a long time since I purchased a Sam Adams brew, and this introduction to their ""Imperial Series"" did not disappoint. The Imperial White pours a hazy semi-dark orange color, with a nice head, the bavarian ring rims the glass nicely, foam in the middle thins a bit (as I'd expect in a witbeir) but doesn't disippate, which is nice. Smell is nice, but understated. The signature Sam Adams spice is present in the nose, as is a light hint of orange and wheat undertones. The taste is very good- I get an alcoholy, malty taste, with a subtle orange wheat flavor- very, very nice. Mouthfeel is just as promised on the package- warm, smooth, light spice, suprisingly light overall mouthfeel given the ABV. Drinkability is scary- A dangerously drinkable big beer, so beware. A great take on a the classic witbier style."
" I liked their Imperial Stout better."
"Murky and cloudy scarlet red. Thin bubbly white head. Lacing is quite full. Aroma is inviting. Fresh smells of yeast and baked bread and lavander. A little orange coriander too. Interesting concoction. They really stepped it up this year tipping the scales at 10.3% a/v. Mighty hefty for a Witbier. Mouhtfeel is a little syrupy and a bit alcoholic, though not overly so surprisingly. Overall impression is sweet and spicy and syrupy. Sticky sweet. Sugary sweet with cinnamon and pepper spicing. Body is full. This beer has a ""cough medicine"" feel to it, though it's not as bad as that sounds. This is just a little unbalance and maybe just a little TOO big for this style."
"Blech. Had higher hopes for this stuff. Bought a single at Goldstein's in Kingston PA. Poured into a hoegaarden glass (hey, it's a white, right?) First sniff, real boozy and not pleasant. Taste, very sweet but too boozy. Not a chugger. Very disappointed! Who knows though, it may have been skunked sitting in a singles shop."
"This beer pours with a golden yellow color and is a little bit cloudy. The smell is very floral. The taste is lighter than I expected, there is a lite hoppy taste, but you taste the alcohol. The mouthfeel is carbinated, you can feel the carbination if you leave the drink in your mouth. Overall, however, this is one of my favorite beers. I was very surprised how smooth and light it was based on the higher alcohol content."
"Mouthfeel: Velvety. The carbonation is there, but there is a heaviness to this beer that stands out. Very nice."
"D: A worthy effort, not a beer I would seek out but worth a shot."
"Poured a medium orange/amber color with a smaller sized off whtie head. Aromas of citrus (mainly oranges), coriander, some wheat, and caramel. Tastes of citrus (the same oranges), wheat, sugary sweet, and caramel. Sweet with some alcohol in the finish."
"Don't drink and review."
"D: I didn't even want to finish this one glass (but I did). Makes me happy I only bought a single and not a 4 pack."
"Drinkability: Good. Be careful, plenty of alcohol with this one. You will enjoy, but do not drink more than one or two in a session."
"This is a very good beer and one of Samuel Adams best. I highly recommend it. Seek it out."
"Overall this is a strange beer. I don't know if I would go out of my way to buy it again."
"Pours murky brown with a medium sized head. Aroma is very sweet with notes of caramel and light fruit, apples perhaps. Also just a bit of alcohol is noticeable in the nose. Taste is also very sweet again with some light fruit notes. Alcohol is noticeable in the finish. Full bodied and nicely carbonated. Not really a witbier at all- this is an unique and extreme beer. Definitely a sipper and not something I'd want to drink a lot of."
"The beer pours with a dark, hazy amber appearance. Lacing is really patchy and the head thins out way too fast. Aromas are wicked rich with vanilla, malts, very ripe orange. Tastes have a lightly complex, almost syrupy hint to them. Very sweet with a thin bitter aftertaste. Malts are heavy and overpower any citrus flavoring I could properly sense. Overall, an interesting drink from Sam Adams."
"No real carbonation to lighten things up. The syrupiness is unpleasant. This is pretty damn bad. I think its syrupy sugariness may have given me a cavity. On the plus side, it seems to be attracting butterflies and hummingbirds. Who unfortunately become insanely drunk from the overwhelming alcohol."
"I love SA's White Ale but this stuff is brutal..."
"-Dotson"
"This poured a hazy dark gold with white head. It smelled like lemon hops and creamy yeast with caramel malt and fresh wheat. It tasted like peach hops and sour but creamy yeast, with lots of caramel and barley malt, and a bit of orange. It was quite thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter/sour aftertaste. Overall this was actually pretty nice, which was surprising because I don't typically like witbiers that much. Perhaps my palate has just evolved? Either way, this beer had good flavor and huge body. It hid the alcohol well, and was very easy to drink. Fun and enjoyable, especially for a warmer day."
"D: For a 9% beer, it is somewhat drinkable. Not nearly as drinkable as a real wit. And not an improvement on the overall style."
"I was quite disappointed with this one. I don't think this is really a style meant to be imperialized."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, strong kick, decent representation of style it's a prime example of why certain types of beer shouldn't push the ABV too high. I thought an amped up version of Sam's White Ale would be pretty good but I was proven wrong."
"Overall, a drain pour. Avoid. One and so done. Enough with the imperial wits."
"Overall, this is a beer to try a time or two as a sipper, but not anything I would want to have often or more than one."
"If this was not my first beer of the night.. it would be a probably drain pour.. it is a real effort to choke it down.. just too much leftover sweetness to make this a winner... I doubt I will buy another bottle until I can confirm a new batch is out... I don't care for this one at all."
"D: I like this beer. But, would be way better suited for a mid-winter's night, with the snow falling, and the wind howling. I just got in from working in the yard, and, while it is only 55 outside, I'm having a real tough time getting thru this beer. If it was offered in the winter, I'd buy it. Not sure if this is what I want in spring."
"D: A nice attempt, but the few other Imperial Wits I have had have hid the alcohol much better, in this one it tends to dominate the drink, there's just not enough malt to hold back the 10.3%, but in the end it wasn't a hard beer to finish."
"Was a bit disappointed by this beer, didnt really taste any witbier characteristics and it was a little too alcoholic. Honesty tasted like a mediocre duvel"
"drinkability - I think it too strong for a wit. When I think of wit, I think og hot day in the spring or summer. Is kind a a strong, but I dug it."
"D: Surprisingly pretty easy drinking considering how un-Witbier-like this is. Pretty unnecessary."
"first i must say its like no witbier i have ever had but not to be taken in a bad way taste is more like a mild barleywine with that same warm alcohol taste. looks like unfiltered cider when poured with a short beige head and a nice sticky lace that holds past the finish. smells of fresh banana bread and mild hint of alcohol. very sweet and fruity taste with a lightly slick mouthfeel. drinkability, witbier no. something else, mild barleywire yes."
"Rather than an Imperial Witbier, this could easily be considered a Barleywine with a Witbier influence. Interesting nonetheless."
"D: I'd say that Sam Adams did about as good a job as could have been done. But that doesn't change the fact that there's no justification for this beer to have been created. Not every style needs to be embiggened, as Jebediah Springfield would say. As a witbier, it's not very good. But as a generic Belgian strong ale, it's pretty decent."
"Notes: The smooth feeling when it goes down struggles with balancing of the malts. It was filling and really for me it was a sugar bomb. Not something to look for in my opinion."
"The brew has fine carbonation, a fullish body, and imparts a little slickness as it passes through my mouth. Not a terrible drinker, but not at all quaffable, either. An ""interesting"" brew I'll call it, this big sipper of a Witbier, but ""interesting"" can mean just about anything, can't it?"
"Thin finish, not the creamy lingering sweetness I was looking for. As my 7th grade french teacher said ""bof"""
"Had this on tap at Carraba's at Perimeter in north Atlanta. Served in a chilled pilsner glass. Pours a generally yellow color with a minimal head. Smell is generally citrusy. Taste is citrus and bready. Taste is somewhat subdued. Moderate carbonation. I don't know if this was the best environment for this beer. The glass was chilled and the beer may have been served too cold. I tried to warm it, but even so, the beer was just ok."
"Verdict: Interesting beer, but just way too sweet for me. Wits are usually crisp, light and refreshing, and this is like drinking a 10% Orange Bang."
"Fantastic beer that is very wit-like in the nose, but the flavors scream Imperial."
"This is a great beer, thank you Jim Koch."
"Drinkability - Too sweet and boozy, not very drinkable, especially for a white. The alcohol isn't merely unmasked, it's prominent and overpowering."
"Good drinkability with respect to the alcohol."
"Hands down the best Witbier style beer I've had. What's wrong with extreme? It's beautiful."
"D - The alcohol is too strong to make this drinkable."
"The high ABV makes this somewhat of a sipper, but this is more than worthy. Thus far, it just may be my favorite from Sam's Imperial Series, and my favorite Witbier. It's a jacked-up, sensational offering. Very fine."
"Pours a medium brown with a tan head. Nice looking bale, but in no way resembles a witbier. Nose has wheat malts, citrus fruits, subtle hops, alcohol and herbs. The taste is also quite sweet with an unbalanced alohol presence and various summer spices. Medium body is poorly carbonated. Not a bad beer, just not my idea of a witbier. Still enjoyable. About what I expect from Sam Adams."
"Overall, a dissapointing attempt at an innovative style. Try making it a little smaller next time."
"Nothing in this beer says Witbier to me. It's hopefully one of the last ""MAKE THIS BITCH AS STRONG AS WE CAN"" beers. No wit, no nothing good."
"I've had DFH's Red & White and at 10% it is much better."
"I didn't know what to expect from an 'Imperial' wit. I thought the flavor was very balanced and smooth. Alcohol comes on a little hot, but I felt it brought out a nice counterpoint to the broad range of sweet fruit notes. Spice has a subtle, understated presence. Pretty good stuff."
"Drinkability: I am not really impressed with this beer. What is the point? Ordinary witbiers are both more interesting and more refreshing. This tastes like a not-so-good version of Chimay red. Disappointing."
"Bottled.. Twelve ounce. Dark orange colored ale, with a large, creamy white head. Nose is strange, very sweet, fruity, coconut, ginger-ale like, just awful. Flavor is sweet, strong & fruity, with out a lot of body or finesse. Just awful in every way."
"Above average for a wit, but a bit too much, sort of clouding what wits are all about, but then again, I have to get used to change. I'm sort of a closet fan of this beer."
"Not a great example of a witbier. The right smells and tastes are subtly there but they seem over processed and unrefined. The one positive in this brew is a nice smooth mouthfeel. Despite the syrupy feel it is cool and coats your mouth nicely, while masking the 9% ABV."
"D - A strong tasting beer and bold - I would recommend sampling with food. It seems a bit intense for my taste @ 10.3% to really be considered drinkable. I like it but this doesn't hide the alcohol well. Not an every day beer, perhaps shared or as a nightcap best suits this."
"Overall way to sweet and fruity, a little bit goes a long way."
"Cheers to SA for their Imperial series. They know the market and they certainly know beer!"
"I suppose i should not be surprised by some of the more negative reviews as for the most part they are from those who see the SA name and relegate it to the lower echelon of craft brews. This beer however is exactly what it claims to be. When I a imagine a imperial white, I expect all the great characteristcs of the true greats of the style, such as hoeggarden, amplified. That is what SA imperial white is, a fruity spice bomb with high alcohol, a wonderful mouthfeel and a winning finish. There are many SA creations i don't favor, but this one is a winner, if you are being honest in your review."
"Sam Adams should go back to the drawing board on this one, or maybe just leave this style as a crisper refreshing type beer. I'm definitely not impressed with this one, as the drinkability is so low from the alcohol."
"My first taste of this was at EBF 09, but seeing as I had already been to the 3F, Founders, DFH, and Lost Abbey tables I didnt think my initial reaction (disappointment) was accurate.. luckily (sort of, i guess) I found a single of it and got a second introduction. Smells faintly of oranges and bananas, nothing striking though not bad. Pours a dark orangish/amber color with a white head that dissipates quickly.. it basically resembles your average yuengling or such.. The taste is citrusy, the orange and coriander are certainly there but no where NEAR the presence they have in, say, DFH red&white.. Its fruity but a bit creamy as well, much more like a tripel than witbier, again: good not great. The mouth is surprisingly moderate and sort of thick. Its got a sweet presence in he mouth and the ABV is certainly there. Its better than your average finds and its certainly got a full flavor that isnt bad, but its not amazing."
"This is a very good beer. I thought it would be hard to brew an Imperial Wit that would still be enjoyable and drinkable, but this fits the bill and Sammy has done it well. Recommended."
"Drinkability: Its not bad. Whether or not its a wit is up for debate..Southhampton makes a double white that's better, I'd say. Goes down well though, and its worth trying."
"Overall an ok beer but I don't think I'll buy it again. Maybe if I see it on tap or something. I'll let the rest age and try one once a year."
"Pretty good overall, but the thickness is what would keep me from drinking more than 1 or 2 at a time."
"I drank this beer. Its' kind of orange-amber in color with a uniformly dense off-white. beige head. cloudy? Overcast. Smells kinda citrusy and spicy. It tastes like a Saison sort of. It's imperial, but it aint white. Full smooth body. It finishes a little yeasty with mild jolly rancher citrus fruit. It's not bad. But I wouldn't bother with it again."
"D- a wit on steroids. probably not one ill visit again. my least favorite of the new samuel adams imperial series by far."
"Aside from that- this is a well put together wheat beer. The overall impression is a mix of Sam Adams White and Leine's Sunset Wheat with an Imperial Flare. The ABV is noticeable but not intrusive. One I might have again-but the $ is a little bit high-certainly worth a try though."
"Samuel Adams has created yet another fine brew here. This is a heavily malt flavored concoction that is reminiscent of a farmhouse saison that I brewed last year. I definitely get the banana that some of the other reviewers have noted along with some coriander and citrus. Pours nice and packs a big punch. Definitely not a session beer! Way to go Sam Adams!"
"An imperial wit ought to be something like Celis's grand cru, very perfumy, strong, but light-bodied. This bastardization just doesn't work."
"Pours a cloudy orange, small head to it with a small amount of patchy lacing. Smell is very spicy, also very boozy. Tastewise, nice body to it.. the spiciness really comes through here. A VERY strong alcohol kick to it as well... this tastes stronger than a DFH 120 minute. Any typical witbier characteristics are just over-matched by the spiciness and mixed-drink type alcohol flavor. Kinda bummed about this one, there is no flavor detectable besides the ethanol... too bad."
"At 10.3% abv, this 'witbier' is a bulky mess. Nothing refined, rounded, or drinkable about this offering. A concoction that should be pulled from Sam's lineup."
"Glowing, pulpy, brassy-orange body. Little finger of whipped, creamy, beige head. Nice lacing. Nose shows off lots of tropical fruits, banana, banana rum, and yeast. Maybe a hint of spice in there as well. Toasted malts and banana puree up front. Tropical fruit sweetness follows, mixing with the banana flavors. Slight medicinal twang rides sidecar with these malts. Yeasty in the finish, along with subtle spices and orange/citrus zest. Full-bodied and thick, with an almost smoothie consistency. Warming, but not overly boozy for the abv. Not bad."
"This wit is too sweet for me and hard to really get into."
"This beer smacks you pretty hard in the nose and the palate. Sam Imperial White tried to do too much too fast. I found that it was almost offensively strong and full of flavors that did not blend well with me. Therefore I found it suffered on drinkability. Yet despite this, the flavors had a pleasant aftertaste. Upon finishing the bottle I felt very full, however, whether mentally or stomachally, nonetheless left me feeling a bit ""too much""."
"This beer would be alot better if they toned down the alcohol and corriander. It might get better with age same as the double bock."
"Overall, I am glad I tried this. I will not buy it again, but I still look forward to their other imperial series beers."
"Drinkability: Not for me. Too much of an alcohol taste to be considered a favorite. Very much a high abv version of their white ale. If you like the white ale, you should like this."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Foamy, slick, and just a wee bit aggressive... it works for this beer. The swallow is good, never letting down with regard to the smoother carbonation. This beer makes its presence felt for sure, and it will sock you if you're not careful. Not a winner in BBC's stellar lineup in my opinion."
"12 ounce bottle, w/o freshness info to be had. 10.3% advertised on the label. Pours cloudy, darker peach amber, off white head, tiny bubble thin head, then film and leaves nice fine and extensive lacing. The nose on this one is of lime, alcohol, sweet malts. I got notes of gin, lime, fruity/yeasty goodness. Unfortunately this one is a bit on the ""hot"" side, taking away from the taste enjoyability and ultimately drinkability as well. This one needs some work"
"12oz bottle purchased at The Liquor Shop in Tyngsborro, Mass. Pours a hazy but clear red-amber with a short lived inch of off-white head that leaves some good lacing. Banana, clove, nut, spice all characterize the aroma, more reminiscent of a hefeweizen than a witbier really. Fruity sweet at first, with banana, nut, clove, pith, and a touch of citrus and some alcohol warming at the finish. Rich full body with moderate carbonation. A tasty smooth beer this is - a witbier or any sort of amped-up witbier this is not. Reminds me of a spiced hefeweizen. I like it though, and it's way better than Samuel Adams White, and one of Samuel Adams' better beers IMO. Not reviewing this for the style."
"M/D: Full bodied, light carbonation. Good drinkability. A very tasty beer. The only real drawback I can find is that the taste is a little off balance from a big sweetness to a little bit too much bitterness in the finish. However, I still really like this beer overall."
"D: Ehhh. This beer sort of reminds me of a Hoegaarden Grand Cru, trying to turn up everything in a witbier to ""11", but the alcohol is just a little too out of control for me. The beer starts off like a nice flavorful wit, but then the alcohol dominates the finish."
"Drinkability: This is one high alcohol beer I could have a few of. The flavors arent too crazy and the booze is well hidden. I dont think I would ever buy it again though. But I admire Sam Adams for there adventurous spirit. You would never see the bud or miller do something like this even though they could easily afford too. Thumbs up to Sam Adams for serving something only a select few will buy."
"12oz bottle into a Tulip glass at Flying Saucer, pours a nice crisp dark orange with a decent frothy head that diminishes to a thin layer. Aroma is some sweet malts and spice. The taste is a nice abundance of sweet fruit, coriander and yeast, very true to style. The beer is certainly a heavy sipper, but an enjoyable one. This is certainly a good beer for the style, one I'd certainly try again if the mood hits."
"So I picked this up the other day expecting the same from sam adams which to me is a very well crafted beer and I wasn't dissapointed. Poured a nice hazy orange and smelled like citrus. Taste was, to me, was in one word balanced. Nothing overtook another but you could taste it all. The malts and citrus and the nice alcohol buzz to it. Only knock I have on it is as it warmed it got a little too sweet but nothing undrinkable. Thumbs up to sam adams on another great beer."
"Pours a deep cloudy orange with a thin whispy white head. Great lacing and small legs around the glass. The smell is wheat and orange with a hint of coriander. Some alcohol present in the smell. The taste is mostly wheat and orange. Not much of a coriander in there but a little. The alcohol is too much for this one. Making a witbier stronger, atleast in this case, does nothing for the beer. The alcohol takes over and the mouthfeel is oily from it. I would say the drinkability is low and this one could use a year or two in the cellar but I think that would only mellow the hotness and would probably not do much to the flavor of the beer."
"D: Very strong, took me a long time to drink and fully enjoy it. Definitely a big brew."
"D: Its an Imperial all right. This is not your summer-fun wit - more like one and done."
"Drinkability: This one's interesting. It's a good stab at a style that's hard to get right - the traditional witbier notes tend not to hide higher abv%s too well, so ""imperial"" renditions of it often fall flat. This one's even hotter than most, and though the array of flavors and notes it presents are nice, they're a) not very witbier-esque, IMO (more a Belgian Strong Pale) and b) don't do much to cover up the alcohol. That being said, this one's worth trying once. Hopefully, the SA Imperial Series will evolve in time as Koch gets more exposure to higher abv% brews."
"D= I was really challenged by this beer at first, but as I got to know it I liked it more and more. On the surface, its way darker than one should ever expect a ""white"" ale to be. It is also a bit sweet and heavier than you would expect, but that is the nature of ""Imperial"" I guess. Ultimately, this beer needs to sit in the glass for 10-15 minutes before drinking and in my opinion at that time it is an enjoyable sipper. I couldn't do more than two of these in a night though."
"This might be the most visually attractive beer I've ever had. Served in a pilsner glass, the beer was a hazy red/orange color with a thick white head and plenty of lacing. Spicy orange aroma, like those Christmas ornaments stuck with cloves. Mostly citrus (orange) taste, faint spice, and malt. But way too sweet! Cloyingly sweet. One and done."
"Pours a cloudy honey/orange with a large frothy head. The smell is light with spices,bread yeast,and alcohol. The taste has alot of spices with pepper,alcohol,lemon,citrus flavors,bitter hops,and honey. The m/f is heavy with all the flavors mixing OK,but this type of beer is abit tough to drink. Not a bad beer,but just not my type."
"My expectations where met."
"Flavor is pretty strong, not very subtle. But it's very tasty. The first thing I noticed actually was the incredible mouthfeel. I literally felt my jaw drop under the weight of the beer. The bottle claims this beer has a huge mouthfeel, and that's not a lie. Remarkable. Flavor was citrusy, but not in a hoppy way. Very sweet and syrupy and warming as hell. Almost cloying. Contrary to what's above, my beer was marked at 10.3% abv. You can taste the alcohol, but it's pretty damn easy to drink despite that. I enjoyed this beer, though it needs more yeastiness to balance things out. But maybe subtlety was not what they were going for with this brazen brew."
"Drinkability: this is a true slow sipping beer. One in a session is all you will consume. If you want a boozy beer, this will do."
"Overall, one of my least favorite Sam Adams. Much disappointed, since I liked the Imperial Series Stout a lot."
"Not bad I guess. It has a lot of the characters of a wit (some lemon and spice), but this could probably be considered a tripel or something rather than an Imperial White ale. Too sweet and alcoholic for my tastes."
"Drinkability takes a hit because of the flavor. It's just wierd."
"Drinkability: For an Imperial White over 10%, I think many people may not realize how hard it is to make something with this much quality. This is an awesome sipper, and I like it for the winter more than summer. For the Hoegaarden fans, you're probably not going to like this. But I give Sam Adams props. I only got one bottle, but I may go back and get 4-pack after all. If you like the style, and like the bigger versions -- and there don't seem to many readily available -- you should definitely try it."
"D- This really is an Imperial. It's very thick and heavy. You can't drink these like a regular witbier. A solid brew but one's enough for me."
"Overall impression: Interesting beer, its got a lot of the traditional flavors but richer and heavier. Drinkable, but the alcohol warming does get a bit much as it goes on."
"D: the flavor makes it easy to drink, but the warming as it goes down could slow you...i think one or two of these is more than enough"
"Pours an orange yellow with decent initial head..good lacing. This bottle indicates 10.3 abv and it expresses itself in this manner. COuld this be classified as a wheat wine? Smell is barleywine-like with deep elements and a distinct alcohol presence. In the taste area malt, corainder, floral, almost roselike qualityies come through in a thick blend that includes a distinct alcohol presence. Like many strong brews, the subleties become more appaent upon warming. Mouthfeel is warming, slightly viscuous, very substantial. Definitely a sipper, drinkability beacomes better upon warming."
"Sam Adams Imperial White is a nice beer that is definitely worth trying, as I have never had anything quite like it. It has a nice appearance and aroma and a very interesting taste. The drinkability, however, is not that great. This is a nice beer to buy a 4-pack and split with three buddies because it has a nice taste and is definitely worth trying. Because of the harsh alcohol burn in the beer, though, it would be hard to have more than one or two of these."
"Overall, I'll have to get a couple more and see what some cellar time will do."
"Starts off smooth and alcohol oily. The flavors of wheat are muted. In fact, the most distinctive aspect is sour, citrus flavor. The aftertaste is all alcohol. Overall, not my cup of tea (or beer that is)."
"Served in my Weihenstephaner glass. Poured a hazy orange with gold highlights around the edges when backlit. Quarter inch white head was embedded with tiny bubbles. Some strands of lacing were revealed on the tilt side of the glass. Nose was yeast, corriander, orange peel, bubblegum and bananna esters. Taste consistent with nose, but maltier than anticipated, as well as some booziness. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and lively with some slickness. In terms of drinkability, I've never had an imperial white. It was a decent brew and flavorful; however, not as refreshing as your typical witbier."
"D: Pretty drinkable, if the alcohol was masked more it would be a bit better, but overall this was something I never expected from Sam Adams, and I am glad they did this beer."
"A wit should be more crisp. I understand this is a really big wit but it sort of misses the point. I wanted big flavor, lots of spice and citrus. This comes across too heavy and thick. Not enjoyable and not worth seeking out."
"D - a nice treat, but not for sessioning."
"I'm glad I picked up just one. Samuel Adams I think your great for giving other styles a try, even if each beer dont get rave reviews I respect that. I really wanted one of the other Imperial Series but this is all they had."
"Overall a unique and nice addition to the Sam family."
"D - To put ""imperial"" and ""witbier"" in the same sentence seems a bit paradoxical, but Sam Adams has managed to make such a thing quite drinkable. The noticable alcohol gets a little annoying after a bit but the rich flavors more than compensate. Probably not the crisp, refreshing beverage one will reach for after a day outside, but definitely a beer worth tasting and exploring."
"It's a drinkable brew. Not your typical belgian wheat by any means. It's better then I was expecting it to be. It's worth trying, and if you don't like it at first you may find yourself enjoying it more and more as you continue to drink it."
"D- A surprisingly solid beer that doesn't really drink like it's 10.3%. Just as soon as I get used to and bored with Samuel Adams, something like this comes along. Try it."
"Regardless, this beer is worth a try at least once. I suggest buying 1 bottle instead of a full 4 pack to see if you like it or not."
"Overall just not that great, sort of feel like i got gypped here."
"Drinkability is moderate. The flavor profile isn't as intense as I would have liked, which leads to a bit of difficulty in the ease of consumption because of the strong alcohol presence. It's not bad, but chalk up another disappointment for Boston Beer Co. for me."
"Overall - A unique entry into the world of Witbiers. If Blue Moon is for the wheat neophyte, this one's for the witbier aficionado looking for a challenge. I'm probably going to cellar the rest of the bottles that i have...well, after I go lie down for a bit."
"D: This beer was actually much sweeter then I expected and I am going to let two of them mature for a while before I try them again. This is a Witbier and I did not grasp much of the Witbier in it. I would have liked to see more taste of coriander in the beer but overall a decent beer."
"(D) Drink it slow, and it will grow on you."
"D - Not the best double-white I've had, but it's easy enough to drink. The alcohol is fairly obvious on the palate, but it doesn't creep up on you very much."
"Not something I could really see seeking out often, this was an interesting beer to mix into their new imperial series but it lacks the character and dimension of a great beer."
"Cheers..."
"Lots of alcohol flavor that just isn't balanced out for a style like this. Certainly different, but not very refreshing. Probably won't seek this out again."
"Truly a unique beer...like nothing i have ever had. Awesome addition for Sam Adams....a real redeemer for not making the coffee stout."
"As I got to know this beer more, I decided it was much more drinkable than I originally thought. It has a ton of flavor, but isn't excess in its impact on the pallate and gut. I've let it sit a bit and open up, and it still retains its initial enjoyment on each pull. I think it would be a knockout with hot chinese orange chicken."
"For a fan of the imperial heavy-hitters, I'd say give it a shot because its still an interesting brew. However dont expect to chug it down like a Hoegarden or you might get yourself in trouble."
"D: At 10.3% I would almost call this more of a wheatwine hybrid. It is boozy. I am enjoying it but the point of a wit is to sit on a hot day and have a few. Maybe they should market this as a winter wit."
"Imperial White's an intriguing beer. It's not bad, but it's far from great. The biggest problem is the alcohol. It's far too prevalent and too hot. If that could be worked out, it'd be dramatically improved. Perhaps the alcohol just needs to be 2% lower. It needs some work to say the least. But, it's definitely worth checking out."
"I grabbed a four back of this upon seeing it in the Beer Store beer cooler. I poured a bottle into a tulip glass. Maybe not the right glass, but I like that glass. The appearance is a dark orange and very cloudy. An aggressive pour leaves a half inch head that settle quickly, leaving a ring and some light foam behind. Some light lacing after the first sip. Smells wheaty and spicy with a noticable citrus aroma. Kind of a mild aroma, but well balanced. The taste starts out somewhat sweet, but the spicyness follows quickly, fading to a bitterness. Kind of a tangy bite to it. A very good tasting beer. Medium body and slightly sticky. Mild carbonation. This is real easy to drink. Kind of hard to believe this is 9%. I don't sense it at all. Overall this is a real nice beer that I'm sure I'll buy again."
"D - I'm not really a fan of witbiers. This is only the third that I've had I believe. It's much better than SA White Ale, but I find this a tad on the spicy side."
"I was looking forward to checking this out because while I love the Double Bock, I've always been a little underwhelmed by the many of the other offerings. This did not disappoint. Will have again soon."
"First impression: This doesn't hide the alcohol too well. Every sip is big and boozey. Big malt tastes with some dried fruit. A little bit of hops, in line with the rest of SA's beers. It also has a very medicinal cloying sense to it. The spicing isn't so detectable in the flavor as in the nose. Mouthfeel is big and coating, but the medicinal part of the coating detracts from it. A little too boozey to be anything more than a slow sipper right now, but this will make an interesting candidate for aging."
"Altogether, a very nice beer that is only limited in drinkability by its very stout ABV."
"This beer was a bit of a surprise. I was second among the friends that tried it and my friends first tasting of it was of dissatisfaction. I greatly liked the beer and i will be picking up a four pack and will update my review when I have more of this good beer."
