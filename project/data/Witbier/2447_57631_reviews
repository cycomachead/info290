"Tastes fairly bland, citrus is absent in the taste as well. Astringent and thin bodied, supple at the end. Wheaty, simple, sort of quenching but not very exciting. With a name like citrus avenue, it's a crime to have this little citrus flavor."
"Good beer that has a nice orange hint to it. It's subtle"

"Poured from the bottle and loved this beer. As a Witbier style it was well executed with a fair amount of alcohol. Somewhat creamy notes of coriander and spice are tasted but most prevalent was the orange flavor. When drinking this beer with a friend we joked of it tasting like orange juice. And that's not a bad thing in my opinion. I don't recall the age of the beer but it was certainly delicious. Bold flavor paired with an excellent execution makes a very good beer. Highly recommended."
"I think this is probably one of the very best Wit's I've had, and I've had a lot of them.  This is a textbook perfect example of the style and I would be proud if I were to have brewed this.  A delicious beer.  Highly highly recommended.  Exceptional."

"Did not like this one at all."

"Required outlier review: easy to drink but needs more orange"
"Tastes just like it sounds...orange wheat. For a local San Diego brew, you can't go wrong.  It's crisp and refreshing with a definite orange flavour.  Worth a try!"

"Bought a six pack that was on sale, and was glad I did.  Poured from a bottle, this beer was light in color but quite cloudy.  Small head, which diminished almost immediately.  On the first sip the spicy - citrusy flavors come thru in a mild way. The finish has a strong lime taste that is clean and refreshing.  A easy drinking beer with some complexity."

"Wit fans won't like this one.  I hate wits.  More like a light hef, with some mild citrus notes.  This is a spring or summer by the pool beer.  Softer than an IPA, but brighter than a Hef.  Very enjoyable, but not strong example of the style.  A great alternative to an IPA or Cerveca after surfing."

"Overall: There are a lot of beers that are refreshing on a hot day. This does that, and also has some complexity in the taste."

"I was anxious to try this as a fan of the style and a recent resident of San Diego County. It pours a nice orange, but the head is not impressive and quickly dissipates. The aroma is a bit weak with mostly honey and faint hints of citrus. The taste follows the aroma, but I think the honey sweetness is a bit overpowering. Overall the beer is not bad, but not great; however, I would drink it again. Despite an underwhelming taste, it was quite refreshing."

"As an ""Wit"" I was expect a light color and a citrus crispness. What I got was a hoppy amber beer. The hop feel sat on my tongue like an IPA. There was zero citrus crispness. As such, it was not to style in the least bit. Instead I would judge this beer as an amber ale. In which case I would rate it slightly higher but it would still be ""unremarkable"""
"A let down. The description sounded great but the beer just wasn't that great."
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass; no bottle dating but was recently released in the state. Pours very hazy/cloudy golden orange color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of orange peel, lemon zest, pear, light banana, wheat, biscuit, honey, coriander, light clove, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of bready/honey malt, spice, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of orange peel, lemon zest, pear, light banana, wheat, biscuit, honey, coriander, light clove, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of orange peel, lemon zest, pear, light banana, wheat, biscuit, honey, coriander, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance and robustness of spice, yeast ester, and bready/honey malt sweetness; with decent complexity and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with smooth, moderately creamy, and slightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a good witbier. Good robustness and balance of yeast ester, spices, and bready/honey malt sweetness; and very smooth to drink. A pleasant and enjoyable offering."

"First impression is that this another macro beer--thin body and lightly flavored. I note some wheat and hop in the swallow. Very short aftertaste. Easy to drink but void of any interest."
""
"D: I am a Coronado fan as most of the offerings that they put out are solid but this one is a big miss for me. I can appreciate the need for a nice refreshing light Belgian Wit in your lineup but at least make it something special. This is just plain drab. Shock Top says hello."
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while. It’s very similar to Blue Moon but done WAY better."
"Overall: a good witbier. It is good to see these newbies here in Boston as I look forward to trying out more of their styles of beers. Good stiff so far."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a fairly solid and pleasant witbier."
""
""
""
""
""
"Fizzy, quickly dissipating cap. Very hazy, amber/orange color. Aromas of wheat grain and earthy citrus rind, oranges, a bit spicy. Medium bodied with lowish carbonation, felt a little dull. Low bitterness with more wheat, orange, and spicy character. Decent overall. I liked the orange aroma, but it didn't carry through as well into the flavour."
""
"Something about the whole experience feels thin to me. The flavor doesn't round it to be all that satisfying to me and is a bit underwhelming. The added spices also throw the balance a little too far in that direction. Has that flavored soda feel for some reason."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On the positive side, it brought a different blend of flavors, though something was missing, probably this would have worked better on a hoppier wheat beer."
""
""
""
"This beer is unusually thick, its medium body quite big for a Wit. It still has a certain softness, though. It's brightly crisp all the way through. I want to score it higher but for slightly too much of a syrupy/sticky thing going on and only a moderate smoothness."
""
""
""

"Overall - easy session beer for summer/fall. Good one for the crossover crowd as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I like all of the aspects of this beer with the exception of the herbal hop/medicinal flavor that lingers a bit in the finish. Otherwise a middle of the road witbier, pretty easy to drink with well hidden alcohol but not really interesting enough for me to get again."
""
""
""
"Overall a tasty wit."
""
"O - Just a solid wheat beer with some strong citrus notes. Better to have orange in your beer this way than what Blue Moon does."
""
""

"A good witbier, a bit pronounced on the orange note but very good."

"A sort of middle-range witbier, one tempered by a straight-up citrus fruit and sweetness, but lacking the edgy yeast and grain characters necessary to provide the expected balance. Of course, this offering somehow finds its way around that particular dichotomy, one which I'm still trying to figure out. So, if you take one thing from all of this, it should be: orange, and all the things that rhyme with it (man, I just can't get away from the 90's alt-rock references tonight. Oh well)."
""
""
""
"Overall good wheat beer, not much orange taste."
""
""
"O - I'd like to say I enjoyed it more, but it was just alright for me. I wouldn't like to have it very often, but if it was paired up with dinner at someones house I wouldn't be disappointed. Just OK"
"Overall - Nothing special here, very bland and forgetable. Lacks flavor, balance and overal fruity flavors that most of this wits have. Nothing worth drinking again."
""
""
"Overall: this is a pretty good witbier. The addition of the orange doesn't detract from the wheat, as the wheat seems to have been 'turned up' to compensate. Also the non-artificial nature of the orange really impresses."
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Pours a murky orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and some citrus-like aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable but not all that exciting."
""
""
""
"add some complexity, particularly in the aftertaste and this could be special"
""
"O - A very disappointing effort for a wheat beer and pretty much tasteless. Never again."
""
"O - An average brew. I like beers with more flavor however. I could see this being refreshing on a hot summer day on the beach however"
"Doesn't exactly hit the mark for a witbier..."
"Overall, this is a mediocre wit and could definitely be improved on."
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a very dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of oranges, some wheat. Taste is orange peel, wheat, a bit on the tart side. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a refreshing and easy drinking beer."
""
"Overall I felt this beer was somewhat over carbonated, but it was refreshing for a nice summers day."
"This beer pours a clear yellow with a thin head and no lace. It's aroma is of fresh baked bread and mild citrus. The flavor leads with bread with honey and mild malt sweetness with very faint orange in the finish. The mouthfeel is light. Coronado Orange Wit is a refreshing, decent beer, recommended."

"O- I was not expecting a beer this bad. This is unfortunate."
"O- Interesting how they got it to taste so fruity, but it misses the mark. Ends up tasting similar to Leinie's Sunset Wheat."
""

""
"Cheers!"

"Being a light, wit this would be suitable for a nice summery day. Since it is snowing outside, it's pretty wrong for today. The orange taste is buried. Based on this beer, I will avoid this brewery."
""
""
"The beer poured out as a lightly hazed yellowish gold color with a thin white head on top that didn't do too much besides disappear. The smell of the beer is sweet with orange aromas, sadly the orange aromas are more like orange soda. It's a little too sweet I think on the nose. The taste kind of jumps in the same direction which hinders my thoughts. I felt that the mouthfeel was also a little too thin as well. It seemed flat to me, very little if any carbonation here. Overall I wasn't impressed too much and I probably wouldn't have this one again."
""
""
"Pours like a standard wit, yellow and hazy. Aroma is full of orange citrus and wheat malt. In the taste, semi sweet wheat and orange flavors playing off each other, and a restrained hoppy bitterness with dry orange peel. A nice mix of flavors, wheat, orange, and finishes mildly bitter. Medium bodied and crisp. Overall, a pretty decent wit, went well with curry."
"Overall: for what it is, it is very good. The orange is subtle but present enough to have a nice sweet finish which makes this one of the better tasting wits I have had."
"Pours a pale filtered wheat, bright fluffy white head. Aroma has orange peel hints of honey and spices with coriander and chammomile. Flavor semi sweet spicy flavor with honey and orange peel in the background of this witbier. Mouthfeel is dry semi sweet with a light to medium bodied spices really coat the palate, drinkable for sure especially in warmer weather."
"D: A very nice Wit... it is a little strong on the citrus side with less spice and pepper than I'm used to having.. But with a great ABV like this you can have a few... Great on a hot day."
"My glass of this beer disappears really fast, but it really wasn’t all that memorable. This is not the most complex Wit, but it is easy"
"Overall- nice summer ale that will satisfy any craft beer drinker"
"Pours a cloudy amber orange color, served with orange slice (that is not needed). Tastes like wheat, yeast and some fruit flavors (mostly orange and spice), but also some hop presence. Aftertaste is a tangy hoppy flavor, almost bitter. It’s definitely drinkable and tastes pretty good, but I wouldn’t go out of my way to get it."
"Poured out of a tap into a pint glass. Color was golden orange and there was just a light film of head. Smelled a hint of orange and sweet but not that much after. I actually sucked some of the beer into my nostils looking for a smell. Tasted like oranges, specifically orange peels. Mild carbonation. Good after taste, though. Great for a summer beer."
"Medium-bodied with a tart effervescence up front. Aftertaste has a bit more malt presence with a faint warming on the palate. Overall, a decent brew but nothing special."
"An interesting wit. Orange is in the nose. But there is also a strange baby aspiring smell as well. The appearance was a touch dark for a wit. More like a heffe. The taste is very good though. Mouthfeel is very lively. Overall, I like it more than most wits. The orange notes sweeten the taste a little and give it a tiny bit of fruityiness that makes the beer distinctive."
"D - Not bad, it is well balanced and moderately flavorful, which puts it firmly in the better than average category for witbier. The orange is there somewhere in the background, but not as prominent as I might have expected from the description on the bottle, though a more powerful orange character would have probably done the beer more harm than good."
"Value: Same price as Blue Moon??? Yes please."
"Bleached white head of close to two fingers, delicate and close to wispy, dissolves rapidly down to the surface, forms a thin sheet along the glass walls, almost reminds you of chain mail armor, credible stickiness given its thinness. Dark yellow to a shade before orange in the glass, would likely be clearer were it not for the spice particulate floating around, plenty of bubbles, larger and with good vigor. The nose on the whole is quiet so it does not take much for the orange zest to take a leading position, there's a sweet spice presence as well as a pinch of pepper however both fade into the fabric, the wheat notes stick in your mind via power of suggestion, turns more floral as it warms, decent peach to apricot fruit as well, the malts likewise folded into the whole. Medium-bodied, the carbonation gives it good posture and increases overall mouth presence, Firmness tends to carry it beyond simple quaffing wit, this may be for the better or worse depending on your expectations. The orange infusion does well in not overplaying its hand, same for the coriander, anise seed type spices. The honey too brings needed sweetness but within a thought out framework. The malts tastes like malt as in malted milk balls. More quinine than wheat, grain or yeast flavors, not herbaceously bitter. Ultimately, not intellectually interesting, however, no problem throwing a few back if ice cold on a hot summery day."
"O- Overall, this is a decent Wit but nothing I would purchase again."
"Decent, but not outstanding beer."
"O - This would make good beach beer, and probably would work well at the ballpark too. I am enjoying it for what it is: easy drinking beer for people with a soft (or no) palate."
"Overall: Just wasn't impressed in any one aspect of this beer except for the smell, but I can't live off of the smell alone. It's just too plain and uninspiring for me to try again. Tick this one off of the beer list....but that's about all it was good for."
"D- Nothing above average here at all. But there's nothing offensive at all. It is quite easy to drink but I'm not going to go out of the way to seek this."
"Nice seasonal whit, nothing crazy but nothing to turn down either."
"Overall, I found the Orange Avenue Wit very, very easy to drink and extremely refreshing (to the point where I'm probably going to be picking up a four- or six-pack sometime soon). It easily held onto that line between medicinal and quaffable that I mentioned before, being deliciously sweet and yet still managing to deliver a soft kick in the mouth thanks to all of the tangy citrus combined with the heavier wheat. This is very much a summer beer, though it is just as fantastic in the winter, helping bring back that warmth that everybody longs for during the coldest months of the year."
"Reviewed on 2/3/2010. Bottle thanks to daknole. Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with a small white head. Aroma of skunk, citrus, orange, wheaty malt. Flavor of light citrus/orange fruit and grainy, pale malts (a touch of stale malt too). Kind of has an orange creamsicle quality to it. Took me a little bit, but ended up rather enjoying it!"
"d - A pretty good witbier. While not my favorite style, it had a lot or orange and citrus hops which were enjoyable. It kind of reminded me of a better Blue Moon. My girlfriend loved the beer. I probably wouldn't look to order it again but my girlfriend certainly would. If you like witbiers worth checking out."
"Pours a clean yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, orange juice, with a wheat note note and spices. In the taste, dry wheat notes and a small spice, like pepper, with a orange juice like citrus flavor. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with dry wheat hints. OJ stands out, nice wheat notes and dry spice."
"Drinkability: Overall, a very nice wit that would be even better if it weren't for that medicinal tang"
"D - Overall I didn't fall in love with the beer but was glad to try something new. It had the flavor and even seemed to balance the higher ABV since most Witbier's I had are around 4.4 - 4.9 it worked rather well. I may just try more from this brewery very good brew."
"Pours a hazy light orange with a small friendly white head, which falls away far too quickly. The aroma is tangy and spicy, with light clove, orange zest, and a hop zing. The flavor is orangy and spicy, with clove and allspice, and there is a good hop bitterness on the back end, but in between there is a watery thinness. This is the sweet spot that cries out for a little more something in this beer. The mouthfeel is a little prickly."
"While the aromas and flavors were about averagefor the style, this one comes through with good marks on drinkability, nonetheless."
"D - A nice wit, with more citrus and a bit less spice then most versions. I found this to be enjoyable with a very reasonable ABV"
"This is a wheat beer that would compliment a meal becuase of the mellow spices."
"This is a good representation of the Witbier."
"Pours a hazy gold color with a thin eggshell head that retains OK. The aroma has some spices upfront (corriander, clove, orange peel) along with a little biscuit, bandaid, wax and some fruitiness. The flavor is similar to the aroma with spices upfront, along with a little hay, some orange and lemon, wax, bandaid and funk and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is light and drinkability is OK. This is a decent wit but it's astringent and has a weird bandaid flavor/aroma that is offputting."
"D. A nice refreshing, thirst quenching beer."
"The ingredients altogether taste natural and fresh, carried refreshingly, sip after sip, with a touch of sparkling carbonation."
"D: A well made, solidly drinkable beer."
"Overall a very quaffable beer. A nice west-coast adaptation of a classic Belgian style, though I might have called it ""wheat"" rather than ""wit," as color and spice profile are significantly different from witbier. I would recommend giving it a try."
"F: Some bitterness, mostly orange peel and spices for the bitterness, with lingering, yep, orange peel and spices. Some wheat flavors, tangy orange lingering, coriander and spices lingering too. Weird bitterness just lingers, like I just bit on an orange peel."
"Overall: Overall, it was a good beer with a nice balance of citrus and sweetness. It's not really my type of beer, but for its style, it was enjoyable. A good change of pace, though."
"D-Overall a good brew, unique and one of a kind. this would be a good summer beer."
"D - This was the perfect beer to start the day with light and refreshing with a good taste makeing this an easy drinking beer worth trying"
