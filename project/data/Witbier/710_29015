4.81,43.2,3.5,5,5,5,4.5,"This is brewed by a small family-owned and operated brewery in Wisconsin.  They are very creative and have several varieties of which as stated before this is my fav.  It pours out a very light golden color not very cloudy with a hint of citrus in its smell.  It's got a soft, fruity taste.  It's not too heavy so you can drink it while you're grilling some carne asada on the deck, but it's also good to curl up with while you're listening to some blues.","PhilHeinricke","Jan 16, 2015"

But it was really an interesting brew, with the strong blueberry flavor. It's main strength is also it's main weakness though...I wish the blueberry was a little more subtle. Still a good choice, and I could see myself picking up a 6-pack again, maybe next summer.","mchegash","Jan 07, 2015"

It's easy drinking and very sessionable.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Oct 21, 2014"

3.75,11.6,,,,,,"Pours a hazy golden-amber in color with a good 1+-finger creamy/foamy white head that settles down to around 2-3mm that lasts the whole drink. Decent sheets of lacing is seen that slips back down the sides of the glass except a few small areas that stick. The aroma is of grains and some citrus zest with a hint of spice. The taste starts out sweet with a slight bitter lemon/orange zest but finishes decent and doesn't last. Seems to be a hint of pine in the mix also. Lighter+ bodied with average carbonation. Overall, it was decent and drinkable.","BeerWithMike","Oct 18, 2014"

Artificial tasting and slightly gimmicky? You could definitely say that. Off-putting? Not quite. My family is quite the fan of Leinenkugel's offerings (as well as some beers I shan't name) and I can always find refuge in Sunset Wheat when the beers start flowing at family BBQs.","ThePaintedGrey","Jun 27, 2014"

Sunset Wheat pours a cloudy orange color. Mine had about a half-finger of head that faded quickly leaving some nice lacing. The smell is only so-so, but the taste is fine, with citrus notes right up front and a kind of 'sharp' quality to it. The mouth feel is lightly carbonated. True to the style, there is only a slight bitterness to the finish. Overall, I find it to be a refreshing brew, and probably a good session beer, though for me a 'session' is usually one. IPA lovers will probably hate it, but for those of us who are not fans of high IBU's, this one will do the job.","ccoyle","Feb 01, 2014"

This beer pairs well with just about everything, even chocolate. It's too bad they don't make scratch and sniff stickers for this beer, because I would buy them! This is the kind of beer, if you like wheat beer, to buy and drink a six pack in one sitting. Not a disappointment.","Keystone_Beer_Wench","Nov 03, 2013"

My friends and I used to go to the store and pick up a few six packs of Sunset Wheat and play video games all night. Those were the days. Upon revisiting, I'm definitely not nearly as infatuated with this brew as I once was, but it's not a bad beer at all.

Aromas of fruitcake, with a lemony highlight and a slight roasting. Flavors are sharp, with an effervescence that almost obliterates the flavors. The fruit sweetness is short-lived, and there is a tangy floral end flavor that really sours the palate. The aftertaste is watered down, with a touch of floral dashed in there. Bleh, it's turning into a bit of a mess now. Filmy, cloying finish. Not good.","GarthDanielson","Aug 31, 2012"

For me, it's a little too indistinct to be a regular summer choice.","TheRealBigC","Aug 20, 2012"
4.39,30.7,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Currently my favorite beer. About a year ago I went to Buffalo Wild Wings where I was introduced to this it. Instead of ordering my usual glass of Hefe I asked the bartender to give me something different. He gave me this and immediately I tasted fruity pebbles cereal and fell in love. Needless to say I was feeling so good when it was time to leave, i forgot to ask what the name of the beer was. After a few more attempts and the same results, I finally asked the name BEFORE I asked for the ""fruity pebbles"" beer. They told me and I've been buying it ever since....I love this beer!","ThirstinHowell","Aug 20, 2012"

This beer, in its thinness and weird, artificial tang bears no resemblance to a typical Weizen. I tried to get used to it with a gamey sense of experiment, but the sense that I was drinking unpleasant chemicals in the name of beer actually got more offensive as I persisted.","heine1","Aug 01, 2012"

Aromas are sweet and odd hinting wheat, orange Tang, cherry, and blueberry. Tastes are complex, but are also odd, especially for the style: fruity yeast reminiscent of a canned fruit cup, orange zest, lemon, grass, wheat, blueberry, and maybe a hint of agave, not much for spiciness as you would expect for the style. Mouth-feel is thin for a wheat ale, but not terribly thin. Plenty of carbonation and finishes on the palate tangy and tingly. Overall, this was weird for me. Blueberry, orange Tang, fruit cup? It kept me thinking about it as I drank it, but that's about it. I guess I'd take it over a macro-lager, but it's not much better than that.","barnzy78","Jun 23, 2012"

Spritzey carbonation and thin body, its obvious that they are going for the lawnmower market. If only it didn't have such an unappetizing appearance and wasn't so cloyingly sweet, I would get along with this one a lot better than I have.

4.59,36.6,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I used to carry this on tap when I bartended in Florida. I am not always a fan of the wheats, be they Heffes, American Wheats or Belgian White styles....but this on draft was amazing. It is a beautiful yellow color pouring into a pint and the heady smell of freshly made blueberry waffles fills the entire bar. Nope, I'm not kidding. Many patrons asked what it was I was making in the back of the pub...then I'd throw them a taster of this. It is perfect for summer though it isn't overly, overly sweet. I still found it incredibly refreshing and lacking in the typical skunk of the wheat brews. While it loses it's preciousness aroma-wise in bottle, the taste remained pretty true. Totally dig!","Windigo","Nov 28, 2011"

ThaBobfather is right, it does taste like fruity pebbles. It’s a good flavor, but kind of weird for a beer I must say. The oranges, lemon and blueberry flavor come out as soon as it hits your tongue... perhaps a bit too strong as it overpowers the wheat, malts and yeast. You can hardly taste the hops, but the yeast does come through a bit more at the end. Very smooth on the tongue, and the citrus flavor lingers around after you’re done.

I have not had that type of cereal in years, but the nose definitely conjured up memories. I even got hints of anise underlying all of the fruitiness. Mouthfeel was medium with a riot of fruit flavors on the tongue, a citrusy-lime being the one that stood out. Finish really had a cereal taste to it and for a second I really thought that I was in-taking children's breakfast cereal. I have had better examples of the style, but it was not bad, just kind of odd and sometimes that CAN be good.

It's got a great balance in my opinion between the fruity sweetness and the grainy base of the beer. The fruit flavors are dominant throughout the beer but maintain their strength and don't become bland. The mouthfeel is very smooth and lightly carbonated.

I guess that's their marketing angle. Mouthfeel was decent for the style; fairly smooth. Drinkability was just average in my book. I wanted to have something easy at the end of the night, and I end up with this fruity beer. I should have just ordered a witbier that I knew was good.

This might because I was expecting a lot more fruitiness and was pleasantly surprised when it was not as strong as I had been told it was.

Clearly inferior ingredients, with a very cheap blueberry/orange flavor happening. On a positive note (and it's not even really that positive), the drinkability factor is slightly redeeming in that the weak taste doesn't linger at all. Although I'd imagine the hangover would taste like you'd been eating rancid fruity pebbles all night. So I guess I could drink a bunch of these if that was the idea, but if you're looking to sit down and enjoy a good wheat, look elsewhere. Drinking this beer is actually making me angry.

The lack of head was disappointing however, the aroma was complex, sweet and intriguing but left me worried I was going to drink a wine cooler and not a beer.

First of all this beer accomplishes some good things in the witbier category and does not come through fully in other parts. The appearence does not offer much more than a 1 finger white head that does not last long and leaves little lacing. The smell fills your nose with spice and citrus with the smell of blueberries in the finish. There is still a hint of sweet wheat in this at the core. When tasting a spicey start greets you followed by a sweet citrus and hints of blueberry that trail off into a tart wheat finish. All throughout this beer has a crisp heavy carbonation that somehow still retains a smooth creamy finish.

I've tried this beer over two different sessions hoping that the second time around, being prepared for the smell/taste I'd be able to enjoy the beer and think of the fruitiness as secondary to it.

The citrus aroma is joined well in its taste, with orange and a hint of lemon coming forth as I drank it. The carbonation is a little high for me, but the flavor is solid, and the beer is easy to consume.

Appears a unfiltered pale golden hazy peach hue large bright white head chunky textured rises well above the rim of my glass, lace is sporadic and uneven but it's clinging. Aroma has citrus rolling lemonade accents with a mild chalky atrificial berry swetness with the mixture of grain and artificial flavoring I get fruity pebbles. Flavor chalky creamy citrus with mild herbal tones and blueberry extract sweetness coming in again with that signature fruity pebbles vibe, dry powdered cream finish. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied with a creamy spritzy carbonation flowing, wow that's a strange texture but goes down.

Flavor was a solid lemon-peppery combination with a bit of hops filling in after a few sips. Also noticed a pleasant dry/sharp wheat taste and crispness that fills in underneath the initial lemon-pepper. Nice creaminess too.

More beer characteristics come out in the flavor with some pale malts and wheat, but then gets pushed out by berry and Fruity Pebbles. Weird, but not really bad.

On the palate, this is way too sweet with a sugary cereal fruitiness, with only the barest of balancing wheat acidity and spiciness. The sweetness doesn't taste very honeylike -- it tastes refined. Mouthfeel is coating and a bit cloying -- not fresh and lively enough for the style. Overall, this is bad. Way too sweet, no freshness to balance it out.

Head slowly faded into a thick white ring around the glass, and left a decent amount of sticky lace. Smell: A rather strong fruity aroma. Lots of citrus, orange, lemon, a touch of blueberry with a hint of wheat mostly hidden by all of the fruit. The taste was just as interesting. More orange, lemon zest, a little blueberry, with a lot more wheat than the nose had suggested. Mild carbonation. Quite out of balance. The fruit tones overwhelm the rest of the flavors. Thin and watery in the mouth, but very refreshing. Drinkability is pretty good.","jaxon53","Jun 03, 2007"

The smell is pretty straightforward with a neutral, wheaty base complemented by a bit of spice and some sweet citrus. It's that citrus that dominates the taste, which is lemony from start to finish. The underlying grains can't hold their own, which mutes what might otherwise be some interesting complexity. The mouthfeel is more clingy than I expect in this style, which is perhaps why that lemony sweetness lingers for so long. Goes down well, but a lack of balance hurts this one.","BitteBier","May 31, 2007"

When I picked it up, I was expecting a Hefe. Not too far off. It's a wit, but a very, very, very blueberry wit. An earlier reviewer likened it to fruity pebbles. Yes, it is that sweet. It tastes like blueberry extract. That being said - it's not all that bad. There's enough of the wheat to balance in the aftertaste to make this a reasonably drinkable beer. If you like blueberry beers, this is a better than average example of the style. Unfortunately, if you're like me, and you don't like them, be warned. Although it doesn't explicitly mention it on the label, this is one blueberry for the record books.

4.15,23.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured from a bottle, it's a rather cloudy orange brew with a big chunky head. The nose consists mostly of orange, wheat and malt. It's a sweet citrusy beer, the malt is repressed and the hops nearly non-existant. It's actually a fairly thin beer as far as mouthfeel goes, but the finish is rather syrupy. It goes down easily, but I have a feeling the sweet finish will get to be cloying after a couple beers.","JWFokker","Mar 21, 2007"
2.43,-27.7,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,"Poured a pale golden-orange and very cloudy. Thin white head of tight bubbles shows weak retention but leaves nice big whisps of sticky lace. The nose is of orange-scented pine-sol; the lager yeast seems to have stripped this of the normal ale aromas and replaced it with a strange interpretation of orange rind, faint wheat, distant crystal malt and an odd acetaldehyde note. Sweet upfront with wheat and light crystal malt on the tip of the tounge. The citrus flavor kicks in with a vengence and brings some pineapple and cherry esters with it. Graham crackers and citrus hold on well into the drying aftertaste. A passable balance is achieved with mildly fruity american hop flavor and a muted bitterness. This sure is one wierd Wit.... a lot of unexpected flavors to sort out - but I won't say I don't like brewer's pushing the boundaries. The lighter mouthfel is given texture from the wheat and the medium carbonation seems snappy and lively probably due to some acetaldehyde action. Finishes somewhat candyish- a bit too sweet and overly fruity, I can't say it would be the best summer guzzler; but perhaps the brewers will tweak the recipe and end up with a cool concept brew.","PBRstreetgang","Mar 20, 2007"

It smells of orange juice and blueberry muffins, with a light spiciness and maybe some anise. The body is light and crisp, with airy carbonation and flavors of tart wheat, orange peel/orange soda, spicy coriander, a lemony twang, blueberry, and perhaps some banana, all of which combine to impart a medium finish.

The taste, pretty much what you'd expect from the smell: Orange Julius. Interesting...again, not to my taste, but I think the brewer really put his or her mark on this beer, and I gotta respect that.

It pours a cloudy gold that's almost like brass, and a huge head of frothy white. The retention is quite good, and the head slowly dwindles to a wide collar of creamy bright white along with a cottony, almost-solid, surface covering. It continually leaves lace throughout the glass in wide, craggy splashes... very nice! It's so fruity in the nose that you might initially think you've poured the Berry Wheat mistakenly until you realize it's more citrusy (lime). It is juicy, and tangy like berries though. As it warms the wheaty malt becomes apparent, as does some spice (grains of paradise? white pepper?... maybe it's just from the yeast... doubtful). It's a touch peachy and apricot-like as well. It's smooth across the palate with a gentle zest of carbonation and light-medium body. The flavor is as the nose suggests, with citrusy flavors dominating a light, sweet, somewhat wheaty malt base. The bitterness is limited, but it's balanced by the tartness of the citrus. Quite refreshing! And interesting to boot!

Then you step on the skunk lurking below your feet and he sprays you with his own special social retardant. So to recap: oranges, orange blossoms, citrus branch and nasty skunk musk. The body is a hazy pale yellow the color of a sick canary and holds a diminishing pinky sized white head. The flavor offers sweetened cereal grains in the fore reminiscent of the sugary milk slop youd gulp down after finishing your Sweetum Smacks as fuel for a vigorous Saturday morning of cartoon watching. Some orange dreamsicle notes appear bursting with artificial orange and cream. The effect is very manufactured in that the flavors seem chemically induced through additives rather than from the brewing process. But, I guess brewing is chemistry. I'm not saying the sweetness IS artificial it very well may not be...but it does TASTE artificial.

Anyway, decided to give it a shot. Very similar to Oberon on the whole. Orangish, hazy appearance, with a pretty full whitish-tan head. Smells of citrus. Typical orange aroma is there--too much as unbenownst to me they brought the first out with an orange wedge in it--remedied the second time. Also the typical wheat and slight spice (never sure what to call it--corrander?) smell. Pretty appealing. The taste is wheat up front and almost overwhelming fruity sweetness at the back of the swallow. Oddly enough, blueberries overshadowed the typical orange taste. At first this taste was very appealing. By the end of the beer, and certainly with the second, though, it becomes a bit too much. Mouthfeel is pretty light and crisp. Nothing special. On the whole, this is a pretty decent beer to sit outside and drink on a warm summer night, though after a second round, my mouth is screaming for heavy doses of water as the sugary sweetness has become a bit too much.","macpapi","Jul 30, 2006"

Not too much lacing. Aroma is quite sweet and quite citric with just a moderate amount of coriander spice involved. The spice is ok but the whole smell in general is fake and too sweet. Taste follows suit but is even faker and sweeter. It seems like there's lots of aspartame in here and some orange syrup extract. Thinnish body does nothing. This is awful. I couldn't finish the bottle.","granger10","May 23, 2006"

3.38,0.6,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"This beer pours a cloudy light golden hue with a thin white crown. The aroma is for the most part lemon/citrus/rind. The taste has some wheat character, but an overload of lemon zest follows that and finishes the beer. I think the beer should have a more of a wheat base to start and a bit less lemon/citrus flavor. I can't really catch any hints of the hops. It tastes like somone has already added a slice of lemon to the beer. Its refreshing but the drinkablity factor is not high considering the generous amounts of lemon/citrus found in the beer.","patrick16o","May 07, 2006"

This is orange all the way on the nose. A little bit artificial, like those chewy, sugar coated orange candies. Pretty charged up feel with the carbonation. Light to medium in body. Very sweet beer. Orange and corriander dominating. Artificial tasting though. Doesn't taste like beer. Not my cup of tea...er, pint of beer.","Bighuge","Apr 27, 2006"
1.73,-48.5,3,2.5,1.5,1.5,1,"Hazed yellow orange with thin lacing. Spicy sweet aroma of oranges in Hawaiian punch. Tastes like orange life savors dipped in sugar. Very sweet! No finish, no bitterness, no hops, no wheat, just orange sweetness and maybe a coriander touch. Very fruit juicy and unbeerlike. Cloying at a level equal to or greater than a Bacardi O alchy pop and with a similar flavor too. A dumper for me.","DaPeculierDane","Apr 26, 2006"
2.11,-37.2,3,2,2,2.5,2,"Aroma is a BLAST of lemony coriander and sweet candy. WAY over the top on the coriander. I might detect the faintest hint of malt. Color is a hazy orange-yellow, a bit dark for a wit (assuming that is what it is really sort of intended to be). The head was big on the pour, and a small head sticks around for the whole session. The flavor is of lemony, orangey coriander, with some pepper, and a tad of grainy malt in the finish. Very sweet in the mouth but very dry in the finish. The pepper spiciness and coriander flavors stick around in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium-full. This aint a wit. It is far too overdone. No hop bitterness to balance the sickly sweetness. This beer may please the girlie masses, but it doesnt please me.","dmtaylor","Apr 22, 2006"

Taste was surprisingly fruity as well, dripping with citrus, coriander/clove, and ripe blueberry over belgian wit yeast. Mouthfeel is a little harsh and bubbly as Leine's fruitier beers tend towards, but still quite refreshing. I can certainly see myself chugging through a sixer of this on a summer day at the park while disc golfing. Nice to see Leine's taking a chance with a very Wit-like APWA. Leaps and bounds better than Capital's sour, astringent, ever-more advertaised attempt with Island Wheat.","Golden2wenty1","Apr 16, 2006"

2.61,-22.3,3,2,2.5,3.5,3,"Uniformly hazy straw yellow color, flat white head of about 1/4 of an inch in height and pretty short duration. Incomplete slipping lacing. Aroma is awfully reminiscent of fruit punch with a cinnamon stick in it, Cascade hops play no role -- which is fine in a Wit style though I wonder about the sales pitch. Lightish mouthfeel, carbonation comes in at a tick lower than average. Very spiced flavors, orangey, somewhat limey with pineapple and a quick transition to a chalky nutiness with coriander accents. Lots of similarities to orange ""ribbon"" fruit candy that used to be popular in holiday bowls at Christmas -- especially in the aftertaste. Seems rather obvious and not very appealing to me. I'd give it a nod over Berry Weiss, but that's not much of a recommendation at all.","ADR","Apr 05, 2006"

4.1,22,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Leininkugel's attempt at a Blue Moon-esque Belgian White beer. Pours nice. Cloudy orange with a decent white head. Aromas of orange, coriander and yeast. A lot better aromas than I expected from a Macro brewery (Yes, they should be concidered as such) were surprising as was the flavor. Somewhat overpowering spices make it a bit harsher and seem artifcial. In the end, a decent job by Leinie's.","jj21","Mar 16, 2006"
