"One of the best whites I have ever had the pleasure of trying"
"O: A well balanced wit that really captures the Belgian wit texture and flavor."
""
""
""
"Really nice easy to drink witbier."
"Didn't know what to expect. Was pleasantly surprised."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Love this beer for an every night drink with dinner. Great with burgers!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Clean, crisp, dry, refreshing. Tasty."

""
""
"This was a decent and interesting beer. I feel like it would make a good summer beer. Not something I am likely to get again, at least until next summer perhaps."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Looks great but light on overall taste, it is a quality daytime summer beer, I do not need another one"
""
""
"God awful....herby aftertaste. Simply bad, bad beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This one really piqued my interest. Great beer to contemplate."
""

""
""
"Dogfish dogfish fishdog dogfish Dogfish."
""
"Poured a very light gold color with a finger worth of head that lingers a bit. First sniff was cigar smoke, but then a further, enhanced sniff shows some apple, orange/citrus notes with coriander. Taste is light and somewhat refreshing with some carbonation and lots of citrus flavor. Feel is good, nice and smooth. Overall not to bad, but with out a doubt not near the top."
""
"Feel: Carbonation on the high side. Very easy drinking and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is what a Witbier should taste like! Tons of bubbles, really citrusy, with a nice pop of spice at the end."
""
""
""
"This is a great beer"

"Doesnt leave my palate in a great place. I'd pass."
""
"Very spicey for a witbier.  Coriander, peppery, lemony, zingy, but not overly so.  Nice and refreshing."
"Great alone or with shrimp kabobs. Unusual taste but not off putting. Worth buying for the peppery flavor experience."
""
""
"Overall. Not bad. Not the best witte ever, but unique and pretty refreshing and tasty"
""
"Good solid wit. All the mentioned falvors pull through, lemograss adds extra complexity that is really enjoyable. Peppercorn doesn't come through as much as I'd have liked. This beer would be phenomenal with curry or any other Thai or Indian food. Must try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Drinkable/enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""

"My favorite Dogfish Head. Great summer beer. Light and delicious."
"Delicious- a flavorful witbier, that somehow makes all of the ingredients work. You can even get a hint of the peppercorn. Such a great representation of the style. Makes Blue Moon look like crap!"
""
""
""
"Very carbonated, really too much for me, and it kind of consumes most of your mouth."
"Overly carbonated, bland, ""no buy list"""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall eh, wish the base wheat beer was there, but lemongrass and oranges are interesting."
""

"Average beer not bad not great"
""
""
""

"Yum! Can taste all of the ingredients and they are gooood"

"There was no head what-so-ever. The taste was great, and the look was pretty Adjunct Lager-esc, but I was pleasantly surprised on this one. Good beer from Dogfish Head, but not their best."
"O: Pleasant, light, complex aroma. A very enjoyable session ale for a hot summer afternoon."
"I'm a Wit fan so I truely enjoyed this. With smell of peppercorns and orange peel grabbing my sense I was smiling before the first taste. Which the taste is ""weak"" according to some of my fellow beer bros. I respect and like the taste it is a simple Wit style with the light spice and mellow yeast strain. If you want a good Wit to  enjoy, buy it. If you're looking for a complex and a beer with bursting flavors, don't buy a case of this...Just a six pack to expierence it lol."

"Nice smells but virtually tasteless :("

"A little too light for my taste, even for this style"

"This isn't too bad. I like the complexity and the layers of flavors, but I think they're all a touch too subtle."
"Remarks:  refreshing and tasty, but not as good as some of their other beers"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light, refreshing, and ultra-wheaty brew. As far as Witbiers go, it's very good."
"I didn't care for this as much as most wheat beers. It had a thin pour, a light taste and seemed to lack a bit of depth. The lemongrass was a bit strong to me, and I didn't get as much orange as some other reviewers. There also seemed to be a bit of coriander taste present."
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent alternative to that other all too common wit. So pale with a nice herbaceous flavor. Lemongrass more apparent on the nose and orange in the flavor. Pleasant prickly carbonation. Def drinkable."

"Don't get your hopes up. Average at best. If Miller Light and Coors light had a baby this would be it.  Not sure if the reviews are biased being that Dogfish Head makes some great beers and have a strong following but this is heavily overrated, IMO."

"Pours a clear, gold color.  1/4 inch head of a white color.  Slight retention and decent lacing.  Smells of yeast, sweet malt, pale malt, honey, grapes, hops, and slight spice.  Fits the style of a Witbier.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of sweet malt, pale malt, slight honey, hint of alcohol, hint of grape, and a hint of wheat.  Overall, weak appearance, good aroma, body, and blend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy yellow with very little head. The smell is full of great earthy tones from the herbs, specifically the coriander as well as a bread scent coming through. The taste was very nice with a lot of layers of flavor coming first from the hops and then the spice, with a toasted finish made for a highly refreshing beer."

""
""
""

"Overall, a tasty and refreshing beverage."

"Hazy light straw color with a huge fluffy white head. Aromas of earthy funk with a hint of sulfur. Lemony citrus and a hint of spice rounds out the nose. Sweet tart orange citrusy flavor with hint so earth and spice. Medium to light body with spritzy carbonation. Easily drinkable beer, I kind of wish I had tried this when the weather was a bit warmer"
""
""
""
"light refreshing Wit that had such a great smell, i wish i could use it for an air freshener. different taste from a Wit, especially when comparing it to Hoegaarden, Whirlwind, or Hitachino Nest white."
""
""
"Bottle from Lazy Dog Macon. Pours light gold color with fluffy white head. Aroma is citrus with hints of hay. Flavor is of wheat malt with coriander and citrus hops on the back end. Light carbonation and very refreshing."
""
""
"O: This is an excellent wit. It is grassier than others, but I love that quality. This one is in my rotation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle. Pours a hazy pale yellow with a medium white head. Aroma is of sweet citrus, lemon orange. Taste has a nice zesty lemon orange flavor with some slight notes of coriander and wheat, mild bitterness. Palate is a medium body, crisp with good carbonation. The finish is sweet citrus lemon orange flavor, coriander, wheat notes and mild bitterness for balance. Overall a good flavorful drinking brew."

"Pours a light almost clear gold with a mostly short-lasting white head. Very slight lacing. The aroma is also mild, but has nice fruit and grain notes. The taste is very similar with additional notes from the spices and herbs. The body is nicely weighted and holds the flavor well. A really good white ale."

"Pale almost ashy yellow, like they turned the saturation down on the colour wheel. Kind of the colour of a white wine... Barely even anything of watery/bubbly white head. I’m not getting much on the aroma either: almost smells like a grape must, though maybe just because now I have white wine on the mind. I suppose it’s probably the subtle lemongrass that I’m picking up with some of the body of the peppercorn, but not the edge. Again, not getting any of the advertised orange, but more a muted grassy fruit twinge, again likely the lemongrass taking the forefront. Don’t notice any pepper dash here, and only a vague bready note in the distance and a faint Belgian yeast at the finish, but that’s about it. Some might describe it as subtle, I am more inclined to be a little less forgiving and just say there’s not really that much going on. Surprisingly decent medium body, and a bit of a dry finish. I mean... it IS a beautiful sunny afternoon, which really seems to be the perfect venue for this beer. Though I feel like I should be in an airy white tent with cucumber sandwiches. Nope, just covered in insulation and watching the forest..."
""
""
"Subtle notes of orange and coriander. Great on a crisp day. Not heavy or overly hoppy, closer to a session. Nice floral and spiced notes on the nose, creamy and hazy color add to a nice pour."

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I was prepared to be underwhelmed as I often am by many of the beers in the Dogfish lineup but this one is right up there with Palo Santo Marron among my favorites; the perfect summer beer, with plenty of flavor and a lovely floral aspect"

"Very pleasant white ale with subtle hints of Indian spices. Slightly spicy aftertaste. Obvious citrus and lemongrass notes (as advertised on the bottle). I would consider this to be an ideal summer beer for those new to more complex beers or beers brewed with spices. It would also be a perfectly refreshing complement to very spicy Indian or Thai style food."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Nothing overwhelming about this one. Just an easy drinking Belgian style brew."

"Light bodied with soft carbonation. Finishes dry, and has a light orange and lemongrass aftertaste.Very nice taste for a 4.80 % abv beer. Worth trying if you get the chance."

"O: I've sadly forgotten how much I love witbiers lately and Dogfish Head has done a wonderful job of providing a liquid reminder of why I was so attracted to them in the first place. Delicate summer-like flavors infused with the wonderful touch of lemongrass makes this a perfect mid-afternoon beverage. I was, however, fairly disappointed with the mouthfeel, which is rare for me to say about a Dogfish Head offering. I'm hoping it was just a fluke, but it's not enough for me to shy away from recommending this Wit to others. A fine example of a fine style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not one of DFH's best attempts, but a solid witbier nonetheless. Not the most complex, but it accomplishes what it strives to do."
"Pours a very pale clear gold. Smallish white head with some persistent lacing. Smell is lemony orangey citrus. Also some of that great wheat banana smell. Taste has a light malt sweetness up front going into a tangy citrus with a bit of a bite. A little spice but the wheat remains the dominant flavor. Rather full bodied for a wit but not heavy. Easily drinkable. Wow what a great wit from an american brewer. Great example of the style."
"a really awesome warm weather drinker right here, not too much coriander, and showing much more of the lemongrass and orange (the features that make this beer unique from the increasingly crowded belgian white category) show up. just a slight fog to this otherwise radiant lustrous pale golden brew. an inch of fading white froth rests on top as copious bubbles rise up from the bottom of my wine glass. the nose here is a little perfumy, overly fragrant maybe, but i definitely pick up on refreshing lemongrass and citrus. clean tasting, not much grain character to it, which i guess is my only reasonable criticism of this slammable brew. a faint biscuit property, but thats all. a hint of tartness in with the very mild belgian yeast as it finishes, and again with a slight citrus acidity. body could not be lighter, and the carbonation is as expressive as any. a really pleasant take on the style, affordable, and in widely available sic packs. this is one i will buy again. cant think of a better hot afternoon beer. the peppercorns are invisible, but its irrelevant."

"Went to Dogfish Head brewery to taste test. Brought my growlers along and this one got selected based on its smooth flavor for a Belgian Wit. I loved the color, taste and smoothness and it kept me coming back for more. I highly recommend this beer even though I tend to side on the IPA hopheads side. Enjoy !"

""
""
"O: A very nice summery brew. Namaste indeed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is light, full of carbonation, and dry. The carbonation is very high, as expected, and this is right where it should be. Overall, this is a very refreshing beer that works great on a hot day. Nothing blows me away, and it is fairly conservative."

"With a low 25 IBU this brew has a high degree of drinkability especially for the hop-confused demographic ;-). Flavors for this brew are layered nicely, nothing too over powering. Very ""bright"" finish leaving the palate feeling clean. Great thirst quencher."
""
""
"O - This is not my cup of tea at all, but I think it succeeds for what it tries to be. Sessionable, easy to drink, and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
"O- This is reminiscent of sunscreen, but in a good way. It tastes like summer. Nice and light. Would be refreshing on the beach. Good thing this is in six packs now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I might be a little harsh on this beer because it's far outside of the kind I normally like to drink. The taste is not very complex and there isn't a really any hops or malt taste. It doesn't feel very balanced to me; just a bit spicy."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Don't miss this one. The delicate but persistent features of a weiss, with the smooth drinkability of a lager. Dogfish reminds us again why it's a powerhouse among the craft breweries."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Well, it's pretty interesting. I don't know if it's the pepper or not, but the taste is definitely different from your typical wit. The only problem is I'm not sure I really like it. I don't mind some bitterness, but it seems misplaced here. It was interesting to try, but I doubt I'll be revisiting it anytime soon."
"Traditional hefeweizen flavors--plenty of wheat and yeast. There's a soft malt to the beginning which slowly shifts to sweetish wheat. Slight sourness in the swallow. Short aftertaste. Full bodied with plenty of carbonation."
""
"An easy drinking summer beer, but there are better wits out there."
""
"O-A Witbier that isn't overly sweet, which is a plus in my book. I thought the nose was more dynamic than the flavor but as far as the style goes, it's a solid brew."
""
""
"O: A good Belgian beer and summer ale. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to try a Belgian beer on a warm summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Appearance is a cloudy light straw with a finger of head that quickly dissipated down to a thin film. The nose had the essence of wheat and a pinch of Belgian funk. The flavor is light and mild with the wheat upfront and a finish that is dry and slightly peppery."
""
""
""
"Overall this is another well crafted beer from DFH. Tasty and sessionable!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall this is a decent, lightly spiced wheat beer. It is definitely worth trying. If the spices were a bit more prominent this would be an even better beer."
"Overall: A very good take on a Belgian style Witbier. Good notes of citrus and coriander."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A crisp refreshing white brew with extra bits other flavours to keep you interested."
""
""
"I like this beer, like the taste. Just can't seem to put into words why."
""
"Although I only bought one bottle of this, I could have easily had 3 or 4 in a sitting since the alcohol was both undetectable and low in terms of percentage. While not as good as its European counterparts, there's a lot to like here and for a beer this unassuming, there was enough flavor to satisfy even the biggest beer geek. A hint of wheat or more spice would have been appreciated but as it was, this was something that I'd reach for again now that the warmer months are here. Another subtly solid offering from Dogfish Head!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is crisp and nicely carbonated with a good flavor overall for its style. The spice is good, but not overdone, and the fruits, yeast, and wheat each contributes to the enjoyment of the beer in their own way. I liked it more as I sipped more and ended by bottle wishing I had another. I’m not always in the mood for witbier, but when I am, I will keep this Dogfish brew in mind."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is light and appropriately approachable. There's a well-balanced spice character that plays well alongside a refreshing citrus tone. Nothing here is over-the-top or experimental, as most of Dogfish brews are. Light and refreshing, this one's solid and enjoyable nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's creamy, fluffy and soft on the tongue all the way but keeps up a firm crispness. The body is light and carries everything well. It heads a little dry into the finish, but never dries out too much."
""
"Everything about this beer is good-to-great....except a major butterscotch hit of diacetyl. It's distracting and disappointing. The beer is fresh, as well, so there are no excuses here."
"O- This was the style that really catapulted me into my beer craze back in the day. I hardly ever buy it anymore, but my desire to try as many DF Head beers as possible won out. It was a really nice surprise to have enjoyed it as much as I did. I can definitely see buying this for times I'm craving something light or for lazy days by the lake. Probably the best Whit I've tried so far."

"The only other thing I have to add is that the price was RIDICULOUS. I don't know if it was just the store that I go to but I paid almost $16 for a sixer. Pretty hefty for a low ABV beer."

"I'm a big fan of Dogfish Head beers and I guess I was just expecting more out of this brew... It was a bit on the boring and plain side. The white wheat beer has a bit of a floral nose and very light citrusy flavor. I'm not a huge fan and it just doesn't seem to fit the mold of normal dogfish head brews."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Overall, this beer was very surprising. Definitely not a session drinking beer, despite its moderately low ABV (4.8%), its a great beer to sip on. It's not too overbearing, but compared to most white beers, it's just different; however, different isn't always bad. As a pleasant surprise, the herbal esters of this beer definitely sneak up on you. They are barely detectable in the aromas, but this adds to the overall experience of this beer. This beer is a welcome (if not unusual) surprise from Dogfish Head. Not necessarily a brew that I'd keep stock of, I would definitely pick up a bottle or two again to have some variety."

"highly drinkable flavorful sessionable beer. aromas are highly herbal with the coriander almost to the point of being perfumey. yeast characters emerge as it warms, hints of banana. taste is bright citrusy spicy and grainy. its a load of flavor in a small beer. had out of a pilsner at about 45 degrees"

"O- while it's funny that this was once one of my favorites, I still love this beer. As I sip I await the break of summer... The irony rests in a snowstorm outside my front door."
""
""
""
"Drinkability is both light and easy drinking, and thick-and-chewy, like a good witbier should be. This is another fine brew from DFH."
""
"Looks like a wit. Smells like a wit. Tastes like a wit. Real nice citrus tones showing through with those peppercorns ending up on the backside. Easy to drink. There are some thicker yeast tones with a bready edge on the backside that probably interfere with those characteristics, but the beer overall is pretty nice. This is a very true to style brew. I think it's a very wise idea that they put this in 12 ouncers."
""
""
"Is light golden/straw in color with a thin white head. Good retention, and a nice lace. Aroma is of tart fruit, and candy. Body is crisp, and carbonated. Taste is of spicy lemon, and sweet tart candy. Fresh, and tart at the finish. Very nice example of this style. Will be a regular this Summer! If Summer ever gets here!"
"Overall: A pretty nice brew. Not overly complex, but it paired well with dinner, and also seems decently sessionable. It's very well balanced. Would have again. Another nice beer from DFH."

"A light, dry, and slightly tart beer that packs in a good deal of character. Off the nose it's this beer shows its colors as a Belgium Witt with coriander, peppercorn, a mellow but all too apparent spiciness, and some grassier. These flavors carry into the palate where the more vegetal flavors of the bunch stand out. Thats not to say it's not followed by hints of orange, lemongrass, and dried flowers.

"Give me a good wit and let me dump a lemon slice in my self. Personally I like this beer but like most wits/ tripels to much coriander spices."
""
"Clear straw colored, with an orangey white thin head that settles out quickly. Aroma of yeast and clove. Flavor initially fairly matches the nose, but slight lemony notes emerge, and a peppery bite works its way into the finish. Mouthfeel is crisp and dry, but a bit talcy as well."

"O = If it wasn't for that bitterness, which I'm attributing to the dried orange slices, I would really like this wheat beer. I think it's worth revisiting on a hot summer day with a barbecue meal. it would probably be very refreshing. Not a favorite for drinking on its own, though."
""
"Overall - Not bad but would be much better if the fruits were more upfront, with less peppercorn. The more I drink it, the less im enjoying it. Decent enough for a hot summer day for some, low alcohol, but I look for crisp, fruity wits that feature orange, melons or berries. Worth a drink for fans of wit that want a little twist on the style. This could be a special beer imo with a kick of fruits though."
""
""
"Good beer, solid throughout, orange and coriander from first sip through to the end."
""
"Overall I agree with most its a very well crafted white ale with mild spices and some interesting lemongrass tones but compared to most Witbier beers its really mild and somewhat lacking flavor. I can't believe they finally put it in six packs making this worth 10 dollars a six pack. It was no way worth 8-9 dollars a bomber."

"Very pleasant. The look in a glass reminds me a lot of a lighter American hefeweizen. Pale yellow in color and not much head, not that I was expecting much for a white beer. You can pick up on the orange scent better from the bottle and out of a glass it smell more like a traditional white beer, but the taste comes out nicely for this particular type of beer. It was unique for what i have had in white beers but it wasn't astounding. Light taste, easy to drink almost fruity with a crisp after taste that lasts long enough to enjoy but doesn't stick around too long. I think this beer is really a nice refreshing sweet drink and like it's name, is meant to be satisfying and harmonious"

"Overall, its a decent, sessionable beer. But as far as the exact style, I much prefer UFO."
"More citrus character than I recall. Refreshing, clean beer."

"Pours a light straw color with a hint of sunshine in it. Hazed and with a white head of loose bubbles that fell quickly to a ring and film on top. Just lovely. Nose is breaddy and cracker. There is a light grain sweetness that seems to be deep in the beer but not too strong or heavy. The fruit is subtle. A bit of lemon citrus, a very faint whisper of fresh orange. Some coriander adds earth to the nose. Taste is friendly and very drinkable. Dry, crisp and the flavor of lemongrass. The juicy orange lightly underneath and a crisp wheat dryness. Creamy body with active carbonation. A bit of earth finishes this one dry."
"Overall: Wheat beers are far from my go-to style, but I was pleasantly surprised by this considering that. It's a very refreshing, sessionable beer that I would imagine would be great in the summertime (instead of the blizzard-like conditions I'm actually drinking it in)."

"Interesting twist on a witbier. Very sessionable. I'd buy it again if I'm in the mood for something different."
""

"I tasted it, and this is where i start to get dissappointed. Dogfishhead has a lot of original tasting beers, whereas this one tastes like heineken, and a lot of other beers of the sort. The only distinction is the heavy after taste of lemongrass, which is why i give taste a 3.75. Heineken is about a 2.25 for me, but this aftertaste in Namaste is incredible. I'm not going to get more any time soon, the alcohol content is only 5% and it was I think $12 for a pint. Worth to buy it if you want to know what ""good"" heineken tastes like, but its nothing special."

"This tastes refreshing and creamy with a light zesty tang of lemon and coriander. Flavorful, again because of the corn (the lemon and peppercorn, for me, imparts a tangy corn aspect that defines this beer). It drinks well and for how light it is, quite rich in flavor. Light peppery and well balanced with a perfectly refreshing, lemon/ lighter orange-flavored finish. Although highly drinkable, it feels less carbonated after a fairly short while. I tried this one a couple years back from a 750 ml bottle and loved it even though I thought it was overpriced. Glad to see the 6 packs. Could be a summer session choice."

"a light beer"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a whiteish/golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is musty, wheat, a bit of spice. Taste is spices, some citrus and wheat, very easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall would probably be more enjoyable on a hot summer day, but a solid beer."

"Poured into a trusty pint glass. A nice clean crisp light color with small head. You can taste the orange peel and peppercorn. Taste is about average at best. A mouthful starting taste that dwindeles as the more you drink. Overall a decent average white beer nothing spectacular but worth trying at least once"
"Overall this was a nice witbier, but I was disappointed that I didn't get much citrus/orange. I love the idea of this beer, but the flavored weren't very pronounced. Even still, a refreshing wheat."

"O. Just kind of lacks character. Flat, nothing special."

"Wow. Superb, cant wait to guzzle down sixers of these come summer. Creamy and birstly mouthfeel, Dry grainy husk flavor throughout, sharp wheat, some tart citrus flavors with a bit of grassyness and a super dry grainy finish with hearty wheat bread flavors lingering in the mouth. A touch of pucker, a lot of flavor, and intensely refreshing."
"Overall: Another good one from Dogfish Head. Nothing mind blowing, but a nice flavorful refreshing witbier, that you can sit back and drink a few of without giving it much thought. The transition from 750s to 12oz 4 packs is a nice change too."
""
""
""
""
"O: I usually never have a strong opinion on most of the DFH regulars, good or bad, and guess what? This is another DFH regular that's only okay to me. I would have felt royally gypped paying +$10 for a 750 of this, so thanks to its 6-pack availability, I can merely give it a nonchalant shrug."

"My assessment is that there's a great deal more happening on the label of this bottle than with the brew under it. This is a fairly drab wit, and without enhancement from food, the Subcontinental spices lay largely dormant. It does drink easily with spicy food, though, so I could be convinced to have this meek creature again with Thai or Afghani fare down the line."
"O: All smell and no taste. Not high on the priority list to try again. A beer that seems mildly interesting with first gulp, but as you pay attention to the smell and continue to feel it in your mouth, it becomes less appealing."

"Well executed witbier, not that flavorful but with high drinkability and nice on a hot day such this one. I believe it would be more interesting if the lemongrass note could be tune up just a bit."

"The beer is pale yellow with a fizzy white head. Ample effervescence apparent. The aroma offers malt, lemons, lemon zest, earthy hop scents, grass. Refreshing and light. Immediately, I think the body is too thin, though on the other hand, this adds to the thirst quenching on a hot day factor. Still, I'd prefer a slightly more robust feel. Mild bitterness in the finish. Floral hops and lemon grass with a dash of citrus, particularly lemons and oranges, respectively. Overall, a solid beer, but overpriced. $8.99 per sixer might inspire me to purchase this again, but for a 750 mL bottle, that's asking too much, given the style."

"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a nice golden hue, with a bubbly thin white head that had no cling. Large amounts of carbonation rose from the bottom. Aroma was a bit of wheat, mellowed nicely by orange citrus. Taste was clean, a bit of citrus up front, became herbal in the middle, with a bit of hoppy grain in the backend. Coated nicely, seemed a tad thin, but not bad. Overall, not bad. Well balanced flavor with a nice twist."
""
""
""
""
""
"Lacks flavor, but makes it up as one of the most addictive beers I have had. Maybe that's a bad thing though. It lacks complexities from the German and Belgian wheat beers. It tastes almost like watered down lemon drink at times."

"light yellow color- slightly cloudy with a ton of white head. smells sour, lemony. the taste is tart and flowery. namaste is sweeter than the smell leads on, but i almost wish it was even sweeter than it is. there are some really nice flavors at work here. over all this beer is light and very drinkable and the bottle conditioning helps with the smoothness. this would be a good one to have on hand when the weather warms up."

"O: a very tasty and refreshing witbier. good flavors and fairly true to style. DFH rarely disappoints and this beer is a winner."
"Strong smell of lemon-orange. Mouth feel was a bit too carbonated. But taste of the lemongrass and orange peel were definitely present and added some interesting flavor. A little too yeasty also but overall I enjoyed this. Not typically a fan of this style but a very intriguing offer from Dogfish. Wouldn't buy the bottle again but would have it if it was on tap somewhere."

"Overall I liked this beer and I thought that it was a good and true example of the style, it pretty much had everything that I look for in the style so I wasn't left wanting more, everyone I shared it with liked it. This beer had great drinkability, it was really smooth and refreshing, I could see myself having no problem drinking the whole bottle, a great choice for a warm summer afternoon. What I liked most about this beer was how true to style and complex it was, it wasn't overdone by any means and it had great balance. What I liked least about this beer is that Dogfish Head doesn't put this in 12oz bottles, it seems like the perfect beer for that format, almost $10 dollars for 750ml of a 5% Witbier isn't a great deal. I don't think I would buy this beer again, maybe for a special occasion, but for the price I couldn't justify buying it often. All in all I was impressed with this beer, I was expecting something a little odd and different with this beer, instead I just got a really good tasting Witbier and that's just what I needed, good work guys, this is one solid and good tasting Witbier."

"Fairly light bodied with medium, slightly-spritzy carbonation. Very drinkable."
"I did like the uber carbonation in this one...pretty refreshing on a hot Texas night. It's quite possible that this style just doesn't do it for me. Similar to a hefe, but felt just a bit off overall."
""

"O. Nice it had some interesting flavors to it. All of them were a little too mild and not much really stuck with me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: for a style that is usually bland and boring this one stands out as one of the best."
""
"It was crisp and light, but unlike some Witbiers, the spices weren't overwhelming. Unfortunately, beyond that it seemed to be a typical Witbier with nothing in particular standing out. Perhaps it's a bit above average though, as I did find it more drinkable than a few I've had recently. I wouldn't pay the usual 8 dollars for a 750mL of this ever, but it wasn't wasted money especially with that coupon."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a goblet, can't read the bottled date. This pours a slightly hazy straw light color with a short lived white head. The smells are of corriander, orange and spices. The feel is medium to light. The taste is okay a little orange and ripe orange bitterness, some lemon grass, pretty light flavors for dogfish head, not their best."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a textbook Witbier in my opinion. I would say that Flying Dog's Woody Creek is probably a good comparison here. I've had others that were very similar, but the level of quality is probably what sets this beer apart from the others (plus it was fresh from the brewpub)."
""
"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 2012 C. Pours very hazy golden amber color with a nice 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some nice soapy lacing clings to the glass, with a fair amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big lemon, orange peel, clove, pepper, herbal, coriander, wheat, earth, grass, and yeast spiciness. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good complexity. Very pleasant and enjoyable. Taste of lemon, orange zest, clove, grass, pepper, coriander, wheat, earth, and yeast spices. Light wheat tang on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, coriander, wheat, clove, pepper, grass, earth, and yeast spices on the finish for a short bit. Fairly dry on the finish as expected. Nice flavor balance and complexity; with a nice level of flavors. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a slightly slick, crisp, and prickly mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with pretty much zero warming noticed at all. Overall this is simply just an excellent witbier. Great flavor balance and complexity; and extremely smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O - a must try if you like limited release/limited availability beer. This beer is light enough in ABV that it is a very good drinking beer at the end of long hot day. Very refreshing."
""
"Bottle: Poured a dirty yellow color ale with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of coriander and solid wheat malt with just the right amount of lemongrass is very enticing. Taste is a great mix between some coriander and slightly sweet wheat malt with good notes of lemongrass which really works well into the mix. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Really enjoyed this one with great amount of wheat malt and lemongrass bringing something unique to this mix."
""

""
"T: A good amount of orange and coriander with a nice light flavor profile. Some ginger and lemongrass as well. Definitely is under carbonated. Just a hint of carbonation would do this beer wonders."
""
""
"Pours a cloudy pale orange amber. Thin fine white head with little lacing. Aroma is sweet, wheaty with a hint of spice. Taste is light wheat, citrus and multiple spices. A distinct floral taste/aroma; almost too much, but works out fine. My first reaction was ""whoa, this is different!"". Medium bodied. This is a quite original, light wheat beer that is very refreshing. I'm impressed and will get this every time it is released. Great label too. An unusual white particulate residue at the bottom of the glass."
""
""
"D - Not my favorite, but an interesting beer!"
"Pours a slightly murky light yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and some slight spice aromas. Taste is much the same with a very mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is light, refreshing, and easy to drink."

"Dogfish Head Namaste is a cloudy, pale yellow beer with small particles in it. It's topped with a fluffy, bubbly head that has great retention and lacing. It has an overpowering lemongrass aroma. There's a little trace of orange peel and a hint of something beer-like-- maybe wheat. It's light bodied and velvety smooth with a clean, dry finish. It's lightly flavored. It's sort of like lemongrass tea meets a Wit. There's not really any bitterness to speak of. It's perhaps a touch sweet. There isn't much aftertaste. I feel like I would enjoy this much more if I was sipping it outside in some hot weather. It's really mellow and incredibly inoffensive."

"Pours a five+ finger white head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Hazy straw color. Strong carbonation and light-medium bodied. Orange and lemon grass nose and flavor is orange, lemon grass some tartness. Good Summer drink. $10.99 for a 750ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."

"overall, this was really an average beer. a good session drink, and a good summer lawn mower/yard-work beer. i don't see a reason why they would put this in a bomber and not just sell it by the six pack. very average flavors and smells, but at least it LOOKED nice. i think maybe there was a problem with this bottle being over carbonated that took a bit away from everything."
"O- This was a great wheatbeer. I'm usually not a huge fan of wheat beers, but I couldn't definitely see my self drinking this on a regular basis if it were in 6-packs. I liked how it a good balance between the orange, lemon, sweet, and bitter tastes. This would definitely make a great beer to have on hot summer days. I would definitely recommend trying some."

"pour is hazy straw yellow with a tight white head. The nose is bright and balanced. An assertive yeast not with a well balanced peppery spice. The coriander adds an Interesting earthy note behind. The taste is also bright, lemony zest, lightly earthy, assertive yeast notes with a solid balance of spice and coriander. The body is light and airy, strong carbonation and a semi dry finish."

"Sampled on April 7, 2012 at the Keene, NH Beerfest. The pour was pale yellow to olive in tone with a fizzy white head and a generally cloudy appearance. The aroma features an array of sensations including citrus, grainy malts, yeast, and something not unlike wheat. The body is about medium and fairly typical for the style. The taste had a slightly more bready flavor along with malts, pepper, and a dry finish. This one costs a few bucks so I am glad I got to try it at a brewfest."

"DogFish Head Namaste Witbier, 22oz. bomber: Witbiers have been one of my favorites ever since I had a Hoggarten on the Grand Place in Brussels. Aside from the ubiquitous Coors Blue Moon, you do not see many brewers pursuing this fine style of beer. DogFish Head has a good reputation, so, despite the ugly label, I picked up this bomber to see what DogFish Head could do. The thin pure white head sits atop a cloudy straw colored body, and effuses an aroma of citrus. Good witbier flavor, which stays very light. No aftertaste. The Namaste is a good effort by DogFish Head, and worthy of a try. I drink wheats and whites during the summer, and often more than one per sitting, often with fresh (for zest) or aged (for sweetness) lemon. A “statement” white beer just does not fit into the economics, and it is often the lemon that is more key to the flavor than the underlying brew. So Blue Moon will remain the staple."

"Overall: A good brew from DFH, but a little bit highly priced (10$/750ml). Highly drinkable. Perfect for summer days."

"Pours a pale white/straw color. A careful pour still yields a decent amount of sediment. Aromas of hay, citrus, grass and wheat are dominant. In the taste, much like a standard wit, wheat, lemon, twang of lemon grass, citrus, coriander and pepper. Very light. The mouthfeel is extrememly light bodied, thin, and watery. Overall, interesting and glad to try. Would say it would be great on a hot summer day, but I found it a bit too over spiced to be quenching, and too watery to hold the spices at bay. Average."

"O: This is a really good witbier. I love the spice and lemon/orange balance - definitely a beer that I'll be getting again."

"22 ounce bomber. It’s about 75 degrees and sunny outside, so to celebrate that spring has sprung I’m digging a rarity from Dogfish out of the back of the fridge. Namaste pours a hazy light gold, with a nice pillowy head that dissipates pretty quickly. Lots of little floaties remain in my glass. Not sure if that’s yeast, spice, or something else. Rustic is probably the best – and kindest - way to describe the appearance. Has the hallmark smell of a classic witbier, with notes of coriander and light citrusy orange peel the first things I pick up in the nose. I’m also getting a lemon character which I can only assume is the lemongrass. First taste is quite nice, as the beer has a certain thirst quenching impact, in that it hits the tongue and quickly washes to the sides of the mouth and down the throat almost too fast. Musky wheat malt holds up the structure of the beer from the onset, before it’s washed away by a cavalcade of spice and citrus. Yeast lends a slightly tart, almost sour note in a supporting role. The after finish is pleasant lemon pith. The beer finishes dry, with a hint of spicy carbonation, which leaves you wanting to go back to it and drink some more. Wits can often be heavy handed in the spice department, though that is not the case with Namaste, which arrives at a nearly perfect balance between the signature spices and the wheat and hops behind them. Kudos to the brewer, though the lengthy cellaring time may have had something to do with it as well. Despite the somewhat awkward appearance at the beginning, the beer is actually quite good, and certainly hits the spot on a warm spring day."

"O- A very tasty sessionable beer with a good scent. Nothing much to complain about other than the particles that caught me off guard. At $8/22oz bottle I probably couldn't afford to drink this as a session beer but it's definitely good."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - I can describe this best as a disappointment. It's presented in the special 22 oz bottle and with decent packaging. The perceived concept ('something special') was certainly underwhelmed by utter absence of flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Well it's a refreshing wheat beer, perfect for a warm day. It's the basic characteristic taste you're looking for, so it makes the cut, but it isn't particularly notable. It was slightly more bitter than I'm used to. I can't tell if that was a welcome twist or a distraction, but I'm OK with it. Bombers are often ripoffs and this one is no exception. It's definitely not good enough to justify the $10 I paid. On a cost-per-ounce basis, a sixpack of this stuff would be over $28, which is triple what it's worth. FFFUUU bombers!"

"Overall/Drinkability: Okay. Nicely spiced for a Wit but not the most drinkable wit I’ve ever had. Went well with crab cakes and I would have loved a larger glass, but I would have stopped at one. Lack of aroma disappointing though."
"Using coriander in a witbier seems very risky seeing that witbier naturally have a skunky bite to them, adding a spice that has little subtly would make for a unique tasting but not a ""good"" drink. But the mellow undertones of all the flavors mold well. If this beer was any stronger or robust I do not think it would work. Great for food pairing..cheese, fruit, and vegetables."

"O: Very typical of a Belgian white beer, really. It's a good beer, but I think you can do as well without spending $10 a bottle."
"I think many of the American imitations in the Belgian White style fall short of greatness. Several brand names come to mind, eh-hem Blue Moon, that are just mediocre representations of really great styles. The Dogfish Head Namaste doesn't fall into that category. Refreshing and smooth, yet fairly full and complex. This is one of the best American imitations I've seen."

"Poured a nice sunny hazy gold with a fizzy white head. There was fair head retention with lasting lacing around the glass. The aroma had lemongrass, citrus and yeast. The flavor was similar to aroma with lemon and yeast, some malt sweetness that complimented the creamy mouthfeel and slight alcohol presence."
"Poured lemony yellow with not much head. Looks delicious. Grains with soft citrus and floral in the nose. Almost peppery taste with nice carbonation. Hoppy background with a great mouthfeel. Very nice refreshing beer. Never been disappointed by a dfh except for black and blue."
"Overall, quite an enjoyable witbier. Lemongrass adds but does not overshadow the standard wit flavours. Nice beer."
"A 10 dollar bottle of beer better impress me but most Dogfish Heads do. Poured this sucker into the glass it was a light almost hay color and had a little bit of sediments. The aroma the label says it best you smell the floral and citrus aromas. You can taste a slight carameliness to it and it goes down super smooth. It is very easy to drink and is very light which is non typical for Dogfish Head. Another inspirational brew nevertheless. Try it its worth it to spend more when it counts."
"Overall: Easily drinkable if you like the sourness of lemons...which I do. This would be ideal with a fresh salad. Guess, I'll get on that for next go round."
"this is great. a nice session-able beer for the summer time."
"I split a 750 ml bottle of this with my wife on a snowy, windy October day. The beer pours a milky, cloudy, pale yellow color with a puffy white head. It's aroma is a nice mix of pepper, zesty orange peel, and herbal scents. Lemon, orange, coriander, and white pepper are the most notable scents. These, along with some soft pale malt underneath, give the beer a solidly enjoyable aroma. The taste is a bit more peppery than expected, with a sharp spice flavor, but it also has a soft sweetness. Somewhat abrupt finish. Well balanced, and the orange character seems to give the beer a zesty, alive quality. Good beer."
"750ml bottle purchased at McKinnon's in Portsmouth. Pours a hazy light yellow body with a good half inch or so of white head. Smells very fruity and floral with a decent amount of spice. Oranges, coriander, lemon, pepper, and hints of caramel malt hit the palate. Light bodied with ample carbonation. Super-drinkable. Complex and unique but while flavorful, this beer is not in your face and everything blends very well complimenting each other. A great witbier. I'm quite impressed. Though at $10 per bottle, this will have to be an occasional treat."
"Nice light golden ale, pours so-so without much head. Love the crisp airy citrus aromas (best part of the ale). Spicy notes especially on the back end lend to the refreshing quality of the beer. Perfect end of summer beer. Though technically summer has been over for a while now I think I had it on the best last day we will have in October. Overall the beer is a winner and above average but Dogfish Head definitely does better on some of there other brews. Cool name and idea though."
"O: Not your typical Wit and thats kind of what I expected from Dogfish. I liked the complexity of it, and would def enjoy a few more."
"Drink- It's a very good wit. I have had some shitty ones and this is very good. One of the few I would come back too."
"Poured this clear golden yellow beer into my pint glass as a small head developed. I detected coriander, orange peel, grain, and a bit of a vegetal funk in the aroma. A fine wheat beer taste with noticeable lemongrass present. Subtle spices. Very light and refreshing - typical of the style. Quite good, but not sure it lives up to the hype."
"O - Outstanding job by Dogfish Head. Smells wonderful taste wonderful and feels great. Glad I dished out the 10 dollars for this one. Id do it again."
"O: If you haven't tried this beer you need to. This is everything I want in a wheat beer and more."
"Overall – not a bad brew at all, but not terribly perplexing in the taste. But, the taste itself is very good."
"O: a refreshing brew, DFH does Witbiers well!"
"I didn't notice the alcohol level on this one until after I poured and tasted the brew, and damn does this have some wonderful complexity for such a low ABV. It's spice dominant for sure but the underlying grassy and herbal tones as well as the lovely citrus notes make for a great take on a Wit, which is fast becoming one of my favorite styles."
"Not one of the top Witbiers, but DFH is always going for left of center, so this one hits the mark for me."
"An interesting variation on a Belgian witbier ... at least I think that is what they were aiming for. I liked the balance of flavors from the grains, fruit(s) and spices."
"Decent Wit, with some interesting qualities. One I'd give a moderate recommendation for. It's DFH, how can you not!"
"O: A very interesting beer...not what I was expecting. Fits well within the style and I enjoyed it quite a bit. Well done!"
"overall not a bad ale...i would expect nothing less from dogfish head!"
"Dogfish Head has disappointed me on a number of beers, though this one is excellent. A spot on Wit that is incredibly enjoyable to drink. Something I would highly recommend."
"I enjoyed this beer and would like to try it on tap sometime. As for judging it to a Witbier it is different but shares a lot of the same qualities. A nice change of pace for the style."
"overall.. drinkable when Im in the mood for a light beer.. just not my favorite style.. but good session"
"Pours a cloudy yellow color from the bottle. Has a nice two finger head that sticks around for a while. Light citrus flavor with some slight bitterness. not much for a wheat taste but this is not overpowering at all. very well rounded and something i would buy again."
"O: It's tasty and easy-drinking. Much better than the average Witbier."
"Mouthfeel: Very prominant carboation. Very clean mouthfeel. Very light body with a refreshing quality. I am not a huge fan of Witbiers in general but this one is probably one of the better ones that I have had. But keep in mind I haven't had very many."
"O - A good brew, but not overwhelming. Not worth the price tag, but still a nice brew to split with your lady."
"O - I have started to really enjoy beers with Coliander in it. This one does not dissapoint. Love this beer. Drink up"
"Overall (4.0): It’s light, bright, and maybe could be more vibrant but it’s refreshing, really. To be fair, this bottle has sat probably too long for the optimal flavor point, or whatever you want to call it, but it’s still quite tasty. It’s also downright quenching. This is a beer that I want to drink multiple glasses of, and feel like I could easily do so. Will definitely get this again!"
"750 ml bottle. Pours cloudy golden hue with a foamy, lasting white head. Aroma is of musty yeast, citrus fruit with hints of grass and spices. Full, creamy, slightly crisp body. Citrus fruit, spices, Belgium yeast and candy sugar combine on the palate. Medium, semi-sweet finish. I’m not a fan of wits, but this one I like."
"This beer poured out as a nice looking hazy orange color. The head was fizzy and kind of faded away rather quickly. The smell of the beer had some nice lively citrus aromas blended with a soft wheat character as well. The taste of the beer has a light herbal flavor to it with an orange or lemon flavor in there as well. The mouthfeel of this beer is smooth and lighter bodied. Overall this beer is pretty good for the warmer seasons. I would drink this one again if I found it at a reasonable price."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall a stunning beer that sadly falls short on the finish (it's kind of like a really hot/smart girl that sadly hasn't read a single book - you know... oh you're so pretty, oh you're so smart, oh... you don't read... awww.... I knew it was too good to be true....). But this is seriously one gorgeous looking beer!"
"M: The mouthfeel is spice-driven, so much so that the witbier base doesn't get as much airtime as it should. The wheat is present though, enough tartness to keep me interested."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer a bunch - DFH is my favorite brewer. At the same time, If I was looking for a super-citrusy beer from them, I'd probably locate a Hellhound and get lemon-crazy."
"O - overall, I enjoyed this beer. Great for the summer wheather, lighter, easier to drink. Somewhat pilsner meets wit. Yagman called it a good crossover beer for a fan of macro wits and,that pretty much hits it on the head."
"Yeasty aroma has fruity, spicy and malty hints. It pours a slightly hazy solar yellow with a minimal white head that still leaves some good lacing. Malty and wheaty flavor has a firm yeasty undertone and floral and fruity hints, and is very refreshing. Smooth texture has fairly firm body and a rather strong fizz, leaving behind a persistent tingle."
"Bright golden hue with long lasting white frothy head. Aroma of wheat, coriander, and orange peels. Tastes of citrus, orange peel, coriander, lemon zest, fresh hop bitterness finishes the drink with some light ginger flavor. High carbonation and spritzy. Refreshing, sessionable, tasty."
"overall - Looks great even from a distance and taste that delivers. Not top-tier, but great for a summer day!"
"This is a good beer that is all about the added spices. It has a wit base that almost goes into saison territory but ends up firmly planted in its lemon, citrus flavors. Refreshing and lighter, good for the summer."
"O - Overall a good witbier. Not something I would want everyday. A little thin in mouthfeel. I did enjoy the dry, spicy character."
"Tasty. A more than worthy witbier if you love this style, but I get sort of bored with the wit these days, so I can just admire from a distance really. It's not like I need Dogfish Head to throw tar and pickle juice into a beer to make me take notice...not at all. Although, hmm, I wonder what a Pickled Pils might taste like? I'll have to get Sam's #..."
"Note: Though this beer is great for the style and is very drinkable, it does break away from the ""off centered ale"" strategy that Dogfish works toward. This one is very much more standard than their other offerings."
"Although not an absolute top-level witbier, this brew most certainly asserts itself as the embodiment of summer in my opinion. Thoroughly enjoying a burger on my back porch with a tall, cool glass of Namaste crafted a lazy August summer evening that I will surely be repeating before long."
"O - The graininess of the wheat I thought outshined the fruitiness of the lemons and oranges. A good, average witbier that I thought could afford a bit better balance."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light, pale and wheat malt scent along with a mild coriander/orange peel spicing. The taste is good as well. It has a nice and refreshing pale and wheat malt flavor. It goes down easy with hints of coriander and lemongrass along with a faint bitter orange peel finish. The profile is dead on. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tasty beer with excellent witbier character; a wonderful example of the style."
"750ml bomber: This one pours a hazy straw-golden color. There was a bit of a white head on it that doesn’t linger long. Also, there were some ""floaties"" in the beer. There is a nice nose to it. Definitely coriander and yeast to the nose. Some wheat in there also, as well as some floral notes. The taste is good also. Wheat, coriander, and a slight dryness to the beer. Citrusy flavors also. Good, but a bit pricey for the style."
" light yeast flavor. Nice hints of peach and grss mixed in but both were very light and did not really contribute all that much to the overall approach. The finish was very dry and had an almost light wine like taste to it, very long and drawn out it was really very nice and a classic witbier."
"Pours a hazy gold color with two fingers of fluffy white foam. Big swaths of lace left on the glass. Smell: yeasty with some punchy sweet citrus, floral, with wheat and coriander notes. Taste: sugary pale, wheat cracker, tangy, coriander, a little clove-like spiciness, a fleshier orange like navel, lemon peel note. Medium bodied, creamy, dry spiciness midsip but juicy finish. Really nice. July 2011 release."
"Namaste might be the best American-made wit. It’s more citrusy than your average wit, adding to its refreshment and complexity."
"A pretty nice example of a Wit, the coriander character is actually pretty aggressive, but somehow I am enjoying its presence in this beer."
"This beer was light-bodied and refreshing. Perfect for a warm summer day."
"O: A nice witbier and glad I tried it, but it was missing something. If the mouthfeel wasn't so lean it would definitely get more points from me in the tasts. Otherwise, very easy to drink."
"O - Really glad I picked this one up as it was very refreshing on a hot summer day."
"A good beer, but it's nothing amazing."
"Another EXCEPTIONAL offering from DFH. Had this in a pint glass served out of one of DFH's large format bottles. This poured a very very light color, with a voluminous head, remniscent of pilsner. This was light in color and body, crisp, and an absolutely refreshing beer for a 104 degree day. This is the kinda beer you can slug. No need to nurse this one. I have another bottle I can't wait to lay into. I'll definitely be getting more."
"O - I'm kicking myself for not having this beer sooner. In fact, I plan on buying about 10 more. At 5% ABV, this could be a great session beer for these above 90 degree days we have getting latley."
"O: overall a good brew, but not impressed, as DFH has set the bar for many unique styles, this one falls a bit short."
"Namaste pours a pale, barely cloudy light yellow body with 2 inch fluffy head. Lacing lingers all over the wheat beer glass. Smell is bananas and faint citrus, really only what I expect from a witbier here. Taste is initially zesty and bold coriander, but then balances out with the crisp and clean lemon flavor. Banana taste is dominant. There is moderate carbonation and this is a light weight brew. Dogfish Head pretty much playing it safe here with a solid, but kind of boring witbier. I was expecting something more funky even though it's a witbier and I noticed the regular ingredients were used for this style of brew. It's okay and I'll leave it at that."
"O - Very good tastes, nicely balanced. I didn't find the yeast to be as prominent as in other Witbiers, but that didn't take anything away from the beer at all. I'd definitely get it again."
"Perfect beer for an afternoon on the porch, taking shelter in the shade. Wish I had purchased 2 growlers instead of 1..."
"Overall, a classy white beer; ideal for a meal where you want a lighter, pleasantly spiced beer to accompany the food"
"Carbonation was extreamly fine. The mouthfeel was smooth yet crisp (hops helped make it crisp) and the grain and hops were balanced. It was complex yet light. I though it was a excellent beer, especially since wheat is not my favorite ingrediant, but the hops strayed too much from the style for my taste."
"This tastes and feels great in my mouth... I pick up the coriander when I pull air across it. The orange and lemongrass merge nicely with each taste; neither is overwhelming. This is a very good tasting beer. Thank you, Sam."
"O: Quite a looker in the glass, but I'm slightly disappointed at the taste. It's just a bit subdued. That being said, its a godsend in the Texas summer. It's certainly a quality beer-- wonderfully refreshing and definitely worth a try, but at the end of the day it's got to compete for my dollar with the locally brewed (512) witbier."
"O: Overall I'm going to give this beer a A+ for what it is; an extremely refreshing summer witbier from Dogfish Head. I'm not a huge fan of the style, but this is a really tasty beer, and I'd drink this easily after a hot summer day being that it's only 5% abv. It's truly a pleasant experience to drink and won't get you too hammered. I recommend this beer!"
"Sweet yeasty fruit mixed with oranges and very soft sweet lemon flavors make this palate quite refreshing and flavorful. The mouthfeel is full of carbonation and a little chalky and dry. This only makes you want to drink more."
"Poured a light and cloudy dull gold with a fizzy head thanks to sharp/great carbonation that dies quick and is sitting atop a very sharp, lemony wheat aroma. Picking up a lot citric, mostly loemon with some orange (banana even?) and a spicey, clove-like smell as well w/ a touch of sweetness coming from somewhere. A great witbier to drink is what follows; a smooth, fluffy body thanks to the wheat/yeast that is real smooth and there's a good amount of balance to this beer as there's a sharpness as well thanks to spices and a sharp but not overpowering citric bite. Citric consists of lemon and some orange and there's again that touch of sweetness I can't identify. A well-balanced beer that alternates between spicy and sharp citric and throws in a touch of sweet stuff for a very enjoyable brew."
"Overall a killer summer refresher, and a great witbier one of my favorites."
"The mouthfeel is very good, it goes down very smoothly and easily. The drinkability is off-the-charts. I'd drink this all day every day if it were released in six-packs. As it stands now, it's too pricey for anything but an occasional treat. But what a treat it is! I hesitated when I was bringing this one up to the counter. ""Ten bucks for a style (at a low ABV) I don't usually love? What am I doing?"" Turns out the gamble was worth it, this is a delicious brew absolutely worthy of attention."
"A great summer beer, with an added dimension to most witbiers. Nice job."
"MO- Drinkable but not as refreshing as many other wits. I wouldn't turn it down."
"D- while not completely traditional, the careful craftsmanship and great balance of spices make this one of the best witbiers i've ever had. this one is entirely drinkable, chuggable, whatever, and on par with its belgian peers in that aspect, but a shot above in terms of aroma and flavor, and in the balance and quality of the ingredients used."
"A standout in a style I normally do not like that much. Belgian style, yet so pleasing to regular summer consumers by being both zesty and hoppy. Cloudy light grapefruit coloured body with tons of foam. Orange citrus is thee main taste, comes across as 45-55 ibu, lemongrass cushions the mouthfeel and leads to a nice aftertaste. Good flavour for such a basic abv. Smooth mouthfeel, creamy. Thanks for sharing, Doug."
"Taste shows some very good, classic witbier flavors; pithy orange, tangy wheat and coriander. Nice and flavorful, and the mouthfeel is ultra soft and creamy...like drinking a cloud. Falls near the top of the class as far as wits are concerned...but still...a $10 witbier? Seriously? This style deserves to be affordable and put down a few without thinking too much. Great beer, but for as good as it is, I cant really see buying this again."
"O: Another interesting brew by dogfish head. It was a refreshing beer to have to have on a hot day,"
"It looks and feels a bit like champagne. I like the spice and the citrus, and the light bubbly body. Quite refreshing, and a nice beer to drink on an 85-degree day. No major complaints, but nothing about it really wowed me."
"beer. This particular bottle had quite a bit of sediment in it."
"Served in a pilsener glass, the color was a nice hazy straw yellow with a huge frothy white head. Musty odor , a little farmlike with elements of lemon and coriander. Taste is a delicious clean wheat flavor, complemented nicely with lemongrass and citrus. This is a very easy drinking wheat; it would be a pleasure to enjoy this all summer."
"D - Very smooth beer, extremly refreshing, almost thirst quenching in a way. Easy to drink, I could see my self drinking this beer on a regualr basis if it was a year round option from DFH."
"Namaste pours a hazy tangerine, it seems a shade or two darker than most wits that I've had. The pristine white head rises up to about three fingers in height, and shows tremendous resilience. Lacing is a bit sparse though. The nose is very lemony, with coriander as the primary supporting aroma rather than orange. The flavor is quite crisp, yet dominated entirely by yeast/spice notes. Lemongrass's influence is still the star here, though the flavor seems a bit more citrusy than the nose. Coriander is still present as a background note again. The body is nice and light and the carbonation starts out incredibly lively but dies down by the back end of each sip and avoids being too fizzy. Lemongrass is a wonderful addition to the standard witbier flavors, and helps make this one of my absolute favorite warm weather beers. As much as I do like Festina Peche, I find myself wishing this was available in 12oz bottles all summer."
"The closest thing I have smelled to the strange funk of this beer has only been present in some Saisons and that one time I tried Lindemans Faro. As the type of person who seeks out the strange and unusual freak beers, I heartily endorse this oddity. :)"
"A very nice summer beer with wheat beer character. It is light and very drinkable for those hot days, especially with that low 5 percent ABV."
"Tatse - Spicy and citrusy with a soft mineral finish. Just enough hops to tie it all together."
"Overall: Thanls to inlimbo77 for this great beer. I like it a lot, and that is saying something, since I udually dont care for this style. Good job Sam and company for another winner."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink, refreshing and thirst quenching."
"Finish: Crisp and refreshing. Goes down smooth and with a nice body of flavors. Very well done"
"O- This is a good witbier that is very refreshing and easy to drink."
"Overall this is an enjoyable witbier from Dogfish Head, hard to say if I'd buy multiples, perhaps moreso if this was in 6ers. Nonetheless this is a highly drinkable spring beer for this rainy, wet streak we have going."
"O: Refreshing."
"O: It's a pretty nice and well rounded hefeweizen. The addition of the lemongrass was an excellent choice. It's a pretty good beer, but I am not finding the urge to have another. It's interesting, but isn't the best hefeweizen I've had. It lacks balance."
"My friend and I, who enjoyed this with me at the brewpub, realized that Namaste is best when paired with food. It's a tasty summer brew then!"
"A solid summertime beer. Good take on a witbier from Dogfish Head."
"D - A simple refreshing beer... Very straightforward... Nothing edgy or provocative about this one (something I have come to expect and relish in other DFH offerings)... A nice spring / summer offering... There's nothing ""wrong"" with this one, but not something I would highly recommend either..."
"Namaste!"
"Sorry Dogfish Head, but I found another brew of yours I don't care for. Pours a hazy yellow with a nice white head, with a light aroma of crisp, floral hops. It gets points for being very refreshing and easily drinkable. However...where was the taste? I can't believe I'd say such a thing about a DFH brew, but there was almost no flavor in this at all, which was disappointing after reading the ingredients. Bear in mind: refreshing? yes; quaffable? yes; flavorful? no."
"O- Overall a very solid wit that I could see purchasing again."
"overall: nice wit, lemongrass plays well"
"Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was the twinge of lemongrass in the aroma and the taste. The aroma is actually the most robust and striking part of the brew, with all of the proper components popping. There was a lot going on in the taste, especially with the myriad of citrus going on, but nothing important was lost. Where it did lose points was in the carbonation, which did become a bit overwhelming."
"A straw yellow hazy beer with creamy head that faded slow and left creamy walls of lace. The smell was of belgian yeast with banana and clove nicely balanced in the middle and citrus tones of orange and lemon grass on the back end. Nice honey, caramel and biscut notes with a good grainy wheat backbone. Nice citrus notes of orange and lemon subtly perk things up. Creamy body. It goes light on the banana in the yeast flavors and the spice is subtle too. Just a pinch of clove and pepper. Smooth, creamy, and very drinkable."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a nice lighter but flavorful beer to drink for a while."
"Pours a hazed light gold color, poof of frothy white head that lingers and leaves decent lacing. Scent is very floral with herbal qualities and fresh dried wheat - lemongrass lends great charachter along with juicy orange and spice (corriander and light pepper). Taste immediately suprises the palate with a pleasent floral taste, the lemongrass adds subtle complexity (much prefered to lemon rind) and mingles with the fresh dried grain, some herbal qualities come through before notes of orange and light nutty spice hit. Medium bodied, carbonation a tick below others in the style which adds to the beer. A pleasent suprise, uses some unique and high quality ingredients to make a best in class Wit."
"D - Wow, this is surprisingly good. I am not generally a fan of witbier, but the balance between the wheat and the spices here works exceptionally well. The lemongrass the lemongrass is a really nice touch, it helps cut through the cloying thickness that many other wits seem to develop and it makes the beer taste much brighter. Unusually drinkable and very much worth trying."
"O: Really a pleasant beer. Reminiscent of summer. Not really my cup of tea, I don't think that I would ever seek this beer out but it was enjoyable to have it once and I could see some people really going for it. Big on the spice, citrus and yeast and a nice wheat beer."
"Upon opening this beer, the citrus smells just made me smile. It truly does hold that ""Summer-time"" feel. The pour produced a nice rich white head which lasted for quite sometime. The color was a golden sheen. As it drank down, the lacing left just a soft amount on the glass, but it's to be expected from this wheat beer. The taste was refreshingly good, but not as complex as I was hoping. I did enjoy the citrus notes and drinkability of it though. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice, clean, and refreshing evening beer to accompany good ""porch-sitting weather"" of the summer months."
"Overall, I was really impressed with this offering from DFH. Lately a lot of their experimental beers have been interesting but just extreme for the sake of being so. Interesting experiments but not terribly enjoyable. One and done kind of beers. This beer, on the other hand, was complex and flavorful and I will definitely be buying it again, especially with summer coming around."
"The taste is nothing short of amazing. Loads of orange is definitely there, with heaps of coriander as well. Just a very flavorful wit all around. This is how you do it. The slightly grainy wheat shows up just after, along with a small zing at the back which I'll assume is the lemongrass. Perhaps the best wit I have ever had, and that's saying something when it's considered that this is one of my very favorite styles."
"Very nice beer. I'd much rather have it in a set of affordable 12oz bottles, than a single $10 750, but I'll probably buy again anyway."
"O - I am surprised at how little, if at all, this beer pushed the limits. There is really nothing ""off-centered"" about it. It is a good, not great, representation of the style. I feel it lacks the character of wheatiness that should be present in a wit. I will not be seeking this out again."
"O - Excellent representation of the style. Does not push the envelope at all but completely nails the style. This is a very good and easy to drink beer. I will keep this one on hand for my friends that always order those mass produced and artificial tasting witbiers"
"Overall: this is a very quaffable beer and at the 5% ABV level, a bunch of glasses can easily be consumed in a session. Well balanced and nicely flavored, this one will have you looking for some more when the glass is empty."
"Namaste"
"On tap at Papago. Well hazed body with a meringue head. Patchy lace. Nose is quite spicy, with notes of white pepper and coriander. Flavor is zesty with orange peel and spicy with coriander. Herbal, tea-like notes come through, especially in the finish. Body is medium for style, pretty light overall. Carbonation leaves the mouthfeel slick and the finish dry. Very drinkable and nice for those warm days. Good for style."
"The taste is of wheat and lemongrass. The lemongrass really shines in this brew. Also, coriander, orange, floral notes, flowery yeast, white tea and some light spices that I can't nail down. A light dry mouthfeel and nicely balanced between sweet and tart. Very well done DFH."
"This beer had a hazy appearance with small bits of sediment; although, it had a nice citrus, floral nose. Amazing taste as if you're biting into a fresh orange that finishes with lingering hints of lemongrass on the palate. A refreshing brew for warmer weather."
"Drinkability – Quaffable to say the least. Dogfish did a great job crafting a witbier with a unique flair. Refreshing with a good mix of fruit and spice."
"D: This an easy to like, drinkable beer."
"D- 3.5 Not well-enough balanced for me to enjoy much of this. I could split the 750mL but wouldn't want much more. It is a bit sour and over-carbonated. I can get some of the ingredients that were used and I appreciate that, but they just didn't work as well together as I had hoped they would. Worth a shot I suppose."
"Additional Notes: Requires a weekend nap."
"If more witbiers were similar to Namaste, I would probably drink the style more often. This is a great beer with much to offer the senses."
"O - Awesome twist from DFH and not surprised at all, can't wait to enjoy this under the sun next time, very easy to drink, with that being said i almost wish it had more of an alcohol presence. yes i understand it is a wit but maybe a little more kick would be nice. The biggest knock i have on this brew is its $11 dollar price tag a bit steep to me."
"3.0 D: This has some problems with carbonation foremost. This beer started out so well. It looked great and smelled better, but the house of cards fell down with the taste. The flavor is too light for my liking. This would be a good lawnmover beer, but not for the price."
"O: A very tasty refreshing beverage."
"Pours a pale, slightly cloudy straw color with a pure white head that sticks around as medium cap and leaves some decent lacing. Nice spicy and lemony aromas, with a particularly nice floral hit of lemongrass. The taste is a bit more subtle, with a gentleness overall, some very light spice notes, some decent lemongrass, and a soft finish. The beer could use a little more crispness, and a little more depth of flavor, but overall it's fairly intriguing and quite refreshing."
"Medium body, fairly light carbonation...nice mouth feel and drinks easy as pi. Darn good beer."
"Overall: I good flavorful Witbier. Nice flavors and mouthfeel and a good refreshment quality."
"Hay colored with a haze, fair head retention with a little lace and plenty of carbonation. Hay and a touch of citrus in the aroma. Nice carbonation profile up front and in the middle. Grain, coriander, and lemongrass are present in the middle with a little bit of soap on the back end. Faint bitterness. Medium body leaning toward the light side."
"I'd buy this more often if it came in a 6er. I got this one at a discount, but would probably not get more at full big-bottle prices."
"The wife and I are not much into light wheat beers but found this to be exceptionally tasty and refreshing. This is a great beer for a hot day. It has a nice yellowish color and goes down very smooth. Dogfish Head makes some amazing beers and most being 8-10% alcohol, this is only 5% but does not disappoint. All in all a another great beer from Dogfish Head."
"O: Overall, a decent witbier, but it doesn't really stand out from the crowd much. Just another coriander and orange-packed witbier."
"O: A nice clean bear for its class. Nothing impressive for dogfish but never the less good."
"Taste is very light and crisp. Easy drinking and smooth. Mouthfeel is sharp and light. It's a mellow beer and not crazy... Almost peaceful."
"Great flavor, above average drinkability. Pretty straight-forward. Definitely worth it if you dig wits."
"I give this high marks for the emphasis on coriander and the excellent mouthfeel. Can you say extremely drinkable craft beer?"
"Well done."
"This is a good wit that I am enjoying, but it doesn't blow me away the way that Allagash White does; and since that is a local beer here, I'll go for a bottle of that next time I am craving this style. That isn't to say you shouldn't give this beer a shot, it is a very well made beverage that is worth a taste."
"O: I liked it and am glad I got to try it. Very refreshing and easy to drink. Thanks again Mark for hooking it up!"
"Overall I was a fan of this beer however it's not quite clean enough to take a place in the upper tier. Still, an easy-drinking beer that will be great for warmer months."
"D - This has good drinkability. It goes down easy and I really like the flavor. It is refreshing, and I could definitely drink a few of these in a sitting. Overall, I think this is a good beer, and I'd try it again."
"Smells like lemons. What a refreshing delight, what with its super bubbly personality. Giant cumulus head magically parts at the command of my gob. High quench factor with little bitter in this spicy concoction. What a dry ride this one was. Get it. My gob commands it."
"750ml shared with my buddy, poured into stemless wine glass. Opaque straw yellow, very yellow, white three finger head that leaves some belgian lacing around the glass. The aroma is heavy on the spices, with coriander and lemongrass dominating and orange peal playing second fiddle. Orange, coriander and citrus on the front of the palate and than all lemongrass to the finish. The lemongrass is a huge flavor, it does however play well with the rest of the beer. Nice wheaty flavor pairs well with the spices and some fruity yeast twang can be found too. Well bodied for a smaller ale. Overall Dogfish succeeded on this one, albeit with a bit too much lemongrass flavor."
"Overall Im glad I tired it but unfortunately the Hennepin I just cooked with has noticeably more flavor than this."
"Bottle poured into a snifter. This is a fizzy cloudy pale yellow, with a very foamy inch of head. Smell is sour and dominated by lemon with a strong mix of cloves and coriander spiciness. Taste is extremely spicy.. again heavy on the cloves and coriander with some peppercorn-ish flavors as well. Very light bodied and easy to drink. Lots of orange and lemon flavors as well. Mouthfeel is foamy and creamy."
"Good tasty wit with lots of good characteristics and some uniqueness in the flavor profile. Would have again. Very refreshing."
"Light body with refreshing carbonation. Very easy to drink. Not the most exciting style, but simple and well done."
"Opinion: I think that I can now say that I have a favorite spiced beer. I had liked some of the Christmas Ales, and I don't know if the Brasserie De Rocs beers count as spiced, but this is a world class Witbier, no doubt. Sam did this beer just the way it should have been done, and I must say that I am impressed. I paid around $9 for this bottle, so unfortunately isn't cheap...but I would definitely recommend that you give this one a shot."
"Overall: Rather refreshing and thirst quenching, a fine beer suitable for drinking in the drearily warmer months ahead of us."
"O - Overall, this is another good one from Dogfish. I quite enjoyed it, and it would really hit the spot on a hot Alabama day in July."
"This is just one beer that doesn't quite suit my tastes right now. I would certainly recommend a bottle to try, though. I think I'll give this one another go after a round of golf in hot/humid July afternoon."
"O--This is a great offering from Sam and the guys at Dogfish. I could imagine sitting out on the beach this summer drinking these all day. One of the best witbiers out there."
"Wish I would have known about this one a few years ago. Really enjoyed this one and I'm looking forward to more."
"Another score from DFH. A perfect spring beverage for everyone...well over 21."
"D: A very nicely crafted and highly drinkable witbier from DFH; perfect for the impending warmth of early spring. I'd love to pair it with a lemon-broiled monkfish or light, nutty cheese."
"D - A good expression of a Witbier, very refreshing."
"O- A real disappointment from what I'm used to with this brewery. I would say this is the first time that Dogfish really totally flopped for me, I drain poured the last 10 ounces. Unless I've had a bad bottle which I dont think thats the case I would say to avoid this brew and try the many other fine Witbiers on the market."
"D: I wanted to hate on this, mainly because I'm tired of the hype surrounding DFH, but I have to admit I found it very fitting on this warm Spring day. It's very well balanced and you can tell care was taken to do this one right, nothing fancy, none of the headline-making, publicity whoring DFH has become known for, just a well conceived and executed beer."
"Namaste is a common spoken greeting in India that means, literally, ""I bow to you"". All of us need to bow to Dogfish Head Craft Brewery for creating one of the most unique and delicious witbiers in America. Six-packs please. Bottom line: lovely lemongrassy libation."
"D-A light easy drinker. Only 5% abv. One of the better examples at incorporating a good lemon flavor."
"D: overall, refreshing, but almost too easy to drink. like i said above, if there was more of a bread character/richness i think it would be much more enjoyable."
"D - Great drinkability, excellent spring/summer beer!"
"The body is light to medium with a very nice sparkling carbonation present. The dry finish has no notes of alcohol and this beer is very drinkable and enjoyable. A success from Dogfish Head."
"D - This brew is light and refreshing, has many nice layers, enjoy now or set one aside for the summer months when it will be really pleasing."
"Cheers."
"Super drinkable, the back label says it's a ""summer kind of thing, namaste."" They're right, get one now and save it for the warm weather, it's a perfect compliment to it."
"Dogfish Namaste is a fantastic white beer and is delicious! Way better then a blue moon, shock top, etc garbage beers! Its in the same class as Allagash white! It more then lives up to the expectations of what a white beer should be and the history behind the name adds to the greatness that we expect from Dogfish Head Brews! Let the Haze consume you and delight in the Namaste!!"
"D: Extremely easy to drink given the light body and 5% abv. It might get boring after a couple bottles though"
"Alas, this is not my style. Would be good on a hot summer day, but just one for me. Too rich in the banana-like, herbal spice yeast. Otherwise, though, it's a good beer for the style."
"D - Really nice great for the style. I would say a great representation of the sytle."
"Enjoyed on tap at the Fairfax brewpub in Virginia this witbier shows a cloudy light yellow color with a nice white cover and good lacing. It reveals a bready light citrus lemon smell that includes a slight peppery quality. The flavor offers a classic white ale theme that includes a light banana-lemon subtle idea over sodabread and oak. It is medium light bodied with a slightly aqueous feel over firm carbonation. Very drinkable like most of this variety and a better than average version."
"Poured into a dfh 12 oz fluted bass glass. Golden straw color with plenty of carbonation and cloudyness. Lovely lemongrass and coriander aroma with a smooth frothy head. Medium head retention with minimal lacing. Taste backed the nose as a lemony wheat malt cascaded with floral hops balance this one nicely. Wonderful velvety mouthfeel and drinkability was a bit nicer as the beer warmed a bit."
"Overall: I am a huge fan of wheat beers, and I was interested in the use of lemon grass. This is not the best wheat beer I have ever had; however, it does offer new flavors in an old favorite. It is refreshing and slightly sweet. Yet, the sweet is tamed by the the bitterness of the lemon and the herbaceous notes of grass. It would make an excellent quencher on a warm day, and would match well with fish or lemon chicken."
"D: Had mine with a piece of chipolte salmon in a Tai lime chili sauce, very good together."
"Pours a hazy straw yellow color with a nice two finger head which gives way to some lacing on the glass. The aroma is of citrus and lemongrass with a hint of honey as well. The taste has a nice citrus flavor along with a big lemongrass taste. There are hints of honey as well along with a wheat backbone. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. The drinkability is high a nice mellow flavor that is well blended on top of being an easy drink. You could easily have multiple servings of these."
"(D)- An easy crisp drinker with fresh fruit tastes. Great for a summer afternoon."
"D: Nice drinkability, though towards the end of the bottle you will start feeling the slowdown a bit. A bright zing brings a good start to the drink, while a bomber should suffice and be a good example per style."
"D: Yes, this would make an excellent summer Wit. Great taste and easy drinking."
"Poured from 750ml bottle into snifter glass. Pours a hazy straw gold color with an inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. The brew smells like coriander, orange peel, wheat and some yeast. It tastes like oranges, lemon peel, coriander, wheat and a bit of peppery spice. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's crisp and is well carbonated. Drinkability is very good, it's nice, refreshing and really easy to drink."
"Thanks cam!"
"Pours a murky golden yellow with a good amount of white head. Lots of carbonation on this one. Smells wheaty and citrusy. Lots of coriander on the nose. On the tongue there is tons of orange and coriander. Not a lot more on the tongue honestly but it's very good. High carbonation and a good mouthfeel."
"Medium to full bodied for the style. I liked this, but it was a bad idea to attempt the 750ml on my own. The whole bottle was a bit much to drink in a sitting."
"D: Not my favorite Dogfish Head but one of the nicest wit's that I have had."
"Light bodied and effervescent, which makes it a bit filling. Still a nice drinker even on a Mid-January day!"
"This has to be one of my favorite releases this year. The beer is a light brew with a wonderfull birght gold color to it. The head forms perfectly with out any help and leaves lacing down the glass. The aroma in the brew was of a spice and fruit background to me with some earthy tones. THe taste was a light crisp and packed with flavor. Mouthfeel was perfect and not to carbonated and the light ABV% makes this beer my session beer of the year. Love it and keep it stocked in the fridge when ever I see it."
"Pours a clear golden color with a big white head that dissipates quickly. The smells is very sweet with lemon and grass. Also clove is detected. The Taste is mostly a combination of the grass and lemon. It is very interesting, I dont like it but I dont hate it. The beer is very drinkable and has a good mouthfeel. Overall decent but didnt win me over to buy it regularly. Its definitely more of a summer beer too."
"The appearance is a bright golden yellow beer with a fluffy head that quickly declines into a ring. Also lots of floating good stuff in this beer. This beer smells like summer for sure, I detect lemon, lime, an almost sour edge to the mild grass and clover essence. This bottle tasted very thin and bitter. I detected a strong lemon tartness and I detected the coriander in the background. This is a very refreshing and mild brew a good relaxer."
"As to drinkability, I found it quite accessible. It's easy to drink, and it's got enough character to keep you coming back for more. Whether that character fits your taste buds is another question, but it's not really that bold to begin with so I doubt that anyone will find it off-putting. Worth trying!"
"D - This would definitely be one of my top picks for a great summer beer, and one of the better witbiers I've had. I could drink this all day."
"Drinkability: I really wish I could get this beer in six pack form, this would be my new go-to lawnmower beer for sure! Nothing is overdone. The citrus elements are tactful and well executed, the spice from the coriander is subtle and not too sharp, and the malts used to brew this beer provide just enough depth to make this a interesting beer to sip. At 5.0% ABV, this is a more approachable Dogfish Head concoction as it goes down like a charm. Bravo to Sam and everybody down in coastal Deleware!"
"Nice job Dogfish Head, as always"
"d- really nice, this dfh offering really impressed me, i'm hoping they'll make this one again. i enjoyed this back in november on a chilly night but it would be perfect on a summer afternoon."
"D: This is a good beer. Fits a niche desire. Although subtle, offer a complex variety of experience. Don't pass up, but don't expect a big beer. This is a slow, grows on you kind of beer."
"This is a very drinkable beer and is very enjoyable to drink. Very session worthy."
"One and done here. Granted, this probably would taste better if it wasn't so dang cold outside."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Namaste forges few gripes in my mind. Well-crafted through & through. Plus, at 5% abv it's a easy sipper for sure. Fully enjoyable even in this Ohio winter."
"D: I'm definitely picking up more of this next summer and drinking it when it's hot outside."
"D: This is most definitely a summer beer, very light in body and has a low ABV. Although I am not a huge light beer fan, this is a decent beer, but I wouldn't recommend drinking it in the winter."
"A good white beer, but pricey for what it is."
"Taste begins moderately sweet coupled with lemongrass again, moderately tart in the middle, and closes with light earthy bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is excellent. Very refreshing and thirst-quenching brew."
"Not bad but I'd rather have a six pack of Hoegaarden for the money..."
"ours a golden straw color with a nice 2 finger white head that recedes to some nice lacing ...smell is lemon grass, coriander,citrus peel and some clove .taste follows the nose with light lemon and citrus but light on flavor but its a witbier ..mouth feel is well carbonated,but a bit thin on the taste ..it is a tasty witbier..its very drinkable and well done for the style"
"The Namaste pours a dark straw yellow on the verge of light orange with a very light white head that circles the glass. It's definitely light but does have moderate cloudiness. The smell is superb. It features coriander, orange peel, barnyard funkiness, and subtle sweetness. The flavor is good as satisfying. It's got excellent coriander and orange accents and has an orange like sweetness. The yeastiness is well contained and this beer drinks very well. It just doesn't have the same mouthfeel, same smoothness that is typical of DFH 750s, then again it is a much lighter beer. This beer is delicious and is an excellent wheat."
"To my knowledge, Namaste is an Indian greeting that means ""bow to you."" The label alludes to something similar. I'm not sure that there's any real Indian tie to this beer, but there doesn't need to be. It's a damn tasty Witbier that's worthy of your attention. The nose is extremely impressive. The flavor could maybe use a few more amps on the coriander/orange peel to really ramp it up, but I can't complain. I really enjoyed this, and I'm not a huge fan of the style."
"Pours golden yellow with a very thin head that recedes to the edges immediately then lingers for the duration of the drink. Smells of herbs and spice with light peppery and yeast notes. The taste is light with faint hints of orange, tea, sugar and wheat. The mouth feel is small, easy to drink and you could easily down the entire bottle without thinking twice since the beer is only 5% ABV. Definitely a summer brew but tasty none the less. The beer finishes with a crisp slightly bitter but clean flavor without a strong after taste. Definitely a recommendation for the spring and summer months."
"Lightly bitter, finishing dry, with a smooth wheat body. Citrus and coriander flavors are dominant but not overbearing. It feels a little astringent, but overall it's not a distraction. Fairly easy to drink, probably better suited for warmer months, but enjoyable nonetheless. Will try again if another batch is released."
"Drinkability is very good, only draw back would be price. DFH and me have love hate relationship some things they do are great some are wtf were they thinking. This is defiantly very well done and I'm loving it."
"Ommegange Witte was better but my favorite is Great Lakes Grassroots Ale (formerly Great Lakes Hale Ale). Both of those are more affordable and more available but Namaste remains a good beer that I would be proud to serve."
"Overall, a solid wit that ranks near the top for me. Nice strong aroma and bite in the taste to keep it interesting. Wish this one was available more often and near me. Not avail here in TX so shipped back from my Dayton trip. Rotation - if here and in 12oz bottles would be a heavy player in my wit/wheat rotation. Even in large format, I'd still get plenty. [R;Y]"
"Pours a hazy yellow with a brief but sudsy head that leaves little evidence that it had ever been there. Great flavors of the advertised orange, coriander, and lemon grass. Distinct notes of each throughout. Low alcohol and medium body makes this a very drinkable beer though the lemony after-taste can get a bit tiresome."
"Drinkability: quite a drinkable and refreshing brew. I think after awhile I would get tired of the flowery flavors, but for one bottle I think it's quite tasty."
"Mouthfeel: Pretty thin much like the head there isn't much to this beer."
"D: slightly disappointed for Dogfish head. Not very complex."
"D-at 5%, i'd say this is the most drinkable of the dogfish head 750mL bottles. the taste stays great, it goes down easily...what more could you ask for?"
"750mL bottle into a tulip glass pours a nice murky pale orange with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is a nice amount of sweet fruits and spices. The taste is a nice amount of sweet malts and fruits with lemon zest and coriander. The beer is quite light, crisp and refreshing with smooth carbonation. This is a very respectable wit, one I'd certainly have again."
"Overall- Great beer, very drinkable, liking this even more than I was anticipating. This would be great on a warm summer afternoon, not to sure why it didn't get distributed till the fall? If dogfish makes a ""normal"" beer, especially in large format bottles, this would be it. This would be a good cross-over beer into the craft world as well."
"Another extremely different brew from DFH, while quite interesting, not sure I'd get this one again."
"Drinkability - extremely drinkable, and a great example of a wit. Could drink a number of these if not for the fairly high price point. Would like to see Dogfish add this one as a repeating seasonal. Fantastic brew."
"Overall: I would almost say this borders closely to a saison as far as taste and texture. I had the opportunity to have this on tap and much prefer the bottle. You get more of the nuances from the bottle conditioning. This should be in the regular DFH rotation."
"Possibly the most drinkable of the entire Dogfish line. Very quenching and an ideal warm weather beer."
"D: I think this would be a good summer quencher. Which makes me wonder why we didn't get it until November."
"Close to a finger of bone white head, sort of dilute foam, no density with many larger bubbles, as a result, very little retention, lacing fares better, not many streaks but the ones there stick around. Pale golden orange color, however, has a nice luminescence to it which fills the glass, on the whole transparent but with a serious gauziness. Fresh and open nose, full but not close to heavy, the orange peel matches up with the coriander, nutmeg, cinnamon spice, maybe even a touch salty at times, the lemongrass stays in the background, nothing herbaceous going on here, by the same token the cocoa nibs about all you get for malts, as advertised citrus and spices 99% of what you find in your nostrils. Medium-bodied, foams up a good deal to increase palate coverage, little room for lift. More all of this heft, mouth feel is smooth and there's no roughness nor bitterness to be found. Orange, lemon, traces of white grapefruit citrus abound. Coriander, cumin, clove and ginger spice more sweet than zesty, hence the smoothness. You get more yeasty, leesy accents here, suggestion of banana too. The peach, apricot, yellow apple fruit simply stated. Easy to drink, if there's any nuisance it's the carbonation."
"Notes: Nicely crafted and well taken care of offering from DFH. Nothing outstanding though, and feeling rather safe, but almost saying it as a compliment. However it feels a tad overpriced for what one finds in the end."
"D - If it wasn't 40 degrees out and was instead summer I'd be able to have a few of these and enjoy it."
"This is a very easy drinking and enjoyable brew. It is light to medium bodied with a high level of carbonation. Overall it is well balanced yet bold with it's flavor and scent for the style. The lemony aspect could be tamed down a bit but it was a pleasure to drink and probably the best example of the style I have had in recent memory despite the exaggerated lemon flavor. This beer needs to be around come summertime next year."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, faint orange citrus, lemon grass and somewhat earthy. In the taste, orange notes, dry earthiness and lemon grass. A spice bite and light to a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry orange to coriander like aftertaste. Almost saison like, mellow with a nice spice profile."
"Tasty, and very refreshing, would make an excellent match for seafood or salad. Highly recommended(especially in summer)."
"was also present in the taste, however for the smell, the spice flavor was not nearly as intense as expected. Flavor left quickly after swallowing. Light, very drinkable, but the aroma and flavor will keep you wanting more. A great and aweful beer to practice trying to pick out smells and flavors. And glad I can say I finally had something that Kevin Patterson hadn't had before. Harumph!"
"750 ml bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a hazy straw gold color with an inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. The brew smells like coriander, orange peel, wheat and some yeast. It tastes like oranges, lemon peel, coriander, wheat and a bit of peppery spice. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's crisp and is well carbonated. Drinkability is very good, it's nice, refreshing and really easy to drink. It's a great choice for a summer day or an unseasonably warm 65 degree mid-November day like today is. I think this is a good overall brew, nice and sessionable. I'd like to see this beer put in a 6-pack, but I'll still buy bombers of this."
"Notes: very refreshing, perfectly done wit."
"A delicious Witbier with sharp aggression towards the spicy and aromatic notes, yet perserving the delicate and soft textures that make classic Witbiers so refreshing and thirst quenching."
"Overall: A good beer to kick back and read a book with."
"D - Its a good beer, if the flavour combination is yout thing. For me it just didnt work. Maybe paired with the right food it would pop a little better. The flavour is spot on, but that mouthfeel is just far too thin."
"A solid beer overall. I don't get the hate for it."
"Poured into a tulip. The body is a hazy yellow-golden color with a white head and some pretty good lacing. The nose is nice with some light citrus notes--mostly orange and lemon. A bit of grain as well. The flavor is pretty nice though a bit one-dimensional with citrus. Good, light body and nice carbonation. Drinks quite well and is a nice hot-weather brew."
"This beer pours a hazy yellow with a little head that did last. Overall this beer kinds stinks, smells strongly of wheat and lemon. Has a nice complex taste alot of wheat flavors, strong orange and lemon flavors. A light flavor, but very easy to drink. Overall a complex and very good wheat beer."
"Pours a slightly hazy, bright golden color with a one-finger white head. Head retention is light and lacing is minimal. The aroma is dominated by lemongrass and coriander. You also can pick out some yeastiness and a little orange peel if you search for it. As with the aroma, the taste is almost entirely lemongrass and coriander with ligher hints of orange and yeast and virtually no alcohol noticeable. It's a fairly clean taste, but I'd really like to taste the base beer more and the adjuncts less. The body is a bit light on this one with moderate carbonation and no alcohol warming. Not overly drinkable because of the dominance of the lemongrass and coriander and the relative lack of complexity. It doesn't help either that I'm not a huge fan of witbiers. This one is probably not worth the pricetag unless you really love lemongrass and coriander."
"D: I guess I just don't ""get"" most of these Dogfish Head beers. I think the ideas are generally cool/interesting, but I don't always find they translate well in application."
"Good beer that brings a bit of welcome innovation to the style. This could be a one-session bomber."
"Drinkability is great. I really hope DFH brings this one back next summer. A perfect, refreshing summer afternoon beer. Quaffable and tasty. Not extreme like most of DFH's beers, but very well done. Worth picking up if you're looking for a balanced, tasty, easy drinking beer."
"Overall I am very impressed with this offering. A unique take on a witbier, but they do a good job."
"Thanks, Andrew. A cloudy straw body is topped by a small white head that drops to a thin collar. Smells like herbal tea and wheat bread. Lemongrass and coriander both come through very very strongly. The adjuncts are overpowering, as usual with DFH. Tastes of watery herbal tea, white bread, white pepper and strong coriander. Spices linger on the tongue in the finish. Not necessarily awful, but not good - it's over spiced yet somewhat watery."
"A very good wit and very drinkable."
"The mouthfeel is as light as the taste making this exceptionally drinkable and refreshing."
"D: The only downside to this beer is the price. We got this in PA and split it with some friends down there. Good beer but unless it was a lot cheaper I would not go for it again. Refreshing summer drinker."
"D: This is an easy to drink Witbier, perfect for the hot summers."
"Sweet wheat, tart grass, lemon, coriander (big time), some peppered elements, light bitterness, a little husk-like, maybe some bee-pollen. Fairly clean finish. Lighter bodied, tastes like a good summer wit with a citric twist. Goes down ok. I know I'd enjoy this more in the summer. Still good and worth the try."
"D- Sorry to say that I had this on a cold and rainy New England day; it would be much better on a hot summer day. That said, this is still a top witbeer in my mind."
"Pours a hazy pale golden hue with a bright white head, fine bubbled creamy textured head forms thick and leaves behind scattered lace. Aroma is so nice a full on assault of coriander citrus peels and lemongrass notes. Sharp bright wheat note as well it works together well, I really enjoy just smelling this stuff. Flavor wise this is an excellent witbier, it's rare to see any beer brewed this much to style. Other than the lemongrass there's not much stray from a typical wit and this is an excellent fresh version of one. Heavy on the coriander, for those sensitive to it this won't be your beer, but it's definitely a rounded coriander. It's complemented with orange peel bitterness and lemon grass herbal tones, soft wheat creamy character this is excellent stuff. Mouthfeel has sturdy but smooth carbonation creamy body carries itself well light to medium in girth. Clean spicy finish these spices don't sit on the palate the carbonation and citrus helps to clear the coriander. Drinkability overall is excellent a really drinkable version of a dead on American brewed witbier. I would get more but not for 10 to 12 bucks a 750ml bottle."
"Now where did I put that triple imperial?"
"D - Great drinkability. Super light, easily could down a bunch of these due to the low ABV (5%) and the overall lightness of the style. I bought a bottle after tasting since my fiance (who isn't a real beer drinker let alone a hoppy IPA DFH drinker) really loved this beer. An overall good beer for its style....Cheers!"
"D -A beer I consider to be pure refreshment- I was surprised by this but happy w/ how good it was. I could enjoy this for hours and it is clean and refreshing w/out sacrificing flavor."
"Smells exactly like how I would think Lemongrass smells... it also has that orange and witbier type smell to it. It also has a nice straw like hazy appearance with some sediment in it as the rest of the bottle is poured into the glass. The taste is awesome with that lemon taste and that smooth orange taste that gets bitter at the end of the sip. The bitterness is different than you'd find in most beers because of the orange taste melding together with the lemon taste. The bitterness is like licking the inside skin of an orange I like it. Also has a nice dry wheat backing to finish everything off. Excellent beer... and I was surprised to see the low alcohol content on the bottle making the drinkability awesome. Great summer beer that I hope they keep making. Not to mention I love the name Namaste because its a spiritual word meaning soul. Great name and a great beer especially for a witbier. The best witbier I've tasted hands down!"
"D: Very drinkable, while it isn't one of my most favorite beers, I would probably have another if the other beers available were less desirable."
"D: Goes down easily, nicely balanced, mild kick, nice representation of style. I really enjoy this beer - a little too heavy for summer drinking but on a nice early autumn night, this is really refreshing."
"d - A pretty good witbier. Lots of oranges and lemon in the smell and taste. Would definitely try again."
"My wife hated it of course....just like she does most beer. Oh well...."
"This is a pretty good witbier, that being said appearance and smell aside this beer is nothing extrordinary. The beer pours cloudy gold with a thin off white head. The beer smells intensely of itrus praticularly orange and lemon. The taste is strong of the fruits and coriander, with a wheaty finish. Hals light carbonation, and given the brewer overall it seems light. A perfect sipper for the summer though"
"Beer is creamy and medium bodied overall. Its nice and clean, bright and citrusy, both my wife and I completely enjoyed this beer. Very excellent."
"It's pale straw colored, not as hazy or golden as it should be, and the nose is also something of a disappointment, as it's a weak clove and not much else. It picks up citrus flavors (the dried orange is prominent and delicious) and a tangy wheat background in the taste, without really delivering on the spice until the finish, and then it's coriander, not so much cloves. Very light, low-carbonation body--I wasn't in love with this beer, but it's a good refreshing Wit and I'm glad I was able to try it while it was still out."
"D: Disappointing for DFH. Decent by other standards."
"The beer poured a super murky yellowish/light orange. Head was about a half inch and disipates into a thin layer ontop of the beer. The nose is minimal with hints of earthy hay and some lemony scents as well. The beers flavor is well balanced with a good bit of citrus, coriander, and a light belgian yeast spicyness. Medium body that is quite drinkable. not what I expected from DFH, but not a bad beer. Might get another bottle to enjoy some other summer day."
"D- Very easy to drink whole bottle in one sitting, maybe even 2 or 3, and great for summer. A very nice surprise from DFH being only 5% ABV, since I feel that most of the beers under 6% are not as good as their stronger beers. I would love to see this made more often, maybe even replace Festina Pêche as the summer seasonal. I will be heading back to the liquor store tomorrow to stock up as much as I can."
"Adequate carbonation. Was easy to drink and very refreshing, a great summer beer. Will have to go back and pick up another bottle or two before they run out."
"Absolutely delicious and highly drinkable beer. Great for any season, but especially perfect now."
"Pours a hazed pale golden color with a nice long lasting white head and little lacing. Aroma is very mild, slightly tangy and citrusy with some lemon and fresh cut grass. Flavor starts off initially extremely tangy, exacerbated by overly active carbonation. Middle of the body has some more typical wit characteristics before a strong peppery and lemon grass finish. Mouthfeel is fluffy and medium thick, initially dominated by over active carbonation which distracts from whatever is going on with the flavors. The finish is a little more spicy and peppery than I like and doesn't seem well integrated with the rest of the flavors. A nice, refreshing beer, but not particularly well balanced or pleasing; this is a definite pass for me."
"I must say given its status as a Dogfish Head specialty beer I was expecting something a bit more outrageous, but was pleasantly surprised to find a nice, refreshing, balanced witbier. Good for the summer months, though maybe not worth the $9 a bottle. Wouldn't mind seeing this in 6-packs in the future though."
"I split a large bottle at Little Ortino's in Schwencksville, PA. The beer poured a hazy light gold with a soft white head. The mix of subtle spice dominates the flavor (not in a bad way) while there's a smooth Belgian wheat background. The individual spices don't stand out so much as just melt together from the orange peel, to the coriander, then lemongrass. All in all a tasty beer, near the top of the style."
"Overall a beer I would drink again. Not what I expect from DFH who are known for their big brews. Nice summer brew to be enjoyed."
"Body is a little thick to me. Isn't bad in any way, just thicker than normal. Carbonation is really nice, and drinkability really high."
"All in all, this is a refreshing and superbly drinkable witbier, displaying the strong qualities of the style, while adding in a few new twists of its own. Boy, I hope this turns into regular release, because it's certainly one of DFH's best."
"This a very quaffable Wit packed with flavor. The spice might be a bit too much, but in the end, I enjoyed this beer. It's very honorable for DFH to sell this beer as a benefit to Drie Fonteinen."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side and carbonation is high. Drinkability is good, especially on this hot day. Very light and refreshing with some great citrus flavors. Very enjoyable beer overall."
"I missed this guy at the brewpub, but apparently fate intervened to give me a second chance. It pours a cloudy pale straw topped by about two fingers of white sudsy foam. The nose comprises wheat, pepper, coriander, lemon peel, clove, rice cakes, banana, cardamom, and the slightest possible touch of funk (and I use funk in its loosest form). The taste leans heavily on the citrus and wheat, leaving the spicier notes languishing in the fetal position. Actually, to properly describe the situation, the pepper's on Prozac, so it's still dancing about in the finish, as though all of its problems were really gone (how sad, really...). The body is light, with a light carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a very nice wit. 'Nuff said, baby."
"Namaste pours a beautiful, slightly cloudy straw yellow with ample carbonation that produces a soft white head full of tiny bubbles. The head stays around forever and leaves some goopy lace on the sides of the glass. The aroma is sweet with notes of honey, lemon zest, orange, wheat, bready yeast and a touch of white pepper. The flavor is very refined and very tasty with a very sweet, yet also slightly tart wheat malt background. It is lemony and spicy with hints of white pepper and coriander and is very refreshing. It is well balanced and all of the flavors play off of each other very well. For being a fairly sweet beer, it is impressive how thirst quenching it is. It has a fairly light and creamy mouthfeel that has a tart and refreshing finish. Very drinkable and a beer that I am glad came in a large bottle."
"D: Very drinkable, very refreshing and a fun take on the traditional Witbier. I could easily keep drinking this beer on a nice summer afternoon. A little more citrus to this one than you'd be used to if you were into Wit's. I like it quite a bit but it won't dethrone some of the more faithful styles for me."
"D= session if you were in the mood, great with the fried seafood and pizza we were enjoying, and worthy of simply sitting and sipping one to explore with great satisfaction."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: A very different style from Dogfish. I have a bottle that I want to age a little, but it was enjoyable and I would have again if the opportunity arose."
"D- oh hells yes. This is super drinkable, a great summer beer. Its a shame it was a limited run and I can't find it locally, because I'd love to grab another bottle for a party"
"Namaste pours into the glass looking bright hazy yellow with somehazy yellow and specs or squeezed orange. It gets darker towards the end of the bottle with the yeast. A nice bright white head with good retention but no stick, semi thick looking. Smells include wheat, coriander, lemongrass and orange peel. I get alot of sweet cereal like scents kinda like honeycombs. It's off putting. Taste starts off great with wheat mixed in with coriander and lemongrass. Squeezed orange makes for a push but is overpowered by the lemongrass which rules the roost. In the middle banana comes out to play. With warming things turn downhill, this gets a bit to sweet for me and the cereal comes through and a bit artificial tasting. Adding the yeast at the end did not make things better, even sweeter. The feel is above light bodied and is quaffable and refreshing to a degree, it's carbed up as well but fades with warming leaving for a thicker coat for a sec. I liked this for the 1st 12oz or so but grew tired of it and poured the rest out, it's just not my type of wit. It's to style but not incredibly balanced. Good for a gander."
"D: It's too bad that I had to split this one, but we agreed that another bottle would have been quite pleasurable to digest."
"CHEERS!!"
"Too bad we don't get it out on the west caost."
"M/D: It is thin bodied with great carbonation. Was easy to drink and very refreshing, a great summer beer. Will have to go back and pick up another bottle or two."
"Taste was wonderful. Best wit I've had. Very true to style with light coriander and orange going on. Nice crisp beer which is another addition to the great list of session beers I have tried as of late. Looking forward to having it again tonight, especially now that I know proceeds re for a good cause."
"A nice enough beer, though I wish it had a bit more flavor. Really nothing to get excited about and probably something I would not bother to order again."
"D- Goes down very easy... and the lower ABV makes this quite sessionable. Perfect lawnmower beer!"
