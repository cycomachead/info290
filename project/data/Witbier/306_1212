Spicy coriander, subtle orange peel, yeasty. Lower side of carbonation. Almost creamy. I like blue moon a lot especially after a couple cheaper beers like PBR. Forget who makes it if hat turns you away. This is a great beer. If it was a little cheaper in my area instead of almost $12 for a sixer, and well over $30 for a case, it would be an every day beer for me. Very enjoyable.","Urk1127","Mar 31, 2015"

I have to wonder if the people who bash on this beer are really just bashing on the company that makes it rather than any actual negative qualities of the beer itself... or maybe others in the style are just *that* much better that people start to mistake "less good than this other really amazing thing" with "not good at all," as people tend to do?

3.55,4.4,3.25,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured in to a pint glass casually, there is no head or lacing whatsoever. Only a faint white ring around the collar. Very low key carbonation. The appearance is that of an opaque, bronze, spiced apple cider. Buttery banana esters are complimented by a little spice and some sour citric aromas. The taste is sweet and flavorful, with earthy spicing and a citrusy coriander that lingers well in to the finish. The aftertaste is of mild metallic mineral and grain. After a few sips, a funky yeast flavor builds on the palate and is a little offputting. The brew is mildly carbonated with medium mouthfeel and the low alcohol content helps keep the beer crisp and refreshing. If not for the borderline cloying sweetness and odd aftertaste, this would be a stellar beer. Still one of the best widely distributed American examples out there though. After all, who hasn't enjoyed a Blue Moon from time to time? It's been around for quite awhile (20 years give or take). Well before craft beer reached the fevered high that it has hit today. That said, it's stood the test of time because it's pretty good. I'm not losing my mind over this, but I give credit where credit is due.","JohnnyI","Jan 27, 2015"

Smell is good though,with a healthy wheat malt twang and notes of bananas and apples. A bit of soap mixed with yeast. Taste has more of the same with good flavors of cereal grains, light sugars, and powdery yeast. Light fruits and lemony zestiness. A touch of honey. Crisp feel is a strongpoint and the lively carbonation has a light creaminess. Great drinkability tries to compensate for the lack of depth flavor wise. There's taste here and it's far more that the BMC partners usual offerings but its shallowness belies its parentage. Still ill drink it and enjoy it for what it is. Decent and quaffable.","scootny","Dec 27, 2014"

As a witbier it's run of the mill with a citrus background, though always decent on a hot day. I would recommend it for purchasing for a larger amount of people, or for a party. However, I could think of other witbier that is a lot better... If you are only used to very basic brews and are looking to branch out a bit, this isn't a bad starting point. In terms of the actual company that makes the brew, there is some minor controversy. Bluemoon is an example of a large corporation, MillerCoors, pretending to be a smaller independent brewer.","chihomebrew312","Nov 09, 2014"

I want to say it smells like orange or citrus, but the smell was muted, probably more wheat than anything.  The taste immediately hits on the lemon lime notes, with a wheat quality on the back of the palette.  I tasted some grapefruit and orange notes as well, mixed in with the wheat.  The label says its complex, and I will agree.  There are is lot of fruit and citrus in this brew.  Remarkably, the beer goes down exceptionally smooth and you have to be careful not too drink too many because they're so refreshing.  Blue moon remains one of the best convenience store, mass market wheat beers.  Top notch.","ENogueira","Sep 12, 2014"

Read some of the ratings online and on this site and it said Ok - good.  I have spent most of my life in Europe and have tried everything from Belgium to Czech, Dutch, and German.  That is where Beer tastes best.  It's not just just the taste of the beer but the glasses they serve it in and the atmosphere.  At home in America I still find that most American beers are mass produced, highly marketed and taste all the same in most cases.","ronbro55","Sep 04, 2014"

I feel almost guilty for rating it in the way I have but in Belfast it was either marketed incorrectly or it is not what it claims to be.","BeerDrinkersWorldTour","Sep 03, 2014"

That said, exceeding my expectations was not a difficult thing to do. This beer is certainly not what I would choose out of any lineup, even if it was a lineup of all Belgian Whites, but it is tolerable…I’m just still freaked out about this little brown blob that’s still floating in the beer. I’m sure it’s fine, but it creeps me out.","StoneTSR","Jul 16, 2014"

Today, with the availability of craft beer everywhere this is one I order when I do not have a choice. This weekend I was at a hotel that did not have much to choose from and Blue moon is certainly a better bet than a Coors or its equivalent. It is a decent everyday beer if and when craft beers are not an option.","Zacemy","Jun 16, 2014"

Writing this review makes me want to go get one...enjoy!","walternmoss","Jun 04, 2014"
3.2,-5.9,3,3.5,3,3.25,3.25,"A standard at most bars and liquor stores (speaking from CT). The color was a midly hazy yellow with a fizzy head that left pretty quickly. The smell was a lot of citrus and a nice amount of wheat. Unfortunately the wheat was overpowered in the taste by the citrus. Very tart beer. That being said though it was pretty refreshing for a summer day and pairs well with most bbq food. If you're having a party, I don't think anyone would be disappointed by this choice.","WhiteHillsStore","Jun 04, 2014"

But I think it is good both ways in the bottle and on draft. If you put a orange in it it males ot taste better. At least in my opinion it makes it taste better. It is not a jeavy beer as well wich I liked. If you have not had it you should try it.","jaredtp","Jun 03, 2014"

Great for gatherings and a beer I would order if nothing better was available on the menu. Enjoy it for what it is- an easy drinking crowd pleaser, not a philosophical world-class exemplification of the style.","Beric","May 31, 2014"

Blue moon has a cloudy golden color and light to medium body for a wheat beer. I admit that the flavor is often overpowered by the orange served with the beer but the hints of citrus and coriander of the beer itself are quite pleasant. For a mass produced product of the Coors company, this is a welcome option.","MSUEmilie","Apr 27, 2014"

4.94,45.3,4,5,5,5,5,"Overall this is outstanding when served in a tulip glass after dinner when you can pay attention to its delicate nose, flavor, and mouthfeel. It is still very good with dinner at a restaurant where it is typically served in a tall glass with a slice of orange on the rim. It is fine for a backyard barbeque, but most of its virtues would likely be missed. It is very similar to, but better than Champagne, thanks to its broader body and more complex flavor. It seems that every time I drink this beer I find something new and I want to give it a higher rating; the first time I tried it in a tulip glass was a game changer; I am now liking it more than St. Bernardus.","Earl11","Apr 21, 2014"

This beer smells like citrus and beer. The taste is good with smooth. There is nothing bad about this brew. This beer goes down smooth and fresh. Overall I give this beer a 3.75 out of 5.

Its not too heavy but its full of flavor and perfect with a complimentary garnishing of orange slice.","1fortheroad","Mar 06, 2014"

After I found out this beer was made by Coors, and since I've got into the artful craft of beer brewing/tasting, I noticed how generic and bland this beer is. It's a nice stepping stone beer if those who are drinking the cheap, mass-produced beer made from the Big 3. It's cheap, has way more flavor than Coors, Shock Top, etc... I'd buy this beer again if I was going to a party, but not for myself.","RingoBro","Dec 23, 2013"

While I admit that Blue Moon is a sub-par brew, it's leagues ahead of all the other mass-produced swill sold by the Big Three. Blue Moon remains my session beer at parties and social gatherings when it's too expensive to supply craft, and not acceptable to bring beer just for myself.","ThePaintedGrey","Dec 16, 2013"

Taste is bright, with plenty of orange peel and a little vanilla and Belgian spice. Taste is short-lived though; thin and one dimensional. I remember this being a pretty refreshing beer on tap, but there's a slick artificial sweetness this time that's kinda ruining things.

It's really not that good to the point where I would not recommend it. I certainly see no resemblance to wheat beer which is funny because it says on the bottle that it's unfiltered and Belgian style.

Possibly I'm overrating it because of limited experience with other brews of this type.

Of course it can not be compared to an import wit beer, because its not, and not meant to be. If you can find an import for $14 for a 24 box then by all means be my guest and go search. If you want to have a decent wit beer introduction or experience and don't want to pay $4 fr a bottle, then his is an excellent choice. Easy drinking, and smooth.","Jdbateman83","Aug 28, 2013"

Date on bottle was "Jun1013" so it was pretty fresh. Poured in one of my favorite glasses, a 14 ounce Vikings glass at 36 degrees F from my beer cooler in our home bar. (Appearance) Pours a hazy orangish/yellow in color with a 1-finger foamy white head with some lacing. (Smells) Of wheat and grains with orange peel and spice. (Mouthful) Very pleasant with a full-bodied feel with good carbonation. Very easy to drink with no bitter aftertaste. (Overall). This is a great spring-fall brew, especially in the summer. Very easy to drink and never be disappointed with a Blue Moon.","BeerWithMike","Jul 23, 2013"

I can't find much to be excited about with this beer, but I can't find much too complain about either. I definitely think that a slice of orange or even lemon makes it a more satisfying drink, but then, I'm just a big fan of citrus in general.","jrnichols","Mar 28, 2013"

Hard to tell under florescent lighting, but I would say it looks cloudy with a pale gold color and a white lace. Definable characteristics would be a smooth wheat rich thickness, with a kick of coriander spices and plenty of citrus. I’ll be honest in that I enjoyed the orange slice more, mostly because I find the soapy taste of coriander over powering. If you like citrus wheat beers this would be a good one to try at least once.","smokinyodas","Jan 06, 2013"

Aromas of citrus and bready yeast, light and balanced, but nothing special sticking out to me. Flavors are bready, with a clove spicing and citrus highlight. Well blended, but the carbonation and spicing makes it slightly sharp in mouth. Fruity, effervescent aftertaste that is bordering on overly sweet. Frothy, carbonated finish. The flavors just don't hold up enough against the light, carbonated body. Meh.","GarthDanielson","Oct 13, 2012"

The flavor is mild with sweet malts offset with a bit of orange, lemon, and spice. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. Not much of a wit beer, but certainly easy enough to drink if not just a tad on the boring side.","johnnnniee","Sep 08, 2012"

Mouthfeel is pretty average with a lot of carbonation. The taste is very smooth, mostly wheat, without much of the orange that can be smelled. This would be an excellent session beer as it is very drinkable.","Mojo","Aug 20, 2012"

Smells of orange peel, Lemon, And a heavy amount of wheat. Tastes very orange like. If somebody would have poured this into a glass for me and told me it was a light orange juice I would have believed them. The mouthfeel is a MASSIVE knockout punch of wheat. The wheat dominates and it loses the orange flavor. Overall, I don't like wheat ale's, But this is a good summer beer that I'm sure anybody could easily drink.","SometimesIfart","Aug 10, 2012"

However, on tap I find it to be a flavorful beer that stands out in the witbier crowd. That extra orange flavor is really great and is definitely aided by adding some fresh squeezed orange. It works in the winter as well as the summer. Out of the bottle I'm less than impressed for some reason or another. The spices get in the way of the smoothness.","TheRealBigC","Jul 28, 2012"

Smell is of malt, grain, spice, yeast, and some citrus peel aromas. Taste is of malt, grain, citrus peel, and spices. There is a mild spice bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer for what it is and pretty easy to drink as well.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 27, 2012"

The smell is very light and the aroma isn't overwhelming with alcohol. You can smell a bit of the citrus. Orange slice isn't required, but definitely addes to the taste. You can squeeze it or just let it drop in a gradually absorb itself in the beer. The taste was very light on my tongue. Very smooth going into my mouth and the citrus hint comes out. I didn't have to force it down like with some beers. It glides down. Overall a great beer with great taste. If you're more of a social drinker and like wines or mixed drinks, this is definitely a beer you should try.","Mikala","Jul 16, 2012"

Flavors of yeast, wheat malt, oats and a slight hint of spices. Mouthfeel is rather undercarbonated for the style and slightly slick.

Marketing, I know, but come on. I guess I'm not the ideal person Coors is marketing this beer towards. The color and the look of the beer is ok. It doesn't have the cloudy wheaty punch to it though. It looks rather translucent. I find this beer rather bubbly and overcarbonated too. This is a below average beer that is below average for the style.

I’m honestly impressed that Coors came up with such a product, but I even like Coors as a macro product. I would recommend this beer to anyone, and I would drink it anytime. This is a good crossover beer for those unfortunate folks who have not yet discovered craft brewing, as it isn’t too much of a system shock from your standard macro brew, but it is certainly different and unique. Good representation of the witbier style, I love it.","TheCondor","May 06, 2012"

It is however as well mannered wheat beer that resembles American versions, and does a fine job at it. The flavors are all mellow and work together. This doesn't sparkle, but it does go down easy with some nice flavors and aromas along the way. Not bad for a large-scale production beer.","allforbetterbeer","Apr 03, 2012"

The best thing about Blue Moon is that it is always there in a pinch at a restaurant with a limited selection of beers and on a hot summer day when I am doing summer yard chores. Also, its sweetness and orange flavor make it a approchable entry level beer for those transitioning from the common fizzy corn colored stuff that dominates the land. Cheers!!","djbow","Feb 15, 2012"

I think that because this beer is ubiquitous, crafted pretty well, and an extremely easy drinking beer it deserves some respect. I appreciate Blue Moon but would never buy it unless at a restaurant or bar with a very limited selection. This has been on the market for a long time and other companies like AB has tried to break into the craft beer world, but in my opinion this is the best effort by a major company.

I know this review might sound like I am flaming this beer, But with all of the beautiful witbiers out there it is a shame that they don't get the recognition that this beer has . So I guess what I am saying drink what makes you happy and if someone drinks something different don't talk down to them like you are better than them .

3.41,0.3,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer was probably one of the first 50 beers I had ever tried. I gave this one a try simply because I wanted to have something new. When I ordered my first glass of it the guy asked me if I wanted an orange wedge in it, I said sure because everyone else at the bar had one. I'm assuming he asked because I was a guy and perhaps "guys don't put fruit in their beer". Anyway though, I got the glass tossed the wedge in and gave it a look. It's a cloudy golden color with a foamy white head on top. The lacing is actually decent on this beer, I was surprised. The smell of the beer was sweet and now full of orange zest. The taste of the beer was refreshing and citrusy, makes a really nice summer beer for some people. The mouthfeel was smooth and lightly carbonated. Overall Blue Moon has never been a terrible beer in my opinion but since it's from Coors I do have a bit of an issue buying it. If it's free I'll drink it but I really don't feel the need to go out and purchase these with my own money unless it's all that's available.","Knapp85","Jul 20, 2011"

I know purists will frown, but it adds a zest which can be tart with fresh lemons or sweet if the lemon has aged and mellowed. Anyway, this is a review of a Coors product, Blue Moon, which you can get anywhere. It’s not my all time favorite wheat, as Adolf Coors and company add quite a bit of spices to this brew, but it does make a nice change of pace within a wheat beer rotation. Blue Moon has a nice head, remember to swirl in the yeast! The brew is smooth drinking summer wheat with a good bit of body and more flavor than most wheat beers.","iSip","Jul 05, 2011"

The fizzy head reflects the mouthfeel, which is light, crisp, and active, with orange aromas and notes. The beer gives off a great smell of orange, which was its most remarkable characteristic, but seems too light and empty in almost all regards for me to recommend it. Compared to other European Wheat Ales it feels void of real density and the flavors seem forced and artificial. The sweetness is tasty, but I don't see myself being able to drink more than a couple of them.

Drinkability was ok for a bit, but then quickly spiraled into a disaster. Nasty semi-yeast taste, combined with watery malt is just yucky in the aftertaste. I think the "belgian yeast" is hitting near the end, instead of spicing it up near the beginning, which is weird tasting in this case, as it accompanies water and nothing else. The orange also fades much too quickly considering it doesn't have much back up. Solid offering from Coors, but judged by craft, this one falls short.","veinless","Feb 13, 2011"

No real lacing down the glass. Smells of strong clove, mild lemon and orange with the wheat.

Usually wheat beers in North America come with a slice of lemon (which is an abomination... in my opinion). But the orange really set it apart. As far as the smell, the slice of orange really threw me off. So, I removed the orange and took a sniff of the beer. Had a lot of citrus. I took a sip. I got a lot of strong citrus flavor up front and not a lot of wheat on the back end. When I added the orange, I soon realized that was a big mistake. The orange simply masked the flavor of the beer and made it way too sweet for my palate. Next time I have this beer, it will definitely be without the orange.

The flavor however is rather astringent for my liking the faint sourness doesn't help matters, now I know why the orange is given with it, because it helps cut through the astringency. I also believe that I taste some cilantro/garden salad-like flavor that is really off-putting. It feels fairly syrupy in the mouth, but there is still an appropriate amount of carbonation.

4.3,26.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This is the beer I drink at the ball park. It pours with a rich, foamy head that fades away leaving just a trace of foam around the glass. I find that the malt overpowers the hops with a slight spicy nose. The mouth feel is good, full bodied and fruity, with rich flavors, just slightly spicy. It is always served with a wedge of orange, which is ok, but unnecessary. I don't need fruit in my beer, and this beer can stand on its own. It is not like Corona where you need some help to make it palatable.","Ranchito","Oct 12, 2010"

If Coors used better quality malts and orange, this could really be something special. But as it is, it's just a pretty good beer.

It pours a hazy orange straw topped by less than half a finger of white micro-foam (I blame the orange slice). The nose comprises wheat, coriander, and orange peel, all kinda weak, but still definitely wit-y. The taste follows along a similar vein, with notes of coriander, some cardamom, some light hoppy bitters, and a weird harsh orange/other citrus bite that leans toward lime territory. Were it not for that last part, this wouldn't be all that bad. The body is light, with a fizzy carbonation and a feel I can really only describe with the less-than-helpful term "wet".

I really do find this to be transition beer, as those who order and buy it tend to think they want something more than BMC, but don't really know where to go from there.

The aroma is pretty nice, citrus fruit of orange and lemon come to mind with some very light spicing. The flavor is also very good, nice mix of spicy, coriander and malts. Nice sweet feel, goes down very easy. People who really like wit beers would probably say that this one is a little light in some of its properties but it is made for the masses and is a good representation and seems very popular.

The finish was a little macro-ish and perhaps slightly metallic but not bad. The mouthfeel was average, the body medium and the carbonation the same.

This is the brew that turned me off to wit beers. The taste is a bit better but still stinks. Creamy orange peel with coriander and heavy white pepper. No malt or real yeast flavors, just a jumble of forced spices. This tastes like a beer that spoiled, should have an expiration date like that of milk.

The fruity smell/taste is a bit overpowering for me. Must be coriander or the like. And the normal serving is to put a slice of orange in it, which to me makes it even more fruity in a bad way. I find that if I drink more than 3 of these I start getting an unpleasant aftertaste. Hours afterwards I still have that fruity taste in my mouth.

First of all this beer can be found in many different places and definitly trumps it's usual neighbors of coors light and bud light. In terms of being a witbier, Blue Moon comes off not as cloudy as others but maintains the classic spices and orange peel aroma and flavors that make up this style. It is somewhat cloudy with a tint of orange to it and a crisp head. This is not the feel of a traditional witbier on the tongue, but it does somehow retain a smoothness despite it lacking in body. It tastes of spices and orange peels followed by a malty finish. Some aspects of this beer really speak typical domestic, but for some reason this actually works for this beer since it retains some aspects of a white beer.

Visible carbonation inside made this look lively and not bad at all. Smell was light, but did have some sublte fragrences that suprised me a bit. Of course there was a large amount of bread and grain smells to get through, but once you do there are some hints at fruitness. Maybe some plum, dark fruits definate here, and some spice. Not at all bad, could be stronger, and the huge amount of malt to get through to find it made it hard. The taste was very clean. Light smooth mouthfeel, and generous carbonation made it feel fine going down. Taste was a bit different. Hints of spices and a tiny bit of fruit trying to fight against the grain here. Low ABV and light feel made this highly drinkable. Overall this was not as bad as I thought, but then again not as good as it could have been.

By the end I wanted the citrus elements to come back, but I guess the only way I could get that is to crack open another one, which is just fine, since it was not at all heavy.

The small off white head ( about 1/2") was completely gone in less than 10 seconds. The taste was consistant with the style I felt that the strong citrus taste on the first sip was a bit much but it was more subdued on the following sips.

There are detectable, husky pale barley malt notes behind the wheat. The finish does taste somewhat macro-lager-like. Mind you, this is a Coors product. The carbonation is a bit high but still good overall. Mouthfeel is noticably light for a wheat beer. Drinkability is where this beer shines, considering it's a coors product, it's macro, and it's low price point. This is the best beer for non craft-beer drinkers to be drinking, and I can down two of these in the time it takes me to get through a bud, miller, etc. It's no competition against good craft beer, but it's head and tails above other american macrobrews.

Being a purest, I initially refused to allow an orange slice to be placed in it, but my friend insisted. The aroma smelled of wheat malt and fruity esters as well as the citrus smell of the orange. The taste was typical of an average weizen that utilized higher fermenting temperatures to produce fruity esters and this was accented further by the orange presence. The taste was refreshing and fruity, but I felt that it was a bit too much for a beer. Admittedly, I haven't tried this without the orange, but I assume it to be fairly average. I did notice a minute amount of clove esters present. The mouthfeel was medium with a medium carbonation. The drinkability was average.

And let me say I'm also impressed Coors was able to make this. This was my introduction to Belgian Whites, and its quickly become one of my favorite beers. The color is a sort of light gold, but on the cloudy side. The head pretty tall and better formed than I would have expected in such a fizzy beer. The smell is very pleasant with some citrus and a little bit of spice besides. Taste is pleasant and refreshing. It's light, with some sweetness, and some sourness that adds pleasant depth, rather than a perception cheap hops. Plus there's a bit of spice in there. Mouthfeel is fizzy and fairly light, though not at all watery. Drinkability is pretty good because this is a light and very pleasant beer. But not great because of the acidity. Hop presence is rather slight since a lot of the flavor comes from spice and other flavorings. I'd definately reccomend this, although I have to admit Hacker-Schorr Weiss was definately better still. It was a surprisingly decent introduction to a new category for me, and if I couldn't find, or didn't want to pay for a bottle of that Hacker-Schorr Weiss, then this would be my choice for someone who's new to beer, or who says they don't like beer.","casualbeerman","Jan 01, 2006"

The taste is rather unfinished; that's the best I can describe it. It seems as if the beer hasn't aged properly or was stored incorrectly. A rather bland taste altogether with just subtle flavors; but not enjoyable really. After a sip or two, my mouth was exhausted. It's one of the few 'not so mass produced' beers at DC9 even though it's owned by Coors, so I'll probably have this again if I go there unless they get some beers on-tap.

Head tends to fall rather rapidly. Aroma is nice and spicy with a hint of coriander and citrus, but very faint. Flavor is solid. It has most of the components that a wit beer should have, but just not of it.

A really soft and sweet aroma, slight citrus and even slighter spice. The flavor was sweet and slightly spicey, with strong malt flavors. The body was good, the beer smooth, but it seemed to be a little light on the carbonation, perhaps due to the slice of orange.

The aftertaste was dry and a bit sour. I kept going back for more sips and mouthfuls, trying to sort out what I was tasting- A bit of wheat, some apricot-like sweeteness with some other fruits and spicyness.

Pours with a small head that is gone in a flash. Zero, zilch, nil lacing anywhere. Kinda of a brownish-orange color with chunks of yeast all over the place. In fact, if anybody has seen the movie Strange Brew....you know when the dog starts drinking the beer from his dog dish, then they throw him a donught to get him away from the beer because it was their dad's last beer. Then they poured what was left from the dog dish into a glass? That's what this beer looks like. Maybe not as much chunky dog food, but looks pretty nasty nonetheless. Smells at least decent. Smells of wheat, maybe a hop somewhere. Tastes like wheat, coriander, maybe some citrus in there. A little pepper or some kind of spicyness. Kinda flat also. Not awful, but pretty lame.

Im thinking I got a fairly fresh sample, and if it aged a bit, the coriander would fade a bit.

I have to credit Coors with making this brew. It's decent, tasty, and making them a fortune I'm willing to bet.

The bouquet is interestingly floral. Orange peel is obvious in the nose, but appears more softly lemony than orangeish. There's a very mild touch of soft coriander as well, and some gentle yeastiness. The body is medium although it appears slightly fuller due to it's smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Just as the spice is obvious in the nose, so it is in the flavor with gentle coriander and mild orange peel wrapped in lush, sweet malt. Throughout the glass the dull yeastiness develops on the palate, and some additional peppery spiciness evolves. Not a bad beer at all! It seems a bit fluffy (maybe I should say obtuse?) in comparison to most of the versions I've had from Belgium, but it's not overly done. It's flavorful, just lacking in complexity. There are better domestically brewed witbier's available, but this will do nicely in a pinch.","NeroFiddled","Jun 01, 2003"

It has a cloudy orange color with a nice white head, but I expected the pale golden color that is characteristic of most wits. This looked more like dirty water. It was served with a lemon which in fact helped the aroma. The taste was slightly citrusy, but not enough to make this a refreshing summer beer.

If you look at this one in the glass it pours a cloudy orangish gold hue with a creamy carrot tinted head that is rather pleasant in appearance and taste. It's aroma is primarily coriander (orange peel), but the wheat based goodness also comes alive with every inhalation. The taste is a sweet version of a classic style that a mass production company acually put some care into to bring out a decent white beer.

I think it is a normal looking beer with it's light haze giving it the allure of a hefe. I find the smell a little akin to that of fake scented oranges, which is a little disconcerting. However, the flavor of the beer wins points back quickly. Granted, it is not highly complex, I enjoy the citrus undertones of this beer, especially with a slice of orange in tossed in the brew (yeah I know, but I like cream in my coffee too).
