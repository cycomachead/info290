4.38,21,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,"Poured from a can into a tulip glass. Cloudy, light orange with copious white head and fair amount of lacing. Smells like a solid hefeweizen, yeasty, fruit esters – pineapple, bubble gum, banana. Tastes like a pretty solid wheat beer, a lot of citrus (lemon, orange).  Absent are the spicy notes, nice clean finish. Mouthfeel is light, a little soapy and very smooth and easily quaffable. This beer is a solid beer for spring and summer BBQ, the low ABV argues against the ‘winter’ aspect of it (it’s such an enjoyable beer, it could be imbibed year round). Hands down the best US wheat beer I’ve had – love the can for convenience and portability.","ThaneMcC","Mar 14, 2015"

4.21,16.3,3.75,4,4.25,4.25,4.5,"A bottle poured into an IPA glass. Cloudy pale yellow with a clean white head that is decent and leaves some streaks and spots of lace all along the glass. A slow fade leaves a mild covering. Nose is excellent with a healthy sourness and wheat malt twang that shows amazing spiciness considering that this is not spiced. I'm blown away by the amount of clove, light coriander, bubblegum, pepper, and faint banana and light fruit esters all from just the grains, hops, (what there is) and yeast. Taste showcases classic wit tartness and lemony citrus notes. Mild cloves and cinnamon flow to a tight, light bitterness that releases bubblegum and soap, leaving a surprising dark graininess that lingers with mild almost graham like cracker flavors. Cinnamon and cloves hang in the background. Feel is velvety smooth and light with a mild creaminess. Superb drinkability and all around deliciousness, a great wit and right up there in my top five. As a winter ale the light and drinkable nature may seem a bit of a contradiction, the flavor and satisfaction in the drinking make for an enjoyable winter brew that would also do well in the warmer months.","scootny","Feb 26, 2015"

The flavors are much more of a hefeweizen.  The beer doesn't have the softness of most hefeweizens.

4,10.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Bell's Winter White Ale brewed by Bell's Brewery, Inc. This brew has an ABV of 5.0 %  Winter White Ale pours out cloudy amber color with a nice off white head. This is an unfiltered brew you can not see though it.  The smell is sweet with some grain and malts.  Winter White Ale smell is really mild.  Now for the taste, it is sweet like fruit juice.  You pick up on some malts, but it mild. The mouthfeel is light and crisp. There is nothing overpowering in this brew. Winter White Ale has a nice balance to it.  Bell's Brewery, Inc. did a nice job with this brew. Overall I'm giving Bell's Winter White Ale a solid 4 out 5. I would buy this brew again.","nicholas2121","Dec 18, 2014"

Banana yeast and spice and orange esters in the nose, some citrus to the taste, but way too much grain here, especially the wheat. It lacks all the delicate features of the bets wits, and warms up ugly. I'm surprised this came from bells. It's not a bad beer, but it's nowhere near their full potential.

Tried in a tall boy pint, it has a very refreshing taste (I imagine even more robust from a tap).  Although I didn't see color, aroma is slighty citrus, and that is the definition of the finish.  The Belgian yeast makes this an incredibly enjoyable beer!  I found a winter seasonal that I would definitely order again (hopefully on tap....).","Ericmichaeljordan","Nov 20, 2014"

Pours opaquely hazy bright golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, banana, pear, apple, orange, wheat, bread, floral, grass, clove, pepper, herbal, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, banana, pear, apple, orange, wheat, bread, clove, pepper, herbal, floral, grass, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon, banana, pear, apple, orange, wheat, bread, clove, pepper, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast ester and malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and very smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present on the finish. Overall this is a damn nice witbier. All around good complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast ester and malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 16, 2014"

The nose of this one is very European with a sweet funky yeast aroma. There is peach and apricot notes with a lot of fresh bread aromas. The flavor follows suit. Quite funky, almost like a saison style. Sweet and malty and tangy and slightly sour all at the same time. The mouth is light and refreshing but effervescent and refreshing. This isn't a beer I'd come to often but definitely one worth trying and enjoying.","lochef81","Feb 07, 2014"

Pours a cloudy tangerine color (looks almost like freshly squeezed orange juice), thinner head than expected, but it leaves some lacing on the glass. Aromas are yeasty, orange, wheat. Tastes are nice with fruity Belgian yeast esters, wheat, orange zest, white peppery spiciness. I thought I could taste coriander, but apparently there's none used in the brewing process. Mouth-feel is nearly full-bodied while being creamy and smooth. Overall, better than I remember, and one of the better American brewed witbiers.","barnzy78","Dec 16, 2012"

Taste is crisp corn off the bat, fading into a peppery citrus hop taste, ending with more corn and a slightly unpleasant aftertaste of skunky grain.

This *winter beer* has nothing "wintry" about it apart from the name and the label artwork-- certainly nothing that suggests the scents and smells of winter (cinnamon, nutmeg, pine, chocolate, burning wood or even a decade-old, rock hard fruitcake.) The scents are typical average witbier: bread, wheat and yeast. There's a slight hint of citrus but it's gone quickly and doesn't translate into taste-- which is similarly average.

It pours a thoroughly hazy pale straw topped by a finger of white froth. The nose comprises lemon zest, coriander, mint, pine, orange peel, and wheat. Honestly, the sharp bit of mint I get does nothing good for the smell, but it's luckily not enough to sabotage the entire occasion. The taste, though, does away with this unpleasantness, while straying none too far from the path already laid out by the smell. The orange peel, though, is a touch stronger than before, and a pinch of black pepper is thrown in there as well. The body is fairly light, with a moderate carbonation and a kinda dry finish.

First off, I love that they used the white winter theme to brew a beer like this out of season. Typically, wheat beers can only be found fresh during the summer. It is nice to know you can find one light and refreshing in the winter too as a six-month old wit beer sipped in January would almost certainly be stale. Not this--it had a crisp clean freshness that comes only from hefty doses of wheat played against the musty phenols of the belgian yeast. I could not smell or taste any orange or coriander, lemon or lemongrass, just nice round full bready yeast. Even the color was pale yellow, though not as white as Hoegaarden. It did not feel overly fizzy or thin, as can sometimes be the case for this style. Excellent drinker. High marks all around.","dnrobert24","Jan 27, 2011"

Nice carbonation in my glass...smell is slightly sour, some faint fruity/esteryness, but pleasantly no spice or coriander. Ahh, the taste is crisp, and a nice dry aftertaste. I can taste some phenolics almost reminds me more of a hefe than a wit and I like it. Some nice spicy clove from the yeast, again, more like a hefeweizen than any witbier I've ever had. I think Mr. Bell is like me, not a fan of spice in his beer....and this really makes for a nice, easy drinking beer. What is weird about this style though, is I wouldn't imagine it pairing with winter comfort food classics like pot roast, or pot pie....Mmm, pot pie. Might go well with another kind of pot, lol? In the end though, this is a nice crisp beer which is a pleasant change of pace from all the big IPAs or heavy stouts of winter, you know, when you're running around the house, cooking or cleaning and getting kinda hot and you just want something refreshing, I can see this one shining through in those sort of moments.","Star80","Nov 13, 2010"

Beautiful label makes me wish the sun was out over a freshly fallen 12" snow. Heavy wheat aroma with citrus, clove, and a touch of banana. Rich yellow pour, slightly golden in the middle. Solid white head, swirl the yeast and a nice cloudiness cascades through to the bottom. Lively on the palate there is a welcoming sourness at the end. Flavor is easily received. Modest blend of fruits and spices, the banana is more prevalent. High wheat content, nice maltiness.

The smell was nice and floral with some citrus, especially orange and lemon, coming out but nothing major. The taste is rather a letdown. as tjere really isn't anything there except a combo of wheat/yeast with a sharp lemony feel. The excessive wheat/yeast makes a real smooth but somewhat watery, slick brew that feels a little non-descript as it passes (a tad like a light beer).

A strong effervescence of wheat in the smell. This beer tingles the mouth with a strong thick mix of carbonation and wheat but has more of the feel of a summer relaxing in the sun beer than that of a winter.

A creamy banana thing on the back of the throat in the finish. Good but it just doesn't seem all that wintery. Early spring or late fall maybe.

Blasted upfront with the sweetness of wheat followed up by a slightly bitter touch of hops on the finish. Very well balanced and kept me wanting another sip. The mouthfeel is what I wasn't a fan of on this beer. Very thin and didn't coat very well at all. The carbination is just a little to much. For my tastes I wish it was backed off just a little bit.

The aroma is lightly tart with a good wheat presence, straw, and hints of orange, with mostly just wheat on the palate, yet still tastes quite nice. The body is a bit creamy and fairly full for a wheat beer, with medium carbonation and finish. Overall a well-structured wheat beer that is quite drinkable, as it was gone before I even knew it.","mmmbeer","Feb 12, 2007"

Mellow nose of yeasty bread, banana peel, light citrus, and a little grassy. Starts off with a limey, sprucey spritz and quickly moves to a nice soft wheat profile that is flavorful and mellow. Medium carbonation makes for a tonic water effect. Descent spice level and some fruity hops are very complimentary. Chalky to creamy at times. The smooth soft profile makes this and easy drinker although Im not buying the winter connection.","cabsandking","Feb 06, 2007"

Smell was somewhat more complex than many witbeirs, some spices present. Has some spice present in the taste. Almost like a witbeir impersonating a more heavy, darker winter warmer, just not doing a very good job at it. Definitely not as light as some wits.

Its a moderately sweet, but very spritzy and carbonated beer. With a fairly medium body, this is actually a little more full than necessary for the style.

4.3,18.8,4,4,4,5,5,"Pours like a classic Wit: opaque, pale golden and whitish in color, and with plenty of suspended yeast. Slight pale tan-head and lacing. Nose is right on style, mildly spicy, but rather perfumey, with yeast, clove, and bubblegum qualities, all of which make a great impact on the first sip. Mouthfeel is light and creamy, almost effortless to drink, and with very low apparent alcohol. Juicy and malty (yet light), and very flavorful, this reminds me very favorably of the Saint Bernardus Wit. Wonderful stuff, and a totally unexpected approach to a Winter seasonal. The first time I was served this it was accidentally, during a rush at a local bar. I asked for a Summit Winter and I got a Bell's Winter. I drank it without knowing what it was, partly figuring that (it being a game day) I wouldn't get another beer before long. This particular bar serves a lot of draught Blue Moon, so I mistook it for that right away, but then realized how much *better* it was than the Blue Moon I've had umpteen times in the past!

Taste begins with mainly the yeast, continues into the citrus flavors - orange and lemon again, especially the orange - and ends with a light touch of the sour citrus. Flavors travel well. Very light, fizzy mouthfeel. Overall, a very good wheat beer. I'm usually not a fan of the style, but this one makes me like it.

Husky, yeasty wheat malt aromas dashed with lemony orange, clove, and light coriander. Smells how a witbier should, even if it is a little mild. Milky wheat malt flavors start out, but are quickly joined/overpowered by yeasty citrus. Tart, acidic lemon and orange juice refreshingly take us into the mildly candy-sweet, spice-tinged, yeasty finish. Medium bodied, with a milky, smoothie feel up front, followed by a refreshing, acidic bout of carbonation, and then back to the smoothie. Another good beer from Bell's.","alexgash","Jan 03, 2005"
3.95,9.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Hazy, white gold in hue, the color and appearance of the liquid is typical for a Wit. The head developed poorly; at the apex the foam was only a half finger in height. It didnt last long, in a moment it faded to a fizzy cap before almost fading away. There was some subsequent lacing but it was spotty and it clung poorly. Ive seen better-looking Wits but this offering is still improved over normal. The nose says Wit and I cant ask for much more. Wheaty-malt backbone with a yeasty undercurrent that melts perfectly with spiced citrus zest. Coriander is clear and pronounced. Orange peel is equally easy to detect. Add in hints of clove and vanilla. Modestly sharp, the potency is moderate. Id like it louder but there isnt anything incorrect with the bouquet. I like it but what is special about it? Should there be anything special about it? Typical. Pleasant. Inviting. I really like the palate; it is very lively and assertive. When I first noticed Bells brewed a Wit as a winter seasonal I thought it must be some huge, Imperial Wit. It is not. However, a Wit as a winter seasonal does make sense. OSA is spiced. Most Winter Warmers as spiced. Whats the difference? Back to this beer, if youve had a great Wit then youve had this one. It is textbook from start to finish and since it is well-done, typical works. Heavy spiced bill up front, coriander, ginger, clove. In the middle is a wheaty-malt backbone, blasts of citrus, orange, and more spice (subtle this time). The finish is soft, yeasty, wheaty, with a lovely juiciness about it. Similar aftertaste. This is a great tasting Wit. Lovely. This would be a perfect beer for a chilly Sunday brunch. A tickle fuller than medium in body; subtle, natural carbonation, the mouthfeel is very pleasant. It is extremely easy to drink, in a good way. I could imbibe in a few of these beers in one setting. It also helps the abv is low, which is something I dont see much of in winter beers. I enjoyed this beer completely. Ill get some more next year, I hope. I purchased a six-pack in Kansas City. It is worth a try, IMO.","bditty187","Jan 02, 2005"
3.15,-13,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"A bit of a different winter time offering from Bell's. Nice looking in the glass with a hazy golden color and thin, white, bubbly head. Presents a pleasant floral aroma with hints of banana, oranges, and a bit of spice (coriander and maybe a bit of pepper?). A mild overall taste with a dry finish. The spiciness present in the aroma along with citrusy flavors linger and add some depth of flavor. A light bodied beer with a crisp dry feel in the mouth.

The head was thinner than a Barbie doll suffering from anorexia, and did not stick around too long. The aroma was nicely estery with the appropriately anticipated banana, lemon, and clove flavors. Taste was creamy, tangy, and spicy with a fuller mouthfeel than the looks suggest. Very easy to drink with a low ABV, this is a very nice Witbier on its own merit, and quite a departure from the other winter seasonals that are around.","rajendra82","Dec 22, 2004"

Taste is a pleasingly sedate wheat character, sharing the stage with a slight sour aftertaste. Mouthfeel is okay, and drinkability is a bit better. Worth a try, but not one of their best offers, in my opinion.","ppoitras","Dec 21, 2004"

Moderately slick mouthfeel, light body and medium/high carbonation. Overall, not a bad beer, but not an exceptional white beer.

The taste carried that citric zest of lemon while a good blending dose of carbonation cut through a thick wheat base. Leaving a crisp mouthfeel alittle tart. A nice beer that is refreshing and quenching. It would be nice to see thisone, say; Christmas in July. It would fit very well that time of year as well.","chilidog","Dec 18, 2004"

Pours a hazed gold with a minimal thin lace. Aroma is fresh and grassy, full of yeast and citrus. Flavor shows some fresh floral notes as well as some solid citrus and earthy hops to balance the cloves 'n' bananas spice. Mouthfeel is crisp with a rush of carbonation, though not overdone.

More thick than others I have had in while. A really nice wit. the finish is a bit creamy and easy drinking. I am glad I have another of these beers waiting for me in the cellar. Try it if you can.

Sweetest mid mouth, clovey esters, and then funels to a more lemony bitterness at the close. Medium dry aftertaste, thinnish and slightly metallic in feel, usually the way the style hits me.

4.01,10.8,3,4.5,4,3.5,4,"A little darker, spicier, hopier, and bubblier than most Wits.","ken3c","Oct 08, 2004"
3.62,0,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A very hazy beer with a thin white head when served from the tap. The aromas are of banana (dominant), and a dusty spiciness. Very banana tasting in the flavor as well, it dominates the flavor. Nice wheaty-grain character in the finish. This is certainly mislabeled as this beer is quite German in character and usually a white refers to a Belgian style of beer. Light tasting and refreshing, where I was expecting a "double" Wit style of beer brewed at winter warmer strengths. A good beer but a bit of a let down. I did not notice any of the sour character others seemed to have notice, perhaps their samples were infected.","Gueuzedude","Mar 26, 2004"
3.13,-13.5,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"This beer poured a cloudy orange color with a moderate white head. The smell was very lemony and slightly spicy. The taste reminded me distinctly of an overspiced Oberon. Citric flavors are dominant and a tarty finish is there. Lots, almost too much, coriander in the body. Light in body and mouthfeel this beer is simply decent and not one of Bell's best offerings. I think this was a bad batch of Oberon with a different name!","granger10","Mar 04, 2004"
3.63,0.3,4.5,4,3.5,4,3,"Drinkability is hampered by the sheer sweetness of the is brew. In fact my buddy said it tasted like a "Blue Moon on a night on the town, ready to put out." I'm not quite sure what that means exactly but I think I agree.","Jables","Feb 10, 2004"
3.77,4.1,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"I had this at the sports bar in Marshall Field's in downtown Chicago, "InField's," and found it a pleasant surprise. Prices are interesting: $3.50 for 24 oz Gooses, $4.50 for micros on tap (Summit, Bell's, Sierra Nevada), and $5.50 for imports (just Guinness and Heineken). The macro-swill is only in bottles. Not a bad deal.","DrunkMcDermott","Feb 04, 2004"
3.77,4.1,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Flavor comes through with a nice yeasty character, and also coriander strength. This brew is very easy to drink and has a fairly thin body. I am not sure why it is called a winter white as it seems like a typical wit beer to me. Nice brew that I would enjoy just as much on a hot summer day as in the winter.","sulldaddy","Jan 31, 2004"
4.2,16,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This is affectionately known as "Snow-beron", a takeoff on the summer beer, "Oberon". Is it better than Oberon? No, just different. Where Oberon has a fruitiness to it, this has the traditional wheat beer spice. Both are excellent. This needs to be bottled or else I am going to be spending too much time at the local Pub...","proc","Jan 17, 2004"
4.1,13.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"My first wi-fi review....quite nice to sit the laptop at the bar and write the review as I go. A nice wit, and definitely a treat to see the style in the midst of winter, even if it's not a warmer. Definitely one I'd have again.","beergeek279","Jan 01, 2004"

4.23,16.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Whatever Vecenie's did for the Pittsburgh area it's amazing setting up the deal with Bell's to bring in their products was a huge step but now we're getting a taste of their winter white ale, wow thank you? Appearance: Cloudy peach golden with a nice chunky whtie head nice full sporadic layer of patched lacing. Aroma: Spiced up, banana an excellent Bell's wit. Taste: Slightly creamy sharp sweetness of malted wheat, creamy at first but then the coriander and zest of the peppery hops takes a nice turn toward oh yeah. Mouthfeel: Medium to light in body kinda beefed up Oberon ala winter white, pretty damn good I'm a fan. Drinkability: Awesome session all the way solid all around one of my favorite wits so far.","WVbeergeek","Dec 23, 2003"
4.35,20.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Hazy golden orange appearance. Actually, quite murky looking. A fair sized off white head sits on top and leaves sparse lace down the sides of the glass as I drink. Aromas of clove and banana, yeast and pepper hit my nostrils. The taste is quite nice. Very nice bavarian weizen profile. Some great banana and vanilla things happening. And more subtle tones of pepper and clove. Yeasty tones are quite nice and a little bready. When I tasted this tonight, I was hoping for a big ol weizenbock or something. I didn't know what style it was, but after tasting it, I was guessing German style Hefe. It has a great full body and a luscious mouthfeel. Very easy drinking and quite tasty. After one try, I'd have to say I prefer this to their Oberon "American Wheat" beer. I just think it has more character and depth. I'd like to see this one in bottles over the summer.","Bighuge","Dec 16, 2003"
3.95,9.1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Drinkability is quite good, but in the final summation, this Bell's fan would sooner reach for a TwoHearted or one of their spectacular stouts. I hope it appeals to others, as it's not a bad beer in the least. Just not great.","feloniousmonk","Dec 04, 2003"
3.58,-1.1,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Pours a hazy, creamy yellow color with a light tinge of apricot orange. Topped off with a bit of fine and fleeting head. This was served way too cold, so I had to wait a bit for the nose to develop. The smell that emerged was pleasant but unremarkable--not inappropriate for this style. Clean grains and light floral scents. Taste was crisp with hints of banana and clove complementing the foundational grains. The mouthfeel was the most disappointing feature of this beer--unduly creamy and even milky. Still, this is a nicely drinkable beer but with the toned-down character that makes wits pleasant but uninteresting.","BitteBier","Dec 03, 2003"
3.5,-3.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I was eagerly anticipating this beer and it looked great as it poured a nice golden yellow with crisp white head. Aroma was very pleasant had a slight malt profle but dominated by citrus and clove notes. Little banana, little orange maybe something else that I can't quite finger. Taste was not as strong or malty as I was anticipating and left a litte sour on the palate. To me they might have been better going all out and making a strong Hefe, as someone below suggested. I was a little confused by this one and not really sure what to think. Felt good in the mouth but not as "lively" as I would expect. My experience with Bell's suggests they will refine this over time but not the best from this great brewery.","CRJMellor","Nov 28, 2003"
4.19,15.7,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Drinkability: A hefe/wit hybrid. Smells like a hefe, tastes more like a wit. Uses both Belgian Trappist and hefe yeast strains in the fermenation (according to powerpoint slide from the head brewer). Quite drinkable, but I liked Oberon better. Still, an interesting idea for a winter beer.","ManekiNeko","Oct 22, 2003"

4.85,34,5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"This beer is probably misnamed. I found it to be a direct competitor with the finest German wheat beers such as Paulaner and Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbiers. I was told the same thing as another reviewer about the Bell's folks being concerned it would compete to closely with Oberon. Oberon is a starter kit for people about a year away from sampling German-style wheat beers. This beer has the wonderful banana and yeast flavor of the best German Weissbiers and is the best American Microbrew version of this style I have sampled. I wish this was readily available in bottles!","Sudmissle","Sep 11, 2003"
3.77,4.1,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Sampled from a limited bottle run. This beer will be available on draft only this coming fall and winter. Hazy straw color with a fizzy white head. Some sediment is present in the pour. Looks more like a hefeweizen than a wit. Nose is doughy with notes of clove, curacao, banana and a less-than-desirable egg aroma which could be attributed to the yeast. Banana, orange rind, a faint hint of coriander, graininess and an earthy hop finish characterize the flavor of this ale. I don't know if it's the yeast strain or what, but this is still quite reminiscent of Oberon. Drinks quite well overall, this will be nice to drink on draught... but I'd prefer it in the summertime.","Jon","Sep 02, 2003"
4.07,12.4,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"A highly quaffable ale from Bell's sampled yesterday at the Mich Beer Fest. It's only real "drawback" is that it's orange-ish, golden color is far too yellow for a witbier. Dull orange and banana aromas are potent and enjoyable but, again, it strikes me as more of a hefe than a wit. Similarly, big orange-banana smoothie flavors dull any intended coriander or other spices. It's a very tasty beer, but it's not within the style. Frankly, I'd be overjoyed if they replaced Oberon with this and stopped calling it a witbier.","marburg","Jul 27, 2003"
2.19,-39.5,1.5,2.5,2,2,2.5,"The nose of this particular beer is banana. The body is cloudy and the hue is pale yellow. I observed some yeast with this beer. I definitely was not impressed by the taste of this beer. After about half-way through I had had enough and tried another of their beers. This definitely is not one of my favorite beers from this brewer.","hotstuff","Jul 11, 2003"
2.42,-33.1,3,3.5,2,2,2,"This brew has a very fruity banana aroma. Its body is a weak yellow orange color that is very cloudy with yeast evident. It tastes as fruity as it smells and went down very easy, but later drinks caused my stomach to do flip flops. I didn't like it and eventually wound up getting another Porter and having them pour the rest of this beer down the drain.","TheDM","Jul 03, 2003"
