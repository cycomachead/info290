Smells wonderful, with some dry Belgian ""burlap sack"" funk out front, followed by bubble gum, lemon rind, fresh orange juice, coriander seed, and buttered bread. Palate is almost like a saison but with added orange, lemon, and tangerine in the middle and end phases of a sip ... Dry and somewhat tannic but very fruity. Flashes of watermelon (!) and golden raisins in there amongst the citrus and phenolic/estery yeast. Some banana going on. Light to moderate body with carbonation quite tame. Finish is dry, with some green resinous hops apparent, although the bright citrus flavor carries on through to the end. Nicely phenolic, with some clove becoming more assertive over time. Enjoyable even if the citrus is rather too dominant in the overall flavor profile.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 13, 2014"

3.63,-1.1,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Pale hazed peach body with a fluffy white head, forms thick and brings out the fine speckled lacing of the white head. Aroma is like a soft wheat grain tone with clementine citrus fruit additions with candied bitterness with hops wrapped around the citrus peel and spice additions. Flavors are bright with the citrus peel, coriander additions and clean alcohol finish I'm not sure what the abv is or the IBUs but they claim to throw in Summit hops usually a green vegetable note. My belief with their house yeast is to keep the sediment in the bottle. What's left is a light drinkable beer that Clown Shoes will sell by the tone, however I will set it straight this is not a hoppy American Wheat ale, but it's solid highly carbonated wheat that I enjoyed due to the clementine orange peel and spice additions. Overall go and drink some and form an opinion for yourself.","WVbeergeek","Oct 26, 2013"

4.1,11.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 6/21/2013. Pours very hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of big lemon zest, tangerine, orange peel, grapefruit, coriander, clove, pepper, wheat, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, yeast, and spice notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon zest, grapefruit, tangerine, orange peel, coriander, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, coriander, clove, wheat, bread, floral. and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of malt, yeast, and spice flavors; with great flavor robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent witbier. All around great balance, complexity, and robustness of malt, spice, and yeast flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 06, 2013"

3.39,-7.6,3.25,3.5,3.5,3,3.25,"Overall I wasn't that into this beer and I thought it was a very average example of the style, all of the aspects of this beer seemed pretty average and there wasn't anything about it that separates it from all the other average Witbiers. This beer had decent drinkability, it was smooth and not filling, but the flavor didn't really hold my attention and I think it would really start to wear on me after drinking more than one so I think one would be my maximum. What I liked the most about this beer was the orange aspect, it wasn't bad and it didn't seem to be artificial. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, I think it needs some work. I wouldn't buy this beer again, since it really doesn't stick out for the style and it's a little overpriced for what you get. I would only recommend this beer to someone who really likes this style. All in all I wasn't impressed with this beer, there wasn't anything about it that made it a memorable Witbier. Better luck next time guys, Hoppy Feet is still my least favorite Clown Shoes beer but this one wasn't too much better, I'm still not sure about this brewery and I think it might be hard for them to compete against the local Michigan brewerys.","StoutHunter","Aug 27, 2013"

The aroma is coriander and cardamom forward (which I like), and has a nice fruity wheaty thing going on in the background which has some nice peach and tangerine qualities. The taste is a bit more balanced between the fruit and the spice. It is very full flavored for a witbier. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a chewy texture, and lively carbonation.

The orange flavor is not as strong in the flavor as it was in the nose, but it does blend very nicely with the wheat malt. There's some mild spiciness in the taste as well, which was detectable in the nose. There are some clove, black pepper, and nutmeg flavors. The body is light with moderate carbonation.

The color reminds me of a white grapefruit juice with the pulp still in, but the head dissipates almost instantly while the carbonation continues to pock-mark the surface with a torrent of bubbles. The smell is thick with that Clementine and orange-like smell alongside the proper wheat-funk and a slight banana-like smell seems to be there as well alongside some faint spices. The beer tastes banana-like with nice undertones of citrus Clementine and orange, kind of like a banana-citrus smoothie with some wheat cloying and cream at the back of the tongue. The after taste is light with citrus while the mouthfeel is really rough with carbonation and fiercely dry on the top of the tongue with faint bubbling still tingling the tops of the mouth. I was hoping for a little more of a citrus burst from this beer, but overall it just seems like a strong citrus backbone on a white Belgian ale. Overall it’s not a terrible beer, just not quite what I was hoping for, and not wholly memorable.","Maxwell","Jul 20, 2012"

4,9,4,4,4,4,4,"Gearing up for a Clown Shoes tasting in the store, so I figured I'd get more acquainted with their beers myself. This one pours a lightly hazy golden straw topped by over a finger of white foam. The nose comprises wheat, lemon zest, lightly tart tangerine, black pepper, clove, and a twist of ruby red grapefruit. The taste brings in more of the same, but as powerful as the citrus is, the spices are the stars now: black pepper, clove, cardamom, even a touch of coriander for the sake of it. It's powerfully spicy, lemme tell ya, but I think it works here. Right on. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation, a wet feel and a dry finish (deal with that, people!). Overall, a very nice wit, a different take than I've encountered lately, what with the in-your-face spices, but definitely a welcome change-of-pace.","TMoney2591","Jan 17, 2012"

Mouthfeel- tons of carbonation makes for a really dry finish, works well for the style. Drinkability- this is a great summer beer, perfect to cool down with after a nice hot day.","lnashsig","Jul 16, 2011"

A hint of lemon zest or orange peels in there as well, brightening it up very nicely. The flavor was superb for the style. Lots of coriander and spices running through it, a touch of clove and an almost banana like flavor in the middle. Lots of fresh grass as well in the finish. Wonderful body on this one was chewy most of the time and really just came across very well. Great carbonation kept it lively throughout.","mikesgroove","May 18, 2011"
4.62,25.9,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"22 Oz bottle, date Late April, 2011. The beer pours a hazy straw color with a thick head and decent lace. The smell is fairly complex. I detect orange, bananas, spice (coriander?), and a pleasant bready smell. The taste is the best part of the beer. You can actually taste a hint of clementine, as well as a pithy orange flavor, and then a good bit of spice and a light wheat body. The beer is well carbonated and more dry than most wheat beers. Great beer for a hot day of yard work.","angusblackheart","May 15, 2011"

Sour wheat aroma hit my nose first, followed by yeast and coriander, oranges. Low bitterness with the same characters as in the aroma, a little breadier and slightly herbal. Spicy finish with some lingering citrus and wheat. Medium to light bodied, a little heavier than I expect in a witbier, a bit soapy in texture with lively carbonation.

3.7,0.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Big tower of sea-foam head; cloudy yellow with a very active carbonation. Spiciness of coriander and hops with orange peel and yeast are blatantly obvious in the nose. Rolling crispness off of a fluffy medium body. All the right facets are here ... orange peel and coriander with a light bready malt flavor. Slight tartness evens the playing field, but the yeast does distract a bit more than needed with some chalkiness in the end. Coriander turns around and drops some bitterness, along with the herbal hop, for a pulling semidry finish. A good take on the style: not over spiced, and well balanced aside from the overtone of yeast.","BeerAdvocate","Jan 11, 2011"

The taste is good as well. It has a light wheat flavor with loads of citrus orange peel and clementines. It's dry as hell, but the yeast adds a nice fruity finish. The mouthfeel is fine.

There is also a very nice Summit hops that are a touch leafy, a touch citrus, and overall quite mild. The hop, orange peel, spice, and sweet malt complement each other quite nicely. The beer is fairly medium bodied which adds to its substance. This is a beer worth seeking out.

I was expecting a blue moon with a HUGE slice of orange or a Delirium Tremens with a slice of orange lol if that makes sense. It poured the expected color. The thing i most noticed is that it really differentiated between ""clementine"" and just basic orange. The palate was like a combo of Clementine Orange Peel....the peel big time, and Clove, the clove like Hoegarden. It didnt have the mouthfeel of the Matilda for example, which was viscous and chewy almost. I gave it 90 points for creativity, and delicuousness.
