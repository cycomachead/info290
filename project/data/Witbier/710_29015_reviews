"Great summer beer. My favorite offering from Leinenkugels."
""
""
""
"This is a great brew. It smells and tastes very similar to Fruity Pebbles, which may sound strange but it is very good. This is one of only two wheat ales I've had (the other being Blue Moon) and I vastly prefer this one."
""

""

"What a gem of a beer, great taste and amazing aroma."

"very nostalgic beer for me"
"For me it's horrible. No way!!!!"
""
""
"One of my secret beers I have always loved!   They got the blueberry smell and tase just right.  Like fruity Pebbles cereal."
"Blueberry taste was really enjoyable. Really underrated beer."
""
""
""
"This is brewed by a small family-owned and operated brewery in Wisconsin.  They are very creative and have several varieties of which as stated before this is my fav.  It pours out a very light golden color not very cloudy with a hint of citrus in its smell.  It's got a soft, fruity taste.  It's not too heavy so you can drink it while you're grilling some carne asada on the deck, but it's also good to curl up with while you're listening to some blues."
""
"smooth and pretty good stuff.  I'll have another."
""
"Overall, I was very surprised by this beer. I just wanted to pick up a random cheap 6-pack, and this beer seemed like it might be good. But it was really an interesting brew, with the strong blueberry flavor. It's main strength is also it's main weakness though...I wish the blueberry was a little more subtle. Still a good choice, and I could see myself picking up a 6-pack again, maybe next summer."
""
"I am so in love with this beer!!!  It's light and has a blueberry hint"
""
"Outlier detected. Please enter a review."
""
""
"I think all of Leinenkugels' beers are the same: fruity and delicious, but leave you wishing they had something more distinguishing than which fruit is in this particular beer you're drinking at that moment."

"Overall (3.81) : For as cheap as it is, it's an easy drinking wheat beer. It scratches the surface of the witbier style but can't quite compete with the likes of Hoegaarden or Weihenstephaner. I would buy this beer again, and yes by the six pack. It's easy drinking and very sessionable."
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden-amber in color with a good 1+-finger creamy/foamy white head that settles down to around 2-3mm that lasts the whole drink. Decent sheets of lacing is seen that slips back down the sides of the glass except a few small areas that stick. The aroma is of grains and some citrus zest with a hint of spice. The taste starts out sweet with a slight bitter lemon/orange zest but finishes decent and doesn't last. Seems to be a hint of pine in the mix also. Lighter+ bodied with average carbonation. Overall, it was decent and drinkable."

"O: I've nothing overly negative to say about Sunset Wheat. Not only did it serve as a bridge into the craft world for me, but it's actually NOT bad. Artificial tasting and slightly gimmicky? You could definitely say that. Off-putting? Not quite. My family is quite the fan of Leinenkugel's offerings (as well as some beers I shan't name) and I can always find refuge in Sunset Wheat when the beers start flowing at family BBQs."

"Overall In my opinion this is what blue moon should be. An almost perfect balance of wheat oranges and spices. Blue moon is strong on the coriander. This is a nice witbier. One of my favorite from leinie's. I will buy it over blue moon anyday, but witbiers aren't my favorite style."

"This is one of those beers that serves a purpose, it's a great fruity beer for summer time. I would never drink it otherwise, but it makes a perfect campfire beer."

""
""

"Love this beer. I'm a big fan of all of Leinenkugel's seasonals though. When smelling and tasting the sunset wheat, it resembles fruit loops in my opinion. I could easily drink a six pack of this in a short period of time, and I have. Definitely give this a try if you like fruity tasting beers."

"Picked this up on a whim. Pours a cloudy pale straw color with little head or lacing. The nose is artificial blueberry and belgian yeast. Think a blueberry eggo with some yeasty bread dough on top. The flavor is bready with lots of bitter not fresh blueberries. Not what I expected when I grabbed thus and not something I'd come back to."

"I do not like hoppy beers, and since wheat beers are supposedly one of the least hoppy styles, I decided to try a six pack of this brew. I am not disappointed. Sunset Wheat pours a cloudy orange color. Mine had about a half-finger of head that faded quickly leaving some nice lacing. The smell is only so-so, but the taste is fine, with citrus notes right up front and a kind of 'sharp' quality to it. The mouth feel is lightly carbonated. True to the style, there is only a slight bitterness to the finish. Overall, I find it to be a refreshing brew, and probably a good session beer, though for me a 'session' is usually one. IPA lovers will probably hate it, but for those of us who are not fans of high IBU's, this one will do the job."

"Taste:This beer i can honestly say tastes almost exactly like fruity pebbles the cereal. It has a sort of synthetic fruit taste that isnt very fresh. Finish is a bit sour and leaves a weird taste on the tongue. Overall it tastes like cereal mixed with grain. Pretty different."

"Light tasting wheat beer, not really sold on this beer being worth recommending."
""
""
"I have drank this beer, A LOT. It is archived as one of my all time favorites! My reference is to ""fruity pebbles"" When you drink this beer, it's like dessert yet not too sweet. Surprisingly light and fruity. You can tell it's a wheat beer just by the appearance and taste. This beer pairs well with just about everything, even chocolate. It's too bad they don't make scratch and sniff stickers for this beer, because I would buy them! This is the kind of beer, if you like wheat beer, to buy and drink a six pack in one sitting. Not a disappointment."

"May your beer be cold and your women hot."
"For a relatively affordable beer that you can find almost anywhere, this beer was by far my favorite of the summer. It's similar to something like Blue Moon... slightly citrusy, bubbly and delicious. Perfect for poolside fun & I've never had a friend say anything negative about the brew. Works well for picky beer drinkers."

"O: I'm not a fan because it is so sweet. It goes down good enough though but I don't want another. However, the girls here seemed to gravitate towards this one. My friend said that she doesn't like beer, generally, but likes this one. Go figure."

"I had this in a tasting session and compared/contrasted it with Hoegaarden which also has coriander in it. The Sunset Wheat isn't tempered with orange peel however and I think this is what leads to the anise overtones. I enjoyed it."

"I have fond memories of Leinie's in the returnable longnecks-- I wish breweries would bring back this custom. Nowadays, I really like the amber lager, if available, and would really like to try the ""creamy dark"". But, they really miss with this one. Maybe if they get enough of this crap sent back, they'll replace it with something decent."

"Overall: I was very surprised by this. I picked it up in a mix-six but would definitely grab a full six next time. It's light and fun, and with the lower abv, I could knock a few back in mid-day after some yard work. (Always a plus)"
"Overall : I would pick up a blue moon any day before this beer. THis is an average beer on hot summer day at best !"

"This beer seems to kill it with the ladies during the spring/summer time. It is another one of Leinenkugel's extract style fruity beers. It like the others tastes ""soda-like"". But this one especially tastes like ""Fruity Pebbles"" of all things. It sounds odd but it really does. This beer will always do well in the spring and especially with the ladies with a sweet tooth for beer."

"O: Overall I was not a fan of the beer. I thought that it really didn't taste like a witbier, and seriously was a lot like drinking fruity pebbles. I would have liked to taste more of the beer and less of the fruit flavoring. It's worth trying if you really like fruit beers, but I don't think it's a beer that would draw a person back."

"This one holds a special place in my heart because it was the first ""craft"" beer (albeit possible faux craft, but that's beside the point) I ever had, and it was long before my actual endeavor into craft beers. My friends and I used to go to the store and pick up a few six packs of Sunset Wheat and play video games all night. Those were the days. Upon revisiting, I'm definitely not nearly as infatuated with this brew as I once was, but it's not a bad beer at all. Still remains sessionable and nice for a summertime cool-down."

"OVERALL: This is a lager with blueberry flavor. Pretty average for a lager with moderate artificial flavor. Avoid unless you can't handle the flavor of a real beer or if you simply love blueberries."

"I will say I don't normally enjoy wheat beers but this one isn't that bad and I will definitly try again and may even shop for it. It's good, not great in my opinion. If you like wheats try it. If you don't it may be different enough that you still may want to try."

"This beer pours a very hazy straw color with an enormous head and substantial lacing. The smell is floral, lemons, and oranges. Mouthfeel is about overdone with carbonation. If they could dial that back a little it would be much more pleasing. Taste is a fruitiness upfront that seamlessly gives way to a spicy mild bitterness on the finish. A very average beer, but very drinkable. I wouldn't turn one down."

"Poured from a bottle into a weisse vase, the beer is a hazed, opaque, slightly pale yellow-gold coloring with a thin, white coating of head. Aromas of fruitcake, with a lemony highlight and a slight roasting. Flavors are sharp, with an effervescence that almost obliterates the flavors. The fruit sweetness is short-lived, and there is a tangy floral end flavor that really sours the palate. The aftertaste is watered down, with a touch of floral dashed in there. Bleh, it's turning into a bit of a mess now. Filmy, cloying finish. Not good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy gold with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, fake citrus aromas, and a perfume-like note. Taste is much the same with an artificial aftertaste. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer that is not really all that beer-like in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a decent summery beer, more like an American pale wheat ale than a witbier in some regards. It has a distinct wheat flavor, but is also light and mildy spicy. It's a suitable summer session beer for anyone. Those who aren't particularly adventurous with beer, but do like a Blue Moon from time to time would probably enjoy this. For me, it's a little too indistinct to be a regular summer choice."
"Currently my favorite beer. About a year ago I went to Buffalo Wild Wings where I was introduced to this it. Instead of ordering my usual glass of Hefe I asked the bartender to give me something different. He gave me this and immediately I tasted fruity pebbles cereal and fell in love. Needless to say I was feeling so good when it was time to leave, i forgot to ask what the name of the beer was. After a few more attempts and the same results, I finally asked the name BEFORE I asked for the ""fruity pebbles"" beer. They told me and I've been buying it ever since....I love this beer!"

"Pours a cloudy pale yellow color, nice carbonation, with a pretty nice one-finger fizzy white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some yeast notes, lemon, and some nice fruityness. The taste is malty, yeast, fruity, with some citrus notes. Medium body. A nice brew for a hot day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The body of the beer is fizzy and light but seems to have few flavors native to the fundamental brewing process; almost all of the flavorings seem imported after the fact, and these seem oily and aromatic and thus made this beer taste like furniture polish or something even more industrial; the top notes are falsely fruity, but below that are the more citrusy, Lemon Pledge sorts of effects, with other odd chemical notes. This beer, in its thinness and weird, artificial tang bears no resemblance to a typical Weizen. I tried to get used to it with a gamey sense of experiment, but the sense that I was drinking unpleasant chemicals in the name of beer actually got more offensive as I persisted."

"12oz bottle out of a summer sampler, pours a cloudy yellow with trace orange hues, foamy white head dissipates quickly leaving little lacing on the glass. Aromas are sweet and odd hinting wheat, orange Tang, cherry, and blueberry. Tastes are complex, but are also odd, especially for the style: fruity yeast reminiscent of a canned fruit cup, orange zest, lemon, grass, wheat, blueberry, and maybe a hint of agave, not much for spiciness as you would expect for the style. Mouth-feel is thin for a wheat ale, but not terribly thin. Plenty of carbonation and finishes on the palate tangy and tingly. Overall, this was weird for me. Blueberry, orange Tang, fruit cup? It kept me thinking about it as I drank it, but that's about it. I guess I'd take it over a macro-lager, but it's not much better than that."

"Nothing wrong with the appearance, it's a bit hazy with a smallish head. Smell is sharply sugary, watermelon Jolly Ranchers comes to mind. Taste isn't nearly as sugary as the smell, but nonetheless it's sweet, sort of like off-brand strawberry or raspberry flavored jelly beans. Mouthfeel and carbonation are okay. This one is not for me."
""
"I must agree with a previous poster. As soon as you taste this beer you think, "" Fruity Pebbles "". Pretty good beer, Although surprisingly not as easy to drink as what you would imagine. A little too sweet for my liking. I believe that drinking enough of these would make me feel sick to my stomach. Although, A great beer to get if you're throwing a party and inviting a couple of girl's who won't drink most beer."

"I don't know what people are saying but this beer is delicious! It's like juice and beer in a bottle. I love its fruity aroma mixed with a unique beer taste. When I tried this stuff at a party the flavor took me by suprise. Maybe I am just used to crappy beers or something and the others can afford pricey ones. I would say this is one of my most favorite beers."

"I found the wheat secondary or tertiary to this flavor. The mouthfeel was smooth with a light body. Not a beer I will try again as it was much to fake and sugary tasting - like a low grade malt bevereage."
"Until the aftertaste, this a straight up wheat. Aftertaste has a sugary, artificial aspect that is a bit off-putting. It ain't bad, but it ain't great. Drink it if someone else is buying."

"I wasen't really a wheat beer guy, but I really like this one. Love the cloudy look almost like orange juice. Pour so you get a nice head, its thick 2-3 fingers in a tulip glass.Fruity not bitter at all, I also like the corriander taste. A nice easy drinker! Always in my fridge."

"Poured from bottle. Has a nice orange cloudy appearance with off-white head the settles into a film over the beer. Smells citric with a hint of a sweeter fruit which I cannot quite place. Tastes somewhat acidic, a nice start and mid-point but is overtaken by too much coriander that lingers after the finish. Has a medium mouthfeel that lingers with the aforementioned coriander flavor. Overall a nice break, but the flavors are not very well balanced."
""
"Appears a very light gold with a distinct fruity/citrus smell. Tastes exactly like Fruity Pebbles- there's no other way to describe it. Overall, a very unique beer that's perfect for long day of golf in the hot sun."

"O: This is the second time I've reviewed this beer for a website, and to be honest, I swore I'd never revisit it. Looks like I contradicted myself. In any event, this is not nearly as cloying and syrupy as I remember. To be honest, this would be an acceptable summer beer or a good one for when I don't really want to think too hard about what I am drinking."

"This one pours from the bottle orange hue with a large fluffy white head. Sweet wheat aroma, some honey, hay, bit of citrus. Flavor follows with a sweeter citrus, light flavor, and a finish more crisp than other wheat beers I have had. Hint of yeast and light mouthfeel overall, nice for summer. Okay wheat beer, but there are better summer options out there. Would choose this over Blue Moon without a doubt. Meh."

"Bonus that this offering is union made by my brothers and sisters in the UAW."
"Poured this 12 oz brown bottle into a pint glass. Poured a hazy yellow color, produced a below average white head, retention is above average and does leave some lacing behind. The aroma consists of sour lemons. Medium in body, this Witbier has a flavor of bitter lemons, wheat and more LeMONS! I guess this would be a decent gateway beer, but there are so many better Witbier's in the market that I wouldn't waste my time with this. Prost!"

"Overall - Very unique flavored witbier that is light and crisp with a lot of ester flavors. Too fruity for me to drink regularly, but definitely a change of pace. Very drinkable. An above average witbier."
""
""

"Overall an interesting taste and a local beer that I would drink again but not frequently. I will look for this on tap. Shout out and best regards to the Leinenkugel family and their brewers."

"Half finger head with little lacing on a murky golden and crimson body. Very little to the aroma with hints of wheat and a Maury presence. Mostly wheat but overall a rather bland flavor. Not mcu else is there that is easy to detect. High carbonation and light body. Very crisp and refreshing. Overall a plain beer for the masses. Easy to drink but offers little else."
"Cloudy gold with a small white head of nice consistency. Soft fruity aroma with notes of lemon and apricot. Taste is much the same with a sweet malt and wheaty edge. A bit of lemon soda pop and that touch of apricot. Very mild bitterness. Crisp light feel with lightly prickly carbonation. I want to put this beer down as a pretender but I can't. While not a Belgian wit it nonetheless carries off the style. a bit to the left maybe but still it gives me a lot of what I want from a Witbier. It has a good overall drinking experience and a respectable taste. Not bad..."
"O: This was a decent wheat beer – the lemon tartness gives it an unique character."
""
"Pours out a murky dark brownish-orange with a short lived fizzy soda head, no lacing, smells exactly like blueberry lemonade and I have absolutely no idea why. A little internet research reveals that this blueberry addition is intentional. Flavor follows the nose, only quite a bit farther into sweetness than I prefer my witbiers, maybe this would be a good one for your wine cooler-enjoying friend. Spritzey carbonation and thin body, its obvious that they are going for the lawnmower market. If only it didn't have such an unappetizing appearance and wasn't so cloyingly sweet, I would get along with this one a lot better than I have. As it stands, it practically another (redundant) Berry Weiss."

"all in all not a terrible beer at all. make no mistake, it won't be challenging the plinys and KBS's of the world for BA supremacy, but i'd say it has its place on a hot summer day. unfortunately it is now January 12th."

"O- This was not bad but a little sweet for my liking. I most likely won't buy this again."

"I used to carry this on tap when I bartended in Florida. I am not always a fan of the wheats, be they Heffes, American Wheats or Belgian White styles....but this on draft was amazing. It is a beautiful yellow color pouring into a pint and the heady smell of freshly made blueberry waffles fills the entire bar. Nope, I'm not kidding. Many patrons asked what it was I was making in the back of the pub...then I'd throw them a taster of this. It is perfect for summer though it isn't overly, overly sweet. I still found it incredibly refreshing and lacking in the typical skunk of the wheat brews. While it loses it's preciousness aroma-wise in bottle, the taste remained pretty true. Totally dig!"

"O: Not bad, but not all that good, either. This one showed up in my fridge after a party, so I thought I would try it out. Not one I would plan to buy again."
""
""
"Overall, if you try it fresh, it's pretty good. unexpected in some ways, but certainly drinkable. Don't let it sit too long or it starts to lose some of its appeal (though I feel like that's not necessarily unique to this beer). Check it out, especially if it's cheap. It might surprise you"
"O: The beer is both easy to drink and refreshing. The berries add an interesting twist and make the taste a bit different compared to other beers in the style."
"This is our opinion at the end of the kegs last few."
"I got a few bottles in a Leiny's sampler. I tried one bottle and went back to the store where i bought 12 more. It's a tasty refreshing beer, ideal for a summer night. If I can find it consistently, I'd keep this stuff in a regular rotation and drink it all year long."
"The creamy feeling on the palate combined with the fruity taste makes it the best summer brew I've ever had."
"Overall - ...I can't really say this is a BAD flavored wheat....but its entirely dependent on your enjoyment of a fruity taste. Its bizarre to me, it really is."
"I'm a big fan of Leinenkugel's, and Sunset Wheat is no exception to this. It's a sweeter, refreshing beer. It's a great summer beer, right up there with Summer Shandy. Sunset Wheat has a very fruity smell, almost like Fruity Pebbles to those of us who can remember that cereal. This is a very drinkable beer that I expect anyone could drink. Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat doesn't disappoint."
"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a thinfilmy white head that faded quickly. The beer has a candy-like orange aroma with hints of lemon and wheat, seems a bit medicinal. It tastes kind of like an orange vitamin, it's not bad though, the orange peel is the dominant flavor along with wheat, yeast, and some spice. The beer is light with moderate carbonation and a refreshing finish. This is an above average wit, kind of tastes like those gummy orange slice candies, I would drink it again."
"Overall, an easy drinking summer beer."
"O- the first time i tried this i thought it was blueberry syrup, this try the beer was nice and cold as was not a simple blueberry wheat. very asthetic beer but still not my choice of a fruity wheat as the blueberry flavor is not the sort i prefer."
"O: I've heard people tout beer and Fruit Loops as a great breakfast. With Leinenkugel's sunset wheat, you don't even need the cereal. An awkward example of the style."
"O: a really pleasant brew, very refreshing after mowing the lawn in the hot summer heat, overall nice"
"Enjoyed this beer overall. Felt a bit like a girl for liking it, but I would definitely have it again."
"Overall, this is a perfect summer beer."
"D: A very drinkable refreshing summer beer, but it is almost too fruity. Enjoyed it more the first time I tried it than today's re-tasting for this review."
"Pours a hazy light amber with good carbonation and a thin layer of head. Smells like fruity pebbles…tastes like fruity pebbles. Body is moderate. There is more citrus flavor in this than in a bowl of the cereal though. A crisp wheat and lemon/orange finish. Good summer beer, highly drinkable, and my BMC friends LOVE it."
"Pass."
"D: I will return."
"Not great but I like this for it uniqueness alone. Worth trying."
"Leinie's answer to Blue Moon, the Sunset Wheat. This beer has a kind of artificial orange flavor to it that dominates. It is easy to drink (if you like oranges) and an interesting take on witbier (if you like oranges, anyway)."
"Bottle. Smells fruity, lemons and oranges mostly, with some hints of wheat and blueberry. Tastes very sweet, probably the sweetest beer I’ve ever had. ThaBobfather is right, it does taste like fruity pebbles. It’s a good flavor, but kind of weird for a beer I must say. The oranges, lemon and blueberry flavor come out as soon as it hits your tongue... perhaps a bit too strong as it overpowers the wheat, malts and yeast. You can hardly taste the hops, but the yeast does come through a bit more at the end. Very smooth on the tongue, and the citrus flavor lingers around after you’re done. Not bad, but as others have said you can only drink a few before the sweetness gets to you."
"O: IMO this is a very Disjointed brew. i dont know what else to say other than I wont be drinking this again. IMO very major pass on this brew."
"Overall-this beer seems to be ambitious, but it falls flat on its face. The berry flavor mixed with the sweetness is too much for me. I had high hopes here but this beer was just not refreshing on a hot day, frankly that was its only role."
"Overall: I am not typically a fruity beer type, but this was a very good summer beer. Refreshing."
"My hatred for a beer is generally measured by my ability to consume it. This beer has nice structure, appropriate body, and has good color. But the taste is not getting me there--there's alot to this that I am having a hard time consuming. I finished 3/4 and got sick of being lazy, dumped it, and got something else from the cooler. This might be the second one from this brewer that I've really disliked. They obviously know how to brew beer, they just make some very bad choices in the process."
"O - Nearly Perfect."
"I poured this one into a pint glass, it has a cloudy golden color body with a nice fizzy white head, which hangs around for a little bit, then faids down to a thin lace. The smell is fruity, i sence some lemon and blueberry and a little bit of wheat. The taste of the first sip is like fruit loops, then the lemon comes out and the blueberry. Then a little bit of hops hits the back of the tongue. Great mouth feel and smooth going down. Overall i think this is a good beer and could drink it more often."
"This beer enjoyed at the abner pub in Norman, ok. This beer pours a hazy golden color with a trace of white bubbly head that retains a little bit, but laces poorly. The aroma is strong with orange, orange, orange, some blueberry an a little spiciness. The taste has wheat notes with an abundance of orange, blueberry and finishes with some spiciness. The mouthfeel is somewhat empty. Overall an ok wheat during summertime... But a little too fruity for my taste."
"Well, I figured this was going to turn out quite bad and it did. I didn't drink this beer fast enough and ended up with a licorice laden blend of fruits and anise. Not enjoyable to me, really, but okay, well I tried it."
"Summary - Definitely not a beer to swoon over, but as far as the Ballpark goes, this is one of the better choices. Better than any light beer, refreshing, and a good drink on a hot day. I would drink it again, at the ballgame, but not from a six-pack at home. Recommended with a slice of lemon."
"O) I don't mind drinking this on occasion, usually with an orange slice. This beer is okay. I would have rather had it golfing, which would have saved me from thinking about what I'd rather be drinking. Oh well, could be worse."
"Eh, this was better than I remembered (last time I had this it gave me a stomach ache), but still not worth the $8.49 or whatever the sixer cost. I can get nearly any other craft in Ohio of the same format for that price."
"It should also be noted I get none of the blueberries mentioned in the 'notes' section above, nor does the brewer's info on the box (which does mention the beer being brewed with coriander)."
"Drinkability/overall- this beer is all right its nothing i could really session that much cuz to me its just to sweet to really pound away, the flavor is a bit over the top to me in terms of citrus and fruit notes, its just a bit to much for my liking but dont get me wrong this is not a bad beer but just not one i could usually see my self sitting around drinking often"
"For me this was a completely average wheat beer. I liked it ut nothing stood out. It would be a good baseline wheat beer to try. It is decent all the way around but not great. I consider it a good value beer - not as good as Tom Brady in the 6th round but still good. A beer that you can have a case of."
"This stuff isn't too bad. The berry flavors add something a little different. Just a tad better than Blue Moon in my opinion."
"Direct from the Leinie Lodge to my glass, the Crack & Glug produced two fingers' worth of thick, burbling, bone-white head with limited retention. Color was a very cloudy orangish-yellow, like fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice. Nose was very fruity and cereal-like and previous reviewers' mentions of Froot Loops and Fruity Pebbles were spot on. I have not had that type of cereal in years, but the nose definitely conjured up memories. I even got hints of anise underlying all of the fruitiness. Mouthfeel was medium with a riot of fruit flavors on the tongue, a citrusy-lime being the one that stood out. Finish really had a cereal taste to it and for a second I really thought that I was in-taking children's breakfast cereal. I have had better examples of the style, but it was not bad, just kind of odd and sometimes that CAN be good. I would put some in the cooler as a lower ABV alternative and as a refreshing alternative to the many IPAs that I would want for myself."
"The beer was a really nice hazy golden orange color with a foamy white head on top what gave off a pretty good lacing. The smell is so refreshing, It's got orange, melon, blueberries, lemon and the some nice grainy aromas coming through. The taste is a sweet but not disgustingly sweet. It's got a great balance in my opinion between the fruity sweetness and the grainy base of the beer. The fruit flavors are dominant throughout the beer but maintain their strength and don't become bland. The mouthfeel is very smooth and lightly carbonated. This beer could easily be drank very quickly. This is my ""goto"" beer for the summer season. Seldom will I pick something other than this one if it's available."
"O - Really just an okay to subpar beer. The smell really kills it for me, waiting for it to warm up a bit to try it again at a warmer temperature. I wouldn't buy this beer again but it may be a good one to try if you are easing your way into the Wit style."
"2.) Leinenkugel Sunset Wheat - Nice, smooth, 4.9% alcohol."
"O/D-A bunch of my friends who are not beer savvy love this one. It is not as bad as I was expecting but overall I would not purchase it. It sits a a bit rough in the stomach for some reason. But better than expected."
"Poured a cloudy golden with some carbonation, and a foamy two fingers of white head. Garnished with an orange wedge. Citrus and sweet sugars in the aroma. Sweet malty taste, and very citrusy, almost juice-like. Some hop bitterness makes its way through. Light mouthfeel, and fairly drinkable, but a bit on the sweet side for my taste, and lacking the crispness that--to me--defines a good witbier."
"Overall, I wasn't really ""feelin"" this beer...the licorice taste turned me off a bit...and honestly, I would have done better buying a nice German Hefe....This one is NOT for me..."
"This is an above average beer. I gave it 7.3/10, or a C. A very citrusy and “fruit-peel” tasting beer. Has an excellent head and excellent retention, yet the mouthfeel is just right. It’s odd to note that the bubbles in the head are white and much tinier than suds in other beers. Almost like a fine soap bubble. ..I hope there isn’t soap in this beer. This beer is like a cross between beer and orange juice, the wheat is somewhat masked by the coriander. Perhaps it would go good with breakfast. I’d drink it again."
"I do not give a Schlitz for Sunset Wheat. However, I will be giving out six packs as gag gifts in the foreseeable future. Did I mention that it tastes like Froot Loops?!"
"Overall Drinkability - Refreshing and balanced. Good overall drink."
"O - The first time I had this beer was on tap in a bar in Austin and I was blown away. I'd love to try it on tap again. Still a solid beer when bottled. Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Give it a whirl."
"Had this on-tap tonight at the Cavs game. I was originally going to wait until the middle of the summer to give this one a try because I figured it would be a great summer beer and I was right. I won't give it a full review but I agree with what has already been said this beer tastes like fruity pebbles. The beer is on the sweet side but for me the berry / fruit flavor didn't make the sweetness a turnoff. Overall I enjoyed it and it would be something I would only drink again in the summer."
"Surprisingly good beer! I had never heard of this Beer when someone offered me one at a party. Popped it open and loved the taste and the smoothness. In fact, it was phenomenal because the aftertaste was like Fruity Pebbles! I would definitely recommend this beer to anyone"
"Pours a cloudy amber color with a fast diminishing head that leaves some lacing around the glass. The most noticable scent is citrus with a lesser scent of wheat. Has decent texture to it that make for easy drinking. Taste is mostly that of orange flavor and other citrus. Something different to try for the summer season when out grilling but nothing all that different."
"0 - not my usual, but a good representation of the style. Probably a good choice for the novice beer drinker because of its sweet, fruity qualities."
"Overall this was an average Wheat Ale with a nice tasty and refreshing drinkability. Would be good on a hot summer’s day when you felt like having more than just a couple..."
"Sahhh-Wheat! Leinies Original. This is the fruity pebbles of beer. Make you say Yabba-dabba-doo! If you want a sweet beer this is it. Golden yellow and opaque. Nice little inviting head. Smell of sweet and sour candies. Taste great as a desert beer cooking weenies over a campfire watching the sun go down on the beach. Perfect!"
"D- ... drinkable. Had it in a restaurant on one of the coldest days of our Georgian winter (30 degrees, haha). Can't wait to enjoy it even more during the summer while sitting on the porch swatting the gnats away."
"Pours a cloudy orange with a good off white head. Smells like Fruit Loops, and unfortunately tastes a little like it as well. I can't understand this beer. It is flat on the palate and tastes rather artificial. I don't know what they were thinking with this beer, but I don't like it. Strangely though I have a friend who really does like it. But then again, he really likes Fruit Loops."
"Bought a pint of this stuff at a local spring training baseball game. Not impressed at all. The beer was a yellowish hue, not even a bit of gold. The beer tasted very light, not like any other witbier I have had and tasted more like hoppy water than beer. An immense amount of frothy head mixed with an overabundance of carbonation left this beer as a total disappointment. It could be worse, but not by much."
"D-I know this doesn't have alot of complexity to it but man is this stuff good. SO easy to drink. doesnt even taste like beer! love this stuff"
"Pours a very hazy golden yellow orange color with a thick white soapy head and a good amount of lacing. Smells of blueberry pancakes, spices, and wheat. Tastes of slight blueberry, wheat malts, coriander, nice spices. Mouthfeel is medium with a heavy carbonation. Drinkability is good."
"Overall-Nice drinkable wheat. I think the fruitiness would be a bit bothersome after a while but I suspect it might get purchased again if the price and mood were right."
"D: Good light drink. Not too sweet."
"I think sunset wheat is a solid beer. It is a bit fruity, and I can see where others are getting hints of fruity pebbles from its aroma. This is a great summer beer, because it goes down easy and leaved you wanting more. If I could change a few things, I would decrease its sweetness and increase the ABV. 4.9% just isn't enough for a wheat beer, it needs that little extra kick."
"Overall a fair beer."
"From notes: On tap at a Washington Nationals baseball game poured into a plastic cup. Pours a cloudy orange with a thin white head. Has a nice aroma of citrus fruits and wheat. A little on the lighter side but still refreshing. Smooth and lacking bitterness. A crisp and clean finish. Overall a pretty decent beer."
"D- This is a great beer. Tried it in a restaurant and liked it enough to pick up a six pack. A great beer to have on a hot summer day"
"The Sunset Wheat is a great summer beer. The smell of Fruity Pebbles hits your nose immediately. I explain to people that it smells like one of my favorite cereals. They stick their noses to the glass and a look of surprise shows on their face and stays there after the taste! I prefer no fruit in my beer. The taste should say enough."
"Drinks well. Easy to down and goes with food too. One of my favs from Leine."
"if you are not a fan of fruity wheat beer this one's not for you. i however, love 'em. sunset wheat is a great beer. the taste is somewhere between blueberries and fruity pebbles. its a glass full of coudy golden heaven. the only complaint i have (and i am going out on a limb here) is that its so easy to drink i find myself downing it a little on the fast side. this beer is a perfect hot weather, summery drink."
"Final Notes: A decent wheat beer. Not anything really special, but then again I'm not a huge fan of wheat beers anyway. Definitely a beach-side or yard work thirst quencher."
"This beer finishes crisp and clean and is very easy to drink. would be great on a hot day."
"D- Finishes good with really no aftertaste. A hot summer day beer."
"Drinkability- This is a great beer. It has a pleasant, medium body with medium carbonation. Sadly, the fruit overpowers the wheat and really defeats a lot of the purpose that the subtler wheat tastes could give this beer. It is deceptively sweet."
"There's a citrusy flavor initially. decent body with a lower level of carbonation. The finish is mildly sour. light stone fruit finish of alto of and cherry."
"Conclusion: A very enjoyable blueberry flavored wheat. I would categorize it as a fruit beer because the blueberry is so strong, but because I love blueberries that doesn't hurt the score."
"Pours a cloudy orangeish gold color. The smell is that of fruity pebbles oddly enough but you do smell the beer alcohol afterwards. First taste is that of fruity pebbles and then fades off into a medium beer taste and is followed by the after taste of fruity pebbles. Feels zesty in the mouth almost like the feeling, without the taste, of lemonade. Easy to drink in moderation to sweet to get carried away."
"D-Better than some other sad options and I would for sure drink it over any macro. It kind of has its place in the world for a cheap summer beach beer I guess. Sure beats Corona."
"D~ Can definitely drink a 6 pack of these without any problems, doesnt fill me up too fast."
"Drinkability suffers from over-pronounced fruit flavors, particularly the blueberry. May be satisfying on a warmer day, if nothing better is available."
"I forget what I paid for a 6 pack, but I honestly enjoyed every bottle of it."
"Despite the Fruity Pebble esque taste...I like this, they could have ruined this beer by adding just a little bit more of the blue berries or hops and it would have probably be horrendous but this is perfectly balanced: not too bitter, not too fruity....i would buy this again"
"First impression, yup that smells like blueberries. Traditional cloudy wheat beer look. White foamy head that doesn't last long. Taste is definitely of some blueberries, even though the ""fruity pebbles"" comments may be overstated some. Light and fizzy in your mouth, and easy to drink. I would recommend this for a nice summer beer, but I wouldn't seek it out regularly. For my first Leinie's tasting, not bad and I'll keep an open mind about their other brews."
"drinkability: well balance and not overly infused with wheat flavor, pleasant to drink without overdoing on the berry flavor."
"Does anyone else taste Fruity Pebbles when drinking this beer? It certainly is a refreshing summer beer, but I can't get over the fact that it tastes like my favorite childhood cereal. I personally wouldn't buy more than a pint or so, but my parents seem to enjoy it."
"The pour in my pilsner glass resulted in a two finger head of rich white foam which settled down to a light covering of wispy lace on the surface and sides of the glass. Color is a cloudy amber, rating a 8 on the SRM beer color chart. Rich aroma of berries and wheat, with a hint of spices. The taste was not expected from the smell. A rich cascade of rose flavored spices, light orange, mulberry, and rich malt and aged wheat. Full body rush over my tongue and palate, ending with a sort of raspberry finish on the back of my throat. Yes I would like to drink this again. I would like to share this with my drinking buddies, as they would be in for a surprise in wonderful taste."
"On tap at the Yardhouse in Dedham. Served in a standard pint glass. Cloudy yellow body with a fizzy white head. Smell had a bit of citrus to it. Taste was a bit unusual. I find it odd that there was a hint of blueberry in a witbier. I still cannot figure out why every Leinie beer I try has some weird Fruity Pebbles cereal fake fruit flavor in it. I guess that's their marketing angle. Mouthfeel was decent for the style; fairly smooth. Drinkability was just average in my book. I wanted to have something easy at the end of the night, and I end up with this fruity beer. I should have just ordered a witbier that I knew was good. This just re-enforces my belief that I have not found a Leinie beer that I like yet. Will I keep searching? Not sure."
"Drinkability - Relatively so, however, I could never drink multiples of this. Too sweet for me. Glad I was able to buy a single instead of a six pack."
"Final Thoughts: For an impulse 6 pack buy, this beer gets Two Huge Thumbs Up!!! This beer surpassed my expectations and is something that I would certainly by again."
"Again, this is not a beer to pick up if you're looking for a Witbier. It's a fruity beverage that has a lot in common with ""malt beverages."" I rather like it though."
"Fine enough mouthfeel. Body and carbonation are about right for the style. Probably would get a little cloying after several of these but went down easy."
"Again, this will probably go over well with people who like malt beverages and who don't like beer all that much. But for me, as a person who loves wits, I know there are many that are better."
"Drink it up, drink it down, lucky lips all year round. Certainly drinkable, certainly tasty. Good with filet mignon and hot dogs for sure. Hold the ketchup but lay on the mustard. Little pricey, but definitely suck it down."
"I've tried this one a while back, and was glad to review again before the summer ended."
"D: This is easy to drink for the most part, but it does get sweet after awhile. A session beer, but you can find better."
"D-Okay for a few but astringency and fruitiness overwhelms if looking to knock down a pile of these."
"D: All day"
"D- It is easy to drink a ton of this no problem. Kind of might get sick though from the sweetness. Overall though a easy drinking summertime beer. This is what is was suppose to be....mission accomplished."
"D: Exceptional. This is perfect on a hot summer day to cool off, or in the middle of the winter to remind you of summer."
"From a 12 fl. oz. bottle marked Sep 13 2010. It pours a somewhat hazy, golden yellow with a decent enough white head. The aroma is full of red or black raspberry along with the wheat. The taste also has a nice wild berry type flavor with a nice wheat quality and thin hops. A refreshing beer."
"Probably would choose another wheat beer like a Bell's Oberon over this one."
"Pours completely hazed dark straw, with a nice, creamy white head. Smell is grainy fresh and fruity as all get out - Fruit Loops and Fruity Pebbles come to mind. Taste is a little more mellowed out than the smell, but seriously, this tastes like beer cereal. I suppose it's carbonated ok.. but the finish is a little thin, quick, and sour for my taste. A novelty, but interesting, also for the fact that this beer seems to be pretty popular. Enough for it to replace Leinies I liked, such as Big Butt and Northwoods."
"One of my favorites, and I am picky. Nice, creamy thick head that hangs out for a few minutes. The smell makes me want to swallow more. Slighly cloudy, good color. My first drink of this beer surprised me, the mouthfeel is surprisingly thick. I like my porters and stouts but this is always in the fridge."
"Overall, Sunset Wheat is one of my favorite domestic wheat beers. It's always a great beer to recommend to someone just getting into the craft brew scene, if they like fruity pebbles that is, but who doesn't. Glad they keep this in stock at the local gas station."
"Being a fan of Witbier, I thought that this rumored to be ""overly fruity"" beer would leave me disappointed. Instead I was only moderately satisfied. Overall I had a good time drinking this beer. Its taste and appearance were nothing too special. In fact I did not taste as much of the fruit flavors as others did who tried this before me. This might because I was expecting a lot more fruitiness and was pleasantly surprised when it was not as strong as I had been told it was. After finishing the bottle, I realized that this beer was texturally smooth and drinkable beyond my expectations. If I had tasted it in proper glassware I might have been even more pleased. All in all, an okay choice for a summer afternoon."
"Poured a 12 oz bottle on a 16 oz pint and it created a nice 3 inch head. The head slowly faded away and left behind a nice lace on my glass. The aroma is very appealing and the taste is very satisfying. Mild citrus flavors bounced around in my mouth as I savored this beer. There was very little to no aftertaste in every sip and that makes you want to take the next sip."
"The leinenkugels sunset wheat is dark in color but does taste like most dark beers it has a great blueberry or mixed berry flavor to it that makes it my favorite of all of the leinenkugel family of beer it has a great mouthfeel and smell I would say anyone if they like beer or not would most likely enjoy one of these"
"Not sure it qualifies as a Witbier, but an interesting taste makes this one I would try seasonally."
"Great fruity aroma, Great hop aroma, but low bitterness (how I like it), on the sweet side but I would still say it's balanced. Pours a great head, but doesn't keep it long (normal with the style)"
"Hmm. This beer does taste like Fruity Pebbles like the cereal. I'm sure that wasn't there intention but that how it ended up. It not to bad but it's a Miller Product which sux. If they were by themselves I would give them cuddos on this beer.It does have a good taste it went well with my Chinese food. But it's a summer beer kill the time beer."
"This beer was pretty drinkable and went down quite easy. It was a bit refreshing but lacked a bit in overall taste. It had a nice crisp feel and was a good summer beer to have at a cookout or at the beach."
"Perhaps if this beer was categorized as a fruit beer then I would not be so harsh in my review. But then again, it's the sweetest and least beer-like fruit beer I've ever tasted."
"Very blueberry taste, reminds me of fruity pebbles. good head that goes down but doesnt dissapear, very cloudy. One of my absolute favorites in the Leinenkugel family, great summer beer when sitting at an outdoor bar or by the pool. It is a must have beer and great blueberry/ fruity taste"
"My first impression of this beer was ""wow."" Now, I agree with some other reviewers, in the sense that it did have a lot of fruit flavor, but I thought it definitely worked with the beer. The predominant flavor was blueberries with wheat, which is a fantastic - if unexpected - combination. Maybe it's not the same as every other witbier, but maybe that's what makes it a good beer."
" I like most of the beers Leinenkugel puts out, so I will give this beer another try by the end of summer."
"Drink: I wouldn't take another one of these for free."
"And since when did Leinie's become an $8 a 6 pack beer? Rip-off."
"Overall a decent at best summer wheat beer. It needs more hops and less sweetness."
"The taste is consistent with the smell. I really thought something had happened at the brewery and they had inadvertently mixed one of their berry beers with this. I could only finish about half of one of these. The berry flavor tastes to me like it doesn't belong in there."
"M- Not good feeling. Very, very carbonated. To the point of being painful. The finish is slick and a bit syrupy."
"this is not my idea of a witbier. nose of fruit loops. a wheat beer with cornmeal in it. color is a bit more orange than expected. made me feel like i was drinking something made for 16 year old's. palate of citrus, corn starch, and sugar cane. as expected a pretty big waste of time. i'm being lenient by calling it average."
"I think the fruity sweetness is too much. This isn't something I'd buy, ever."
"Drinkability: Not bad for a wheaty summer brew. Not quite the flavor I expect from a true 'witbier'...but not bad either. Maybe just a tad too sweet and fruity."
"D: Not too bad. The flavour is quite good, but it's gets a little too sweet at the finish for my tastes. Don't know why people diss this one."
"Taste has quite a bit of grapefruit flesh, lemon zest and even concord grape juice flavors. Grainy and bready malt with a little spice and hop zing on the finish. Wheat tanginess gives it a snappy and refreshing aspect. I like this more than I thought I would, easy to drink and my glass is draining rather rapidly. Dont think I will be rushing out to buy a six-pack of this anytime soon, but would I drink it again? Most definitely."
"D - Surprisingly not drinkable, as the taste on this one kills it."
"D- ive found most of the leinenkugals offerings to be too sweet, and this was no exception. this isnt something ill have too often. it is a nice choice at restaurants that only have the other BMC offerings on tap or in bottles."
"D- This is another one of lienie's decent beers but nothing that is worth many repeated visits for me. Another one of of those ones that we may owe some credit to for being an intro-to-craft, even if it isn't a great beer in and of itself."
"It's been said before, but this one smells exactly like fruity pebbles. One of the more citrusy beers around. Fruit flavor is prominent and completely overpowers the beer. A big fruity pebbles taste. It is a bit of a gimmick beer, but it is tasty and an easy drink"
"D: For this style I think it is a little more difficult to drink than others. Contrast against the Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy which for its ""radler"" style is much had good drinkability."
"I would like to try something else darker or more flavorful from them to get a better idea of what they are capable of."
"I did enjoy this beer- but should someone ask me for an example of a fine wheat beer-- I don't think I'd chose this one to carry the wheat beer reference banner."
"D: With a nice spicy after tone, this beer still goes down smooth and is refreshing, a nice summer beer that is not too light."
"D: I went through two glasses over the course of the game. I enjoyed the witbier, especially the strong orange aspects."
"OMG! This is THE Fruity Pebbles beer! Poured a hazy yellow with a light, white head. The aroma is unmistakably fruity pebble-ish with orange juice. However, I get a big dose of berry extract and wheat in the flavor. Light and fizzy, this is a great novelty beer for those who enjoy the cereal, but can also be a great beach beer too. I will revisit this as the weather warms."
"Drinkability: This beer is better than I thought, though maybe a bit too fruity. I'd have it again, but not with other beers available. Certainly worth a taste."
"D:Its not bad but I couldn't see myself enjoying more than two of these at a time."
"D: The flavor was way too artificial for me to really enjoy this. It almost seems like lemon soda mixed with wheat beer. It's certainly different. The low ABV makes it go down quick. It's a beer I probably won't revisit, but I can see it as a decent summer refresher."
"The next time you are out on your deck, down the shore or throwing your next BBQ, I highly recommend grabing a case of Sunset Wheat! This is one of the best and refreshing wheat beers I have tried. The orange taste is already in the beer and is very fruitful to the palate but not overwhelming. To me this is a perfect summer beer that I will enjoy for summers to come!"
"This is a tasty take on a belgian wit but it starts to get a bit too sweet on the palate."
"D - I liked this I would have again given if that is what I was in the mood for here."
"D - Not quite as bad as I was expecting, but I definitely won't be having it again."
"Overall a very good and solid example of a Wit Bier. I can't really fault anything except for a little too much blueberry scent & flavor. I do believe this is intentional by the brewer. I'd like to see a little more lemon zest and about 50% less blueberry. Other than that, we've got ourselves a $5.99/sixer summer winner!"
"It's a Macro-Wit, what do you expect?!? I love Oberon & Hacker, unimpressed by Blue Moon, won't even look at Spotted Cow. This is a beer meant to be consumed on a hot day, in moderation...or more. The orange taste is what makes it fun. No need for an orange slice. Isn't it true, a real beer drinker doesn't add fruit? None needed!"
"D: well on a hot day, light easy to drink. i would have another, but not m favorite wheat beer by far. its a little to sour, as if it was a lemon beer. i would have it again, but it has to be a hot day while im fishing!"
"d - Wasn't a big fan of this beer. I usually like sweet beers but this was way to much even for me. It essentially smells and tastes exactly like fruity pebbles so it was interesting to try, but not something I would have more of or look to have again."
"One complaint I will have with this beer, and most of Liene's brews are that they are all slightly watered down. Like someone has taken an excellent beer and dilluted it to where it is only good. Still very drinkable, but could be SO much better."
"Feel/Drink: Light mouthfeel. I can't finish this, taste is way to off."
"Mouth feel and Drinkability: Very easy to drink and crisp with good carbonation. Nothing too crazy, just a good fruity wheat beer."
"Overall, a decent beer I'd drink with some regularity if it were local to me. I think the beer would be better if they dialed back the berry just a wee bit. Worth trying if you see it."
"Drinkability 3.5: I could definitely drink several of these in one sitting, although it isn't anything exceptionally noteworthy. However, I would definitely recommend it."
"This will have a place in my fridge all summer long. Solid brew for a very cheap price. There are better alternatives but not at this price point."
"Fairly decent feel yet the overwhelming lemon pucker makes it rather thin at times. I'd had this a year or so ago and was convinced it was the worst beer on the planet. Well, it's not as bad as I thought, but it's by no means good. Bottom line, lose the additives and just make beer."
"Overall: Nothing wrong with this beer. It's decent-looking. It smells fine. It tastes good and drinks well. Not bad in the autumn if you ask me."
"i avoided buying this beer because i knew what was in it. luckily, my craft fence-sitting friends picked up a six of this. it's mediocre, fruity, unappealing."
"Poured into my Zatec glass. Cloudy, typical of style. Poured 2 fingers of head that has started to lace. Smells, like I remember. Fruity pebbles. Bam bam BAM! Tastes very much like berries and other fruits. Fruity pebbles. Bam bam BAM! Mouthfeel is a huge letdown. Nearly flat in the mouth. For a wheat, I like it quite a bit, and could drink several in an hour."
"This brew pours a milky, cloudy liquid with a moderately stable foamy white head. The aroma is pretty nice...good citrus and wheat notes...a little grass, some pale malt, and lots of wheat notes. The taste has the familiar wheat twang, a little fruit juice flavor...lemon and pear? It's fitting, however. Not much hop flavor, but wheat is prominent. Could have more yeast character. Good, firm mouthfeel, yet light enough to be refreshing. This on was better than I expected."
"D - I liked this better on the first few sips but it became overly perfumed, sweet and cloying. MASSIVE blueberry. One is enough."
"Drinkability: Overall, it's not terrible, but the sweetness is a bit too artificial as mentioned earlier and I just can't get into it; not awful on a warm night and the ABV is more than manageable at just under %5. There are definitely better available witbiers out there though."
"Lienkugels is a very odd beer. After years of drinking it, I still don't know exactly where I stand with it. Though, as far as witbiers are concerned, I would choose this beer over many. It strange, I have a definite love/hate relationship with this beer that is rather inexplicable. All in all, if you have never tried this beer before, you must. I don't often say that, but its the truth."
"An overly-spiced, overly sweet mess. Up front, the first note was a bit tart and held promise. Then the heavy-handed spicing kicked in - assertive coriander and some anise, followed by a distinctive, almost candy-like sweetness. Far from ghastly, but equally far from good."
"I can drink 3 of these at a sitting but really only did cuz I bought em. Not a terrible beer, but not good either."
"Not sure how many of these I could handle in a sitting. Drank this bottled several years ago, remembered it as being a little better. I think my palate has just gotten a little more judgmental. Probably didn't help that I had this today on the heels of a SA Noble Pils."
"Pours an unimpressive limp orange. Minimal fizzy head. Taste is hollow and cheap. Smell mirrors that. Definitely picking up some blueberry and orange. I hate to say it, but the consistency reminds me of Bud Light Wheat (worse actually). Has no character other than being a very sub-par beer. Clearly inferior ingredients, with a very cheap blueberry/orange flavor happening. On a positive note (and it's not even really that positive), the drinkability factor is slightly redeeming in that the weak taste doesn't linger at all. Although I'd imagine the hangover would taste like you'd been eating rancid fruity pebbles all night. So I guess I could drink a bunch of these if that was the idea, but if you're looking to sit down and enjoy a good wheat, look elsewhere. Drinking this beer is actually making me angry. Possibly the worst beverage I've ever had."
"Overall a the beer is still satisfying and enjoyable to drink, but it is more of an imitation witbier but better than many of its counterparts."
"The beer is pretty good but its a little to fruity. Its tastes mostly like blueberry with a hint of citrus. The blueberry taste is a tad bit overwhelming and kinda makes your forget that your drinking a beer. Although it taste pretty good, I would not buy this again. I just don't like the fruity flavor when it comes to my beer but for those of you who like a fruity beer, I would highly recommend it."
"Drinkability: No thanks. It's a bit watery, a bit too fizzy, and, yeesh, there's that artificial-tasting flavoring quality to it -- for me, it's just subpar in all its facets. So, again, no thanks!"
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This pours a cloudy golden color. Not much head here and the lacing leaves a little something to be desired. I get a citrus smell with a little bit of sweet malt. This beer tastes sweet. Too sweet for me to be honest. This may be a strange point of reference, but it tastes like alcoholic Booberry cereal (anybody remember that stuff as a kid?). There's a bit of a citrus kick, but not much in the way of mouthfeel. The sweetness hurts the drinkability for me. My wife likes this and buys it because I won't drink all of it. She's a smart gal."
"Sunset Wheat smells like an unpeeled orange or a vegetable crisper (in the fridge) stuffed with fresh fruits. Snowflake foam! Pleasantly stable feel to the brew with an unquestionably medium body."
"[Drinkability]: Drinkability is high, a good summer beer!"
"D: Depends on your tolerance for the fruity sweetness. Personally, it was way too much for me to be able to have more than one."
"Overall, I can't stomach this beer, and food doesn't help. I'd rather have any number of other styles or other wheatbeers at a barbeque."
"D - The first beer would go down like the titanic but the next might be a bit reluctant. The fruit flavors are almost too much, sort of masks the taste of the beer."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy, brown color with a 1 inch head. Smell is very fruity and sweet, lots of berries and lemons. Taste is good, a bit milder than the smell but still sweet with considerable notes of lemon and berries. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is highly drinkable. Overall this is an enjoyable beer."
"The mouthfeel is decent. Its thin and well carbonated for its body. The drinkability, for me, is nil. If I had to drink the whole bottle, it would have been a drainpour, but it's my girlfriends favorite beer, so I decided to take a couple of notes for the sake of reviewing."
"D: I can see this being a very drinkable beer, if you take a liking to it. I didn't, but I think it's more of a matter of personal preference than it is a case of a bad beer."
"M/D - An overall good brew from Leinenkugel's, light bodied but a little gritty on the tongue but turns smooth pretty quick. Pretty good wheat brew, not over the top but can taste the wheat. Not a brew I can drink all the time but for sure a good summer sipper. Glad I tried it and recommend it!!"
"D- The gimmick here might get old after a few. I usually have this beer at concerts, as the first Sunset I had was at a Victor Wooten show. It was so tasty and refreshingly easy to drink I ended up drinking about four or five."
"D: Very drinkable, goes down smooth and isn't that heavy so you can have a lot."
"Drinkability: A decent wheat beer and one of Leinenkugel's better offerings. Would be nice on a summer evening..."
"D - Very crisp and pleasing, this beer tastes like the tropics."
"Overall, this is a beer that I wouldn't mind having around as something light to drink with meals."
"D: Drinkability is high as one would expect from what seems marketed as a summer beer. It's pretty easy to put down a bottle and want more, but this is not because it actually tastes like beer. Again, it tastes extremely similar to Fruity Pebbles. If you like the cereal, I see no reason you wouldn't enjoy the taste of this beer.  Do not expect to actually get any beer flavor from this product, but as a beverage it tastes good and drinks well."
"Oh, and orangey orange."
"Pours a hazy yellow in the glass with a small white froth. (Looks more like a hefe than a witbier, but no denying the wheat element.) A pronounced and slightly sweet, but dry bouquet of orange zest, lemon, raspberries, cherries, blueberries (kinda smells like Fruity Pebbles), & light biscuit. (In my opinion, this is the best part of the beer.) The beer is dry and crisp, but refreshing with flavors of bitter orange rind, lemon, white bread, & subtle raspberries on the finish. The beer is light and lean (as to be expected from a witbier), but a little more waterly than I like and offers a slight astringency on the back end. Overall this is a decent beer that, unfortunately, doesn't taste as good as it smells. Although this wouldn't be my first, it wouldn't be my last choice either."
"Drinkability- I can't say I want another, but I can see how someone could session with this."
"Cheers!"
"D - Very drinkable - a very good summer refreshing beer. Nice on a hot day - which today is not - but good nonetheless. ABV sets this beer up for sessioning."
"D: Granted, the cost (free) couldn't be beaten, but I wound up having 4 of these over the 10-hour flight. Surprisingly enjoyable. It's not the best wit I've ever had, but it filled a niche."
"Overall- this is my favorite commercial brew. if a place has nothing but this i wouldn't hesitate to grab this for a second."
"This tastes pretty good, it just doesn't really taste like beer to me - if you want to drink something mild without any bitterness than this is the beer for you."
"This isn't much different from the bottle. The head sticks around a bit longer, and I'd say there's a bit less balance and complexity and slightly less hops presence, not that there's much in the bottle per se. Other than that, I'd say the drinkability remains almost as high and the nice mix of smoothness and crispness remains."
"Poured a pale pumpkin orange with 1.5-2 fingers white head sitting on top. Citrus and a little bit of coriander in the smell. Honestly, fruity pebbles comes to mind instantly. Taste is more of that citrus; more fruity pebbles. Some lemon zest. Honestly, for a witbier, I don't really get that much wheat. Some bubbly effervescense, but kind of watery. Besides for the lack of wheat for a witbier, Sunset Wheat is very drinkable; nice on a warm summer night."
"Well, the beer is not too exciting overall, although it is a bit different from others in the style in that it tastes exactly like Fruity Pebbles. If you ever order this though, I highly recommend that you save yourself the trouble and tell them you don't want an orange slice at the get-go."
"Solid, mainstream witbier/hefeweizen."
"A tasty enough beer, good drinkability. Well done."
"D: high drinkability cause its good"
"Overall I was quite surprised by this experience, especially since I really hated it the first two times I tried it. Not that I would run to a store and buy it, but when I have the next time the choice between Heineken, BMC and this one - I will certainly take the Sunset Wheat again."
"Drinkability - after drinking the high booze double IPA's and many euro lagers, this is a nice change of pace, I have probably gone through a few cases on my own of this already this year, good stuff on a Saturday afternoon, not so much at the pub."
"Poured this beer with the production of a fair amount of foam. It slowly reduced down to a slight amount of lacing. The aroma of sweet hops, wheat, and cloves greats the nose. As the taste follows suit in the sweeter malt with a well balance of hops. The tastebuds pick up on cloves, slight coriander taste and a wheat adjunct. Overall a good beer for the summer season."
"Flavor is similar to the aroma but not quite as bad. There is some breadiness, but the artificial lemon is still there. I can see how some people think this beer is refreshing, but I'd reach for an unflavored hefeweizen or pilsner any day over this stuff."
"This is my first time trying this beer, and I find I like it a lot more than others here. Looks beautiful--unfiltered and golden with a half-inch head (which quickly dissolves). Smells sweeter than it tastes. Smells strongly of citrus, tastes of citrus and spices. Bites the tongue just a bit--it's not overly carbonated, but maybe a little too carbonated for its flavors. Good for drinking on a warm day--it's refreshing. Too heavy to have more than a few though."
"From bottle into S.A. glass. Pours a dark golden color and cloudy with moderate white head. Head mostly diminishes. Aroma of spices and fruit. Wheat, orange, pepper?, lemon, coriander. Good summer wheat beer in my opinion. Easy to drink but not watery at all, very flavorful throughout. Lacing slightly lingers. Good, smooth finish. A good pick as a summer session beer and would work well with guests to a BBQ - Cheers to Leiney!"
"This is a nice, refreshing summer bev. It's nice and light, but a little less intense lemon would be great. It's just not balanced enough. But a nice beer on a hot day."
"Overall a very good beer. I believe it's a low A grade brew."
"This beer poured a clear golden color with a two-finger head. The smell is very citrus, with some definite orange and lemon. The taste starts off with some sweet orange that goes to a tiny bit of hops and spices in the finish. The mouthfeel is slightly watery with enough carbonation to make it crisp. This certainly isn't the best beer in the style, but for a $5 growler you can't ask for much more."
"Tastes like some kind of berry cider hybrid. My girlfriend loves it. meh"
"D: Highly enjoyable on a nice summer day...goes down easy..."
"Pours an orangish yellow color. There is a small head to it. The smell is of orange and spice with some wheat. The taste is of orange at the intial bite and gives way to some spice not sure what and wheat. The overall mouthfeel is not overally carbonated. The drinkability is very high. This is a very good beer smooth and refreshing, a beer that is solid and can please everyone."
"drinkability: Not the best wheat beer out there but I have had worse. A great starter beer for someone learning. I have had mush else from Leinkugels, Hope there are better choices."
"Drinkability: this brew is one I would drink as a starter but I prefer stronger and darker brews."
"Great drinkability - could polish off many of these brews (and have). A very solid wheat beer."
"On second thought, perhaps there is a very minor berry presence. It is, however, very reserved and definitely is in the background. The flavor profile is definitely citrus and bread/yeast."
"The foam was wheat almost white in color, thick, 1 finger length, smooth and lacey. The color was a very hazy honey with light amber highlights - looked like honey in a glass. The smell was sweet, aromatic, honey highlights, hints of orange and wheat and a nice ginger/almond undertone. The first main taste was of orange and ginger with wheat and an undertone of sharp vanilla. Mouthfeel - medium-bodied and spicey. Drinkability - has a wonderfull complex aroma. Had a good time with this beer."
"I make sure to stay away from this beer. way to sweet."
"Poured a pale yellow/orange with a thin white head. Nose of wheat and orange peel. Taste is medium-bodied with citrus flavor dominating this brew. Wheat flavored front is soon replaced with an overpowering orange and spiced yeast taste. pretty good overall but won't go back to it."
"Drinkability: Very good beer for the summer months and something that I could enjoy at other times of the year as well."
"D - The flavor may kill the drinkability here in my opinion. It's just a bit much. The first time I had this beer I hated it. Haven't had it since til now and I'd still opt for something else, but if this was all in the fridge, I wouldn't turn it down."
"The blueberry taste was overpowering. Blech. So sorry, Leiny. I've always considered you a reputable brewery and still do, but this stuff is just plain bad."
"D - OMG drikability, easy to drink a six pack and wonder where they went"
"D: In the summer, you can go through case and case and case and case of this stuff. It's a really drinkable beer. When I first started to drink beers this was one of the first beers I was able to put down easily."
"Drinkability: An interesting beer, but too artificial tasting for me. The whole “Fruity Pebbles” taste might be okay for a near-beer, but not for me. I would suggest this to non beer drinkers as something they may like, but not something that is beer."
"This isn't hard to drink, and it'd be a decent choice for a session beer, but I can't say I'd ever pick it."
"Some might be put off by the berry notes, but I found this beer to be very refreshing and an easy drinker. Low end ABV makes it a good summer afternoon drink that you can trust won't wipe you out. I could see tiring of it over a long session, however."
"Overall I think this is a good beer for a warm summer day."
"Slender lacing makes this beer very drinkable, so pace yourself!"
"This is a re-review 2 years later. This bottle is fresher than the previous review, wasn't avail in Texas 1st time. Again, pours a nice hazy orange with little to no head. Aroma of fruit but is just a bit sweet. The sweetness isn't overpowering but man is this refreshing. I get some orange, tangelo and other fruit's in there. Smooth, clean and refreshing. This may be one of the best summer beers out there and I can't get tired of it. Very good and WAY to drinkable."
"D: I wish I could find this beer in cases. I would be drinking this beer all summer aside from Corona, the staple summer beer. The unique flavor will have you coming back for more."
"Drinkability: One of Leinenkugel's better beers, and with the pretty low price of it it's worth keeping around as a cool off drink."
"This isn't a bad beer by any definition of the word, but I'll pass on buying it again. I've seen this described as tasting like a liquid version of fruity cereal, and I think that fits rather nicely. I wouldn't turn it down if offerred, but my money's going elsewhere."
"It's light enough that it goes down easy, but it was too fruity in an artificial way."
"D - Very very drinkable. Orange feels more subdued with each sip, which is a good thing, and low alcohol means I could drink this all night."
"A favorite of mine, pours a thick head, has an exceptional golden color, great citrusy smell and taste. Very easy to drink several, has a great summer outdoors appeal. Good stuff all around. Even better on tap. A great readily available, go to beer, very representative of a good Sunset Wheat."
"D- Really pretty drinkable. Great summer beer. Refreshing, fruity and light."
"Very refreshing beer, light and flavorful, sessionable on the dock/porch. I drank it on a warm day and an empty stomach, so it went down quick."
"Brownish yellow color that is cloudy to the point of almost being opaque. Light prickle and a light froth head. Fruity nose almost like a raspberry or blueberry character. Smooth sweet attack with hints of blueberry. The flavor is clean and refreshing although dominated by sweet fruity sensations. The fruit is lighter in the flavor than in the nose, but it still is omnipresent. The aforementioned berries are seemingly cut by a citrus type presence. Clean finish and a fresh aftertaste. Very nice even though I didn't anticipate the fruit."
"D: A little bit too sweet to be really drinkable, but a decent cool-me-off beer in the summer."
"Taste is overpowering blueberries and wheat. a lingering yeast quality in the background. One dimensional and bland but goes well after a hot lawn mowing afternoon."
"Overall - Kind of enigmatic. It's certainly not bad, but the flavors don't come off as very natural. My cousin loved it when he had it on draft, and he continues to like the bottled version. I'll definitely drink it, but I probably would not buy it at all if my cousin wasn't a fan of it."
"Final Thoughts: This beer has the rep of being called ""Liquid Fruity Pebbles"" and the nickname is well earned."
"this is an excellent witbier selection, and i without a doubt would have another on a nice spring day. a female friend of mine really enjoyed it as well."
"Drinkability for me is non existent, I had my hands full getting through just the one."
"Smell is ok, not as floral as i would have expected. But the taste is great for a warm day out side with a buddy and the barbecue going. However, for a flavored beer, I found it surprisingly delicious. I will be drinking this again. Very light mouth feel is great for a light beer in the middle of the day."
"An okay beer, easy to drink, but I've had better witbiers before."
"It pours an light orange with a slight wheaty head. There was something abnormally sweet about this one. It tasted very cornish or wheatish, but there was a major artificial sweet taste going on. It went down smooth enough for a wheat beer, but it was just a little off and I could only stomach about 2 of the 6 pack."
"If you can stomach through more than one of these (would say less but I guess I did get one down just because I was so intrigued) I am impressed."
"Poured cloudy gold with one finger of white head. Some lacings. Aroma is citrus. Taste is citrus lemon maybe a touch of orange. Sweet malts and maybe a bit of sugar. Pretty refreshing if served cold on a hot day. Very sessionable if the lemonade flavors suit your fancy."
"D- Well it's a white ale in thought, but I would just call it a wheat ale with a fruit flavor. Not bad cause it goes with the style, and something that would go well with some nice lemon pepper roasted chicken."
" Overall, this was a tasty beer, drinks well and I will probably buy it again sometime."
"Decent thirst quencher but more than a couple might get cloying."
"The overall drinkabily was good I could drink a few of these while mowing the grass. Definately a summer beer, refreshing."
"The blackberry flavor is severely out of balance with the other subtle flavors of this beer, which is too bad. This is a solid beer overall, and can be very refreshing with the fruitiness. I just wish the blackberry flavor was more subtle and natural."
"This is a niche beer. Overall, I recommend it to fans of fruity, summery beers and ciders, but definitely not recommeneded to anyone else."
"D- I drank the rest of this quickly to get it over with and I hate to waste. I won't be going for this again."
"Final Thoughts - I really dig this beer. It has a unique taste of lemon that gives way to an light drinking wonder. My BBQ beer of choice in the summer time."
"I poured my Sunset Wheat into a pint glass. It was a cloudy golden color with maybe a half inch of head. I could smell yeast and citrus, orange and some grapefruit. It has citrus flavors and finishes with anise. It also tastes a bit spicy. It seems drinkable. It is not my favorite, but it went well with a grilled chicken salad."
"D - this beer is ""drinkable"" in the sense that it doesn't have a very high alcohol content, but not in the sense that it is enjoyable to drink"
"The beer poured a light yellow color in my pint glass, with a fairly small head. All I could make out from the smell was black licorice and a hint of grapefruit. When tasting, the black licorice flavor came through. I've also heard people say it tastes like fruity pebbles or trix cereal, I can kind of see that. Overall, I was pretty let down.. maybe this isn't just my type of beer. I will likely finish my 6 then not purchase again."
"This brewskie pours like your typical wheat beer, cloudy yellow and with a thin head of about half a finger. Nose is on the sweet side, citrusy like 7-Up and with essentially no malt or hop notes. Flavor, at least for me is not so hot. Reminds me of those artificial ""malt"" beverages, way to sweet, where that unfiltered wheat flavor. Body is medium, but again I can't get past that sweetness, it hangs with you. I'll be lucky to finish this one."
"Pours a pale yellow color, cloudy, small head, whitish. Grapefruity effervescent aroma. Fizzy, carbonated, fresh, fruity. Like a club soda. Some lemony, grapefruity taste. Strong grapefruit-lemony taste & aftertaste. Alright."
"Dr. Very refreshing and pleasant. Even though it's February, I can see myself in the porch hammock with a book and another one of these in hand."
"This beer pours a cloudy orange color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into nice lacing. The aroma is of orange peel, lemon zest, and faint hints of coriander. The taste is of cardamom, with hints of orange, and lemon. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a very flavorful beer by Leineys standards. It is spicy, but not well rounded. I could drink this again if nothing better were available."
"Appearance is a hazy orange yellow with a thin head and no lace. Smell of citrus and a taste of oranges, lemons and wheat leaving a light citrus bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light with a good spike of carbonation. Not bad, but one I would not run out again to buy anytime soon."
"This beer goes down smoothly, leaves a citrus taste lingering around for a while. Not a strong beer as its only 4.9% but worth it if you like a fuity beer."
"Sunset Wheat is becoming more of a bar staple around here, obviously to compete with Blue Moon. That said, I prefer this to Blue Moon, for its lighter body and ease of drinking. If you don't like sweeter wheat beers, steer clear. However, I for one enjoy this every now and again, especially if I'm at your average central IL bar... and especially if one of my friends is buying!"
"Cloudy opaque blonde with a tight finger of white head, minimal lacing. Smell like, let's see, curacao orange zest, coriander and....blueberries! Tastes much like the aroma, mild and fruity with a lemony puckering quality to balance. Medium light mouthfeel with lively carbonation, reminds me of Blue Moon with blueberries. Might be good on a really hot day."
"color: orange, head: short, aroma: fruit-- citrus, light berry, taste: citrus and berry, as mentioned above, striking similarities to Post's breakfast cereal, Fruity Pebbles."
"Drinkability: Very sessionable. I could sit in the park sunshine and drink these all day."
"Pours a bright hazy golden orange color with a small pure white head that settled into a light ring. The aroma is of fruity pebbles and blueberry muffins. This aroma is so strong you cannot detect anything else. The fruity pebble characteristic is not as strong in the taste but that is basically all that I am tasting. Very light malt and no hop presence. Moderate feel with semi-soft carbonation, finishes sweet yet a bit dry. Kind of a gimicky brew. Very fruity with tons of blueberry. Not something that I would seek out."
"Conclusion: Odd, fruity, sweet/tart...and tasty!"
"Serving type: bottle"
"I didn't try it with orange, as is often recommended with a wheat beer, but it's very good nevertheless. I may have found an alternative to Blue Moon and if you have this one available you might want to do the same. A good flavour, easy to drink, probably better in the summer."
" Drink: Not to bad only had one but i think after a couple i would get sick of the fruityness"
"Drinkability: This is a 5 in the summer after cutting the grass or hanging on the porch. A perfect beer for that time of year. I could relax and make this a session beer..since this tastes so summery, in the winter it is 3.0..not quite ready for the brightness of this beer and one seems about right if not too much. A 4 is an in between."
"This beer is the tops sitting on a lawn chair in your backyard on a hot summer day. Any other time, this beer will leave you unsatisfied."
"The color is a orangy gold with a nice thick white head. The smell was dominated by fruity accents and wheat. The taste was citrusy and spicy, too much fruit taste in my opinion. The mouthfeel was good with a nice smooth taste, but a little watery. I couldnt see myself drinking this alot."
"Pours a cloudy orange with a thin lacing white head. The aroma is overly spicy with coriander, ginger, and nutmeg as well as strong notes of wheat. The flavor is sweet and very wheaty and very spicy again coriander, ginger, and nutmeg are present, leading to a dry spicy and wheaty end. The body is thin. This beer could be very refreshing. I just can't get past the moldy celery flavor that comes from the coriander that they use."
"Overall; while the wheat and fruit flavors tend to mesh well here, the overall taste of this beer just doesn't click with me. Maybe I'm just not a fan of the noticeable blueberry flavor profile."
"I certainly would never have even thought to call it a ""white beer," though. It tastes like nothing else I've ever had before or want to have again. As one of the Alstrom bros said in his review, perhaps this is an ""American white," but I hope not. It's not a Belgian white. Belgian white's don't taste like Trix."
"good not great. won't be a rush to buy any time soon."
"Not a gourmet beer, but at the same time, insanely drinkable. Like eating a bag of Skittles at one time - in a good way."
"The drinkability was very good with a bit a sweetness to the aftertaste. Overall a very decent beer."
"Highly drinkable beer. Perfect for hot summer days. One of my favorite witbiers, and available at many places"
"Overall I think this is on the better side of American wheat."
"Overall a very good wheat beer, definitely different than the rest. It has a much sweeter flavor than most other wheats, I detect a hint of some berries, great mouth feel and drinks very well. I would say it is great for people who want a really good beer, but not into a rich hoppy flavor."
"Drinkability- Wouldn't have bought this, but appreciate my friends gesture. Won't be having this again, but it is beer, so I'll try anything once."
"one of my first reviews, a bit new to this, but bear with me..from the start it smell like blueberries, and fruity not sure from where.. sweet tasting , i would say its decent beer to drink, close to good but not quite there,. at least in my opinion..light and easy ti drink though.. so i would give it one thumb up"
"Poured into a pint glass very cloudy pale yellow color with a decent white head that is lasting for longer that I expected. Smells of sweet fruit blue berries to be more specific. Taste like blue berries and fruity pebbles, very sweeet tasting mouthfeel is fairly watery. This is a very drinkable beer. I will probably get this again."
"This brew has a nice nose, and an pretty good palette. Nice combination of flavors, good balance, no strong alcohol taste. Overall, nice quaff."
"Don't drink and review."
"I can see how some would like this brew, and a friend of mine really hyped it up before I tried it. I was disappointed, but you may like it, so give it a whirl. Everyone deserves a chance."
"This won't be one that I try again. This is more of a malt beverage than anything else, almost a soft drink."
"drinkability- very refreshing and drinkable brew."
"I rather enjoyed this, and just solidified my liking for Witbiers."
"D - I wouldn't have a ton of these, especially during the winter, but I can have a few of these during the summer."
"Taste There is wheat with malt citrus. Surprisingly the finish did come with a slight fruit loop finish. I didn't believe myself so I had my wife try, she, too said it had that finish too ."
"Poured hazy in a pale yellow color with quickly disappearing, soapy foam. The smell was sweet and fruity, like artificial orange and bubble gum, maybe apples and pears too. Quite distinct and different actually. Unfortunately it tasted like lemonade made from ""natural falvors"" and dishwater. In fact, it started to look like it too. I'm sorry to say that it was a disappointment."
"Another entry into Leinenkugels chick beer marketing scheme.It pours a cloudy slight orange with a somewhat fluffy head,Artificial all the way through nothing seems to be balanced at all here Way too fruity Most people say it tastes like fruity pebbles and I agree Virtually no balancing bitterness,Smells very similar to how it tastes. Just too fruity for me."
"a bit hoppy bitterness with a fruity feel. it has a wheaty complexion that mixes with the blueberry. average drinkability."
"Pours opaque gold with a nice head. And tastes like fruity pebbles. Grainy and highly carbonated. Too carbonated to enjoy actually."
"D- More drinkable than Blue Moon, but I wouldn't have a great amount of these in one sitting."
"Very fruity beer with an obvious aim to get a chunk of the success that Blue Moon has recieved in Wisconsin. Pours bright and cloudy with a white head.Delightful and tasty. Not going to change the world, but exactly what you are looking for as far as a spicy and fruity american take on belgium wheat ales. If you're looking for that."
"Color was that of lemonade with little head and very cloudy with bits floating in it. The smell of this beer was citrus but a little off to me. Sort of like lemon pledge. The taste was heavy on the citrus side, but more like lemons that have passed their prime by a week or two. Too much carbonation for my taste. The flavor comes across very light. I can see how many people like this beer for hot summer days, but I did not like it at all."
"Its a good beer based on the taste alone and i might buy a 6 for myself but it would not be a first choice/high priority on the shopping list. I think I'll have to try this again poured into a glass and given a true attempt at enjoying it. I'm sure it might change the characteristics just enough make it better for me. Or its wishful thinking on my part."
"Poured to a one fingered slightly offwhite head. Head disappeared pretty fast but left some bubbles around the glass and a little lacing. Brew was a lemonade color and very cloudy. Smelled of fake blueberries wheat and yeast. Tasted of artificial blueberries, yeast, wheat or grain. Also hints of citrus. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation was right. I bought this in a variety pack. It was ok. But I wouldnt buy a sixer of this beer."
"Terrific, one-of-a-kind fruity taste with a smell to match. Sweet up front but, in my opinion, very drinkable! I've heard this beer described by many as tasting like fruity pebbles and that's an accurate assessment. I believe, for a few dollars more, a case of this would be ideal to take to your next summer bbq instead of Coors or Miller Lite"
"Taste: Not much to the taste. More Fruity Pebbles and blueberries."
"Served in a pint glass at BW3s, I was very impressed with this brew. It poured a light yellow/orange color with a nice 2 finger head. An aroma of orange and spice was very apparent. I had them bring it with no orange slice so I could smell the beer instead of the decorations. The taste followed the smell very sweet with orange and spice being dominant. No bitterness whatsoever. I really liked this beer, great session beer, either alone or with food. Since it's being served about everywhere in the area its become one of my fall back beers when at places without alot of beer choices"
"The glass is empty now, sadly. I was genuinely surprised by this beer. I thought it was gonna suck hardcore. But while I enjoyed it, I really don't think it was representative of what a true wheat beer should be. The color was wrong, the taste was off, it was very unbalanced (like the Summer Shandy) and the consistency just didn't seem right. Luckily for Leinenkugel though, it tasted pretty damn good."
"I would recommend this summer beer to a friend."
"Notes: I think that it was successful in getting to the point of a nice fruitty wheat."
"Peculiar flavor destined to be both loved and hated. I had an interesting time with this beer, but didn't find myself loving it. I can see how this may appeal to many, as well as to atypical beer drinkers."
"D= Very high if your into fruit beers, I'm not however but it was definitely drinkable too many and I would worry about sugar belly. :("
"if you like sweet beers this one is drinkable"
"Overall an interesting drink. Refreshing enough and with plenty of taste. It's not something I plan to buy again soon, but I'll happily work on this six pack..."
"Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat pours a peachish orange that is slightly darker at the top blending into a lighter gradient towards the bottom of the glass. Smells are really pleasant and quite aromatic of an orange citrus like aroma. The taste is mellow with a bitter orange rind like aftertaste. Its not quite as bitter as a rind, but its by no means sweet. Mouthfeel is medium thick with a burning high carbonation. This isn't bad for a wheat beer, but its definitely not great. The orange twist was unique, but it didn't make it stand out as something above the rest. It wasn't bad, but unless I found myself in dire need of an orange like wheat this isn't something I'd look into picking up again."
"D: If this is your style this is a decent session brew. It went well with my ribs. The sweetness went well with the tangy ribs."
"D: I could drink several and enjoy. A solid Witbier."
"D-With the 4.6 abv I wouldn't chug a sixer but for a summer to fall sipper I really enjoyed the smoothness of this brew. Not everyday but I'd buy this again."
"The mouthfeel is light and refreshing and this one is an easy drinker."
"This is one of my favorite summer beers. Pours a hazy golden color with a citrusy and fruity aroma with a distinct blueberry and lemon note similar to Sweetwater's Blue. This one is hard to beat for a beer to take out on the boat, and girls love it too."
"No thank you. I will not have another."
"D - Quite drinkable and more flavorful than I expected as well. The yeast character is very nice, while the spices are restrained, but bold enough to do their job."
"D 4.0, I like this stuff, but prefer it out of bottle for a consistency's sake. If there is draft around, this may not be my top pick."
"This is a good beer for summer enjoyment. It is easy to drink and refreshing. It has a beautiful cloudy yellow color when poured into a glass. It has a strong citric smell and taste that I usually am not the biggest fan of but in this case it is not bad at all. All in all this is a refreshing drink great for summer days. I would drink it again."
"**Update...I had this again recently. It reminds me of corn flakes topped with blueberries. There is that cereal, I think Post makes it? Called Blueberry Morning. This is what it tastes like."
"Brew poured a cloudy light amber with a nice head initially. There is a lot of unfiltered yeast visable. Nose is light lemon grass. Taste is a pretty healthy dose of lemongrass and blueberry. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and decently carbonated. Overall drinkability is pretty good. It is a bit too sweet for my tastes and not overly complex yet not too bad overall as it is pretty refreshing."
"Poured from bottle to Pilsner glass a Cloudy honey golden color with two inches of head that settled to a half inch that remained with heavy lacing. Smells like a sweet lemony wheat bread, if such a thing existed. Taste was a mild wheat flavor with lemon citrus and some other sweetness, that I learned when typing this review was blueberry. Was a bit thinner than I expected almost watered down considering the nose. Had mild carbonation and was a nice summer treat. Very drinkable but leaves a bit of wanting in the finish and feel."
"This came out at a local grocery store out of nowhere so gave it a whirl. Pretty good I must say, pours a very cloudy golden color. Has a good amount of fruit taste to it, a lot more so than the average Wit, but I think it works well. I see some people thought it was overbearing but I didn't think so at all... a pretty solid beer right here."
"If I really want something in the same vein, I prefer the Hoegaarden Original White Ale at the time of this writing."
"D - Tastes more like a soda pop. Looks like a dirty beer not unfiltered. Orange tasting with no other quilities noticed. Not good."
"Future outlook: Come summer, I'm sure it'll work it's way into the lineup somewhere."
"Its my kind of beer to drink when it's just starting to get cool outside. It's very refreshing and something I would enjoy at a bar if the atmosphere is right."
"This summer brew is a cloudy golden color with a fair white fuzzy cap and a bit of sporadic lacing. The aroma is weak cereal wheat at best. The flavor hits you with a lemony sweetness on a cereal background. Midland feel for the style, good crisp carbonation and drinkable but not something I would want to drink much of given more gutsy options."
"D - this is okay. Easy to take down over and over. This is an interesting, very fruity take on a witbier."
"d - it's a little quirkier than Blue Moon, but it's entirely acceptable"
"Cloudy gold color witha white head. Head drops to a whispy cloud on top of the beer that dosen't have enough umph to leave any lacing. Smell is very fruity with some corriander spice. Fruityness kicks in big with the first taste. Almost berrylike but then it drifts to citrus and apricot. Spice hits on the back of the tongue. Very lively mouth with a light body. Just an average brew. No real flaws but nothing special at all."
"Fruity Pebbles, you know that Flintstones cereal. Well if Fruity Pebbles made a beer, this is it. That is pretty much the only way I can discribe it, it is one that you must taste for yourself. I am not usually a fan of fruity beer but this is just way out of left feild so I gave it an exception. Light in color and smells jsut like it tates, recomend getting it on tap."
"Drinkability - when out and about, it's my favorite 'trendy wit'."
"A drinkable beer. Fine to have a few on a summer afternoon. Nothing exceptional about this one."
"This beer was a hazy light amber color to me. You can clearly smell blueberries in it, which is normally a turnoff because it seems 90% of the time there is fruit in a beer, it's not done right. However, this one actually isn't too bad. Some people say that it tastes like fruity pebbles, but it has some decent balance. Drinking more than a few of these at one sitting could get a little old, but probably one of Leinie's better offerings. Not exactly what you would expect from your average wheat - more Belgianish, but it can hold its own."
"Pours yellow-ish, hazy, with thick white head. Good retention and lacing. Smell is a bit sweet, like sugar-sweet. Some fruit as well (lemon, pehaps some orange). Taste is mediocre. Its different than many wheat beers as the ""fruit"" essence seems to be on steriods. In fact, at some points drinking this it taste like Fruity Pebbles to me, yes...Fruity Pebbles the kids cereal. Mouthfeel is light and not as crisp as I'd expect. Overall not terrible but not a standout wheat beer, or witbier as its offically catagorized."
"Pours hazy honey with thin white film. Smells sweet and sour with almost candy-like nose. Tastes light and sweet, berries come to mind, with a crisp sweet finish. Not a heavy sweetness, but pleasant. Light bodied with fizzy mouthfeel. Overall, this is light and easy to drink but a little sweet and fizzy for me."
"Poured into a pint glass, and this hazy yellow liquid produced a one finger off-white head that did not linger long. The smell was of lemon, orange, and yeast undertones. Taste very much like the smell with the exception of the presents of the blueberry finish. Nice carbonation to clear the palate for the next sip on a hot afternoon. You could easily knock down a few of these before you knew it."
"Medium-bodied and virtually undrinkable.Had the barkeep pour me a Duck-Rabbit Milk Stout and I quickly felt much better."
"This was a beer I could have easily knocked back a few more of before calling it a night. It had a gentle sweetness, but not like the fruity beers that leave you a bit overwhelmed after just one. Each drink made you look forward to the next one."
"cloudy, apricot color. pleasant on the nose, off white head that fades medium fast. this was a very easy beer to drink. a little bubbly on the tounge. had an aftertaste that reminded me of eating fruity pebbles. decent beer. i wouldnt say that i would order it every time i was out but if presented with the need for a beer and this was on the list chances are i would drop five fifty on a pint."
"Although it's true that after being in the desert sun for any length of time almost anything can be refreshing, but chugging one of these is quite exceptional."
"One finger meringue colored head (off-white with yellow tint) faded after about two minutes to a thin ring. Did not lace well. The brew itself is a hazy lemon yellow with a delicious aroma. Blueberries, fresh oranges, wheat (it's like a cologne!). Flavors are equally pronounced and summery, sweet citruses of different kinds, wheat again, blueberries underneath the initial onslaught of flavor clean and crisp finish. Very flavorful! Lighter body with medium carbonation. A great beer for the price and very much a picnic beer."
"D= Average American wheat beer, a bit too sweet, but an ok hot weather chugger."
"D - Pretty nice on a hot day and I want a change from an IPA."
"Aroma was citrussy-sweet. Taste was similar, with a strong hint of berry. Mouthfeel was somewhat thin, with a nice amount of carbonation. Aftertaste was virtually nil. I could easily down a few of these, as they're quite refreshing. And being that the beer was free with the in-flight meal (all alcohol is free on Lufthansa-- fly German!), I was quite pleased with it, regardless."
"Good taste, could drink a couple of these. Like it."
"To pin point it, it tastes like you are drinking Fruity Pebbles."
"For me Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat Ale is delicious. I love the fruity aroma and taste. The cloudy appearance is what I'd expect from a wheat ale. It has a smooth feel in the mouth and reminds me of a friut juice. This beer has made my list of favorites. I will be providing this beer to guests at gatherings, I now know why it is called the pride of Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin."
"I find this beer to be rather unattractive in the glass. It has a cloudy amber color that tends toward the orangish end of the amber range. Almost no head. The smell is rather fruity and nice, as is the taste on the palate. This one has a robust carbonation that makes your mouth ""sparkle"". The finish is subtly hoppy -- more so than many witbiers. A nice beer for variety, but not the most drinkable."
"Happy with it, though it gets too sweet, and a bit doughy tasting as it warms. When you consider all the breweries out there half assing these different style brews, you'll definitely appreciate that Leinenkugel didn't hold back, and offered something truly unique."
"D - Nothing to really complain about short of strange mouthfeel. The flavor profiles are strong and I can't see having more then one or two of these, but this is a great slow sipper."
"I found this beer to be quite refreshing on a warm, summer day. Good while camping or when you need to grab something with some flavor to quench a thirst."
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer, and a great summer beer. I prefer this beer to others I have tried in the category, because I feel it is smoother all around."
"D: Ok...too sweet for my tastes, but now bad. The fruit overpowers. Not a bad beer, just not as good to me as some other wheats. If they would have layed off the fruit a little..."
"Bright golden yellow orange color with an extremely white head that leaves moderate lacing around the glass. Aroma is bursting with coriander and citrus hops, sweet and good. Crisp mouthfeel with a refreshing finish. The flavor is in direct relation to the wonderful aroma. Wheat based with a nice balance of citrus hops and spices. Overall this is an average witbier, nothing fancy or off the mark it is a decent representation for this style. This brewery continues to amaze me with quality beers and prices that can't be beat."
"Overall - Although I make every attempt to approach each brew with an open mind I'll admit that my appreciation for wheat beers has somewhat diminished these past few years and I've never been a big fan of fruity beers so going in Sunset Wheat may have had some hurdles to overcome. Despite any preconceptions I may or may not have had, this beer impressed me in some ways and left me wanting in others. The lack of head was disappointing however, the aroma was complex, sweet and intriguing but left me worried I was going to drink a wine cooler and not a beer. To my delight it was very crisp, very enjoyable and although a little too sweet the flavor had plenty going for it until the end. I know some people that would love this beer, but I would pass it up for many of the other witbiers out there."
"Not bad at all, though not stellar."
"Overall - Pretty darn good. I was pleasantly surprised."
"overall a ""different"" beer, drinkable but don't think that i would have more than one in a sitting."
"Pours a nice cloudy orange/golden yellow with a large foamy white head that leaves good lacing. The smell is pungent with lemon,other citrus,pepper,and wheat. The taste is light with lemon,orange zest,wheat and floral flavors. The m/f is light with the taste a little on the thin side. Not bad,but nothing exciting and more of an average beer."
"Highly drinkable. I'm not huge on wheat beers, but I like this. I didn't think I'd like blueberry in beer after trying Sweetwater Blue, but this has changed my mind. I will be buying this again during the summer months. Good for a refreshing brew after mowing the lawn, or for a bbq!! Not a complex brew, just a good, refreshing well balanced and good flavored brew."
"This is a good little beer that I will drink again."
"Had on a Delta airplane recently. Pours a pale murky yellow with minimal head, as typical for wheat beers. Smell is relatively earthy with a good amount of spice in the nose. Taste is overly fruity. This beer actually tastes like froot loops, and not a whole lot else unfortunately. The fruit taste is overpowering. The moderate carbonation makes this beer relatively drinkable but I wouldn't seek this one out."
"Drinkability: Too sweet and fruity, without enough complexity; almost tastes like liquid juicy fruit gum"
"Great beer for summer!!"
"A very drinkable brew. Nice choice on a warm summer day. I'd have it again."
"Despite hearing lots of good things about Leinies wheat beers, I was underwhelmed by this thing. Other reviews seem to describe a beer I'd really like, but my bottle was not particularly enticing. Maybe I'll have to try it from the tap sometime to see if I got a bad batch."
"Some hefe fans might think it is too thin or fruity, but I think it has mastered a style of its own. It doesn't have any banana/clove flavors, which is a nice break from other wheats/hefes."
"Served a nice hazy pale yellow with a decent head that lasted as a thin layer. Aroma was nice corriander spice and a hint of clove. the taste was a bit on the sour side; sour fruits overpowering any sweet malts. The beer is light with low carbonation, but the sourness gets in the way. This is somewhat enjoyable, but not likely one I'd have again."
"D - EZ going down. I am not a big fan of drinking in the sun. This beer I can handle in the heat though."
"Drinkability is good. This usually isn't my thing but I went and picked up a 6'er right after and I've been enjoying this quite a bit."
"This is a great beer to change things up. Pour one of these on a nice summer day and you won't be dissapointed."
"Bottle- Hazy yellow pour unleashes a standard frothy white cap with just some lace. The aroma is strange. It is quite perfumey and reminds me of fake blueberry candy. It also has some citrus and a bit of coriander, but the berry aroma is overwhelming. Tastes much like the aroma. Fake berry candy sweetness is powerful, with some orange and floral spiciness, and not nearly enough bitterness to mellow out the blast of berry essence. Sweet, sugary, this one was a chore to drink. Thanks to my mom for the bottle."
"D'ability - Level of spice cuts down on drinkability a bit, but better than Blue Moon and some other examples. I've definitely pounded my bottle while writing this review."
"Could not drink more than one of these, way too sweet."
"Very easy to drink. This beer tasted pretty good at first but the finish was too much like selter water."
"Overpowering orange. Orange. Orange. Orange. Just an all out nasty orange assault on your senses. Only way I'll drink this beer is if it is all someone is offering and I don't wish to insult them. The orange is just way too strong and dominating. I can't believe that I see this stuff for sale everywhere I go. I'm totally baffled how anyone can drink more than one at a time. Avoid this unless you really like over the top orange/citrus type beverages."
"D - This stuff is so damn sweet that it's difficult to even make it through one. Initially it's excellent, but I couldn't sip this all night despite the light body."
"This was my gateway beer that opened my eyes to the plethora of delicious brews out there, so it will always hold a special place with me. I decided to have this again tonight and thought it should be my first review on this site. It pours a nice golden color with a fruity smell and a taste unlike any other beer I've had. It's citrusy and reminds me of Fruity Pebbles (which helped get me away from the usual macro lagers). This remains one of my go-to beers, but it is pretty sweet and thus I have trouble drinking more than 2 or 3 at a time. However, this is a great beer to give to a friend willing to try something new!"
"M/D- I could actually drink a few of these. It actually tastes good. Who doesn't like banana and nuts? But still it's almost like a fruit beer, it doesn't really fit a real style except you can tell it contains some wheat."
"An ok beer for sure, but not one that I will be rushing out to get again. The pour was nice with a good frothy white head and a nice cloudy golden color. The smell was a bit too sweet for me, it smelt like fresh blueberries with a hint of lime in there. The taste was ok with a bitter citrus flavor up front, followed by a pretty dry aftertaste of blueberries once again. The mouthfeel did not impress me either, it was too frothy. Anyways, try it if you are looking for something new, but there are many better witbier's our there for sure."
"Odd that a beer would smell good and taste even better but that's what I found with this brew from Leinenkugels -- a longtime favorite of mine (Original and Northwoods Ale my other favs from this brewery). I purchased a six pack of this brew on a recent visit to Roof Brothers in Paducah KY and of the three six packs I came away with (Anderson Valley Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout and Breckenridge Oatmeal Stout), I honestly liked this brew the best. Very Easy to Drink. In fact, I'm on my third after working the second shift on a Tuesday night and enjoy the third bottle as much as the first. I'd rank this brew right up with my other fav's, Bell's Hopslam and Two-Hearted Ale."
"Not too complex, but well made. Solid summer beer that may even entice the BMC crowd if it gets hot enough."
"Served on-tap in a pint glass. It arrived and was a hazy straw yellow with a light white head. It had a light aroma which was mainly of yeast. The taste was not bad at all, way better than I expected. It had a nice but not great wheat/yeast flavor. Carbonation was about right for the beer. It is not an overly complex beer, but definitely one that I could drink a few of at any setting."
"D: Definitely drinkable, the sweetness to the brew might get a bit old after a few but I can definitely see myself putting a few a these back during the summer."
" Over all this beer is a major disapointment. I was hot & thirsty. I was looking forward to"
"D - Not bad I guess. Odd flavour, and fairly refreshing, but not bad."
"mouthfeel is creamy from the heavy carbonation, bitter but smooth"
"D- I can easily see sitting down a drinking a six pack in a couple of hours. Perfect for sitting outside by a fire on a hot day."
"D: A decent session beer, good for the summer, worth a try, hopefully without the particle floaters."
"D - I can and have consumed a 12er in one sitting."
"Take some to the beach. Nice brew."
"D: Very drinkable warm weather beer for sippin' on the dock or beach or on the porch. Nice flavors are not too boring after a while either. Good balance to this one."
"This brewski pours a cloudy golden color and has a fizzy tan head. The nose has citrus fruits, wheat malt and some spice. The taste is a little lighter with mostly wheat. Average body with heavy carbonation. This is one of Leinenkugel's best beers and goes down well."
"Ahhh Leinie's...something about this seems to just epitomize summer in the woods of the upper midwest. On tap it poured frothy, with a nice lacey white head. It dissipates into a clingy whispyness. It smells of grain, coriander, and fruits like lemon, lime, and a bit of orange. The taste is exceptional, and it borders on tasting like Fruity Pebbles cereal, if you can believe it! It has an extremely smooth mouthfeel, with just the right amount of carbonation. If I had a kegerator, this would be a mainstay."
"This beer may not always get a good rap with drinkers who are not expecting the ""fruity pebble"" experience but I found it enjoyable for what it is. First of all this beer accomplishes some good things in the witbier category and does not come through fully in other parts. The appearence does not offer much more than a 1 finger white head that does not last long and leaves little lacing. The smell fills your nose with spice and citrus with the smell of blueberries in the finish. There is still a hint of sweet wheat in this at the core. When tasting a spicey start greets you followed by a sweet citrus and hints of blueberry that trail off into a tart wheat finish. All throughout this beer has a crisp heavy carbonation that somehow still retains a smooth creamy finish. A low alcohol% and crisp/refreshing and smooth experience are enough to draw away from its sweetness that extends more than a traditional wit. Overall I really enjoy this beer."
"D: Not for me. Was not expecting a fruity beer and then I got slapped in the face with one. Not impressed and won't drink again."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. The color is golden with a twinge of orange, and is cloudy. The head is a nice soapy white lace, which lasts. The nose is very unique, very fruity and sweet. It reminds me of fruity pebbles. Then ever so faint malt and wheat character in the background. The taste is well balanced and is sweet and fruity, but maintains its beer characteristics. It has a light to medium bodied mouthfeel and is very drinkable."
"D: Not my favorite by any stretch. Although the draft of this brew is hands down better, it does not make it that much better. Maybe B- for draft"
"WOW! What a failure for a wheat beer. Blueberry? Come on, who ever tasted a wheat beer that tastes like blueberries? Maybe banana, cloves, and phenols, but not blueberry. I know there are lots of people who like this beer, however, being a wheat beer lover, I can not see this as a brewer's success story. Maybe the Leinenkugel brew masters made sunset wheat overly sweet to attract women who don't like beer's hoppy characteristics. So although this beer wasn't repulsive, I definately would not buy a sixer of it ever again."
"Mouthfeel is overcarbonated but clean. Not much body here. Easy to drink, refreshing, but boring."
"It is a nice light bodied beer with some citrus notes. Very refreshing and pretty smooth."
"D: Overall a bland wheat, monotone spicing and lackluster drinking factor."
"Definitely a favorite among the people I sampled this beer with."
"Drinkability is good. I could swill a lot of these in the summertime without getting bored with it."
"The taste is basically the same, but less complex, being lmoast entirely citrus oil. It's tangy and lightly sweet with a faint tartness. I's basically drinkable and not nasy, but it is tiresome."
"D - To style, this is a very drinkable beer that could translate well for a larger audience. Very drinkable summer style beer that would be refreshing in a variety of situations."
"D- Incredibly refreshing. I remember my first experience with this beer, I loved it. I couldn't put my finger on the fruit at first. I later heard someone refer to it as dryhopping fruity pebbles. That ruined my image of this beer, though I'm sure it was meant to be more of a blueberry taste than of fruity pebbles. If you like more fruit tasting beers give this a try or any other Leinenkugel offering."
"D - All around a pretty good beer. I could definitely drink a couple of these in a night, but would prefer to probably stick to one. It makes an excellent warm-weather beer that I could easily sip on the front porch with some buddies."
"This beer is just good. It smells and tastes like Fruity Pebbles. I agree with the VaTech reviewer about the fruitiness of this beer. It is very refreshing. appearance isn't the greatest and not much of a head, but I can drink these all day long. Yummy. I've never had a sunset wheat that tastes like this. Recommended if you are in the mood for something different."
"pours a cloudy yellow with a short white head that settled quickly and some very spotty lace. strong orange with a smaller amount of lemon and lime in the nose. taste is same giving it a slightly odd flavor. mouthfeel and carbonation were good. not a beer i would go and look for."
"Flat and thin mouthfeel. Let's hope the sun permanently sets on this one."
"Really not so bad. Better than a whole heck of a lot of American Wheat beers, simply by attempting to have the spice of their German counterparts. Though I didn't rate it so high in many areas, it was pretty drinkable and gone without any grimacing."
"THE FRUIT LOOPS OF BEER!!! I love this stuff, nothing else out there tastes anything like it. It doesn't have the best head but you'll forget that as soon as it hits your tongue. The menagerie of fruits and beer blends perfectly into a concoction unlike any other. Definitely a warm weather beer and a definite conversation starter anywhere you go. If you ever see it, buy it!"
"I think I found my 2008 summer ""lawnmower"" beer."
"The taste is pleasant, introducing some wheat tones with the characteristic yeast and spice contents. For the price, it's a decent example of the style. A bit watery, though."
"It has a nice, clean fruity aroma as well as taste. It almost reminds me of Fruity Pebbles, which can be satisfying, but a little disturbing."
"It really doesn't taste like a beer, which I suppose could be good, but I'm still really, really wavering on this one. I don't suppose I'll be buying this again anytime soon, but I could see myself drinking it once in a while. All in all, a slightly above average beer. . .but only in small doses."
"D: Easy to have more than one, but, might be too sweet for a session beer for me. I will buy again."
""
"D- Very easy to drink. Can easliy put these down. Don't really care for the orange slice they put in my glass. Put overall nice and easy a good fun brew. I really enjoyed this one different but also very good and nice."
"A light, golden color with some cloudiness with minimal head and some lacing down the glass. A tart citrus smell mixed with lighter fruits like berry and even a hint of tropical fruits. The taste is similiar to the smell with the yeast/wheat making for a pale but enjoyable and smooth brew. There is minimal spicing in this beer, which complemented it. A nice beer to have on tap, but for the witbier/wheat beer drinker there are better offerings."
"The beer pours a cloudy dark yellow with a fluffy cap of foam that left a small amount of lacing down the glass. Strong berries, anise and grapefruit were a surprise in the aroma. The flavor is somewhat similar with sweet berries and tangy lemon, the wheat influence is also noticeable. The beer is light on the palate and slightly carbonated. The fruitiness of the beer was a bit more than I expected, it is almost reminiscent of fruity candy."
"M/D: I will finish this six pack off and probably will not buy this one again. It has average mouthfeel considering it is suppose to be a sour beer like a lambic but could be improved upon."
"I am a fan of the Leinenkugel line but man I was a bit dissapointed when I tried this one. It was a cloudy orange color with a decent head and smelled extremly citrusy but in a fake way. The whole flavor was too artificial for me. Wont be buying this one again."
"Every beer has its place. This one is in special circumstances-- but definitely not for casual everyday drinking, I think I would puke, amd my wife feels the same."
"Orange wheat colored body is very hazy and dense. Head is a very light tan that comes to about two fingers. A bit of scattered lace is left as it fades. Nose has intense notes of fresh opened orange with a bit of spicey zest laced in. Enters the mouth very creamy and quickly brings to mind orange cream. Wheat feel is very faint. Twords the back of the palate as the beer leaves the tongue you get a hint of citrus based cleaner. Mouthfeel is short and fuzzy but mostly clean. kind of comes off as a beer the wife would like to me but it is really nicely drinkable and a decent summer brew."
"D: Didn't expect so much fruitiness, but was pleasantly surprised. Spring training, South Florida in the sun, bring some Sunset Wheat."
"While this is one of Lienenkugel's better summertime offerings, this beer really isn't anything special to write home about."
"I would still encourage someone to try this beer just for the sake of trying different beers."
"Maybe, just maybe in the middle of a hot hot day it might be refreshing.. maybe."
"What is this exactly? I really want to like it, but I see it as a mediocre beer with high refreshment potential. Fruity Pebbles and blueberry are the most prevailing flavors with a rush of carbonation. I wonder how this would pair with a plate of blueberry pancakes."
"Overall, this is a neat find. I like it! :-)"
"D - I like this beer for the most part. I would most definitely drink another one in the future."
"a friend of mine suggested I should try this beer. to my surprise it was a very flavorful beer with a golden color and fruity spin. as one of my friends dubbed it the ""fruit loop"" beer. and i think she is quite right. although not overly fruity as some i have tried, this is a nice blend of beer with a citrus twist."
"D - Great beer with a really good clean finish."
"UDecent body with a slight fizz on the tongue, but uggh! It tastes sour/bitter. It smells like orange, but tastes like grapefruit. This bitterness is not like a hoppy bitterness. It took a whole glass for me to realize that it was grapefruit. It tastes like orange pith (the white under the rind). Yuck..."
"Pours a cloudy, hazy orange with a 1/2 inch foamy white head. Not much lacing on the glass. The smell is really something--fruity, peachy, sweet, & sugary. The taste is very light bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Sweet & fruity. This is a great session beer. Very light & very tasty. Not sour or TOO sweet like some witbiers."
"Hazy grapefruit juice colored pour on draft with no head. Smell is like a cross of fruity pebbles, orange slice candy, and sweet tarts, yet somehow I like it. Taste is a mild, blandish fruity, candy like, with a big orange flavor and a light wheaty taste in the finish. Definitely unique, and somehow I like it, against my better judgement"
"Overall: Avoid. If you're tempted, go for a Blue Moon instead. It's better in every way (which isn't saying much)"
"Guess I'm in the minority but what can I say? Sometimes I'm in the mood for this kind of beer and this one fits the bill."
"Citrus is one word that pops into my mind when I think of this beer. The smell is of citrus, as is the taste. In addition to citrus, wheet is also detectable in taste. Golden in color with a decent head. The mouthfeel is quite crisp like and clean similar to a cider. It is a fairly drinkable beer."
"I'll give it props for having a clear time and audience in mind. My friend who doesn't drink to much beer was nicely surprised, and my girl was also, so it's more for that crowd. But, I'd through it back with a bucket of Hocus Pocus too."
"I was very surprised by the flavor of this beer. I guess my first sign should have been the orange slice on the tap handle. The beer was far too sweet for my tastes, and failed to satisfy as a wheat beer."
"Sorry Leiny...I normally love your beers; but someone screwed up o this one."
"Overall i like the beer just not the fruity raste."
"This beer was on fire special at a new establishment that I have found in Charlotte, so I decided to try one. Served in a pint glass, it is a pale yellow orange color with very little head once it came to the table. On first sniff orange peel is very previlant. Personally, I loved it. Taste also follows that of the smell with a strong orange flavor. The aftertaste does linger for a little while, but I wouldn't say that is a bad thing. It's definitely a beer that I'll enjoy on a regular basis."
"Drinkability: About average. I can see drinking this with my mother (who needs fruitiness to enjoy beer) or on a really hot summer's evening. It could also go well with selected foods (particularly something with lemon in it to help reduce the abrasiveness of the scent), but I'd have a hard time drinking it over the course of an evening or drinking more than one at a ballgame."
"I'm not a fan of American wheat beers as a rule and they tried to do a Belgian wit here but missed the mark."
"Very pleasant American wheat ale offering. This would be the ticket on a nice summer evening, perhaps with some minor league baseball. It is a knockout with a spinach, orange, and nut salad -- not too heavy, but enough going on to keep it interesting. Pleasant and fun, not a beer to insult anyone."
"Very refreshing, great ""anytime"" beer. Has a faint citrus taste and of course a hint of blueberry flavor. Most of my female friends really enjoy this beer. Although one of my girlfriends claims it tastes like fruity pebbles. I have a deep love for witbier and this is a tasty, fairly inexpensive 6 pack."
"Drinkability is not bad. This may be the part that keeps the review a little lower in score. The intangibles are what makes great beer great. This is an easy one to get and much better than the macros."
"Very orange red in color and smells of orange. Very light hefe taste, strong in orange flavor. Ive found that after drinking other beers its a nice finish beer. It seems to compliment the other beer flavors as a last beer of the night. As a stand alone beer, its a bit ordinary....well as ordinary as an organgeish tasting beer can be. I like the orangeish color and love that it pours with almost no head. Foam just gets in the way for me."
"Pours a light, bright orange. Fresh-sliced orange essence with subtle hints of honey and spices. Crisp, clean and smooth, with that orange zest sticking around from start to finish, almost with too much candy sweetness. This is definitely an ""experience"" beer, not a regular drinker. Tastes great with an orange wedge."
"D: I've tried this beer a few times now, from different cases and never really understood the appeal. Granted I'm usually skeptical of fruity beers but all this reminds me of is a carbonated blueberry soda, it's hard to remind myself I'm drinking a beer. I've heard from some friends that it's better and different on tap, but I've never had the opportunity. Over the summer, it can be a refreshing beverage, but drinking this now, it's a beer I'll end up pouring out."
"Bottle update: Much better than on-tap. It had a much stronger flavor, although it was a little over the top as far as citrus went. Still, much better, more flavorful, better head."
"Hazy light golden color with dirty white head. Sugary lemon aroma that leads to the flavor of a cheap ""yellow"" lollipop that bank tellers would give me as a kid when my mom went through the bank drive-through window. The balance is a bit off with this artificially sweet lemon flavor, but there were some detectable notes of tart wheat. It didn't taste bad, but I could not finish it, because I just couldn't take the flavor seriously while simultaneously thinking, ""this is beer."" This seems like an attempt to woo otherwise inexperienced beer drinkers into the mirror-world of ""craft"" beer."
"This one just smelled like summer, very refreshing and crisp with plenty of lemons and oranges and maybe a lime or two. It has a medium golden hazy body with plenty of carbonation and a foamy thick head that lingers for a while along with some mild lacing. Its smooth but has a strong bitter orange peel flavor through out and is a little dry with not much body. The aftertaste is a bit difficult to figure out but it certainly goes with the flavor of the beer. This isnt a bad beer just too bitter and dry for my taste."
"This beer smells interesting and has some interesting nuances to its flavor, but overall I don't agree with it. It apparently has coriander in it, which seems like a poor decision to me. I don't know if that is the problem, but I can't stomach this beer. It actually has made my stomach upset and I think I'm going to have to give away the rest of my six pack."
"smell heavily of artificially-flavored soda. orange and nectarine and the like. it doesn't smell bad, just unlike what i typically want my beers to smell like. oh gross, and it doesn't taste any better. that's shite...and down the drain it goes"
"D- Very light, not filling, drinkable beer."
"Had I taken the extra 30-second to read the packaging where it says ""Natural Flavors"" I would have left this beer in the store because such a vague tag rarely implies something good. It seems a lot of reviewers had no problem and enjoyed the vague berry taste. Maybe I got a bad six-pack because the smell/taste is so overpowering. I've tried this beer over two different sessions hoping that the second time around, being prepared for the smell/taste I'd be able to enjoy the beer and think of the fruitiness as secondary to it. I was wrong, but on the up side I was able to get over the shock and find that without the additional flavors I could see myself returning to this as a very drinkable go-to wheat. However, just the thought of drinking the two I have left from my six-pack makes my stomach turn. If you like extract boosted fruit beers and wheat beers maybe this one is for you. If you aren't into the fruity, then steer clear."
"Now I think other wheat beers such as Bell's Oberon and German Hefeweizens create fruity taste without the help of added ingredients. I don't know what Leinenkugel's does to get that great fruit taste but it tastes very good. So what if they cheat, I guess. They'll get a good score from me regardless."
"My wife said she didn't like the flavor but ended up drinking quite a few anyway. That tells me that it is quite drinkable. Much better summer offering than November when I drank it."
"Drinkability: Decent drinkability, the feel of the beer makes it easy to drink. However, being a spiced beer you always have that potential of having just too much flavor. I'd really have to see how the drinkableness is on the second glass. But the first glass should be quite drinkable."
"Pours a nice golden amber color from the bottle with a medium white head that fades fairly quickly. The aroma is nice with hints of blueberry and banana under a thick wheat malty smell. The taste is just the same, which is something I like about this beer. It tastes exactly as it smells. Hints of banana and blueberry underneath a rich wheat malty flavor. The aftertaste is sweet and hoppy which is a nice finish. It has a great mouthfeel and is a very drinkable beer, just not too many of them."
"Pours cloudy, has a slight zesty yeasty smell. It's pleasantly sweet, and the kind of sweet that comes from the yeast they are using (it's not unbalanced or anything like that). I can not get enough of this beer. Not too heavy or hoppy, this is a good gateway beer for friends that stick to MSBs like Bud Lite, etc. could get into."
"A nice flavorful offering from Leinenkugel, Sunset Wheat is a good treat to enjoy to beat the summer heat, or kick back with a hearty Fall meal. I most recently had one on tap today with a good batch of chicken wings, and it complemented the wings well. The pale wheat has a golden-orange color and a foamy white head. The citrus aroma is joined well in its taste, with orange and a hint of lemon coming forth as I drank it. The carbonation is a little high for me, but the flavor is solid, and the beer is easy to consume. I've had several while watching baseball games in the summer, and it goes well with wings (which I've done twice). Worth a try, and one of the best that Leinenkugel brews."
"What an awesome beer! Just recently tried this one for the first time, and was immediately hooked! Although taste is subjective, this really does taste like fruit loops - no joke! It has such a distinct flavor and smell that after buying a sixer, I ran back to the liquor store the next day to grab another one... A terrific example of a truly unique witbier... I could drink this all day - it's that drinkable, with a nice cloudy-yellowish appearance that perfectly complements it's sweet, bubble-gum, aromatic flavor... Definitely try this one... don't think you'll be dissapointed... This is without a doubt one of my favorites.... got this for only $6.99 for a six-pack, which is relatively inexpensive compared to some other more well known samples out there... Certainly one of my all-time favorites!"
"D - This is very drinkable I could drink this all night"
"D - It's harder to get through the warmer it gets, I don't think I could do more than one. An interesting idea overall, and possibly great for someone who enjoys Blue Moon, but this was not for me."
"The beer leaps from the 12-ounce bottle a fuzzy lemon yellow with a portly creamy white head that lingers long, finally, the lace gets to put on its show with a nice coating to surround the glass. Nose has a nice fresh wheat bread aroma, sweet with a citrus like crispness, a touch of orange peel, with a lemon twist. Start has a mild wheat presence; a trace of bitterness at the back, top is light to middling in feel. Finish has steady acidity with the mild hops adding a bit of twang, somewhat sweet and certainly dry aftertaste finishes the beer, a nice refreshing brew tis' true."
"I could do this review in two words, but that's not very descriptive. Okay let's just call it ""fruity pebbles"" yep that's what I got that vibe the whole time I drank this beer from aroma to all the flavors flowing. Appears a unfiltered pale golden hazy peach hue large bright white head chunky textured rises well above the rim of my glass, lace is sporadic and uneven but it's clinging. Aroma has citrus rolling lemonade accents with a mild chalky atrificial berry swetness with the mixture of grain and artificial flavoring I get fruity pebbles. Flavor chalky creamy citrus with mild herbal tones and blueberry extract sweetness coming in again with that signature fruity pebbles vibe, dry powdered cream finish. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied with a creamy spritzy carbonation flowing, wow that's a strange texture but goes down. Drinkability is decent not a whole sixer but one or two really get you in the mood for a bowl of Fruity Pebbles, yabba dabba belch."
"D - This really depends on your preferences. While I do like this beer quite a bit, the dominating fruit flavors do make it one that I tend to only be able to have 2 of in a session at the most."
"D- as far as witbiers go, this is good, but it lacks that traditional feeling, it seems so macro with its artificial flavorings i just can't dig it. but it drinks like pop and if you're thirsty this will definitely do it for ya."
"I will have to say this is one of my favorite beers. It pours a beautiful hazy typical witbier color. The smell of this beer is the most unique i've come across. Some say artificial or fruity pebbles, i just say damn good and fruity. Taste is more of the same with a musty yeastiness and lemon and orange, tasty! Overall this has to be one of the most drinkable, quaffable, thirst-quenching and AFFORDABLE beers around. A great stab at the style and a classic in the making!! At 5.99 a sixer, there is no going wrong here! Outstanding!"
"This is a great beer. Picked up one from ABC amongst a handful of others. Pours very nicely with a decent lace and nice head, had the classic witbier cloudiness. Smells very wheaty and fruity, specifically blueberry and lemon. Tastes very similar to how it smells, very fruity. Decent mouthfeel, and very drinkable."
"Just gross and i will never touch it again. I'm gettin the shakes just thinking about my experience with this beer."
"I had this beer while on National Guard duty in Wisconsin on the recommendation from the barkeep. When it came with a slice of orange I was a little on the iffy side but I was pleasantly surprised. Has the smell of Fruity Pebbles. Goes down very smooth. If you're a fan of wheat beers then you have to give this one a shot."
"The taste was of a bitter/sweet nature, with a hint of citrus, wheat, yeast and pastry. This is a really different wheat beer. It's so different, that I kind of like it. I felt that I was drinking a liquid donut! Wow, is that different or is that different. Donuts?"
"On tap at On Tap Pub. The beer is a hazy light amber/orange color with a thin off-white head. Minimal lacing throughout. The aroma is akin to Fruity Pebbles. Light-bodied and smooth with sweet fruit and spice flavors, along with a bit of wheat. The finish is sweet with a mild clove aftertaste. Not as sugary sweet as the aroma would lead you to believe but still just an average beer."
"Drinkability- Normally a beer of this nature would almost automatically score higher in this category. However, the boo-berry qualities really distract and annoy my palate. I don't really agree with listing this as a witbier. Although there are some certain similarities in taste, this seems inbetween styles, but closer to an american wheat... just not a very good one. Was looking forward to this one after reading about it in Yankee Brew news, but ended up dissappointed."
"-Oelergud"
"drinkability is decent. this brew will be loved by fans of citrus and coriander flavors, but for little else. balance is biased heavily to the sweet side, but no malts are present. everything in moderation Leinie's, everything in moderation."
"D- Definitely unique taste, can drink many of these because they are so smooth on the way down."
"This particular beer had a very smooth silky texture to it. The taste had some what of a blueberry flavor with just a hint of orange. I have to admit, I really didn't examine the color to much. This beer reminds me of summer time. Overall it is a very mellow beer to enjoy."
"Go Phillies!"
"Pours a very cloudy yellow that includes a slight touch of orange. Head was thin, but very dense and had good staying power and great lacing. Smell was mostly lemon with a bit of other citrus (orange, and a touch of lime?) too. The coriander spiceness comes in below the citrus. Flavor was a solid lemon-peppery combination with a bit of hops filling in after a few sips. Also noticed a pleasant dry/sharp wheat taste and crispness that fills in underneath the initial lemon-pepper. Nice creaminess too. I think this is my 2nd Witbier sample, and Im actually coming around to enjoying this style more than I thought I would. Im thinking this might be nice with Thai food."
"I enjoyed this beer for it's refreshing characteristics, a decent variation of the witbier style."
".Enjoyable ice cold. has a refreshingly citrus scent that is noticeable immediately. Citrus fruit flavoring readily obvious which seems to be why a slice of orange is placed in a glass of Blue Moon or Hoegarten. With Sunset Wheat, no orange slice is necessary. Somewhat filling but very drinkable. I like this one."
"Pale hazy gold color with lots of bubbles. Persistent white head caps the beer. Blueberry(from the coriander), orange and lemon nose smells just great. Very tasty sweet and tart flavors make this oh so refreshing. A wonderful summer or hot-weather brew. High drinkability due to it's excellent flavor. Easy to see why this beer's popularity took off around the country. Good, solid refresher. A cross-over beer for many macro drinkers I have found."
"A very good warm weather beer. Very fruity, strong coriander and citrus flavor with noticable blueberry. Very odd, most Wisconsin brews try to use more cheries, raspberries, and honey. I'm not a big fan of fruit wedges in beer, but this could take a slice of orange without distorting the flavor. The trick to this beer is to keep it cold, once it warms up the citrus flavor becomes a it strong. Still very enjoyable Summertime beer."
"I really like this beer. It can be consumed in a lot of different ways in a lot of different circumstances. A lot of people tell me it tastes like fruit loops, but I enjoy it. Great look and smooth, fruity taste. On a warm day, this is a great draft beer to grab."
"This is a very interesting brew...it seems like people either love it or hate it. Mark me down as a lover. Darker than most wheat, it has a rather weak head with little retention. Plenty of aroma, smells of strong blueberries and maybe sweet vanilla. I love the taste...I could drink this for dessert every day. Strong blueberry flavor, but not too strong, with a smooth after taste. The most drinkable beer for me yet. Finishes as good as it started. I highly recommend."
"starting backwards, it has such a nice finish, the after taste is delicious. From there Id say its rather sweet, reminds me of a sweet tart or perhaps tequza. However I must say there is a deepness to the levels of flavor. It really grows on a tongue. I can really taste the time they spent on the flavors. worth a try."
"Love or hate beer, you either enjoy sweet wheat beers or you do not, try it and figure it out for yourself"
"Quaffed a bottle of this while watching college football this past weekend. Poured an effervescent golden with a foamy, spongelike head. Aroma was of grains, sweet grains, yeast and a hint of blueberry. Taste was quite nice. Really enjoyed how you get the refreshing wheaty sweetness, maybe a glancing of hops, and then the blueberry note on the way down. Truly tasty and refreshing. Almost like blueberry pancakes or a sinful dessert. I could definitely go for another one of these. Worth a shot."
"Taste-Crisp and full with overlaying after tastes. When i saw it was Wisconson and originally family brew business, I was an instant fan."
"This was a pleasant surprise. Very fruity, but it a good way. Initial notes were citrus.. orange?.. but most of the way through it finally dawned on me - blueberry. Not just blueberry, but blueberry muffin. I could see how this could be a turnoff for some who aren't into the fruitiness, but I have to give Leinie's props for this one. It's something different."
"Very aromatic, has a sweet and fruity smell (due to coriander and blueberry). One of my friends described it as smelling like fruity pebbles cereal. Good head retention, got about 1.5 fingers of head after I poured mine into a tall weissen glass. Crisp and tasty, everything you'd want in a beer. Sunset wheat is easily my favorite American beer. If it were a woman I'd be popping the question right now, if it were a man I'd beg for a civil union. Leinenkugels is going to be huge thanks to this beauty. Its availability is shocking, for I used to live in Tomah, WI and knew about Leinies before I moved to Texas but I've found it ON TAP at local pubs here in Houston. Sunset wheat is possibly the best weissen brewed in the U.S."
"If you are into very fruity beers, this is for you. A sub par wheat beer. This is unfortunate because I generally like Leiny's beer. To bad this is the only offering I can find in Texas."
"My buddy brought me some of these...and I've never had 'em 'till now. Very ""different"" in the way of a ""beer," but very much a treat. Smells great, like citrus, and tastes much the same, along with the hint of corriander and a touch of fresh blueberrys! WOW! How unique this is. Color is pretty typical for a wheat. Cloudy, light orange/yellow. Very smooth and highly drinkable. Clean brew that again, doesn't have that ""beer"" flavor...but it's not supposed to I'm guessing. Nice summertime brew I think. I'd highly recommend this as something different to offer a guest or a buddy. Most people will like this! Saaalute my friends! Cheers too!"
"To sum up, this is one of the better American brews I've had. Pretty impressive considering German hefes are my mainstay beer."
"This beer has a taste that emphasizes fruit, with lemon and a touch of orange dominating. The flavor of coriander isnt too far behind, followed by wheat and other light herbs. There is only a faint taste of hops and the beer is sweet overall."
"D - Very quaffable and nicely spiced. Not the best wit ever, in fact it lacks some of the wit character, but worth trying. An interesting choice w/ the lager yeast. It does seem cleaner in the finish than a wit and not quite as creamy."
"A pleasant surprise. 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Hazy orange in appearance with a medium-size white head. Spicy citrus aroma. Orange and spice in the taste, tiny bit of malt. Maybe a little bland, but definitely a beer you could drink for a while."
"On-tap from a Friday's in Parsipanny, NJ waiting for rush hour to ebb. The hazy apricot body contrasted against the starkly cloudy grey outside. The nose was wheat with citrus, appropriately enough. At first sip, a surprisingly fruity sweetness belies the style. Emptying the glass, the base flavors are true -- coriander, lemon -- but there is a dominant sweet presence. The medium body is nice, and it goes down smooth, though lacking bitterness. It's refreshing, in the same way orange juice is, and I couldn't deal with a second pour."
"Drinkability- A refreshing all occasion beer."
"Had on tap at a beer tent at the recent music fest in Bethlehem, PA. Pours a cloudy amber-orange color producing a thin, small bubbled white head. Nose is fruity sweet with huge notes of orange juice, vanilla cream, crushed berries, perfume and ground wheat. Very different and unique aroma profile here for sure. Mouthfeel was smooth and refreshing but slightly thin and watery as you swallow. Taste very similar to the aromas but not as distractingly perfumey. Refreshingly sweet creamsicle, fresh squeezed orange juice, blueberry, heavy cream and some coriander and pepper come through. Finish is a bit thin and quick but a nice thirst quencher on a hot day."
"Wow. I picked this up randomly at a convenience store. Fortunately, it was fresh. Wonderful smell and taste. We took it out on the boat, but as the beer warmed the mouthfeel got a bit unpleasant. Otherwise, this is an incredible beer that really brings around a strong, sweet blueberry taste and smell; impressive for a micro shipped from wisconsin to new hampshire."
"D: Yuck. I passed this beer to a friend that likes fruity things."
"D - Overall I'm glad I gave this beer another shot as I didn't like it when it first came out. Now I'd say it's worth a try."
"Feels really good in the mouth,i would drink this beer again but is hard to find."
"Drinkability:Wonderful beer. Easy to fall in love with."
"This is a decent summer session brew if you like fruity, citrus brews."
"Pours a cludy burnt yellow with a thin head that quickly dissapates. Very fruity smell with an overubundance of citrus. This is fruity beer so if you aren't a fruity beer kind of person, this one isn't for you. Very smooth taste of orange peels transitioning to mild peach. Almost no hint of hops whatsoever. This is an excellent beer on hot days when the masses are drinking their bud light and miller lite. A good drinkability that has its place at the beach or on hot days."
"D: Pretty good at first when it's cold -- it's light in body and that fruity sweetness hasn't settled in yet. But I slow down near the end of the second glass due to the sweetness."
"I really liked this one. It poured a cloudy yellow color and the aroma was fruity. Very smooth pleasant taste that was citrusy. This is a nice summer beer on the South Mississippi Gulf Coast where the high yesterday was 98. Had this one again and I definitely tasted the fruity pebbles that others have described."
"Drinkability would be OK cause it's not that strong but the flavors aren't either."
"Sorry, but this beer is bad, but interesting. This is a cloudy, yellow beer and that's where it's wheat characteristics end. It smells like candy fruit and tastes like bubble gum. I can detect the orange, coriander, lemon, rind, and other citrus, but this just has imitation written all over it. It doesn't taste real, but rather like extract was added to it thus giving it its artificial bubble gum flavor. its a light bodied, decently carbonated beer. Its light, with a small mouthfeel and no real after taste. I've had a few sips and that's all for me."
"Drinkability- This is a great summertime beer. I loved the citrus taste that it had. I would recommend this beer to friends!"
"Hmm...A bit much berry flavor here but I do like it. I think after about three of these I would want something else."
"Aroma is malty with a wheaty undertone, and hints of orange. Color is warmly golden and somewhat cloudy. Flavor is rich, rather malty with strong orange tone, rather sweet but not cloying, just a whisper of smokiness. It has a nice thick feel that I do not often find in wheat beers, and leaves a pleasant and satisfying aftertaste. Better than what I expected!"
"Pours out a really murky peach with a thick, fluffy head that, once receded, leaves some drippy lacing. Smells of a wheat graininess with some blueberry, Lemonheads and Fruity Pebbles. Has an artificial smell to it. More beer characteristics come out in the flavor with some pale malts and wheat, but then gets pushed out by berry and Fruity Pebbles. Weird, but not really bad. Mouthfeel is light but a little gritty from the yeast and the carbonation is tingly and doesn't prick too hard. This is a bit weird for me to crave another. Good alternative to a soda, most definitely."
"D- Definitely a nice summer time, warm weather drink, enjoyed a couple at a friends on the 4th, fit the mood nicely...would drink again if someone offered to me, but probably wouldn't go out of the way to stock at my house...."
"This is the type of beer that a macro drinker would drink and say they are branching out to something more bold, but it isn't. Pours a hazy dark yellow, smelly quite floral and perfumy. Tastes a little les floral than the smell, a bit like citrus, but without much bite. Average mouthfeel. Overall it's a good summer beer but beyond that quite average, I would drink it again if offered, overall though it's a big so what."
"Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat was a pale yellow color and very cloudy. The head was white and had decent retention. The aroma was full of citrus with some spices. The taste was lemony with some spices towards the finish. The mouthfeel was crisp with a medium-light body and plenty of carbonation. Drinkability was average. It's a decent beer, but not one I will purchase again."
"What an interesting beer. This beer pours a deep golden color with a tight white head. Its aroma distinguishes this beer. Not sure if it is artificial or not, but I detect lemon, orange, and a little bit of blueberry. The taste goes along with the aroma. There is some sourness that suggest the citrus part of the beer is natural. It is quite a refreshing summer beer. It is very drinkable, however the aftertaste leaves something to be desired. There is a hollowness, followed by a metallic flavor. Not sure why that happens, but maybe they need to add some more bittering hops to balance it out better. Overall worth trying, but I suppose some will either really like or really dislike this one."
"Mouthfeel is crisp, body is okay but a little thin, even for a wheat. Interesting beer with a lot of flavors going on, perhaps not a personal favorite but a good summer choice."
"The feel is creamy and nice. None of the chewy orange juice feel of a hef, but all the fruity flavor. It's a unique beer; like a smooth, creamy hefeweizen. Has the taste of a hef and the feel of a witbier. Very solid selection."
"my last...."
"I'll make this short and sweet, pun intented. An orange soda pop, malt beverage with natural fruit flavors concoction. Something about the idea of a Hefe style beer with a light citrusy note and perhaps that characteristic ""bubble gum"" scent caused me to buy this. Boy was I ever dissapointed. My girlfriend didn't like it....she's the kind that'll put a lemon slice in a good hefe."
"The Sunset Wheat poured a hazy yellow. Some carbonation drifted up to a scant white cap. Nominal lacing. Smell is sweet lemon and grains. Taste is more sweet citrus over a nice malt hop blend. Maybe some pepper as well. Mouthfeel is crisp and dry. Very refreshing. One of my favorite beers to drink when it's real hot and sticky."
"D: I'm glad I only have one of this, and I may not even finish this one. My girl who likes fruity beers would probably like this. Definitely not for me though."
"This wasn't very drinkable, in spite of being a lightweight, because the orange got to be way to much. I also disagree with it being a witbier, although I didn't notice any blueberry either, so go figure..."
"Poured a golden yellow with a moderate white fizzy head that faded quickly with no lace. Smell was very sweet, lots of lemon and wheat hints in here. Wow, the taste, if I did not know better I would swear there was a lemon in the bottle. Smooth and light, but really sweet. I would not have put soo much lemon or corriander or whatever that herb is thats sweeting it, other than that, a very sessionable summer beer."
"Interesting...strange...I think the jury is still out on this one."
"Now hear me out. In accordance with the intentions of the site, I always try to be very constructive with my reviews. This case is no different. With that being said. This beer taste exactly like Post Fruity Pebbles. Several of my friends at the establishment we were patronizing agreed. Pure unadulterated Fruity Pebbles breakfast cereal. There may have been something weird going on with the keg, or there may be some sort of glitch in my brain. But: Grain, a bit of wheat, and so-help-me-God FRUITY PEBBLES!"
"Some stale socks aftertaste. This is bad a pint is almost too much. Wouldn't have two. Not sure what this would pair with either. won't have it again."
"M/D: very very dry, my mouth is still dry, im not sure why maybe it was just me. way too try for me and this style. decent medium to light body and relatively drinkable except after two i felt like my mouth was cotton"
"A frind who spent last summer in the midwest had been talking about this, so i had to pick it up. Poors a hazy straw with a big white head. Smells pretty fruity with some wheat mixed in for good measure. The taste also sticks with the fruit and wheat theme from the noze, and finishes very crisp and clean. This beer was exceptionaly good hanging outside with some friends, very smooth, something a non beer drinker would appreciate, but appreciated by me as well"
"I did not like it at all. Too much coriander, the citrus flavoring tasted artificial and left a real bad aftertaste. Reminded me of generic Froot Loops but not as good. After two bottles out of the six I gave up even attempting to see if the 3rd time was a charm. I'll usually always finish a six no matter how good or bad it is...Not in this case. I did not like it."
"Pours a cloudy, dirty gold color with virtually no head -- just a ring around the beer. Nothing too attractive. Aromas of lemon and a faint blueberry note that seems a bit unnatural to me (maybe it actually is all natural, I don't know, but it reminds me most of all of Booberry cereal). On the palate, this is way too sweet with a sugary cereal fruitiness, with only the barest of balancing wheat acidity and spiciness. The sweetness doesn't taste very honeylike -- it tastes refined. Mouthfeel is coating and a bit cloying -- not fresh and lively enough for the style. Overall, this is bad. Way too sweet, no freshness to balance it out. Use only as a safety beer, taken ice cold and from the bottle directly."
"Not a bad brew at all. Reminds me a little bit of a cross between the Sea Dog fruit beers and the New Belgium Skinny Dip. It's fruity, but with lime and spice mixed in."
"drinkability - Nice summer beer. Didn't know this was a Witbier till I bought it."
"Served slightly chilled in a pint glass from a twelve ounce bottle. Poured a hazy golden straw like color. About one good finger of thick, pillowy, bright white head formed. Head slowly faded into a thick white ring around the glass, and left a decent amount of sticky lace. Smell: A rather strong fruity aroma. Lots of citrus, orange, lemon, a touch of blueberry with a hint of wheat mostly hidden by all of the fruit. The taste was just as interesting. More orange, lemon zest, a little blueberry, with a lot more wheat than the nose had suggested. Mild carbonation. Quite out of balance. The fruit tones overwhelm the rest of the flavors. Thin and watery in the mouth, but very refreshing. Drinkability is pretty good."
"Cloudy and slightly orangish yellow on the pour. The reasonably-sized cap of foamy, off-white head lingers pretty well. The smell is pretty straightforward with a neutral, wheaty base complemented by a bit of spice and some sweet citrus. It's that citrus that dominates the taste, which is lemony from start to finish. The underlying grains can't hold their own, which mutes what might otherwise be some interesting complexity. The mouthfeel is more clingy than I expect in this style, which is perhaps why that lemony sweetness lingers for so long. Goes down well, but a lack of balance hurts this one."
"On tap, poured into a tall weizen glass. Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a small head that quickly diminishes. Big citrus, orange aromas. The flavor is much of the same. The flavor could almost be described as O.J. mixed with a very light pale ale. Very light, very refreshing, Very light hops. The mouthfeel is light and watery. It is what it is. An above average witbier. If you need a decent beer to cool off after a long, sundrenched day, this will do the trick."
"Overall, it's a tad above average. It's clearly not a Belgian, but it doesn't proclaim itself as one. Easy to drink, but there are better wheat choices I think - depending on how much you want to spend."
"The beer is a bit thin, but for the style, that's OK. And it allows this to be easily drinkable. A nice warm spring/summer drinker."
"Overall, I was quite impressed with this offering. It would be the perfect accompaniment to seafood on a hot summer day."
"I just had to alter the drinkability score on this but I'll let the other scores stand. Over an hour after drinking this beer I had a sort of medicinal sweet blueberry taste in my mouth, not pleasant and not leaving me with the desire to have another."
"Edit-I didnt realize this was made with blueberries. I guess that explains things, but it is still gross. The fruit tastes artificial just like a kid's breakfast cereal."
"Drinkability: I certainly wouldn't have picked up a 6-pack had I know it was going to be like this (more of a fruit beer than a hefe or wit), but I can see some people liking this, especially because of the weather."
"Reviewing this one from memory (earlier today). ASMTD aside. There's little warning to indicate what this beer is; namely a blueberry brew. When I picked it up, I was expecting a Hefe. Not too far off. It's a wit, but a very, very, very blueberry wit. An earlier reviewer likened it to fruity pebbles. Yes, it is that sweet. It tastes like blueberry extract. That being said - it's not all that bad. There's enough of the wheat to balance in the aftertaste to make this a reasonably drinkable beer. If you like blueberry beers, this is a better than average example of the style. Unfortunately, if you're like me, and you don't like them, be warned. Although it doesn't explicitly mention it on the label, this is one blueberry for the record books. On the other hand, if you are like me - this will probably be one of the blues you can stomach that ill-gotten six pack of."
"Overall: Well, it's definitely different, I'll give it that. The blueberries were a little too much for me, but I still found it enjoyable. This would definitely taste good late afternoon on a hot summer day. Worth a try for anyone who enjoys beer that's out of the ordinary, definitely worth it if you enjoy beer with fruit flavors. Basically, if you like Abita's purple haze, you'll probably like this."
"nice beer to have on a warm day. not sure i could do a session with this beer. i might have to be sitting in the direct sun to pull it off. stays very close to style. it is available year round according to the website. i see myself only drinking this beer in the hot midwest summers."
"Notes: A very smooth and interesting offering. After two of these babies though it got old in a hurry. Not session worthy in this household simply because it feels a bit infused and candied flavors start to get annoying. But for one and done its above average at least."
"D: Probably hard to drink very many because of the fizz and the overly sweet berry quality. I like the hops touch though."
"It has a cloudy, light honey color and a sandy white head that doesnt last to long and a strong citrus smell. There is too much carbonation. It drinks better than you would expect. There is a crisp orange taste on that familiar base of a wheat beer. It is best ice cold on a hot day."
"D - I still don't really like this, but it's far better on tap than in bottles."
"Drinkability: Good beer for the beach."
"Still, despite all that I found myself downing two fairly easily. This isn't the worst wheat beer out there, but it's not the best either. Seems like it's becoming more readily available, so give it a try."
"This makes a good session beer, even my wife liked it."
"To each their own but this beer wasn't for me. Too much citrustoo much sweet."
"It was a good beer, had a few since it was the special. I would give this a solid recommendation for someone who wants a light summer ale."
"Interesting hazy orange color and a thin head that seems to be retaining well so far. Very slight hop bitterness. Overly citrus but with just enough wheat character. Very refreshing summer brew. Good change of pace from the darker brews. I will probably buy another sixer of this one soon."
"I have this in my top 5 of current beers to drink."
"Very sweet smell in the bottle. Poured it into my trusty chalice. Great head. Color golden and opaque. Head has staying power. Taste is very different. Sweet like honey with hints of black licorice. Very creamy mouthfeel. A very sweet bitter finish. Laces nicely on the glass. Jake and family has done a good job brewing a good variety of beers since the old days of the original standby Leinie's."
"Overall drinkability of this good if you can get over the shocking abundance of fruit flavor."
"Notes: Not a witbier in my book, doesn't have the spice complexity. Just a nice, uncomplicated wheat ale and a solid sessioner on a hot day."
"This particular beer has a fruityness the likes of which I generally associate with a bin of Brach's. It reeks of marketing obscuring the brewer's art. I'll yield the point that it uses blueberries in unusual fashion, but it comes off like artificial berry flavor. All the same, I would call this a fruited American wheat beer...not a witbier by a long shot."
"12 oz. Bottle. Pours a cloudy orange/yellow with a thick creamy head and lacing. Intense blueberry aroma with some citrus notes. Big blueberry flavor with orange and bubble gum in the finish. I had heard about the blueberry flavor but didnt believe it until I tried it. Nice beer but a little too sweet for my taste."
"Poured into a standard pint glass. Appeared exactly like a hefe should be. Slightly cloudy, color was a nice golden hue. Head was non existent, but there was a little lacing that clung to the side. As many of my friends have described, it smells just like a loopy frooty cereal. Breathing in from the glass gives a similar taste in the mouth. The actual taste is lacking. Initially there is a blueberry type flavor, however that quickly disappears to basically nothing with wheat undertones. Felt ok in the mouth, but was a little thin. Very easy to drink, but nothing special about it beyond the frooty aroma and quick flavor."
"As a big fan of hefeweizen-style beer, I truly enjoyed this witbier from leinenkugel. The aroma is highly suggestive of fruit and as expected the taste reminds one of a fruit-flavored breakfast cereal. The head of this beer was practically non-existent, but the overall appearance is what one would expect of a hefeweizen. I really enjoy drinking this beer and believe it to be highly drinkable, especially for those whose taste is more inclined to sweet beers. Would make an exceptional desert beer or a nice complement for a seafood dinner (salmon, lobster, etc.)."
"I'm a big Leinenkugels fan. That being said, I ordered this beer with high expectations. I drank it out of the bottle, so I can't comment on the head or the color. But with the first drink, the only thing that I could taste was fruity pebbles... Not what I expected. I bit too sweet for my taste. Don't think I""ll be ordering this beer again."
"Avoid this beer. Get some Hoegaarden instean."
"They had this on tap during a family dinner at TGIFriday's. That it was there at all was a pleasant surprise, and drinking it was a breeze, at least on its own, but I have to tell you, that tendency to perfume was moderately bothersome. Not only that, the floral and fruit pieces make it less than a willing accompaniment to most strongly flavored meal choices. In fact, it got utterly lost against my Cobb salad and did nothing more then wet my whistle. Still, were I to find myself in the hot sun and this was in my hand, I'd be fine with it. As long as it was the best choice, at least."
"Not terrible, but I got tired of it quickly."
"M&D - smooth and light bodied, with a great easy down-ness, i am so surprised i will buy this more and more and more, not just as a BA enjoying and respecting a great beer, but when i have company over, or when its hot out and im sitting on the porch waiting for a thunderstorm to roll in, this is great."
"Note: I've found this in bottle form and it does have more carbonation than the tap version."
"Drinkability - Average. Delicious. A little filling. I can't session this beer, but it was a wonderful treat. Very enjoyable."
"D: Much better flavor than Blue Moon, but it takes a way back seat (ie, the very back of the station wagon) to Hoegaarden. This is a nice brew for a summer afternoona nice change of pace from the IPAs."
"DA: Take it easy on the lemmon/lime wedge effect and this one might be pretty drinkable."
"Overall, good but probably wont buy again. I'd spend the extra to get that cleaner taste."
"edit: i guess if I had read the BA notes, I would have known it WAS friggin blueberries."
"Surprisingly smooth and sweet, this would make for an excellent indoctrination to the world of beer for non-beer drinkers (read: girls) but is still more than enjoyable for more seasoned drinkers."
"Decent mouthfeel minus the sticky cloyingness. I could probably polish off a sixer of this with no problem. Perfect summer time beer, as are most wheaties. I say this one shall be in my fridge again in the future."
"d: not a every day drinker but a nice change"
"Silly Rabbit, Leinenkugels is for kids! Pours a nice hazy orange. Quick fading head. Smell reminds me of fresh blueberry puree. This is a bit too sweet to have more than one. Like drinking the milk after a good bowl of fruity cereal. Lingering berry aftertaste. Enjoyable and fun though. Overall an interesting beer worth trying."
"My wife drinks this stuff like water. It is just too sweet for me. Fruity Pebbles was the correct flavor, we've checked the two together. It isn't bad for a summer, lawnmower, beer, but it could be a little too sweet for some."
"D: Has a good drinkability level due to its flavor composition and watery feel, would do well for a cookout. Being the first truly hot/warm day here for the season, this beer is a good way to kick off the late spring/summer months, but may not hold up in the face of other witbiers."
"Decent body and carbonation. This isn't bad, but it is a bit too sweet, and the fruit flavors don't seem natural. They don't seem blended in, rather they compete with the base of the beer. Still, worth a shot, particularly in the hot weather."
"Overall, I have to say this is in my top five for best witbiers. Highly enjoyable, and very sessionable."
"Comments: Honestly, I didn't mind this as a beverage, but I don't think I could consider it beer, per se. Tasty, fruity & flavorful, albeit a bit fake tasting, but possesses no qualities you'd expect from beer."
"Not impressed with this beer at all."
"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, to be honest I didn’t like it at all and would not drink it again, however, if you like Blue Moon, you’d probably like this beer as well. I was sad to see that this beer had replaced the Newport Storm of the Season tap at The Abbey and mentioned as much to the bartender for it whatever it may have been worth."
"Quite different. This could make it a bit challenging....but worth the challenge!"
""
"I really liked this one, apparently more than pretty much everyone else. Pours your standard foggy light yellow witbier color, lots of white foam on top. Smell is lots of orange (and I didn't even have any in there). Taste is almost overwhelmingly a sweet version of orange peel, but still delicious. Not a lot else going on, but it's strangely tasty. Feel is medium bodied with mild carbonation, but tasty. Overall, a solid beer with a really unique flavor...reminded me of a lambic because of its distinct fruitiness. I still liked it."
"A very unique beer."
"Drinks alright, a lot to fruitty for me, someone probably digs this. I'll be sexist & think it would a just a few women.Not a good example of a wit by far..."
"This could be the ultimate beer for back porch relaxing, or enjoying after the lawn is cut. This was my first beer by the Leinenkugel family, but I will now be on the lookout for any more styles I can get my hands on."
"Not one I will buy again."
"I could drink this like water on a hot summer day no doubt. I bet the ladies will like it a lot more."
"D- this is a very drinkable beer if you like sweet tastes."
"It's easy to drink but I don't see myself putting down more than two of these in a sitting. Blueberry overload, plus the cloying affect may get to me after more than a couple. I'll drink one and then move along to my hoppy goodness ;)"
"Poured a nice, golden orange color with a small, white head with almost no retention. A little bit of a lacing after the head disappears, but not too much. It smelled nice and fruity, which was nice; definitely reminded me of Blue Moon. A strong, fruity and citrusy taste with no real aftertaste. However, the citrus flavors were slightly more evident in this beer than in Blue Moon. It had a decent mouthfeel; a little on the thin side, but this may have been due to the fact that it was on tap. Pretty drinkable beer; seems pretty light and not too alcoholic. Can definitely get lost in a bunch of these and not even realize it."
"First time I'd seen Sunset Wheat in this part of the country. Lots of fresh lemon, citrus, and floral scents. Very unfiltered and cloudy, low head retention. Almost takes like a pilsner and lemonade combined, which isn't that bad of a thing. If this was a hot day and I just finished cutting the lawn or jogging, this one would hit the spot. One of the better Wit's around."
"Body is rather light and refreshing with a slick, wheaty mouthfeel and soft, creamy carbonation. The mouthfeel is the most attractive aspect of this beer."
"This beer is way too sweet for me. This might be a good way to get someone into beer by hitting them with this sugary Wit, but for someone who knows the style a little better I would not recommend this. It's just way too sugary."
"Drinkability is poor. If I drank more than a few, it would feel like I just ate dessert. Definitely a one or 2 kinda beer."
"Drinkability: I had this sitting inside with okay weather outside. I imagine this beer would have tasted a little better if I was sitting outside on a sunny day. Not bad, but the taste is almost too artificial for me."
"($11.84 / 6-pack with tax included ... ouch !)"
"I'm glad there's a note added about blueberry being added. I thought I might have been handed a Wachusett Blueberry by accident. There's nothing offensive about this beer, which is a good place to start. The flavor is just too spicey/fruity (mostly blueberry). There's hardly any normal beer flavors. I like those, but maybe I'm just a stickler."
"I tried this right after an Allagash White, but there is no comprison, the Allagash blows this away, but the Leinie is lighter, so it may be better after a hot day."
"Light and tangy with some pleasing puckering tartness.Would taste great after mowing the lawn. Too much of a ladies drink for me,it does go down easily though. If you like lemonade give it a try"
"Pours a hazy golden orange color with a large white head that has pretty good retention and lacing. The aroma is highly fruity with mainly orange and blueberry notes and a touch of spice. The smell is too artificial-like and smells a lot like Fruit Loops or Fruity Pebbles. The taste has a noticeable wheat characteristics with more of the artificial fruit/citrus flavors. The mouthfeel is too undercarbonated and watery. Overall, this is just too artificial for my liking. Would make a great beverage for the women and kids though."
"Pours a cloudy orange with a big two finger head. Head settles quickly and leaves no lacing. Aroma is big on sweet orange and wheat. Slightly articifical smelling. Taste is oranges, pineapple and blueberries. Too sweet. Moutfeel is rather thin with a cloying swallow. Sugar stays on your tounge long after swallowing. Way too sweet to drink more than one. An interesting alternative to Blue Moon, but not necessarily better."
"Pours light orange, slight translucency, a finger and a half of foamy head, quickly dissipating. Slight lacing throughout. Nose is immediately sweet wheats, like Fruit Loops. Taste follow with a Fruit Loopiness up front (sugary and wheaty) but does balance out a bit. That sweetness sticks in the back of your mouth a bit, though. Not your standard witbier, interesting and good after some heavier beers."
"A refreshing and very drinkable beer, but because of all the fruit taste and smell in this beer, I can't drink more than 2 at a time. Still a good summertime beer."
"About what I expected. Nothing incredible, but not bad either. It's better than Blue Moon, anyway. Not something I'd buy again, but finishing up the six pack won't be an unpleasant task."
"overall this is a fair beer, not as bad as others have said, im not a fan of the style but its better than other wits ive had. i think this is a sessionable beer, one might get the beer farts if sessioned though"
"Poured from a bottle, it's a rather cloudy orange brew with a big chunky head. The nose consists mostly of orange, wheat and malt. It's a sweet citrusy beer, the malt is repressed and the hops nearly non-existant. It's actually a fairly thin beer as far as mouthfeel goes, but the finish is rather syrupy. It goes down easily, but I have a feeling the sweet finish will get to be cloying after a couple beers."
"Poured a pale golden-orange and very cloudy. Thin white head of tight bubbles shows weak retention but leaves nice big whisps of sticky lace. The nose is of orange-scented pine-sol; the lager yeast seems to have stripped this of the normal ale aromas and replaced it with a strange interpretation of orange rind, faint wheat, distant crystal malt and an odd acetaldehyde note. Sweet upfront with wheat and light crystal malt on the tip of the tounge. The citrus flavor kicks in with a vengence and brings some pineapple and cherry esters with it. Graham crackers and citrus hold on well into the drying aftertaste. A passable balance is achieved with mildly fruity american hop flavor and a muted bitterness. This sure is one wierd Wit.... a lot of unexpected flavors to sort out - but I won't say I don't like brewer's pushing the boundaries. The lighter mouthfel is given texture from the wheat and the medium carbonation seems snappy and lively probably due to some acetaldehyde action. Finishes somewhat candyish- a bit too sweet and overly fruity, I can't say it would be the best summer guzzler; but perhaps the brewers will tweak the recipe and end up with a cool concept brew."
"Terrible beer... if you can call it that. It was like drinking fermented pop. I generally like Leine but this was just an awful one to try and finish. Almost no head, any foam at the beginning fizzed away in seconds like a club soda. Doesn't even taste like hops were used in making it."
"Two words... BOO BERRY! This just needs some marshmallows and it'd be the perfect kid's beer! Seriously it's that bad! I usually LOVE witbier, but I'm thinking about pouring this one down the sink! The sickeningly sweet blueberry bubblegum aftertaste is making wish I was drinking something better like, I hate to say it, bud light! Yeah Sunset Wheat is almost that bad!"
"Pours a cloudy yellow with an orange hue. Fluffy white head, with good retention,and lacing. Smell is of citrus,and spice. Nice, but a bit weak. Body is light to medium,and carbonated. Taste is of orange cream,and spice. Sweet, but with a nice edge in the finish. This is a good version of this style."
"Take a pass. Unless you're on a lakeshore in Wisconsin this July. It'll work just fine then."
"Honestly the most fruity beer I've ever had. I like it. It's refreshing, easy drinking, good carbonation, and leaves you thinking. What the hell is this beer. Hard to even describe. Orange, berry, lemon, etc..etc. Name a fruit it may be in here."
"I stopped by a local store in Concord NH and to my surprisement they carried a good selection for being NH, I bought a six pack of this along with some others and this is a very good wheat beer. Its almost as good as the flying goose's wheat beer.They have an awesome wheat beer that is no comparison."
"This is a dangerously drinkable summer beer. An excellent gateway beer, and all around a tasty beverage. I'd recommend this one."
"Warning: It could be very easy to drink bottle after bottle of this stuff, if you consider that a bad thing."
"This brew may have some crossover appeal and will certainly become more enjoyable as the weather warms, but I'll likely find many other beers to choose from."
"Cloudy yellow-orange wheat on tap at Buffalo Raceway Brewfest. Moderately cidery aroma. Sourness aggressive carbonation and drying. Average drinkability. Medium to lighter mouthfeel, with a bit of fruit and wheat in here.A summer beer served by surprise at the end of winter, and not too unwelcome."
"As is the style this brew is very drinkable. A bit heavy on the citrus though for my taste. I'm sure this is served on tap with a giant orange slice on the glass, which would just put it over the edge into complete overkill. A little lighter on the fruit, and a bit heavier on the wheat and I could really get into it. It has peaked my interest into looking for other Leinenkugel brews."
"Served on tap at PJW in Blue Bell. Cloudy and opaque in appearance with a thin white collar of foam. Aroma was citrusy and with a hint of blueberries. The flavor was mild by witbier standards, almost like a hoegaarden mixed with an american pale wheat ale. There was a definite fake froot loops quality in the flavor as well. Not bad, not good, just present. Oh and of course there was the lovely blueberry taste as well. Very pleasant unless you dislike blueberries I suppose. Mouthfeel was light, crisp and went down smoothly. If by chance I ever see this beer again it would drink well on a warm summer evening. Nice job."

"12 oz. bottle; brewed with malted wheat, cluster hops, coriander, and hints of blueberry. It pours into the weizen glass a cloudy peach/tangerine, with medium carbonation that builds up two fingers of white head before reducing to an eighth of a inch and distributing sparse lacing. It smells of orange juice and blueberry muffins, with a light spiciness and maybe some anise. The body is light and crisp, with airy carbonation and flavors of tart wheat, orange peel/orange soda, spicy coriander, a lemony twang, blueberry, and perhaps some banana, all of which combine to impart a medium finish. Definitely a sessionable beer, and one I found to have both witbier and American pale wheat characteristics."
"I went in a little weary but came out rather impressed and surprised. I'll have to visit more of Leinenkugle's lineup soon."
"Nice cloudy pour with a decent head. Light amber. Looks nice. WTF is that smell? The Trix reviewers are right. They have hit the nose on this beer. Smells like nothing natural on god's green earth. Smells like man created citrus. Taste is actually not bad. Some lemon zing, some wheat, but then than smell comes back at you. Smooth body, great mouthfeel, and a good drinkability. But you've got to be able to get past the smell to enjoy the benefits this beer has to offer."
"Bottom line: A nice refreshing example of the style that should help with the summer time heat. I like it."
"Overall, Leinenkugel Sunset Wheat is a nice, refreshing beer product that is fruity and easy- drinking. It is less expensive than other craft beer and Leinenkugel products enjoy a wide distribution base. Im enjoying mine right now, in the cold of winter but this seems like a beer that was made for the summer season. The light refreshment and the fruity flavor make it a fine brew for warm weather drinking."
"Easy to drink and pretty tasty. An interesting take on the style. Could definitely be a crossover beer too."
"Better luck next time Leiny!"
"The mouth feel had a bit of a snag for me though. There was a lingering thick sandy feeling on my tongue that got worse as i finished the pint. I think that I'll pass on this one in the future. Was that an allergic reaction?"
"I really recommend this beer if you want to try something different and fruity."
"So, I liked the color and hazy hue of this witbier. I assume the name ""sunset"" may have been inspired by the look of this beer served in a round goblet. It is very aromatic and fruity to the nose. I would call the mouthfeel ""medium bodied"" and the flavor lingers a bit after swallowing. This beer is very pleasant and easy to drink. The only thing I would like to see changed is the blueberry ""shot"" is a bit overwhelming, Nice to see a larger brewery going up against Blue Moon (Coor's Belgian White Ale)."
"Drinkability and Mouthfeel: This is a beer that I will most likely not be buying again. It is just too hard to drink, too sweet for my taste. Not all that reminiscent of the Wit bier style it trys to emulate. Mouthfeel is thin and watered down, not quite as noticable though if served colder. Finishes on the dry side."
"I agree with what most people have said about the beer. The best part of the beer was the color and head. The beer had an overwhelming smell and taste of lemon zest. The lemon flavor and aroma was completely over powering. The first few sips were enjoyable but after that the flavors were to much. I sruggled through the bottle."
"This beer was served to me on draft. It appeared to be a murky greenish yellow color with no head. The smell was extremely fruity - rather nice. The taste was a bit like cough syrup mixed with a liquified lemon candy. The mouthfeel was light to medium bodied. As for drinkablity, this beer would be a bit much for me - it made my mouth pucker. If you like fruity beers, this would be worth a try."
"Sugary and full of fruit flavors up front with some balance following but not really enough to keep this one grounded. Heavy blueberries and citrus but waaaay too sweet for me. Mouthfeel is respectable but doesn't ssave the taste. For me, this is an overdone fruit beer as oppossed to a wit. There is some tallent here, it's just flawed and need some tweaking. It is quenching but I just can't drink much of it at once. Maybe I'll save the rest for the summer because I'm definitely not feeling them now."
"M-D: The feel of this beer makes it highly drinkable. I could really have a few of these on a nice sunday, but with all the beers still to try I will have this beer once in a while."
"Definitely a one a day beer."
"A lot of standard witbier (spice and sharp wheat) are found along with a blueberry flavor that adds a unique characteristic. Overall, it seems pretty average."
"The sweetness and candy-like fruitiness is too much for me personally. Might be okay in the summer - reminds me of a carbonated Tang in a way. Or better like a Fruit Roll-Up, as there is a plastic-like taste in the sweetness."
"Overall, i think this is one of those few beers that really stands out with it's uniqueness. I like the fact that i have not had a beer similar to this at all. In fact, there are quite a bit of characteristics in this beer that i dont think are beer-like, but it works (for me). Would be great on a hot afternoon."
"Overall- You would swear you were drinking iced-tea. Not horrible but this must be served up while floating in a pool on a hot July day!"
"Drinkability: I typically sit down with a single brew over dinner, but this one I had to grab a second, and would have grabbed a third had I not wanted to save them for the rest of the week."
"coming out to 4.9%."
"too make things worse I hear this is the worst hangover beer of all-time... with all that artificial sweetner stuff going on I wouldn't doubt it."
"Bought this beer after hearing the raves about it, I wanted to see what it was all about. It poured like a normal wheat beer. No real head. no lacing. tasted like fruity pebbles. nothing i will try again, especially with the speciality beer price tag"
"Not the most impressive wheat beer I've ever had."
"Subtle notes of wheat and orange in the aroma, but the taste kicked it up a notch. Rich and tangy (for a Wit), full bodied wheats with touches of an orangey citrus. Very nick drinker, Ill make sure I pick some up for the wif-zilla  whom luvs this style."
"Poured light and cloudy with a moderate spice character and aroma. Slightly sweet malts and no real hop presence- not exactly balanced. Not sure what the natural flavors are which this beer is brewed with, but the taste is overwhelmingly artificially fruity. Mix a bag of pop rocks with a miller lite- same effect. The only saving grace was that it went down smooth and fast with no real problem."
"Drinkability is quite good, and were it not winter now, I could easily see putting a few away on a hot summer day."
"12 ouncer w/o freshness indication, pours typical, cloudy light tangerine, with a near white head that quickly morphs to a thin, tiny bubble film. A moderate swirl leaves respectable sticky lacing. Lemony sweet nose, then a pleasant, smooth yeasty, lemony wheat experience. Nice American wheat, decent warm weather quaffer. Nothing amazing but would do with a warm weather lunch, salad, cheese,bread etc."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a cloudy pale yellow-gold color wiht a fizzy white head. The smell is huge, I can smell it from a foot away. Citrus, orange and lemon dominate with coriander and other spices on backup. Taste is very much like the nose, with the orange citrus and coriander coming through the most and has a wheaty finish. The mouthfeel is pretty light, with a decent amount of fizzy carbonation. This is a drinkable beer and for the price you'll be hard pressed to find another as tasty."
"Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat pours a gold color with a white head into my pint glass. There is a fruity aroma that is mostly citrus. Taste is dominated by an orange flavor and you can taste the wheat somewhat. There also seems to be some other spices that I can't put my finger on. I enjoyed this beer, I don't think it's something I would buy all the time, but under the right circumstances it quite enjoyable. Worth a try."
"Far too lop-sided, leaning ridiculously heavy toward the citrus and Flavor #37 (or whatever they flavor Trix with)...it forgets about the things that make a great wheat beer great. Never again."
"Wow this is a tasty beer! I did not expect much because it pours like a typical macro brew from St. Louis. The head is ok but subsides very fast. The taste is what is very impressive here. This brew tastes very much like the breakfast cereal fruity pebbles! It was a pleasant surprise to say the least. I give this brew two mugs up."
"Pours with three finger white head that goes quickly leaving a little lace. Cloudy amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Apricot nose. Starts with a apricot flavor but is nicely balanced, finish is clean. Unusual wheat. $1.29 for a 12oz bottle from John's Grocery Iowa City, IA."
"Still, most of the way through the bottle, it's growing on me. It's actually a surprisingly drinkable brew. Just might end up picking up some more at a later time."
"Has a nice full flavor taste that is smooth. The tartness really comes through, as well as an aftertaste of blueberrys and light grain. Goes great with the usual orange wedge on the side. A very appealing summer beer, however, not one I would drink several of at one time."
"Body is a hazy, dull yellow. Smallish white head is fleeting and leaves some patchy lacing on the glass. Aroma is fruity, with orange and lemongrass competing with some pepper and coriander notes. Mouthfeel is thin and selzery. Spritzy carbonation. Taste mirrors the aroma. Lemonrind and coriander with a hint of pepper and malted wheat. Thin and unsubtantial. Very refreshing and bargain priced, a nice pale wheat ale for summer sessions, otherwise unremarkable."
"This beer took me by surprise. A friend had a bunch in the fridge, which his brother in law brought, and he had not tried it. We opened it, and there was not much to the smell, beyond the typical citrus for a wheat beer. When I took a swig, though, the berry flavor was kind of a shock, since it did not mention it on the label. Very unusual, but as I finished it off, I decided it was a good thing. The appearance, even though I had it out of the bottle, I could tell was the cloudy gold you would expect. Mouthfeel was light, and well carbonated. I had three of them, and at that, it was not overpowering, so I figure the drinkability was pretty high, but I am not sure I would want to overdo it."
"Beer poured a very cloudy banana color with very little head. The smell is a bit of yeast and very strong citrus flavoring. It is the same in taste. It almost tastes like they used some super citrus candy extract to create this flavor because it is almost unnatural. Not pleasant at all and I really wanted to like this beer. Carbonation was sharp, and in pair with the flavor really sealed the deal on this brew not being worth it. I am shocked to see the ratings that others have given it. Lord I just hope the lines were dirty at the bar."
"Poured a hazy yellow with a small white head. Served with an orange slice as well. Not a whole lot going on in the nose. Mostly citrus and thats about it. Taste was very light and citrusy, tons of lemon, orange, coriander. Not much hops going on but it is tasty nonetheless. It definitely had a fizzy and thin mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very drinkable and light wheat ale, something that would hit the spot in July, but not very welcoming now (mid-January)."
"Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat is a delicious tasting beer, if you enjoy fruity flavors in beers. It is a bit of an over the top version, and is probably a very polaring flavor."
"I'll drink it again...maybe just not in mass quantity like other brews."
"Overall not something I would buy on my own as this was a case club selection."
"I wasn't expecting much with this one and was pleasantly surprised. Could I drink many of these in one sitting? Likely not, but it's still a solid brew in all aspects that I'll likely pick up again and that is certainly worth a try."
"I'm really trying to step outside myself here, since I don't really like this style of beer very much. And I really would have considered it a Whitbier, rather than an American Pale Wheat Ale. Be that as it may, it has an unfiltered, cloudy appearance with a volumnous cloud of white, frothy foam after the pour. The smell: piña colada, cotton candy, ripe oranges, and coconut. The taste, pretty much what you'd expect from the smell: Orange Julius. Interesting...again, not to my taste, but I think the brewer really put his or her mark on this beer, and I gotta respect that. Nevertheless, I think the cacauphony of flavors overwhelm the malt and the beer part gets lost, which is never a good thing. Moderately full body, especially considering the fruity overtones. I can see where this could be a quite refreshing drink."
"Poured into a pint glass. The color is cloudy yellow in color with loads of carbonation - head is bright white and thick at first, it also sticks around the whole time with some lacing. Smells like lemon and other citrus - maybe a little bread there, but it's predominantly lemon. Taste is also extremely citrusy as though a bunch of lemon juice got in the batch, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it could be more subdued. There is also a bit of biscuit taste in the end. Mouthfeel is fine - way too much carbonation for me. It feels like I'm drinking soda. This could be refreshing on summer's day - seems like it would be good for folks who aren't into beer yet. Recommended."
"Oh and did I mention it came with a sunset wheat flavored chapstick?Just added bonus to run and try this beer....uhm yeah."
"This one pours a cloudy light orange with a foamy white head. The smell is very fruity, orange, cherry, lots of sweet notes, reminds me of fruity pebbles cereal. The tase was mostly orange, but many fruit notes, tasted like cereal, but not in a super offensive ""what happened to this beer"" sort of way. There wasn't much else to the taste, the wheat was there, but the fruit drives this beer beginning middle and end. It had a good balance to it being a medium-light beer with good carbonation. I wouldnt be able to drink more that a few just from the powerful taste, but it was nice and refreshing. Worth checking out if, especially if you are into the fruit beers. I don't know why they call it an American pale wheat ale, no hops to speak of and very little wheat. Oh well, Leinenkugels makes good beer for the low price. Enjoy."
"This beer started out promising, but turned to disappointment quickly."
"addendum - I've just been reading other reviews of this beer (I never do that before I review). Am I nuts? Does no one else get blueberry muffins out of this thing? You have GOT to be kidding me! I mean in a blind smell test I couldn't tell the difference between this beer and a muffin if you put a gun to my head. Maybe I've got a very unusual brain tumor..."
"Jake's lemony and berryish Sunset Wheat really hits the spot on a hot summer day (not that there are an over-abudance of those in Wisconsin!), or even a cold winter night with friends gathered round. It pours a cloudy gold that's almost like brass, and a huge head of frothy white. The retention is quite good, and the head slowly dwindles to a wide collar of creamy bright white along with a cottony, almost-solid, surface covering. It continually leaves lace throughout the glass in wide, craggy splashes... very nice! It's so fruity in the nose that you might initially think you've poured the Berry Wheat mistakenly until you realize it's more citrusy (lime). It is juicy, and tangy like berries though. As it warms the wheaty malt becomes apparent, as does some spice (grains of paradise? white pepper?... maybe it's just from the yeast... doubtful). It's a touch peachy and apricot-like as well. It's smooth across the palate with a gentle zest of carbonation and light-medium body. The flavor is as the nose suggests, with citrusy flavors dominating a light, sweet, somewhat wheaty malt base. The bitterness is limited, but it's balanced by the tartness of the citrus. Quite refreshing! And interesting to boot! It's drinkability might be up in the air, depending upon what you like, but if you're open to a fruity and citrusy beer, this one might work."
"Overall: A solid hefe/wheat beer, recommended."
"Mouthfeel is thinner than some other unfiltered American wheat ales out there. This beer is easy to drink, especially on a warm day, and sessionable at 4.9% abv. I could, and sometimes do have two or three. It is widely available at restaurants in my area, (often served with a slice of orange) but there are other beers I'd prefer if they were available at those locations. This one is worth trying."
"Edit: I had this beer 3-30-06, very strong blueberry presence, like a blueberry muffin."
"The beer poured a cloudy medium tan with a ample white head that lasted a fair amount of time that left a large circle of foam around the side of the glass The aroma of coriander was the outstanding smell with some hops and a little malt thrown in. The coriander came through on the tongue as well and dominated the little malt sweetness. NO hops. The mouthfeel was a little light with a touch of carbonation. A nice wheat beer but not outstanding in any aspect."
"The most noticeable feature of this beer was the smell, especially that smell you get when you have a mouthful: perfumy! My God was it powerful, sort of like industrial strength Janitor in a Drum. I got the impression they must have flavor this stuff with a used urinal mint. Certainly will not replace Hoegaarden in my beer fridge."
"Drinkability - I'm not real big on the Leine's, but I have been more likely to choose a Leinenkugel than a Miller, Bud or Coors. Not real excited about the recent barely beers being produced by this local legend. Is Miller going to use this brand to straddle the boundary between alchopops and beer? Ugh."
"DO NOT ADD CITRUS FRUIT TO THIS BEER."
"Overall Impression: Impressed! Figured this for an easy karma point, and really ended up enjoying it. A lot of good things going on in this beer, and no obvious flaw (well, maybe the body and carbonation level, and the fact that it is tied with Miller- damn you Miller). A great summer brew, Ill look for this again."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"B'ham UK (written while in Tampa Nov 2006)"
"The beer pours a cloudy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a wonderful citrus scent that compliments the sweet wheat aroma. It has a sweet orange peel feel. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth wheat flavor with a dry, yet flavorful citrus orange finish. This is a damn good brew for the summer months. The mouthfeel is excellent. It's a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good beer. It's light with lots of great taste; a good drinker."
"Drinkability: can have a few glasses of this in a night (not back to back though; it's too sweet for that)"
"I got to say first of all this is the best damn wheat ale I have ever had and I am very suprised that Leines could make a wheat ale this good. Ok to start things off this ale is brewed with superb malted wheats tasty cluster hops and a natural coriander, with a pale cloudy goldish colour. Sunset Wheat has a soothing taste that will leave you speachless. It's kind of like your very own sunset in a bottle. It's also the best serve chilled at a stellar 40F."
"Overall impression: This is obviously meant to take a piece of the Blue Moon market. It's not a bad beer, but I'd take a Blue Moon over this any day."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with pull by date on neck into a weizen glass. Had a yellowish color with good head that slowly dissipated. Little carb. The smell was heavy on the citrus with strong overtones of taragon/black licorice. The taste followed the smell and was way too reliant on the extreme citrus. Found it hard to finish the beer because of the strong citrus/licorice flavors. Read some good reviews on this and was excited to try but already looking to dump the rest of my sixer on unsuspecting friends. Only worth trying if you want to mark off list. (2.0, NA, ML, N)"
"Pours a hazy light golden color with a thin white head and a fine carbonation of tiny bubbles billowing up from the bottom of the glass. Good amount of wheat in the nose along with some spicy coriander. That same coriander is a bit overpowering in the taste but there is another strong lemony (almost like a lemon scented cleanser) flavor that stands out. Seems out of place for the style."
"New in town. Got a six pack at Albertsons. The aroma invokes a picturesque stroll through an Orange Grove. The sweet yet subtle scent of Orange Blossoms lingers in the air and you imagine you can even smell a bit of the bitter notes of orange peel and snapped citrus branches. Then you step on the skunk lurking below your feet and he sprays you with his own special social retardant. So to recap: oranges, orange blossoms, citrus branch and nasty skunk musk. The body is a hazy pale yellow the color of a sick canary and holds a diminishing pinky sized white head. The flavor offers sweetened cereal grains in the fore reminiscent of the sugary milk slop youd gulp down after finishing your Sweetum Smacks as fuel for a vigorous Saturday morning of cartoon watching. Some orange dreamsicle notes appear bursting with artificial orange and cream. The effect is very manufactured in that the flavors seem chemically induced through additives rather than from the brewing process. But, I guess brewing is chemistry. I'm not saying the sweetness IS artificial it very well may not be...but it does TASTE artificial. Its not awful, but it is sickly sweet and rather reminds me of some poorly made fruit beers with its sweet intensity."
"The taste is out of this world, just enough carbonation to tingle the tongue, but little enough to make it feel incredibly smooth in your mouth. This beer is as drinkable as water, expect to finish your entire 6-pack rather quickly"
"One of Leinenkugel's better efforts. A fun beer to enjoy."
"Oh yeh I must add, (not that this has anything to do with my rating) good luck trying to find something to eat with this. The taste is so citrusy it goes awful with pizza, crackers, cheese, etc. I guess I'd recomment eating fruit with this if you like."
"Pours a hazy golden color into my wheat beer glass. Nice white head that it retains well and it leaves some lacing. Aroma isn't what I expected, citrusy and some spices. Tastes citrusy, the coriander is too strong and it has almost a chemical taste, it reminds me of suntan lotion (well, how it smells). I don't get the funk others are talking about. Mouthfeel is medium/light bodied. I don't like this one at all, I wish I didn't have 5 more of these."
"Pours out a very hazy, nice wheat-straw color, though the head is almost non-existent. Pleasant nose consisting of strong wheat note and light coriander. Good wheat flavor, citrusy, but coriander is much stronger and out of balance, almost soapy. Powdery texture, a little watery in the body."
"Overall a pretty decent wheat ale. Very impresive for a macro type offering. Thanks to makeitavintage for this one."
"Pretty bad when you have to scour your pantry for something to take the taste out of your mouth. Garden Herb Triscuits did it."
"Pleasantly surprised! The first good beer I've had from Leinenkugel. I would buy this again, and I think I will snatch up a 6 pack before they disappear, as they are probably falling out of season. This is nearly as good as Vuuve (in a similar way) and Celis (in a different way), and far surpasses Blue Moon and Sam Adams as far as macrobrewed Wit's go. Recommended!"
"D: Not too bad, I kind of like the funkiness in this one. Was the best brew from Leinenkugel that I had in my opinion."
"Pours a hazy yellow copper with quickly dissipating head. The smell is anise, candy, citrus, bubble gum and or fruity pebbles. Taste is not bad, but there is medium to weak body, the complexity is all in front and doesn't last through the end. Honestly it doesn't do too much for me and I wont buy it again( Thank heavens a friend gave it to me and I didn't buy it). If you want a real wheat beer this is not it, leave this to the kids."
"Drinkability was right where it should have been."
"D- I could barely finish this one. I love wheat ales but this just about killed me. My mom would love this."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with a thick white head that dissipates to a creamy 1/8inch head that lasts the entire drink. Excellent aroma with the strong smell of orange and hints of lemon zest and blueberry. I loved the taste of this beer! True, it's different, but that is part of the appeal. Very smooth taste with a citrus fruity flavor that is very refreshing."
"Cloudy yellow with a thin head of tiny white boubles. Aroma is strange but not altogether offputting mix of lemon zest and peptobismal. This beer is light bodied and very high in astringincy with a thin and artifical citrus flavor that is seriously like drinking the yellow Fruit Loops. Honestly I'm kinda into this, but it is very funky, and near the bottom of my list for the style and the brewery. Refreshing though."
"The appearance is light-straw and cloudy. Smell is lemony. The taste is very unique, like oranges and lemons and fresh cut flowers with very little noticeable malt or hops. A number of my friends have compared this to Blue Moon but I find it to be quite different - in a good way. Worth trying once."
"I happened to enjoy orange creamsicles as a kid, and as such i found this to be drinkable, and enjoyed how it took me back to summer as a kid. It wasnt much of a beer, but was enjoyable in more of a guilty pleasure fashion. Could knock a few of these back, although i would suggest avoiding it if you dont like orange creamsicles. Might make a good crossover beer for an appropriately targeted audience."
"I tried this beer very quickly after it came out, as I am a huge Leinenkugel's fan. It did not disappoint. Pours a golden/orange color with a nice head. Has hints of citrus and blueberry in the aroma. The taste was great, a nice fullness with hints of blueberry, citrus and corriander. A very refreshing drink on a hot day, but I believe will still stand up for a fuller winter beer."
"This is the kind of sour you get from kissing your own sister(I can say this because I don't have one.). Sour because she is beautiful and you are in love and you have yet to learn that she is indeed your sister. A chance encounter kind of sour but with this one you're perpetually suspended in the moment that you are first told so that sour is good and the world is still beautiful and you're in love and your sister is still your girl. You get the point. A renegade wheat beer with a pucker face that doesn't go into a full blown suck. Light, citrusy and tangy as a nine volt battery."
"Not a bad ale, but just the same, it is not one to get excited about."
"Miller Brewing introduced this beer to counteract the success their rival Coors brewing had had with their Blue Moon offering. After pouring a glass of the Leinenkugel's Sunset wheat out I notice that it had a distinct blond appearance much similar to that of Blue Moon. The smell was uninspiring. After tasting the beer I was pleased to find a nice sweet and smooth taste. The beer gopes down easy and it doesn't take long for 1 beer to be finished off. I am disappointed to report that the relative differences between this and Blue Moon are farely undistinguishable in my opinion. However, this beer does feel good while watching the sun set over a midwestern lake. Not a bad beer for the summer months at all. I would recommend this to anyone who has some time to kill up at the lake or enjoys sweet wheat beers."
"I'm going to stick with my initial 3.5's across the board here. Would I choose this if given the choice between this and countless other beers? Likely not, but for what it is... a no frills average American wheat beer, you can do alot worse."
"Drinkability: An easy drinker, not bad, but just too sweet for me to enjoy more than one at a time. This one be a good chick beer or maybe for some one who really doesn't like the taste of beer and likes alcopops."
"Overall, a surprisingly tasty refreshing summer wheat lacking only complexity and length."
"Was out at a local pub last night and surprised to see this one as the only non-BMC selection (not totally true as SNPA and Oberon were represented, but have gotten a bit sated with those lately.) Anyway, decided to give it a shot. Very similar to Oberon on the whole. Orangish, hazy appearance, with a pretty full whitish-tan head. Smells of citrus. Typical orange aroma is there--too much as unbenownst to me they brought the first out with an orange wedge in it--remedied the second time. Also the typical wheat and slight spice (never sure what to call it--corrander?) smell. Pretty appealing. The taste is wheat up front and almost overwhelming fruity sweetness at the back of the swallow. Oddly enough, blueberries overshadowed the typical orange taste. At first this taste was very appealing. By the end of the beer, and certainly with the second, though, it becomes a bit too much. Mouthfeel is pretty light and crisp. Nothing special. On the whole, this is a pretty decent beer to sit outside and drink on a warm summer night, though after a second round, my mouth is screaming for heavy doses of water as the sugary sweetness has become a bit too much."
"Not to slam this beer, but overall I was not overly impressed."
"D: Maybe it'd be better after a long day of sweaty work. Other than that, it ain't that great."
"This is a decent drinkable beer. Good summer and session brew."
"Leinies Sunset Wheat is a great alternative to the fine coriander taste of Blue Moon. Sunset Wheat is a thinnish lager that pours nicely into a pint glass but loses its head rather quickly. I tasted orange/coriander bursts throughout this enjoyable brew, but was very taken by a strong impression of blueberries. This beer will make a great addition to the Leinenkugel year-round stable, and is heartily recommended for anyone looking for something a little different for their next cookout."
"This tasted more like Sprite or Fresca than beer. I almost finished my cup. My friends seemed to like it though. It's beer for people who don't like beer."
"Pours out to a light yellow cloudy color with a medium level of carbonation. Head of white foam dissipates at a reasonable rate. Some lace. Aroma smells like the Trix bunny crapped in my beer. Lots of artificial fruity smells, berries, citrus, bananas. Very much Trix like. Taste is amazingly similar: Trix. Mild maltiness blends again with medium fruity flavors of berries, citrus and a touch of estery bananas. Some notes of grass and hay. Mouthfeel is good, refreshing and bubbly. Rather smooth. Drinkability is only average, I'm getting bored with this already. Interesting, yet lackluster and contrived. Worth a sample."
"I hadn't heard good things about Sunset Wheat, but it's actually decent beer and is an acceptable summer quaffer if well-chilled. I have to give Leinenkugel's credit for thinking outside the box with regard to the coriander (and something else?). Too bad they seem to have an inherent inabililty to brew truly good beer."
"Overall a good little spring beer thats drinkable while not overpowering."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a cloudy blonde color with a half inch carbonated white head which went away pretty quickly. The first scent I pick up is of blueberries. I can also smell lemon, orange and wheat/grains in the beer as well. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the taste of the beer considering how good it smelled. There's only a slight blueberry taste at first before the wheat flavor kicked in. Not much of an aftertaste at all. The beer has a light mouthfeel, and it does go down pretty easy. Overall, it's just an average beer. There are much better wheat beers out there, but I would drink this again."
"Hazy, dirty-white orange with a small, off-white head. Nose of citrus zest, mainly lemon and orange rind. Light wheaty-siscuit background with some spice as well. Perhaps a little too citrusy. Citrus notes are up front on the palate. Orange-lemon jubilee! Thankfully, there's some malt to provide some balance. A dash of coriander finds its way too. The malt and citrus combine for a fruity sweet taste overall. Not too bad, but a maybe too sweet for a pseudo-witbier. Lemon bitterness in finish. Medium-bodied with a refreshing mouthfeel. Don't think I can have more than two!"
"D- This beer was very perfume in the apricot flavor and they tasted a bit artificial which made it hard to get through the bottom of the glass."
"Considering the haze, very light on the wheat for what I was expecting. Smooth and creamy for the most part, but overidden by a sugary sweetness that is not entirely pleasant."
"This may just taste weird (and fruity) enough to be a really good crossover beer for some...a few girls I know have tried this and liked it (who typically won't drink any beer I offer them)...I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing for this brew, but this is the most innovate thing from Leine's I think I've ever tasted."
"The non-beer drinkers at lunch the other day were shocked when I suggested they try this. One said, ""I could drink this!"" The other said, ""This isn't beer, it's carbonated apple juice."" Indeed, it is beer. Unfortunately, it doesn't taste like beer and, while it is extremely drinkable and refreshing (e.g., over BBQ on the deck), Leinie's is missing the point. Or are they? Watching non-beer drinkers enjoy it, I couldn't help but think, perhaps, this was Leinie's way of helping the less enlightened (the hard lemonade crowd) find the path to malty bliss."
"D: Me personally I don't think I would buy this beer for myself. However, my girlfriend who is not a beer drinker at all, well she likes a lambic every once in a while, loves this beer and would have it over and over again. So for my taste it's a very low drinkability but for others who are new to the style it's pretty high so I will mark it as average."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. I has a cloudy, pumpkin-like color and a small foamy head. It smelled of orange and yeast. It tasted like clove and citrus. I guess that may have been the corriander. There was also a noticeable wheat flavor. It was a little grainy in terms of mouthfeel. It was fairly drinkable, but there are many other wheat beers that I would grab before this version."
"Drinkability: Definitely the best brew I've had from Leinie's, this is an excellent, thirst-quenching-yet-savorable summer ale."
"Worth a try for a summer cooler."
"D: Not bad, but the sharp taste will limit your chugging."
"Pours a light, hazy amber color with a nice 2- finger head with fair head retention. Nice lacing on the glass. Has a very nice citrus smell to it; mouth-feel is decent and goes down good. Does have a slight bitter after-tatst though. A very refreshing beer on a hot summer day. Good beer!"
"Poured a hazy amber color with modest white puffy head. Smell is a nice combination of spices, bananas, and some summer fruits (apricot, peaches) . Taste is also fruity with someotes of raspberry and lemon to be found. Finished is summer refreshing with nice mothfeel, though a bit thin. A nice drinking beer, very refreshing."
"Tastes like they blended a nice Witbier and an American Wheat. The beer had a mildly murky yellow-ness with a soft white glaze, yet disapointing head retention. Citrusy with lemon and orange zest and a rind-like bittering. Spiced up with maybe a dash of corriander, but relying on the wheat / yeast esters to decorate. The body, like most American Wheats, end up void. Finishes nicely crisp and clean except for the lingering bitterness."
"If you expect a typical wit style beer, you will be sorely disappointed. It was served to me in a glass with an orange wedge. I removed the wedge, but the beer maintained it's overwhelming citrus aroma. The color is a hazy orange, actually very pleasant. The taste puts it somewhere between a wit and a fruit beer; too sweet as a wit, too dry for a dessert style beer. I think Leinie's would do better off turning this into a full fledged fruit beer, such as berry weiss."
"Won't personally buy it a case at a time but this is an adequate summer beer choice."
"Poured into a Schell weizen glass, no orange. Hazy pale yellow body, a little carbonation visible. 3"" of white head are formed after an aggresive pour. Lemon-lime soda in the nose up front, a little graininess follows. Taste is bland versus the style, pie crust grainy/sweetness and a little citrus is all I garner from this unremarkable beer. If this was onsale for $8.99 a 12'er (as Leinie's sometimes is) I would consider getting it if it were 95 degrees and percent humidity out. Other than that, I will pass."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a very hazy and very light straw color with a finger-sized head that falls quickly to a small ring around the top. Carbonation is not apparent. Aroma is very citrusy. Very fruity orange, lime and lemon, with corriander spice, and a mild wheaty character. Its pleasing, but a little overloaded for my taste. Flavor is again dominated with citrusy orange and lime, with the corriander spice, backed by a mild American wheat base. It finishes very clean with just a touch of orange sweetness hanging on with a very mild bitter as well. Mouthfeel is on the light end of moderate with a moderate carbonation that keeps this one feeling lighter than it is. I just think that this one goes overboard with the fruit tones that should be supporting the flavors, not defining them. I can see where this one will go over well with some as a refreshing drink in the summer heat, but I'll not be reaching for this one at my local as a go-to."
"This may be a good beer to wean folks off those sweet alco pops. Im glad to see Leines continuing to try new beers, perhaps they will launch a pale ale soon???"
"The taste was so sweet and un-beerlike that I couldn't even finish it. I tried to pass it on my Irish friend who didn't want a beer to go to waste. Even he couldn't do it. Down the drain it goes."
"i won't buy this again but i might steer someone who is looking to kill a summer thirst to buy this."
"This beer is out of whack. Leinie's took a technique of adding an orange to your wheat/wit beer for taste and completely brewed a beer that takes that citrusy taste and turns it into overkill. A really disappointing summer brew."
"For less than five dollars a six pack, this is one hell of a solid summer beer."
"Part of the Leiny giftpack I received as a present. Hazy yellow straw color with some orange around the sides. Decent fluffy medium white head that dissipates very quickly. Not too much lacing. Aroma is quite sweet and quite citric with just a moderate amount of coriander spice involved. The spice is ok but the whole smell in general is fake and too sweet. Taste follows suit but is even faker and sweeter. It seems like there's lots of aspartame in here and some orange syrup extract. Thinnish body does nothing. This is awful. I couldn't finish the bottle."
"Drinkability misses, too, bases on the too- pointed presence of lemon, against anything else. I guess I'd drink it if I had to, but they could have done better, could have tried harder."
"Pours a cloudy yellow with a normal sized head. Nose is licorice and citrus. Flavors continue with spice and anise flavors with citrus/lemon and a dash of banana. I was completely very pleasently suprised by this one and was sorry to see the pint end. Very interesting merger of flavors. Creamy, refreshing, delicious; Id definately have this one again. Thanks to jhammerly for the bottle."
"Mouthfeel is somewhat thin, which was expected. The drinkability is fine as well. This one would be great on a hot summer day at a campground."
"Overall not to bad, much better than I expected. Will make a decent summer offering."
"This beer pours a cloudy light golden hue with a thin white crown. The aroma is for the most part lemon/citrus/rind. The taste has some wheat character, but an overload of lemon zest follows that and finishes the beer. I think the beer should have a more of a wheat base to start and a bit less lemon/citrus flavor. I can't really catch any hints of the hops. It tastes like somone has already added a slice of lemon to the beer. Its refreshing but the drinkablity factor is not high considering the generous amounts of lemon/citrus found in the beer."
"D- Is this the new ""American White Ale""? A decent ""flavored wheat ale", solid intro beer for the non-beer drinker that thinks beer is simply a pale fizzy beverage. An OK pick for the veteran beer drinker that wants something light yet summerish."
"This brew could pass for a Belgium White, except for the color, good tasting... but just a bit off style in my humble opinion"
"Personally I can handle drinking a few of these but will not purchase again except for the ladies.."
"Looks a little like a wit, but more yellow. Quite cloudy. Slight frothy white head. Lace is adequate. Holy crap!! Talk about orange. This is orange all the way on the nose. A little bit artificial, like those chewy, sugar coated orange candies. Pretty charged up feel with the carbonation. Light to medium in body. Very sweet beer. Orange and corriander dominating. Artificial tasting though. Doesn't taste like beer. Not my cup of tea...er, pint of beer."
"Hazed yellow orange with thin lacing. Spicy sweet aroma of oranges in Hawaiian punch. Tastes like orange life savors dipped in sugar. Very sweet! No finish, no bitterness, no hops, no wheat, just orange sweetness and maybe a coriander touch. Very fruit juicy and unbeerlike. Cloying at a level equal to or greater than a Bacardi O alchy pop and with a similar flavor too. A dumper for me."
"Aroma is a BLAST of lemony coriander and sweet candy. WAY over the top on the coriander. I might detect the faintest hint of malt. Color is a hazy orange-yellow, a bit dark for a wit (assuming that is what it is really sort of intended to be). The head was big on the pour, and a small head sticks around for the whole session. The flavor is of lemony, orangey coriander, with some pepper, and a tad of grainy malt in the finish. Very sweet in the mouth but very dry in the finish. The pepper spiciness and coriander flavors stick around in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium-full. This aint a wit. It is far too overdone. No hop bitterness to balance the sickly sweetness. This beer may please the girlie masses, but it doesnt please me."
"Very easy drinking. Perfect summer beer."
"Pours a pale-ish golden yellow, hazy, with lots of white fluffy head. Nose is ripe with aromatic citrus, coriander, husky wheat and a hint of blueberry. Taste was surprisingly fruity as well, dripping with citrus, coriander/clove, and ripe blueberry over belgian wit yeast. Mouthfeel is a little harsh and bubbly as Leine's fruitier beers tend towards, but still quite refreshing. I can certainly see myself chugging through a sixer of this on a summer day at the park while disc golfing. Nice to see Leine's taking a chance with a very Wit-like APWA. Leaps and bounds better than Capital's sour, astringent, ever-more advertaised attempt with Island Wheat."
"Disappointing."
"Dan interesting change of pace, not one that I will buy again. Tastes similar to a fruit juice wine cooler or malternative. I think Ill pass."
"It is light in body, and really trying to be refreshing, but the orange-corriander is overdone. Too fruit juicy for me."
"(edit: some stats from their info card... 35% malted wheat, 65% pale malts, all cascade hops (barely evident, though), 4.9% alcohol)"
"Uniformly hazy straw yellow color, flat white head of about 1/4 of an inch in height and pretty short duration. Incomplete slipping lacing. Aroma is awfully reminiscent of fruit punch with a cinnamon stick in it, Cascade hops play no role -- which is fine in a Wit style though I wonder about the sales pitch. Lightish mouthfeel, carbonation comes in at a tick lower than average. Very spiced flavors, orangey, somewhat limey with pineapple and a quick transition to a chalky nutiness with coriander accents. Lots of similarities to orange ""ribbon"" fruit candy that used to be popular in holiday bowls at Christmas -- especially in the aftertaste. Seems rather obvious and not very appealing to me. I'd give it a nod over Berry Weiss, but that's not much of a recommendation at all."
"This is not half bad, in fact it's not bad at all. I can't help but note that the orange and corriander portions are rediculous and cloud over almost everything else in the beer. This will go over well."
"Leininkugel's attempt at a Blue Moon-esque Belgian White beer. Pours nice. Cloudy orange with a decent white head. Aromas of orange, coriander and yeast. A lot better aromas than I expected from a Macro brewery (Yes, they should be concidered as such) were surprising as was the flavor. Somewhat overpowering spices make it a bit harsher and seem artifcial. In the end, a decent job by Leinie's."
