3.96,5.6,4.25,3.75,4,4,4,"Poured a gorgeous cloudy golden color with two fingers of fluffy white head that slowly receded and left abundant lacing down the glass. A beautiful beer and very true to style. Scents of honey, yeasty, grainy wheat bread, a perfume-like aromatic quality, hints of orange zest and slight sweet spices and light notes of white pepper. A pleasant aroma that is fairly true to style with a bit more honey character than is usual and a bit less in the way of spice aromas. Good and true to style, but not the best example of a witbier aroma. Taste begins pleasantly sweet, with notes of honey, a slight sour tang and a nice orange zest and citrus presence. This moves into a more spicy middle with notes of coriander, white pepper and low levels of herbal/spicy hops joining a backbone of sweet malt, bready malt and a refreshing tang. Finish is semi-dry with notes of coriander, white pepper, hints of orange zest, bready wheat malt and a slight sourness, not intense at all. Aftertaste is coriander and white pepper with some wheat. A fairly good flavor profile that is nicely representative of the style. Refreshing, with a nice balance between malt, spice and orange peel flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy and smooth with a slight effervescence from moderate carbonation. Extremely easy to drink as a result and quite pleasant in feel. Very true to style. Overall this is a good example of a witbier. It hits the style quite well all categories and is a refreshing, pleasant beer.","Auraan","Jun 28, 2014"

I live the fuller body on a light style, and I love the citric finish, its summery and winter at the same time, maybe the most versatile version I have had of a Belgian wit. well carbonated yet a ton of body, zesty and pulpy almost, I like this a lot, but I am glad I paid 6 and change for a glass than 12 and change for a 750ml bottle. overpriced but tasty, another fun and challenging beer from the lost abbey. something to stock in your fridge regularly if you make six figures.","StonedTrippin","Oct 05, 2013"

Pours slightly hazy pale golden amber color with a 2 finger foamy and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of pear, grape, apple, lemon zest, orange zest, coriander, pepper, clove, floral, wheat, honey, bread, and herbal earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of yeast esters with spices and a good amount of malt balance; and nice strength. Taste of pear, apple, lemon zest, orange zest, coriander, pepper, clove, wheat, honey, floral, bread, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, citrus zest, coriander, wheat, bread, clove, honey, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of yeast ester and spice flavors; with a moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent witbier. All around great balance, complexity, and robustness of flavors for 4.8%; and extremely smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 15, 2013"

A BIG bouquet of aromas are present, most noticeably grass, spice, citrus, wheat, and a little funk. Clove, banana, spice, wheat, honey, coriander, and orange zest all intermingle to build a good Belgian Wit. A spritziness from a lot of carbonation is welcomed by a medium-light body. Another GREAT Belgian inspired brew from the crew at Lost Abbey.","phishsihq","Feb 09, 2012"

The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, citrusy, wheaty, and slight crisp finish.

In fact, it reminds of one of the greats of the style--St. Bernardus wit--as much as any other bottled American wit (and blows away those few other west coast renditions that actually make it into the bottle). Such a comparison is not given here lightly; while it is remarkable that this beer is a San Diego rendition of the style, no handicap is necessary to compare it to the best around.","beagle75","Oct 18, 2010"

Somewhat of a small bubblegum presence when warmed. Pale malt off to the side as well. A bit above light bodied and a bit fuller than your average wit. The carb is nice and amped up and a sharp and short prick on the tounge. I really enjoyed this wit for what it was, just another witbier in a sea of em in the style. Drank my pint with ease.

Smell is of citrus, and orange and citrus flavors are balanced by a noticeable hop bitterness and not quite enough Belgian yeast character. The sweet spices accentuate the residual sugar to make the beer slightly too sweet.

It has a rather bland pale and wheat malt flavor. The spicing is weak as is the yeast character. It's watery and not very complex. The mouthfeel is above average.

The peppery zesty spice is prominent up front with lots of clove and corriander. Light crsip citrus fruit, especially lemon and orange peel with a touch of honey that adds a nice sweet element.

It's a little unique in that it features a rather prominent sweet honey flavor. I like that. I wouldn't say that makes it out of line for the style, but it is somewhat novel in that respect. The look and the nose could use a little work. They're above average, but could be better. Overall, this is pretty good stuff. Who would've thunk it? Lost Abbey makes good beer.

It didn't have the zippy carbonation to uplift it's body, but it was still really drinkable.

Crackery and yeasty with a lemony twang and citrus zest smell. Spice was coriander for the most part, maybe a hint of clove character, a little sour too. Flavour was great. Crackery wheat with just a bit of sweetness, citrusy and zesty with spices filling things out nicely. A little grassy mid-palate with a balanced finish.

I like its low abv, and it certainly tastes nothing like Hoegarden mixed with Budweiser. I had this on tap at Toronado San Francisco and it was served in great condition. Poured a nice hazy golden with a light head that fades to a ring. Smells very spicy and herbal with loads of coriander. Tastes quite herbal and spicy as well with anise, coriander, some pepper, a long herbal finish and some minerality right at the end. No appreciable sweetness from the honey, but I'll bet some of that herbaceous taste is coming from there. The mouthfeel is fairly clean with some more of that herbal tang. Nice drinkability.
