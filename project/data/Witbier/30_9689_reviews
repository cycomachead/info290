"Easy drinking wit. More of an orange forward with a fair amount of coriander type wit. Lots of carbonation."
""
""
"Absolutely perfect for its intended use, a good refresher on a warm day. Really hits the spot, is easy to find, and comes in cans! Mad respect."

"This is hands down my favorite brew. If I only could drink one beer the rest of my life this would be it."

"White Rascal brewed by Avery Brewing Company, with an ABV of 5.60%  This brew pours out a nice cloudy amber color, with a nice white head.  This brew has the look of most witbier on the market.  The smell is rich with  citrus grains, and malts. You kind of pick up on a sour sweetness in the smell of this brew.  The taste is  bold with flavor.  There is citrus and a nice smoothness of grains.  The mouthfeel is rich , but smooth. There is a lot going on in this brew. Avery Brewing Company did a nice job with this brew.  There is not overpowering in this brew, it has a nice balance to it.  Overall i'm giving  White Rascal 4 out of 5."

"Would drink again, not sure if I would seek out and purchase again thouugh."

"Unpopular opinion here but undrinkable for me."

"Super drinkable. Good example of the style."

"I had the draught. Really enjoyed ty he flavor and texture with food."
""
""
"All around good beer. Not the best wit I've had but not far off."
""
"Good wit.  Bit high on the body for a wit."
"Beer taste is subjective. I should have read the label more carefully. I hate coriander. This beer might be someone else's favorite. The spice flavor makes this taste bad to me. I bought a six pack and took it back to the store. To be fair I will have to try a beer from them that is more suitable from my taste preference I'll try Avery Brewing Co. IPA or Stout next. This stuff I wouldn't ever buy again."

"I actually think this is a great beer to bring to a party, either winter or summer, since it's in cans and seems to be conservative enough for those not necessarily into beer and good enough for the beer-obsessed."

""
"Yummy! Not too heavy or hoppy"
""
"In short; an enjoyable beer."

"O - White Rascal is an ok Belgian white."
"very pale, odd oder and taste (slight hint of lighter fluid)."

"Competes with Allagash. Which is saying a lot. Love that it comes in a can. total Wine carries."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden color with a 3 finger width foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are both very good.  Has that slightly citrus, Belgian yeast funk to it.  Slightly peppery.  Taste is bready with citrus undertones, slight orange peel, ending slightly spicy with a strong clove taste and aftertaste.     It is a good beer.  Easy to drink, goes down smooth and can drink multiple ones in a single setting."

"O: Not an overdone, overblown reach, but a more subtle approach to the style. What hop presence is there does not overpower and command everything for me, the way many more hop-prevalent beers do. J'approuve."
""
"An above average beer that is very refreshing and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy light straw color. Active looking carbonation. Virtually no head, however, there are some splotches of lace in the middle. Aroma is quite fruity; like apples. Taste is sweet; the prevalent tastes are apple and spice. It is a very clean feel. Light bodied. Carbonation tickles the tongue. Crisp and refreshing and a slightly dry finish. A delightful beer which I enjoyed."

"Yes, a witbier that I actually liked.  I had this on tap and didn't really know much about it beforehand, then came to find out that it's a Belgian white, which made me feel better because I just don't go for straight wheats.  This style works better for me, and I'd actually drink this one again.  Really nice flavor, mild and very easy to put down a few."
"Light hazy yellow body. Sweet spiced aroma. Hint of banana smell. First thing I got was a dull taste from the back of my tongue. A little spice on the sides and a hint of salt."

"Hazy straw colored pour with a small white head that fades quickly and moderate carbonation. Nice strong grain and lemon aroma. Flavor is full of grain, spice and lemon. Can taste yeast, wheat, coriander, citrus and a little clove. Very light bodied. Finishes with a lingering spice flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Flavor, picking up more spice, bright floral and citrus specifically tangerine, lemon peal... Lacks body,  yet makes up in the refreshment end. Impressive beer for the style. I think it represents it well."

"Pours a lemony straw color, lingering white head. Aromas of peach and wheat dominate initially, fading to bubblegum esters, light banana, and a hint of coriander. Clove surfaces late. Flavor is less intense, with a lightly bready, crackery backbone supporting pear and peach undertones,a bit of coriander and clove, into a slightly earthy, dry finish. Lacks a bit in mouthfeel and wheat character, but a fairly characterful example of the style."

"This was a pretty good beer. It had a bright yellow slightly orangish color. The head is fluffy and white foam. I could smell some sweetness, and mild spice, and strong clover as well. I could notice some faint citrus. It has a sweetness taste to it. It also has a light body to it as well."
""
"Overall, a reasonably tasty beer, and I will say that the fact that it comes in cans gives it a head start on the usual suspects I reach for when I want a wit. Definitely a great beer to take out on the lake. And truth be told, this is probably one of my preferred offerings from Avery--at least out of their regular lineup."

"A balanced Belgian. The color looks to me to be a slightly tannish-orange. The head is close to white and definitely shows you that it is there. Flavor is ok with a little bit of spice overtones and a bit of sweetness(not too much, though). It brings a great refreshing flavor yet is light, but not too light !"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Light golden colored with plenty of haziness. Head is minuscule and only covers about a third of the top of the beer. Aroma of orange peel,some coriander,and pale wheat is present. The coriander is more prevalent in the flavor with orange peel and pale wheat playing more of a background note. The mouth is a bit watery and fairly quaffable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a cloudy golden color with a 1/5 finger of off-white head. It looks rather nice in body, though it could do with a larger, fluffier head. Scents of banana, clove, hints of coriander, earthy Belgian yeast, grainy, wheat bread malt and hints of orange peel with slight plastic-like notes. A standard, though overall pleasant witbier aroma that is true to style. Taste begins sweet, with a nice, clover honey-like flavor and a hint of bready malt, with notes of orange peel and coriander in the background. A faint tartness is also present. In the middle the honey-like flavors continue but the coriander becomes more assertive, along with hints of white pepper. The finish is semi-dry, with the flavors of coriander reaching their peak, alongside some floral, honey and white pepper notes. Aftertaste is semi-dry with notes of coriander, white pepper, orange peel and hints of bready malt. A very nice, true to style witbier flavor profile that is pleasantly sweet, refreshing, spicy yet not overpowering and a present, though not overbearing presence of orange peel. Quite nice. Mouthfeel is light bodied, with medium-high carbonation, a slight acidity and a semi-drying and vaguely creamy and smooth feel. Very nice, easy to drink and refreshing. Overall this is an excellent witbier. It stays true to style and provides a wonderfully refreshing drinking experience. While not the single best example of the style it is quite well executed and well worth trying."

"Poured out of bottle into glass. Small amount of foam that dissipated quickly. Hazy light yellow straw in color. Smelled wheat and floral. Taste was a little off balanced. Picked up lemon, peppery notes, banana. Little to much pepper taste for me and overpowered the sweet aspect. Mouth feel, crisp, good carbonation. Overall, good beer just wasn't down with the contrast."
"O: quite flavorful and drinkable... the coriander could stand to be toned down a bit... pretty tasty, serviceable Wit at any rate"

"BOD 293/13. Pours a hazy lemon yellow with an average head and lacing. Retention is poor. The light nose is of Belgian yeast over hints of lemon and spice. Light medium body with a touch of slick texture. Average carbonation level - just a touch of effervescence on the finish. A tasty wit, but with a weak flavor profile that follows the nose. On the finish, coriander is evident. This one needs to enhance the flavor. As it is, its a very good lawnmower beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - The beer is average or slightly above average. Too many good whites to go back to this beer again."

"Appearance is a pale lemon color with a finger of head that retained well and left a touch of lacing behind. The nose has the classic Belgian yeast notes expected in this style. There is some citrus flavor present, but overall the taste is pretty mild. It’s a witbier – nothing to get excited about."

"White rascal is a beer with personality, no doubt, but it's so in-your-face that I'm a bit overwhelmed."
""
"O: I'm particularly into belgian strong ales so I might be a bit biased but I'd say this is a pretty good beer. Though it is certainly of the belgian strong ale style its not as heavy as most. The prickliness is a bit much for me but the flavors are both interesting and well-balanced. Enjoy!"
""
""
""
""
"D: This is a nice offering from Avery with very little flaws noted. Not exactly a wow you beer but most Wits aren’t. Well crafted none the less. Light and crisp with some citrusy spice."
""
"O - I was a bit disappointed in White Rascal. Sure, its an average American mad wheat beer, but with some many very good wheat styles out there in the same price range it'll be hard to pick up again. I love funky yeast, but this was just downright weird. Without those notes this easily scores a 3.8. I'm sure ill cross paths with this one again and maybe The Rascal changes my mind. If light bodied American made wheat brews are your thing by all means try it. It's worth a review, but if you are looking for that typical Avery awesomeness White Rascal falls well short."

"O- very well balanced. Nice wheat background with no one aroma or flavor overpowering this beer"

"From my tasting notes: Belgian wheat beers are not usually high on my list, but on this occasion the White Rascal really hit the spot. It poured a clear golden color with the distinct Belgian yeast aroma of bananas and bubble gum. For being a lighter looking beer the mouthfeel was quite full and chewy and the taste was full and complex. There were hints of clove, banana, and yeast with a bit of orange as well. There was a lot going on in this beer that I found really enjoyable and refreshing. While I don’t always want a Belgian wheat, when I do I will definitely look for the White Rascal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"The Verdict: Good beer. This is what Blue Moon wants to be when it grows up: a Belgian white ale with citrus and spices."
""
"Overall: just kind of weak all around. nothing significant or good about it."
""
""
"I liked that peppery taste but it seem a little heavy on the lemon for me."
""
""

""
"O: Perhaps a bit cool outside to be drinking one of these but I like it & will grab more next summer for sure"
""
""
""
""

"Perhaps this beer is flawed. I'll try it again later. The date on the bottle reads ""13186"" suggesting bottling was around July. Yeah, its gotta be a fluke."

"A decidedly pleasant witbier, bolstered by a certain American sensibility - everything is in the proper Belgian order, but propped up somehow. Totally worthy of another, or further session exploration."

"The carbonation is a bit light for the style, but it fits this beer quite well. Throughout, there's a tone of orange and white pepper than comes and goes. Nice dry finish with a slight touch of wet biscuit dough. Could pair well with salads and lighter meats, grilled of course"

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 11/26/2012. Pours very hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon, orange peel, pear, banana, coriander, clove, pepper, wheat, floral, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and yeast esters with spices; and good strength. Taste of lemon, orange peel, pear, banana, coriander, clove, pepper, wheat, floral, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, orange peel, banana, coriander, clove, wheat, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with malt and spices; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, crisp, and very smooth mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent witbier! All around great balance and complexity of flavors; and very smooth to drink. I really enjoyed this one; far exceeded expectations for sure."

"Enjoyed this beer at a reception before dinner. Nice citrus taste, fruity without being too much so. Smooth, easy to drink, no strong bite or aftertaste. Not heavily sweet. I would buy this anytime. I often enjoy a good lager, and I had one when this beer ran out, and it was not as good."
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a white color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of citrus, some spice. Taste is good, citrus up front, some mild spices at the finish, very easy drinking. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer, I imagine it would be refreshing during the summer."
""
""
"overall: This is a thin beer, and barely a Witbier. I expect either effervescence or body, and since there is so little carbonation, something needs to make up for it, but doesn't. The flavor leaves a strong sugary aftertaste - that bitter/tart on the back of the tongue - which to my palate is offputting. Honestly, a Blue Moon on tap is a lot better than this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy pale yellow with small white head. Nose feature light bready wheat, heavy coriander, and highlights of orange. The taste is mild with wheat up front and the spice character follows. Nice refreshing and straight forward wit. Mouthfeel is light an refreshing. Overall, nice easy drinking beer."

"I am pouring this from the tap in my garage, out of a 5 gallon. I am not basing my comment on a 4 oz taster in a bar somewhere. i am nearly through a 5 gl tank of this, and i would usually have an ipa on tap, so a pale ale like this is going to be scrutinized every time i change the laundry. in my garage. where the beer is. This is not a weissen beer, whoever thinks that is mistaken. This is a pale ale with some added spice that actually makes it even better, a surprisingly white creamy head, you can't pigeon hole this beer. Sounds like the dryer just shut off, I'm gonna go check on that..."
""
""
""
"Overall - A fairly easy drinking and tasty brew, but in many ways just on in the crowd witbiers. Nothing was bad, but nothing really stood out either."
""
"A decent brew by Avery that I enjoyed but not sure if I would come back to this. Maybe during summer time while grilling up some burgers, but not something i would really have again as a desert."
""
""
""

"Poured into a Sam Adams glass, developed a light frothy head, appeared highly carbonated, like many of the Belgian beers. Color was a hazy straw with lots of bubbles. Aroma was sweet and of citrus and grain. Taste was light with hints of lemon and orange and a grain aftertaste. Mouthfeel was light and carbonated."
"Summary - Not a bad Witbier, but in my opinion, Blue Moon or Leine's Sunset Wheat do it better."

"It's decent."

"One of my very favorites beers in a can great taste. I am a big fans of White and this is one of my go to whites."
"12oz bottle fresh from the brewery. Super hazy yellow-white appearance, very cool how some beers can appear white. Aroma is heavy spice and yeast. Flavor is oranges, yeast, spice and seems like it fits the style well. Overall a decent beer but not one I see myself ever purchasing."
""
""
""
"Tried this beer in a bottle and on tap. If you enjoy a true wheat beer you will love this one. It has a full body and tastes of hints of coriander and citrus but not overpowering with fruit flavor. Very clean flavor without a bad aftertaste, this is a beer I could drink daily and would if I could get it locally."
"This beer poured out as a cloudy yellow color with a foamy white head on top. The retention and lacing were both pretty good. The smell of the beer is citrusy as well as a little peppery. The taste is orangey, some subtle wheat notes come through as well. The mouthfeel of the beer is light bodied with a decent carbonation. Overall this beer is pretty refreshing. Not the best Wit but still worth trying."

"Taste/feel: Wet trunk. It's not appealing. It's certainly drinkable, and the bananas help it out, but whatever's causing that wet trunk taste is not encouraging me to drink another one of these. I've had worse, but as far as a witbier, this is my least favorite of the style. It's just off-putting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad, but not great. Above average witbier. Better than Blue Moon for sure."
""
"O - It is a decent beer, but my appreciation for the style is waning."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This is a very accessible beer. This is the kind of beer that people who don't like beer say ""Oh, but I do like that one"" about. That is not to say it cannot be appreciated by a BAer. No, it isn't my first choice, but it is a nice change of pace from the intensity that I typically seek in my brews. On the sweeter side, but well crafted and highly drinkable."

"Perfect cloudy straw color with a white head that is considerably thicker than most I've encountered in this style. Lacing is quite good as well and there is a considerable amount of carbonation visible in the glass. Smell is lemony with a good wheat twang. Spices are well represented with a nice dollop of coriander, a hint of banana in the back. Taste follows the nose with a great wheat malt core and good spice component. Lemony bright with a slightly tart dryness. A bit of light crackery malt and faint banana/clove with a dash of black pepper. Feel is light with a smooth crisp carbonation. Superbly drinkable and a great version of the style. one of the best I've had. Well done Avery!"

"Overall / Drinkability: Glad I bought just one, not something I would try again. Overall a sub-par Wit. Good looking beer, and neat name and label, but it doesn't live up to the hype. Oh well, not every beer can be amazing."
""
""
""
""
"This is an OK beer. I would like more of the wheat and promised orange peel to come through. The malt and yeast give off a heavy white grape note similar to a scaled down Tripel. It's easy to drink but boring. I won't buy this again."

"UPDATE: i just drank 12 oz of this in about five minutes flat. Did I mention it was an easy drinker? My Whole Foods sells craft beer singles and I noticed this one on the shelf and only picked up one (in a can, might i add--kudos to Avery because cans are the way to go, IMO)--I'm glad I only got one because again, this isn't my favorite style...but this beer is IDEAL for a craft beer beginner, or a craft beer geek even, who doesn't like big beers, thick beers, or hoppy beers but also wants more substance than a pilsner or light lager."
""
"This beer is a little funny. If the can didn't tell me otherwise, I'd guess that it's a hefe, not a wit. But whatever it is, it's tasty. Smell, full of warm spices, is a highlight."
""
"This is a very drinkable beer, although it is just basically average. It pours a pale straw color head with a one finger head and poor retention. Lacing is left on the glass. Smell is floral and oranges. Mouthfeel is full with plenty of carbonation. Taste is very citrus on the front and mild hops on the finish. I wouldn't turn one down if offered, but I wouldn't seek it out either. Just very average."

"An average wit elsewhere it's the best wit in a can that I can think of. Not sure what that's worth. A lot if you're at the beach I guess."

"Golden yellow in the glass with a nice creamy head that lingers a bit. Smell is lemon, grass and maybe some pepper. Flavor echoes the same - it is light yet with body and refreshing. With the spicing of this beer it borders a Saison flavor with a heavy dose of citrus."

"Poured into a pint glass, its party cloudy with mild carbonation and is a beautiful blonde color, think of the morning sun shining through a wheat field. Its topped off with a nice thick white head, and thins out into a layer of uniformed bubbles corralled by mild lacing. Spices like coriander, orange zest, mild pepper corn and something else I can’t put my finger on all envelope your tongue as you drink. It’s light bodied throughout, this beer is very smooth and you can taste some apple, wheat, orange zest as it hits the sides and back of your mouth, its aftertaste is filled with a mild pepper corn flavor and it’s slightly bitter overall."

"Avery White Rascal Belgian White: Wow, very good Belgian whit beer from Avery! I am a whit beer fan, but great ones are hard to find in the US. The White Rascal is a beautiful pour, with a striking straw yellow color and pure white head that does lace. Not perfectly clear, but I would not call it hazy either. The aroma has loads of citrus. The flavor has a balanced blend of citrus and honey. I am not a big fan of spices in beer, but the coriander blends well in this brew. Avery produces a top shelf bomber series, and their mainstream products are above average. The White Rascal is another example of an above average product."
"O- Very nice ... More Hefe than necessary than very enjoyable."
"O-Decent Belgian Wit; light, funky, tasty. Very easy to drink a lot of these on a hot summer day."

"Overall - Nice light citrus beer. I do like this one just needs some more smells to make it hit."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is much like the smell; fruit, yeast, malt and a hit of hoppiness to balance the sweetness. It may not be the prototypical witbier, but I prefer the full, complex flavor of this version to it's more sedate brethren."
"Overall: A decent witbier, but it does not separate itself from other examples of the style. I would definitely drink it again, but probably not seek it out."

"12oz can. Pours a pale golden yellow with a large lasting fluffy white head. Aroma and Taste of sweet citrus, lemon, some banana, grassy hay , light malt and slightly tart flavor with some bitter notes. Light body and crisp mouth feel on the palate with some good carbonation. Finish is light malt,belgian yeast sweet citrus,a bit of zesty lemon and some banana flavor along with some light tartness and bitter notes on the end for balance. Overall a good, crisp and nicely balanced ale"

"Pretty solid Belgian White - more white than Beligian. Pours a yellowish with a thin white had that dissipates quickly. Brew retains some carb bubbling however. Smell is diominated by Belgian spices - coriander and some ginger. Tastes matches the nose with a well balanced wheat backbone. Solid brew. Nothing special, easy to drink."
"overall: A very good spring time witbier with Belgian touch. I'm going to like touring through Avery's beers."

"Thick creamy mouthfeel. Banana nut muffin taste through out with a spicy coriander and clove bite on the finish. Hops present just enough to cut everything to make for a clean finish. Noticeable yeast presence but its quite nice. Tasty brew available in cans and highly drinkable. I'm into it."

"a nice belgian white, heavy on the flowery yeast notes. pours a cloudy pale straw color with almost no head. smelld like belgian yeast and wheat malt. flavor is yeasty first, with a fruity sort of hop middle, and a crisp belgian finish. feel is nice, but not as bubbly as i want it to be. i dont know, the yeast is the star here, and its down easy, but i like a lot of other avery beers a whole lot more. thats said, its a damn good american belgian wit. no complaints really"
""
""
""

"Pours a cloudy and lightly chunky gold color, good cap of frothy white head, decent retention and lacing. Scent blends citrus rind and tangy wheat, splash of watery fruit and black pepper. Straight forward taste... citrus rind, watery fruit, tangy wheat, floral taste and black pepper. Medium bodied, lightly creamy and slight prickly carbonation. A nice wit, but not one of the classics of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy light orange with an off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of wheat, spices, yeast, and a slightly chalky aroma. Taste is of wheat and yeast with a pretty strong spice profile on the finish. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a decently crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but nothing too great."

"From a can (I know, heresy) obtained from a 6 pack at QFC in University Village near UW campus. Aroma is very sweet. Banana, citrus, gum, and very delicate. Very inviting a pleasant. Appears bright, but translucent. If you mixed orange juice with pineapple juice, I feel like that’s what this looks like. One to two fingers of white head. Tastes like sweet, fruity citrus. Pineapple, banana, coconut, plenty of other tropical fruits. It’s not overly citrusy or carbonated, it really has an incredible balance. It might be too sweet for the average beer drinker, but it’s just right for me. Palate has a perfect balance as well. Good carbonation, no bad residual flavors, goes down smooth. I can’t think of anything else I would ask for. Overall, this is one of the few beers that I feel comfortable buying a sixer of. It seems like no matter what mood I am in, I could be in the mood for this. This beer is what turned me on to Avery, and now I know I won’t go wrong with picking up any of their high brow stuff."

"An above average witbier. It had decent lacing. Although I thought it was too clear for what I expect out of a witbier. Smell and taste were good. Bottles was good but its was better on tap at the Avery Brewing Tasting Event at the Liberty Street Tavern. I would get this again but it would be my third choice behind Allagash White and St. Bernardus Witbier."

"Humongous white head over yellow beer that's mostly clear but slightly hazy. Good lacing on the way down. Smells great - spices, coriander I think. The taste is also good, very smooth wheat beer flavor with spices. Easy drinking, a good session beer. The only real problem I have with this beer is the mouthfeel, which is really, really thin and watery. Not as good as Hoegaarden but pretty good."

"Nice finger of head,cloudy hazy typical witbier color.The lacing is as I`ve never seen before,it doesn`t disappear.I got a bit of a sinus thing going on so my smell isn`t up to snuff for now.Has a bit more bite than most wits,maybe a tad more Coriander notes also. A good a brew overall though."
"O - A nice belgian white. Could be a bit more complex in the flavor."
"A very straight forward Belgian style wit. Pretty good, nothing outrageous. Probably a good stepping stone for someone who drinks Blue Moon or Shock Top."
"I let this warm a bit out of the fridge. Poured with a huge, fluffy, frothy, foamy, sudsy, off white head that was short lived and some clingy lace. Color is a very slightly hazy amber with no bubble trails. Aroma is mainly yeast with some malt, fruit, spice, bread dough. Flavor is fruit, malt, a little spice, and some tang, but not sure where from. Body is ok and carbonation seems a bit light. Finish is estery, like flavor and average length. Ok beer, nothing special."
"O- I may have just got a funky smelling beer, and I'm willing to try it again because of the positives on all the other fronts."
"O: This beer is a mixed bag. It looks good, and the heavier mouthfeel and higher alcohol content help it to stand out from a rapidly growing crowd. The ho-hum flavor profile and unimpressive aroma, though, make it a beer that I will not seek out regularly. Not bad, but not great either."
"Overall - This is one of my favorite beers."
"Medium bodied, with good carbonation. VERY, very drinkable. It was actually pretty complex for a witbier, and I felt it had a lot to offer, but still, it wasn't a big standout beer for me during a week of 126 beer tastings. Good, but not amazing."
"Overall- I feel this would be a great beer if Avery would tone down the amount of coriander they add to this brew."
"Pours a pale yellow color with a frothy white two finger head. Good lacing on my snifter glass. Very cloudy in appearance. Nose is corriander, wheat, malt, pepper- pretty typical for this style. Nice and crisp smelling beer, and very balanced. Taste is the same profile, although, I'd like just a tad more malt in there. Feel is medium for the style w/ a nice smooth malty finish. Malt and spices last well into the aftertaste. Overall, this is a good Witbier- definitely worth checking out. Not the best I've had, but still solid."
"4.0 D: I enjoyed this a good bit, but admittedly it's hard to disappoint me with a witbier. Solid all around."
"O- I realize most of my reviews tend to be on larger beers, but i do like sessionables as well. I might not seek this out again because while it is light and drinkable, there isn't necessarily anything different about it; nothing drawing me back towards buying it. Light yeastyness, a touch of light bread malt, some grassy hops, and thats about it. Best described as a lighter hefeweizen. Recommended for your sister in law who only drinks Blue Moon. Throw a lemon in there for her."
"I occasionally have this on tap at Avery but only on the warmest days."
"O- Pretty much everything I look for in a witbier."
"This taste is something different for me, but it's definitely better in a good way. This could easily be a drink that I could knock a few back, not too heavy and it has enough flavor that it's better than a light beer. Even though this beer was solid I'm still in no rush to drink another one though."
"One of the better American takes on a style that usually is over flavored and not refreshing. This one, though, is tastefully designed and very refreshing. Highly recommended."
"Overall I thought that this was a pretty damn good Witbier and so far it is the best one I have had. I find most beers in the style have a 50/50 mix of orange zest and spices but with this beer the oranges taste more fresh and juicy then zesty and they outweighed the spices, I liked the this combination it was pretty different from most Witbiers and pretty tasty. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma, the fresh oranges really stuck out and it wasn't overly spicy. What I liked least about this beer was the appearance, the color could have been brighter with much better head and retention but that isn't that big of a deal. This beer had great drinkability and I could see myself enjoying a couple of these on the disc golf course. I will for sure buy this beer again and I would recommend this beer to any Witbier fan. This was my first beer from Avery and it made for a good first impression, I will be on the look out for more of their beer."
"O: Not a great beer, but pretty good. It's a nice change from some of the more common styles of beer. A little heavy on the orange/fruitiness for me to drink too often, but worth checking out."
"A flavorful and wonderfully aromatic witbier."
"O - A damn good light belgian pale ale. I will buy this again"
"Thought this was too heavily hopped. Otherwise, not bad flavors, but this style doesn’t really benefit from this much bitterness in my opinion."
"Overall it's a nice witbier, and great that it's in a can."
"Overall Impression- This is much more refreshing and interesting than I've had before! Has a good orange smell and taste, and has a good finish. Will be getting more of these for float trips!"
"Over all, it's not a bad beer. It's decent, but it's not especially unique or exciting that sticks out the next time anybody ask me for recommendations regarding the witbier style."
"Poured a cloudy straw-yellow with a nice white head that retained and laced well. Bready yeast on the nose, a bit funky, with notes of grass and citrus zest. Similar taste, yeasty, bready, wet grass, some pear and lemon. Crisp, appropriately carbonated, light-bodied, and quite drinkable for the style."
"An alright Wit, but not upper tier by any means, still great to see another choice in canned beer though"
"Drinkability: My first Belgian from a can and an excellent one. I instinctively swirled the last bit looking for some yeast sediment and found none, but other than that, not much difference between this and a bottle."
"Overall - there are a lot of Witbiers available in cans these days and this is definitely one of the best. I like it more than Hoegaarden personally (and yes, even Hoegaarden comes in cans over in Belgium)."
"Not too bad of a beer. It was a much better experience than the Salvation. I would like to try some more Avery’s."
"O: Probably wouldn't have again, but rather recommended. It's alright, and drinkable."
"O - A very awesome brew, but lacks flavor depth."
"This went down easy enough, could easily go for a few more. Im always checking out Avery's smaller beers as they are spot on when fresh."
"Na Zdravje!"
"D - Very good rendition of a wit, and a neat looking can to boot. Most certainly worth your hard earned dollar."
"o - overall a good witbier, if you like orange. this beer might as well be called orange-aide."
"Before tucking into the food, I poured a glass - cloudy gold with a substantial head and sticky lacing coating the pint glass along with a definite lemony aroma. First draught: lots of citrus and yeast. There's a creamy smoothness to this beer that follows the initial taste blast. Next time I'll try it solo and update here."
"D ~ Overall, I would probably order this one on Tap with Pizza if I were out of state, but I wouldn't seek it out. OK's distro of Avery is gone, though, so I am glad that my pops sent one for me to try."
"D - Not much to write home about, but nice on a hot summer day."
"Overall this was an okay beer"
"Overall- very flavorful wit. Worthy."
"Poured from the tap a hazy lemon yellow with a tight active white head that disapated slowly and laced nicely through the beer. Smell is banana and clove some spice and a bit of wheat malt. Taste is bright sweet with banana and clove and some corriander very refreshing taste. Mouthfeel is medium with a nice constant feed of carbonation keeping the beer crisp. Overall a very enjoyable beer brewe in the style of the whitbier."
"Notes: This one is not too bad a decent brew all the way around. Cheers."
"-Cheers"
"$1.79 single bottle at Total Wine & More."
"M: Very easy to drink. Light and crisp. Very drinkable brew."
"Appearance is a cloudy yellow tone with a thin white head. It smells of orange, coriander, spices including nutmeg. The taste of this wit has more citrus, some wheat, along with yeast on low key level. Body is light with a crisp texture. Overall, an easy drinking and refreshing beer, particularly for the summer season."
"T: This wasn't a bad wit by any means, but I was expecting a bit more. The flavor was a little too heavy and sweet and the mouthfeel felt a little bogged down. A lot of orange flavor and spice, but it lacked the light body and subtle flavors that really great wits have."
"Overall: Took this beer for tube floating trip down the river today. The convience of canned beer in the outdoors was ideal here, I choose this beer because I wanted a session beer for a hot day and I really did not want to drink any BMC beers and it was not practical to bring lots of bottles to the river. Avery is a great brewery and the canned craft beers was a pretty limited selection were I was shopping at for this trip. This was my best option I had, but I was pleasantly surprised. The BMC crowd had a pretty positive opinion on this beer, might have even converted a few BMC lovers into the world of craft beer today. The beer is fairly spicy, but the light body helps keep the spiciness under control."
"O - A very refreshing beer that is true to style. Maybe doesn't stand out, but certianly does not disappoint either."
"D- A pretty good wit, not quite as good as Allagash but a bit better than Hoegaarden, this is one I could have a couple of but probably won't go out of my way to get."
"Overall: An average to slightly above average witbier that hits the spot on a hot night. This one drinks easy, but unless I am in the mood for a witbier, I would not go out of my way for it."
"M. Like a loose girl, it goes down easy. Medium bodied, slight drying noticed, with a hint of stickiness. Well carbonated to keep her flowing."
"Light mouthfeel and very drinkable. One of the better Avery beers I've had. If you like this style, I recommend this one for sure."
"Pours a bright almost electric straw like color with a tight half finger stark white head which gives way to nothing and a slight soapy lace. The aroma is of lemons and a belgium candy yeast strain. The smell is very bubblegum like in nature. The taste is close to the nose, there is a nice bubble gum belgian yeast strain taste that starts followed up by some lemonzest and then a slight hop bitterness at the end. The mouthfeel is well carbonated and slightly thin. Overall it is a solid wit. The candy yeast strain gives it a slightly different flavor than others in the class. The flavor is smooth and not medicinal like some in the glass can be."
"Overall: I really like this beer. It reminds me of being in Belgium and sampling the local fair. If you have not tried it I recommend it"
"This a solid witbier with all the typical parts. It has a summery refreshing flavor with spices like coriander and a little bit of pepper. It has lemon and orange citrus notes, and most important, that yeasty character that is so important to a good wit. The aroma is underwhelming considering the flavor, but the look and feel edge above the average. Good beer for lounging on a nice day."
"Pretty good. Very refreshing summer offering."
"D: Very drinkable. This is my new favorite wit. Less tart and dry than Allagash. I'll stock this when I see it on sale as a great summer beer."
"Pours a very hazy lemon-water color with a finger of white head. Sticky bubbles of lacing throughout. The nose is full of spices. Cardamon and clove the most. The taste is an amplified veraion of the nose. The spices create a smooth banana flavor that has the clove and cream taste afterwards. Great lingering aftertaste that leaves nothing behind. Smooth, medium-bodied feel that coats the palate. Overall, this is one of the better canned beers ive had. I'm impressed, very drinkable."
"First CANundrum - how to agitate the yeast into suspension. I went with a combination of rolling the CAN back and forth on the counter, followed by a hand-held back and forth inversion ala a paint mixer. The Crack did not release a gusher, but I was ready if it had. I repeatedly interrupted the Glug to CANtinue to agitate the yeast into suspension. I was met with a finger of very rocky, bone-white head with moderate retention as a result. Color was a cloudy, hazy lemon-yellow, like fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice and even some floaties for good measure. Nose was redolent with spices, the coriander just reaching up to tweak my nose, followed by the zest of the orange peel, then the mustiness of the yeast. I recently polished off some Blue Moon in a CAN that had been hanging around, but this beer puts that one to shame! Mouthfeel was a tad thin, but the riotous taste of the spice, the citrus and the yeast was memorable. I am still not a big fan of the style, but I know a good one when I taste it. Finish was dry and refreshing. I'd put some in the cooler as long as people agree not to put fruit in it!"
"Very smooth, refreshing, and easy-drinking without being too one-dimensional."
"O - Fairly laid back, fruity type of refreshing summer cooler. It is a little thin on the palate and could've been a bit more spicy but otherwise is a nice drop with enough substance to maintain your interest."
"The body is light & overall it's a pretty refreshing beer for a hot day. True to the style & has a welcomed place at any backyard BBQ. Not the most impressive of the style but a pretty good representation at that. I would like to have tasted some more play b/w the different flavors but I'd pick this up again. Drinkability is high due to the ABV & light body. Prosit!"
"O - not really enough taste or body to feel like I'm drinking beer, more like lemon water"
"Not a bad beer by any means. But it just didn't have anything that would wow me. Just another witbier is all."
"Overall, this isn't the best example of the style out there, but at around $10 for a six pack, you can't really go wrong. Not a groundbreaking beer, but an outstanding value."
"The beers that most closely resembles the White Rascal is Hoegarden. This beer poured light colored with almost zero head. It was a little more zippy/had more zest than other beers. It was like it was almost due to the carbonation but I think it was the taste - so that was interesting. Mouthfeel was poor."
"Overall: A very good take on a Witbier from Avery."
"This pours banana colored, with light fizzy head. The smells is the expected yeast and citrus. I really like how crisp and tart this brew is. It reminds me of Hoegaarden but much better. It has a medium to light body that is zesty and refreshing. This is a great beer for the style because it lacks the over-soapiness that Belgium beers often have."
"This was a decent enough Witbier I suppose but it never did find the right balance of sweetness and spice for me and just had an overall thickness to the feel that cut back on the drinkability of this."
"Just had three of these from the can at Pizza Peel. Great summer brew. Light, airy and thirst quenching. Poured can into pint glass. Nice color and had the smell of corriander and a bit of orange peel. Really good on both accounts. The taste was really good given that it was a 5.6% Wit. Most wits are around 4.8-5%. Nice balance and good mouthfeel. Overall, this beer is a great summer gulper. High, high drinkability. Highly recommend."
"Overall it's not a bad beer but I can ascertain there's better wits out there. However it does have a couple of interesting things to it somewhere."
"Bonus points for the sweet label!"
"Taste-Spices, clove coriander, orange zest. Very refreshing and flavorfull. Easily ""poundable"" on a hot summer's day. Good value and portability in can package."
"Decent beer, not the best ever but satisfying and refreshing."
"O: This isn't a groundbreaking beer, but it is refreshing and one that I wouldn't mind keeping on hand in the future."
"(12oz bottle). Pours hazy yellow with minimal white head. Hardly any carbonation bubbles. Coriander and orange dominate the aroma along with some wheat and some peppercorn. Taste is sweet malt with citrus and spice from the coriander. Medium bodied with with an oily texture. Finish is a bit spicy and somewhat bitter. A very nice witbier."
"O: I enjoy the flavor profile and nose of this beer, but the carbonation and spice goes a bit too far in drying out the tongue for my taste."
"The aroma was full of grain and slight spices. Some small fruit notes, pears mainly, with a touch of apple. But this hay like spice kept everything going. Rich notes of grass and hay opened it up, and melded seemlessly into a pear driven fruity yeast body. Very intresting and quite complex, but then the smack of the spice hit you and it was all over. Really intense here as the almost pepper like notes bounced all over the tongue and really just put on a great show. Smooth as silk, the letdown in the finish was that it was just a tad thin and flat and that really seemed to just let it fade away all too quickly."
"The feel of this beer is light to medium and it a really nice drinker. It goes down easy and is a good summer beer as the temps start to rise."
"M: Light-bodied, small carbonation, not too much depth/complexity. Still refreshing, great summer hot day drink."
"The mouthfeel is light with carbonation being above average. Overall it was a decent and refreshing beer, but not an outstanding beer of the style."
"Another little can love it anyway the brew pours an impressive cloudy golden yellow hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind a frothy two finger head and clingy lacing everywhere,the smell is very spicey basically corriander and orange peel with a hint of salami and herbal hops,it has a medium bodied well carbonated mouthfeel that has tastes of salami,belgian yeasty bread,corriander,orange peel,a touch of oregano and finished with a herbal hoppy,citrus zest dry finish and overall its quite a drinkable witbier thats made for more than one off even if your not the biggest fan of witbiers as it is quite subdued and i must say this brewery has eased my mind about quality being limited to bottles as their cans still contain quality flavours cheers."
"Heavy bodied for the style with decent carbonation. The carbonation is almost prickly when you let this beer sit in your mouth. It is easily drinkable but not necessarily the thirst-quencher many would expect from this style."
"Quite flavorful, and an admirable job on this Belgian-style wit. Tasty and refreshing."
"D: Overall its a good beer, particularly in a style that is hard to please with."
"Very nice easily quaff-able well balanced wit. Slightly yeasty and again big on the orange, tangerine, citrus quality throughout. Corriander and white pepper on the middle with belgian yeast and spice and floral hops on the finish. Soft and creamy from the wheat and just a nice beer on a warm day. Love the cans."
"D- Not a bad beer to drink, but it simply leaves you wanting more of the flavors that should be in a witbier."
"Notes: Nice witbier, maybe nothing outstanding but it hits the style pretty well and it is nicely recommendable. Glad to see it in cans, although ironically one got punctured and spilled all over the backpack, luckily it was an hermetic comparment. I guess it is just a random fluke... First time it happened though."
"D: Very high, quite a good beer!"
"The CPJ"
"O: easy drinking beer, soft flavors, nothing too out there and would be a good intro into craft IMO"
"M - Light body but doesn't have as much carbonation as the appear would lead one to believe. Finishes sweet on the palate but the aftertaste of spicy oranges fades rather quickly. Crisp, clean, and refreshing."
"Pours a hazy pale golden color with vivid white head. Nose has plenty of citrus, maybe orangey coriander and some lemon peel. Candied wheat character comes across right away on the palate with some contrasting sweet 'n sour flavors going on into the finish. Finish is moderately long with some wheaty components lingering. Easy drinking, refreshing, and outstanding with breakfast that has eggs and cheese in it."
"Overall-So if I'm comparing this to many IPAs that I enjoy I would much rather drink the IPAs, but for the style, I really like this beer. I've had nearly everything avery offers and never tried their White Rascal. Excellent hot summer day beer, and a great way to try and lure in your significant other to craft beers. Definitely will purchase this again, great session beer as well."
"O: Not bad overall. I'd drink it again on a hot and thirsty day. It has some flavor spice, not much bitterness on the aftertaste, and is safe enough to have more than one (a drinker, not a sipper). A good beer to introduce a non-craft beer drinker into the realm. Would have appeal to mass market drinkers and crafters."
"Overall good, very drinkable, not very complex, but better tasting than a lot of other witbiers out there"
"A nice medium body and smooth carbonation make for a drinkable beer in terms of mouthfeel. I can't complain about the mouthfeel, really. Too bad it doesn't make up for the lack of achievement elsewhere. I give it points for the fennel seed originality but this is overall a below-average to average witbier. I won't be ordering this one again."
"O: Overall I really like this beer. It is a little more manly tasting than your average witbier, which I appreciate! I would definitely pick this up in lieu of some more expensive witbiers out there to share with the GF who likes the style a lot. Better than expected..."
"Served on-tap at the La Jolla Brewhouse in CA. The beer was poured in a pint glass, and it was a yellowish coloring that almost seemed to have a green tint to it. The beer was hazy and unfiltered, and it had a white, frothy head on it. Spicy nutmeg aroma, with clove and citrus notes, as well. Creamy body with smooth flavors of citrus and spice. Herb highlights throughout the beer as well, with hints of parsley and basil (?). Tart from the citrus, with a clean finish and a spicy aftertaste."
"On tap at a beer festival poured into a sampler glass. From notes: Pours golden and slightly hazy with a little white head (it does keep a good lacing going). Nose is fairly strong and dominated by bitter citrus, coriander, and belgian yeast. Flavor is a good balanced witbier with orange peel, spice, a medium-big malt, low hops, and a little yeast all coming through without a distinct front or backside to the flavor. Very similar to Hoegaarden but a little thinner on the palate."
"The palate is interesting. It is spicier than many wits, especially when cold. As it warms a nice orange fruit quality comes forward a little more. It goes down easily, the combo of spiceness and fruitness make it fairly refreshing while it also the little bit of slickness makes it more smooth than crisp."
"Light yellow cloudy beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is orange.coriander and wheat.Taste is pretty much the same.It goes down pretty easy.Overall it is amazingly average,it's just like the hundreds of other witbiers out there.I wouldn't recommend and I doubt I would ever buy this again."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"This beer also has great drinkability."
"D/m: Crisp and drinkable. Has some weight while maintaining a very good profile. Very refreshing."
"This is a pretty good beer. Haven't had many of this style, so I probably can't review it as well as some. It has a nice light fruity taste, and good mouth feel. The color is a beautiful hazy white. This is an easy drinking beer, and I would definitely buy it again. Yes, a whole six pack! Avery has good beers overall. I tried a nice IPA of theirs, and I think a brown ale."
"Quite a bright happy beer with a whimsical quality which makes it good for what it is. Like I said additional carbonation would've been nice or more Belgian yeast quality in the nose."
"D-- very drinkable with an ok + taste"
"http://www.facebook.com/KAJIIsBeerReviews"
"D: Solid Witbier, not my fav, but it's still pretty good. Don't go out of your way for this, but a fine session and summer beer."
"The appearance was that of a white beer on the clear side. Slight cloudiness and minimal sediment. Whatever head came from the poor quickly disappeared. It has a strong citrus taste with hops and a light finish of bitterness. It is a good beer for the price and is drinkable, especially with food. I had it with chicken, corn, and sourdough bread and it paired nicely."
"A decent beer that my fond memories of tasting at the Avery tap room now seem overblown. After two reviews (bottle and can), I believe this is a good brew, but nothing extraordinary to my palate."
"It was not a great beer but it was very good."
"Appears a clouded apricot golden orange hue with haziness galore, I'd call this unfiltered. Fine intricate lacing left as the bright white head dwindles. Aroma has orange peel citrus fruit, clove, with hints of coriander and even a touch of tropical fruit this is very nice witbier. Flavor spiced with citrus peel, coriander, hints of clove, with a refreshing yeast spiciness, more tropical fruits hints of chammomile. Mouthfeel is light bodied sturdy effervescent carbonation carries the beer pretty well. Drinkability was effortless the right type of beer to drain for sure, enjoyable and approachable to all. I'm surprised I've nevere reviewed this beer, it's one that I've tasted multiple times over the years."
"This is a very light styled beer and great for hot summer days."
"One finger white head. Pale, cloudy strraw body. Sweet banana and orange smell. Bitter with noticable alcohol. Like biting into a lime-orange hybrid. Reminiscent of wine. Smooth mouthfeel with a little bit of a bite. I'd drink again, but any place you're likely to find this stuff might have a better witbier so it's easy to pass this one up."
"This was the first beer that I have almost poured out. It was not bad like a BMC, those having no flavor whatsoever, but a bad flavor profile. I was very disappointing with the taste. Too much of a spice flavor for me. Nice beer Avery Brewing Co."
"Lacks a lot of the character that make a good witbier-the orange in the flavor combined with an alcohol undertone (which shouldn't be there) comes off almost like flavored vodka. I love Avery, but this one just isn't up to snuff."
"The lacing is made up of very pretty and uniform bubbles of medium size. Avery makes good things and this is the first can I have tried from them. I would buy again."
"D - Like most beers like this drinkability is good but the cheapest found is 10.99 a sixer and thats a pretty good price. Would consider if getting something light."
"D: The aroma was so promising, but overall this beer is shooting for typical and falls just shy of that."
"Fairly standard aromas - clove, yeast, coriander, wheat, and lemon are the most noticeable. More of the citrus and wheat on the tongue than the nose. Light bodied, nice amount of carbonation, and refreshing. I wouldn't mind drinking a couple of these in a hot summer day."
"D: I would not turn one of these down, but at the same time I don't think I'll be buying another six pack."
"A hazy pale yellow in color with a thin white head. Impressive lacing that sticks. Smells of yeast phenols. Taste is light sugary bread up front, with a nice yeast profile in the middle, and an earthy finish. Mouthfeel is pretty good, low carbonation. Very good drinkability, light and refreshing."
"Future outlook: Nothing to get my pulse racing, but plenty enjoyable. Not one to seek out, but not one to sneer at if I happen to find in my glass again."
"Peace."
" D- The yeast, citrus and spice qualities are all supported by a nice pale malt base. There is lots of character and it is very drinkable with the bottle being way to small."
"Drinkability: Tastes so good, I could drink it all day."
"For a light bodied beer this is pretty good, very drinkable, theres just just not that much to it."
"D- one of the spicier wits ive tried. a little over spiced for my liking. the six pack i bought was well received by my non beer loving family."
"d - highly drinkable and a good wit."
"M/D: A decent witbier. Hits all the style notes perfectly, but nothing really stands out. Not the best out there, but worth the $9.99 a six pack."
"Pale yellow with lots of head. Almost whit in appearance. Smells of faint hops and wheat wheat wheat. Tastes light and wheat heavy with a bit of hops. Very drinkable But really nothing special. A bit thin for my liking but overall decent considering ite from Avery"
"Avery Brewing Company--White Rascal Belgian-Style White Ale--Ale Brewed With Spices--2011 12 oz. Bottle. 5.60% ABV. 10 IBU's. (4.0 / 5.0) Wit. Dense lasting lacy 1/2 "" bright white head. Cloudy vibrant lemon yellow color. Light tight sediment. Aromatic coriander lemon orange peel mild banana citrus front. Juicy refreshing rich well balanced spicy Wit mild citrus fruit crisp body. Clean mild citrus refreshing end. Nicely done. Rich spice flavor. Sampled 2/20/2011. Purchased for $6.99 at The Ballard Market, Seattle	2/20/2011."
"A good offering from Avery."
"Drink- Not too bad for a run of the mill Wit."
"Decent take on the style, just not the best take on it."
"D- Refreshing, clean, crisp and dry. Slightly creamy while in the mouth, but dry finish. Typical of this style. Clove is on the strong side for such a watery beer. Its easy enough to drink with a meal."
"DB- A pleasant surprise. Witbier, or any Belgian with similar yeast flavor, is not my first choice but I am enjoying this one. I guess the relatively relaxed (or balanced) yeast and spice makes this one refreshing and drinkable."
"Nice, crisp body and easy drinkability. Not an outstanding wit, but nicely balanced and goes down well."
"It is definitely worth a try."
"This is an easy drink. I do recommend this brew to anyone who likes the style. As I said above, there are better wits out there, but this one has a bit of a identity of its own. Its very refreshing. I wouldn't turn one down."
"The light yellow color reminds me of lemonade. A light weight head that is basically white sat on top of this beer for a very short time. There is a little citrus in the nose and oranges. I get too much yeast like notes and some cloves as well. It is very refreshing and light without losing the mouth feel. It still has a creamy feeling. The finish is a little rough. The beer has a dry feeling with plenty of clove sticking to the back of your tongue. I'm not a fan of the clove but I really enjoyed this beer. Perfect for an Oklahoma summer day."
"This witbier pours a very hazy orange with a white head that fades quickly and leaves a little lacing. Its smells yeasty, with spices of coriander and some orange zest. The light bodied beer brings te flavor of orange peel, yeast, light malt, with spices. This is an average at best wheat beer."
"Drink: White Rascal was enjoyed during a mini wit tasting, and stood out in its mediocrity. A very average witbier."
"The body was nice and full for a wit. That paired with crisp carbonation leaves us with a full-flavored easy drinking wheat, with no sacrifices."
"Pours a pale apricot orange with a nice, billowing white head and a good amount of lace rings as it goes down the glass. Nose brings forward some citrus and wheat along with a hint of spice. Spice comes out more in the flavor, which still brings mostly a wheaty sweetness and a bit of orange and citrus. Feel is a bit thick and starts to feel almost like a shake. Drinks alright, but not my favorite representation of the style."
"D: This is not what I look for in a witbier. Too much like a crappy brewpub ""hefeweizen"" and just watery."
"Pours a light clear gold with a good 2-finger head resting comfortably on top. Retention was fair. Left some light lace. Nose full of pineapple, cut grass, and white pepper. Body was crisp and mildly effervescent, as the style goes. Nice tart citrus notes. Big yeasty presence, earthy vegetation, lemon finish. Great refreshing beer. High drinkability in my book. Not the best beer out there, but not one I would ever turn down. Good stuff."
"D-Good drinkability and a true representation of the style but nothing spectacular."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and is rather refreshing, although not quite as thirst quenching as some of the other types of witbiers that are available."
"I think this had been sitting on the shelf for awhile."
"Only comment here is that I don't think it needed coriander, and could have been more clean without it. Natural tastes in this style already lean in that direction, doesn't really need the help, in my humble opinion."
"Pours cloudy yellow with white dissipating head. Aroma of wheat, floral notes, some lemon zest. Spices, wheat, floral notes, slight orange notes, banana esters, and vanilla. Spritzy carbonation in a light bodied beer. A castrated devil. No aggression, no character."
"A friend of mine took a sip and loved it, said he thought it was a good flavorful wheat."
"Pretty good job overall."
"I like this one a lot. What I don't get is orange. I've had so much orange that I can dig some lemon once in a while, especially when it is from the yeast (is it? I'll assume it is). I wonder if they brew it with lemon peel or is it just good yeast?"
"M- Nice mellow smooth body. It finishes very silky smooth."
"Overall: A nice Witbier. Again, not as smooth as I usually like my beers. I like how light and simple it is, which does make it easy to drink in that regard. Highly recommended compared to other Witbiers I've tried."
"I had a sixteen ounce pour of this at Amsterdam Ale House in Manhattan's upper west side. I'm a huge fan of this brewery but I'm not the biggest fan of Witbier. Overall this was a decent beer but, because I don't love Witbier, I'll probably not have it again too soon but it is a good example of the style if you like it."
"A very clean wit with solid flavors. A tiny bit watered down but still a very refreshing brew. Nice spice profile."
"D - Refreshing and easy to drink, with plenty of depth for its size. Definitely worth a try."
"D: I like this for an afternoon drink or for a party. Not an exceptional beer, but very easy to drink due to the simplicity of it."
"Living in CO I have been drinking this beer for years, but had it last night and decided to review it. Have to say it was the best bottle I have ever had. Maybe the tweaked the recipe, but it just tasted much more vibrant. Would guess it was just really fresh. I did drink it in boulder..."
"D - This is a decent witbier. The beer lacks some spice complexity however and the malt seems to lack the raw wheat character typical of the style. Technically it's not really flawed but lacks interest. Still, it's good on a hot day like this one."
"Very drinkable, a composite of decent to good parts make for a refreshing and crisp brew."
"D - What a great hot day beer. I'd nab this over any of the mass produced Wits any day."
"drinkability: A nice summer brew. The spiciness is subdued but keeps it from being a ""quaffer""."
"All in all not a bad beer, but not a great beer either."
"D- this is just okay, I sure wouldn't pay money for it again. it was little taste and no muscle"
"The very first thing you will notice when you crack open a White Rascal is the odd aroma. This beer is ""ale brewed with spices"" according to the label.. but what spices? The taste is very bitter, like someone mixed in dill or paprika, or some other spice that does not really belong in a beer. Its a shame because Avry brewing Co is usually one of my favorite breweries and I must admit I am disappointed in this brew because I really wanted to like it. Still not as bad as an MGD though."
"D - Pretty drinkable. Not very exciting, however, as there a lot better witts out there."
"A very pale yellow color pour with a medium sized lasting head , lively carbonation . Aroma of coriander and orange peel as promised with some peppery spice and wheat notes .Flavor is spicy ,lots of coriander , peppery , with some lemon and orange ,tangy wheat and just a hint of babana , light bitterness . oily mouthfeel, medium body, quite drinkable pretty good ."
"D = I've always like wheat beers. I find them (generally) to be extremely drinkable, and this is no exception. The light character and refreshing taste make this a great beer to toss in the cooler on a very hot day. This is on my ""buy again"" list for sure."
"D: Easy to drink. a really good beer. i would love to buy a six pack of this."
"Mouthfeel is light and has a crisp, fizzy amount of carbonation."
"An easy drinker, just a hair behind the belgians. Needs a touch more intensity to be great -- so, very good. Terrific hot weather/summer beer. Very decent domestic product."
"It has that nice cloudy pale golden color and a clove/yeasty aroma. But its not an overspiced wit. It has a nice clean wheat flavor, that lends itself to having several. While there is a hint of clove and banana, its in the back and you just get a nice wheat kick. very good mouthfeel also lends to the drinkibility."
"Taking a drink, this beer has a very smooth mouth feel. The spice notes are rather subdued, letting the wheat to shine through. It's an easy drinking beer, especially on a summer day."
"d- it's not the highest quality Wit but it's probably damn near the smoothest. If it were a little tastier it would be a great affordable option for an easy drinking Belgian-style ale. either way it will likely be purchased again...especially if I ever see it in a can."
"D: Easy drinking, and a decent representation of the style."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink, low ABV and pairs well with flavorful foods. This would be an easy beer to session with, especially on a hot summer day."
"In terms of Belgian-wheat ales I would compare this to Blue Moon...with a little more spice. As far a wheat ales go, it's alright, but not the best I've had."
"M/D - Pretty wheaty brew not big on this one, pretty easy to drink but the wheat taste wasn't for me"
"The mouth is slick with lower than expected carbonation. It was an enjoyable change of pace beer for me."
"D: Refreshing for a sunny afternoon relaxing. I would drink 1 or 2."
"Overall: A very good example of the style. Comes much closer to a true Belgian Witbier than many other American attempts."
"It's a pretty average wit, but it's drinkable as the style almost automatically implies. Not a huge amount to recommend it, but it's refreshing and quaffable enough. Just remember there are much better examples."
"D- Very drinkable, need to get more soon!"
"This beer is very well composed. Its light flavour and body make it a great summer, outside, hangin out by the pool or latenight fire beer. I'd reccomend it."
"Pours a cloudy, pale yellow color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of slight hops, coriander, sweet malt, and slight orange peel. Fits the style of a Witbier. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, citrus, slight sweet malt, and slight hops. Overall, a good blend, but body is a little weak."
"Looks great with some wispy yeast swirling around the pale straw colored body. A little more haze would have been ideal. Good head and lacing. Smells a little too one dimensional on the banana front. Not getting much else except some alcohol as it warms. The taste is also dominated by the banana flavor, but there is a nice touch of clove in the finish. A bit soapy at times, though it feels nice going down. Better than your average white."
"Notes: Nothing outstanding, but a nice witbier."
"Pours a pale straw yellow color in the glass, with a nice collar of bright white foam. Very yeasty aroma, with wheat, spice and some lemon. A little tart on the palate, followed by citrus, wheat and a little malt sweetness. A good spring/summertime drinker. Looking forward to this one in cans."
"I definitely enjoyed this wheat beer. It was a much more drinkable beer than some of the meals in bottles i have had to guzzle down. It had a great overall flavor and was great just out of the bottle. Good color, and no terrible acidity or bite after each gulp. I can not wait to dive into some more of this already impressive line of Avery Brewing beers."
"I would recommend this to Witbier lovers."
"D: An easy drinking witbier but not a ton of flavor or great character to go back to again and again. Would be good on a hot day or paired with a dry, spicy dish, but nothing too special."
"No complaints here. This is a solid brew."
"Creamy body from the wheat content, moderate amount of carbonation. Easily drinkable."
"D-goes down easy; but not that tasty and a little watery."
"Pours a pale yellow color with a slight haze and a small pure white head. Toasty wheat, light banana aroma, lemon skin and a mild spicy note. A great summer brew from Avery, very drinkable and refreshing. A diamond in the rough? sure."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied, but slightly towards the thin side. Drinkability was great as it makes for a very crisp and refreshing beer."
"D: Alcohol isn't noticeable, crisp refreshing flavor, and hardly noticeable on palate."
"Well balanced, light and easy drinking. Great summer time session beer."
"Overall, a good beer, even for those not huge on wheat. Not Avery's best, but one of the better American interpretations of this difficultly simple Belgian style."
"Very smooth, very mellow a basic good beer, not what im used to by Avery but a solid brew"
"Value: I'd go up to ten bucks a sixer on it."
"Comments: I picked up this bottle at the Whole Foods in Tribeca."
"D: One of the beers I discovered years ago, and go back to every so often. Always good, and a great choice for belgian beginners."
"Mouthfeel is light and crisp body with high carbonation."
"Drinkability: I could drink a few of these. One of the better American versions of a classic belgian beer."
"Pours a orangish-yellow, with not much head to speak of, till you swirl the yeast and pour it on top. Smells of wheat & citrus. Flavor not overwhelming, some wheat & clove here, citrus there, everything pretty subtle and well-blended. Dry finish, which is nice & not sweet at all. Overall, not an outstanding brew, but a very drinkable one. Would like to try on-tap to see if anything else stands out."
"Drinkability: yes, a pretty decent brew."
"Procured at Red Carpet Wine & Liquor Glendale, CA"
"D- Very thin so it's easy to drink but the whites don't really do it for me"
"D: Good all around light beer. Suitable for a hot summer day and trying to relax and cool down."
"Drinkability: like most wits, it is pretty drinkable. However, its grainy and almost soapy quality mean it is not *that* drinkable."
"D: Would be great very cold on a hot day. Decent at all other times. Maybe good with spicey food."
"12oz. Poured a cloudy, pale straw color with a tall white head that dissipated fairly quickly and left little lacing on the glass. Aromas were of wheat, Belgian yeasts, coriander, and faint orange rind. Tastes were similar to the aromas with the addition of some banana notes. Mouth-feel was fairly low carbonation and although light in body, the wheat noticeably adds some weight to the mouth. Alcohol is non-existent. Relatively easy to drink and a decent representation of the style."
"Soft, but not as soft as some of the better beers of its style. Not particularly complex (a bit grainy wheat and wood flavors) and the separate elements of the beer do not flow together as well as the score suggests."
" were all that weak."
"The body is a little fuller than typical for the style and has a dry finish. This style is very drinkable in general and this example has great drinkability even compared to other Wits. Overall, a very good example of the style, worth seeking out."
"overall okay for a wit."
"Note. I had to swirl the bottle on it's side for a good minute or two to get all the yeast sediment off of the bottle and into the glass, it was well worth the trouble."
"D - Goes down the hatch very easy. Could easily get caught up drinking a few of these."
"Brews Brother"
"D - This brew falls a little flat for me. The taste isn't spicy enough (especially compared to the nose) and the sweet flavors feel unbalanced and rough. Not a bad American interpretation of a Belgian classic, but then, again, not a great interpretation, either."
"after drinking both this and hoegaarden - averys white rascal is far superior"
"MF/D: Slightly over-carbonated, light in body, again, a little boring"
"Drinkability: It is a wit..and it delivers on the refreshing aspect, as well as having a taste good for a summer day. A good wit..try it out"
"Although it has definitely taken a different route than expected, it does have an appealing flavor and is highly drinkable. It might get flack for being a lighter and more user-friendly version of the witbier, but that doesn't stop it from being a tasty little wheat ale and something capable of heavy warm weather consumption."
"Drinkability: It's not too bad... The flavor isn't something that catches my attention as I've definitely had more flavorful offerings, but it's still refreshing enough at the end of a long hot day that I certainly don't mind drinking it."
"For style it is a pretty sweet beer as opposed to others which enchance the citrus more. For this, I find it very drinkable and refreshing."
"going to the beer store and picking an avery is like going to the ferrari dealership, it doesn't matter which one you get, its going to be awesome. has a very very light color to it, even for a wit, and has a big white head, the head is one of those big foamy ones that does not go away quickly, sticks around for a while. smell is nice and yeasty, with notes of corriander and citrus fruits. taste is very good, this is one of the few wheat ales that has a bit of a malt kick to it, its mostly noticable on the after taste. very solid beer, and it hits the spot on a hot day like today."
"Not a bad summer beer. Nothing special, but very pleasant. Something to bring to a party or BBQ."
"Overall - Very classic Belgian Wit flavors with this ale. The flavors are pronounced but not overwhelming"
"An easy-drinking witbier. Pours a very light yellow, slightly green, with a head that quickly dissipates to a ring of carbonation. Some nice lacing, but nothing too outstanding. Smells almost buttery, but very subtle. There's not much aroma to this beer. The taste is soft and slightly bubblegummy. It's a delicate style, I understand that, but nothing really stands out about this brew. There's nothing wrong with it, but it's no Celis White or Blanche de Chambly."
"D - I could definately polish off a couple in one sitting."
"D: A pedestrian effort which I am unlikely to retread."
"D - Nothing extraordinary but more than drinkable and would satisfy the ""unwashed masses"" at any summer gathering."
"D - Very enjoyable and an excellent example of the style. Pretty basic for a wit, but still one of the better ones out there in my opinion."
"Overall, a great quaff for the brutal South Florida summer."
"D - pretty high. as a big fan of wits, this one is no prized pig, but not a brew to shake your finger at either. just a solid go-to for the price, and a local favorite of mine. Overall a decent american wit, and thirst quencher (especially during the sweat months)"
"There's not anything interesting here, but everything is done very well. It'd be an easy choice to pick up a sixer (at least when Whirlwind is out of season)."
"Drink: A nice belgium witbier. A good and refreshing drink, perfect for warm days. Woul drink nice with some sweeter flavored dishes. Also good by itself. Would buy it again."
"Pours a cloudy gold under a white head of moderate retention. Smells, well, like fruits and dirty laundry. Taste is a tart/laundry water mix with only 1/4 the regular dose of Tide. Pretty off to me, not enjoying it."
"D- This is a damn good Witbier at a 6 pack for 1.40$ per beer and better than most, but doesn't come in 12 packs for 1.04$ per beer like Sam Adams Seasonal."
"Poured a nice pale white-yellow color. Strong hazy appearance, and nice white head. Light aroma with yeast and some citrus. Taste is more nice yeasts, orange and lemon, a bit of nice grains, and some pepper in the finish. Light-bodied with light carbonation. Goes down smooth and alcohol isn't high. Tasty as a quality session Wit. Will get again for sure."
"Another pleasant surprise I came across at the Torches On The Hudson Restaurant in Newburgh, NY. It poured a musty pale yellow/gold color with plenty of bubble action, and good sized white head and great lacing. The aroma was a polite bready citrus and light allspice, clean and solid for the style. The taste is a medium to light clovey bread with light lemon background to the back of the mouth. It's lively, refreshing and clean refreshment yet it retains a consistency that truly suggests liquid french bread, nearly mid-body with just a bit of viscous feel. I could drink many of these in most any situation. This is generally an easy style to like but this one certainly hangs in there as a better than average offering by my taste buds."
"Pours a very pale straw color with a thick head that disappeared rather quickly. Smells yeasty and coriander/clove spicy. The flavor is sweet and fruity even peachy with a clovey type spice. Good aftertaste with a nice tartness in the finish. The only thing I didn't really like is that is was very watery feeling and thin."
"Mouthfeel is a bit too much like tap water but it has a refreshing level of carbonation that keep it kind of like mineral water and would be nice on a hot day. Drinkability is kept low by the residual sweetness."
"Tap @ Pizza Port SB. Poured a clear faint yellow with a fizzy white head. Not a good start. Pleasant wheat and spice aroma, sweeter than most. Taste was very light, even for the style. Tart wheat and orange peel dominate. Some spice, but nothing to really distinguish the beer. Dry, crisp finish. Refreshing but lacking."
"D: An easy drinking beer that has a nice lightness to it. There are better takes on this style, but this is a nice beer overall."
"Great witbier, very complex and lots of spices. Well worth a try and will probably pick this up again sometime."
"Overall: Carbonation is okay, pretty much standard. Drinkability is pretty good, it's not a horrible beer but just not amazing."
"D - I've ever been disappointed with Avery. Looking back at my reviews, the LOWEST score I've ever given one of their brews is 3.5 for Ellie's Brown Ale... and that beer was really good, it was just pretty basic. All of their ""big beers"" have been kick-ass, and this one is a killer summer session candidate. I have a feeling that this Rascal will be a staple in my fridge when the weather warms up a bit. Just drinking this on a 25 degree (F) day puts images of warm sunny spring days in my mind."
"Overall nice Colorado Belgium style witbier. Highly drink able, and rather cheap"
"D: This may be the first of Avery's standard line-up that I've really enjoyed. A solid witbier."
"D: Very drinkable beer in a very drinkable style. Crisp, clean and refreshing."
"Cloudy, slight haze yellow, white head with a respectable lace. Super sweet with a hint of Corrinander,clove, orange peel and a bit of funk from the yeast. I enjoyed the mouth feel with the complex flavors but the long lasting clove is a real turnoff and compromises the refreshing feel that most whites tend to have. It over powers when it needs to yield to the cleaner flavors of citrus."
"D: Tough for me give a perfect 5 on this, seeing as I only have one bottle. I'd like to toss a couple back, and re-visit this part of the review. This is a refreshing, easy drinker. I think its my 1st review of an Avery brew, and, looks like I need to try a few more."
"Taste has a lot of coriander with a nice hop bitterness and wheat sharpness. The flavor profile is pretty big, it is not too watery or flavorless. Not one of the sweetest, funkiest or fruitiest but maintains a good balance of the three. One of the better wits I have had in a while. Me Gusto!"
"d: This sort of beer provides an accessible introduction to Belgian-style beer as well as an alternative to Blue Moon. That said, there are much better, though more expensive, versions on the style out there."
"Drinkability: This is exactly the type of beer you would want on a hot summer day, but not the beer I would reach for when it gets chilly. Very refreshing, a little too light bodied for winter consumption for me. Good example of the style though."
"Pours a very pale yellow color with a typical wheat haze. Small foamy head a little bit of lace. Seems highly carbonated. Tastes like most wits I've had, although a bit on the light side. Tinges of spices which distinguishes it a bit. Goes down smooth, and seems very drinkable, probably better suited for the summer time, but not bad."
"Had a bottle this past weekend at Common Ground. Poured into a stange-like glass. No carbonation, no head. Pale orange color. Tasted like a wit beer, if I stretch my definition. No body whatsoever. Very watery. Easy to drink, only because it was like drinking iced tea. Not good. Not how I remember this beer from a while back."
"The taste reminded me of a very light bodied, not very complex hefe. It did fit the role of a Witbier, only it did not stand out in any way. I did get some of the wheat and there was a slightly tangy aftertaste."
"Poured this into my Weihenstephaner Hefeweissen glass and it was a subtle yellow with a moderate head that dissipated quickly. The smell was mild with the usual smells you would expect from the style. Taste was very light with moderate ctirus flavor. Was a nice balance of carbonation that didn't overwhelm the sensed. I could definitely have several of these on a nice summer evening or after being out doing yard work."
"This is a decent beer but the style doesn't do much for me."
"7/4/7/3/13 (3.4/5)"
"Overall, this is a really easy to drink beer. I enjoyed it and would recommend this as a nice session beer."
"D - This is a good easy to drink beer has a good taste that goes with the style worth trying"
"There is slight acidic mouthfeel and the finish has a moderate duration. Overall it is a light beer with some flavor."
"D: Drinkability was mediocre, unexciting and average at best.. nothing spectacular or worthy of future purchases."
"D - Easily drinkable, goes down smooth and doesn't linger too long."
"Aroma is laced with spices, hops, and malt but remains mild. The appearance is a yellowish white color with serious cloudiness. Flavor is complex with a light citrus flavor along with the obviously present coriander. The wheat and yeast also are very obvious. The hops are low key here. The only problem with this ale is that it has a medicinal taste that seriously hurts the flavor rating. Still its a good beer with a dry finish."
"Notes from o7/24/05."
"This beer has a beany and wheat flavor infused with a lot of citrus but not overly citric. It has a beany and fruity aroma. This beer has a great golden body with a white head and lace. There is some carbonation burn it its light body but for the most part it is a very smooth beer. Great beer overall."
"I really enjoyed this beer, tasty yes. Overall it was a great find. I was trying to find something I had never had before. This was pretty nice. It was one of the best new beers I had in a long time. It was a little more expensive than I would have liked. Overall this one is definately one I would try again."
"This is my first beer report....The excitement of opening the bottle and getting a good whiff, was quickly brought down by the color when I poured it. I has a great citrus aroma, nice long lasting head, nice lacing, pale yellow color. But color means nothing if the beer tastes great. You can taste the citrus but also the variety of spices. It felt watery in my mouth with a little funny after taste. Its okay, but I'm not inspired to buy another bottle."
"D - Great beer. This is one of the best Belgian-style wheat ales I've had."
"Pours a golden yellow color body, slightly cloudy. Has a smallish head, is white, and is lasting. A citrusy hoppy aroma that is Medium-strongish. Fizzy strong citrus taste, some hops. Clean aftertaste-very fresh tasting. Watery light taste."
"Taste is pleasant enough. Mild sweet citrus, some lemon zest, a yeasty/wheaty background. Nothing too earth shattering, but I enjoyed. The thin mouthfeel is a bit of a problem."
"Pours a very cloudy pale straw color with a minimal white head that doesn't last very long. Pleasant aroma, soft, spicy wheat, some coriander and background notes of citrus. Taste is pretty good, dry and refreshing with some orange/citrus fruitiness, more soft, spicy wheat, some spices in the background and a pleasant tartness in the finish. Low bitterness. Light-medium body, high carbonation and a generally creamy mouthfeel despite being fairly dry. Overall this is a pretty decent beer. I enjoyed it but I'm really not left wanting another."
"Excellent session beer. A real thirst-quencher. Great for summer time."
"Pours a somewhat cloudy yellow body with a thick, two-finger head that died quickly and left a lace ring. A citric smell permeates with some sweet wheat odors and spices, but nothing overpowering. A little thin for my liking, but still retains a good lemon peel pop with some corriander and is a little fluffy thanks to the yeast. A good wit but a little underwhelming."
"This beer poured out a very pale straw color with a nice white head that fell apart very quickly. Minimal retention of the head and very little, if any, lacing. The smell is what you would expect from a witbier... the smell of yeast with a floral/citrus note, corriander and spices, also a slight phenolic character. Again, the taste follows suit with wheaty bread-like flavor coated with spices amd a tart dry finish. This beer has a fairly thin body with a sparkling carbonation quality. Easy to drink, and pretty much middle of the road when it comes to the witbier sytle."
"Better than blue moon, close to Leinenkugel."
"D: Overall, this is an alright beer. As I said, not the greatest of witbiers, but an OK example."
"D: Very drinkable witbier as none fo the flavors are overpowering and the apricot is a nice touch to an already fruity tasting beer."
"This is one of my favorite witbiers, but then again, I'm an Avery loyalist. A murky golden-yellow pour culminates in a huge white head that rounds off above the rim of the pilsner. Head is bubbly and lasting with a little circle of lacing left behind. Smells of lemon, coriander, wheat, a bit of grass and yeast. Tastes spicy and somewhat sweet, yet it's crisp and refreshing. This is a light-bodied drinker that seems to work well as a refreshing recovery drink after a long bike ride."
"Pours a hazy pale yellow color with a moderate sized white head that fades. Sharp citrus notes in the aroma with orange and banana coming to mind with some yeast. Zesty citrus flavor consisting of lemons, orange coriander and a touch of banana with a hint of spicy hops. Light-bodied and refreshing but not watery, which was nice. Not Belgian good but a pretty good beer nonetheless. I'd have no problem having this again on a warm day."
"Drinkability is high, I love this style of beer, and Avery's is clean and well down, without being over-spiced."
"Well done easy quaffing brew with a myriad of scents and flavors around the next turn. Will surely try again."
"More than worthy in my book."
"Pours a great white, barely colored, beer, with great head and lacing, especially for a wheat beer. It has a great aroma, very malty with great wheat hints and a nice spiciness (a little clover and pepper, mostly). Great taste, very nice and crisp, with great aftertastes of pepper and banana. It goes down nice, if a little rough from the carbonation."
"Drinkability: Tasty, but the additional spices are just a wee bit overbearing for me."
"Like Oberon, this is an excellent take on the style by a U.S. brewer. Certainly one to use to turn people onto witbiers. And how sad is it that Hoegaarden doesn't even taste this good anymore? And the label/name is very cool..."
"Overall pretty refreshing, but the fruit flavors were a bit strong and dominated the beer. Will have it again, but certainly not what I'll be reaching for first."
"Smooth and medium-bodied with superb drinkability."
"Pours a pale hazy yellow with a big head. The first smell is of citrus then yeast. This is full bodied Wit with a refreshing citrus note on the finish. Not terribly refined or complex but rather flavourful and in your face unlike a lot of watery wits."
"D-A nice representation of this catagory, nothing eye popping but definatly a nice beer. Avery is 2/2 as far as my reviews go."
"D: Not a bad witbier, probably not one I would search out. I want to get another couple bottles to try to taste the variances if I pour the beer the way they say and the normal way."
"D - Very enjoyable and easy to drink. 5.5% makes it not bad for sessioning and goes down easy. Especially good on a hot day."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Thick hazy yellow color. Lots of bubble rise to the surface. Not a ton of head but it hangs on the side of the glass nicely. There's a citrusy yeasty aroma. Nice texture and a flavor that reflects the aroma. Heavy yeasty/citrus flavor that's typical of Belgian wheats. Easy to drink. Good beer. Too expensive though. I think I went to a ritzy joint to buy it. I probably could have gotten for about three bucks cheaper from a different place."
"D- I don't know why but I really liked this witbeir/ hefe-cousin. It was refreshing and I felt better than the reviews show. Maybe it was the batch..."
"Had at Molly's for the Spain-Russia game, 2nd half after I lost my cable ... Looks like Pineapple juice... is decent stuff but needs more complexity ... medium spritz ... light-medium mouthfeel .. mild refreshing flavour.. it took me 4 years to try this, but probably never again, that being said, the lowest of the avery lineup..."
"D - Very drinkable wit beer. Two of these go down pretty smooth."
"I had this beer on tap at the Flying Saucer here in Nashville. While this beer was simple and refreshing on a warm summer evening, it lacked complexity in flavor that I was looking for and have found in other wit beers. It was off-white, and completely cloudy and opaque, with minimum head. There were subtle flavors of yeast and coriander, but the malt and hops were definitely subdued and under-represented. I would drink this beer again, and it would be great for sessions, but I would not seek it out."
"nice, solid Wit."
"Poured 12 oz. bottle into Sam Adams special glass. Appearance - looks like lemonade. Smells wheaty and citrsy, not overally strong. Taste is pretty good. Good beer on a hot summer day, would not turn one down, but would not go out of my way to find one. Witbier is no my fav style, but I do like this beer."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a very good lighter beer to drink for a long time, especially if you're in the mood for the style."
"This was a very nice drink on an extrememly hot afternoon."
"D - Not bad, but there are better examples."
"Not the best wheat beer I have ever had and not one of avery's best in my opinion. Good in the summer time tho."
"D - All right. Not worth seeking out, but it is descent enough to try if you stumble across it."
"D - one or two is ok."
"D- Very refreshing! This could easily be a summer session beer!"
"D - A little strong on the coriander and unbalanced, but still not a bad witbier. Could drink a few but probably wouldn't. Nothing too memorable."
"Ok drinability, wheat beers are always nice on a hot day."
"D: A great wit all and all by Avery, been tasting a lot of wits lately, this is top notch within that group."
"This is a very interesting beer. Not really one of my favorites but it was still worth trying."
"Right on point, a strong American example of style."
"A pale light yellow color with a white head. The nose has lots of wheat malts with a strong presence of coriander, clove and orange. A little overpowering. A good basic wheat, but the spices a just a little over the top. I thinks a more delicate blend woul dbring this together nicely. A crisp light body goes down easy."
"Cloudy pale straw colour with a thin white cap. Good head retention with a bit of fine lacing. Nice aroma - a bit of clove with lemon and spice. Low bitterness with a pleasant sweetness, followed by a hint of tartness. Lemon and spice filled out the middle and it finished with a bit of coriander. Light bodied with moderate carbonation, decent texture. An enjoyable witbier, easy drinking with a solid character."
"Pours a pale and hazey banana and honey yellow, a light head, and a lighter bubbling. The aroma is a sweet bready banana and clove with just atouch of citrus and yeast. he fruit is a little stagnant and muted up front. The bananas get run over by some different bread like malts that sort of hide the lingering herbal and citrus notes. Very smooth, but a little flat in the flavor dpartment. Although very refreshing."
"D- Incredibly refreshing. I've always enjoyed a good witbier and this is spiced just to my liking."
"Poured a nice yellow-orange color with a good sized white head. Nothing too special on the nose, sweet wheat with a nice orange spice. The taste was a very good Belgian White, a perfect mix of sweetness, orange fruit, and hops. This brew wasn't too strong or too heavy and its taste grows on you so its very drinkable."
"D - It was no problem to put away 3 of these on the beach with a turkey sandwich. Was hoping some hot woman would ask me what I was drinking, but no such luck. Oh well. This beer works in many settings, from the beach to the dinner table. Excellent American take on witbier."
"Last edit: 8/1/10"
"Very nicely done, another hit from Avery. Witbier never blows me away, nor did this. But it was a really good representative of the style, complex and smooth, spicy with hints of tart. Well done."
"Mouthfeel is very crisp and clean with a slightly creamy texture. Very smooth going down and very sessionable. Very enjoyable."
"Feels fizzy and dances on the palate. Leaves a dry, sticky film. It's a very nice spicy Belgian wit. Not at all a thin, watery witbier."
"This is a very fine witbier. Impressive for being American too. Pours a dense cloudy yellow with a touch of yeast sediment at the bottom. Smells like a whirl of orange, lemon, coriander spice, vanilla. Taste fruity but not overly sweet, coriander, orange peel, almost flowery. Smooth drinking and very quaffable."
"a drinkable beer."
"Mouthfeel is smooth but with a lingering spice flavor and light to medium body. Drinkability on this one is high. This is my first time having it and I like it more than Hoegaarden, which is one of the only other Belgian Wits that I've had to compare it to. Give this one a shot for sure."
"D- Very drinkable and is probably best on a nice hot day."
"Soft, yeasty wheat with banana, hint of spice (very mild clove). Pretty light and easy to drink. Bit of citrus and definitely doesn't overdo the spice. Moderate medium taste for the style."
"D- pretty damn good"
"Drinkability is huge - the well balanced flavors combined with a silky smooth Mouthfeel make this one that you could enjoy all night."
"I had a couple 6-packs of this beer over the years, and overall this is a very drinkable beer. It has a nice light citrusy flavor. I have friends who are not beer drinkers say that they enjoy this one. Not this best Wit I've had, but it's still enjoyable."
"A nice enjoyable wit from Avery. Makes me think of Spring which is just around the corner."
"Bottle: Poured a light hazy white/yellow color ale with a big foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of coriander and orange peel is dominating with light wheat notes. Taste is a mix between some orange peel, coriander and some wheat malt with some notes of fruity ester. Light body with OK carbonation. Not bad but not there with the best from the style."
"Color is a pale, somewhat cloudy yellow, typical of a wheat beer but still promising. Aroma is strong and wheaty with a hint of citrus. Flavor is full and satisfying, wheaty and malty, no bitterness and just a hint of sweetness. Any fan of wheat beers should enjoy this one."
"Poured into a weizen glass, the beer is a very pale, cloudy yellow. A two-fingered head formed upon pouring, but subsided within a minute to a thin skin of white foam. Banana and clove greet the nose with a sugary aroma. Mouthfeel is smoother than expected, almost creamy. Controlled pepperiness comes out initially. Malty, wheaty flavor spiked with a faint metallic tang (yeast?) in the mid-mouth. Did not note the citrus or sourness that some others report. Very slight note of astringency and a subtle bitterness finish off the palate. Not the best I have had, but very, very good."
"Expected the carbonation to be pretty expressive - It isn't, and detracts a bit from the otherwise high drinkability score - just doesn't quite quench my thirst somehow without it. Not what I look for in the style, or from light lawnmower beers, but I'm sure another bottle or three will someday make it into my glass - a decent effort."
"I bought this beer in my local supermarket in bottle form. The a head quickly dissipated after being pured into a .5L mug. The color was a light yellow. Where as, the smell can best be described as mix of citrus and wheat. The taste closely follows the look and smell of the beer. It has a good initial impact, but the citrus/wheat taste leaves a weak boring flavor. One of its most positive aspects has to be the drinkable. It's a beer that can be easily enjoyed without filling up the belly too much. Maybe best for a cool spring or fall day?"
"The White Rascal pours a hazy straw color with very little foam head. The aroma is coriander and orange peel. The taste is crisp and has a yeasty flavor to it that is spicy on the finish. It has a sour taste that is left in your mouth. Kind of lemony with bananas. It is a pretty decent witbier."
"Light bodied, very drinkable, shoulkd be an excellent warm weather brew."
"Overall, witbiers are usually hits or misses. This one offers good flavors and a good variety. Well worth a try."
"Hazy golden straw pour with little head retention. Smell is somewhat muted with wheat and a little bit of spice on the nose. Taste is a mostly orange and a little coriander. Decent wheat taste-rounds out the mouthfeel. Not super crisp but has decent carbonation. Low on hop flavor as expected. A good beer for a hot day and I could see a couple goingdoing easy but not the best of the style."
"Cloudy, unfiltered look of a typical wit beer. Maybe a little too yellow/chartreuse. Average head. Scent of wheat, coriander and slight hint of citrus. Tangy and light with a nice spice level, slightly puckering finish. Slightly dry. Good for a change-up on one of those surprisingly warm days of winter; imagine I could put a few of these away on the beach."
"Overall, it is what it is. Decent, mild taste, very drinkable. Worthwhile."
"A not quite clear but not too hazy color and a nice balance between the citrus, coriander and malt in the scent. The taste also equals that balance too. A slight citrus tang but not too much, a bit of spice but not too much with a clean and refreshing yeasty finish."
"D: Decent. It's not Blanche de Chambly or Hoegaarden and just lacks body and seems a bit thin. Very sessionable and worth a try to ease someone into the style."
"Overall a decent beer, but nothing special. There are better examples of this style."
"D- This aint bad. It is not the best either. I enjoy the taste but the complexity and body are lacking."
"D: Not bad, but this seems to feel/taste even waterier as it warms."
"Nothing ""off", but nothing particularly special. Very mild - approaching weak."
"Another good beer from Avery, going to have to open the big beers from that brewery soon, recommended, I am not a fan of wiitbiers and I actually enjoyed drinking this one"
"Received a bottle of this for my 40th birthday. Appearance is pale yellow and cloudy. Poured a fair head, which settled down to an 1/8"" foam that latest throughout the drinking, with nice lacing. The coriander and orange peel spicing shine through in the aroma and taste. Very drinkable -- I'd probably pick up some bottles if I encountered them in a store."
"Another beer that was relatively hard to find in my area, but I am glad that I was finally able to find two remaining six-packs in a nearby store... Appearance-wise, pours a nice amber color that is appealing but doesn't give much of a frothy head that I've come to see from a lot of witbiers... not as cloudy or murky as some I've encountered, but the smell is great, reminiscent of coriander, wheat and citrus. The taste truly complements the aroma, with a nice spicing of citrus and a slightly pepperish flavor that goes down very easily and smoothly... A great beer that I could drink plenty of and still be satisifed... worth looking for and definitely recommended..."
"Great looking wit. Aromas have the classic belgian bread like yeast, clove, vanilla, and grassy like scents. A good overall palette of flavours, with the coriander and orange peel sitting nicely amongst the wheat malt tang. These guys are starting to become one of my favourite US brewers."
"Wow. Lots of aromas here. sour, grassy notes, hops, citrus coming through as well. Poured from a 12oz bottle. The head lasts for quite a while, lovely swirls of yeast spiriling down. Taste is great! I get a little sweetness at first followed by sour notes at the end. Very creamy mouthfeel that makes for great drinkability.The second beer Ive tried from avery, I was a little dissapointed with the Kaiser, but this is definatley a superior Belgian Weiss in my opinion."
"Very drinkable...good taste and a sessionable style make this a good summer session beer."
"A hazy wit/yellow, with a head worthy of The Rocky Mountains. Smell is a standout, remarkably spicy for the style, exhibiting big coriander notes and zippy citrus. Taste starts out great, but for some reason itfalls flat a few seconds in. Texture is nice, full, lively and refreshing. A very nice beer that could benefit from a little tweaking. Wish I could identify what happens in the aftertaste."
"This is a very solid micro brew. Never had Avery beer before, but this was quality."
"this would be a splendid summer quaffer after a hot day of toiling in the sun. it's even pretty tasty during a cool fall day in november. overall, it's a nice stab at the style. i hope i can obtain this during the summer season next year. it's worth a case."
"Drinkability: A slightly odd feeling beer that is decent"
"Drinkability: I had about 2 of these in once sitting. Very nice sessionable beer."
"drinkability...I could drink this all day on a hot summer day...or in my case a late October hot and smoky day"
"Pours a cloudy golden orange color. Head was gone by the time it arrived at the table. Smell is nice, but very subtle. Some spices, and a little citrus peel smells, and some yeast. Flavor is very smooth a sweet with little else. Mouthfeeling is very crisp and clean"
"A pretty good domestic stab at the witbier style, and much better than Lost Coast's Great White, which is commonly encountered around here. When in the mood for it, I'd definitely drink it again."
"Just cracked the top on this and poured it into a pilsner glass. The beer pours a murky, hazy yellow. It has about a one inch head that went away quickly. The nose is of bread and citrus and the taste matches this. Had a nice crisp feeling in the mouth and is quite refreshing."
"The taste is definitely where this beer shines best, peppery with some strong yeast flavor coupled with the tang of orange zest and the slight bite of coriander. The body was fairly light with a moderate amount of carbonation. Overall, this was crisp and refreshing, very easy to sip and highly drinkable."
"One of the better witbiers Ive tried. Excellent."
"A tasty and easy to drink brew, not especially assertive yet still flavorful."
"Very light, opaque yellow-near-golden color. Head dissolves too fast. Nose is crazy strong citrus and wheat; smells how it should. Nice buttery taste, smooth as hell. Lots of wheat, however the citrus is much subtler than I expected based on the nose. Body is medium with good carbonation. This one was okay; a mediocre wit."
"Pretty average witbier. Not something I'd call a staple in my beer diet."
"Very drinkable. Can definitely taste the coriander and floral undertones. Nice finish with just a little bite that lingers on the tastebuds. I was very pleasantly surprised as I wasn't exactly sure what it was I was sampling when I asked for a pour (I liked the look of the tap handle). Very solid wit beer."
" A very tasty easy drinking summer beer. I would recommend it for those dog days of summer."
"I would like to see the flavors play off of each other in a more subtle and complex way, but it was still a fairly tasty and enjoyable brew!"
"I was a little hesitant to pick this one up, but i was pleasantly surprised. usually micro-wits get too overdone, but this one stands out. Very nice pour- cloudy golden yellow, and aromas were strong- lemony spices, yeasty malts and buttery bananas. Flavors were spot on, though somewhat artificial tasting. Yeastiness was welcomed, very well done and the body was not too heavy. Nice earthy lemon finish, with some diacetyl sneaking into the aftertaste. Good brew, worth a try."
"Drinkability: Great. This beer is a great everyday beer. Light enough to satisfy, flavorful enough to keep you interested."
"i've been in boulder for 4 years now--absolute beer heaven. i sure hope i'll be able to find all my favourite area brews after our cross-country move next week. what will i miss about boulder? the beer, and the mountains. in that order."
"I thought this beer to be a very average and subdued witbier. The spiciness, color, smell, taste, and mouthfeel were all weaker and more vitiated than I would have hoped. That being said, this is not a bad beer, and it is quite drinkable. I was forced to buy a six pack of it because the supermarket did not sell singles, and I'm not disappointed in anyway in having to finish the remaining bottles. If you want a beer more representative of the style, there are quite a few of much higher quality that should be sought out."
"Light tangy mouthfeel, very lively. Goes goes very nice,brought a six pack and brought 3 to a party on Sat. nice 80 degree day wish i had brought the whole six pack. Great summer beer."
"Pours a cloudy pineapple yellow, thin white head, lace spots, nice retention, retains a solid head. Smell is honey sweet, banana, spicey wheat, yeast, bit of citrus, some bread. Taste is very peppery, wheat, banana, clove, yeasty bread, more spice in the finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. Not bad witbier, but I've had better, pretty average for the style."
"Overall I think my tastes don't prefer the lingering spices in the finish."
"This beer is a good beer but not the best witbier. Seems to be missing some of the spices found in many other wits. taste is average and you would be better off with a Hoegarden or Victory Whirlwind. Not a bad beer but falls somewhere in the middle of the pack."
"D - I drank 4/5ths before I remembered to review it. That tells me it's not a wow beer, but it can't be too bad."
"Overall, White Rascal is a fairly good take on the style, although I think it could be improved. I miss that yeasty characteristic, which isn't completely absent, but toned down. Despite this, White Rascal would make a nice choice if you're buying beer for large audience."
"This is a nice brew overall. Appearance could use some beefing up but everything else is quite nice. This one is well balanced and a nice thirst quencher thats also full of flavour. Definitely worth a try."
"This was a strange experience of a beer. I like witbiers so I picked up a single to try. I've never smelled a beer that smelled like a hot dog and tasted like a lime popsicle. However, I like hot dogs and will occasionally eat a lime popsicle, so I won't slam this beer for being a little strange. I might even try it again sometime."
"Easy to drink, and refreshing. Although not stand-out, it is still a good beer. Recommended if you are a fan of witbiers."
"This beer pours out a pale straw gold, slightly hazy with an everlasting pure white head which laces a lot. The smell is of wheat, a bit of orange or lemon, some floral hops and a good deal of yeastiness. The taste is of spicy hops, coriander, orange a touch of lemon and a few other spices all surrounded by wheat malt. The mouthfeel is light and fairly effervescent with somewhat high levels of carbonation. Drinkability is good this is a very pleasant summer beer and a fine example of the witbier style."
"Update 6/1/11: Tried for the first time in four years. Head retention doesn't quite last as long. Doesn't quite have the depth of flavor that I remember, more singular. Still tasty, but I need to be fair and drop some scores accordingly."
"An awesome fruity wheat ale flavor while still managing to keep it lightly done. No overpowering attributes, just an easy drinking wheat ale. Maybe a good choice as a break-in beer for someone."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Light bodied on the palate. This brew has a slightly drying finish, but not too much so. Easy to drink and incredibly refreshing on a hot day (or in a hot apartment while brewing). This is a brew that I could see myself buying again, though I'd rather go with Hoegaarden or Holy Moses. I'll definitely be exploring the style more, especially now that the summer months are here."
"D- This is a very drinkable and refreshing brew. Good example of a witbier from Avery. I will have it again. Good and easy beer to session."
"If you don't like all the banana and clove in a hefeweizen, but want to drink a nice wheat beer give this one a try."
"A very gritty lemony yellow (the colour looks uneathly actually!) with bubbles and big bubbly white head. The body is hazy when viewed and rather spritzy when in the mouth. Flavours of fresh ground pepper and light, simple spices. It finishes on that very peppery note. Refreshing, although the body is lacking alot of texture. The aroma is filled with lemon and ginger. This is not a great version of the style, but still acceptable and easily enjoyed - Recommended as a real ""lite"" beer."
"Decent brew, but not my favorite Witbier though."
"The beer pours a pale whiteish yellow color with a nice creamy white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. The aroma features all the wonderful flavoris in belgain wits with wheat, orange peeland corriander. The taste is mildly tart with some yeast and wheat flavors with hints of the orange peel. The taste is good but a little thin and subdued. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Overall, this is a very good domestically produced wit that really surprised me. If I didn't know better, I would have thought this was made in Belgium. Recommended."
"Soft, wheat and oat taste and feel up front. Light sweetness mixes with light spice. Refreshing citrus zest perks up the taste buds near the yeasty, and mildly bitter finish. Nice! Moderate body with a refreshing, lilting, yet smooth mouthfeel. Well made witbier from Avery."
"My only complaint with this was that I was drinking it on a Spring inside a restaurant. I think this would be much better served cold outside on a hot summers day. Ill have to plan on that."
"Drinkability is quite high. I'm not usually a fan of this style, but I'm practically turning into a convert with this brew. This doppelbock and stout lover is digging it."
"Quick and easy to drink. Not alot of big flavors, but what is there is well balanced and refreshing."
"This is a very good American wit."
"Recommended, although not as nicely balanced as some of the German examples."
"Body is medium, and matbe just a tad too thick for this style. Slick, creamy, and mega-refreshing nontheless. I'm really digging this beer!"
"on a belgian variation"
"Thanks to my friend James for teaching me the proper way to get maximal yeast out of the bottle (vigorously rolling it back and forth on the table with a bit left in it), this witbeer poured a cloudy yellow with a thin, persistent white head with curious lacing. Smelled like a quality Belgian white -- fruity, yeasty, and a little spicy. Like blood orange marmalade on fresh bread - yum. Above average taste for a domestic wit, nice yeast taste treads the line between fruity and bitter, some apple in the finish. I thought this was an unusually big body for this style, but it was balanced by carbonation. But those bubbles make this a beer a burpy one -- I'm planning on making this a regular purchase (tastier than Blue Moon if not as refreshing), but I couldn't drink it all night."
"Poured (with the swirled yeast) from a 12oz. bottle into my shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a very cloudy light yellow color. Reminds me of the color of lemonade. There is about an inch of fluffy, dense white head. Lacing is left on the glass with each sip. Smells of coriander, lemon, orange and spicy yeast. Tastes of peppery spice, orange peel, maybe a touch of lemon and honey as well as a nice dose of wheat. Crisp and light bodied with moderate carbonation. Very drinkable even on a brisk early spring evening."
"Make your own decisions here."
"A nice citrusy wheat beer from Avery. Smells like cardamon and lemon. Appearance is a muted golden hugh with two finger white head. Taste is citrusy and little bit of hemp and some spice. Nicely carbonated for the style. Not a lot of alcohol present on the tounge. Not a bad wheat beer."
"I liked this a lot. Very refreshing, crisp mouthfeel with almost prickly mouthfeel. Nice drinkability. Good beer to keep on hand. Will certainly buy more of this."
"It poured a hazy lemon yellow with a small head that diminished quickly but left nice lacing. The aroma is light and spicy, with the coriander very apparent. I thought the odor was more lemony than orange. The orange was more obvious in the flavor than I expected from the aroma, with the coriander still very noticeable, along with a hint of pepper and clove. It's a little hoppier than many witbiers, but since I like a hoppy beer, this suited me just fine! White Rascal is definitely a very drinkable beer, and one that I'll be putting in my ""beer rotation."""
"D - A nice take on the Belgian white style. Orange flavor really stands out. Server was kind enough to leave out the slice of lemon or orange."
"Very bright and pale gold, hazy from the yeast pour. Thick white head with good retention. Speckly lacing. Spicy aroma with a hint of banana. Coriander is readily apparent, with a touch of saaz spiciness. Sourish wheat scent. The flavor is light and pleasant. Very easy drinking with the light body and affable carbonation. Slightly sour wheat malt and yeast presents a dryish, mildly powdery texture. Evenly and pleasantly spiced with evident orange peel and coriander, riding into the finish with vague herbal hop presence. Very little bitterness, but some hop flavor is there. Good balance, neither leaning towards sweet, sour, bitter, or overly spicy. Nothing crazy or really out of the ordinary for the style, but it's solid and benignly drinkable. A very easy going brew that I'm definitely in the mood for. Something tasty and flavorful for a hot day or just when you're feeling tired and want an easy drinking brew."
"Spice is also a leader throughout the taste with a bit of an alcohol tint to the orange and coriander. Still, it's balanced and not too watery in the mouth. Overall, an interesting if not perfect attempt at the style."
"A very pleasant, balanced witbier. Clean and crisp compared to other overly-sweetened takes on the style."
"I just can't do it, I can't take another sip. Down the drain with you."
"D - It was very good. A nice representation of the style."
"I've already reviewed this beer once, but my opinion has changed slightly (esp. given that I've tried other beers of the style). I like this beer, and I think I was a bit unfair: I said that the spices weren't strong enough, but I've changed my mind. They aren't particularly strong, but enough to maintain its presence amongst the hops. I still wish that the yeasty flavor was a bit stronger. Altogether a fairly good witbier, though not too complex (I'm still looking for that holy grail of witbiers!)"
"This beer was not particularly heady, nor was it very aromatic. After a sip, I did notice a nice little hint of ginger, but apart from that it's not a particulary complex white beer. It does go down smooth, however, without that acrid aftertaste that poorly crafted whites can have."
"A little more hoppiness to it than the average wit. I enjoyed it. The orange peel and coriander were present but the hops made them a little faint. This is a great spring time beer, and I may very well pick some up next spring. An easy beer to drink. Give it a try. Buy a six pack, yo won't be disappointed."
"An average witbier. Seems to be a little bland, and closer to an American Wheat Ale. It's worth a try, but I won't be buying it again."
"I was drinking this on a cold night and it actually hit the spot. Not sure why, but I had a bad feeling about the beer. It wasn't anything extraordinary but I did enjoy it. Something I'll try again if it comes up."
"Pours a murky light gold with a slight greenish tinge and a bright white head that dissipates rather quickly. Smells of yeast and coriander dominate. On the palate, an offputting cooked grain note leads things off, followed by some fruity sweetness and a carbonation/acidity combo that succeeds in drying out things through the finish. Mouthfeel is suitably medium, with some yeasty thickness and acidity that lends a feeling of lightness. Overall, this beer contains representations of all the touchstone elements of Belgian witbiers, but none of these elements feel right; they're all executed with what falls somewhat short of success. The gestalt of that is that this beer is only mediocre; there are much better examples, both from Belgium and even from America, out there."
"Pours a clear yellow straw with a medium white foamy head. The head leaves decent lacing,but the color is Real pale. The smell is pungent with clove,pepper,lemon,bread, and coriander. A pretty nice aroma from this beer. The taste is lemony with wheat,coriander,pepper,and some ""bisquity"" flavors. A good tasting beer that really is a good summer brew. The m/f is light with all the flavors mixing well. I feel this beer is a tad underrated,but try it for yourself, what the hell do I know. Cheers!!!"
"A very drinkable Wit. Flavor is balanced and enjoyable, if a little mild. Worth a try."
"Overall its a pretty good white, easy to drink, and definitly will make a great summer beer."
"first i would like to say of all the reviews i read on this beer only two mentioned the proper pour for this beer which is on the bottle,s label. pours cloudy yellow straw color with creamy three quarter head with fair lacing. smell, fresh orange rind. taste slight bitter citrus coriander and pepper.medium mouthfeel with good carbonation and slight after taste of citrus. nice beer i would buy it again."
"Drinkability is good but nothing too special. This is a very subdued witbier which is very surprising for Avery. I could picture this is a nice companion for a summer barbecue to introduce friends to the style."
"The mouth is light and not very complex--similar to a classic witbier but with less citrus. Not as complex as I'd like, and seems slightly off-balance. This beer might have it's moments on a hot summer day, but is not one of Avery's best."
"Not bad, but not very exciting. I got this bottle in a mixed sixer, I doubt I'd go out and purchase this one."
"drinkability: damn, pretty lame beer here Avery, I think even Blue Moon is better than this. Not worth the 8 bucks I spent and I have 5 more of these to get through. very eh."
"D- It's alright. Won't be buying again. Very weak flavors and is just to watery."
"Beer has a hazy, straw color, with a decent white head and some lacing. Well carbonated. The smell was slightly spicy and yesty. Taste was somewhat disappointing. Not much going on. Some faint spiciness, that was a stretch to detect, and not much else. Decent amount of body to it, and easy to drink, due to the blandness of the taste. Not bad, but much better versions of the style available."
"D- I could probably knock back a few of these but there are much better versions of this style out there."
"All in all, this beer to me is decent, but doesn't seem Belgian style at all. I personally wouldn't buy any more and would steer anyone towards Hoegaarden first for a beer in this particular style."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with no date. Had a decent head and good lacing with some carb. Color was a cloudy straw/blonde with bits of yeast floating in it. Wonderful smell with overtones of the coriander and citrus peel. Mouthfeel was pretty good as well. Absolutely love the taste of this style (#2 behind Hefes) and this beer in particular. Another solid effort from Avery and in my Hall of Fame. Highly recommned. (4.5,HR,T,Y,HOF)"
"Thin-bodied, which is good for the style, and very drinkable. Crisp and refreshing without overpowering any tastebuds. Overall, a very average attempt at a wit, but it's cheaper than the Belgians and a lot better than Blue Moon, so I may see myself buying this again for a another hot summer day like this."
"Drinkability: One of the better domestics I've had of the style I'd say, but with some tweaking and some more TLC, this could be a great beer. Not bad for snagging a 6-pack and having a small session with this."
"Pours a hazy straw color topped by a wispy, creamy white head that recedes to a small ring after about two minutes. Nice aroma of coriander, orange peel, light wheat, and a touch of light floral hops. Palate is nice and lightly spiced - coriander, orange peel, allspice, and just a hint of black pepper accent a crisp, light base of wheat and light aromatic hops. Body is light and well-carbonated, great for such a delicate style. A great beer for sipping on the porch on a cool summer night."
"D: Great for summer. An enjoyable beer. I'd definitely have another."
"Pale straw in color, good white head falls to a ring that leaves great lacing. Wheaty and bready aroma, filled with coriander and pepper, and a good lemon zing. The taste is of fresh wheat and lemon grass. The coriander and pepper accent the beer well, they do not over power it. Good yeasty and bready feel to the beer, but other flavors get to share time equally, a well balanced wit. Mouthfeel is not as tangy as I might like in a wit, but not off putting. Easily drinkable, warm or cold out."
"An excellent representation of a witbier, one of the better American attempts. Mouthfeel is smooth with fine carbonation texture. Notes of orange, black pepper and a subtle sweetness."
"This brew reminds me of a combination of two distinctly unconnected things: Chloroseptic and the twelfth Budweiser at a high school party when you are drinking simply to drink. OK...maybe they are a bit intertwined after all. Anyhow, the first whiff and sud taste said ""peanuts""(of all things) but after that was the underwhelming and underacheiving generic sud-scud sinking me into beer blahhood. Not overly bad but not worth writing very much about either. 2 sinking moon-bombs."
"A pretty average brew, losing points for a taste I couldn't quite let myself enjoy."
"12 oz. bottle. Poured a cloudy, washed out yellow with a moderate head. Got past the appearance and inhaled spices (clove) and some fruit aromas I could not distinguish. Taste was very pleasant with spice, a very light sweetness, again somewhat fruit flavored but hard to specify, and a very hoppy finish for a witbier. Body was light, with moderate carbonation, slightly astringent in the finish. An excellent summer beer, with the spices being a little less prevalent than to style and the hops being a bit moreso."
"WIth white matter, little head. Mild pleasant spicey odour. Fruit bar like mouthfeel, a bit sour taste along with spices. Not a bad beer but only passable on drinkability. Corriander and lemon band orange peel does not work for me in beer or in herbal tea."
"D: Very easy drinking Wit. One of the better ones I've had lately. Very thirst quenching and refreshing on this hot hot hot summer day!"
"A pretty good wit, but not quite spot-on. Pours a nice pale yellow with hazy and a rocky head. Smells of spice and a little something else (a friend of mine called it Spam, I disagree). Its not a very citrusy wit and it lacks delicate flavors, the yeasty, corriander like flavor, however, is still quite nice. Nicely carbonated and easy drinking. I put this on par with Whirlwind Wit. Nice beers, but not quite Belgian. I've buy again if it wasn't $9/6er round here."
"Not too bad. The citrus comes across a little strong, and the electric carbonation gets a little carried away at times, but Ive had worse."
"This beer, however simple it may seem, is a very drinkable brew. By far, my favorite from Avery's base variety pack! Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is light bodied with slick smooth carbonation. The beer is easy to drink and is a frequent visitor in my beer line up."
"12 ounce botle, w/o freshness indication. Pours light cloudy yellowy amber, with a white loose head, showing fine retentive powers and leaving plenty of loose, yet sticky lacing. Bubble kep on rising to the top, yeasties floating around. Nose is of chalky wheat stalks and grain husks. This is a fairly mainstream wheat ale, notes of a creamsicle ice cream bar, soft wheat, drying soft hops late, with some honey in the finish. Pleasant enuf, but nothing special, pretty boring by Avery standards."
"Dthis is goodone of the better wits Ive had. A great summer brew in this one. Could drink a few more lounging by the pool"
"I found this one hidden in the back of the H-E-B. Poured into a pilsner glass a thick foamy head appears. The retention is poor but it leaves nice lacing. Itself appears yellow straw colored with a good amount of haziness. The smell is full of spices, corriander and some lemon in the aftertaste I think. It taste just as it smells, full of spice and citrus. It is quite flavorful. Good mouthfeel, approporiately carbonated. This six pack will go down easy. A nice pleasant surprise find if I must say. Very enjoyable."
"Cheers, Joe"
"After reviewing, I realized that I had reviewed this same beer almost exactly a year ago (thought this was the first), and gave the exact same rating, though with different numbers for some parameters."
"D- This is like the gatorade of beer or something. Not a brew i would reach to for anything else than quenching thrist after work, or heavy activity."
"12 oz bottle. This beer poured a hazy yellow color with an off white head into my pint glass. The aroma is very pleasing and perfect for summer. There are notes of orange and corriander as stated on the label. The taste is equally refreshing with the corriander and orange flavor and the body is crisp. Great summer session beer."
"This brew pours a cloudy pale yellowish-white color. The head is two fingers in height, fluffy and white. The aroma is of cloves with a touch of coriander. The cloves is so much stronger than the coriander that I could easily believe that this is a hefe instead of a witbier. Either way it smells nice. The taste is mostly yeast with only faint hint of coriander. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this beer fits into the rather large group of American made wheat beers that are bland, light on flavor, and just don't do it for me. It isn't a bad beer, but there is nothing in it that I find interesting enough to make my want to drink another."
"White Rascal is a hazy yellow with a tall, fluufy head. Retention is good. Aroma is of orange zest and sweet grain, with a little spice thrown in as well. A sip starts out with a big burst of orange zest, which actually reminds me more of tangerine, and spices. A bit of yeast flavor weaves in and out of a taste. An underlying sweet malt and wheat body provides excellent balance. Drinkability is through the roof. There is a lot of flavor here, nicely balanced and layered, this is probably my favorite witbier. Highly recommended."
"Pale yellow/creamy white appearance. Pure white head. Bubbly but not very long lasting. Nice aroma. Fresh yeast, citrus, lemon peel and a little doughiness. Taste is decent enough. Tangy wheat. A little citrus. Bitter orange peel. Slight lemon zest. Seems to be lacking something, but hard to pinpoint. Mouthfeel is fairly lively. Low to medium body. Decent quencher here."
"Drinkability: very nice drinkability especially on a warm summer day as this quenches your thirst. Not the usual ""over the top"" beers from Avery, but worth trying."
"Pours a nice yellow,thin white head,and decent lacing. Smell is the usual fruit and spice. Body is thin,and slightly carbonated.Taste is of lemon,and spice. Starts smooth,with a bit of a tart finish. This would be a decent summer session beer.Give it a try."
"What is it with American made witbiers and the weird fruit cocktail flavors?"
"Pours an almost neon yellow, clouded with yeast, under a finger of snow-white foam. Nose is typical for a wit - yeast, coriander, clove, citrus. except for an unfortunate burnt plastic bitterness that creeps in and out. Not overpowering, but certainly detracting from the experience. Taste is dominated more by the yeast and citrus. Mouthfeel gets a little flat. Overall, an ok wit, but lacking any distinguishing character and a little flawed."
"Brewed in Boulder Colorado this Belgian stylebeer appears very cloudy and quite yellow. Smell is nice and citrusy, with a faint spiciness. It's pretty complex to taste--wheat, spices, and yeast-- but it's too watery to make much of an impression, fairly thin, moderate carbonation.it's decent but could be a lot better"
"Overall a whit that has some redeeming qualities but in the end not one I would be seeking out to buy again."
"Cloudy yellow with an orange influence. Hints of peanut butter, clove, coriander and orange peel are evident in the aroma. Mild spicing, dry on the palate, with a fairly strong wheat character and a serious and unique overall flavor. Light & fluffy. Notes of coriander, orange peel, peanut brittle and butter toffee. I especially like the finish. Im glad I revisited this fine beer and I think I may pick up a 6 Pack, which is something I rarely do. Nice job Avery. This is definately one of the better white ales."
"When poured in the glass, the color was an hazy light lemon yellow with very little foam. The smell of spice and yeast was evident, with a hint of wheat. The taste had a little flavor of yeast and wheat, but, what stuck out in the flavor was the taste of coriander. This witbier flavor had a bitter coriander flavor that was, maybe to much? Overall it was a very pleasing beer, with loads of lace on the side of the glass."
"Overall i am surprised i like this one as much as i do cuz i'm not big on wits. Its pretty good."
"D - kinda to thick for me, but tasty, being subjective on this, if you like lemony witbiers"
"With so many other witbiers around, this one just does not seem to fit the bill. It just seems to lack a bit in the flavor department."
"Overall, a good drinker and thirst quencher."
"A nice refreshing brew. Appearance is a light yellow with minimal head and lacing. Smell is lightly spicy with some fruity undertones. Taste is lightly spicy with a hint of bitterness...not overpowering...refreshing. Mouthfeel is rounded, almost a slight""jello"" effect that finishes clean. Not bad in the area of drinkability. Probably a good choice for a hot summer day."
"12 ounce bottle. Avery White Rascal pours out a hazy pale yellow with a small head. The aroma is tangy wheat, zesty orange peel, and is lightly spicy. The flavor starts off with a fresh wheat base, but doesn't really go anywhere from there. There's only notes of the orange and spices from the aroma. The thin mouthfeel doesn't help things either. Slightly hoppy in the finish. Drinkability is good, as this beer is quite refreshing. The aroma was promising, but it lacked flavor. I enjoyed this beer more on draft."
"A mighty tasty witbier. Pours a slightly cloudy light-gold color. The white head is nice and foamy, while not long lasting it re-emergs with a gentle swirl of the pilsner glass. The smell is of the spices contained within coriander and curacao orange peel: overall a nice gentle fruity aroma. The taste is very refreshing, nicely spiced, not over the top at all. A wonderful drink for a hot day, or even as a winter warmer. Definitely worth giving a go if you like witbiers, or spiced brews in general. It could be a nice session beer. depending on your palates tolerance for the spices (three of these is a nice prelude to a mocha porter). Enjoy!"
"This is definately not a beer I could drink every day, nor is it a beer that I could see myself consume a six pack of, but don't get me wrong it's a great beer to give a test drive too. The clove scents make me think for some reason that this would be a great fall or winter festive beer....Maybe I'll have to pick up some of these next christmas time."
"I enjoy this style of beer a lot since they're crafted well, full and subtle at the same time, and the drinkability is easy for the novice to adjust to. This brew was a good example of all of those, and I'm glad I chose it out of the blue!"
"Overall: Very spicy and fruity. Interesting beer although it seems to me like it's a rather young recipe. I think it'll be interesting to see where this wit is another 5 years down the road."
"Not a bad little wit. Nice cloudy lemony-white with some brown yeast poured into the white head. Smells of chalky wheat and a citrus blossom. No sulfur in the taste at all, but plenty of wheat and sweetness tinged with citrus. Overall it is a little watery and that takes away from the taste. Poundable but forgettable."
"It sure looks pretty, and the aroma promises much, but it's downhill from there. The missteps in the flavor just can't be redeemed, at least in my mind, by the beer's assets. I can forgive a lot, but the bottom line is, how does it taste? Maybe I'm asking for a lot, but I want better than average in a wit. It's refreshing, on the surface, but drinking another just isn't in the cards."
"D- Im not impressed overall. It obviously has all the earmarks of a witbier but falls short. I can think of 4 whitbiers that I would prefer over this instantly. This is not a bad beer just not as impressive as many in its class."
"I found this dissapointing..I know wits arent the biggest and most flavorful of beers but thi was rather limp and pedestrian."
"Boring light yellow with a small flimsy head that dies a quick death. Aromas of seltzer water, corianer, wheat, and other spices. Taste is weak and watery, as is the mouthfeel. This is like a wit-light or something to that effect. Drinkability suffer, but this is kinda refreshing in its blandness....I'm sleepy."
"Aroma is quite musty and funky with hints of coriander and fresh bread. Hazy yellow in color with a mostly diminishing fluffy white head. Flavor is fairly funky with lots of spices mixed in and more of that fresh bread flavor from the yeast. Finish is thin, tangy and bitter. Better than I remembered from previous samples, but still not something Id go to often."
"Good effervescence, a light body, crisp with a malty banana & spice aftertaste. Another solid offering from Avery."
"Very tasty and refreshing spring/summer brew."
"I get to start with the fine point of this brew, it's appearance. It pours into a Wiezen glass with a large foamy head that doesn't dissipate. The color is a nice pale straw, just like it should be. Then everything seemed to go downhill! The aroma was faint. The taste or lack there of was just plain missing. There was no banana, cloyiness or even a strong sweet wheat base. The mouthfeel is thin. This all leads to the fact that I don't want another one of these again."
"This beer pours a light yellow color with a tremendous haze (cloudy, milky, and impenetrable). The head is moderately large, very white, and fairly stablenice lace. Great fruity aroma on this one. Lots of orangemaybe a little too much, because it can become overwhelming, but its initially very pleasing. Theres coriander, an herbal, pepperyness, grain, and wheat. It has a very sweet and inviting smell. The taste is instantly refreshing: crisp, spritzy, slightly sweet up front, with a moderately dry finish. Its got a light, airy wheat flavor. Id enjoyed a heavy meal before having the refreshingness of the beer really picked me up. Almost no hops are detectable in the brew, just a little bitterness at the end. Smooth. Fruity. Very enjoyable."
"overall- pretty nice wit. nicely balanced, smooth and refreshing. one note, when sampled cold it tastes a little watered down, but once it warms a bit the flavor is much more full."
"Feel is very finely bubbled with an effervescent carbonation and snappyness over the front and middle. Continued smoothness sets well in the mentioned balance above and seems to keep a quick, lighter medium body. Front is a little too short and slippery, watery even, but picks up quicky to gain some momentum for a bit. Ends abruptly and without much action in the finish. Semi dry, semi citrusy, and paled down. An OK brew to have a couple of as it drinks down fine enough. Just not alot to go back for."
"White Rascal demonstrates an uncommon restraint for a beer of this style, which I've found too often to be either watery or cloyingly sweet. The result is a delicious and easy-to-down brew that compliments roasted vegetables, salads, and other appetizers. Hands down, this is one of the best wits I've ever had."
"Drinkability- Nice wit at a good price. Would be my go to if it were available to me and I wanted to save some cash."
"I really like witbiers. This one is a good one, though not great. It looks good with all the yeast swirled in, like a sandstorm in a glass it overtakes the entire beer. Smells of spices and yeast. The taste is good, but not mind blowing. The chalkiness that accompanies the yeast is present, and the spiciness is also good. Still, there wasn't much that wowed me, and it made for a less than stellar beer. Less than stellar, however, still means it's a good'un. I could drink this and enjoy it many times over. I just wish it had more pizazz."
"Pours a cloudy white color, some carbonation, fizzy head which does not last long, some lacing afterwards. Scents of grassy wheat, corinader spices, and orange. The taste is tangy, kinda dry, and clean. Medium body. Very drinkable. A good representation of the style, definitely in the Hoegaarden range. Would recommend for sure."
"This brew pours a hazed brass color with little to no head. The aroma reveals musty fruit and spices that smell quite nice. The taste is light and contains flavors more of the fruit and spices and a light black pepper hop lying off in the distance. This is a light bodied beer that finishes with a jagged bite and then sliding into a slight sweetness. All of this is quite nice, yet a tad muted. There again with the weaker taste, it makes for a highly drinkable beer. Cheers and thanks to pineywoodrooter for the beers!"
"Overall: An admirable stab at an american wit, but comes up short, probably would never try again."
"Certainly not a bad Wit...just wishing there was a little more substance to the application of the style."
"Final Thought: Well, This beer is Hefe quality except you can't taste it, if they would double the ingredients with the same amount of water Avery would have themselves a classic on hand."
"-UF"
"Light and refreshing, but not in a wimpy or weak way. Full of personality and character."
"Addendum: Looked at some of the other reviews here and most did not rate this as highly as I did but I stand by my review; This is an excellent beer."
"Hazy pale yellow in color. Very thin head that clumps a little around the edge. Very active carbonation level. Smell of citrus and yeast. Taste of orange peal with a nice wheat backbone. Nice level of carbonation on the tongue. Very smooth finish. A very drinkable beer. Some qualities that i am not crazy about but it hits the style description dead on. All in all the best witbier i've had."
"Surprisingly easy for me to drink. I usually avoid corriander, but I may have found the beer that begins my true appreciation for the white ales..."
"The beer pours a light golden orange with a little fizzy head. Smells of orange and yeast! Tastes the same with quite a bit of citrus flavor but not overpowering. More heavily on the citrus side then most whites I have tasted in the past, less yeasty. This is how I love my whites! An extremely easy beer to drink, especially on a hot summer's day. One of the better beers I have had in quite some time. It isn't supurb in any one area, but just right for my tastes. I just wish I could get this beer locally. I could put back a 12 pack of this in a night with no problems."
"cloudy yellow white with thin white head. smell of yeast and lemons! strong citrus. light cracker or cookie malt. taste is crisp, clean, refreshing citrus and yeast. very light body and light on palate. hardly even there. I don't have a lemon but personally think this beer could use one; the acid would liven it up. sweet finish. it tastes cold, if that makes sense. sort of thin and understated. drinkability high because it is so refreshing and simple."
"First sip reveals a lite but not thin body with very fine fizzy carbonation. Flavor starts sweet yet tart with some lemon and grainy malt. Finishes rather clean but does leave a crisp citrus note in my mouth. I find the beer very refreshing and enjoyable. Would be tasty on a hot day and I dont think I would tire of drinking these. not a bad beer."
"poured a very pale cludy yellow color with sparse white head that fell to a thin ring. Smell is spicy, with notes of clove, corriander, and pepper present. Taste is perfect, with spiciness combined with a nice crispness, Truly enjoyable. After taste continues with the spiciness along with a slight dryness. Great drinking beer. Great all around beer. Good Job!"
"Nice hazy, glowing white yellow color, possibly the witest witbier I have seen. Head forms and fades fast, leaving a little film on top of the beer. Lots of citrus in the nose, mandarin oranges, orange rind, with some nice coriander in the mix, also. Taste is murky, but some sweet orange shows through, as well as the coriander, which mixes well with the impressive hop finish. Above average, very good, even."
"Bottle obtained from the brewery and consumed a couple days later. Pours a gorgeous finger and a half fluffy pristine white head over a super murky light cream yellow liquid. Smells like scrambled eggs on toast. That was weird, but seriously, that was my first impression. A second sniff reveals wet yeast, clove, dark wheat bread, and salt. Perhaps some straight up H2S, sulphur. Tastes like a witbier should, perhaps a bit mroe watery than I've had before. Yeast, clove phenolic, a gentle tart citrusy zing. I was expecting, but don't get any, orange peel. Overall the beer is wet sweet enough that the clove and tart zing are bathed in a refreshing nectar, rather than standing tall and oppressive on the tastebuds. Md light body that hangs fluffy on the tongue. Moderate carbonation works with the flavors and mouthfeel."
"Evenly hazy lightly greenish yellow appearance, medium head of bright white color. Laces in dripping rings. Aromatic, stuffy and yeasty with orange accents and light pineapple. Mouthfeel is sub-medium, carbonation is fairly lively but more subdued than some. Flavor is straightforward, senses of candied fruit, plenty of sugary sensations, chalky tones that range to chewing on a pencil, but mainly similar to many Wits. Finishes relatively clean with a lemon candy aftertaste. Seems about typical for style, a bit metallic in all over impression and not highly spiced, but pleasant enough."
"Impressive. Like most Wits, it's pale and cloudy yellow. Big fluffy head with loose bubbles. Laces well. Smells a whispy citrus lemon and grapefruits. Throw in some tartness and spiciness. Tastes modestly sweet with light banannas and papayas. Citusy with ripe lemons, kiwi, and pears. Quite spicy with corriander, curraco, and pepper. Light but firm body is silky smooth and a quite creamy and slick. High carbonation plays on the toung. Light honey or powdered sugar sweetness in the finish along side of tartness and light bittering. No real hop presence. Slight alcohol flavors in the finish helps with the dryness and crispness. Good for the summer season."
"Pours a hazy straw color and is topped by a wispy pale white head. The aroma is an interesting mix of bready yeastiness, earthy/ herbal coriander, and a hint of zesty lemon notes. The taste is just barely sweet up front which accentuates the spritzy, citrusy lemon acidity. This beer is quite light on the palate and is quite refreshing. There is sort of an austere, dry note in the finish which seems to come from the coriander. This is quite a nice example of a Wit, it is spicy and quenching with its light acidity. Again Avery proves that they can brew great standard gravity beer."
"This was a nice wit. The lemon zest flavor was a little overpowering at times, but my overall impression was still good."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours a bit fizzy. It creates a small white head that goes away rapidly. The beer pours a cloudy straw yellow color. There are hints of corriander and orange to the nose. Also a hint of breadiness. It is quite tasty. It is a medium wheat body, with reserved tastes of coriander and orange. A twinge of sourness to the finish. Quite refreshing. Thanks, Jay"
"Overall impression: A very nice wit - great drinkability, and perfect for the warm weather to come."
"A nice looking beer, very cloudy pale yellow with a thick, frothy white head that retains very well. Smell is spicy with hints of corriander, clove and lemon rind, not particularly complex but nice for a wit and pleasing nonetheless. The taste begins with a light spiciness that includes corriander, clove and lemond rind...all very typical wit...this tastes like a hoegaarden clone to me. It's not that this is a bad brew, in fact it's pretty tasty but i cant really distinguish it from the classic wit hoegaarden. Spicy (spicy as in a lot of spices not as in hot like a pepper) with a cloying sweetness and a crisp refreshing finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and moderately carbonated but i feel it could have been slightly more carbonated and it would have made the beer more refreshing. The drinkability is high as this is a tasty wit, and is quite a refreshing summer brew, possibly a cheaper alternative to the everpresent hoegaarden."
"Avery's White Rascal is an excellent example of the Belgian witbier style, and a hell of a lot cheaper too boot! It's hazy ""white"" yellow body is capped by a head of creamy white that's obviously buoyed by the effervescent bubbles streaming from beneath. In the nose it's quite typical with notes of coriander and citrus rind; and it's light body passes almost unoticed across the palate with the exception of a delicate zest at the front of the tongue from it's very-fine bubbled, effervescent carbonation. The flavor is drier and more coriander-based than some examples, but there is some tartness and a touch of lemon there as well. It's bitterness is restrained as expected, and it's quite nicely balanced. A very well-done, refreshing, and quaffable example of the style!"
"A fairly decent stab at the style. Seems a bit dumbed down, but its still enjoyable and worth a try."
"Clear pale yellow with white head and lace. Coriander and orange peel combine with yeast to produce an inviting aroma. Sweet wheat taste with a thin mouthfeel supported mostly by high level of carbonation ends in spice and midly bitter aftertaste. No surprises, an above average witbier, although most folks may expect more from Avery."
"Drinkability: Pretty darn good for the style, although this is not my thing. Nice and refreshing for a hot day."
"Probably the most fascinating thing about this beer is the body in that its literally almost white. I guess it should be expected from a witbier, but this is the whitest of the style that I've seen. Just tinging the whiteness is a pale straw color. The head is decent with a beady gripping lace. The nose features a peppery and clove-like edge to it, again its ok. Wasn't impressed by the mouthfeel, its almost a pure yeasty feel. The taste itself is pretty low key, almost like everything is muted; the spiciness, orange, and some melon. The finish continues the yeasty theme and stays somewhat pale with a little left over fruitiness. Not a huge fan of this offering from Avery."
"Comes out a nicely hazy light gold with a big frothy white head. It entices your nose with a nice wheat smell with overtones of orange and herbs. Body is light and silky smooth. Flavor starts out quite floral and touched with orange and lemon. It then smoothes out to a long sourish wheat finish."
"Light bodied, an easy drinker."
"This is simple description of a really great beer. Very drinkable Belgian wheat ale with a big orange peel and coriander spice touch. I could seriously drink this all day long. Avery has sparked by interest."
"I really tried to be objective and rate the style and not my preference, but I just do not see anything appealing about the taste."
"Just a thin coating of carbonation with some volcanic splashes at sides; later huge lace. Super light yellow hue, like neon on the Strip; light haze and action. Coriander, peach fuzz, tart lemon on nose that bangs. Grapefruit gangster touch on nose with a white pepper spice, husky wheat coating, and a lemon tart that is unassailable at the close. Not bad, but not wonderful either; middle of the road."
"Thanks to Chris (clvand0) for bringing this one to our little tasting. 12oz. bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a very cloudy medium yellow color with one finger of egg white head. There is a decent amount of lacing. The smell is very very spicy. Lots and lots of coriander, and a good dose of citrus too, especially lemon. The taste is more balanced between the spices and citrus. Nice lemon and orange mixed with some pepper and coriander. The mouthfeel is pleasantly smooth. The drinkability is great too. A nice witbier."
"Very pale, opaque off-yellow; just a bit cloudy, some tiny yeast sediments float throughout the glass; skinny cap-like head with streaky lacing. Some orange peel, coriander and spices graze the nose make this an inviting beer. A sharp blast of Saaz hops, decent wheat flavorings in the front; the hops will give way to some crisp lemon and citric offerings. A cleansing mouthfeel, thin, nothing overpowering going on here. A decent blast of Belgium spices; and an overall black pepper feel on the palate, medium bodied with some great flavorings. A very decent wit that is easy to drink; cross-over brew or one if youre new to wits, this one is satisfying."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" bright white head above the cloudy lemon-hued brew. Head lasts reasonably well, with good lacing for the style. Aroma is wheaty with citrus notes. Taste is subdued wheat flavor with a citrus note to it, kind of seems a bit watered-down. Mouthfeel and drinkabilty are not too bad, but the watery effect makes it almost seemed kind of dumbed down. Worth a try if Wits are your thing, otherwise there's other fish in the sea."
"Standard bottled witbier pour. Pours a cloudy yellowy-white color with a thin, sticky white head. Good malted wheat and pale malt nose with some citrusy fruitiness and peppery alcohol notes. Yeast addition gives it a further mustiness. A little bigger in flavor than most witbiers; a touch sweeter and spicier. Malty and slick on the tongue and a good Saaz spiciness in the finish. I'm impressed, it's been awhile since I had a good witbier."
"12oz bottle poured into my tall wheat/pilsner glass. The body is a hazy straw yellow in appearance, I made no effort to get the extra yeast from the bottom of the bottle into this glass but I may on the next. Huge white head results from the pour, a little sticker than I expected, good retention and rings of lace are left around the glass. The nose is very nice, musty, with clove, orange, rye dough, bananas and hints of pineapple and white pepper. This beer is mildly sweet and as smooth as silk, really light in mouthfeel with the yeast fluffing it up a little bit so its not too slick. I can taste the wheat malt, the orange flavor here seems a bit sweeter than other wits Ive had and it works really well. The obligatory flavors of clove and coriander are here as well accompanied by cracked white pepper in the finish. A good witbier I can see myself drinking more of this in the future."
"This poured out a clear straw yellow with about half an inch of white head. No head retention and minimal lacing was left around the glass. Aroma was lightly spicy with a doughy malt and light yeastiness to it. Overall the aroma was pretty subdued. Taste was similar with the spices and doughy malt making up the majority of the flavor. Notes of lemon and yeast are in the mix as well. End on a dry spicy notes with a hint of bitterness. Mouthfeel is light to medium and crisp with bubbling carbonation. Ok drinkability here, this is not the most appealing for the style but it would do in a pinch."
"Pours with a one-finger white head that fades to a ring leaving no lace. Pale cloudy, yellow color with the chunky bits on the bottom. Medium bodied. Nose is a faint yeast. Medium-strong carbonation. Starts and finishes with a crisp citrus flavor that is not overwhelming. $1.49 for a 12oz bottle from Liquor Barn Lexington, KY."
"The orange opens nicely as a vaporous zing. Citrus. Delish Saaz hops. This is goddamned refreshing! Lemon grabs the palate like a flashback as the beer goes down. Yeast provides a nice sourness that just brings down the house. So perfectly balanced. This is a short story about complexity. Not clean; there's dried orange peel, vanilla extract, a chalky mouthfeel. The whole beer seems geared to make this raw wheat funkiness a good tasting experience. And it is!"
"There are many, many other wits out there that I would rather drink, though I have had worse."
"A nicely balanced, light beer. Subtle and tasty."
"(1.43 / 12 oz.)"
"Pours a hazy straw yellow with a thin foamy head that does not rise up very much, and then sizzles down to nothing like soda bubbles. Aroma of sweet, doughey yeast, and some banana. Thin and watery mouthfeel. Thin flavor of yeast, some spiciness on the tongue, and a pungent lingering finish. Tough to pinpoint the nuances coming out, but there is defintely some citrus and some coriander, and some fine orange peel bitters."
"Pours from the tap a cloudy yellow, nice fluffy white head. Exactly as you would expect. Smell is a mellow wheat which touches the back of the nostril passage by the throat. very pleasant with hints of the citrus to come. Yummy taste. Slightly bitter aftertaste from this very citrusy beer ( I took the lemon out immediately, so it wasn't from that). This was enjoyable bitterness. It is a very carbonated beer, which I liked and made it feel good and go down easy. Like most wheat beers, I this it would get tiring after a while. It has a somewhat heavy feeling, despite the airiness of the carbonation and mouthfeel. A good beer, and a good effort."
"Pale gold in hue with tawny highlights, fairly hazy, I managed to keep the big glob of yeast in the bottle. The head was white in color; at the apex it was almost one finger in height. Head retention was fair; it rapidly slipped to a skinny cap. Subsequent lacing was unorganized and spotty plus it didnt cling all that well. I thought, maybe, Avery would tinker with a classic style. They didnt on this occasion. The nose is pleasant; it is as strong in potency as can be expected for the style. There is a big dash of wheaty-mustiness then comes a flash of spice, citrus, orange, and vanilla. I have no complaints with the bouquet. It is not flashy or very zippy but it is inviting. The palate is very tasty and it is not bold or crazy hoppy. The taste is ideal for the style. I like the big wheaty taste, which couples nicely with a bit of yeasty musk. Yum. The citrus bite is petite but big enough, once this subsides an orangey taste moves in. The finish is home to the coriander and other spices. There is a good firmness in the taste as well, some straight malt qualities too. I am surprised at the lively tang. The citrusy flavors only seem to grow in time (and warmth). This is very clean for a Wit as well, which is very nice; the spices didnt wear me down. Medium in body, lively carbonation, the mouthfeel is pleasant. It is very refreshing and just as drinkable. This is worthy of buying a six-pack of, a good warm weather beer. Low enough abv to session with. Simplicity works. I purchased a 12-ounce bottle in Brookfield, WI. Nice stuff."
"I've had a handful of good witbiers of late and White Rascal (great name) can easily be counted among them. Heavy on the spices, not too sweet, light of body and deliciously drinkable, this is yet another quality beer from one of Colorado's finest craft breweries."
"On a re-review, in comparing this to Hoegaarden and Flying Dog's In-Heat-Wheat. this is spicier. Should I campare, maybe not, but for my own notes, it helps."
"This is an excellent ale for the style. Poured agressively from the bottle a nice light golden color with a small, half-finger head in my Duvel tulip glass. The head clings a bit to the glass as you drink. The aroma is wheat and citrus with an underlying cashew-like nuttyness from the yeast that resides at the bottom of the bottle. The taste is crisp and clean. Light and refreshing, but not TOO light, with hints of orange, coriander, lemon and wheat. Finish is dry and crisp with a lingering citrus flavor somewhere between tangerine and lemon. Carbonation is just right for a wit. A very drinkable, very enjoyable summer ale that I recommend trying."
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light and refreshing wheat scent with a dry finish. There is some coriander and orange peel here which rounds out the aroma; very nice. The taste is good. It has a dry wheat flavor with some banana and clove hints along with bitter orange peel and coriander. It goes down smooth and finishes with a dry, yet fruity aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine wit. It's well rounded and highly drinkable."
"Drinkability: Pretty quaffable summer brew. A decent and solid interpretation of the style, but I've had better."
"The beer pours a nice pale yellow color with a finger of head. The nose is orange and spices. The beer tastes of orange and spice, just like it smells with a bit of hop staying on my tongue after swallowing. A decent take on a witbier. The beer is light to moderate in my mouth, with a bit of carbonation burn on my tongue. This is easily a session beer on a warm night. Nicely refreshing."
"Mouthfeel is very thin and watery on the palate. The flavor has an almosty meaty taste to it. Very little aftertaste but that aftertaste has a soft bready flavor. Not surprising for a wheat based brew. It leaves a lot of flavor to be desired though. Very weak and tasting somewhat watered down."
"Drinkability: Another enjoyable wit, if not earthshattering."
"Ahh, sort of a meh witbier. The smell promised so much, but the flavor didn't quite deliver. This wasn't a terrible beer, but with so many good witbiers out there, this one could easily get passed over; still, I'd give it a try again."
"I really like Avery and think they have some great beers to offer. Unfortunately this beer was the worst Avery beer I have had to date. The pour left the beer very pale in color and somewhat watery looking even though it was slightly hazy. The smell and taste were overly spiced and maybe this was an older bottle but it tasted a bit skunky as well. Just not that good imo. I might try again and if the bottle is fresher I might enjoy it more. But since I don't see a freshness date I'll believe that this was a somewhat fresh bottle and simply a below average beer."
"This was a cloudy pale golden brew that left a sticky lacing down my pint. It has a fairly sweet fruity smell maybe of orange peel. The taste was not complicated as the result was a wheaty fruity smooth finish. It had smooth mouthfeel with a slightly acitic finish. Overall drinkability was pretty good, kind of a curious beer but worth another shot if offered by a friend."
"This is an easy wheat beer to drink, but the appearance and body detract significantly."
"This beer poured an insanely light pale yellow color and had a small lively head of white. This is the lightest witbier I've ever seen, yet it still is very cloudy and obviously unfiltered. The smell is of light yeast and very strong citric lemon. The taste is very one sided; that side being a load of corriander. If you want to know how this tastes, buy some cilatro seeds, crush them in your teeth and gargle. I detect none of the curaco orange peel they say is in this, and I was rather disappointed by the yeast. The strain is not very strong tasting, and leaves this beer feeling almost too light and thin. I expected more clove taste also, yet only got light cinnamon in the last breath. The mouthfeel is very watery and the carbonation is weak. Drinkability is great though, as anyone could quaff these all day and all night. Not bad in any way, but not as good as other more available witbiers."
"Good drinkability, thanks mostly to the soft finish and clean aftertaste. Light body makes this a nice warm weather seasonal. Another winner from Avery."
"Overall, a great summer brew."
"drinkability: This is my first venture into anything other than a stout, porter, or brown ale. I'd have to say that I'm pleasantly pleased. I'd been scarred in college by all the bud lights and lighter beers. But this will cause me to think about beers that are lighter than brown. Good stuff."
"A little pricey in my area (about $7.50 6-pack) but worth throwing into a mixed pack."
"From the bottle pours a cloudy light golden color with a white foamy head. The head stayed a while, and there was a good amount of lace on the glass. Smells spicy and citrusy, like an orange. Taste is a good wheat sourness followed by an earthy, spicy flavor that I assume is the corriander. Light body with appropriate carbonation. Overall not bad, but something did not seem right in the finish. Perhaps it was too yeasty. Maybe there is no such thing, but the finish took away from the drinkability for me. I don't think that I would pass it up. May need to revisit in the future."
"Pours out like lemonade with no haze to it with not much head not what I expected,strong nose of coriander and smoke.Taste is pretty spicey with a light not of the caracao orange with wheaty aftertaste that was pretty nice.Well not on par with some Belgian wittes it is nice on a hot day like today."
"I had some friends over yesterday to brew and I bought a six pack of this beer. It was good enough for guys like me to enjoy but not so weird and pushing the envelope that the newbies could not enjoy it. I recommend this beer to start a conversation with your novice beer drinking friends."
"Its a winter wheat ale. Pours a clear pale golden yellow. If you follow the instructions on the bottle, which tells you to resere just a little beer in the bottle, and then swirling to mix up the yeast, and then pouring the rest into the glass, it becomes a beautiful clear, pale golden yellow with swirls of lighter yellow and cloudy whisps. Medium white head that fades slowly. It was quite a sight. Thin lacing over the glass. Tastes like a wheat beer should. Crisp, clean. Hints of orange, spices, and a good wheat flavor. Finishes dry. A very good beer."
"12oz Bottle No Date. Poured a cloudy lemon drop yellow with a sizable white head that settled down quickly. Aroma is strong with yeast,clove and citrus. Body is effervescent and soft. Flavor is wheaty with notes of coriander and yeast. Although not as good as say Allagash, this is still a very good Witbier for an American brewer to churn out. Refreshing and flavorful."
"Not a horrible Wit, but not one I plan on buying again. Spicy, faintly fruity, and rubbery aroma...not a good start. Pale straw color with a thin, rapidly fading head. Flavor is just like the aroma, save for the rubbery taste is subdued and the finish is a bit hoppier than I expect from the style. I think the last 5 from the sixxer will be given to my cretin friends so they can't accuse me of only pawning off cheap beer on them. Suckers."
"This isn't an in-your-face beer. It's more of an Audrey Hepburn than a Marilyn Monroe. Delicate, graceful, and no worse off for it, IMHO. A lovely beer for a warm San Diego day."
"From a 12 oz bottle, a careful pour leaves a clear, pale yellow glass of beer. A vigorous pour with the yeast results in a cloudy beer that looks a bit like grapefruit juice. Either way, the head is stark white and made up of tiny bubbles. A constant stream of champagne-like bubble continues to rise to the end. The smell, unfortunately, is a bit reminiscent of Pyramid Hefeweizen. Citrus smell are there, but they're backed by a funky aroma with undercurrents of dishwater. It tastes a bit better than it smells, but it's still lacking. A nice sweetness comes through just at the end. It's nicely drinkable on a warm afternoon."
"ng"
"Drinkability - I liked it, but pobably would have only one adhn move on to something with some more body. A very good brew, but not my cup of tea. Too ""belgian/American"". Worth a try, though, since it is pretty good."
"I enjoyed this offering from Avery quite a bit. I was expecting a bit more from its appearance but appearances aren't everything. The taste and nose to this beer were quite appealing. This would make for a nice, refresher on a summer day."
"There are much better domestic Belgian Style Wheat Ales for my money."
"I cannot think of any other way to describe the way this pours other than cloudy urine. It looked like grapefruit juice. The smell was actually unsettling. It had a rubber or plastic aroma to it. I was hoping that the taste would differ from the smell and appearance but it didn't. There was a small citrus taste, but overall, it was very flat and odd-tasting. Maybe I am just not familiar enough with white beer, but I am sorry to say that this one will make me steer clear of going after another one."
"This is a drinkable beer that can be enjoyed anytime of the year although I'm sure summer is the ideal season to drink this. I liked this beer and would happily revisit it again and again."
"This beer pours a light yellow color with a small white head and leaves very little lacing on the glass. The aroma is a mixture of spices, wheat, some hops, and a little citrus. The flavor starts out a little hoppy and then has the standard wheat flavor, but has a nice bit of spices to make it interesting. It's a good beer, but not too special."
"This is a pretty good witbier, and a good showing for a style about which I am pretty picky."
"Overall Impression: There is something in the aftertaste in this beer I’m not liking. It’s a good wit, roasted wheat, nice yeast, good spices, but it was too light and mild. Would guess this might make a good “I hate wits, but want to try one” beer. Would have wished for a date on the bottle, corriander fades so quickly. I was in the mood for something Belgian, and White Rascal scratched that itch."
"""A truly authentic Belgian styule wheat or ""white"" ale, this Rascal is unfiltered (yup, that's yeast on the bottom) and cleverly spiced with coriander and Curacao orange peel producing a refreshing fruity thirst quencher."""
"Thanks to vitriola for this one!"
"White Rascal pours a nice straw/golden colored cloud with head that was at first rather abundant, and then settled to about 1/4 inch throughout the rest. The smell was that of summer time, very fresh, a bit fruity, and floral with a touch of yeast. Unlike some of the other whites that are dominated by yeast in the flavor, white rascal is dominated by the spices. Very nice subtle citrus flavor along with other spices(coriander) balanced with the yeast and a touch of hops, i believe Czech Saaz in this case. A very nicely balanced white to say the least. I very much liked this beer and would put it up there with Hoegaarden and Allagash White and above Blanche de Chambly as some of the best whites I've had."
"No fear of spicing here - the beer teeters on the edge of being heavy-handed, but pulls back just a bit to hang on to drinkability. Lemony hazy, with powdery clove aroma. Sweet with yeasty clove and a citric brightness. This is what Blue Moon could be, if Coors knew what they were doing."
"A solid beer across the board, this little rascal pours a dark hazy yellow with a starting white head of about 3 fingers. The head dissipates to athin layer over a couple of minutes but does its job of lacing the glass. The aroma is classic: lots spice and yeast notes crowd the olafactory network and sing of the wheat. The flavor is a bit less classic with a fairly subdued clove sense and rather nice citrus level that is a bit atypical for the style. Nice feel continues from start to finish with less dryness, but a nice gentle linger. Good drinkability especially in warm weather venues."
"Pours a pale cloudy golden color with a fluffy white head. Aroma is that of a classic wit. Yeast, wheat, coriander and other spices are all there. Bright and creamy med-bodied mouthfeel. Very clean wheat front combines with a vanilla sweetness. Some mild bitterness exists in the middle with a lemony tang. The finish picks up the wheat flavor again in addition to some yeast. It seems to tie all the flavors and spices together. Excellent drinkability, as this wit goes down very smooth. If there's one knock on it, I wish the spicing was a little more prominent in the flavor profile. Other than that, White Rascal is an easy drinking and refreshing offering."
"The pour produces a beclouded lemon yellow color with the head plentiful and the color a brilliant white as this creamy delight evanesces a satiny sheet of lace clings longingly to the sides of the glass. Sweet malt and hints of yeast at the front, coriander and fresh grated orange peel also in this splendiferous nose, start sweet and tart, top is light to moderate in its palate pleasing feel. Finish is stinging in its acidity, the hops spicy and pleasing but not overstated, very dry aftertaste and another winner from this most magnificent brewery."
"Cloudy and hazy light golden-yellow color, spicy and earthy citrus aromas, decent white frothy head that sticks to the sides of the glass.Wheat with peppery and spicy yeast flavors, crisp carbonated mouthfeel, finishes clean and dry, great for the style, very refreshing and tasty."
"Great job."
"The head is small. It's also white and foamy. The bright yellow/gold beer is slightly hazy. Minimal spots of lacing. Gorgeous nose: buttery, grainy, nutty, fresh, flowery, creamy. The front is a simple combination of fruit, butter, pepper, coriander, and orange/citrus. The middle is tangy, fruity. A nice, dry, buttery, peppery finish. Surprisingly bitter. This is good. The butter gives this a slight edge in my book over some others. But I think the coriander is just a little overstated. Delicious."
"Pours a light golden straw color with a good-sized bright white head that has a surprisingly long retention. Nose is coriander and orange zest with a bit of sweet malted wheat. Taste picks up right where the aroma left off with some initial sweetness of wheat and barley followed by some spicy notes (mostly coriander) leading to a finish of some acidic orange citrus and semi-spicy hops. Light, crisp, and refreshing. A great brew for the summer. I could easily drink several more of these, and thankfully, therere five more in the fridge."
"This beer was recommended when I was in search of GLBC Holy Moses. This was a good substitute and sample of the Belgian-style wit beer. It is lightly carbonated and light-bodied. It has nice spicy notes and some hop to its flavor. A bit of a spicy aroma also. It is a wonderful seasonal beer that is good on a hot summer day. (although the Holy Moses on tap is better.)"
"This isn't a bad Wit. Pours a light gold color with a medium thin white head. Thin lacing. The aroma is nicely hopped with some citrus and spice thrown in as well. Light and crisp with flavors of citrus, clove, hops and other spices. The finish is somewhat wheaty and spicy. Overall a refreshing and crisp (if a little mundane) Wit."
"Very easy to drink. A solid wit. Cheaper and just as good as Blanche de Chambly and Hoegaarden. I'm inclined to get it again when I'm in the mood for a spicier witbier."
"A solid wit that offers the usual array of orange and coriander aromas and flavors. Nose is solid and pushes the same sensations to the palate where some orange peel pushes into something slightly spicy. Hoppy foilage flavor -- dandelions and weeds! -- in the finish. An all-around good wit -- nothing too unexpected though it did seem a bit under-spiced and a tiny, tiny bit fuller bodied than I might think of for a wit."
"A solid rendition and a worthy warm weather whistler wetter."
"This beer poured a hazy yellow straw color and formed a bubbly white head with left some circular lace as it subsided. Some carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, citrus and coriander. A taste of hops, citrus and coriander. A rather buttery feel to it, which is different for this style. Not a bad wit."
