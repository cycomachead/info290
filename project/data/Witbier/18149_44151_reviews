"This wit beer has great long lasting head, delightful smell, and very HEAVY citrus peel and coriander taste. It is by far the most flavor of all the wit beers I have ever had, its almost unbearable.  Every time I think about it I dislike it more and more."

"Poured a gorgeous cloudy golden color with two fingers of fluffy white head that slowly receded and left abundant lacing down the glass. A beautiful beer and very true to style. Scents of honey, yeasty, grainy wheat bread, a perfume-like aromatic quality, hints of orange zest and slight sweet spices and light notes of white pepper. A pleasant aroma that is fairly true to style with a bit more honey character than is usual and a bit less in the way of spice aromas. Good and true to style, but not the best example of a witbier aroma. Taste begins pleasantly sweet, with notes of honey, a slight sour tang and a nice orange zest and citrus presence. This moves into a more spicy middle with notes of coriander, white pepper and low levels of herbal/spicy hops joining a backbone of sweet malt, bready malt and a refreshing tang. Finish is semi-dry with notes of coriander, white pepper, hints of orange zest, bready wheat malt and a slight sourness, not intense at all. Aftertaste is coriander and white pepper with some wheat. A fairly good flavor profile that is nicely representative of the style. Refreshing, with a nice balance between malt, spice and orange peel flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy and smooth with a slight effervescence from moderate carbonation. Extremely easy to drink as a result and quite pleasant in feel. Very true to style. Overall this is a good example of a witbier. It hits the style quite well all categories and is a refreshing, pleasant beer."

"overall: pretty tasty, but sweet and bit thick (cloying). could stand to be dryer."
""
"This is a real interesting take on a witbier and a real enjoyable one. Can't say I've had one like this before it might be a new favorite of mine for sure."
""
""
""
"Overall: Typical witbier, does down like nothing and not too much taste to stop you from drinking it like a mad man. Easy, gentle, fresh, simple but enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a pretty good brew. While it is somewhat lighter, the flavor is full and smooth without being watery. There is a touch of bitterness in the finish."

"a wit with grapefruit, why hasn't someone done this before? if they have, I have regrettably missed it. this one pours into a pint glass (probably wrong?), a hazy hazy hazy hazy hazy straw color, yellow and thick, brutally unfiltered, yet appetizing as anything. notes of dried citrus, maybe the lemon peel you put in fish dishes or indian grub. the grapefruit doesn't give as much flavor as it does character. its acidic and bitter, not ripe and juicy. I live the fuller body on a light style, and I love the citric finish, its summery and winter at the same time, maybe the most versatile version I have had of a Belgian wit. well carbonated yet a ton of body, zesty and pulpy almost, I like this a lot, but I am glad I paid 6 and change for a glass than 12 and change for a 750ml bottle. overpriced but tasty, another fun and challenging beer from the lost abbey. something to stock in your fridge regularly if you make six figures."

"DATE TASTED: August 31, 2013 ... GLASSWARE: Schneider Edel-Weisse pokal... OCCASION: celebrating Penn State's first win of 2013...APPEARANCE: hazy, almost dirty sediment-laden pale straw yellow body; head is glacially stacked; its lacing is like well-patterned sea foam--a beguiling start... AROMA: banana, pepper, and clove--the holy trinity of wheat beer scents--is present and strong; honey is bottle-boasted but not as apparent...PALATE: medium-bodied, active on and under the tongue; spritzy, as a seltzer or a soda; refreshing...TASTE: lemony zest is first to stake its claim; pepper is also prominent sipping through its head adds to the experience... OVERALL: mellow and refreshing; little complexity, and little complaint there; the bottle is mid-ranged in price, and in a six-pack would be more than enjoyable...."

"Got in a trade with swingracex. 750 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy pale golden amber color with a 2 finger foamy and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of pear, grape, apple, lemon zest, orange zest, coriander, pepper, clove, floral, wheat, honey, bread, and herbal earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of yeast esters with spices and a good amount of malt balance; and nice strength. Taste of pear, apple, lemon zest, orange zest, coriander, pepper, clove, wheat, honey, floral, bread, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, citrus zest, coriander, wheat, bread, clove, honey, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of yeast ester and spice flavors; with a moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent witbier. All around great balance, complexity, and robustness of flavors for 4.8%; and extremely smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: While the honey flavor makes this beer a little unique compared to other beers in the style, it makes the overall taste slightly sweet and not as refreshing compared to other witbiers. It is still very easy to drink."
""
"Overall: I love wit beers and this is a very interesting (and delicious) example of the style. It was fantastically refreshing and I could happily see myself drinking a few of these during summer!"

"From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido."

"So they made a beer to quaff in the summer. You could drink gallons of this stuff on a hot summer day. No competition at all for the good imported stuff, but a nice version just the same. Easy to like and recommend."
"On tap at Capone’s. Served in a sampler glass. Pours a somewhat-hazy straw color. Light and fairly crisp. Slight bit of grain with nice wheat. Touch of citrus and spice. Good carbonation. Dry. Well done wit."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Extremely drinkable, sweet and special. At 4.8% abv this is a safe choice if you love wheat!"
""
""
"750ml bottle: This one pours a crystal clear, golden yellow color. There was a bit of a white head on it. The head doesn’t linger long nor leave any lacing. It has a decent nose: Wheat, some spice, floral and earthy notes. The taste is crisp and it feels a hair light. Wheat, some spice, citrus. A nice wit."
""
""
""
"O - It's good but not great. Way too much floral & perfume going on in here for me."
"Overall: this is simply not one of my favorite beers. It's not bad in any way, but it is not tasty enough to justify its position so far outside of style guidelines."
"Overall: One of the better beers I have had of this style. I wish it were a hot summer day, because this beer would be just about perfect for it."
""
""
"O: Great example of the style. Highly recommended and immensely drinkable. Would have again."
"O- Solid flavored witbier that opens up well! This is a seasonal worth trying, maybe not rushing to go out and find, because it will always be there the next year... But definitely worth grabbing if you want a crisp and refreshing wit. Lost Abbey never disappoints."
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style with carbonation feeling a little low. Overall, it was a pretty good version of the style. The look and feel felt a little off, but flavors were pretty good."
"Pours a hazy yellow with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, spices, and some slight citrus aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"Witches Wit pours a hazy pale straw with some orange tints near the edges. A thick white head settles down into a tight ring, leaving a decent lace throughout. A BIG bouquet of aromas are present, most noticeably grass, spice, citrus, wheat, and a little funk. Clove, banana, spice, wheat, honey, coriander, and orange zest all intermingle to build a good Belgian Wit. A spritziness from a lot of carbonation is welcomed by a medium-light body. Another GREAT Belgian inspired brew from the crew at Lost Abbey."
""
""
""
"M&O: The mouthfeel is medium light with a lower carbonation. It is crisp and nicely refreshing. Light with a good backbone still. Overall a light, easy drinking and refreshing beer with great flavors. Perfect for a hot sunny day."

"Pours a hazy yellow to light orange in color with a white head. In the aroma, wheat and light spices. In the taste, spicy, earthy, and a small tart citrus. A spice bite and lighter bodied mouthfeel, with and small dry spice in the aftertaste. Nice flavor, but just above average."
"Overall: Very drinkable. Well balanced. Fairly complex. I think this bottle definitely improved with age."
"Body is medium light with active but soft carbonation. Feels very good on the palate."
"Strong aroma is wheaty and yeasty with a hint of citrus. It pours a lovely clear solar yellow with a thick, if not too persistent, white head that leaves minimal lacing. Firm, wheaty flavor has a yeasty undertone and hints of citrus and grass. Body is a little above average, especially for a wit, and the fizz is firm and persistent. I managed to get one of the bottles with the controversial image of an auto-da-fe. Could this become a collector’s item?"
"Nice, inoffensive witbier. Far from bold, but the grapefruit rind adds a nice touch."
"D - Very delicious and easy to drink."
"A good enough witbier, but probably not an offering I'll find in my glass again."
"T: Wheat upfront with some hay and lemon curd. Maybe a hint of clove as well. Some prickly carbonation works well with the flavors. A pretty solid wit. Glad I finally got to try this one."
"This beer poured into a stemmed glass is bright and vibrant. Visibly effervescent. The smell as I poured the glass was quintessential Belgian yeast. Taste was light and bright. The font is a little grassy but finishes nice and dry. This beer is so easy drinking it is quite the session beer. Perfect for a hot day. As far as witbier are concerned this is a lot cleaner tasting that most imports... All in all another winner from The Lost Abbey!"
"750ml bottle and pours cloudy and smells like lemon and like clove. The layer of tastes are as follows: lemon, coriander, clove. There is a grainy wheat feeling in the finish of the beer. Very nice carbonation and very clean and light finish of the beer. decent for a wit but nothing amazing."
"The Wit pours out as a cloudy yellow colored brew with a fizzy white head on top. The smell is citrusy and floral, theres some spicy notes too in there. The taste of the beer is much like any other wit out there. There some grainy wheat and citrus with a little bit of spiciness in there. Not an overly exciting brew. Glad I had it but I won't need to have again."
"O: not real impressed. i think it's an over priced, over hyped version of hoegaarden. i dont think i will purchase this again."
"Low ABV and good carbonation make this an easy beer to drink, it's quite refreshing. However, the honey was a bit much so I'm not sure that I would have enjoyed much more than a taste."
"Overall: I'm not sure if the odd bitterness here is coming from the hops or from some kind of spice, but it's really quite distracting from the otherwise nice flavors. Overall, it's an ok wit in a really cool bottle; I might be tempted to pick it up once in awhile, if it wasn't for the $10.00 pricetag for the 750."
"Overall (Drinkability): Not a bad beer overall. The flavors are mild, but they are good and the beer is refreshing. I'd have it again if it were available, but there are better examples of the style."
"O- A decent brew. Nothing special. I would have expected more from Lost Abbey."
"Thanks to resi for sending this beer. Poured from a brown 25.4 oz. bottle. Has a very cloudty golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of citrus, some spices. Taste is good, citrus, spice, a touch sour at the finish, clean and refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall this is a fine quality beer."
"D: I like it but at 8.50 a corked 750ml not wort its weight in beer."
"The mouth is a little on the spritzy side to start out, but mellows as I continue to sip. Mild citrus flavors meld with a green earthy flavor. Light yeast on the back end. This was good, but far short of great. Something about it made me wish I would have split this with some friends rather than try to tackle the big bottle myself. Cool label though."
"Another let down from Lost Abbey. I have said that a lot lately. Though, IMO this is one of the most over rated breweries I can think of."
"Pours a clear, gold color. 3/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, yeast, wheat, hops, and a hint of spice. Fits the style of a Witbier. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, slight sweet malt, wheat, slight yeast, slight hop, hint of citrus (lemon?), and hint of spice (clove?). Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, and blend."
"D: Very good for the style, and not a bad beer all around. There's something about it that doesn't make me love it though. Hard to pinpoint. Maybe the aftertaste. Darn good though."
"blah!"
"This is a light bodied brew with a high level of carbonation. The lemon aspect is a bit oily and clingy inside the mouth that lasts. This would make for an excellent summertime brew."
"Poured a hazy pale yellow with a finger worth of head and left some good lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was pretty big on citrus and yeast character but also had bready spice honey notes to add to the nose. The taste was also pretty citrusy but the spice was a little bit more mellow on the palate alongside. Some yeasty, bready, and honey like accents. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, citrusy, wheaty, and slight crisp finish. It drank very good and was really refreashing while grubbing down on some pizza. Witches wit is a pretty solid wit beer and has been tasty the few times I've tried it."
"D: This was sessionable for sure at 4.8% ABV. The Lost Abbey continues to impress me."
"Taste is bready and yeasty, not really and fruity at all. Mouthfel is thick and rich, overall a decent beer that's easy drinking."
"D: This beer represents a very strong effort to capture an idealized Belgian-style wit--hardly unique nor extreme, but classic. In fact, it reminds of one of the greats of the style--St. Bernardus wit--as much as any other bottled American wit (and blows away those few other west coast renditions that actually make it into the bottle). Such a comparison is not given here lightly; while it is remarkable that this beer is a San Diego rendition of the style, no handicap is necessary to compare it to the best around."
"Witches Wit has a nice bold yellow golden hazy tannish look to it with a bright white head that becomes a cap and then stay's, no clingy's though. The smell is quite large with lemon, wheat, some hay/grass and some clove. The taste is quite citrusy with the wheat coming in second. Clove is a afterthought. Somewhat of a small bubblegum presence when warmed. Pale malt off to the side as well. A bit above light bodied and a bit fuller than your average wit. The carb is nice and amped up and a sharp and short prick on the tounge. I really enjoyed this wit for what it was, just another witbier in a sea of em in the style. Drank my pint with ease. Enjoyable and forgettable at the same time, I've had this beer many times before, but from different breweries over the years, pretty cut and dry."
"Drinkability: An above average witbier that at times takes on saison characteristics. I appreciate the multiple layers in this beer. That being said, I am not sure I would fork over the high price to get another."
"Drinkability is just OK. This would be an OK beer at $7 a six pack but at $9 for a 750 ML bottle I'm feeling cheated."
"A wit that's all over the place, but after a rough start enjoyable enough to barely recommend."
"A very drinkable beer with more depth than your typical wit. I would go back to this beer again and again."
"Outstanding spices meld with tangy wheat and Belgian funk in a delicious and refreshing beer. Color is a hazy straw and carbonation is nice and brisk, perhaps 3V. Smell is of citrus, and orange and citrus flavors are balanced by a noticeable hop bitterness and not quite enough Belgian yeast character. The sweet spices accentuate the residual sugar to make the beer slightly too sweet. But these are quibbles one only notices in beers that are close to glory as Witch's Wit."
"D: Just a bit too sweet to drink more than one glass. Honey instead of orange peel and coriander doesn't appeal to me that much."
"Urine yellow in color, but it has that ""glowing"" effect, probably from the cloudy body. Head retention is okay, but i was most impressed with the rings of lacing I was getting. This is a witbier the has some lemon sweetness to it, and ground corinador, which while still brings some spice, isn't too much, but rather ""rounded"". In the mouthfeel, a light bite of carbonation from the beer comes along with a semi-creamy feel. To summarize this beer, a very respectable witbier."
"Overall, great refreshing beer that will plan on coming back for a growler fill for. Great for summer."
"D: An unusual and cool beer unlike the other witbiers I have had. One small serving was plenty for me. Worth a try."
"The beer pours a nice gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light pale and wheat malt scent along with a weak coriander and orange peel spicing. It has a thin citrus feel with a light to mild yeast fruitiness. The taste is decent. It has a rather bland pale and wheat malt flavor. The spicing is weak as is the yeast character. It's watery and not very complex. The mouthfeel is above average. It's a low bodied beer with with adequate carbonation. This is probably the weakest offering from Lost Abbey. It's an easy drinker, but a forgettable wit."
"Fine, drinkable witbeer though Hoegaarden has nothing to fear."
"D: The low ABV helps this beer go down quick. Very easy to session with. The flavor lacks the traditional Wit spiciness, but is still quite pleasant. A nice pickup."
"D - Super easy to drink."
"Drinkability is average for a beer under 5%, but still feel like I should give it props for being so darn refreshing!"
"Flavor is very similar to the aroma in that it has a nice balance of bready yeast, citrus flavor and subtle spice. The peppery zesty spice is prominent up front with lots of clove and corriander. Light crsip citrus fruit, especially lemon and orange peel with a touch of honey that adds a nice sweet element. This helps balance the spiceiness and subtle bitterness from the hops. Pretty quaffable with a slightly dry finish."
"Bottle at the brewery. Hazy blonde with a big white head. Floral yeasty spice and orange/grapefruit aroma. Dry flavor with light wheat and a slightly tart, herbal finish. Light bodied and spritzy. Nor really a traditional wit, but pretty tasty and drinkable."
"Pours a glowing, hazy golden color with a small, white head. Smells like you expect a Belgian wit to smell, with spices and malt being the predominant flavor. Taste is corriander and orange, with a finish of lemon. I don't detect any honey in the aroma or flavor even though the bottle says it contains honey. A very drinkable beer and I could drink several of them, but not the best beer of this style I have ever had."
"I always struggle with knowing for sure if the Port/Abbey beers live up to the reputation of their brewer. In this case, I'm very pleased with the results."
"Drinkability: For the ABV it's actually a bit slower than I'd imagine, but still very quaffable in this summer heat. Served this relatively cool too and was very refreshed. 10 bucks would be steep for this, but on sale it was a great bottle to add to the collection and a very refreshing summer Wit."
"D: Quite a good witbier. Not sure it's worth Lost Abbey's usual premium prices, but I'd get more of this if it were a reasonable price."
"Personally, I don't understand why a wit would be in any bottle too large to pour it all into the glass at once, since the real ""treasure"" of the style lies on the bottom of the glass, that needs to be swirled. In large bottles (like this) you have to wait to get through too much of it in order to be able to swirl and pour it if you want to enjoy the sediment on the bottom."
"Overall drinkable, but flavor is disjointed. Oddly medicinal and almost flat tasting. Not my favorite."
"Very drinkable, I like it. Excellent belgian white."
"D-This is a very nice beer, but maybe a tad too dry for a refreshing wit. Definitely well done for a tough style, but not my favorite wit."
"drinkability is good. nice balance. unlike many american interpretations of belgian styles, i really think lost abbey has nailed this one. often the malt profile won't be quite right, or the spice too obvious, or the sweetness too high. this one scores well in all regards. blindfolded i'd easily guess this was from the other side of the ocean. good stuff."
"Pours a lightly cloudy dark amber orange, pretty interesting colour, thin white head forms, quickly settles to a thin ring around the glass, some lace spots stick, looks alright. Smell is neat, some light toast, banana, sugary sweetness, wheat, orange peel, coriander, some frutiness, lightly yeasty, smells good. Taste is great for a witbier, very dry and toasty, oats, wheat, banana, spices, coriander and orange, pepper, tropical, quite malty too, nicely balanced, really nice for a witbier. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium to high carbonation, insanely dry and toasty in the finish. Usually not a big fan of witbiers but this one is great! Thanks Greg!!"
"Witch's Wit is a good Witbier. I can't say it's among Lost Abbey's best beers, but it's pretty good (especially for a Witbier). It's a little unique in that it features a rather prominent sweet honey flavor. I like that. I wouldn't say that makes it out of line for the style, but it is somewhat novel in that respect. The look and the nose could use a little work. They're above average, but could be better. Overall, this is pretty good stuff. Who would've thunk it? Lost Abbey makes good beer. Despite the fact that Tomme Arthur and crew may not be perfect, they still make damn good beer more often than not. This one's definitely worth checking out."
"Over all a good witbier. At 10 dollars a bottle its a bit overpriced for the actual quality. Would much rather buy a six pack of Southampton or White rascal. Label on the bottle is awesome though, prolly one of the coolest beer labels i've seen"
"- Super drinkable... would be nice in a 12-pack! A great summer brew.. Highly recommend this one!"
"the fact that the bottles aren't dated doesn't help. maybe this bottle wasn't fresh enough?"
"Fairly drinkable, not a bad brew."
"On a warm sunny day, this is the beer to turn someone on to the wonderful world of craft beer."
"Drinkability: Though it could benefit from a bit more crisp carbonation, it was still an enjoyable, immensely refreshing Belgian wit."
"Given the low strength of this beer, and the breadth of flavor, I'd say this is very drinkable. I'm glad this isn't ""just another witbier," which helps justify the high price. Would be a good one to pair with food. Not your starter Belgian White, I don't think I'd give this one to Shock Top or Blue Moon drinkers."
"D: An above average wit, but nothing special. A good spring and summer quencher. Good drinkability and sessionability."
"Pours a nice golden yellow color, some carbonation, little fizzy white head, not much sticky lacing at all. The nose is malty, with some yeast/grass notes, with some spices. The taste is malty/yeasty, with spices. Medium body. Drinkable, not what I was expecting at all."
"Overall this was a very solid wit. Nothing outstanding but a very nice session brew for the hotter months. Worth a shot."
"Thanks Clvand0"
"Pours a clear orange gold with barely any white head. Nose is mild citrus and dough. Flavor is spiced, with some dough and yeasty funk. Feel is slightly vibrant on the carbonation and the liquid is a bit sticky and thick. This is easy to drink, but so-so for a wit and comes off more as a pale ale to me. Lost Abbey should just stick to putting out more wild ales IMO."
"I liked it better than Gift of the Magi."
"Overall a decent beer but if I have the choice I would buy a different wit beer or try something else."
"M + D: Pretty minimal carbonation, and the body was slightly flat. The carbonation there tingles over the tip of the tongue and I can deal that."
"Drinkability: Decent but not too impressive. Perhaps the bottle's a little old, but I think that even fresh this one would be lacking in a few places. It's extraordinarily low in abv% though, precisely where it should be for the style. However, where it's ""enjoyable," it's stylistically inaccurate, and where it's stylistically accurate, it's just not that dynamic."
"D - The refreshing quality of this ale is off the charts, I consider this one of the best American wits I have tasted- A great beer for quaffing, no matter what the season"
"This beer pours a very cloudy amber with a 1 fingered white head with some lacing. The smell is of mild citrus and some banana. The taste has a decent malt base to it and some nice flavors from the yeast, I would just hope for a little more. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth the carbonation level seems good. A highly drinkable brew."
"Overall not bad but definitely needs more coriander."
"Drinkability- Sitting at 4.8% this is a very drinkable brew. It's a matter of whether or not you're a fan of the brew. I could have definitely done without the honey but I did like the lightly citric aspect. The spices were nice as were the fruit peels. Overall fairly tasty and this would be a pretty refreshing brew on a hot summers day. Too bad I'm an idiot and its 12° outside. Thanks Matt!!"
"D: I really enjoyed this beer. Glad I got a bottle on sale for $7. IMO a wit is not worth $12 for a 750. At that price it was ok but anything higher makes other beers more tempting."
"A good interpretation of a witbier, only down side is its very expensive and IMO not worth the money."
"D - Refreshing soft brew that met my expectations."
"Light body, not a great deal of carbonation. Not bad, but seems to lack character."
"sure I'd want to considereing the thiness."
"Bottle: Poured a golden color ale with a small pure white foamy head with minimal retention and some pretty good lacing. Aroma is sweet and somewhat cloying. Taste is also way too sweet for the style with honey taking too much place in the flavor profile.Wheat malt and spices are very subtle. Body is quite full with average carbonation. I would say this is one of the most disapointing offering from this usually fine brewery."
"Thank's for picking up, Dr. Jay. Spot on the style, and nice grapefruit notes. Honey and understated spices. Very light b ody, no real head to speak of. Bit of wheatand spice aroma.Drinkability is great and unique, I can have this as my staple. Above average mouthfeel."
"Despite my frustration, the beer in this form still delivers much of what I loved about the tap Witch's Wit, and while I'm sad to say I'm glad I only had the one bottle, if this is the only form you can find it in I suggest you do so... it stills has its merits, and hopefully it'll be instructive to compare next year if they can do something about the conspicuous lack of bubbles."
"I doubted Lost Abbey could make a light beer without overloading it. I was wrong. Pours clear yellow with a bubbly white head. Fresh aroma of wheat, banana, coriander, grapefruit, and orange peel. Refreshingly crisp taste. The wheat, bubblegum, orange-lemon-grapefruit-citrus flavors are balanced nicely. Dry finish. Great beer."
"taste is somewhat tart and sweet, apricot, peach, honey, spices, white pepper, some wheat, dry mouthfeel, with a spicy ending."
"Drinkability: All in all, a decent beer; I appreciate the unique elements (honey, grapefruit and cardamom), but the carbonation issue needs some work"
"Two tons of smooth in the mouthfeel department; not too insubstantial so as to be 'simple'. My first thought was that this was a spice-forward take on the wit, but the honey sweetness really opens up and takes control. Not a bad take...not bad at all."
"Golden yellow pint, slight haze, with a compact head of foam. It wasn't especially lively, but it looked like a Witbier all the same. Vague spice in the nose, bubblegum with a bare hint of coriander or clove. Body was a little thin, mellow and wheaty with more bubblegum yeast ester flavors. It didn't have the zippy carbonation to uplift it's body, but it was still really drinkable. Overall I have mixed feelings about it, pretty much ""just ok", i've had better domestic Wits."
"Very nice brew. It went from good to better with this one."
"Bottle from Ledger's Liquors in Berkeley. Bought this for my wife, by request, but she let me have a glass. Pours cloudy yellow-orange with a short hint of a white head. Weak lacing. Smells of fruity citrus yeast and tangy wheat. Taste is fresh and tangy, lots of zip. Yes, definitely a zippy beer. Nice orange and coriander notes on a good wheat malt base. Dry alcohol on the finish. Thin to medium bodied, right for the style. A good drinker, tasty and interesting."
"D: I'm not really that up to pace with this type of beer but I did find it refreshing and complex. Life is filled with too much good music and drink. Krallice, Destroyer 666, and Antonio Lucio Vivaldi came on while I was drinking this and it made for a nice varied experience."
"Notes from 9/1/08"
"Mouthfeel is light, crisp and smooth. More carbonation in the mouthfeel than the pour lead onto. Goes down really easily and is quite refreshing. Overall, I was expecting a bit more flavor wise here. I probably won't be grabbing this one again, but if you are a fan of wits this is worth seeking out."
"D: good rep of style. not outstanding but good, a little too light on the body."
"Cheers"
"Probably my least favorite Lost Abbey brew to date along with Judgment Day, was not nearly worth the money for me, I mean nearly ten dollars after tax for a witbier is a little crazy to me to buy more than once, would not drink again, still is probably worth trying regardless"
"This is a great, beer, the spices and malt flavors mingle very nicely. Finishes dry and crisp with a good mouth feel. Aftertaste is very nice."
"Drinkability- It has sweetness, spice, and everything nice. It goes down extremely smooth, and has a low abv that would make it okay to have more than one 750ml to yourself. If this beer were available to me, I'd surely buy it again on a sunny day."
"D: The beer is very well balanced. The style is spot on. I would've preferred if this was a Port Brewing offering as it is very pricey for a witbier."
"While I thought this a very nice Belgian style wit beer, given that it was from Port Brewing, I really expected a bit more flavor. Oh well."
"Drinks alright, just run of the mill as Wits go. I was expecting more from Lost Abbey"
"This a decent witbier that is very drinikable. Another good effort from Lost Abbey."
"The light body, cleansing carbonation, and citrus bite make this refreshing and superbly drinkable when it's cold. But the full range of flavors really come out if you can withstand the summer heat and let this tempting beer warm up just a touch. This beer is very enjoyable when served on tap, but I really prefer the bottled version, especially when the sediment is stirred up and added to the pour. Though autumn is still my favorite season, I'm a new fan of summer if it means this beer will be around."
"D: A very good wit here, a well made brew which I always find from Port/Lost Abbey, if you find a bottle, definitely pick it up, great drinker, the bottle lasted 40 minutes, but easily could have been gone in 20."
"D- Easy to drink, would go very very well on a hot day. I do think there are better wits for a lower bottle price. This one was 7.99 if I can remember correctly."
"The mouthfeel is light, the carbonation is light, and it finishes grainy with a slight citrus bitterness. Also, at the very end it becomes a bit watery. Easy drinker though so it'll be no problem to finish the 750. Lost Abbey did a good job here."
"D: Really disappointed in this. Probably The Lost Abbey's weakest offering. Decently easy to drink."
"Hazy golden honey color. Some white head that disappears to virtually nothing after a while. Smells and tastes like cloves, citrus, wheat, and faint honey. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation that complements the taste. Low ABV and non-extreme flavors lend this to prodigious consumption."
"Pours a clear, light gold in color. No head forms on the pour. Just a bit of frothy ring around the edges. Smell is very yeasty and has a bit of smoky notes. Taste is highly carbonated, again with the notes of smoke. Very creamy and full on the mouthfeel. Decent and well done."
"Drinkability is ok, I didn't really care for it much at all at first, and while it grew on me, it's not my taste in Wit's at all, under attenuated and biting."
"Probably Lost Abbey's most drinkable brew, I could sip on this stuff all night. Seek it out if you're a fan of witbiers."
"The first glass poured out of this 750 was very bright and clear, a yellow/gold colour with a dense white cap. Good head retention with a thick layer of bubbles clinging to the glass. Things were a bit cloudier in subsequent glasses, much more in line with what I expected. Nice aroma. Crackery and yeasty with a lemony twang and citrus zest smell. Spice was coriander for the most part, maybe a hint of clove character, a little sour too. Flavour was great. Crackery wheat with just a bit of sweetness, citrusy and zesty with spices filling things out nicely. A little grassy mid-palate with a balanced finish. The body was a little fuller than you normally get in a wit, but still retained a pleasant crispness with the slightly higher carbonation. Dry, but not overly so. Quite refreshing and very tasty."
"It's hard to get too jazzed about a 4.8% witbier, but then it's always exciting to pop the cork on a Lost Abbey ale. Witch's Wit is proof, as if any more was needed, that Tomme Arthur is a world-class brewer who is able to hit the bull's eye on any style he sets his sights on. Good stuff."
"D: I'd easily drink more but this is my only bottle. Plus, at 8$ a pop, it's a little pricey for what it is. Great label work, though!"
"Overall I really think it is interesting seeing this one get slammed soo much, as it really is a very good beer and should not be discounted. Great Mouthfeel with a really nice profile just added to the mix. I would not mind at all having a case of this one every summer, it was a perfect hot day session beer for me, with a little extra kick. Very well done."
"D: Very drinkable; fairly light and definitely refreshing. Very nice choice if conscience of ABV."
"A surprisingly dry mouthfeel and finish, it's pretty champagn-ey. I'd say the mouthfeel is the best thing about it, as I'm not that excited about the taste."
"Served in a pilsener glass. Poured a translucent gold with copious tiny bubbles effervescing to the underside of the cap. One inch bright white, fluffy head eventually settled into a thin, consistent head. Dense lacing with good legs. Mild nose - wheat, lemon zest and orange peel. Taste follows nose with a slight citrus astringency at the finish. Light-bodied; carbonation is balanced with the body, but a little too soft. Very easy drinking witbier. Lacks some of the spiciness characteristic of the style, but very pleasant."
"Interesting how the reviews for this beer are all over the place. I put it down to on tap versus in bottle to start with, but looking through all of the reviews that doesn't seem to hold true either. I liked this beer a great deal. I like its low abv, and it certainly tastes nothing like Hoegarden mixed with Budweiser. I had this on tap at Toronado San Francisco and it was served in great condition. Poured a nice hazy golden with a light head that fades to a ring. Smells very spicy and herbal with loads of coriander. Tastes quite herbal and spicy as well with anise, coriander, some pepper, a long herbal finish and some minerality right at the end. No appreciable sweetness from the honey, but I'll bet some of that herbaceous taste is coming from there. The mouthfeel is fairly clean with some more of that herbal tang. Nice drinkability. I haven't had the bottle yet, but I'm interested to see if it holds up as well as the tap version."
"I don't think this bottle was mistreated. Just seems like a beer that sort of missed its target, especially for the price."
"Purchased: South Bay Drugs, Imperial Beach CA"
"Drinkability- One of the better wit's I have had hands down. Right up there with St. Bernardus and Little White Lie IMO. Good stuff worth trying."
"Highly drinkable."
"I think I prefer the bottled version here a notch above what I've tried on tap, none the less a nice Wit from one of my favorite breweries...cheers!"
"Overall, Witches Wit is a very nice wit that is recommended."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Wheaty, bready, yeasty and spicy. Dry, light-bodied and incredibly refreshing. The finish brings out a touch of honey and grapefruit. Ridiculously drinkable stuff; this one was gone in no time."
"D-I personally wouldn't be drinking much of this when other beers are available. But I can't deny what I watched, which was an evening where this was the most poured beer in the bar. That in itself deserves a higher rating for drinkability than I might have given it for myself."
"Taste offers a bit more of a malt body than many a witbier and fits with the orange color yet is nothing special. Feel and Drink are equally typical for the style. Nice easy drinking summer beer but not going out of my way for it again."
"It was like Tomme aged this beer - has he been sitting on these bottles for a year? I'll be getting some more."
"Sampled on tap at RBSG at Lost Abbey. Pours a hazy goldenrod color with a dense white head that leaves wispy lacing. Nose is spicy with some nice wheaty ester notes. Flavor is full and complex, with coriander, orange peel, banana, and melon rind. A very fulfilling and drinkable wit."
