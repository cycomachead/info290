I usually don't give it the chance to warm up, but for the sake of the review I let it warm up from my fridge a little. The sub par taste really shines through when warm, still I think this is outstanding as a refreshing summer brew enjoyed cold, but compared to some of the great witbiers brewed locally to me, I do not think this is a good example of the style, blackberry or not.","MaineBrewing","Jun 19, 2014"

Again, in line with our first thoughts on the first sip, this was a surprisingly refreshing brew. We tend to preconceive our thoughts about the “macro” craft producers, but for what it is, they did a nice job here. While this isn’t going to win any awards in our book, they kept it seasonal, fresh, and light enough to keep it flowing. That’s where this beer functions well. The flavored and aromatic inclusions were decent represented in the final product, and blended nicely enough, but you’re going to be drinking this one more for the experience and company of close friends than you are for anything groundbreaking on the palate or brain.","TheBrewo","Dec 18, 2013"

I was impressed with the strong blackberry smell, slight tinge of hops to go along with it too. The aftertaste in these types of beer could be awful, but this one was wasn't too bad at all. What surprised me was the syrupy feel in my mouth, silky even. Overall, not one of the best Sam Adams, but decent for a summer-time offering.","jjamadorphd","Jul 12, 2013"

Smells like hot jello right before you put it in the fridge. Yeasty flavor that kind of clashes with the fruitiness of the beer. No outstanding depth. Unfortunately we didn't like it too much due to our opinion that the blackberry fruitiness clashes with the rest of the beer.","Utica_Brew_Review","Jun 20, 2013"

Smell is of malt, grain, berries, and a slight vomit aroma. Taste is much the same with a mild tartness and thankfully no vomit flavor. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer that is drinkable but not something I would go for again.","UCLABrewN84","Dec 20, 2012"

3.55,7.9,3.5,3.5,4,2,3.5,"The beer pours a hazy piss yellow with an ever so slight hint of blue that makes the beer seem like a grayed yellow, almost like a corn syrup. The head poured thin and cream white, but dissipates very quickly leaving a thin wall of lacing. The smell is a nice bouquet of light blackberry and light wheat with an interesting spice lying below. The wheat-stink is definitely the dominant smell though. The beer tastes thick with a lovely mix of the wheat malty-sweet and the more sour-sweet of the blackberries. Slight citrus seems to be hiding in the back of the flavor, and nicely rounds the beer giving it a ghost of a bitter hint. The aftertaste is a lovely light lingering of the berries in your mouth. Mouthfeel is a little strange with very fierce carbonation that leaves a burn on the tongue but other than that the mouth is very clean and slightly dry with a wetter feel on its roof. The beer is slightly creamy in feel with a good lighter beer feel hidden underneath the harsh carbonation. Overall this is a very decent more mass produced beer. It is actually one of my favorite berry-based beers, I think, as they got the berry taste wonderfully mixed with the witbier style and I don’t really care if they used real berries or berry syrup. This beer is worthy of a try.","Maxwell","Aug 09, 2012"

Blackberry hits the mouth at the beginning with the clean wheat malt taste coming through at the back. There is little hop flavor. There is some coriander as well. The flavors complement each other well. The body is light to medium with adequate carbonation. It is smooth and refreshing. The drinkability is high. Overall, this is a very good beer.

Flavor follows very much on the sweet side, wheat, honey, berries, some very faint yeasty characteristic. Dirty finish. Mouthfeel was a little heavy with some artificial taste to this. Lots of berries on the flavor, like syrup. Enough carbonation to lighten things up and make them relatively drinkable. OK.","BMMillsy","Feb 15, 2012"

The two foamy, fizzy fingers of eggnog-colored head evidenced decent retention.Color was a deep-yellow with a lot of suspended floaties which I imagined was the spices. Nose was rich in blackberry, no doubt, but it was also kind of sweet for my liking. Mouthfeel was on the thin side and the taste was less sweet than what I had anticipated. Instead, the tartness of the wheat gave a nice counterbalance to the fruity sweetness. Finish was semi-sweet and while it was refreshing, one would be plenty for me. It might be nicer in the summer heat, but I just was not feeling it on this chill rainy evening.","woodychandler","Nov 16, 2011"

The beer is light and crisp, with a steady flow of medium to high carbonation throughout. The aftertaste is slightly dry and bitter tart, with fruity notes abundant.

Also some very faint wheat malts. You have to really dig for it though. The black berry aroma takes over the nose. In the taste the black berries are toned down. There is a little more wheat and some grainy characters with the black berries being more of middle/background. Almost the complete opposite of the nose. Did the flip flop shit on me. Finishes with a sour berry flavor. Mouth feel is medium to light body with crisp carbonation. A summer beer for sure. Very clean feel to it. Good beer over all. I kinda liked the opposites in the nose and taste. I'm ok with the overly obvious berry flavors and smells too. Even though they were a bit over to top. Didn't disappoint me like maui coconut porter. I think if the title of a beer names an ingredient, that ingredient should be obvious. All in all this is a very drinkable beer. Especially on a hot 105 degree day.","depechemode1983","May 15, 2011"

It has a nice balance between the berry and spices, and it has that crisp wheat taste. Smell is dominated by blackberry, but is not overpowering. Pours a classic hazy white-yellow that is common with witbiers, with a nice finger and a half white head that has lacing. Drinkability is good, but it is a bit dry and would make it hard to down more than a few at a time. Taste, has stated, was good.

With that being said, it was a good beer. I didn't find the blackberry to be too overpowering, but it was very present. I think it was a good balance, definitely not as overpowering as the cherry wheat is. The color is very pretty, it's cloudy and tan, but also has a hint of that purple blackberry color.

The taste again kind of follows the aroma but a little bit better. It doesn't taste as artificial but a bit blackberry and a grainy aftertaste. Not a bad wit by any means. It's got a really light refreshing mouthfeel. And this goes down easy, nothing offensive in the end but I just don't dig the artificialness to this one.","Bendurgin","Dec 16, 2010"

Taste is slightly fruity upfront from the berry but includes a tacky amount of wheat through the medium light, highly carbonated body. The flavor of this beer has an increasing amount of wheat character as it warms that becomes more sweet and also takes on a bit of some hefeweizen flavors of subtle banana and a bit of bubblegum through the back blended with the ongoing presence of the blackberries. The alcohol is a little more apparent than most for the style.","stakem","Jun 11, 2010"

Rather artificial blackberry character, medicinal in nature washes everything else out. Maybe some wheat is present, but there's some spice character as well. Just way too fruity, not enough yeast expression. The palate opens with the artificial fruit character dominating, medicinal in character. Then, the moderate spice character kicks in with a perplexing astringency on the finish. The spice character is definitely coriander seed in nature with that classic astringency I've learned to expect from it when used with a less than deft hand. Light in body with moderate carbonation, this beer dries on the finish with spice and artificial fruit noticeable. Disappointing stuff.

A bit of malt with a sweet berry flavor in the background. The carbonation is about right I guess, for what it is. One will be enough if I can finish it. I suppose someone will like it.

As a general concept, added flavor wouldn't hurt this beer so much if it weren't so painfully present and in the forefront throughout.

Carbonation is good but not really evident or noticable with this flavored brew. When I picked this up I thought it might be to ""berry-y"" but its not. Another good go to brew from Sam's. Hopefully they replace the cranberry lambric in the holiday pack with this one for a solid holiday assortment.","mooseisloose","Aug 01, 2009"

It was a hot day and I for some strange reason or another was craving a refreshing wheat beer. A buddy of mine gave me a ""5 pack"" cause he didn't like it so I thought I'd give one a try. Poured into a Sam's Perfect pint, it gave a better look than I expected. Slightly darker than a golden pale and much more clear than I expected. There was only a slight haze to it and it had a white fizzy head that dissapeared pretty quickly. Very little lacing on the glass of this one. It smelled pretty good. You can smell undertones of wheat, but the smell of sweet berries (I'm guessing mostly blackberries) are much stronger. The first initial sip was quite pleasant, very refreshing and sweet. But the taste seems to become blander and blander with each sip. I didn't enjoy the mouthfeel, a little fizzy for my liking, and I would consider it under average for drinkability as well.

My only complaint here is that the blackberry dominates the beer and reminds me of a malt-ernative beverage. I will say on a second sniff, there is a wheaty malt backbone, but the blackberry is doing everything it can to cover it up. The blackberry is immediately obvious on the palate; I was worried that like the smell it would be too dominant. However, that sweet berry front end transitions into a nice grainy malt finish and ends neutral, not overly sweet like I might have guessed. The mouthfeel is a little on the thinner side and the carbonation is less than what I was expecting but makes for a very drinkable beer.

The blackberry is certainly much more assertive to the nose than to the palate. Mouthfeel seemed okay, given the style, but I *would* have liked a bit more CO2, as this was nearly bereft of any at all. Drinkability is average, I suppose.

It has an immense fruit flavor that overpowers anything else other than the sweetness (there is a barely noticeable crisp backbite). If you are not a fan of sweet or fruity drinks, this will not be for you. If you a traditional witbier drinker I'd refrain also, b/c the spices and citric/lemon tartness associated w/ wits is covered up by the berry/heavier fruits.

Taste is again dominated by a fairly overwhelming amount of berry sweetness followed by a dry cereal-grain finish. I hate to be so critical of a beer, and maybe I've gotten a bad batch, or am just missing something, but the flavor is borderline-offensive. Mouthfeel makes up for it a bit, as it's got a little volume and decent carbonation. As for drinkability, I'd say moderate, as I can objectively view this as what might be a refreshing, fruity brew.

It has a crisp, pale and wheat malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry with a sweet blackberry taste. It's tastes like blackberry extract; very fake. The mouthfeel is fine.

Big aroma of blackberries, honey, orange peel, and corriander round out this very sweet aroma. Too strong of a blackberry aroma. Blackberries dominate the flavor profile but wit characteristics pop through towards the end. Lighter corriander flavors and more of a cereal malt presence than your average wit. Decent malt body with lively carbonation, the berry sweetness runs throughout. The brew drinks very easy and I can see macro drinkers liking this beer.

Perhaps Sam Adams was trying to create another fruit-forward refreshing offering for the summer months, but this is by far their worst offering.

Taste and mouthfeel were a bit too watery. Although nice and light for a summery day, its strong blackberry taste (albeit weaker in comparison to the blackberry smell) did not really make this too refreshing or crisp.
