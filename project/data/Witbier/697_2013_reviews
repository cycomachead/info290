"Pretty thin, lackluster appearance with a nonexistent head."

"Was surprised at both the weak Snell & taste in this highly rated beer. Hoegaarden and the like trump it imo"

"Not a fan of these kind of beers but they did a great job on this one"
""
""
""
""

"Unique in that it has a very slight tartness to it, like a touch of fresh clementine. Closer to a saison than the kind of yeast flavour you get in something like Allagash White, but still very savory and well-blended with the wheat on the long finish."

"Okay, I know I'm in the minority here, but I found this beer to be highly disgusting. This was literally one of the worse beers I have ever had.  I really wanted to like this beer, but honestly it was just not that good.  This is one of the few times I disagree with the Bros.  I had this beer at the Westin Inn in Napa, CA at a nice restaurant, so I figured lets give this a try! The beer started off very promising with a white color, almost the color of toothpaste. It had a very light aroma, but when I sipped it thats when it all went downhill.  The beer tasted like dirty dishwater, so bad I asked the waiter to bring me another.  I did not pour this one in hopes that maybe the soapy taste was a dirty glass, it was not. I drank the next one straight from the bottle.  It was terrible.  I don't know what spice they use in this but the spices simply do not work.  This is probably the worst beer I have ever had, which sucks because I paid $10 for it and I really wanted to like it.  I normally don't slam a beer like this, but this is putrid."

"O: Refreshing, light and spritzy like a soda, spices are present.  Would go well on a hot day or with salads, light foods and cold cuts."
""
""
""
"M - This has a lot more body than a classic Wit and is almost creamy. Feels big in the mouth and finishes medium dry."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Were this beer classified as some form of saison, I'd be all about the sourness that's present. It seems a bit out of place for a witbier, though. I can appreciate why this is rated as highly as it is, given the tendency towards appreciation for sours/wilds and intense flavors. I find this to be a very simple, club-you-over-the-head-with-a-single-flavor beer, which is not what I'm looking for in any Belgian style. Not my favorite wit."

"Bottle poured into a standard glass at a sushi restaurant in Calgary (holy crap, an Asian restaurant with something from a craft brewer! Let's hope that becomes a trend). A pale cloudy straw yellow with some rocky, sudsy white head. Aroma of citrus (orange, lemon, lime), spices (clove, nutmeg, ginger, coriander), and a malty depth not typically observed in this style ... Has a clear lager malt flavor as well. Interesting. Some bubble gum and pineapple notes vie with the aforementioned citrus. A brown spice flavor gathers steam over the course of sips (nutmeg, which is actually in the brew according to the label). Moderate body, seems on the thick side for the style, with the carbonation not violent but certainly assertive. Finish dry, rather earthy even. Unique wit. I enjoyed the emphasis on the malts and spice. My bottle may have been a tad old."

""
""

"This is one of the more delicious and refreshing beverages I've had this summer! What makes it even more impressive is that the Japanese have jumped on board with micro-brewing and put this little gem out. I would definitely recommend it for...well anything apart from a philosophical evening with friends. Very happy to have picked it up; quite satisfied."

"a pretty famous beer here, it has eluded me somehow until now. picked this up under 6 bucks over at colorado liquor mart, who is still chugging along with some hidden gems in the back there. a nice take on a wit, different than almost all of them because of (what i perceive anyway) this fresh ginger in here. a blonde beer with a golden flare, clear for the style, and while there are a ton of bubbles in it, no head really ever builds up. the nose is almost like ginger ale, its so potent to me, i have to believe there is real ginger in it. belgian type yeast is also fruity, while some malt other than wheat i think makes an appearance, giving some light caramel flavors as a base. ginger and cracked pepper in the finish, this could pass as a saison on the yeast character alone, less belgian than saison in that regard. super refreshing, and even though it looks flat, there are a lot of bubbles here in solution. my first beer from this operation is a winner, i like this a lot, different from the masses but still comfortably within what the style asks for. perfect hot weather refresher. super dig it."

"I poured this beer into my glass, it has a golden color body with a fizzy head.lt comes off as a slight grain aroma. The taste is spot on, it has a ginger and slight lemon flavor. It also has a nice spice to it. Mouthfeel is smooth and this beer is very drinkable."

"O: Subtlety is the hallmark here. Nothing is over the top, and nothing is left so far in the background you are looking. Slightly funky, slightly spicy, hints of citrus...all balanced. The light feel with minimal carbonation makes this supremely drinkable. Yes, it's a Belgian style, but it is truly Japanese in its subtle, refined character."

"Flavor is neutral in the grain department, thanks to a healthy load of wheat in the mash, with a coriander flavor front and center, taste profile wise. Orange peel comes out as well. Except for the heavy dose of carbonation is quite drinkable and enjoyable. But as a witbier I think the gimmick of high-quality craft brews from Japan that aren't adjunct lager has kind of worn off by now. I'm certainly less excited about this now than I was when I first tasted it years ago."

"Not a lot of head, and didn't last too long. But it was very drinkable and made me want another, immediately. Great summer beer."

"This is a great spiced/flavored beer. It has an unfiltered appearance and yeasty smell. The orange and allspice hits you right away and there are yeasty after-notes. It has a thick mouth feel and smooth finish. No harsh aftertaste and very little carbonation. This is a very pleasant spring/summer beer and one that will definitely find it's way into my fridge more often."
"Pours a nice fairly cloudy amber with a decent head that quickly dissipates. Nice aromatic smell that is slightly sweet and very clean. Nice taste that is also slightly sweet. I really enjoyed the smell the best. Fantastic. A very easy beer to drink with lots of flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Refreshing, a little funky to make it unique, well balanced, supremely drinkable- a great beer all around."
""
""
""
""
"O: having not had this for years, I still feel like this is a top-notch Wit.... the unique flavors of Hitachino's ales make them worth the extra $ or $$"
""
"The fizzy head that totally disappears coupled with the murky body detract from the visual appeal of this beer, but the light orange taste and aroma help redeem this. The price point is high, and makes this a questionable candidate for multiple drinks."

""

""
""

"Overall Hitachino nailed this beer down! If you didn't know any better, you'd think this was an authentic whitbeir straight out of Belgium. This is one of those all good and no bad kind of beers. Do yourself a favor and pick this up! You won't regret it."

"Poured into a standard pint glass. Good lacing. Bright golden color with one finger head. Light citrus notes. This beer finishes cleaner than any flavorful beer i have ever tried, especially of this style. Very sessionable, easy to drink, yet very good flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a quite hazy caramel yellow amber with a half finger white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of sweet wheat, orange family citrus, herbal bittering. Flavor is mild sweet wheat, caramel, mild fruit and citrus, hints of clove and Belgian yeast. Flavor tapers off quickly, but leaves a very pleasant light caramel wheat aftertaste that is quite satisfying. Medium bodied with peppery carbonation. A very nice witbier that is somewhat understated and almost a bit overcarbonated, but with mellow wheat flavor that is very enjoyable. Balanced and tasty."

"The beer pours a decent white and bubbly head before dissipating quickly but still leaves a bubbly film on the beer. The beer is a clear pale golden straw color that has slight hints of orange. The beer has a fairly complex aroma. The smells that are detected vary from hints of apricot, honey, and peach along with a slight and almost undetectable hint of citrus hops. The beer's taste is similar to its smell but not as complex. The most dominate taste is that of the Belgian yeast flavor while the flavors present in the smell are more subtle. The peach and apricot are still there but not as prominent. However, the orangish citrus hops taste is more noticeable. The beer feels smooth and a little creamy. The beer is lightly medium bodied. Overall, a fantastic beer and one that I would definitely buy again."

"Poured a cloudy pale straw with a thin layer of head. The nose has hints of wheat and yeast along with something sweet and floral. The wheat also comes through in the flavor profile along with some citrus notes. This offering is certainly light-bodied, which fits the style. This is a tasty but thin beer that is worth sampling at least once."

"I suck at giving reviews so I will keep this brief, Kiuchi Brewery has been one of my favorite breweries since discovered them many years ago and I am blessed to have a place 5 minutes from where I live that carry quite a few varieties. The White Ale is my absolute favorite ale. Thank GOD no one else buys them from the store I frequent!! Serve cold in a pint glass and enjoy!"

"Poured a gorgeous cloudy yellow with a three finger fluffy white head that stuck around and left a bit of lacing as I drank the beer. True to style and very attractive. Scents of orange peel, which is quite pronounced, grainy wheat, sweetness, chamomile, allspice and clove, fruity and yeasty esters, incredibly complex for a witbier and extremely pleasant. Taste begins with yeasty wheat bread, moving into citrus peel, slight peppery spiciness, herbal hops, and finishing with wheat cracker and a strong graininess. Aftertaste is yeasty and grainy with some herbal notes. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation, with a nice yeasty feel present as well. Overall it's an amazing witbier with a depth of complexity in it's aroma that no other witbier I've had has reached, and and an excellent flavor hitting the wibier style with a nice herbal hop character that adds some complexity there as well, the mouthfeel is standard for the style but good. It's just a fantastic witbier, with an excellent complexity to it, and it's just plain pleasant to drink. Well worth it's $5 price tag. An excellent craft beer out of Japan"
"Overall: this beer has some great stuff in it, as well as some annoying flaws. Without the harsh graininess, this might be in the running among my favorite witbiers. Unfortunately, it's just a little too rough for my taste."

"O- Pretty good brew. It doesn’t feel the best, but the aroma is very nice, and flavor is good and refreshing."
"Overall: Not how I remembered this beer. I remember thinking it was absolutely lovely...but that was years ago. The floral character is fascinating, but the lemon soda water flavor that goes along with it is not. I could smell and gaze at this beer all day, but I would rather taste another."

"Poured from bottle into tulip for hitachino bottle tasting fest 2013. Not much head golden haze color. Spicy yeast with a lager like aroma... Easy wheaty malts and spicey peppery notes. Clean and crispand sligtly citrus. Nice brew and easy to drink..."

"o- I enjoyed it....not my favorite style of beer but this is very good...recommend it"

"a little pricey but damn good and super unique."

"The flavor brings up the pepper, an expressive orange juice (one of the ingredients here), and a little bit of honey. The body is light, super-refreshing, with a great carbonation. Amazing, wonderful Witbier."

"Drinkability – Very easy drinking. One of the best witbeirs I’ve had!"

"Would buy this again if it were the same price as Hoegaarden, but since it's double the price where I am, and not easy to find, I'll pass."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky light yellow with a foamy white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, spices, and yeast. Taste is much the same with a fruity flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"Overall - This beer is really good. I wish I could have enjoyed it better (if it wasn't for my acid reflux)."
"I have always been a fan of Japanese beer and Belgian whites. Little did I know that I could have both in the same beer. I would highly recommend trying this beer if you have the chance and enjoy mild to medium flavored full bodied beers or are a fan of either style."
""
""
"Overall: Really happy about this brew. Good beer can be found all over the world!"
""
""
""
""
"The aftertaste is wonderful. I wish I had five or six of these to guzzle, but for $4.99 a bottle, it is a luxury I will have to forgo. There are other less expensive representatives of the style that make more sense, but there isn't anything here I could fault outside of the price."

"Pours a pale yellow and cloudy. Lots of yeast on the bottom of this bottle. Healthy white head at pour - at least a finger on 10 oz. The smell is floral and fruity - definitely citrus - I get strong citrus. Mouthfeel is a bit watery - mild carbonation. Flavor is very nice - again fruity up front and sweet on the end."

"24.3 ounce bottle into tulip glass, H12.06 bottle code(June 2012?). Pours hazy golden straw color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light foamy lacing on the glass. Aromas of big clove, wheat, pepper, coriander, lemon, orange zest, herbal, earth, and yeast spices. Excellent aromas with nice strength, balance, and complexity. Taste of lemon, pepper, coriander, clove, orange zest, wheat, bread, herbal, earth, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of citrus zest, pepper, coriander, clove, wheat, and yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of flavors with solid complexity. No cloying flavors at all on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent witbier. Well balanced with good flavor and complexity; extremely smooth to drink. Really enjoyable stuff."

""
"Drinkability:A fairly nice and crisp wheat beer."
""
"O: Very special, I feel very happy to be drinking this one. Way up there on the list of top witbiers"
"Truly fantastic. The bizarre part about this beer is despite it blowing me away in its category, it's not by any means a perfect beer. And you know what? Any sloppiness it may have only makes the drinking experience more fun! This is really worth checking out for the flavorful yeast alone... you can just taste the vitamins and nutrients they carry in the aftertaste, and the vivid tartiness is unlike any wit bier I've ever had. Despite the price tag (over $6), I'd say it's a beer that I'd revisit again. Welcoming in every way, it's guaranteed to improve your day with every sip, just as it did for me!"

"Jumping with freshness and supremely balanced. Grassy and lemon Fruit Pastille hops (Styrian, it turns out) notes come out as it warms; it thus shows both lemony top and base notes. As good as any wit from Belgium. HN on point."

"Overall: This is the first japanese beer that tastes great and not something flavorless. The aroma was odd at first but its still a great example of a beligum wit."

"Pours a hazy bright yellow color with a slight head which goes away to nothing fast. There is no lace left on the glass. The aroma draws you in, before you bring your nose to the glass you can smell this beer. The nose is of big time citurs, orange and a big lemon part. There is also a hint of pepper. The taste follows suit with a big and smooth sweet citrus taste with orange and lemon taking the front and middle. A little pepper spice comes in at the back end with a slight tartness at the end. The mouthfeel is crisp and well carbonated. Overall this is a very good beer, the drinkability is off the charts and you want more of this beer. A great take on the style."
""
""
"This is the second beer from Hitachino Nest that I’ve had the pleasure of imbibing (the first being Red Rice Ale), and I can report nothing but pleasant results thus far. It is a bit pricy for regular consumption. But as a beer that is on the heaviest side of refreshing, this makes for an excellent treat in these days of record high spring temperatures. I can wholeheartedly recommend this to both witbier fans, as well as those wondering what the hell the architects of Sunset Wheat were thinking."
"Pours clear gold with very little white foam. Patches on top. Subtle wheat-ness in the nose. Some straw too. Light lemon open which evolves into a thin light wheat taste. Crisp close. Virtually no bitter. Some orange peel too. Very light & flavorful. Tasty, easy drinker but not astonishing."
""
""
""

"O- Nice take on a Wit, the 5.0% ABV makes it very sessionable. Seek this out, it is not what I was expecting from a Japanese brewing company. Very well done quality brew."

"Overall: so refreshing! Perfect for summer and one that just about anyone could appreciate and enjoy"
"Pours hazy golden with a white head that dissipates quickly. There's lots of carbonation present. There's an slight, pleasing aroma of citrus, black pepper and bread. The taste? Wow. It's a pleasing slightly sweet citrus flavor with a creamy texture on the first sip. The black pepper hits you as well as the grain on the way down. All the flavors shine through and are perfectly balanced. The mouthfeel is light to medium and the carbonation aids greatly in the drinkability of this beer. I could see myself buying this again. This is a fantastic beer that I would recommend to anyone who likes a good witbier."
""
""
""
"O- I'd love it if this were a bit less expensive as I would drink it all summer long. I'm impressed with the mouthfeel and texture here above everything else, but this is an excellent example of Witbier."
""
"I knew this was a highly rated Japanese beer when I bought it, but ""Wow!"" was all I could say when I tasted it. That awesome smell came through in the taste. Near perfect white beer!!!! I'm going to be buying this beer again and again. It will now be my ideal summer white beer."
""
"Bottle. Lovely turbid pale golden pour with 2-finger fluffy white head on this. Noce aroma of hopcitrus and spices up front, including cloves and orange zest. The palate is extremely smooth, with the aforementioned hop-citrus, clove, and orange zest flavors, and the beer picking up some apparent palate heft and complexity as it warms up a little and the flavors marry a bit. This one is great Beer from Kiuchi Brewery!"
""
""

"O- more complex than most witbiers I have tried, but the price ($6 for a 12 oz) would keep me from trying again. It was good, so I don't feel it was a waste, though."

"This beer poured out as a cloudy golden yellow color with a thin white head on top. The smell of the beer has a nice floral and citrusy aroma to it with the fresh wheat aromas on the nose. The taste of the beer has some interesting lemon flavors to it with the subtle wheat coming through in the finish. The mouthfeel of the beer is nicely carbonated and light bodied. A refreshing brew for sure. Overall this beer isn't bad. I feel it's a little hyped up but maybe that's just me."
""
""
""
"Overall: I've had a few White Ales cross my palate and I've become disappointed by anything outside of Belgium. American White Ales are lacking the warm, spicy flavors that are typically associated with a Belgian Wit. Most American Whites I try are very light in body and taste. This Japanese White Ale has reassured me that I don't need to stick with the Belgians to get a quality White Ale."
""

"O: Once again, Hitachino Nest creates another masterpiece of an ale. I've never had anything quite like this - it's like they've been creating ale in a whole different universe without any input from ours. Just obscenely good stuff."
"O: This beer was great. From top to bottom this was by far my favorite witbier I tried."
"overall, i really like this. I have a specific flavor profile (basically Allagash White's flavor) that I look for when drinking whites and generally can't stand whites that don't match up (which is almost all of them). This beer has a different taste though and is making me rethink that approach."
"The feel of this beer is medium bodied and is nicely drinkable with a full flavor that will have you coming back."
"O - Overall its a great beer. Great interpretation of the style, and from Japan no less. I loved the spice. The only thing that wasnt working for me was the unusally clear color and mouthfeel. Ive seen the Hitachino beers around and will be sure to pick up the rest of the line."
"Overall a beautiful aroma and a good, but not outstanding flavor."
"I would drink it again - just because it's interesting enough; but considering this is an asian brewery, its really impressive and mostly, I think it just makes me want to see what their other beers are like."
"O- This is a seriously impressive beer, a solid take on the style but with a very distinctive flavor of its own. This is easily the best Asian beer I've had in, well maybe ever. Respect this beer."
"I really liked this one. Would not hesitate to have another."
"I tired this one at a local beer bar called Stubbies and Steins. Served in it's own glassware. Poured a cloudy burnt orange color. Smelled lively with orange peel and coriander notes. The taste was fantastic, nothing I have ever had before. Very unique and complex. Seems like coirander and some kind of candied fruit I can't put my finger on and a hint of white pepper in the finish. Very refreshing and a welcomed change to the typical witbier."
"O: A sessionable, quality though fairly simple (non-complex) witbier. I would drink this again, although it would be tough to justify given the price point (about $5.50 for a 12oz at Whole Foods)."
"O: A very nice witbier, and my first beer from Kiuchi. Easy drinking and went very well with the food I ordered."
"What is that flavor? OK, first, it tastes like tea on the back half, there is a earthy sulfurness to the midpalate, the lead off is a light bodied and sweet beer, almost like chai, it has this nutmeg / corriander flavor that dominates the finish. The finish is a little too dry, I don't know....I know these are suppose to be spiced (sometimes) and dry but this is too spiced and too dry for me. Not my favorite witbier."
"I LOVE this white ale....tastes waaaay better than Hoeegarden and Im standing by that accusation. It has so much flavor and the right amount of hops and cloves. Brilliant beer....I really recommend this beer to anyone trying white ales for the first time or fans of it...truly a delicious drink..."
"O: I’m impressed. Probably the first Japanese beer I’ve really enjoyed. What a delight to drink."
"This is a very interesting Witbier. Packed different flavors, including a bit too liberal (for me) dose of nutmeg. Its still a fantastic Wit worth seeking out."
"Poured into a Zero Gravity pilsner glass, a cloudy, bronzed yellow with a finger of foamy white head that receded to a thin layer. Typical wheaty aroma, with hints of orange and lemon zest, and a bit of spice. Crisp wheat profile on the tongue, citrus zest and piney hops, just the right amount of peppery spice. Dry and slightly bitter in the finish. Light mouthfeel, and very easy to drink."
"O - Im not a huge fan of white beers but my wife loves them so I get a chance to sample a few. This one is clearly the best I've had and certainly a class above the Hoegaarden flagship."
"All in all a very good example of a traditional European witbier and the first I have enjoyed from Japan. Would like to find more of Hitachino's products..."
"Drink (4/5) - A good example of a witbier that's experimented with the spicing - I would have liked to have gotten a bit more of the nutmeg and coriander, though. Highly drinkable and refreshing."
"comes out a nice hazy yellow with a pure white head about a finger thick. pretty good retention. the nose is a combination of floral and spice notes with a wheat backbone. getting coriander lemon zest a hint of orange peel as well in the spices. taste is running down a similar path. coriander orange peel and lemon zest with a wheat backdrop. its a damn fine combination too. coriander might be too much for some but i think its perfect. light bodied with a good dose of carbonation and some nice hop bite at the end. quite a tasty brew and worthy of the price."
"O: A truly elegant witbier. Complex yet graceful and modest in its presentation to both eyes and mouth, this is a wonderful beer I could see myself revisiting multiple times in the future."
"I tried this beer on May 7, 2011 after purchasing from the Queen's Quay LCBO outlet in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a hazy yellow colour with a half inch snow white head. The aroma was wheat malt, and spices. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. The flavour is wheat, coriander, and citrus, and very refreshing."
"Overall: This is, and has been, one of my favorite witbiers for a while. I can actually remember in 2005 having this for the first time, even though I was not into craft beer (or beer reviewing) at the time. I may not always drink witbier, but when I do, I prefer Hitachino Nest White Ale."
"Would make a great meal compliment or patio beer, but it's not something I'd pick up regularly. Leaves my mouth a bit too dry to consider it refreshing and it's just a bit overpriced in my opinion."
"D - Great stuff; like this for a light Witbier and would make a great summertime drink; it has become so popular that it's hard to get a hold of; I had this many years ago and was always a fan of the Hitachino brand of beers; glad to see it's getting the recognition it deserves"
"O: On one hand this is a light and easy drinker, on the other hand the smells/tastes are so pure it stands out. I'll definitely be picking up more."
"I also found the mouthfeel a little heavy, even kind of soapy, without a crispness I wanted, and ultimately don't know if I would buy the beer again--there are much better wits out there."
"Pours straw yellow--the same color as a macro, but oh so much more. Gorgeous fluffy head that quickly dissipates, no lacing, but enticing bubbles throughout. Nose is fruity and spicy, with ginger being the most evocative note. The taste is light and elegant, the wheat fruit notes playing off the supremely light, bubbly feel, and back again. Excellent beer overall, especially in the summer months. Looking forward to checking out other offerings from this brewery."
"Overall- Very impressed by this one to be honest, I like wheat beers where that spice flavour is not overpowering and well balanced by all the other aspects that are supposed to be in a quality wheat beer, and this one really delivered on all those aspects. There is a nice spice presence right off the bat but it is quickly balanced by that great bready wheat flavour, hints of citrusy fruits and a perfect amount of yeast in there as well, very easy drinking beer that goes down smooth and crisp. Happy I picked up a few of these because I would definitely drink this one again."
"Pour cloudy golden with a half a fingers worth of head, light carbonation. very floral with the sent of a peach. Taste of a clementine with a lingering sweet peach then orange peel finish. This is a soft beer and easy to drink, on a hot summer day would go down fast. Overall I would like to see more head but this was a great beer with great flavours and smooth finish."
"Final Thoughts: An all around well rounded beer. Sure it has a couple of notes that don't ring true with me, but they are so minor, I wouldn't mention them outside a review. You will want to pick this one up. The creepy owl impresses again."
"Overall a solid beer."
"Overall a solid whit, certainly not my favorite though (I opted for Two Bros Ebel's Weiss after finishing this beer). I expected more form such a highly rated beer (I've been saying that a lot lately). Undeniably a strong whit!"
"Thick, carbonated mouthfeel, exceptionally drinkable! The best Japanese beer I've ever had and one of the best Witbier's I've ever tried. I hope this is a regular at the LCBO!"
"Pours a cloudy light yellow with a bright white bubbly head that sticks around. Nose is orange, lemon, citrus peel, distinct yeast, grass. taste is light and refreshing, a mellow representation of the smell, not so much pinesol now. Its crisp and light and yields some of that Belgian like yeast throughout. Light bodied mouthfeel. Overall a decent Witbier, good for summer days but priced to high since its expensive to get here..."
"O - It's been a long time since I had this and my memories haven't faded with how good I thought it was this new bottle today is drinking wonderful this is a great beer for the summer and is worth getting to try sometime"
"Very pale hazy blonde, light ring of white head, no lacing left behind. Smell is yeasty with orange notes, banana, spice, coriander, nutmeg, faint malt traces. Taste is yeasty up front with spicy orange, light banana, coriander and a orangey citrus finish. Light mouthfeel, med to high carbonation, refreshing and pretty solid. Overall this was quite good, I dont love the style but I did enjoy this."
"T:"
"Pours a slightly cloudy pale orange, with a finger or so of offwhite head. Head falls to a thin layer. Nose has wheat, lots of nutmeg and a hint of citrus zest. Taste has about the same, citrus zest and abit of spritzy carbonation upfront, before a bit of softer wheat character come through with more nutmeg. Simple in most respects, but adequate proportions of the components make this a nice drinker. Carbonation is medium high, and most evident at the beginning of each sip. Refreshing and quite a nice wit."
"D: An excellent witbier, true to style yet distinctive. The rich flavour is well-balanced by crisp carbonation, making it a delicious and refreshing brew; perfect for summer afternoons."
"Pale yellow and turbid. Pouring produces a finger of pale white head that retains poorly and doesn't lace. Lots of nutmeg in the aroma. Less coriander than nutmeg, but still a lot of that as well. Citrus scents are muted, providing more of an underlying background for the spices. Flavour is tangy and lemony with a hint of orange, and strong spice notes. Mild bitterness. The coriander is much more assertive on the tongue than it is on the nose. Light-bodied with a tonne of tiny bubbles giving it a spritzy texture. This is a well made wit, though my personal preference is for something a little more heavy-handed with the orange and a lighter touch with the spices. I find this to be a very interesting take on the style."
"Light, peppery and balanced; a refreshing wit. I'm liking this more as I drink it. I was thinking at first that I wouldn't buy it again (mostly because of price) but now I'm not so sure... Would go well with a warm summer day, that's for sure. Worth checking out."
"solid and interesting but probably better on a hot day not a rainy damp one."
"Finish: Short and clean. The tartness of the lemon zest and sweetness of the orange juice finishes strong and truly stand out. Not that complex but nicely layered and refreshing."
"M: A refreshing mouthfeel! The wheat flavor is really nice & dies off a bit toward the end to finish with a thinner feel."
"If I ignore all those big-name rice lagers, I can fortunately claim this to be my first real beer from Japan, and what an entry this was. Were the price a touch lower, I'd drink this all summer; as it is, I'll at least try to keep coming back to it. Great stuff."
"O - An excellent witbier."
"Tasteless jokes aside, this brewery has done a tremendously good thing by temporarily shifting over their bottling capacity to supply water to the earthquake victims. Not only do they make great beer, but they're great people as well. Though that does mean I'll be hoarding any bottles of this nectar I come across until Japan achieves normality."
"Overall, a very enjoyable wit. I find the orange flavour to be a bit too much at times, but the flavours are generally incredibly well blended and make for a great combo. Would not be hard to drink a few of these in one go."
"Overall – Don’t get me wrong, this is a very good beer.. but I’m not sure that it’s that much better than most of the other wit beers out there. Also it was a bit on the pricey side. I’m happy I got to try it but I think I’d buy Hoegaarden for half the price the next time I’m in the mood for a witbier."
"o-fantastic beer...I liked this alot. Top wheat beer IMO."
"Nice carbonation typical of the style. Dry and overall a very nice Japanese White Ale. To be honest, I drank two in a row but I really don't see why it get's all this praise. Not sure if I'm just not getting it or if this was a bad batch..it probably could have been fresher. The LCBO seemed to have held onto it for quite some time..I'll have to give it another try some other time."
"Hitachino Nest White Ale is top-notch witbier. While there are a couple examples I have rated higher, this brewery has undoubtedly characterized the style to near perfection and even put their own slightly unique stamp on it. Since it contains orange juice, does that mean I can make it part of my breakfast? Hell, I'll find any excuse to drink this stuff!"
"More lemony and grassy than any other witbier I have had, and easily the best and most moreishly drinkable of them all."
"This is a very different, and very tasty beer."
"Overall this is an excellent wheat beer, and it certainly stands up to some of the other excellent examples we have available year round in Ontario."
"O: Super smooth and supremely drinkable. I would drink this every day this summer if it were a bit cheaper. I will definitely pick up again in the coming summer weeks regardless. Definitely recommended, and a HUGE pleasant surprise out of Japan..."
"After delays, this finally came to Ontario (not sure if delays were LCBO's fault or somehow related to the situation in Japan). Either way, I'm glad it is finally in my glass. Pours a cloudy yellow colour with thick white head. Head dissipates to a thin ring. Mild lacing on the glass. Smells of nutmeg and orange peel, with the wheat aroma. Sweet flavour, slightly tart in the aftertaste. This is quite refreshing,"
"Finishes dry, slightly tart, and remains very light. This is a damn fine witbier and absolutely great on all counts."
"Pale white with less than a finger of head. Smelled like aome fruit. maybe some oranges and apples. very interesting. Tasted not unlike liiight orange. not malty hoppy or any notes of those. maybe a bit resiny. Mouthfeel was lacking in my opinion. I like a thicker witbier and this feel short with quite a thin palate. Overall I liked it enough to give it an B+. The mouth feel was average but everything else has me have hope for those japanese breweries."
"This is an outstanding bier to sample periodically but, limited due to cost."
"Not my favorite looking beer... pale yellow with little head developing at all, even with a swirl. Otherwise, this is a very interesting and good beer. Nose has an almost tea-like quality to it from what my guess would be whatever spices or hops they use in this. Flavor is refreshing, fruity, sweet, and spicy all at once... a nice flavorful witbier here for sure. It tastes more like the European witbiers that I've had than their American imitations. Very drinkable and super flavorful for a 5% beer... I have to try more from this brewery."
"Really a wonderful brew, recommended. I'm looking forward to trying other ""Nest Beer"""
"One of the more floral/perfume-y examples of the style I've sampled. Very drinkable, but missing a little something (derived from yeast?) compared to the best examples..."
"D: Refreshingly drinkable; probably the best Belgian style wit I've had! Almost thirst quenching -"
"Notes: one of the best and unique witbiers ive had. love the intensity of the ingredients"
"D - Highly drinkable, perhaps sessionable. Three or four would be easy to do. This may become a beer I keep around in the fridge for those nights where I want to kick a few back."
"On the lighter end of medium bodied with a blast of peppery coriander spice that lingers throughout into a slight dry finish. There is a decent bread/yeast presence that adds to the mouthfeel as well as some slight banana and citrus flavor. As the palate adjusts to the spice there is a prominent lemon juice/rind character that balances things out a bit. Slightly tart and refreshing making it pretty quaffable. A good attempt at the style but a bit too heavy on the spice for my liking."
"Pours a light haze, pale/off yellow with some carbonation. This smells fantastic! Sour and malt aromas cut through mostly. Very fresh, light silky sweet malt flavors. Some lemon/light citrus flavors come first followed by some grain/orange peel flavors provide a really nice finish. This would go perfect with any asian dish you make. While there's some carbonation, I tend to feel like it's nat as potent as the belgian counterpart."
"Comments: As a variation of the Wit style, Hitachino Nest White is undoubtedly original. I like that the brewer takes risks, many of them paying off - its mouthfeel is fresh and smooth plus the appearance is delightful - but the intense spice profile is a couple notches too high. Overall, it is a pleasant ale with one noticeable flaw."
"A tart burst of citrus- lemon juice and orange zest- greets the nose, backed up with cloves, tangy wheat and tangy yeast. Tastes much like it smells, with the additions of brief moments of earthiness and a lemon-lime soda sweet character. A bit of a band-aid aftertaste, particularly as it gets warmer, but not enough to be too distracting. Light and almost wispy on the tongue with a clean finish, it made a pretty nice match for the sushi."
"Overall, very impressed with this beer. I had never heard of the brewery or the beer, but definitely recommend it if you come across."
"Overall- definately an unconventional but pleasing wit. Drinks like a Pilsner. Just has no wheat character. I applaud it for not being over the top w/ coriander, if its there at all."
"A very good witbier and probably my favorite beer in general."
"Sorry but the charms of this beer totally escape me, and it's the 2nd kind I've tried from the brewery and I'm just not getting it. Poured a large 3"" white head. Smells like a sour beer. Taste is a little sour and there's really not much else to it. Bad sample, maybe? But Trader Joe's has a high turnover of this stuff so I doubt my sample sat around too long."
"Buy this."
"I love this brewery - so far most everything I've had from them is artfully produced and well worth a try."
"This is the flagship beer of Kiuchi brewery, and with the light body that suitably flows underneath lovely bubbling, it's understandable why. The JapanQuest is happily underway!"
"Great summer beer, very sessionable, also fine craft beer starter for a newbie."
"D: A very interesting beer, definitely enjoyed drinking this one and could go for a few more."
"drinkability; Pretty tasty but complex and rich, still an easy drink and sits well with me."
"Definitely not a sweet wit, but a spicy one. However, the orange character is still there and this one goes down extremely easily. Recommended."
"D - Interesting blend of spices manifesting in the nose and on the palate. Refreshing and drinkable as a Witbier should be but guess I'd prefer it a tad less sour (4)"
"Feel: This beer is great very complex with a light and super creamy body that goes down really well."
"D = Really an easy drinker that behaved more like a summer lager than an ale. The citrus notes can be a real crowd pleaser. I highly recommend this with sashimi or oysters on the half."
"light to medium bodied mouthfeel. drinkability is good, i would have no trouble having a couple of these."
"a very drinkable wit, definatly worth a try. just as good if not better than most belgians."
"Pours a very hazed orange yellow color with a thick fizzy white head and a really good amount of lacing. Smells of oranges, yeast, spice and wheat. Tastes of oranges, spice -- coriander and maybe black pepper, wheat and a little hops. Mouthfeel is medium with good body and substantial carbonation. Drinkability is high."
"The beer pours a cloudy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, citrusy scent along with a bit of orange peel and coriander spice. It's light and refreshing with a hint of lemon zest. The taste is good as well. It has a very drinkable pale and wheat malt flavor; light and refreshing. The citrusy flavor is outstanding along with a dry and fruity yeast finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a damn good witbier. It's winter now. I'd rather be drinking this while enjoying a nice sunny day."
"Notes: Goes amazing with food.... Crisp, refreshing, tangy, and tons of palette scrubbing bubbles. And, incredibly drinkable. Goes down easy!"
"Drinkability: Quite liked this one. Refreshing, easy to drink and good flavors. The price point is a bit high, but this is a quality brew. Went down quickly."
"Drinkability at this simple ABV is highly desirable."
"Overall a very tasty, if not altogether unique white beer."
"D - Mild and very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Very high, and the low ABV keeps it from being too dangerous... perfect for a summer day."
"Poured from a 330ml bottle with some weird date coding into my Ommegang Goblet. Very cloudy, grapefruit juice colored with about a finger of white head that dissipates quickly leaving little lacing. Smells VERY lemony, and spicy. Very appealing nose. Flavors are what you'd expect from a wit, though leaning towards lemon rather than orange. Nice gingerbread cookie like finish. Lingers. Very drinkable and refreshing. Great example of the style."
"Notes: Very pleasantly surprised by this Belgian style brewed, apparently, in Japan. This is easily the best beer that I have ever had which was brewed in Japan!"
"If you love grapefruit, you may love this wit bier. There is only a minor hint of bitterness. This is a very good beer with a lot of flavor."
"D- This was an amazing drinkable beer. First time I have had something from this company and I was glad to have had the chance to have it. Do yourself a favor and try this beer if you haven't already!"
"This is one i'll return to again and again, it never gets old to me. This is unique and eye-opening, especially if you think you've tried every Witbier out there. Give it a try with an open mind..."
"There's a nice medium-bodied creaminess to it, but it might be one of those white beers that could benefit from a slice of orange. I have a rule that states that if you need to put a piece of fruit in your beer to make it taste better, then just drink a beer that tastes better. That said, I'll drink a different beer."
"A Witbeer from Japan? Oh - I have to try that! Be forewarned that this is no typical Belgian Wit. It is a hazy golden color with a nice frothy white head that goes to nice lacing with nice carbonation. The aroma is of spice and slight fruit. The flavor is vell spiced dominated, some citrus at the end. A top notch wheat brew from Japan!"
"I'm no brewer, but what is so hard about making a witbier? Í'm sure it's not easy but, no one seems to be able to match and defintely not surpass Hoegaarden. Having said that, this is one of the better ones. The only major letdown for this is the coriander is way too much out in front - on the nose and the palate. However, I love coriander so on a personal level I don't mind this, but if you're looking for a well-balanced traditional wit, it may be a let down. Carbonation and look are very good though. Soo close..."
"Tasted from bottle at Lush Roscoe. Pours pale orange with a thin white head that recedes quickly leaving minimal lace around the glass. Nose of yeast, orange, and spices, including coriander, cinnamon, and a hint of nutmeg. The orange flavors come through nicely with the spices mostly subdued until the back where nutmeg, coriander, and a hint of cardamom come through. The body is light with average carbonation, an oily texture, and a medium spiced finish."
"Tangy and refreshing, great for a hot day."
"Overall, HN White Ale is an extremely unique beer in that it tastes like Five Alive without the sweetness. Bold and unusual flavours with tons of character - this is what good craft beer is all about."
"A soft and compelling summer drink, went well with seafood barbecue."
"Mouthfeel is light but nicely carbonated. Very refreshing. Highly drinkable. I could easily drink this all day. A masterful white ale. I would love to find this on tap."
"Poured a bright hazy yellow with an orange hue. White, fizzy head that dissipates quickly, but leaves a light white cap. Very wet lacings that have no chance at sticking to the glass. A variety of aromas, lemon, orange, wheat and spice. The citrus lemon being the most dominant, but not so much the other aromas don't come through. Big citrus flavor, again with lemon and orange flavors up front a solid wheat body and spicy clean finish. A very refreshing ale, particularly on the hot day that it was sampled. Easy to drink."
"D: The beer is very thirst quenching and refreshing."
"Slightly more texture and flavor than an American Pilsner but comparable in overall experience."
"D - very drinkable. Good wit, interesting touches, not too strong in any direction."
"I am a devout Craft Beer drinker and have recently begun to explore some interesting Asian crafts. I was originally introduced to this beer at a wine bar and it was paired with a hearty artisan Mac and Cheese. The bottle itself is interesting but once you smell the aroma you know you are in for a treat, because it is loaded with hints of citrus, sourdough bread, and spice. It is like smelling summer. The color of the beer is what it is to be expected (cloudy pale yellow) and obviously unfiltered with a medium frothy head. The flavor of the beer is not overwhelming; notes of a ""warhead"" candy are delicately balanced with floral and yeast. The Asian flavor comes out with some bitter orange and eastern spices to create a unique profile on the palate. Although the forward taste passes quickly, the aftertaste is creamy and refreshing. This is a good beer to introduce to a woman who doesn't like beer, because the flavor is mild with hints of sweetness and sour (like a lemon drop). A few days ago I tried this beer again and paired it with spicy BBQ tri-tip and pork, which totally worked because the refreshing characteristics really cut through the spicy-fatty meat. It was a summer hit with fairly tough beer critics! Crisp, light, refreshing, and almost too easy to drink. I actually let it come to room temp as well to test its drink-ability, and was happy to find it still tasted pretty darn good at 67 degrees"
"Poured a pale hay yellow with a scant and short lived white head. Mildly hazy, as it should be. Although the aroma smells decent, like lemonade mixed with orange juice, some coriander, and wheaty funk, the taste is an epic fail. I've never tasted a witbier like this and it's like a spritzy lemony sports drink. Nothing like a witbier that I'm looking for. Perhaps I'm looking for the wrong witbier but this did absolutely nothing for me."
"D: Definitely a full-bodied wheat ale leaning towards a wild ale. Sticks out in flavor from the bunch of Witbiers I've tried, and I'm glad I got a new perspective on the style from this beer."
"D - very well done Wit, very unique and a great change from most run-of-the-mill Witbiers. great for sipping on a hot day."
"D: A very good witbier. The price ($5) precludes me from buying this often, but it's a real nice ale."
"D: Very consumable, especially in the right environment. The drinkability score was brought down once I experienced slight flavor fatigue."
"Pours a very murky straw color with a cap of white foam that disapears immediately, leaving little to no head and lacing. Smell is wonder - floral, yeasty, biscuty, bready, lemony, vinous, apple, sweet, tart, acidic all in one. The aggressive scent does not signify the most aggressive taste... all the components from the scnet are there, but a tad more muddled. The tart, acidic and sweet notes a bit more present in the taste as well as the biscuityness. Medium bodied, slightly oily feeling and dry finnish. A unique beer at the top of the witbier foodchain."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium with a medium finish. The beer has a very bright, crisp, clean flavor. It is one of the better white ales that I have tried in awhile. Thank you DIM for getting me this beer."
"$4.89 for 11.2 oz is fucking expensive but if you've ever chiefed the good pots you'd know that you get what you pay for, at least in most cases."
"A fantastic example of a Wit that can hold its own with the belgians and Allagash white. This is also the first craft Japanese beer I have experienced and lets just say, I'll be back for more."
"Offering does have some very admirable charecteristics. Enjoyed more as the drink progressed, however not a desirable offering to have agian."
"Over all i highly recommend this beer to any lover of beer regardless of preference of style"
"Pours a vibrant but cloudy orange-yellow with a light, fizzy white head that mostly remains throughout the drink. Aroma is cloves, lemon, rose and some other fragrant spices. The flavor is lemon straight up with spices in the aftertaste. Its light-medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation ends up a bit prickly and semi-dry. I don't have too much experience with Wits as I usually don't like them and end up being a bit bland, that was not the case here. This had lots of flavor, mostly lemon and somewhat tart, and it was extremely aromatic. If it were cheaper I'd probably purchase this on a regular basis."
"D- I could drink this one again, but it wouldn't be something I'd search out. I think the sour/funky citrus thing is about the only thing from really liking this one."
"Value: Pricey, but you get what you pay for. I'm hard-pressed to think of a witbier I've enjoyed this much."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and the drinkability was good."
"D: Light summer beer, that goes down relatively easy. The tart lemony flavor is a bit strong and might prevent me from having more than one of these."
"Poured a cloudy yellow color into tulip glass. Smell of citrus is definite. Taste of grapefruit and orange on first sip. Mouthfeel is light with a Belgian beer flavor. Drinkability is very good. Good backend and a refreshing taste. A very good Witbier that I could drink a few more of. Definitely very good since I got the first pour from the fresh tap."
"D: Extremely drinkable beer with a very refreshing flavor. This beer is flavorful but subtle."
"The previous time I had this beer with some Japanese food I remember enjoying it more."
"D: Very much so - I enjoyed two myself. Can't wait to drink this more frequently when the weather warms up!"
"A very interesting take on the style!"
"Ugh. Very disappointing. I hated their Red Rice, and don't think highly of this one. I probably spared the lady friend from a lousy experience. Didn't seem to be a bad bottle, just not my style. No thanks, I'll just grab a Blue Moon next time. (Ouch). I do, however, love their bottles."
"Wow, I will say it again: The flavor is vibrant, juicy, and unique. Like boozy sunshine in a bottle."
"D - A very nice, sessionable witbier. Would drink again without hesitation."
"D: Could certainly knock back a few of these on a nice warm sunny day, especially along with some spicy food."
"I enjoyed this beer quite a bit and found it to be very quaff-able. I think it would be great for a nice summer day on the patio or while working the grill. I'll definitely seek this one out again."
"The instant smell of lemon and coriander overwhelm you instantly. A solid 1 finger head fills my pint glass. A japanese wheat beer is quite the conundrum, but very surprising. It has a light yellow hazy appearance. The lemon draw is sharp as you swallow, but very pleasant. An extremely tasty brew."
"This brew pours a pale straw hue with decent carbonation that leaves a two finger bubbly head and nice lacing all around the glass,wow what an aroma its full on citrus,orange peel,lemon zest and the feintest bit of corriander which i rather like and to be honest this has to be one of the nicest,strongest smelling witbiers ive smelt really inviting,it has a nice easy mouthfeel which slides down with tastes of citrus,orange peel,lemon & lime bitters and lemon barley,i dont usually give too many 5's for any beer but i only bought one of these brews and as soon as i finished it i wanted another one so bad its not funny,overall a really tasty brew that will buy more of."
"Poured from a 750 ml bottle, this one was a real treat. (Almost better than a European). A thick yellow translucent color with a one finger head that coats rather well. Smells of citrus and orange peel fill the nose followed with a touch of coriander. Sweet taste in the beginning going down to a slight spiciness. Excellent"
"Poured a rich yellow haze with a spectacular head. Smell is a deep mix of subtle lemon and wheat. Consistency is truly inspirational. The carbonation literally hangs in the glass, creating a suspended cloud of headyness. If you like white ale (and it's my favorite), this is a homerun. Has a tasty lemon flavor with a distant accent of slight tartness. The combination of the two gives it a truly unique appeal. I'll give it Japan here, this is a mindblower. Picked up a pint of it at ShopRite Liquors in Oakland (AMAZING selection btw). The description they used on the display was simply ""Some say it's the best beer", and I think they might be right. Oh, and the drinkibility is off the charts."
"Wow! What a pleasant surprise! I tried this beer on-tap at a new restaurant near my apartment called ""Kushi."" I was in the mood for a light, white ale - and this beer definitely delivered. It was crisp and refreshing. Nice deep yellow color, with a minimal foam head. Smell was of apples and jasmine. Taste was tart and light, a little sour, but well balanced. I'd have this beer again, and again, and again.."
"Drinkability is good and I can imagine this would be perfect on a sunny summer day. I just probably wouldn't share with the casual beer drinker. Too tart/sour for most."
"Recommended."
"Pours a bright golden color until the settled yeast is shaken up and added to make a hazy pale yelloow hue. The nose is that of sour lemons and wheat,there is definately some tartness on the nose also. Lemons and orange peels, along with corriander on the palate, wheat is present and a sour yeasty taste, almost like a lemon sweet tart. Light bodied and extremely refreshing, great beer for the summer or anytime of the year."
"Beautiful appearance for the style. Light gold and hazy with a thick white head. Great retention and lacing. The aroma is complex with a strong floral/spicy element mingling with a nice citrus quality. Loads of orange peel flavors blended with a strong spiciness. Ginger seems pretty dominant in my opinion but there's a lot going on here. A strong carbonation makes this one nice and refreshing. A great/unique representation of the style that I think is a love it or hate it kind of beer. Personally I don't care for the flavors but I think somebody who likes the spicy/perfumy wits will definitely love this one. A must try for wit beer fans and something I'd recommend to anyone in general to try just once. My first beer from this brewery and I look forward to trying the other beers they have to offer."
"O: Price and adherence to the style be damned, this is as good as Witbiers get, sorry Belgium and Allagash. This is the most interesting *beer* I've had yet, and from Japan, color me shocked. If you love regular Wits, watch out, this one may be an acquired taste. This beer is downright funky, and takes me the closest to beer nirvana I have ever been."
"M - Nice, medium bodied. Serves the flavor profile well."
"Superb drinker. Several of these would be great for a hot muggy summer night. But it's still warming, from the spiciness, for this cold winters night. I wish I could get it by the six-pack."
"Whipped up froth gets to about one finger of pure white, then rapidly fizzles down to the surface, very little lacing left behind. Fuzzy light orange to yellow liquid, easy to see the particulate floating inside, given lighter hue it's just about entirely opaque. Clove, coriander, cinnamon stick and orange zest do most of the work in the nose, straw, meadow grasses and garden herbs right there, close to earthy at moments, apricot and peach pit all for fruit scents. Medium-bodied, the carbonation doesn't lift as much as paste the liquid to the roof of your mouth. Sour orange, grapefruit citrus an eye opener, coriander, ginger spice, white pepper, wheatgerm, develops just the right amount of rougher texture to extend the finish. More tart than many witbiers but none the less enjoyable for it."
"While maybe a tad reserved on the spice quotient, this is still one pleasantly slavish ode to the Belgian style - wheaty, fruity, and spicy, all in a manner that deserves quiet contemplation, i.e. my friend's Chicago backyard before a Lollapalooza show, instead of the pithy, way too trendy club afterwards."
"This holds its own as a wit for sure, the nutmeg is a curious extra touch. I can't stand behind it 100% though, for me it doesn't quite work for the style, it adds an interesting contrast, but puts a huge cramp in the overall harmony."
"Drinkability - One of these is plenty for me, I am sure if I was more used to it I could handle much more, its probably not the beer here, its me."
"Through the roof drikability, easily the best Japanese beer & or Wit I've had, period"
"not what I expect from a Japanese white ale, keeping that in mind I didn't know what to expect from Japanese micro's. this is the second beer I've had from this brewer and I must admit I'm looking forward to my third"
"The 11.2 oz disappeared quite fast."
"I got a finger of bone-white head with low retention off of my pour. Nose had a great citrus-y zestiness: lemon peel, orange peel, lime. It was like air freshener in a glass, but not in a bad, cloying way. Color was a cloudy honey-yellow. Mouthfeel was medium with an attention-getting bite of ginger (?), no wait, nutmeg (!), cutting right through all of the citrus. The nutmeg really carried the flavor, but it also set up a very dry finish. This would be great on a hot, humid summer day or with sushi. Ah, sushi! Pass the salmon!"
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was very light /white colored for sure. The smell of this beer was kinda sour and fruity. Very effervescent looking at first but then the head decayed really fast and was gone. The taste was fruity and slightly sour also. I guess it is an okay beer for a wheat, but not my cup of beer, I will not buy again."
"D: Fairly easy to drink, but all of those spices may make it hard to have more than a couple. Still, a very interesting wit that should be tried by any fan of the class."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Smell is sweet, citrus with spices. Taste is a good mixture of fruit and spices, quite tasty. Feels great in the mouth and I could drink these all night. Overall this is a high quality beer that is worth checking out."
"Gold with a bit of haze and a constant stream of bubbles supporting a soapy, bright white head. The cap thinned quickly to a fine skim. Aromas of citrus zest, cloves, bread, grain and straw. The flavour was milder than the aroma with notes of lemon and clove, bread and malt sweetness. Light bodied with moderate carbonation. Slightly soapy texture. Refreshing with a nice aroma."
"Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle with an interesting label into a chalice, beer is a cloudy straw color with a thin, yet continuously bubbling head. The nose is dominated by ginger but there are also subtle nuances of citrus and peppery spice. The flavor starts out grainy and moves to the flavors contained in the nose; ginger again being very apparent. Light orange citrus flavors and just a touch of yeasty, peppery spice. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a smooth yet aggressive carbonation. Overall a drinkable witbeer, different with the ginger presence, not my favorite but interesting none the less."
"D: I haven't had many white ales but this one seems to set the bar high up there. This was very enjoyable to drink and I encourage others to give it a try."
"Overall this was a solid beer that I could revisit in the future. Worth a shot."
"I really enjoyed this beer. Thumbs up for a good Japanese brewery!"
"The taste was great, burst of orange at the start, and wonderfully smooth finish. This is a great white."
"Overall a decent wit. Say too sour for my taste."
"What strikes me the most about it is the strong lemon presence which I've not found to be this dominant in other examples. It heightens the refreshing qualities of the beer and really elevates this one to the next level."
"Drinkability - This is the ""winner"" of my ""summer beer 2009"" unofficial event. Hitachino has impressed me, not only a huge diversity within the styles, but also the aroma and balance while still exploring the ""edge""."
"Not bad. A good example of the style from the Japanese that is quite quenchable on a hot day."
"Pours a darker golden than you might expect for the style, and with a nice white head. I've always really liked this beer as a very bold interpretation of a wit. It's loaded with orange peel and has a quite bold, rounded flavor for the style. This is more serious than so many light quaffable summer versions. More boddy than most, but still refreshing with hints of lemon and lots of zingy orange with a bitter finish. Complex but nicely drinkable."
"Over all I am glad I tried it and I am actually going to buy a pack down the street right now."
"Drinkability is good, but might be better if the spice did not overwhelm the palate. Great unique white!"
"Pours a light golden, slightly hazy from the yeast. Has a thin white head. Smell is VERY aromatic. Smells like coriander and fresh flowers. Quite nice. Taste is light and wheaty, very flowery, crisp finish. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, medium carbonation. Drinkability is not as good though, I suspect the flavors would get cloying after awhile. Still at 12oz at a time, its quite good."
"this beer pours a light straw color. Fizzy pure white head blankets the surface. Bubbles bloom throughout the session. I smell fine pilsner malts in the beginning but the aroma takes on what appears to be a strange BO type smell to me. I have heard others descibe a barnyard scent in beers maybe this is it. There is a certain floral grassy like smell that I have never encountered. It may be strange but it is bold and assertive which I like. The taste is not like your typical wit. It is very spicey kind of like a light tripel. There is some pepper, a strong taste of turmeric powder, cinnamon. And nutmeg flavors throughout and just enough hops to make it slightly bitter. There seems to be a lot of carbonation to this beer from the looks but it does not overtake your mouth. I would say it is a typical Mouthfeel for the style. I will not buy this again but it is very interesting. Not your typical wit."
"Refreshing with a sweet malty finish on the dry side. Good and easy to drink. It went well with sushi today and I would have this again."
"Taste is like a light wheat beer, nothing too special, no hop taste. Overall I'd say it's one of the best Japanese beers I've had, but that's not saying too much."
"d: very drinkable, nice variation from normal witbiers and refreshing"
"It's been a few years since I saw this brewer on the local shelves. Poured cloudy copper-yellow with an aggressively bubbly almost bleached-white head that faded in a few breaths. Citrus and honey on the nose, a bit of malt, and a tiny hint of some spice. Tastes like tart frozen yogurt on the tongue, almsot exactly... thing original tart hagaan daaz frozen yogurt. Then a bit of malt at the end. Heavily carbonated which I'm guessing compensates for the very thin consistency. This isn't a bad beer, it's not a great beer, but it's still a brewer I have a keen interest in trying as often as I can."
"Serving type:720ml bottle"
"Drinkability is good. If this continues to be available I'll be drinking it all the time."
"Drinkability: A nicely refreshing and nicely orange-y wit! Pass the Spider Maki and Rainbow Maki, please."
"D- Such a drinkable beer. Light, complex and refreshing. This beer is by far the best beer I have had out of Japan and one of the best beers I have had period! Does true justice to the Belgian Wit style. This beer is doing wonders to the Indian food I am currently eating. Wonderful beer!!"
"D: It's better than bad, it's good."
"overall just an average wit that tastes better than it looks."
"Poured from a bomber bottle into my dimpled mug. After stirring up the yummies on the bottom of the bottle, appears a rather cloudy, muted yellow color with a solid two fingers of fluffy, dense white foam. Smells and tastes of coriander, spicy, peppery yeast, lightly toasted grains / wheat, orange peel and lemon oil, and a touch of ginger. Really nice! This wit is just about full bodied and there is no question that it is amply carbonated. A fantastic example of the witbier style."
"Luckily, for my tastes, the citrus is the dominant flavor, while the spice (which I'm still only picking up ginger) takes the background. Very light body with fine carbonation. Very tasty witbier."
"Crisp and smooth, very refreshing and drinkable."
"Best Japanese beer I've had yet. I'm more open to trying more from the land of the rising sun in the future."
"Refreshing is the best word to summarize this, lots of flavor though and put together well as not to be astringent. Definitely one to re-visit on a hot day with some shellfish or other seafood."
"This had a pleasant hoppyness to it with a good blend of citrus. Creamy, smooth, yet bold. Relatively dry and very refreshing. There's a real burst of flavor right off the bat. Exceptional brew."
"I enjoyed this beer. Couple this with their Espresso Stout and their Sake Beer, they offer some solid beer. Easily drinkable, it would be great for a hot day."
"Feel and Drinkability: Light in body with higher levels of carbonation as is appropriate. Finish is just right, I can see this being very refreshing on a hot day. Curacao tones in the finish with a twist of mint. This one is easy to drink, though I doubt I'll be buying it again anytime soon or at all for that matter, especially considering the price at about $8 a bomber. It was nice to try but I'd rather go for Wittekerke, or even better Southampton Double Wit...better beers, more volume less money."
"Overall a suprisingly good brew. I'd love to see this offered at my favorite Japanese restaurants instead of the usual Kirin or Sapporo."
"Pours a cloudy straw in color with a pretty big head which works down to 1/8"" around the rim and some nice lacing. The smell is made up of mostly orange and spicy ginger with some yeasty notes mixed in. The flavor is excellent with a rather dry malt profile some subtle spicing and a good citrus / ginger bite. The mouthfeel is a bit heavy due to the high level of carbonation but it is still quite pleasant, and this could easily be sessioned if it was a bit less of a hit on the wallet. One of the best Witbiers I have ever had, strong to the Belgian roots with some Asian tweaks."
"MF&D - not many complaints, I just havent had that much experience with witbier to know whether this is a knockout mf&d or not. the carbonation is crisp and the body perfect, making a really truly creamy beer that is great."
"M&D-Little over-carbonated goes down easy and is very easy to drink this os one i would like to have around as a session beer and pairs amazingly with sushi"
"sort of palate cleansing - i don't know about the sustained drinkability of this beer, but one was really good -(expensive - $9/bottle) - i followed it with another chimay blue"
"D: At 5% ABV this is an easy drinker. I could easily put down a few. The pepper character might get tiresome after that though."
"Overall, a wonderful AM surprise, should pair well with lighter cuisine... expected something different given the style, but would take this any day. Cheers."
"To anyone on the fence about trying this beer, I recommend it highly. You will not regret the price of entry. Though you may regret how much the beer will encourage you to spend that money again and again."
"Hitachino Nest White Ale is a slightly hazy pale straw-colored ale with a white head that quickly vanishes. The aroma is strong with orange peel and lemon peel. There is a spicy smell of coriander and ginger. It is light, bubbly and dry in the mouth. The finish seems acidic. It tastes very citrusy. This reminds me of lemonade and iced tea mixed. It has a lot of zing. It's loud and clean. I really think I detect ginger. I'll drink this in the summer. I'll also make sure I have this on hand the next time I get sushi. It would be perfect."
"Appearance is hazy golden with a thin white head that quickly dissapates. Smells of peaches, pears, malt. The taste is sweet malts and fruity--particularly peaches with pears & lemon. Mouthfeel is a little too carbonated & acidic, which in my experience is typical of the Japanese beers. This is a drinkable brew, but watch out for the burning carbonation."
"Very enjoyable drink that's light and easy but feels full. Will drink again."
"Aroma is crisp, malty, slightly fruity, very like a good pilsner. Appearance is nothing special - typical clear golden yellow, average white head that does not hang around. Flavor, however, is better than expected - typically malty but well-rounded with fruity hints and just a touch of hops and a whisper of sweetness. Texture is pleasantly tingly and has a good firm consistency."
"Pretty drinkable, an interesting white. Reminds of of Southampton's Double White."
"D: decent drinkability. not a first class example but a good enough one from japan."
"Poured a cloudy pale yellow color with a thick head. Nice notes of spice and citrus that aren't overwhelming but grasp you to take a sip. Great wheat flavor and nice crispness with full body mouthfeel. Easy to drink and well balanced. My first from this brewery and really impressed. Colorado doesn't sell it but always looking for more."
"Pours a cloudy bright yellow color body. Foamy white head, big bubbles, lasting. Spicy floral aroma, maybe coriander. Very spicy nose. Spicy floral taste, some lemon. Surprisingly light tasting. Medium bodied, not too watery. Spices in the aftertrste. Fizzy palate. Not too fruity except the lemoniness. Almost tart, but not quite."
"Overall: Honestly, this is closer to some sort of malt beverage made by Mikes Hard Lemonade than a beer. Creative is really the only word to describe this ""beer"". Impressive"
"Pleasantly surprised by this beer. Definitely recommended."
"Overall, something different that is highly drinkable. I could see myself drinking this again."
"Don't drink and review."
"Color was hazy yellow and possibly just slightly over carbonated, but just slightly. The aroma was sweet and spicy with hints of fruit and maybe straw?. The taste was much of the same with a smooth medium body. This is one of the more interesting witbiers that I have come across so far."
"This wasn't bad. Not as great as the Red Rice Ale (in my opinion), but worth having. Another Japanese Heff type beer. It was a little too citrusy for my palette. Wasn't bad, but anymore would have made it a Framboise. Enjoy it where you would a Heff, if you want to try something different. But personally - if I want a Heff - this won't do."
"Pours a hazy pale yellow with 1-2 fingers head, nice and foamy and quickly dissipates, leaving some slight lacing. Nose is immediately cloves and malts, with slightly sweet hints of banana. Taste matches with a very good balance of classic witbier flavors, nothing's out of place. Not too much citrus either, which I find in many others. Very smooth and light going down, super drinkable."
"Drinkablity: Nice wheat beer with a good body to it."
"Ultimately, it does not taste as good as it smells. I might not buy this one again, but has piqued my interest in this brewery."
"Definitely try this one if you get a chance!"
"This beer had a nice citrusy taste and a spicy taste, however, was not really like hoegaarten or blue moon. This beer was nice and crisp. I really suggest it to anybody who likes white ales."
"The flavor is crisp and light, starting out with a sugary malt and citrus hop balance that gives way to a fruity peach, mandarin orange, & mango aftertaste. The finish is slightly dry and bittersweet, but the body is well-carbonated and refreshing, giving the light mouthfeel a much-needed prickliness. Not a bad Wit overall, as I could see myself tossing back a few of these on a warm summer day."
"Pours a pale, straw gold hue that is so cloudy I would describe the body as chalky and minimal head that stuck around with minor lacings. A light citrus smell with a good amount of spice (think pepper or something heavy smelling). A soft, mellow body, not as thick but as gentle as a marshmellow. Very smooth, almost creamy, with a pleasing citric twang mixes with mild spices to create a smooth, easy-passing beer that is refreshing. Not like most wits where you seem to be crushed with orange peel and clove; a laid-back, balanced beer that I could just drink all day as summer winds down."
"Drinkability- At 5% this is a very drinkable beverage highly recomend."
"My sample was a poor witbier. Obviously I received a bad bottle judging by other reviews. Maybe someday I will try this again."
"in my experience, this is one of the best wit beers of all time. hazy straw colored with a nice white head that leaves nice lace. hitachino beers tend to glow, and this one has a weird pinkish hue in the beer and the head. maybe i'm nuts. nose is full of corriander and orange zest. taste is wheaty for sure, with corriander and orange in the front, and some ginger and a tiny bit of pepper in the back. light, spritzy and creamy at the same time, and a nice, long finish. hell of a beer, i wish it was a bit less expensive, or i would knock 'em back all day, all summer. great with humboldt fog."
"D: Very drinkable. I liked their take on the witbier as it was more fruity than coriandery."
"D: 3.5"
"D: I would surely make this a regular at my favorite sushi joint, it'll hav e to be a fight between Chimay. by far the best Japanese ale I've ever had"
"D- I liked it, my girl friend loved it."
"Wow! Delicious. I was not expecting such a refreshing and unique brew. The ginger flavor plays a big part in the taste, and along with the high carbonation, gives it the feeling of an alcoholic ginger ale. And that's a compliment here. It never gets overly sweet or bitter, but has a good amount of peppery spice and a bubbly mouthfeel. I could drink this all night. I will most certainly seek out other Kiuchi beers."
"D: I was not impressed but will look for this on tap to give it another go."
"Pours an incredibly hazy/murky orange-yellow color, head fades really fast, no lacing to speak of. There's so much going on in the nose on this beer...orange, ginger, coriander, clove...wow! Taste is an amazing citric blast, some wheat flavors, some lemon zest, and a hint of pepper. Crazy-active carbonation, really refreshing tiny bubbles, and just a hint of bitterness at the end. A little sticky, yet somewhat drying. I picked this up on a whim from The Wine Gallery near Fenway Park, but if this was something I could get more easily, I'd be drinking this all summer. Incredibly tasty, and very refreshing. Awesome beer!!"
"D - An easily drinkable and interesting example of the style. The aroma qualities in particular are excellent; easily the best smelling Witbier I have had."
"D- No other wit I have had is like this. I definitely recommend trying it at least once(after that you will be hooked for more). Perhaps not an everyday beer, but definitely one I want to have more often."
"D - Straight forward and easy to drink. More on the spicy side than the citrus but blended nicely."
"White Nest appears a hazy pale lemony yellow color with a large, fine-fuzzing white lid. The nose is all sweet, fruity, and spicy. Sweetly floral and lemony with light wit-y yeast and bold clove and nutmeg spices. A luciously soft and creamy fuzzing carbonation fills the medium body. Tastes of sweet lemons and zesty orange peel along with herby, floral, hops and spices. Really well done and delicious wit. Three thumbs up on my first Kiuchi beer."
"It's appearance is nothing to rave about, but its taste sure is. This is one Japanese beer that can stay in the US market. Interestingly, a few Japanese tourists I met some time ago had no idea Kiuchi made beer. I might have to e-mail them about this brew."
"Poured into an oversize wine glass and looked a bright golden yellow with a tiny head that quickly faded to nothing with zero lacing. This has got to be one of the most aromatic beers I've tried so far. As soon as I started pouring I was overcome in a good way, by flowery citrus scents of lemon and lime and a kind of vegetable rhubarb aroma. Later on the smell took on a kind of cologne like presence. Tasted similar to the smell with big lemon/lime flavors up front and a more bitter taste than others of the same style. I know there's something more than just lemon and lime in this one but I have a hard time putting words to it. If you like white's you've gotta give this one a try, simply outstanding!!"
"Notes: Unique stuff, much spicier than any Belgian wit I've had, but it works - this is a great beer."
"Bottle courtesy of Miver: Poured a yellow with white hazy notes color ale with a large siz4e foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of spices is dominating with some particularly nice notes of coriander. Taste is a mix between some great wheat malt notes with a nice overly present mix of spices which included coriander and orange peel for sure. Minimum filtration provided a great body with good carbonation. Very well done for a style that is too often dismissed as bland."
"D: OK drinkability overall. The mix of spices and malts gave it a bit too much of a floral taste - almost like potpourri. Definitely an easy, light drinking beer."
"D- Recommended. Very akin to Chambly more than any other wit. Quite tasty and refreshing, a good warm weather quencher."
"D: Very much so, goes down easy. This will make a good summertime session. Wanted to try for a while and glad I did."
"D: This is an extremely drinkable beer. The taste is very complex and refreshing. Maybe a little too sweet to drink all the time, but still a very good beer."
"D - really easy to drink. this is quite an enjoyable white ale"
"This beer is extremely, wonderfully drinkable. It is extremly light and delicate. No one flavor dominates another. All work in very nice harmony. I was a bit skeptical about a good Japanese beer after Kirin, Sapporo etc, but this is outstanding."
"Enjoyed this beer. Would purchase it again. Realized it was unique from the first floral whif. A nice twist on the classic Witbier. Poured cloudy golden with a small white head. Starts and ends with spicy orange peel. Just sweet enough with a fine orange peel aftertaste that lingers."
"Light in body, smooth, crisp, and slightly creamy. Very well balanced wit. Above average drinkability, but the coriander in Wit beer limits it for me - a couple on a warm day would be perfect."
"The finish actually starts dry and transitions back to yeast and wheat. I was very pleased with how relatively dry this beer was compared to the few other wits I've had. Really adds a great level of character, and is a good twist on the style IMO. Carbonation is pretty strong and does stand out with what is a very light bodied beer. That said, the dryness of this beer makes it really quite thirst quenching and drinkable. I could see picking this up again if it wasn't so damn expensive (10 bucks? - what did I do?)"
"750 mL olive-green bottle with some code on the back label. Brewed with orange peel, nutmeg and coriander, and hopped with Perle and Styrian Goldings - 13 IBUs. It sits a pale, unfiltered whitish-gold in the glass (opaque by the last pour), with medium to high carbonation, and topped with two inches of bone-white head that retains well, lacing the whole way through. Smells spicy, with medicinal phenolics, citrus, a touch of coriander, yeast, and a light musty character. The flavor is very much the same, with a tart sourness, sharp coriander, orange and lemony citrus, spicy/grassy, peppery and musty hops, and a background of flavorful wheat. It has a light, well-carbonated body that imparts a medium finish on the palate, and is quite refreshing. Delicious and thirst-quenching, and it tastes a bit wild - like a spicy Berliner weisse; or even a witbier spiked with Orval. I'm not sure if the beer is intentionally soured or if it is just a bit old, but either way it adds a wonderful extra dimension to this tasty brew."
"D- Its not bad-average overall. Definitely a different spin on a witbier. Probably not one I am willing to spend money on again."
"I had this at my favorite NYC beer bar in both bottle and draft. To my taste buds, this was kind of like a spicier Hoegarden, with strong orange-blossom notes (which I was later told was due to the corriander and other spices they use in the brewing process). It smells fantastic. I actually prefer this to Hoegarden and will look for it next summer. It was light, refreshing and delicious. Definitely worth a try if you like Hoegarden but want something a bit more exotic."
"Pours a slightly hazed straw with a white head. Nose is lemon and citrus on the nose with a straw edge to it that just gives an earthy, plant like fragrance. Very perfume like, but also like walking through a field of aromatic flower stems that were just cut. I could take a whiff of this one for hours. Flavor is smooth and even. There is a straw like quality that stays earthen and thick, though still light enough overall to enjoy. Feel is smooth and silky with a balanced carbonation. Definitely drinkable, though it is fairly different and unique which might detract for some. Plus for such a high price (again with the Hitachino), is it really worth it? $5? Hmmm. No."
"Alright, first note: just paid $3.50 for a typical 12-ounce bottle of an imported witbier from Japan... although this isn't the first Hitachino offering that I've sampled, I had originally paid about $7 bucks for a larger size... glad I was able to find a smaller and cheaper sample, because I wasn't blown away by this particular brew, and for the steep price I paid, definitely don't think this one was worth it, although it is a unique stab at the style... Definitely smells better than it tastes in my opinion... the aroma is full of citrus, lemon, vanilla, wheat and coriander which is very noticeable... the taste is very pepperish - almost reminds me of a lemon-flavored seltzer... much more so than the Nest Weizen which was my first sample from this brewery... In my opinon, there is too much of a pepper flavor and not enough vanilla and citrus that I look forward to when sampling a witbier... Would opt for a less expensive Belgian or German sample anyday, even though the mouthfeel was good and the drinkability on this brew is great... goes down smooth, very crisp and clean... Glad I sampled this one, although probably wouldn't purchase this again unless I could find it for much cheaper... go for the Nest Weizen..."
"I really wanted to like this beer. I think drinking a Belgian White from Japan is pretty cool. But, like my first unreviewed time I had it, I was underwhelmed. Perhaps this thing is just to bitter and dry to get it done. And, this baby being so pricy doesn't help."
"M&D: softly sparkling, quite refreshing in texture and feather light in body due to the high percentage of wheats in the mixture. A pretty decent product with a highly yeasty flavour overall, making it quite different from a normal witbier from Belgium."
"D - This is a powerful Wit with surprising complexity. Will I have another one? Yes, but not right now, the tartness is too overwhelming for that. All said and done, this is still among my favorite Wits of all time."
"Very light pale straw and hazy, small head. Smell was herbal, faintly woodsy and fruity. The flavor was much lighter than normal witbiers, but there was an autumn leafy character that I found intriguing. The spices were a bit muted, but that bumped up the drinkability. Finished clean with a little coriander. After the bar closed, the kind bartender allowed me to crane my neck under the tap and go for it; a much different experience than the one mentioned above."
"This beer is so easy to drink and enjoy. It's one of my favorite Japanese beers."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- A bit rough in the mouth, the carbonation is just slightly overdone. Other than that, this was great... would've never guessed this came from Japan. Time to get a hold of the rest of Hitachino's lineup and sample them all."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not filling at all, not a good representation of style, this is definitely at the bottom of the list of Witbier’s that I’ve tried, however, compared to some of the other Japanese beer exports that I’ve had, it’s a hell of a lot better than any Rice Lager."
"Poured out a peach Jelly Belly with a moderately sized, thinning head that leaves some scant chunks of lace on the glass. There is a lot of orange upfront in the nose with a spiciness that lingers on longer than the initial citrus. Aroma is overall light and relatively clean. In the flavor, spice comes out more along with wheat cracker/ Finishes tart, dry and has a slight tannic(?) astringency. Mouthfeel is light and lively. Apropos. A very refreshing and flavorful wit with a welcome tartness in the finish. I like it."
"D- A very drinkable beer and one of the better I've had."
"D - Pretty good, but not entirely worth the price of almost $4 a bottle (12 oz. serving). Smell and flavor characteristics are a little odd which makes this difficult to rate. However, an enjoyable brew to drink no less."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and not at all thin. Finish leaves a slight twang and gives a cottony kiss to the tongue, improving the overall character of the beer greatly. A solid example of a wit from an unexpected locale. My only complaint is that I've had this beer a number of times and the quality seems to vary widely. The only thing I can think of is that certain places I've purchased this from have simply had it on the shelf too long or stored it improperly."
"D - This is a very smooth beer, in fact one of the smoothest I've ever had. It is very easy to put down and you learn something new every time you drink it."
"D- Very refreshing, a good summertime beer."
"D - Very good. This is definitely the best beer from Japan that I have ever had. Actually worth seeking out, but not woth a flight to Japan. Sessionable, pleasant for the whole family."
"D-This beer has a lot of nice depth but it is very soft. That makes this beer a nice session beer, which lets you understand a little more about it with every new glass. Very nice wit without the over powering bubblegum and clove characteristics."
"This is a beer that I could drink with anything and at anytime. Nice crisp taste with little to no after taste. This is a little hard to find in my area but it's not difficult if you know where to look as with most beers. I would recommend trying this beer sooner than later."
"Overall, an enjoyable easy drinking, refreshing beer."
"Drinkability: A good brew, but just personally I would rather enjoy one good Wit every few months then make it a regular thing."
"D: I would have given the drinkability a higher score but at $4 a beer it is hardly ""drinkable"""
"Great beer. One you could drink all day long but I only bought one bottle of the stuff. I will be buying more. One of the best beers I have had in a while now."
"Tried this Japanese white ale and was almost tricked into thinking it was a good Belgian. Tasted like a mild Celis white or Blue Moon. Had a strange wet bitterness but was pretty good. Color is murky like a yeast laden brew sort of a dark, cloudy yellow. No real head or lacing to speak of. Smell is light and airy of citrus, spice, and a little sweet. Has a nice taste of sweetness with some sour, wheat, and citrus notes. I liked this one on the whole, but it is a bit pricey."
"11.2 oz. bottle costing $3.59. Poured into a pint glass which produces a hazy yellowish orange color with a small fizzy head that quickly dissapears into a thin white ring around the glass. The aroma is without a doubt one of the strongest assets to this beer. The aroma explodes with a lot of clove, ginger and orange. The taste is domintated with a lot of the same clove and orange flavors that are present in the nose. Overall, this is a fine wit that I am having a hard time convincing my brain that it is made in Japan and not Belgium. Good, not great but recommended despite the price."
"So I don't know: on the one hand, I'm just barely tempted to buy this beer again in the future from another store (and so hopefully another batch) to re-review it. On the other hand, I'm really, really happy I only bought a single bottle. Pretty icky stuff for what it's supposed to be, and not nearly enough body to back up an intentional brett or Flanders style ale."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is light bodied with gentle carbonation. The beer is easy to drink. This beer is a nice sessionable beer."
"and I enjoyed it."
"D - A truly exceptional wit. Spot on to style and incredibly drinkable. Due to the cost I may not be buying too many more of these, but I have to pick up a few to let some friends give this a taste."
"Ah- Danyo Sun...you wax poetic about Jowry Pumkin...but you know moo shoo poke? Wrong gastronomical culture there G. I. Joe. Hell, this wit soda reminds me of Calabaza Blanca minus the sweetness but with all the overt white foam at the top, orange-citrus, mild spice and zing. I prefer that there not be pellet sized yeast particles floating about but I think I can trust my semi-inebriated coordination to hold them off from getting past the toofuses. Still there is a strange curiosity to eat them, but knowing the bathroom casualty I'll likely face makes that unlikely. I suggest that you bow down to Moloch now before the enlightened ones take your profane head off and puts it up on a stick."
"Overall, a really good beer. But the price is high where I live so I probably wont be drinking it often."
"D: A wonderful, unique take on the witbier style. Highly enjoyable and very highly recommended."
"drinkability: high"
"D - A very nice witbier. I really liked the sweet, fruity flavors."
"Never dreamed I'd have a Japanese Belgian wit on tap, but, hey, crazier stuff has happened."
"Would be more drinkable if not for the overwhelming spice.... still a pretty damn tasty beer... were the price a little lower, I'd make this a frequent purchase. As is, however, I will stick with Southampton's Double Wit when given the choice."
"Wit is what started me on this hobby, so having one on draft is always a treat. This Japanese version is very interesting. Adheres to style for the most part--banana, clove, and coriander taste is there but with other spices as well--I couldn't indentify, but the description said nutmeg. Aroma is strong in the nose, moslty yeast, to go with a sour taste. If you like Belgians and specificy lambics, wits, Flanders red, and other sour beers, you'll like this one. I wouldn't try a new person on it, or even go from Blue Moon to this strong interpretation that is light on sweet/fruit and heavy on yeast/tartness. The head disappeared quickly after a sip or two of the light golden ale that was hazy enough to be opaque. Overall, a very enjoyable beer that I wouldn't hesitate to have another but maybe not two."
"Aftertaste is very drying with a touch of lemon pepper."
"This is an interesting beer... I guess. It at least looks as good as Hoegaarden! It smells very herby, like ginger and pepper. Are any of you aware that coriander is British for cilantro? Neither this nor any other beer smells like cilantro, the herb that I make Laab gai with so I don't know what you guys are talking about. Ginger and pine it does. Well that's the best part of this beer anyway as it tastes just ok. Medicinal and lemony with a watery mouthfeel. A greater hop presence is needed as well as some other things. The weird flavor combined with the thin mouthfeel and excessive carbonation make for a mediocre beer. This is not as good as the rest rice ale offered by the same brewer, that was dynamite."
"Hazy orange, with a nice white head. Smell is massive ginger and coriander, with some estery yeast in the background. I was nearly knocked over by the spice in this beer on the first sip. I almost wonder if the used ginger. Huge fresh ginger flavor balanced out by the malts. Additionally the hitachino beers i've had so far all seem to have an acidic component to them which i very much like. Mouthfeel is very light and airy. The tremendous spice hurts the drinkability a bit, but this is very interesting and a good tradeoff."
"great beer to sit on the beach in the sun and drink. very good wit."
"At $3.60 a bottle, I would not buy this beer again."
"The smell was a big turn off along with the distracting carbonation."
"Who says great beer doesn't come out of Asia? This is very good example of a Belgian White. It has a hazy light yellow color, with a nice head that fell a bit too quick and high carbonation. The aroma is quite citrusy with some wheat grainy notes. The flavor is similar to the aroma with a hop undertone. I had it with some smoked salmon and then with a lime infused veggie stir fry. It lifted up some of the salmon flavor and held hands with the stirfry very well. It is rather easy to drink and very refreshing. I look forward to my next one. This is the third time I've had this beer and am yet to be disappointed."
"Poured a hazy pale gold, with lots of floaties. Large white head stuck around for a while. Aroma was sweet and spicy, some hops of the citrus variety were present. Taste was quite spicy and citrus-lemon, almost to the point of sour. There was a mild sweet taste in the middle, and a medium hop bite at the finish. I did not particularly care for the taste. Mouthfeel was a little slick (soapy?), fairly light, with medium carbonation and drying. It was an OK beer, fairly refreshing, but definately not to my taste."
"Overall, this is an extremely refreshing and enjoyable white ale. Not an everyday purchase, but I'm glad I tried it. Well done."
"The taste is pretty much what I smelled coriander and bannana with a fizzy mouthfeel. Not too sweet and hardly any bitterness or taste of alcohol. Very drinkable ale. Wish I could have another, but that would be too much fun for one night!"
"D: Too many spices added, detracts from the flavor of the beer. And I can't get the flavor off my palate. Not bad but not great."
"I was surprised and delighted that this beer was so good. I would get it again, if only it was cheaper. Still, on a special hot summer day, what a beer."
"Overall, a very drinkable brew for the summer and goes very well with lighter items [fish, chicken, etc.]. Very nicely balanced. Has a lot of subtle complexity that makes this very interesting and makes me want to pick up another on my next trip to the store. Can't wait to try it again."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and tasty, refreshing. This is how I think a white ale should taste like, really spicy and flavorful but refreshing."
"Not your typical Wit, but good beer anyways. The bigger additions of lemon zest is apparent as the beer decants from the bottle. Shows the typical canary straw color, but without the soft, glittery hue expected. Head retention is loosely knit, unlike the creamy, foamyness expected either. Along with lemongrass in the nose, there is nice hints of corriander, curraco, and estery yeast qualities. Though these esters show in the flavor, the lemon dominates and religates the other, softer, flavors to support the citrus and not compliment as they should. The beer's lemony qualites keep the beer from becoming creamy or full on the palate, but does help the drinkability and cutting through the thirst. I will love trying this again."
" I found this one to be quite enjoyable and very drinkable. Score another one for the Hitachino line!"
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a cloudy gold, with a small carbonated head. This beer has a very strong aroma. It smells mainly like citrus, with some coriander and yeast too. It tastes very citrusy, with a slight spicy (coriander and ginger) aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light, with a decent amount of carbonation. It goes down very easy and it's a refreshing beer, great for drinking in spring or summer. This is much better than I expected it to be, I'll have to pick up another one of these again pretty soon."
"An excellent white, and the first Japanese beer that I've ever really, really enjoyed."
"Hitachino Nest White Ale pours a darker straw color with a huge white head and chunks floating in it from a brown eleven point two ounce bottle. The aroma is downright amazing. Citrus seems to dominate, but there is also some spice, coriander perhaps, that is noticeable. Sparkly carbonation. Taste is also very interesting. I would have to say that up to now, I have not been the biggest fan of Witbiers. This one is quickly changing my mind. Citrus is not overbearing, but is definitely dominant. Coriander is present but not in too assertive of a fashion. Very well balanced. Excellent beer, highly recommended. Who would have expected an excellent witbier from a Japanese brewery? I think I need to try some of their other beers."
"D: Dry in the way that makes one thirsty for more. Exceptional."
"Mouthfeel is slightly spritzy with a medium feel and a yeasty body. Mild spices highlighted by pepper and coriander make this Belgian style Witbier stand out among the better ones. Certainly much better than the old standby, Hoegaarden."
"Nice for the summer or with a light meal."
"Nicely done summer witibier, quaffable and enjoyable, though strong carbonation and watery mouthfeel might turn some off."
"The nest white poured a cloudy golden yellow color(some orange colors too), from a 24oz bottle, with 3/4 of an inch of bright white head. The head diminished very quickly and left a watery white lacing. The scent was a very mellow sweet scent of wheat and malts. There was a light fruitiness of citrus fruit present. The first thing that I noticed when tasting this beer was the high amount of carbonation. It was a very good representation of a witbier, and if I had not have known that it was japanese I might have mistaken it for a euro wheat. It had a nice fruity/citrusy body, and slightly spiced. the finish was crisp, with just a bit of bitterness(almost not noticeable). This beer was very drinkable....and the carbonation made for a very pleasing mouthfeel. Between my girlfriend and I the bottle did not last long."
"Da: Medium-High. It's probably just ""highly drinkable"" but witbier is not one of my everyday beers."
"I like this beer. From what I know about the beers of Japan, this brewery is one of a few that's got their shit together. This is a pretty decent effort at a witbier. Keep 'em coming!"
"I hate to do the girl thing again (like with the troublette), but god that owl is cute. I got this beer at a bar in Orlando when I asked the awesome bartender to give me any witbier that wasnt Wittekerk and needless to say I love this one! Heres to Japan for a great little witbier ;)"
"1 pint 5 oz bottle. Hitachino White Ale has a pale yellow color with a small, white head. Sugary aroma with a pronounced ginger smell. Citrus aroma too. Juicy, fruity flavor. Lots of spice in the flavor, especially ginger and coriander. Although it is spicy, it is never cloying. Lots of orange and a bit of lemon. Nice version of a witbier. Mouthfeel could be fuller, but drinkability is top notch. An interesting Japanese beer with a good, fresh flavor."
"Will drink again, hopefully I will be able to find again it in the summer."
"This Japanese version of a Belgian witbier is exceptional. It pours hazy and apple gold, with a pleasant head that soon dissipates to a white film on the beer. The nose is filled with spices, mostly coriander and cloves. Very fresh-smelling and appetizing. The flavor, though, is what sets this beer apart. It manages to be spciy, refreshing , and smooth all at the same time. First off, this beer nips at the front and sides of the tongues with spices and carbonation; the overall sensation is spicy, with coriander dominating and a hint of sour green apple in the background. The spices are balanced by some nice grass notes and a bit of nutty malt toward the back of the palate. It's an exceptionally light-footed beer -- I keep thinking of the word ""effervescent"" -- in spite of the flavor punch it packs. With a wonderful flavor and brilliant, peppy mouthfeel, this is a beer you could drink all day. Especially on a warm day, toss out the pilsners and give this one a try."
"Drinability: This is a nice beer, the flavors good, and it's really refreshing. Definitely easy to drink."
"Drinkability: An excellent wit for any season."
"Drinkability: Yes, super high, try this, try this, try this. AT 5% it's crazy not to indulge, but I did, however, pay about $8 for the bottle. And then again, now I see why. I'd recommend this to anyone. I hope it elicits the same surprising response in you as it did for me."
"Overall, I really like this beer. At $4.20 though, I will probably never buy it again because I make a beer at home that is very very reminiscent of it and costs about 90% less."
"To me the balance is off with too much acidic flavor, the taste is flat, and a plus may be the smooth slightly sour finish for session status."
"Overall an impressive Witbier. True to the style yet interesting enough to keep me coming back. Will definitely try more Kiuchi styles."
"A medium/light body with effervescence on the tip of the tongue. Overall a decent brew but nowhere near as good as the other offerings from Kiuchi."
"I could drink alot of this on the got days we have had. Cool label too."
"Floral smell/yeast definitely involved. The first taste at the very very beginning is sour but its only a split second until the citrus/carbonation sizzles away at the palate a bit course on the way down...this beer is very unique and doesn't draw all that many similarities to other witbiers i've had. this one stands alone and is a nice example to follow. Kiuchi brewery has gotten my attention with this offering."
"Purchased from Whole Foods, Chicago. After reading in ""All About Beer"" about their cedar-aged IPA, I had to try this, even though its not the same beer. It has a very pale and cloudy color. Kind of lemony like a hefeweisen, but then I picked up a big nutmeg taste (before I knew there was nutmeg in it). Coriander makes an appearance, too. And I do get a cedary taste with this beer after all. Its good to see some craft beers coming over from Japan and discovering brews beyond Sapporo and Kirin."
"The body is medium, and provides a multitude of flavors for each tastebud across your whole palate. This is my first Japanese beer, and I am now interested in trying others by this brewery (though I think I'll continue to avoid such Japanese Macro Lagers as Kirin or Sapporo, etc.)."
"on tap at the Puck Fair bar in Soho, NYC. pours cloudy apricot, white head, light lacing left on the glass, light sugary nose. This is a light, yeasty brew, spicing is fairly mellow but evident. Citrusy and piney notes late. Fine summer brew, pleasant, well crafted wheat that is a treat if you can find it on tap."
"This is one of my favourite styles, and this is a great example. I will definitely be buying more."
"Light and flavorful; this is one wit worth going back to. My first encounter with the Kiuchi Brewery and I'm impressed enough to sample some more."
"Drinkability: A refreshingly different wit, with a lot of subtle fruit and spice flavors; each time I try it I like it better and better"
"Drinkability: Even though its got a bit of wheat in it, you could still manage to drink a few of these. Certainly had more than one."
"Slightly cloudy orange/gold with a big white head. Citrus/clove/coriander pervade both the smell and the mellow but complex flavor. Very light and perfectly carbonated on the tongue, it is an interesting example of a wit. The yeasty flavors are in perfect balance, and the overall effect is extremely refreshing. One of the best non-Belgian witbiers I've ever had."
"The color is a hazy, light golden shade with a large, frothy head. Carbonation is excellent. The aroma is of sweet of sweet oranges with some mild spiciness. Taste starts with a nice citrus bite which is soon rounded out and sweetened. Spices soon join the palate. A mild wheat taste is noted, especially in the finish, where it is joined by a stronger malt flavor. This is an awesome lighter beer, very flavorful and full of complex subtleties. I could spend a lot of time with a beer like Hitachno Nest White Ale. Highly recommended."
"A unique take on Belgian white. Not my favorite in the style, but a different take that creates a lasting impression."
"Notes: All in all a very good beer. I think the coriander might have thrown this beer out of balance and the sour finish was a bit strong, but other than that, I enjoyed it immensely."
"11.2 oz stubby bottle with the cute owl on the label and cap. Actually looks white as it pours from the bottle, but in the glass is a slightly hazed, straw yellow body with a modest white head that has good retention and leaves some patchy lace. Odd aroma of slightly sulfuric Saaz hops, orangepeel, and coriander. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation. Taste has spicy coriander, lemony citrus, wheaty cracker, yeast, orangepeel, and herbal hops that come together quite well. The flavors are all restrained, and the high carbonation helps them meld into a very flavorful, light bodied Wit. Very interesting flavor profile, but it works well. Very refreshing, and an excellent choice as a session ale. Based on my experience with other offerings from this brewery, this is basically a Hitachino Lite."
"Pours a hazy light gold with a Huge white fluffy head. Lord one could go take a shower, make lunch and come back and the head might still be there. Aroma is of sweet orange, spice and lemon. Taste is very citrusy. Spice is at the forefront then fades back into a dry citrus aftertone. Mouthfeel is super carbonated but not obnoixious. This would be a perfect beer for sushi or any oily fish dishes. I would think this would be great for fish and chips for those that like lighter styles. The flavor scrubs anything off the palate. Drinkability is good as well. This is light and flavourful. Belgian wits are not my favourite, but this one is to style and really good. I would put this up there with Allagash white and above Hoogarten on my list of Wits. As a side note I had a sixer of this and Hoogarten in the DBF- the wife left one of the Hitachino, and there are still 5 Hoogarten. I wish more upscale sushi places would carry this as well as the usual Japanese offerings."
"White Nest is my first Kiuchi beer and I'm impressed. It carves out its own niche in the style in a manner that thoroughly appeals to me. The $3.99 price tag for a 12 oz. bottle is a bit much however. Price aside, this is one of the best witbiers out there."
"A decent beer, but odd for the style. I'm used to yeast in wheat beers, but the musty quality that it had seemed odd for a wit and was a little distracting."
"Drinkability- One of the better witbier I have had. A bit strong with the acidity though. Still would have another one of these if I had one."
"24.3 ounce bottle. A darn nice witbier. One I would suggest people who like witbiers search out."
"After its eviction from the 330ml brown bottle, the beer sets in the glass a hazy golden amber. The head started forming the minute I popped the cap off the bottle, as I poured it into the glass it from a behemothic head that is bright white and frothy, as it slowly subsides the lace forms a lumpy sheet upon the glass. Nose is sweet with orange peels, cloves, coriander, a real mélange of flavors and aromas, start is sweet and the grain profile delightful, top is light in its feel to the palate. Finish is striking in its acidity, the hops pleasing and the aftertaste quite dry, a very drinkable beer and one I enjoyed immensely."
"An excellent translation of a Belgian white ale. Pours a beautiful haze of yellow/amber with a frothy, pure white head and nice lacing. Typical white aromas of citrus, coriander, and wheat malt followed by apricot, pear, and clove. Flavors follow closely, intense apricot/peach, melon, nice spices, dry, crisp, with floral notes (jasmine?) not typically found in this style. Soft mouthfeel with a dry, very mildly hopped finish. Pairs exquisitely with sushi. Unique in it's own way, this is one white worth trying"
"Edit--there is no edit--I earlier submitted the review w/o finishing it first."
"Light bodied, not alot of yeastyness. Very refreshing."
"I think I short-changed this beer by pouring too carefully. That left a sticky pad of yeast on the bottom, which turned to be quite tasty. I still got a fair amount of spice, but it would have been much more distinctive if I had swirled up the yeast properly."
"25.4oz bottle. Pours a very cloudy light yellow color with a medium head that dies off and leaves no lacing on the glass. The aroma is very grassy and has the presence of a floral hop. The flavor is spicy and grainy with citrus notes as well as a grassy feel. This is a very odd beer, but a very good beer. I'll definately have this one again."
"It's not a haiku. It's a minimalist review. Good beer here, a little different. kinda a little spicy for a wit. I could see this going well with Japanese cuisine."
"Quite well carbonated, the cap makes a loud sound as I crack it off. The beer is a hazy straw color, that is topped by a thick white head that is held up by the ample carbonation. The aroma is spicy (with notes of lemon, ginger, and pepper), and a bit musty. It really has quite a rich intriguing aroma to it. The beer is well carbonated, which in combination with the spices gives this a peppery-spicy start as I take my first sip. This is actually quite tasty, and quite a bit different (either because of the spices used, or a combination of the yeast used and the spicing) than your average Wit type beer. There is some solid spicy notes here that seem to be driven by ginger, and perhaps some pepper. It is quite dry and light on the palate. This beer must be super spicy when fresh. This would be a great beer to pair with sushi, more places need to pick this up, it is quite tasty, and with its spiciness would pair quite well with food."
"If this offering is made with rice, bring on the Kokuho!"
"Light-medium bodied."
"Pours out a pale gold color with a nice head that stays with you for the entire time. Smell consisted of lots of spices and fruits. Ginger, coriander, cloves and a touch of lemon along with some fruit tones. Pretty nice. Taste was nicely balanced. It's quite flavorful with nothing was overdone which was nice to taste. Lots of fruity tones hit the palate first and then the spices take over and lasts into the aftertaste. Some yeast undertones can be detected as well. I saw the bombers for like 6.50, don't know if I would want to spend that amount of money for this one, I could put in two extra dollars and get Allgash or Hoegaarden 6 pack and it's just as good. Tasty? You bet. But you gotta ask yourself if the price is worth paying for this beer."
"Drinkability is quite nice with its palate cleansing power it does not tire itself out. Solid."
"Pours a clear yellow with lots of floaties- not hazy like other wits, but floaties particles. Very unusual. Has a medium sized white head that collapses immediately, even though there's a lot of carbonation. Aroma has wit-style floral, yeast , and coriander notes. Herbal/coriander aroma is much stronger than in other wits I have had- to the point of being very distracting. The flavor follows through the aroma- I do not care for it beacuse it seems to be a one-note spice flavor. The mouthfeel is clean and light, but I was happy when I finshed it."
"Pours a medium gold color with one finger of head. There is some lacing left. The smell is a little spicy, with some ginger in behind the wheat malt. The taste is sweet, with some citrus fruit. The finish is spicy, with black pepper and ginger. There are some hops present as well. The mouthfeel is just a little light. The drinkability fairs very well, and it's a nice unique beer."
"Overall for a brewery that's no where near belgium, they sure know how to make one interesting beer. A great experience for the style."
"Drinkability: Excellent, fabulous brew for pairing with some asian food and seafood."
"Drinkability  This was OK, but I probably wouldnt look for another."
"Very drinkable beer. I would recommend it and buy it again."
"ng"
"It pours a slightly hazed golden color with a large head. There is some citrus and spice (corriander) in the nose, but it is somewhat subtle. The body is nice and light. The first taste I get is fresh juice (mostly orange, but some grapefuit). It finishes with a clean, dry lemony bitterness."
"Hitachino Nest White Ale was served from an 11 oz. bottle. In a Duvel tulip, the beer was a soft and glowing hazy yellow-orange hue, and was topped by a small white head. The nose was just wonderful, with notes of coriander, orange juice, mango, and a lightly acidic grapefruit-like citrus. The taste was simply fantastic as well. It began with a orange-citrusy coriander-tinged firm and dry malt base that exuded a refreshing acidity. This acidity increased in strength through the finish, which left lingering robust flavors of bitter orange, ginger, black peppercorn, nutmeg, grapefruit, and coriander. I loved the interplay of acidity with the spicey accents. The body was excellently composed for the flavors, as was the vigorous carbonation. I really loved this refreshing and tasty white from Japan...beautifully done!"
"Man, that was good! This doesn't come off as a typical witbier but I'm not going to complain. I'm simply going to go get some more of this great tasting, refreshing brew, especially as it gets hotter. By far my favorite beer from the Land of the Rising Sun."
"Super drinkable an Ultra refreshing brew."
"Hazy pale golden-yellow color, spicy, peppery and earthy citrus aromas, huge white foamy head that sticks to the sides of my glass. Spicy pepper, coriander and citrus flavors, crisp and spicy carbonated mouthfeel, finishes clean and dry, has a funny aftertaste, very refreshing and tasty."
"Asian innovation! It's busy and brassy, tangy and grassy, and just good clean fun. Really, it's crisp and clean, and so full of flavorful diversity that it could be confusing except that each element makes itself clearly known for your appraisal. The citrus and spice refresh nciely, making it emminently quaffable. If you didn't like this beer, it would be easy to specify exactly why, but if you do like it, it's easier just to say, I like it! And so, I like it...that's my story, and I'm sticking to it. Now pour me another!"
"Overall: After the good impression I had once I tried the Celebration Ale 2004, when I spied the White Ale I figured I would give this one a whirl also. Not exactly inexpensive, but well worth splashing the extra coin on this one."
"Still, cool bottle, and easily my favorite Asian brewery."
"This wit beer poured a cloudy, golden color with white foam that settled to leave a thin coat. The smell was fruity (citrus and green apples) with some wheat. The taste was a bit tart and fruity (green apples) with citrus and wheat flavors and a bit of yeast coming through. Overall a very nicely balanced taste. The mouthfeel was smooth and tart (almost puckering). The body was medium with modest carbonation feel. There was a lingering yeasty and tart flavor. This was a very enjoyable beer fresh on tap."
"And that's all there is too it, as I'm not even paying attention to the mouthfeel when it tastes this good, though it could have more pop to it. Regardless, a world class witbier, simple to understand, easy to enjoy."
"holidays with family and friends."
"Overall a great white ale from Japan that can stand with the best Belgium has to offer. Very complex and unique. Sweet, sour, spicy, malty, smooth, acidic, fruity, and tasty. An enjoyable experience on the palette and the mind."
"Boy this is an in your face refresher?! The beer pours a hazy golden. There is minimal head retention yet a nice amount of sticky lace stays with the glass to the end. Some beer diamonds as this must be a minimally filtered brew? The aromas are awesome and perfect for an Asian white! Instantly, aromas of freshly zested orange peel, ginger root and Asian spices attack the nose. I am immediately transported to my favorite Japanese Restaurant and am craving sashimi and especially teryaki Sea Bass! On the palate more of the same. Refreshing to the max, orange and ginger flavors dance an asian jig, and are clean and as fresh tasting as is the cusine of the region! This is a fantastic Beer! I will ask for it to be brought in at my favorite Asian joints as I think this would be un-beatable with the cuisine of the bottles region. Expensive yes-well worth the expense, no doubt!! Drink less and drink slower if you must."
"Gold color- hazy. Small head. Aroma is orange, spice and yeast. A medium bodied wit beer. Yeasty and spicy. Coriander and orange. Light and refreshing. Citrusy and fizzy (but in a good way) Tasty beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter"
"I definitely had some apprehension about this one. Belgium and Japan couldn't be further apart. What is more, this is a tough style to brew. It had a bittersweet palate with a citrusy aroma. The citrus seemed more lemon or grapefruit than the usual bitter orang, but I'm not complaining. As far as wit beers go this one had a unique taste that despite it's uniqueness still fits the category. The citrusy bitterness mixes with an awesome spiciness. The combination makes this beer an enjoyable thirst quencher!"
"Ah, my first Japenese Belgian. This is probably the best Japanese beer I have sampled so far. Pours a murky light orange with a thin white head. Quick lacing, and some sediment at the bottom of the glass. Strong citrus aroma (all orange), with a pinch of spice as well. Crisp and refreshing with a decent balance of orange, ginger, yeast and peaches. Also has a fairly crisp finish. Pricey at over $3 for a 12oz. bottle but a good summer brew."
"Hello, Mr. Owl. He's funny...thus I shall keep the cap until I lose it. This beer pours out a clear golden color with a good sized white head...then the chunky yeast comes flowing out, making this baby quite cloudy. Rather large bubbles are constantly cascading from the bottom of the glass. The aroma of this beer is complex and delicious. Cloves and coriander are quite strong. I wish my car smelled like this beer. Flavor is not as complex as I had expected, but I possibly set my expectations too high. Orange peel and citrus seem to come out the most, with the clove and spices coming in right behind them. Finishes very dry. Definitely a recommended Wit, light and refreshing while still maintaining a nice flavor and decent complexity."
"This brew pours a small white brown head of finely sized bubbles. It had a transparent yellow rice brew colored body with a lot, burp, of carbonation rising throughout my mug. There were a lot of particles that could bee seen floating in the body of the brew. It has a very rice like aroma and a very fizzy, burp, taste of fruit like apples. The flavor was OK, but nothing special. It was a very average brew that I would pass on in lieu of much better brews."
"i don't recommend this beer at all. there isn't any balance to the flavor palate at all."
"Fresh lemon, ginger, wheat, and corriander smell that really knocks your socks off. It really smells like sunshine. If I was lookin' for a date I would put a dab of this behind the ears! Hazy cloudy pale orange color with nice carbonation in the glass and a nice persistant white head. Upfront taste of lemon zest, corriander, and ginger. This is quickly followed by a sweet wheat/marshmellow sweetness. The finish balences the brew with a hint of nobel hops. Medium body, quite a full mouth for a wit. A must try for the white beer fan. A little dab will do ya!"
"Cloudy and yellow looking very true to the style. Great packaging with a painted owl for a logo. I'm a big fan of spiced white ales but this one was overpowered by ginger. Good acidity and mouthfeel was good. Surprised to see a Japanese brewers interpretation of this style. Would be better if it weren't for being heavy on the ginger."
"11 oz bottle. Pours a golden yellow with a moderate head that didn't last, and leaves only a small ring of lace. Floral aroma with a hint of spice. The taste is a highly carbonated, and the spicyness and tartness dominates the finish. No real hops detected. It's not a bad beer, but I don't think its quite my type of drink."
"Thank you StevieW for the lovely bottle!"
"Comes in the distinctive Hitachino bottle with the distinctive owl. It pours a yellowish-gold with a smallish white head, despite the seemingly high carbonation content. The smell is citrus (more orange than lemon) and spice. Although a hint of floral smell is present, a floral flavor really comes through from the first sip. It's highly drinkable and, but for the price, would make a good session beer. Good stuff."
"This brew poured a quick dissolving head with no lacing on my mug. In my opinion it had a fruity and citrusy aroma to it. It was extremely carbonated/fizzy. It had very little aftertaste, if any. I did not feel there was anything special about this particular brew. It was not to my liking by any means."
"I had heard about this line of beers and really wanted to try one,and Iam glad I did.Poured a nnice hazy orange color with big fluffy head,smell was very fresh and citruisy smelling.Taste was nice and tart with some coriander spiciness.Very drinkable and not to light in body,these guys know how to make an excellent wit."
"The flavor was as intense as the aroma. Rather soft mouthfeel and not as sweet as the aroma suggested. Again, the primary flavor struck me as jasmine, like an herbal tea flavoring, and quite appropriate for a unique oriental take on the style. The beer was very interesting, but more of a novelty rather than something I would want on a frequent basis, given the innovative but almost overpowering spicing."
"Pours a chalky gold, with an initial big foamy head. Head quickly settles to a fine lace atop the brew. Aroma full of spices (coriander really stands out) and citrus, with the smell of wheat hiding underneath. Spices are almost overwhelming in the flavor - tons of coriander, clove and I think perhaps ginger and hints of sage. Plenty of citrus notes as well, with a solid grainy base of wheat. Light, crisp mouthfeel. Very smooth. A very refreshing beer, for a warm spring afternoon."
"A 'thank you' goes out to StevieW for including this in our Blockbuster Trade."
"A small word of warning- When first opened, this beer can sometimes give off a skunky, cheap-pilsner smell, but it usually dissipates quickly. A great summer beer, if you are looking for something other than a pilsner or a weiss beer. I will miss it dearly!"
"Poured hazy and yellowish with lemongrass and coriander in the nose. Superfine spritzy carbonation. The nose has more spice than the taste. Very clean and a little citrus with some yeast thrown in for good measure. Medium to full-bodied, this is a thirst quencher and also a big brew to relax with. This was mu first Japanese craft beer, and I was very pleasantly surprised."
"This beer poured a light yellow color and formed a nice foamy white head that left circular lace as it subsided. Much like a float. A heavy amount of rapid moving carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, coriandar and citrus. A flavor of of malt and corindar. Fairly light beer. Not bad for this style and much better than the milk/lacto stout they make. My second venture into this Japanese brewer."
"Easy to drink, quite unexpected balance in the taste. This is a beer that I would wnt to try again for sure."
"Pale gold body but not as pale as many wits. The head is surprisingly small and short-lived. The aroma is coriander and a soft floral fruitiness that seems to be a blending of orange, plum and peaches. The flavor is more of the same. The spices linger on the palate. Surprisingly easy drinking."
"It poured a nice golden yellow with medium foam. The smell was of a citrus nature with spices. The taste was had a sweetness of citrus and I thought it also had a hint of cloves. It had a pleasant after taste. The sweet/bitter after taste was well balanced. I just wish that the after taste would have lingered a little longer in my mouth!"
"A cloudy apricot gold with a quickly dissipating head. I smelled, then tasted this beer, and couldn't figure out the spice used in it... near the end of the beer, it finally hit me... ginger! Has a very intriguing aroma of ginger, citrus, and wheat. Flavor began with an upfront taste of fresh ginger and orange, with a touch of wheat and some malt sweetness to balance things out. Had a thin to medium body with medium carbonation. A beer that you must experience... one of the most interesting beers I've had in quite some time!"
"F"
"From 24.3 fluid oz. bottle. Pours with a beautiful golden color with tiny bubbles of carbonation. A large brilliant white head. The taste is wonderful, I get more orange taste than some of the other flavors described by others. I did seem to taste some ginger. It is a nice change to get some orange flavor in a white ale. A lot of the time I get blasted with a little too much coriander. A nice tangy flavor. Very refreshing."
"Turbid orange hue, topped by a porcelain white head that settles readily into a thin layer. Notes of candied ginger and dried orange peel dominate the aroma, with raw, fresh coriander and black pepper secondary. A snap of candy - like sweetness upfront immediately yields to curacao bitterness and nuttiness from the yeast. Mellow coriander and slightly spicy fresh ginger emerge mid palate along with a dryish, pseudo lactic grainy mild wheat tartness. Moderately bodied, w/ a smooth mouthfeel from the yeast in suspension and perhaps oats. Finishes relatively clean, w/ bready sweetness coating the tongue. Nest White is a clean and enjoyable Wit, but is a touch tame esterwise. The judicious use of spices lend excellent overall balance and drinkability."
"Pale pineapple color, opaque with yeasties.  Head is short lasting and non-lacing.  Acrid aroma, touch of wine and strong cheese.  Maltier than I expected from the aroma, sour lemon and high carbonation dominate the initia flavor but then a sense of sweetness, nutmeg, cedar needles, and anise leaven the mix a bit.  Finishes with a peppery hopping and an aftertaste like an orange Life Saver candy.  Too astringent a White for me, not very drinkable, but there are big qualities in this beer."
"Cloudy dark golden color, some shiny colors depending on the light. Nice yeast bottom goodness makes for a great full fluffy tan head. Huge critus and floral aromas, nearly too much for me, but it settles and wears on you. Taste was a combination of oranges, cloves, ginger, coriander, and spicy peppery, almost hot finish. This would get a 5 on the orginality scale. Full of new flavors on every sip.  Crisp, light bodied, and refreshing. I liked thier hefeweissbier version better. This is also worth picking up."
"720mL. green bottle. Cloudy gold. Loose, off-white foam layer rests atop the hearty looking body. Light grains, lemon and some pineapple make up the aroma. All these aromatic elements are blended together skillfully for a unique flavor that includes some yeasty tartness. Low-medium carbonation combines with a light mouthfeel. A refreshing and interesting twist on the white ale style. Good stuff."
"Hitachino Nest White Ale:  Konichiwa!  Excellent white Belgian style ale, with a weird owl on the label to boot.  Creamy white sticky head over a fluorescent orange/yellow beer.  Very cloudy, with an aroma of citrus cut only with faint yeast aroma.  Well bodied, with a very easy drinking creamy mouth feel. The taste initially hits with a flood of citrus flavors, with a noticeable sensation of hops. The aftertaste reminds me of fresh pine, with a hint of hops.  Very very nice, expensive beer from Japan."
"I used to love Great Lakes Holy Moses White Ale but it is no longer for sale in MI. Belgian Wits have always left me wanting more flavor. This is the answer. Highly articulated flavors of orange, coriander, nutmeg, ginger, lemon merengue, and spice exist in perfect balance. The body is paradoxically almost solid, with aromas and flavors bouyantly rolicking in the foam, as well as vapor-thin, responding to the slightest pressure by melting and transforming into a different arrangement of sensations. Tight bead, viscous, it melts in your mouth and leaves a whistle-clean bright citrus note that goes on and on. Absolutely beautiful."
"Hazy, golden body with an orange cast topped by a thin bright white head that holds an exceptionall collar but leaves no lace. Great aroma! Very bold and perfumy. Sweet & spicy, full of sugary clove, ginger, and light citrus notes as well as some whisps of maltiness. Quite unique. The body is medium light and very creamy. The flavor comes on strong but finishes oh-so-soft, starting with a bright fruitiness, followed immediately by a light-but-mouthcoating maltiness as it crosses the palate, and eventually receeding into a long lasting finish with a light fruit, ginger, citrus, and soft maltiness that is not at all sticky. A little bit of a spice bite on the front of the tongue. Fairly complex for a white ale. Unique. Immensely refreshing and very enjoyable."
"This startling beer is pricey but worth it. Fruity attack with huge blend of spices, including some hints of Japanese origin. I thought I felt some wasabe kick although it could be my imagination; the finish has a similar effect of scraping out the sinuses and the back of the throat (similar to some pharmeceuticals, too). Definite yogurt characteristics, perhaps due to yeast. Nice blend of Japanese and east Mediterranean flavors. Attack is gingery, but not as refreshing as many wits; more heavy duty and may be be best appreciated with robust Japanese-style cuisine. Bubbly on the tongue, smooth in the belly. I think I'll get the 750 bottle next time. Yum."
"BTW:  My frequented liquor store was selling bottles of this for $0.99 (and the weizen too).  I figured they were old, but gave it a shot anyway. These are in good shape.   I'll clean out the rest of their stock tomorrow."
"Who would have thought that a Belgian white would come out of Japan and taste really good.  Expensive $3.95 for 11oz but you get what you pay for.  Creamy head fades quickly.  Spicy/floral smell."
"Cloudy pale orange with a dense rocky white head. Dried orange peel and coriander in the aroma and flavour. Seems the coriander is more dominant in the aroma. Refreshingly crisp and smooth at the same time, dry malt character in the back with grainy tones and nuttiness from the yeast. Spices add some sweetness, coriander is the one that flexes the most. Smooth and rounded grainy flavour helps in the finish. A good and balanced white ale."
"Notes: This is one hell of a unique and outstanding beer! The flavours scramble the shit out of the palate and there's so much depth to this beer that you need an oxygen tank and a slow rise to reality to avoid failing to the bends. Orange? Clove? All these wonderful flavours ... this is all blissful. I'm calm, collective and at one with the universe. This is more of a Wit than most traditional Belgians ... oh, and it's from Japan. Purchase this beer now."
