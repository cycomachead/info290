"Amazing as the chef who's behind it"
""
"This beer is extremely disappointing.  Not much smell.  Not much flavour.  Meh."
""
"I am new to micro beers, however i have had enough to acquire a taste and this one is subtle and weak i taste. The hype does not do this beer any justice, the chef pro claimed beer falls short but can still be a good beginners  drink ."

"Beer was amazing. Must try"
"This one was a little bit of a let down for me after I'd waited so long to get my hands on a bottle, the beer was definitely a light one and there was nothing truly noteworthy of it but it was an easy enough beer to drink in spite of this. The taste, and smell for that matter were both good but didn't seem especially strong meaning it was a bit of a struggle to pick anything up from this one sadly."

"Not much in the nose, light effervescence,very watered down wheat flavor with no after taste.  High price for not much punch.  Even tried using it as a marinade with no real result in imparting flavor.  I expected more with the Adria name on the front."

"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 1B adapted). Bottle 75 cl - Batch L080201. AROMA: sweet grainy lager profile background with faint orange and spicy notes and very faint coriander. no hop aromas. APPEARANCE: pale yellow color and translucent. thin white head with low retention. TASTE: coriander and orange flavours with a grainy sweet profile. low bitterness. finishes semi-sweet. PALATE: thin body with medium-low carbonation. OVERALL: a watered down pale lager aromatized with some wit notes and nothing more."

"Pours hazy gold with loose, clumpy head of 3 fingers that hangs around and leaves a wet lacing.  Aroma is grassy and spicy with some lemony tang, inviting.  Taste is light, really lighter than I hoped or expected.  Dominant flavors follow the aroma, a straw-like grassiness is the most obvious followed by a clean peppery spice.  Not a big flavor profile at all.  Carbonation was lacking and mouthfeel was dry but odd.  Overall the fancy bottle and big name chef on the label caused a letdown.  Doubt I would purchase again."

"This pours a straw gold, 2 fingers of foam that shrinks slowly. A spicy nose of coriander and cloves, banana, sweet malt. Tastes good. Coriander and lightish clove, sweet maltiness, fairly light bodied, easy to drink. This is a good one."

"O: Very good drinkability. Very easydrinking. Pleasant and spicy Witbier"
""
""
""
""
""
"T: The mix of malt and wheat and the use of not so bitter hops give to the beer a very nice taste, pretty persistent. First orange-mandarine, than corriander - erbal and than at the and a very smooth bitterness."

"If in Spain, you are better off asking the bartender for a Alhambra, Mahou, or play it safe with a reputable Belgian Stella Artois."
""
""
"Quite different but good, nice yeast character on the aroma. I had limited expectations. They were exceeded easily. i will harvest this yeast, wow...."
""
"O: an okay beer but my expectations were so much higher. I guess I was just a sucker for the story, the packaging, the website..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very good beer which is easy to drink. Note that the 12 oz bottle version of this beer is very sunky (grade F). The 22 oz. bottle is quite pricey, but you can stop drinking it.. One of my friends call it “a nice sipping beer”. It’s on my “you gotta try” list!"
""
"O: An enjoyable dry, beer that is pretty food friendly and would go well with lighter dishes such as seafood or chicken."
""

"could be better but for mass produced beer it is not bad not as good as Hoegaarden but a bit different than other wit beers made by the big breweries. I'd drink it over blue moon at least"
"O: I wasn't sure how this would go. The labeling on the box and bottle made it seem like a world class beer, but the price tag and alcohol content said run-of-the-mill. I was expecting the latter but kept myself open to the former. I got the latter. It did have those citrus notes and refreshment it promised, but on much smaller scale than suggested. It was good, but nothing I would advocate looking for."
""
"The packaging of the beer (a large, wine-like bottle sold in a classy black box) suggests serving it chilled in a white wine glass, filling it only halfway. While I'm a proponent of using proper glassware to enhance the various qualities of a good beer, I'm not sure it's really necessary, as a regular pilsner glass does the job. While it certainly couldn't hurt to use a wine glass, I think Inedit will please no matter what."

"High praise for the concept, but the execution leaves A LOT to be desired. This beer would rock in an imperial version but as it is, it's like that Eric Idle comment on American beer (something about a canoe...). I wanted to love this beer and after reading the mini booklet that came with the bottle, I was expecting so much more"

"I assume the name is a pun on ""Damn, I need it"". Maybe not. But minus points either way. If this is Damm's best beer I don't feel much need to explore more."
"It is very watery, and the aftertaste is a little unpleasant. Not like ""last sip"" unpleasant, but not very good either. if it was maybe $6 or $7 for the bottle I would be less upset, but when you enter double digits it needs to be justified in the taste of the beer; sadly, It wasn't here."

"I guess it is quite a unique style, and I can't say I've had anything quite like it before or since. But, overall it really just isn't that exciting, especially coming from the likes of Ferren Adria. I'd have it again but not in a hurry or at a price."
"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a light to medium golden amber with a great three finger white head that dissipates slowly leaving lots of lacing. Nice active carbonation in the glass. Classic witbier aroma of wheat and light fruit juice; apple and pear, mild malt. Flavor of sweet malt, apple and pear juice, very light sour lemon, a hint of coriander and hops. Flavors are nice, but attenuated almost to the point of tasting watered down. Light bodied. Pleasant, but uninspired and thin tasting. Nice classy bottle, but I'd rather have a stronger witbier in an ugly bottle. At least I can tick Damm without having to drink their macros..."
"O: Not really good, too bland, too sweet"
""
""
""
""
""
"This witbier is fairly clear bodied and the carbonation is pretty good. The head is white and extremely bubbly and thins out really quickly. The aroma is pretty good, wheat and mild malts smells come through, light grasses, lemon zest and not much else. Its slightly spicy you can start to taste some other spices, coriander, mild hops start to come in as you swallow, but the taste is rather lacking, I wish the spices were a bit more evident. It is crisp on the tongue; and remains light and refreshing. This one isn’t bad for the style but I would expect more from a chef."
""
""
""
""
"Overall not a bad Spanish take on a Belgium style. It doesn't drink like water and has enough flavor to consider it part of the style. I would pass on it if given the chance regardless of how fancy the bottle is."
""
""
""
""
"Coriander and citrus are evident on the first sip, but aren't very strong. Hops take a back seat on this one. Pretty smooth mouthfeel and a very clean finish. Overall, a mild tasting beer that was certainly drinkable...just a bit boring. This one would be best served on a hot summer day with a barbeque than during the winter months."
""

""

"O - A novely beer from Spain and honestly, I prefer Mahou better. Worth trying but givren the price and packaging I expected more."
""
""
""
"Pours a murky light orange-yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, citrus fruit, and spices. Taste is much the same with a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some nice aromas and flavors that is easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Came in a rather stylish package and a champagne type bottle. Poured a light golden colour with a thick frothy head that left very little lacing. Smelled of hops, banana and citrus. Had a banana wheat flavour with a slight orange citrus aftertaste. Low on the carbonation and easy to drink. Very nice."
"Excellent drinkability and very well balanced."
""
"Dedicedly average"
""
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium, with a medium finish. This beer is really good. It fits the Witbier profile really well. Very well made, the flavors blend fairly well, and it is very easy to drink. Sad I only have one bottle of this beer. This beer is near perfection."

"O: All in all it's a typical purpose-brewed food pairing beer. A little sweet and clumsy to have just on its own, but it's a damn fine witbier when consumed ice cold, as it befits the style."
""
""
"O - This is a pretty good witbier. Better than other beers from Estrella."
""
""
"O- Drinkabilty is great and the beer feels very refreshing. Could use some improvement in blending flavours a bit more. Shows once again that industrial breweries have potential in making good, fairly priced beer, if they only put a little effort. Think of what they could do if they put a lot of effort"
"500ml bottle. Tulip glass. Enjoyed on jul´12. Pours pale golden in color. Foggy, honey appearance. White, close, creamy crown. Fairly good retention. Citric, subtle coriander, spiced –clove- aromas. Some spiced & wheat hues. Sweet malty upfront, low bitterness. Fizzy sensation, lager-like watery texture. Ligth body, medium to high carbonation. Smooth citric finish. I´ve expected much more from this since marketing campaign. Pronounced vanilla & spices as long as orange/tangerine notes are missed. Refreshing & drinkable as a lemonade."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and refreshing. I would also consider it to be thirst-quenching—unlike most beers in this style—because it doesn’t have flavors of spices."
"I recommend Al Di Meola, John McLaughlin and Paco de Lucía's cd Friday Night cd for some wonderful guitar music that oozes out of the rich Spanish guitar tradition to blend with this wonderful Spanish beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: what the heck is this beer. It was so watery almost like spicey lemonade. It was fairly disappointing for the bottle and appearence. Good marketing."
""
""
"O: This is an okay beer. Nothing out of the ordinary which makes me wonder why the El Bulli chef which is known for his experimental food would put his name on such a beer that plays it THAT safe without any form of innovation."
"O: I'm glad I gave this a try. I do not think I've had very many Biers from Spain, but this is very nice. I want to try more."
""
""
""
"O: A witbier that pairs very well together with fish soup (which I had at the time of testing). All in all an overall witbier."
""
""
"Price = $9.99 at Whole Foods (NYC)"
"Bottle stamped 07/11 L190216 poured to tulip glass. The beer pours a golden yellow with a small 1 finger white cap with little retention and little lacing. The aroma is faint but provides a floral light citrus fruitiness flavor. Heavy wheat influence here. Just like the nose the flavor is wheat heavy, too much so, in my opinion. The crisp fruity sweetness is very much subdued. Lighter bodied and decently carbonated. Overall, not much going on here. The little booklet suggests the beer is made to be paired with food. I paired mine with a baked chicken. The beer did nothing for the food nor me. Not sure it's worth close to the asking price. Not bad, not great."
""
"O- A nice beer for aa hot summer."
""
""
""
"Would go for it again."
""
""
""
"Overall is a light beer that match perfecly with seafood in general."
""
""
""
"Come into the light?... This is a light-golden colored beer with a nice bit of foam. There’s a light pale Belgian-style aroma to it—some floral esters but not a whole lot. It’s thin-bodied, lightly flavored (do you see the trend here?) with a curious finish. For as much as I’ve seen this around I really didn’t miss much by not trying it until now."

"A really well done beer that is easily attainable. "
""
""
"Feeble. In designing a food beer that is all things to all people, this has been dumbed down by committee to lack any real character. Inoffensive in the worst way."
"It's soft beer in terms of mouthfeel. The carbonation is pretty active, but it is never sharp of prickly. It's more cloud-like. Overall, this is an above-average witbier only because of its unique flavors for the style. This is not a beer to drink by itself, though. It's too seemingly under-flavored for that. Instead, drink this as the brewers and El Bulli collaborators intended it: as a true compliment to light foods that wine has trouble with. This beer is going to be fantastically complimentary with fish, with light & oily salads, with artichoke, asparagus, etc. It's very versatile with light dishes."
""
""
"Food Pairing- The makers of this beer say that this beer is meant for dining and I can see why, it's very light and has low alcohol. I could see this pairing well with some fish and root vegetables."
""
"Of course the bottle is nice, but who cares."
""
"However, I think the concept is a bit too pretentious for me. Developed by sommeliers and a chef? It should be served in wine glasses and kept in a chilled bucket? Here's how I'm interpreting all this. ""Beer isn't as good as classy and refined as wine, so we're going to make one that's a close to a wine as possible, but still technically a beer."""
"Overall, this is a light refreshing beer. It might be nice during the summer. The flavours aren't especially interesting though. I think it tries to have snob appeal with the bottle, but I was a little underwhelmed."
"Interesting beer; engineered for food, as per the pamphlet, subtle but fairly tasty."
"Overall - There is some potential here, but I was disappointed with the fact that it had some of the qualities found in a cheap adjunct beer. Especially considering the high price of the bottle.. Speaking of which, the flashy bottle is probably the best part of this beer. I wouldn't buy it again."
"This is a beer that comes off strong but the taste is surprisingly weak. Still, this is a refreshing and tasty wheat beer, not to mention the spiffy bottle. I'd recommend this when it's hot out."
"The CPJ"
"Mouthfeel was good."
"This brew doesn't taste that bad. However, the original price tag was too exorbitant and I hope that nobody bought it at that price. Seriously, when you need to mark own the beer 80%+ to move it..."
"Mouthfeel is nice light to medium bodied. Overall a decent whitbier for a Spanish brewery but not as good as some of the German whits that are plentiful fow about the same price. This beer is approximately $6 USD out in town."
"Decent Wit. Certainly drinkable and would be one to introduce this style to a neo-phyte"
"Still want to try more from this brewery or new collaborations with ElBulli since I feel like there was lots of potential. EDIT: Checked the reviews and the other stuff this brewery produces and seems like this is the best they've got. So..."
"A great mouthfeel makes up some lost ground with a creamy and light feel that finished very dry. Overall, not bad. A little bit pricey for what it is though. I paid 8 something for the bottle..."
"Coriander and orange are evident on the first sip, but aren't strong. Hops are there in the background, thought they don't play a major part. Nice mouthfeel with a very clean finish. Overall, a mild tasting beer that was very drinkable. It would be good on a hot day with spicy foods."
"Nose is citrus, peach, pitted fruit, floral, some spice, orange rind. Taste is very citrus-y, nice balance of fruit with low acidity, flavourful taste, enough hops to make it all work. Body on the thin side. What I really liked about this beer is the refreshing effervescence, clean sweet finish lingers briefly. Not bad at all, likely better in warmer weather."
"This beer pours a clear golden color with little head at all. The aroma is strong with floral hops and some spices... Very nice. The taste is a little too empty... You can definitely tell it is a wheat beer with the sweet perfume floral characters. The mouthfeel is a little too carbed, but overall worth a try."
"Overall this is a bit of an odd duck. Not necessarily bad, I will gladly drink the entire bottle, but a little off for a Witbier."
"Nice soft creamy carbonation though."
"An inoffensive drop, but a big wow on the boring factor. Fuck you I'm being oxymoronic. Your mother's an oxymoron."
"I think part of the harsh reviews stem from the high expectations and heavy hype this beer has received. And I think it's silly to spend $30-40 on a bottle, as I've seen in some locations. For $10, though, this is a perfectly acceptable witbier that went nicely with the lemon chicken, hummus, and garlic flatbread my wife prepared."
"D-Nothing spectacular here. You could spend less and get more out of your beer."
"No, not a lot going for this. It really doesn't manage to struggle above its genesis as a pale euro lager. While it's probably cleaner and a little more interesting than most, calling this a witbier is a genuine stretch."
"D- i think this was my first and only spanish beer that ive tried. i dont think ill be rushing out to sample anything else from this brewery. the literature that comes on the bottle claims this lager/ale hybrid is the ideal pairing for any meal. i dont see how thats possible."
"750 ml bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a hazy golden color with about an inch and a half frothy off-white head. Head retention is good and there's a decent amount of lacing left on the glass. The brew smells mostly like wheat/grain, along with some orange peel and a bit of coriander. The taste is just like the aroma, it tastes mostly like wheat/grain, along with some coriander and orange peel. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium and has high carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it's not hard to drink. Not a bad brew overall, it was nice to try but I don't think I would ever buy it again."
"I had some Coeur de Lion Pié D'angloys (a soft French Cheese) with the beer and it went very well. However the beer just lacked that something which makes it stand out from the crowd, pleasant but no world beater."
"A decent beer to go with food with a few fruity and spicy notes but ultimately it falls a little flat with too much of a lager element to it."
"D - goes down extremely easy and the flavour mix is very appealing, this would be a great summer sessioner"
"The appearance had me a tad worried from the start, but things only looked up from there. The spiciness loosely reminiscent of a winter warmer helps to define this beer and plays very well with everything from the wheat to the bready finish. It's a bit on the pricey side, but I'd give this another go."
"D - Very drinkable for the abv. I wasn't expecting much from this so it's a good surprise. A quality wheat beer I could have all night."
"D - Poundable, refreshing and flavourful. This stuff offers a unique orange citrus twist on the standard witbier. A perfect patio drink and definitely worth a try."
"D- This is a very simple wheat beer. It is certainly no witbier as there are no spices, herbs, or citrus. Just wheat and grain. This beer is not bad, its just bland and very boring. I can't write much more about it because there isn't anything else to it."
"For the effort of going out of their way to produce a such a blended product (they claim wheat beer and lager) it doesn't quite stand up on its own beyond an average experience. Quenching for sure, but light in the flavour department."
"Note: As intended I ate this with food and found it to be a remarkable complement to my meal. I think that part of it comes from the fact that its very floral which contrasts to almost any food and refreshes your mind with a new smell and taste. In addition, its crisp dryness works well and requires very little bitterness for palette refreshment. I'd HIGHLY recommend not drinking this beer by itself, it was a really wonderful experience"
"You put one of history's most innovative chefs and the sommeliers of the world's most famous restaurant in a room together and they came up with a witbier? I never ate at El Bulli but from my impressions this beer is no different - beyond the fancy presentation and considerable price tag there's nowhere near the amount of substance it is hyped up to have."
"Pours a golden-yellow colour with thick white head that dissipates down, leaving a small ring above the beer. Some mild lacing on the glass. Smells of clove, other unidentified spices, wheat and oranges. Flavour is slightly tart, little bit sweet as well. Really smooth mouthfeel. A really nice witbier. I'd be likely to buy more of this if it wasn't so expensive (almost twice the price of Blanch du Chambly in Ontario)."
"Flawless and drinkable Witbier, not as well balanced as a Hoegaarden though."
"Definitely recommended."
"better then I expected so that's never a bad thing, perhaps much better suited to some hot sun but I may drink it again even with our shitty weather"
"Pours a light copper color with a good deal of haze. White head with decent retention. Nose is light spice, citrus, pear, and a bit of might caramel. Taste is a bit plain with lift orange and coriander. Pretty good feel but the body is a bit off. A pretty interesting concept and all around a pretty good beer."
"Aroma is crisp, yeasty and wheaty with an undertone of lemon and a touch of sweetness. It pours a slightly hazy straw-yellow - not inspiring, but at least the snow-white head is fairly thick and fluffy and leaves decent lacing - an extra half point for that. Flavor is typically wheaty and yeasty with a faint lemon undertone, a teensy on the thin side but still potable. Texture is smooth, a bit watery, barely fizzy. I expected better from the appearance of the bottle, as well as the cost - I lost the slip so I'm not sure how much I spent, but it was not cheap. Don't think I'll be looking for this one again, but I'm glad I gave it a fair shake."
"Dare I say anyone could drink this? I would dare. This is an easy drinking, clean, no frills beer. It really has nothing that makes it stand out which could be it's downfall. On the other hand, this is a beer that would make a nice intro beer for non-craft drinkers. Glad I grabbed a couple bottles for the price I got them for."
"750 ml bottle, from Vinmonopolet. ABV is 4.8%. Pale straw colour, slightly hazy, huge to moderate white head. Moderate wheaty and citrussy aroma, with notes of coriander and orange peel, also a hint of liquorice (when you know it should be there). The flavour is moderately citrussy, with moderate notes of coriander. The liquorice is barely discernible in the flavour. Light bodied, not very sweet, with minimal hops. ""Empty"" finish, but an otherwise nice and refreshing beer."
"Nice fringe beer!"
"Poured bright, without much carbonation. Very lacy head, which diminished fairly quickly. Could actually watch the head collapsing on itself. The restaurant i had it in served it in a wine glass, as suggested. Good flavor, hints of orange peel on the tip of the tongue. Most surprisingly was the finish. Very dry. Paired very nicely with the sockeye salmon I had while on a visit in Vancouver"
"D: Not bad, a simple little beer that I probably held onto for a bit too long."
"An agreeable enough witbier, to be sure, pretty well balanced, if a bit more prevalent on the sweet malt side, than any of the now faded fruity, spicy offset. The accompanying booklet cum marketing spiel indeed promises a fair lot more than is actually delivered, but that's to be expected - this is just a more or less simply rendered, and drinkable wit, with or without food."
"Bottle: Poured a light yellow color ale with some white haze and a medium size foamy head with average retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of coriander and some orange peel notes is somewhat bland. Taste is also an average mix between some orange peel with notes of coriander and light wheat malt. Body is too thin for style with some good carbonation. Makes you wonder why El Bulli decided to get associated with this beer as this is really average overall."
"I would have loved to give it a go with the pairing recommendation of a citrus-based fish dish - could be quite nice. As is, an easy drinker that won't wow a seasoned craft beer drinker."
"This dry witbier is made for food, with it´s clear yeast, sitrus and floral components. A really good mouthfeel, but it lacks some concentration."
"A very good beer for warm weather. Went well with Swedish herring. Probably the best Spanish beer I've tried."
"Nice easy summer drinking, would be a regular if the price was a bit more reasonable."
"Although the beer is billed as a Witbier, Estrella Damm Inedit has many of the halmarks of Hoegaarden but with a more characterful spiciness and dryness."
"This was another beer of theres I got a chance to try as a sample that was interesting but not my overall cup of tea. It was very fruity and sweet wheat style beer. It certainly was something I could never see my self sitting down and drinking very much of at all. Just to sweet and too bland, and over citrusy to be my cup of tea. May be something that some witbier lovers would enjoy but just nothing special to me."
"Probably will not buy this one again. Incidentally, pouring it into a wine glass didn't change anything."
"D= more of a novelty try for me, interesting but I probably won't buy it again. Worth the try if you're into Witbier variations, but at a very high price if you do find it. Honestly, I'd rather put my money into Witte or Allagash, both of which are much less expensive and also better."
"Purchased in Whitehorse, Yukon.Pours hazy yellow with massive, soapy head. Aroma of hops, hay and some citrus. Taste was light and slightly bitter with a sour, drawn out finish. Light carbonation and a thin body. Overall pleasant, but not terribly memorable. I feel that so much more could be done with this beer. Perhaps in future incarnations."
"D: Refreshing. Witbiers usually are, and this one is no exception. Really interesting that this one is brewed in Spain (I've only had rather boring lagers from Spain before)."
"Drinkability: refreshing on a hot day, but I would choose one of the many other witbiers first."
"Over all, I am extremely let down. With all the good things that I'd heard here and the huge price tag, I was expecting something much better. I will not purchase this again."
"A snazzy looking bottle, Estrella casts a golden glow with a hazy yellow punch. Not the cleanest looking brew, a little hard to see through. A nice pillow of white fluff stood above and retreated, leaving nothing. Smells mostly of pale malt and hay with some aroma hops. Getting some honey in the taste along with a very light sweet malt and apple skins. Some yeasty bread and the like. Feel is on the light side and tame in flavor although it's pretty well balanced, carb is on the low end. Very drinkable and approachable for many people, this is one that I would share with people that are not ""big into beer"". I hear this is the ultimate pairing beer when it comes to food, I prefer local 1 instead."
"D- its a rather tame beer but super drinkable. Pairs well with lots of stuff but I guess that's what they were going for. Easy drinking here."
" Body is light, bright, and airy, very refreshing and thirst-quenching. Although the flavor profile is a bit sweeter than I look for in a witbier, it's still quite pleasant, and the mouthfeel is lovely. A bit pricey, but a very enjoyable beer."
"Courtesy Paul B, thanks amigo. Decent enough. Poured with a small off white head and a tiny bit of lace. Color is a cloudy amber. Aroma is quite a mild spicey, citrus, yeast, and malt. Flavors the same only bolder. Body is a bit thin but good carbonation. Finish is like flavor and fairly short. Could be a session for the right mood."
" I think its a great beer, altough its pricey. This bottle cost 9.99."
"750 ml. bottle. Pours a hazy pale golden colour, with a good head that holds for a while and leaves a lace. Smell is clean, some spices, coriander, citrus, all very faint, I can't appreciate the liquorice. Watery in the tongue, it tastes of spices, banana and flowers. I think is a try to make a wit beer adapted to the big market, with te results one can expect: nothing to do with the real thing, though is refreshing and drinkable."
"This is a great beer NOW i have to try it with the food pairings it suggests."
"Really a nice Wit. The spicing is just about perfect, noticeable, but not overwhelming, and the addition of licorice is a nice touch that sets this apart from most other Wits. Indeed, this would be a nice pairing with food, I'm thinking some mussels or other shellfish and/or a fresh leafy greens salad with vinaigrette. I'd take this over many American, and even a few Belgian versions of the style."
"A nice wit... Easy enough to drink. A bit pricey at about 10 bucks a bottle, but certainly worth trying at least once!"
"D_This is a fantastic Wit and one I hope to encounter again. It hits all the right notes for the style without getting into the cloying zone that some manage to do. Well balanced and tasty. highly recommended."
"D 750ml, no problem. session beer, makes me think hot day in summer."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied, with zippy bits of carbonation tickling the palate."
"Would like to have a bit more in the feel. Very light, slight carbonation. Went well with a variety of soft cheeses and bread. Brought out the orange zest. Very easy drinking. Would go well with many meals methinks."
"Drinkability - This is good enough to savor if a bit clumsy."
"This is an odd beer, it isn't that bad, it isn't worth the price but it isn't a bad beer at all. I wasn't expecting this high caliber brew for this brewery or this distinct of a brew."
"After drinking it, I understand why it was made to pair with food, especially fish dishes. I liked the promo booklet attached to the bottle to give some of the history in making this beer and would try it again with a meal. I wish it was a tad bit less expensive, as it was not worthy of the price paid for it."
"A very interesting brew that probably will pair very well with a number of flavours and dishes, without being ""too much""."
"Notes: What an interesting marketing ploy. Expectations from a star gourmet pairing with a macro brewer to produce a better beer would seem to deserve an opportunity. At least a somewhat mediocre brew but one that would have helped to raise the average offering would have been rather welcome... But this? Pretense without the substance, and all that marketing and elitism can accomplish... Well, that is unfortunately a better sense of what this is all about. So much for Adria doing beer."
"Overall, not a good beer. Weak in aroma and completely void in taste with watery mouthfeel. A mess. Don't recommend. I think I paid $10 for it so even more of a disappointment. Rotation - avail in TX but one and done for sure."
"Pours a three-finger white head that fades slowly to a thin layer and leaves some lace. Yeasty orange nose. Hazy amber color. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Flavor is orange with the yeast in background. Nice wit. $9.99 for a 750ml bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"Poured into a pint glass, this beer is a very hazy, cloudy tan color with a small, thick head. Excellent wit aroma, with a large amount of coriander, and a sharp scent of bitter oranges. The coriander isn't as strong in the taste, but it's present. The most obvious flavor is a sweet, acidic citrusness, with a yeasty hint of honey. Tart and refreshing. The body is odd: it's quite carbonated, yet it feels thin and watery. Otherwise, a well-crafted wit."
"It should be noted that this beer retails for $5.86 Can at our government stores which is much less than the $10 US quoted in previous reviews"
"Pours a cloudy, straw yellow color with a small white head. Very hazy. The aroma is yeasty with a little bit of coriander but not too much else. Still, it smells nice. The flavor is not what I was expecting, as I didn't get any orange or coriander. I got a lot of peach flavor, which was nice, even if unexpected. The beer has a very light mouthfeel with lots of carbonation. Not true to the style, but still a very refreshing beer."
"D - Not the extreme beer, but a nice session."
"Drinkability - tasty but over-priced. Spend the sawbuck at your local brewpub's wit instead, it'll go so much farther."
"Overall, a fairly tasty Spanish beer that pushes a few envelopes as a Witbier-Lager hybrid, but ultimately needs some more ""oomph"" given the pricetag and pomp surrounding it."
"I would buy this beer again."
"75cl bottle. Inedit is not a traditional witbier; it's actually blended with a lager. Pours a cloudy orange-gold with a substantial white cap that recedes to leave very nice lacing. Huge bouquet of coriander and orange. Tangy wheat in the background; quite floral. Heavily spiced taste, with plenty of coriander and orange peel again. Citric, yet quite sweet right up to the finish. Light-medium body. Decent, but slightly overspiced."
"I am hoping that Barcelona's got something more exciting for me to pour, if anyones got something spanish to try I'd be happy to hear about it."
"This beer is infinitely drinkable, very refreshing and has a good flavor. Perfect for summer or after mowing the lawn, but at $9.99 is a little cost prohibitive."
"D- Overall, this is a decent beer but probably not something I'd pick up again especially at the steep $10 a bottle. Not worth the price."
"Not being familiar with this beer I was surprised to see it listed here as a Witbier as it really doesn't display much of that character in any aspect. Pretty clean though and certainly goes down quick on a hot summer night."
"Drinkability: It's terribly easy to drink and I wish it was on tap around here instead of the macro style lagers. If it were a tad more crisp it would be refreshing and have a higher score for drinkability."
"Pours just a slightly pale banana peel pilsner hay color. Very quick, bright white bubbly head that recedes to nothing. The bubbling is just awesome, almost frantic. Gypsum, banana, and chammomile aroma are subtley picked up the a deep nasal inhale. Parched pilsner malt and dry wheat start the flavor profile first. The middle has the yeast adding a banana peel flair to the middle. The finish tops everything off with some mild herbal hints of chammomile and grains of paradise. Very carbonated beer, but thin in palate. Brisk and refreshing, while at the same time, a little bland and boring. Overall, OK."
"Good looking bottle; like a Champagne bottle. Pale yellow color with a thin white head. Minimal wheat aroma. Taste is like a bland impression of a good Belgian witbier. Very little of the coriander/citrusy flavor I expect from the class. Fairly light bodied, and quite easy drinking. Not something I'd go out of my way to buy again."
"This beer was designed to be paired with food, and while we had Rich O's famous beer cheese and pizza, I don't think that we got to see this beer in its fullest because we weren't able to pair it with the selections of food it was meant to pair. That said, I still enjoyed this beer, but it would probably shine even more in the right environment with the right gourmet selections to highlight its unique characteristics."
"Avoid."
"This isn't a stellar witbier, and I would have pegged it as a very bready, lemony, and fizzy lager, but witbier it is. This was a nice change up beer, quite light, a bit floral, very refreshing on a hot summer day. The beer isn't brilliant, but it was enjoyable at the time for what it was."
"Bottle from one of the Sacramento BevMo!s. Interesting bottle with an odd, dubious-claim-filled tag ('the first beer brewed to be paired with food""). $9.99. Pours with a massive white head...just all foam at first. With a more careful pour, a yellowish to light brown body is revealed. slightly cloudy. Smells vaguely of citrus and tangy wheat. Flavor is very clean and interesting. Mild tangy wheat with oranges and some yeastiness. Mild and dry. Not quite medium bodied, but not noticeably thin either. drinks quite well despite the pretentious bottle...still, not quite worth the price tag."
"While a great all around beverage it lacks the roasted notes that I like in beer. Very smooth, malty."
" Not exactly the holy grail of beers from the spainards but not bad at all."
"D: As notes, this is supposed to be a blend of lager and wit, but actually it comes out more as a wit diluted with lager. It doesn't taste bad or anything - actually it's kind of refreshing and it has some nicely tasting flavors - but it's just boring. The smell is definitely the highlight of the beer, and not even that is more than ok. It is no way near of living up to the boasting presented in the cheesy note around the bottle neck."
"I wouldn't complain if someone handed me a cold glass on a hot summer day, but I wouldn't be terribly excited either. Certainly won't pay for it again."
"Edit: Oh...licorice...that's the flavor on the back of the tongue that I couldn't place. Interesting. Unique twist."
"taste of weak fruit, grain, coriander, and some other spices, as the tag said it was better with food, but still lacking something."
"Drinkability: This is another inoffensive highly drinkable wheat ale. The carbonation stands out and the flavor profile is good. I will probably not buy another bottle of this, but would look for it on draft. I think it would make a good starter beer for the style."
"Average at best. Hardly drinkable as well. Too watery. Avoid."
"Notes: Glad to have tried it but I will not likely buy it again. Just too boring."
"Overall, I have always been convinced that most of Estrella's creations are bad. But if only all of their beers could be this good...."
"Pours cloudy golden with a huge fluffy head. Malty, wheaty aroma, slight citrus and spice. Nice lacing. The flavor is sour wheaty, astringint, with a hint of spice, apricot and citrus. The mouthfeel is thin with a little sourness in the back. White wine like. Light. As it warms, apple notes become quite pronounced."
"Pours a mostly transparent pale yellow color with slight haze and a medium sized pure white head. Tons of sweet banana in the nose. Soft characteristics in both aroma and flavor, bubblegum, ginger, lemon skin, toasty wheat is pretty subtle, fruity yeast. Good body, could use a touch more carbonation IMO. I like the idea of a ""food beer"" i think it should be a little more neutral however, the banana /bubblegum flavor is almost overpowering and boarding on artificial."
"This is a nice surprise from Spain, a place I usually wouldn't expect to find a high quality ale."
"D - Drinkable but only worth having once."
"This beer has a little booklet attached that says it was brewed specifically to go with food. Also says it is brewed with coriander, orange peel, and licoroice. Use of both barley and wheat along with bottle conditioning alludes to a Belgian style of some sort or other. Seems to be dated 07/09, so should be fresh. Hazy, lemonade-like yellow color, like a witbier. Big, puffy, white head -- velvety and natural. Unusual, bright, slightly citrus-peely (but not sour) nose. Also some sweetish, vanilla tones, and just a hint of toasting. A tad of white pepper like dryness. Light, fizzy mouth feel - quite champagne-like. Not much flavor. Rather offish, actually, with dull cardboardy notes. I cannot detect any of the advertised spices. Label does not indicate % alcohol, but I'd guess around 4-5%. Great nose, good body, poor flavor. This beer seems as though it has been poorly handled and has been damaged. And I dropped $10.50 for this sucker at Whole Foods! I'll have to try it again from another supplier."
"Pours a foggy yellow with a white head. Nose is airy. Flavor is very interesting. Nice and complex enough, but light enough that it keeps it food friendly (as it's intended to be.) Interesting aftertaste that's worth noting. Almost like a light honey thing. Floral and spice tones are evident. But the honey just hits on numerous fronts and I like it. Almost seems like there's a bit of vanilla there as well. Even and nowhere near overpowering citrus is there as well. Carbonation feels a bit unusual. It's almost like champagne in a way? Definitely not typical, but it's not outlandish. Liquid is slick and smooth. This is an exquisite beer. Portrays many characteristics you normally see in other beers but delivers it in a more refined way with layers of character."
