"O - Enjoyable, but not what I've come to expect from Anchorage."
"Overall - Pleasant flavor, but it drops off leaving only lemon, really.  Still, I quite enjoy it."
"Lemon, citrus, light Brett, white pepper, oak, slightly watery, very sessionable"

"This is a very interesting beer. It seems like in about 6 months or so it'll be perfect, but unfortunately, I believe a beer should be ready at bottling. Despite this nitpicking, this is still a pretty tasty beer."

"O- I don't know if I happened to crack this bottle at the right time or what, but this is amazing.  I can't stop taking sips it's so damn good.  So funky in the aroma and initial flavor but so clean in the aftertaste and mouthfeel.  Absolutely exquisite."
"More of a sour beer to me than a witbier. This beer has a ton of brett that lends funky barnyard, hay, and lambs wool aromas. Lemony and tart, with the classic wit spices playing their more traditional role. An interesting blend of styles."

"Crisp, tart on the front, spicy yet smooth in the back. A well executed sour wit."

"Pours a hazy straw yellow with fizzy white head, sparse blobs of lace on the glass. Smell: bread dough, coriander, herbal brett, pepper note. There's a promise of brett on the label and a hint of it here but it's not doing much yet. Taste: doughy with plenty of lemon, light pepper; mild tartness  of lemon and grape skin and slightly lactic. Grape skin and oaky note in the finish. A nice take on a wit with restrained brett presence. Batch #3 June 2014."

"Hazy yellow body with a small white head. Complex aroma of coriander, wheat, light misc. spice, grass, floral notes, white wine. A tasty beer for sure. Additional notes of tart citrus and black peppercorns. Saison characteristics. Delicious."

"Poured a clearish yellow with two finger head and nice lace retention on top of an aroma of spice and yeast, along with minimal citric notes and that brett is coming through. A touch of sweetness in this one for some reason, as the yeast is prevelant and helps make the beer fuller bodied and smooth. The spices and citric notes are there and the brett gives it a nice funky taste on the backbite which is pleasant. An interesting beer as the brett addition works well and is something I wouldn't have thought would work with a witbier, but it adds some complexity to beer without overshadowing the traditional witbier components (yeast/wheat twang. clove/corriander spices, lemon/citric tastes)."

"O: surprisingly drinkable. Not overly flavorful, but I find myself liking it as I drink more. Very sharp and dry, but crisp and refreshing at the same time. Not great, but better than expected."

""

""

"O: Well-made overall, nice complexity, I like how the Brett & Sorachi Ace hops interact with their unique characteristics"
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a clear bright yellow color ale with a medium pure white foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of Brett and Chardonnay is quite dominant with light peppercorn and spicy yeast notes also perceptible. Taste is a good mix between some dry Brett notes with some Chardonnay notes with some clearly vinous notes and some spicy peppercorn notes which don’t really fit in too well with the rest of the flavours. Body is light with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. This is quite enjoyable though with the amount of Brett and Chardonnay notes I am not sure I would call this a wit beer any more. Some spicy notes of peppercorn could be removed since they don’t really bring anything valuable to the whole mix."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a delicious witbier that really seems to be thrown into ""tweener"" categorization given the brett and age on this bottle. Funkier than a traditional witbier, which gives it some of the characteristics of tart wheat beers and/or saison-style ales. I do hope that Anchorage brews another batch of this one so that I can taste it fresh, but that doesn't really seem to be their M.O."

"My second beer from Anchorage and they've hit this one out of the park. I'm not sure what to think about a nearly clear beer. I also find these dry sour beers tend to not have a lot of aroma. That said this beer's parts shouldn't be used to judge it."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, Batch 2 bottled March 2012. Pours lightly hazy golden straw color with a foamy 3 finger bright white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of tart apple, pear, lemon, white wine, hay, grass, funk, acidity, pepper, and yeast spiciness. Fantastic aromas with huge complexity and balance. Taste of apple, pear, lemon zest, white wine, pepper, floral, hay, grass, light funk, wheat, earth, and herbal spiciness. Slight tartness and moderate earthy spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, white wine, pepper, hay, grass, wheat, earth, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Great flavor complexity and balance; with a nice malt/peppery flavor balance with nice brett flavors; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very crisp, smooth, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Wibier! Huge complexity and balance of flavors; and extremely smooth to drink, though I prefer to sip on this one. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
""
"O. This is a very nice witbier, but it was also highly expensive. But definitely worth a once goaround."
""
""
"I was hoping for more than this brought to the table. Not really bad-- but this is below many wheat beers in my opinion... The previously me toned Whaleback Wit is a perfect example."
""
"O - Very enjoyable. My wife particularly liked it."
"Appearance is - doesn’t do a whole lot for me, being a washed out yellow with an effervescent white head. Looks too much like an industrial lager. However, one shouldn’t judge a book by its cover. At least it has little bubbles rising in it, sort of like champagne. Strong aroma is fruity and rather sweet, more like a cider than a beer. Maybe the Chardonnay barrels imparted this. Flavor is - oh yeah, it keeps getting better! A malty core with firm fruity and yeasty notes, rather sweet but not cloying, just a hint of grapes and a subtle sour tone. Lively texture has plenty of fizz, though body seems to be a bit lacking. Overall, pretty good."
""
"O - A good beer with above average drinkability. Would enjoy this one after a meal, although I cannot justify the price being quite so high."
""
""
""
"Poured from bottle into tulip. Pours a straw color with thick foam. Lots of brett aromas, mixed with spice and wheaty malts. Lots of brett flavor also, slightly bitter, citrus and spicy pepper. Its dry but drinkable. It has a lot of body and personality, just a bit over spiced and dry for me. Nice brew...its intersting enough that id have again and would recommend it for sure."
""
"Overall, a nice wit. I like what the barrel did to it. An earlier sample had more predominant brett."
""
"Nice light body and mod-high carbonation."
""
"Picked this one up after really enjoying the galaxy IPA and bitter monk. This was bright yellow, a little cloudy. Smell was yeasty with just a hint of wine barrel, not bad. Taste had some lemon to it, a bit of the chardonnay, some brett but overall it was still a wit and just did not move me like the other tow anchorage beers I've had. I'd buy bitter monk again if I see it and I'd love to try the lovebuzz saison but I would not buy this one again, especially for $15."
"O: Certainly an interesting wit. This beer is very dry for the style with a nice fruitiness and lemon and wheat character. As it warms, the wine barrel comes out more and balances the beer out nicely."
"O - This is a nice witbier. Anchorage continues to impress with unique and delicious beers."
"The beer pours a clear piss yellow with no haze and a disappointingly thin white head (for a wit). There is no lacing or sediment. The nose is pleasant and sweet with a bretty funkiness and white wine/citrusy tartness. As the beer warms the citrus becomes more pronounced. However, the the taste is relatively weak and disappointing. Brett predominates the flavor profile with a mild, lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel is completely watery and weak although the flavors are balanced and drinkable. Overall, this isn't worth the price ($15) nor worth cellaring."
""
"Amazing! I’m pretty sure it’s impossible for Anchorage to produce anything less than extraordinary."
"It's another magical and whimsical ale that uses a lot of traditional and indigenous flavors but combines them in neuvo rustic charm."
""
"Light bodied and well carbonated with soft carbonation that sweeps across the tongue. Very easy to drink and refreshing."
""
"O- I'm not too big of a witbier fan, but I'm on a new tip of trying beers from styles I normally neglect. I guess starting off my witbier samplings with Anchorage was a great idea. Very good. I could drink this all day. Awesome."
""
""
"Drinkability is very high, a fantastic Wit. I thought Anchor was my favorite, but he's pushed it again with a whole re-write, and came out with a home-run."
""
""
"This is my first beer from Anchorage Brewing Company. I’m rather impressed. You don’t see many Brett-infused, wine barrel-aged Witbiers. I like the trailblazing character of this one. Even better, it’s good beer. There is quite a bit going on, but the flavors all work well together. If you’re looking to check out Anchorage Brewing Company, this seems like a fine place to start."
""
"The label gives one the impression that this is some monster of a brew, but the truth is that it is a delicate, pretty well balanced witbier that I would be happy to have again."
"Shared this one while hanging out by the pool in Florida with the aasher wedding party! Poured a slightly hazy pale yellow with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount very slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, wood, spice, tart, and earthy funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, funk, earth, and wood. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. There was something a little offputting on this one. Most of the things I have had from Anchorage have been spot on, however the addition of Brett to a Witbier might have been a little much for my palate as they didn’t blend as well as some I’ve had in the past. Still fairly tasty, but nothing standoutish. Worth trying, but that is about it."
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall impression - I don't care for this at all."
"O: This is another beer that seems somewhat uneven. Not bad, but not as good as others of the style (e.g., Allagash White). Still, drinkable."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer. Witbier, Saison, Belgian Pale, Wild Ale...whatever you wanna' call it, this is refined and delicious. I wish I had more bottles of this. The only sour and/or funky witbier that's better than this is 2011 Boulevard Two Jokers."
""
""
"Overall this is a really good beer. The brewer comes with an impressive pedigree and I am excited to try more of their beers."
"D - Very drinkable. Really nice complex witbier beer with the Brett flavor really blended in nicely. Super crisp and refreshing as well."
"O - Quite a disappointment for me. Just no where near as flavorful as I'd hoped, and the watery body doesn't help. I'll look for a second bottle in the future in the hopes this was a fluke."
""
"Batch 1. Pours a very hazy, bright golden straw color with a medium white head that diminishes quickly. Scent is...HOLY SHIT... pardon my French, but that was the first thing I thought. This thing is BEYOND funkier than I was expecting. Definitely the funkiest aroma of all the Anchorage beers...I hate to say it, because I like the aroma, but it reminds me of farts. At first, you get a stinky ""fart-like aroma"" with a hint of bile. Then I get some delightful brett funk with lemon and citrus. Very crazy, yet favorable aroma. As it warms, the Chardonnay barrel really comes through Taste is initially light and crisp...refreshing...like a classic witbier or berliner. A lot of wheat flavor with lemon and some tart, brett flavors. Nice chardonnay flavor. Tons of barnyard and some floral flavors. Finish is packed with pepper and light hops. Mouthfeel is light-bodied, crisp, and refreshing. Overall, I could see the aroma of this beer turning people off...but I'm a man who loves some funk in his barrel-aged wild yeast beers. Great beer!"

"Sounds: SPK - Metal Field"

"Pours an apple juice hue which leaves a wispy fast vanishing one finger heaad and little lacing,the smell is typical brett along with must,spice and barnhouse funk,the mouthfeel is light bodied and thirst quenching with tastes of citrus zest,apple juice,white grapes,a slight mustiness,a touch of funk and finished with white grape dryness and overall its alright and nice for a hot summers day but would not buy again in a hurry."
""
""
""
"O - A really, really nice beer. Just slightly under what I get from Fantome Saison. It's right in that ballpark. I really wish I could have tried Bitter Monk fresh, but now that I tried this, I'm gonna find a bottle with the faded hops and see how it goes."
"O- a well made wit with brett, light malt light hops, barrell aged, another great brew from anchorage"
""
"I LOVE every other beer Anchorage has made so I'm surprisingly underwhelmed by this offering. Needs to be more sour to keep up with the others (for sure) and could really use either some complimentary hops or more wit spices in addition to more souring."
"jd"
""

""
""
"Difficult to rate as it sort of throws the style guidelines out the window. If you like tart funky renditions of classicaly refreshing ales, this will be perfect for you, but I don't think these elements should dominate the base beer as much as they do here."
"O- Brutally sour to me. I can't handle this one."
"O: While very enjoyable, not an easy drinker or very sessionable beer. The alcohol is well hidden and there is very little bitterness but somehow this beer felt a little like work to drink."
"O: This beer is an interesting take on the style—it’s not as refreshing compared to other witbiers but the brettanomyces and wine barrel aging give it unique flavors."
"This was another interesting effort from Anchorage. Unlike the other two we tried here, this one seemed to put the base Witbier more at the forefront but it didn’t override the wild and barrel character, just allowing them to an extra layer of refreshing complimentary flavor to this."
""
"O- The brett dominates especially in the nose but that is a good thing. The bright lemony character is a bit flurried but everything seems to work together."
"While this is not what comes to mind (personally so of course it's subjective and you can dismiss this statement) when I think of a Wit, it still is a great interpretation and I would definitely have it again."
""
""
"This is very close to a 4.5 overall."
""
""
"This is a light bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is light and refreshing with an interesting arrangement of character. This brew starts off a little ackward but pulls itself together a bit as it warms up and breaths. Don't rush yourself through this brew, give it a chance without writing it of after a single tick, I mean sip."
"This beer is just a terrible mash up of flavors."
""

"an extremely good wit. The brett on this does make it different. Since I generally love sour characteristics, it's fine by me, but this may not work for a lot of people. That said, this is and has been enjoyable with a real refreshing style"
"O: I think this beer is really good. I haven't seen this beer hit the shelves in Buffalo yet, but if it was there, I'd pick up a bottle. I'm really enjoying what Anchorage is doing with their bottled beers."
""
""
"O: Not much wheaty wit character or spicy phenols. Funky, which is not traditional for a Wit. These is when becoming a style whore does not help brewing creativity. This is a great beer, but does not really fall into the traditional definition of a ""Wit"" beer. Nevertheless the time and effort that went into creating this triple fermented beer was well spent. I love it."
""
"Drink- For a 1st offering from Anchorage this was pretty good. I'd give the other two beers that every one raves a bot a chance but I am don’t think I am willing to drop $20 on them yet."
"Split a bomber of this with a friend, cool looking bottle and story on the glass. Pours a golden yellow, plenty of carbonation and head to it. Sharp, fruity aroma to it. Taste is very wine-like, with a nice wit background. Supposedly it's aged on Chardonnay barrels which you can definitely taste. An interesting beer for sure, more recommended for people who enjoy wine/champagne, but solid none the less.. also first time I've had an Alaskan beer!"
""
"750 ml bottle poured a clear yellow with a lasting white head. Aromas of straw, lemon, barnyard funk, wheat, white wine, floral notes, light oak and light coriander. Palate was light bodied and crisp with a dry finish. Flavors of straw, lemon, barnyard funk, peppeer, white wine, light coriander and light oak with a crisp dry lingering funky citrus finish."
""
""
""
"This is great. I love the mix of Brett, oak, and wine barrels here. It works perfectly. Unlike with Bitter Monk, where nothing but hops come through. I would love to share this with a wine drinker to see what they think. Highly recommended."
"This one is a little bit heavy handed with the spices for me, but it is a well-made beer. Quite complex and interesting. I really look forward to trying the other options that are available from Anchorage."
"o: one of the better witbiers I've had. clearly the brett and barrel aging help this one."
""
""
"Thin, highly carbonated, refreshing mouthfeel that works for a delicate beer like this. Highly recommended if you're looking for something different. Also, not like any other witbier I've had."
"O- Haven't had this style in a while. Nice refreshing drink. Flavors were a little more subdued than I would have wanted them. But still a good blend, making for a nice drink."
""
""
"Cheers!"
"Notes: An interesting beer, tasty for sure. A little more restrained on the brett than Bitter Monk and Lovebuzz (which I appreciate). Shows more balance and finesse."
""
"O- Not sure what to think about this one? I guess it's a wit by style, but nothing really noticeable of a wit with the brett added. Not a fan."

"O: One of the best witbiers I’ve had. The brett wasn’t as potent as I was expecting, but it added a nice dimension to the flavor. The white wine barrels adds a nice light vinous quality and dried out the mouth in a way that I felt was an improvement over other heavier, sweeter, wits I’ve had. Recommended."
"This beer poured out as a pale cloudy yellow color with a fizzy yet durable white head on top. The head had a strong retention that lasted for quite a while. The lacing was minimal though. The smell of the lemon zest and French Oak were the strongest aromas I could pick up. The faint aromas of spices were in there too. The smell of the Oak made me think this beer was going to be much more sour or tart but to my surprise it was actually pretty mellow. The flavors had a good amount of wheat notes along with the oak and spice in the mix. The mouthfeel was pretty good also, nice and light bodied, fairly refreshing also. Overall this beer was pretty good, I'd probably drink it again but I'm more excited to try some of Anchorage's other brews they put out now. This was my first Alaskan beer and I enjoyed it. Looking forward to having more from that state some day."
"Overall this beer could use some balance to counter the Chardonnay sweetness but is still pretty impressive. Another solid offering from this up and coming brewery."
"$14 a bottle make it a tough call, but its top notch for style, even if it especially blurs the style line, but its for the better."
"T: Very dry and light. Lemon rind, baby aspirin, hints of brett and some white pepper. I really loved this one."
"Nice, challenging beer, but also refreshing. Lots to like in this."
"Verrrry interesting beer. You pour it and expect a witbier, but you smell it, you taste it, and you get this Brett-ed out funk-o-tron. Foremost aroma: sulfur, I imagine from the chardonnay barrels. The taste upfront is a mild wheat and then there's a long middle and after-taste of brett-ed out french oak barrel. This shit is off the chain. Even at a light abv of 6.5%, the brett makes it an almost overwhelming(for me) beer. Great for a new experience."
"O: Overall some interesting twists flavor wise, especially from the chardonnay barrel aging, though equally as strange to be utilized with this style as well. Nice visual, the nose a bit weak strength wise as well the mouthful. A 3.5 overall feels about good here, with a moderate drinkability, though mostly curious with a bomber playing well."
"M / O. Delightful high carbonation, with a succuelent citrus-spice wine finish that turns dry and slightly fruity towards the very end. Incredibly fun to drink. I love this brewery. Highly recommended, but know what you're getting into. Much like Bitter Monk, this really blows away the base style and transforms into something wonderful. Highly recommended - Anchorage is doing great work right out of the gate."
"O: I am not a stickler for style at all, but I think for something to go out of style it must be really showing me something in terms of flavor. This one comes off a bit convoluted, despite being not a bad beer at all. There's more chardonnay than witbier in this for me, and I wish it was the other way around. That said, perhaps holding on to a case of all these new anchorage beers wouldn't be a bad investment. The problem of course being that all of these are 15$ a bottle. Not sure the beer currently justifies the price, but that's my only real gripe. Quite good, just not of the higher tier."
"Unfortunately not the best glass in the world, but when you pack up to move, you use what you can get. This beer pours a pale lemon yellow with a decent 2 inch bright white cap that leaves just a little bit of lacing down the sides of the glass. After I popped the top hints of must and grandmas old attic closet waft my way. Nice brett aroma. As it gets closer to the sniffer the brett comes across as damp earth and musty closest. Hints of lemon peel and spice. Just a little bit of pepper. The flavor is fantastic. Light and crisp. The brett is damp, wet earth with must and a bit of barnyard. Lemon zest and a bit of coriander. Really, it reminds me more of a saison or funky BdG then a wit. Really fantastic. The mouthfeel is a bit lacking. With as much brett, I thought it would finish a bit drier then it does. I was lucky enough to try this right after it came out at a tasting and I was extremely impressed with it. I was happy to see a lonely sitting on the shelf of one of my locals."
"O - Not too bad...not great. Decent. I'll hope for the best and open a bottle in a few months or so to see how this one is progressing. I'm hoping it gets better."
"Holy shit is this good. Complex but great balance. Wish I had another bottle. $15 out here in MA, and worth the trip from AK. These guys know what they are doing. A terrific Wit."
"A decent Belgian style witbier, with significant interesting sweetness from the brett. Fruity and interesting and different, very good for the style.Smooth mouthfeel and very good drinkability. A great bottle to share and accompany a good meal. Thanks Ryan."
"I love beers like this. Beers that push the boundaries, and which do it with such poise, sophistication and style. As for Anchorage Brewing Company? I only have to give a warning to Jolly Pumpkin—your awesome, to-style, funk-laden alchemy has a new competitor."
"Anchorage Brewing, wow. Keep killing it."
"O - Incredibly suprised by this beer. Super drinkable. Wish this was a bit cheaper than it is priced, but still, worth a try. Glad I bought this."
"O: This is overly carbonated which all but cancels out what might other wise be a plethora of subtle flavors... It's distractingly crisp. Still Whiteout is quite good even if it's not nearly as funky as the nose would have you believe. Also I've no knack for grammar, but coriander (""corriander"") is spelled wrong on the bottle. Haha."
"Notes: Quite a surprise! Another visiting brew given the local beer week at the time I guess. Quite an unexpected treat to find this on the shelf in any case. Pricing while not overwhelming is a touch steep but when barrel-aging and brett are involved this seems to be the common case. Other than that this is quite a refreshing and stimulating brew."
"O: I don't particularly gravitate to this style, but this beer is pretty tasty and complex. I probably wouldn't buy again though, but I think it's worth a try."
"Not a bad beer. I took my first few sips when it was just out of the fridge and all I got was the brett funk and a lot of skunkiness. Letting comes to temperature helped it out a lot."
"A good, solid beer, but not really anything to get terribly excited about either."
"A random case o' this found its way to my most local haunt, and I just had to try it. It pours a clear pale-golden straw topped by a healthy cap of white foam. The nose comprises white vinegar, Brett funk, tart lemon, sour mandarin orange, light white wine, coriander, and cardamom. The taste holds notes of Bretty cobweb, dry lemon peel, musty lemonade, light honey, coriander, cardamom, cedar, and a touch of spicy grape. The lemon starts out as a dagger-prick of tartness, but then falls off into a moldy version of the fruit, where it malingers for a bit, only to die off completely in the finish. Something here doesn't sit right with me... The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, fairly sticky finish. Overall, this was an interesting brew, one that partially succeeds and partially fails. After a short bit of research, I think I pinpointed the source of the strange flavor: Sorachi, my old nemesis. Alright, that would explain things a bit. Beyond my hate for this hop (and all that it does to lay waste to beers' flavors), this wasn't too bad. Kinda interested to see what a bit of age does to it now..."
"One of my colleagues spoke longingly of trying some of Anchorage Brewing Company's beers, touting that they age their beers in French Oak Chardonnay barrels which sounded lovely. Triple fermented...Brett yeast...YEAH. Once I learned that my friend works with the graphic designer for ABC's labels, I had to try some! I'm partial to a great Belgian Witbier, so picked up a cold 750 ml of Whiteout. It's a solid beer all around, a nice twist on a witbier. Poured a cloudy white-gold with a pillowy head and moderate lacing. A lot of orange peel in the smell. The taste, three flavors really stood out - black peppercorn and the Brett yeast, but really that chardonnay flavor from the aging popped out, so much that my cousin - a big wine dude - wanted to open a bottle of a California chardonnay he'd been sitting on and taste the two side-by-side. (We passed - a little too much for a Sunday afternoon watching baseball. But it would be a cool experiment.) Could pair this with roasted salmon or a summer's salad...or even a great cheese plate. Had an intense artisanal grilled cheese with heirloom tomatoes alongside Whiteout and the acidity of the tomatoes and the sharpness of the cheese matched the peppery flavors of the beer perfectly. A solid first dive into Anchorage - looking forward to trying their Saison next!"
"750ml corked and caged bottle served in a Blvd. Tank 7 tulip. Pours a pale straw with a quickly dissipating white head. Nice bretty aroma with a bit of oak. Light bodied. Starts off with a lot of wood. Decent tartness. Fairly dry and crisp. Oak fades a little but still lingers in the finish. Very drinkable. I thought the oak was a little strong at first, but it grew on me."
"O - This is a good brew. It would be nice during the summer time for sure. Very refreshing, citrusy and crisp."
"D - A nice mix of flavors. A little more brett presence would help but still tasty."
"Overall great, nice light Belgian malts and wheat, light spices are nice and not overpowering, nice brett character."
"Overall this is pretty interesting, relatively light, and fairly enjoyable. If it was cheap I might consider it as a nice alternative summer beer."
"The medley of flavors blend together to make a very enjoyable beer."
"O: No one at the tasting liked this. I'm completely mystified by its high score. Actually, considering its rarity and price tag, I'm not. $15 for this? Please."
"D - This is really easy to drink, and the spice character is quite understated which I prefer. There's perhaps a bit too much in the way of buttery oak and wine influence, but I imagine over time the brett character will grow in strength. I enjoyed this quite a bit."
"this is good, exceeded my expectations all around. reminds me a lot of a more brett influenced RR temptation."
"O: Was looking forward to this, but it's pretty pedestrian and not worth $15."
"Overall, it is refreshing, interesting, light, and nice. I would seek this out again for sure."
"This is a pleasant drinking witbier, but unusual, with lemon and chardonnay grape flavors that are uncharacteristic of the style. Could be a light saison in the style of Fantome. This beer is also clearer than typical witbiers. In any case, an interesting interpretation and one that shows a lot of thought and care in the making."
"Pours a slightly hazy super light yellow with a 2 inch puffy white head that fades to a craggy cap. Thin rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of wheat, lemons, and the funky brett smell. Taste is of buttered wheat bread, lemon peel, subtle spices, and some slight funky flavors. I have read that butter flavors aren't desirable in beer, but I am really enjoying this flavor. The barrel aging in the wine barrels is evident as a fruity woodiness. There is a a good level of carbontion with a dry, crisp mouthfeel on this one. Overall, this is a very good witbier from this upstart brewery. I am very impressed with this beer and this is one of the best of the style I have had. I will for sure be seeking out more offerings from this brewery in the future."
"Overall, this was a nice beer. I've never tried anything from Anchorage, but I'm interested to try more."
"Mouthfeel is pretty standard for the style, pretty thin and nicely carbed..."
"This is the type of beer that doesn't come around too often. Pushing boundaries and exploring new opportunities, while still making a delicious beer."
"Overall, not great. Maybe with some age this could mellow out a bit, but for now it’s probably more useful to spread on your skin for a sunny day at the beach, as the SPF is no doubt pretty high."
"Beer is light in body and very carbonated on the palate. Sweet, mild funk, very mild, good yeast character, mild spice. The beer goes down easy, overall it is a fine beer, I enjoyed it, I thought the brett character which was played up on the label was minimal but that's what i wanted tonight. I'd have it again."
"A unique experience though in my opinion not worth purchasing again."
"Give it a try; you may like it."
"The CPJ"
"Sampled at Julio's Belgian Beer Fest on August 14, 2011. The pour is a milky olive-yellow with a bubbly burst of fizzy head. It looks the part. But as I discovered it did not act the part. On the nose there were aromas of weak malts and an acidic zesty fruitiness. The body was lightweight. The taste tended to be very tart with grapefuit or pineapple flavors overwhelming everything else. There was a thin hop finish but that took a lot of energy to find."
"The mouthfeel is light with high carbonation. Overall I really enjoyed it. The Brett was pretty bold for the style, but I liked how it mixed with the Wit character. Very flavorful and easy drinking beer overall."
"mildly hazy white-gold with a white head. nose is spice, ester, and a slight wheaty twang followed by a hint of funk, must, a touch of wood and hints of chardonnay. the chardonnay notes seem to blend well with the fruity, bubblegummy, yeasty notes. i am actually getting a lot of traditional wheat here. taste seems natural and very well-balanced peppery, wheat-twang and spice with suggestions of fruit and bubblegum in the middle, and a nice, warm, chardonnay finish. very well done and understated in an elegant kind of way. light-medium body. clean finish. minimal aftertaste. overall a great beer. wish this was a bit cheaper. it could easily become a go-to summer session(able) for me if it was less expensive. very, very well made, but for some reason didn't totally turn my gears. excited to see the future of Anchorage. great first effort."
"Nice light feel with soft carbonation. Overall pretty decent here. I feel like it has some off aromas but otherwise this one is pretty tasty. A little unexciting and the aromas the only real qualm that I have here."
"I like this one, it's kind of pricey but quite complex in the taste."
"Overall quite entertaining but it sort of does not remind me of witbeer. Lemon and fruity citrus seems to be burried. I never get coriander off of witbeers, so I can't comment on not missing that... but there you have it. Overall not bad one unique tasting brew. Therefore, I call quite good overall."
"Overall: A light and refreshing beer. At $15 I have no desire to try it again. Still, nice to try once."
"Pours a cloudy semi-bright yellow color with a good two-finger white head. The nose is a bit bready with a slight sulfur character; it smells a bit like a fermenting berliner weiss. Behind that is a bit of coriander and citrus plus faint earthiness. The flavor is wheaty with a good citrus character and a good earthy presence. Mouthfeel is the best aspect with the barrel character and Brett really coming through for a nice body and dry finish. Well done and a fantastic summer sipper. A bit pricey for what it is, but if this were in six-packs for $10-12, I'd be drinking it all summer long."
"O: An absolutely phenomenal beer. Nothing traditional about it, but nothing boring either. I'm comparing this mentally to the BA Wit that Upright did. This is better. I followed up a 14 month old bottle of Orval with this. Whiteout held it's own in terms of flavor and complexity. At about $12 a bottle, this is an utter steal. Well done Mr. Fletcher... Well done. 4.5/5"
"There's no question that in terms of uniqueness this beer deserves a perfect 5. As far as how palatable it actually is, however, that's another matter. For the first time in years I've found a beer that's truly unfamiliar to me, but I'm not so sure how much I enjoyed it - I'd say the combination of witbier, pepper, lemon, wild yeast and chardonnay barrel is not exactly an ideal one, although I'd be happy to try it again (provided someone else foots the bill)."
"Barrel aged White Ale? Sounds good to me! Color is a very pale gold, with about two fingers of solid heading. The nose is lightly sour, and funky, almost like sticking your nose in to a jar of pickled eggs. The sour is not as pronounced in the flavor, but the funk sticks around. It also comes off bone dry in places. I especially get the black pepper and the chardonnay barrel influence. Mouthfeel is light to medium in body, with a good dose of carbonation. I love bottle conditioned beers, and this one is no exception. I could drink this white all day. All I can say is that after trying this brew, I cannot freaking wait to see what they come up with next."
"Ok, so that ignored all of the irrelevant and frivolous external factors contributing to my enjoyment of the beer. However, first, really Mr. Fletcher? Silk screening your face on your bottle? Blech. Out of your control though is what happens once the beer ends up in the distribution pipeline. For 7.99 I would happily buy cases of this beer. Heck, for 11.99 I would. But by the time Shelton Bros. and the shitty MD/DC distributor for them get their hands on it, I can't rationalize paying 17.99 plus tax for this particular beer. Bummer, my loss."
"Overall, this is the most original take on the Wit style that I've tasted. I'm really impressed with this first outing from the Anchorage Brewing Company. Looking forward to what they come up with next."
"Edit: Batch 01 May 2011"
"- Brettastic first release from Gary. A light sessionable wit with a really great funky and tart character. I hope to get a couple more to sit on for awhile and see what happens. I knew this guy would kick off with a killer start. It's an amazing feat to be able to brew such specialty beers, and actually distribute them."
"O-First beer I've tried from this new brewery and I am definitely a fan. Can't wait to see what they come out with next!"
"O: A really interesting, intriguing beer. I'm not aware of other examples of soured wit beers and it seems like something which could easily have gone wrong. But, it works well in this beer. I've got another bottle that I'm going to age for a while and see how it develops."
"In summary, this beer is another masterpiece from Gabe Fletcher. I don't think I've ever had a beer that would be a better choice for a warm, summer's day, or as an aperitif before a fine dinner, or as an accompaniment to a nice salad. Run, don't walk to buy this beer. At less than $9 a bottle, it's ridiculously reasonable, and if you're in to beer trading, this stuff will be worth its weight in gold (or at least in beers from the East Coast). Once again, I have to tip my hat to Gabe. Well played, sir, well played. I can't wait to taste the next beer that emerges from his creative genius."
"I'm a big fan of Midnight Sun, where Gabe (the one man show behind Anchorage Brewing Company) was the brewmaster for quite a while. I even judeged IPA's at a homebrew competition with him once. But I'm not as wild about Wits or Bret... That said, Gabe has pretty much hit the spot with this first bottled offering from Anchorage Brewing Company. This is by far the most complex and interesting Wit I've ever had, and it is incredibly well balanced. I am very impressed. And thankful that we got a few cases in my little, remote town. ... I made my notes before I read the bottle. I picked up on the lemon peel easily, but the corriander and peppercorns slipped by me."
