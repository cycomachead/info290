"O- Very nice wit, one of the better ones I've had. Pretty much true to the style."

"Nice taste, on light lemon. Excellent for aperitive. A must to try for wit bier fans!"
"Overall: That's a darned good witbier, verging into sour territory just a touch while retaining the complexities of phenols and esters one would want in a wit. If I could find this for under $5 a bottle, I'd make it a regular in my fridge. Even at that price, for the way this approaches the realm of a sour beer, it'll make repeat appearances."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Tons of flavor and a lot of tanginess, a very nice witbier."
"Excellent example of a wit. Bigger and more complex than Hoegaarden, but just as refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I like witbiers in general, and the products of St. Bernardus in particular so this was bound to be a winner for me, and it doesn't disappoint - if your idea of a good witbier stops at Hoegaarden or Blue Moon then you owe it to yourself and your palate to check this out; it's in a completely different league."
"O: A pretty great beer! A fantastic blend of flavor for a Witbier."

"Pours a hazy straw yellow with a fizzy head that trails the glass. Smells of Belgian wheat with sweet fruits like banana and fresh bread. The taste was very refreshing with light sweet notes finishing with a crisp mint flavor that I enjoyed. Would highly recommend."
""
""
""
""
"Not going into great detail, suffice to say, a glass of cloudy brilliance."

"o: a killer witbier.  huge aroma.  loaded with flavour but finishes clean and dry.  excellent mouthfeel"

"Did not enjoy too much. The first thing I noticed was a strong iron smell (like a strong mineral smell). Supposed yeast bear, but does not taste like bread. Initial taste is like mineral water (almost no flavour) then it has a ""yeast"" taste that becomes kinda strong, which was slightly bitter."

"Overall: at first thought it was too light all around, but after several sips flavour builds and it all comes together as a subtle brew not trying too hard - simple and highly drinkable, pure and clean"
""
""
""
"Excellent overall."

""
"Rating: B"

"It's late, so I'm doing an Overall portion on this review. The appearance is world class. Hazy as hell and unfiltered, just how I like it! The aroma has that straw and wheat sweetness with bold spices and subtle fruity yeast notes. The taste is of unfiltered wheat grains and spices (coriander/peppercorns). Faint metallic with a great nobel hop finish. Dry and semi-sweet with lingering peppercorns in the aftertaste.the body is light and refreshing. I can crush this all day long. This brew is recommended."

"Overall- quite simply the best wit I've ever had, that's complicated, yet refreshing, flavourful yet eminently drinkable. Recommended for beer lovers of all ages and expertise."
""
"O- Incredible beer! Definitely my favourite of the style I have tried thus far (and this is probably my second favourite style next to, you guessed it, hefeweizen). Prior to drinking this beer, Blanche de Chambly was my favourite in this style, but this completely blew it out of the water. At its price, its more of a luxury beer rather than an everyday drink, but as a change of pace treat, you can't do much better. An amazing beer that is complex, but at the same time incredibly drinkable. Highly recommended!"

"Final Grade: 4.55, an outstanding A grade. It took me a few sips to get the hang of what they were going for here, but in the end it's not hard to see why St. Bernardus Witbier is widely considered to be the best commonly-seen example of the style. This beer doesn't seek to overwhelm your senses with a variety of exotic adjuncts or spicy features - it's beautifully balanced, plain delicious and simply a pleasure to drink. A must-try, unless you just aren't a fan of the style to begin with."

"I think it's rated as the highest witbier and I can see why. Definitely one of the best."
""

"Delicious take on the style. I love the bready malt presence, and the fact that it's not bubblegum or banana laden until the finish."

"Nothing special; I would have guessed a Belgium IPA, not a wit."

"O - This is the best witbier I've had (I've had Hoegaarden, Alagash, Blance De Chamby, Hitachino.. etc), and this style is really one of the best, in my opinion. I think this beer is a bit underrated and deserves more attention on BA."
"Mouthfeel is the best thing here. Great body and big carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium-light body, stingy medium carbonation, slightly watery mouthfeel. Very drinkable and refreshing, a really nice brew for hot summer days. Would have again."

"Overall: A great Belgian Witbier. Very good mix of yeast, coriander, and fruit flavors. One of the best for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a crisp enjoyable beer and I dont taste the 5.5% anywhere. A very nice beer that I am glad I had a chance to try. Worthy if you like Wit beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O: quite fine overall... bold spicing... balanced enough, though it could use a touch more body and malt flavor... maybe a bit too sharp and dry"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Pricey but an above average wit for sure. It has a perfect balance of flavours and a great mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A delightful witbier, but a little pricey to drink regularly, It's a pity, since beers like this are made to be sessioned in the summertime. Very glad I tried it and will likely revisit when the mercury rises, cost notwithstanding."
""
""
""
""
" Taste: Dry Pepper. Can taste faint citrus that changes into a heavy yeast aftertaste. Most Witbeirs have a sweeter citrus taste, this does not. Rather than the pulp of citrus fruits this tastes like the peel. Not a bad thing, but different from most witbeirs I have had. Light carbination with a very dry finish."
""
""
"O: Definitely recommended. One of my favorites from the brewery, typical of the style, but delicious."
"Cloudy, sunny peach color capped by a slender creamy white head. Aromas of cracked wheat, fresh oranges, creamy vanilla sweetness, light on the spice, with some smooth, well-integrated coriander. Citrusy, lightly spiced flavor with a notable wheat-y twang, a touch of clove, and some yeast. Dry, textured mouthfeel, with a slight lingering tanginess that makes for a refreshing, easy-drinking wit. A well-crafted wit from St. Bernardus, which comes as no surprise."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice tasting beer, that smooth and very fruity with a good, refreshing finish. It went down very well and was exactly what I've come to expect from a good example of the style. Simple with a good balance but pulled off well."

"Poured from 330 ml bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. This brew is allegedly quite close to Pierre Celis' original Hoegaarden recipe and is widely regarded as a decent stab at what genuine witbier used to taste like before the style became industrialized and relatively insipid. This sort of snobbery aside, I do see what the critics mean. St. Bernardus wit is a milky banana yellow hue, super cloudy and infused with particulate material from yeast. Aroma is correspondingly yeasty, sweet, citrusy, and spicy with a touch of Belgian funk and a decent burst of clove phenolics. Few North American wits smell like this. Palate features Indian round coriander seed, lemony and slightly tannic but not overpowering, orange rind, sweet grainy malt that combines with the citrus to evoke lemon meringue pie, and a surprisingly rich earthy spice that prevents things from being too sweet. Dry and woody in fact, with sour apple notes and a touch of butterscotch in the finish. Nicely carbonated (which is to say highly so). Should this be deemed the witbier Platonic ideal? Quite possibly, although dare I say that I prefer the more aggressive Unibroue yeast in Blanche de Chambly? Its almost a dead heat between these two. In the St. Bernardus Trappist influenced take reviewed here, everything is truly in its right place and the overall effect is earthy, spicy, dry, and as well-calibrated as a Swiss watch. Precise and technically proficient but still a work of art in the Belgian beer sense."

"What to say hereâ€¦just try this. Looked at this one for years and never grabbed one. Wow, do I feel like a dummy."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: At once highly refined and well crafted but also free from pretension in its simplicity, this is a witbier done right, and a great go to for a light beer when you don't necessarily need the extreme boldness of other styles."
""
""
""
"Perfect executed wit, very smooth and packed with assertive flavors."
"O - really good. Brings elements of a Belgian abbey ale to the witbier game. Cheers!"
"Overall, this is a fantastic example of the style. The spices are very much present, but they don't overwhelm the simpler grain characteristics, giving it nice drinkability. I also personally like the slightly tart element to the beer, because it makes it nice and refreshing. Would definitely buy again in a 4-pack now that I've had it."
"O = One of the best beers I've ever had, but too expensive to enjoy often."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-nice belgian wit, good flavor and could drink this a lot, even better in summer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I haven't had many Witbiers, but I wouldn't think you could go too far wrong with this one. Good value too (for good Belgian beers) when you can find it here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Over all I gave it a little higher because it is well constructed, the flavors move along nicely and I know there are lots of fans that love these flavors. If someone offered me one I would be delighted and enjoy it but I would not spend my hard earned cash for what it sells for again when I could buy something else I enjoy more. Good flavorful experience but not exactly my flavors or favorite style. (For reference my favorite styles are big sweet, Belgian Strong Dark Ales, Bruins and Dubbels)"
""
""
""
"Overall: Very well balanced, a great beer all around. It's a very filling and satisfying. so not something you want to have two or three of. It's a beer to sit down with for a while, enjoy the nuances in it and have a good time."

"Smooth beer, very easy drinking. Good carbonation. Good beer."
""
""
""
"I don't have a lot of experience with this style, but it this beer is any indication, will be seeking it out more. It goes down easy, yet is nice and complex. Would be a nice beer on a hot day, but a good one to savor, as there is a lot going on here. I could easily drink more of this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: one of the better witbiers I have had to date - well-balanced with citrus, Belgian yeast, earth characters and wheat. Not sure it is worth over AU$140 a case (2013), but one every now and then would be fine."
""
""
"Very refreshing, drinkable, and well-balanced. Citrus hops cut with a malty sweetness. I could have a few of these without getting filled up. Nothing outstanding, but a solid summer session brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is far more sweet than I might have expected with roasted pale malts, Belgian sugars, citrus, and a finish that is low in bitterness. The sweetness is the leader. Witbiers are about midway on my list of favorite styles but I could drink this one regularly."
"Pours a hazy straw golden with a pure white fluffy one and half finger head. Frantastic retention, plenty of lacing. Light citrus notes, coriander, and just an edge of earthiness on the nose. Smooth and velvety on the palate with just a touch of creaminess. Opens with gentle fruit notes, with some citrus zest joined by clove, and some earthiness. Yeast makes it presences well-known middle palate with most some grain and ample malt. Finishes with some light tart notes. One of the better witbiers available and wonderful beer overall."
""
"This is the gold standard of witbiers. The taste is smooth and intense, balanced and pure perfection. Is it worth 3X the price of Blue Moon? Yes. WillI keep a stash for regular consumption? No, but then I am a dark beer fanatic and only drink witbier for refreshment. A must try  to experience the potential of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: Worthy of being named ""Best Witbier in the World"". Easily the best example of the style I have encountered. The complexity from the yeast alone was great, but the rest of the flavors were also great. Exactly what a Belgian White should be. Seek this out if you enjoy Wheats, Sours, or Belgian Ales. Absolutely phenomenal wit."

"O: A nice Witbier, but I'm honestly not sure I could tell this from the BMC versions. It is a bit spicier and drier I believe, but it's similar for sure. Maybe my palate just isn't quite there for Witbier. Either way, I'd take an Allagash White over this any day."
""
""
""
""
""
"Aftertaste: There isn't a big aftertaste here. The spices stick around, but leave me with a subtle drying finish requiring me to take another sip. I will say, about this style, if you are new to craft beer, this isa good/safe way to start. Nearly every brewing company makes a wheat/white beer. So if you are new to craft beer, start here. Funny storyâ€¦ last night in the beer class, a guy likes the Maui Bikini Blonde Ale more than anything we tried. He would LOVE this beer! Oh well, glad I got to try this. I wouldn't buy this again, but it was fun learning about the Pierre Celis connection to this brewery/beer. Cheers, people!"
""
"O- Not much bad to say about this one. Strait forward in a good way. very sessionable. Bravo"
""
"O- My first offering from St Bernardus and I am very pleased with my choice. Great summer beer or even for year round. Extremely refreshing and crisp. Smooth."
"Such an easy and tasty beer to drink. A very excellent witbier in all respects. Very nicely balanced with some interesting things going on. Great complexity and yet so easy and tasty to drink. I would maybe prefer a bit less sweetness and more hops, the wheat here adds a delicious smooth creamy character. Great beer though."
""
""
""
"O: A solid wit, but unexceptional for the style. Recommended, but not particularly compelling."
"O-This wit is a great example of the style. As you would expect from a true Belgian, things are balanced while erring slightly on the sweet side. There is no gimmickry or funny business, and none is necessary here to create solid flavors. I would've liked to compare this to the Toyko Wit in a heads-up comparison, because my recollection is that that beer is also quite nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Brightly sweet with notes of orange and citrus... It's quite fruity. The coriander is there as well but is restrained when compared to what the aroma was. Also clear it's a wheat beer towards the finish. The sweet seems to carry the day here though with coriander in the back."
""
""
"Presentation: Packaged in an eleven point two ounce brown glass longneck bottle sealed with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
"Cheers!"
""
"Witbier that does not exaggerate on the spices. That is good. what I miss is the typical sweetness for balance. Not my favorite witbier."
""
""
""
""
"O- I will grant you this my not be a fair review. I dislike wheat beers -- stouts and IPA's are my thing"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is medium to medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium intensity that foams this up nicely across the palate, without being overly fizzy or harsh. Closes out semi-dry, with little to no residual stickiness across the palate."
""
"Consistent,y one of my all time favorite beers. The look of it is picture perfect: hazy yellow with a lingering, sensual head. The smell is sort of spicy, with coriander coming through; but also a mix of orange/banana I smell. The taste is top notch. The spices are dominant, but banana, orange, and some grassy notes come through to really balance out this beer. Paired with chicken and dumplings, this is a near perfect meal!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is what every witbier should strive to be like. To me, this is the absolute defining beer of the style and by far the best wit I have ever had. I only wish I could get this close to where I live because I would go through cases during the summer."
"Overall: An excellent Witbier, just wish it was cheaper and easier to find. It is great."
"Poured from 11.2 oz bottle into tulip. Pours a golden hazy straw with a big white foamy head. Nice floral clove and yeasty aroma. Taste is full of clove and yeast with a bit of citrus mainly orange. Just an all around perfect wit...a bit peppery but delicious."

"O- this is on of those wits that sets the standards for all others. Bright in aroma and flavor where others wits are often muted. Refreshing beer."
""
""
"O: I bought the St. Bernardus mix pack just for this beer, and it did not disappoint. This is a real witbier. They don't make 'em like this anymore. It's way too drinkable, and even I was surprised by how quickly I drained my glass. It really hit the spot, even in the dead of winter. They really need to get this beer over here in volume, especially toward the summer months."
"i gave this very high marks due to the sublteness, yet still present, of the spices...."
""
""
""
""
"M: medium bodied, creamy, good carbonation, dry finish"
""
""
""
"Pours a murky butter yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks and dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, spices, yeast, and a perfume-like citrus aroma. Taste is much the same with a mild spice finish that lingers after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a great smell that is tasty and easy to drink."

"O: Excellent Wit - one of the best."
""
""
""
"Overall: A good and refreshing beer. While enjoyable, I wouldn't call it the top witbier in the world."
""
""
"pour is hazy pale yellow with bubbly white head. The nose is zesty and spicy, peppery and lemony zest, well balanced. The taste is the same, well integrated and balanced spice an zesty lemon juice. Body is airy, clean and crisp with solid carbonation."
""
"Pours a cloudy light gold, with a smallish white head, which lasts reasonably well but does not leave much lacing. The aroma is a delicately fragrant blend of sweet coriander, lemon zest and orange blossom, with some faint medicinal notes. Subtle lemon peel up front leads into some sweet and spicy coriander. A typically crisp witbier feel is balanced nicely against honeyed orange blossom notes in the mid-palate. The finish is redolent with sweet spice and lingers nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
"I was a bit disappointed in this one. Very cloudy golden color, with huge head that took a while to dissipate. Aroma seems to be lacking a bit, and smells almost stale with hay and grass, some faint yeast. Good carbonation, with decent mouthfeel. Flavor follows rather dry, yeasty, and very little sweetness or spice on this one. I was expecting something mind blowing and felt that this was rather run of the mill. Maybe it's right on style, but I prefer a little additional sweetness in this style. Decent brew."
""
""
""
""
"Overall pretty good representation of the style. Could have more varied/complex spices and acidity to balance out the sweetness but does carry forth the proper characteristics of the style represented."
""
""
""
"maybe im missing something here BA, but this just doesnt blow my mind. it looks the part of a world class beer, huge foaming white head resting forever on top of a just slightly hazy very pale summery yellow body with lots of little bubbles rising eagerly to the surface. it also leaves beautiful patchy thick white lacing on the sides of my tulip as i drink this. its really pretty. the nose though does not match the looks, it smells faintly like lemon peel, but all i can really ascertain from the smell is a pretty standard belgian yeast, light and a little fruity. its a little stinky, like maybe mine isnt the freshest bottle, but still, it just doesnt smell all that great. the flavor is nice, its very very light. a nice wheat malt profile with some grassy notes plays against just a touch of bitter lemon and the doughy yeast. its in fine balance, but its not a very bold flavor, well made yes, but almost boring. the feel is fine, light in body, made heavier by the suds on top and the yeast sediment, and the carbonation is quite active and fizzy. overall a nice beer, but im not sure id score it quite as high as the masses have here."
"a contemplative beer. More for a relaxing evening drink or a warm day."

"Descent wit. Holds up against many other examples of the style."

"O â€“ This is a nice witbier that is different than most witbiers that Iâ€™ve had. The usual banana, clove, and bubblegum flavors are dialed down a bit and the yogurt-like tanginess is dialed up. I shouldâ€™ve known better â€“ Belgian beers never fit the mold. The bottom line is that this is a really tasty, drinkable, and refreshing beer that is well-suited for the hot summer months."

"Can't say I've had a better Belgian witbier. This is really good."

"O: A pretty witbier, overall, that's also very unique. It's almost more like a saison or some Belgian pale ales than a witbier. Still, it's enjoyable."

"*Overall, this was a A beer! I like that it is light enough on the ABV and thin enough on the mouthfeel to be an easy beer to drink. My only complaint is that for the style, the St. Bernardus was on the darker side of the witbiers. I think I remember liking Hoegaarden better since it is lighter and has a refreshing lemon character. The St. Bernardus Wit is a great beer with outstanding flavors that I would certainly warrant picking up if I ever saw it at the beer store again!"
""
"O - Definitely an above average witbier. Great blend of citrus and spicy flavors. I expected a bit more richness and depth, but it's still a highly drinkable and enjoyable beer."

"Review from 3/2011 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a slightly cloudy yellow orange amber. Moderate white head, and lacing, lasted nicely. Wheat and light belgian spice aroma. Citrus and light wheat flavors up front with a bit of sour and astringent bitterness quickly followed by the spices and light fruit. I liked the start and finish, but the middle was a bit sharp and dry for me. Interesting for a change, but I'll more likely return to the double and triple."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer poured a cloudy, but bright orange with a thin head of clean white foam. Orange and coriander were apparent up front. Notes of pine came through the nose as well. The taste was quite clean with the expected citrus zest and wheat coming through. This beer is quite clean in the mouth with lots of flavor up front, but is also light and sharp with limited residual sweetness once you swollow. Overall, this is a very nice light wheat beer with great flavor that very drinkable."
""
""
"Overall, truly an exemplar of the style. Probably the best classic witbier I have had. However, I slightly prefer Charlevoix's Dominus Vobiscum Blanche, as I find the addition of chamomile to that beer to really introduce an unusual element that works wonders. However, this is a fantastic beer and very enjoyable."
""
""
"Definitely going to be my beer of choice for warm weather whenever I can get my hands on it."

"O- Not world-class IMO but certainly excellent."

"O: Probably the best beer I have had in this style and extremely refreshing. This beer would be awesome on a warm summer evening and I could definitely enjoy many of them."

"11.2 ounce bottle into signature chalice, best by 7/11/2012. Pours extremely hazy golden straw color with a nice 1 finger fairly dense white head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap. Some fairly nice lacing clinging on the glass. Aromas of pepper, lemon zest, orange, coriander, grass, bread, wheat, and yeast spices. Nice and well balanced aromas with decent strength. Taste of big pepper, coriander, lemon, orange, bread, lightly tart grain, and yeast spices. No bitterness; with lingering notes of citrus, bread, tart grain, and spices on the finish for a bit. Very nicely balanced flavors, without cloying sweetness. Fairly dry finish. Medium body and carbonation; with a fairly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel. Pretty much no alcohol presence as expected at 5.5%. Overall this is a super smooth, balanced, and very enjoyable witbier; as I would have hoped. Unfortunately it is a bit difficult to find unlike the rest of the lineup."

"Overall this is a great beer. High marks. Goes down well with some live Santana or Miles Davis electric period type from an outdoor fest."
""
""
"Overall, it's a really good beer. There were lots of things I liked, but a few things that I didn't. It's something I'd happily drink again in the future, but there are other beers I'd like to try first."

""
""
""
"Overall, except for the big-bottle format this is a really good sessionable Belgian beer."
""
""
"D - After initially reviewing what I though was a bad bottle of this beer, I can now see that's just the way this beer is. I enjoyed it more now than then, but this just doesn't quite do it for me. Although this is certainly a departure from what I know as a witbier, it's still a great beer, and one I know I'll be revisiting down the road. But overall this one just didn't deliver like I had hoped. A good beer, but I'll be reaching for a Hoegaarden before this in the future. That is until I try more witbiers."

"Overall I'm disappointed - the soapy taste is just too strong for me to get past."
"O - I feel like this is an excellent wit if I had only had a fresh one. It was just too malty."
"This is an easy drinking witbier. It's not very complex, but it's well balanced."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Witbier."
"O: A light and easy drinker, wouldn't ever turn this down on a hot summer day!"
"Overall: I would give this a great summer spring time beer rating. It's lightness and coloration remind me of such. Fantastic beer."
"O - A good white, but nothing special."
"O: Delicious, and by far the best witbier I've ever had!"
"M: Complex but excellent and balanced combination not light but with a good ending, the ending is not to dry but it is a little bitter not a hops bitterness but more a peel citrus bitterness."
"T delicious wheat flavour all the aroma is replicated on the taste. refreshing with medium body. some crisping on tongue"
"Dr: Easy to drink, but of poor quality. ABV is average. Nothing special here."
"O - St. Bernardus can do no wrong IMO and this is yet another proof of that. Great wit beer that I will definitely be drinking again and will seek out extensively next summer."
"overall a good beer. i was expecting a little bit more from one of my favorite breweries but still a must try. very light crisp and refreshing beer."
"Not everyone goes through this cycle, but I did. And here I am sitting down drinking a St. Bernardus Wit and feeling like I am in heaven. What a clean, tasty, refreshing, subtle, finely crafted beer this is. The flavors have been described many times over, so I do not feel the need to do it myself. Just know that I have never had anything in the style that is better, and I can count on two hands the number of beers that compete with in in terms of drinkability. Amazing beer, a different beast than its cousin Abt 12 but dare I say it an equally good beer."
"Exceptionally good witbier, and indeed one of the pinnacles of the style. Refreshing, fragrant, crisp and drinkable. You can't ask for anything more."
"T: Pear, banana and a big dose of cloves. The mouthfeel was a little thin for me, but the flavors were really great."
"Drinkability: Crisp, clean, very refreshing. I can and do drink this beer often."
"overall a very nice beer, too bad its 12.99 @ 4 pack. seemed to fit the style, fairly well. Almost some German hefe things in it."
"O- There's a reason this is the #1 Witbier... It's full of flavor, body, and super refreshing. Highly recommended for the style, or during the summer months."
"The beer is hazy yellow with a thick, dense white cap. Plenty of lacing is left on the snifter. The aroma brings wheat, coriander, orange peel, yeast, lemons. Delicious flavor. Slightly tart lemons, with hints of Belgian yeast and a mild spice character. Everything is integrated beautifully. Really easy to drink, full of flavor. The body is light to medium, with moderate carbonation, and smooth on the palate. I definitely recommend this beer."
"If I wasn't such a beer nerd wanting to try everything in sight, I would have easily ordered another."
"O: This is a very nice Wit. Try it, you'll like it!"
"Overall: nice white, more spicy than others in the style"
"This is the top-reviewed beer of this style out of any that have more than just a handful of reviews and I feel it's deserved. Buy it, drink it, love it. If Wits are your thing this is the beer to buy."
"O: This is a really high quality witbier with great craftsmanship all around and a solid blend of smell, flavor and feel. I admit though I was hoping for something more complex and layered when I had this. It's hard to poke holes in this beer in the end though, very little wrong and a lot right going for it. Don't see how you could like witbiers and not seek this one out for a try."
"This is undoubtedly the smoothest and best witbier I've ever had. Poured into a chalice, a cloudy, pale, bronzed yellow-orange with a beautiful head of delicate white bubbles that retained pretty much throughout the session and left some nice lacing. Biscuity aroma, Belgian yeast, sugar and spice, and citrus zest. Very bready and earthy taste, and very complex and full-flavored for a witbier. Flavors of yeast, sugar, lemon, pear, banana, corriander, pepper, all wrapped in an incredibly smooth package that you just don't get from a typical wit. Probably the only wit that I've had that I'd call medium-bodied, with full flavor and rich texture, and definitely easily drinkable, but to be savored."
"O: Quite tasty and incredibly easy drinking, could drink this beer all night without a problem. Nice representation of style."
"Light and drinkable, but tons of flavor. Class act. Credit to wits."
"Overall though this really reminds me more of a Hefeweizen but it's almost like a cross hybrid, interesting. Easy drinking no problem."
"The beer pours a hazy straw color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the wheat with some coriander and lemon notes mixed in. The aroma is a little muddy smelling overall, with nothing really standing out. The flavor is better than the aroma. I get a lot of wheat with some orange peel, coriander and pepper notes. Light, watery mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"A very good example of the style, and a very good start to my night! I'd recommend it and if you can get it for under 10 dollars do it"
"Another winner from St. Bernardus and a great example of the style. Even if you are not a Wit fan, this is a must try."
"D - A solid and respectable witbier, however the St. Bernardus label leaves me expecting a bit moreâ€¦ There is nothing outstanding nor detractingâ€¦ I can think of several other, less expensive Witbiers that I would opt for over this oneâ€¦"
"Not a huge fan of the style but growing to like it and this is probably the best wit I've had. Lively carbonation that turns to light foam in the mouth, very refreshing. Exactly like the nose indicates. So juicy and succulent and friendly with food. Balance is uncanny, starts with coriander, light honey, and then moves to orange, lemon grass, belgian spices, light earthy tones, some grassy herbaceous qualities, into a soft, creamy, then bubbly long finish. A wit I plan to drink much more of."
"Overall an immense drink, I might go right now and order a whole crate of the stuff!"
"Drinkability -- I'm not sure if this bottle was long in the tooth or what, but this did not live up to the reviews I read beforehand nor the pedigree of St. Bernardus."
"Light mouthfeel that finishes dry. An excellent wit."
"O) Really good beer. Full flavored but light bodied. Quite refreshing on a warm spring day."
"D -- Definitely worth a pickup. Solid representation of the style, and approachable for most."
"This beer pours smoothly with a decent amount of head. The beer is a murky yellow look that looks like a traditional wheat beer. The taste is a very fruity light wheat flavor. It has flavors of pineapple, oranges, sweetness, and lemons. The after taste lingers a little bit with hints of lemon. A good beer to have on a hot summer day. Cheers."
"Nose of exotic fruit which can be identified as pineapple or mango and some spices. Moreover, it is fairly well balanced with the presence of wheat that brings a touch of sweetness. Easy drinking, slightly spicy, one perceives in a final taste lemon to clean Witbier. A little bitter, it's true but it is negligible, which is a little deception."
"The flavor is very soft with tartness resembling mild lactic sourness, unmalted wheat, coriander, tinge of orangeish fruitiness and refreshingly tart, dry finish.Hoppiness is nearly non-existant. (330 ml, freshness date 29. September 2011, into the St. Bernardus goblet)."
"St. Bernardus really puts out some great beers. This one is probably one of the better Wit's on the market. This beer pours out as an opaque yellow color with a big white foamy head. The aroma is very lively, some big time citrus coming through on the nose. There is also a good amount of yeast there too. The taste of this beer is semi-sweet, citrusy upfront and fades to a bread like softness in the after taste. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth but it also has a few bubbles in there that like to dance on your taste buds."
"O: This is tasty, mellow, and very easy to drink. You can't go wrong with anything from St. Bernardus."
"Overall: Just an excellent wit. Spiciness and bitter citrus is not overdone, and the complex yeast flavors are excellent. I love this brewery."
"Cloudy yellow/orange with a white head. Bubbly and well carbonated, this is a prototypical whitbier. Some sweet malt up front, and tart citrus on the back of the palate. This beer has a crisp thirst quenching body. I didn't get a lot of nose, but there are elements of spice and Belgian yeast."
"Nice witbier appearance a bit cloudy with a nice orange hue. Smell is pleasant and aromatic. You can smell the fruity hops and coriander. Taste is clean with hints of orange and lemon. On the palette its sparkling but not to much. I kind of like my wits a bit more subtle. Refreshing to drink; this will be a very nice beer to have in the summer on those really hot days. A beer that will be kept on hand regularly."
"D: Great drinkability. This is an excellent example of what a white ale should be."
"Overall - enjoyable."
"A very nice wit. Basically, this sets the bar for the style. A bit more artisanal than Hoegardeen with more complex flavors and subtleties. Really enjoyed this one. Highly recommended."
"D - Definitely a tasty Wit beer, and a worthy offering to any fan of Wit's. The flavours were unique and memorable, and the mouthfeel would make this one a perfect afternoon patio beer."
"D: Nice beer, but I wasn't completely wowed like many other reviewers."
"Comments- I am a big fan of witbiers and St. Bernardus has easily become my favorite. As a reference point, Allagash white ale used to be my wit of choice but I consider that to be a distant second now. This beer is pretty pricey, but I like it so much I find myself continuing to buy it despite the price premium."
"D - One of the few wit to stand up to Hoegaarten"
"Drinkability is high. The weather is warm here today and tomorrow; a nice little respite from old man Winter. Perfect beer for a day like this. Would be excellent on a hot summer day. Gotta love Wits and Hefes!"
"Pours a hazy golden with a creamy white head. Smells of old bakers yeast. Taste is light citrus up front, followed by a light grainy bread middle, a hint of bubblegum, and a yeasty phenolic finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, average carbonation. Drinkability is meh, by far the least impressive St. Bernardus beer i've had. For the price this is totally not worth it IMO."
"The mouthfeel is soft with a lower amount of carbonation then I'd like. The finish is crisp, tart and slightly dry. Not bad but also not one of my favorites. I could drink this all night but frankly after one I'm bored. Put that with the price tag of $4 a bottle and I am totally out. Worth a try if you just got paid and have a finsky burning a whole in your pocket, other then that find a better wit."
"Drinkability - It was very drinkable. I liked this one a lot and St. Bernardus has never let me down. It is almost sessionable and would be willing to try to do just that."
"Drinkability- About average for a wheat beer."
"D- Easy sipping beer, but tartness is too much for me."
"Nice high carbonation."
"It has a very sharp taste. Citrus dominates again, but the beer is not sour by any means. Very refreshing."
"D: Light and easy to drink. A pleasure to the palate...Another great Wit...-Cheers"
"Pours an extremely murky milky gold/straw color...almost like unfiltered apple juice. There is a small white head that goes away quickly.Scent is yeasty, bready, spicy, and fruity. I get wheat and green apples with coriander and light lemon. Taste is initially lemony with a bit of tartness and green apple. Then I get delicious wheat and bread notes with Belgian yeast, making this one tasty wit! It end with sweet coriander, bananas, and a small amount of hoppiness. Mouthfeel is very dry and crisp. Full of flavor and body. Drinkability is high. This could be one of the best wits I've ever had."
"D - Very drinkable. Perfect for a hot summer day while mowing the lawn or having a BBQ."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: It is a bit more sour and kind of acidic in the aftertaste. The body is very light but the carbonation seems kind of heavy."
"St Bernardus can do no wrong."
"its really refreashing would def have again however when the beer warms the colve over takes a lot of flavor"
"Drinkability: light, refreshing, creamy and quaffable. I dig this stuff a lot."
"If this looks like a ""tick"" review, it's only because this beer is so easy to describe. It's exactly what it's supposed to be with no sidetrips."
"Really good. Was expecting a little more asertiveness one way or another on the aroma. Didn't really get much beyond the wheatyness and breadyness. Do agree there is some acidity or citrusy component mixed in there but kinda hard to nail down. Kinda like that. Refreshing as all hell on the pallet. Bright yet soft; clean yet full of flavor. A smidge tart, but very drinkable. Really like this beer and seems to open and grow as it warms in the glass."
"Definitely good mouth feel with this beer. Medium, smooth, great carbonation. Combined with the low alcohol content, this is a very drinkable beer for me; although the sweetness hinders it a bit."
"This beer poured nicely with a light frothy head and an excellent smell. Lightly spicy with hints of cloves and lemon and the sweetness of the wheat is pleasantly subdued making the beer easy to drink without over powering the palate. A great beer on a warm, late summer afternoon."
"Pours a hazy light yellow with a nice white head. Decent amount of lacing. Smell is light wheat with a bit of sweetness. Some clove character and a bit of spice. Taste is similar, although nothing stands out too much. Somewhat bland compared with the nose. Much of the taste component is dominated by the mouthfeel, which is quite nice and refreshing. A very easy-drinking beverage."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. A terrific representation of the style."
"Great smooth body, with light, but persistent carbonation. This is incredibly drinkable, and is easily the best witbier I've ever had. Flavor has a good bit of citrus, spice and particularly lemon. Good stuff, much like the nose."
"D - Not overpowering and very easy to drink."
"Overall, an exceptional wit and one of the best (maybe the best) wits out there. Most highly recommend. Home keg worthy! Available here in TX. Rotation - heavy player in the wit/hefe/... rotation. [H;Y]"
"11.2oz.bottle served in a tulip. Best before end 20 04 12 indicated on the back label. Pours a hazy, dull orange with a loose, half inch, cream-colored head. Head quickly disperses into a semi-solid skim with circular dollops dotting the surface. No lacing per se, just clumps of foam that return to the liquid after each tilt of the glass. Great nose - cloves, lemongrass, coriander and mandarin orange. Taste consistent with nose; however character in the nose is nicely muddled and muted so as to be crisp and refreshing as opposed to sweet and cloying. Mouthfeel is light-bodied, but feels more substantial due to the lively effervescence that leaves a semi-dry and clean aspect at the finish. This has to be one of my top five Witbiers to date; an excellent offering that is great for summer consumption."
"Quite expensive for a witbier, this was a disappointment, St. Bernardus is usually quality stuff."
"A complex, cheekily understated, and at the same time, solid example of the style. The old world leanings toward nuance over intensity practically leap out of the glass, but really don't, y'know? Easy to drink, and for the style, strangely compelling, in the sense of making me actually consider acquiring/opening/borrowing another."
"D - Very light, crisp and refreshing, I could have a few of these. This would pair remarkably well with some fish or chicken."
"D - I could easily drink several of these. It is fairly light and easy to drink. The flavor also is not to far on the sweet side to keep me from another glass."
"I'll give drinkability a very good rating - ABV is a little high for a session beer, but it's spot-on perfect for a beer to have with your barbequed chicken or grilled salmon. St. Bernardus definitely knows how to make witbier."
"Great offering from St. Bernardus, almost on par with their quad."
"Flute glass pour and I am met with a cloudy straw colored ale with a white head, which dissipates quickly. Aroma consists of pears, green apples and malt. Crisp and clean taste with some major pear action going on and a refreshing fruity aftertaste. Light mouthfeel with some bubbly carbonation distracting somewhat. Very easy drink as a 750 ml was consumed with ease. The more I drank the more I liked it. Overall this was another nice beer from a great Brewery and drunk on a hot day contributed to the positive nuances of this beer."
"Beer is thin and slightly dry. Spiciness is minimal overall a good beer. Its mildly sweet and has a wheaty graininess at the back end. Creamy mouthfeel. Very nice overall. Highly drinkable, I love Watou a lot."
"*=ideas form fellow taster"
"D - overall, a great wit. this is a staple of the style. hard to get your hands on, but well worth seeking out."
"Although the bottle is 10 months old, I can tell this is a wonderful witbier. It's a smooth, easy drinking beer with plenty of flavor and refreshment. At 5.5% it's a very wonderful session beer for the summer."
"D - My friend's comment is accurate. ""It's a bad chord on a guitar that sounds good at the end"" with each sip of this beer you wonder if you made the right choice or a mistake but after you stop and let the notes sink in it it grows on you like a song you like the 3rd time you listen to it."
"D- Could drink this all week if I could afford it."
"Like other St. Bernardus beers there seems to be a lot of yeast and sediment after pouring into a glass. Appearance was a hazy oat color. Produced about one finger of head. Made me burp a lot which I always take as a good sign. Smelled of malt and apple cider. Fruit, Malt and wheat definitely come through along with very subtle hops. Great light summer beer, easy to drink, low ABV, but still rich and full bodied."
"Served from bottle into Stone nonic. Poured a nice golden cloudy yellow with a one-finger white head that subsides to a thin layer upon sitting. There was minimal lacing evident throughout. The aroma was comprised of bananas and malt notes. The flavor present were bananas, malt, slight wheat, and apples upon swallowing. Very nice. It was light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this is a really nice brew. I was thoroughly surprised at some of the flavors I encountered while drinking this one. A definite must try."
"D: This is a perfect summer beer that's thirst quenching and also packs in a lot of interesting flavors."
"Best Wit I've ever had, hands down, Pierre Celis out did himself with this one. Again, the only complaint is that it's pricey."
"D-very refreshing, crisp, and smooth; it would be my go to beer throughout the summer, but it's kind of expensive; for me it was the best witbier i have tried, some other examples of this style leave a very fake acidic/citrus flavor in my mouth that kind of gets to me after awhile"
"Swirl poured into a wit glass. Two finger fluffy white head that soon diminishes to a thin layer. Collour is a cloudy brownish apricot. Strong fluffy lacing. Smells a mild bread with apple spice. Tastes include apple, orange, coriander. Well balanced - lots going on. Nice and light. Refreshing. Fine carbonation helps a nice finish. No problem drinking a few of these."
"Good aroma but the flavour lets it down. The tea flavour is just not quite right in the beer."
"Mouthfeel - Carbonated and dry. Perhaps a bit too dry for my preference in this style."
"Drinkability is great. It's well balanced which keeps any one element from overwhelming the palate."
"D: An average to slightly above average witbier. Better than Blue Moon, but doesn't stand up to some of the others (Allagash White is my litmus). I may try it again if I can get it fresh, but otherwise I will pass."
"All in all, it's a good one in this style, but not great. I'd pick several others, but occasionally ... ok."
"Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is medium-full with a creamy amount of carbonation."
"Bottle, home. My favorite witbier so far. This beer pours a hazy beige-yellow with a big frothy head. The aroma has a lot of clean grain and earthy yeast. Good notes of wheat spice, coriander and citrus peel. The flavor is lemony, yeasty and dry. It's a very easy beer to drink."
"This brew pours a cloudy pale yellow hue with decent carbonation that leaves a pillowy two finger creamy head,the smell is very nice with aromas of pears,orange peel,white grapes and a feint touch of corriander,it has a nice creamy mouthfeel which is neither thin nor thick with tastes of pears,white grapes,orange peel and also some lemon and corriander,overall a really good example of a Witbier and would definately buy again and would love to try it with some seafood on a hot summers day."
"This is an excellent drinking beer, one that I could drink year round but especially in the summertime."
"Overall this is an amazing beverage, this is a great way to wake up the senses. You can enjoy this beverage and appreciate the history, time and dedication involved. Great work indeed."
"Overall - A great summer beer to complement St Bernardus's predominantly cold weather beers."
"Pours a luminous and hazy golden hue with white head consisting of larger than average bubbles. Nose has a tempting citrus, with some dessert-like captiviness such as a lemony glaze on a donut. On the palate there's an amazing sweet 'n sour contrast with soft wheat breadiness, more lemony flavors, and good carbonation through to the finish. Inspiring flavors on each sip, yet also drinkable. Nice beer."
"An exceedingly easy-drinking light bodied wit."
"Thick mouthfeel, creamy. Lemon tartness, bitter orange zest, and some corriander. Compared to similar beers it seems to be lacking in spice. Finished with a funky, chalky, dry yeast flavor. Undesirable aftertaste. There are better witbiers out there that cost significantly less. I won't be buying this one again."
"Without a doubt, this is the finest wheat beer I've ever had."
"Pours a hazy golden straw with a healthy but quickly-fading white head that leaves very little lacing behind. The smell is a subtle melange of wheat, coriander, lemongrass, and a bit of bread. The taste follows nicely, including the subtlety: a tasty collaberation of coriander, wheat, clove, lemon zest, and even a hint of spice in the back. The body is medium at best, has a good amount of effervescent carbonation, and does not malinger, all the makings of a highly drinkable wit."
"D: A great Belgian Beer; not that I haven't tried better witbiers before, but this one is a solid choice."
"D: Very drinkable, well balanced and refreshing! Light abv makes it a perfect summertime refresher."
"Citrus notes contribute to the taste as well, carrying through the palate. The richness of the wheat is evident throughout as well, giving the beer a full and rich feel without a dense sweetness. Carbonation settles from the initial blast to support the texture well, and opening up the nose further. Concludes with a light citric sweetness that lingers nicely. Very nice."
"There's a welcome stinging carbonation balanced by a silky-smooth mouthfeel. It's pretty hearty for a witbier and quite drinkable."
"D- Goes down super smooth. Very hearty for a 5.5% ABV brew... and very drinkable."
"Drinkability: I found this to be a different witbier than what I have tasted. This one is very fruity, almost like a tropical drink. I do want it again and it was enjoyable, however for the high price, I think there are better alternatives."
"D. Very drinkable . Av very good Wit beer. I liked this quite a bit."
"Comments: I'm trying to find something negative about this beer and can't (other than the price!) This has to be the pinnacle of witbiers. If this one doesn't get a perfect score, then perfection is not possible, since it can't be possible to improve this brew."
"D- This is a really got witbier- one of the better examples of the style around. This one is full of flavor and a bit spicier than most of the other examples. Wonderful overall-the only thing that keeps this from being an A+ witbier in my book is the mouthfeel, which is good, but a bit over carbonated and the body could be smoother."
"A perfect thirst quencher, as drinkable as they come. If only it were July..."
"Spicier than other wits I have had, but a great beer from a great brewery."
"D: Very easy to drink."
"Drinkability: This is definitely a beer to drink again. It has a clean crisp flavor that is refreshing, smooth and enjoyable. This is a beer to drink again in the future whenever and where ever it is found."
"After paying $5.99 for my bottle of St. Bernardus Witbier at World Market in Montgomery, I was expecting something fantastic. What I got was an overpriced witbier that didn't taste any different than any other witbier out there. It tasted good with wheat accents but the sticker shock was more than I could stand. I think I'll stick with the Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat or the Sam Adams White Ale. This one's just another overpriced and overrated import."
"This beer is a little different than most white beers that i have had because its lacks sweetness. Instead it gives us a tart lemon and orange taste that leaves a tangy finish. It also has a smell that is similar to a fresh cut orange. The color is a cloudy gold and white with a white head. This beer is pretty pricey and i would probably spend my money on blanche de chambly, hoegaarden, white rascal, ect.. because they have more flavor and are cheaper. Although, it is good to try if you want a dryer white beer that is made from the brewer of hoegaarden. This beer is okay."
"This was drank on a cold windy day, the lounge was however warm and is very well appointed, beautiful paintings and ornaments. An ideal place to review beers from the brewery next door and highly recommended for a stay."
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a Unibroue tulip. Fluffy white head with interesting, soapy, sticky, sticky lacing. Aroma is of clove, banana and Belgian yeast. Taste follows suit and is smooth as a baby's bottom with absolutely no hint of alcohol. Brilliant, has to be one of the best wits in the world. Paired well with a gaggle of deviled eggs."
"Properly carbonated and good mouthfeel for its style. The carbonation helps to wake up the taste buds. Excellent drinkability, I had no trouble taking down the bottle myself. Paired nicely with some simple cheese and crackers."
"Pretty carbonated...let warm up a little. At fridge temp, it has little flavor. As it warms up, a little fruity...sour...citrus. Very light and drinkable."
"Bottle at Chaucer's. Pours cloudy hazy yellow with a good frothed bleach white cap. The aroma is full of yeast and lactic components, which surprising. Lots of funk, some fruity esters, very yeasty, a touch of clove. The flavour profile is very tart citrus, some hints of banana, spices, but lots of funky sour yeast. Finishes creamy, in fact almost too creamy, with lots of funky yeast in the finish."
"D = This is a very refreshing beer but perhaps just a bit too biting to really qualify as highly drinkable."
"O: A great session beer to share with those who love great beer."
"Pale yellow with fluffy white head forming a plateau. Aroma of bananas and citrus, with a slightly bitter edge. Tastes of bitter grapefruit and bread with hints of black pepper. A fairly standard wheat beer. Refreshing enough, but not the brewer's strength."
"What a great beer. If this was more affordable it could possibly replace Weiheinstephaner as my wheat beer of choice."
"Good full bodied beer with a soft but high carbonation. To me this is the benchmark mouthfeel for a belgian wit"
"Rather good witbier here. Not my style at all, got this from a friend but I'm impressed. Smells spicy, yeasty, clovey. This has an excellent mouthfeel. Might be the first time I've ever thought that from a beer. It's a creamy carbonation. Tastes nice and spicy. Light n' tasty. I love when a beer surprises you. Drinkability is high in this, I'd have lots more if I had anymore. Well done."
"D- This is a fairly neutral beer for a wit, but I enjoyed it. The flavors weren't overpowering like some beers can be for this style. Very refreshing!"
"Soft carbonation up front making it crisp and smooth with a nice balance of citrus and spice notes. Slightly bready/yeasty with hints of orange and lemon peel, corriander, ripe banana and peppery lemon zest. Very drinkable with a sweet dry finish."
"I love St. Bernardus, and it was obvious that their world-class witbier was going to be a winner for me. I was a bit taken back by how insanely drinkable it is, though. Great stuff, and worthy of its rep!"
"Light to medium body with medium carbonation. Overall, this was very refreshing and probably at the top of my list for wits. Great to drink anytime of year, but really hits the spot on a hot day."
"a world class beer here, I'm not happy about the price here in Calgary but what can I do"
"T: Bubbly upfront which transitions into a thick, smooth flavor of savory honey by the middle. It's a little tangy in the finish and overall sports a long, balanced flavor."
"Exceptionally balanced, would be an absolute killer on a hot day if it wasn't for the high price tag."
"D: Definitely one of the best Belgian Wits I've had, if not THE best. The perfect example of its style, and what all other wits should strive to be."
"I can't say I noticed much difference - if any - between the regular St. Bernardus Witbier and the Pierre Celis Signature Selection. For all I can tell they are the exact same beer (*note: they are), and in any event, I seem to enjoy them both every bit the same. If I was to toast the legendary Pierre Celis, the Godfather of Witbier, it would certainly be with a glass of this fine ale."
"Light bitter hop finish."
"Not my favorite style, but this is a good beer from a great brewery."
"Nice and refreshing. A classic wit."
"Probably the most enjoyable wit I've ever had, or at least can recall sampling, these four bottles went quickly, and I have a hankering for more. Like I said above, this is not a complex wit, but a well crafted, well put together wit all the same, very high quality, and very satisfying."
"Drinkability is very good, this is a very clean tasting wit, a great nose and taste to it and that finishes in a very pleasant manner."
"Best by date 9/11/09"
"#5 in St. Bernardus six pack sampler. Pours a hazy pale yellow/green with a small white head into my goblet, head is gone quickly and no carbonation remains in the appearance. This beer looks like lemon lime Gatorade, but follows style. No lacing is really left and this is the only weak appearance aspect of this beer. Smells and tastes of wheat, belgian spices, orange, lemon, apricots and other fruits, citrus is definitely high in this one. Some yeast in there maybe too. Mouthfeel is light with pretty high carbonation, good for the style. Drinkability is high on this one, very light, good fruity/spicy flavors, only thing that sucks is the price tag, St B. does good once again."
"Note: as the beer warms, a little more comes out in terms of flavor but that's nothing new. Unfortunately, I enjoy this style around 40 degrees, not 55."
"D - I would liken this beer's drinkability to chocolate milk. It's sweet and thick, but somehow you still want to down it."
"Notes: This is a very tasty Witbier with a solid texture and deeply hazy appearance."
"by far the greatest thing about this beer is the feel. It was like drinking silk. this beer was so smooth and refreshing. it was perfect for the hot day."
"For a wit, I find this too thick, and balanced too far in favor of the spice. A good beer, but not what I'm looking for in the style."
"""WOW!"" sums this beer up perfectly."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable with a lower ABV. A great summer refresher and excellent with a slice or lemon or orange thrown in."
"My third go around with the Pierre Celis Wit. Not bad but I definitely prefer the flavor profile of their normal Wit or the Allagash offering. Still worth a try though."
"Wonderful example of this style..."
"This is a beautiful and almost perfect example of a Wit. Poured into my Tulip glass. Has a very sizeable 3 finger head that lingers for awhile. Smell is of citrus and light corriander possibly. Taste is where this beerso shines! Wonderful, light and perfect in every way. Slight citrus notes finish perfectly crisp and so drinkable. This is a session beer for sure. It just doesn't get much better for this style of beer! UNREAL!!!"
"Notes - While hitting on the right notes I'm not sure this is any better a witbier than say Allagash White."
"Picked up this Wit in the 750ml corked bottle. I slowly poured this into a beer glass. Lots of head. Even with the slow pour, still wound up with 40% head. I set the bottle down and head was still comming out the bottle slowly in a 2 inch thick tower! Upon initial smell, it was very yeasty and sour with slight hints of lemon, orange and corriander. The flavor was outstanding. Wit and Hefewiesen are my favorite types of beer and this one is an award winner. It might have been my imagination but in tasting I got a hint of the minerals from the artisian water they use. The main taste is crisp lemony wit. I finished the bottle in no time. I now must try all the other offerings from St Bernardus!"
"D: Goes down easy, never boring. Great summer brew."
"This was the first stop on my tour of St Bernardus beers. Up next are Pater 6, Prior 8 and Abt 12."
"4.5 D: No significant flaws and good complexity make this very drinkable."
"D - A good, drinkable wit, but I think I prefer them sharper and more spicy."
"D - This is a very good wit beer. St. Bernardus does not drop the ball on this one!"
"D: An excellent summer beer. I'd drink it more often if it wasn't twice as expensive as other wits."
"Drinkability: This bottle may have been tainted. First off, I stored it on it's side but set it upright prior to the pour, allowing any yeast that may have been there to mix into the beer. Second, this bottle came from Sidewalk Market (a.k.a. Nona's) in SLO, which is a breeding ground for sunlight-damaged beers. All that said, I thought this tasted like a cheap lemonade mimosa. No, thank you."
"Notes: My sister enjoyed other Witbiers (Allagash White, Hoegaarden) so maybe I will spring for one of these for her to try sometime soon. This is a style defining Witbier."
"Taste is great as well, light and citrusy this is a beer I feel like I could drink all day."
"I gotta start by saying wow. This beer has now become my favorite wit beer. Poured into a Duvel glass. Nice cloudy orange color. Hints of orange and clove? in the aroma. Taste was just sublime with just the right amount of orange in the taste and light spiciness. Very smooth, creamy and easy to drink. I wish I had one more bottle. My wife doesn't like this style of beer but loved this one. Excellent"
"Birreria Paradiso/$8.50/Goblet"
"M & D is very nice. This is medium bodied and goes down very smooth. I could sit and drink this all day during the summer."
"D 4.5 - A very beautiful, fine well rounded witbier according to style."
"A better feel would make this even more refreshing."
"all in all, this is for sure a tastey burger. I would easily buy this again."
"Pours a golden colored body, very cloudy, yellow. Whitish head, diminishing. Very fruity fizzy aroma, banana, spicy. Lots of aromas. Fizzy fruity taste, some spice. Cooling aftertaste. Some dusty, might be the malts. Tasty with the spices."
"Taste is similar to aroma, sweet and creamy but slightly spicy at first, very smooth finish. Very good drinkability. Would definitely have this beer again."
"This is the best Wit beer I've ever had. Man I wish they carried this here in Vegas. Next time I take a trip to California I'm going to make sure to pick up a number of bottles of this. A truly superb brew from our Belgian brothers."
"M&D: the attenuated but incredibly refreshing carbonation underlines the delicious profile and a full body just perfectly, keeping the palate intact throughout the drink, never going thin. At 5.5%abv., the body is 110% full as evinced by a solid malty+sugary backbone, while the spicy-yeast and lightly bitter edge helps to ensure a perfect balance. All in all, one of the best witbiers I've luckily tasted!"
"Feel and Drinkability: Delicate and light on the palate, perfect. I don't think I've had anything that felt this delicate on the palate. Very light body, fleeting almost. This one may not be as robust or as forward as my two favorites, Southampton and Wittekerke, but the mouthfeel of this one surpasses them in all aspects. I am really quite amazed at the feel on this beer. Just a real nice soft round smoothness with a subtly dry finish. Easy to drink, I'll be picking this one up again, and I'm sure the impression it will have on me in the summer will be even greater. Really drinkable, extremely quenching and refreshing."
"Right on for this style."
"Served at slightly below cellar temperature, this beer was intensely carbonated, although not quite a 'gusher'. It's a brownish-tan color with lots of cloudiness and haze. Beautiful, self-sustaining head with a decent amount of lace. The aroma is where this beer starts to get good, though. Lot's of clove and spice. It's almost tea-like in the aroma, accompanied by plenty of lemon and grapefruit smells. Even better is the taste: refreshing and slightly sweet with coriander and a wonderful rising-dough flavor. The tartness keeps the beer drinkable. Smooth despite the carbonation. Perfect for a sunny afternoon!"
"Clean light taste with a citrusy zest,Yeasty with subtle spicyness.Light and tangy mouthfeel. A nice summer beer expected just a bit more taste,but not bad at all."
"Overall- I think this would be a nice beer to drink in the summer it is pretty light and refreshing."
"D - Very nice, smooth and easy drinking."
"D - Very drinkable, would enjoy this on a hot summer day."
"Pours a glowing, cloudy light orange with a white, champagne-like 1 1/2 finger head that stays through duration. Lots of lacing. Smell is strong of orange & coriander. Taste is wheat, orange, coriander, & yeast. Mouthfeel is very carbonated & acidic. Finish is crisp. Overall, it's a very drinkable and refreshing witbier."
"I'm struggling with this one. I love originality and this Wit is quite different from most. There's something that puts this beer over the line to ""odd"". I wouldn't be reaching for another, but I am glad I tried this one."
"Over all was a good beer. Flavors and smells were a little subtle, was hoping for a more bold taste. Bottle that it came in was nice, just wish that it tasted as good as it looked"
"A pale yellow slightly cloudy beer . Has a huge ice cream soda white head that leaves nice lace. Notes of coriander and citrus rise from the glass with a peppery background.There is a very smooth and luxurious mouth feel. Spicy pepper notes join with the coriander and the chew wheat character before the snappy citrus notes carry it down your throat."
"Drinkability is good but the finish is not that nice. A good beer and not too pricy. A must try for fans of wits."
"My expectations where met."
"Very easy drinking and refreshing. I would of liked a little more spice to come out in the flavor but otherwise one of the best in the style."
"Cheers!!!"
"D: A standard-bearer for witbiers, although I wish it was a little bit more lush and less astringent and drying. The rest of the package is top-notch."
"8/4/8/4/16 (4.0/5)"
"D - Exceedingly drinkable. Delicious, crisp, refreshing even."
"For a borderline sessionable beer, ABV-wise at least, this beer is a real sipper. Could really only drink one of these in a sitting, after that it would be pushing it. Taste and complexity really make this beer a treat though."
"D: A good wit from the St. Bernardus guys. Pricey for what it is, but a beer I could definitely have again. Quite easy to drink."
"I love beers of this style and this is easily one of my favorite witbiers"
"Very tasty witbier and it's a little different than many but is worth a try for sure."
"D: The head on this beer made me want to shrink down and take a bubble bath in the glass. Fantastic all the way around. Pierre Celis continues with the tradition of bringing heavenly nectar within reach."
"It has great a great white head that disappeared in to a wonderful white lace. The hazy orange body perfectly carbonated. It has a mainly citrus aroma like fresh oranges but not over powering but at the same time tart. It has a spicy orange flavor a little candy and adjunct. It is bitter sweet and sour. There are a lot of complex flavors to this beer. Mouthfeel is light. Very drinkable."
"Overall - Very good! An excellent Belgian Wit."
"I typically like a witbier and this one's no different, although this is a rather different witbier based on my previous experiences. I could have a few during an evening, but would rather switch up. I would not want to sit down and kill a six pack."
"D - Easily drinkable, this could be a great session beer if the carbonation was a bit lower. The flavors are well balanced and nice for the style, though not as bright and smooth as some other witbiers I have had."
"lemony color with a murk that gives it an orange hue. thick, tight, white. light candy with a lemony fruit and hop. taste is a light belgian sugar cane sweet, lemon, hop, strong coriandar. light yeast, wheat and soapiness. great wit. curious to know that the other version tastes like."
"Drinkability: This is very good. Its light, creamy, tastes good and is very smooth going down. One of the best witbiers out there."
"This one feels great in the mouth, and is one of the more drinkable beers I've had in a while. All in all, a superb and refreshing witbier."
"Discovered at the Steelgarrden in bethlehem, PA this poured a cloudy straw color with a whispy white head and minimal lacing. The aroma is fruity-lemon wheat and vanilla. The taste is wheat and mellon and sweet clove. I pick up some orange and there's a bit of malt floating around in the back. Fair drinkability, full feel with great carbonation. Not quite up my alley as whites/wits go but nothing to sneeze at, pretty good."
"I am a regular Hoegaarden drinker and this was my first shot at this amazing white Belgian beer. They served it from the bottle in a Leffe glass. It was a hot summer day and I was conquered by the amazing freshness of the first tastes. I have tasted many a white beers but this one was truly exceptional. I wanted to have a second glass but they had served me their last bottle. I have to admit that I was disappointed. This beer is truly outstanding and if you are a white beer lover, you have got to try it."
"D: It was a very good Witbier. Smooth, light bodied and low ABV make it a great summer session beer."
"The beer pours a bright but wonderfully cloudy light gold with a fine white head. The aroma is of floral yeasts and light malt. The taste is grassy with a bit of yeast and sugar in the finish. The feel is light and very dry. This is a very good wit that has a bit of a different twist to the taste."
"A cloudy pale orange body w/ a good head that left a lace ring down the glass. A sharp citric smell along with hints or lemon tea leaf (I think) and spices. Has that familiar, quasi-soapy smell some wits do. Light-bodied and very smooth, the spices and citric notes are blended perfectly for a great taste w/ each noticable. Beer floats down the mouth w/ a slight prickle of sourness on the backend but is also a little sweet as you drink it. This beer is perfect for a hot summer night and I could keep drinking this all the time."
"D: Six pack worthy by all means and a great beer to beat the heat. Nicely fit per style and quenches the thirst. Goes down really nice."
"Texture is just right. Not prickly with carbonation, but zings a bit on the tongue from the spices. Again, only a slight overhanging lemoniness keeps this from being downright perfect."
"This beer is great. It is definitely a beer that quenches your thirst and makes you want another. Very quaffable, and I'll be having this one again."
"Drinkability is excellent. One the best belgain wits... Seek it out"
"D: Very, very drinkable. Excellent refreshing summer beer. The best Wit ever (non-German, so far)."
"another nice easy drinking beer from St. Bernardus."
"Really drinkable beer."
"D: This goes down really easy. St. B are a great brewery and this one's no exception"
"2/24/2008. Pours a hazy yellow, almost cream color topped with a huge thick creamy white head. Subtle fruity hints in the aroma along with vanilla and some yeast. Tons of frothy lacing left on the glass. Light-bodied and refreshing. Some banana, lemon and a touch of spice come out in the flavor. A good beer, the flavors seem to mix well. No true one dominant flavor. Perhaps a tad thin in the mouthfeel but nothing major. This was the first of a six variety pack I purchased from St. Bernardus and I am pleased with this one. I look forward to the other 5!"
"I enjoyed this witbier from St. Bernardus quite a bit. Easy to drink and very nice this time of year."
"D: High, one of my favs"
"Pours a hazy yellow with impressive head. Nose is citrus and spice. Taste is tart and spicy. Very impressive and very drinkable. A world class wheat beer. Sorry I should say wit."
"Drinkability: It's nice. Certainly heavier and much fuller than I'd ever expected, but still overall nice."
"Aroma was of citrus, spice (clove, coriander?), fruit. Taste was yeast, citrus, apple, and lots of spiciness. Mouthfeel was good - carbonation was balanced well with a light body, yet the beer felt solid, not watery. There was no bitter finish that I have been accustomed to from recent beer tasting. Overall this was a great beer to start the night with."
"The mouthfeel remains creamy despite being very light. A good amount of carbonation saves this from being too light and propels the flavors. Highly drinkable. A shame this isn't cheaper and available by the six pack. Great with salad."
"Such a well balanced Wit beer. A bit of orange in nose and taste. Medium body from the wheat. Coriander is very well integrated into flavor - not overwhelming like most versions. A lot better mouthfeel and flavor than hoegarrden. Very drinkable"
"Pours a nice yellow/cloudy white color with a moderate white head that fades quickly. Nose is spice and wheat, belgian yeast. Taste is the same, belgian yeast, spice, wheat and some alcohol. Some light fruits in there as well. Mouthfeel is nice, maybe a touch thick. Drinkability is pretty good, but there is a bigger alcohol presence in this than I expect/prefer. Overall a fine example of the style, and one I am sure to revisit on the occasion I crave a good wit."
"Drinks pretty easy, a nice summer time quencher, but give me the old Celis white from Texas any day! I took great care with this one so I don't think this suffered on my end, expected more"
"Ovr: CLose to perfect for the style."
"The beer pours a cloudy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry wheat malt scent along with some fruity yeast esters. It appears dry with some light earthy notes. The taste is great. It has a smooth wheat malt flavor that's quite dry, yet fruity. It goes down easy and finishes with some citrus zest. This is a very earthy/yeasty brew. The mouthfeel is perfect. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine wit. Everything these guys brew up is world class. I guess I shouldn't be surprised."
"Well rounded. A full-bodied, bready and chewy beer that tasted initially of banana and clove and a bit of nutty brown sugar. All that yeasty goodness is complimented by the clove and coriander and spices and the beer finishes very crisply and refreshingly."
"perhaps the best example of the style i've tried so far."
"The feel of the drink is marvelously soft and rolls across the tongue. Great drinkability."
"Fans of the style should have nothing to complain about here."
"D-great taste and mouth feel very light. Very drinkable"
"D: Very high. Unfortunately this is pretty pricey, so I will have to limit myself."
"A creamy and bubbly head rests on top this morning sunrise colored beer. Body is mildly cloudy. It's a soft beer to the nose and palate; spices are minor and melded in nicely to the fruity taste of orange and pear. Hints of yeast too. Light on the palate with low carbonation; a good choice for a warm summer day."
"Overall, not nearly as good as I was hoping or expecting."
"D - This is a finely crafted brew. I will enjoy this in the future and definitely recommend it."
"D- Nice complex yeasty white ale. I plan on having in the future."
"D - Although refreshing, it's not exactly what comes to mind when I think of a witbier. In fact it's a pretty full flavored and a little intense considering most in the style. A nice beer to have now and again, but too difficult (and pricey) for me to session."
"Man, what a great, easy drinking beer."
"D-Nice drinker...the big head on the pour set things back a little bit...I like the fact it is low on the spices. The yeasty notes a bit much however and personally I would not rate this anywhere near the top of my list of favorite whits...It is good though..."
"I tried this beer on May 20, 2008 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a hazy yellow orange with a finger-thick white head that lasted throughout. The aroma was yeast, malt, and spicy sweetness. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and highly carbonated, almost sparkling. The flavour was wheat, yeast, and some sweet malty tones."
"I love the irony that from a distance this label vaguely resembles a silver Coors bottle. Anyways, not much head retention, but the body is still a nice hazy yellow once the yeast gets dumped in. I actually found a big difference in flavor and aroma (in a good way) by adding the yeast here. The fruit flavors of orange, peach, and apricot that dominate the got richer and the spicy aroma grew with more earthy notes. Overall, this wit is on the thicker, juicier side of the style, as opposed to lighter, crisper drinking ones, but it's still a very fine beer."
"Overall, this is a pretty average tasting, but still rather refreshing witbier."
"Highly recommended..."
"This is a pretty traditional Witbier, if you enjoy the style. The beer pours a nice cloudy muddy yellow, almost a light brackish color with a full white soapy head that does retain. The smell is about as good as it gets for the style: clove, berry, apple, rind, coriander, yeast. The taste is all of the above but quite subdued. There is a slight bubblegummy taste and some pepperishness in the finish. This is very refreshing, light bodied, somewhat watery, and easy to drink. This is a very fine representation of the style. L'Chaim."
"Poured into an oversized wine glass yielding a nice two fingers worth of head and looked a cloudy applesauce yellow color. Not a strong aroma to it so I had a hard time discerning the different smells. Mild tasting and easy drinking with lots of banana bread with just enough hops to balance it out. Not an extreme witbier but well done."
"It has a pretty light feel in the mouth and would certainly be nice on a sunny day. This is a fine beer and I'd drink it again, but probably won't seek it out."
"Easy to put down, but perhaps the combination of my own taste and not being as fresh as it should be (as in drinking it in Belgium), it is not something I will seek again."
"Overall: not really too sure where I stand on this one. The heavy orange flavor is almost a distraction and, in my opinion, compromises the other flavors. Not bad, but not great."
"all in all, lush and delicious. one of my favorites. there's a nice amount of spice and richness. full but not heavy. love the acid finish, refreshing drink for a patio."
"The aroma was yeasty, bananas, coriander, orange peel and pepper. The taste was ridiculously good. It yeasty, wheaty and spicy. It was moderately carbonated and left a yeast and peel taste in the mouth. It tingled the throat on the way down and I wanted to savor it more than I was allowed. Wicked solid beer."
"D - By far one of the best wits I've ever had. Nicely balanced and complex, not to mention tasty. This is a definite reco, standup job!"
"Drinkability is superb. I found myself with an empty glass before I knew it on two different occasions with this stuff. make sure to have several on hand when you break out this rare and wonderful treat."
"I had forgotten how much I enjoy a good witbier with nothing decent nearby. A fantastic version of the style everyone loves (or should love)."
"It's not offensive. But considering the source, I'm very disappointed. Might try again, if I'm convinced later that this was just a bad batch."
"I ordered it with pizza one night and really wanted to savor it, bit it is so smooth and refreshing that I finished long before the pizza and had to order a second. This is one of the best beers that I have had and order it or buy it when possible."
"It's impressive that the makers of one of the finest quadrupels in the world can also crank out a refreshing beer like this. It's definitely one of the finest examples of the style available."
"Edit: Also had the Pierre Celis Signature 750 ml. Any difference is not significant in my mind. The downside is how hard it is to evenly distribute the sediment. Still a lovely beer."
"D - Goes down easy. Not as flavorful/bold as other wit's I have had but tasty and refreshing."
"Mouthfeel is unreally smooth from the wheat. A bit too full-flavored to be supremely drinkable like some of the lighter versions of the style out there, but this is quite easily the best as far as overall quality."
"Overall, an excellent witbier from the consistent St. Bernardus. A pale, cloudy yellow, with a sticky, foamy offwhite head. A bit smoother than the comparable but somewhat inferior Hoegaarden. A little more citrus taste than most Belgian wheat beers, but very well balanced with the full, robust wheat flavor. Definately worth a try, but I wouldn't get a case."
"This beer poured a hazy white-orange (typical white beer color) with a frothy white head that holds nicely, leaving respectable amounts of lace. The smell is bready with citrus notes. The taste is tart up front with more citrus and spicy notes. Mouthfeel is dry, and not quite a chewey as an Allagash white. Overall, this is a great thirst quenching beer. The spicy notes are enjoyable as well. The biggest detraction is the body. I could use a bit more chewiness. Also, i enjoy a bit more floral notes, but this is still a fantastic beer. I compare it to Allagash white (my ideal beer in this style), but it would be hard to find another one in the style that is this good."
"D: Very, very drinkable. Excellent refreshing summer beer. The best wit I've had to date."
"St. Bernardus make some consistently quality brews. I've been meaning to grab a 4-pack of these for a while, but the price tag always deterred me to an extent. Let's see if it's worth it. Pours a hazy golden with a perfect fluffy white head that peaks well above the rim of my Pilsner glass, but doesn't roll over. Smells of tangy fruits mixed with malts, cloves and a creamy sweetness. Tastes of bananas and apples with a slight tangy orange peel essence left on the palate. Highly drinkable yet tasty at the same time. Well worth the price."
"Milky, turbid, peachy color with a fuzzy white head. Aroma of yeast and hint of lemon. Flavor of yeast, tart wheat, lemom zest, faint coriander and bubblegum/ cloves. light-to-medium body with an acidic, quenchy finish. Pretty solid example - not too much coriander or fuller bodied like many American versions, yet I must say that I'm not any more enthused than with most other wit beers worth their salt."
"what a great beer from a great and pioneering brewer. thanks pierre. very hazy straw with a white head that holds fairly well and leaves a good bit of lace for a wit. nose is nice and tart and tangy with wheat, apple, citrus and some sweetness coming through. taste is very similar to what the nose sugggested and well balanced. orange and clove are very very understated compared to other wits i've had, but this is more than pleasant and the flavors that come through are wonderful - apple, lemon, bubblegum, wheat, cotton candy. seems nice and light, yet maintains a medium body, and has a great, long finish. what a pleasure, i can't wait to have a few more of these when the weather warms up."
"This beer is really what I would expect a good thirst-quenching witbier to be."
"Out of all the witbiers I've tried so far, this one may be my favorite as far as flavor. In the glass it has a very cloudy light amber color with almost no head. It has a more subtle nose than other witbiers, with hints of apricot and orange scents. However, in this case the aroma does not explain the taste. Rather it has a full body and a strong yeasty citrus flavor with a smooth creamy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is perfect, with just the right amount of carbonation to prickle across your tongue. Although it has a low alcohol content it retains that nice alcohol flush at the end. My husband described this one as ""Blue Moon on steroids."" Although I thought this beer was delicious the creaminess was a little overwhelming and I'd probably only drink one in an evening."
"Appearance is murky orange with a big white head. The aroma is mainly fruity/citrus. Nice fruity flavor maybe a little banana, apricot and lemon. Pretty acidic with some bitterness in the finish. Also quite yeasty and quite carbonated. Mouthfeel is bubbly, soft. I wouldn't drink a bunch of thes, but I would savor one or two on a hot Texas evening. Great Brew! Something missing from my universe is back."
"As usual, St. Bernardus outdoes itself. It has the typically witbier cloudiness, with a dark amber tone. There's a strong smell of vanilla, a factor that carries over to the taste. This style of beer is always pretty drinkable, though it's sweeter than what I normally go after. Nonetheless, it's still an excellent beer."
"Excellent"
"Taste is spicy of the yeast. A great vanilla taste that adds a great twist to the beer. The wheat is grainy, like raw grain, bit husky, bit straw, bit oatmeal cookies. The aftertaste is a little tart, but not sour. All tastes are very mild and the beer is very well drinkable."
"Very good witbier from the man who virtually invented the modern style. Quite a bit different than both Hoegarden and Celis White, but very tasty."
"Pours a cloudy gold with a white head that doesn't stay around long at all. Nose is a touch of orange with that hearty witbier fragrance and some yeast thrown in the mix. Flavor is great and thick with a heavy citrus/orange flavor that has a strong touch of spice there as well. Feel is nice with a decent level of carbonation. Way too drinkable. I want to be able to sip and savor this one, but it is so smooth and easy to drink that it's easy to just go through one extremely quickly."
"A pleasant brew that is worth a try."
"Light and easy to drink, would make a nice summer beer, a good whit, just a bit to heavy on the lemon."
"This beauty poured into my mug with a fantastic foamy head. Lovely yeast floating down through the beer. tons of yeasty aromas, some bitter citrus, hay, floral scents. The flavors pop in the mouth. orange, yeasts, coriander, lemons, grassy notes. Thick delicious mouthfeel. wow. This is the best witbier Ive had to date, glad I have another to enjoy soon!"
"Saint Bernardus Witbeier pours a beautiful cloudy yellow orange with a creamy lingering head. The aroma is coriander, with sweet light malts and a bit of slightly chalky yeast. The flavor is crisp and sweet, with a great balance of spices and malt with just a hint of bitterness. The beer is creamy and delicious, I could drink this all night."
"AKA St. Bernardus Wit. Aroma is strong and malty/wheaty with a considerable citrus overtone, mainly lemon. Color is a cloudy, almost opaque, golden amber; head is fairly persistent. Flavor is rich and wheaty with plenty of citrus tang and a piny hops undertone. It feels thick and smooth, and leaves a lemony aftertaste, especially on the lips."
"Notes: A good, solid wit. More tart than most with less banana and more citrus."
"Drinkability - extremely sessionable, this beer got better and better as it went."
"D- I think this is probably one of the best wits I have had. St. Bernys has yet to let me down."
"Pours a cloudy yellow color with some brown from the yeast, nice carbonation, nice small creamy white head, some nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, yeasty, slightly spicy, floral. The taste is slightly sweet at the beginning then the yeast kicks in, slight spice, with some floral tones. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is an awesome Witbier, one of the best I've had to date."
"This is all topped off by a finish that is long, thirst quenching and quite enjoyable. A fine offering!!"
"As an avid follower (at least I thought I was) of the St. Bernardus brewery line, I was rather surprised to find this beer on the shelf at a local (Jacksonville) wine store (Total Wine). ABT 12 is one of my favorite beers and often finds its way into my regular drinking schedule. However, when I realized St. B purveyed a witbier, my love of a good brewery and the most drinkable beer class I've come across were combined in a truly fulfilling brew. The head is soft and flat, the color is bright blond with a tinge of orange, and the feel is perfectly effervescent. The taste is refreshing and has the characteristic coriander and orange peel flavor of many witbiers, but with a stronger, more mature aftertaste than Hoegaarden."
"Overall I am a sucker for a good Belgium beer this was a very pleasant beer. Considering I only had 5 sips out of it, I would definetly purchase more. This is a great beer to enjoy on a sailboat, on a sunday afternoon, while munching on white chedder and crackers. but that was how I enjoyed it anyway."
"Overall a very enjoyable drink. I still prefer the greater heft of a weisen, but this is a nice change of pace which would be great for hot weather applications. Probably not a bad way to introduce someone to the wheat end of the beer spectrum wither."
"Overall Impression: I was really hoping for the lactic twang that Celis White used to have. Unfair, as this is a completely different beer, but still. I was hoping for some coriander too. I guess my expectations let me down much more than this beer did. ItÂ’s soft, subtle, thirst quenching, and good. I practically inhaled the whole glass. Definite Â“BelgianÂ” quality to it, I guess itÂ’s the yeast profile. Solid summer beer. Definite session potential. IÂ’m seeing a couple bottles in a picnic basket in my future."
"O: Easy and enjoyable to drink"
"All and all, not a bad beer. But, for the price, and my inflated expectation that this is the best witbier ever left me wanting."
"Wish this was available in 6 packs instead of Hoegaarden."
"Pale cloudy straw yellow color with a big 2 to 3 finger head to start. Drops slowly to a fine bubbled 1/4 inch white cap that leaves behind fingers of lacing. Smell of lemon, bananna and and bready yeast tones. I don't pick up much spice in the smell, very nice and clean smelling. Taste follows suit. Somehow it is mild but bold. All the taste you would want in a wit but not overpowering in any way. Very flavorful. Some mild spicing shows up in the taste. Light bodied and full of carbonation but just the right amount to give it life without becoming obtrusive. What else would you expect, a great beer that has to one of the best examples of this style."
"I have had this one on tap a few times at the Bier Garden in Portsmouth VA and never wanted to take enough time from my pure enjoyment to make notes for a review. Had the bottled version tonight and here's the review. Great Wit..This is the standard that I would measure other Witbiers against. Pours a cloudy dull color..very dense with a huge carbonated white head (on a hard pour) that very slowly melts down to a small head. The wheat flavor predominates with some citrus (lemon) and spiciness (mostly pepper). The mouthfeel is crisp and rich and drinkability is great. This is one to savor, or to have with food or for mass consumption (I would still have to drink it slow to enjoy every bit of the flavor. A definite winner!!!"
"This is definitely one of the best witbiers that I have ever had. This could have been a regular part of my regular beer rotation if I were able to purchase it in the state. Rumor has it that it may be sold here by the end of the year. I can only hope that this is true."
"D- A wonderful witbier. This is normally not my style by any means, but this is really worth a try. It has made other witbiers I have had seem almost amateurish."
"Light and refreshing, this is a perfect warm weather beer to pair with grilled scallops, shrimp and other types of lighter sea fare."
"On draft at Sunset Grill in Allston, MA. Pours very pale and cloudy with no head. Rich wheaty aroma. Nice wheat flavour that gets more interesting as it developes. This one started off not very strong, but seems to grow in stature as it goes down. Nice."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not filling at all, excellent representation of style and one of the best Witbiers that I have had, it is a nice beer to drink a lot of in an evening."
"drinkability is good for a beer this bold and flavorful. the concentration doesn't deter from the drinkability, which is seldom accomplished. this is a wit with more than just yeast, oranges and coriander. it is a complex brew that is drinkable and enjoyable by all. cheers!"
"Drinkability: About as good as it gets for a wit; very nice"
"D--If you are looking for a refreshing summer beer from one of the best Breweries in the world, this is a must try. The Trappists can pull it off."
"D - Okay. Not terribly worth the effort. If you are a fan of St. Bernardus's other offerings (I am not), then this might be enjoyed more."
"Wish this was a little more readily available, and the price is not in line with my tendency to do anything but sip this suberbly drinkable brew."
"Overall I was really impressed by this, a totally classic beer and a great sumemr release. Will have to save one for the lawn mow tomorrow."
"This is supremely drinkable. While it satisfies the tastebuds, it's understated enough that you can really throw these back and not get sick of them. It's very light and thirst quenching, yet as still has enough ABV to do the trick. This is a very well done witbier, perhaps the best, at least regarding the quenchablity."
"A super drinkable beer I wish I had a growler more of this rather than about two more swallows. Best and most refined Belgian Witbier I have had yet. An extremely desirable beer."
"So easy to drink, stunningly crisp on the palate with great depth of character. Stands heads and shoulders above most other Belgian wits, and stands up to the most venerable of German hefeweissbiers. Highly recommended for fans of wheat beers, light summery beers, Belgian beer fans interested in the lighter styles, or anyone in need of a quenching."
"Another wonderful beer from the little town of Watou, a witbier with character, the right one when in the hot of summer you want something fresh to pair with a gouda sandwich."
"D- This beer has a good crisp refreshing flavor and a nice little hop taste to balance it, but it is very filling and feels like a meal in a glass."
"Drinkability: Highly refreshing with a substantial, yet not overdone, flavor profile. Exceedingly pleasant in the nose; smell is really a strong attribute. Overall, another fine beer from St. Berny's."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, but also complex and tasty. I just had some chili, and this was an odd choice afterwards, but it really cleaned up the palette and made the meal that much more enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is flat, save the mineral astringency. I found this beer almost undrinkable, and wit is one of my favorite styles. It was interesting, but not pleasant. I'm wondering if we got a bad bottle, but the freshness date said it was good for a few more months. Guess I'm just not into this."
"still you could drink it all night"
"Pours out like a cloudy, melted creamsicle. Head is small and disappears quickly. Lots of protein chunks. The yeast stands out in the nose but there isn't much spicing, I find. I get some stone fruits and pale wheat. Flavor is of a Dino Flinstone Vitamin with a salty/mineraly finish. Coriander is around there somewhere, but the chewable vitamin overtakes everything. Mouthfeel is light to moderate and rather flat. Mouthfeel is kind of slick from the soft tasting and mineraly water. Drain pour."
"Drinkability-I could drink this all day and still have wine with dinner."
"Pours a cloudy white/light golden with just an okay head. The smell has light clove, banana, and bubblegum. The taste is similar to the smell, with the addition of some aapple on the finish. Mouthfeel is quite spritzy, but it works with the style to add refreshment. Quite drinkable, but this one didn't blow me way. It's obviously well constructed, but nothing made me stand up and take notice."
"sweet for a witbier; certainly not dry. it tastes like most witbiers i know, but feels much more robust. the flavors seem poorly defined and the whole experience a little murky. there's some spice in there and hop flavor, with a little bitterness to keep things coralled. some light fruit shows up along with some definite wheatiness, but i can't help but think ""ho hum"""
"Poured out an interesting color I have not seen before. The color is a dark yellow with almost a greenish hue to it. The head was average leaving traces of lacing as it reduced. The aroma has an acidic spicey smell. Very slight bitterness on the finish. Light bodied with a refreshing and extremley drinkable quality.A sweet malt along with almost a sour feel. This is not like an other Witbier I've ever had. A very quick and passsing slight phenol taste. Hints of citrus with generous amounts of spice. A very crisp carbonated mouthfeel. I could drink these all day. I'd like to see the ABV higher,,maybe around like 7 or 8. Has a rich creamy rolling texture. I found this beer to be hard to review for some reason. Maybe it's overwhelming because there is so much going on. I found it hard to make out the spices used."
"Again a most drinkable wit. Just a notch above my previous favorite - Allagash."
"A fantastic witbier, and worth seeking out. Quite complex, yet still delicate. It is a little steep at $3.29 for that little bottle, but it's well worth it I feel. great beer, and highly recommended for hot nights outside."
"D: A nice summer brew perhaps. More flavor would be a good thing."
"St. Bernardus Witbier pours a hazy golden color with a thin white head from an 11.2 ounce brown bottle. The aroma is quite good, citrus is most noticeable. The taste is a bit different than most wits that I've had in that it seems to me that I can taste candy sugar (which is fairly typical in Belgians, but not so much in wits although I could be mistaken about the flavor). The citrus is noticeable, but not nearly as strong in the flavor as in the aroma. Coriander is present, but not overwhelming. Finishes dry (for some reason when I'm sipping it I keep thinking its going to have a sweet finish, but it doesn't). Definitely a good beer and worth a try."
"ItÂ’s interesting, I just had (and reviewed) a BellÂ’s Winter White Ale right before this and the comparison was intriguing: while that one was certainly tasty and drinkable, it wasnÂ’t nearly as refined and, well, elegant as this one. This is probably one of the most expertly crafted wits IÂ’ve come across in a long time, but than again what do you expect from a brewery that is known for making exceptional and authentic Belgian ales. Highly recommended."
"At nearly 3 dollars a bottle, this is a bit pricey for ""everyday"" beer, but that is exactly what this should be - An everyday beer and a staple in every fridge."
"Creamy but still light, carbonation wasn't a major issue at all. I could totally put down a 4 pack... if only it weren't so damn pricey!"
"Overall: I stated some time ago that I didnÂ’t see the point in witbiers. Beers like Hoegaarden and now St. Bernardus have helped me to see the light. This is a great example of an extremely flavorful and drinkable wit, but 13.99/4 pack, yow, sticker shock! I guess I shall continue to quest for an affordable, good wit."
"Overall, a good beer but not my favorite witbier."
"Opinion: I am not a big fan of Wit beers, but this is no doubt the best one that I have tried to date. I think that this beer is probably as good as you can get for this style. I wouldn't suggest any improvements or say that it had any flaws. If I am in the mood for a Wit, and this beer is available, this would be my choice."
"D - Tasty and great on a hot summer day. Another treat from St. Bernardus."
"This beer poured a cloudy golden color with a small head, but decent lacing. The smell is sweet and sour Â– also grainy. The taste is sweet and a bit malty. The sourness is noticeable. The mouthfeel is bright and medium bodied. This is a delicious beer that is quite drinkable."
"33cl bottle from Florian's in Auburn. Murky yellow body with a half an inch of off-white head. Probably the most opaque witbier I've had. Smells citrusy and earthy. Tastes citrusy and earthy too, but these flavors are somewhat muted by the yeastiness of the beer. Light, closer to medium bodied because of the yeast. Carbonation, while present, is also muted due to the yeastiness. Not sure what to make of this one. I think it'd be better if it had less yeast."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow, with a creamy white head that laces very well, and exceptional looking Witbier. Aroma of coriander, honey, lemon, hint of orange zest. Taste was lots of coriander, yeasty wheat, cirtusy tang, with a lot of bitter orange in the finish. Mouthfeel was thick and creamy smooth. This is a wonderfully refreshing Witbier, and I hope to try some in the summer."
"D - I really love this beer. The different fruit flavors are really amazing."
"Drinkability is excellent. This is a very nice example of a wit that does not disappoint. Cost and availability would be the only limiting factor to have this as a regular summer beer."
"The wheat is sweet tasting, with lemon backing it up. Finish is a bit dry. Mouth is full. This is good stuff."
"Very interesting color for a ale, pours a cloudy creamy/pale orange with a little white head. Smells very light, of spice and other herbs. The taste is smooth, crisp, and slightly spicy. Has a unique feel to it, high in carbonation and flavor, yet feels very light. Low ABV and good taste make this a very drinkable brew. The Belgians skill and quality never disappoint!"
"Cloves right at first. You get an earthy hint as well. Hops are not very present. Malts and grains transistion you to the finish which is a slight tartness. Carbonation was active and gave it a real smooth ride. This is a good Witbier but very hard to come by in my area."
"I was glad to find this one on tap at the new lower NYC spot, Villedge Public House. Poured cloudy light staw. Leaves classy looking Belgian lacing, left behind from the light fluffy white head. Nose is of powdered sugar and wheat. This a fruity, slightly sweet beer,"creamcicle"" notes, light spice, more fresh fruit. Tasty and refreshing, nice to enjoy fresh on tap."
" Without a doubt this is one of the worldÂ’s finest examples of the style."
"D: St. Bernardus shines when making abbey ales. It seems as though they struggle when it comes to other belgian styles."
"DÂ—an outstanding Wit. IÂ’d have this again for sure. IÂ’m sure its all the better once it ages, too."
"Edit: My review for ""Pierre Celis Signature"" was apparently lost when the listings were merged. That bottle was extraordinarily bad, chalky vitamins and expired orange juice bad. That was around a 2.9, just for reference, not applied to score here."
"This beer is a lighter orangish yellow color that kindly resembles a cider. There is a few floaters. Minimal head and no lacing. The smell is somewhat sweet but it still smells like bailed hay. The taste is grassy and a little citrusy. The mouthfeel is very grassy and there is a lasting wheaty aftertaste. Not a beer that I would try again. When compared to other wheats I have had, this is average."
"D: Hell yes. This is my favorite wit, I think, though I do like Hoegaarden. This is a really well-balanced wit, nothing out of whack. Nicely spiced, nicely tart. A terrific beer."
"Good example of the style. I've had it before on draft and liked it better probably due to the lower carbonation."
"A dull peachy color with a pretty nice head that stays for a while and laces. The aroma makes me giggle. The combo of grassy hops and beautiful peppery cotton candy from the yeast is just a wonderful thing. Fluffy and bubbly, with vegetal coriander flavor. The end sizzles a bit and leaves a sweettartness in the mouth. Lightly lemony with peaches and strawberry juice, this is refreshing and flavorful and pretty amazing. It is of a different ilk than most American Wits - this is more carbonated and well-rounded in its flavor. Nothing sticks out too far, but there is a ton of complexity. All praise!"
"Pours a Peachy colored yellow with the characteristic haze, with little more than a scum ring head. Aroma is all wheat, hopless to my nose, rather mild and subdued. Not ultra sweet smelling, which is good thing here. The taste is rather yeasty up front, but overall my first sip is better than expected. It is dry, not cloyingly sweet, with a light hop zing in the finish. I detect little to no outstanding spices here. It's really yeasty, too much so for me, but it is refreshing. As I sip on, a slight epoxy(?) flavor is emerging, a little like MH Circus Boy, and again this could be the yeast characteristic flavor. Mouthfeel is not overly heavy for a wheat beer, and there is a tangy zip on the tongue. A fair but bland and somewhat off tasting drinker."
"Very good beer. One of the better white beers"
"I was a little disappointed in this wit considering its high rating by others. It almost seemed a little too complex for a wit, maybe my pallette can't pick out the flavors so it just is an overwhelming ""spicy"" taste. It's an interesting beer, though."
"Served in an over-size wine glass, it was a cloudy yellow color with a small head. Aroma seemed a little lacking: a little bread, a little malt. It had a lemony taste, but also was a little lacking. An OK beer, but not as impressive as I had hoped. My wife, who loves witbiers, thought it was great."
"Very small, fizzy, off-white, head. Fully dimished with a hazy, kind of funky yellow color. Aroma was light malt and bread, light hops and light yeast. A tiny bit of banana and pineapple. Small aroma compared to many witbiers.Light to medium body that was kind of watery. Not nearly as good as I had expected and hoped. Needed bigger aroma and more carbonation."
"Pale yellow color, very cloudy. White head, not lasting much. Aroma of bread, wheat, yesast, with some citrus notes, not as much as expected. Flavor is not as much acidiand spicy as usual in the style. Some citrus, a hint of clove. very refreshing in summer."
"A good one here, very overpriced. As good as this one is, Hoegaarden is just as good and less expensive. But still, a nice one. Not much head, nice spices. Corriander some orange and maybe some lemon. Highly drinkable, as a 12 can be absorbed in no time, if you have the cash. I will not seek this one out because of the price, but it is a quality brew."
"I like a wit that is light on the spices, and this is certainy refreshing in the summer heat. Quite drinkable."
"Poured into my trusty Duvel tulip glass. The beer poured a very cloudy and dense muted gold color with a thick, crisp white head that produced solid lacing on the glass. The nose of this beer was refreshing and crisp with some definite yeast notes and hints of lemon, orange and spices. What a summer beer. The taste was equally refreshing and had the same good yeast taste and orange, wheat and spice notes from the nose. The body of this beer has a very active carbonated character and a light body that lead to a full flavored summer treat."
"Drinkability - If not for the price on this I would buy 1 for every mixed 6-pack that I buy. Amazingly refreshing, great taste, a real world class beer."
"one of the best (and another winner from Bernardus)"
"Good to see this on tap at Teller's in Cincy. Served in the St. Bernardus goblet is an added bonus! Pours a pale golden color, slightly hazy. There is a thin white head, however it disappeared almost immediately. Slight citrusy aroma, corriander, and yeasty spices. Slightly tart, very carbonated, which made this quite refreshing. Good use of spices, as they compliment the beer, not dominate it as others do. Very nicely done."
"Overall: A very nice wit."
"While Hoegaarden sets the tone for this style, this St. Bernardus offering is definitely worth your time. It is not as drinkable as most wits, but the flavor and complexity are noteworthy."
"Overall - A pretty good witbier.... maybe lacking a little something - still recommended though..."
"Pours a cloudy unfiltered pale yellow color with a nice head that has good retention and lacing. Pleasant sweet lemon zest aroma with a touch of coriander in the nose. Taste is nice and crisp like a witbier should be. Refreshing! Add this to one of my summer favorites and another great brew from St. Bernardus."
"Hazy, ghostly pale yellow appearance, nicely textured small-bubbled white head floats and stays essentially flat. Laces in small but numerous patches. Muted aroma, pale yeast and sweetened orange, but not excessive. Light mouthfeel, carbonation is not over-done, but fine and well-distributed across the tongue. For me, this is a nicely done Wit -- not showing its characteristics too obviously. Spices, Christmas cactus, and citrus rind flavors meld well and give a subtle husky nutiness to the flavor profile. Finishes with an uptick of sweetened lemon bar cookies. Wits are never going to be a favorite of mine, but I like the way that this one hits the style and expresses itself."
"Pours clouded pale yellow with smallish white head but good lace. Clean and fresh smelling; orange, lemon, and pepper over rough wheat and hops. Mellow and unexpectedly round flavors. Creamy wheat blends with orange, clove, and pepper notes up front, leaving a quenching hopped medium-dryness at the back. Creamy and gently carbonated body."
"St. Bernardus is the sh*t!"
"D Â– Very drinkable. Thirst-quenching and an all-round nice beer."
"N.B. I find it to be quite pricey - i don't think there is enough difference here to warrant spending $2 more per bottle than others of the style (and not to mention it is the same price as the 12)."
"D and Notes: Ok, I paid $3.29 for this, and it is a good beer...but it isn't worth $20/sixer. I thought it was very comparable to the Ommegang Witte, which was substantially cheaper than this. I love this style, its one of my favorites, and I would strongly encourage you to try it. But just FYI, there are very good domestic Witbiers."
"This stuff is quite drinkable; I could drink several in a sitting, and probably would if it was cheaper and easier to find around here. Every St. Benardus I've drank has been impressive, and this continues that trend. I'll be drinking this again soon."
"Pours a cloudy golden. Thin white head, moderate lace. Smell is of spice and citrus,and just begs for a taste! Body is light with a hint of carbonation. Taste is smooth and spicy, with a fruity finish. This is a refreshing summer brew. I recommed this beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Solid, enjoyable beer from start to finish. Big for the style, nicely done."
"Yellow haze below a creamy froth. Bright spicing (coriander and orange peel) in the aroma, which also spews out farmy odors, vanilla, baked biscuits, tart wheat and a hint of toffee. Soft and watery palate, which is bubbly in large doses. Tartness in present, while being quite dry and peppery. The spicing is fairly subtle and could be amped up a bit (I like my witbier full of spices) Light hint of butter toffee on the finish. I like it, although I still havent found a witbeir that truly satisfies."
"Full mouth that gets broken down nicely by the spice and citus flavors. Quite possibly the best Wit I have ever had."
"This is not a favorite style of mine but I might revisit this beer occasionally during the summer months."
"Pours a light hazy honey color with thin white cap that left light lacings as it fell to very thin surface lace. Aroma was citrus, honey malt, grain, and biscuit. It kinda had a clean feeling in the nose. Taste was biscuit, light honey sweetness, citrus, and low bitterness. Lingering yeast and grain flavor. Mouthfeel was crisp carbonation, refreshing, and light-med body. A good witbier."
"Four 33 cl bottles purchased from CÂ’est le Vin in Madison for only a buck fifty a piece. What a steal! Body is the color of a Williams Pear from Argentina, Cloudy and white with only the illusion of being tinted yellow-green. Carbonation is steady and pretty. Head is eggshell thin and eggshell white. Nose is coriander, Curacao orange, and cheddar cheese. Taste is orange pulp, cereal, wheat and pepper. Body is full for the style. Drinkable as all the good wits are. Top notch."
"I'm so impressed with this beer. I like wibiers, and this might be the best I've had. It's a great combo of high, tart notes and earthiness. This stuff is expensive but worth a splurge every now and then."
"This brew pours a cloudy pale yellowish-white color. The head is oh good size, and quickly recedes into a cap of lacing a centimeter thick. The aroma is very apparent. Lemons, oranges, corriander and more lemons invade the nose. Everything in the aroma is present in the taste with the addition of a refreshing tanginess. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side omedium bodied with lively carbonations and a smoothness that I don't recall finding in a witbier before. Overall, I consider this to be the best witbier on the market. If only it weren't so darn expensive."
"St. Bernardus Witbier is my first Brouwerij St. Bernardus beer and it has impressed me to no end. It instantly jumps to the head of the class and is easily the equal, if not the superior, of Allagash's fine version. I love a good wit and I love the way this one excels in all the ways that matter most. Astoundingly good."
"Bottle: Poured a hazy white tinted golden ale with a small bubbly white head with just better then average retention. Aroma of coriander and wheat is quite dominant. Taste is also dominated by the wheat and coriander with an above average body. Very good for a style that often produce boring beers but definitely not the best from this brewery."
"D: Quite drinkable, alcohol is mild, making it an easy drinker. Not the best example of the style, but it won't disappoint..."
"I'd be happy to drink several on a summer's day, but the earthy, yeasty character makes it good for drinking year-round."
"Excellent, excellent stuff. A potato chip beer, meaning you will want more than one. I could drink this stuff all day long. One of life's real pleasures."
"Highly drinkable, flavorfull but light."
"Generally, this brew holds its own against Hoegaarden (held by many to be the gold standard), although perhaps it doesn't quite have the simple elegance of Celis' creation. Still, a high quality Wit."
"A very big funky taste. And I like funky, in general. But this tastes a bit off. Not bad. But a bit off. Hard to describe, but I would imagine this funk is a love/hate thing. Unless I got a bad bottle which isn't meant to taste like this. Taste stays with you. Funk is in the smell as well. I thought I tasted some lemon in the end of my sips. Mouthfeel gets better as it warms."
"This is good and all, and very drinkable, I just think I would choose a different witbier before this one (like Hoegaarden), especially considering the price of St. Bernardus."
"Don't get me wrong, this witbier celebrates well the attributes of coriander and curacao orange peel, but the story of the beer isn't about the spices. It's about the quality of the beer underneath."
"Drinkability: Good, I could drink these back-to-back on a hot summer's day (if it were only hat here). Very good."
"Not too common around Ohio, but I'll buy it where I see it. Recommended."
"Drinkability: Overall an excellent Witbier that was very refreshing and isn't very expensive from an excellent non-trappist brewery in Belgium. A must try Witbier!"
"Hazy pear colour topped by a fluffy white head. Plenty of clumpy lace and great retention. Fresh coriander and lemon zest aroma with a bit of peppery spice. There's a soft fruitiness (pear and orange) in there as well. Mellow fruit sweetness forms a base for the flavour, with mild spice on top. These flavours carry through the finish, but are complemented by a pleasant lemon character and breadiness that linger for quite a while. Medium body with a bit of yeasty slickness, soft texture, with a bit of dryness in the finish. This beer goes down really easy. A really great witbier, this is a real pleasure to drink."
"Only $4.50 for a full 16 oz St. Bernardus goblet @ The Philosopher's Stone, Charlotte-great deal!"
"A very smooth, drinkable beer with a unique aftertaste. Would go great with brunch sometime (which is what I'll probably do with my other one of these). Good stuff!"
"Pours a cloudy yellow color with an off-white colored head that dissipates quickly and leaves behind a bit of lacing. I detect aromas of bananas, grass, and sponge cake. The taste is a blend of fruity sweetness with lingering hop bitterness. An excellent example of this style; one of the best witbiers I've had. The aftertaste is a bit bready and dry, but enjoyable and mellowing. The drinkability is high because the beer is flavorful with a moderate ABV."
"Drinkability: I paired this with some slices of a fontina cheese white pizza and it went perfectly with the spicy flavors of the cheeze, spices, and garlic. However, I like Witbiers by themselves also, and this is one I'll surely be buying again. Certainly one of the best examples of the style in my opinion."
"D: Easy drinker, somewhat refreshing, but not very engaging."
"Wow! Forgot this was in the beer fridge. What a fine surprise. This pours like a homemade lemonade, all cloudy and whitish yellow. Nice white head that becomes a 1/8 inch thick table. Nose is a lemony (sans rind) scent with mild yeast and fruit notes. Taste is a crispy wheat lemon attack with a plantain finish. Mouthfeel widens from the original crispiness to a fuller feel, especially along the edge of the tongue. The finish then dries out and the wonderful taste lingers. I'm not a fan of witbiers but this one works on all levels. Superb."
"There is very little carbonation. This compliments the overal beer quite well. Certainly, I will have this beer again [hey, I've got three more that I picked up on a recent trip to Vegas]. I had this with some smoked salmon and cheese....perfect!"
"BB 04-08-08. White head that's not overwelming but lasting well and a very pale golden beer with lots of haze. Nose is lots of candy, koreander and orange peals good dosed, wheaty maltcarracter and overall very fruity. Taste is orange peals, dry maltcarracter and lots of koreander giving the brew a slight hanging bitterness. Light sourness and good carbonisation makes mouthfeel plesant and well balanced. Yes this is an enjoyable beer and IMO recomendable."
"I'm not sure about this beer. It pours a nice cloudy yellow, with a small head that lingers. The smell is complex, with cloves and a sweet smell hard to pin down(apple?peach?). The taste is initially very complex and pleasant, with the aforementioned clove,apple, peach and a subdued banana flavor as well. If this was the end of it, this would be a most impressive beer. However, there is a distinctly salty flavor that manifests itself at the very end, thus robbing it of any thirst-quenching properties. At first I thought it might be starting to spoil, but other than the saltiness at the end, this is a very good tasting beer. The finish makes this somewhat disappointing. Don't have it with pretzels!"
"This has got to be my favorite witbier. Poured out to a slightly cloudy yellow / rich orange color with a very respectable head and medium high carbonation. Aromas of wheat and grain, with some hints of citrus. Taste is very smooth and inviting, with flavors of sweet citrus, yeast, biscuts and grain, all meeting and blending together well. Medium light mouthfeel made this brew very easy to consume. I must rate this on the high end of the drinkability scale, as if I had more than one bottle on hand, I would have drank both. Highly recommended."
"tip top enjoyable, quite refreshing yet still flavorful...highly recommended"
"Very delicate aroma. No real spice to speak of, but there is some orange peal. Appearance is that of you typical wit. Very murky yellow/orange, color of peach nectar. Frothy white head. The flavor is subtle all around. Some phenolics. Nothing stands out. Doughy over the tounge. CO2 is light for style. Very quenching."
"Drinkability is very nice and a peculiar renditioin of a wit. I know that Pierre Celis helped to formulate this but it was a definite turn from the Hoegaarden and Celis White. This was like a cross between a Wit and a Tripel, which made for an interesting but tasty brew."
"I am definitely disappointed in this beer, as it never asserted itself to me."
"Overall this was intriguing and complex; but this was not what I expected, and will probably not drink this again, despite my personal taste, I am skeptical about the drinkability here. It was fantastically complex, but somewhat cloying."
"Pours a very hazy straw color with a thin white head that disappates pretty fast. Smell is very pleasant and decently assertive, with a strong coriander and lemon over a nice soft yeasty smell. Taste is an excellent smooth and light wheat malt with a peppery bite upfront and a delicate lemon/orange/pineapple finish and a slighty yeasty/earthy aftertaste. Body is medium/thick for a witbier with a high carbonation level and a nice dry finish. This is a really great witbier, probably the tastiest I've ever tried, and only the $2.50 per bottle price tag keeps me from quaffing these all summer."
"Mouthfeel is fairly light with a good amount of carbonation and a bit of dryness overall. I could drink a good deal of this one without a problem. Clean, tasty and satisfying! Thanks to blitheringidiot for the sample."
"Drinkability: A well put together witbier. Maybe not up to my expectations from other advocates, but definitely drinkable. Balanced well except I could see more fruitiness in the initial taste...not bad, I could just imagine a better beer."
"Pours from the 330ml bottle a cloudy, hazy dull golden color with just a whisp of a white creamy head. Very appealing aroma of allspice, lemon, orange peel, Belgian yeast, and light hops. Palate is light and airy up front, a mixture of lemon and ale yeast. Light hops and coriander emerge later on, ending on a slightly malty note. Body is light and and creamy, although slightly foamy, but proper for the style. A super refreshing beer on a record hot day. I'd drink a lot more if it weren't $3+ per bottle."
"The body is very full, creamy, and smooth. As one might have guessed, this is a very highly drinkable brew. If you can get it, try it. It's one of the best summer beers I've had the pleasure of opening. Hopefully it will be available here in the future."
"$3.99 for a single bottle was a little steep. If this beer were cheaper, then I'd buy more of it. But for the one bottle that I had, this was wonderful. Truly an excellent Witbier, one that ranks up there with the best of them in my book. It was another great Belgian product from St. Bernardus."
"An exceptional wit!"
"That being said, there is no hint of alcocol -- it would be easy to pound several of these puppies if you didn't think about the aftertaste."
"Mouthfeel is light and clean, body has more heft than a typical wit. I could see sipping a great number of these outside on a hot summer day."
"Ummh. That's refreshing! A little french chardonnay. Overripe, old-fashioned yellow dessert apple. Yummy clove, allspice, vanilla. Husky aftertaste that says, ""Yeah, I'm a pale wheat beer with 'subtlety, and sublime,' but I'm still made out of grain, dammit!"" Just damn good."
"-UF"
"A quite drinkable witbier, IMHO."
"This bottle of beer made a 3500 mile journey from Brussels wrapped in a styrofoam web tucked away in my suitcase and so it was with great solemnity that I set to reviewing it. The appearance was an opaque lemon color with a foamy head that disappeared quickly. Aromas of banana accented by a light sourness. Taste was very light and unassuming in the beginning, but comes in with a strong wheatiness. In some ways the taste reminded me of watery pineapple juice. This was a light and refreshing beer. Carbonation was almost non-existant. Not a horrible beer, but I do not think it's the best of the St. Bernadus line. Definitely worth the trip, though."
"Overall: this is my favorite witbier, beating out Hoegaarden and Allagash White."
"This quite expensive wit poured a hazy golden color with a medium off white head. Solid lacing. Aroma is more yeasty than anything else but there's also some lemon and spice in the mix. Taste is quiet balanced. Nothing jumps out at me. More of a lemony fruit flavor with some sweet at the onset then tartness afterwards. A clove/banana combo I normally get in hefe's is noticeable here. There's a nice little spicyness which only compliments the beer but I don't get much of it after the first few sips. Solid St. Bernardus yeast holds the beer together and makes this wit better than most. Pretty good and balanced, in the middle of being either too tart or too wheaty, which is what I like. You really have to love wits though to buy too many of these."
"Overall not a bad white but not great either. It is expensive. I may purchase it for my wife to try since she enjoys whites (specifically Hoegaarden)."
"Cloudy light orange with a nice white lace for a head. Smells zesty with hints of coriander and yeast. The citrus zest hits the tounge first. A dry bready malt and hints of cloves. A yeasty finish with a citrus tartness. Refeshing light-meduim body with great carbonation. I must say this is one of the best witbier's I have ever tasted."
"Drinkability Â– This is the best white beer I have had. Truly delicious, this is a beer for anyone who loves beer and even most people who do not."
"Drinkability- This is right up there with Hoegaarden, if not better. Wish it was summer and it was hot outside because I could drink this bad boy all day. Top notch!"
"This beer pours into my glass with a thick 3 finger pure white head and has a cloudy yellow hue with carbonation rushing to the top constantly. The smell is classic witbier...corrainder and orange peel all the way with zingy belgian yeast background. The taste is corriander, citrusy (both lemon and orange) along with a strong clove accent, and a slightly bitter but sweet lemony finish. Probably my favorite wit, all around more flavorful than hoegaarden and more balanced than allagash white. A real thirst quenching brew thats perfect for those long, hot and humid southern summers. A winner in my book"
"A hazy, cloudy off-yellow hue, with a bubbly, carbonated head. A decent sniffing of coriander, pepper and bread dough; warming also brings some yeast-like scents. Up front, spicy, fresh-cracked black pepper; cloves, wheat crackers and bananas noted during the initial sips. Those sips turn to nice gulps, chalky and sweet, medium bodied, yeasty body, carbonation is perfect, palate is felt clean and refreshed, a classic wit, rock solid and nearly addicting."
"Drinkability and Overall: I love St. Bernardus's other brews, but this one isn't that great. It looks, smells, and feels good, but the taste is not that great. Dissapointing. Oh well I got plenty of others to try today. Blanche De Chambly is much better."
"I like the other Bernardus brews, so I figured this one was a necessity to try. Pours a very cloudy yellow color with a very small head (odd) that falls quickly and doesn't leave any lacing behind. I expected more head and lots of lacing. Oh well. The aroma has slight hints of lemon and spice, but there is not much of any of it and the malts take a presence here. Very thick mouthfeel. Seems that there is a lot of biscuit malt in this one. Perhaps I grabbed a bad bottle, but this just didn't do it for me. Not enough wit character in here."
"Thanks to clvand0 for sharing this with me. It pours a dirty cloudy yellow color with a finger of head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is slightly raisiney and slightly bready with a moderate spice dancing around in the background. The flavor is just okay. Lots of breadyness with slight raisin tnes on the finish. Not sure how I feel about this as a whit. The fell is moderate with a light carb. Not a really great beer in my book. There are many other whits I would take over it."
"Beautiful, traditional, and excellent. They'll end up with the same rating, but I think this narrowly edges out the Troublette to win this three-way test."
"Overall, this is an okay beer (quite a refreshing one in fact), but not up to the standards of the other St. B brews. And, at $3 a bottle, it's not worth the cost. I'm glad I tried it, but that money's going towards Duvel, La Fin Du Monde, or a Tripel next time (and yes, I realize those are different styles...)."
"Pours with a one-finger white head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Cloudy light amber color with some yeast left in the bottle. Light bodied and medium carbonation. Nose is a sweet malt and yeasty . Starts with a distinct wheat/yeast flavor, finishes clean. Very good wheat. $3.90 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"In the end, I rated this beer compared to others of this style and not compared to the other stellar St. Bernardus offerings that top my personal list. My results reveal another solid St. Bernardus offering that, while it won't be sharing a permanent spot in my beer fridge, seems to rate highly among most lovers of this style."
"Very subtle but good."
"pours a golden, hazy yellow, with a minimal head. there is also a little bit of lacing. but the color is beautiful. smells of citris and possibly banana. i taste orange, malt, maybe banana i'm not sure. it's is fairly carbonated: feels like lots of tiny bubbles, not overly carbonated though. i would definitely drink it again if i was rich. a great witbier. taste also gets better as it warms a little."
"This is definately a top notch beer. I can't think of another wit that compares."
"$3.50 for a 33 cL"
"Pours a cloudy pale gold with a very vigorous, fluffy bone white head. Smells like fresh baked bread with some wheat and co2 notes. Very different from a hefe; not much tropical or banana esters. Good and wheaty palate. Bread yeast controls the palate. Mild and very refreshing flavors. Some mild esters up front. Crisp, clean mouthfeel. A very drinkable beer. Good for a refreshment and worth a try."
"Pours a cloudy strange color say pink lemondade that thas been mixed half and half with water not quite pink anymore but looks like it could of been once. Has a white head that falls quick to a ring of foam, no lace. Aroma light wheaty smell with strong lemony aroma but also some oragne banana aromas mixed in with a light spicey hops are present. Flavor is sweet light wheat with a dash of citrus flavor it finishes with strong banana flavors that linger with a light mixture clove, pepper and hops to finish, most banana I have tasted in any beer so far. This Witbier diffrent from other I have tried spice is on light side strong wheat banana flavors dominate nice little beer. Mouthfeel is light leaning towards mediumish. Drinkability is quite good recommend trying if you can."
"VERY easy to drink and surprisingly easy at a 5.5% ABV."
"Poured in a brandy style glass. It was cloudy, light yellow, with a creamy white head. Gorgeous presentation, fun to drink. Smells like citrus, and spice. I wasn't ready for the taste though. This was very salty to me. Lemony and peppery. Not hoppy, but seemed perfumey.I just couldn't get past the salt taste. Refreshing and light. Lots of carbonation. This was drinkable, but not for me."
"Was nice on tap 5 months later in Florida. More grapefruit and orange zest and corriander noticed. Great appearance."
"One of the better wits that i've tried. the flavor is a bit fuller than say, a Hoegaarden."
"Pours a hazy peachy yeallow with a nice two fingeredhead that settles nicely,aroma is on the spicey side of coriander even a touch of vanilla in there and some toned down citruisy notes.If its possible for a wit to have a creamy mouthfeel this one has it very smooth and easy to drink.Taste is a nice combination of citrius and coriander spice not tart but enough citruis flavor to make it refreshing.A top notch wit I would think world class my first ST Bernardus beer what have I been waiting for if the whole line is as good as this."
"Taste is lightly sour grainy wheat followed by very spicy clove and persistent biter orange peel. Lightly sweet and sticky too but dry at the finish. the clove and orange are very bold but mix nicely. Well balanced but assertive flavors. Crisp wheat malt with a lingering semi-sweet orange flavor on the tongue. A damn nice wit. Wasn't expecting alot since abbey ales seem to be St. Bernardus' specialty but this is one of the best wits I've ever had."
"Cloudy and hazy pale golden color, spicy, earthy citrus aromas, nice white creamy head that sticks to the sides of my glass. Fresh lemons and mild spice flavors, crisp carbonated mouthfeel, finishes clean and dry with a touch of orange, great for the style, a very drinkable and refreshing brew."
"Very refreshing, and crisp on the finish, with a clean aftertaste. I was expecting more out of this one, but it's still highly drinkable."
"3 or 4 pints of this would be easy to consume, as it's pretty light. The abv isn't too high, so - if you copuld afford it - this could make a pretty good session beer."
"This is one exceptionally refreshing beer."
"An amazing brew from a great brewery. This is possibly their best brew in a style not generally regarded for great brews. Aroma is powerfully lemoney and yeasty, reminiscent of a lemon yogurt. Cloudy straw yellow with a fair birt of head that recedes to nothin a bit too quick for my liking. Fruity and light with a slightly tart finish. Mouthfeel is medium, but crisply carbonated and not at all heavy. Quite a bit more interesting than several of the Wits I've tried recently. Shame its so damned expensive."
"The head is creamy and fluffy and shows a nice lacing as it fades. The body is of an opaque pale golden color with some notes of grey. The smell is an enjoyable balance of traditional witbier aromas: wheat, yeast and sweet citrus with some cloves, some peppery notes and maybe a pinch of cinammon. The taste and the mouthfeel are delightful. Greatly yeasty, nicely citric (no tart but an enjoyable sweetness), nicely spicy and herbal: only a light hint of pepper, mostly cloves and liquorice. Intensely fruity, maybe a light nutty character. Smooth, creamy, refreshing, round and full. Great. Amazingly drinkable."
"I really want to strangle those two because by singlehandedly keeping Marlboro in business, I know they diminished my tasting experience. As good as I thought this was, I suspect it's probably even better."
"Pours a cloudy horse-pee yellow with a surprise of yeast at the bottom. Some yeast got in the glass, but I avioded most of it. Vigorous carbonation keeps the yeast in suspension. A moderate white head collapses quickly into a thin covering of the beer. Aroma- very nice. Citrus (oranges and limes) and very fragrant blossoms. One of the best aromas I have ever smelled. Flavor- malty, grainy, bready beginning follows through to lemony yeasty earthy flavors. Some herbs/spices are present as well- the knids of things found on really good herb bread (whatever that is). A very drinkable beer, and one of the best of this style I have tried."
"Smooth and clean in the mouth with mild carbonation that is simply refreshing. Unique nose, but blandish flavor. It still works for me."
"Pours a hazy straw color with a white head sitting atop the beer. An aroma of faint citrus, coriander, lemon, and an herbal spiciness are found in the nose. The beer itself is light bodied, and has a slightly acidic, refreshing character to it.. The taste has notes of lemon, grain, and a clean coriander note all mixed together. This is a fairly clean example with perhaps a hint of mustiness. This goes down as a simple, tasty, Summer refresher."
"For some reason, we do not get this in Ohio. But on a vist to Michigan I finally found it. This beer poured a very cloudy yellow color and formed a foamy white head that retreated quickly coating the edges near the beer with lace. A large amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of corinander, citrus and bread. A flavor of citrus, corindar, and wheat/dough. The body is a bit sprite yet hints of the wheat in the beer. All in all, a refreshing wit."
"Pours a cloudy yellow, leaves a nice bright white head and a good amount of lacing. Bubbles from the high carbonation were nice and active. Smell is quite good, there's a nice mix of orange peel, coriander, and wheatiness that is light and refreshing. Taste was exceptionally good, very flavorful, but still light on the palate and pleasant mouthfeel. An excellent summertime brew, albeit a bit pricey ($ 2.79 for a 12 oz. bottle)."
"Earthy and bold, yet still fresh and balanced, this witbier is near perfection in a bottle!"
"Drinkability was pretty good. Very refreshing. Heavy grain makes it somewhat one-dimensional but not bad overall."
"St. Bernardus Witbier was served from a 330ml bottle. In a Duvel tulip, this witbier was a soft and hazy peachy yellow color, and was topped by an erratic white head with good retention. The nose was quite a treat, with rich musky orange essence, and subtler notes of coriander and perhaps nutmeg. A beconing citric acidity pervaded thoughout. The taste was not as robust as I had hoped, but many excellent subtlties became apparent with some attention. The crisp, dry, orange-tinged wheaty-firm base quickly revealed a refreshing light acidity. This acidity carried with it a host of earthy spice notes...light coriander, orange peel, lime. These flavors were carried through the soft finish and lingered for several seconds afterwards. The body was silky yet light and frim, matching well with the crisp and refreshing nature of this beer. This witbier drank quite well due to the above propterties. Overall, a finely crafted and balanced witbier that aims to please with pleasant sublties rather than overt complexity and richness."
"Appearance: Golden orange cloudy hue with a pleasant off white creamy textured foamy head leaves behind thick evenly strung patches of lacing. Aroma: Sweet spicy notes flow through the air, swirling sharp malted wheat sweetness with peppery spice, coriander, cloves, and some juicy fruit tones not overly citrus but nice tones. Taste: Creamy uniform flavor with a bready sweentess, clove and spice finish with a touch of citrus and pear juice like tones, awesome. Mouthfeel: Light bodied very creamy texture, perfect carbonation levels. Drinkability: Amazingly good the best witbier I have tasted hands down, I fell in love could buy a case if the price was right."
"So happy to see this new-find at my local store - not so happy with the import price, especially because I sucked it down so fast. Had a soft and careful touch with just enough witbier zip to it, making for a distinct beer amongst the competition, and an artisanal step up (or four) from Hoegaarden. Find this on tap and I'll be a fish in the sea."
"Oh and please, donÂ’t put a f**king lemon in this one!!"
"11.2 ounce bottle."
"The taste is clean, crisp, and sweeter than the smell. Refreshes thoroughly. I enjoy the malt. After I finished each sip, I wished that sip were longer. A very drinkable version of the style. Out of the bottle, I get no watery mouthfeel, which I am thankful for, and the aftertaste is minimal. If I were to compare this to Hoegaarden in the bottle, I would say this beats it. See, I still had to mention the Hoe."
"Mouthfeel is light and refreshing with a relatively clean aftertaste. Extremely drinkable as the flavors are not as overpowering as some other witbiers so several of these can be quaffed without getting tired of the style."
"How does a distinctly German beer come off as tropical? Who cares, it does, and it's tasty! Fruity but never cloying, it refreshes and leaves a fun taste in your mouth. It dances playfully, but never forgets its beer roots. The carbonation and flavor make it not only drinkable, but demandingly so. It's a beer that grabs you, spins you around, and makes you smile. Not a thing in the world wrong with that."
"Hazy, sunny wheat colored beer that you can't see through at all. Bright white head fades to a film. The aroma is incredible, but hard to describe. Citrus, coriander, zesty, tangy. I've never smelled anything like it. It's just awesome. Very light, clean, and smooth beer that tastes similar to the aroma. The taste is spring fresh (sounds like a soap commercial huh) Tangy, yet mellow lemon, maybe some peach, some coriander. Wasn't a big fan of witbier, but I like this one, and the smell is just incredible."
"A little raw and rustic. Nothing is held back. Nice fundamentalist Wit bier."
"Drinkability Â– An amazing offering by this fabulous brewery. I think they hit the nail on the head. This is Witbier on steroids (or maybe nowadays, Viagra)."
"$1.99 for 11oz."
"This brew was a wolrd-class wheat beer. Sampled at the Twickenham beer festival at the import-beer booth. This poured a nice white colour with an ample white colour. The aromas were heavily spicy, yeasty, sweet, and complex. The taste was the same as the aroma. The mouthfeel was crisp and lovely as was the drinkability....great stuff!"
""
"Very hazy, very thick, pale yellow/orange colog. Off-white head, very foamy, heald the whole way down. Smells slighly musty, not overpowering. Sweet on the tip of the tongue quickly showing its spice across and on the finish. Lots of yeast. Not heavy, feels good, could use a couple."
"Not the best I've had of this style but not that bad overall. Cloudy gold ale with white head and minimal lacing. Big wheat aroma that's on the spicy side like a Hefe. Flavor is of malted wheat with a subtle hint of citrus. They do a better job with their Belgian Ales."
"11.2oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep hazy yellow with two fingers of fluffy white head. There is a good amount of lace left on the glass. The smell is slightly yeasty with tiny hints of orange, lemon, and wheat on the nose. The taste is light citrus with fruity esters. Only a hint of hops and yeast in the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth, very crisp. The drinkability is very good for this great summer session brew."
"I've been wanting to try this one for a while. And I thought I'd give it a go today on what might be our last 80+ day here in MN. Thanks Marc77."
"Hazy pale gold hue, white rocky head, two fingers worth, slowly fades to a long lasting cap, little lace was produced. The nose is very pleasant, tart and acidic with lemon notes galore, yeasty too. The coriander was very light. Fairly aromatic bouquetÂ… inviting. Dry palate, unyielding clove upfrontÂ… it is rock solid until the soft orange and gentle coriander flavor is introducedÂ… along with dry piney hops. The wheat taste is perceptible. Pleasant tart finish with a light acidic/bready aftertaste. Medium-light body. Soft yet supple carbonation. Lightly creamy mouthfeel. This is a pretty nice Wit. Plenty drinkable. If you like Wits this is a Â‘must try,Â’ in general IÂ’d still recommend it."
"No big deal. Yeasty, thin and boring, no depth, or complexity. Lightly spicy and citrusy, yeasty, lightly tart, with a real stale, stagnant character, really nothing special at all, the flavour is one dimentional, the flavour is very thin, and well, just plain boring. Its drinkable though."
"One of the finest Witbiers I've come across."
"Quite a good witbier, well-spiced. Though I prefer a little less in the spicing department, I think I could learn to like the over-the-top flavoring!"
"A murky lemon yellow on the pour, head is adequate in size, the consistency spumescent, color a bright white as it dissipates the resultant lace a concealing sheet upon the glass. Bread dough comes to mind when I quaff this beer, tons of sweet malt, citrus crisp and quite refreshing is this nose, start loaded with malt and somewhat sweet, top middling in its feel. Finish is mildly acidic, the hops as expected, dry and somewhat tart aftertaste, canÂ’t really say Â“WitsÂ” are my favorite Â“BelgiansÂ”, quite a treat nonetheless."
"Turbid pale golden hue. Thick, fluffy, persistent porcelain white head. Roughly textured lace remains. Vibrant wafts of citrus zest and sweetly herbal coriander dominate the aroma, with mild notes of yeast must and banana esters secondary. Understated in yeast contributions in aroma, but certainly well spiced. Snap of yeast and wheat derived tartness brushes the palate initially, then is ensued by mellow, yet brightly ripe clementine like citrus along with mild honeyish sweetness. Restrained, well integrated coriander emerges mid palate along with notes of candied lemon, reaffirming the vivid, crisp citrus presence. Lightly bodied overall, but agreeably proteinaceous and approaching creamy in mouthfeel. Paltry, nearly forgotten hop bitterness feigning a transient dryness surfaces late, only to be superceded by the oaty, grainy sweet, yet clean finish. An excellent witbier that's judiciously estery and superbly spiced. Soft and silky on the palate. Unparalleled in drinkability."
"St. Bernardus delivers the typical witbier appearance with a hazy yellow-orange body topped by a bright-white head of creamy foam. The head retention is excellent and it leaves some nice lace throughout the goblet. It's lightly floral nose is more delicate than many examples, but it still delivers all of the appropriate components including a soft note of coriander and a mildly zesty citrus peel that's both a little bit lemony and a little bit orange-ish. Somewhere in there, there's also an uncommon note of spruce that's really intriguing (but not strong enough to really garner attention). Some gently sweet malt also creeps its way into the nose as it warms. The body is light and it's very fine and gently effervescent carbonation tingles the tongue before warming to become lightly creamy. In the flavor, soft coriander appears up-front wrapped in a thin and silky veil of lightly sweet malt. It makes a suggestion of tartness but never really delivers it; and in this way it seems to fall into a middleground between the commonly sweeter versions and the more acidic interperetations. It finishes dry with a note of dull (chalky?) lemon, some gentle clove, and a lingering sweet note that's very mild but almost candyish in nature. Very refreshing; and quite interesting in it's subtle complexities. This is a must try for fans of the witbier style. Worth seeking out!"
"Cloudy golden color, with an initially big white head that quickly and mostly diminishes to slight amounts of lacing. Aroma is super sweet, dominated by banana, with some clove in the back. Flavor is mostly banana, some of the clove sneaks in, and a citric sourness at the end. Body is medium. An ok wit, but it seemed to be lacking something."
"A big 'thank you' goes out to StevieW for including this gem in our recent 'Blockbuster' trade."
"I've had a couple bad American witbiers, but I've had very few bad Belgians. And this is another prime example of just complete mastery of style. A little too yellow to be a perfect wit, but it's got a nice head and a beautiful, slightly subdued, musty lemon aroma. Very nice. Tastes as it should -- citrusy, well-spiced. A fluffy lemon meringue pie -- in a beer glass! It, like Wittekerke, Hoegaarden, and Blanche de Namur, is a prime example of this style. This brew is loaded with subtle flavors that make this zesty beer so unbelievably light and easy to drink."
"Taste is everybit as refreshing. Lots of citrus flavors, cloves, hot spicy coriander finish. Orange peel flavors and hot spicy flash at the finish then fade off to a super crisp dry finish. Very bubbly and light on the tongue. Highly carbonated and medium bodied. Easy going down and a very refreshing Belgian Wit. Look for this one and give it a try this summer, you won't be dissapointed."
"Thanks to D & V International for the sample. http://www.specialtybeer.com/"
