"Good. Not as interesting  as Ommegang's other beers."
"Great warm weather beer; light with good spice tones."
""
""
""
""
"Light hazy yellow with big white head that didn't stay long but draped some lace on the glass all the way down. Wheat and yeast competeing for the lead in aroma, with orange peel and spices in a back up role. Bready taste with some tartness. Very dry and refreshing. Another great one from Ommegang!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Good wheat, very drinkable and tasty."
"A traditional Belgium Witte beer, but it's not quite Belgium enough for me! A very good recipe though, good job Cooperstown."
""
""
""
"I'm a total Ommegang honk and love everything they make.  They are the kings of taking on the belgian style in the US.  This is a great golden filtered wheat, ""witte", beer.  No yeast reminisce, dryer than most other wittes out there.  Lots of notes at the finish: bitterness, lemon as opposed to orange, floral bouquet.  Heavily carbonated."
""
""
""
"Overall - It's worth your time. Condor recommended and approved. I'm sure there are better witte's out there, but this one is pretty good."
""
""
"I love the light carbonation in the mouthfeel for this beer. Taste is decent, but it comes off a little bland.. It has that clove hint but not much else"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall-A very drinkable beer but not particularly memorable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Probably one of the ""lighter"" offerings from Ommegang. A very good beer but more suited for Spring or Summer drinking."
"Not my favorite style, but a decent beer none the less."
""
"Overall - A decent white ale.  Not stellar, but I can't say I've had many stellar white ales aside from Allagash and White Rascal.  I suppose I need to take a trip to Belgium. 3 paws."
""
""
""
"I like the feel of this beer.  It has a lot of flavors without killing your pallet seems to hit the back of the tongue with a tingling sensation.  I taste a small amount of sulfur and some alcohol but both are matched well with the other flavors present.    I was very surprised after pouring to see that the beer was as clear as crystal."
""
""
"Good all around beer for all meals"

"O: [3.25] I am new to this style.  It is something I avoid because I don't like it that much.  I am trying to branch out and try new beers.  This is a better wheat beer than others I have had.  I have a hard time coming up with descriptors for what I am tasting and smelling.  I may have to read some other reviews to see if other people's perceptions help me out of writers block."

"I keep this around at all times. Quite easily the best model of a Witbier. Expect to smile after your fist taste. You will notice the soft citrus flavor with a crisp refreshingess that's unique. Highly reccomend any witbier fans to try this."
""
""
""
"One of my favorite witbiers. Pours a straw gold with a thin head. The smell was full of really strong grain scents with some sweet fruits like bananas. A little bit of pepper on the end of the nose. The taste was fantastic with those great wheat flavors mixing with light spice and sweetness. A lot of wonderful layers of flavor to this one. Would definitely recommend."

"Billowing white head on a murky straw body. Lemon and wheat leap from the glass.  Notes of floral, spicy, and lightly fruity Belgian esters add complexity. Flavor is fairly earthy, with notes of menthol carrying into a wheat backbone and floral, herbal tones. There's a touch of plastic phenol that becomes lightly bubblegum-like. The finish is dry. Not my favorite example of the style because of the plastic note and lemon focus."

"O: Not a terrible beer, but it is not the type of witbier I enjoy -- more along the lines of Allagash White with a less citrus-enhanced, traditional wheat and spiced flavor with prominent but controlled esters. This brings a little bit of tanginess from the wheat but none of those other components in a too light body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A well crafted wheat beer that is light and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - An easy-to-drink wit with all the traditional flavours in place. Hits the mark on the style, but doesn't really do anything to set itself apart."

"BOD 4/9/14. Slightly hazy golden pour with a nice head. Nice lacing and only normal retention. Nose of Belgian yeast, lemon, orange and spice - probably coriander. Light medium body with a somewhat slick texture. Above average carbonation that imparts a nice effervescence on the finish. Laid back flavor profile that is balanced and has a bit of complexity. It begins with tart lemon over orange, progresses to a bit of spice and ends with a light biscuit cracker. The finish is effervescent and leaves you with a light tart bitterness. A bit more flavor intensity and this would be outstanding."

"Overall: This is a light and refreshing beer. I liked the balance between its sourness and sweetness. Witbiers aren't my favorite style, but I love Belgians and almost everything from Ommegang, so it's good to have this as a witbier fallback."

"I love Ommegang, but I haven't seen on this Wit much of a difference to a Hoegaarden (ps. I haven't tasted it for a while), it is fairly assertive, nevertheless if the intention was to produce a pleasant refreshing session beer that is not not dull, mission accomplished."

"O: Pretty good, fairly typical of the style, but definitely worth a try and recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This isn't exactly the example I'd give someone if I were talking about witbiers, but I guess all-in-all it's not particularly a bad brew. It'd definitely serve as a better introduction to wits than Blue Moon or Shock Top, but for more seasoned palates, this one is very average."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was simply too delicate and soft. This simply needs more body to raise the score."
""
""
"This seems to me to be a pretty standard example of a witbeer. Very drinkable and solid. Not mind blowing, just nice and easy going."
""
""
""
""
"O-Very good beer would like to try in the summer time"
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Above average beer that is very accessible. I can see that as being a very good beer for a non-beer drinker. Beer drinkers should give it a try as well. Fans of witbiers might be a little disappointed."

"Poured into chalice glass. Appears crystal clear light gold with the slightest haze. Smells of perfumey orange peel & coriander. Nice gentle Belgian phenolics & peppery esters. Tastes citrus like with orange and some honey-like sweetness. Crisp & dry. Very drinkable. Really great beer. Awesome summer beer that's certainly sessionable."
""
""
"Overall, this is a beer that is a great example of the Witbier style. It reminds me of why I like wheat beers so much. Give it a try. I don't think I'll buy it again though."

"O: Great witte. Very authentic. Best american version I think I've had. Less yeasty and chewy than Allagash white, a little more phenolic. I still prefer Allagash but this is damn close. It wasnt cheap, but if you like Wittes, give it a try."

"O: Overall, this was a pretty good wheat beer, it's up there on the long list of wheat beers I've had but it wasn't a ground shaker. I thought the price was reasonable and the beer was pretty well made. I'd recommend it."

"Appearance is a cloudy light straw color with a finger of fizzy head that retained itself for quite some time. The nose has a potent dose of Belgian yeast and the same is very evident in the flavor profile. The finish is semi-dry. This is a solid and well-crafted offering, but certainly not remarkable by any means."

"Overall: This is, in my opinion, an exemplary Witbier that I would certainly recommend to enthusiasts of the style. Absolutely perfect for a summer barbeque, or even a backyard wedding! All the same, a part of me wishes for a little something more, something unexpected. This is my typical experience with Ommegang. They do such a stellar job of staying true to the Belgian styles, that I can't help but wish they would do something a tad unruly. Just for kicks."
""
""
""
""
""
"A very well done wit, really intriguing nose, and a very solidly done palate."

"After a cheerful pop from the cork this pours a hazy straw colored gold with a bone white head of foam that fell off to a thin skin and cap that never left. Great soapy lace. This beer literally glows in the glass and is so lovely to look at. Nose is bright and funky with Belgian, citrus, and hay. Underneath is a big malt profile with wheat, honey and grain. A touch of spice and orange rind as it warms. Taste is tart with lemon and dry with a hint of hop bitter that stands up gracefully next to a big cracker malt and fresh wheat. Creamy clean, sparkling carbonation, it leaves with a touch of honey and a taste of sour not bitter . Drinks light and amiable. Ommegang has done it again with a classic wit that’s radiant and refreshing."

"While not the most complex witbier on the market, this offering from Ommegang is tasty, refreshing and highly drinkable. It would be a perfect warm weather sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a great wit that I will have again. It's light and crisp while maintaining that typical wit profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Crisp and refreshing with a fantastic mouthfeel, although the aroma is muted and the taste profile is not as complex as some Wits. Very good overall, even if not one of the best for its style, nor one of the better Ommegang brews."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Comments: Very nice beer. Refreshing on a warm day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a lightly hazy deep straw color with a smallish white head that dissipates quickly. Aromas of citrus and pepper with a hint of honey like sweet maltiness. The flavor is a light and sweet with a fair amount of orange marmalade and light tart citrus. Light earthy hops are barely perceptible and a light bready maltiness that provides some balance. Light body with a spirited level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel. The second wit for me in two nights, that's some kind of record. Nice light easy drinking brew, maybe I'm starting to see the allure in this style."
""
""
""
""
""
"The color was a very heavy hazy looking mustard yellow with a medium amout of white foam and no lace. The smell had a yeasty, citrus and flower like aroma. You can taste the yeast, citrus like orange peel with a touch of, like rose pedals. The nice balance of sweetness/bitterness on the palate and the aftertaste lingers for a nice amout of time."
""
""
"This is a very good, tasty, and easy-drinking beer from a brewery that consistently puts out quality products. Looks great, tastes, great, refreshes. This could easily be a spring and summertime regular option. Sure, I'll turn to the superb German and Belgian brews for wheat ale satisfaction. But you can't go wrong with this."
""
""
""
""
""

""
"A simple, light, refreshing wheat beer, perfect for summer Sunday Fundays."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is just a good easy beer to drink."
""
""
""
"Mouth feel I wasn't pleased with initially it felt under carbonated, but further in, it's quite nice, enough carbonation to cut the sweetness, but medium bodied enough for me."

"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 3/28/2012. Pours hazy pale straw color with a 2 finger fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon, pear, orange peel, coriander, pepper, clove, wheat, cracker, floral, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with good strength. Taste of lemon, pear, orange peel, coriander, pepper, clove, wheat, cracker, floral, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruit, citrus, coriander, pepper, clove, wheat, grass, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with wheat; with a moderate malt balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish as expected. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish as expected. Overall this is a damn nice witbier! Great balance and complexity of fruity and spicy esters with wheat; and extremely smooth to drink. This is spot on to style; a very enjoyable offering."
""
"Light, clear golden appearance. Nice carbonation stream. Tart, citrus, tart aroma. Tastes as it smells. Taste beats the color. Great complexity. Light and drinkability is great. Awesome on a summer day. Really refreshing. Finishes true to its character."
""
""
""
""
"Can't see myself drinking a lot of these in one session due to the lemony aspect of this. Almost like a summer shandy. I guess its alright. Nice to mix up with once in a while in the summer heat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Spritzy yet full-bodied. Strong wheat flavor. Sour finish and long lasting aftertaste. Pretty run of the mill in my opinion."

"O: A very nice wit good ABV so you can drink a few, A nice beer, not the greatest wit but a good beer worth looking for."
"O/D-Pleasant. Went down quick. Enjoyable enough."
""
"Mouth feel is light to slightly medium. Moderate carbonation. No astringency. Very light and easy drinking beer. Sessionable all the way."
"O: I don't get this one. It's not a favorite style of mine, but this one seemed to still fall short. I'm disappointed."
""
"Been a while since I have had a witbier or anything from Ommegang, for that matter. Pretty thorough wheat beer. Lemon tang with a bready and yeasty thing going on. Smooth feel. Extremely easy to drink. A good production that sticks to the parameters and has a consistent delivery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into an Ommegang chalice. Muted yellow color, cloudy and beautiful. Smells of slight floral and citrus note. The taste of the Witte has some subtle saison to it, and the coriander is distinct. Overall a delicious and flavorful beer, though not Ommegangs best, certainly their most suitable for the hot summer days."
"O: Pretty good Witbier. Nothing stands out as particularly awesome, but it was nice and drinkable."
""
""
"Balanced and refreshing. Pretty light overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.5): Somehow, I never realized just how good of a beer this is. For me, it nails the style pretty damn well but has its own unique character, no doubt the product of Ommegang’s characteristic yeast profile(s). It’s not a style I gravitate towards, but the bottom line is that this example of it is just plain awesome. Way to go, Ommegang."
""
""
"O- This is just an alright wit, it's not on the level of Allagash White or even Hoegaarden, but it is drinkable"
""
"1.5 finger head with some lacing on a dull gold body. aroma of lemon, grain herbal hops and clove. Flavors include wheat, grains, lemon, club soda, herbal hops. Light body and moderate to high carbonation. Drinkable, not too dry. About as good as a wit can be."
""
""
""
"Overall: Upon first taste, to be quite honest, I wasn't expecting anything out of this world. It was a nice beer to begin with. If only I could enjoy Wheat and Witbiers more often, I think I would be quite fond of this brew. I would recommend this beer to a friend if they were looking for a nice summer beer to enjoy on a cool summers night. I guess this beer was nice to enjoy on a cold December night HaHa. Cheers!"

"classic belgian wit. the pour is cloudy and really pale yellow in color, lots of tiny bubbles rising hotly to the surface. still, the head is small and white, fades pretty quick from the bottle, but ive seen it last better from the tap. the nose is a lot of wheat malt and really farmy funked out yeast, also a fair bit of tartness, like lemon juice from concentrate. the flavor is about the same, with the wheat being really fresh and forward, which is such a rarity these days. the yeast is gold, super bright and spunky, with that lemon zest tart to sourness, almost like a sour beer or wild ale, its pretty far out there on the funk scale. epic carbonation, jivey feel, dances on the tongue, with a real light drinkable body, slammable at this low abv. a really fun beer, could be an easy transition to sours for people yet to get into them, there is so much of that barnyard stuff happening that a sour isnt too distant. overall a wonderful brew, one of ommegangs finest regulars. a treasure."
""
"Reviewed from notes."
""
""
"Pours with a slight head and dark yellow, banana-like color. Smell gives a touch of banana but not overpowering. Both in taste and mouthfeel, this is a solid wit. Very enjoyable and drinkable. It's a better-than-good beer that would be just right for summer or thinking of summer."

""
""

"Overall: A pretty good witbier. I don't notice any difference between the growler and the bottle (though its been a little while since I've had this from a bottle). Not the best from Ommegang... but still a solid choice from a great brewery."
"Poured a cloudy straw/pale yellow color with a big foamy head that retained well to top it off. Smell had a bit of yeast and citrus smells. Taste is about the same, wheat/yeasty taste, some citrus flavors and the coriander to top it off but a bit watery of a taste Mouthfeel is pretty carbonated yet smooth. Overall this is a solid witbier, and would drink this on occasion. Ommegang puts out a solid product."
""
""
""
""
"Solid Witbier. In a style like this it can sometimes be hard to compare beers but this one would be just above average for me. I like how the citrus and yeast profiles play off of each other."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall an above average beer, decent wit. Well balanced and easy drinking. Wouldnt turn this down anytime."

Nice banana and clove flavor with a hint of citrus. Really flavorfull, great mouthfeel and great flavors, just a bit weak. Nice refreshing summer wit."

"Ommegangs Witte pours a bright hazy yellow color with a tall thick bright whight head. The head settles slowly and maintains and nice thin cap of foam which makes some slick lace on the glass. The aroma brings nice notes of light pale malts, fresh sourdough bread, Belgian yeast, spice and citrus. This moves right into the flavor which brings all of the aromas charater to the tongue. This flows on a nice smooth yet well carbonated medium body and finnishes balanced and refeshing."
""
"A stand-out example—minus the somewhat lacking aroma—for a Belgian wheat. I liked it so much I practically guzzled it."
""
"Overall this is pretty good, but not the usual Ommegang ""WOW"" factor.."
""

"O - not bad but not outstanding, fairly easy drinking, not one of the best from this brewer but that speaks to their consistently high quality"

"This is a decent witbier. It's heavily carbonated and very light. The flavor is simple, but it's refreshing and easy to drink. It's worth checking out for wheat fans."
""
"A humble summer wit with mild flavors. Easy to enjoy. Not trying to be too showy. Just right for the style. 4"
""
""
"O: It's alright. I'll give it benefit of the doubt that I had this in sub-optimal conditions, but either way, I'm not exactly impressed with it."
""
""
"light bodied and highly carbonated with a touch of a puckering sensation on the dry finish. It's a great session beer if you are going on the higher end of that definition. This would pair easily with many savory dishes."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky light yellow with a white head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. A foamy curtain of lace forms around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, spices, yeast, and some chalky aromas. Taste is much the same with a spice finish that lingers with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but it smells better than it tastes in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – It is an easy drinking witte. It is a little on the drier side without a lot of sweetness. It is rather refreshing but nothing I would consider to be amazing."

"Pours a cloudy pale yellow with a medium white head. Aroma of wheat, yeast citrus notes of some orange peel, spicy notes and some light banana. Taste is wheat, citrusy orange peel, banana and yeast with a bit of sweet tartness. Palate is a light body, crisp mouth feel and good carbonation. Finishes with a sweet citrusy flavor, some yeast, wheat notes with some light banana end has a bit tartness. Overall a good refreshing session ale."

"Pours pale hazy yellow with a two-finger length white head. Plenty of bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass, indicating plentiful carbonation. Lemon hits the nose up front. There's also coriander, black pepper, and wheat malt. The smell is sweet and appealing. Wheat malt and citrus flavors are forward in the taste. There is some of the spiciness in the taste that was detectible in the smell. There are some flavors from the yeast as well. The body is light and there is plenty of carbonation. It's crisp and the finish is not very dry. This is very easy to gulp on a hot day. Overall, this is a solid and drinkable beer. It doesn't wow me, but I could easily see myself drinking more."

"O- A very impressive witbier that was very refreshing with a great balance between sour lemon and coriander. My favorite beer from Ommegang out of the ones I have had and maybe my favorite witbier. The prominent tart lemon flavor makes it different from other witbiers."
""
"Pours a very clear pale straw color with a thin head to start which disappears leaving nothing in a few minutes. The smell is of faint wheat malt and a bit of citrus and lemony hop but no yeast character is present. The taste is similar to the smell with the wheat and citrusy hops the most noticeable flavors. A bit of yeast character is in there as well but overall everything is too weak. The body of this beer is quite light while the carbonation is moderate. The finish is crisp and clean but that isn't necessarily what I'd want from this beer. Overall this is beer is mediocre at best I was really expecting a lot more before opening it would have to say that I'm disappointed given the quality of other Ommegang offerings."

"This brew pours a hazy, pale straw, with a thin white head (draft) with decent lacing. Typical witbier aromas of lemon, spice, wheat, and orange are all very pronounced and well balanced. The beer itself is wheaty with a lemon zestiness, orange and coriander all intertwining before a clean and crisp finish. A medium body is met with a Belgian-style high level of carbonation. Extraordinary in the winter, can only imagine this brew on a hot summer day...."
""
"O: Very light and drinkable witbier. Nothing complex about it, just straightforward and simple. Suitable for the style."
"O- I'm not a huge fan of witbiers, but this was pretty good for the style. It had a strong citrusy taste that balanced pretty well with the beer. Probably one of my least favorite beers from Ommegang, but that's mostly because of the style. I still enjoyed it though. Like other people said, the citrus definitely makes it more of a summer beer."

"O - Awesome wheat beer. Definitely a go-to on summer afternoons. Highly recommended, and would probably fare well with the non beer drinker, even."
"O - This has good drinkability. it is an easy going beer, and I could easily drink a few. Overall, I think this is a solid beer, and a nice representation of the style. I recommend trying it out. I enjoyed it, and I would buy it again."

""
""
"O - Pretty good. While it has many of the components of a good witbier, this was well below my favorites of the style."

"Pours a cloudy light yellow color reminding me a lot of the look of lemonade. Lots of carbonation rising to the top formming a great head. Scent has a very organic wheat scent with a lot of grassy earth tones and some lemon zest. Taste is crisp, wheaty, and lemony. There is a decent volume to it but the taste is missing something. Makes for a much better summertime beer. A decent Witbier worth trying in the hot days of summer."

"The aroma was full of grain and slight spices. Some small fruit notes, pears mainly, with a touch of apple. But this hay like spice kept everything going. Rich notes of grass and hay opened it up, and melded seemlessly into a pear driven fruity yeast body. Very intresting and quite complex, but then the smack of the spice hit you and it was all over. Really intense here as the almost pepper like notes bounced all over the tongue and really just put on a great show. Smooth as silk"

"What about Witte by Ommegang. Damn good beer. Nice white head with good lacing. Taste a lot like Hoegaarden the (original?) white beer of Belgium, and I prefer Witte to Blue Moon. Ommegang is a full body white beer with a little bit more lemony after taste. Some good beer, dogs. Goes down real nice while listening to some reggae music. Bob Marley ""Legend"" cd."

"Pours a beautiful straw golden color. Decent 1 finger creamy white head. Strong wheat smell. Nice mouthfeel with just enough bitterness. I really liked this beer. I enjoyed this beer I got it as part of a create your own 6er and would go back for more."

"Its` nose has wheat, honey, corn, coriander and biscuit. Taking a sip of this wit, I taste lemon, citrus in gerneral, some spice, overall a pleasantly sweet aspect to it. Mouthfeel is light with a crisp texture to it. All in all, a quaffable and refreshing wit."
"Light mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Very drinkable...goes down VERY easy. Not an exceptional beer, but still a good one. I'll probably have it many more times to come."
"I imbibed this wit beer from a bottle on a hot 4th of July gathering. The color is lighter than most other wit beers, showing off a subtlety that some more mass produced summer beers like this lack. This is a very drinkable beer with a smooth finish with hints of citrus and flower. Quite light and fresh and more carbonated than some others. Very enjoyable. Ommegang does it again."
"O: I was pleasantly reminded of the refreshing aspect of this style. I picture myself out in the back yard with the guys playing a pickup game of football, and one of the guys saying ""Hey, anyone thirsty?"" I look and the changing leaves of fall, remember my mother’s pumpkin pie and think to myself, ""You know, a Witte would sit right just about now."""
"O: A nice beer; definitely one of the better American-made witbiers."
"An easy-drinking, straightforward, but still well-rendered witbier, the expected flavours tilted somewhat, but it all turns out a-ok."
"O: Ommegang Witte is a decent enough witbier, but don't expect it to wow you. I'd still take it over many of the commercial Belgian wits."
"Overall a very decent tasting witbier, but seems faulty and looks incredibly weak."
"O: Quite tasty, not overpowering, just an all around solid beer. Goes good with food or by itself."
"Overall: A tasty and refreshing beer. Above average, but not amazing."
"A very enjoyable and approachable Wit--on the milder side similar to the St. Bernardus version, but certainly delivers the goods and hits all the right spots. Would be an excellent intro to the style besides Hoegaarden."
"Overall - It is more unique in flavor and craft than I would have thought. Worth a try and enjoyable. Would have again if on tap or bottled in restaurant but probably wouldn't buy again because it didn't knock my socks off."
"D - Nicely balanced. Lighter flavor than aroma but easily drinkable."
"Speaking towards my personal preference, I'm torn. On the one hand, I like that it isn't a normal wit in the sense that it is light. On the other hand, it's overly tangy. In the end, evil outweighs good and the tagniness is too overbearing. Get back to the chalkboard, Ommegang. I expect more of a Belgian owned company."
"D: Pretty solid Wit. The right notes and decent balance, just no real wow-factor. It is nicely drinkable, but it could use some smoothing out, some of the softer notes that can be found in the style."
"Not the smooth wheat beer I thought, more the initial bite of a lager, kind of like a hybrid brew. Medium/full body with a sharp effervescence up front with a slightly tangy citrus/malt flavor in the medium-bodied finish."
"O: I enjoyed this beer, and i dont particularly care for the style."
"O: All in all, this is a decent beer. I'm not much of a fan of the style, but it seems like it is a decent representation of it. Try if you like the style."
"The Rest: A pretty clean finish and a light body typical of the style. This is a light, crisp and refreshing beer with some subtle complexity towards the back end."
"Overall: A very good, easy-drinking summer refresher. Not the best beer of its style, but still a very good and faithful interpretation. Definitely worth a drink. This beer also would appeal well to beginners or non-beer drinkers."
"O: Honestly it's not my favorite Ommegang beer or witbier, but it's a nice go to beer because it's easy to find and not too badly priced. Low ABV makes it easy to drink quite a few. The flavors are standard, but nothing about this is amazing and is easy to forget."
"light bodied with a crisp carbonation, it seems a bit thin. its easy to drink and the flavor is pretty decent. You could drink alot of this."
"O- Had this at the brewery, and I enjoyed it. It just comes up a little short against the best in the style. Still, this is a tasty session/summer brew that you can drink several of and not feel a buzz."
"This isn't a bad beer, but given what I've come to expect from Ommegang this is a bit of a surprise."
"Goes down easy, though not quite as refreshing as I would have liked."
"O: Not the most exciting witbier out there (see Hitachino Nest White), but not bad; I’d have it again on a hot summer day!"
"O-a nice light summer beer, but not enough for true savoring"
"I remember being a bit disappointed with this the first time I tried it, but this time I was more impressed. I'll definately try it again."
"Overall I love the idea of being able to find 12oz versions of these bomber beers since it's usually cheaper. Great wit!"
"A nice take on a Belgian wheat."
"This is an awesome beer. I am not a wheat or white beer fan. I really love the balance and not over whem sense that I am drinking a wheat. This is a beer that many need to try and I know will love. This brewery puts out some great beers so please pay attention to what they do."
"D - Fairly good overall, the spices dominate the aroma but are not over done in the flavor profile as I feared they might be. The wheat character is evident throughout and it imparts the requisite thickness to the body. Well made, but it doesn't grab me in a way that would make me want to drink it again and it can't stand up to the very few exceptional examples of the style such as Sterkens White and DFH Namaste."
"O: A very nice witbier, readily available around $7 for a bomber here."
"overall, simple and basic wit, but super drinkable, great for the summer, thirst quenching. it definatly has its place in the ommegang lineup and im sure we will cross paths again, im just not in hurry to run out and buy more. good, but definatly not hoeegardin (spelling...i know, i know)."
"Overall: pretty good witbier but nothing exceptional about it. While it isn't as good as, say, an Allagash White, its leaps and bounds ahead of the likes of Blue Moon. Cheers."
"It was love at first site. Served to me in a snifter the smell alone was enough to intoxicate my senses. A full sweet aroma with a strong scent of wheat accompanied by a beautiful golden cloudy appearance. Witte is all the name needs to describe it's substance. The taste is simplistic yet very satisfying with a hint of hops and the overwhelming buttery sensation of wheat. Great after taste and goes down very smooth. Haven't tried it in bottle form though."
"Overall: Perfect for a hot day. Easily drinkable and many times over. No really ""Wow"" factor, but it is a very serviceable beer that is easily enjoyed."
"Not bad. Everything a witbier should be, pretty much. No St. Bernardus Wit, but then again, nothing is. Pretty textbook witbier. Poured a cloudy golden-yellow with a nice poofy head that dies down a bit with time. Nice aroma of lemon zest, citrus hops, and coriander. Similar taste: crisp with citrus hops, zest, and mild spice, with an obvious wheat base. Light mouthfeel, and pleasantly drinkable."
"the mouthfeel is again clean and light -- with just adequate carbonation. i don't drink many beers in this style, but i am not running back to this one. big fan of OMMEGANG's other brews -- if you are not familiar -- try their other stuff first."
"Not a bad beer, not a great beer. A pale straw colored hazy body with a thing white head. Strong smell of yeast with a tang to it. The taste is still strong on the yeast with sour/tartness. Very sour lemony and orange taste. The yeast and the citrus peel dominate the profile. The beer has got a thick feel to it with a refreshing crisp carbonation. It seems like a summer-centric beer based on a sour lemonade."
"O: Nice, but a little boring. 3.5"
"Overall a great finding and a renewed faith in the belgian-style americans."
"Wits are a style a generally only seek for just the right occasions, and Ommegang's offering is up there with the best I've had. While it may not be my favorite, it's price, availability, and quality guarantee it's one of my go-to wits."
"This wit pours out as a straw colored yellow beer with a billowing white head that settles over time. The aroma has a good amount of lively citrus in it and is rather inviting. There is also some yeasty bread aromas coming off of it too. The taste of the beer is of light citrus with some soft banana notes in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is on the light side, perhaps a little too light. Overall this is an ok Wit but it could have been better."
"D -- Worth checking off the list, but there are more intriguing Wits and wheats."
"Maybe a good intro to more intense wheat beers."
"O: Hoegaarden it isn't, but it's damn near close. AT 5.1% ABV, it's a nice alternative to the ubiquitous Belgian wit and is a solid choice for a warm spring day, as an apertif or with a spring salad with mandarin oranges and black pepper."
"Maybe I had an old sample but my experience didn't live up to my expectation from this brewery. Started nice with a 3"" frothy head and a hazy lemonade yellow. Smelled on the road to skunking however. Yes it had some hints of spice and citrus but to be honest with you it was so mild that this could have passed for any meak American beer if in a blind taste test or straight from a can. It did have a longer than average finish."
"The CPJ"
"Prost!!!"
"O - A very nice beer. Easy drinking and refreshing."
"Lovely witbier-I would prefer a little bit more citrus character, especially in the aroma, but this is supposed to be a rather light style, and it delivers with citrus/coriander flavors and crisp, refreshing acidity."
"O - a good example of the style - crisp, clean and refreshing."
"Pours a cloudy, yellow-orange with a two-finger white head. A little residual lace is left behind. Smells of oranges, lemons, sweet malts and coriander. Sweet malts, lemon and sugar-covered grapefruit to the tongue. A bit of orange peel chalkiness in the medium mouth-feel. Has a creamy middle with a dry ending. Outstanding Witbier right here."
"I thinks is this would make a nice hot weather refresher beer served cold."
"Opinion: This is actually a really good beer for what it is. I mean, I still am not a huge fan of this style, so this beer didn't ""convert"" me or anything, but it is definitely a lot better than I remembered before the review. Since it is bordering on summer heat here in Houston, this is a nice beer to have. I don't know when I will be buying another one, but I am glad that I gave this beer another shot."
"Another brew found at Mikro in Hamden, CT. It's a light yellow cloudy color with a fair film on top and nice lacing. The aroma is clean wheat grain and mellow lemon hints. The flavor comes on with classic wheat brightness but also carries a heavier corriander with a peppery quality that makes this interesting. It is finely but fully carbonated for a tingly luscious feel. Medium light bodied and quite drinkable. Decent brew and a little different for the style."
"Not my favorite wheat, but still a great one, almost reminds me of a lighter version of the hennipin. Atill a good beer from a great brewery"
"Pours a very hazy orange yellow color with a thick white head and no lacing. Smells of orange and coriander and that nice wheat smell. Tastes of wheat, orange, coriander and some yeast bread. Nice. Mouthfeel is medium with a heavy crisp carbonation. Drinkability is high."
"Poured a clear light yellow with a small fizzy white head that quickly dissapated and had fair lacing. The aroma was of straw malts, citrus hops and had a soapy yeast scent. It tasted slightly bitter at first and finished with a sour-acetic flavor with notes of citrus. Mouthfeel was very light in body and watery in texture. Overall a nice light belgian wheat beer, definetly would be refreshing on a hot day. ""TASTY"""
"A solid witbier. Very refreshing."
"D: This didn't have a very appealing scent, but the taste and body were quite good. It was easy to drink and fairly enjoyable. Not unique or complex, but a good example of the style."
"Easy enough to drink but I'm not sure I'd want to with any regularity. It would be nice enough on a summer day but even then it doesn't strike me as something special."
"After a long and hard Winter, this was the blossoming warmth of Spring that I was looking for."
"The mouthfeel is passable. The carbonation is adequate. The drinkability is nice. I feel on a warm summer night, Witte could be someone's go to beer. Just not mine."
"right when I poured this beer I quickly noticed it's frosted pale yellow color. The smell is a light citrus with maybe a touch of vanilla. The taste is a crisp hoppy citrus. This is one of the finer wheat beers I've had. There is deffinatly a milder flavor than some of the belgian-style beers I've had in the past, which, to me, just makes it more drinkable. Over all this beer is a beauty. Very nice."
"D: Swirled a bit to dissipate the carbo a bit. Super quaffable."
"Drink - The beer was enjoyable, but I was a little confused with the slight skunky smell. Maybe I had an off bottle. Still happy I tried it and would be willing to drink it again."
"That's taken word-for-word from their website. I think I enjoyed it a little more before I read that. Especially the part about the fluffy clouds."
"Overall: Rather disappointing. I was expecting more from this brewer. Pales compared to an Allagash White. Glad I got this one as a single. Would skip this in the future."
"The pour brings a hazy straw-yellow brew with a good white head and a bit of lacing plus a thin collar atop the beer. The nose is quite plain with some lightly-sweet wheat and a very, very mild citrus presence. No real spice or any indication of Belgian yeast. The flavor is about the same but a bit more grainy. Feel is pretty light with moderate carbonation. Nothing bad about this, but nothing at all impressive either."
"D: This is much more malt-heavy than most wits. It's flavorful, refreshing, crisp, and a quality version of a mediocre style."
"This is a perfect summer beer, but its enjoyable year round."
"D: A close rendition of the style, this beer is loaded with traditional flavors that transmit clearly through the taste. Bitterness and acidity are not shy here, even high at times in the case of the latter, but stay appealing to the senses. Perhaps not as imaginative as some American-brewed wits, it stands entirely in-line with the Belgian notables in wide distribution."
"D - Nothing special here. It's a good standard. There is room for improvement though."
"Drinkability: The alcohol is smooth and the finish is very clean. The lemon-pucker keeps me from ranking higher on drinkability. Again, it's not a bad sensation, I'm just not used to it from a beer."
"I wouldn't choose this one over an Allagash White, not by a long shot, but an above average offering from a great brewery."
"D: Very sharp drinkability, razor like from the carbonation that gives this some zip and life when drinking. As with most of their drinks this was very well mannered, finely brewed with a great craftmenship that can be experienced with every sip."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: A refreshing witte and on par for the style. Light bodied, agreeable flavors, always a solid option."
"Beer poured a very pale and translucent champagne color. Aroma was green apples, coriander and mild citrus. The taste was light and sweet with a subtle green apple sourness. Mild umami on the finish. Pineapple in there as well. Mouthfeel was effervescent. Light. Finishes clean and crisp. Lager-like. Overall the best Wit I have had."
"M: A bit chalky. Medium bodied with a medium finish."
"Medium body, a little creamy, very easy to drink and pretty refreshing. Decent Belgian-styled beer from Ommegang once again."
"Drinkability: It's not a bad example of the style, but I would really like to see some of the flavors kicked up a little bit. Drinkable, but not something I would go after."
"Bottle. Pours golden with a medium lasting, foamy, white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of piney hops, biscuit malt and hints of citrus. Medium, crisp body. Taste is of piney hops, yeast, sweet malt, some citrus and spices. Excellent, complex whit."
"D - I would have a few of these with friends on a hot day but it lacks components of a Belgian Wit that I would normally expect."
"D-high, particularly under the proper conditions"
"D - Very drinkable. It is smooth and crisp and the nice tartness through the flavor really balances the beer well."
"Another second chance with another Ommegang oldie-but-goldie. It pours a slightly hazed pale golden straw topped by somewhere around a finger of white foam. The nose comprises coriander, wheat, lemon zest, and a touch of mandarin orange. The taste, not wanting to make any waves, stays this course beautifully, with the added effect of light pineapple near the finish. The body is pretty light, with a moderate carbonation and a refreshing feel. Overall, a very tasty wit, one of the better ones readily available 'round these parts."
"This is a nice Witbier with a classic feel befitting the style. Served without a lemon (although I believe one would enhance some of the flavors) a nice crisp, citrus flavor emergese allowing for a very drinkable exepereince. Nothing stands out as great but overall a very nice offering."
"As far as wits go, this one tilts more to the lemon side as opposed to some that are sweeter and spicier. To be honest, I do prefer the ones with more bold orange and coriander tastes. That said, this is a very drinkable beer that I'd have no problem accepting."
"Although it can't say the taste will overwhelm you, it is pretty good. Maybe a little too subdued and simple, but I'd drink it again."
"From the corked 25 1/2 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on October 5, 2010. It is a very frothy, heady pour with a cloudy pale yellow buried down beneath the soft bubbles. There is a nice wheat and yeast balance in the aroma along with something banana-like but not much in the way of spice. Wheat and yeasty head up the taste as well with a pleasant but thin dry hoppiness at the end. Very appealing beer."
"With that said, I feel my first judgement of it to be flawed after experiencing it poured correctly from a place that knows how to truly pour belgians. I ordered it from the BXL Cafe in Times Square and completely changed my mind about the beer. The proper serving glass combined with the correct amount of bubbly head allowed me to smell and taste subtle banana and clove that I had not before noticed. There was a small taste of citrus and coriander but it wasn't overwhelming. The dynamic of this second experience truly changed my mind about this beer. I would definitely have another Witte, especially combined with a nice afternoon brunch."
"Notes: This beer is not very well balanced. The tart lemon taste dominates far too much, and the other flavors are muted. Mouthfeel is off-putting as well. I was disappointed by this beer. A sub-par offering from an otherwise excellent brewery."
"D: I'd hit it again, and again, and again... (Edit: After having the 2nd glass 1+ hour later, with a touch more warmth ~55F, the lactic nature is overpowering and unpleasant. If this had been my first experience with the beer the rating would have been lower)"
"Starts sweet & fruity with predominantly citrus flavors, but fades to finish slightly watery with a hint of hops in the back. Light- to medium-bodied with average carbonation that fizzles my tongue as it sits in my mouth. Easy to drink, however I'd likely order a different hef/wit if I wanted another."
"Props to Ommegang, I dig't!"
"Out of a bottle this beer was a hazy, pale gold color with one finger of pure white head. The retention was average and the lacing consistent in sliding bands. The aroma was of wheat, yeast, light alcohol esters, pale malt and some slighty floral notes. The flavors were a complex and well-balanced blend that started with dry wheat followed by a sweetness of banana and light tropical fruits from the yeast esters followed by a floral hops note and finally a lingering pale and sweet malt finish. Slightly spicy, grainy yet not too-dry, and very pleasant. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium and the carbonation on the frothy side."
"Poured from bottle into Ikea beer mug. Very light golden color that formed a nice, white head that subsided pretty quickly. A hint of citrus on the nose, but not much otherwise. A very light citrust taste, as well (maybe too light), with hints of lemon and orange. Very slight bitter aftertaste, and the drink leaves an oily feel in the mouth. Definitely very drinkable and it's a pleasant drink, but all in all the taste isn't too interesting."
"Overall, one of the better witbiers I've had, I enjoy the citrus. I could see this becoming one of my favorite light beers."
"A bit more delicate than some of the other standard white ales that are normally available. I picked this up since the store was out of Allagash White. While this is a nice little beer, I'll still look for Allagash White next time."
"Overall good. I was turned off a bit by the ginger in the smell at first but thankfully the ginger isn't too strong in the taste, mostly citrusy. It complimented a lemon chicken over spaghetti dinner nicely."
"The mouthfeel is excellent, at least from this keg on tap. I remember thinking this was a touch watery the last time I had it, but it's actually perfect on this hot summer day. Light body with a really refreshing zing of carbonation. Both the finish and aftertaste are pleasant. This is a great example of the style - a wonderful summertime beer that delivers a ton of taste and stays true to tradition. Bravo!"
"D - like most of this style, quite drinkable."
"Ommegang's Witte looks like a wit in that it is hazy sunset yellow with some tan spots, not quite clear, not quite unseethroughable whatever that means. A semi bit of ivory white foam on top that sticks around at times, leaving no lace, loose bubbles. Smells like a malty wit, the malt is pronounced with a backing of wheat and light spices, some coriander. Taste is kinda bland, I know it's a simple style but the malt seems to overpower this one, basically wheat and malt. Some light lemon and orange with lighter coriander and clove. Mouth was thin and bubbly and easy going, went down like a charm, light hit of carb. I drank my pint real quick, this is a sinch, but the taste is boring and bland, a touch more balance would of did some good. Nothing touches my favorite wit that comes from the best brewery in Maine."
"Witte is served up a cloudy bright yellow with a frothy looking white head. The head has the superb staying power one would expect in a wheat beer, and leaves lazy globs of lace on the side of the glass. The aroma is very bright and fresh with plenty of lemony citrus and slightly tart wheat. I also detect some coriander and clove in there, but this wit is less spicy than a lot of other examples I have tried. The flavor is lead by the wheat, which has a fairly firm tartness to it. It is very refreshing, with other flavors including coriander and lemon zest. One again, not as spicy as some, and perhaps a bit too much emphasis on the malt, but still tasty. The body is medium with a spritzy and spiky mouthfeel that has plenty of carbonation. I feel like I keep wanting to use the word ""bright"" to describe everything, and I think the lively, yet not overdone, carbonation is one of the main reasons. This is a very drinkable beer that is solidly made. While it is not in the same realm as beers like Allagash White, this is still a quality beverage perfectly suited for the summertime."
"Overall a good witte, but I've had better."
"On tap at chez mike in east greenbush NY. Cloudy straw in color with a big fluffy head. Smell has yeast lemon and orange but much else, not to say that it's bland. Mouthfeel is smooth but a bit too watery for me. Very drinkable though, another well executed beer from ommegang which is why I always come back for more."
"This was a pretty tasty, refreshing beer, it had good citrus flavor and would make for a great beer on a hot day."
"Pours a hazy pale yellow, with a white head. In the aroma, wheat note and, well, it smells like hot dog water. In the taste, wheaty notes, a lemon zest, and hot dog water. A smooth and light bodied mouthfeel, with a dry lemon citrus in the aftertaste. Nice lemon zest, but the whole thing is like hot dog water."
"Pours a cloudy straw yellow with a sticky, narrow white head. Smells like fresh sweetgrass and lemon and citrus. Tastes more floral and clovey than the nose. Decent body, aftertaste is a little sour. Feel is a bit thin, but this brew goes down smooth and is easy to drink."
"pours a hazy pale yellow color with a small head then a fresh ring..smell is spice and fruit clove and yeast a bit of citrus..tart,sweet and crisp would describe the taste with a wheat and lemon flavor yeast and bread malt in the background ..mouth feel is thin a little watery but for a wheat it was crisp and tasty..it is highly drinkable and i enjoyed much on this hot summer day in mpls..recommended"
"D: A nice choice to go with the roast beef, the ale cut through the horseradish. A nice beer on tap but not my favorite Ommegang offering."
"D- Refreshing and not overly spiced which I liked. I didn't notice much of any yeast flavor at all which was surprising. Nice lemon flavor that wasn't too sour. This hit the spot while cooking and enjoying dinner, but otherwise not remarkable."
"Overall this was a solid beer but the flavors were just too muted for it to be a good beer. Not worth seeking out but if it's around it's not worth avoiding."
"Notes: Ommegang makes a number of stellar beers, most all of which I have tried."
"Overall a beer that could be an expensive (over-priced?) summer wheat ale."
"Bright pale yellow color with excellent clarity. Big white fizzy head that quickly dissipated. no lacings or cap. Spicy corriander aroma dominates the bouguet followed by wheat and citrusy orange. Orange flavor in the beginning followed by light wheat and a big spicy finish accenuated by a rush of carbonation. Dry finish. A nice refreshing summer ale....very easy to drink."
"D : A very good brew, very thirst quenching. Both sippable and gulpable."
"d: This is a disappointment coming from Ommegang. Its a serviceable wit, but I expected a lot more from these guys."
"Easy to drink, low ABV. Don't listen to the pouring intructions, don't be afraid to mix up the flavorful yeast in there. It's a bit expensive for something bested by Hoegaarden. Worth a try but I'm more looking forward to Hennepin."
"Had this one at Flying Saucer and reviewed from notes. Served from a 750mL corked and caged bottle a hazy light straw yellow with a decent off white head. The beer has a nice sweet fruit aroma with mild spice and bubblegum. The taste is a nice blend of sweet fruits and a nice amount of Belgian spice. The beer is light and refreshing, great for the style. This is certainly an enjoyable beer, but not one I'd buy often in a pricey 750mL bottle."
"Prefer a bit more orange in a wit."
"Hazed, cloudy lemon cream with a big white shaving cream head that leaves splotches of lace as it melts. Soft lemon, coriander and overripe banana and wheat in the aroma. Tart and spicy with puckering lemon peel and belgian spice. Finishes tart and a little chalky. Slightly lighter bodied than I prefer with prickly carbonation. An above average wit and a nice beer for a hot day."
"pours a nice heady yellow milky color with a beautiful white fluffy 3 finger head that dissapates are a normal pace. Smell is astrigenty lemon peel, corriander and a touch of parsley. Earthy and lemony for sure. Taste is nice and light, has a great creamyness that leaves way to bitter lemon peel. one dimensional for sure, but tasty. Mouthfeel is very nice aswell. has great creamy carbonation, dry finish. Drinkability is high as hell. perfect in my opinion for this style. great summer drinker."
"pours a very cloudy pale yellow color with good white head frothy head that recedes quick. spare to no lacing and average carbonation. citrusy wheat smell with some spiceness to it. taste is much the same with some lemony hints. thin slick texture, and a light body. moderately sweet finish and average flavor duration. very good brew."
"It's not bad but it's not on par for Ommegang either."
"overall a well made, well balanced, dynamic beer, definitely worth it, highly recommended"
"This beer would be ideal with summer barbeque fare - if you're invited to one, bring some for your more discerning friends."
"Corked and caged 750. Fluffy, bright white cap with good head retention and some clumpy lace. The beer was cloudy and a pale straw yellow. Nice aroma, grassy and lemony, bread, coriander, with faint banana. Moderate bitterness, a little more than I expected, but it gave the beer more of a refreshing character. Wheat, lemon, coriander, a bit fruity and tart in the finish. Orange flavours became apparent as it warmed to room temp, but they were pretty much absent at slightly colder temperatures. Dry and medium to light bodied with a little slickness to the texture. Carbonation was higher than average and kept the beer lively throughout. Easy drinking and a solid example of the style."
"D - Drinkable; all the flavors mesh without any of them being over powered, but I don't think I'd want more then one."
"Drinkability/Overall - A great beer, does not need citrus slice to enhance flavour"
"Ommegang Witte poured a very light color, with a head that stayed for most of the beer. Overall it had a very nice smell, with vanilla. The taste was a bit spicy, and there was just a bit of a taste of vanilla. It was very light, and very easy to drink. Overall it was too light, it needed much more flavor."
"Overall - In my opinion a great witbier and although I'm a little biased worthy of at least a B+ if not higher"
"D- A very drinkable wittier, would be on my list for a nice hot day. Easy to finish a bomber by myself. Not a bad offering from Ommegang."
"Had a pint of this at Amsterdam ale house. I expected it to be drier than it was. There was an orange in it when I got it so that might have effected my opinion but in general sweeter than I wanted. Boot witte color and carbonation a light drinker . Not bad."
"Drinkability - lawnmowing beer in quantities. This one deserves accolades."
"Flavor is soft without a whole lot of yeast influence. This is a bit like a cross between an American wheat and a wit than a full on Belgian white ale. Coriander is there and the orange/lemon zest is but a mild hint. Wheat notes are there aplenty and provide some snappy crispness. Easy to drink the whole 750, no question there but for the price I would pick a sixer of hoegaarden over this 99 times out of 100. I think Ommegang should be able to do so much better than this...hell, American breweries that dont even specialize in Belgians do better wits than this."
"Excellent Beer."
"Pours a very pale yellow color with a big fluffy white head that is semi loose but retains it's self very well and leaves an attractive lace. The aroma is like a delicious spiced bread with plenty of clove and yeasty notes with some orange but more lemon peel notes. The flavor is refreshing but more mild and a bit less complex than the aroma. The nice clove spiciness is there but it doesn't dominate the flavor and lets some orange & lemon citrus, some tartness, and plenty of yeasty breadiness through. As light as this beer is the palate is lively and full without being heavy, very nice. A tasty witbier that I would be happy to drink any day."
"Although this won't turn me away from my summer go-to in Allagash White, its definitely a good option that I'll be returning to again."
"Feel/Drink: Decent mouthfeel and drinkablity is just right. Not a bad offering from Ommegang."
"Drinkability: Fairly pleasant and easily drinkable, serving as a good thirst-quencher for the warmer months."
"The pour is rather lackluster, a hazy straw yellow with a thin wispy head that recedes in a hurry leaving nothing really. The nose is decent, the spicy coriander is obvious but not excessive, and there's a definite citrus character with some juicy orange and tart lemon. Moderately wheaty and bready, this smells decent. The palate opens with a wheaty twang and a little tart lemon character. The coriander is definitely noticeable, but in check, working well with the lemon peel. I also get a little pepper. Yeast character is rather low. Drying on the finish, albeit a touch watery, this beer is moderately carbonated. Light in body, this is refreshing and very drinkable. While a delicate and well-balanced witbier, it isn't as enjoyable as the best of the lot. However, it did pair quite well with my rabbit."
"Drinkability - This is a great summertime beer. Light, refreshing, and not overly fruity or spicy. A nice balance between all the elements."
"US$2.50 per 12 ounce bottle might be a bit restrictive for some."
"D: This is a very light and refreshing beer. I would definitely drink more than one of these to relax on a hot summer day."
"The flavor is sort of lacking in the Witte, so while it's refreshing, it's also a tad disappointing to swallow. I hope that Ommegang, otherwise a first rate brewery, can improve on this lackluster offering."
"Not as good as I remembered it being, but still not too bad."
" D- The dry crisp beer really shows off the flavors of the yeast with all the flavors blending together nicely. A good subtle depth makes this a great quafting beer."
"Thanks to Joey Capps for bringing this one for all of us to try. Pours a cloudy yellow with a big white head. Also some sediment floaties add the the appearance. Aroma is floral, spicy and citrus. Taste is subtle citrus with some spicy notes. Very smooth, and almost no aftertaste. A little mild, but still really good."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of citrus and spices. Taste is a good combination of spices and citrus, with some notes of yeast. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this is a fine quality brew."
"Good mouthfeel, not too carbonated. Nice and smooth, very drinkable."
"Taste is citrus with some Belgian hops and spice. Nice bubbly mouth feel and pretty drinkable."
"D - Soft and easy to drink. Not overly fruity like some other wits. The ABV is also reasonable which makes this a reasonable one to have a few of."
"Pours a slightly hazy clear yellow with a big white head. Smells strongly of musty belgian yeast esters. Taste is light and cidery up front, with a tart wheaty middle, and a spicy finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, low carbonation. Drinkability is good. A good example of a Wit that I would drink again."
"M/D: Very enjoyable and refreshing. Great beer to relax to, dont really see it pairing with food much, but a nice and easy drink."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer, both in terms of the ABV and the crisp flavor of it. This may be my favorite witbier I've had so far. I can't wait until summertime to get my hands on a few more of these and kick back by the pool with 'em."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, mild kick, excellent representation of style, I haven't been the biggest fan of Ommegang overall but this is a very nice lighter Belgian style beer that is worth drinking for a long time."
"D - Overall, this beer is quite quaffable, nice and refreshing. However it lacks depth and the flavor profile is fairly straightforward."
"D- A very refreshing beer; but a little too straight-forward in terms of its taste and smell."
"D) A Decent witbier."
"D- The easy-drinking nature of this style and the high carbonation makes this beer top notch on drinkability. Fantastic for a hot summer day or for a moment where you just want to down a quick one."
"Unfortunately, my wife didn't like this one, even though she's a fan of witts and heffe's. She said it reminded her too much of Budweiser. I didn't get that impression, but I did get her glass."
"D: Highly sessionable, but shouldn't all Witbiers be?"
"I've been more impressed with other witbiers, and far more impressed with other Ommegang beers. While it's by no means offensive, and it's very drinkable, but it's certainly pretty insipid."
"It's mild flavor doesn't exactly stand up to some of the bolder Belgian examples, but this is one of the better American interpretations I've had. Keeping in mind that at the time of this sampling I've yet to try Allagash White."
" Would be better with some frothier head with better retention and a thicker mouthfeel."
"Ommefest. Light golden color with oranges and spices floating around the nose. It was a hot day so it hit the spot with a fresh crisp taste and nice acidity. Not as complex as some of their others but none the less a decent beer. This is something for a nice crisp summer salad for the early evening. I actually wish this one compared with their others quality wise."
"Drinkability: This is a nice clean beer with a good aftertaste. It is above average for the style, but I have had more interesting in the style. I could session this on a summer's day."
"D - REfreshing, light."
"Pretty carbonated up front, maybe too much so with some peppery lemon zest spiciness, citrus peel(some lemon but mostly orange peel), a slightly creamy body and a crisp dry finish."
"M/D: Could have used a bit more body, more spices, more malt instead of relying on the wheat tangy-ness. I still find it VERY refreshing. There are better witbiers out there though."
"Taste: Starts roasted grain flavor and then pulls a 180 as a tartly lemon tangy sweetness kicks in. That tartness is nicely carried out by a spritzy carbonation."
"There is a slew of noticeable spices, such as green curry, clove, and nutmeg, with some nuttiness of cashews and acorn. Strong lemon rind taste in the hop structure balances it out nicely."
"Is this a drinkable beer? Yes, but with nearly every other ""Belgian style"" beer not actually made in Belgium, it falls a bit short. If you enjoy this style beer it's certainly worth a try, but there's better out there."
"good, solid flavors and balance, a very classic style wit beer. crisp, refreshing, slightly tart with good balance, reminds me of champagne"
"D: Great to sit back and relax with. A very easygoing summer brew."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with a lively carbonation, excellent."
"Solid wheat beer for those who appreciate wheat varieties."
"D = This one goes down wonderfully easy on a hot Summer afternoon and can be repeated with no regrets."
"MF&D - highly carbonated with small bubbles, with a medium thin body. the drinkability is fine, but the carbonation might be a bit much, although it is very mouthcoating."
"This is a very drinkable, delicious brew; excellent presentation and taste characteristics ... very thirst quenching. The dryness created by the carbonation makes it hard to put this down. A terrific Belgian style brewed in the USA!"
"Overall, a very refreshing and crisp beer to enjoy on a great summer night like tonight!"
"It has a huge and fizzy head. The color is a very light straw and it has a uniform cloudiness. The aroma is of light malt/straw and a bit of banana. I don't get any citrus or bread. It's very sharp on the tongue with its carbonation. Good orange peel and lemon citrus flavors come through in the middle to end. And just a hint of spice at the end. Maybe clove and coriander. It has a great citrus finish that cleans the tongue. A great hot day brew or one just to enjoy lazily."
"Prost!"
"Overall pretty good, a little different then some wits in that its not as sweet. Sessionable if anywhere around here served this. Looking forward to more Ommegang in the future."
"Mouthfeel: Light but overcarbonated in my opinion."
"D: Fairly drinkable, no overpowering tastes, but I was hoping for more."
"D: This was pretty unimpressive. I doubt I'd get it again."
"I'm a big fan of Ommegang and this was very good, even if I had hopes for perhaps a slightly better effort."
"This reminds me more of an American wheat than a wit. Not a bad bear by any stretch, but it was just very uninteresting. What it would make is a nice session when you just want to drink a bunch to cure a thirst on a hot day."
"Poured a hazy pale yellow color into my pint glass. About an inch of fluffy head, but was very fleeting. Really dig the smell of this, as I do with many witbiers. Filled with lemony citrus and a bit of banana, I got some coriander, but not as pronounced as some reviewers. The taste is lovely. Lemon, orange, coriander, bready yeast, banana, and maybe a hint of clove. This is a very refreshing brew that can be enjoyed in multiples on a hot summer day. Unfortunately, I only had two. I felt the carbonation was also spot-on, which added to the refreshing sensation."
"taste is smooth, wheat, yeast, some citrus, some peanut, and some banana, ends a little tangy, and a little dry."
"3.5 impressed me out of the gate, and it's pretty refreshing, but the bicarbonate of ciriander overpowers the grain and subtler virtues"
"I poured into a pint glass to little head. It is pale yellow in color. It smells of citrus and some floral notes. It tastes of coriander. I also get hints of banana in the taste and smell after it warms up. It is quite a tasty beverage. Very nice after an afternoon of mowing."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. A very good American example of a witbier style. I could drink this one in a session easily."
"D: This is a nice witbier. It's light and quenching. Perfect for summer days and nights. I'm glad I picked it up."
"Note: It seems a lot of wheat beers don't get too high of rating, this is my first witbier exploration, so I'm not highly knowledgeable about the style. I graded it more harshly because of the price. I will review again once I try others in this style."
"I've had this on-tap at it was killer. The bottled version doesn't have the same flavor intensity as the draft. Not that the bottle is bad, though better can be had."
"Pours a hazy yellow with a pretty awesome white head. It's got a weird tint to it. The aroma is awesome...lots of spice...coriander, orange peel, and other good citric notes. The flavor is slightly bitter with great, subtle touch of acidity. It's got a high carbonation that fits perfectly. Nice and light feeling. Incredible drinkability"
"D- Drinkability is good due to its good overall taste and thin body. Overall this beer is a great summertime beer, very easy drinking."
"This is probably my least favorite of Ommegang's lineup. Low in alcohol, somewhat high in price IMO. Not getting this one again."
"A 750ml corked and caged bottle shared with psycohops and brothercannon. Poured into a trio of nonic pint glasses. After stirring up the yeast in the bottle, appears a cloudy pale straw yellow color with about an inch of fluffy bone white foam. Smells and tastes of citrus fruits such as lemon and orange, mildly spicy yeast and lightly toasted wheat. This wit is medium bodied and amply carbonated for it's style. Worth a try if you see it around."
"D= Solid but not the best witbier out there. Still, it was enjoyable and I could easily session this one."
"Got a nice citrus smell from the beer and a lemony taste from the beer. This beer is high bodied - very crisp. I found the flavors to be less than bold. Very average but to be fair, this is not my favorite style of beer. I keep getting a lemon aftertaste."
"Kind of disappointed in this effort from Ommegang. They have set the bar so high for themselves, a let down was bound to happen at some point. Not a bad beer by any means, but try Southampton Publick House or Oberon."
"D - A mildly disappointing beer from Ommegang... Is that even possible??? In this case, it is... Seems like a forced example of style..."
"Really nice and easy to drink, great for the warmer weather, not a complex beer, but one to enjoy"
"D - Very drinkable. It's probably not a session brew though. You wouldn't want to drink 6 of these. You'd feel it."
"Pours a cloudy off yellow. Very carbonated with large white head. Head sticks around. Smell is lemony/spice very different from a lot of Wits I have tried. Taste is lemony/spice and quite bitter in a good way, almost tart. It reminds be of lemonade, both in the color and taste. This is definately a different take on this style. But I like it. Very crisp mouthfeel and super drinkible. If your looking for a not so sweet Wit, then this is the one to try."
"As expected for a witbier, it's tasty, refreshing and quite drinkable."
"D - I've had varied experiences with this beer leading me to re-review my original C+ score but still, this bottle is not as strong as some of the other, better Wittes I've had. It definitely needs to be fresh for the best experience I've found. Either way, it's a fine Belgian-style wit with good drinkability."
"Overall - There's better Wits out there, but for the price, it's a good pick. It's got a fairly unique flavor for the style, and I can respect that."
"This a very easy to drink brew. It's like a warm summer afternoon, in a glass. With a hard-to-locate 5.1%ABV, this would be excellent for a summer session brew. Crisp and refreshing."
"Overall: It went well with my burger - not a beer I'd pick up for a night with a six/twelve pack. More of a beer of choice at a cookout/oyster roast - at someone elses house for my girlfriend to drink."
"Looks a bit darker than Wit Biers more like a Hefe. No real smell to it that i find. Taste is great IMO, i really like Belgian Wit Biers (i know this is made in NY) St Bernardus (lil pricey to session) being my fav in front of this. Very smooth as alcohol is low as any Wit (5.1%). Drinkability amazing ill drink it all day and highly recommend Ommegangs Witte."
"D 4.0 - Good drinkable and sessionable Wit at 5.1% ABV. A more mellow clean example with mild spice presence as compared to most."
"Light bodied, crisp and refreshing. Easily drinkable and highly sessionable."
"At the end of the day, it's a very good beer, just not great. A ""second tier"" Witbier but nonetheless serviceable."
"D: I was really impressed with this offering from Ommegang. Although it is one of the most expensive American made versions of this style - mid-$3's for a 12 oz. pour, I certainly plan on purchasing it again because it was so good."
"Poured into Chalice. Poured a clear, bright white, with a small, tight head that quickly dissipated, leaving minimal lacing. A strong skunky aroma that is unexpected for a Wit. After a few moments the more expected Wit aromas, spice & fruit, showed up. The skunk is not as noticeable in the flavor but the typical Wit flavors are not showing up as anticipated. The body is light but well developed, as is expected for the style. Except for the skunk I would have given this a 5 for drinkability. This beer did not have the level of quality I have come to expect from this brewery or of this style. I am quite fond of both the brewery & style so I believe this is a sub-par bottle. I will revisit this beer in the future (I have had it in the past, including at the brewery) and give it another shot. I expect better from Ommegang, so I believe this to be an abberation."
"Pours a cloudy light yellow color, but still translucent. Big white foamy head. Citrus spicy aroma, a light aroma, Belgian. Watery, spicy taste. Some good spice, not too carbonated. A nice refreshing beer, good with pepperoni pizza. Tasty, but a little watery."
"Drinkablity & Notes: A decent brew though not comparable to the many witbiers that outshine this one."
"With that said, there are better wits out there, but this one isn't bad."
"Solid beer - this one is effortlessly drinkable. ."
"This is a decent beer that I'll definitely try again...that is until I can brew it better."
"I must admit I am not a big fan of this style; however this brew is rather boring. No surprises in the nose or taste. I expected much more from this beer considering the brewery. Ommegang produces some terrific beers and I feel this one ranks a grade or two below their regular line-up."
"I would buy this again and am now intrigued to see what else this brewery has to offer."
"Pours a light yellow slightly cloudy with a big three fingers of white fluff that retains like a champ. The nose is sweet and full of earthy wheat and lemon rind. This is a very flavorful Wit, lemony and fruity throughout, with nice attention to crisp clean spiciness that competes with the lemon, but is really an after thought. Light yet full, soft yet assertive, this is delicious and just what a Witbier should be."
"D - A near-perfect witbier. Witte has a little more kick than others of the style, but the complexity is certainly increased. Ommegang has struck a great balance with the spices, wheat, and yeast characteristics."
"Not a bad witbier, but needs some more complexity."
"D- Drinkable, just very bland."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow color. Good 1/2 inch head with good retention and decent lacing. Smells strongly of coriander with some wheat aromas. Fits the style. Smooth, crisp, with high carbonation. A slight amount of hops bitterness is apparent. Tastes of herbs (mostly coriander) with a light wheat background. There's a malt aftertaste that is pleasing because it counteracts the herbs. Overall, not a bad beer, but a little light in body."
"Poured a nice yellow color with a nice fluffy white head that dissipated pretty slowly. Aroma was of citrus fruit and wheat. Flavor was pretty much the same with some spiciness definitely in there with the citrus. The mouthfeel was very pleasant and appropriate for the style. This was a very refresinging beer that I enjoyed. Simple, but good."
"Notes- with this bottle, I have tasted (and reviewed) every offering Brewery Ommegang has to offer in bottle form. This is, in all honesty, the one which I find least impressive, and the one which I will be least likely to buy again. It isn't *bad*, not by a long shot, the flavor is very pleasant, and the whole package fits together well. But it isn't anything special."
"D- really good, maybe i just got a funky bottle but i wouldnt really consider this much of a wibier , more like a pale ale"
"one of my first reviews.. still new to this whole thing, so bear with me on this review... but i def liked this beer. It had a good taste, light lemony wheat flavor. Def reaaly fizzy that left my mouth dry, and wanting more. so all n all i give it two thunbs up.."
"Poured into my stem glass the color of a cloudy Budweiser. Nice head that vanished quickly. Minimal lace. Smell and taste of lemon and clove. Thin with a nice carbonation, a little bite, and a clean finish. A good summer beer, but the down side is that many beers of this type have recently hit the market and there are a lot of good ones for less money. Ommegang brings us a lot of special beers. Witte, though pretty decent, isn't one of them."
"(rated Oct 16, 2007)"
"Notes: This was my first sample of this style. I can understand why Witbiers started taking off recently after having this, since it's a light-bodied, crisp, refreshing beer that is quite drinkable and a great step in the direction of craft beers that won't shock a typical macro-drinker. Not sure they are up my alley, but I'm glad I got the chance to try this."
"Not really too much to say about this one, which makes me hate the 250+ limit. Clear yellow pour with a big white head. Wanted, expected some haze. Pleasant lemon peel and wheat aroma. Same in the flavor with some nice spice and orange peel. The mouthfeel is light, almost velvety without touching your tongue. Good summer refresher."
"Poured a cloudy yellow with , a nice white foamy head. Yeasty aroma of coriander and white pepper. flavor is of orange peel, lemon, coriander with some spiciness. Very easy drinking and enjoyable witbier, and another quality offering from the folks at Ommegang"
"Many good things about this beer not my favorite style."
"I did enjoy this one, has a nice flavor, not overly complex, but overall a pleasant beer. I enjoy wheat beers, and this was a very nice example of one."
"Cheers!!"
"Poured a nice foamy head into a tulip glass, which thinned out rather quickly. Color was a hazy yellow, and lots of lacing and sheeting on the glass as I drink. Had a rather musty, yeasty smell, which I found pleasant enough. Taste was on the airy and delicate side for a wit, with a light yeasty, coriander, and lemon flavor. Maybe a little orange peel in there. I found this very enjoyable to drink and think it would pair well with a lot of light seafood dishes."
"3.5 D: Not too crazy about this one. It has the standard witbier flavors, but not bold enough. I would get bored with this pretty soon."
"Aroma of crisp lemony coriander. Fresh and nice. The foam tips you off to a very bubbly mouthfeel from the bottle conditioning. Flavor has an excellent freshness, the coriander is well done, lacking gassy bitterness. A touch if wheaty tanginess. Very well done witbier."
"Pours a wonderful hazy yellow color. Sweet and soft nose of toasted wheat, sweet banana and clovey spice. Hops play an important role of balancing out the banana sweetness this beer has going on. The finish is grassy and clean. Light medium bodied and very drinkable."
"Good clean fun. Tightly subtle."
"D- Not my favorite in the style but not all that bad. A good though not great witbier."
"Pours a glowing hazed lemon color, medium sized bright white head fades into a thin collar around the beer, minimal lacing. But the bubbles in this beer are putting on a show....tiny bubbles rise slowly and continuously, while bigger bubbles rocket to the top of the beer, breaking the surface in a hypnotic and ever-changing pattern. Cool! Lemony aroma, slightly musty, yeasty, pepper, slight orange. Bright citrus flavors, lemony tartness, slightly grassy, a good dose of peppery spice. Clean mouthfeel, extremely refreshing brew....would be a great summertime beer, paired with all manner of seafood. Really nice beer, something I can see working to turn folks on to craft beer."
"Notes: This is a delicious beer and another great offering from Brewery Ommegang."
"Don't drink and review."
"D: It was a very enjoyable Witbier but a bit of a thin flavor profile. Very sessionable brew."
"Mouthfeel is a bit heavier than I expected for a wit but still in the acceptable range of light-medium. Very very drinkable. Emjoyable but not for this much money. I mean this is something that I would love to have a keg of in my living room but I can't see driving to Bevmo to pay $10 for a 750 ml."
"D: Another solid offering from Ommegang (no surprise there) and a very pleasant Belgian. If you're near Ommegang or a fan of the brewery than by all means try this brewsky. If you're looking for an elite Witbier though, this isn't quite in the league of Southampton Double White."
"The taste is fresh bread, lemon, coriander, orange zest, bananas and cloves. Altogether enjoyably light and mild on the spices for a witbier. Fizzy carbonation with a lingering clove aftertaste."
"750ml corked and caged bottle. Bottle conditioned. served in a shaker pint. Opens with a big pop. First pour is a brilliantly clear pale straw, with a couple of fingers of big bubbled white head. Slightly spicy aroma with a bit of wheaty tang. Light bodied, easy drinking. Spritzy mouthfeel, lots of carbonation. Citrusy flavor with a subdued clove flavor. Not a bad summer beer, but I've had better wits."
"Pours a lighlty hazy pale gold with a large fluffy white head; nice lacing. The nose is of coriander, sweet (almost minty) wheat, minerals and light orange peel. Soft and wheaty with assertive fine carbonation and a touch of sourness at the mildly dry, flinty finish. Mildly sweet wheat and doughy yeast with a light mineral backing, coriander and light orange peel. This is a nice beer. Not overly spiced on either side of the spectrum (coriander or orange peel), it lets the yeast come through better than most Witbiers that I've sampled. For that alone, I find it a compelling interpretation of the style."
"Drinkability: You could drink this like water, but that is both the good and the bad."
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into a large chalice. It pours a hazy yellow, decent head. You can definitely smell the coriander, light hint of citrus. The taste is lightly sweet with hints of citrus and spice. It has a light body and goes down easy. Overall this is a standard wheat beer."
"D - It's easy to drink, and good, especially for the price, but ultimately I'm a bit let down by this one. It's solid, but it really doesn't grab me in any way, shape or form."
"Poured into hefe glass for a light, seethru yellowish gold with mild paleness and a decent sized head and some lace spots. A light, breezy smell of coriander and orange peel. Hints of possible clove along with lemon and other citric fruits. Light to medium bodied, with a crispness that almost crosses into a tart sourness. A good brew, but it is a tad watery and the lemon zest seems to have leak into the beer too much; it overpowers a decent taste of some wheat and spices. I didn't mind sipping on this at all on a warm, about to end summer day; just thought it could've been better."
"This is quite drinkable. Maybe its not the most complex of the Ommegang offerings but it's enjoyable, good for warm days outside and would make a solid gateway beer."
"Mouthfeel is really crisp and very carbonated. Drinkability is pretty high, although this is certainly not the best witbier out there."
"Clear lemon yellow body with a two-finger layer of snow white foam,; solid duration and ample lacing leave me very impressed. Rich nose, a bit yeasty, flush with lemon, pepper, coriander, and a hint of sour apple; easily one of the best smelling Witbiers I've ever encountered. The taste isn't quite up to par with the appearance and smell, but it's good. Sweet and sour citrus, spice, smooth--really tasty. Creamy and smooth mouthfeel with plenty of carbonation in the tank. Highly drinkable, Witte is certainly one of the best Witbiers I've tried, simply delicious and a fine representative of the style--in no way a surprise from Ommegang, one of my very favorite breweries. Don't miss it."
"D: Would be easily drinkable but the wheat is too powerful and really messes with the taste."
"This turned out to be a nice choice for the warm weather. Pours a hazy yellow color with a nice bright white head. The whole beer actually seemed a little bright looking. Mild banana aroma with hints of vanilla. Not a ton of flavor but very smooth and again, nice for the sun (which is out today). A little yeast, some lemon, banana and spices all blended in quite nicely. I'd get it again."
"D - I could seee a four pack dissapearing quickly especially in 90 degree heat like today - a very refreshing, tasty wit. Well made and works well as a lawnmower ale."
"Very drinkable, but it lacks much to really stand out as a witbier. I would even dare say this leans more toward a German hefeweizen than a Belgian White. Thin aroma of wheat and banana with some citrus notes. Gorgeous pour, nice vibrant golden yellow with a light fluffy head and serious carbonation. Mouthfeel is watery. Flavor is average, tastes good but doesn't impress. Overall a rather tasty refreshing brew but not good enough for the cost."
"Very nice summer brew, low abv makes for an enjoyable summer session beer."
"Poured on tap at Waldo Tap room. Elliott poured it into one of their new Sam Adams glass. This beer pours a hazy straw yellow, with lots of suspended yeast. It also comes with a big frothy white head that left sticky lacing down the glass. The aroma is a normal Witte profile with cloves and banana coming through but vanilla also makes a play. The taste is traditional witte with an almost sulfur aftertaste. Odd. This is a very drinkable witte. With a medium body that finishes dry, it just calls out for you to have another."
"Easy to drink, but that's because it's watery and unimposing. A beer that looks and smells better than it drinks."
"This a very thirst-quenching, drinkable brew -- but that is really attributable to the lightness of the beer. Good, but not great."
"Tasty and drinkable. A little pricey for what it is, but very good."
"The beer poured with a hazy gold appearance and a thin head. Aromas were predominately wheaty and bready hops wonderfully enjoyable. Although a bit watery, I did feel that the mouthfeel helped the bitterness of the drink really come out. It was refreshing, but with such a thin texture, those citrus ingredients both were vocal and yet led to its overpowering aspect. Overall, it was decent."
"Pours a nice murky light gold with a medium head. Nice lacing on the surface and sides. Visible carbonation. Aroma is quite spicy- cloves, coriander, and citrusy- oranges and lemons. Taste has a sweet backbone. Spicy- similar to the aroma. Tangy wheat. Bananas. Just a bit of bitterness in the finish. Some yeasty earthiness as well. Medium to full bodied. Quite easily drinkable. A very nice Wit from Ommegang."
"Picked the 750ml bottle up for $5 bucks never having tried anything from the Brewery Ommegang. I gotta say it's a very fine example of a witbier. Extremely drinkable on a hot day like today. The only thing that really suffers is the fact that the head disappears to absolutely nothing midglass. I am looking forward to popping my bottle of Three Philosophers as well."
"Smell is spicy and lemony. Taste has more citrus fruit in it. There is also some dark spices in the flavor. There's plenty of carbonation as well. Very light, easy drinking wit. Refreshing and good."
"pours a really nice cloudy straw. the nose is fairly typical with a slight edge in the citrus notes. crisp yeast was a good way to describe it. the taste is smooth, a little less complex than i expected. slight tartness, citrus and spice flavors. not the most flavorful but extremely refreshing. very drinkable. all in all another great beer from a great brewery."
"Drinkability: A good thrist quencher if enjoyed cold and quickly. A nice change of pace."
"Brewery Ommegang, in the great town of Cooperstown, does a great job producing Belgian style beers. Witte is no exception. Slightly slow pour, as bottle suggests, results in white, cloud-like head. The body is pale yellow with great carbonation. A pleasant citrus aroma (orange and a little lemon) greets the nose. You can pick up some spicy overtones. A very light mouthfeel with a citrusy, wheaty taste. Spices give beer a little bitterness at the end. A nice, dry finish. This beer is quite pleasing."
"Smooth, yet crisp in the mouth. Great beer for summer. Excellent example of the style."
"Good beer, but you know that if you're buying it."
"Drinkability was good. Didn't take long to finish it off. Except the slight metallic taste, it was really good."
"Surprisingly average for a wit."
"Highly refreshing and medium-bodied with excellent drinkability, this is another delicious 'big-bottle' offering from Ommegang, probably available, and underappreciated, at a grocer near YOU!"
"I'm wondering if this one is slightly oxidized due to its age in my cellar, as some of the non-reviewed versions of this beer seemed much better."
"Perhaps I've been spoiled by Ommegang's other rich and fruity offerings, but the Witte was a disappointment: for a wheat beer, this was rather thin, flat and un-wheaty all around. The color is an unexceptional, clear lemon yellow, with a thin head that vanishes quickly. There's a lot of fizz, which is nice on a warm day, but there's very little to note in the taste: a bit of orange and some nice bitterness, but overall it tasted like citrus seltzer water. No body to speak of, either. If you're looking for something to pound on a hot afternoon, this might be your beer. Otherwise, an Allagash White is a better example of an American white beer."
"Drinkability- I think or rather hope that I purchased a bad batch because this was not a good beer experience. It was flat and skunky which makes me believe that this bottle had turned. I bought it at local cigar/beer store that had a very unorganized selection. I saw no born on or freshness date. I am going to have to give this another try and hope that I merely got a bad sample and not its true nature."
"Overall- Not too much going on here. An easy summer chugger but mediocre at best."
"After having a couple bottles of this in the past, felt this was a terrific sixtel to kick off the Summer. But if you don't like tartness in your beer, stay away from this one."
"Pours fairly clear gold with a big frothy head. Aroma primarilly of spice and wheat, with slight notes of citrus and funk. Spice dominates the flavor too, and it finishes clean, like a pislener. Very odd witte. No banana or funk notes in the taste. Tastes more liike Hefeweizen. Not a bad beer, just an odd one from a brewery that usually hits its style."
"Flavors of apple, pear, and sour fruits. The flavor is also muted and almost watered down. Spices very weak, barely there. As it sat it almost seemed to get worse."
"D - I could drink this all day during the summer great taste and refreshing worth trying sometime"
"Pours a very nice hazy pale golden yellow color, very nice carbonation, very nice fizzy/foamy two-finger white head, which leaves some nice sticky lacing behing. The nose is malty, yeasty, good notes of wheat/grass, corinader, bananna, nice touch of caramel. The taste is slightly sweet/bitterness, malty, lots of yeast, spices, with some caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a very nice Witbier."
"Mouthfeel is mostly smooth but there is a slight chalkiness that coats your teeth. There is also a bit of astringency and carbonation bite that keeps it from getting dull. Not bad."
"i served it chilled but it actually developed more character as it sweat the glass, there was a tartness that hung around a while longer for the second half.. its a bit like a date with someone who doesn't really start talking until its just about time to go, and you wish they had a bit earlier because what they are saying is interesting but you really have to go because there was parmesan flakes in the bread crumbs of your chilean sea bass that you bought to be impressive and that lactose just tears you up ... id definitely drink this again though, when i had more time"
"3"" white head with great retention and much lacing. Pale, hazy gold. Lots of carbonation. The nose is clean with fruit and citrus, yeast and pepper. Flavor contains fruit (papaya?, guava?) orange, wheat, hint of clove, perfumey yeast...finishes slightly sweet. Medium body, plenty of carbonation and a soft mouthfeel. Very drinkable."
"D- initially, i was kinda down on this one due to its dissimilarities to other whites i've tried, but in the end, ""she's her own person"" and i kinda like the fact that all the spices take the back burner and leave it all up to the main ingredient. as for drinkability, this is it. this is the beer i would reach for in the morning if i had no water to drink. plus with the low abv, i'll be drinkin the other three by the grill tonight."
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a hazy pale straw color with a nice fluffy pure white head which did not leave much lacing. The aroma is of wheat malt, tart lemon, light champagne and light spice. The taste is heavy on the tart lemon, with orange peel and some earthy spices following. Not much of a hit on the corriander, which is typically found in the witbiers. Some noticable champagne characteristics as well. The feel is fairly light and well carbonated, finishes a bit tart but very refreshing. Ommegang misses the mark on the witte flavor-wise but produced a damn refreshing brew. Nice and light with a tart lemon twang that will satisfy over the summer."
"Pours a true yellow color, with a pure white foamy head. Smell is very typical, with wheat/coriander/hotdog nose. A little creamy side to start it off, with good balance of carbonation. Very slight tartness with a refreshing flip to the tart. Good side of dry lemon peel, white flowers and a slight bit of soft mushrooms. I can appreciate it, drinkable. Also, if you think of a buttery chardonnay- think of this as that kind of butter"
"D: Very drinkable. Nice light, refreshing beer. Nothing spectacular though...try the other Ommegang brews for something to talk about."
"Light-bodied, smooth and soft on the tongue. Refreshingly quenching. Crafted for summer session drinking."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, lots of prickly carbonation."
"D: Ok drinkability, but mostly because the mouthfeel makes up for the average taste. Definitely worth a go if you come across it."
"A nice, light alternative to Duvel"
"The tart lemon zest flavor comes out initially, followed by corriander and wheat. Other citrus fruits like oranges are present as well. There's a distinct sweetness in the finish. Mouthfeel is crisp and carbonated. A nice, refreshing witbier."
"Definitely a good beer and well worth the money. Ommegang has yet to let me down. Definitely a good choice for the summer. Citrusy and not heavy but still flavorful."
"Drinkability is also perfect. I think I could drink this for the rest of my life. While it didn't blow me away like houblon chouffe, it is just such a solid, well crafted beer and in a style that I really like. Highly recommended."
"D: Easy drinking beer with more flavor than most American versions."
"D- Very drinkable. The balance of flavor and mouthfeel is what makes this one a treat."
"pours a very bubbly light golden color with a nice slight cloudiness to it, and a big white head. smell is good, has a tiny skunkiness to it, smells kinda champagne. taste is good, the bubbles are crazy in my mouth. doesn't taste like alot of hefe's but it is a good beer. of course you really can't go wrong from any brewery ommegang"
"Poured into a Duvel tulip. Just about the same golden color as the label. Huge white head that leaves gobs of lacing. Smells citrusy with rindy lemon and orange. Lots of spice too. Flavor is heavily spiced as per the norm with Ommegang beers. Lots of coriander and some clove dance atop tart citrus. Refreshing mouthfeel and high drinkability."
"Cloudy yellow color with a solid white head. Opaque, as it should be. Nose is nice, lots of wheat and coriander. Taste is likewise, although fairly mild. I know witbiers are supposed to have high ""crispy"" carbonation, but this one's just too high for me...takes away from the flavor because the fizz is just biting your mouth and tongue a little too much for me. Overall, not a bad one, but nothing too exciting either."
"D: Refreshing for sure... nothing fancy here, just a solid witbier... spring is almost here... stock up on your witbiers!!"
"D: Refreshing and good example of the style which i though was a regular until i actually read the label(ha ha)"
"M/D- Tart.. yet not as dry of a finish as I expect from a belgian wit. This is a very drinkable brew... especially considering the low abv... however, the price does not match the quality in terms of wits."
"M&D: There is no linger bitterness that I have observed in some other Witbiers that I have sampled. This one is smooth and clean, with a rather light carbonation. Although the mouthfeel is light, I can see this being an enjoyable session brew. Quite good overall."
"A bit fuller than I like for the style. Still, a fair amount of carbonation. Refreshing and easy to drink. Now, bring on the warm weather."
"Drinkability: I'm sure there are foods this would go well with - very light fish, or vegetables - and certain locales where it would be appropriate - perhaps the beach scene mentioned on the side of the bottle - but it really didn't impress me. It was crisp and refreshing, though, and the alcohol is low enough (5.1% abv) to where I can perhaps envision enjoying this beer somewhere, some other time. It became somewhat trying for me to finish my glass, however."
"Very drinkable. Smooth in flavor, scent and appearance. Another tasty beer from Ommegang."
"I recomend this beer, its a lot like blue moon :)"
"This is a very drinkable beer but not noteworthy. It pours clean with only a slight head that soon clears. The beer is very crisp due to it's heavy carbonation. Aftertaste of citrus and green apples lasts quite long (it's still present 5 minutes after my glass was empty). I would recommend this be consumed without any food pairings (any food would overpower the flavor of this beer)."
"Overall, this is a drinkable beer, but there are other witbiers that do a better job."
"D - Very easy drinking beer."
"Overall this beer was decent, but the different flavors at odd with each other and the residue on the palate well after finishing are its downfall."
"Could I drink this beer all day? Abso-frikin-lutely. An absolutely delicious witbier, it's more toned down than Hoeegarden and Allagash Wit, yet is flavorful enough to keep your mind constantly engaged on the fact that you're not drinking just another run of the mill beer. It's a little too smooth; in the summer, especially when it's hot it's possible to see this beer lacking the crispiness to be refreshing. That hurts the drinkability in the long run, because after awhile the fruit/sweet/lushness of the beer could get boring, or at least something that could prove to be a problem. I don't think this is a beer you could sit on the beach all day and drink- it IS a beer that I would kick back with at the end of the day, but this is not a beer that could be drank all day. But, if it's below summer temps, than this is a beer that you can pound two or three 750's of and feel very good about. But all and all, for a wit, a style that does not leave a lot of room to do a lot with (have a Hoeegarden and an Allagash Wit in the same, unmarked glass and try to tell the difference between them), it's a good effort and a solid benchmark in the Ommegang lineup. If Ommegang were the late 90's Bulls, this would be the Ron Harper. It'll never be their best offering, and you would never pick it over MJ or Scotty Pippen (Abbey Ale and Three Philosophers respectively) but it is a beer that can hold it's own, play solid defense and maybe drain a mid-range jumper or two. End crappy sports analogy. Solid offering none the less."
"Poured a clean straw yellow with a frothy white head on it. Aroma was fairly clean, with some hints of the coriander and citrus in it. Taste was decent, but seemed to me to lack the depth I've found in other witbiers. The coriander and citrus that were in the aroma weren't strongly present in the taste for me. The mouthfeel was light, and the carbonation seemed to be lighter than I'm used to. The aftertaste wasn't strong, and seemed to have a slight citrus tart taste to it. Overall, a decent witbier just not one of my favorites."
"D: Although I thought the taste wasn't great, it is a highly drinkable beer. An OK representation of the style overall, but not outstanding."
"After searching high and low for this beer, was glad to be able to cop a single 12oz bottle from wine and more in Union...Heard a lot about this company and their propensity to replicate authentic Belgium Brews...Their witbier was a good sample but not above and beyond...Although there are certainly better examples of the style out there, this is a good enough impression to warrant a try...Pours a very hazy and cloudy yellow appearance with minimal head...Smell was somewhat bland...Taste was citrusy with obvious lemon and coriander notes present...Mouthfeel was good as was drinkability...Overall a decent sample worth a try."
"Not a bad example of the style but not quite true either."
"The mouthfeel is not as slick as some exceptional Wits and the carbonation is a tad high. Nice little beer. Allagash's White is much better."
"Got this brew in the Ommegang mix pack and have had this one numerous times in the past but just never reviewed it. So this one was poured from a 12 oz. Bottle. Has the color of straw and is hazzy with a nice sized white head that has slight retention but does leave lacing around the top of the glass. The aroma is refreshing, nice spice, lemon, coriander, and wheat aromas. The flavors are very nice with this brew, nice prickly spiciness which is a welcoming sensation. Nice fruit flavors of lemon and maybe orange come through. Has a sweet but creamy feel. This is a very good brew and one that I could see going with a wide range of food types. Even though to me it is a summer beer based on style, I could drink this one year around. Solid offering."
"I'd recommend it."
"This beer poured a golden straw color with a light fluffy two-finger head. The smell a little subtle with some characteristic wheat beer citrusy and slightly yeasty hints. The taste is very pleasant with a citrusy sweetness and a little bit of tartness that almost reminds me of a cider This beer is extremely drinkable an I could imagine reaching for it over and over again. I'll definitely be picking this beer up again sometime in the summer, it's very refreshing."
"Very light straw cloudy with an airy white head. Lemon rind, soft sour wheat, straw. slightly grassy, faint apple, and some yeasty twang. Acidic citrus is tongue tingling, lemon and lime rind, dry, and pithy. Dry grains and the wheat character is rather mild. Medium to high carbonation crisp with little fizz at the end. Very clean finish and corn sugar sweetness. Overall very refreshing and pretty drinkable but also kind of one-dimensional and boring."
"Drinkability: A refreshing, good example of this style. In my mind the only improvements would be to add either the sourness from lactic acid fermentation or increase the complexity through a spicier yeast strain. Overall, very enjoyable and a bottle or two with friends while grilling seems like a good time. (4.0)"
"Drikability: I really enjoyed this beer and it would make a great session beer. However, I have to admit I was expecing a bit more."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a cloudy pale gold with an inch frothy white head. Lacing and head retention are both decent. It smells like orange, wheat, lemon peel, and coriander. Taste is citrusy and spicy with a slight tart finish. Mouthfeel is light/medium, and has a moderate amount of carbonation which works for this beer very well. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and refreshing. I could easily drink a few of these at a time. I think this is a good overall witbier, although I'd probably be more likely to drink this on a hot summer day."
"Final thoughts  I was expecting more out of this brew. There are much better options for the price."
"Closing down September on the deck with this one...lemon zest and spicy crispness...a fresh breeze in the bottle...soft yellow body with a bit of effervescence; thick, consistent head in a Hoegaarden tumbler....smooth palate with a slight drag along the tongue's sides....balanced yeast and malt...a dry yet developed taste...elusive lemon hints....crisp and refreshing...is there a better summer witte? a few, I'm sure, but these New Yorkers didn't travel to Belgium for nothing..."
"taste is spot on for the style. I must admit though that the I gnerally prefer the I gnerally prefer the stronger and bolder flavors of heffeweizen to the witte."
"Poured into a pint glass from a bottle. The beer pours a very light hazy straw, forming a massive three fingers of head which fades to a creamy 1 inch head. Medium spots of lace cling all the way down the glass.The aroma is strong wheat and fruit along with what smells like a hint of Belgian sugar and spices. Very inviting. Tha taste takes it a step further, adding orange and sweet candy sugar to the mix of wheat, lemon flavor, and spices. Complex and full. Medium smooth mouthfeel. Low abv., full flavor, and east drinkability make for an exceptional session ale. This is easily my favorite wheat ale. This, IMO, packs alot more complex flavor to this brew than in other wheat ales available. Highly recommended!!"
"Poured into a pilsner glass, which yielded an ample and fluffy white head with a mild smell of lemon and yeast. Presented with a beautiful yellow-gold color. While lacing was present during the sample, very little adhered to the glass during the tasting. Mild and smooth mouthfeel with just enough carbonation to give a pleasant bite to the tongue. Flavor was consistent with the smell; lemons and yeast. A very simple and satisfying witte; highly drinkable, but just seemed to lack some of the complexity of other witte beers that I have tried recently."
"A good, tasty, easily drinkable rendition."
"This beer pours a liquid gold, with a big, white fluffy head, the trademark of a good hefe. Smell was of banana and citrus notes and mild effervescence tickled the nostrils. Taste was well-rounded and slightly sweet. Noticed more banana esters and light, wheaty sweetness. Dissipates quickly on the palate and leaves you yearning for more. Good beer. Will definitely finish off the remainder of the six pack soon."
"Ommegang Witte pours a cloudy yellow with a half inch of lingering head. The aroma is earthy yeast and some light pale and wheat malts. The flavor is a crisp light maltiness with very little spice flavor. There are hints of corriander and citrus, but just a tiny bit. Very refreshing, but not my favorite of the style. A freshness date would be nice in case I have an old bottle."
"750 corked bottle. Pours a cloudy, hazy gold with a small white head. Aroma is not real powerful, wheat, spices and some slight citrus notes. Flavor is not powerful either, coriander and orange in the background. Overall not a bad beer, but there are better Wits out there."
"have to call this one an up-classed tighter Hoegaarden."
"Beautiful 750ml. bottle poured into a pint glass. Smelled God awful. Smelled noticeably skunked or just way too pungent on the spices. The taste was amazing though, despite the smell. The taste was subtle coriander, citrus hints, possibly orange peels, light hops, and sweet malts. The mouthfeel was light and very crisp. I could easily down more in terms of ease of consumption, but I didn't love the flavor. Overall: great if you love the witbier category, but I think I might've had one too many over the past few weeks."
"Pours nice and hazy, with a good deal of yeast and sediment present in the glass. Nice foamy head, slight citrus smell. Has a very crisp taste behind a some malty background. Well balanced due to it's high yeast content- makes you pucker just enough to know that it's a true Witbier."
"D- This is a great witbier. Classic taste of a witbier with the mouthfeel of a good hefe. This is a great light session ale. I wish this style got more credit around here. Unfortunately, I spilled half of my glass and I only had a 12 oz. bottle. This is definitely something I will have again. My second offering from Ommegang. I have rare vos, three philosophers, ommegeddon, and ommegang abbey waiting in my house and I can't wait to try these ones too!"
"It's not a bad beer, just perhaps needs a tweak of recipe. It wasn't quite what I expected - it's not that I was disappointed by the Witte, just underwhelmed."
"great witte."
"D - Very drinkable, even an entire 750ml bottle."
"Pours a one-finger white head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Clear pale amber color. Lemon nose. Good carbonation and light-medium bodied. Flavor is Lemon and yeasty. tart finish. 750ml bottle $5.99 from Capitol Convenience Concord, NH."
"A cloudy light amber yellow with a decent head. Aroma is not strong, wheaty, plenty of lemon tone (but that may have come from the lemon provided with my drink). Flavor is typically wheaty and malty, with a strong citrus overtone and just a hint of bitterness. A nice smooth wheat ale."
"D: A very good American witbier. Great for summer - cool, crisp, and easy to drink."
"Pretty decent witbier. Good flavors but just a little light for my tastes. Still an all around good witbier though."
"Poured from 750 mL bottle. Golden straw in color, hazy, with average size head, didnt stick around for too long. Smells of sour citrus and some bread like qualities. Taste is good, fruit is present but it has a very sour note to it, high carbonation also is distracting somewhat. Very crisp, leaves a very dry sensation in the mouth which keeps me coming back for more. Overall a pretty good beer, not being a huge fan of this style I thought this was probably the best example I've had yet. Something, I dont know what though, keeps me from saying this is a great beer."
"Refreshing beer good for summer goes down nice. Dry,tangy and good spicyness makes for a nice drinkability. Would like to try this one again."
"Drinkability - A great witbier. I would drink another."
"Notes: Went very well with a sushi-type dinner (rolls, shrimp shumai), as it was light in body, with a lemony taste that went well with the fish. Enjoyable on a summer day."
"I was actually quite impressed with this beer. This had the most beer-feel to it of any of the wit's I have tasted. The head was large but not too creamy in an all malt sense. Mouthfeel and Drinkablity were excellent, a bit heavier in body but easier to swallow without all the normal creaminess. The only flaw I found in the taste and smell was the lack of dark fruit smell to them. The spicing was on par with the coriander, but also maybe a bit more orange peel would have made it a bit better for the style."
"D: Easy drinking, enjoyable beer. Share a big bottle with a friend on a hot summer day."
"Drinkability is good enjoyable, great for quenching this hot sticky weather."
"Nice and drinkable."
"Pours an ultra pale straw, with exceptional clarity before the yeast pour. Dense soap-bubble head reaches two fingers and holds well leaving spotty lacing. Weak nose, some faint wheat, and traces of spice or Belgian yeast notes. Smack of pale malt sweetness upfront, followed by sharp Pils malt and rich flaked wheat. Earthy yeast and some very subtle and indiscriminate spice help dry the aftertaste with some snappy and tart phenols. This pairs nicely with a mild noble hop flavor and bitterness that is slightly floral and somewhat spicy but provides and excellent balancing background. The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing if nothing else; highly carbonated and light in body but retaining some silky texture from the wheat and susended yeast. Finish is mild and beckons another glass, but a bit dry as the bland spice flavor becomes more pronounced. Still, a few flaws aside, this is a great summertime quencher with a traditional witbier character."
"Not exactly spectacular, but a good example of the style, highly refreshing and drinkable."
"Pours a hazed golden/yellow, medium sized white head forms, leaves some lace spots, good retention, nice and bubbly. Smell is sweet, some fruits, spices, yeast, citrus, bit of banana, nice. Taste is banana and wheat, spicy yeast, bread, light fruitiness, nice. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. Not usually a big fan of wit's but this one was quite nice, very refreshing! Thanks Jan!"
"Overall, it's a great summer. However, I certainly wouldn't mind if they cranked up the flavour to become a little more pronounced."
"Pours a super cloudy dirty straw color with dense perfectly white head. In the nose, I get a classic wheaty Ommegang aroma. Lots of spicy esters in this one, some orange and coriander. A little bit of buttery diacetyl present. Flavor wise it's almost like an orangy creamsicle. The mouthfeel is oh so creamy with a wonderful carbonation. It is probably the smoothest beer I've ever had. However, the complexity is certainly lacking. The spices are kept well in check which is nice, but I'm missing a lot of esters in the flavor, no banana or clove. I imagine it is due to yeast strain and/or ferm. temp. But, I just wish it had some more going on for it. In the end, this is a most quaffable summer beer, and I'm glad I get to linger over it for 750mL!"
"Spicy, mostly clean, light, and refreshing. This will couple nicely with most dishes, and is perfect for the deck. Balanced, and well crafted. Recommended for sure."
"Poured into my weizen glass from a bomber. Hazy yellow, with pink accents. Dense fluffy head reduces to a small cap. Moderate lacing. Sweet lemon malt in the nose. Some spice. Taste is again sweet malts, yeast, and citrus. A bit bland. Mouthfeel is very crisp and dry, very quenching. This redeems the bland taste. I would enjoy this beer en masse on a hot summers day out on the patio."
"Well, in the taste category, it falls short. Yes, I understand it's a light wheat ale. That said, I was underwhelmed by the lack of flavor, very little hops, very little malt, mild citrus. I was drinking this ""thirst quenching"" beer outside in 90 degree heat while cooking on the grill. The beer seemed to fit the moment perfectly, but just didn't deliver in taste, mouthfeel, or drinkability. I considered not finishing the bottle, but that would certainly be a waste of beer."
"This brew pours a cloudy pale orange color with a billowy white head. Lacing is thorough, and last until the beer is gone. The aroma is of orange peel, coriander, and wheat. The taste is like the aroma, but not as pronounced. The mouthfeel is a little lighter than medium bodied, and a tad too light for my liking in a witbier. Overall, this is a decent wit, but I had expected more from a brewery that specializes in Belgian styles."
"A very nice Witbier, not overly complex, and nicely spiced. I did like how it finished uphill growing drier & spicier but still finishing clean, but not thin or watery. Not the best Witbier I've ever had, but a very good one. Would be great with anything light & spicy for summer fare (seafood, white meats, even an aggressive salad) or just by itself. Check it out."
"Big white head that sits perfectly over a hazy yellow golden colour. Good lacing. A lemony/ginger aroma - very on par for a wit. Notes of wheat and malt come through too. Gentle notes of absent bu are largely absent. The yeast is very distinct with a true 'Belgian' character and imparts a lot of 'lemony zest' to the taste. Flavours of orange peel as well. Another very nice, well enjoyed, Ommegang offering."
"the taste was very mild so that could make it drinkable but if you're looking for flavor then it isn't that drinkable. haha"
"D - Meh. I guess I'm not a whit kinda guy. Nothing wrong with this beer, just not my style. Better then some whits I've had actually."
"drinkability is good. well balanced and tastes great."
"Pours a cloudy, light yellow with a delicate white head that fades to a collar. For some reason the appearance says ""lemon."" The nose has notes of lemon juice and vanilla-coconut with just a hint of the usual spices, and some warm spice notes that aren't usually found in a witbier (unfortunately, I'm not enough of a spice scholar to ID them individually). On the palate, the coconut really comes out toward the front, but the finish is all lemon/bready malts. The middle is a bit muddled and shapeless, which detracts quite a bit from the overall experience. Mouthfeel is as expected: some delicate acidity but not astringency and big carbonation that keeps things creamy but light. Overall, a very decent witbier."
"Poured from a 750 ml corked and caged bottle into my DT glass. No dating system but they just reentered the market so should be fresh. It has a slightly hazy golden color with a initial burst of carb. Had a small head that quickly went away. The smell was sweet malt with some lemon but not much coriander as I'd expected. The taste was good. It's not great like Hoegaarden but very drinkable. Had a nice solid taste from front to back with good carby mouthfeel. I'd strongly recommend this one as a good example of the 2nd tier of the style. (4, RR, T, Y)"
"Overall, Ommegang's Witte is a solid beer, but there are better alternatives for a Witbier."
"A great take on a witte, and another great one from Ommegang, this one is another new favorite. Ommegang once again twists my arm to stock up on their competitively priced Belgian style ales. Highly recommended."
"Recommended!"
"A little too watery in the mouth. Not bad really, but not something I would seek out either. I expected better from Ommegang."
"Smells are spicy, clean and appealing. Taste is slightly sweet, good spiciness coming through with orange and some fruit notes. Definitely very drinkable and refreshing. I enjoyed this beer a lot. I think it's a step up from hoegaarden and will drink again."
"Drinkability is excellent. Need more."
"Pours out a cloudy pulpless lemonade with loads of carbonation in the body, a thick, creamy head that lasts and lasts, and excellent cheet-like lacing that is raised off of the glass. Aroma is pretty weak, but has the requisite unmalted wheat, malted pale malts, coriander and citrus. Not much character from the yeast itself, though. Flavor is solid, with a nice presence of bready malts in contrast to the wheat. Lots of citrusy sweet in the middle with subdued coriander and yeast. Finishes dry, a bit herbal, and tart. Body is light, with a little extra body given by the yeast and a good deal of carbonation. This one offers up a good deal of flavor and a refreshing tartness that keeps me drinking. Not the most interesting wit, and I'm sure I'd go for a Troublette or Blanche de Chambly more often than I would this, but this is a fine example overall."
"Cloudy yellow-gold color, with a smallish head that fades quickly. Pleasant aroma of wheat with a light spiciness. Lots of flavor: spicy, herbal flavor that blends yeast and hop tastes (flowery, fruity, herbal-dill taste, supplemented by noticicle coriander), a lot of wheat, with a tart, citrusy aftertaste. Body is highly carbonated, with a powdery texture."
"d - easily drinkable and a nice beer for a hot day. there are better witbiers out there but i'm glad we finally have the opportunity to purchase this in alabama."
"Poured from a bomber. Pale clouded yellow with an OK head. Smell is kind of rough - a bready sweet yeastiness, like dough. Not picking up any spicing in the smell, nor in the taste. Very yeasty sweet, a veritable yeast infection you might say. Mouthfeel is OK. Medium bodied, good level of carbonation. Drinkability would be good if only it tasted good. With the wide amount of Wittes available to me, I see no reason to bother with this one again."
"Not a bad white beer, although I feel I have had better. Still, it's recommended for a try as it's a good interpretation of a Belgian style from an American brewery."
"Crisp and very oily in my opinion. A slighty tartness that lasts the whole drink, and a strong wheat and malts flavor. Very yeasty with orange and coriander. Not much to the spices. The medium body and tartness really make this drink one sided and not very enjoyable. With flavors trying to compete for the front it didn't meld very well. I think I'll pass next time I see this one."
"Poured this large beer from the bottle to a tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was hazy from the bottom sediment that the brewer sates not to get in your glass. I thought that was wierd. The beer had a pretty head at first but it soon faded. The taste and smell was slightly sour which I'm sorry but I just do not like any sour in my beer. Slightly fruity also which I aint keen on. I will not buy again."
"As per Garrett Oliver's suggestion at GABF, I paired this beer with a goat cheese and green apple omelette. Twas a delicious pairing that tamed the funky goat cheese and brought out the spiciness of the beer."
"IMO, this is the best witbier from a U.S. brewer that I've tried, and it holds its own against its Belgian brothers. With just enough complexity to keep it interesting, it's still a lightly refreshing and easy drinking beer. I think I might just go back to the liquor store where I found it and buy-out their entire inventory."
"Overall a decent wit, certainly not the most flavorful however."
"M&D - so smooth, especially for a spiced beer, light body, but not to the point of being a hindrance, highly drinkable, man Ommegang makes me feel like i have a bit of Belgium here in the states"
"A nice, somewhat delicate wit, but the flavors were just too slight. It smelled of sour grains, more reminiscent of a hefe than a wit really. The flavor was a bit bland with a bit of spice, vanilla, and grain. Overall a nice beer, but overrpriced for what you get."
"D: This beer is almost too drinkable. I think after a couple of these, I'd ask the bartender for something stronger, and more flavorful but that's just me."
"Into a weizen glass, pours a light yellow gold, clear and almost colorless, with a big bubbly head, pretty long lasting. Nose has nice wheat notes, coriander, generic citris rind, mildly spicy, decent. Taste has stonger citrus notes, lemon and orange, apple, tart, nice leveling wheat malt, but a really nice pattering of spices here, coriander and orange peel used to good effect. Mouth is lively, lots of lightening carbonation, but a solid body too. Overall, a well crafted beer to be sure, an excellent beer for the summer."
"This beer pours sandy yellow and very hazy, head retention is moderate with some thin lacing that webs glass nicely. The Aroma is of earthy wheat, fruity coriander, tart lemon, and possibly orange rind. The taste is slightly tart, fresh lemon comes through the solid wheat malt flavor and carries orange peel and coriander with it. This beer is medium bodied, crisp, and a pleasure to the palate. Ive had bigger Wits but I always seem to come back to this one, its a great thirst quencher and Im always looking for the next one halfway through the first."
"DA: This is easily one of th best White's, witte's...whatever I've had. Easily drinkable-all day."
"Well done Belgian style witbier. Very drinkable."
"Aggressive carbonation hides the already subtle flavors in this beer. It needs to either have subtler carbonation of more aggressive spicy Belgian yeast character. Overall a fantastically drinkable beer. If their goal was to make a flavorful offering for novice beer appreciators, then they succeeded with flying colors. As a wit, it falls a bit flat,"
"Slainte!"
"Very tasty wit. I have had others that kinda get boring after awhile, but I think this is one I could drink all night, and at 5%, wouldn't kill me!"
"Had this on tap and really enjoyed it.The pour was a hazy golden color with a small white head.In the smell you could definetly get the citrus and yeast and it is great.The taste were also of citrus and malt as well as bannana.I also had this in the 750 ml bottle and most definetly liked it on tap much better.This is another winner from Ommegang."
"Adam"
"D- Most witbiers aren't too flavorful which makes me not want to enjoy them all night. This is different. I could drink this all night if I was feeling mild and mellow."
"I've been a little harsh-- Ommegang Witte is not a bad beer by any stretch of the imagination. It is average, maybe slightly above average, for the style. If you can get it cheap or you live next to the brewery in Cooperstown, then go nuts. Otherwise, it's just not worth the price."
"Gold hazy color  off white medium head nose of yeast , sourdough bread, and spices - taste of acidic chardonnay , oakie , yeast, lemon peel , grapefruit , and green apple  medium champagne body  aftertaste some sour red fruit , raspberries , slightly bitter , and acidic"
"12 oz bottle found at Florian's in Auburn... Light yellow murky body with a couple fingers of white head. Smells yeasty and spicy with some malt. Tastes very citrusy with some yeast and malt present. Light to medium body. Very tasty. Not as spicy as some witbiers, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. One of the better Wits I've had definitely. Ommegan has never dissappointed me before, and now is no exception. Great beer!"
"Overall, it's decent enough, but nothing about it made it particularly memorable. A bit disappointing."
"Beer poured a golden color with a nice fluffy white head that is sustaining quite well. Nose is a pleasant boquet of light spices and orange peel. Taste is predominated by spices and wheat and the finish is slightly bitter orange peel. Mouthfeel is lively as this is well carbonated. Drinkability is pretty good. This is a beer that is refreshing and worthy of a try."
"very light yellow. white head. plain sour malt odor. not much flavor, very light slightly sour smooth malt. a little biscuity. ok mouthfeel. very thin. not all that great overall....its too....wispy....or something. it kind of seems like Ommegang was too scared to give this beer a good solid flavor so they watered it down and thinned it out. not my favorite witte by a long shot."
"Poured from 750ml corked bottle, this beer came out a nice golden yellow, with great haze. It gave a fairly light head, with mild retention, but excellent lacing. Carbonation evident in both appearance and mouthfeel, but not too overpowering. Smell was mild, with nice yeast and spice aromas. Taste very nice, mild yeast and spice, with some fruity undertones. Mouthfeel was very nice, light and crisp, with a good carbonation and very smooth finish. Very nice witte, very drinkable."
"Not my favorite witbier, and not my favorite Ommegang beer, but this is solid, drinkable, and I usually have some on hand."
"A very slightly hazy yellow with a thin white head. Nose is full of yeast and sweet green apple. Taste is mild and yeasty, with a hint of spiciness and a tiny ethanol finish. Not bad, just not too exciting. Mouthfeel is nice, very carbonated yet it manages to be pretty smooth, which helps out the drinkability. Nothing offensive about this beer."
"Poured into my new Blanche De Chambly glass, raises a one finger white head over a slightly hazy yellow-gold body. The nose is lightly wheaty and peppery. The final yeast pour intensifies the aroma, and adds a bit of sulpher. Taste is light wheat, with coriander touching the tongue a little, and bready. Has a pretty light mouth feel, with high carbonation. Smooths and thickens with yeast addition. A refreshing and easy beer."
"While this was not a sensational beer by any means, I find it quite enjoyable to complement barbequed food. Not something I would buy often, but nice for a picnic or dinner on the grill."
"A good beer all around, and one that is enjoyable, but there are better Wit's out there. Even among the American versions of this beer, this just doesn't quite do it for me. Perhaps I'm a little skewed from having a Whirlwind earlier this week, but this one just doesn't compare. Good beer, but I'd look for a few other examples first."
"Drinkability: Purchased for around $5 for the bottle, and in my opinion one of the better domestics (though I suppose with the true Belgian thing Ommegang has going on, can this really be a domestic?) out there. A bottle serves well for the wave goodbye to the imminent end of summer."
"O - refreshing with a tart finish, would like some more sweet orange."
"Ommegang Witte pours a golden color with a fluffy white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is on the spicy side, coriander is noticeable. Very light in body and taste, coriander being quite noticeable in the flavor. Not bad, but not the most flavorful wit I've had. Worth a try."
"D- refreshing, i'll take this over a gatorade any day( i know thats not really a bright idea), this is the only witbier i've came across that i'd be interested in drinking without needing refreshment. I will have another."
"Pours a cloudy, light golden. Thin fizzy head, no retention, and not much lacing. Smell is weak. Faint hints of wheat, and spice.Body is thin, and carbonated. Taste is of sweet citrus up fromt.Creamy, with a bit of lemon spice gives it a nice finish. Very nice."
"The first look didn't deceive; the carbonation is crisp & refreshing. However, there is a slightly unpleasant feeling left on the tongue, almost like the chalky feeling after taking a Tums. This strikes me as just an OK beer (granted, it isn't one of my favorite styles) but is certainly worth a try. I have had this on tap & enjoy it significantly more from that source."
"This poured into a weisse type glass; brilliant cloudy maize color with a terrific merengue head; the taste was crisp and definitely non-malted; clear pouring wheatiness. There was definitely some coriander and some real nice salt flavor in there. There was a touch of orange peel noticeable but more so as the brew warmed. If you want a truly aged and liquor-like witbeer, this does not hold up to the complexity. But for overall summer drinking with a purpose;- it terric, and its a terrific and substantial savings over the Belgian equivalent."
"A good beer from a great brewery."
"Very pale straw, tiny bit hazy (before yeast pour), huge rocky head. Lightly toasted grains with faint wheatiness. Soft entry, lemony tart initially with some orange then wheaty dustiness and downplayed supporting bitterness. A bit drying through the finish with coriander perking up. Very balanced. Light bodied with moderate carbonation, I'd like a little more spritz. Good."
"Cheers!"
"I give it high marks on both mouthfeel and drinkability. And no lemon for me in my wheat beers."
"D: Drinkable Wit. Ommegang does there stuff very well. I bet this guy in a 25oz'er with a cork is a bit better than a capped 12'er. Glad I got to visit the brewery and pick a sixer up. Definately a cool place to for an afternoon."
" Yes, summer beers tend to be lighter and are rated as a group, lower than the stouts and porters of winter. Make no mistake though, this is excellent for this time of the year and makes a wonderful session offering. Ommegang's other brews tend to be more acquired, but this would be a great introduction for the novice craft beer drinker. Shame that this bottle isn't endless, unlike it's flavor, and the summer that I'm enjoying them during..."
"I would definitely recommend this as a far superior alternative for my Corona and lemon-soaked hefeweizen swilling friends."
"Suffice to say, I'm a fan of the Witte."
"Drinkability - this is good, goes down easy. Very sessionable."
"Medium-light orangish-gold with a large, white, pillowy head. Smell is of moderate wheat and yeast with some spice and citrus notes and a little sweetness. Taste follows suit, with nothing really sticking out as a dominant flavor. It has a light body, slightly creamy texture and has a lively carbonation that surprisingly did not detract from the mouthfeel. This beer is fairly tame, especially compared to the other beers Ive had from Ommegang. However, while being mild for a witbier, it also has very good balance. This 750ml bottle went down without a hint of a fight. Worth trying."
"750 mL corked bottle poured into a weizen glass. Just slightly cloudy pale gold with a bright white head (but nicely cloudy once you get to the bottom of the bottle), 1-finger with sticky lacing. Banana wheat aroma with a healthy amount of clove spice and a hint of yeast. Moderate carbonation in a medium but fluffy body, with an easy going mellow wheat and sweet citrus, a bit of lemon zest, and the prevoously-detected spice seemingly subdued by the more dominant flavors. The distinct Ommegang yeast is in there, too. Goes down smooth, a little tart, with a nice dry pull in the back. Very easy-going, nice texture, no problem putting the bottle away, but the flavor profile is lacking. Session beer, summer beer, or gateway beer, it has its niches and would keep them solidly."
"Although I had this beer 3 or 4 years ago when it made it debute at Monk's Cafe, I didn't think to review it until I had it over the Memorial Day weekend. 12 oz bottle, poured into a generic glass but the same glass that Witte is usually served with. The beer poured a light golden color, a bit cloudy and with a nice thick white head. The carbonation is very active in this beer. The aroma is of lemons and corriander. The taste is very refreshing. Citrus from the lemon, a bit of orrange and corriander and some notes of banana. This is a perfect summer drink as the body is medium and the taste is just right."
"I think this is a good summer beer, not a great one, and most definitely a good beer to initiate a possible non-craft beer drinker into your ""fold""."
"I haven't had a whole lot of witbiers but this seems to be one of the best I've tried. Very soft and fluffy - ""crafted for summer session drinking""."
"Could be an ultimate hot mid-summer day beer. I'll have to try my next one outside."
"Smooth crisp beer that tingles the tongue and spices up the palate. Another great offering from Ommegang."
"Overall-WOW, other breweries need to take notes this is a fantastic version of a Witte straight out of Belgium, so much better than any other I've tried, fantastic job."
"Experienced this one paired with gabe's prosciutto with melon salsa on toasted french bread. Just deliciously combined that really anyone, BA or not, would truly enjoy. Like a Hoegaarden, very hazy white in color easy to drink the whole 750mL in no time. A great conversion beer for all those macro swill drinkers looking for something else."
"This is a very drinkable beer and I highly recommend it. Great beer for the summer."
"The body is light, crisp and refreshing. Sharp bite from the carbonation, bitter orange peel, and spice. I like it, though I have had better witbiers. Good price makes it worth it, however."
"D: A very nice beer to have around. At 5.1% it is also very sessionable. A great beer for the coming summer."
"There are no flaws to speak of, but there's not much character either."
"A fair witbier, but one that could use some restructuring to accomodate its strengths and round out its weaknesses. I'm not sure if the overcarbonation was an issue with this particular bottle, or if it is something aimed for in the recipe/production."
"Taste is for lack of a better term, boring. Seltzer water with a bit of sweetness. That's it. Not too drinkable because there's really no flavor to reel you in to want another."
"Ommengang Witte is a nice and refreshing witbier. It pours out of the bottle a nice golden color. It is has a good sized foamy head. The smell is 'grassy", with hints of lemon. The taste is very similar to the smell, with a nice spice flavor of citrus and wheat. The mouthfeel is clean. This is an ejoyable brew."
"This is definitely not a favourite in the style, but fairly drinkable. It was my last of a six-pack, so it may not have been super-fresh either (although it was well before the expiry date on the label)."
"Drinkability: Not the best offering from Ommegang, but at least it was an above average Witbier from an excellent Brewery. It's no Hennepin, but hey, what is?"
"Not a bad beer at all, nothing great about it, nothing offensive. This is the first Ommegang product I haven't been overly impressed with, though. Not much lacing, weak body. Decent taste but falls a little short of what I expect from a white beer. Definitely worth a try, don't get me wrong, just not one of my favorites."
"I had 4 good pulls then poured the rest down the drain. Snapped into a Hacker-Pschorr instead. Domestically speaking, Blue Moon beats this Wit hands-down. Hoegaarden's (true style) Wit remains my gold standard in Belgian Whites."
"Drinkability: Serve this wherever and whenever champagne is called for. The cage and cork and the very winey taste and appearance make this a great beer to celebrate with. Pair with poultry, salads, or appetizers."
"Hazy pale golden color with some white head and lacing. Smells wheaty, very wheaty. Lemony. As it should, really. Lots of zesty lemonstuff. Taste is also wheaty and lemony. Nothing exciting, but solid tastyness. Mouthfeel is sudsy, a tad watery, but okay. Pretty drinkable- light and easy. Not my favorite Ommegang brew, not even my second or third favorite, but not shabby."
"Drinkability was above average but this seemed to be a very pedestrian effort by the folks at Ommegang. Great brewery but this one was disappointing at best."
"Kind of ho-hum. I've enjoyed other offerings from Ommegang much more. This was a cloudy yellow appearance with a small head and some lacing. It had an orange, spicy, grainy odor to it. The taste was pretty much orange and spice, fairly mild. It was OK, a little pedestrian. Not something I'd drink a lot of."
"This pours a yellow straw with a large foamy head. This beer has a ton of carbonation. The smell is on the light side with some lemon and wheat scents. The taste has a strong lemon flavor with a hint of pepper and coriander. The m/f is light,but has a blance of flavors that isn't quite right. This is an Ok Witte beer, but if I had to pick just one,it wouldn't be this."
"An excellent springtime beer. As good for sipping as it is for pounding."
"Ommegang Witte will do in a pinch if the only other options are macros. I kinda hope I got a bad bottle, but I suspect not."
"overall, not one of my favorite in the wit style, not to say its bad though, its okay. i'm not sure if i'd recommend to someone looking for wits though."
" Flavor is light and almost delicate, very nice in the mouth. I'm starting to recognize the coriander among a few different spices, and a pleasant citrus as well. Plenty of lacing all over the exposed glass. This is top notch stuff as far as a white ale, similar to Hoegaarden but maybe superior on the mouthfeel. As far as a spring/summer style beer this would be tough to beat."
"The mouth is crisp yet silky smooth. Easy drinker, this would move up the scales with a bit more oomph. Inspite of these minor flaws, I enjoy this beer."
"Spritzy mouthfeel that enjoys the steady carbonation. Not my favorite style but this one has all of the refreshing qualities of a good witte and the usual depth that I expect from Ommegang makes for a solid beer."
"Very very average whitbier. I'm glad I got to try it (thanks to Fuzzyknoggin), but there's a rather large list of whitbiers I would purchase & drink before this one."
"Poured into my faithful westmalle chalice as a relatively clear, light golden yellow color with a whiter than white head. Dissipated rather quickly, but can be easily revived. Little lacing in the glass. Nose is slightly spicy, yeasty, and has that signature touch of citrus appeal. Smell is not as assertive as I'd have liked. Taste is dry, accentuated with a good spicy and fruity character. Tastes of pepper and pears. This witte is light in body and very highly carbonated, creating a pleasant tingle almost like a carbonated soft drink. This is a good witte. Ommegang's other ales are better, I think, but this is no slouch. A good Belgian style witte ale. Light and easy to drink."
"Sample at Whole Foods Market. Hazy straw color with a thin, frothy white head. Minimal lacing. Light spice and zesty citrus aroma. The mouthfeel is light and dry with a good amount of citrus but not too much spice flavor. The finish is airy short with more citrus and a bit of coriander. Light and refreshing, and maybe a little boring but above average."
"Thanks to Faustgeist for sharing!"
"My least favorite Ommegang beer (lucky since I can't buy it easily)."
"I'm pretty disappointed with this...just not much happening in the glass. I really love everything Ommegang does..think it's all exceptional....always have some in the fridge...but this I wouldn't buy again."
"the beer's tartness made itself more and more apparent as it warmed in my glass"
"This has a slighly cloudy straw yellow color, but the bright white head had no retention. The smell is mainly yeast and citrus. The flavor is nice, with oragnepeel blending seamlessly with the hops, a bit of herby corriander to blend with the malt, and plenty of yeast to finish. The mouthfeel was a bit off, with teeny tiny sharp bubbles. Overall this was enjoyable, but ever so slighly flawed for the style. The flavors were well rounded, but it seems as though some details were missed."
"This beer is a fine example of the witbier style. It smells heavenly and tastes almost as good. Even though I still prefer the masterpiece that is Allagash White, I have to agree with the label that Ommegang Witte is ""worth the wheat""."
"Overall: An interesting wit. Plenty of tartness and spice in flavor. Solid, nothing special."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is very light bodied and more than ample carbonation. Very tart but this just help render a crisp mouthfeel. This is a very easy drinking beer."
"Mouthfeel is light, spritzy and smooth. Slightly creamy. This one goes down easily and would make for a great summer beach brew. Bring a few 750's and enjoy the sun. Not my favorite from Ommegang, but a nice wit overall."
"All in all a stand out. Will happily drink again."
"750 ml corked bottle. Ommegang Witte pours out a light yellow color with a big white head that fades quickly. The aroma is orange peel and spices, especially coriander. The flavor is wheat, slightly sour lemon and orange, and lots of spice. A real thirst quencher, this beer works best as a summer time quaffer. Mouthfeel is light to medium. High carbonation. Great drinkability, but lacks some of the more complex flavors of the top wits."
"Cheers!"
"Pours an extremely light golden color that is paler on the sides than in the center, almost whitish. After a careful pour out of a 750ml, the beer is transparent and clear. A two inch white head forms comprised of very loose bubbles. The aroma is fairly strong, but not terribly complex. Tangy wheat-like witha bit of orange peel in the background. Thankfully, the taste is more interesting than the aroma. It begins with a slight orangey sweetness. This quickly gives way to a wheaty tang and a belgian spiciness that twirl around each other. Add some coriander at the end for good measure. There is a bitterness from the orange peel that sits on the back of your tongue after the swallow. This is an immensely drinkable beer, which is very quenching. I enjoyed it very much, but feel it could be even better with a little more orange sweetness and a little less wheaty tang. Don't serve it too cold as the flavors are very muted when cold."
"Overall, the acidity prevails with the spices of yeast gaining precedence over classic powdery textures and prominant spice additions. This gives a rustic unveiled character that is likely more like what authentic witbiers used to be."
"Overall this is a great wit. A quality body with pretty good carbonation. Very easy to drink and has a smoothness that other wit dont have."
"Drinkability: Refreshingly light but not a spicy as I was expecting"
"D: This is definatly a hot weather biere, I drank mine with a brats w/ sourkraut, it went down well and didn't over power the tangy kraut taste, you could match this up with any good bbq food and it would work well. Also since the low alcohol level, you could put away a few in a sitting, and their not filling either. although this is not my favorite wit out there by any means it still stands up as an above scale example of the style. but if you like wits try the celis or and easy classic the hoegarden."
"Well when poured there is a large bubbly head and a pale cloudy yellow color. The head will lessen. The smell is of yeast and a hint of citrus and spice. The taste is of light citrus and spice yet is kind of dull. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated tingle. The drinkablility is average."
"Pours a beautiful cloudy pale yellow with a big frothy head, good longevity and equally good lace. Smells just like a witte should - a sour malted wheat aroma with banana, clove and citrus tones. As far as taste it also tastes as a witte should but nothing too spectacular. It has the all the standard wheat flavors - banana, clove, citrus etc. Fairly high carbonation, I realize witts do tend to have higher than average, but this left me a bit bloated and belchy (if thats a word) than normal. It is easy drinking but a bit too high on the carbonation side. Still an very good beer though."
"It's light, very light with moderate carbonation. This makes it very drinkable. I finished half of a 750 bottle in just minutes. This surprised me because I was used to Ommegang's heavier beers. It felt a little too filter for my taste. Other wise this was a nice beer."
"As this is a 750ml bottle, if you're not splitting it with a friend, it releases more flavor as it reaches room temp. That over-the top CO2 bitterness gives way and it becomes a lot smoother and more enjoyable. I like this more than other witbeirs I've tried."
"Pours a dullish cloudy yellow with a decent foamy white head. Smells of wheat, go figure, a little spicy, fruity, with a bit of a musty finish. Taste is similarly grainy, spicy, citrusy and musty. Not too malty or hoppy really. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing. I wasn't blown away by this beer. It was refreshing to drink, but didn't really have too much character. Not bad, not great, but pretty good. I like the complexity of their other brews over this witbier."
"Despite its carbonation, it does go down easy."
"I could drink one of these after the other. It is a nice, refreshing and very flavorful beer. One that should be visited on a warm summer day to truly appreciate it's refreshing nature."
"This is a very pretty beer that almost shines in the light. The nose is clean and crisp with those traces of orange and coriander. What I really noticed about this version was the sophistication and care taken with the balance and finish. Fragrant, oh so drinkable and very well crafted."
"Pours a nice hazy pale golden hue with pillowy white head that fades fast. Very little lacing. Smells of powdery yeasts with some citrus. Tastes of citrus bitterness that, curiously, fades almost immediately leaving lingering citrous. Light to body with nice effervescence. This is a very light and refreshing brew. A full bodied version is necessary."
"The average alcohol content and its light taste makes this a drinkable beer. It's nice for the warmer months, which are many down here in Florida."
"Another solid offering from Ommegang."
"Entry lights softly on the palate, moving headlong into a midtaste featuring beautiful light grapefruit and orange notes supported by ample carbonation. The finish is crisp and dry with many floral notes and a Belgian yeast fade."
"Drinkability- Very good summer witbier. Not the best, but one of the good ones to be sure."
"Sampled as I type June 3, 2005. Pours a hazy straw color with a big white head. Head disipates semi-quickly and lace starts to fom. Nice. Carbonation is full in the glass and the beer dances on the tonque. Nose shows big citrus and some clove, definately yeast dominated. The mouthfeel as I said is effervescent, nice and refreshing the flavor is tart, grapefruit maybe ?, finish is long and dry, leaves you mouth watering."
"Drinkable however not my type of Wight Beer."
"Nicely done by Ommegang."
"Pours a pale yellow in color with a thin spongey head. Nice spiral of carbonation comes out of the center of the goblet. Aroma is oranges, wheat and yeast. Taste is nice and chewy. Wheat comes across at first, followed up by a nice citurus birts of oranges and lemons. Mouthfeel is very full and chewy (I like that word). Finish is just slightly dry. A very easy drinking beer without a high ABV that makes a nice sessional choice."
"Taste: Lick an orange rind, lick a cut granny smith, crack a white peppercorn and blow it across your palate, drink some artesian water with a lemon squirt, look at the word coriander. Lick that apple again, and again. Dries, dries to a mouthful of white wheat flour. I couldn't drink this fast enough partly because it's quenching, and partly because it's boring. For my money I'd buy a case of Berliner Kindl (recently reviewed)."
"Cork pops with all of the beer staying in the bottle. Pours extremely pale gold in color with a lot of chill haze. Very watery with an overriding grassy flavor. Mouthfeel is very light as to be expected in the style. Slighty acidic and citrusy taste but not overwhelming orange flavor like other wittes. No corriander flavor like other wittes either. Slight yeasty background taste. Flavor quickly dissipates with not much aftertaste other than a crisp watery flavor. Refreshing but not much there. Fairly dry in aftertaste."
"An average interpretation of a witbier, I think. I'm a little disappointed in Ommegang for this one because all their other beers are stellar. This however, is pretty plain. It's still a good beer, don't get me wrong, but could be better."
"Bottle: Poured a pale clear yellow color ale with below average head with average retention. Aroma of orange and very subtle coriander. Taste is very light with limited spice (lack of coriander) with some limited sweetness/floral aspect. Carbonation is good but body is too thin. Watery feeling on the aftertaste kind of ruin this one for me."
"To be fair, I will seek this out and review it again... I'm sure it is more tasty and pleasant to drink when fresh."
"Mouthfeel is light and spritzy yet absolutely full of flavor. A smooth, almost creamy body with gentle, rolling medium bubbles. This tastes sooo good on a hot afternoon, I could drink all 6. Hats off to you again Ommegang, you couldn't find a better Belgian Witte in all of Belgium!"
"Taste has a permeating barnyard funk. Sour wheat malt and spicy. Coriander and lemony. A bit thin but crisp and dry. Nice clean finish with a faint funky aftertaste. No the best but a really good witte."
"This beer poured a very murky yellow color and formed a small egg white bubbly head that left trace lace as it subsided. Some carbonation was present. An aroma of hops, citrus and some small hint of spices. The flavor was of hops and citrus. The finish was a touch dry. A refreshing Belgian Wit style, but strikes me more of a session type rather than the higher tier types."
"Drinkability is decent with this beers only drawback being its slightly below average mouthfeel, still tasted good and the whole 750 went down pretty quick. Not to bad Ommegang."
"The beer divorces the 12-ounce brown bottle and sets in the glass a beclouded lemon yellow with a modest creamy white head and the residual lace a velum like sheet upon the glass. Nose is sweet with malt, hints of lemon-lime, coriander and spices, the start is lightly sweet and the top is light in feel upon the palate. Finish is stinging in its acidity with the hops delectable in their unassuming spiciness, quite dry aftertaste a fine example of the style, quite a thirst quencher."
"Comments - This beer is brewed in New York, but it tastes just like any one of several beers from Beligium that I have tried. Recommended."
"Very mild, very dry, but leaves this oddly enjoyable oily feel on the tongue. The label says it combines flavors of sweet orange peel, coriander and unmalted wheat... that sums it up pretty well in my view. A very pleasant drinking experience and another fine offering from the folks at Ommegang."
"I applaud Ommegang, one of my favorite American breweries, for crafting this nearly note perfect rendition of a delicious, refreshing Belgian style."
"Taste: dry with a crisp and spiced body, some citrus notes. Feels slightly thin in the mouth. This would be a pretty good session beer in the summer, but overall I prefer the Allagash White, Unibroue Blanche de Chambly or Hoegaarden Wit."
"Their packaging rocks also."
"I give it low drinkability because, as good as it is, I don't see drinking more than one in a sitting. But I will order again, on occasion."
"Hazy, sunny-wheat colored beer with streams of small bubbles. Poured a big bright white, meringue looking head that looked good at first, but didn't last all that long and left no lace. Light wheat aroma with some zesty lemon and corriander mixed in, and a pinch of yeast at the bottom. Fairly light, easy drinking beer. Light wheat/malt base with some not-quite sour lemon and coriander towards the end. Light without being water, taste is simple and enjoyable, very refreshing, gimme more!"
"Lightly hazy, Im alarmed at the clarity and the lack of color. Faint gold in hue, no depth. The head was about a finger in height. White in color, bubbly and then fizzy. Head retention was so-so; it faded to a thin, fizzy cap. A few moments later nothing was left. I am not impressed with the appearance of this beer. Hell, it looks no better than New Belgiums Sunshine Wheat! There was no subsequent lacing either. Dull. The nose lacked potency; I could hardly smell anything. What the hell? Faint notes of citrus, spiced wheat malt, mild dough kisses, flour, some pepper too. The detectable aromas are pleasant and generally Wit-like. Too clean for me, Im not impressed with the nose. Soft. Middling. Inviting by default barely. The palate is surprisingly tart for a Wit. Its not right. I like my Wits with a healthy wheaty-yeasty/chalky flavor in the middle; this one has nothing like that. Nothing. The wheat offers hardly anything. Ive tasted more wheat in adjunct lagers! The spices are hardly noticed as well. Again, what the hell? Pepper is stronger in taste then the coriander. Tart lemon is stronger in taste then the orange peel. This beer is way out of whack. Juicy finish, it is too wet. No dryness. No spice in the aftertaste. I am not impressed at all with this Wit. It is hard for me to believe that Ommegang brewed this. Medium-light in body, slick mouthfeel because the body is thin (and a bit watery) and the carbonation is lacking. More effervesces is needed. Tacky. Sure it is drinkable but it is completely pointless. This is one of the worst Wits Ive ever tasted. It is inoffensive but horribly boring! I have no reason to drink this overly tart, under-spiced, non-wheaty, clean, White Ale again. This is a very sad example of the style. A major dud not recommended. I purchased a 750ml in Milwaukee, WI for $4.00."
"Pours a hazy yellow-straw color and is topped by an eminent, frothy pale white head that is initially held up by a healthy carbonation. The aroma reminds me of freshly cut hay, fields of clover, coriander, lemon zest, and grains of paradise. The taste is light and refreshing with notes of orange zest up front followed by a solid though not overwhelming finish of coriander. Along with the orange and coriander there are notes of lemon zest, ginger, pepper, banana, and clove. With my second glass I poured the rest of the beer, yeast and all into my glass. It becomes, obviously, a bit more yeasty, with notes of fresh bread, and it becomes quite a bit more hearty. This is quite a nice Witte, it is simple, refreshing, zesty, spritzy, it reminds me of a warm summer afternoon spent sitting on the porch. Once again I am a sucker for a good Belgian Witte."
"A nice example of a witbier. Pleasurable to quaff and in keeping with some of the better known witbiers. Nice to finally find it in my area."
"Overall a very pleasing light bodied brew, dont drink it too cold!"
"My expectations were not met here. Hoping a for better style interpretation from Ommegang. All of their other beers are usually dead on. I'm thinking this beer might not be at its freshest."
"Not the brewery's top offering, in fact the weakest I have had from them. Belgian style with spicyness and wheat sweetness and cream rolled into one. Would have worked if less carbonated. Had at Blue Tusk in Syracuse. Medium mouthfeel. Bitter metallic aftertaste."
" Excellent witbier, and very Belgian in style. Refreshing and highly drinkable. Very well crafted."
"Nice spicing, with notes of coriander, sweet oranges, caramel and butter toffee. I am a sucker for a good white beer but this didnt quite do it for me. I prefer Allagash White and SPH Double White."
"(750ml / 25.4 oz corked and caged champagne style bottle)"
"A very springy yellow color with an ample white head. A dry, Mexican aroma -- ground coriander and cumin with hints of citrus. Grainy, almost. Gives the feel of swishing a mouthful of crumbs around, leaving the same sensation as dotting any form of ground seed on your tongue. A very dry beer consisting of dried orange peel and dried herbs and spices in the flavor. Appropriate, I suppose. Some wits, especially some of the Belgians, seem to have a little more body, a certain hefe-like, protein-shake creaminess that really makes them sing, but this is a little thinner. It's missing that little extra oompf required to be excellent."
"pours an okay but not great hazy golden colour. bubbkes rise to the top to reach...virtually nothing. where's the head? that's the biggest problem here. it is very minimal at best. the smell is very nice, especially for an american version of the style: sweet and fruity, withcitrus and wheat notes abound. orange peel and spice are present as well, along with a touch of earth. the flavour echoes the smell but is very bland and at times watery. flavour is only really present at the end, with a sharp orange wheat taste that's dry but satisfying. carbonation levels need to be rasied a bit too. this beer seemed almost flat at times. overall, this one has alot of potential, and, while definitely not a bad brew, could be much much better. i'd call it slightly above average right now at best."
"Pours a straw color with a bright white head. I love the corked bottles, but it plays up the quality of the beer inside in this case. A very solid Wit, but nothing really special. Sweet, yet spicey as one would expect. A good introduction into the world of Belgian style beers, but not a destination. Worth trying though."
"This is a very nice little witbier. Nice cloudy yellow body with an ok head. The aroma had a nice bit of orange and coriander. Not really strong, but not weak either. The body was pretty much spot on for style, with more body than some like Hoegaarden, but without the big burst of flavor of others. Extremely drinkable and refreshing. I likes."
"OK witbeir, but seemed more like a basic wheat."
"Refreshing, and includes some of my favorite flavors from Belgium. I love it!"
"Drinkability  This is my idea of the style standard. I really enjoyed sipping this one on an unusually warm Sunday September afternoon in Seattle."
"Light bodied, and as easy drinking as the style should be, very good on a hot day, and an excellent example of the style."
"12 oz bottle. Pous a cloudy golden lemon in color with a small white head. Medium-bodied mouthfeel that has substance with it's crispness. Grainy wheat malt taste upfront. Banana and vanilla flavors arrive shortly midway through. Flavor turns more lemony and citrus. Spicy coriander and yeast in the finish. A classic representation of the style and a solid offering from Ommegang."
"The appearance of this beer would lead one to believe that the were about to have one of those great beer drinking experiences. The beer had the light yellow hue and a great head, like all wit beers should have. What was lacking in this presentation was the taste and smell. I could not detect anything in the aroma and the same for the taste. There was a faint taste of wheat, but no spiciness or citris taste. Not one of their best brews."
"Pours nice murky gold --1mm of foam left on top. Smells a clean fruit and wheat. It is beautifully fresh--I purchased it at the brewery. This is their first beer that is available on tap. As usual, draft is better than bottle as long as its fresh.The bottle is excellent too and holds a decent 1mm head after several mins. Nose is fruity wheaty-yeasty--no honey though. I get tired of hefe-weisse anyway. Taste is pure gold brilliance but not as malty as I like. Not as nutty either. Mouthfeel is fine --nothing negative to say about it. This is slightly dangerous for drinkabilty--you could have 3-6 of these w/o much difficulty."
"this one was in a nice cork bottle with directions on the lable.i uncorked with a little disappointment it didn't sound very lively and when i poured it was a little less carbonated then i would have hoped for this style. had a nice head a little thin that quickly dissaperd. the smell was of light fruit nothing overwhelmed me.the taste was a little bland not as sharp or fizzy that iv noticed this style will have. Not bad butt I expected more!!"
"Nice cloudy lemon yellow with a thick creamy white head that stayed on though the sipping later as a constant thin covering. Scents of bananas, lemony citrus, spicey and so fresh. Smooth and lightly creamy feeling with an almost medium body. Such good fresh tastes and aromas. Great easy drinker, good session, could sit back with tons of these on a warm evening."
"This came in a corked 750 ml bottle with no freshness date. This poured a surprisingly clear yellow with about half an inch of white head. Plenty of carbonation bubbles can be seen rising to keep the head alive and leaving a slight lace as this was drank. On the second glass the body was completely murky with not much light passing through. The smell was mainly of spices such as coriander and pepper with a good yeasty doughy scent present as well. The taste was consistent with the smell as the main focus was on spice with no other flavors really dominating. There was a nice wheat flavor and a small lemony zest as well. Something about the taste was a bit odd though and I couldnt quite put my finger on it. Mouthfeel was fairly average with a bit of over carbonation. Drinkability was good though as the taste was crisp and refreshing. Not a bad Wit beer by any means but not one of my favorites. Thanks to Lupe for the bottle in BIF14."
"This was one of those middle of the road Belgian wits. I'm not talking about taste but more in terms of sweetness to sourness ratio. This beer was really neither sweet nor sour. The smell was really yeasty and somewhat musty. But the taste was much different. Fruity notes come in upfront but a ripe banana yeast precense rides in on the thick body. Lots of spices are there (clove, orange peel, pepper) and they really seem to steal the show. The finish is dry but has a lingering quality to it. This is a really drinkable beer and one that I could both drink quickly and drink a lot of without getting sick of it."
"Comes in a 750ml bottle with a champagne cork. Pours into my Liefman's goblet a rich, cloudy golden color with a pretty, one-inch white head. Ale yeast dominates the nose, with background notes of coriander, lemon, orange, and alcohol. Palate is tangy up front, with lemony overtones and notes of yeast, allspice, and a touch of hops. Grain comes through on the finish. Mouthfeel is slightly foamy, but still enjoyable. A very satisfactory beer to wind up my Labor Day weekend."
"Light, refreshing, and easily consumable. IMO there are plenty of other better tasting wits out there. A good beer but a bit disappointing from Brewery Ommegang: this is by far my least favorite from these guys."
"Wheat and lemon graze the nose. Up front, a decent medium bodied wit. Zesty lemon and wheat flavors, give way to some biscuity and grainy offerings. Quite tasty and very satisfying. Yeast like notes on the palate, a bit creamy. Finishes tarty and tangy, but cleansing and delicious - outstanding!"
"Bought in a 750oz, corked bottle. This one pours a very bright yellow color and has a tall white head that sticks around for a while. Not much in the aroma - weak, but some hints of yeast and wheat. The flavor is a little weak, but still nice. Some wheat with citrus and a nice grainy texture. Although the flavor doesn't pack the full punch I was expecting, it still has a great character and flavor. Good beer."
"12oz Bottle No Date Pours a very light gold color that is slightly hazy and sports a white as snow fluffy head that diminishes slightly but hangs. Aroma is very lemony with notes of yeast and orange. Body is crisply carbonated and light. Flavor is sweet and citrusy with a bit of coriander, orange and yeast. Overall not the greatest but not a bad one if you like Witbier."
"Another good wit, but not among the elite of the style. Quite citrusy, lemon-lime like flavor. Thin and carbonated, quite refreshing. Almost tastes like lemon-lime soda. I like every beer I've tried from this brewery, although I like Allagash and Unibroue better."
"The mouthfeel is a little thin, and nicely effervescent, which I feel is often the case with the style. I like just a little more body in my beer, but I can't fault them for this -- that's a style preference for me, and this beer is quite true to the style. Drinkability is very high, as the alcohol is not noticeable and the finish is refreshing and crisp. My big bottle is gone before I know it. It's not the best Witte I've had, but at $4.95 for a big bottle, how can you go wrong?Ommegang is good...but you knew that."
"The only drinkable brew I've had from Ommegang. As far as Wit's go, this is somewhat better than average, but it needs a little more heft throughout. I would still pick Blue Moon over this. Doesn't hold a candle to Holy Moses or Vuuve. Still, I'd buy it again if I didn't have any other options."
"75 cl corked and caged bottle. Pours a clouded lemony yellow with some orange highlights and a huge white head. Some traditional witbier aromas, citrus zest, coriander and wheat acidity, slightly perfumy from the yeast. Flavors are pretty dulled, starts wheaty and perfumy, goes watery mid-palate and then finishes crisp from adequate carbonation and slightly acidic. Overall, not a bad experience, it's better than some Belgian witbiers I've had, but a slight bit too perfumy for the style."
"A very refreshing beer. Still, it is number 4 of 4 in their line up for me."
"Cloudy and hazy bright yellow-orange color, spicy, earthy citrus aromas, nice white frothy head that lasts and leaves some lacing in my glass.. Fresh tart orange and mild spice flavors, crisp carbonated mouthfeel, finishes clean and crisp, a very refreshing and drinkable brew."
"I expected big things from Ommegang's witbier and the pour sure lived up to those expectations. Poured a peach-kissed bright orange in color. Fluffy white layer of head fails to diminish and offers a lovely sheeting action on the glass. Aromas are very muted. Whiffs of yeasty bread, orange peel, and spices. Flavor falls short of the mark. High level of carbonation overshadows the flavors. Little bits of wheat flavor, mixed with spices are all that I can get. Finishes very dry and unflavorful, with a champagne-like quality to it. Mouthfeel is fizzy and it was very tough to drink the whole bottle of this."
"It's glowing hazy gold in a glass. The smell is citrus and a bit of spice. The taste is also predominantly citrus, with a fairly strong lemon bent. Unfortunately, the spicy flavors that seem to want to come through remain in the background throughout. Maybe it's a bit too subtle for my taste. Like most wits, it's quite a treat on a hot summer afternoon."
"This flaxen-colored belgian white has a cloudy appearance and a moderate head. It has a pungent, sharp smell with a strong clove overtone. The taste is sweet with hints of clove and banana, and is very smooth and well balanced. This is a quite enjoyable belgian, deserving of several offerings."
"Pleasant drinkable brew, a bit too mild for my tastes but I wouldn't refuse a glassful of this."
"I had high expectations of this, as I enjoy Ommegang's other beers. I had a hard time writing this review because I WANTED it to be a good beer. Sadly, it isn't."
"Drinkability: Easy enough beer to put down, but kind of boring. I won't seek this one out."
"Cloudy dimmed sun yellow with a moderate amount of carbonation noted. Thin white head. Lacing is average at best. Doughy yeastiness, corriander, pepper and other spicy tones mix together on the nose. Almost smells more like a tripel. Decent though. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated, but not quite overdone. Light-medium body. Spritzy feel in the mouth. Lemon, yeasty bready properties and spicy pepper blend together on the palate. I'd like to see more orange tones and more wheat properties. Average. I'd drink it again if someone gave me one, otherwise I'd not seek it."
"Light and tingly on the tongue, the flavor mirrors the nose and this nice, easy-drinking beer is an excellent American example of the style and very enjoyable, if uncomplex."
"Sweetish wheat malt smell with a pungent corriander wiff to it.. Straw yellow pale look in the goblet with a 1 inch thick persistant white head. Nice lacing and retention. Rich malt taste upfront with layers of marshmello and lemon. Smooth thickish mouth with lots of silk on the tongue. After the swallow the brew dries slightly with traces of corriander, lemon peel, and nutmeg on the dry tongue. Quite quenching and drinkable. Very nice summer selection."
"A well made example of the style. Poured a hazy golden peach. Soft, slightly sweet citrus fruit aroma. Very fresh tasting, initially orange peel and coriander spicing were most prominent, but as I got into the beer, the spicing took on more of a clove aspect (yeast?), and that continued to dominate the spice profile throughout. The level of sweetness was just about perfect, enough to compliment the spices, but not so much as to be tiring. Ommegang's products continue to be some of the most reasonably priced I've seen, good value for the money."
"A cloudy pale yellow brew with a bright white head that disappears quickly. A yeasty citrussy aroma with a hint of clove. Citrus at the start of the taste with a wheat and corriander middle and a clean fresh citrus on the finish. An excellent hot weather summer beer. That is flavorful but light on the palate making for easy drinkability ( more than one or two or three )."
"Turbid dark straw hue. Fluffy porcelain white head yields frothy lace. Soft notes of soured orange, grainy must and herbal phenols in aroma. Wafts of trace banana and honey as the beer warms. Tame and functional in aroma. Begins thinly, with a carbonic acid bite combined with a suggestion of underripe banana perceived initially in flavor. Becomes citric promptly, with orange peel combining with a tart lactic undertone to lend a fermented lemon juice impression. Thickens somewhat mid palate, with lightly viscous oat glucans and suspended yeast adding girth that belies the high attenuation. Becomes progressive more grainy as it breathes. Notes of Sourdough and lemon bar arise concomitantly with mellow coriander after a deliberation. Finishes mostly clean, but lightly spicy with fleeting hints of lemon pepper and must. A solid Wit, albeit shy in yeast esters and spicing. Definitely mellow. My personal preference is for a more vibrant citric presence. Regardless, it's a well crafted brew that exhibits excellent drinkability."
"Drinkability: Excellent summer quencher!"
"750 ml bottle. Very one dimensional and dissapointing. I expected more and got less. Yawn..."
"A very solid offering from Ommegang. Pours a standard cloudy golden hazy orange/yellow with a think white foam head. Smells of citrus, lemon and pepper. Not as spicy as Allagash, but oh so delicious. Crisp smooth mouthfeel, hints of coriander, and black pepper and a nice level of carbonation and citrus. A fantastic summer beer that I will come back to."
"A big Wit that manages to hold its balance thanks to complete attenuation."
"A pure white head tops very pale milky yellow cloudy liquid. Lots of yeast in suspension. Light and delicately spicy/fruity nose with coriander and citrus taking center stage. A slight musty yeast taste combines with flavors of sweet maltiness, and wit spices. Gentle carbonation. Finishes on a light and lemony note, nice beer but I'd like a bit more ""oomph"" in it to really make it stand out."
"Taste: Slightly watery, even for the style. Nice peppered and spicy lemon flavor, with prickly carbonation. Very dry after the swallow, and an enjoyable wheaty character comes through in the finish. Something about the flavor reminds me of wax. Good wit, definitely worth a try. I'd like to give the 750 size a shot."
"Beer is good. Happy bitter 500 year old recipe beering."
"Overall: Its a small world, I actually tried this for the first time last night at a local Beer Tasting held at the Wine Country where I buy some of my craft beer from. Then this morning a box of goodies arrives from Sir McCall. This was a part of the beery package, and it was immediately fridged and super-cooled using liquid Nitrogen such was my impatience to try it. As the Sun warmed up the Apartment this one really hit the spot. As of this week, it is now available on the West Coast and costs $5.99 for a 750ml bottle - a serious bargain in my opinion. Thanks and Cheers to Sir McCall for this afternoons sample, Im going to get more of this one for sure! Excellent!!"
"It pours a cloudy gold with plenty of effervesence, with a nice half finger of head. It has a strong spicy smell over a base of malt. One of the best smelling beers I've ever encountered. The beer has a strong malt and spice taste with none of the fruitiness you normally get in a Witbier. The beer has a light oily feel to it that goes down easily, but has a sharp sour finish. Not a beer that I would avoid, but I'm sure I wouldn't select it over other whites on the market."
"something i have thought since my first sip should go first, ""oh so smooth."" pasty bronze yellow color with a white puffy head that runs away almost as quickly as i could drink this. i should note that i am not a big fan of this style but i did enjoy this. lemony citrus, bitter kind of wheat beer smell. there is a clove taste up front and a bit of corriander, lemon and other citrus flavors. the flavors aren't over powering, very subtle and brilliantly blended. light body very thin. this is so drinkable it hurts. wonderful lemony burps, and it just goes down so easy with the subtle flavors. don't take subtle with negative connotation, it is just that they are all blended so well that it makes a great summer beer. i don't care what certain brothers say, certain beers do fit certain situations better, and a on a nice hot summer day, this will refresh you unbeleiveably. my new favorite ommengang offering and possibly giving me a new found intrest in wits."
" I was able to talk my wife into trying by telling her it was a light ""summer brew."" She loved it. Just found a nice new hidden gem that sells this and other Ommegang brews for $5."
"750mL bottle poured into an Ommegang chalice. It pours a hazy light yellow color with two fingers of head. There is minimal lacing left over. The smell is fruity and spicy, with all the classic orange and coriander you would expect from a witbier. The taste is a great blend of wheat malt, citrus, and spices. A nice peppery finish and very refreshing. The mouthfeel very thick and heavy for a witbier. The drinkability is superb as well. One of the best witbiers Ive ever had. Almost as good as Allagash White."
"Banana and coriander shine through with some orange aspect. Yeast is apparent as well. Dry finish, very clean."
"Drinkability: Great. This stuff goes down super easy and is perfect for the summer. But, it lacks the complexity I've come to like in my witbiers, so Allagash is going to remain my staple."
"The beer poured a hazy, light yellow with a big white head and considerable lacing. The aroma is mild with an overall sensation of wheat and some hints of citrus and cloves. I was disapointed in the taste. It is considerably milder or less flavorful than many other Wits. There is a taste of the predominant wheat with a small citrus belly, but there is no spiciness that you find in other Wits. There appears to be less bitterness than I would have expected also. The beer is light in the mouth with a crisp cleaness. It's not a bad beer but not memorable either."
"A very solid wit. Though it doesn't have the overt spicing of some other wits, the nice citrus character is a unique change of pace, and one that I appreciate very much. Absolutely one that I would have again."
"One final note - you don't need to put a lemon in it. Pretend you did, because it tastes like it anyway."
"Drinkability: Sessionable, but lacking in the citrus and coriander department - something I love about this style. I'll take the local Old Dominion Summer Wheat over this, thanks."
"Poured into a large pilsner glass, this wit is pale yellow in color and hazy with sediment. Large and fluffy white head had good retention. Aroma was of wheat, yeast and citrus with spice notes of coriander. Spices were much more pronounced in the flavor. Tasted of oranges and yeast, and almost a ginger-like spiciness. Finish is far from dry, bitter hops coat the throat in a lip-smacking, thrist-quenching kinda way. I thought this was a great example of the style, and was top-notch quality. I will definetely be buying this all summer as it is perfect for the season (year round for that matter) and is my favorite Ommegang so far."
"Damn this is a good beer. So very simple, yet so complex and flavorful. I know in my reviews I say I could drink this beer all day, but literally, I polished off a 750ml by myself and was almost tempted to go pick up another couple right then and there to drink some more of this very drinkable session beer. Another fantastic beer from ommegang."
"Hazy pale yellow in color with a nice thick 2"" head. Very light lacing does develop. The aroma is of spice and wheat. The flavor is different from some others in this style as the wheat, citrus, and coriander tones are more laid back but are nicely balanced. A light tartness kicks in up front and it is very dry on the finish. This is lighter in body and had nice carbonation levels that give it a light crispness in the start of the mouthfeel. Good summertime brew that is refreshing and thirst quenching."
"Smooth, crisp and clean in the mouth with light carbonation. Lacks in flavor, but is still quite refreshing to drink."
"Appearance: Cloudy golden nectarine color with a vibrante white vanilla cream head, leaves thick intricate lacing. Aroma: Coriander, cloves, and orange peels along with the unmalted wheat are very aromatic wow what a nice witbier. Taste: Unmalted wheat lucious layers of spice mild creamy finish excellent I'm liking this Cooperstown offering the coriander is just right. Mouthfeel: Medium body tame carbonation, silky smooth texture perfect going down. Drinkability: This is the most accurate American brewed witbier I have tried dead on to style."
"Notes: Nice wit from a solid brewery. Good example of how beers in this style can differ slightly."
"Drinkablity & Notes: My palate got lost in the tartness, it seemed the flavors did not meld well and everything was separate. A good brew though there are many witbiers that fit the shoe better than this one."
"The flavor is good, the the refreshing character is the real strength here. Basic and crisp, it goes in a straight line and does a fine job of wiping out any signs of thirst. It's smooth on the way down, and calling it drinkable would be an understatement. Okay, it may not be best in show, but it's good enough and crisply fun enough to warrant some do-overs."
"Appearance is a very light murky yellow, rivaling the color of many macro-swill out there, but at least i know there will be flavor behind this to back up that color. Head is decent, white and soapy, leaving little to no lace. Smell has lots of wheat and banana, with some fig hints and no hops to be had. The taste is very very light, and rivaling on tart, but is a bit hard to pick out. There are some grassy wheats definatley and some malt, with some more of the starchy fruitiness. The mouthfeel is very thin yet very carbonated, with larger bubbles, much like soda water. This is my first witte beer, and I think it was a good one to start on."
"Raw grain, tart lemony flavours. Tons of spicy coriander, & subtle hints of orange. A bit heavy handed with the coriander. Light-medium bodied, smooth, moderate carbonation. Thirst quenching & refreshing."
"I'm not usually one to sit and drink witte all day. But the dry finish and light touch make this an extremely drinkable beer."
"I was pretty excited when I saw this brew in the liquor store I usually go to. It pours out a hazy yellow color. The smell and taste as you would expect are citrusy. Seems like more people were struck by the lemon taste but I found an orange taste more prevailing. What was really great about this beer was the mouthfeel. This wit is very well carbonated and feels good on the tongue. It was a bit dry, however, and I think could be more refreshing. All in all, a good product put forth by Ommegang."
"Picked this up at Liquor Depot to my surprise. 750mL bottle for 4.25. Not bad. Poured out a solid light orange color. I was expecting it to be a little more dull, but that's fine by me. Smell was refreshing as well. Citrus aromas blended in with some spice and yeast. Taste is a little on the light side, but yet flavorful which is great for the summer months. Orange and lemon hit the palate with some wheat and grain flavors which blend in so nicely. Carbonation is really good in this brew. A nice amount in there. I must say, one the of top 3 wits out there. A very nice brew."
"A good brew that is above average in all aspects. Pours a nice lemon color with smallish lacing head. Smell is definite lemon citrus and wheat undertones. Taste was light wheat with a lemon flavor. Mouthfeel was dry throughout, but not overly so, Very easy on the drinkability scale...light bodied with a refreshing dry crispness throughout."
"defintely a go to wit-style beer"
"Not an overly bold or different rendition. Simply a nice, well-stuctured and traditional one."
"A cloudy, light yellow colour with a nice off-white head of foam that stays around for the long haul, leaving some nice lace patterns on the glass. The aromas are complex and lovely. I smell coriander, citrus peel, belgian yeast, wheat, some slightly bitter citrus-like hops, and some nice bready malts. The taste is light and flavorful at the same time, as the spicing of this brew is very good. The spices hit up front with the wheaty opening of this brew, the middle is a bit hoppy and citrus-like, and the finish is lightly bready, crisp, and clean. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing, and the drinkability is good as well. This is a damn good American witte, perhaps even better than Hoegaarden."
"Nice white 1/2"" head on top of this straw hued brew. Nice grainy aroma to go with good lacing. Taste is as well a bit grainy, which is backed up by the mouthfeel. Seems to be somewhat thin in the craw, but overall certainly drinkable, a thirst-quencher for the yard, etc. Rivals Hoegaarden, for what it's worth..."
"A very slight but elegant witbier that is pushing hard on Hennepin to be my favorite beer from Ommegang, as after a few it has been growing and growing on me. Drink at least a couple before you form an opinion - in the least your tongue will be happy, but with time your brain will come around to it. That's my experience..."
"An extremely drinkable, refreshing witte for these hot humid summer days. Great job Ommegang!"
"The beer pours a cloudy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a very pleasant wheat scent which is enhanced by the presence of fruity Belgian wit yeast. It comes across dry, yet refreshing. The taste is decent, but not great. It comes off as being dry and a bit weak and watery. There is the clove flavor, but the fruitiness is quickly lost as you swallow. The wheat flavor fine. It seems a bit bland and stale. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an average wit beer. This is not at the same level as the other Ommegang offerings."
"Drinkability: This is the best American white I think I've ever had. I'd drink it everyday if I could find it in bottles."
"I like this brew alot and am intending to purchase sixtel for a summer party."
"This beer was served in a Ommegang Witte glass (very interesting looking) at Monk's. Not much head to speak of but a good bit of carbonation. It had a beautiful orangish color. The nice citrus flavors are present throughout and in the smell as well. Very refreshing. Not too many spicy Belgian yeast esters compared to other Belgians, which I like better for a summer beer. This gets high marks for its drinkability. If you like the style, I would definitely grab one of these."
" Overall: This is an only average wit for its price. I bought a six-pack of this at Beers of the World, which cost me nearly $14.00! At this amount, I was expecting something out of this world, or at least something better than average. In turn I got something very average. Next time I will stick to my Allagash White. It's better, and it costs nearly six dollars less. Excluding the issue of price, there are still much better beers of this style out there."
"12 ounce bottle, poured into a Hoegaarden goblet. Soft yellow, cloudy, white tiny bubble head, disolving in a nice sheen, leaves generous lacing. Yeasty nose. Creamy mouthfeel, pleasant and refreshing. Soft flavors of coriander, yeast, lemon, maple syrup,flowers, yummy stuff. I'll be enjoying this stuff all summer with salads, BBQ and whatever. Welcome to a new and tasty creation. This bottle was a party favor from the American-Belgian beer dinner at Oscars restaurant."
