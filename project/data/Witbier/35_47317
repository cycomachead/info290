If you want a beer that has a great taste and punches you in the face with its ABV, you have to try this.  Regardless it is worth trying at least once.","Jared_Alexander","Feb 02, 2015"

Smell was all alcohol and cloying sweetness. Taste was just like the smell to much of both alcohol and malt. Apperance was nice. About a finger of head and good lace on the glass.

I have four year old bottles I open for very special occasions and the taste is similar to a fine port wine. in about 10 years when my stock is empty I will be upset with Sam Adams for their mistakable choice of discontinuing it.","brian786868968676","Feb 23, 2014"

I hope all four beers from the sampler pack don't taste like a variance from the same base recipe. Anyway, it just tastes like stale old beer that was stored improperly. The alcohol and the sweetness is so big that it makes it hard to drink. Tastes a bit better as it warms up, but still meh.","constantine_272","Feb 07, 2014"

3.78,9.6,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/1/2013. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy golden orange color with a 2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, wheat, bread, honey, caramel, coriander, clove, pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester notes; with decent strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, honey, wheat, bread, caramel, coriander, clove, pepper, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon/orange zest, pear, apple, honey, caramel, wheat, bread, coriander, herbal, light clove, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance, robustness, and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very slick and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good imperial witbier. Good balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 20, 2014"

The aroma is enchanting...loads of spice (coriander, pepper) and a caramel, toffee, candy like background. Some candied-fruit is present in the aroma as well, along with yeast, banana, and a hint of clove. Woody and booze-like. The taste is moderately sweeet, but not at all with the crisp, tart-like qualities of a traditional wit. Interesting and very enveloping. The alcohol shows up in a prominent warmth. Full body.

The beer appears to be well carbonated due to the presence of lots of tiny bubbles rising in the beer. Not much lacing is left behind on the side of the glass. I pick up the wheat in the aroma as well as the spice notes. It's not a strong aroma overall, but I can pick up hints of coriander with citrus. Also make no mistake about it. The booze is noticeable in the aroma even when this beer is well chilled. Like in the aroma, the spice notes take a back seat to the malt and the booze. The spices notes are there and I do get the coriander, pepper, and citrus in the flavor. The sweetness is almost like honey in many ways. The body is full with enough carbonation to make this beer clean on the finish. The alcohol provides a nice warming feel. This is a good beer for what it is, but I wouldn't necessarily classify this as a witbier. It doesn't quite reach the levels of quality of an excellent wheatwine, which is how I'm judging this beer.","acevenom","Apr 11, 2013"

It is really just disgusting. Too many flavors buying for your attention, and they are like steam rollers on your taste buds, they don’t get along.

Mouthfeel was smooth and creamy but the taste was a bit too riotous and unbalanced for my taste. I found myself unable to distinguish between all of the flavors trying to happen all at once on my tongue. I got vanilla, loads of spice and dried dark fruit, but it was all too much to parse.

Not super strong- a little on the weak side for me- but not bad. The taste is a little of a let down. It's just too over the top sweet for me, and that doesn't let me appreciate anything else in this brew. Wheat, coriander, and a boatload of sugar are what I get. It's almost like drinking sugar water. Feel is super sweet- cloyingly sweet- and relatively thin. Overall, I probably won't look for this again. The over the top sweetness ruins it for me.

Taste was pleasant but nothing special. It had flavors of grapefruit, cotton candy, and lemon zest. Mouthfeel was a bit thick for a witbier, and overly sweet on the palate. I am not sure why they want to showcase this style of beer to be over 10%. Just strange, and I am not sure the high abv helped.

Overwhelmingly sweet on the nose. Big fruit flavors such as oranges, apricots, coriander, nutmeg, caramel, and of course alcohol. Nice sweet orange and apricot taste, heavy on the sweet sugar, makes it very sticky and thick. The taste is so sugary sweet its putting my eyes in the back of my head. Heavy on the mouthfeel, this beer is a big sugarbang. Very tart. Overall, i had some trouble with this one, i couldnt handle the sweet, it seemed artificial and syrupy at most times, others i could get a good sip.

The wheat malt base and orange flavor last long into the finish, the 10.3% alcohol is felt but barely percievable in the taste, just a hint at the end.

3.58,3.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on June 30, 2011. It pours a murky, hazy copper-amber with thin white head that sticks around for awhile. Loads of bubbly carbonation ascending upward. When I check out the aroma my first thought is that it is more like a Barleywine than a Witbier with its sweet caramel maltiness and alcohol bite. Maybe a hint of spices. The body is durable on the tongue. The flavor clears out the senses due to that 10% ABV I expect but otherwise I get some sweet malts and thin spices and a whole lot of punch (not fruit punch...I am referring to its alcohol nip). It impresses me more as a Barleywine rather than a Witbier.","puboflyons","Jun 30, 2011"

Good mouth feel, the alcohol is very present. there is some carbonation, its a medium thickness. The alcohol burn is present in the taste, more so than I normally like but the abv is high.

The smell of the beer has the typical coriander and yeasty citrus aromas along with some spice. The taste translates the aroma into flavor and even gives off some floral flavors as a bonus.

It's a cloudy beer with a spicy nose, but each sip establishes an expectation that I never taste. I expect this beer to round off and finish with coriander, cloves, and citrus. Instead, each sip finishes boozy and stunts my taste of the beer's spices. I tried drinking each bottle differently - opened and poured immediately, open and left sitting to air out a while, cooler, warmer, etc. - but each time the booze dominates the scene. Normally higher abv brews don't bother me (I'd rather a RIS over a stout), but here I'd rather have a witbier over this imperial one.

Unfortunately, the appearance, taste and mouthfeel all suffer in regards to the audacity of this move, and the end result seems like a regular old samuel adams plus liquor to create a beer that will intoxicate you faster and with less drinks. If that's your motive for enjoying beer, get it... but be wary; $12 for a 4 pack of any beer even at a high ABV for the sole purpose of drinking to get drunk is really not the most affordable way to go out; there's cheaper beer for people that enjoy that sensation.

It pours a hazy Clemson-auburn (why should Auburn be the only tiger-based school with a color, hm?) topped by a short-lived half-finger of white foam. The nose comprises mandarin oranges, lemon zest, light cardamom, and light toffee. Unfortunately for these elements, they're all covered by a thick fog of McCormick's vodka, plastic bottle and all. Sad, really. If it had meshed somewhat nicely, like a strong screwdriver or something, it would've been fine, but this is just too much. The taste is more of the same, with a bit more orange this time 'round (moving closer to a peel, though). It's just an overly boozy mess of a taste, just like the smell, but is somehow less astringent. I can't explain it, either.

Very long finish and slightly sweet. A little too sweet and stodgy in the mouth- particularly for any species of wit. A pleasant enough beer which although spiced like a wit doesn't give me the feeling at all of drinking a wit. The extra malt it took to get the beer up to ""Imperial"" strength pretty much eliminated the crisp, citrusy pleasures of a wit and created something else entirely- somewhere farther along the spectrum toward a dunkleweiss, at least as far as flavor and mouthfeel goes.

Goes down with a nice warm burn. The hoppy bitter of a Witbier is almost completely missing. This definitely has more of a rich, malty flavor, sweet and sugary. It may have a Witbier base, but this Imperial White is something unique. Like some others have said, it seems more characteristic of a Belgian Tripel than a Witbier.

It pours a cloudy amber with an orange cast and gold and brass highlights beneath a short head of creamy yellowed-white. The head retention is good and it leaves walls of tiny spots and streaks as it goes. However, for a beer with such a healthy dose of glutinous wheat, and so much malty girth it should be better. The nose is fruity, and rind-like. It's citrusy (lemon) and gently spicy. In the mouth it's medium-full and spritzy , or perhaps that's zesty - with so much body I'm not sure it can be 'spritzy', so, yes, zesty. The flavor is as the aroma suggests but much more full. The malt also steps up to the front. It's wheatish and sugary, and it suggests caramel, or at least darkened sugar amidst the fruitiness (apples, lemon, plum). In a way it makes me think of a warm oatmeal breakfast treat. Oats and cinnamon? - not quite, but along the same lines in a way. It's also interestingly more clove-like than coriander-ish. That must be from the yeast. It's interesting, rich, and satisfying. The alcohol never shows, although it probably helps to focus the finish; and the bitterness is balanced to work with the spiciness so that it off-sets the sweetness of the malt just enough, and then lets it finish dry with a swirl of spiciness. Full and rich, and somewhat complex. Worth trying.","NeroFiddled","May 14, 2009"

Surprising the taste is very short lived as the alcohol immediately dries the palette leaving a warm but vacuous aftertaste with a ghostly spiciness.

Overall this was actually pretty nice, which was surprising because I don't typically like witbiers that much. Perhaps my palate has just evolved? Either way, this beer had good flavor and huge body.

Smells faintly of oranges and bananas, nothing striking though not bad. Pours a dark orangish/amber color with a white head that dissipates quickly.. it basically resembles your average yuengling or such.. The taste is citrusy, the orange and coriander are certainly there but no where NEAR the presence they have in, say, DFH red&white.. Its fruity but a bit creamy as well, much more like a tripel than witbier, again: good not great. The mouth is surprisingly moderate and sort of thick.

Fruity sweet at first, with banana, nut, clove, pith, and a touch of citrus and some alcohol warming at the finish. Rich full body with moderate carbonation. A tasty smooth beer this is - a witbier or any sort of amped-up witbier this is not. Reminds me of a spiced hefeweizen.

Making a witbier stronger, atleast in this case, does nothing for the beer. The alcohol takes over and the mouthfeel is oily from it.

3.22,-6.7,3,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,"Not bad I guess. It has a lot of the characters of a wit (some lemon and spice), but this could probably be considered a tripel or something rather than an Imperial White ale. Too sweet and alcoholic for my tastes.","SaCkErZ9","Feb 26, 2009"

4,15.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability: For an Imperial White over 10%, I think many people may not realize how hard it is to make something with this much quality. This is an awesome sipper, and I like it for the winter more than summer. For the Hoegaarden fans, you're probably not going to like this. But I give Sam Adams props. I only got one bottle, but I may go back and get 4-pack after all. If you like the style, and like the bigger versions -- and there don't seem to many readily available -- you should definitely try it.","asabreed","Feb 25, 2009"
3.58,3.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"D- This really is an Imperial. It's very thick and heavy. You can't drink these like a regular witbier. A solid brew but one's enough for me.","JayNH","Feb 25, 2009"
3.82,10.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall impression: Interesting beer, its got a lot of the traditional flavors but richer and heavier. Drinkable, but the alcohol warming does get a bit much as it goes on.","rowew","Feb 24, 2009"

3.88,12.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours an orange yellow with decent initial head..good lacing. This bottle indicates 10.3 abv and it expresses itself in this manner. COuld this be classified as a wheat wine? Smell is barleywine-like with deep elements and a distinct alcohol presence. In the taste area malt, corainder, floral, almost roselike qualityies come through in a thick blend that includes a distinct alcohol presence. Like many strong brews, the subleties become more appaent upon warming. Mouthfeel is warming, slightly viscuous, very substantial. Definitely a sipper, drinkability beacomes better upon warming.","edchicma","Feb 24, 2009"
3.85,11.6,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Sam Adams Imperial White is a nice beer that is definitely worth trying, as I have never had anything quite like it. It has a nice appearance and aroma and a very interesting taste. The drinkability, however, is not that great. This is a nice beer to buy a 4-pack and split with three buddies because it has a nice taste and is definitely worth trying. Because of the harsh alcohol burn in the beer, though, it would be hard to have more than one or two of these.","BDIMike","Feb 23, 2009"

3.52,2,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Starts off smooth and alcohol oily. The flavors of wheat are muted. In fact, the most distinctive aspect is sour, citrus flavor. The aftertaste is all alcohol. Overall, not my cup of tea (or beer that is).","smcolw","Feb 22, 2009"
3.5,1.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Served in my Weihenstephaner glass. Poured a hazy orange with gold highlights around the edges when backlit. Quarter inch white head was embedded with tiny bubbles. Some strands of lacing were revealed on the tilt side of the glass. Nose was yeast, corriander, orange peel, bubblegum and bananna esters. Taste consistent with nose, but maltier than anticipated, as well as some booziness. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and lively with some slickness. In terms of drinkability, I've never had an imperial white. It was a decent brew and flavorful; however, not as refreshing as your typical witbier.","Jwale73","Feb 22, 2009"
3.63,5.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"D: Pretty drinkable, if the alcohol was masked more it would be a bit better, but overall this was something I never expected from Sam Adams, and I am glad they did this beer.","erosier","Feb 22, 2009"
3.57,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,3,"A wit should be more crisp. I understand this is a really big wit but it sort of misses the point. I wanted big flavor, lots of spice and citrus. This comes across too heavy and thick. Not enjoyable and not worth seeking out.","GilGarp","Feb 21, 2009"

3.82,10.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"D - To put ""imperial"" and ""witbier"" in the same sentence seems a bit paradoxical, but Sam Adams has managed to make such a thing quite drinkable. The noticable alcohol gets a little annoying after a bit but the rich flavors more than compensate. Probably not the crisp, refreshing beverage one will reach for after a day outside, but definitely a beer worth tasting and exploring.","PatrickJR","Feb 21, 2009"
3.82,10.7,3,3.5,4,4,4,"It's a drinkable brew. Not your typical belgian wheat by any means. It's better then I was expecting it to be. It's worth trying, and if you don't like it at first you may find yourself enjoying it more and more as you continue to drink it.","KBoudreau66","Feb 20, 2009"
4.18,21.2,5,4.5,4,4,4,"D- A surprisingly solid beer that doesn't really drink like it's 10.3%. Just as soon as I get used to and bored with Samuel Adams, something like this comes along. Try it.","david131","Feb 20, 2009"

3.83,11,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D: This beer was actually much sweeter then I expected and I am going to let two of them mature for a while before I try them again.

4.3,24.6,3.5,3.5,5,4.5,4,"As I got to know this beer more, I decided it was much more drinkable than I originally thought. It has a ton of flavor, but isn't excess in its impact on the pallate and gut. I've let it sit a bit and open up, and it still retains its initial enjoyment on each pull. I think it would be a knockout with hot chinese orange chicken.","LiquorLockerVP","Feb 14, 2009"

3.93,13.9,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"D: At 10.3% I would almost call this more of a wheatwine hybrid. It is boozy. I am enjoying it but the point of a wit is to sit on a hot day and have a few. Maybe they should market this as a winter wit.","aerozeppl","Feb 11, 2009"
3.58,3.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Imperial White's an intriguing beer. It's not bad, but it's far from great. The biggest problem is the alcohol. It's far too prevalent and too hot. If that could be worked out, it'd be dramatically improved. Perhaps the alcohol just needs to be 2% lower. It needs some work to say the least. But, it's definitely worth checking out.","prototypic","Feb 09, 2009"
4.2,21.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I grabbed a four back of this upon seeing it in the Beer Store beer cooler. I poured a bottle into a tulip glass. Maybe not the right glass, but I like that glass. The appearance is a dark orange and very cloudy. An aggressive pour leaves a half inch head that settle quickly, leaving a ring and some light foam behind. Some light lacing after the first sip. Smells wheaty and spicy with a noticable citrus aroma. Kind of a mild aroma, but well balanced. The taste starts out somewhat sweet, but the spicyness follows quickly, fading to a bitterness. Kind of a tangy bite to it. A very good tasting beer. Medium body and slightly sticky. Mild carbonation. This is real easy to drink. Kind of hard to believe this is 9%. I don't sense it at all. Overall this is a real nice beer that I'm sure I'll buy again.","mtbbaboon","Feb 09, 2009"
3.32,-3.8,4,4.5,2.5,4,3,"D - I'm not really a fan of witbiers. This is only the third that I've had I believe. It's much better than SA White Ale, but I find this a tad on the spicy side.","bowersdm","Feb 08, 2009"

3.69,7,3.5,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,"First impression: This doesn't hide the alcohol too well. Every sip is big and boozey. Big malt tastes with some dried fruit. A little bit of hops, in line with the rest of SA's beers. It also has a very medicinal cloying sense to it. The spicing isn't so detectable in the flavor as in the nose. Mouthfeel is big and coating, but the medicinal part of the coating detracts from it. A little too boozey to be anything more than a slow sipper right now, but this will make an interesting candidate for aging.","damienblack","Feb 05, 2009"
