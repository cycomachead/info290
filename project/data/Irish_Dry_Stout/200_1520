4.03,14.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch frothy tan head. Head retention is great, and there's a lot of lacing left on the glass, too. The brew smells like roasted malt, chocolate, and some coffee. Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, it's all roasted malt, coffee and bittersweet chocolate. There's also a nice roasty bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little slick and creamy with good carbonation. I think this brew is more like an Irish style stout than an American one. If you're looking for a good, easy drinking mostly bitter stout then this is a good choice. I bought a single bottle of this for $1.55, and I'd certainly consider buying a 6 pack of this in the future.

First impression was really just the perfect carbonation, great frothy and fluffy mouthfeel and just all around benefit to the palate. Lots of caramel flavors and again a bit of a smoked hint at the back. Small flavors of roasted nuits, chocolate and hints at black coffee. Very nice, but the mouthfeel was absolutly pefect. Light, balanced, a drinkers stout.","mikesgroove","May 13, 2011"

3.9,11.1,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Poured a deep dark muddy black with a huge frothy tan head that produced some really good lacing. The aroma was of dark roasted bread malts, a resin hop and a meaty yeast with notes of dark chocolate, coffee and molasses. It tasted a little bitter-sweet with a hint of molasses and chocolate at first and finished with a bitter coffee flavor that had a strong dark chocolate presence at the end. Mouthfeel was very full in body and nice, smooth and creamy texture with a flat carbonation.

4.12,17.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is black, with some dark brown highlights under light, and a light tan head that starts thick and frothy, but recedes to a decent half inch, tightly bubbled presentation. The beer is malty on the nose, with no other characteristics jumping out. The malt has notes of molasses and caramel, but very mild. Initial flavors are light, and ride through on a clean, crisp body. There are flavors heavy on chocolate, with strong backgrounds of coffee and dark, sweet malt. Well balanced with bitter and sweet flavors. Body is smooth and crisp at the same time, never overpowering and alway complementary of the flavors. The beer transitions to a quick, smooth, and clean finish. The aftertaste is similar to melting a chocolate bar in half a cup of coffee. Very tasty, and very pleasant. Easy to drink with almost anything in terms of food.","GarthDanielson","Feb 15, 2011"

The mouthfeel is full bodied with a minimal carbonation and semi-dry finish. Drinkability is decent, I wish I had a different bottle to try, minus the metallic smell/taste.","gmfessen","Apr 06, 2008"

Aromas of licorice, dark roasty malt, slight chocolate, cocoa powder and a little dark fruit, no hop aroma. On the palate, it opens up to be a blend of roasted malt, chocolate, dark prune and raisin. It finishes dry, roasty bitterness and very clean, with a slight wateriness, which is okay for 5% abv.

Good combination. Low apparent carbonation, although there is a touch of carbo sharpness in the first bit of the taste. Nice medium-to-thick body. Astringency really lingers. Good drinkability.

Very bready and big, with some light brothy yeast. It has a medium-full body, lightly syrupy texture and moderate carbonation. This is a very enjoyable beer.

4.03,14.8,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pretty good stuff; it just gets swallowed up by the bigger, bolder, and richer American Stouts out there. It's got the nearly opaque black / ruby hue with a dainty silk-like head and lacing. A solid, albeit tame, roasted malt flavor with a supporting, but not overwhelming, sweetness. In fact, the malts seem to balance out the bitterness that is supplied by the burned grains and the American Hops. I appreciate it that the hops are tightly controlled, not to dominate the Stout. The body is where the beer shines--great creaminess without nitro. Silky texture without being thick or chewy. Thins toward the finish without becomming watery. Finishes quite dry and with a pleasant charcoal-like powderyness(Irish Dry Stout). Alcohols remain consistant and muted. A beautiful beer that probably gets little respect.","BEERchitect","Apr 03, 2006"

My first whiff was a strong and unbalanced mix of alcohol and coffee, but after it breathed for a few seconds it was significantly mellowed and some floral and fruity smells came through. Strong bitter, dark and burnt malts are my first impression followed by some aggressive hopping. Sweetness lingers throughout. Medium bodied with a bitter and slightly boozy finish.

So let's start with what matters. The taste.... Disapointing. As few have mentioned already, this falls short. I did like the peety smoke taste you find in a scotch but no wow factor.

The charred flavor is definitely present in the flavor, and the sweetness unfortunately takes a backseat. I would not call the flavor particularly bold.

The mouthfeel was very smooth and silky, heavy bodied, and tasted softly of cocoa and mocha. I also noticed a coppery, metallic taste but it was really, really tiny - maybe just my imagination. The aftertaste was balanced out with a crisp hop bitterness, not too much however. The drinkability is surpisingly high, this beer just seemed to meld with my tastebuds well, very soft and balanced.

But hardly any head formed at all, very disappointing. I poured it kind of roughly too. But then the aroma kicked in and made up for it in a way. It's a wonderful mix of dark fruits, molasses, milky sweetness, and roastiness. Just as the label says, this is a crisp and refreshing stout. There's not much of a coating and thick type of feel to it. It's medium bodied and crisp. The flavors don't really live up to the aroma though. I tasted mostly roastiness and hops. It's not unpleasant by any means, very smooth actually. I was yearning for something more to come out of the flavor though. I enjoyed the hoppy and crisp finish and the hoppy aftertaste. This is a stout worth trying. It's not gonna knock your socks off, but it'll make 'em loose. I feel that the drinkability and aroma are the best qualities.","AudioGilz","Mar 11, 2003"

Solid sheets of lace are left in its wake. Aroma is akin to a Mackeson XXX Stout....sweet vanilla, light molasses, moderate fruity esters, and bittersweet chocolate. Mouthfeel is thin and dry, with a light to medium body. Taste starts out with an astringent bite of chocolate malt, fades into a brief metallic note, followed by thin black patent and roasted barley with a moderately sweet backbone, ending in a highly astringent, lightly grainy crystal malt/french-roast coffee/oak flavor with some slightly rubbery bittering hops and more metallic notes when licking the gums. The alcohol is slightly perceptable. Drinkability is decent despite the bone-dry finish. Not a bad beer, but likened to a Diet Mackeson XXX Stout + oak chips. If you like Sinebrychoff Porter, then you may like this, with it's dry, woody finish and lighter body.","Mitchster","Mar 06, 2003"

The nose is metallic which is kind of repulsive but the rest of the beer is quite good. It is almost black in color but a little bit of red shines through at the bottom of the glass. The hop combination is quite appealing to me and mixes well with the roasted, smoky taste. As I moved through the beer I picked up a few hints of coffee and toast. This stout has a chewy characteristic to its mouthfeel which I find to be quite good. There is also a slight sweetness that is barely detectable. All things considered, this is a really good beer aside from the nose. The taste is complex. The hops are great. I will definitely have this again.","Maestro","Feb 27, 2003"

The taste was initially a blend of coffee and chocolate, and then nicely moved to the malts. A slight spicy after taste was present that finished off nice and dry.

3.3,-6,4,4,3,3,3,"Virtually black and opaque, w/ a hint of deep garnet when held to light.  Thick, slowly receding, dark tan large bubbled head leaves coarse lace.  The uniquely fruity aroma is combination of lightly tart esters, roasted barley, and caramel sweetness w/ subdued notes of chocolate malt.  Unfortunately fruity esters carry a bit too strongly into the flavor profile, and partially mask black patent and chocolate contributions.  Buttery diacetyl and light caramel sweetness dominate once the fruitiness fades, and this stout is left a tad one dimensional.  Lightly bodied.  Finishes dry w/ a hint of black malt sharpness and fruity tartness fading abruptly.  Black Hawk is an interesting stout, but was lacking in malt character.  Its fruitiness makes trying it worthwhile.","marc77","Aug 26, 2002"

4,14,4,4,4,4,4,"I didn't findjust a plain stout catagory, it is not really sweet, nor is it a dry stout. It is someplace in the middle. It is just a good solid stout.","mattmaples","Sep 15, 2001"
