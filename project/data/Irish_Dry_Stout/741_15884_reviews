"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a 1/2 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt, cocoa nibs, and slight coffee. Taste is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, and slightly sour dark fruit. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel but pretty thin mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good Irish style stout but the mouthfeel is a bit lacking in my opinion."

"O: Not impressed with this stout and I was excited to try this. Unrefined and sloppy. Smell was decent but taste was not enjoyed."
""
"O: A solid beer to style, nothing more. Price is good, for a drinkable pint, this would be a good choice."
""
""
"O: Not a bad stout. Goes down pretty easy."

"Served from bottle into a sampler shaker. Poured a massively dark brown with a one finger tan head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cream, and roasted malt. The flavor was of roasted malt, cream, earth, and subtle toasted malt. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. This brew really didn't wow in any way, but it was quite easy to drink and a good representation of the style. This one felt to have more of a toasted flavor to it as compared to roastiness which is typical in most brews. This was a welcomed change. Worth trying if you have not had it before and like the style or are just curious."

"Overall â€“ not a bad tasting brew at all, and somewhat interesting to consider."
""
"Overall, this is one of those beers that may not score well on any one category while reviewing, but it just goes down way too easily. I could drink this all day long, but nothing really stands out. It's lacking just a bit of quality in all areas but it tastes good enough to easily enjoy."
"O - This is a nice Irish Dry Stout. Another solid brew from Lakefront."
""
""
""
"O - Get Guinness outta the way, Snake Chaser is clearly a better Irish Stout. Locking in superior flavor with smooth drinkability, one better keep track of how many pints of this they put down on St. Patty's Day! If at all possibly, shoot for a Lakefront tour and try this on the nitro tap!"

"The mouth feel is decent, it could be a little less filmy, but other than that fine. I enjoyed this offering and would certainly pick it up again."
""

"12 oz bottle poured into a Sam Adams glass. Adequate head, a bit thin on the lacing. Smokey malt aroma, a bit of bacon in there as well. Taste is smokey, a bit of playdough, with bacon. Mouthfeel is too thin and pretty light on the carbonation for the style. I had low expecations with this one but this was actually better than I'd figured. Not quite as in-your-face as American styled stouts but more of a Irish sessionable stout."
""
""
"If this isn't a bad bottle, then this is not a very good beer. The nose is really quite nice, but the rest of the beer fails to live up to it. I'll pass on this one."
"Poured dark brown opaque with a half finger of tan head that faded quickly with zero lacing. Smells malty, heavily roasted, some grain as well. Taste was sour, but not tart. Hard to place. Under-ripe dark fruit perhaps sour plums. Roasted malt. Dry. Mouthfeel was creamy but quite dry. Roasted elements linger on the finish. The first few sips were okay, but it got annoying after a while."
"O) I'm a pretty big fan of Lakefront Brewery, but this is likely the last time I drink me some Snake Chaser."
"Dark brown, tanned head is quite thin and leaves almost no lace. Aroma is super clean with notes of brown malt and brewing salts. Slight medicinal component. Flavor finally includes a hint of roasted malt but no more. Still fairly strong aspirin taste. Happily the mouthfeel is medium and this is easy to drink if seriously uninteresting. Even more of a lightweight than your typical Irish stout."
"Bitterwseet roasted coffee and chocolate, a very good taste for the style in a thin beer; it worked well for me as a summer stout. Winter comes, I cannot have this."
"O - Although not bold or exciting, this is a really well put together stout that I highly recommend. Great session stout."
"D: Decent level of drinkability, wouldn't turn down a second and actually started liking this the more I continued to drink it. Grows on you."
"Overall, a very well done beer, maybe a touch sweet or creamy for exactly this style, but I still like it."
"A true to style Irish stout from good 'ol Lakefront in Brewaukee, WI. Although it pours a tad thin, still very appealing with great aromatic qualities. For a lighter body, some great tones of roast malts, mild hops, coco, coffee, and a hint of mint. Very enjoyable Dry stout from Lakefront!"
"Overall I wasn't preparing for much from this beer and that's basically what I got. The flavors are too muddled and seem off in general. Not worth seeking out and I'm not sure I'd have a glass even if offered."
"Overall a very easy to drink Irish Stout. I've has this beer a million times at the brewery. Yet this was my first time in a bottle."
"D: Overall decent beer. A little too much carbonation to keep drinking more."
"A good mix of hops and sweetness in the initial taste. Both will subside throughout the bottle. Not complex, gets easier to drink, could be called watered down, sure. But its not pretentious, and it has still the ample body to make up for the backslide downbottle. Great price on these."
"The body is a little thin for the style. Carbonation level is moderate. I'd like a bit more ""chew"" to this. This has great flavor though! Nice bittersweet chocolate, a little char in the middle, and finishes dry and slightly tart. I for one, really enjoyed this one. This was a great beer."
"Poured into a shaker pint. Poured a clear deep dark brown, almost black with red highlights and a big creamy head that hangs around a long time with very good lacing that slides back into the glass. Slight roasted malt aroma. Burnt malt taste with small hints of chocolate and a slight sour finish. Very easy to drink and smooth. Not bad."
"Overall, I can't drink more than one of these, but I don't know if this is because of a bad bottle or if this is how this beer is supposed to taste. Either way, I'd like to try this again in the future to see if it was in fact a bad beer or if this is how this one is made. Looking back on other reviews, it seems that others are enjoying the same conundrum. If you want an interesting flavor experience, pick it up and see if it's a sour stout or an infected stout."
"Pours black in color with some reddish brown hues when held up to the light. Nicely tanned head more than 2 fingers strong and quite a bit of lacing on the glass. Nose is a burnt grain mixture with some, chocolate, coffee, smoke and mild citrus and metallic twang in the finish. Taste is metallic with quite a solid citrus presence from the hops. Also picking up on yeast in the taste along with some smoke character. The taste is actually a disappointment from what the nose led on. Most of the characteristics of the aroma only show up in a mild way in the lingering finish of this beer."
"Pours a dark black color. No head and therefore no retention and no lacing. Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, chocolate, slight grass, and some earthy nut. Fits the style of an Irish Dry Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and watery with a low carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, and slight toffee. Overall, not very complex, watery, and poor appearance."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a small head. Smell is of chocolate and malts. Taste is malty with some notes of chocolate finishing a tad bitter. Feels creamy in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a fairly good beer."
"Pours a five finger light brown head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Totally black color, no highlights. Light chocolate nose. Light carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Flavor is a medicinal chocolate, unusual, expecting a dry stout like Guinness. $1.80 for a 12oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Ok, drinkable, but overall it feels more like some pallid offering from a macro brewer than something produced by a craft brewer."
"Served on-tap at Lakefront Brewery in Milwaukee, WI. Pours a black body with a tight, dark khaki head. Aroma of roasted malt and cream. Medium bodied with dark roasted malt flavors and a bit of creamy mouthfeel, light carbonation. One of my favorite Irish Stouts. I wonder how it would taste on a nitro-tap."
"While easy to drink, once one overcomes the sweetness, this beer simply falls below the bar. Given all the great session beers out there, this one gets chalked up as a nice try."
"Drainpour."
" ~ I like this brew and I like the brewer even better. Even if you've never been lucky enough to try this serpent I suggest you better get to Milwaukee and treat yourself to a brewery tour. The tour they offer will undoubtedly be at the top of your tour list."
"Drinkability: This may not have been the freshest sample, so I have marked it up a bit higher than what I am tasting; nevertheless, I suspect this is a rather unremarkable attempt at the style"
"Very interesting combination of flavors but I like it."
"This beer pours jet black with a thick tan head that leaves a nice lace. The aroma is moderately roasty and a bit ashy. The flavor is moderately roasty with a pronounced mineral-like flavor and finish. The beer finishes rather dry with a bit of an acidic bite. The body is medium as is carbonation. Overall I think this beer isn't bad, but misses the mark with distracting mineral-like flavor and acidic bite."
"All in all a nice, enjoyable stout."
"M/D - Light to medium bodied, a touch thinner than I like. Easy drinking, but not an interesting beer at all."
"Drinkability: A bit forgettable. A passable dry stout, I suppose, but it comes up far, far short in overall character and complexities."
"Dark brown, no head and no lacing. Served in a Guinness pint. Aroma of dry chocolate and light roastiness with a hint of caramel. Flavor is definitely on the dryer side with notes of cola, grape, chocolate and light caramel. Body needs some imporving, carbonation is very light. Not a bad Dry Irish Stout, per se, but not very good either."
"This was a nasty, overpowering smokey, harsh beer that I would not get near again."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is a dark brown, almost oil like consistency. The head is light brown and about 1/2 inch think, but doesn't last long and doesn't leave much of a cap and no lacing to speak of. The aroma is of chocolate, toffee, yeast, and some mild roasted malts. There is a burnt smell that lingers. The taste is over powered with that same burnt smell. There is a decent creamy consistency and the carbonation is good, but something is off about this brew. The taste doesn't quite match the style. A little more sweetness would balance it out better. A decent brew, but nothing to write home about."
"D- Not my favorite Irish Stout, but a decent one nonetheless. Low alcohol and good flavor make this a good session choice. After your palate is deadened to the sourness, this one goes down easy."
"I'd drink this stuff all day long. Cheers to Lakefront. Another great beer!"
"a great way to conclude the tour. definately recommend it."
"This is a thick beer but I love thick beers so I could easily put back a few of these in a night. If you fill up easy or like lighter beers this wouldn't be for you, obviously."
"The color is dark amber with a tint of red. The nose is a nice roasted malts with hints of toffee and coffee, notes of hops and yeast. The taste is sorta muted. the nose provided more than the taste. The beer seem watery and faint a clean and easy finish. overall it is okay"
"I let it warm quite a bit, thining maybe the cold was causing this. There was some improvement, but not even closing to making this a tasty beer. This one became a drain pour after about 4 ounces."
"Snake Chaser looks pretty tasty as the solidly black body sits below a tan head. The aromas are chocolate, espresso, and a good roastiness. The taste is pleasing with a good charred character, dark bitter chocolate. Slight hop bittering in the finish. The mouthfeel and body are slightly lighter than I would appreciate in this beer. For a good sessionable irish stout, this will do. Snake Chaser is nothing to rave about, but worth a try."
"Beware of this batch if you come upon it. Unless you want something really different."
"Not what I was expecting, but not bad overall."
"The taste is weakest quality and is mostly turned plums, vinegar, steak sauce, and coffee with an extemely faint hint of choclate. It's very sour. The feel is slightly silky and pretty good. In the end, this is one-sided and unpleasant, almost undrinkable to me."
"Pours an inky black color with a good coarse head that eventually settles to a fine ring. Smells of roasted light coffee. Light mouth feel. Good roastedness, light to little hop presence. Good representation of the style. Aftertaste is okay. Wish I could say more."
"Don't drink and review."
"A 12oz bottle, with bottled 1st week of March on the label. Poured into a pint glass, this beer was black in color with a medium-sized tan head. Tiny bit of lacing. It had a predominately coffee aroma, with a little bit of chocolate. Taste followed aroma, although I got more of a bittersweet chocolate sense in the taste. Fairly dry, nice enough beer."
"My hopes got dashed on this one. I'd give it another try in the future to see if the taste was from some type of oxidation, but I think this just isn't my cup of stout."
"What seemed like a promising brew, will become a drain pour after I complete this review. Possibly a bad bottle, but definitely not an old one. Disappointing."
"12oz bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours an opaque black body with a half inch of tan head. Smells roasty, with hints of coffee, chocolate, and a suggestion of date. Tastes roasty - baker's chocolate and coffee along with nut toward the finish. Medium to full mouthfeel with moderate carbonation that helps keep this an easy drinker. One of the tastiest dry stouts I've had thus far. I'm impressed."
"D: A good Irish Stout... its balance is the key and will make this beer more sessionable"
"Not a bad brew, but I can't say I'll be searching it out again anytime soon. I'd recommend it to try, but I believe you'll come to the same conclusion. Paired nice with some gruyere though."
"A miss, but not by much. Can't recommend."
"drinkability is great. this is not a heavy brew, nor is it overpowering. the flavors may be too bold for certain drinkers, but fans of the style can rejoice in a pint of Snake Chaser. another classic from Lakefront. cheers!"
"Not a bad representation of the style just not one of my favorite."
"Not a bad representation of the style, but not really to my taste. A little too one dimensional with respect to the roast flavors."
"Not at the top of my dry stout list..."
"Very easy to drink. Could be a nice session beer."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours black with 1 cm initial head that is off white and diminishes quickly. Smells lightly of chocolate and coffee, overall sweet. The initial taste is sweet and ends mildly bitter. Light carbonation and kind of watery. Almost no aftertaste."
"M: heavy on the carbonation and a bit thin"
"Overall, this is a decent Irish stout."
"The Snake Chaser Irish Stout is a decent beer that is certainly worth a try. Its tightly formed tan head sits on top of a deep dark brown body. It looks like something familiar, but the taste is much less conventional than I expected. I couldn't pick up much off the nose; both bottles that I sampled gave off only an occasional whiff of roasted malt. Medium-light bodied with a moderate dose of fine carbonation that adds to the balance of this beer. Initial light roasted malt flavors are quickly subdued by hop bitterness and a touch of acidity. Coffee with a dash of unsweetened chocolate combines with a mostly dry finish. I found this stout easy to drink and would expect this to be a much better beer off a fresh tap or cask."
"Beer poured black with a 4 finger head initially that is down to nothing 5 minutes after opening. Nose is somewhat sweet with nothing else noticeable. Taste is sweet from the malts, with a hint of chocolate, and is nicely balanced by a dry hop. Mouthfeel is very smooth although a bit thin for the style. Drinkability is good. This is a nice representation of the style that it worth a try,"
"Tasted: 04/08/07"
"I had one of these the other day. I came back for a second today. I am not much of a stout person, but I had two. That is saying a lot for me. So I would say this is a very drinkable beer for the style."
"Pours nearly black with a thick, medium tan head that retains well. Sheets of lacing in the pint glass. Nose is of dark roasted malts, baker's chocolate and espresso. The palate is a well-balanced blend of roasted/burnt malt flavors a solid dry hop backbone. Has a slightly bitter flavor, reminiscent of a scorched malt. Mouthfeel is light to medium and finished very dry. Gets better as it warms, opening up the flavors a bit. A good example of the dry stout style, I think."
"D. I was surprised to find this a satisfying sipping beer, although I in general I would limit myself to one. (I might end up in an uncontrolled pucker)."
"Nice caramel head that dissipates rather quickly on top of a coal-like black brew. Nose is a suble, smokey/sweet mix. Nothing too special yet. Once I started drinking this I realized what a quality stout this is. Creamy, but not too this, this has a near-perfect mix of flavors for the style: smokey malts, black coffee, and dark caramel. A little tinge of alcohol on the tongue and a slight carbonation just add to the enjoyment. Not terribly heavy for a stout and much easier to drink than most stouts."
"As stouts go, this one is a real winner. Incredibly rich, almost black in the glass with a small head (this is no Guinness in the foam department); all smoky malt in the nose. Decent mouthfeel and very fresh-tasting for a stout. A touch sweet on the tongue, then the smoky malts kick in (almost a porter-rich taste) but the overall flavor is balanced with a bit (tiny bit) of fruity hops that kicks in a nice bitterness in the end and makes the beer overall extremely drinkable. Excellent."
"The taste is similar, with notes of coffee, dark chocolates, and dark fruits coming through. All in all this is quite a tasty stout, although it seems more American than Irish. A minor sore spot I have with this brew is the mouthfeel, which is on the thin side and a bit too carbonated for my liking. Still, this beer is incredibly drinkable, and a nice beer for a cold day. Solid."
"Such a hefty sour zap sets this stout apart. Interesting. And, boy, does it smell good."
"When I was in third grade Ms. Weinberg used to put a bear on her desk on the certain days that she was grouchy and would warn us, ""Don't cross me when the bear is out."" These were days when she would deliver fatal blows to students: ""This is the worst handwriting I've ever seen. Go home tonight and practice until you can write in perfect cursive."" I wish Lakefront Brewery had a bear to put out on their bottles to indicate when a brew is a dirty little imitator. They are so hit and miss for a microbrew that it is almost confounding how decent one beer tastes as compared to another's blandness. Luckily this one isn't one of the bad ones. It delivers a reasonable dark stout flavor with a hint of sweetness. No kissing the urine soaked Blarney stone here."
"THE BLOODHOUND FACTOR: Peaches seemed interested in the tartness, but ultimately found it unappealing. Benjie didn't find it at all."
"Overall impression: Not a bad Irish stout - nice to see American brewers making this highly drinkable style."
"This brew pours a solid black color. The head is one-finger in height, tan, and had an off-white ring around the top along the edge of the glass. The aroma is roasted and chocolate malts with a hint of graham cracker in the background. It is quite aromatic for an Irish Style Stout. The taste does not disappoint either. It is nothing overpowering or big, but it is a bit more than is expected from a small stout. Lots of roasted malt shows though up front with a touch of chocolate in the back ground. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with nice carbonation. It could be a little smoother though, but it isn't bad. Overall, this is one of the better Irish Stouts I have had the pleasure of trying. I would certainly choose this over Guinness anyday."
"Overall: Not bad. A bit light for my tastes and a bit too bitter on the finish and aftertaste. Worth a try at least."
"I can drink it down just fine, but will not return to it after this 6 pack is over and done."
"Pours with an incredibly black body, not a hint of light gets through. Head is also very dark tan foam. Smell has good coffee tones to it, but also slightly musty, like wet dog. Taste is clean and crisp, good coffee flavors ending in a nice hop finish. The off scent doesn't translate into the beer at all. A decent stout, if not underwhelming."
"A decent enough beer but nothing I would seek out again...."
"Re-try in 2005 has me thinking more positive things about this beer, especially the tangy smoke qualities and body being much richer (and sweeter) than I experienced before."
"Almost black. Not quite. Nice looking thin, creamy brown head. Lacing comes in nice, big sheets. Nice aroma of blackened malts, bittersweet chocolate and a little smoke. The body of this beer is medium at best. A little light. Carbonation is just a little too prickly. Taste is decent, but reserved. Nuttiness and roasted malt characteristics are too subtle. This one is not bad. Just not much better than average."
"What is going on, Lakefront?"
"Cocoa coffee malt first sniff, nice dark chocolate coffee taste, a little sweeter than most Irish stouts, feels very thin on the palate, chocolate taste lingers on but weakens as you go along. If its your first stout of the day it's a great beer, it'll come down a couple notches if its your second or third because of it's thinness."
"The drinkability factor is high here, particularly for those who like their stouts roasted and dry as a bone. Any fan of Guinness will be a fan of Snake Chaser. Slainte!"
"I enjoyed Lakefront's newest beer and am glad they continue to experiment with new styles."
"The beer poured a slick 50 black liquid that gave rise to smoth creamy top. I can smell the burnt grains/malt along with hints of coffe/chocolate. The brew seems to have a little more carbination that your typical stout and perhaps this is why the mouthfeel is a little thinner than the average stout. Unlike other stouts I think I could have this with dinner and be able to drink this bottle and few more without feeling bloated. I wonder how this brew would taste through a nitro-tap."
"Snake Chaser pours black in color with some dark mahogany highlights near the bottom of the glass. Finger thick creamy tan head reduces to a surface covering that lingers throughout most of consumption. Aroma consists of roasted malt, roasted coffee, with hints of sweet cocoa as the beer warms and just a touch of caramel. Very pleasant. The mouthfeel is thinner to medium-bodied with some coarse carbonation. Flavors of roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate upfront. Dryness starts in the middle. Smooth burnt malt and roasted coffee flavors round out the dry lingering finish. Flavor is very full and satisfying. The dryness is classic for an Irish Stout. Very well done. A 'must-have' for St. Patrick's Day."
"Worth a try from the singles cooler at least. I know some people like this kind of taste."
"Very bitter dry chocolate, coffee and licorice were all around the flavor profile. My only problem was that the minimal hop presense was barely enough to balance the finish let alone the entire beer."
