3.84,7.9,4,3.75,3.75,4,4,"Overall, this is a beer I really like, but I can understand why Boulevard might be discontinuing it. I see it as a better version of Guinness, but I also don't drink the style terribly often, so I'm not a reliable consumer. And I have a feeling most regular Guinness drinkers would just assume stick with their favorite. It's a tough spot for Boulevard to be in, hence the discontinuation. I'll miss Dry Stout, but there are so many other Boulevard beers that I'd be much sadder to see disappear.","LambicPentameter","Nov 12, 2013"

So any recent bottle reviews have been aged (send some my way!). Very aggressive settling. Faint nose of chocolate and coffee. Tastes of a quality but uncomplicated dry stout. Light-bodied and crisp, with a dry finish. In the vein of Guinness, but a bit dryer. Like I said, wish it was more available outside of local bars and restaurants.","tito42","Jun 30, 2013"

More patent malt like than anything else. Almost smokey aroma. Nice. Flavor falls a bit flat, but is nice nonetheless. Kind of light, very roasty, light coffee flavor. Kind of nice. Mouthfeel is definitely too light. It is not dry, it just feels watery. Could use more carbonation to bring out some of the dryness. Overall this beer is fine. Its ok, and could use a few different things to improve it, but definitely a nice beer.","Agold","Dec 01, 2011"

The aroma of this beer is flat. Definite notes of dark malts and a bit of chocolate, but not a whole lot and definitely no notes of dark fruits or coffee that is so typical to the style. The flavor is also just pretty bland. A bit of roasted grains, mixed with some coco powder. That's really all that comes to mind. The mouthfeel is the worst attribute of the beer. This beer is dry. Probably the driest stout I have ever had and it completely lacks the creaminess that makes the style so enjoyable. This is, in my opinion, the worst of the year round beers that Boulevard does.

The flavor is richer with espresso, dark chocolate, and deep roasted barley. The feel is nice and roasty, but just a toast too astringent.

Subtle caramel flavors mix with almond to create a flavored coffee affect that helps pull off a just above average flavor score.

The taste follows closely with the aroma, being a little on the weak side. The taste was also dominated by a light roasted malt flavor, with very little coffee/chocolate flavor as expected. This being in the dry Irish stout style, I expect it to be lighter in flavor, but not quite this light. Clean smooth mouthfeel and finish. Definitely a sessionable beer.

Yielded about a finger and a half of creamy, light brown head with a vigorous pour. Head somewhat quickly dissipated into a thin ring of lace in the glass. Smell: Aromas of roasted malts, a slight layer of black licorice, a small hint of semi-sweet chocolate, with just a little bit of smoke in the background. Not a very strong nose, but not too bad. Flavor was comparable to the smell. The bitter semi-sweet chocolate flavor hits the tongue first, followed by the black licorice, and any smokey notes in the back. Finishes pretty dry as the name implies. A bit over carbonated in my opinion. A somewhat thin mouthfeel that had an almost chalky feel to it. None of the 5.2 percent alcohol was present.

Aroma is classic stout, but not anything special, with really just roasted malts and no other hints or flavors. Taste is a little more appealing, roasty and a mild hint of coffee grounds, a nice dry finish, but still lacking a bit. The mouth isn't really that full, a little too thin, and entirely too carbonated with little creaminess to balance carbonation out. For me, this started out good, but every successive bottle I drink leaves me yearning for more and more again. Bummer.","objectivemonkey","Beers"

But a good coffee bean dry with some hints of cotton balls. Plenty of tootsie roll-like chocolate mixed with some deep roasted and surprisingly smoked malts. By surprisingly I mean that I wasn't expecting that much smokey flavor. Of a dry palate at the finish. But if I would let the taste linger for about five minutes, the feeling is one of great refreshment.","scruffwhor","0"

This beer does pretty well for a light bodied stout and comes across as a pretty tasty session beer.

The taste brings some of the roastiness forward, but again not much and if it weren't for the aftertaste, I'd have to question whether or not I was drinking a macro's attempt at a stout. The mouthfeel is that of a lighter-bodied stout. Again, average, but nothing remarkable. Drinkable? Yes. this is more of a session beer than anything.

Smells are of chocolate and coffee with some sweet caramel, too. Combined, they make molasses, I guess. Smells very sweet and creamy, almost oatmeal stoutish. If there are hops in the aroma, Im guessing Fuggles. Tastes coffee to start which fades gently to a late chocolate. Sour cherries in the end, too. Thats about it. Not much to say, as theres not much here. If theres any hop bitter, its blended into or hidden by the medium-heavy carbonation (more than I want in a stout). Medium bodied with a dry finish and a roasted roughness left on my tongue after the swallow.

The aroma features a bit of roasted malt and then hits you with a nice malty, grainy note. The flavor is very well balanced with a good blend of malt, roasty sharp bitterness, and back-of-the-tongue hop notes as well. It may have been a little less dry than I expected, although this is hardly a dig on the beer. The body was nice and full. Overall an excellent drinkable beer.","KroMagnon","Aug 20, 2004"

Aroma: Dark roasts consume most of the aromatics but there is a great herbal hop profile that must be noted seems very fresh with almost a hint of chocolate mint. Not a lot of mint just leaves that impression on me in a good way. Taste: Perfect example of a dry Irish stout creeps on the palate with decently robust dark roasts leaving a lingering dryness on the palate, however this one contains a nice splash of hop character bringing out some mildly earthy and herbal notes very nice. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied brew carbonation settles nicely not overbearing in anyway a very smooth brew in my opinion.

It's a thinner, easier drinking "session" stout compared to thicker, chewier stouts like {insert any stout name here}, but I like that. On tap, Dry Stout at least has SOME toasty stout-like flavors. In the bottle, none. To me, this is the flattest, most tasteless stout I've ever had.

Richer in body than draught Guinness, but roasted barley contributions are lacking.  Roasted grain bitterness manages to eek its way into the finish.
