3.93,4,4.5,4,4,3,4,"Strong, smoky aroma has notes of coffee and molasses and a hint of unsweet chocolate. Pours a dark-chocolate brown with a VERY thick light tan head, lets a peak of light in only at the very bottom. Lip-smacking flavor has caramel, molasses, coffee and unsweet chocolate notes with a hint of hop bitterness and another of honey sweetness; the last two balance each other nicely. Body seems to be on the thin side, and fizz leaves a bit to be desired. Overall, though, a good Porter - not really plain.","Cyberkedi","Oct 07, 2012"

4.16,10.1,4,3,4.5,5,4.5,"Just had this twice on tap at The Porterhouse at Fraunces Tavern in New York City (@ Broad st & pearl st). A dark black porter with a beautiful inch of rich head formed of tiny bubbles (nitro). Smell is slightly acidic and alcoholy. The head is as creamy as it looks and the dark malty notes of the mid-body perfectly balance the richness of the porter. There is classic British hop bittering and tasty minerality to the finish. In short this is the best porter I have ever had. If you are in lower Manhattan you should definitely try this amazing beer.","xterra48","Jun 06, 2012"
3.91,3.4,3,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"O - A decent beer, one that I've found to be much beter in the bottle than on nitro-tap as it's served in the Porterhouse bar, and since I live near the brewery, it's one I sample often!","Eramen","Jun 03, 2012"

3.68,-2.6,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Showed up last year for the first time ever, I think their pull tab caps are pretty interesting I've never seen anything else like them. I had the Wrasslers XXXX Stout and Porterhosue Red last year, neither were stellar but both solid in their own regards. Here's the Plain Porter, forms a dark cola coloa nearly opaque let's reddish ruby highlights shine through around the edges. Billowing tan khaki head forms nicely with big chunky layered lacing. Aroma almost dirty earthiness with dark dry roasted nearly burnt malts coming through, maybe a hint of lingering butterscotch well hidden in the matrix. Nice cereal grains entrenched within the malts going on feeling very natural and well developed within the true Irish brewing tradition. As it warms up a nice cocoa powder tone arises along with some layered complexities that weren't initially there as it warmed up. Flavor is dry throughout, alcohol flavor more evident than it should be in a beer that's literally 5.0% abv. I'm not sold on the flavor the hops used in the bittering additions are over the top it doesn't let the malts and semi sourdough bread tones shine well enough. Dark roasted mint/herbal tones hidden in the earthy complex dark chocolate tones. Mouthfeel is fuller bodied with enough balls to stand up to any American stout or porter. Overall a classic drinking Irish beer that should be more widespread than it currently is, these guys aren't extreme for the sake of being extreme, their just trying to be flavorful with all of their styles in a mass market Guiness/Murphy's/Beamish driven culture.","WVbeergeek","Nov 18, 2011"

4.23,11.9,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,5,"One topic that comes up now again is how to clearly separate a porter from a stout. Until now, my reference beer for porter was Sam Smith's, but this Plain Porter has now become my defining example for the style. I had this on draught at the Parliament Street Porterhouse. It is a deep brown/black with the barest ruby glow. The head is a thick medium brown and quite persistent. The dark malts star in this brew, and keep on the chocolate part of the spectrum without getting the roasted grain edge. It is an easy drink that has the complexity to maintain your interest through several pints.","MillRat","Mar 14, 2006"

3.26,-13.8,4,3,3.5,3,3,"This Porterhouse offering came out dark black color with the velvety tan head. Roasted aromas with coffee standing out a bit more. There's also a sweet fruit element with some residual sugar taste in the backdrop. Flavor repeats itself. Coffee flavors are noticeable and somewhat earthy and bitter. The sweetness is chocolate like and maybe even raisiny. A smoky dry finish. Body is not quite as creamy as I was hoping for and on the thinnish side. A solid beer with some flavor to it. But the flavors didn't really do it for me personally. One pint and I was ready to move on.","granger10","Nov 18, 2004"
4.11,8.7,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"M&D: smooth on the mouthfeel and medium-bodied, it retains the creamy fizz to be lively enough to be a quaffable beer.

4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Dark black with a small white head of foam that lasted and left nice lacing. Aromas are of roasted malts, a bit of vanilla and caramel, coffee, and chocolate.
