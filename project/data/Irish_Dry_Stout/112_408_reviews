"Solid all around, and very affordable for the quality if purchased as a sixer at World Market. It is a perfect enhancer for all manly meals--pizza, curries, grilled burgers or sausages, pasta with red sauce. In an ideal world, this would be the basic stout served everywhere, with premium stouts offered where there are lots of taps. I enjoy drinking these North Coast brews that have no faddish flavorings but are simply beautiful products of a remarkable brewer who is an artist with the basics."

"Kinda sweet for a stout for me, but could be good for people that have only had a guiness."
"12 oz bottle.  Pours black with tall, long lasting, creamy, beige head and nice lacing.  Aroma is of bready malt, toast, dark fruit, coffee and brown sugar.  Body is medium, creamy and smooth.  Taste is of toasted malt, coffee, chocolate, brown sugar, dark fruit and herbal hops.  Finish is long and dry. On a sweet side but tasty brew."

"Wtf,  I just want to rate this beer,  why do I have to write a review?"
""
"I found #38 to be very good across the board.  Nothing elaborate on the nose or the palate, just a straightforward stout that moves along nicely front to back.  Would definitely drink it again."
"Basic stout pretty drinkable and to the point stout"
""
"Pours a deep brown, with hardly any light getting through. The head is creamy tan and burns off quickly, leaving small amounts of lacing. Dark malts dominate, with notes of dark chocolate and coffee and earthy hops adding to it. The taste is very similar to the aroma, just not quite as robust and forward.The body is thinner, has a hit of carbonation and a nice dry finish."
"Rich, round, and sweet. Nice roasty character on the aftertaste."

"O: Pretty darn solid stout."
""

"Pours thick black with a lace of head. Smells like chocolate and coffee malts.At first sip its very sweet but goes down smooth and ends with a little bitterness. Overall a fairly drinkable Stout."
"An alright stout, didn't blow me away. Would try again"
""
""
"Roasted, almost smoky malt, chocolate and faint coffee. Solid."

"O: A very good beer that's a pleasure to drink. It isn't a monster of a stout but it drinks nicely and has good flavors."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a solid brew. Could be a regular go to, but there are a lot of similar beers out there. Kind of depends on whats next to it."

"O: This is a great stout, enjoyable during any season; doesn't require a super-dark beer mood. The coffee is so impressive, yet that is only one aspect to this beer. This is my summer-stout."
""
""
""
""
"O- I could definitely drink this if it were offered, but I'm just not the biggest fan of thinner stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not bad, nice stout flavors, over carbonated, and that weird back end bitter herbal yeasty thing that's hard to describe and takes away a bit, not a lot of hops which could have been a bit more. Still pretty nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is exceptional for the price but we'll done within its own merit."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A nice Irish stout. Not the driest out there in terms of its sweetness but a very nice and easy drinker none the less. Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown bordering on black with a huge off white head that takes a few to recede. Aromas of roast and hints of caramel, dried fruit, and chocolate. The flavor follows the aroma quite well. Slightly tart roasted grains with a hint of caramel and chocolate. Meidum bosy with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick almost creamy mouthfeel. Decent stout, I could drink it, but its not one of my favorites."

"Overall: At 5.6%, this beer has a lot of flavor. A solid put together Irish dry stout. Grab me another."
"Overall - Really a very nice stout, and extremely smooth and drinkable. Flavors are nicely bold, complex, and very well balanced. Fills the mouth during the quaff and finishes with a subtle dryness with a whiff of astringency. Definitely worth a try."

"Scents of plums and chocolate on the nose. Nice, outrageously, huge 3 finger head. Dark as a good stout should be. Many complex flavors, including chocolate, coffee, and hazelnuts. A classic American made stout. Goes down so smoothly, low bitterness, and it makes you want the next sip. Great session beer and I am probably a bit biased because this was one of my first micro-brewed stouts and I'm glad to be reunited with it!"

"Fairly subtle beer that hits on all points for the style. Very drinkable, without all the bells and whistles that drag down some of the new kids on the market. Should go great with these oysters."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a very dark brown with a one inch tan head, that leaves behind tons of lace. Smell is chocolate, coffee, bread, and toffee. Taste is all of that, chocolate being the dominant flavor really well balanced and smooth. Body is fairly light for a stout, plenty of carbonation, a little dry, and very drinkable. This is a solid stout, not earth shattering but nice."
"Appearance is very nice, with a pretty black pour and I don't mean ruby. The head comes off as creamy and tan but doesn't stick around long. There is some lacing for the duration but not much. All seems straight forward but pleasant. Yes, as advertised, no mistaking that this is an Irish Stout. To the nose, you get plenty of malt, plenty of dark chocolate and some might say coffee but I got something along the lines of creamy black tea. The mouth-feel is nice and creamy with nothing overbearing, very light on the palate. The taste is once again straight forward and nothing ground breaking but still very enjoyable. Up front is the creamy chocolate, accompanied by mocha and very light expresso in the end. You will also be able to taste a lot of the malt and that's something I like in Stouts. All around a very nice beer although a bit on the pricey side here in Vegas. I'd buy it again if the price was right as this is a nice one but there are better choices out there. This is NOT a big beer and no way resembles a serious Imperial Stout. It's not complex and will remind you of most other Irish style Stouts but it still sits higher on the shelf than most. Recommended."
"Pretty solid for an Irish Dry Stout."
""
""
"O: Nice beer easy to drink. I could drink this all day. I will buy this again. Good stuff! RECOMMEND"
""
""
""
"This has some good aromas and flavors in a light body."
"O- I've been on a non imperial Stout kick lately and this is killing it for me.  Would drink again, this would be easy to session.  Fridge staple material if not ISO worthy."
""
""
""
"The taste is more sweet and malty than the nose might suggest with muted coffee but more forward malts and butterscotch. Low bitterness. A very quaff-able beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A tasty stout with great balance and approachability."
"O - A solid beer, nothing overpowering, nothing out of place."
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of the style, it had pretty much all the aspects that I look for in the style with nothing that was too out of place for the style. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, a little creamy, not to filling and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, I could see myself drinking a couple of these, it's a pretty easy drinking dark beer. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style it was, it's just what I want in an Irish Dry Stout. What I liked the least about this beer was the aroma, it wasn't bad, but it had a slight stale aspect to it. I would buy this again, and I would like to try a bottle that I know is fresh, I enjoyed it and it was priced well. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the style. All in all I was happy with this beer, it represents the style nicely and it's pretty easy drinking. Good job North Coast, I'll have to keep an eye out for more of your beers, keep up the good work."

"pours dark brown/black with a small creamy head dissipating quickly. sediment suspended throughout the glass. dry malted barley predominates the nose while a subtle hint of coffee/bitter chocolate harkens back to the murphys and Guinness I had in Ireland. underwhelming malt flavor up front, followed by a dry roasted character, light hops, and bitter chocolate. thin/weak body is its most salient feature, although for the style its quite on point."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is what a dry stout should be; bitter, dry, and light in body. Quality malt scents and flavors make this a great example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - a pretty good stout. Nothing fancy or out of this world about it, but a solid year round offering from a solid brewery. I really dig North Coast and while this isn't one of my favorites from them its still something ill grab from time to time."

"Sampled back on 9/15/13. Chilled down to 36 degrees in my beer cooler and poured in a pilsner glass. Pours a nearly black in color with with a good 3+-finger tan head that lasts awhile. Lots of lacing is seen with each sip. The aroma is of roasted malt, espresso and chocolate. Perfect carbonation. When first sipped the taste of bittersweet chocolate is apparent and on the dry side. Very taste and smooth though and goes down very easy. No harsh aftertaste. Overall, a good stout."
""
""
""
"O - Not a fully satisfying IDS, but a decent one, I wouldnt seek it out again though."

"Bottle pour into tulip glass. Pours nice and dark, one finger of light brown frothy head. Scents of charred bread, chocolate, malted milk balls, and black coffee. Pretty bitter but also great flavor from the dark malt and roasted barley. Notes of coffee, chocolate, and malt, very toasty. The mouthfeel is light with mild carbonation. Not too heavy or filling, pretty drinkable. Overall a nice dry stout, flavorful, perfect balance of bitterness and sweetness."

"D: my only complaint would be that this is a little too big of a body for a dry irish stout, however I may be being picky. not blown away here, but a good brew for sure."

""

"O Nice stout. Reminds me of a fuller but toned down Extra Foreign Stout. Coffee is there but it doesn't floor you. Bitterness is there but not overpowering. A little zesty but not off-putting. Everything is pretty subtle but noticeable. If you get the chance to try this you should take it."
""

""
"3.5/5.00"
""
"Faint aromas of coffee and chocolate, but the real joy is the taste - medium bodied, smooth mouthfeel with flavors of roasted dark malts, chocolate and coffee without the tart/sour flavor of a Guinness. I could drink this all night!"
""
"O: Very solid dry stout. My first North Coast brew, I'll definitely be trying more of their offerings."
"Taste-Dark roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate, drying finish. Roasty and tasty, a nice example of the style."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours very dark brown, almost black color; with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of cocoa, chocolate, roasted malt, light char, toast, molasses, raisin, toffee, light coffee, and roasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity; decent strength. Taste of cocoa, chocolate, roasted malt, toast, light char, molasses, toffee, light raisin, light coffee, and roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of cocoa, chocolate, roasted malt, toast, molasses, toffee, light raisin, and earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Very nice balance and complexity of roasted flavors with some light fruitiness; with good robustness, and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, chalky, and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good dry stout style. Good balance and complexity of nicely robust flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering; but I probably got an old bottle judging by the fruitiness and molasses notes."

"Dark brown to black in appearance. Strong two finger head on pour but lighter in color than expected - ivory - for this dark of a beer. Mouthfeel is decent but watery towards the end. Smell is powerful - strong bold coffee with a hint of mocha. Taste is sweet forward but a dry finish. Another great borderline sessionable stout."

"O: A surprisingly good irish dry stout. Flavorful despite low ABV, the sweet dark fruits really mix in well. Has a nice creaminess to it too that is typical of good irish dry stouts. I really enjoyed this one, one of the best examples of the style. It's a bit simple as you would expect but honestly packs a lot of flavor in 5.6%. Very drinkable too."

"The Old 38 I had finished like… bbq sauce. Yes. Bbq sauce. It doesn’t taste like it, doesn’t smell like it, and there’s no reason to think of bbq sauce given that it’s a stout, but after I finished my pint while struggling to place the “off” notes I realized it’s … bbq sauce. Go figure. Is it maple syrup (artificial maple syrup) that’s lending those hints? I never noticed such a characteristic in other brews made with maple but I definitely found this here—and corroborated my findings with others tasting with me. Pretty sure I won’t try this one again."

""

"O-An easy drinking stout, doesn't bring anything overpowering to the table but enough to enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is extremely drinkable given its light body. I would definitely consider this to be sessionable because it has some nice flavors and I wouldn't mind drinking more than one of these during a single sitting."
""
""
""
"Slight tartness, with a graininess strangely akin to Russian Standard Vodka? Strange tangent, but that's what's in my fridge at the moment. ANYHOW, the finish is mildly dry with a moderate roastiness. Slightly light on the mouthfeel, but hey, it keeps this stuff really nicely drinkable and easily likeable. I mean, I like it... not bad at all."
""
"O: Had two bottles of this because the first tasted like liquid tinfoil. Second bottle was good, but this is still much better on tap as far as I'm concerned. Nevertheless, a decent brew, and worth trying."

"North Coasts Old no.38 stout is a simple, dry stout enjoyable on any occasion. At only 7 dollars for a six pack, this beer has good value and good flavor. The beer pours a dark black with a substantial frothy brown head and is aromatic of burnt coffee. A somewhat strong carbonation hits the mouth making it drinkable but slightly harsh. For a dry irish stout, this old 38 is has no surprises. Well balanced, mild but not watery, bitter and flavorful enough to keep you interested until the glass is empty. This isn't a beer I would get excited about but definitely a go-to beer at a pub, and I would easily recommend it to a friend. If this is North Coasts attempt at making an entry level affordable beer to a wider audience, I think it hit the mark and I wholeheartedly approve."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1 inch head. Smell is mild, some roasted malts. Taste is also mild, kind of bland for this style. Some roasted malts, a hint of coffee, a touch of hops. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a mediocre beer."
""
"Aroma is bitter char-malt forward with lesser components of dark chocolate and roasted malt in the middle with just a touch of fig in the background. Contrary to the nose, the flavor is mostly toasted-malt forward with less emphasis on bitter char and more on tea and herbal / earthy hopping bittering. In this sense, the flavor felt a bit more 'porter-ish' to me than like a stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a terrific stout that just has everything I look for when I want a simple wonderfully produced stout."
""
""
"O- Really enjoying this one and it cured my stout fix without having to crack open one of the yetis or IRSs I've been trying to age"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Delicious stout, I will try again."
""
""
"O: an exceptional stout; well worth seeking out. [4.25]"
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Dark body, heavy carbonation, thick foamy head. Nose is chocolaty and floral malt goodness with some sweet tones. Woody body, with a chocolaty flavor and hop bite.... well done. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's pretty average looking (black), with some lace and weak head in my conditions. But the taste is good. I would buy again if I were seeking a drinkable stout with a smokey flavor. Nice.I said that twice so it must be so."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep brown with red highlights. Thick frothy tan head. Great looking poor, except a bit light on color. Dark roast with rich malt, hints of coffee and licorice. Taste follow with darkly roasted malt and a lightly burnt tones, again coffee and licorice. Nice and dry with a good amount of bitterness, nice drinker. Hop character is earthy and at times piney, but the malt dominates. Mouthfeel is smooth and the bittering is near perfect. Overall a very fine stout, full bodied, yet dry."
""
"Overall - Solid irish dry. Reminiscent of Guinness Extra Stout, but a touch smoother. Good, but nothing necessarily original."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, another very impressive brew from North Coast. It takes a bit to get used to all the fruit notes, but the charred and toasted character along with peppery hops lead to a very nice balance. Pick this up when you find it!"
""
""
"O-this is actually a decent and full flavored stout. the smell turned me off at first but the taste really made up for it. i wouldn't mind having this again."
""
""
"O: Looking back on it, I regret not buying a six pack of this. Impressive stuff."
""
""
""
""
"What's not to like about this? A beer made for swilling. This should make the Irish take another critical look at their Beamish Stout. Not as sour and charred as the Irish cousins. On the nitro tap at South Park Abbey in San Diego."
""
"Overall real solid, and really like this slight fruit angle to this stout. Great stuff!"
""
""

"O- Opens up as it warms up. Yummy."

"Pours a very nice deep brown/black with wonderful head and great lacing. Very nice deep scent, nice roastiness and quite a bit sweet maltiness. Very nice flavors with a nice roastiness, good earthy finish, but perhaps a bit much on the malt sweetness and just a bit not-enough-dry. Still goes down smooth and is a very nice Irish dry stout... just not as good as the guy at Big Red told me it would be."
""
""
"A very drinkable brew, but I did find myself a bit disappointed. The nose led on that there would be more to the flavor, but I just didn't find it. I'd still probably try it again in the future, but I have some more interesting beers in the queue that Id rather get to first."
""
"Taste is complex. The roasted flavors come through. Has a bit of a acidic bite to it in the after taste. Finish is not as clean as I normally enjoy. Very good beer overall."
""
"This is a smooth drinking, refreshing Irish Dry Stout. Everything about this beer is traditional. I would have this again for sure."
"Overall it is a good stout. Old 38 has many reasons to try it."
""
""
""
"Overall- Not good. I was hoping for better after I saw the BA score, but I was really disappointed once I tried it."
""
""
"D - The smell alone makes this worth trying. It is a very solid stout with enough action to turn a ""Guinness-is-the-greatest-beer-ever"" type to craft."
"Pours dark brown with an abundant two-finger length brown head. Holding the glass up to the light reveals a dark amber color around the edges of the glass. There's a sweet aroma. I pick up roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee. The flavor is well balanced with the sweet roasted malts and the bitterness of the hops. I can taste the flavor of chocolate and coffee. The finish is dry and carbonation is plentiful enough to aid in lightening the medium body. Each sip is very enjoyable and lacing is present on the glass. This is a very crisp stout that leaves me craving more. This is an excellent beer."
"O - not a bad stout, my 2nd review for an irish dry stout, and it's not as good as black sun, but it's still pretty awesome in its own way."
""
"a really standard product, as normal as a bottle of stout can be, but it is well made and very drinkable. pours coffee colored dark brown, letting just a hint of light in, fair off white head that fades out. smells nice and roasty. flavor is well balanced and tastes stronger than it is. pretty dry finish as well. mouthfeel is good, full bodied but not filling and heavy. just enough carbonation, crisp for a stout. overall not something id rush to buy again, but a stout i am happy to drink anytime."
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown/black color with a slight brown head. Scent is wonderful with robust malts, sweet milk, cocoa, and coffee. Smooth and very drinkable taste with erupting flavors. Sweet flavors first that finish with a dry after taste. A great pick up and an even better stout. Would love to drink this again."
"Overall Impression- A delicious and creamy brew! If only there was more attribute (coffee, chocolate, maple syrup, etc.) this would be a 5/5! Missed the mark for me. Enjoyed for the style it was and will have to try more Irish Dry Stouts!"
""
""
"This is pretty standard Irish Stout fare. Roasted grains and a black coffee bitterness dominate. The beer gets too acidic for my tastes towards the end. The overly fizzy body accentuates the acidity for some reason. Outside of the fizz, it's appreciably light and rather dry. Overall, #38's acidity and harsh carbonation turned me off. I wanted to like it, but I didn't."
""
"O- This is a wonderful stout that has great full roasted malt but is not bitter or too sweet. Very sessionable."
"Overall, this is a laid back, subtle stout that has some good qualities that could be a bit amplified."
""
"O: A very well done American Irish dry stout. I honestly can't complain about any aspect of this beer. It's all good, but it could definitely be a tad better all around."
""
"D-I like my stouts attenuated a little less than this one, but it's incredibly easy drinking and a very nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a great Irish stout. Well crafted and worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very nice beer. I think that many try to do Irish Stouts, but fail very bad. Too many try to replicate Guinness, but this one is better than Guinness. Just very nice."
"Overall this is a perfect winter beer, excellent stout. Buy some soon. Commit yourself to a six pack with this one. I will definitely have this again soon."
""
""
"Poured a blackish body with two-finger offwhite head that stuck around for awhile and left nice lace ring. Standard aroma of mild bread, roasted, dark chocolate malts, hints of coffee and caramel/toffee. Smooth, creamy, a light dry sensation as the roasted/coffee malts balance with some breadiness/woodiness for that lingering dryness that easily passes the tongue and is filling. Adequately balanced w/ sweetness by some chocolate/caramel/toffee. Simple beer to drink that hits the spot and not too shabby."
""
""
"O-Overall a nice stout, one I would definitely purchase again. Not too heavy a drink and quite warming, for the months ahead as they grow colder."
""
""
""
""

""
""

""
""
"This is definitely one of the best Irish dry stouts not from the motherland that is available on the West Coast."
""
""
"This beer is pretty good. I didn't get a very good head when I poured into a pint glass. It smells yeasty and piney. The taste is very roasted, a tinge of sourness that ends bitter. It was a bit of a shock to the palette when I took the first few drinks, but I'm warming up to it now. I would maybe have more of these again, it's got a lot of flavor and body without the standard high abv that goes along with that sort of beer usually. Still, my favorite stout by this brewery is Old Rasputin by far."
""
""
"Slainte."
""
"O: pretty good. Likely would prefer on nitro or even with a shot of espresso in it."
"Overall: A pretty decent dry stout. The dark fruits add a nice touch. Body could of been fuller with less carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- It's hard for me to review very malty beers but I can at least say ""me likey."""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, Old No 38 stout isn't a bad beer by any stretch of the imagination, but it is somewhat disappointing given it's $10 a six price at World Market. The most glaring problem is that he mouthfeel is off - I can accept thin bodied in an Irish dry Stout, but that needs to be compensated by exceptional creaminess, which was absent in this beer. Also, the taste profile is backwards - Malt and hop flavors need to be dialed up, and the plum notes dialed down. A decent, ""good enough"" stout that I would drink again, but wouldn't necessarily seek out."
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice smoky stout with a pleasant aftertaste. Way better tasting than the smell which was a bit off-putting. I would consider getting this again, but there are others in the style I would reach for first."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Very very easy to drink. Tastly, light, smooth, nice. I could drink this all day. Has nice flavor, and a little more sweeter then i expected. Guiness drinkers should give this a try, really nice light dry stout."
"Probably the best Dry Irish I've had. This is one of my least favorite styles, but I didnt just like this in relation to its brethren - this is just a damn good beer."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, this is solid beer but there are better ones within the style."
"The alcohol was relatively low in this, allowing for a nice drinking session during the night I tried this. A glass of water is good for a beer like this, since this stood true to its stylistic name. This is a bit dry but extremely accessible and easy to get accustomed to. Fans of dark beers shouldn't come in expecting a lot, but will find it almost impossible to be disappointed by this offering."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a 2 inch puffy khaki head that settles to a small cap. Nice chunky rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, coffee beans, and some slight cocoa aromas. Taste is of dark roasted malt, coffee, cocoa powder, and some vanilla flavors. A mild roasty aftertaste sticks around after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. A bit on the thin side though. Overall, this is a good stout with a very nice set of roasty, coffee, and chocolate flavors."
"Decent stout, have had better, just feels lacking in places."
"D - very easy to drink, its light for a stout and quite flavorful. The lightness makes it very easy to have several"
"This is a decent brew, but I will not seek this beer out again. Its smell and appearance were both right on-- this beer was dark, had a nice head and gave off a nice roasty smell. Upon tasting the beer, the first thing I noticed was the intense carbonation level. I could not even taste the beer very well until the beer settled down a bit. The finish was delicious-- roasted malt, coffee and chocolate were nicely and subtly put together. The mouthfeel ruins this one for me"
"Very sessionable brew; in the style of those stouts that give you something full flavoured, but something easy to stick with all night. It's a fine achievement, and this is undoubtedly something I'd be happy to drink often."
"Overall: I suppose it's not bad, I just had high expectations for North Coast considering the only other beers I've had from them were Old Rasputin and Pranqster. I think this beer would be more enjoyable if it sat for a few minutes after being poured."
"Overall: Pretty good little dry stout. I think the nitro really helps this beer out a lot. Highly recommended on nitro"
"Overall: The lightest tasting stout I've tried. More drinkable than most stouts. A good intro for the initiate. Just not very impressive."
"O-- What beer lacks for in taste, it makes up for in feel. Easy to drink but in a way bordering more on a dark brown ale. Nothing too exciting but it is quite sessionable."
"Overall a solid stout. I prefer my Old Rasputin I think, but who wouldst? Definitely worth trying sometime, but I don't think I will purchase this one again."
"Pours motor oil black Smells of roasted malt, dark chocolate and toffee. Taste is about equal parts of the same with a slight bitterness on the finish; really nothing bothersome though. Overall a good interpretation of a stout and worth a try if you are looking for something in this style."
"O- I thought it was more of a low-hopped American Stout than an Irish Dry Stout. That being said, it's a decent beer no matter how you cut it. Nothing too memorable or that seperates it from some of the other stouts (type of stout ignored), but it's a step up from Guinness and other entry stouts. Still, I would put it in the bottom half of what I've had from North Coast."
"Poured this beer into a pint glass. Poured a thick opaque black. Looks like tar with a one finger chocolate head. Looks great and the light is impenetrable through the beer. Smell is boozy and slightly sweet. The alcohol smell is slightly off putting. The taste is good on the otherhand. Lacing left on the glass as I drink. The stout has hints of chocolate but lots of caramel malts. Has a thick mouthfeel that is rich and creamy. This beer is pretty good. If it were more popular in my area I might purchase it more often. Is not nearly the best stout I've ever had though."
"o: classic example of what a stout is, not what it could be. i really enjoy north coast and wish they did something more with this, but i guess thats why they give us old rasputin."
"Overall this is a true to form an Irish dry stout, not an imperial. Great tasting stout, just wish the aroma was more robust. Really enjoyed and would suggest a try to all. Cost is under two dollars a beer so I will always have on hand."
"Overall - I was impressed. One of the better Irish Dry Stouts I've had. Would certainly have again."
"O - overall, a very solid dry stout. Wouldn't expect any less from this brewery. This might become a go to."
"D/O- I liked this one. Been a damn long time since I've had one, pre-BA days. It's a looker...rich and creamy but not too filling."
"The beer is good. I also love the train coming at you on the bottle. There’s a story behind said train, actually. Weird to think this beer started as a home-brew and ended up being chilled in my refrigerator."
"A solid but not exception Dry Stout. Plenty of flavour and easy drinking which are great atributes for the style."
"Pours an opaque dark brown with a small tan head. Pretty standard stout, with roasted malts on the nose, semi-sweet chocolate, and a touch of molasses. Basic roasted malts in the taste, with a touch of chocolate, molasses, and an elusive touch of sour apple. Medium-to-full body, smooth, and pretty drinkable."
"I'm not a coffee drinker, but I love it in beer and this is really exceptional. Very smooth and easy to drink."
"The pour was near spot on for the style and really showed a tremendous amount of promise. Dark as night with a rich and creamy tan head that rose up from the bottom and settled down very nicely along the top of the glass. Bu that was about the best it would get. Too light of a n aroma, as roasted malts and chocolate notes seem to be horribly off balance. Hints of coffee maybe? But it all seemed to be a bit of a mess for me to be honest. Smooth, even carbonation on a somewhat mellow profile, needed a bit more of a punch to really be anything worthwhile to me. Roasted chocolate, hints of tobacco, a light sweetness, but again it really all seemed terribly off balance to me to be honest."
"Overall: A great example of the style. I've been staring at the sixer of this one at the store for a while. This is a beer that will frequent my fridge from now on."
"D: This drinks more like an English stout. It is a quality brew if you don't have ""Irish Dry Stout"" in mind."
"T: Big roasted malt flavors along with some subtle smokiness and leather. The mouthfeel keeps this from getting too heavy, but it keeps the beer from being all that I feel it could be. This is a really solid Irish Dry Stout with a major emphasis on the dry. No major complaints here."
"Poured out like a typical Irish Stout, the black body with a tan thick head. The head had some pretty good retention and stuck around for a little while. The smell of the beer was of old leather and earth. Some roasted burnt notes as well. The taste was kind of metallic... Not really what I was thinking it'd be like. I was kind of turned off by the taste of this beer completely. Perhaps it was a bad batch but I just couldn't get over how much I disliked the taste of this beer. Everything else was pretty good here."
"O= overall a decent dry stout, middleweight contender but not a star on the national level. It's simply lacking depth of flavor. If it were a local brew I'd probably drink it often. Odd that it showed up in a local beer-wine store in Hagerstown Maryland."
"Overall: A pleasant enough beer but the mouthfeel and flavor need to be bigger to get better marks from me"
"D - A well made stout, its flavor profile isn't particularly dark for the style, but it has enough roasted character to give it a very nice dark chocolate character in the finish. The gaps are filled in with dark malt that brings notes of molasses and licorice to the table as well as a bit of caramel. Like all of North Coast's offerings, this is a solid beer that is free of flaws and enjoyable."
"The aroma is a bit over the top for a dry irish stout, but who fucking cares? This is an awesome beer-I'm only disappointed that it's taken me this long in getting around to trying it."
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer very much. Fantastic stout, don't hesitate to try if it's available in your area."
"Really good for an Irish stout, different from traditionals, sweeter and less hoppy. Great nonetheless."
"O- Its hard to say. Because of the strong fruit presence I get, I like it, but this is out of the norm. This is by far the fruitiest (dark) stout that I have had. It was very pleasing, but my tongue got confused a few times. I would like to score higher, but have to keep it middle of the road since I'm between a rock and hard place on this one..."
"North Coast Old #38 Stout has a black colour and a good 5 mm head that fades to excellent lacing. The smell is roasty malt with hints of coffee and chocolate. The taste is very dry with some hints bitter coffee. The aftertaste is milky with a hint of bitterness. This is a very nice dry stout. I like it and I don't usually like this style. The mouthful is foamy and thick. Very nice."
"D - The sour finish comes and goes. It's drinkable, but probably not something I would buy again unless it's on tap just to see if it tastes any different."
"(review based on notes from a tasting on Jan 6, 2011)"
"Overall, it looks like I got a bad bottle. Glad I only bought one, but I am sorely disappointed, as I was looking forward to this. Probably not going to try and find another. Side note, I did have a dunkelweizen earlier in the night, but I don't think that affected my palate as I cleansed it, and I smell the funk in addition to tasting it."
"This is a very drinkable stout, though a little light on the palate."
"Delicious and easy to drink, but not a standout stout."
"A good February beer."
"The two gentlemen I shared this brew with were given a better impression than I (fyi), though I still feel it was a solid, solid choice for a stout."
"D: The lack of creaminess leaves me not exactly begging for that next sip, but it's definitely a pleasant drinking experience."
"Drinkability: Pretty solid -- a nice surprise from a style that can seem a little lackluster has been resurrected by North Coast, and that shouldn't surprise anybody. Nice flavors and nice scents combine with a more than manageable ABV, no reason anyone shouldn't enjoy a few of these."
"D - It's ok. I don't like it as much as I remember liking it the first time i had it. Despite it's not being that good, It's still fine to drink."
"Beer is sweet and medium body. Beer has a coffee-ish bitterness at the back but it's weak. The beer overall is weak, it's sweet and roasty and finishes nicely, I doubt I'll ever have it again."
"I see where it is coming from for an Irish-style dry stout, and while it is fairly tasty (as a beverage) and almost too easy to drink, just too much like hot cocoa in my beer."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A pretty good stout. Doesn't have that creaminess that I like in a stout, but maybe dry stouts aren't supposed to? Would happily drink again, but probably won't search it out."
"Enough bite, but a tad bit thin. That in mind, a little dangerous because it's exceptionally drinkable. My only suggestion would be for the brewmaster to add a little more to the body. Other than that, a solid, in some aspects, outstanding stout."
"D- The lower ABV gives a boost to the drinkability of the beer. Nice overall flavors (although muted) lend to the overall enjoyment of this beer. A nice look at the style and something you can just sit back and enjoy."
"Bought a six-pack at the local beer store. Poured into a pint glass. The beer pours a jet black, with a thin, tan colored, dense head. The nose is almost completely coffee, with some molasses and malty notes. The beer has inital flavors of bitter coffee, with a sweet undertone of malt based tastes. There was a smooth, round, full feel to the beer in mouth, and the flavors blend into a decent, light crisp finish. It's more dry than a cream or milk stout, but not as dry as an oatmeal of most dry stouts. The aftertaste is all coffee, but actually without the bitter. The easy aftertaste makes this beer easy to drink all night long."
"Poured dark brown with a medium almond head that disappeared quickly. Smell is dominated by molasses. Tastewise, there are some citrus notes, some coffee and sweet molasses. A bit of alcohol flavor eeked out and it was a bit chalky and dry at the finish. Decent lacing halfway done. Easy to drink, but just average flavor for this category. Too many other good ones out there...I won't be buying this one again."
"D: fairly high, but dark roasted coffee taste/finish may not be for everyone. not terribly warming and alcohol is low enough and hidden to enjoy a few, if it's your cup of coffee."
"Had this on tap at Toronado in San Francisco. Pours an opaque black colour with a finger of tan head. Nice lacing on the glass and good head retention. Smells like both chocolate and coffee with the roasted malt. This is what an irish dry stout should smell like. Nice sweetness level with faint bitterness of the roast. Smooth mouthfeel. Very enjoyable stout."
"A fair amount of chocolate mouthfeel to this one. Sturdy, chewy, not overly alcoholic as if it made you think in the nose. Does have a hop and slight bitter presence. The carbonation delivers the beer just right. Nothing over the top, dry enough, chewy enough. A damn good stout at a very decent price."
"No controversy surrounding the number here, Jack! It pours into a Guinness-esque cascade, which settles out into a sleek black-brown topped by a finger-and-a-half of light tan foam. Quite lovely, I should say. The nose is somewhat weak, comprising light roasted malts, very light cocoa, and a hint of maple syrup. The taste does not deviate too far from this, holding notes of mild roasted malts, dark chocolate, a touch of espresso, and a vague feeling of gingerbread at the finish. The nitro allows everything to coalesce and slide about in an unassuming manner. The body is a sleek medium, with a light and comforting nitrogenation and a consequently ridiculously smooth feel. Overall, a nice little Irish stout. Were this always on nitro, I'd have a solid go-to when all other taps fail."
"Excellent beer, and I can see why it was chosen by my local cafe, as it is pretty much the beer version of their coffee."
"Full bodied flavor and feel of a smoky and toasty toffee, dark almond and roasted barley. The stout is very close to style, almost lacking in uniqueness, but reveling in goodness. The roasted notes are very smooth on the finish, lacking in any particular astringents or unpleasant residuals."
"D: Fairly drinkable; beer is quite strong for such a low ABV stout."
"Pint glass pour and I am met with a dark, dark brown ale with a nice beige colored head that quickly develops to a ring around the glass. Roasted malty aroma with some chocolate hints. Smokey taste with some roasted malts in there. There is a somewhat harsh/spicy swallow. with a bitter aftertaste. Very thin mouthfeel. Totally unexpected. It looks hearty and smells good, but much too watery for me. Not very drinkable for myself. I have had this a few times and try to like it, but it just doesn't ""do"" it for me. Love the brewery, just not this beer."
"D - Wow this has to be one of the smoothest dry roasted stouts I have ever drank. In so that I would only be able to finish one or two a sitting. Regardless I will have to track down more beers from the North Coast Brewing Co. since I only had a couple and they are amazing!"
"Drinkability - This is a very sound and agreeable Stout. Perfect for those cold Winter nights. It's a session beer for me. I would love to pick this up again. I want another one. Goes down easy and is not overly filling. A very, very, very nice beer. Cheers."
"drinkability - is always as good as the taste - and this beer taste was such a let down"
"Notes: A very easy drinking Dry Stout. Not as acidic, acrid, and burnt as many examples of the style tend to be. Stays very sweet until the finish. A solid, reliable beer and a good start for those who want to venture further than Guinness within the style."
"12oz bottle with No Freshness Date, which is disappointing since I got this from a Beer Store that notoriously has beer that sits around for awhile on the shelf so I'm guessing this may have some age on it. Pours a deep, dark brown with a thin layer of head. Minimal lacing. Aromas of chocolate, caramel and alcohol. Flavors of caramel, chocolate and an overall nice sweetness to it. Nowhere near as boozey as it smelled. This is a pretty good stout and worth a second look. A bit thin but a nice sweet brew."
"this is truly the simplist version of the style. The reason it doesnt rate too high for me is that it doesnt stand out. it is good but not exceptional. Tasty but it doesnt stand alone."
"Very sessionable... I enjoyed this the whole time and was sad to see it go..."
"D - I could enjoy 2-3 with some grub on a cool day but for me that would probably do. I really liked that it wasn't overly sweet, and the flavors where simple and very chocolaty. Overall I wouldn't mind picking this one up again sometime, and I think it's worth a try for sure. cheers!"
"This is a good beer but by no means a beer there would be any sort of hype for, which is to say, it's decent but there isn't any originality or wow-factor. ""A decent dry stout"" would be my response if someone would happen to ask what i thought of it."
"A proper Irish Dry Stout, easily blowing away the sour brown water that passes for draft Guinness in the USA. A touch heavier than the ""big three"" IDS's, but more satisfying to drink."
"Pours a near black, finger of light khaki head fading to a real thin layer and a bit of a collar. Some dark ruby red around the edges when held to the light. Minimal lace. Loads of malted barley and milk chocolate in the nose. Maybe some molasses and licorice here too. Nice and sweet smelling. Tastes mostly of chocolate with a bit of coffee, smooth and a bit watery. Mouthfeel is smooth with only a small amount of carbonation, but this goes down quick. A nice drinker and a nice dry stout overall."
"Decent stout for those who may be entering into the world of craft beer, or who want something that's easy drinking. I certainly can't fault it for what it is....pretty well balanced and light."
"D- Very good and will definitely revisit"
"Very nice dry stout; had all the elements of a milk stout but not quite as sweet, which is actually quite nice. Will seek again."
"D - A very tasty brew, if it was between this or Guinness, I would drink this hands down any day of the week. An easy drinker and a good example of the style. I would love to try this on Nitro...think that would add a creaminess to the brew that would make it phenomenal!"
"It's easy to drink, as it's not very rich. You could put a few down, but if you're looking for a great stout, there are other better picks."
"D-This was better than I expected. I favor the American, and heavier Foreign/Export and Russian Imperial Stout styles. This is the best Irish Dry Stout I have had and will definitely enjoy this again."
"D - low ABV for a stout makes it quite drinkable."
"d surprisingly sessionable, totally satisfying"
"D-very drinkable, especially at this ABV"
"D - It would be hard not to like this stout. It has everything that a basic stout should have. Great body, flavor, and aroma. For an everyday stout, this is perfect."
"drinkability - very flavorful for simple ingredients, nice example of the style, really didn't know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised"
"Single bottle purchased at the liquor store. Poured into a stemmed glass. Extremely dark brown color. Huge off-white head. Plenty of lacing on the glass. A near perfect looking stout. Smell was like chocolate powder. Taste was quite flavorful. Dark coffee flavors and hints of cocoa. Mouthfeel was not as good as I would have wished for. For an Irish styled stout, it was on the thin side. If it was brewed with more body, it would kick ass. Drinkability was high, as it was smooth, flavorful, and has a moderate abv. A somewhat run of the mill stout, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with Old # 38."
"Overall - A pretty solid stout overall. The Irish dry stout category suits it well. This is a good beer to seek out if you want the roasted flavors of a dark beer, but without the heavier body associated w/many stouts and porters. Pretty approachable, drinkable, and true to style!"
"Maybe the low score is just a sign that Irish Stouts aren't my thing??? But i'm still trying to judge to style...."
"D - nothing bad about it, but so mild that I do nor think that it OS worth it."
"D - Average ABV, low carbonation, rich flavor, make this beer very easy to drink. Hard not to go back for another sip. Will definitely get more of this."
"I wish it was a little thicker, but it is creamy and feels refreshing and crisp going down. Quite drinkable for a dark beer."
"D: For a smokey stout, this one is rather good."
"D: Quite drinkable though not particularly memorable as the flavors are a little on the weak side. Again, not a bad beer but good for what it is."
"D: Not bad. Favourite of the style so far, but far from a likable stout. For what it is, it's good."
"A surprisingly good stout from a great brewery. I'd argue that this should be rated a lot higher than it is based on drinkability alone."
"A fine example of the style."
"Beer pours black, not very dark. I get some reddish notes on the edge. Nice brown head, very thick but disappear quickly. Thin film stays however. The aroma is intense for a dry stout. I get some licorice and some chocolate. Not much coffee notes. In the taste, still it is chocolaty with an espresso bitterness at the end. The taste lingers in the mouth. A little bit thin in the mouth."
"Nice aroma of coffee, sweet chocolate, and roasty malts. Moderate carbonation and a surprisingly light and dry mouthfeel for a stout. Very dry flavor as well with just a hint of smoke, toast, and coffee. The chocolate from the initial aroma doesn't really come into play, although the flavor becomes more pleasantly creamy as the beer warms. Fairly quick, watery finish with a malty emphasis. Easy to drink, but it didn't really leave much of an impression."
"This is a decent beer, could use more of everything."
"Dark brown opaque body no visible carbonation dark tannish rising brown head ala Guiness, rocky, slow dissipation with significant lacing. The first smell was heavily of coffee, but nose became more nuanced as the beer warmed, some grassy hops and a bit of chocolate. Coffee forward taste which once again gained in complexity as the beer warmed, some chocolate, sweetish malts and grassy hops not bitter on the back end. Mouthfeel was pretty oily and full. Drinikability, wihile I am not a fan of this particular style, was pretty good. Worth a try, certainly worth doing a side by side comparision with the Big Three."
"D: Well balanced, smooth and light bodied stout. Not a sipping beer, you can have a couple of these easily. I'd much prefer this beer than some of the Irish counterparts like Guinness or Beamish."
"Nice roasted malt nose with a fair amount of chocolate and some roasted coffee bean notes. Smell reminds me of some bigger stouts. Lighter in flavor than the nose and pour might suggest and offers a bit of dark fruit with a somewhat thin body. Some texture returns on the finish then the dry roasted character returns and lingers moderately along with some chocolatey spice. Quite dry overall with a bit too much of overly roasted coffee underpinning the taste and feel for me though decent nonetheless."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch tan head. The head sticks around for a while, and there's a good amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee, and some dark fruit. The taste is the same as the aroma, but it's sweeter than I expected. Mouthfeel/body is on the light side of medium, it's a bit creamy and coating with good carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth, easy, and enjoyable to drink. I think this is a good overall brew. I'd buy this again in the future."
"Starts with a surprisingly light mouthfeel, especially for a beer this rich. Clean up front. Gives way to roasty flavors of black patent malt and some bitter chocolate. Persistent lacing from a thick tan head. Aroma kinda unspectacular, just a pleasant malt character, faint. Starts gently, finishes strong. I may have another..."
"D: A very nice, sessionable stout. I was pleasantly surprised by how flavorful it is."
"Overall, a nice example of the style."
"M-this is a very tasty stout! Big bold flavors and enough of a body to let you know it's a stout. Nice array of flavors, nothing crazy but a very good irish stout."
"D: This is an excellent stout. The flavors are so big that I was shocked to later learn how low the alcohol is. Great complexity in the flavor, nothing stands out too powerfully, and everything comes together quite nicely."
"attractive looking stout poured into goblet from near room temperature bottle. head is monumental and rocky, nearly as full as the steam billowing from the locomotive pictured on the bottle. beer itself is near jet black. head retains quite well and laces wonderfully. definitive roasted malts on the nose, along with some dark, ripe fruits, coffee, and a hint of hop character. big roasted coffee flavors up front, also malty sweet with fruit, and some subtle hops. has a tangy, slightly sour sweetness on the not-too-bitter finish, that is just a bit dry. love the mouthfeel, full, creamy, and good carbonation level. overall a very nice drinking experience, and a top notch stout."
"Brew poured to a nice deep brown color guess more on the black side with a nice frothy small light tan head that broke down pretty quickly. Fair amount of lacing though. Aroma has roasted malts, Chocolate with a nice sweet aroma. Nothing spectacular, but nothing bad either. The flavor seems to have more of a burnt malt flavor, which came across as roasted in the nose. The astringency of it is nice and seems to help the hop bitterness. After subsequent the chocolate and coffee comes out - both of these seem to make the beer feel a little sweet on the tongue. Hope presence is there and adds a nice finish, which you don't get on most dry stouts. Does have a dry finish in the mouth. Slightly watery feel but from my past experiences with Dry Stouts they all seem this was so I am thinking that this might be expected."
"D: Nearly parallel to Guinness, both of them are virtually interchangeable. A novice beer drinker who didn't want to drink a brew that is too bitter or too sweet probably should give these kind of stouts a try. Not my favorite style, but I always enjoy trying brews I've never had before, no matter what the style or brand."
"Overall I just plain don't like this style I've decided - watered down stout is all I can think of but I think they did an alright job of doing what they were aiming for - nothing special though."
"D: Drinkability is average at best."
"Drinkability is nice. Not sure this fits in the Irish Dry Style, seems to be more of an American Stout. Definitely errs of the session side though, light in alcohol and not overpowering in flavors. Tasty and goes down easy, all in all... a nice drinkable stout."
"D - A very solid stout. Could drink a couple."
"The body and drinkability were both at the upper end of the spectrum for this type of brew. Overall, a very good example of the style. Worth your time to try."
"try one!"
"The body was a little shy of full. The feel was fluffy with an initial sharpness from the carbonation. It's a good beer, but it's not as memorable as I was hoping."
"Over this beer is okay. It reminds me of a better version of Guinness, which, in my opinion is both good and bad. Good because its a better version, but still bad, because Guinness just isn't that great of a beer."
"I am surprised this beer does not get even higher scores. An attractive stout with a dark brown color that appears black in the glass. Thick, creamy tan head that has good retention. Just light lacing though. Really surprised by the aroma. I am a sucker for English hops and this stout seems to be stuffed with them. Awesome floral and herbal aromas that compliment the chocolate and roasted malt. The hops come into play in the flavor as well. The beginning is hop flavors followed by the customary roasted malt that gives some chocolate and coffee notes. Not being on nitro or casked, it cannot compete in the mouthfeel department. But this beer still has a nice body and carbonation. Nice flavor and low ABV makes this extremely drinkable."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is on the light side but but it isn't thin or watery feeling like Guinness. I would call this a very drinkable stout that I would reach for in an instant when I was looking for dark, but smooth and easy to drink."
"Drinks fairly well here. Very much to style on the Irish Dry, I'm glad I tried this."
"North Coast has yet to disappoint me."
"D: this is very drinkable and a sessionable stout. I love the roasted profile."
"Pours a deep, opaque sable with a thick, fine-bubbled, fairly persistent beige head. Aroma is strong, smoky and oily with undertones of unsweetened chocolate and molasses and just a whiff of coffee. Smoky flavor has a woody undertone as well as firm tones of molasses and mocha. Texture is smooth and fairly tingly, leaving a satisfying and slightly gritty finish."
"D: Let this one sit in the glass for a bit, especially if it's been in a cold fridge. There's a lot going on here for a middleweight Irish stout, and this one might even make a nice session stout. It's been a favorite of mine for a while now; finally getting around to a review. It may not pair up with mussels or scallops as well as Guinness does, but I'd have it with seafood in a jiffy -- also good Mexican (mole) dishes, or lamb stew. Or (vanilla ice cream) dessert!"
"D- I need more of these in my fridge. A good go to beer for folks to try new styles without breakin' the bank."
"D: This is one of the better stouts I have had. I wouldn't mind having this one more frequently than others."
"It seems to be missing a little something but that may be me getting used to Imperial Stouts, otherwise this beer is a nice beer experience. It has a nice even medium body and feels great going down. It dies have a slight aftertaste but only the briefest."
"Good mouthfeel and drinks well. Overall a decent stout"
"All told, this was really a good stout. It didn't knock my socks off, but its definitely a solid stout that I could drink at least two of in a night. Not a flavor bouquet, but it's still tasty. Pretty good showing from North Coast."
"Hard pour into a SN hop tulip glass. Pours a deep mahogany, 3 finger head, with a smidge of lacing. Smells of roasted malt, and dark chocolate. Slight chocolate bitterness in the taste, as well as malt, not at all sweet, but well balanced. A good example of what I consider to be a classic stout."
"J"
"KAC"
"Drinkability is high as this beer goes down easy. I wouldn't mind having a couple of these at a time as this is one of the better examples of this style I've had."
"Pitch black colored beer with a slowly fading creamy head.Aroma is chocolate.Taste is smoked malts,coffee and cocoa.Smooth and creamy goes down like silk.Like most stouts very enjoyable and flavorful.I highly recommend and would gladly purchase again!!"
"D: I could put back a few, and love it, but not something I would want to session or drink all night."
"A very fine stout offering that is delicious without being overly full bodied, could be a sessionable stout candidate."
"Drinkability is good in the sense that this beer goes down relatively easily, but I don't necessarily feel like I really want another. It's good, but a single was plenty for now; perhaps I'll return to this one sometime in the future."
"All in all, it was a good beer but not my favorite from North Coast (one of my fav's!) It didnt strike me as an Irish Dry Stout but none the less It was a good beer. A good Stout."
"D: Not sure if I can take in too many of these at one sitting."
"Poured a dark brown with a moderate head that faded quickly to a collar. The aroma wasn't much, a little bit of sweet coffee. The taste was a little bit of sweet coffee, not a lot there. The feel was medium bodied with decent carbonation. Drinkability was good. Overall, this was actually good for an Irish dry stout, which usually don't amount to much."
"Not my cup of tea, and too thin."
"Has a opaque dark color with a firm dark cream head that lingers for the whole drink. Aroma was a mix of roasted malts and some cocoa. Taste had the cocoa and malts, but also a coffee flavor to it. Beer had a good creamy thickness to it, and the firm head helped that. Overall a decent stout, right on par with Guinness."
"Conclusion: Great aromas; the taste is just a bit simplistic and one dimensional; still, a tasty Irish Dry Stout"
"Notes: When you consider that you could simply get Old Rasputin (same brewery of course, a superior, masterful beer) then this is certainly second tier from North Coast. That being said, this is a fine Stout."
"D: I think that one is enough for me.. Nice and smokey, but is missing the elegance that other's have."
"taste is smooth and dry, dark and milk chocolate, some vanilla, some roasted nuts, malt, and some strong on the coffee, and ends dry and a little bitter."
"D- Light body and ABV make this one a good session beer. Tasty too... no Old Rasputin though."
"Another good beer from North Coast. It is not my favorite from them, but still very enjoyable."
"Reviewed on 05/10/2009. 12 oz. bottle. The beer pours black with a thick light tan head. Aroma of super sweet malt, roasted malt, and some raisins. Flavor of roasted, sweet malt with some vegetal notes. This was not very interesting. It was sweet and meh."
"Medium bodied and creamy. More round on the palate than I'd expect, but with a good dose of biting roastiness on the tail end. Astringent, maybe? Pretty good carbonation, but doesn't take away from the creaminess. Drinkable enough, though it's starting to feel a little heavy."
"D- Good enough to get again and it is light in alcohol so this passes the drinkability test for me. I finished my 12oz in no time. For some reason I found this in a dingy liquor store and I don't see this paticular beer carried in a lot of places, i wonder why?"
"Drinkability: I'll be picking it up again and see it as a good drink by yourself beer. Not sure if it would make for a good session beer"
"I prefer my stout a bit more flavorful then this one. I'm glad i got to try one again for sentimental reasons."
"The taste is not as intense as the aromas; a bit mellower. A lot of light, roasted malty flavors. A sip yields slightly bitter, coffee flavors with a little figs and spiciness to provide a nice refinement. Reminds me of a good, refreshing Baltic Porter. Again the flavors don't match the intensity of the overall aroma, which is stellar, but this is a highly session-able beer with a full mouthfeel and high drinkability that I enjoyed even more upon a second helping."
"Poured into a mug as a completely pitch black beer with plenty of thick tan head. Head slowly evaporated, leaving lacing down the glass. Taste is smooth, with some brief chocolaty hints. Not very strong and doesn't last very long either. Overall, I was very underwhelmed by the averageness of this beer. Drinkable, but unremarkable."
"The mouthfeel is thin, nothing like the thick creaminess I expect from the style. A little fizzy, but that dies in about half a second. This reminds me more of a brown ale or a weak porter than a stout, & I'm sad to say I find it lackluster. North Coast has never disappointed me before, but there is just so much more to be expected from the style."
"Poured into a pint glass. Of the Irish Stout's I've had, this beer is the last opaque, as I could see through it when held to light. It has a small tan colored head. The smell appears to be great, and strong for the style. I can pick up milk chocolate with some coffee as well. The taste was almost repulsive. Initially there was a strong roasted flavor up front, and before the taste could settle in, the dry bitterness set in. I'm not sure what hops were used, but it left for a bad aftertaste. This one was close to a drain pour. The mouthfeel was decent: good carbonation yet a bit weak on thickness. Due to the bad taste, I cannot rate this beer high on drinkability, even with it's low ABV. I'm using this beer as a later drink in my evenings to finish off this six pack."
"Finish is smooth and resiny. Delicious."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. Poured two shades shy of black with a quarter inch tan-colored head that quickly dissipated into a soapy slick of foam. Minimal lacing with weak legs. Nose suggests chocolate malt and a hint of caramel and lactic acid. Strange taste - definitely chocolate malt, but a strange peppery quality. Also a bit of char somewhere in the mix. Mouthfeel is a little on the watery side with a consistent background effervescence. Drinkability is decent - just not overly digging the peppery/charred character in the flavor profile."
"Nice enough going down. Decent stout, worth the purchase, though nothing remarkable."
"For a dry stout, it has fairly good, rich flavour and body. Overall, it's well-rounded and the balance is good but the bitter chocolate/coffee element seems just a little too strong."
"D :: While drinkable I feel the roasted/burnt flavor was little too much."
"12oz. Poured fairly thick and was near-black in color. Tan head was fluffy and not quick to dissipate. Initial aroma was a waft of sweet cocoa and roasted malts, pleasant to the nose. Mouth-feel was decent with an apparent dryness, which was acceptable for the style. Flavors were roasted malts and dark chocolate with a balanced hop character - the finish seemed to be more bitter chocolate rather than bitter hops, which again was very pleasant. Overall a great interpretation of a dry stout - obviously different than an average Guinness, but very enjoyable."
"The beer looks great. It has a pitch black tone with an enormous tan head. I don't pick up a whole lot in the nose. It definitely has some roastyness but it is a little lacking. I am really digging the flavor of this beer. It seems like it sticks to the style very well with its roasty flavor. It is full of flavor with a light type of body that makes it very drinkable."
"Okay I am golfing yesterday, come into the clubhouse bar to grab a beer for the back 9. Obviously water was apart of the equation also. But anyways I'm looking for something tasty..I see a green covered brown bottle next to a Heineken, it's called Old#38. They say it's a stout. So I was all for it. Little did I know this was a North Coast brew. But I was excited to have a stout on this windy day of golf. It kept me warm. Mouth feel is dry, smooth, tinge of alcohol, and some burnt taste of something. Smell was like coffee and chocolate. Appearance was nice. Foam proceeded to pour over my styrofoam issued course cup after ""they"" poured the brew for me, which was a little dismaying since I obviously wanted to drink what I paid for. So the head was thick and visually the brew looked like a Guinness. It is dry like a guinness with more carbonation and just about the same foam content. I was still able to enjoy the most o' this beer and am looking forward to getting a six pack; or an absurdly priced 4-pack. (I have had the 6 pack, twice now, they did not disappoint). Good stuff North Coast. Keep up the good work."
"Nose of roasted malt and quite a bit of cocoa. Roasted tones dominate upon tasting. Taste is dry right off, roasted coffee. Mouthfeel is rather than and dry. Ap retty good example of the style nut not one I would seek out again."
"Poured cold from the bottle, the color is a ruby tinged burnt dark brown, almost opaque. The head is a scant swirl of light brown with fair lacing evidenced. The aroma is a sharp merlot and chocolate coffee. The flavor brings a deep chocolate bread pudding sweetness with a little smokey citrusy bite. I pick up sweet malt and a touch of rye within an effervescent but quite drinkable, tastey stout. Somewhat of a porter perhaps, although as either style this one is a wonderful treat which could easily be sessioned. Well done North Coast!"
"overall this beer is very good for a dry irish stout. underrated for its style for sure."
"Easy to drink in the sense of a light body and mild flavor, but it's not begging me to get another bottle."
"Balance can describe this stout well, not too roasty, hoppy or carbonated...just right amounts of each make for a very approachable and tasty dry stout. It is a bit thin and mild, but that is not always a bad thing. There is nothing offensive about this beer and the chocolate becomes more evident upon warming. This is a damn good beer, quite the sessionable stout. There is always room for this in my fridge..."
"Good Irish Dry, the roasted flavors and coffee flavors are not overbearing at all, which makes this beer very smooth all the way through and very drinkable. I would have liked more head and lacing due to the style, but taste wise this is a great beer."
"D- An enjoyable stout. A little different, but worth a try."
"Dry aftertaste, each sip teases me workin' up my appetite, Sky rockets in flight, afternoon delight."
"Overall, a decent beer, I'm just not a fan."
"-Dotson"
"Beer pours a deep dark brown, almost opaque and black however when held to the light very faint ruby hues show on the edges. There is a slight tan head that recedes to a film - slight lacing that quickly fades on the sides of the glass. Nose is of strong chocolate and roasted malt. Taste is of roasted and sweet malts, chocolate, with a deeper coffee finish. There is slight hop bite blended in - just enough to give a kick. Mouthfeel is slightly carbonated, creamy mouthfeel...not too filling. This is a nice stout!"
"Mild foam for a head but sits there like it's waiting for a late bus, patient but ready to go. No real lacing to speak of. Black as coal color, dull orange rust hue at the very outer rims. Carefully toasted nose of dark chocolate, coffee bean, chocolate coated raisins, maple syrup, comes at you slowly with its hands out in friendliness, the hops lack a distinct scent profile but do firm up and sharpen the dominant malts, lasts well but tactfully in keeping with general demeanor. Medium-bodied, probably fuller but it is sufficiently dry that it's hard for the palate to fully register what's soaking in. Again, no lack of black chocolate, coffee, licorice, malted milk ball flavors, slight increase in oatmeal, cereal graininess. Carbonation noticeable when you want to notice it, that is, appropriate level. Drying finish brings out shades of tea leaf, lemon peel and poor brown earth. Hits the right notes but not gonna sing the aria."
"Old 38 is an almost black ale with a reddish tint and a tan head that fades to a tight film. It leaves nice lacing on the glass and stays the whole way down. It has a roasted aroma that's sweet and a touch tart. There are notes of coffee, licorice and brown sugar. It is medium-full bodied and incredibly smooth. It feels a bit fluffy in the mouth. The finish is dry and dusty. The flavor is very roasted, almost smokey, with notes of coffee, chocolate, and caramel. It's a touch sweet and syrupy, but perfectly balanced. I think this may be the stout on which I originally developed my palate. The malt and hops just work together on a new plane of beer existence. I could drink a bucket of this. This is like a beer custom made for me."
"D - i love stouts, but i'm still not a fan of irish dry stouts."
"black. little head to speak of. smells of a bit of coffee. flavors are kind of everywhere, not to well balanced to my pallet. Dry obviously, but also roasted malts, and bitter finish, i like all the flavors individually, but together, they just arent working properly in this one....not a drain pour, just not something i will be having again...."
"I couldnt see myself drinking this beer again."
"A nice Irish Dry stout. Does not bog you down by being too heavy. Could easily have a few in a night."
"Drinkability: Would try again, but won't be seeking out anytime soon."
"Overall: I'm a big north coast fan, and was very happy with this brew. Try the Old Rasputin, which will also not disappoint."
"A bit lighter than most stouts; holding it up to the light, you can see to the other side. The nose is pretty weak. I honestly can't smell much of anything. The taste is of roasted malts, sweet chocolate (sweeter than most) and toffee. Finish is pleasantly dry. Not great, not bad. I'd honestly have expected better from this brewery, though."
"D: Wish I had a nice shepherd's pie or beef stew to pair this with; still, it's fine as a stand-alone end to the evening. Likeable, easy to drink, just a bit high in alcohol to be truly sessionable. Worth a try, a stout I'd have again."
"Drinkability- Just right for a few to go down well. One of the most drinkable stouts I've had."
"Drinkability: easy to drink stout that is strong on the roasted tones with a bitter profile. A few of these can be had in a session."
"A very smooth Irish Dry Stout, on the top of that I have tried. I'd recommend this over Guinness Draught, unless you really want the nitro feel. A little higher on the %ABV side, still maybe sessionable. Recommended."
"Pours out a dark brown, not quite black. A 2cm head sits on top, with loose clumps of bubbles. A little lacing and alright retention. The smell is the nicest part. Some sweetness with a roasted back. A very nice smell for a dry irish stout. The taste is kind of bitter, but without the pleasant coffee taste I'd expect to accompany. There isn't as much sweetness or creaminess as I'd expect from the nose. The mouthfeel is kind of prickly and lacks the smoothness I'd expect from other examples of the style. It actually drinks fairly well, and gets much better as it warms."
"12oz bottle into a standard pint glass. Pours an almost opaque black with a thin off-white diminishing head. Aroma is a nice mix of fresh ground coffee, roasted malts and powdered cocoa. The taste is all the roasted malts I'd expect from a stout with traces of espresso and lingering bitter cocoa. The beer is light to medium bodied with smooth carbonation. This is an enjoyable textbook stout to say the least."
"D - Can't really go back for more, my buddy is on a quest to get me to like dry irish stouts, but it's not looking good"
"EDIT: I did give the other 5 away and got very positive comments. I have since realized that this bottle was oxidized, and I am going to buy another one and re-review it."
"Recommend: Yes, will be trying other NCBC beers now too."
"A good stout by a great brewery. I probably wont by this again for a while but have no regrets about the 6 pack."
"This is beer is well balanced and easy to drink. It makes for a very flavorful and accessible session beer."
"Pours an almost pitch black colored body, with a humongous foamy tan head. Very vigorous and very lasting. Very chocolaty aroma, a little musty, some.roasted coffee. A lot going on in the nose. Creamy smelling aroma too. Creamy, ashy, bitter chocolate taste. Light fizziness. Not as sweet a taste as in the aroma.. Nice taste, not too heavy or alcoholy."
"HV"
"Deep brown ale with little if any red hues topped by thick beige head which stands long. The nose is filled by toffee, melanoidins, sherry, and burnt paper. However, the palate is almost entirely dominated by a dry ashy roasted grain flavor that takes on an astringent quality similar to over steeped tea. The beer as the qualities necessary for style including relatively thin, still, and dry, but just to dry on palate. Just an average American version of an Irish Dry Stout"
"D: Very drinkable stout with all of the flavors blending well together with a lower ABV which was nice."
"Why would anyone have a Guinness when they can drink this beer? Great dark brown color with a thick tan head. Burnt chocolate aroma with matching flavor. Bittersweet and smoky, with a good chunk of dark and milk chocolate thrown in for an incredible combination."
"This is one of my favorites. Its very easy going - nothing abrasive about this brew. Great label to match a very drinkable stout."
"D: Drinkability was nice, dry and silky. Good everyday beer."
"D - Goes down smooth. A little heavy on the citrus for my taste. Still, very well made and tasty. Could definitely drink a few."
"I don't see this one real often but when I do it's worth trying. Very easy to drink and tasty, too."
"Pours a nearly impenetrable black with the edges showing just a touch of red. The light brown cap has a strong will to survive the duration of this healthy looking treat. Lots of sticky circular rope lacing coats my glass,finishing off this sexy Stout. The nose is sweet with what smells like caramel malts and flavored coffee. Milky Way candy bars,chocolate covered coffee beans,and burnt toast make up the conglomeration of flavors that are mixing together with each sip. This is a little sweeter than most stouts,but not too sweet. Dry and a little watery on the finish,I enjoy the dryness,but the body could use the volume turned up two notches. The creaminess could also use a kick in the azz. Very flavorful and quaffable brew that I will revisit."
"Anyways, I poured this one into a brandy snifter but a pint glass would work great. I think this beer could be drank at any temp from 45 - 62 without a problem. It all depends on what you prefer to taste. More great bitter hop go higher more sweet malty goodness go colder. This was a great (almost) find. Do yourself a favor go get 4 of these tonight!"
"Dark walnut brown, nearly black. Creamy tan head, okay lacing, decent retention. Cocoa, graham, and light roasty aromas. Flavor is very roasted, with coffee notes and a slightly charred bitterness. Semisweet chocolate provides a touch of sweetness. Mouthfeel is decent, but the carbonation is too high. This style would be better suited to a light carbonation to enhance a creamy body. Nonetheless, this is miles tastier than the standard Irish stout fare like Guinness and Murphy's."
"Pours a stong, lively light brown head that recedes to thin island of foam, but some ok tan lacing hugging the glass. Black to dark brown in color with a little viscocity. Great roasted malt, bitter chocolate and coffee aroma. All subtle but undeniabley there. Starts with dark roasted malts that take on an aire of chocolatey sweetness. The middle gets a bit creamy. While the finish is burt then leavesa bloody aftertaste. The palate oasted, well integrated and sessionable. Plenty of flavor and sessionable."
"D: On the whole a solid beer, but didn't wow me in any big way."
"D - Drinkable, but not great. Usually I have high praise for north coast beers."
"Very drinkable beer that would be nice to drink regularly."
"Old #38 is a smooth and creamy stout that has some lovely dark flavors but no bigger ones. A fact that I don't mind one bit. It's got a lot of the big player flavors to make it a great stout but not an overpowering taste. The flavors work well with a mild carbonation and a shallow bitterness all adding up to a medium bodied easy to drink beer."
"A lazy drinker's review to be sure, but Old #38 Stout is nothing mindblowing- just another absolutely solid beer from North Coast. Simple but very drinkable, I'll definitely pick this up in the future."
"An ok stout without much body and somewhat lacking in the taste department. This beer is dark but rather transparent for a stout. The smell is mostly roasted malt, chocolatey malt. There is even an interesting hop character in the background. The taste is similar but the feel is so light that it kind of washes out the beer's potential. I guess it's fairly drinkable, but it wouldn't be my choice for a stout. It's not bad, and if you like light stouts, it's probably a good choice. It's just not my thing."
"Drinks easy enough, a nice stout that has a bit too much coffee character for me"
"Drinkability: While the aftertaste definitely reminded me of Old Rasputin (my favorite beer), I can't imagine myself sitting around and drinking these. Carbonation is too high, body is too thick, flavor ain't anything special."
"Overall, not a beer that I really enjoy, though it could be that the ""Dry Stout"" isn't my thing."
"The finish stays on the palate for a while."
"D: Drinkable, yes, but there are much better representations of the style out there."
"2.5	D due to the watery texture that for me proved a poor match to the other characteristics, i will not be buying regularly."
"Very drinkable stout, even in summer. I used this as a desert beer."
"D: Very drinkable but again, not as flavorful as I would expect and a bit bland. Good lacing though. This is not a bad beer just has some differences from the usual stout flavors which is good."
"D - Very high, fantastic stout."
"Old 38 pours a dark brown color, very opaque with a moderate brown head. A bit of astringency to the nose adding to its maturity, chocolate liquor, thick roasted malts and a slight creamy caramel aroma. Chocolate and semi-sweet coffee are very big component directly up front while tasting, tiny bubbles of bright carbonation adds a refreshing zing to the experience, and doesn't ruin its creamy texture. There is still some hop bitterness to the finish and a slightly warming alcohol presence. The drinkability is great, this one goes down very smooth, its hard to keep myself from going to town on the rest of these bottles but i feel that with a few more months it will become even tastier."
"taste doesn't live up to the aroma. not bad, but a bit bland. a little sour, roasty and a faint bitter finish. mouthfeel is watery and thin. easy to drink, but not a stand-out."
"D - Excellent stout... A little to bitter for my liking, but a stout that I'll continually search out and enjoy..."
"Smells like sweet milk chocolate and some semi-sweet chocolate with nice hint of honey. Pours to a pitch black that lets no light through at all. Nice tan head that dissappears quickly but clings to the glass. Taste is nice and heavy with sweet chocolate and a tart but not bitter hoppiness throughout. Finish is dry, hence the style and leaves one anticipating another sip. Mouthfeel is spectacular, starts heavy and chewy and finishes silky smooth. Great style and a great example of the style. Bottoms up!"
"D= Not a bad beer by any means, and certainly a good example of a dry stout. I personally prefer to select oatmeal and imperial stouts instead of this one."
"The drink is fullish-medium in body, and despite a gracious plenty of carbonation to help lighten the feel, a residual stickiness marks the drink's passing. Nicely drinkable."
"Good session beer. Glad I took a gamble on this brew."
"Feel starts off somewhat watery and thin, but grows somewhat on the palate. Still leaves a bit to be desired. The style lends itself well to drinking a few. This isn't quite the best in class, but worth a pass."
"My only complaint is the carbonation level is wound up too high. Model it after the flavor; let it mellow."
"Drinkability is average, I much prefer some other irish stout options out there."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark black color, there is some light showing through so it is not quite pitch black, with a creamy light tan head. The aroma is dark roasted malts, chocolate and coffee. The taste is smooth and malty up front with a good amount of roasted bitterness and hops in the very dry finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, Old #38 is a good dry stout that is definitely worth a try. Recommended."
"Pours opaque dark brown with a finger of tan head and modest lace. Smells like dry toasted bread with hints of chocolate malt and an herbal hop overlay. The flavor is very hop-forward for an irish style. Strong pine hop notes up front permit only a bit of toasted bread and dark fruit flavor to sneak through to the center. Rather dry and a little thin in the mouth; not at all creamy, with carbonation very pronounced. Not a winner for me."
"Cheers..."
"M/D - On the thinner side. Well carbonated. A drinkable stout, but not a great stout."
"Pours nice with foamy cappucino colored head. The aroma made my knees weak - roasted grains, espresso coffee, tart hops. Hops and bitter chocolate dominate the taste with roasted grains scattered nicely. Complex, dry finish that had me wanting more..so I had four more!"
"D- its lighter character sure up the drinkability for me because after one, i don't feel like i just ate lunch. tons of flavor and moderate abv and the fact that i'm not drinking roasted malt concentrated syrup would make her some around the mountain when she comes. for a session, that is."
"I had no idea I was buying an Irish dry stout when I picked this up, I gave it a bit of a hit on mouthfeel with an extra 1/2 point for style. Not creamy at all and the mouthfeel is a bit thin. The head lasts a good while and the brew is very very dark brown. Smell is roasted malts, toast, coffee and a bit of almond. Taste is the same, the almond and cherries taste not as strong as an almond stout. All in all a good brew but when I'm in the mood for a dark brew from this brewery I'll buy old Rasputin."
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Wondeful color and aroma. Decent tan head w/ minimal lacing. Very low carbonation, smooth as silk. Definetly a good choive if your looking for something different. I'll need to find other styyles from this brewery soon!"
"D: This is a great beer to keep in the fridge and knock back a couple while watching a game or with dinner. Really enjoy this brew."
"Very good aroma, mostly chocolate and coffee, which opens up to a mostly dry, medium bodied, beer with coffee and bittersweet chocolate flavors. Not complex, but nicely crafted and definitely worth a shot."
"D - Yeah, I could drink this all night long."
"for whatever reason, i enjoyed this much more the second time around. still, irish dry stouts and the 5% ABV malaysia-brewed version of guinness foreign extra are now readily available in beijing (if you look for them), so hopefully instead they'll start importing some harder-to-find styles in the future"
"D- This beer is very enjoyable but too viscous to pound quickly"
"I liked this stout a bit more than most of the reviewers, and so be it. It pours a nice deep ruby, tawny brown with a nice creamy tannish head that hangs around a long while. There is ample lacing to this beer. The smell is modest, roasted malts, chocolaty, maybe a hint of a dark cherry chocolate. The beer is preeminently creamy and medium bodied with just a bit of carbonation. The taste is roasted malts, a slightly hoppy bite in the finish to let you know there are hops present, and plenty of chocolately notes throughout. The beer has a slightly chalky finish, slightly drying, but a bit sweet for a dry stout. This isn't the best representation of a dry stout, in fact, it's pretty wide of the mark. I like the beer as is regardless of label or type. This is a smooth, creamy, easy to drink stout that I really enjoyed. L'Chaim."
"The beer is a has a good and heavy mouthfeel, but coming in at just under 6% ABV, I could see myself having a few more."
"drinkablility is good. this is a decent irish dry, though there is much better out there."
"Wonderfully drinkable. Great flavor, not as heavy as some stouts, a nice ABV for drinking more than one or two in a sitting, very good example of the style. Probably my favorite Irish Dry I've had so far, and high up in all the stouts I've had."
"D- All in all a great beer. I could enjoy several pints a night."
"This beer poured a dark chocolate brown with a two-finger dark tan head. The smell is toasted malts with some hints of coffee. The taste starts off with some semi-sweet chocolate tasting malt that gives way to some slight coffee tastes that are cut by some hops. The mouthfeel is fairly thick with some pretty mild carbonation. This is a tasty beer, but I think it might sit a little heavy to drink more than one of at a time."
"A very tasty stout with nice notes of roasted malts and coffee, but a little too lactic and sweet for me."
"Sweet, rich, and thick - recommended..."
"Drinkability: Along the lines of Boulevarde's Dry Stout, but fuller in body. I typically look for an ABV around 5 or less for this style cause I like having many at a time. This is a tad high, but still it is a great beer. I would recommend giving this a try."
"Smell is of coffee with slight bitter action. Nothing complex, but a very clean brew. Finish is short with no aftertaste. While there are other Irish stouts I like more, this is very pleasant. All in all, a good brew."
"The bottom line: As Irish Dry Stouts go, North Coast has put together a good variation on the style. There is nothing here that is particularly memorable, but if you're in the mood for a lighter stout like this, Old #38 is an affordable and tasty option."
"I don't about the style, but this certainly is a tasty beer. I got big milk and dark chocolate flavors along with chocolate grains and an aroma to match. There's a medium body with a balancing bitterness and touch of citrus hops flavor. Overall this is a great dessert beer and I'd love to see a coffee version of this."
"Pours almost black with a creamy, foamy semi lasting tan head. Smell is nuts and cream and roastiness. Hazlenut creamer like notes. Flavor is dark and roasty, slighty sweet, and with a light shortly lived slightly dry bitter finish. Average body. Not too thin but not as thick as I prefer. Moderate carbonation. Pretty good standby stout that you could easily have more than one of. Not unhappy that I bought a 6 pack of this in Las Vegas. Nice beer."
"This is a good sipping stout that would make a nice session beer."
"I'm still perplexed that the same brewery that made the big, bold, and brilliant Old Rasputin made the Little Engine That Should Have But Didn't. Old #38 is a letdown--not a disaster, but a journey into what could have been, but wasn't. In all, decent."
"d- Not my favorite of this style, but still very drinkable. I do enjoy their many other offerings."
"Drinkablity: A very tasty and well-crafted brew."
"Old #38 is a great, extremly drinkable stout. I enjoy it each time I pop the bottle."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my trusty Boulevard Goblet. Poured a dark, dark brown that allowed tan hues to show through when held to the light. Had a light tan head that disappeared quickly and left little lacing. Aroma is heavy on the roasted malts, with a bit of chocolate, nuts and almost buttery notes. Taste is heavy roasted malts and unsweetened chocolate. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but hey, thats the style. This is one of the better Irish stouts on the market."
"Dark brew with a creamy head that dissapated very quickly. would have liked to see more head. Bitter hop and chocolate aromas, touch of dark fruit. Good mouthfeel, on the lighter side for a stout, but thats how it was made. Cocoa flavors, roasted malts,bitterish chocolate flavor dominates. This is how Guinness should taste. I was suprised by how much I thouroughly enjoyed this brew, very solid.What it lacks in inital apperance is made up by flavor.If your're looking for a good Irish stout, get it!"
"Pours your basic black with a small cocoa head. Trace of lacing. Ok aroma-very metal like and somewhat medicinal. Very, very solid roasted flavor. Stands out quite well. Deep plum flavor. Lingering bitterness and somewhat dry. Decent mouthfeel. Very drinkable and enjoyable. I could see doing this one on a regular basis."
"Thanks again for the opportunity to try this one again, JDV."
"Poured an attractive dark brown with some garnet highlights and nice tan head that dissipated to a small tan ring. Aroma is of caramel, chocolate, and coffee. Flavor is also of caramel, chocolate, and coffee that is balanced by the hop presence. Mouthfeel is pleasant and little lacing was left on glass. This was a nice beer that I enjoyed especially after it warmed a little which enhanced the flavor. Very smooth with high degree of drinkability."
" This beer felt a little thin for a stout. It was very smooth as I mentioned. I felt that this beer like most stouts was a little better as it warmed in the glass. Overall it was a very drinkable stout that you could have several of."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer. Grab a sixer and ante up lads."
"This beer pours an impenetrable black with a nice and fluffy light tan head. The nose is very weak, but does have some malt and coffee in it. The taste is wavy. At first it seems thin, but quickly jumps to dark malty flavors. Some coffee bean through the middle and a little vanilla, very little though. The carbonation provides a crispiness. there is a bit of coppery taste on the finish. Mouthfeel is average, thin and just a bit too carbonated for my taste. Very drinkable, and a great session stout. A good offering from North Coast, but Ill take old raspution instead every time!!"
"T: it has a nice coffee taste with a roasted malt too, maybe thats just me. as it warms the alcohol is more perceivable"
"2006 from notes 12-2006. Pours a clear but deep ruby with a tan head. Nose is fairly mild actually. Minute amounts of cherry. Flavor hits with a quick punch of sweetness and then the alcohol takes over. In my opinion it stays way too long as it leaves a aftertaste on the mouth. Just seems a bit too much, though it doesnt completely overpower. I wonder what age would do to that. Slight cherry tone. Feel is slightly syrupy with minimal carbonation. Even though at first the alcohol is extremely present, this one is highly drinkable. Though I doubt youd want to go through too many of these at once."
"poured into a 20 ounce imperial pint glass, showed decent head and body, lots of lacing. huge roasted malt , tastes, with some nuttiness in the background little hopper than i expected which is a good thing. this is the the best irish dry stout i have had to date."
"overall, i really enjoy this and will prolly be picking up another one"
"This is only the 4-5th time I've had this brew, and I think North Coast can do better, but I also need to fine tune my palate to understand more what a good American ""Irish Dry Stout"" actually tastes like."
"Thanks agai, Deniz!"
"D: Balanced flavors is great for the mouth. Would have one at a time rather than one after another."
"Poured into oversized wine glass. Pours nearly black but is more like a deep, dark brown. Tan head doesnt last too long and leaves nothing behind, no lacing. Smell is of chocolate (dark) and what seems to be a slightly tart fruit, maybe a little raisin like, cant quite place it. Taste is of toasted grains, almost burnt and some dark chocolate, and again the fruit which I still cant place. Very crisp tasting and very light bodied. Leaves a dry chocolate taste in the mouth. I like the lower ABV, this makes it easier to enjoy a few in one session. Not quite Old Rasputin, but a great offering."
"Thin tan head on a dark brown body with reddish light shining around the edges. Little lacing that isn't very sticky. Chocolate ice cream nose. Seriously though... in ice cream form. Good roasted malt taste. Smooth feeling both in the mouth and on the way down. Nice roasted palate. This is another good stout."
"All-in-all, I thought this a very nice dry stout. I'm not sure where I got this particular sample, but I believe I picked it up during Murray's Wine & Spirits going-out-of-business sale."
"A nice tasty beer."
"Bottom line: Nice smoky stout. Best served slightly warmer."
"Pours a dark cola-like brown with a fluffy beige head. Aroma is a combination of burnt coffee and dark chocolate. Taste is roasted malt up front with notes of coffee and cocoa, and an appealing hop bitterness in the finish. This beer leaves a nice warming sensation in your stomach. This beer is light on the palate for a stout, with a taste that begs you to keep sipping. Nice offering. North Coast is a very solid brewery indeed."
"1 inch head, frothy, light-brown. Weak aroma, toasted, burnt, mild coffee. Nothing much else. Not very impressed. Would have expected more from the brewery that produces Rasputin. Coffee was th eonly distinctive aroma or taste. I'm not sure how old this bottle is since I picked it up at KClingers in Hanover, PA."
"This lacks the effortless quaffability that a certain stout from Dublin does, but still, it makes for a nice drink and I could absolutely see myself revisiting this in the future."
"D: Like it better than Guiness, doesn't have that flat taste like the other does, really lets me know I'm drinking a beer."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable beer. Alcohol low enough to be sessionable."
"Stouts always look dark brown to black and this one is no exception. Looks like coffee with a tan head. I think the roasting of the malt sort of gives this beer a semi-sweet coffee-like taste. This is a nice smooth stout that's not too bitter or pungent. I would classify this beer as one of the better stouts around."
"Pours almost black with a nice creamy/tan head. Smells of some malts, coffee, toffee, chocolate, smokey and nuts. Subtle flavors of sweetness along with every flavor the aroma promised. A little dry and bitter finish, same with the carbonation, a little. Had everything you could want in a stout just more mild than I would like in each category. I very much enjoyed this and could drink as many as I please."
"D: A great beer, easily sessionable, I could drink this all day, a great product from North Coast, kind of like a mini-Old Rasputin in a way."
"This beer poured a black color with a 1 head. The smell is sweet and a somewhat floral. The taste is roasted, caramel, malty and the hops were noticeable. The mouthfeel is medium to full. Overall, this is a tasty brew that seems to go down easy  I swear I just had a full glass here!"
"d- this is a pretty good stout, and one i would be able to drink a couple of in a night, tasty and a nice ild coffee and roasted flavors make it a nice mild flavored stout"
"D - Flawless. I could session with this on a hot day, or sip it slowly from a snifter in the winter. This is a remarkable brew that IMO is highly underrated."
"D - This is a really good stout, although it seems more like an Oatmeal Stout than an Irish Dry. Still it was very good."
"This stout was a nice surprise. Poured dark brown with a caramel hue shinning through that left a fizzy one finger tan head. The head didn't stick around for long. The true enjoyment is in the aroma. Upon pouring a blast of roasted grain, molasses and caramel hit my nose. Followed by dates, cola and licorice that ended with a hint of smoke and dark plum. This light to medium body brew started off with a roasted and smokey malt that was mask by a sweet cola and date middle. A moderate coffee bitter such as espresso was left lingering on the palate. Another plus, you can drink this all night and really enough it. Really good beer by North Coast. I paired this brew up with homemade Cherry cola BBQ sauce and baby back ribs, green apple cole slaw and roasted garlic potato salad. Enjoy"
"Notes: Another winner from North Coast. Really blows the ""Big 3"" nitro'ed stouts out of the water flavorwise. Excellent brew overall."
"This is very tasty, with roast and chocolate being cut through with a knife wielding hop. Dry, crisp, refreshing and very exacting. Medium bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. Well crafted and very easy to drink. So much so, that I will have another. Highly recommended."
"Highly drinkable. I've had better but considering the lack of quality Irish Dry Stouts available locally, sign me up. I'd take this over Guinness any day. And I hear North Coast WILL finally be available locally within the month!"
"Nice rocky head, steady and full and fluffy, tan atop a dark dark nearly opaque beer with a ruby overtone. The aroma is nice too, a lot of chocolate and nuttiness along with a soft caramel and toffee note. The flavor is good too, maybe not as dry as I'd expect for an ""Irish Dry Stout"" but that's a good thing - I get a lot of malt at first, then a slight acrid bitterness and coffee / roasted note, then finally a little dash of bitterness at the end that compliments the beer. This isn't a huge beer, but it is a rather nicely made brew with a good combination of ingredients and flavors."
"Really a nice beer. If it wasn't for the last-minute dry finish I might mistake this for a sweet stout."
"Poured into a standard pint glass. Poured a nice very dark reddish brown with a reasonable bubbly head that quickly disappeared. It left slight lacing around the glass that lasted the whole beer. Aroma was very pleasant, smelled of chocolate mousse. Taste varied, started off with hints of coffee, later on was slighty sweet with chocolate undertones. No bitterness at all in the mouth flavorwise, however the beer felt slightly acidic on the tounge which detracted from the flavor. Was easy to drink except for that acidity. A solid stout."
"This is a quite drinkable brew that is worth trying. If you see it, don't pass it up!"
"If Guiness tasted like this,I would drink guiness.This is a damn tasty beer and I think my first of the style.I had a SlyFox dry stout and it wasnt near tasty as this."
"I'd dink it again if it were given to me, but I regret not getting North Coast's Old Rasputin from the bottle (which was also on the menu) instead of this one which was of course on tap. Oh well."
"A great irish stout from North Coast."
"A wonderful Stout from our friends at North Coast. Cheers!"
"Not very good, a real let down as the first North Coast Beer I did not really like."
"D - Very drinkable for a Stout. A unique style for North Coast to brew and they brewed a great beer. None of the flavors are overwhelming, they blend well and leave a great taste in the mouth. I'd love to have another if I could, and if it was at a bar, I'd feel it necessary to order a second pint."
"The second serving went down even smoother I am surprised to say. With the first serving we find that a combonation of acidic flavors (chocolate, bitter, sweet) impacting an unprepared palate acts like an icy hot patch. At first there is a wincing intensity followed by warm chocolatey blandness. I did have one more that evening and that was enough for one night. Perhpas I grade this brew to harshly, but the standards of beer must be raised. I find this to be a very respectable product in that I could taste all that I was able to, the good and the bad. Thanks for not following the nitro-heads and being yourself. Cheers!"
"Pours a deep brown with a thick (>2"") foamy head. Although the head dissipates fairly quickly, lacing is thick and clumpy. Smell is malty with hints of chocolate. Not much of a roasted aroma however. Taste is excellent. The roasted malt is balanced by a nice, smokey flavor and mild, lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is typical for this style; dry, smooth, and creamy. Overall, this is a highly drinkable brew that won't disappoint."
"Drinkability: Tasty and easy to drink."
"This beer is just about average, nothing really great but at least solid and drinkable."
"12 oz. bottle- color of dark coffee , with a reasonable tan head - nose of mint chocolate chips , chili pepper?? , malts , and roasted note  taste of bittersweet chocolate , baking chocolate , and malty  body is creamy , and smooth balanced with some acidity aftertaste of milk chocolate , and bitter chocolate"
"This is one of my favorite stouts."
"Poured a very deep ruby/mahogany that you can barely see through if held up to bright light. Thinnest ring of small bubbles left around edge of glass. Not very big on smells. Can smell roasted malts but also a sweeter possibly caramel malts. Small coffee smell in there as well. Bitter coffee taste along with some dark chocolate. Roasted malts make up big part of taste as expected. Mouthfeel was on watery side like a Guiness and had little carbonation. Drinkability is average. Would pick this up if tired of Guiness as part of a mixed sixer, but would not buy an entire 6 of this."
"This is a solid stout, I'll try to keep these on hand"
"D - Like I said, much more drinkable than Old Rasputin in the sense that I can't imagine drinking a RIS everyday. Plus, as it warmed, I really got different tastes. Very glad I picked it up."
"Drinkability: Roasty and tasty! Lots of dark flavor and a good dose of pleasant bitterness leave me wanting another sip. Great stout. Almost like old rasputin's baby brother."
"Drinkability: Nice, not overly heavy. Very drinkable, a little tart."
"Easy to drink - rich and complex without being overly powerful. Alcohol is well-covered. This is one very nice stout!"
"I went through a bunch of beers from Northcoast of recent...I didn't care too much for most of the ale's or lagers from the brewery but this stout will be revisted time and again. Thin but very flavorful. Deep roasted coffee and caramel...the coffee really lingers and is nice. The head poured about 1"" but dissapated rather quickly...this beer at first appears to be characterstically... an average stout... but the taste raises it to the next level. A very drinkable and flavorful stout that's drinkability doesn't suffer at all from its' out of character(for the style) thin mouthfeel. IMO this is the best mass circulated northcoast brew."
"This is a very drinkable beer which I will be purchesing in the furture and will try to get my hands on some more of North Coast beer."
"No problem with this one, it's totally enjoyable, though when it comes to any kind of stout, North Coast's own Rasputin is still king."
"This is a nice dry stout. It's not overly aggressive or over the top in anyway and is just solid all around."
"First of the North Coast Brews that I have had and it is a decent beer"
"Overall: Very good. Truthfully my only other experiences in the dry Irish stout style is Murphy's and Guiness. And maybe I'm blaspheming, but I think this one is beating them out. A very solid pour."
"D: Overall about average for a dry stout. Not the greatest beer in the world, but fans of the style should like it."
"Drinkability: Not too heavy. Low carbonation and medium alcohol level make this a good easy drinking beer."
"Pours a dark brown/black color, nice carbonation, not much of a head though and quickly disappears, a few nice island appear. Scents of malts, slight hops, coffee, and caramel. The taste is of roasted sweet malts, and a nice caramel dry finish. Medium body. A pretty tasty brew from North Coast, would recommend. Thanks jhammerly."
"The drinkability is good, but not quite what I want, Prosit MK"
"D- sessionable and tasty, i'd go for this again but this is not a brew i'd crave for, good for style."
"Very, very glad I tried this. It poured a nice dark reddish brown, not quite black, with a very pretty, slightly pitted, khaki coloured head that satyed around for several minutes. Definately looked better than average. Smell is dry roasted grain and fresh brewed coffee. Nice. Taste is very dry. Burnt malt up front with a subtle bitter finish; dry all the way through. Mouthfeel was excellent for the style, I thought. This would make a perfect session stout. I'm quite impressed with this one. Another winner from North Coast."
"Drinkability is high here. I could see drinking a lot of this beer."
"The body is good for a stout but the dry finish is a bit of a deterrent in mouthfeel. Carbonation is a low but ok for style. A easy beer to drink but maybe they should use less aged materials (38?)."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, low in alcohol, good flavour, a nice offering from North Coast. For stouts this is one of the easiest in terms of drinking a few."
"All in all this is a great beer to sit down with over a couple pints. Light and quaffable, yet at the same time chewy and interesting. If I had to perfect this I would add a touch more chocolate and sweet malt notes to balance the roast acidity, but then it would not be nearly so quaffable."
"I don't know how many I can handle in a night. The flavor of burnt grains left in the back of my mouth might warrent a chaser, but I'm too full from the mild, yet filling creaminess."
"D- It's an average beer. Kind of weak. Not to bad though."
"a good stout, it'll warm you up on a cold day, great beer."
"Good no-nonsense stout."
"Definately worth a try."
"Pours a slightly thin, somewhat translucent deep ruby brown. Looks almost like a dark ale rather than a Stout. Produces a thick, rocky and long lasting light tan head. No lacing. Mild, but pleasant aromas of charcoal, coffee beans, Bakers chocolate and dark roasted malts. Mouthfeel fairly thin and watery with a slightly fizzy carbonation. Initial flavor is of charcoal and charred malts followed by a balancing subdued malt and toffee sweetness. Some chocolate and coffee notes also come through. Finish is light and thin, but with a pleasant minerally/charred wood dryness. A solid, but kinda lightweight stout."
"D- Nice for the style. Very dry but a great session beer with the low ABV."
"Pours a clear, dark, deep brown color and a minor layer of foam. Light malt nose with a slightly more hoppy floral scent. Roasted coffee and a nice hop bitterness. Dry chalky finish. Thin to medium body and a good mouth, watery and a little chewy. Halfway through sweet brown sugar appears, matched with charcoal bitterness. Descent beer at best."
"The beer pours near-opaque with ruby highlights under a low tan glass ring, which leaves nice lacing. The nose is strong with roast, very appetizing. Taste is very roasty with light chocolate and heavy coffee notes. The mouth feel is thin with low carbonation, making this an easy drinker. A very nice stout."
"Medium bodied, a bit light for the style but not bad, fairly smooth and easily drinkable. Definitely worth a try for the dry stout lover or as an intro to the style."
"overall, this is a quality beer that i will have again in the future"
"A nice dry stout. Flavor is robust and interesting. As mentioned previously, it is a little thin but certainly drinkable. Good job."
"While it has some body, it seems a little on the watery side overall in body and in flavor. The flavor is nice and this is one of the easiest drinking stouts that doesn't just plug you...good for the beginner."
"Pours black with a really great head. It looks like a nitro pour, but the tap is just CO2. Pretty impressive! The smell is dry, roasty barley with a sweet malt background. Taste is dry bakers' chocolate. The chocolate taste is strong, but not overpowering. The mouthfeel is a bit lighter than I expected, and this particualr pour is a bit higher carbonated than I would have liked. Drinkability is good, but it's a sipping beer rather than a quaffing beer."
"Sits a tad heavy on the stomach, but it's a stout. Overall quite good. I would buy it again, and I'd certainly drink it over Guinness in the Irish dry stout category."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, this is a great stout that can hold its own against some of the bigger names. Highly recommended. I really enjoyed this brew!"
"-Oelergud"
"D: The flavor isn't quite like any Irish dry that I've had so far, but damn is it good. However, the light body in contrast to the full flavor is a bit unsettling. Nonetheless, this is an enjoyable and quite drinkable beer."
"Mouthfeel is far too carbonated! And yet it is, other than this, full and creamy on the tounge in an impressive way, but the carbonation is too dominant for this style. Drinkabilitywise, it's easy to get this beer down and it's good, but it's not better than Sierra Nevada stout--next to food especially--which is when I am most often drinking a stout...so it does not live up to my hopes and dreams. North coast crafts another notable brew that I will, alas, not stock--as like many of their other brews, very good but not best of style."
"d - not rasputin light at all. very enjoyable and easy to drink."
"DIm having this as a nightcapand its great for that. Not sure that I could drink a lot of these, but it is taste enough to sip."
"Pours black with a thin tan head that fades quickly. Smells sweet with chocolate notes, some malt and burnt flavors as well. This one has similar tastes with a bitter aftertaste and some what of a bite to it, mostly a dry finish. Nothing really stands out from this stout, but it is quite tasty. Just nothing that sets itself apart from most other stouts. This is a bit thin bodied, but doesn't take away from the beer. It has good drinkability pretty smooth, I can find myself drinking these all the time. Something to try for any stout drinker!"
"Overall: A solid brew with a definate hop presence. Another solid offering from North Coast."
"Cheers."
"A great example of an Irish Dry Stout! North Coast continues to impress me with every beer of theirs I try."
"I was surprised by the mouthfeel and drinkability. This beer is thick but not chewy in the mouth, and is not too heavy for a stout on the stomach. I found it to be quite drinkable, and did not feel too filled up after it was finished."
"North Coast's ""other"" stout pours quite dark but not black, with coffee highlights at the edges. The nose is all roasted malt, with hints of dark chocolate and road dust thrown in. The nose hints at a very dry beer, and that impression is confirmed by the flavor of the beer, which is bitter right from the start with roasted malts. The bitterness softens a bit into a more rounded, hop-influenced bitterness, but this beer never stops being bitter and never stops being dry. Quite a nice stout, but definitely meant to be drunk slowly -- the bitterness is too intense, for me at least, to bolt this down."
"Pours a deep black color, tinged with red, with a good creamy head, somewhat bubbled, but not too much lacing, just spots of foam running down back onto edge. Not catching a very strong aroma here, but there is a nice roasted malt and toffee duo going on, with faint dark fruits underneath thats pretty nice. But, thats about it. So good, just need more. Taste has good amount of roasted toasted malts, the dark fruits in there, and its really all good and great, but like the aroma it just falls short, not enough strength to stnad up to the taste. Its not like I want something bang! pow! super tons of malts and hops or whatever, but just enough so it doesn't seem watered down. Or perhaps its because I wasn't impressed with the body, thought it a little lacking. It finished off nice, with this nice dry roastiness, but still lacking something. Still, a rather tasty beer that I want again."
"Poured a deep reddish-brown color with abundant tannish puffy head that fell to a thin coating. Absolutely beautiful lacing on the side of the glass. Smell is darrk and roasty. Strong coffee notes present. Unsweetened chocolate also present. Taste is stong on coffee, with strong burnt malt textrires also present. Strong malt gives way to a profound hoppy dryness. Finished nice and dry with a lingering bitter dryness as its ending note. Nice and creamy and extremely refreshing. An excellent example of the style with great drinkability. Great job!"
"This pours a very dark ruby black with a large foamy tan head. The smell is faint with some roasted malt,but little else. The high carbonation helps make this a very tasty beer. The coffee and roasted malt flavors are very pronounced in this beer. The m/f is medium with a very good balance of flavors ending with a toffee aftertaste. This is a very good beer that should not be missed. North Coast is a fine brewer."
"An OK stout but I doubt that I would buy this again. This just doesn't stand out from the crowd of other stouts on the market."
"Old No. 38 pours with out of the bottle with a good deal of carbonation resulting in a lasting head of foam that leaves some nice lacing down the sides of the glass. This stout isn't too dark, with ruby highlights evident along the sides of my pint glass as I hold it up to the light. One of the best things about this beer is its cocoa-like aroma, almost more reminiscent of baking chocolate. This isn't a very full-boded stout, which is probably one of the characteristics that puts into the dry category. The predominant flavor in this stout is chocolate malt, with a slightly roasted coffee finish accented by big bitter burst of hops. A superb silkly smooth mouthfeel adds to the whole experience. This is definitely one of my favorite stouts."
"Pours out a nice head that falls and leaves a strong lacing. The smell is chocolately with a little coffee. Smooth and inviting. Taste is bitter chocolate with a nice coffee aftertaste. This is the hoppiest stout I've ever had, but it is from the west coast. The hops even out the flavor as you drink. Feels smooth in the mouth. It's a little different than the malty stouts I predominately try, but still very nice."
"Bottle: Poured a clear light black color stout with a bigger then average creamy off-white head with pretty good retention. Aroma of coffee was pretty intense with some roasted malt. Coffee taste was not as dominant as I would have expected because of the aroma. Body is quite light with low carbonation. Hops level is definitely too low for my own taste. Not bad overall but a bit boring I guess."
"My girlfriend bought a six-pack of this since we both like North Coast Pranqster so much. It appears black in the tall mug that I poured it into, held against the light it is a very rich dark brown. This beer pours thick with a very thin mocha colored head that fades quickly leaving a fairy ring with some lacing as I drink it. The aroma is of dark chocolate and malty with a hint of coffee lurking in the shadows. It tastes full of roasted chocolate and caramel. The complexity of the flavor is really good but it comes off lacking something. I cant put my finger on it really. It seems a bit thin in the mouthfeel and that may be it. It has the potential flavor but the body just doesnt back it up. I can definitely drink more of this but it always makes me want to tweak with the recipe in my head, trying to make it better."
"This was oh so average. Nothing to see here folks move along. Black body topped with a slight tan head, giving way to some lacing. Smell is very muted, a little roastedness and coffee shine through. The taste is roasty coffee but it doesn't really finish dry and the body was too thin. I could drink this one again but I might be bored. Yawn, well on to the next one."
"Overall- a stout that is just on the edge of bursting with flavor but just doesn't quite go over the edge. Smooth and easy drinking."
"Drinkability: Relatively light-bodied for a stout and low in alcohol, this is very drinkable, but would be even more so if it had a stronger flavor."
"Jet black pour from 12oz bottle with nice tan head. Taste has nice roasted malt taste, but also seems crisp for lack of a better description. Not a bad stout, but somehow I feel a bit disappointed with it. Definitely worth a try though. A bit lighter in taste perhaps than some of my favorites in this style."
"Another winner from a fine brewery."
"Drinkability: This is a masterful easy drinking uncomplicated beer. This would be a perfectly sessionable beer."
"Pours a nice rich brown with a tan head. Smell was roasted,but sour. I was not crazy about the smell. Mouth feel is watery,with little carbionation, Taste was fairly light and roasted,with a slight hop kick. This beer looks much better than it tastes. It tastes better than it smells."
"Altogether the thinness of this brew makes it quite refreshing, if nothing else, and more drinkable. I would be interested in trying this on tap, or the imperial version."
"Nevermind."
"This brew pours a black color. The head is one-finger in height with a speckled off white and light tan color. Lacing is fairly good. The aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, more roasted malt and a lot more chocolate. There is a lot more aroma than I would expect from an Irish dry stout. The taste is the same as the aroma; roated malt with chocolate tones. In general the taste is mellow. Not mellow in that it is lacking or faint, because it is flavoful, Instead, I mean mellow in that it is simple and relaxing. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with perhaps a bit too much carbonation. Overall, this is a very solid beer, and a hell of a lot better than Guinness."
"The finish is quite dry with a huge bitter lingering on the back of the tongue. Strange, since I can't particularly taste hops in this stout. This is not a beer I will be purchasing again. Unfortunately this beer is nothing compared to Old Rasputin, which isn't available around here."
"Mahogany color with dark brown head that falls fast, but thats ok for this style beer. Dark chocolate dominated bouquet. Strong roasted flavor, some hopped dryness and sweet malt notes. The mouth feel is really very nice. Both chewy and slick but finishes very dry and refreshing. Not the most complex or bold stout on the market but defiantly one that could that could be drunk right after another."
"cheers..."
"Mahogany colored with ruby highlights coming through the edges. Light brown head rises up and falls quickly, exposing an aroma of sassafras and brown sugar, followed by powdery sweet cocoa. Taste is darker and more pungent than the aroma suggests. It's very even without any flavors taking over - semisweet chocolate followed by bitter espresso, followed by charred wood, with nuances of molasses and brown sugar. An understated hop bitter rides beneath, providing a good contrast to the other flavors. A bitter smoke lingers. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy, full and round. Very drinkable for my tastes. Thanks to BuckeyeNation for sending this one along."
"What a fantastic beer! Nothing like Old Rasputin, but equally impressive. This is another fine beer from the North Coast Brewing Company. I really need to get out to California."
"Overall a good beer. There are better choices out there but I wouldn't turn this one down. Especially if your looking for a more bitter stout."
"This is a fine stout. I can definitely drink more than 1 in a sitting."
"This beer is dark. It had a small head at first but that went away rather quickly. It has a very bitter taste and that certainly affects mouthfeel and drinkability. I think there are better stout choices out there but this one would work if needed. Too bitter af an aftertaste to suit me."
"From notes. Poured deep deep brown color with rusty hues and sparse head. Nose was roasty and chocolatey, but more in the roasty department. I enjoyed it. Taste was not as good as the nose. It was mostly roasted with a light hop bitter, but a lingering hop that stuck around just a bit too long for my taste. I would have liked to see a touch of the chocolatey sweetness in there as well. The feel was light moderate with an active carbonation. Overall, a solid beer. Flavor was a touch thin for me, but otherwise good."
"Serviceable pleasant stout, with roast in nose. Dark black, roasted barley and chicory and some sourness in finish, and chocolate bar sugar and bit of chocolate malt. No complaints with this brewery. Medium mouthfeel, with biscuit crumbs. Dry aftertaste."
"Medium body and frothy. The best, most robust of the three, I think, but not outstanding."
"The burnt dark chocolate taste and metallic/astringent finish makes this a difficult taste to aquire."
"A good stout all around. Very impressive thick dense head for a non-nitro stout. Enjoyable late blooming flavors (again) that take the flavor profile to another level. West coast version of a Bell's Kalamazoo Stout perhaps?"
"This beer pours a dark brown with a slight ruby tint to it. The head is slightly dark tan. It is fluffy and fades slowly leaving decent lacing. It smalls malty. It has a sweet molasses aroma to it. Roasted malt aroma is present. It has a slight chocolate aroma also. It has a stromg coffee flavor to it. The roasted malts are quite present. It is sweet, with a little chocolate flavor. Very roasted though, that is the strongest flavor I detect. This beer is thick and smooth. It is full bodied, leaving a coffeelike taste on the palate. It is carbonated well. I think that beer might make a good session beer. It is low in alcohol, so that wouldnt be a factor. Also, the flavor, while slightly aggressive, is smooth enough to enjoy. I think this is a good beer that is definately worth a try."
"Taste is much like the smell. Bitter latte, dark chocolate, creamy, milky flavors. The nitro left it creamy and smooth (took it forever to settle btw). An easy drinker for sure but very full flavored. A well-crafted straightforward stout. You replace all the nitro Guinness taps with this stuff and you might have world peace or something."
"This is quite an easy drinking beer, I can definitely see myself picking up some more in the future."
"Found in the Cost Plus 2004/05 Winter Brews pack."
"Leaves behind a sweet taste in my mouth. I could definately put down a few of these. I'm a big fan of stouts, and this is one of the better ones I've tried. I'll be picking up a six-pack of these next time I'm out."
"Impression: understandibly a winter beer. Chocolates make it a beer that would nicely conclude any meal."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The thin, watery mouthfeel makes this brew easy drinkin', but the incongruencies in its DNA would prevent me from repurchasing."
"OK ! The web page notes that this is a Dublin Dry Stout. Now this brew makes sense, it is Not an American Stout. A fine blackish brew with a frothy tan head, lacing all the way down, NICE ! You can smell the chocolate malts, which smoothly flow into a dry, cocoa powder quaff that finishes with traces of burnt toast. Somewhat thin, especially towards the end of the second pint. A dry (46 IBUs) brew, it will make for a pleasant evening of drinking."
"."
"It's a good enough stout. I'd have no trouble recommending this one."
"This beer pours a dark, deep tar black color with minimal head retention. The smells are of molasses, chocolate, caramel, and dark rich coffee. Very strong in the nose. This beer looks and smells like it could knock over a horse. The first taste is of molasses outlined with malty notes and a few bitter hops. Then comes the colombian coffee aftertaste. The strong, freshly roasted coffee flavor is highly acceptional and welcomed. Throughout the beer, the flavors of coffee, molasses, and sweet caramel bounce back and forth, each taking advantage of their turn on my palate. Old No. 38 is a very drinkable beer as well, not too thick and very refreshing. Highly recommended to all beer lovers."
"The taste was favorably creamy although not very thick. I got hints of cap metals in the first few pulls, which quickly subsided. What was left to shine were the chocolate malt tones and the mild hoppy finish. Tastey stuff without a doubt. I got to the bottom of this glass more quickly than I had wished to. What can you do when faced with a delicious beer? Drink it! Very well done. Flavors were well pronounced and just right. Choo, Choo!!!"
"Deep ruby color, clear, with a thin beige head. Aroma is predominatly roasted, coffee-like and malty; citrus-hop, fruity notes. Flavor starts with sweet malt, followed by roasted coffee and hop bitterness. Pleasant coffee finish. A very enjoyable, drinkable stout. I will make a note to get this one when I can."
"The pour was dark with a garnet hue - clear - thin. The head rushed to a good 2 fingers with a soap suds top. In just a few minutes the head was gone and the suds remained. The nose was of roasted malts and barley mirroring a mellow roasted grain coffee with an ever slight chocolate. Somehing came up and tickled my nose - must have been hops. The mouth was thin, high toned, and short. It was semi-crisp, smooth, with a slight hop underlying and mingling with the malt. Underneath it all was nothing. It was as if only the top third was palpable. The finish was thin, slightly dry and very short. Guess I expected more. I've so enjoyed North Coast brews especially the Old Rasputin."
"Pouring at room temperature from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass, this pours a dark chestnut/ruby color with 3 inches of seafoam head that clings to the glass and leaves a nice surface layer on top of the pretty stout. Taking a whiff, I smell the aromas of robust brown malts giving a slight chocolate or almond aroma. I also smell the hint of some earthy hops there. Not overly complex, but decent. Taking a sip, i first taste some fruitiness up front (sweetness) followed by some chocolate and nut flavors. Maybe even hints of caramel accompany the chocolate flavor when first sipping. The finish is a little more bitter than the initial sip, due to some hops flavors coming through a little. Very robust beer with a nice feel. The carbonation is not overpowering helping with flavor, alcohol is not there too much either. Just a nice full-bodied ale with nice features that are not blowing you away, but making you realize that this is a nice brew that you could drink all night."
"This is a nice american stout, but i personally like em rougher ;)"
"Tap@North Coast. This was pretty tasy, quite toasty/roasty. Some smokeyness in there aswell. Nutty and chocolatey, long dry finish, really tasty. A really good stout, my favourite at the north Coast taprrom, good balance and lots of flavour, look forward to trying it again."
"This beer looks great. Dark brown, not quite black body, with some ruby highlights, great tan head. Good retention and nice lacing. Lots of roasted malt in the aroma and slightly smokey. Taste: blech. There's a really metallic taste that is just completely overpowering. It tastes like blood. (I don't drink blood, but have had the taste in my mouth ;-) I've really never tasted something like this, not good at all. I think there must be something wrong with this bottle. I'm going to try another one sometime soon and edit this. Hopefully it will be better,"
"Deep black color with just a hint of a ruby highlight. A thick, dense tan colored head topped the beer, and slowly settled to a clingy sheet of lace on the side of the glass. The nose has milk chocolate hints and something that hints of blooming flowers, roses almost, backed by a pine hop hint. The taste is more acidic than what I expected. The hops come to the front. The chocolate is there, milder than I anticipated and delivered along with a roasted/nutty malt component. Medium mouth feel, slightly thinner than I would want, but still very drinkable."
"Overall, an adequate beer, but not exceptional. In a pinch, it would be fine, but I won't go out of my way to find it again."
"Most excellent brew. Poured a deep brown color with an nice head that persisted to the bottom of the glass. An really nice balanced atste with coffee and slight hops you note as it first enters the mouth. Very drinkable. It would be a hit with those who are not huge fans of traditional dry stout."
"Pours dark brown, was expecting black, so that explains my low appearence score. But besides that I think it is an excellent beer. I aroma is nice with hints of coffee, chocolate, and hops. The taste is not to bitter, with a little bit of coffee and chocolate with a little sweetness. The mouthfeel is dead on. I really like this beer, but i would call it a porter, not a stout."
"Mouthfeel is pretty thin, especially for a stout. Body is very light, more like a brown ale, bordering on watery. Not bad tasteing, certainly not stout enough for my expectations though. It displays very little of the requisite characteristics of this style, for that, it's score suffers."
"Dark chocolate brown, almost black. Smells of roasted malt and coffee, with lingering toffee/semi-sweet chocolate notes. Smooth, with the chocolate flavors really coming out in the taste, and a nice light hop bitterness at the end. No. 38 is quite easy to drink, even more so than say, SN Stout. Another good one out of Ft. Bragg."
"Comments - This really is stout done right! I was a bit nervous to try it because I did not remember seeing it around before. However, North Coast Brewing delivers on this one. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability- Nice stout that I would try again if given the chance. Would really like to try it at the brewery on tap."
"This is an excelent medium bodied stout. It poured a very dark brown/black color with a decent brownish head that stuck around and created some nice lacing down my glass. The smell was very smoky and slightly bittersweet. The flavor was great with a nice blend of dark coffee flavors, semi-sweet malt and a nice burnt roastiness that tasted great on this cold night. Definantly one of the more drinkable stouts concitering it's nice body. Recommended."
"Dark brown in color, nice lasting creamy tan head that leaves a sticky lacing in my glass, roasty chocolate-coffee aromas. Roasted burnt chocolate coffee, nice bitter-sweet flavors, good roasted bitterness in the finish. Medium body, kind of porter like."
"roasted flavor on the end turning into a burnt flavor aftertaste, bummer up til then it was exactly as it smelled and was expected. gonna have to change my snack to finish.. cant have that flavor clash."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"A dark, translucent brownish-black brew poured from the bottle. The head is a somewhat shallow, but leaves a fine, thin lace. The aroma is a mix of hops and roasted, nutty graincoffee beans and acorns? At times it seems a bit acidic and has a metallic feel. The mouthfeel is a little weak for the style, and seems, at times, watery. Still, its smooth, tasty, and has a mild-sweetness thats appealing. The relatively low carbonation also contributes to the smooth feel. Not an outstanding stout, but worth a try."
"Stout colored. Deep brown, low co2 and a light brown head. Head retention is good and the lacing is slippery. Aromas are roasty with some malt/caramel representation with some aroma hops and an earthiness. Flavor is biting from the start with some sweetness hanging in the background. Palate is light bodied and watery with a lingering hop finish."
"All in all an ""ehhh"" stout. It was fine, I'd drink it again if it's all that was available but I could name a half dozen other stouts that are much more worth my time."
"While i feel that this is one of North Coast's better efforts... though none are really bad, i do wish that it had a bit more body."
"Pours with a two-finger light brown head that fades slowly and leaves a good lace. Virtually black color. Good carbonation. Nose is coffee. Strong coffee flavor, good stout but finishes with a hard water taste. $1.90 for a 12oz bottle from Vintage Cellar Blacksburg, VA"
"This is a very drinkable brew."
"12 ouncer, twist top, no freshness indicator to be found. Pours dark molasas, fairly light for a stout. moderate head/carbonation. Leaves only minimal lacing. Nose is caramel, and coffee. Rich and thick mouthfeel, especially as this one warms up abit. Toffee, expresso, burnt flavors, pleasant and drinkable. Decent, lighter then average stout. Probably needs some more black grains to beef up the roasted flavors and ""ooommph"" of this one."
"I had a difficult time enjoying this beer due to the lack of smell and the metallic taste was a real turn off."
"Mouthfeel was not as thick as I expected. Likewise drinkability... it was good, but I wouldn't buy more than a couple of these at any one time."
"A very easy drinking stout that is robust in flavor. Very flavorful and also filling. Even though the alcohol's down to 5.6% abv it still tastes very hearty. A solid take on the style."
"I prefer stouts--even Irish Dry ones--that hang around, make some conversation, get comfortable in the mouth and then say a lingering goodbye. Old No. 38 pulls into the station, slows down a bit and then chugs away with a weak toot of the whistle. It's an enjoyable ride while it lasts, but it could have been so much more."
"Pours a dark brownish cola color. Light shines through towards the bottom of the glass. Lacing isn't to spectacular but is present. The smell is slightly of roasted malt/caramel, fairly clean to the nose. The taste is very sweet with the roasted mocha/caramel. A slight hoppy bitterness is present but very light and refreshing. Actually a fairly nice stout to drink in the summer, light like a porter but filling and strond on roasted taste like a stout. Very good."
"Ocean flavor persists along with that smoky/roasted malt presence that was evident in the aroma. There is a touch of sweetness at first, and in the finish. Finish is also very bitter, causing a bit of mouth pucker. Not my favorite stout."
"Are you sure this is a stout? What kind? It pours, smells, and tastes more like a porter (if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, looks like a duck, hmm...) Pours dark brown with a tan head that quickly disappears. Smells like coffee and malts. Taste is rather boring with carbonation dominating and not much mystery to it. It was a pretty drinkable brew but just not my definition of a stout. Not a good example."
"A little plain, but there's nothing wrong with it."
"Medium in body but the carbonation is a bit heavy for me. Good taste, but a bit difficult to drink; lots of carbonation."
"Pours a dark cola, opaque black body with a moderate tan head that hangs around for a few minutes. Nice sheets and patches of lace adorn the glass. Aroma is subdued, with burnt coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Mouthfeel is light bodied, amply carbonated, and has a mild, peppery, hops bite on the tongue. Dark, roasted malt flavors dominate the taste. Chocolate, roasted coffee, and a chicory nuttiness, all dominate. Bitter hops provide a nice balance. Above average for an Ameican stout, but nothing extraordinary. Nice drinkability."
"At about $7.30 for 6 this will absolutely be on my rebuy list."
"The beer pours a deep black color with a thin off-white head. The aroma is good. It has a nice black malt/ roasted scent that is a bit dry and awfully malty. The taste is good. It has a rich black malt flavor that is dry and dark tasting. It goes down easy and finishes with a black malt aftertaste. The mouthfeel is great. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine stout with great flavor and mouthfeel; an excellent sessions brew."
"DRINKABILITY: A good session stout that stands up well to others in this catagory. While I wouldn't actively seek it out, I also would not try to avoid another 'Old 38' experience."
"Overall Impression: A bit toward the bitter side of the equation for a stout, but a rich and complex taste. Much like Old Rasputin over all, and while I’m a big fan of Old Rasp, the toned down version just didn’t click with me. Worth a try, and a happy karma point, but don’t think I’ll be getting another soon."
"Drinkability - a rather drinkable stout, a good pick for someone who wants a beer with some personality, but would be overwhelmed by an Imperial or other thick brew. Perhaps a nice stepping stone to that next level of beer appreciation."
"Escapes into the Duvel tulip with a large and lacy deep tannish head. Clear very dark brown liquid with ruby highlights. Roasty nose with a subtle smoky, chocolatey notes too. A somewhat thinnish body supports flavors of bitter roasted barley bite, paired with some slight fruitiness and charcoal-like tastes. Finishes with a bitter chocolate/hoppy note. Nice and drinkable, but needs some more body to raise it to a very good stout level. As it stands now, it reminds me of a robust porter in body/taste."
"I'm not a huge fan of stouts but this was part of a sampler and when I actually drink a stout I'm usually surprised to find that I like them more than I thought. This was very solid, simple and easy to drink. Poured your typical dark brown/black with a little bubbly tan head that disipated quickly with barely any lace to speak of down the glass. The smell was coffee, chocolate, some over-ripe dark fruit and burnt or roasted grains. The taste was very heavy on the coffee but in a good way. Almost like drinking ice coffee (which I love) and the alcohol was hidden well with a slight hint of bittersweet chocolate. The mouthfeel was clean, nothing cloying or overly sweet and this topped off the night well. I couldn't drink more than 2 or these (or any stout --- except a dry one like Guinness) hence the lower drinkability. Another nice offering from North Coast."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, a hearty 3/4 inch light brown head formed over the reddish-mahogany colored liquid. Great malt nose, with coffee and chocolate out in force. The coffee flavor seems to dominate, with the other grains rounding things out, and a slight hops bite to finish it off. Maybe just the right beer at the right time and place, but this one hit the spot."
"I really wanted to like this, and I thiought I would based on the smell. It isn't really bad, just disapointing. While it's better than a lot of other beers out there that are truly bad, there are plenty of better stouts out there as well."
"North Coast No. 38 Stout: A thin stout. Pours without a lot of head, despite a vigorous pour. What little head it had was deep tan, but dissipated very quickly. The aroma was the best part of this beer, rich and smooth, very roasted malt aroma. As is typical, the aroma leads into the taste, very nice roasted malt taste with a bare hint of chocolate/toffee and coffee. The problem with this beer is the mouthfeel is very weak, this is a relatively thin stout, not much to hang the nice flavors off. Needs a backbone."
"($6.99 / 6-pack)"
"This brew is dark but not dark enough. When put to the light test is apppears to be a deep red color. An aggressive pour produced a small, frothy head that faded nearly as fast as was made. All that was left was a small group of bubbles. The scent is a bit sweet with chocolate tones. The taste is a lot like its smell. The flavor is sweet with chocolate and malt tones. Mouthfeel comes up a little too thin for me. A small aftertaste finishes a bit dry. I was looking for a bit more from this beer."
"**Pocket A's in one hand, Old No. 38 Stout in my other**"
"Probably my favorite beer so far from these folks. Very, very drinkable, with solid, robust flavor. Excellent malt flavor, with a very drinkable grainy chocolate malt unmistakability. One of my top stouts."
"Drinkability is good for a stout. I can really imagine myself knocking these back like I might an IPA. Good introductory stout, but not your typical North Coast selection."
"Pleasantly surprised with this one...I wasn't expecting much based upon the color and pour, but this is an enjoyable stout with some complexeties and depth beyond it's appearance. A little light in color and body, but worth a try."
"Flavor starts with a touch of sweetness before a big chicory and roast bite rises up and dries out your palate just in time for a large grassy hop bite and a long lingering dryness."
"Poured a black with a ruby shine towards the base of my glass. Had a nice fluffy tan head and a little bit of lacing. The nose was super soft and fruity with just hints here and there of coffee, but in my opinion the nose was too delicate and didn't stand up well to the job. Taste was subdued and full of light coffee flavors and a more pronounced flavor of whole beans. This went well with the roasty malt flavors evident further down the glass. The mouthfeel was not too thin, but it could have been thicker. I think I would like to see a nitro-draught of this as it would be an excellent alternative to guinness, which is the standard in the style."
"i could have thought this was a porter."
"Overall, a good, drinkable stout - nothing special, but perfectly acceptable."
"The feel is super; full and creamy smooth without any sense of being syrupy. A very drinkable stout, but just a bit short on flavors."
"Pours a deep coppery brown with a nice thicket of beige to tan colored head. Nice lacing. Toasted malt aroma, vanilla and cocoa, orange zest, bakers chocolate in there, too. A bit thin, but the toasted malty flavors of a stout are there. Rather quaffable. Right balance of hops. Good."
"Seemed light in the body for the style but that certainly made it more drinkable. A little light for me but still a quality brew."
"Overall a good stout."
"Update  I originally reviewed this in 2003 but drink it regularly so am posting an update with a 2005 vintage. I juggled some scores around but over all this is a good stout that smells terrific."
"a few shades off midnight black. full and foamy tan head. light burnt coffeeish aroma. medium body supported by adequate carbonation. could be a little thicker. delicate burnt roasted caramel flavors, with a commanding yet not overwhelming hop presence. sturdy and well built dry stout. i could easily have two or thee of these in a sitting."
"Mostly black in color, highlights of a darkish ruby hue. Beige head, the apex was almost two fingers worth, collapsed quickly to half that size, the remainder hung around for a while; it does lace very well. Lightly roasty malts emphasize the nose, distant coffee and chocolate hints too. Stout-like and inviting. Tasty palate, dry roasted malts upfront, far from dominating but solid enough. In the middle, charcoal and chocolate notes wafts through, a faint kiss of sweetness. The finish is also dry but heavier on the coffee taste, hops bitterness. This is pretty much all you want in a Dry Stout. Exceptionally drinkable! Simple but well constructed, session brew material. Medium-full body, light carbonation very good mouthfeel. Just think of how many great Dry Stouts are ruined by that nitro-gimmick Im very glad this one is not. Recommended."
"Color is a dark coffee brown with dark ruby highlights when put up to the light, thin compact tannish head fading fairly slow to leave ink blot patches of crumbly lace. Aroma is dark, sweet chocolate and a nice alcoholic warmth and spice. Also blends in some nice malty roastyness and dried hops with a nice overlaying touch of fresh coffee beans. Taste is quite different then what the smell leads on; mostly a heavy roasted flavor with an older left-in-the-pot coffee sense, a milding roasted sweetness and the chocolate is all but gone from the nose with only hints of cocoa powder and light burnt brownie drying that comes in and through the finish. Feel is medium bodied with a creamy start and middle wrapping up the finish with a favorable little bittering and drying factions with notes of cocoa, coffee, and cinnamon. A nice stout with a great nose and a nice finish. A solid stout all the way."
"This is a wickedly good stout. I could seriously drink this beer all night long. What a pleasant surprise."
"A full-flavored stout but not captivating due to its simplicity. A good tasting session ale with a highly thin mouthfeel, it was a bit tangy for me to be a drinkable stout."
"Gigantic creamy head with excellent chocolate brown appearance. Good malty aroma. Taste was a bit tart on the raosted malt side with an aftertaste that was ok, but not great. Had a medium mouthfeel that didn't feeel overly smooth. Definitely not a guzzler..ok on the sipping scale, but not great."
"A stout that drinks very well. A dry quality that allows this stout to be enjoyed with certain foods. A stout that is not as thick as others but definately has a nice kick to it. Enjoy if you like bitter and not sweet stouts."
"Clear dark ruby appearance. Good sized creamy and somewhat rocky light brown head. Head has great retention. Looks the part. The nose is great. Roasted malt, coffee bean, bittersweet chocolate...lovely aroma. Mouthfeel is lowly carbonated and quite creamy. Body checks in a little better than medium. The flavors don't quite live up to my expectations after sniffing, but are good nonetheless. Fairly big bitterness stemming from roasted malts and probably some west coast hops. Baker's chocolate, milk sugar and java come to mind while drinking. Solid stout."
"Another brew picked up at the local Cost Plus. Nice full tannish head from a dark brown brew leaving a nice lacing down the glass. Smells detected include coffee and chocolate. Nice taste of a creamy coffee and chocoate with a nice hop finish. Mouth feel is smooth going down initially and left with a dryness. Nice beer that is very drinkable, would not mind seeing this one again."
"I like this stout. Black in appearance (but not a 'black hole') with a very minimal head. A 'burnt' and roasty smell. I concur with Putnam in that it smells like a ""mint chocolate chip milkshake"" - good analogy! Taste is of burnt, roasted coffee. A very good, full mouthfeel....very 'milky'. I could drink several of these! This was my second beer of the day, had Guinness extra stout right before this one, and this one was considerably more enjoyable."
"Dark brown color, medium head. Deeply roasted malts, coffee and chocolate flavor, some hop spiciness. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is smooth and slightly dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, some malt sweetness. Taste is a little thin for a stout, but still a very nice beer."
"Strong on eucalyptus, bitter chocolate and espresso, these images recombine on the palate to argue with the glossy, cream and milk texture. Dry, with every possible bitter nuance in the spectrum, there is a surprisingly high level of balance. Peppery, twiggy-flavored froth just cushions joints of carob, spice, palo cortado, hardened licorice and cola. This is very good beer."
"Now theres nothing like a warm stout on a warm and muggy night! This beer poured a very deep and clear mahogany brown color with ruby tints. Had a large creamy and clingy tan head. The aroma was one of bittersweet chocolate, caramel and coffee with a campfire smokiness there as well. Was surprised to see that this stout was low in bitterness and very very smooth. Nice clean finish which leaves a chocolate taste on the tongue. Dry finish and an overall delicious stout."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep black color with two fingers of head that die quickly. There is a small amount of lacing left on the glass. The smell is fairly strong with coffee and chocolate. The taste is a nice start of coffee, caramel, and toffee, followed by a small hint of hops. The body is a little light and watery. Not terribly bad though. The drinkability is just alright. A fair stout, but Old Rasputin is better."
"Certainly not an elite stout but definitely a very good one that should be tried....I'd buy this again....."
"This beer pours a dark color with a thick and steady tan head with quite a bit of lacing left on the glass. The aroma is not very strong, but there are hints of burned malts and possibly a hint of coffee - it has an interesting sweet character to the aroma as well. The flavor is a little spicy and reminiscent of coffee. The malt is also very noticeable. Very smooth with a little bit of sweetness in the aftertaste. I'm normally not a fan of this style, but I could have several of these without complaint."
"Looks like a solid stout with a nice head. Smells of Maxwell House Hazelnut Coffee. The taste backs up that nutty coffee aroma but adds a strong roasted kick to it as well. Quite good. Hops are in the background and never come forth. Nothing overpowering here but definitely a high class stout from a high class brewery."
"Didn't really pack the punch I like in a stout but not that bad overall. Thick head with good retention. Aroma not real powerful but had a significant roasted malt presence and perhaps subtle notes of coffee. Dry and bitter but not as full as I'd like. Was satisfying none the less with good roasty malt flavor. I enjoyed their Imperial much more."
"Overall: A very nice effort and a solid Stout. I bought the stores last bottle of this, but if I ever see it again, I will consider stocking up on a few more. Recommended!"
"Originally sampled on 25 January 2003. I am writing this review from my notes. This pours a very dark brown. The schnauzola has lots of coffee notes. This is an extremely drinklable stout. If you wanted to introduce someone to stouts, Old #38 would be a good choice. It's very smooth on the way down. Enjoyable by all."
"This dark black coffee beauty with a full beige head and lasting lace is a sight to behold. Full smoky malt with a sweet essence of camphor and molasses. Hoppy tea-like and citrusy grapefruit provide a bit of tang. A touch of coffee and dark chocolate round out the flavors along with an underlying light herbal taste and noticeable alcohol fuminess. Nice drinkable strong stout."
"Overall, a good representation of the style. My first NCBC stout; hope to try the Rasputin soon.."
"Pour is a nearly opaque black, large rocky tan head that leaves good lacing. Aroma is dark roastiness, smoky, ash, and strong espresso. Flavor follows the aroma, starting with some more of the smokiness coming out at the end. Thick and chewy on the palate."
"Mmm, Mmm, MmMm, MmmWhat a great stout this is. It pours a dark, almost black color with an ever so slight touch of red, topped off by a thick creamy tan head. The aromas were of dark roasted malt, chocolate and coffee. The taste is full of roasted malts and dark roasted coffee beans, with mild undertones of hops and chocolate, which leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth and creamy; a very easy drinking brew. This is a must have for any stout lover."
"The Old 38 poured a black color, with some hints of red in the light. A nice thick head dissipated to a smaller, thinner layer over time. The nice tight lacing on the glass rounded out the impressive appearance. I was also impressed by the nice roasted, caramel aroma, with a subtle hop scent. A caramel / coffee taste was followed by mild bitterness and hop bite. Great roasted characteristics. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy. Pretty full and heavy, and very appropriate for the style. I really had a hard time finding anything sub-par with this stout. Very solid all around. The Old 38 won't really shock or excite stout drinkers, but it's a great, consistent brew overall. Well done."
"The smell of coffee, roasted grains and slightly sweet grapes hints at an understated complexity. Coffee accents the roasty, sweet chocolate front. The middle is malty and chocolatey, full, with a little fruit and some milk. A very nice, dry, hoppy finish is complemented by bitter chocolate. This is a very nice dry stout: roasty, fruity, hoppy. Quite creamy with temperature."
"This stout pours a dark brown. Small, tan head, which dissapates quickly. The aroma is mainly of chocolate, with hints of coffee and roastiness. Roasted malty flavor is the most prevalent. Some bitterness in it also. Flavor is strong, but the body is a little thin. Overall this is pretty good, but I'll stick to their Old Rasputin."
"A very solid offering from an amazing brewery, the old no. 38 is a classic sweet stout that I am fortunate to have access to. This beer pours a very dark ruby amber tone that looks black almost opaque with a mohogany colored billowing two finger width head. Looks amazing, but it's nothing compared to the smell of this well done stout, with the dark fragrant roasts and strong coffee esque aroma just wonderful. The taste is also a great part of this beer very refined with hints of espresso and notes of dark chocolate the dark roasted barley fills this beer with slight burnt finish that is pleasant when matched with the other flavors going on. Well made with medium to heavy body and a full creamy mouthfeel to each sip makes this one a winner. I could drink this stout any day any time any place. Muy bueno!!!"
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black, color with a thick and creamy tan colored head that coats the sides of the glass with sheets of lace as it recedes. Nose is sweet malts and toffee with a touch of fresh coffee. Full in body with a creamy mouthfeel. Taste is roasted malts and grains up front quickly followed by notes of bitter burnt coffee leaving a very dry finish. The taste and mouthfeel improve as the beer warms a bit."
"Poured with a 2 inch head. Deep brown in color. Taste is very much of coffee not too bitter. The mouthfeel is a bit disappointing, being a bit on the watery side. Sweet taste. Nothing outstanding or objectionable.Slight bitter aftertaste starts to settle in after a while. This one doesn't really stand in North Coast's lineup."
"Perfect for effortless drinking, and I'd take one over a Guinness any day."
"Black body with ruby highlights. Big lumpy beige head rises over the edge of the glass. Excellent lacing. Nose features coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, floral hops, and some general earthiness. Taste is lead b the roasted malts, then chocolate and coffee and a long lingering hop twang with some herbal qualities. Mouthfeel is slightly on the thin side, could use a little more ""chewiness"". Easy, pleasant enjoyable drinking. Remember, not all stouts are imperials. Not up to neighbor Sierra Nevada Stout, but a fine example of a straight forward American stout."
"Pours very well dark with ruby tinges,does have nice caramel color head.Nice roasty smell,with chocolate and coffee in it as well,what a good stout should smell like.I do agree with a few others in saying it is a little thin and weak for the style,taste to me doesnt match the smell.A little bitterness in the ending salvaged this one for me.Nothing great but not horrible either."
"The beer pours a deep garnet color, the head is initially modest, frothy in texture, but erodes quite quickly leaving a fair to middling sheet of lace to conceal the glass. Light hints of roasted grains and coffee, malt and a pleasant enough nose I guess, malt and lightly sweet at the start, the top disappointing in its feel, a bit light for this stout lover. Finish is moderately carbonated, the hops adequate, the aftertaste dry. Maybe I should classify it as a beginners stout, certainly most stouts have nothing to fear from this rather Wimpy stout, not bad mind you, just a tad to light for me."
"This beer poured into the glass a chestnut brown/light red color that was very clear. The head was foamy and rich tan. The lace was full and lasting to the bottom of the glass. The aroma was of malt, cocoa, coffee, some sweet overtones as well. The tastes were of bitter chocolate, coffee, malt, kind of watery in the middle of the swallow, some slate near the end as it ended dry. As this beer warmed, it seemed to become more bitter and the chocolate also seemed to become more pronounced. To be honest while rinking this I had to check back to the bottle and reassure that this was a STOUT. To me it seemed more like a PORTER. Over all, not a bad beer, not my first choice when I think of Stouts."
"Black and opaque with a thin tan head. Has a nice roasted malt aroama... chocolate and a touch of coffee with just a touch of herbal hops. Flavor is much the same as the smell... roasted malt with some slight spice and, a touch of sweetness. Very smooth and creamy. A very drinkable stout."
"The taste is very sweet. Good amounts of caramel and toffee, backed by the typical stout chocolate and coffee. Finishes with a fair dose of bitterness. Very good, smooth and tasty. I want more!"
"Another beer that falls into the ""it made me happy"" category. Fantastic aroma - like Hershey's chocolate syrup in milk. Crammed full of mocha-coffee notes and roasted malt, but not burned or overdone. Hops is there enough to balance the chocolate/coffee sweet elements - very drinkable. Just dry enough at the finish to invite another quaff."
"Drinkability: Good...I wasn't impressed with the first couple sips, but it's improving as it warms. This could be a session beer on a cold, winter night."
"Why is this a specialty stout?"
"Deep mahogony brown color, some light does pass through the glass, revealing that this beer is not black.  Nice half inch or so tan-colored head with modest carbonation, quite a bit of sticky, irregular lace.  Aroma of coffee, dark chocolate, alcohol, and a slight fruitiness.  Taste opens with dark (actually burnt) malts, and earthy flavors.  Towards the middle of the taste, some sweet, berry flavors appear, these carry to the end of the taste.  Finish is dry with bitter chocolate and coffee notes.  A touch thin in body, but otherwise excellent."
"oh yum!   very dark brown color...a big, tan, rocky head that leaves a great deal of lace.  aroma of dark roasted barley, lots of sweet chocolate with a hint of alcohol.   tastes great;  the chocolate flavors are straightforward, with an underlying faint hop presence. medium bodied with a mouthfeel that starts creamy smooth,  becomes quite bitter then ends very dry.   a lingering aftertaste of burnt malt and a definite warming sensation leaves me quite satisfied.  a very impressive stout.  highly recommended."
"Pours a very dark brown color (nearly black) and has a thick medium tan head.  The smell of roasted mocha coffee and malts get the mouth watering.  First taste of each swallow reveals an odd twang, but then fades to a more pleasant chocolate and roasted malt flavor.  It has a rather thin mouthfeel and light clean finish for a stout.  It could stand a little tweaking to get rid of the strange twang, but maybe its on purpose.  Not bad, and I can struggle through the trenches to get through the twang ;-) since I have a few more of these.  Cheers!"
"My final verdict is that for a stout it's only run of the mill. It has some high points, like the fairly complex and lush flavor and aroma, and while a little too transparent for what I like in a stout, the resulting color is quite attractive.  But it also has low points, like the thin mouthfeel and wimpy head. Despite all this, for pure easy-drinking pleasure, it's not a bad beer."
"Pours dark and rather clear with somewhat sparse, fleeting head and light carbonation.  Copper-red tones on the edges.  Smell is pleasant enough but quite muted.  Taste is not as smooth as some stouts, but the crispness is interesting.  Still has the dark toastiness one expects.  Pretty good mouthfeel and reasonable drinkability."
"A very nice stout by one helluva brewery.  It is not as think and viscous as I would have liked, but this stout has all of the deep and dark roasty and sweet flavors and aromas many look for in their brews.  Well worth the try.  Prost!"
"Medium-full bodied, and pretty drinkable, though I found the roasty character to be just a bit overdone."
"North Coast produces a quality stout with Old #38. The almost opaque pour features a tan head that survives and laces well. The aroma is of roasted malt and lots of hops in the typical west coast style. This beer tastes of the hops, roasted malt and some java-like notes. Mouthfeel is fairly carbonated and appropriate for the style. It's easy to have more than one of these fine stouts."
"Very dark brown with reddish highlights and a full foamy tan head that holds well and leaves very good spider-web lace throughout the entire glass. The aroma is of sweet caramel malt, cocoa, and some roastiness. The body is medium-light and the mouthfeel is nicely creamy. The flavor starts with cocoa and toffee up front, becoming very chocolatey with a slight acidity as it crosses the palate, ending with swirling flavors of nuttiness, cocoa and biscuit, and eventually finishing with drying bitterness and a residual bittersweet chocolate note."
"Deep burgundy brown in color with a chunky, durable head.  The head left a nice lattice on my glass.  Aromas of bitter chocolate, cocoa and dry leaves.  The nose is almost rummy, with alcohol presenting itself along with a burnt bread/biscuit flavor.  Body of the beer is thin and bone dry, with big espresso and nutty/smoky flavors.  Finishes long and bitter, with a dark chocolate aftertaste.  A super dry stout."
"Pillowy head that takes time to form -- settles at 1/4 inch.  Mostly opaque brown/black.  Deep sweetened coffee aromas.  Nice bitterness right up front, deep and java-like, a touch of strawberry, and avoiding all but the slightest chocolate tones.  A tad acidic and slightly thin.  This brew should definitely meet the needs of dry Stout cravers.  After letting it warm, it struck me right."
"Nice tan head, good lacing.  Roasted coffee, cocoa aromas.  Slight nuttiness mixed in to a predominantly coffee flavored brew.  Lasting dry, bitter finish.  I really enjoyed this full-bodied, flavorful stout."
"Dark brown to black color depending on the light. Tan head was fluffy and full then evaporated quickly. Initial smells were bitter, roasted coffee, some thick chocolate smells. Taste was much the same, lots of roasted bitterness, sharp bitter bite to finish. I think I had it too cold to start, as it warms more subtle chocolate malt tastes emerge. I thought it was a dry stout to start, but the flavors erupt as the beer settles. Medium bodied, tasty, a good stout. Lots of flavors there, just be patient."
"This is one of my favorite stouts. With a hint of chocolate and a little of the malty side. There was no bitter after taste. It will be a beer that I will stock up on and keep in storage!"
"This is a solid selection.  The nose is full of both malt and hops.  The head is quite creamy at first but doesn't last.  The carbonation seems to be a little overwhelming but settles down toward the middle.  The malt is stronger at first  but hops become more apparent as you go.  This beer has quite a nice lacing that bubbles quite a bit.  Hints of carmel finish off this beer.  Definitely worth having on tap as well.  Good job North Coast!"
"Black brown color with long lasting head and solid sheets of lace. nice subtle roasted flavor. A very smooth utterly drinkable dry stout. One of my favorite stouts that dosen't bear the name of Young's.  Another fine brew from the folks at North Coast."
"This beer poured out a nice dark color.  Formed a medium tan head with some lace as it subsided.  The aroma had definate malt and coffee.smell.  Coffee and chocolate flavor to it.  Slightly burnt aspect to it.  Seemed to be one of the lighter bodied stouts.  A good beer, worth a try, but not one of the best stouts out there."
"I'm very impressed with this one.  Pours a dark brown with a tan sticky head that lasts pretty well.  Smell is of strong roasted malt with coffee and chocolate mixed in.  Strong coffe prescence on the tongue and slightly smoky as well.  The bitterness from the roasted barley is complimented nice by the chocolate undertones of the beer.  Creamy mouthfeel and very drinkable.  Another great brew from what is becoming one of my favorite breweries."
"Notes: Full bodied dry stout ... roasted flavours are done to a T, good drinking for stout lovers."
"Definite roast malt flavor and hops evident. I thought this was a slightly above average stout that is definitely worth a shot!"
"Starts sweet.  Burnt malty notes resonate on the nose and palate. Very rich, silky smooth and creamy.  Finishes slightly dry and bitter.  Another exceptional beer by North Coast."
