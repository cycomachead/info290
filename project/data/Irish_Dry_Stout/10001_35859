3.5,-1.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall â€“ Very drinkable but in no way exciting or memorable. It could use a touch more sweetness but I guess that might take away from it's sessionability. Worth a try, but i wouldn't revisit this one again.","spinrsx","Aug 02, 2011"
3.37,-5.1,3.5,4,3.5,3,2.5,"Final Thoughts: Well I'm glad this beer taught me about Black Currants in beer, but I dunno. I was impressed at the start of the beer, but it gradually became more and more tame as the carbonation panned out. It's good, but the problem I have is if I wanted a Stout, this wouldn't be what I was looking for. This is more like a milder Porter, so keep that in mind if you pick it up.","TheHammer","Apr 04, 2011"
3.58,0.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"O - a very drinkable stout which is in line with all of the brews I have had from Hockley - good but not great - definitely worth another taste some time soon.","Stocean1","Feb 27, 2011"

3.67,3.4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Drinkability here is definitely high, especially at this ABV (4.2% on this can). I could easily drink a bunch of these in a short period of time. Not sure that I would buy it again but it would be a good choice if you're looking for an incredibly sessionable stout in Ontario.","eat","Jan 27, 2011"
3.48,-2,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"d-not bad...I will drink the other one I have.","Mit","Jan 17, 2011"
3.05,-14.1,4,4,2.5,2.5,3,"It seems like Hockley Valley sacrificed the taste and feel of this stout that nailed the appearance and smell to make it incredibly easy to put down. I look at Hockley Valley as a mediocre brewery, and this is far from their best offering. I'll take a Guinness over this.","ludachris","Oct 01, 2010"
3.66,3.1,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"D: It seemed a lot more watery then the last time I had this one but it has a better feel and taste then other dry stouts (Guinness). Don't pursue this one if you're looking for bold flavors but it's still not too bad. Also it has a 4.2 Abv not 4.6","marty21","Aug 30, 2010"
3.94,11,3.5,4.5,4,2.5,4,"D - High. Nice low ABV but really nice flavours to keep a night going.","tbeckett","Mar 31, 2010"
3.5,-1.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a dark brown with thin tan head. Head dissipates with a little bit of lacing. Has a very nutty smell, with some mild coffee and chocolate roast. Taste has mild bitterness. Body is a bit thin. I used to enjoy this stout a lot more. I don't know if my tastes have changed with trying more beers or if the beer has. Still a nice enough stout for Ontario.","kwjd","Mar 17, 2010"
4.15,16.9,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"The only issue I would have with this nice coffee hinted stout would be a better head formation and retention. Dare I say, larger cans with a nitro ball? I would be glad to have this on a regular basis and I hope the Newfoundland Liquor Board keeps bringing this beer in.","sailorjacko","Mar 15, 2010"
3.12,-12.1,3,3.5,3,2,3.5,"Overall, an okay stout. Low ABV and goes down easy, could throw a few back no problem.","MattyV","Jan 01, 2010"
3.27,-7.9,3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Per the label "pours like liquid midnight." Midnight must be darker down here, because the pour was more dark-brown than black. Minimal head on hard pour. Even for a style that is not assertive and focuses on being easy to drink, this fell on the timid side of the scale. A tad watery and sour, with pleasant but insufficient roasted malt flavor.","Brent","Beers"
3.97,11.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"I was impressed by this stout as it was full bodied with good roasty bitterness yet smooth on the finish. Add to it a low ABV and put it in a can and I think it hit the mark. I enjoyed the chocolate nose coupled with burnt malt and found the midbody well balanced. Too bad its not available in BC.","canucklehead","0"
3.24,-8.7,3,4,3,3,3,"A passable local stout, probably one of the better locals available on regular LCBO rotation. Still, there's a few serious flaws with it - the metallic after taste and the thinness - that need addressing.","JohnnyBarman","Oct 31, 2009"
2.98,-16.1,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,"Edit: Perhaps slightly better in the can, carbonation seems more in check though perhaps still slightly on the heavy side. Less smoke, comes through a little more as roast. More bland than wrong in this format. Nothing to get excited about.","ritzkiss","Oct 14, 2009"
2.46,-30.7,4,3,2,3,2,"D: Nah, not worth seeking out.","tpd975","Sep 09, 2009"
3.77,6.2,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Initially pours a jet black body with a generous tan head; however, both the head and lacing quickly subside as the beer warms. Results in a boring, black coffee look about midway through. Smell & Taste: roasted and chocolate malts, a little bit of coffee, dried grains, and almonds. Lightly charred aftertaste. Very flavourful, I was pleasantly surprised. Mouthfeel: smooth and light-bodied, a bit on the watery side. Finish is only somewhat dry. Overall: a tasty stout and above average for the style, but the brewer could improve the head retention, lacing, and mouthfeel for a truly impressive beer. Worth a try.","cratez","Aug 24, 2009"
3.68,3.7,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"A good beer overall. I like it!","ZorPrime","Aug 16, 2009"
3.91,10.1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"I like this beer - the up-front creaminess for the dry, low-alcohol session beer standard is very enjoyable.","biboergosum","Jul 29, 2009"
3.57,0.6,3,3.5,4,2.5,3.5,"Fairly light bodied with low carbonation. It's easy to throw back, but it feels a little thin. A little more body would be nice.","mintjellie","Jul 24, 2009"
3.63,2.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Swing top bottle from the LCBO- Pours deep , deep brown, almost black, with some transparency. The head is frothy, beige, and keep for a while. The aromas are mild roasted coffee beans, charred wood, vanilla, nice malt and hops as well. Tastes of roasted malts, some dark chocolate, vanilla extract, coffee beans. FInishes creamy, and just a touch waterier than I prefer. Good beer from this brewer.","mrmanning","Jul 17, 2009"
3.72,4.8,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Nicely done and a very solid drinkable Irish stout, without really wowing in any one department.","bobsy","Jun 16, 2009"
3.89,9.6,3,4,4,3.5,4,"Not bad - I'd probably get it again for something different, though it's not my favorite stout.","seand","Apr 30, 2009"
3.48,-2,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Aroma of coffee and chocolate, neither is overly strong. Taste has a lot of coffee and some chocolate malt. Detected some nuttiness as well. Not much sweetness, keeping to the dry stout characteristics. Kind of a thin mouthfeel, not really watered-down, just lightered than expected. Overall this is a good beer, and I would get it again (if I could). Thanks bobsy!","BigBry","Apr 02, 2009"
3.46,-2.5,4,3,3.5,3,4,"Thin bodied and it's almost watery and...wet. Yeah. Wet. It's drinkable enough but probably not something I'd reach for too often if I was in the mood for a stout.","MeisterBurger","Feb 01, 2009"
3.92,10.4,4,4.5,4,2,4,"My biggest complaints are the thin mouthfeel and the sweetness is a little too much, but overall this is a good beer, and I'll buy it again","EatsTacos","Jan 08, 2009"
3.75,5.6,3.5,3.5,4,3,4,"Very drinkable, though - part of that may be the low ABV, but it's also just a pleasant, malty, smooth beer to drink down.","atomicbolt","Jan 06, 2009"
3.24,-8.7,4,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Fairly thin, a little bit creamy, but right on par with an irish stout. More wet then dry however, which should be noted. Coffee flavors are elicited, and oats are present as well which alter this beer from its a style in a different way. Some slight maple syrup sweetness, which is something I find characteristic of many Canadian beers. This is an interesting beer. A thank you goes out to the BA that threw this one in as an extra.","CoolJosh","Jan 06, 2009"
2.91,-18,2.5,4,2.5,2,3,"The aroma was good. Nice coffee notes and some slight chocolate. Flavor was a bit lacking but not a bad beer. I am not sure how "stout" it is. The mouthfeel was thin, watery, not what I am looking for in a stout. Overall, a drinkable beer but for some reason, I feel as if all beers made in Canada are pilseners with a little specialty malt. Good for a change if you are in teh Great White North.","brewjones","Dec 27, 2008"
3.7,4.2,3,3,4,4,4,"OVERALL: A very good dry stout for sure. The appearance is nothing to write home about, but the rest of the experience is right up there with the best. Very enjoyable, very drinkable, and could easily be a session stout. This would definitely be a staple if I lived in the area.","Jeffo","Nov 16, 2008"
3.4,-4.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Very dark brown with faint chestnut highlights and a reddish hue, a thick rocky tan cap appeared after the pour. Fair head retention with some clumpy lacing. Mild aroma, some dry roast, caramel and toffee, light coffee, and a hint of hops. Light bitterness, a bit of roast, light grassy and herbal character, plus more caramel sweetness. Light to medium bodied and fairly smooth, mild dry astringency from the dark grains. Very low carbonation that made it feel sort of lifeless. Okay overall. The only problem I had with it was the too low carbonation.","DrJay","Sep 28, 2008"
3.62,2,3,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Thanks to NASH for the can!","markaberrant","Aug 17, 2008"

3.54,-0.3,3,4,3.5,3,3.5,"473mL can purchased from LCBO in Toronto. Initially pours black with a fizzy head and bubbles on the side. Looks like Coke. The head and bubbles fade quickly, leacing a rather flat looking beverage. Nice coffee aroma. Flavour is decent. Starts off with some coffee notes with the malts, though the flavour drops off somewhat midway. The aftertaste is left a bit thin. This beer (on tap) won a blind stout and porter tasting at C'est What a few months ago - which was a bit of a surprise.","sstackho","Jun 02, 2008"
3.35,-5.6,4.5,2,4,3,3.5,"I tried this beer on May 28, 2008 after purchasing from one of my local LCBO outlets. The beer poured a molasses black colour with a light brown head that quicklt disappeared. The aroma was rather weak with some roasted malt hints, and some sour smells. The mouthfeel was thin to medium bodied, with medium carbonation. The flavour was roasted malt with coffee and chocolate tones.","cyrenaica","May 24, 2008"
3.97,11.8,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"drinkability: too heavy to be a session beer, but nice.","aychbomb","Apr 26, 2008"
3.72,4.8,3,3.5,4,3,4,"Pours like a stout, dark with a relatively large tan head that disappears quickly. There was minimal lacing on the glass. Smell is of chocolate and coffee with some alcoholic undertones. the taste is quite good, each sip is a new experience, some are quite bitter, others have some sweetness to them. This beer is pretty carbonated for a stout, but its not overbearing. Very drinkable. I like it.","dirtyoldtown53","Beers"

3.42,-3.7,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"All in all, a decent offering, but it won't replace the Hockley Dark for me when I visit Ontario.","JustinBathurst","Mar 06, 2008"
3.7,4.2,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Can: Poured a deep black color ale with a small dirty brown foamy head with minimal retention and no lacing. Aroma of black chocolate with light dry bitter coffee notes. Taste is also dominated by some light bitter coffee notes with some nice black chocolate notes. Body is a bit thin for the style with some medium carbonation. This beer was enjoyable and refreshing and well done for the style.","Phyl21ca","Mar 06, 2008"

3.05,-14.1,3,3,3,3.5,3,"not a great stout. Not a bad stout. Just a stout. I don't know what to say about this one. It poured an extremely thin head; almost non-existent. the smell didn't excite me in the way a decent stout can. The taste was not bad but I was hoping to be granted a treat. It's a bit to close to bacon water and stale coffee. Even at that it's still better than a crappy rice brewed 'lager'.","shamus","Jan 16, 2008"
3.57,0.6,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Tastes of roasted malts, coffee and chocolate. A good drinkable stout but it falls short in a few places.","irishkyle21","Dec 27, 2007"

3.58,0.8,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Large one litre swing top bottle poured black, quite dark. Tan one finger head with some lacing ...I thought this looks like a stout alright. A bit flat unfortunately. Smell was of toast, slightly burnt, toffee. Taste had measures of bitterness, roasted malt, not bad at all; hint of chocolate, nice finish and a malty aftertaste. This is by no means a great stout but it is quite drinkable and well received in Ontario where locally brewed stouts are not always easy to find, thanks Hockley Valley.","ThatWineGuy","Jul 25, 2007"
3.15,-11.3,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"like drinking coffee that got cold. Not horrible coffee, but just another thin and dry stout.Fizzy carbonation that helps to generate an acidic undercurrent. Two cups are OK but a litre flip top? Not complex, a passable beer. A bit of roast barley, a dark brown colour and a bubbling transparent amount of head.","Sammy","Jun 06, 2007"
4.06,14.4,5,4,4,4,4,"D - Very nice, not very heavy but full flavoured.","allergictomacros","May 25, 2007"
3.98,12.1,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Aroma is dry, plant-like, with a little coffee and tobacco. Restrained, but pleasant and more complex than, say, Guinness. Flavour is excellent -- roasted malts, moderate dry coffee, little bit of chocolate, surprising amount of smokiness. Nice dry finish with some lingering sweetness. For me, this falls somewhat short of my favourites (i.e. Shakespeare Stout) but still one of the best I've had in a long time.","crwills","May 21, 2007"

3.18,-10.4,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Grains, some coffee and chocolate, but not as full-bodied, flavourful, and fulsome as you might expect a stout to properly be. An underachiever. Nonetheless, still competently made and worth a try at least.","TerryW","Apr 27, 2007"

Smell is light, some roasty malt, fruits, bit of yeast, chocolate, not too much though. Taste is very light, some fruits, light roasty coffee bitterness in the finish, weak though. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low carbonation, smooth drink. Lacking in aroma and flavour.","Viggo","Beers"
