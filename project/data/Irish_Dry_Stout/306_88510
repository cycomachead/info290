I'm not sure I would buy it again as there's lots of other stouts out there that do the job better than this. But for a macro brewery to put out something like this is fairly impressive. Good job, Coors.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Sep 13, 2014"

The mild roast and mostly dry body are there but it seems to flatten as it warms with only light bitter flavor lasting. Overall I consider this pretty decent for the style it represents and it is drinkable with good flavor and aroma.

Color was a deep, dark-brown, allowing zero light penetration. Nose had a smoky, chocolaty quality. Mouthfeel was medium, but the taste was tending towards sweet chocolate, which would be inappropriate for the style. I have a Sweet/Milk Stout on-deck and this was too close to that style for comfort. Finish remained sweet, very chocolaty, which was not bad in and of itself, but not what I want in an Irish DRY Stout.","woodychandler","May 26, 2013"

It has a thin, earthy, black malt scent that's bone dry and bitter and so good. The taste is decent as well. Again, it has a bone dry, black malt flavor. It's pretty one sided and lacks any real complexity, but it drinks fantastic. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a very accessible Irish stout that great for those who want something a little lighter than Guiness.","WesWes","Beers"

Additionally, it's over-carbonated which only further distracts from the malt.","jhenry0302","Apr 30, 2013"

This beer had pretty good drinkability, it was smooth, the flavor did an ok job at holding my attention and it isn't too filling, I could see drinking a few of these when in the mood especially on St. Patty's day. What I liked the most about this beer was the how balanced the taste was, it worked nicely with this beer and that aspect was pretty true to style, the appearance was also pretty nice. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was just a little on the light side and I could have gone without the higher and slightly prickly carbonation. I don't think I would keep this stocked in my fridge, but I could see buying a few of these at the bar when the selection isn't that great, I think I would enjoy this a little more then a Guinness and I would recommend this to someone as a good starter Stout. All in all I didn't think this beer was that bad at all, I didn't have the highest expectations for this beer, but it did end up impressing me a little. If this show's up at most bars that mainly serve BMC, I would be pretty happy with that, good job guys, nice to Killian's venturing out from the typical Irish Red Ale.","StoutHunter","Jan 20, 2013"
