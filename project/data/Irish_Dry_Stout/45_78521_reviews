"This is one of my favorite ""everyday beers"".  Flavorful enough to keep me interested all the way through, yet not so intense that it bogs you down after one or two.  Excellent."
""
""
""
""
"Taste is empty and thin.  Yes - thin is the theme.  I know that Irish Dry's are thinner than their American counterparts, but I would like more body.  Best flavor is it the aftertaste with light coffee that is reminiscent of a frappe.  Overall not a bad beer by any means and stays true to the style, but does not stand out enough to warrant a repeat purchase."

"Too thin and astringent for a stout"

"I'm a big fan of this american take on a classic style. It's packed with flavor and complexity you'd expect from a bigger stout, but is still light and easy drinking. Love love love. If I can find bottles of this it would be my go to easy drinking dark beer."
"I had this on tap. It has a roast nose - coffee and chocolate with some sweet notes. It pours dense black. It has the dry stout roast and burnt barley bitterness but it has traces of sweetness in the background that are separate from the roast. the body is medium full and the carbonation medium."
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad go at an Irish stout. A little more identity to the flavor profile, rather than being everything and nothing at the same time, and this could be fantastic. As it stands, it's solid."
""
"Like a Guinness but even tastier!!"
"      I'll give Brooklyn Dry Irish Stout - Brooklyn Brewery a 4.25 This is an easy-going stout that you can knock back a couple of and not feel sleepy. Nicely done by these guys."
""
"Wish It Had A Little More Body. Good!"
""
""
"O: OK, but not very interesting;"
""
"Not as creamy as Guinness, and does not have as strong of the roasted barley taste. A bit more watery. Light for a stout. Definitely decent but not the ultimate"
""
"Poured dark caramel brown.  Persistent tan head that leaves a ring and wet slippery lace.  Pours with a thickness.  Nose is roasty grain.  Smooth sweetness from caramel under that.   Earthy, coffee and a malty sweetness.  Taste is good. Sharp and full of flavor.  Roasty gran with a slight hop bitterness to give it edge.  Drinks dry and very crisp.  Lightly sweet.  A smooth and quick drink that finishes dry and with plenty of maltiness to linger.  Textbook dry stout with a rich and full mouthfeel.  Smooth and creamy too."

"So why would I want an Irish style stout brewed in the US? To celebrate Saint Patricks Day, of course! Although Guinness is seen as quintessentially Irish, it's actually an English company that persecuted the Irish. Arthur was a committed unionist and opponent of Irish nationalism; and his decedents financially supported the Ulster Volunteer Force and allegedly lent men and equipment to the British Army during the Easter Rising of 1916. So this year I'll have a Murphy's, a Beamish, or a Brooklyn... but I won't support Guinness."
"Dry tasteless beer.  This is not what a Irish stout should taste like.  Maybe the line is bad but this is crap."
""
""
""
"This beer isn't bad its terrible! Shame on Brooklyn brewery for coming out with this beer when their chocolate stout is one of my favorites!!"
""
""
""
"It's not a bad stout."

"Good carbonation, lotsa flavor. The right amount of char"

"A decent drinking beer...."
""
"355 ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pitch brownish-black with a moderate amount of tan head that settles out quickly into a thin topcoat. Aroma is rather subdued but pleasant, milk chocolate is the main vibe I am getting along with coffee and hints of caramel and charcoal. Slight earthy Goldings hop. Palate flips the script and is predominantly coffee, more earthy and dry than the nose suggests. Hints of red berry. Drinkable (read: thin bodied), rather fizzy, and slightly citric. The sour note is likely an attempt to emulate the vaunted Guinness soured flavor and frankly manages to trump the original, although this is perhaps better described as an alkaline ""soda"" effect here. Not bad but finishes strangely empty and I think the intended target was overshot with regards to sessionability. Looking for the flavors to pop more."
"You can never go wrong with a brew from The Brooklyn Brewery. Nose is a nice roast hops with an airy scent of coffee. Pours a rich dark brown almost black, like liquid dark chocolate. Head has small bubbles, rich in appearance that hugs the inner glass. Second nose now detects the chocolate, but barely. First taste is light: More coffee than chocolate, although it's there (can't really call it mocha: For the two are distinct on their own). I don't think they roasted the hops as long as one might usually to produce a porter, doppelbock or especially, a stout. Surprisingly crisp at the finish. One disappointment of the Dry Irish Stout is that with all these interactions, I found it somewhat one dimensional. The flavours and the ingredients didn't seem to be layered together as well I thought it ought to be. Still, this is a very good, yet disarmingly easy-going brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottom line: this is a perfect example of how flavor is not all it takes for a brew these days. There is a substantial flavor but it's seems one dimensional especially without a robust texture to match."

"Subdued nose, primarily malt and caramel. Taste is about the same, gentle malt and caramel, a touch of charcoal. Mouth feel is tart to begin, finishes slightly drying. Stout light is what this is I guess. Drinkable and inoffensive, but no real excitement in the glass."

"Very dark pour but with a very light head. The smell was mostly of sweet malt and a little bit of floral notes on the end. The taste was a lot of heavy caramel flavor with the floral hops cutting the end for a clean refreshing finish. The biggest problem I had with the beer is that it was very thin for a stout. Overall I thought it was an interesting take on stouts and thought it was worth the try."
""
""
"Overall: I am a big fan of Irish stouts. This is a great American, non-nitro take on the style. Relatively straightforward but still very rewarding."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I really hope this is a bad bottle because very little about this beer reminds me of some of the better Irish dry stouts on the market. I tend to be a fan of Brooklyn Brewery, but some of their recent products concern me. This one is a real bummer, doing little to assuage my fears that the quality of the brewery's output has been slipping over the past couple of years."
""

""
""
""
""

""

""
""
"O: A fine example of the style. It's drinkable yet a bit more substantial than other dry stouts. After I veg on a whole bottle of it, my skepticism was confirmed: it's not THAT dry, and doesn't really have the bold flavor of a regular stout. Still, a decent beer that's worth a try."

"Pours a solid dark brown/black color with a decent sized bubbly tan head that slowly dissipates to a cap on top. Aromas of bitter coffee with a hint of chocolate and a touch of earth and dark fruit. The flavor is bitter roast and light chocolate with a hint of acrid earth. Light to medium body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a slick sharp mouthfeel. Nice dry stout, a little bit sweeter than the standard Guinness, but a nice easy drinker."
"Bottle: Poured a dark color stout with a large brown foamy head with very limited retention. Aroma of light dry roasted malt is not as powerful as I had expected. Taste is reminiscent of dry roasted malt with light Coke notes. Body is thin and carbonation is way too strong for style and resemble more of a cola than a beer. Drainpour."
"Final Grade: 3.58, a B grade. While it's not the most interesting stout I've ever tried, Brooklyn's Dry Irish Stout is still a solid example of this highly sessionable style. The flavour profile should be quite agreeable to most palates, although the thin body and weak aftertaste prevents this from being a truly outstanding stout. A good introduction to the style for anyone curious, and something that I would consider picking up again. It's certainly better than Guinness, although it's probably not as pretty."
""
"O - This is how I remember stouts from my youth. Not particularly ""dry"" but certainly not ""sweet"" either. I was surprised at the low alcohol content considering the taste. This would be a good session beer for sure."
""
"Fairly disappointing and definitely the worst Brooklyn Brewery offering that I've tried to date. Started okay but went downhill from their with the taste in particular failing to impress. I felt this one was more of a gimmick from the brewery and not really up to the standard of the previous Brooklyn beers."
"Overall - Very tasty brew with a great feel, thirst-quenching and flavorful yet light enough that I wouldn't be restricted to one or two of these, which usually i am on darker beers."
""
""
"Poured out a deep clear brown with about 1/2 finger of tan head. There is minimal retention but a smattering of lacing. The aroma is dark roasted malt with a nice hint of earthy hops. The taste follows closely with the aroma with the hops coming in on the finish. The mouthfeel is to style, with a thinner quality. Overall, this is a well-executed Irish stout."
""
"Pours out a dark brown/ruby (almost black) body with a thin tan head. Smells very malty: toasty and roasty. Hops are a faint whisper of an aroma. Flavor is very light, with subtle malt sweetness and a roasted backbone. Finishes very dry. Mouthfeel is light bodied. Carbonation could be a touch smoother. I always look forward to this release. A great session stout."
""
""
""
"Still thinking about all the carbonation."
"O-well it tastes better than bottled Guinness does most of the time in the US (this coming from a Guinness fan, but lets be honest the quality has plummeted recently). Seems like a pretty standard Irish Dry Stout. Low ABV. Didn't feel like it weighed a ton, so even though I'm satisfied with one, a few could be had in a night."
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Not a ""wow"" stout, but very drinkable and tasty enough to reach for another without qualm. I think it is overcarbonated for style, but otherwise a good enough beer. Went well with corned beef and colcannon."
"Indeed, I don't see how Brooklyn Dry Irish Stout has any less mainstream appeal than, say, their Lager or Summer Ale; it's every bit as approachable and mild-mannered. The dark appearance may intimidate some cowards out there, but those who muster the courage to get over their irrational fear will surely learned that there's nothing to be afraid of."

"Overall - Reminds me a bit of the Guinness lager. A very drinkable stout that has some lager like qualities to it. Good but forgettable."
""
"Great example pf a dry irish stout, smells of roast malts and slight coffee and smoke, taste compliments the aroma almost spot on, body is medium light, very drinkable!!"

""
""

"A really nice session stout actually. Pretty bold on the roasty flavor on the back end but pretty brisk as well. Some sweeter grains up front followed by a huge explosion of roasted grains, coffee flavor, bitter black chocolate. The beer delivers with a nice super dry yet balanced finish and a lingering roastiness. Not bitter, but balanced very nicely. Medium bodied, burnt toast ends and toasted hearty breads. Great flavor and amazing drinkability."

"It took me three bottles on different dates before writing this review. I wasn't very fond of dry Irish stouts but have now taken a liking to them after given this beer and others several chances. Great sessionable stout!"
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a good example of an Irish Dry Stout, but maybe a little pedestrian compared to other stouts that I’ve had. I enjoyed it, and if offered, will enjoy it again, but I probably won’t go out of my way to look for it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer just did not do it for me, I didn't find it lived up to what I expected from Brooklyn and perhaps I had too high expectations. I am hoping that my next Brooklyn beer is redeeming."
""
""
""
"Beer is light in body, with carbonation of low to medium-low intensity, resulting in a mouthfeel that is light, though not fizzy, but rather watery, not quite right for the style. Closes fairly dry, with little stickiness remaining on the palate and/or lips."
""
""
"12 ounce bottle, stamp says BB Jun 2013. Oh well, it's just a couple months after that now. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. The brew smells like roasted malt, coffee, and a bit of bittersweet chocolate. It tastes mostly like roasted malt and coffee, along with some bittersweet chocolate, burnt/charred malt, and a bit of cream. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's smooth and easy to drink with moderate carbonation. Picked this up as part of a mix 6-pack at Kroger earlier today, I think I might have to try this fresher when it comes out again next year. I liked it, definitely worth a try."

""

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of roasted malts, coffee, some smokiness. Taste is smooth, coffee, lots of roasted malts, very sessionable and easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."
"Feel is good, carbonation is on point and finishes dry with a touch of creaminess."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good, I'd still order this over Guinness Draught as that beer has certainly not been up to par with me for a while."
""
""
""
""
"O - Not bad, a decent take on a dry stout."
""
""
""
""
"O: No apparent flaws, but rather mild flavor and not very complex or interesting either."
"This is consistent with all the beers I've had from this brewery. Hitting classic styles in a even-handed and highly drinkable manner. It was consistent with my expectations and a pleasure to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is not the type of beer that I drink often, but it's a surprisingly delicious brew from a brewery that never quite gets it right (to me.) This will have to be added to my 'tasty, sub-6%- cheap' beer rotation along with Yuengling's Bock and Longtrail Ale. Too bad I don't see it around that often."

"The beer pours a pitch black color with a 1/2"" tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a earthy, bitter, black malt scent along with a hint of roasted character and Irish stout yeast. It's quite dry, just the way it should be. The taste is good as well. It has a bone dry, black malt flavor that goes down quick and easy and finishes bitter and earthy. It's true to style and highly quaffable. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tasty seasonal beer. It's so smooth and sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's tasty but if I were doing the whole thing blind I would assume it was a brown ale. I'm still happy to drink it tho."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: 3.5 - below average for style; I drank it alongside with my dry Irish stout homebrew; I really like Brooklyn's stouts, especially their BCS (see my review for glorious praise) and Black Ops, but this one was really underwhelming due to the lack of dry coffee and chocolate notes as advertised; I wouldn't purchase this again, but, if offered, I certainly wouldn't turn it down either"
""
""
"It blossoms as it warms and gives a good bouquet with a coffee like profile. A bit of dough. Some sweet molasses notes flow in here and there. Taste is like the name. Dark roasted grain front with a lots of coffee and charred grains. Sweetness is of the burnt variety and fleeting at that. Finish is short and earthy with lots of dark grains and a touch of ale yeast. Very smooth drinking. Feel is crisp and light with well proportioned carbonation that lends itself to sessioning. A very good representation of the style that is an excellent session beer with a full flavor."
""
""
"A tasty enough Irish dry stout, with a fair bit more sweetness than expected, but that doesn't really matter, as it all works together to produce a commendable alternative to you-know-who."
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before June 2013. Pours almost opaque dark brown color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of light milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, dark bread, toast, toffee, and some light and dark fruitiness. Solid and pleasant aromas with good balance; but there is hardly any strength here, very mild. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, light coffee, dark bread, toast, toffee, floral, and light fruitiness. Lingering notes of chocolate, roast, dark bread, light toffee, and light fruitiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice and pleasant balance of dark malt flavors and subtle fruitiness; with zero cloying flavors present on the finish as expected. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a lightly creamy and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a good dry stout. A little mild on flavors; but has good balance and is easy to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."
""
""
"O- The tartness starts to overpower the mellow black malt flavor and the overall flavor is a bit light and one-dimensional. I was a bit underwhelmed considering the quality stuff Brooklyn does."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - just not one of my favorite stouts, I think I prefer Guinness."

"On tap into a pint glass. Pours black/dark brown in the glass with a think covering of mocha foam. Solid retention and lacing. The aroma smells of cocoa, roasted coffee and a good bit of ripe citric hops, all giving this a rich tanginess in the nostrils. The taste is the same, with a smooth mix of chocolate, dark coffee flavors, some rather assertive ripe citrus flavors and a then a dry roasted finish. The feel is medium with a smooth and creamy carbonation in the mouth. Maybe it was the freshness here on draft but those hops really had a nice pop to them, with this overall having richness to the flavors that I wasn’t expecting. Maybe not exactly to style but I really enjoyed this."
""
"A fine dark beer with a smooth taste. Not heavy as you would expect a dark beer to be. Not as full body taste as I would like, far from over powering for those concerned by the appearance. The light taste does not make this a must beer for me, but it is not bad. Give it a try."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint tulip hybrid glass, best by June 2013. This pours a mostly black color with brown edges and a mid sized tan head. The smells are of dark roasted malts, a little milk sugar. The feel is medium, perhaps a little light. The taste is okay, light roasted malts but something seems missing, not my favorite from them."
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: A nice little dry stout with some character. Perfect session brew."
""
"Overall, this isn't bad. It looks good and smells good and the flavor profile is good, but the feel is wrong and I think it's overcarbonated for the style, which detracts from the overall presentation. With some slight tweaking I think this could be a lot better but as it is it's a slightly disappointing, though still decent beer."
"Overall not a bad beer, but it misses the mark in a lot of areas."

"I am so stoked to drink this today! The label is printed in gold for Brooklyn Brewery, Kelly Green for the Irish Catholics, Orange for the Irish Protestants and White for the eventual peace that will bring an end to The Troubles. The finger of rocky, deep-tan head was active with carbonation and quickly bubbled away on the morn, leaving some lovely lacing in its wake. Color was a deep-brown with little light penetration, just enough to show off its garnet highlights, especially at the edges. Talk about truth in advertising! The nose smelled of strong black coffee, dark chocolate and freshly dug dirt. Spot on, lads! Mouthfeel was medium and the roastiness of the malt was the prevalent flavor in the mouth. I would put it more towards coffee than chocolate in terms of initial flavor. It was on the finish that I really tasted the dark chocolate strongly. The lacing clung to the glass the way I clung to my maternal Grummy's leg as she moved about in her kitchen making Irish Soda Bread and other traditional meals when I was but a wee one. This was the perfect beer to start the day. May the roof above your heads never fall in and may the friends underneath it never fall out!"
"O - Nothing fantastic, but definitely decent, especially for $10.99/128oz on St Pattys Day!"
""
""
""
"I am typically not a huge fan of Brooklyn, or the style for that matter. I guess when the style is crappy nitro abominations that is to be expected. Though this is excellent. Subtle, but with plenty of character to go around. I very much enjoyed this, and highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
" The taste has a slight fruity taste from the yeast with mild chalky mineral essence and semi-high roastiness with no real bitter burnt flavor just nutty and almost bready malt with mild creamy and raisiny taste in the back with some light bitterness and gentle woody earthy character as it finishes dry. This is a great beer, which is an excellent example of the style with appropriate abv and dry texture and plenty of flavor considering the low abv, I would order this over Guinness since it seems fresher in taste."
"Not bad, definitely a dry stout. I could drink a lot of this, but i prefer my own homebrewed version."
""
"O - I have others in this style I think I like better. For those that love Brooklyn Brewery this is a decent beer but not a standout."
""
"Overall, I'm not terribly impressed with this beer. The mouthfeel is watery and the off flavors get to be a little much. With Guinness and Murphy's readily available along with O'haras, I can't see any reason to pick this up again. It doesn't really stack up to the Irish offerings."
""
"O- Nothing really stands out about this one, but it's not bad. Not a bad option if you are looking for a stout on the lighter side."
""
""
""
"M - This feels like it has more carbonation than most dry stouts I've tried. Other than that, it has a typical light, airy feel and is easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"This is quite the roasty and toasty stout. The dry tone doesn't really show up until the back end. But the roasted character really overshadows everything else, but not in too obnoxious a fashion. Easy to drink and consistent. Nice session beer, though I think it leans more towards American stout than a dry Irish one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall damn I am not sure why I haven't found this around PA but this is a great session stout with just enough flavor to keep me interested. Really filled my craving for a stout."
""
""
"Overall: A solid dry Irish stout."
"A nice simple dry stout. Good flavors, not grainy or watery. I dig that it is under 5%abv."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Super easy to drink and very sessionable with well hidden alcohol - very light in the mouthfeel. Not overly complex in smell or taste but this one would be great on nitro."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied. It is quite creamy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. I nice, if not very special. Nothing really jumps out, it's very unassuming. But it's not bad in any way. Refreshing and a nice session stout feel to it."
"Deep roasted malts up front, sweet, dark chocolate, coffee, slight burnt toast. Hop bitterness is moderate, leafy-earthy. Faint dark fruit towards the finish. Body is medium, slight silky mouthfeel, a little lively carbonated, very smooth."
""
""
""
"The feel is a letdown, and I'm not saying the beer has to have that creamy nitro Guinness thing going on. This one's still just a little too coarse, doesn't offer much else in flavor other than dry roast and coffee and earthy tones, and is just too faulty with attenuation and blandness. It's definitely not standing up to the Blue Chevre I'm eating. Let's hope it cools down and pairs well with a dinner of mushroom-swiss burgers and onion rings."
"Guinness clone. Only that Guinness is better."
""
""
"It's so very Garret Oliver - big on fancy talk and small on flavor."
""
""
""
"O: This beer doesn't have a very complex aroma or taste, but it's extremely sessionable. I would imagine that this would taste even better on a nitro-tap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Somehow, this beer seems funnier after having just watched Gangs of New York... Anyway, this stuff pours a deep black-brown topped by a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises mild coffee, roasted malts, and a twinge of bitter dark chocolate. The taste brings in more of the same, focusing on the coffee, darkening the roast of the malts, and adding a hint of cola in the background. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a surprisingly watery feel. Overall, a decent little Irish stout, but one that's way too thin for its own good and not creamy enough for mine."
""
""
"Overall- not too familiar with this style, but compared to Guinness it's very good, compared to American style stouts it's pretty weak and bland. But for 4.7 abv, this is a solid dark session beer (which seems to be the point of the Irish Dry Stout) with some good roasted flavors in there. Not a bad pick if in the mood for a lighter beer on the roasted/dark side of things"
""
""
"Taste is definitely drier than it smells, the roast is bigger too. Bitterness goes a long way on the finish. Body is thin...but not overly for the style. Pretty simple, not a whole lot of flavor, mostly just roasty malt with a slight sour twinge. I’d say this is a pretty mediocre offering in an already mediocre style category. Glad I bought a single instead of a whole sixer."
"This is a nice, flavorful dry stout. This has more flavor than a Guinness, though it may not be as traditional. This one has plenty of what I consider ""Americanized"" characteristics such as the faint coffee notes, caramel, and sugary aspects. Traditionally, (right or wrong, I'm not sure) I expect this style to be smoother with a more chocolaty, creamy, smooth, and roasty. Overall, though I liked this beer. It was highly drinkable and enjoyable."
""
""
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style. It’s a decent beer to drink for a while but there are better choices in the style."
"Had I bought the rest of the 6-pack, I could have downed them all tonight. Yes, this was that light and this didn't remind me of beer at all. While not a bad example of the style, I wish that there was more of a creamy and toffee-like tone to this, just to make it stand out a bit more. The East Kent Golding Hops may have lent just a bit of grassy bite to this but it's not enough and this needed a signature flavor to make it stand out just a bit above the level of ordinary."
"Poured into a Guinness pint glass a deep dark chocolate brown with a half finger beige colored head that held pretty well.Aromas consisted mainly of coffee and earth with mild bitter chocolate.A fuller nice feel in the mouth,pretty smooth.Dry and roasted on the palate as it should be,dark roast coffee,unsweetened chocolate,and earthiness mainly stood out.A no frills but pretty true to form Irish stout,I would drink again."
"Taste is smooth and almost smoky, with more of the charred chocolate and roasted coffee at the finish. Pretty tasty and well-done, and more than sessionable at only 4.7% percent ABV!"
""
"If you want a good stout, look elsewhere. The Brooklyn dark chocolate stout is excellent. Albeit in a different category, there is no reason this brewer cannot make a really first class dry stout."
" This would be a fun beer to serve at a St. Patrick's Day Celebration."
""
""
""
"Overall: Very drinkable, everyday Irish Stout. Enjoyable but doesn't stand out."
""
""
"Overall: Not bad! I'm actually happy have a readily available dry stout in bottles that isn't nitrogen infused."
"O- a nice dry Irish stout, a good session beer with good balance"
""
"Taste-Dark roasted malt, coffee, subtle hop note leads to a dry finish. Good flavor and character throughout. A fine session stout."
"looked great from the pour into a pint glass. Dark black color with a thin beige head. Strong smell of coffee. Taste the coffee as well but weak compared to smell. Mouthfeel is light bodied as well as carbonation. Its a good brew but not one that makes my top ten. I'll offer this to those that believe Guiness is too heavy."

"Pretty thin on flavor and rather watery. Easy drinking and sessionable."
"D: certainly a good example, nitro would put it over the top. if looking for roast and a super dry stout, check this out."
"O - a decent beer that I'll have again."
"Overall not bad, decent malt profile but gets slightly burnt acrid, nice hop addition, etc."
""
"O: It hits all the marks for the style, but it still comes across as a little bland. The foamy mouthfeel leaves a little something to be desired. The packaging and its gaudy green and orange coloring should help sell it when St Patrick's Day comes around, but there's better out there."
"Dry finish as advertized...nice new offering from BKLYN"
""
"D- a sessionable stout but rather monotone."
""
"A pretty good beer but not something i'd want more than one of. good balance, dry and solid hop bitterness. A great beer for st patty's day festivities"
""
"Gotta say, not quite how I expected it, but very good overall for a bottled ""Irish"" stout."

"all in all, this offering retains key qualities of the style, but adds some dimension to the product, giving it more depth and complexity, but arguably, expertly falling short of stepping out of bounds - hey, i like it!"

"The beer pours a dark brown color with an off-white head. The aroma has a good bit of chocolate in it, as well as a hint of roasted malt. The flavor is very similar. There is a ton of dry cocoa notes in the flavor, as well as some roasted malt. The beer is very dry overall. Thin mouthfeel and low carbonation."
""
"To top off the Guinness recreation the body is light and watery with little aftertaste. Effervescence is appropriate and well done but that and lacing alone will not save this beer. If I wanted a pin of the most famous stout I would have ordered it instead. This needs to be redone. An ashy note does show up in the aftertaste. Slight warming as well."
""
"Not bad, some interesting stuff going on, not all pleasant. Can't get around thinking it actually has some hop material suspended in it."
"Overall – It had some nice flavors due to the lighter hop and more cocoa at the end of the taste (which did it well), but the body was a little on the low side. Overall it was a just above average dry Irish."

"Overall, more flavorful in malt and hop than a guinness. Good, to me, for the style."

"Single finger head on a jet black body with decent lacing. Aroma is mild with roasted malt, mild licorice and chocolate note. Flavor is fairy watery with mostly roasted malt and light earthy and chocolate notes. Light bodies and moderate carbonation. Not my favorite genre as most are usually pretty simple. This one is definitely highly drinkable"
"An excellent session ale found on tap at Mad Mex Robinson, pours a pitch black body with a light khaki tan airy head...fluffy texture forming everlasting head that has great retention. Aroma kicks up mild herbal earthy mint like hop edge, amongst the dark roasted malts, creamy textured hints of dark chocolate and mild coffee but remains pleasantly roasty with malt character. I noticed a non nitro tap which was a plus and actually brought out more character in this beer. Dark roasted malts bring ample bitterness a touch of tea like leafy earthiness going on as well, but a semi sweet multi-dimensional malt complexity comes forth with each sip...hints of creaminess, dark chocolate roasts in a light stout form. Mouthfeel was medium bodied easy to drink, nothing cloying or harsh on the palate very approachable beer to drink in number. Overall, I'm happy to see Brooklyn putting out a stout other than Black Ops, or their Chocolate Stout, this was pure brilliance."
"D - quite drinkable and well made, not complex but enjoyable."
"Had a glass at Top Hops in LES. Ah, a nicely balanced Irish stout. There's a pleasing bitter tang in the finish with smooth mocha grains up front. It's like a slightly bigger version of Beamish. The body isn't light, but it's on that side of medium, and creamy. I wouldn't mind having a few pints. Tasty stout, find it if you can."

"O – This was just an average brew to me. I just didn’t get a depth of flavor I was expecting. It is not by any means bad but I would not reach for another. Certainly worth a try."
""
"o - Overall a decent beer from Brooklyn. Nose and taste have some light coffee and a lot ofroasted malts, nothing great really jumping out in either. Very nice body but otherwise a pretty standard irish dry. Probably wouldn't seek it out again."
"O-One of the better Irish Stouts I've had, it is a style I'm not too fond of but Brooklyn seems to have made a good one."
""
"O- had this one on st. Paddy's day, a perfect day for a beer like this. At 3.9%, this is a remarkably flavorful stout."
""
"It goes without saying that O'Hara's and Yard's have MUCH better offerings in the Philly area. Honestly, I'd much prefer a Guinness Extra Stout, next time. Or even a Donnybrook or Sly Fox version of the Irish Stout, though they're half the strength."

""
"Overall: A very good take on an Irish Dry Stout. Very impressive taste for an ABV lower than the typical mass produced light beer."
""
""
"O: Nicely done. Full-flavored, dry. Meets the style guidelines just about perfectly."
""
"Brooklyn's Irish Dry Stout is a great and characterful ale to drink while clinging mugs with pub goers on the greenest holiday without worry of accessive drunkenness or palate fatigue. But for the staunch Stout lover, the beer is going to seem timid and lackluster."
""
"Comes out of the tap a nearly opaque dark chocolate brown with a fairly thick light tan head - a good start. Strong aroma has semi-sweet chocolate, caramel and yeasty tones. Satisfying flavor is only subtly smoky, but has good coffee, chocolate and licorice notes plus hints of caramel and - is that horehound? Whatever. Texture seems a bit on the thin side for a stout, but is still decently fizzy. Overall, if not great, still worthy of a try."
"overall this was pretty average for the style. i feel like a nitro tap would improve this beer overall so much. id gladly take this over guiness, slightly more flavor and body, but really not something i would buy again."
