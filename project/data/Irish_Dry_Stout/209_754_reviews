"What can I say? I love a Guinness. Everything about it just works. My go-to."
""
"Not the best but certainly not the worst"
""
"This has always been my can't go wrong beer. It is a nice shuttle dark beer with the right thickness and darkness for my taste."
""
""
""
""
"First stout of any kind I'd ever tried, like most people I suppose. still drink it from time to time when i need a smooth drinking dark beer. all around good dry stout. you know that though."
""
""
"Always reliable, delicious, and light. Goes down as smooth as can be."
""
"Classic stout. Always my default."
"Smooth, creamy taste. Delicious strong flavour."
""
"Very smooth and thick. A classic basis for the dry stout style full of taste and texture"
""
"The definition of dry Irish stouts."
"From a draught can.  Pours a dark black with the typical Guinness cascade from milk chocolate to black and cream tan head.  Aroma is faint, but has slight roast.  Taste is bittersweet chocolate and light roast.  Mouthfeel is medium and smooth.  Overall, not a bad beer for being a mass produced, approachable stout."
"My single favorite beer ever"
""
""
"Keep it classic..."
"It's a great beer that grows on you in texture, taste, and looks."
"Although I'm more of an IPA guy, this will remain one of my favorites. Best when enjoyed fresh in Dublin!"
""
""
""
""
"Great beer!  It took me a long time to build up the courage to try this beer.  Tried it for the first time at Bible study a few weeks ago.  My faith has indeed been restored!"
""
"The best commercially available beer."
"One of my favorites, a classic."
"Guiness is flat out a great beer."
"One of my favorite beers.  Just bursts with flavor.  Refreshing and drinkable for any occasion."
""
"Poured from a can into a 16 oz pint glass. Dark, deep amber-ebony color with a smooth thick head. Smells of malt. Tastes of roasted malt at first, slight bitter tinge of baking chocolate, watery but clean finish with notes of coffee. Light, watery mouthfeel, though thick foam head adds some creamy texture. Inoffensive, pleasant session stout and balanced. Best enjoyed on tap, of course. A pub classic with high nostalgia points. (The first pint I ever drank was this in Galway City, age fourteen.)"
"It's Guinness, the beer that got me into Stouts, and changed my beer game forever...the hell with crap ipa, and the bud lights of the world...browns, porters, and stouts are where its at!  Hail Guinness for quality and flavor, and hail Nitro Stouts!"
""
""
""
"Mothersmilk. One of the greats"
""
""
""
"Very heavy, rich and creamy but not my type. I still can find it enjoyable on some occasions though. Feel like this beer will clearly have advocates and critics."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Easily one of my all time favorites. Looks beautiful, with a nice thick head and dark coloration. Smells great too. The taste is a little watery, but it still tastes strongly of roasted coffee and chocolate. Reminds me of an iced mocha. Goes down very smooth. A classic."
"Smooth and unique dry Irish stout."
"Perfect all day drinking beer. Pasturizing allows for no gas bubbles and easy drinking"
""
"OVERALL:  this beer would have rated higher if not for the watery taste, it has a lot going for it but just does not quite hit the mark, still a very good stout, I like a more subtle tasting stout, I would have this again no problem."
""
""
""
"Still and always the best"
"Draught pour in a branded glass in my local village pub by a bartender rated 1st in the county and 3rd overall in the Guinness Central Florida Pour-Off 2 years running. Appearance is outstanding with a almost black body and creamy head that lasts all the way to the bottom with cascading bubbles until it settles down and she serves it. The aroma of sweet malt, roasted coffee and lastly the bitterness is perfect. The taste is a blend of tart and bitter with a smokey flavor (I like burnt-smokey alcoholic drinks). The feel is a rich cream giving way to a somewhat lighter than expected ending, overall a stout you can keep on drinking."
""
"Anyway. It looked fabulous as always. The billowy silky smooth dark tan foam retained all the way down to the bottom of the glass. The beer is black and refuses any light to pass through. It smells carbonic and minerally, which sadly covered up any beer aroma for me. Nitro beers... It tasted better than I remember. The silky creaminess balanced nicely with the slightly bitter charred wood of the brew with espresso undertones. The deep burnt roast lingers long and very mildly sweet. I liked the rich creaminess. The lively epravescance keeps the creaminess at bay and keeps it from feeling like a milkshake. This beer was far better than I remember; I've sampled hundreds of other beers since the last. It's a good solid beer maybe 60-75 percentile. It's a good option at those crummy 5 beer restaurants that only serve this, a macro beer, macro beer light, a heffe, and a bad pale."

"Well it's St Patrick's Day, and I would have preferred an Extra Stout, or Foreign Extra, but a can of Guinness Draught will do. It opens with a pop and a strange squeal from the hidden nitro widget. It resembles coffee with cream as it pours in to the trademark Guinness Perfect Pint glass. There's a beautiful cascade effect as the darker suds fight their way to the bottom. What's left when it's all said and done is a picture perfect pint. Deep, dark brown, nearly black, with ruby highlights where the light hits the base of the glass just right. The head is a solid inch of custard like foam, so densely packed that only a close examination reveals the miniscule bubbles. Dip your finger in to it and the impression remains, like icing on a cake. Guinness draught definitely has the look down. Perhaps one of the most appealing appearances of any beer out there. The aroma brings faint chocolate malts, black coffee and a little sourness on the nose. A hint of the roasted bitterness that is sure to come out in the flavor. Mild, yet characteristic of a dry Irish stout. The taste brings a bit of tartness, married with a nice bittering ash that creates a smoky, mild flavor. Lingering roast dominates the finish. Fairly simple, yet nuanced. Certainly on the thin, easy side of the spectrum. The mouthfeel is creamy and rich in the beginning, and then thin and watery as the nitro loses steam. Personally, I think it loses something in the draught flow cans. It's a novel concept that brings it to your fridge, but no substitute for the real draught Guinness on tap. That said, it's still a great example of the style. Simple, uncomplicated, accessible. A great beer to broaden your horizons with."

"I don't get why people drink this so much"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-  overrated, but it's okay."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's an okay stout; however I wouldn't go out of my way to try it again."
""
""
""
""
"I love this beer. It looks, smells, and tastes fantastic. With rich coffee and dark chocolate flavors, dark almost black color with a thick off white head. All of this comes together great, I just feel like it should be a little thicker."
"I thought this beer would be a lot stronger and have a more robust taste. However it want bad and ill drink it tonight to pay homage to st Patrick's day"
"Had to score this one lower,  it looks pretty impressive with a lava lamp type of current and a constant 1-2 finger froth. But I was expecting a more flavorful and thicker beer but it was so airy that it didn't feel like I was drinking anything."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Extremely thick but I think it's pretty decent. I only drink it on special occasions though."
""
""
"She's a beauty to look at for sure.  This is a highly sessionable stout with a very light almost airy mouthfeel compared to other stouts.  At this point I accept Guinness for what it is--a very well made and enjoyable beer that just doesn't have much going on in the aroma and taste departments."
""
""
"Overall : Very accessible classical craft. Great balance in flavors and well intensified with good freshness."
"A classic. Love the look, feel, and taste"
""
""
"An always enjoyable, sessionable stout. Thin for the style though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste isn't bad but it's thin like water. It's so awkward to drink cause you taste the totasted coffee flavors but the mouthfeel is awful. But I'm in PA where the bartender prbably didn't pour a ""proper"" Guinness."
"very good beer,only had it in a black and tan, very creamy feel,have to try it by itself soon"
""
"It is everything we ask for every sip."
"I loved this beer before I started drinking stouts.  Now it serves as a go-to when there are no better options on draft.  It's gorgeous to look at however."
""
""
""
""
""
"I love Guinness. I know it isn't exciting, complex, interesting or even amazingly delicious, (especially compared to so many of the incredible beers that are brewed today) but I love it all the same. Maybe it's just the experience that comes with each glorious pint that I enjoy so much; Sitting down in a laid-back pub with friends, grinning like an idiot, just enjoying myself. For me, Guinness fills that perfect little niche between the crappy big-brand beers that you can mindlessly chug one after another, and the stupid-good craft brews that will put you on your ass after just a few."
""
""
""
""
""
"This stout is thick and creamy with a roasted flavor to it. I judge other stouts based on Guinness and only a few of them have met the same level for me. This is an excellent beer to have after a long day of skiing next to a fireplace."
""
"Looks fine in the glass but has minimal taste and feels like drinking water - very thin.  There are better things from Guinness."
"Never been a fan; not enough taste given how heavy it is"
"3/3 (Draft Chicago Houlihans) - Dark pour with minimal texture or aroma. Very smooth pour, light taste and abv. Was a regular consumer as a teen, young adult, but moved on to stronger beers with a better taste."
"But I think that is admirable as it makes it a ""go to"" when there is nothing else to choose from besides a Light beer or something. Therefore, I can see why it is definitely a ""classic"" in the same sense that Bass Ale is a classic along with Sam Adams lager and Sierra Nevada pale being ""new classics."""
"Maybe it's better in Ireland."
""
"I like the Stout much better. I will not buy it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Guinness is the beer that breaks you in to a stout. It's also the go to beer when the bar has not much to offer. My only complaint is that it's on the weak side @ 4.2% but it remains a classic."
""
"Overly filling and bland. Looks really cool with the layering and nitro pour but disappoints the taste buds."
""
""
"When I had my first pint of Guinness, I was 18 and drinking in a pub near the Tower of London. The barkeep smiled and assured me, ""it's like black milk, lad."" This is true comfort beer - lovely to look at, smooth in taste and mouthfeel, and a true ""experience"". As my palate has become more seasoned, I've found other beers more complex and tasty. For me, drinking Guinness is like remembering your first kiss. It's magic."
"overall a classic"
""
"Good Beer, Nice Pour, not an ""easy drinker"""
""
""
"O-I am not one to rag on the other Guinness varieties, e.g., the Extra is pretty decent, but this version is a letdown. The look is right, but I could not get over the watery aspects of this beer-it smells watery, it tastes watery, and it feels watery. Oh well."
""
"My favorite looking beer.  Love that head."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I know this is going to sound odd but it taste better in Ireland than it does is the United States."
""
""
"It's an institution...what can I say that hasn't been said before...both + or -... ?..."
""
""
"If it tasted as good as it looked, this would be one of my favorite beers."
""
""
""
"Poured this into a Guinness glass, this one receives high marks with regards to appearance and smell. It's essentially black with a  really nice off white creamy head, and smells of coffee with traces of chocolate. Taste and feel is a little lackluster in my opinion. It's a little too light bodied for my taste, but the coffee and roasted malt flavors are pretty tasty."
""
"Amazing beer great taste and goes down smooth love it"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The standard by which all other Irish brews are measured."
""
""
"Dry creamy feel. Subtle roasted malt aroma. Predominately pitch black but has some brown around the edge. Faint chalky feel. Rich tan head that leaves a handsome film on the glass. I can’t detect any negative characteristics. Clean finish with a mild tingle of sweetness occasionally."
"Tap Guinness has a bit of chocolate with coffee aftertaste. So many flavors going on. Very smooth and nice. Very nice stout."
"On tap, this is one of my favorite beers. Out of a bottle, not so much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Love it, just rarely drink it"
"If you want to get into the stout, here's your beer. Just make sure to let it warm up a little bit before drinking!"
""
""
"It has its place. Smooth with a good finish. Not nearly as potent as it appears."
"Not a terrible brew by any means, a very good go to if you don't have a decent selection on hand."
"Still my favorite of all the stouts...."
""
""
"Not the best stout. But suitable in a pinch."
""
""
"The budweiser of stouts. Black water."
""
""
"This is one of those beers, either you like it or you don't.  I love it.  Very nice taste, you can really savor the flavor, especially when it's from the tap.  Goes great with food too.  Cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great go-to beer and is always in my fridge. What I like is that although it is a dark beer and very smoky, it is also very refreshing. I could never turn down a Guinness, goes well with seafood as well as steaks and stews... Also great to cook with, it makes stews a lot richer, smokier and toastier. Yesterday I made some chicken étouffée and added a can of the black stuff and came out fantastic! Cheers fellas!!"
"I just can't get into heavy, dark beers."
""
""
"Very overrated beer. It is very popular, pricy, but still - famous and beloved in Russia. Fine, but not extraordinary."
""
""
"Watered down session stout served cold on nitro."
""
""
""
"It took a few pints of this thick rick heavy beer.  The first time I had it, i could hardly drink it. Keep in mind my beer of choice then was Coors Light.  It is a drastic difference from an American Lager to the stout beer  AWESOME beer to make the transition from lagers, and and such."
""
""
""
""
"Not a big fan of dark stout beers but was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this beer! Will be drinking more!"
"Easy drinking stout that's reminiscent of chocolate milk but too watery for my taste.  Its Guinness extra diluted but with some of the nice Guinness characteristics."
"Best beer ever. The best."
"Classic beer best enjoyed on tap at an Irish pub or festival"
""
""
"One of my favorite beers to drink.  Heavy but amazing."
""
""
"I personally love the color, strong taste that goes great along with foods. My favorite beer at the moment."
""
"Black creamy goodness! Absolutely requires knowledgeable bar staff and correct setup to be enjoyed to its maximum."
"Guinness Draught: my go to beer before the craft scene took off.  It's the stout of which all other stouts are based off, with hints of chocolate, coffee and caramel and a fairly light body and light carbonation that goes down smooth.  A perfect session beer that is best served on a nitrogen tap."
""
""
""
"The original love from my youth"
"Went back to it at Joe's Crab Shack as it's been years since I have had one. Not near as bold and thick as I remember. Still pours beautiful with a promising creamy malty smell but that's where it stops. Taste is very mild, actually smoother and less bold than a american adjacent lager and about as filling. Don't let the black color fool you its a very smooth and mild brew."
"It's like drinking chocolate milk."
"Dark beer standard.  Very malty, rich and filling.  Bitter finish.  I can't drink more than one."
"One of my favorite beers."
""
""
""
"All of my friends are obsessed with this beer and to be honest it was a good beer not a great beer. Nothing to write  home about. I'll have another next winter when the snow is piling up and I need something heavy and warming."
""
""
"Overall not a bad taste. A lot lighter than I expected for a guiness. I'd drink it again."
""
"Maybe cliched to love this beer but it has become the ultimate standard fur me. Beautiful, fragrant, delicious."
""
""
"First stout every, and that lead to a long relationship with that beer type lol"
""
""
""
"11.2 oz. bottle from Trader Joe’s. Pours dark brown; turns black. Light tan to almost eggshell white head. Nose of mild yeast and malt. Taste of mild caramel roastiness, slightly grassy, a bit of dark chocolate with a little hop bitterness on the back end. It’s dry and light; tasty for what is essentially a light beer"
""
"always a decent go to at a local fish fry"
""
""
""
"I had my first Guinness in a while.  I forgot how little taste it has."
"I LOVE Guinness. When pored well from a good pub there has never been a more complete beer. The cascading is beautiful as the beer settles. It has a full flavor and a really smooth texture. I have tried a lot of other very good porters/stouts, but Guinness is the best."
"One of the best beers out there when you get a pint that has been poured correctly. Sadly, you don't get anywhere near the same experience if you buy it bottled and many pubs in the States don't bother to pour it correctly."
"There's nothing wrong with a classic. The draw to Guinness is not its complexity or intensity, but it's smooth mouthfeel, it's consistent malt flavor, and the classic-ness of Guinness and it's legacy. Some beers will come and go, but Guinness will always be around, and there's something to be said for that."
""
"By far my favorite beer.  Smooth, easy to drink and not filling as a lot of lagers are."
"I can't believe this isn't considered the best beer in the world. With a score of 80 around here?"
"My favorite dark beer. Wish I had a dollar for every pint I've put down"
""
""
"Just classic irish dry stout. Love it"
""
""
""
""
""
"it's a classic that lives up to the hype."
""
"From the can its okay, definitely not the same as draft. But I am no expert (still learning) overall it is still a great beer to have. From Draft is the best, it is one of my favorite beers."
""
""
"really good tasting stout one of my favorites"
""
"To think this is probably the all time best selling dark beer is hard to understand. I just tried it again the other day from a tavern that pours a ton of it every day. It's okay but nothing special compared to some of the great porters and stouts that are on the market now."
""
""
"Best from tap (if poured correctly). Black with a smooth creamy head. Hints of coffee, chocolates and caramel."
""
""
""
"From tap, black opaque with low creamy hard head. Aroma with notes of caramel, coffee, bread and herbs. Taste is full and semi dry."
""
"I ended up having this in a can. I didn't realize you were suppose to let it sit. Even with that it wasn't very great. I've had better"
"This is my first review and I thought I'd start with a beer I really enjoy.  I guess I'm an ""outlier"" on this one, but I really love this stout."
""
"Overall: It's a classic. If i'm not drinking some new, crazy, hoppy craft beer, I kind of enjoy having the Guinness to fall back on! It's one of the few mass-produced beers that I feel no guilt in drinking. Great beer!! 3.75 overall"
"It is the greatest beer in all the world"
""
""
""
""
""
"Sometimes you gotta have a Guinness. Once the ""dark"" beer when there were no others, it's now a little mild comparatively. Still the classic taste. Make sure the bartender pours it correctly!"
""
"stouts are my favorite, will never forget my first experience.... it was bad. but now I love it. I think it was skunky"
""
""
""
"This is my favorite stout of all time!!"
"Even after I tell myself that I can drink no more beer- I always have room for a Guinness- cause it's desert!"
""
"What can be said? It's Guinness for Christ's sake."
"Love the cascade and smooth taste"
"Overall: A reasonably priced macro which I intend on buying again."
"I know people say that there are better stouts out there, and I've had a lot of them, but this is and probably will always remain one of my favorite beers.  Just a classic."
""
"Velvet black candy. A perfect beer. Mass produced for your pleasure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"smooth high drinkability. Nice notes of caramel and chocolate and coffee"
""
""
"Obviously one f the classics, with its unique, almost indiscernible flavor that can only come from the hard waters of Dublin, an excellent chaser depending on the environment"
"If someone was to force me to drink one beer for the rest of my life this would be the one"
"Great, smooth high drinkability. Nice notes of caramel and chocolate"
""
"One of my favorite macro beers. A classic. Pours black (it's actually a dark shade of red - hold it in the light). Beautiful white foam head. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy like velvet. Taste is like a creamy coffee but more bitter and fluffy. Everyone should try one at some point. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Love it. Hands down a staple and constant can't go wrong beer."
""
"i dont understand the point in the idea of a non carbonated brew , dont get me wrong i am all for the ""unconventional "" product .. but this one was not for me :-("
""
"Not as bad as I expected, but not good."
""
"Great flavor though thin.  Wish it had more chew, but I'll never turn down a Guiness.  One of my favorites."
""
""
"How beer should taste, smell, feel and look."
"Smooth and silky mouth taste. Slight pleasant  bitterness."

""

"Hard to beat the classic- always true"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I do like Guinness, but it is a little too coffee for my taste. That doesn't mean it isn't a good beer to enjoy every now and then, and it is now a very reasonable price also at AU$53 a case of 24 x 440mL cans. All in all I'm more of a Kilkenny fan."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Damn it, I like Guinness Draught! I know it doesn't get the best rap here, but it's so damn sessionable & the nitro effect with the everlasting snow white head & pitch black beer...priceless."

"The original stout. Can't hate too much on Guinness, it got me into the stouts and porters I enjoy so much today. Very light taste, faint coffee flavor, but still enjoyable."

"Overall: Guiness is of course a classic, and was my first non BMC beer, like it is for many Americans. However, there are so many better examples of the style out there now with more depth and flavor, especially as Ireland's craft beer industry grows more and more."
""
""
""
"The beer that introduced me to Irish Draughts. I bought this recently in the Guinness Variety pack. Poured in glass. Good beer. Lots of flavors and a nice discolored head that stays until you are finished. Earthy and Roasty as well as MaltsWell-balanced, smooth, and a very dark but not completely dark color. Alot of flavors going on here. This is an iconic beer that is just simply well made. If you haven't tried Guinness, you should  give it a try. The more I drink it, the more I enjoy it! Cheers."
""
""
"Taste: Creamy roasted malts, it really tastes like a lot out there and honestly more watery than some other craft breweries are doing with the style, especially nitro beers. But this truly is a classic. It gets points for that and was the best beer I had ever drank the first time I had tried it after years of drinking macro lager swill."
""
""
"My Dad helped me get a taste for this amazing stout. If you're new to darker beers, it may be rough going at first. But a couple of glasses or bottles in, your palate will adjust. That said, it's not the kind of beer you wanna rush through at a frat party. It's a beer for relaxing on a day off, and not rushing a damn thing."

"I have a bit of a bias towards Guinness being one of my favorite beers wether on tap, in nitro can or bottle. Poured into Guinness glass. Cascades into finger of head. Fluffy like a marshmallow thick and heavy. Black body. Very good lacing. Thick head to get past into watery mouthfeel but slick. Taste is roasty malt subtle yeast. One of my favorite beers"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Absolutely delicious. I thoroughly enjoy the creamy head, and the general smoothness of the beer. Tastes as good out of a widget can as it does off of draught. Out of a bottle, some of the general character is lost (tastes a little crisper, sharper) but is still good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Served in a glass from the widget can."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Favorite beer of all time. Nothing better then after a long hard week cleaning up and drinking a fresh poured pint of Black. Far too heavy for me to drink all night socially. Love the hints of Coffee and Carmel."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: It is a good beer if you like stout, but want something that is not too heavy (AKA you want to drink multiple). It is also good because it is the only stout that normally remains on tap, at least in Canada."

"A great tasting stout, but saying that there are plenty of other stouts that can surpass it in both flavour and texture. It all depends on the bar in which the pint was served to be honest, as the pipes that supply the draught have to be cleaned on a daily basis."

"A meal in a can, as they say.  A good dry stout, typical of the style, but so many small craft brewers have made improvements on this original.  Yes, it's got the history and the name, and it's fine if that's what is available, but you can probably do better with just a little more effort."

"While there is No doubt that this Stout is an ""All-Time Classic"" we still need to be judgmental and honest went rating it..... This filling yet watery stout has a toasty almost burnt flavor that is perfect for sipping.....but if you are planning to have more than two pints you might want to go in another direction."

"Overall - Not mush to compare it to this beer has a taste all of its own. That does not make it the king of Stouts that its branding would have you believe it is but for what it is meant to be this is a decent enough brew. This beer is more than drinkable and is a longstanding favourite here in Ireland its relatively low alcohol content makes it a very sociable drink and not too heavy on the gut like some."

"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 13A). Can 44 cl - Batch L4133GE002. AROMA: roasted coffe like aroma with cocoa notes. some faint alcoholic aromas. low esters and very low hop aromas. APPEARANCE: jet black color and opaque with ruby highlights. thick slight tanned head with good retention. TASTE: roasted flavours with a coffee-like dry finish. some chocolate sweet flavour. medium-low bitterness and no hop flavours. PALATE: medium-light body with a creamy sensation. low carbonation and no astringency. OVERALL: a good and creamy dry stout that maybe would benefit from a little more hop bitterness."

"For what this beer is , it is in a class onto itself. THis is one of my all time go too beers . if you want flavor , something light (Yes i said something light ) then grab a Guinness . low ABV and very light mouth feel . this is my idea of a Macro beer AKA coors light . i keep Guinness on tap always at my home along with two other beers on tap (usally HOp Devil) and many other crafted bottle beer . if you are looking for a high complex Stout this is not for you . this is something you can session and goes down nice after cutting the grass..."

"Wonderfully smooth and creamy. Pours to a thick, frothy head, delicate like light whipped cream. The aroma is mostly roasted malt, little to no bitterness. The taste follows the nose, but a little sweeter and creamier. Almost milky, but in a very enjoyable way. Hints of chocolate. Has a reputation for being a heavy beer but really it's more creamy and smooth than anything."

"While not the best stout, and certainly not the worst stout, one can't go wrong with a Guinness. You know what you are paying for and you know despite it's mediocrity compared to other more complex stouts, it is after all a Guinness and a classic. More of a starter stout for newbies opening up to the world of stouts, it pours a opaque dark brown almost black color, has an impressive 1.5 inch foamy creamy khaki head that dissipates very slowly (thanks to the nitro tap), most places put the clover in the head as well. Once dissipated it leaves minor lacing on the glass. The aroma is of roast, subtle coffee overtones, and a slightly acidic zing to the nostrils. It tastes rather dull, mostly the same as the aromas previously mentioned.  The mouthfeel is thin and watery though balanced with the thick head, a lot lighter body than what you would suspect after first looking at a Guinness. Overall, like I said, it's a classic and you when you want a Guinness you want a Guinness."
""
""
"I ONLY drink this out of the nitro cans when store bought.  The bottle stuff is crap.  Smooth and creamy; almost like drinking beer clouds.  Love it or hate it, this beer demands respect.  My Irish blood demands this on occasion."

"A long time ago, before I really stated learning about beer, I bought the Guinnes hype. Like most people I found the first few pints  unpalatable but came to like the beer after some time. Then I discovered real flavour and didn't touch Guinness again for years. A pint of Guinness looks great, smells uninteresting,,  has a one dimensional burnt flavour devoid of hops and an overdeveloped nitro-head that doesn't seem to do anything other than maintain the good appearance until the point is finished. If you want to drink Guinness and have flavour, ditch this and stick to the foreign extra offering."
""
""
"Last time I went to the aforementioned pub I brought a friend along, and she also ordered a Guinness. I figured she knew what she was doing. Well, that ended with me having two beers, and her having a hard cider."

" planning on being strong. And it's not. Earthy, hints of char light smooth and finishes slightly with a faint bitterness from roast . It had a slight imperfection in the mouthfeel as it was actually grainy at the back palate. An actual sensation of something faintly gritty."

"Is this the best beer ever? No, probably not. But sometimes when you want a Guinness, that's all you want and nothing else will do. I always laugh when people seem impressed that I like Guinness because it is such a....big beer. I think, what is big about it? It's very low in alcohol compared to most of the American ABV bombs out there. It is very smooth. Not tons of flavor. Creamy. It is dark and that intimidates most people but I find it more mild than most beers. In some ways I get that the overall review for this beer is ""okay"". But then I don't!!! This is a Guinness! Have some respect!"

"A standard wherever you go. The appearance is a dark black with a coffee head that takes a while to settle down. The smell is mostly malt with a bit of bread smell on the end. The taste was not bad with flavors of sweet malt and caramel with a light finish. The mouthfeel was a bit thin but enjoyable none the less."
""
""
""
"This beer is a really dark and heavy beer. At least it was that way for myself. I enjoyed this beer, but it is also one of those beers that I have to be in the mood for at the same time. The aroma was a good aroma. Their is a lot of head with this beer. Wich I do not mind that much. But for a dark beer it was not that bad."

The appearance looks good with the cascading effect in the glass, the smell is pretty typical stout, roasted malts with hint of coffee/chocolate. Then I got to the taste....yuck! Im not sure how they call that a stout but it is so watery and bland its borderline just gross! Not too happy with this beer by Guinness"

"I do believe this is a better beer in Ireland. Had the pleasure of touring St. James Brewery. To watch the boil of a perfectly drawn Guinness is a true pleasure. From the creamy head to the hints of chocolate/coffee tones, I rather enjoy this beer. It's rich history helps to create a rather magical experience for the consumer. The best stout I've ever had? Probably not... But none can match this beer's place in history. After all, those stouts that we enjoy today were built upon this beer's foundation!"

If i could class guinness id say it rates flavorwise with a cheap light beer. Guiness is disappointing on all levels. I have a hard time with all the peeps who swear by it. This is the beer for people who want to look bad ass, but still drink a pussy beer. :)"

"Poured an almost non-existent head. Beer is a dark, seemingly opaque brown. Has a malty smell. Slightly watered down malty, chocolate taste. Some lacing occurs. Has a slightly bitter aftertaste. Ultimately, this was a good beer. Didn't like it in college but it has grown on me through time. This will definitely not be the last time I buy Guinness. Almost makes me want shepherd's pie."
""
""
""
"Other than Murphy's, this is probably the worst stout on Earth. Thin, watery, bitter, flat and slightly 'off' tasting. Looks okay, doesn't smell too bad or have a terrible mouth feel (like water), but it's so thin and dry there's no desire to finish the bottle. Won't poison you, but I'd need to be awfully thirsty before I'd bother drinking it."

""
"O- I would be lying if I said that I was not disappointed. Guinness carries the reputation of being a beer that you drink with a spoon, however, this was far from that. Maybe the Guinness of the past, but not now. Stick to the extra stout for a real beer."

"Pours a very dark brown, almost bitch black in color with ruby high lights with about a 1-finger beige creamy head. Lots of sticky lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is of roasted malts/barley with a hint of coffee. The taste is about the same and is smooth and creamy. Perfect carbonation and goes down easy. No bitter or harsh aftertaste. Much better than the regular Guiness in my opinion."

"In my opinion Guinness Draught is the most perfect beer out there. The hints of caramel and smooth taste and finish make this one of my all-time favorites. The fact that the nitro can Guinness tastes exactly the same as the Guinness you can get on tap, is a huge plus. There are not too many beers in which you can say that about. I am partial in rating this as Guinness is my favorite. I'm sure there are other beers out there, but Guinness is easy to find and always found in my fridge!"

"Had the pleasure of dragging my bride to Ireland and visit where it all began. I've always loved the silky smooth caress the stout gives my tongue with each drink. It's a work of art in action watching the amber bubbles swirl in the chocolaty darkness. I wish that every beer lover could visit this place just once to taste this mana from Heaven."
""
"Haven't had Guinness since I started regularly drinking craft brews, and my standards have certainly risen. Still a beauty to pour, but no longer held in high esteem. Thin-bodied, watery, bland. Like drinking a silky water. Nice to revisit, but no longer a go-to."

"Guiness is certainly a dark beer. I had it on tap and it turned out to be quite pleasant. Very frothy. Good carbonation levels takes a while for the head to settle. I would reccomend guiness if youre interested in dark beers. Nice clean mouth feel with little lingering flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
"Many years ago this was my first experience with dark beer. I believed it to be then...not so much now. This stout pours a deep mahogany color with a thick off white head and lacing. The nose is an unnecessarily sweet blend of coffee and; unfortunately, adjunct malts. The mouth is very smooth and very creamy. We all know the guinness mouthfeel and wish so many other beers could achieve it. The flavor is overly sweet and seems like mass produced beer. Yet it still has all the rich flavors of roasted coffee, vanilla, and dark chocolate. For a mass produced stout it is well crafted but lacks the finesse and refinement of other craft stouts."

"Guiness on tap can be pretty spectacular. That glorious head of foam! The magnificent froth! That dark, luscious color. Very, very creamy when you start to sip. Tastes smooth, almost buttery, lightly roasted, no discernible hops or carbonation to me. This is a classic beer that is surprisingly light, despite its dark color and creaminess. Tastes great in an Irish pub (or, almost anywhere)."

"I really can't rip on this beer- though that seems popular in these web pages. People in my town seem to really like it (Butte, Montana, home of a large Irish-American population). I've not actually drank much Guinness, it wasn't very available during my younger years, and so I can't compare it to the Guinness of yore or of Ireland that many people equate with the beverage of the gods. I've had it on draft locally and thought it was perfectly fine, though nothing to rave over- it also makes a good black and tan. It makes a pretty good session beer since it is rather light in carbs, calories and alcohol."

"O: I'm not familiar with the dry Irish stout style. I've had Guinness Extra Stout and Guinness Black Lager, both of which I find much more enjoyable. I can't see buying Guinness Draught over Guinness Extra Stout for any reason. Based on other reviews along with some articles it seems that this beer is no stranger to change and it may not be in top form at the moment."
"overall its not a bad beer, however i prefer a thicker, stronger, more robust stout. i was introduced to Guinness a long time ago with Irish car bombs. but now i ask for an English car bomb. (i find no difference between draught in nitro cans or bottles)"

"Got a can from the pool bar at the Royal Pacific Resort, Orlando. The place is great (gotta love the fast pass at Universal Studios), but man, this beer sucks. I like Guiness stout, but this is nothing like that. Looks good enough, but there's hardly any aroma and it tastes like flat, bland water. I mean, why bother? If you like tasting absolutely nothing in a beer, then go for it. Otherwise, pass on this swill."

"O: I like this beer. It's a solid nitro stout. I'd recommend it if you want to consume a lot of cheep beer without getting a sour aftertaste (Guinness leaves a pleasantly bitter aftertaste). I'd also recommend it if you don't want to spend a ton of money on craft beer at a bar and just want to hang out and be casual."
""
"If you're a beer drinker, you've GOT to taste a Guinness draft. So dark, yet so smooth -- and the ""settling"" is a process in itself. Very good taste and appropriately Irish. Very good. To be able to drink one in Dublin, Belfast, Glasgow or Edinburgh is to taste it just right. One of the oldest beers in the world."

"BOTTOM LINE: Meh. I would only recommend this beer if you've never tried it, just to add it to your repertoire. Manage your expectations though. The only good thing I can really say about it is that it looks pretty when you pour it."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A very light stout without much flavor. Always gives me a chuckle when people refer to beers as ""as thick as Guinness"". I guess it is what it is, a refreshing stout. Thing is, I don't really want my stouts to be refreshing."
""
"Overall: Guinness Draught is much-maligned, but it gets the job done. I feel this beer's rating suffers because so many people think of it as the apex of beer and it's clearly not. But at the end of the day, it's a fine substitute for a chocolatey dessert. You know what you're getting into here; just enjoy it."
""
""
""
"Not sure if one can make a sound argument against Guinness Draught. You don't even need to taste it to know that it has full flavor, you can clearly see it. This is one of my favorites, it really goes good with most things, but especially burgers and other red meat. If you haven't tried this beer (where have you been?), I would strongly recommend it."
""
"O- Guinness Draught always looks great. It's too bad that the rest it does not measure up. Not all bad of a light beer, however."
""
""
"Few beers are as beautiful as this one. Yes, it is completely overrated. It tastes like a water of sorts, has a very faint smell, has a low ABV, and costs too much. However, it's still enjoyable in the total sum of all its parts (and has a great story and history). It's amazingly drinkable and smooth. I will, of course and with little shame, get this again."
""
""
"O - I understand that most Irishmen say you haven't had a real Guinness unless it's straight from the horse's mouth. I can definitely see where they're coming from. I hope to visit Ireland soon (not just for the beer of course (although that is one reason)), and I will definitely have to try it out. However, I've never had a pint of this beer that I didn't like. Great drinking experience that is widely available. Looking forward to my next one."

"Jet black in appearance and no light is getting through this brew. Nice half inch thick layer of tightly packed foam on top. Brussel's lace on the glass. Lots of roasted barley in the nose. The mouth is creamy,dry,and silky smooth. I get loads and loads of roasted barley and a bit of raisins in the flavor."

"This legendary Irish Stout is only good on tap. Served in any other form, it is a completely different drink. A very nice stout, defenitely not Ireland's best. If you are visiting Ireland, I would reccomend buying one of these, but not before Beamish. Personally, I think this is much heavier than Beamish, and taste can differ from pub to pub."

"O-I think my expectation where too high on this beer"
""
""

"Appearance is ""black"" though in the right lighting you can see the ruby red tinge within your glass. Great heading thanks to the nitro bubble in the can. That ""TSST"" sound when you pop it open is a beautiful sound indeed. Mouthfeel is watery, but not in an unpleasant way. Very drinkable stout with little carbonation. You may end up drinking more than you expected to drink. Taste is light with malty notes and very slight coffee and chocolate on the finish. This beer goes great with almost any food. Closest thing you'll get to having Guinness on tap."

""
""
""
""
"Guinness gets too much hate simply for being a macro. It doesn't compare to the better, thicker, more creative stouts, but it's not bad, and it's just a tiny step behind some of the lesser craft stouts. It's a very low ABV beer; a better, bigger, chewier mouthfeel would have made this beer significantly more enjoyable."

"Overall: Guinness Draught is a great beer for those who want to try a Dry Stout but are afraid of dark beers. This used to be my favorite stout before I began exploring the beer culture. I have tried numerous other Irish Dry Stouts that have surpassed Guinness. Since I have opened my eyes to new beers, Guinness has fallen as a ""run-of-the-mill"" stout. As many people have said on here, it is a typical go-to stout when nothing else is available, like at a typical restaurant."
""
""
""
"Nothing special."
"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and a solid example of the style, it's got just enough roasted flavors to fit in to the style while not being too filling and staying sessionable like it should. This beer had good drinkability, it's smooth, creamy, not too filling, and it's got just enough flavor to hold my attention till i get drunk and not care about taste anymore. I like the appearance and mouthfeel the most, to me that's one thing that sets this beer apart from other beers in the style. What I liked the least amount this beer is the taste and aroma, I think it could handle a little more roast, but I can see how people like it just how it is. I only really buy this beer for St. Patrick's day, but I will order it at a bar if there isn't anything better available. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to get into the world of dark beers, it may not be like a lot of dark beers, but it gives you a slight idea of what they are like. All in all I don't mind this beer, it's nothing that I will go out of my way to get, but when the options are low this makes for a good alternative."
""
""
""
"Overall: After a lifetime of hearing great things about Guinness, I was very disappointed with my experience. It's really just a great looking beer, but fails to be interesting in any of the other categories. It's an extremely bland and flavorless beer. Do not recommend."

""
""

"had the pleasure of enjoying a pint ( 3 actually ) at the brewery in Dublin. trust me its awesome on draught at the brewery. thick and creamy and so smooth. jet black with a off white head that stayed to the end of the glass. it seems the abv of Guinness in Ireland is a touch higher than whats available in the states also. definitely will go again if I get the chance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a solid black with a huge creamy tan head that displays and insane level of retention. Smells of roasted grains a hint of fruit and a touch of tart. The flavor mimics the aroma fairly well. Coffee like roasted grains that are quite drying with hints of fruit and tart. Light to medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick creamy mouthfeel. An old favorite that I revisited today, solid brew, a bit simple and not the fantastic beer I thought it was so long ago."

""

"I'm drinking at home in Boston. I've been trying different ways of drinking Guinness at home. I've been leaving out the cans to get to the proper room temperature and then in a glass doing a three pour to let the head properly settle. It helps but after the head it pretty much tastes like water."
""

"Overall - This used to be one of the kings of ""craft beer"" (though was it ever really considered craft, no) and I'll give it that, but this is not a great beer by any means."

"Overall - This is my favorite go-to beer and the standard I judge all other beers by. I would give this beer a 5.00 but I am holding out for that perfect beer in the hopes of one day finding it. If I do not find it, I will edit my rating to a 5.00."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Though I know that there are probably dozens of stouts better than this Irish Dry Stout, I still really enjoy a Guinness....it's an oldy, but goody..."
""
""
"It have always been a fan of stouts, therefore, my opinion will be somewhat biased. Guinness Draught is just the standard irish dry stout, you know what you are getting before buying it and it does not go better or worst. For me Guinness is like McDonalds, you know that there are better things out there but for some reason you always go back and buy Guinness because it never disappoints."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, for those of us who grew up with this beer, still a good one. Does not measure up in any way with most of the stouts out there now, but every now and then, I certainly enjoy one, and would never turn it down if offered. Still deserves some respect."

"O: It smells more flavorful then it really is. It's a great beer to have if you're barely going into stout beers but the mouthfeel is awful. This was the downfall of this beer. It's just way to watery for a stout and it just really throws you off when the appearance and the smell suggests something larger. I guess the low alcohol is the reason why it's so thin but...man...such a let down."

""
""
""

""
"Overall - Looks awesome in a glass, but when it comes to taste and mouthfeel I am disappointed. An OK stout, nothing offensive but nothing amazing either. Even with the light body and low abv, I wouldn't want to have two in a row."

"Overall: An amazing session beer, inoffensive taste attached to a highly drinkable body. Far from the best stout, but it's far from being offensive."
""
""
""
""
"O: As with many beer aficionados, this was my gateway beer. This and a handful of Irish stouts were, for the longest time, the only conception of beer that I had other than macro light lagers like Bud and Coors. Back then I thought this was head and shoulders above those light lagers. Now that I've come this far, I can see that it's really the same concept: brew a bland, uniform, inoffensive beer and rely heavily on deep pockets and marketing to spread it around the globe and make maximum profit, sacrificing quality along the way if necessary. I will go on the record as saying that I still enjoy a Guinness from time to time, and that my own personal preference would still lead me to drink a Guinness over a macro light lager. But when I look at Guinness Draught in terms of what's available and stack it up against some of the other Irish stouts on the market, craft brewed and otherwise, it falls well short of the mark."

"O - A lot of people complain that this is just a plain beer, and really light, and it's all just marketing. In a way, that's true. Guinness draught isn't a heavy, complex porter that will change your perspective of beer. But it's a good simple alternative to the other basic lagers or porters you might order with dinner, or at a cafe. It's light enough to not dominate a meal or fill you up, but it's creamy and tasty enough to be an enjoyable alternative when you want something a bit different. Either way, I'm still quite fond of this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I said there's something missing in the flavor, and I know what it is. The alcohol is so subdued it couldn't be said to exist at all. It has less ABV than a Budweiser! What are they doing here? The strong notes in the flavor are the reason stouts are usually so high in alcohol, it's balance. Either way, they're not going to see this review, you are and I'm saying it's good, but lessens the Guinness reputation significantly."

"The taste is toasty, charred malt with a back end of sweet creaminess. Problem is as good as it tastes, it's simply not tasty enough. The whole taste gets lost in a wash of watery finish and feel. The nitro seems to take away the very essence of the beer and depletes, what I always felt, was a very good stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark black color with finger width foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are very good.  Aroma is not very strong.  Slightly roasted, malty aroma.  Hints of coffee.  The taste is really watered down up front, continuing with a watered down roasted coffee taste,  Not sure if this is an out of date can (shouldn't be), but I remember Guinness being better 9it has been a while, though)."

"Overall: If every beer could look like Guinness (masterful head that just sits there), no beer drinker would ever go unhappy. However, character goes deeper than appearance and, unfortunately, Guinness isn't all that it's cracked up to be underneath the incredible looks. A watered-down, diminished taste for a beer that looks absolutely incredible. I would get this on tap if better options weren't available and may purchase in nitro-cans if hosting parties or making Poor Man's Velvets, but would not purchase in a non-nitro format. I fear that the wateriness would be all too evident in other formats."

"Enjoyed at the Guinness Factory, in Dublin, Ireland on tap. Also enjoyed at multiple bars in Ireland (Guinness Factory's was the best). This is the best beer I have ever had, hands down. It's like tasting the milk from a goddesses teats. Don't drink Guinness in the United States, it tastes like piss. Trust me, it really DOES taste different in Ireland."
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Very creamy, very nice mouthfeel, and for a moment makes you think that this beer isn't as light as it is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So in a sense this is the beer that enlightened me to the fact that American light lagers were not the only option and I've been on a quest to try as many different kinds of beers as I can since then."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Well this might be one of the worst stouts I've ever had. That's not to say this is horrible, it's ok but I'm used to stouts being rich and complex, not like this. I wouldn't have this again."
"Nothing outright unpleasant or offensive about this beer, but I have absolutely no desire to drink this again as every aspect fell short of expectations."
""
"Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours pitch black with a very fine, two finger light tan head from the nitro can. Aroma of mild toasted malt and nuts, mildly sweet. Attenuated flavor of light toasted malt, milk chocolate, nuts. Finishes very mild hops and residual malt. Light body without any creaminess I'd expect from the nice head. I enjoy an occasional actual draught Guinness, although it is mild by comparison to the stouts I usually drink, but this tastes like that Guinness slightly watered down. A pleasant Irish dry stout, but very attenuated in flavor. It was a reasonable accompaniment to dinner."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the best thing about this beer was the mouthfeel. This was helped by the surprisingly well-retained head, giving big cream and slurp throughout the entire tasting. Otherwise the nose and flavoring, while showing some positive and robust fruitiness, phenols, and char, gave too much on the metallics and the dry, chalky yeastiness. That being said, the nose was better than the flavoring, and everything else just screams “standard”."
""
"oh well. its still miles ahead of that yellow fizzy stuff."
"O - I like this but I would usually take something else if it were available. However, is very smooth and easy drinking. Good session beer given the ABV and drink-ability. For the price there are some far better stouts out there. If you want to try this one make sure you get the nitro version or on tap."

"One thing I always tell people who ask about Guinness is that when I am in the mood for 'beer', I don't drink Guinness. It has none of the flavors of what I think of in beer, whether that be wheat, hops, bitter, etc. It's something smooth and wonderful to drink."
""
""
""
""
"I had this at a restaurant, and I honestly was able to down only about the first 4 ounces before I gave up. My wife sipped it, and wouldn't have any more. My son drank maybe an ounce, made a face, and gave up. We left the restaurant with still at least 6 ounces left in the glass."
"Overall: I can't shake the feeling that this world-famous beer (probably the most famous of the stouts?) relies on a combination of marketing and its nitrogen widget for its success. Attempting to disregard the aspects that the nitrogen lends to the beer, it is actually very simple and unimpressive. It's not bad, but it just isn't good."

"On this 2014 Paddy's Day, I remember back to a year ago when I had a Guinness Draught on tap at a pub in Ireland. A small pub on the eastern side of the country far from Dublin. But this little stone pub, darkly lit with a great fireplace and not-so-great fish n' chips served me my first Guinness. Yes, that's right, never had one in the States at that point. That dark creamy rich taste and texture was amazing. And, now, sipping on a Guinness Draught bought in Kansas City, I see why people say you have to have Guinness in Ireland to appreciate it. 4.5/5 on tap in Ireland. 3.5/5 (at best) in a can in the States."

"I figured St. Patrick's Day was a good day to finally actually review this one. Poured on nitro-tap at Dugans on 3/17/13. This beer does look very nice in the glass. This is of course one of the more common introduction beers for most people to something other than a macro-lager. It looks wonderfully deep dark with reddish highlights and a very nice white frothy head developing from the creamy pour. The smell just isn't there though. After years of drinking other stouts, this beer just lacks the good nose of a stout. There's some light bread crust smell and maybe some dried grass, but it's not much. The taste, while better than a regular can or regular tap line, is still just average. It's creamy and dry finishing, but very watery overall. The body of the beer is just so wimpy after you drink other stouts. Tastes mostly of brown bread and a little of bitter, dry hops. Not a terrible beer, but not great."

"Not impressed. This is the prototypical Irish beer, and I'm sad for Ireland because of it."
"Pretty average. Not a lot of flavor. I prefer Murphy's to Guinness."

"Two Words: Non-Descript Staple"
""
""
"Poured a 14.9 oz. can into an Imperial Pint glass. Deep, deep brown (not quite black) with a thick cappuccino-colored head that last throughout and leaves big lacing on the glass. Aroma has hints of roasted malt (some coffee, but not much) and a little nondescript sweetness. Taste is about the same and the nitro can provides a velvety-smooth mouthfeel. I'll say this is not the best way to have Guinness and that the best I've ever had was in Dublin, both at the brewery and the numerous pubs throughout the town."

"Love this beer. It is the standard for all stouts,imports, Irish beers and any type of beer for that matter. This is a very good beer for upcoming events such as Saint Patricks Day!"
""
""

""
""
"Overall: This is essentially the only macro beer I ever consider buying. Unfortunately that's about the biggest compliment I can give it....In all fairness though, it's not a bad beer when all's said and done, and on certain occasions I just can't help drinking a few (cough, St. Patrick's Day)."

"O: great legacy beer. Simple stout. Its a gateway stout. It was for me. It could be alot better but its not bad. I gotta give this one fairly high ratings. Its a respectable brew. It leads many to better stouts and compared to other mass produces beers this is the top brew. Cheers"
"Dark appearance. Flavors are very faint and muted, but what is there is pleasant. Mild coffee and chocolate flavors make up a very thin and watery body. Reminiscent of Folgers Instant Coffee. A bare-bones Irish Stout. Lies somewhere between not bad and almost good."

""
""
""

"Overall a fairly simple drink that you have all of a sudden had 4 or 5 of...not too bad at all."
"It's a typical pure black with a smallish head and light lacing. The aroma is faint but nice. The taste is mild and creamy and the finish is the same. It's like the ones I've had with the widget but not as good. I am enjoying my Irish Saturday!"

"This is not a session beer by any means, but every once in awhile I'll get a craving for the unique experience Guinness provides, much preferring their Extra Stout, and the Draught is a perfect companion for a thick burger or heavy chili. A beer everyone should try at least once. Cheers!"

"Ahh…a “Pint of Plain,” the Workman’s Friend, a Guinness Draught, a living piece of history directly from dear old Ireland, supposedly anyway. I like Guinness for what is, not for what I want it to be, and that’s enough for me. Guinness is now a mass produced mega-brew, and the reality is that it’s not much better than any other brew produced on that scale. Initially, it pours dark with a nice creamy head that disappears soon enough. The first sip tastes of roasted malted barley, but as your taste buds adapt to the smoky, dark flavor it has a refreshing but watery taste. It is a porter in name only, and much closer in taste to a dark lager such as “Michelob Dark” (although smoother than more drinkable). I’m not necessarily a beer snob, but a modern Guinness Draught is no match for a quality micro-brewed porter. You won’t have to twist my arm too hard to get me to drink one, but this beer is nothing special."
""
""
""
"O- Looks great! no substance whatsoever"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I truly appreciate the fullness of this beer. It has a great taste and a welcoming follow. I would be happy to have this at my home. Do not be afraid of its dark color or its thick nature, she will be one of the best dark stouts you will ingest. I am amazed to say that its tastes good also in can or bottle form, although I do prefer it by the pint off the tap."
""
""
"O- Very watery and light stout with no real outstanding smell or flavor. It looks nice though."

"O: Not very impressed. It just kinda sits there, hoping for a charge of real stoutness."

"O - good into fro people into dark beers, and often saves me from not having beer at a bar, but does leave more to be desired from a stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - For as long as I could remember, Guinness Draught has been one of my favorite beers, and finally getting to have it on tap poured in the CORRECT manner is just incredible, it just tastes so much different than the canned Guinness or the bottled Guinness or Guinness just sloshed into a glass by an inexperienced beer pourer. Long live Guinness!"
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a glass mug. Pours black with a thin, white head. There is some lacing left on the side of the glass by the head, which is retained well during consumption. The beer has the aroma of sweet and dark roasted malts and some coffee. The taste follows the nose and has the familiar flavors of Guinness in a more watery form. The roastiness is forward with some mild malt sweetness. The coffee notes blend well with the dark roasted malts. The body is light to medium with a creamy mouthfeel provided by the nitro widget. This is a highly drinkable and very sessionable stout. This is an excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Nothing astounding and there is definitely better in the stout department but I like it. I drink it from time to time. Its a little bit over hyped but its still pretty decent for a macro stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes similarly weak, roasted barley and cardboard, folgers, vague ashy note in the aftertaste. Watery feel, bland with a lower level of carbonation. Seems to be a mere shell of its former self, or maybe the added nitrogen adds something, and without it there's just not much substance."
""
"O: if I had to pick one beer to drink for the rest of my life this would be it, it has a nourishing yet refreshing quality, it's lower in calories than most ""light"" beers yet is packed with flavor, it's low alcohol content means you can have a couple without getting swimmy, it is the perfect representation of a dry Irish stout"
""
""
""
"This is poured from a 33cl bottle into a Guinness mug, coded bottled date. This pours a nice black color with a large foamy mocha colored head (far larger than I'm used to on nitro bottles, perhaps this is due to removing the nitro widget). This has an extremely long retention time and leaves a lacing everywhere it touches. The smells are of dark roasted malts and a hint of the Guinness burnt smells. The feel is medium to thick and creamy. More warm this is better, the taste is light but smooth and easy to drink, you get the dark roasted malts, and a little burnt malt bitterness, more subtle than the traditional guinness. Not the greatest beer in the world but a great session one and I often order it with my meal."

"Been a while since I could find this type of Guinness in a NON nitro bottle!Bottle has coding ,no readable date . 11.2 fl. oz. Brewed in Dublin. Nice creamy malt aroma. Deep dark body with full long lasting beige head. Appearance is not as fulsome as the nitro version, no discernable ""fall"". Taste is flatter as well, but still very pleasing to the palate."
"Overall: All in all, Guinness is a pretty standard stout that benefits from a good reputation, history, and marketing team. I prefer the Extra Stout to the Draught version, but there's still nothing really wrong with this one either."

""
"Pours pitch black with a thick, very fine, tan head. Good retention and lacing. Smell is almost nonexistent, very light malt notes. Taste is slightly bitter from the malt character, not much too it, slightly alcoholic in the finish. Medium carbonation, light body for a stout. Mouthfeel is watery. Overall, not my favorite by far. There just is not much to this beer, and it does not fit well into the style."

""
"O: this makes me remember why Forign Extra and plain old Extra Stout have made me jaded and won't get Guinness on tap unless I am in a crappy bar where my options are Budweiser or Guinness. all in all I am left wanting but you know, one of the best macros I know of."

"Reviewing beers on this site is surely subjective, but when it comes to rating a beer, it should be based on its merits compared to other beers of the same style. Hands down, this is the BEST Irish Dry Stout from draft on the planet! This is the benchmark. No questions asked. I’d highly encourage people to remember that when they are reviewing this beer. I understand the bottle and canned version of this can vary greatly while a non-Irish tap will not taste as good; however, if you ever have the chance to enjoy a pint of this from a pub in Dublin, rest assured, you will not be disappointed. If you find another Irish Dry Stout that is more enjoyable, please send me a bottle or message with the name and I’d love to try it. Until I find one that is better, I’ll keep going back to this beautiful creation every time I need a quick reminder of what started my love and enjoyment for craft beer. Cheers Arthur and here’s to another 253 years of the beautiful black stuff!"

"I just returned from spending 10 days in Ireland and have to say the imported Guinness I just picked up tonight in bottles is way different from what I had on tap while in Ireland. I've had a few Guinness' over the years, but had to pick up a 12 pack after returning home to judge the difference. Overall, the appearance, smell, and taste is no comparison to the outstanding Guiness on tap so I am slightly biased. It's pretty much a staple in every pub, but for the imported bottles used for this review make it just an OK beer. The head is much smaller and the smell and taste is just average."

"Looked great with an awesome creamy head. Beat lacing imaginable. However that's where the goodness ends. Like most mainstream import beers I feel Guinness has toned.down it's flavor to appealto Amercan beer drinkers. The smell was absent and the taste was barely there. Watery with only a hint of roasted cocoa. I will never drink this beer in the US again."
""

"Note: the Guinness recipe outside of Ireland is different for each region of the world. The Foreign Extra for Africa is another favorite."

"Sub-Decent beer at best. Pours a nice dark black with a thick tan head. About the only appealing thing about this beer. The smell is of water and very faint coffee beans. The taste pretty much follows the smell. Imagine dropping two coffee beans into a gallon of water and you've pretty much got the taste of this brew down. The mouthfeel is nothing but water, With an even lesser extent of the coffee coming through. Overall I was extremely disappointed in this beer. This is not a stout in any way shape or form. It's 9 parts water and 1 part light coffee."

"330ml bottle. Murphy´s Pint glass. (also suggested straight from the bottle).Enjoyed on sep´11. Dark mahogany. Beige, medium size bubbled, thick layer head. Lasting crown ´til the end.

Dry bitter coffee finish & aftertaste."

"Finally got to try this on nitro-tap, but I have to say that even that was disappointing. Why this pub draught stuff has surpassed the regular extra stout in popularity is beyond me, because there's no comparison in my view. Even on nitro, it was equally unimpressive, other than the look and the lasting, creamy head. But the body was still watery and the finish disappointing. Taste hadn't changed, the usual suspects for a dry stout, coffee, roasty, a bit nutty perhaps. Stick with the regular extra stout or the foreign export stout."

"Overall - Well.. I hate coffee but I'm not gonna penalize the beer because of that. I know this is good for what it's supposed to be."
""
"A simple, Humpty-Dumpty Irish Dry Stout with loads of character, but not many can explain why. A beer to drink and enjoy drinking for those who don't give two hoots about the style or the historical butchering of the recipe over the years. A beer to scoff at for those who have had better dry stouts. Tough to love for those who have had North Coast Old #38, Victory Donnybrook, Beamish, or Murphy's. Tough love is God's love, I suppose. And, for a man who has had all of the aforementioned brews, I can only exclaim ""My Goodness, My Guinness!"". C'mon, if you don't know what this is, you've got no business venturing off into the better options out there. Guinness IS Irish Dry Stout. Guinness IS the import on nitro. Guinness IS a classic. But, the truth is, Guinness is nothing special, and certainly not worth the $5 a pint some bars charge. It's a one-and-done-and-thank-you with a smile, or a fall-back and nothing else. When in doubt, have a Guinness. 3.5"

"Poured a dark color with a creamy head which looks like a big cinnamon colored marshmellow.. Not much going on in terms of smell. Microscopic hints of chocolate. A small hint of malts and thats about it.. Taste was very blan. Some malts and a weak hint of chocolate and coffee. Mouthfeel was the closest beer there is compared to water. Its very smooth and easy to drink. This beer. Oily mouthfeel afterwards. For some reason I believe this beer is definately made more for the average drinker so in that perspective it is not a bad beer. I am not a fan, but I was not let down. Will I buy this in a 4 pack, or even single? Naa. Will I drink it if a buddy offers it? Definately."
"plastic cup full of foam eventually settles into a dark brown body with ruby highlights. a coating of foam is left all the way down the glass.nose and taste are pretty similiar. some roasted malts and a lactic smell and taste. mouthfeel is slightly light and creamy. overly carbonated. not a bad stout, but there are plenty better ones out there. i will still order this when there is nothing else but bmc."

"Overall a terrible brew. I had a debate with my friends if MGD was better which is sad. I don't see what Guinness is getting at here. I was thinking beer for the masses but this was just like a soda water. I wish I had ordered a San Pelligrino instead."

"Guinness is the benchmark for the Irish dry stout style and shouldn't be compared to a Russian imperial...that should be obvious enough but some of the reviews here give me pause. I don't love this beer but it is what it is and the style as a whole isn't particularly full-flavored or exciting."

"O: THE session stout that everyone claims is so thick and a ""meal in itself."" Well, good people, these are all just myths. There's a reason why Irish people drink these all day...because they can. They have a low ABV, the same as Miller Lite and are highly drinkable although very bland in flavor."

"Nothing has the flat black appearance of Guinness on tap! Nothing drinks better in the morning!, try it. Always a classic like Budweiser to a bum Guinness will always be one of the staples of a dark beer drinking bum? With that said enjoy!, when on Tap, especially if the other choices are bud, bud light, coors light, shock top, blue moon, sam adams, Heineken, new castle and Stella.... Guinness Please!"

"O- I tried to review this like it was my first time having it although I've had many before. I actually used to hate this beer in my younger age but, now that I respect all styles, I enjoy it whenever it's the only good thing on tap at whatever bar with lame selection I happen to patron. That said, my only qualm with it is that it's a bit low of an ABV for a beer with so much flavor. Basically, the appearance and mouthfeel are the main attraction IMO."

"Overall, not sure if I poured it correctly, but I was expecting a little more head, and aroma from a world-class brand. Have had much better microbrew stouts in my opinion, but I will keep trying it when available to see if I can't grow more of a liking to it."
""

"M - If not for anything else, I love this beer because of the incredibly smoothness and drinkability (especially with the nitro cans/bottles). A little thin for my taste, but again, any thicker and it just wouldn't be Guinness. Ultra fine bubbles of carbonation dance off the tongue, but it doesn't get in the way of the already delicate flavor (I say ""delicate"" in reference to most American craft breweries' stouts). Finish is silky smooth with a hint of stickiness."
""
""
""
"Overall - A nice flavorful Stout that is much more palletable for beginner stout drinkers than the ""Extra"" which is more bitter and hoppy."
"Overall: Guinness brew fantastic stout in Guinness Extra Stout and Guinness Foreign Extra Stout, yet this particular brew was unstimulating and not at all exciting for me. Its presentation and drinkability are probably what keeps this stuff flowing in the bars, but for a great tasting Irish Stout I would certainly recommend trying one of their other brews above. Otherwise, Beamish and Murphy's are both popular brands to find on tap and either would appeal to me more."
""
""
""
"O: I like it better on draft. For a mass produced beer its a great change of pace. Remarkable consitent and apperance is pretty awesome. Good beer to use to get macro drinkers to change it up. Ill have some every St Pattys. Great + A Smitwicks for a Black n Tan, or make 2 carbombs for yourself and a buddy."
""
""
"This pairs well with beef dishes & stews. It isn't my favorite stout, but it is a decent drink."
""
"O - Horrible, takes any redeeming qualities of the Guinness brand and made it watery."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a very average stout. This is one I can almost always count on any bar having and is never bad. Also great when you don't want anything to overpowering but still want the stout experience. I feel like guinness could really add some more flavor and maybe less water and this one would be significantly better."
""
"O - Guinness is good for you. Sláinte."
"Sláinte!"

""
""
"Overall, this is a classic stout, and it's very smooth and enjoyable. The low ABV is a delight. Don't let the low reviews of the draught pub can fool you -- this beer on tap in Ireland is absolutely fantastic. Great session beer."
""
""
""
""
"O-I'll stick to this when its on tap"
""
"O-I think the look of guinness is what makes it appetizing. The beer itself isn't that great, but it draws you in with the appearance"

"Very dark brown with glints of red. Very creamy foam head that causes this beer to be picture perfect. However, this beer is so thin, flat, and burnt that I've wondered for years what people are possessed by when they choose to spend their money on this poor excuse for a stout. One advantage is it's drinkability. I've often likened it to water into which someone spilled their ashtray, but, water nonetheless. Hence, easy-drinking. I'd like to think that any self-respecting beer enthusiast wouldn't be caught in the darkest corner of the most obscure bar drinking this swill. I'm quite disappointed in my Irish half. Having been to the Guiness brewery and virtually every pub, large and small, around the coastal areas of Ireland, I know that Guiness isn't just some garbage made popular by American advertising like Samuel Adams was--the Irish really have a lot of pride in this so called stout. But, just to put things into context, Miller Genuine Draft and Budweisier was one Euro more per pint than Guiness at every pub in which I had the honor to visit. That speaks to me. You make you're own judgement. Felt obligated to drink it on St. Patrick's Day. Otherwise, you'd never have seen this review."
""
""
""

"o: better on tap than out of the can, but regardless, for the price, this is an overrated beer. there are far better irish dry stouts available. i'm willing to drink this at a bar that serves BMC and Guinness, but never something I would go out of the way for."
""
""
"O: I like this and prefer it on tap. The nitro can is no comparison to the tap version. Sure its no RIS but its still a classic. Slainte!"
"i was hesistant to review Guinness without the widget. i felt it wouldn't be an accurate representation of the beer, this 'experiment', which has left the Guinness bottles without their now familiar 'widgets'. although, after reviewing it, i realize looking back it will be more unique, perhaps a time where ""to widget, or not to widget?"" was indeed a the question. could these little guys be no more? who knows. all i know is i totally realized how much i had been playing hard to get with my love for this beer. it really is all you could ask for in a brew. a nectar of the gods."

""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O: Guinness kills you with looks and with the price you pay for it on tap. Doesn't live up to the hype generated by the die hard Guinness fans and average beer drinkers."
""
""
""
""
"I know its watery, but its still good. Very roasted malt is the first thing that comes to mind. Very light body. If this were brewed in the US, it would be an American Black Ale/Schwarzbier. Clean finish that leads to a slightly chewy malt. Those roasted malts are the facade that fades into a soapy feeling."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: It's a commonly available stout that's not ridiculously priced. Very average, but it's a beer that I would love to enjoy every once in a while."

"Sometimes I feel like having slightly more coffee grounds bitterness in my stout, and that is when I have a Murphy's. When I want more emphasis on the sweetness of a roasted malt, I drink a Guinness. Admittedly, it seems as though Guinness has been nerfed as of lately in the US, it doesn't have quite as bold an aroma or flavor as I remember it having in my college days. Well, either that or nostalgia is playing tricks with my memories, I'm not really sure."
""
""
""
"Overall: Biggest Irish dry stout out there. Just wish it was a little less costly. Draught is what turned me onto Beer, not knowing anything of the craft brewing culture. One of Guinness' lower rated stouts but overall a great memory."
""
""
"Its black, and very frothy. A more subtle malt flavor then it used to be it seems. Hard to stop drinking it though once you start. It goes down so smooth the 14.9 ounces is gone before you realize it."

"nitro bottle into a pint glass. Deep amber with purple on the edges, minimal tan head with little retnetion. Nose is bland, maybe some light roast. Taste is black coffee roastiness with slight very faint flower. A bit of chalk. Mouth is light bodied and deffiantly sessionable. Overall, not completly horrific when confronted with only BMC competitors."
""
""
""
"This beer is an Irish dry Stout, and in my opinion one of the best in the market. The smell was a mix of malt and barley, texture and mouth feel was slightly watery, but overall smooth in texture. This beer retains a full head on the glass when poured."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I thank you Guinness, I was first introduced this back in high school in the late 90's and will never forget my first glass. This beer is smooth and easy to love, but compared to what else is out on the market it is mediocre at best, but compared to who makes a better ""Irish Dry Stout"" don't bother looking else where. Salud!"
""
""
"I think this beer was average. The taste was not bad, but it was nothing amazing. It tasted watery and did not have a big mouthfeel. It has a nice, very dark color with a medium head. There was not a strong smell compared to something you would get with a lot of hops in it. It also has a strong hold on the glass. This beer is an ""easy drinking"" beer."
""
""
"The color is a creamy and dark chocolatey color. The aroma is of a roasty coffee. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light, like drinking water almost. You would think that because it is so dark it would be thick like a porter but it is not. It is creamy with a nice strong head on it."
"Watery with no had to get the phones still sensitive Toppenish Euporia up the phone disappears and you can see the dark color of the beer has a soya sauce the Maltese smell too late and taste kind of Carmalee maybe even a little chocolate he smells cream mean the head is as well very creamy hence the term water and is that a stronghold on the glass even know what is water"

"O - this is a beautiful looking beer with its head retention and its tan cascade immediately after the pour. The flavors are a little bland, could be much richer. Very light and smooth, drinkable stout, but the flavor is just too bland. The iron aftertaste is a little strange, but definitely gives a little logic to the old myth of Guinness being a good iron supplement for pregnant women! Not a good idea, ha."

""
""
""
"Got to review this classic! The appearance is great, dark ruby red with a cascading effect, topped with a creamy white head. Great white lacing. Smell is minimal, maybe some roasty coffee and chocolate. Taste is of watery chocolate, grains. The mouthfeel is probably the best part of this beer, extremely smooth and creamy. Not too bad for a nitro-stout, but I'd prefer a Murphy's any day."

"O - This one's a classic. Nothing is spectacular about the taste or the smell, but the appearance and mouthfeel are very satisfying."
""
""
"O: A standard, a classic. I can't say anything bad about this beer. It is one of the first ""craft"" beers that I started with. Since, I would say that my palate has evolved a bit, but this is still a nice beer to drink. I would never turn down a Guinness, either by the 12 fl oz bottle or by the yard, but nos always makes this beer better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't care what you say. I love a good nitro tapped Guinness. It was the first beer I've ever had and probably the beer that turned me on to craft beer. Its black with a thick creamy head. Doesn't smell like much, but there are hints of smokiness detectable. Tastes chocolatey and roastey and a little nutty and it's very silky. Perfect with some wings or pizza or as a session beer at a crappy bar with tons of miller and coors products available."
""
""
"Overall this was o.k. Glad we have this as an option in Mississippi but definitely not my favorite."
"Overall not too impressive. Hard to compare this to the draft version and not as good as many American craft brewed examples of the style."

"The beer poured up dark with a nice looking head, full of promise. After admiring the beer, I took a sip, and was immediately disappointed. Maybe it was because I was thinking it would be like the other stouts I've tried, but, it just tasted weak and watered down. Not quite what I was expecting. Unfortunately, this beer was a disappointment."
"This beer isn't very good. I never buy it and I am glad my brother enjoys these buys I never buy because I can steal a bottle and give it a review. It is nice and light and refreshing though."

"the orignal and most famous for a reason. this is the original dry irish stout. pours nearly black, thick, frothy mocha head. smells roasty and smooth, ever slight milk chocolate characteristics. tastes great, creamy and a little bitter at the finish. full bodied but so smooth and low alcohol that you can easily drink it all day. not the best stout in the world, not even close, but when you are at a pub and the choices are bud, bud light, heineken, and guinness, its the only choice. also nice on a hangover"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was expecting a good stout as I've drunken in England but this Guinness was very disappointing. The nitro-can creates a nice creamy head, but once I forgot the appearance nothing is worth buying this stout. Just one word: Watery! Not tasty at all, just pass your way if you're looking for a good malty stout!"

"Overall I am shocked how little the overall flavor in this to get a B+ but assume that it's pretty light flavors and thin watery body that make it such a world wide stout. I personally will only pick up the extra stout or foreign extra stout from now on."
"M - Medium bodied, loved the low carbonation was extremely smooth and refreshing."

"This beer pours a dark brown color with some ruby hues. There is a big creamy 2-finger off-white head resting on top. The head has incredible retention, and it leaves behind a big coating of lace on the glass. The nose is pretty light. There are some weak notes of chocolate and coffee, as well as some nuttiness. There really isn't much going on here. The taste starts off with some light roasted malts, and some faint notes of black coffee and a touch of chocolate. There is some burnt bitterness and a bit of a metallic taste. This is just a pretty weak flavor overall. This has a pretty light body, especially for a stout, and creamy carbonation. There is some bitterness and some sweetness as well. I think the creamy layer of foam on top is the only thing that saved the mouthfeel. The drinkability here isn't so good. It goes down really easy, but it is definitely lacking in the taste and smell. There just isn't much going on, and the flavors and aromas seem quite muted. I really just expect a whole lot more in a stout. This beer just really isn't worth the money. You can get a much better 6-pack of a nice craft stout for the same amount of money. I recommend going the second route."

"O: One of the most commonly seen beers in existence. Often the best you can get on a less well-assorted pub given you like stout."
"Nobody is ever going to confuse this one with Darkness or Dark Lord, but at the end of the day, I wager many of those same fans of the big boys of stouts started their love affair with this one. I for one can say I was one of those people."
""
""
"Overall, the king of the dry stout in my opinion... but only when served here in it's homeland. The nitro-can-crap they serve in the US? Forget it... for example, should Sierra Nevada ever start exporting to Europe, you can bet I'd pass it by every time - the pasteurization really kills the beer. If you're fortunate enough to try one here... its really another beer, entirely, and quite a good one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an okay beer. I say that because the Guinness Extra Stout is one of my favorite beers of all time and I love that one so much that I cannot give the draught the best review because it seems like a beer with half the character of the imported extra stout. It is nice though. If you are one who is not into stouts or coffee/chocolate beers like the extra stout, this is definitely for you. If you are getting into the stouts, TRY THIS FIRST. if you like this, then get into the darker stronger more coffee-ish and chocolaty beers. I probably will not drink this again when I can drink the amazing Guinness Imported Extra Stout."

"O: It was the best choice where I was, but that doesn't make it great. Might drink it again if it was the best choice, but then again, I might just go water."
""
"Overall: You've got to respect it for being better than the garbage that is usually available, but Guinness is no great stout. Its just weak and lazy. I did an experiment with Guinness a while ago and that can be seen here: http://beeradvocate.com/forum/read/3601215. Otherwise, Guinness is, for now, most of our 'only other option beer'. It is what it is."
""
""
""
"The flavors are also light watery roasted malts primarily, the body of this beer is disappointing compared to the nitro version, which adds some creaminess and body to help it out. there really is no favorable characteristics to this version, only drink the nitro version."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, you get what you expect, and I guess there's nothing wrong with that."
"Sampled on November 8, 2011. The pour is a well carbonated dark amber to brown with a generous, long-lasting foamy head. Aroma of nutty malts and molasses. The body falls into the light to medium range but it stays together while swirling. The taste is sweetly malted and dryly hopped. I have had this in the nitro can and the bottle and I think I prefer it from the nitro can. One thing that you can say is that it is always the same no matter when or where you buy it and there is something to be said for consistancy."
"O - Everyone says it's like drinking a loaf of bread, and I used to be one of them. That was before I got into the heavier RIS's that I;e fallen in love with. A nice beer to order at an Irish pub, but I wouldn't go out of my way to try this one again."
"Overall, this stout will do in a pinch, but not in my top 10."
"O- Back before I discovered craft beer Guiness was craft beer. Though this doesn't stack up to other mighty stouts of the style, it's still easy drinking and decent. If I catch myself in local dive watering holes this is what I'll order."
"O - i like this a lot more on tap when its done right. still when my dad comes over and i've to get him some guinness i have no issues finishing off whatever cans are left behind."
"Serving type: bottle"
"O: What can I say, I love a good Guinness. As much as I enjoy the bottled variety, I've had enough of this on tap to know it's even better live. It's a masterpiece through and through, and I will continue to enjoy it as long as the world turns. In fact, if the world does stop turning, I'll probably choose a Guinness to see the world off with."
"What can you say. The creamy head and lacing that covers my entire glass is the king of suds. Nose has a nutlike scent and taste is burnt. Carbonation is absent. If it had more bubbles I call it the best import session beer. A nice treat but wouldn't keep it in the fridge."
"O- Love me some Foreign Export Stout....this guy, not so much."
"O- I like it and it's cheap and drinkable but obviously doesn't stand up to any real stouts from Founders, Victory or Bell's just to name a few"
"o - cheap and easy to drink. actually pairs quite nicely with a lot of ""black and ___"" combinations that i've had (black and white (allagash), blaxter (guinness on baxter pale), etc.)"
"o - goes down easy, but not particularly enjoyable. not bad for cheap, but not any kind of ""standard"" either."
"O- a beer that will never blow me away, but will never dissapoint either."
"Very good actually. One I will definitely drink again and again."
"Overall: This was a pretty good beer. The taste was my favorite part. The scent was pretty good, but needs to be a bit stronger. A heavier mouthfeel would make this beer seem bolder and more substantial. Overall though I'm happy I tried it. I'll probably buy it again. It's certainly worth a try."
"This version of Guinness is thin but drinkable."
"Taste is little to none this one has a better feel than taste. It has a creamy smooth mouth feel reminiscent of chocolate. Taste is almost watery followed by a slight creamy malt finishing dry with bitter herb notes."
"D- This is a fairly mild stout (in both alcohol and flavor) but I'd happily have a few and be amazed with the beauty of the pour every time."
"Overalll: Guinness is simply a 5-Star brew that I'll likely never say no to. I order one at least one any night I go out drinking. I've heard the North American Guinness is inferior to the genuine Irish product, and that what we get is actually Guinness ""Essence"" that is mixed somehow with inferior base ingredients. Even assuming this is true, we have not gotten the shaft. Guinness on draft is still the beer to beat. However I don't care for it as much in canned form, the beer is dependent on the proper pour."
"It's not surprising that a run-of-the-mill product like this fail to impress. Although it pours rich and creamy with a nice off white head, the rest of the experience leaves much to be desired. No smell noted, with a very thin feel that reminds me of drinking a standard American light beer. If not for the appearance, you might as well be drinking Coors Light or Bud light. It's pretty tough to taste the difference, although the mouthfeel is slightly creamier if you really concentrate. Overall, I'd drink this over a standard light beer but it's in the same ballpark. Pretty shabby."
"I've had Guiness before from sipping other people's beers, but I finally had the chance to have a full glass of my own. What a disappointment! I would compare this beer to being the Budweiser or Bud Light of ""regular"" beers, except for stouts. It is very uncomplex, no hoppiness, and tastes fairly close to water. Mind you, I did have this in the U.S. and I hear it tastes different across the pond. I just didn't expect such a lack of flavor!!"
"O: Smooth refreshing Dry stout with a very predictable taste."
"O: I know on this site this beer doesnt get great reviews, but man it is very tasty to me. I find it to be easy to drink, tasty and easy to find. This isnt the best stout on the market at all, but this is a nice beer."
"O: Overall an OK beer."
"Overall: A decent session beer for the mild stout lovers. I could easily have a half a dozen of these in a sitting without worrying about the ABV since it is so low. I would much rather have a Guinness before any of the other mass-marketed light beers out there."
"All in all, if you don't want Budweiser, or Coors Light, or Miller Lite, this is definitely a welcome beer."
"O: Sessionable to an extent. A good choice at a bar that doesn't have anything other than B/C/AB"
"I'm not sure which has changed, me or this beer, but its probably both. My fond memories of this brew don't draw it in such a bland and watery light. I'm really disappointed this took such a nose dive in the quality department, but I suppose its good to have at bars that have no better options."
"The last bad beer I tried is Budweiser, King of Beer; although bad, I can still manage to finish the whole can. This guinness is definitely not something I want to even touch in the future."
"O: a classic and iconic beer that doesn't seem as great once your palate developes a bit, there are many better irish dry stouts but still not a bad dry stout."
"D - A classic. Always good, but probably could have been served a bit better tonight. When everything else on tap is fizzy and yellow, I know what I'm getting."
"Pours black w/ chocolate head that quickly goes away. Minimal carbonation and lacing. Guinness Draught smells fairly thin, w/ roasted malt, a hint of chocolate and bitter coffee. Taste is even thinner, w/ the same flavor as the nose profile. Mouthfeel is super thin, and probably the weakest part of this beer. Pretty dry as well. Overall, I can't recommend this beer to anyway, lots of better options out there for the style. Cheers."
"I'm not a huge fan of this classic. I like the other stout offerings from Guinness better."
"O: This is a decent representation of the style. It is better on tap then from the can. Not my first choice of brew for this style, but it is somewhat enjoyable in a pinch."
"This baby just begs for a nose and flavor that matches the imposing and impressive look of the beer. Without any back bone, at best, it’s a beer you could turn to after you’ve had some of the stouts that are worthy of the reverence that Guiness wishes it deserved."
"O: When Guinness is fresh on tap it is ""spot-on"" as they say. It is an original to which all others are compared to. Common in most pubs in England."
"You really need to have a particular craving and style to enjoy this. It sees like a beer that many people either love or hate. I am on the fence and would probably only order it on St. Patrick's day. The taste just seems somewhat boring to me and not very great. Regardless, the beer is one of the best went it comes to appearance. The name, color, and head give it a very distinguishing look that makes drinkers look sophisticated. The appearance and name is the only reason why I would ever drink it."
"O: The quiticential stout. Honestly, this is great out of the nitrogenated can. I was really skeptical that it wouldnt be like the real draft, but it is just like im sitting in my local favorite bar, except im at home, in my underwear"
"Final Grade: 3.08, a C+."
"The beer pours a dark brown to black color with a tan head. The aroma is dry, light roasted malt and chocolate. The flavor is roasted malt and some chocolate, as well as a little bit of dark fruit. The mouthfeel is where I really have a problem with the beer. I am not a fan of nitro beers, which almost always taste watered down to me. The mouthfeel is thin to medium."
"O- Guinness is a great stout for those willing to try a heavier beer than they would normally enjoy. Not too harsh, not a ton of alcohol, just a smooth, easy drinking stout w/ a cool nitro cartridge in the can for extra head. I recommend it."
"overall i know my scores suggest i like this beer, but i dont think i do. i buy and drink it because everyone i know likes this beer. i think its light. a stout should not be sessionable. thats just my opinion. and what is more sessionable than 4.2% abv? i say a stout should be a meal in a glass. the old liquid bread. this is not liquid bread."
"O - I dont know why Guinness Draught gets such bad reviews. Maybe because there are many great craft brewers in this day and time. Guinness is everywhere and most of the ""great"" brewers arent as readily available. I'm not sure, but Guinness is a solid brew. I drink it on a the regular here, and when I travel to the U.K. Sure there are better, but Guinnes always brings a lovely experience ;) Plus you can get it literally anywhere"
"Pours very dark with nice head, tastes like roasted coffee and malts. Very creamy and smooth and hardly any carbonation, filling... almost like drinking a liquid meal. Not bad at all, but I'm not a big fan of nitrogenated brews and this one just comes off a bit dull to me."
"O - Not ones of my favorites due to the lack of flavor, I would choose it over a bud or miller but over any decent craft brew."
"What is going on with this? Maybe I got the product from Guinness Somalia instead. Barely drinkable. Air has more flavor. Water tastes better. At least water doesn't have this terrible metallic aftertaste. Probably what a dung beetle would use to wash the dust down his little throat. It's that nasty. Can has the newer big golden harp thanks to Diageo."
"Not a lot going on in the nose or taste. But hey after all it is a session beer & a dry stout. So a clear example of the style. Perhaps it lacks a little than other examples, but a good example of the style... I think."
"As far as Irish dry's go, this stuff is just ok. It does not even come close to something with flavor and texture like Guinness Extra Stout. Probably still the best draught style Irish dry out there. I think I'm just biased and like my stouts thick and robust. This beer is very easy to drink though."
"Overall: This is still my go to beer when I dont feel like spendy a bunch of money on beer. I absolutely love this piece"
"Overall, I should try this on tap and get a better experience. Not as bad as i remember, but not what I was hoping for either."
"Overall this is a very good stout, i would prefer this out of the nitro can or on draft than in the bottle just because of taste alone and you are not getting as much from the bottle in terms of ounces."
"O - I've always found Guinness on-tap to be very refreshing, it's tasty and has a nice texture to it - it's not hard to understand why it's still a popular drink worldwide."
"O: This is a solid Irish Dry Stout. It's better in the nitro can, and I prefer the Extra Stout over the Draught (would love to try the Foreign Extra someday). Not a complex beer, but very drinkable. This was the first ""dark beer"" I ever drank on a semi-regular basis. There are many stouts I would prefer, but this is a classic."
"Not what I was expecting from a Guinness beer. Would definitely pass on this beer and grab a different beer from Guinness."
"O: this is a classic. I have never really liked it much. Not a bad beer, but only good once or twice annually."
"O: This beer has very good qualities. It’s very light bodied taste mixed with the great color and rustic smell make this beer one of my favorites."
"Medium bodied with a creamy texture from the nitro. I'm usually not a fan of this characteristic because it's really artificial but it somehow works with Guinness. Again, as in the aroma, the beer is really boring and watery until it warms a bit. Too often this beer is served at 35 degrees and loses all of it's flavor. When it warms it's pretty nice with a decent amour of dry, roasted malt. Hints of chocolate, toffee, nut and caramel complimented by the creamy lactic feel/flavor. Dry finish. Not the best of the style but underrated, possibly because of it's popularity."
"Overall, a really decent stout. Nothing exceptional, but it's available at nearly every bar worth a damn...a hands-down-no-brainer alternative to the BMC that is inevitably served beside it."
"Overall this is a very good beer. I think it is best tasting on tap. I will often order this beer when out as it is one of the few regulars at multiple places I frequent on the weekends."
"Drink- When you first get into craft you have a Guinness. Its a better than average beer but one dimensional and a little bitter. Ill probably have it again. Who can say no to an irish car bomb?"
"Hadn't had a Guinness in a while and decided to give it another whirl at the bar last night. What can I say, it just seems average to me. I didn't get that rush of flavors you find with so many of the other stout offerings. I can’t believe I used to think of this beer as heavy! Well, for me I guess this beer will just stay the requirement for an Irish car bomb and not for regular consumption."
"A good choice if you're at a bar that has nothing else of note. Of all the Guinness versions I have tried, though, this is probably the less appealing. I would skip the nitro-bottle and go for a glass bottle, can or -best of all- draft."
"O: Very smooth. It goes down quite well and the relatively low ABV makes it easy to drink. I like it, but a lot of the overall grade comes from the mystique of the name..."
"D: Good for that stout mood you might get in when the craft store is closed."
"Overall: Not a special beer in terms of unusual flavors, aromas, or appearance, but it's the standard stout for a reason. A solid beer and a safe choice."
"We ate at a Irish style pub and I had to try a Guinness on tap. I'd had a can and hated it, and this was much better than the can was. Still, not something I'll seek out."
"Possibly the stout with the least roasted character I've ever tried."
"O: The first time I had a Guinness I wasn't impress, but I wasn't a beer drinker. Now, a few years and a lot of beers later, I've really come to enjoy this brew. A nice go to beer that I can have several of, and a must have at an Irish restaurant. I will definitely get this again."
"Cheers!"
"Not my first choice at a bar, but the best out of the Big Beer options. Nitro is fun."
"Not being any particular enthusiast of Irish dry stouts, I recognize that I may, on the one hand, be biased towards sweeter non-Irish stouts. On the other hand, I'm not enjoying this beer, and it certainly doesn't compare with the few other Irish dry stouts I've had. I don't recommend this beer. If you're in the mood for a Guinness, go for the Extra (Original)."
"O-Finally was able to review this beer and as I remembered it was bland."
"The body is very very light but still brings a decent amount of flavor. This beer is amazingly sessionable and will always been a decent beer to me."
"O: Not something I'm going to pound back a lot of but good when I'm in the mood."
"The body is rich, creamy and smooth. Drinkability is very nice and easy. Overall, there's a reason why this beer is almost synonymous with stout. You've had it before, go on and have one again."
"O- decent beer, nothing to write home about."
"overall, a good ""gateway beer"" for the BMC crowd, but compared to craft versions of stouts, it's bland."
"If you're going to have this beer, it better be on nitro-tap, or better yet go with the superior Extra Stout version."
"Creamy feelwith a light body. Typical from what I would expec. Overall, not bad. Guinness seems just slightly unimpressive to me. A little boring and bland but there isn't anything offensive here."
"Thanks."
"Love it, but sometimes feel like I'm slumming it when I could be drinking better stouts."
"o: not as good as the extra stout for FES"
"D - Simple yet effective, good session stout."
"overall, this is a decent stout"
"Cheers!"
"Dare I say it.... CAR BOMBS!!!"
"Overall: An easy drinking stout that is light but tasty."
"O. There are times, usually on a hot day after eight hours of hard graft, when a pint of Guinness is just what's needed to hit the spot, and it is quite easy to toss one back in short order but I wouldn't want to stay on it all night. Years ago when there weren't so many other good beers around I'd stick to Guinness for the whole session but that's not necessary any more. When there were only bland bitters and lagers on tap Guinness was a welcome pint of flavour. For an uber-mass produced beer, it's not bad, really."
"Don't be fooled by the color of this beer, it is quite light and is definitely not a ""meal in a glass"". Hell, this beer goes down so smooth and easy it makes for easy chugging (in the case of Irish car bombs). This beer is just OK, and it often leaves me wanting something with more flavor."
"It is an old time friend! It isn't for eveyone. I have only had it cold to!"
"Pretty two finger head that looks like light brown ice cream. Heavy lace, covers the side of the glass right to the end. Color is a dark brown, a 38 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is unsweetened chocolate, coffee, and malt. Taste is a real disappointment. Flavors are very light, almost nonexistent. Coffee, unsweetened chocolate, and caramel are there, but very faint. Almost like drinking watered down coffee. Mouthfeel is weak, just a step above water. Wonderful looking beer, but everything else is just...what happened. I will not even think about trying another."
"The most impressive part was the apperance."
"Overall: If it were not as flat as juice this would be a great beer, but its flatness made this almost undrinkable."
"Overall a pretty good beer in my mind. Easy to drink and not over the top. Can't complain though."
"D - One of my favorites and will definitely be remembered; classic; had this for Easter dessert and loved every sip of it; I recommend this other beer-lovers and always have this available in my fridge"
"D: High. This beer is very easy to quaffe. It's light, smooth, and with a nice roasty/creamy flavor. 4.0"
"The classic Irish stout, it's a bit overrated in my opinion. It's not a bad beer by any means and easy to drink, could throw back a couple no problem, but it's nothing to write home about. The taste is just a bit bland."
"Served at 33 degress F on a warm day this would be a decent refresher. The disappointing part is that it's clear Guinness can brew a great stout, as evidenced by the Foreign Export and Guinness 250."
"the mouthfeel is actually a little odd. big, creamy head makes you think the beer is thick and rich...but once you get past the head, it's basically like water. really interested, and i kind of don't mind it...but i know that i'd get tired of it quick."
"M & D - watery, weak, but drinkable compared to others at this ABV. There's a bit of flavor at least. Not a good stout though. Way more flavorful stouts out there."
"Overall - It's been a while since I've had a Guinness, and I found this to be a wholly disappointing experience. I felt the flavors and everything to be very weak and thin."
"O: Better to look at than to drink, but still an undeniable institution."
"As many others have said, Foreign Extra is a lot better but also a lot more expensive. Thats like reviewing a Ford Escort and saying a Mustang is better though....duh."
"Overall, the draught-can isn't bad, but it isnt quite as creamy as the tap-version and can't quite hold up to it. That being said, I feel like Guinness pretty much defines the stout style, all other beers having to distinguish themselves in some way. It's a classic. I just prefer it from the tap."
"Overall: This was my first experience actually thoroughly tasting this beer and really enjoyed it. it has a good aroma and excellent visual appeal because the head is so lacey and holds so long. The taste didn't disappoint and actually had more flavors than i thought. it went down smooth and finished strong. a very enjoyable beer."
"DO- I'm just not overly impressed with this. I know a true contender for its style. However I think the other stuff guinness has to offer ( foreign extra stout, extra stout, etc... ) has a lot more going for it then this. I have had this on tap and i will say that it makes it much better. But out of a nitro can i think this is much lacking. Now i wont say i didn't enjoy it."
"Over all taste is not this beer strong point but the crazy drinkablility is, it has just enough flavor to be satisfying and the slight creaminess works well, all in all not a bad hot weather day beer"
"D: Very light and easy-drinking, but rather bland as a result."
"Overall: This is a beer that I will drink again"
"to me a pint of guinness is a lot like sex, or pizza, even when it's bad it's still kinda good. from what ive heard, unless your in ireland you're not havin a real guinness... whatever, i'm not in ireland and i like guinness just fine. it's more about where you get your pint. Ive had good pints, ok pints, and great pints. this review is for the pint of guinness i got at the 9lb hammer in georgetown seattle. first off the pour was done right, i had to wait a minute half way through for it to settle. this pint is deep black(red hue in the light), with a cream white head two fingers thick. beautiful! 9lb pours the coldest guinness ive had, which i think makes the beers taste fresh and clean. it's creamy, smooth, smoky and balanced. sometimes there's nothing like a guinness... i will say this, i try to stay away from the cans and bottles, on tap is the only way to have to have guinness."
"O: Overall, it's not a bad beer. Decent for sure, quite drinkable, and not a bad taste, just not particularly memorable."
"Pours a beautiful, creamy, one finger head. I know this is just the work of the nitrogen, but it still looks amazing. The head is the closest to white that I have seen in a long time. And the body is pitch black, nice contrast. The head hangs in there forever as well. As for smell, I mean it smells like a Guinness, it's hard to describe because it's a one of a kind smell and flavor, I'll do my best though. The first smell you get is a sour smell, but it's not nearly as sour as the Guinness extra stout, it's very subtle and by no way off putting. The sour smell is mixed in with a sweet malty smell, maybe a tiny tiny bit of hops in there somewhere, but not much. Like I said, it's a one of a kind taste and smell, you have to have one to know what I'm talking about really, my description really doesn't describe it very well. The smell isn't amazing, because Guinness is not the most amazing beer, but it does smell good, and very smooth. The first thing I notice on the flavor is just a robust feel to the beer, that comes in before an flavor really. I know robust is a term to relate to flavor, but I'm using it with mouthfeel because I can't think of anything else to use. I can't say it's a thick mouthfeel, because it is a very thin beer on the mouth. And I also can't say that it has a robust flavor, because the flavor is very simple. But the beer does have robust characteristics, it's hard to explain, but it just fills you up with flavor and mouthfeel, even though it doesn't have much of either. :P confusing I know. The next thing I notice is just how it glides across the mouth, I mean this thing is so freaking smooth, wow. Yes, it is a little watery, and thin on the mouth, but it is so smooth. On the actual taste: yes you do get that sour flavor, but it is so small, it's hardly noticeable, and you do get a sweetness, and a malt flavor, but they are all mixed together nicely. No flavor is dominant, and no flavor is too present, which is a little disappointing that the flavors aren't more powerful, but I knew they wouldn't be coming into this. I don't really get any hops in this beer, if there are any IBU's to this beer, it's a 2 or 3. Overall, the flavor is very good, it's not impressive, but it's good, smooth, and drinkable. To come back to mouthfeel and drinkability: mouthfeel is good, but thin. Drinkability is very very very good! Overall, it's a Guinness, what else can I say, good beer, not outstanding, but good!"
"Make no mistake, as so many do, this is not a Stout to be compared with a Foreign or Extra Stout (let alone an Imperial), this is a style of beer all its own, and well worth consideration."
"O- A solid beer when I am somewhere with an almost all BMC selection. Enjoyable, but not something I will get if there is anything interesting on tap. I will usually have one on St.Patrick's Day unless Foreign Extra Stout or GL Conway's Irish Ale are available. There are a lot of things I like about this beer especially the appearance and the creaminess of the beer, but overall this beer just does not have enough depth."
" Thank you Mr. Guinness!!!"
"Guinness was my first beer, it has a very special place in my heart. It has always been my go to drink at a bar if nothing else is worthy of my time or money. I love the surge the beer has, I love how it looks like chocolate milk while pouring and fades into a very dark brownish black color. It's the smoothest texture with a very nice roasted flavor. I'll admit it's a little bit on the watery side and it's not thick at all but it still has a good quality to it for anytime of year or place."
"Guinness Draught from the 11.2 fl. oz. nitro bottle which was ""extra cold"" as instructed on the label was poured into a pint glass and yielded a enormous dense tan head that persisted for several minutes. Lacing was spectacular also. Smell was like burnt candy with some coffee notes. Taste and mouthfeel were watery and lacking in anything worthy of note. Overall, thiis is not a drinkable brew. Previously, I had this from a nitro tap and felt the same way. I thought that might have been a fluke, but now know that any version of this beer is not worthy of a serious beer drinker."
"My prediction is this: this review will not change the world in any way."
"D - Very easy to drink."
"My very first drink of a draught beer and I have to say I wasn't impressed. Appearance was quite enticing, and it poured nicely, other than the oversize head. Speaking of which, it was very creamy looking with very tiny bubbles, if any at all. The beer itself is very dark, and smells of roasted chocolate. My first drink was actually quite tasty, but every one after all i could get was the bitterness, which isn't pleasant at all. All in all, there are better stouts and draughts out there."
"Picked up a six pack for some post-St. Patrick's Day drinking. Even though I know it says drink from the bottle, I poured it into Guinness glass anyway. Dark black color with garnet highlights. Huge creamy white head. Surging carbonation. It's a good looking beer, no doubt. Smell was very mild, mostly cocoa. Taste was fairly bland. Some roasted malt, coffee notes and a hint of chocolate. But just very watered down tasting. Also, the body was very thin for a stout. An easy beer to drink due to it's mildness and low abv, but kind of boring. I would much rather prefer to have this on tap somewhere than out of a bottle again. Flavor and body seems to be better on tap."
"Overall - i wasn't Impressed. I was hoping that it could have competed with the likes of brooklyne BCS, Yeti, etc...but this one let me down. The rocket widget idea is pretty nifty at best. I guess it's a good beginning stout."
"Overall - Although not my favourite beer, it definitely is a great beer for the style. I feel like I could drink a whole bunch of these throughout the course of an evening. I'm sure I'll buy it again at some point."
"Overall: I really don't like Guinness. Extra Stout is one of my most despised beers. Budweiser may suck but at least it is neutral. Aside from the dirty feeling you get from supporting such an unethical company, it doesn't offend your palate quite so much since its pretty much water. Not so with the macro-ale that is Guinness, which is foul. However, at least they watered it down for me a little bit with Guinness Draught. Cheers!"
"Food match: Irish stew, potatoes and indeed Guinness pie goes down a treat too."
"Pours an opaque black with a 1 inch dense foamy tan head that fades to a small cap. Thick and sticky ring lacing on the drink down. Smell is not impressive with watery dark malt and stale coffee. Tastes of roasted malt and watery coffee. Very thick and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, I wouldn't drink this very often. I guess I sort of was obligated to try it on tap for St. Patrick's Day."
"Served in a shaker pint glass, the beer arrived near black with an appropriately dense cream head. The head sticks around all the way down the glass and leaves good lace. Coffee and Espresso notes fill the nose, plus a little bit of grass/moss. Lots of roasted malt and coffee flavors make up the flavor. A hint of charcoal is there too. Dry finish. The body is quite light with just the right amount of carbonation. This is the perfect social stout. I honestly prefer Murphy's over Guinness, but I'm pretty happy overall."
"O: An easily drinkable stout at 4.2%, but it isn't packed with flavor by any stretch of the imagination"
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer pours a ruby-highlighted black with a creamy, chunky, milk-chocolate colored head. The beer leaves a great lacing on the glass as the head cascades dowwn to it's final one inch standing. Creamy sweet nose, with hints of chocolate and coffee. Very subtle aromas. The beer has a subtle dark malt sweetness to it, with flavors of dark molasses and caramel, with hints of chocolate. This is quickly followed by bitterness from coffee flavors as well as a slight hop influence. Creamy in mouth, with a smooth body. Very slight coffee and chocolate flavors on the aftertaste, with a rather quick finish. Very drinkable, and very easy to drink ""en masse."""
"D - I don't drink a lot of this stuff because it is a little boring. It pours beautifully but that's the highlight."
"Note: I also had this on nitro-tap at The Wellington in Dublin, Ireland on 6/21/14 and the beer didn't seem nearly as as dry and also seemed to be a little sweeter compared to the version exported to the United States."
"D- 4 Despite its shortcomings, Guinness is a faithful choice at many an otherwise limited selection bar and retailer. It is a very drinkable stout and there is a reason it has been around as long as it has. It is a must-try for all beer drinkers young and old. I'm sure I'll encounter it much more in the future and I'll welcome it as I know I will be getting a consistently satisfying product."
"Pours out a blackish color with a tan head. Does that weird but neat cascade thing, suppose that is worth some points there. Smells faintly smokey and mildly astringent. Taste is smokey, mildly bitter tobacco leaf, some very faint flat beer flavors likely from pasteurization. Jeez, why pasteurize? Anyway, that in fact is probably what kills this beer in the flavor department, but I admit it is still quite smooooth and creamy. Anyway, not a hugely inspiring brew but could go well with a pub burger, or better in yet, in my corn beef recipe."
"Guinness is really nothing special but with great marketing it connects the world to Ireland. It is definitely not one of those beers that when I enter an establishment I wonder if it is going to be available."
"Overall, this isn't the best of stouts, but it looks good and is easy to drink."
"Easy to drink when the foam lowers, and its much better on tap."
"I've nothing to add to the other ""F" reviews other than to say this swill is total crap, a waste of money and a blight on the name of Guinness."
" Easy to drink but is in a category in which some of the best don't typically tread in the territory of awesome drinkability."
"D-well as far as common beers go, this is about as drinkable as it gets. it doesn't go down extremely quickly, but i could drink this all night long."
"Guinness is a beer that I can definitely drink a ton of in a sitting, but the nitro-can is probably the worst way of serving it. The beer seems to be lighter in color for some reason, and just doesn't have the smoothness and mouth feel of getting out of a tap. It still has nice lace on the side of my glass, but I have yet to pour a Guinness that doesn't Over all this is an average beer in a sup bar container. I'll be sticking to tap from now on, or bottles if I haven't a better option."
"I am a fan of Guinness Draught but the nitro-bottle does not work. Gimick. Buy in nitro-can or only allow it to be a special treat at the bar."
"Guinness is a great beer! I don't normally drink it unless it's on tap, but occasionally I pick a couple up."
"D- Very drinkable, easy quaffing."
"This was my ""gateway"" beer. My tastes have changed, but there will always be a special place in my heart for Guinness."
"Not a bad choice if you just want to drink a few that have some flavor and not have to over think about what you're drinking, but to just enjoy yourself."
"Drinkability - Too unbalanced and boring to be a session beer."
"Overall, this beer simply doesn't live up to the hype that it gets. Lots of attention and a fantastic appearance, but the smell and taste don't do it justice."
"I don't know why I really need to explain this much but here goes... Pours black with the awesome waterfall o bubbles that everyone is used to. There is also a finger of thick off-white foamy head which you can make pretty designs with. The aroma is basically confined to some burnt malts... But not very apparent. The taste starts with some chocolately malts and then pretty much ends there... But a little bIttermess thrown in for good measure. There is also a metallic aftertaste I do not enjoy. The beer finishes smooth but I have never ever been able to get drunk off it. If you're ordering a carbomb, this is the beer to go with."
"Just remember. It's not you. It's me."
"I don't know what to say here. In the midst of looking for something different as my desired brew was sold out, I decided to pick up a 4 pack of these. Immediately upon pouring I found myself impressed with the extremely thick and creamy retentive foam-head. After that, it all went down hill. Smell is very faint, and not at all impressive. Taste was very light, with some slight coffee and chocolate notes that were there, pretty much like flavored water. Mouthfeel was creamy with absolutely no carb tingle. Drinkability would be great if I was being forced to drink it, being so light and watery I could drink until I'm full, but the overall failure of this brew ensures I won't be buying this again."
"The CPJ"
"Drinkability: If you like the flavor combination this would be very easy to sit down for 5 or 6 of these. A little too watery for my tastes though."
"Pours a very dark brown liquid with 3 finger thick foamy tan head that settles to about a 1 finger head. Smell is fairly light mostly of chocolate malt. Has something of a sour taste to it, it's not bad but unique. The bitters and smokiness are quite light here, contrary to the beers appearance. Fairly creamy, almost milky, but thin, too thin in my opinion. The beer is very easy to pound though, when served properly, and could be drank all evening long."
"D: Guinness on tap is always a good, safe choice and always beats out the BMC competition."
"D: All night - you look like a badass drinking this beer compared to a bud light. Plus, it only has 10 more calories for those that care."
"D- THis is a classic beer. Wont ever turn this down. Love this beer. will drink it on a hot day or a freezing cold day!"
"Open the can and pour directly into a glass for best results... wait for the beer to form, might take a minute or two... thick, creamy head on top when finished. Feels a little watery in the mouth, but goes down smooth. Not as full-bodied or full-flavored as I would have hoped. Overall, a good beer. I will have a another... then some homemade taco pizza... peace out."
"D: I've never turned down a Guinness and I am sure I never will."
"Drinkability: A classic and one of the best looking beers I have seen. This to me is still the benchmark of the style and I would love to try it on tap in Ireland some day. That said, I could session this."
"Drinkability: Well, it'd be easy enough to drink, just not very enjoyable due to lack of good smells and flavors. How can a brewery that makes something of the caliber of the Foreign Extra Stout put something like this out? No idea, but clearly it happens."
"Still, this remains smooth and drinkable, if lacking in complexity."
"Thin flavors. The finishes nice and dry. This is not a meal in a glass."
"It feels very thin and watery my mouth. I haven't had Guinness in a while, and these bottles just don't remind me of the beer at all."
"The texture and drinkability is downright silk. Say what you want about the shortcomings of this beer, you can't deny that this creation, in terms of its drinkability, is on par with the excellence of craftsmanship of a fine French sauce!"
"Not worth a revisit."
"This is an awesome easy to find brew that I keep in my fridge for emergencies. Good anytime I feel like a dark brew."
"When first pouring this beer from the black bottle it ran into the glass with a delicious chocolate brown color that slowly darkened from the bottom up. The appearance of that pour made me want to draw in a long, steady, chug of bitter, stout, foamy goodness. Unfortunately I was met with mediocrity and disappointment. The initial taste and feel in my mouth was thin and bland. The smell was uninteresting, and the entire experience was forgettable."
"This is printable, but not wonderfully so. The pour is beautiful, but it fails to live up to those looks."
"Very good session beer, not a ground breaking but pleasantly drinkable, I could drink this all night long."
"D: It goes down easily enough, and I would drink one if offered, but this was bought as a last resort and that's probably the only way I would have it again."
"This is easily one of the best beers ever. Superb in every respect and highly sessionable. Dark and roasty, dry and refreshing. If you enjoy your coffee black, this beer will please. I can understand a hype backlash but hey I love this beer. I can't over state how perfect this beer really is, much like coca cola, I could drink this beer anywhere anytime"
"I like to call it the best light beer on earth thanks to the low calorie count and ease of consumption."
"-Warren"
"Much better than I was expecting, but this isn't definitely isn't something I would consistently go after when there are much better options for cheaper. $9.62 for a 4-pack of cans was almost overkill for me."
"drinkability: good. Not very good but good. When on sale for $10 a 12 pack, it's a good bet to buy. But there are other stouts out there that are better. Some include Sam Adams Cream stout, Murphy's Irish Stout, and O'hara's Irish stout. But Guinness is cheaper so I keep drinking it."
"D: I will never understand Guinness's popularity. The draught version is just bad. Way better stouts are all over the place; try one. Easy drinking, perhaps, but it's a chore to finish the pint. Not recommended."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable - was gone very quickly, but, while I could easily have another, I think this beer would be better with a meal for me anyway, and then I could have another and another. Still, despite my idea that it would be even better paired with food, it's a good and highly drinkable beer - not at all filling despite its heft and creaminess in the glass."
"D - Very drinkable for a stout. Not overwhelming at all."
"Sometimes if you find yourself at a crappy pub (like I did at Toronto Airport today), this draught will save your day."
"Drinkability, this is definately over priced but is one of the best macroes."
"Great creamy head, very tiny bubbles that you can barely see. Looks freshly brewed and almost as good as poured from the tap with the Nitro-Can. The smell, nice fresh smell. Call me a girl, but kind of flowery. But a rich kind of roasted smell. Chocolate, coffee bean kind of thing goin' on. Very smooth, creamy, chocolaty taste. A nice bitter roasted after bite. I also think I'm tastin' a lot of hops. Not really sure. But there's something there. Overall great drink while you're sipping and very nice finish. If you like the bitter thing. The feel and drink ability, the head is very nice but overall it feels a little too heavy. But this is my favorite beer. Great with salt and vinegar chips and steak."
"Poured on tap from many irish pubs across the country including Ireland. Poured a most beautiful cascading tan head until it was dark brown with a solid tan head that stays around for the long-haul. Smell is chocolatety with perhaps a hint of coffee. The mouthfeel is heavy with a strong coffee, light bitterness, and chocolate aroma even before swallowing. It finishes with a solid aftertaste of the same and is very drinkable. Wonderful carbonation and body throughout. Can't go wrong with a Guinness ever!"
"I love this beer and will choose it over anything at a normal bar. I will choose from other at a beer specialty bar but if this is on nitrogen at a bar, it gets picked first."
"Drinkability: No thanks, this is just Guinness + water + the nitro gimmick. Enhances the look and draws from the flavor, not for me."
"D- This is a very pleasureable and drinkable beer. Every time you drink one it is like an experience in and of itself. One of the great joys in life is to pop into a pub and grab a Guiness Draught on tap."
"D - While the taste is not the greatest, these go down easy."
"Overall this is a never again beer for me. I bought a 4-pack of cans and luckily my girlfriend enjoys them. I've only had Guinness twice. Once it was on tap and out of this can and it was flat both times. I'm sure that that's the way it's supposed to be and I'm not a fan. I would like to try out of the bottle but am very skeptical. Great smell and look but low marks on everything else."
"d 4 not sure if this is worth keeping around or not. certainly there is something better out there that's reasonably priced? i recall liking murphy's, but i think that comes in fairly large cans and goes for a kings ransom. hmmm"
"T and M and D- I like it, I mean its smooth creamy and drinkable. Guinness is not sweet and doesn't slam you with super coffee, chocolate or sugars. It has a very understated taste. It has its drawbacks, too little taste, seems like a watery finish. It is thin. Eh, its not a bad Irish Dry Stout."
"Guinness is good for you---or so they say. An old time favorite of mine. The nitro cans are great. They are typically very fresh tasting and create that killer Guinness cascade upon pour. Creamy head lasts through the pint (14.9 oz actually). Taste is roasted malt, grain with some dark chocolate and cream notes. It's a delicate beer, not a bruiser as the apperance my suggest. Low alcohol makes them VERY drinkable and super enjoyable. They go down fast. If you have had good Guinness on draft, this is kinda close---seems to be lacking a touch of body, though. A classic. I always welcome a pint of the 'black gold'."
"I'll always love me some Guinness."
"A very dark ruby-black with a beautiful classic pull-tap cream-colored head. Holds its head through the duration of the drink. Smells of dark chocolate, coffee (from the dark-roasted barley) and a slight hint of metallic. The feel of this beer is delightful! Very smooth and creamy even though the beer was served pretty cold. Tastes of dark chocolate with a nice bittersweet finish leaving a wet feel on the tongue. I really do enjoy everything about this beer from the appearance to the feel in the mouth. Really quite enjoyable!"
"Overall a roller-coaster of a beer. It looks great and is drinkable but the things you look at in exceptional beers, flavor and aroma, are definitely lacking. I can definitely understand they're trying to reach a broad audience and i think they do so with the Draught."
"D - Highly drinkable I'd say. Not offensive to the palate, this is a great session beer that goes great with dinner, after dinner, or, well, anytime really."
"However, the mouthfeel and drinkability do a bit to make up for the (lack of) taste. The mouthfeel is super creamy, and goes down the throat very nicely. It honestly could stand to be a bit thicker. It's also very drinkable, I could chug this as fast as I can chug water. This is my first Guinness I've ever had, and it's kind of confusing. All my time drinking almost exclusively dark beer have me equating DARK with LOTS OF FLAVOR. This isn't the case, even the lightest of craft beers have more flavor than this. However, the excellent mouthfeel and drinkability do quite a bit to make up for this. An interesting beer, for sure. I'm very interested in trying this from the nitro-can to see if my experience is different, because this is possibly the only beer I've seen that encourages me to drink it straight from the bottle."
"Verdict: A promising beginning, this beer looks and smells like a winner but takes a sour turn from thereon to create a pretty bland and confusing beer. To those who are into mass produced overpriced dark beers, this may be worth a try. However, beyond the smoky flavor, there was little here to hold my interest. Get in singles or on draft. C (3)"
"Drank on Tap cold, splitting a pitcher with a friend. Pours black with a foamy, thick white head, retention was great. Drinks nice, slightly carmel flavored, nice thick taste and mouth feel."
"It's drinkable. Very light in taste. Almost watered down like I said. If you're not a big flavor fan its extremely drinkable. Otherwise it leaves you wanting more."
"D: Maybe I'll throw a few of these back on St. Patty's Day, but that'd be it. Not something I'll try to conjure up thoughts of yesteryear with again anytime soon. Hahaha"
"This is definitely a beer you have to acquire a taste for. When I first started to drink Guinness it was on tap, and I sipped it A LOT. Now, some 15 years later, it is one of my ""go to"" beers. It is dark and bold, and if you are use to the typical American beer, GO ELSEWHERE. I gave the drinkability a low number because it is not for everyone, BUT IT IS DEFINITELY for me. It could be a little stronger in the ABV% for me, but other than that, its a stalwart."
"D: The appearance is about the only thing that does it for me with this beer. Other then that I just find it very weak in all aspects."
"Pours dark brown with a white head. Fairly dark, but much lighter than the Foreign Export Stout, which we tried this side-by-side with. The head on this one is quite creamy. From there, it goes a bit downhill and this isn't a particularly-memorable beer. There is a bit of mild roast and very, very faint dark chocolate in the nose, but that's about it. The taste is really mild and creamy--roast, light chocolate, and the tiniest touch of malt sweetness. Feel is light and creamy. Just an okay beer. This really seems to be all about texture and not big on flavor."
"d. its easy to drink, theres fractured flavors happening, but its nothing like it should be, in my opinion..."
" Check out the reviews for this by the BROS. They each reviewed it like five times and they're pretty funny."
"I've had it by bottle, can, and on-tap and of the three, I'd recommend getting this one on-tap. Nitro-cans are better then Nitro-bottles if you want to drink it out of a glass at home."
"D: Unfortunately, I can't drink too many of these before I have to call it a night."
"Guinness has the look of a high quality stout. This is probably due to the nitrogen. Guinness lacks the complexity of other stouts but is still delicious."
"D - Drinks kinda weird & rough because of the low carbonation and lack of taste compared to my usual Double/imperial stouts around my area. Not impressed at all, not buying it again... Only reason was it was only $12.99 a 12 pack of bottles.... GF was going towards it & we tried it out."
"(abarwithnoname.wordpress.com for more reviews)"
"The consistency and flavor to a lesser extent resemble that of a home made chocolate milk. Super creamy with little carbonation. The lack of hops make this beer a very straight forward simple beer that can be enjoyed over the coarse of an evening."
"In my memory, Guinness was a much more enjoyable drink. It might be that I'm comparing this to some of the bigger stouts I've experienced over the years."
"D- Goes down very easy. Smooth and a very drinkable beer."
"I accept responsibility for the problems because I bought this in a can. In a nutshell, the smell and taste were weak, not only compared to what I am accustomed to and generally love with Guinness, but even compared to what I would expect in a ""typical," ho-hum ale. I enjoy a beer that's really _doing_something_, which is what I expect from Guinness, but this was just bland. It's not horrible. It occurs to me this beer would be extremely easy to chug. But therein lies the problem. Why pay Guinness prices for a beer that boredom drives you to down?"
"D - Very easy drinking and refreshing due to the milkiness and smoothness as per many examples in intro-cans but flavor is admittedly lacking (4)"
"Dark black opaque color. Creamy coffee aroma with roasted malt and light chocolate. Extremely dense and frothy dark tan head. Decent lacing on glass. Small caramel notes on back of tongue with roast malt and coffee being the main flavors. Very light mouthfeel for start. I enjoy the nitrogen froth and has a creamy mouthfeel and the drinkability of water, very smooth. Has a dry, charred, raosty flavor to the aftertaste. Nothing in overall flavor very powerful, almost on the bland side. Would like to try the non-taxed version of this at the source and see if the flavors are any bolder. Although the flavors are slightly bland for my preferrence in a stout, but still this icon is still good and easy to drink."
"D: Pretty average run-of-the-mill dry stout. Flavors aren't bad, mouthfeel is though. The sad thing is sometimes this is the best beer available on tap. Drinkable, but not great."
"Drinkability - I can see why a lot of people really like this beer. It's very easy drinking. It was almost gone before I even knew what was going on. The look of this beer was outstanding, but that was the best aspect. I bet one could pound several of these no problem. For me however, the taste and mouthfeel do not make this real drinkable. I could drink a few, but I prefer the Extra Stout."
"edit: updated to reflect ratings change"
"D-As a huge fan of the extra stout I'm disappointed by the draught, I feel as if I'm drinking Guinness Light, that being said it is still an incredibly drinkable beer that one can put back all night. Assuming you would be into drinking watered down guinness"
"That said, I'd love to see this nitro widget technology employed on a beer that actually tastes like something. Imagine North Coast's Old Rasputin from a nitro-bottle!"
"Bottle. I haven't tried this drink since my Coors Extra Gold days. Now I understand why. Body is creamy, but light and watery. Aroma and palate is nothing but burnt bitter-sour grain. Finish is dry and more or less dissent. With so many great stouts available this one will be the last on my list."
"Guiness Draught is probably lauded more by non-beer heads than it should be and is also probably criticized more by beer heads than it should be. No, compared to a great RIS this doesn't even seem like a stout, but it has some enjoyable attributes: that big creamy head, easy drinker. I buy an 8 pack about once a year and then remember there are better options after I've had one. All around, not a bad brew and drinkable."
"I definitely give two Schlitz about this beer. There are better stouts for the price but this is still a fun brew to have around."
"drinks very easy, but i wouldnt ever buy this unless there absolutly was nothing better. much better with nitrogen however."
"D-Easy to drink although quite thick. Sessionable however."
"half litre can, dark, obviously but hints of red at the edges. The way this beer looks is the best thing about it. The head stays longer than other beers. Smells of smoke, hint of roasted vegetables. Thin body, tastes of smoked iron. Very smooth, goes down well. 4.2adv means it's one to session. My main complaint is it's over priced. To sum up i'd say its a beer for accountants."
"Well had this beer for the first time the the other day with some friends and I thought it was one of the best beers I've hAd. In my opinion the taste was fairly bitter but easy to drink. Didn't poor In glass but foam did start to come out of bottle so I'll just assume it had a decent head and laceing. Smelled somewhat like coffee-ish... Very good beer would definitely recomend"
"Drink Ability isn't bad. I could have two or three and be satisfied."
"D- Its easy to drink. But its watery and bland."
"The beer is black with a slight amber hue to it. The foam on this beer is really interesting. Very thick and creamy, with hints of roasted malt. The taste is bitter, the foam hits your palate first with a creamy texture. The beer finishes with a bitter taste that seems to linger for a little bit. The mouthfeel is thick and medium heavy. The beer is drinkable."
"M/D: Light airy and creamy, almost like frothed milk or something. It is a very drinkable beer, a little overpriced. A classic, although there are better examples of the style."
"The consistency and flavor to a lesser extent resemble that of a home made chocolate milk. Super creamy with little carbonation. The lack of hops make this beer a very straight forward simple beer that can be enjoyed over the coarse of an evening."
"Not Recommended. Buy any other kind of Guinness over this. May be worth trying on tap?"
"Supposedly, the Guinness of lore is actually the Foreign version, so maybe I will pick up a bottle of that to try, but as far as this beer is concerned, it doesn't live up to the hype at all."
"Easy to drink, best when poured into a glass."
"D: Thin flavors make it possible to guzzle if you want to."
"What happened to Guinness? I used to drink it on tap in Ireland, where it was good; then had to settle for Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (which is the malt liquor of stout) in a bottle in southeast Asia, then suffered through Guinness Extra Cold on tap in Australia, only to come home to the US after twenty years and experience Guinness Draught (in a can). No flavour at all. Tastes like water. Pointless, and I will never buy it again."
"Had this beer on tap. Was a dark brown with a beautiful regal head which hung around throughout the experience. Smelled some caramel malts hint of chocolate and coffee. The taste was initially good to me which I was able to taste the malts, caramel, slight coffeel and finished dry. The mouthfeel was watery and the brew went down ok. Yeah I could drink this again, but it was just a ok experience and if there's a better choice I would choose the other choice first. But it's a good solid brew."
"D- Very heavy beer, but very enjoyable. I recommend this beer to anyone who likes a dark stout."
"D - Low abv would make it a very drinkable stout however, it is heavy and creamy which makes it almost a meal."
"Overall - Nothing to write home about. Not a bad beer, but certainly nothing special. A very light, dry, watery sout."
"- Overall a nice drinker for those that don't want a buzz. Its more pretty than good."
"Easy to drink, like drinking water. It is good compared to crap, which doesn't say much."
"This brew will always be my favorite. Most individuals are intimidated to try it because of how dark and rich it pours. The pour from a can or on tap is iconic- and there is a particular way to pour this brew. The taste is a delicate mixture of malt and coffee. Despite its rich pour and thick head the beer is like and has a watery mouthfeel. This beer only gets better and as it warms."
"In a mug it poured a dark as ten nights brew with a thick creamy brown crown. Thin body. Roasted malts, some hints of coffe on the nose. Fairly the same on the palate. Watery and smooth at first sip and then it develops into a nice roasted malts taste without out loosing the smoothness, towards the end. Very good drinkability and aftertaste."
"Drinkability is tough. You can find this ANYWHERE. Anywhere in the world they'll have this. Any piss-poor macro American bar you visit will still offer Guinness. It goes down quickly and smoothly, low in alcohol. But I only drink this these days as a last resort or if I get a craving for a black and tan. So despite the good factors, if I don't want to drink it is it really that drinkable?"
"D- very easy to drink"
"D: A nice and easy drinking brew, in regards to mouthfeel and overall thickness of the beer."
"D- One of the best Macro brewed beers in my opinion. The flavour is very complex and goes down very smoothly."
"The verdict is that it isn't the best stout out there but sometimes this just hits the spot. Plus, it just looks awesome."
"Drinkability is fantastic. This goes down so easy, I love it. Guinness has something about it that I can't explain but it's just wonderful and sooo smooth. I love Guinness."
"For all of the hype I was a bit dissapointed. I would be willing to try it on draft but it just didn't do it for me this time around"
"Poured from a nitro can into a stout glass. Pours a beautiful black with a slowly forming rich and creamy head. Smells of caramel and burnt coffee. Upon tasting this stout the caramel and burnt coffee flavors are initially tasted followed by a creamy a slightly hopped flavor. This is a smooth and easy drinking stout and is a great stout for newcomers to a deeper and full flavored beer. I have truly grown accostomed to the unique flavor this stout has to offer and has been a bridgeway to trying and loving numerous other brews as my taste buds developed. Although I've tasted many high quality stouts over time I still really enjoy a Guinness drought from time to time and feel it necessary to pay homage to this fine stout."
"Pours really nice. One and a half fingers of thick nitro head atop a jet black beer. Notes of burnt grain are on the nose, but I think that the coldness is killing it... After letting it warm up the beer improved, with a bit of a better thicker body and notes of chocolate and roasted barley. Nevertheless it is still quite thin, but the mouthfeel is eveneed out by the creaminess of the nitro head... I ordered this b/c their only other even moderately interesting beers was Sam Adams Lager and Rickards White. I wanted something a little thicker and it did the trick."
"In the grand scheme of great beer, this beer is a joke. For what it is, style-wise or what have you, it's okay, but there are better - Murphy's, for one. If I'm simply trying to deliver alcohol to the system, I'd be bonkers to start pounding this. Guinness Draught, to sum up, probably goes best as something to wash down food, nothing more."
"Overall: A decent beer."
"Conclusion- Nitro-can is much better than most commercial beers. However, it does not hold a candle to the Guinness I had in Ireland. It is more bitter without the taste and smell of the original. Still a good mainstream stout though."
"It has a beautiful blackness with the cascading creamy foam and looks absolutely fantastic. However, I've never dissected it before so that's the first problem. I literally smell nothing, I keep trying, but honestly, I can't smell anything. It smells like water. The tastes there is slight, and I can't emphasize the slight enough, burnt malt taste with a cream kicker and the legendary sour that's the only thing separating it from just being a thick tasteless liquid to me. It's nice and creamy, but there is a watered down feel even to that. I could pound these all day, and they aren't too high of an ABV so that's something to go off of. It's not like I'll never have it again, but it's never my first choice anymore. If you've never had Guinness you need to have it at least once in your life, maybe around St. Patrick's day or something. Sláinte!"
"D: This is drinkable @ only 4.2% ABV. But I perfer on draft rather than in a bottle."
"Overall, I was not particularly impressed."
"I keep drying this when I'm out expect to discover there's a magical tap that fixes all this beers problems but at the end of the day a beer needs flavor to be good and this beer simply doesn't have any."
"D- This is an easy to drink beer. Not as challenging as Extra Stout or similar. Smooth and sessionable, but just lacking the intesnity of flavor."
"I judge all other stouts by Guinness-- which sets the bar rather low, I suppose-- but at least this way, it truly distinguishes what's a good stout and what isn't. You've got to try really hard to make a stout *worse* than Guinness."
"D- Definitively drinkable again, a classic pub drink, you cant go wrong with guiness."
"Impressive looking pour, looks milky thick with tons of bubbles rising. Pitch black color. Big fat beige head, nice lacing. This is about as good as it gets and it's all down hill from here. Funky bitter black licorice smell. The first thing I noticed after the first taste was how watery it was. In fact there is not much else going on here. They should have labeled it black licorice water. A big disappointment."
"Ahhh Guinness... always got it at a bar but never from the 'nitro can'. Pours with that amazing cascading look.... looks amazing every time and only see it with this. Pours a very dark 'almost' black. Nice huge fluffy head. Medium to full body, pretty good mouthfeel.. taste is very bland, some malts shining through but very water to me. I actually really enjoy the draft, but the draught seems to be more gimmicy with the bottle and nitro insert.. what matters is the product. Cool to try, but really is way overhyped. Meh."
"D - Like I mentioned, it has it's time and place, even though those times and places are fleeting at best. Good beginner beer for someone that wants to work their way up the dark beer ladder, but bad if they like this and expect ""better"" beers to taste similar."
"The beer was beautiful, jet black with an ample eggshell that softly cascades down the glass. I can never get over how cool this looks. The beer is soft and creamy but without much aroma or taste. It is a little bitter and roasty, but doesn't have the complexity of other dry stouts. The beer is clean, dry and luxurious from nitrogen, which makes it very easy to drink, but not very pleasurable."
"I could down this beer all night. The only problem is that it is ubiquitous but has craft beer price."
"Final Notes: I think Arthur Guinness would be rolling around in his grave to think how modern Guinness has been bastardized like it has. Nothing compares to real Irish Guinness I'm afraid (I've only had a bottle of Foreign Stout once, I'll never forget it)."
"pours a dark brown with a creamy white head, decent retention and lacing. smell is light, hard to pick up too much of anything distinct; maybe a touch of roasted malt. taste follows the nose, unfortunately. not a whole lot going on. mouthfeel has a creamy yet watery characteristic to it. as noted by others, i remember enjoying this beer a lot more years ago... not sure whether guinness changed or my palate did (or both)."
"Can't believe I drank this for all those years-not my favorite."
"Not the first time I've had this one, obviously. Appearance is great, as always. Huge foamy head with tons of lacing. Smells of light malty coffee and some sweetness. I always think the taste is stronger than it ends up being. Very delicious, but a little light for my taste, but that is the point of the style...so I'll say average. Overall great beer for the style at a great price. I don't know if you can find a smoother drink."
"Overall, Guinness Draught is rarely my first choice at either the bar or the bottle shop, but it is a classic that I won't refuse if offered."
"RJT"
"This beer is one of my favorite beers. I have it at least twice a month. My favorite place to get a pint of guinness is at O'nearys irish pub in Brainerd Minnesota down town. I don't know what it's made of but I taste coffee, molases, not real hoppy maybe some malt. I give it a perfect score. The last part of the stout is the best part."
"This looked like the Gulf of Mexico, courtesy of BP, in a glass. It had a finger's worth thick, rich cap of medium-tan head with great retention, capable of hanging around well into the fall. Color was a solid tar-black with zero light-penetration. Thank goodness I don't need to re-cap it because I wouldn't know where to start. Nose had a light milk chocolate sweetness underlain by a mild roastiness, kind of smoky, kind of charcoal. Mouthfeel was silky, creamy, like a dollop of something you might add to your coffee. Speaking of coffee, that was its initial flavour on the tongue. It was then followed by a chocolaty sweetness and then a charcoal bitterness. Finish was dry, more toward the charcoal/smoke taste than the sweetness noted earlier. Great lacing throughout. Hopefully, no peliCANs are nearby ... Not really a cooler-worthy beer, but more of a soccer or rugby match on the telly beer. Did I mention I now have the Dish Network? Doctor Who every weekday at 5 PM on BBC America! Who's your doctor and what's in your wallet?"
"Due to its creamy mouthfeel and relatively lowish alcohol, you can drink these all night long. Despite the limited taste, it does go down easy. I'm just not a fan."
"Pours a pitch black with thick white head, propped up by the nitro I'm sure. Head retention and lacing are there throughout, but it always feels artificial with a nitro. Smells of faint roasted malt and little bit of coffee. Taste has some of the roastiness from a stout, but it is on the watery side. Very creamy mouthfeel, but it feels too light for the flavour."
"I have not had it in a while, but like some other BA members, I remember this being much better."
"D: Well this is a big disappointment, I haven't had a pint in a bar in a really long time, but I don't remember Guinness ever being so blah. Glad that someone left these at the house and I didn't buy them. Don't bother with this, there are better dry stouts to be had."
"The head is thick and creamy, but the body is so thin it is shocking! This is a real sessionable dry stout-- not really filling like I remember. The taste shows those sweet roasty malts and a dry finish that is quite nice."
"Pours a almost solid black with a rich cream head that will not go away for anything (very sexy). Very good lacing and almost no carbonation, goes down very smooth. At first sip it taste like coffee, a very cold coffee with a hint of hops. A very good beer in my opinion. i just wish I could actually try some from Dublin."
"Not a bad beer at all. Appearance is good and the smell is fresh. The taste is quite different from most beers I've had. At first it tastes of hops and cold coffee. Drinkability is only average. It is hard to drink this beer if you aren't use to Stout. Drinking more than 3 will get you a good buzz going on and it gets harder and harder to drink this beer."
"Creamy and smooth. The brew is a bit thin and light but sustained by a bitter interesting propagates well in the throat. Leaving the beer a little rest, traces of roasting are felt, with small spikes of acidity, but particularly touches of coffee, a bit like the nose."
"D: Not meant for immediate refreshment. It is best served with a meal. It is great with traditional Anglo-American dishes and fish"
"12 ounce nitro widget bottle. Pours a dark charcoal black with a ful 1/2 head with incredible retention due to the injection of nitrogen. The head just will not go down, and cascades down the side of the glass as you go on. Smells of roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate with that unique Guinness smell that I assume is a byproduct of the nitrogen. One thing that has always amazed me with Guinness is just how quaffable it is - everyone assumes that dark beers are challenging to finish. That's not the case with this beer. It's easy to drink which is probably why I got into it in the first place. The taste gives you lots of roasted and chocolate malt in the background, and the nitrogen lends the beer a nice creaminess. Chocolate milk isn't necessarily the best description - Guinness isn't a milk stout - but perhaps something like Yoo-Hoo is more appropriate. There are some hops there, though they are quite earthy and muted. Fuggles perhaps? The hops lend a nice and lightly bitter finish to the entire affair. Overall Guinness remains an Irish classic and one of the best stouts on the market today."
"D - I've always loved Guinness, and the bottles, though not quite as good as draught, are still quite tasty. Guinness has done a great job of preserving the quality of their product for mass distribution. I always have, and will continue to, love their stout!"
"Drinkability: I can drink this beer all night long, have one or two with dinner, hell, i could probably drink Guinness draught for breakfast. when in a bar that serves bud, coors, miller, carona, and that sort, a guinness draught will put a smile on my face every time."
"Well, I should start by admitting that it's not really fair to the Guinness folks to do a review on their bottled product. My very first Guinness was straight out of the tap at a small pub just off Grafton Street, near Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland. I thought I had died and gone to heaven, and have had a lot of Guinness since, in a lot of places, a lot of styles. This nitro bottle is actually not bad for a bottled beer, but it's not the same as a real nitro-tapped Guinness fresh from a hopping pub. This beer pours more dark brown than the classic Guinness black. The head is okay, but has a lot of larger bubbles. It does cling well to the glass as you drink it, and the head does carry a lot of the good bitter hops onto your tongue. Otherwise, the beer is just not so great. It has a coffee flavor that is too mellow, and a texture that is a bit too watery -- nothing near as thick and creamy as a ""real"" Guinness. Overall, I think I'll save my Guinness moments for those good pubs that know how to keep it fresh and pour it correctly into a proper imperial pint glass."
"Would be OK as an alternative to a cheap lager or other macrobrew, but I think it's a lower-end porter. The Guinness in Europe may be different so it's hard to judge, but I'm not a big fan of the American version, and I agree it's overpriced."
"I can't judge this objectively because I think I recieved an old six pack from local store. Very flat no taste was very generous with the ratings for this particular pack. Had it many times before and has always been very average at best. I'm not much of a stout fan inthe summer for obvious reasons but a friend brought some by and it was such a bad pack I had to write something. SOOO average at best"
"Thank you."
"Overall, not bad, I was hoping for better with all the advertising and such Guinness does. This is somewhat comparable to Saranac's Irish Stout, but I liked this one better."
"Nicely drinkable but it has become a little pedestrian for my taste."
"There is still no comparison between the rich creaminess of Guinness on tap and any other form, but if you wanted to enjoy a Guinness away from the pub, this is the next best thing."
"Ar 7/10, Ap 5/5, T 7/10, P 5/5, O 16/20: 4.0 Score"
"Head is smooth and white while the body very dark though not pitch black. The creaminess from nitro takes a while to settle but ultimately produces a fairly stable foam and fine mouthfeel. There's hardly any smell, maybe a faint smokiness. Clean taste, very light, with only a trace of sweetness. Light coffee and toast throughout. The virtue of this beer lies in the lack of offensive qualities rather than any outstanding taste. The smoothness and lightness make it quaffable."
"Geinness Draught poured black with a good size head. It has a coffee like smell, but its very weak. It taste rather watery, with a little bit of chochlate, and coffee flavors. Very easy to drink, the lightist stout I ever had. Overall this stout is great on a summer day, because its not to heavy, but missing alot for someone looking for a real stout."
"This is much like drinking second or third runnings off of the mash of a brew; bitter, almost atringent, and very thin. If I'm going to session, I would prefer a pale ale because this embarrasses stouts with flavor."
"Exceptional beer when on a nitrous tap, it puts other Guinness to shame"
"D: High. Refreshing beer, after all. The combination of the dry taste, reasonable bitterness and a low ABV makes it a very easy drinking beer. Good black stuff! ;)"
"Drinkability is great, though. Low ABV and light flavor makes it easy to pound, not worth the cost, though. IMO, guinness is the most overpriced beer on the market. Should be $6-7 for a sixer, not $9-10!"
"Decent enough beer, but nothing like I recall it from 20 years ago as a pup in the beer world."
"OK, I finally broke down and bought a 12-pack of the these bottles because they were on sale. What a mistake! It tastes like watered-down Guinness. You don't get to see the beer (as my avatar will attest, one of the great things about drinking Guinness). Only 11 oz in the bottle. Was gone after 1.2 sips. I hope that this does not become the way for Guinness in the future..."
"This is a truly disappointing stout. I watched the ""Historic Pubs of Dublin"" PBS special today (again) and was inspired to have a good stout or a Guinness. A sad, sad night."
"Not a fan of the draught bottle. You're missing out on the visual part of Guinness, which is the best part. It's a pretty cool concept, and executed well, but with its inability to be poured into a glass, it's pretty bad. The only thing I like about this is that it tastes like Guinness and you can bring the bottle camping, tailgating, or wherever a glass is inconvenient."
"D: Very drinkable--probably the world's best chugging beer, though I'm not sure if that's a complement. The beer is okay but is rather mundane and boring overall"
"I see a lot of mixed reviews for this beer. Not among the greatest, but I enjoy it."
"D- The low abv is nice, but that is the redeeming factor for drinkability. I know I will have again someday on tap at a true irish pub, but I am not drinking this more than one at a time if any at a time."
"D: This was probably altered a bit to get to can form, and although it's drinkable, the lack of flavor just makes me crave a Guinness from the tap. So maybe it did its job in making me want to drink more Guinness, but it fails in that the Guinness I want to drink is not this form of it."
"FOR SHAME!"
"Put more time into your brew and less time into your marketing. You've clearly generated enough profit to launch massive campaigns - utilize on the product."
"Drinkability: good because it is portable Guinness, I will always prefer the pint at the pub. I think Guinness will always have a place in my heart. I good example of a dry stout. I will definitely purchase again."
"Overall this was a good beer but I thought the whole nitro-can thing was a little unnecessary. I found it made the beer flat feeling and a little watery tasting. I know it is supposed to mimic the whole tap experience thing but I find the experience lacking. I much prefer the bottled version if drinking it at home."
"I tried two types of Guinness on the night that I took the notes that would become the review that you are reading now: nitro-bottle and nitro-can. Both are below-average beers at best. The nitro-bottle version is flat-out awful. Avoid it at all costs. I found the nitro-can version to be an upgrade, but still the beer is below par. There are much better examples of the Irish Dry Stout style; there is probably a delicious version made right in your neck of the woods, dear reader. Go drink that local dry stout instead."
"Notes: This beer does not live up to the true Guinness on draft, but everyone knows that. Not a bad beer, slightly better than average, but thats it."
"Drinkability - For all its faults this is still a very drinkable beer. I think overall it works better in a complementary role with a meal or something better than it stands on its own."
"D - This was my first beer, and while I have since moved onto greener pastures, this still holds a special place. No, it's not the best beer in the word -- not even the best in its category (try O'Hara's or Murphy's), but the fact that it's so widely available and ubiquitous insures that it remains a staple of mine. Highly drinkable, and a good beer for enjoying the company of friends."
"Drinkability: This beer finishes very quickly and is much tastier than drinking a low calorie american adjunct while beating most of them in calories. Not great but I can drink these all day long."
"O: Excellent, beautiful cream with just a hair of bitterness. 4.5"
"Overall: What Guinness should be."
"Very smooth, almost creamy, with a roasted/burnt malt flavor. If you have never tried a stout, try this one first or something more robust might level you."
"Nicknamed ""Blonde in a Black Dress"" (by who knows who) Guinness is more than gimmicky paraphernalia."
"Very delicious. One of my favorite beers. Love the creamy head and mustache that I get from drinking it. The best way to enjoy a night out without worrying about too much alcohol at 4.2%. I hate when you go to a bar and they don't know the proper pouring technique for Guinness. Love the taste of my Guinness."
"Watery and not very stout-like. Now that I know of alternatives, I will not be returning often."
"D-This is an old favorite that I haven't had on-tap in a very long time. Very easy drinking and often the best choice at shitty bars that I find myself in from time to time. While it's not complex at all, it's not the swill that some make it out to be. A great gateway beer for many."
"Drinks really easy. Decent session beer that can be found seemingly everywhere. Lacks in much flavor, but still a pretty decent beer."
"D- Possibly a good session beer but I would personally not prefer it, nevertheless is a beer that can be drank all night"
"Easy enough to drink, but I'd put a two can limit on this one."
"DRINK: About 9 or 10 on a thirsty day, easy."
"Aroma is disappointingly thin, with some roasted malt. Flavor is more bitter roasted malt and coffee with a creamy finish. Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than expected but still creamy. Overall doesn't stack up to its appearance. But still pretty drinkable."
"Basic stout that I think sets the above average drink. Thick, sweet with a slight taste of bitter to it.. I prefer it at 60 to 70 deg F, refrigerate for about 15 to 20 minutes and drink."
"My least favorite of the big 3 Irish stouts."
"Drinkability: This beer is pretty drinkable and I'd certainly have it again. I am worried about the effects of the nitro but it doesn't really take away from the drinkability. This beer is still worth a try and I'm sure I'll have it again at some point."
"D - Spot on for style. With the low abv, lighter body and clean finish, this makes a great session beer."
"D: For me near perfection...I perfect everyday beer...I love my ipa's and lagers but I will always have a special place in my heart for Guinness"
"Is this seriously the same beverage that was my gateway into good beer drinking back in 1995? A poor example of the style, although I've been known to tip back a few for old times' sake now and then."
"Slainte!"
"Overall, there are other more flavorful stouts out there to be sure, but Guinness is very drinkable and a beauty to behold if poured correctly. A classic."
"Had this beer from a nitro-can. It's decent, not my favorite beer in the world but I do like it. Very smooth from the can, not a great deal of flavor. It is what it is. I recently had Murphy's from a nitro-can and I think I may like that one even more. If you're looking for an Irish beer, you have to start with Guinness."
"It's been awhile since I've had a Guiness so I guess St. Patrick's Day is a good time to get reaquainted. It was served to me already settled with no cascading effect. Maybe the nitrogen is turned down. Not exactly sure how that works. Still had a big creamy head that sticks to the sides like crazy. Smell? Not much to report. A little bit of roasted grain, maybe. Taste? Much of the same. What happened? Did they water this down? I can't believe that my palate evolved that much in only a year or two that a beer that I once loved now tastes so bland. Either way, I'm less than impressed. I guess a plus side is it's easy to drink and low on calories."
"I've had a million of these but never sat down to review it. Did not mark as high as I had expected... But it is the beer that moved me to try other things... So for that I'm great-full... Thank you St. James Gate."
"A tasty classic that is best on tap, but good from the can and bottle. Guinness is always known as the standard for stouts, and while I find this beer extremely drinkable and always enjoyable, the reality is that the taste is only average."
"Overall, as much as I want to like this beer as much as I did when I first had it, it just does not seem the same as I remember. It's like a bland, dull version of what I knew."
"Yes, it's drinkable, but not nearly as much so as the Extra Stout, which, even though this one was brewed in Canada, is at least a head above the Irish-brewed Draught."
"The mouthfeel is slightly watery and thin with a very dry finish. The nitro head creates a creamy sensation with each sip. The carbonation is very low. Overall, it's a bit lifeless, but I'm usually not a fan of nitro pours. Drinkability is the main feature of this beer. It's meant to be enjoyed in multiples, and the low alcohol content and thin body helps that cause."
"The only good thing about Guinness?? The cool cascading head if you pour it right...that and it's $2 cheaper per six pack on March 17th!"
"First sip is lighter than I expected. It's got a darker malt quality and something of a sweet aftertaste, but aside from that, it seems to be a fairly simple beer."
"D: Quite a dissapointment after the pour and the smell. But still for beeing a macro-beer, it's not bad at all."
"D. This is a heavy hitter in the drinkability category as this can be a solid choice any time."
"While I do believe this is the best looking beer (during pour) there is, there is really no redeeming value to this brew past the visual aesthetics..."
"Not like Guinness from a tap. Very sweet and thin tasting. Flavors of copper, milk chocolate and light brown sugar. Foamy thin carbonation and an unpleasant aftertaste of bitter prunes. Looks like Guinness, sort of smells like Guinness, but tastes ""off"" and is not an accurate representation of Guinness Stout. The cans are somehow 14.9 ounces, but priced more expensive than other pints. I'm just not sure the ""nitro can"" idea really works. The thin, flat character of this brew is pretty unacceptable. Why exactly do they sell this and sully the good name of this venerable brand? I'll avoid this variation on Guinness in the future."
"Drinkability: I could have a twenty of these"
"D: This is an old classic. It may be overrated and or over worshipped by some but it does have its place as an easy drinking full bodied beer. It does not get one drunk or fill one up contrary to belief but it does give a strong lingering sourness that gets old after a few of these. Great to pair with corned beef and cabbage."
"When my friend let me try this beer I did not like it at all. The taste was not great at all, it smelled bad and the taste was funky to me. In my opinion I rather drink Guinness Harp over this sorry excuse for a beer. Please don't waste you money not worth the time."
"D: yea its highly drinkable"
"I rated this beer as a session beer. Nitro-tap makes a pretty big difference. The body is more creamy and it seems to help come through with some of the coffee flavors. The beer is black yes but it's pretty light in almost every other aspect. Light to mild coffee flavors with a light black chocolate bitter dry finish. I get one on saint patty's day and it was a beer that I used as a building block for my beer-a-mid. Its one of those beers that I used to think was really good when I first started tasting other things than bmc brews but when coming back to it to give it a proper rating it wasn't what I remember it. Ok beer, great heritage, and has a huge culture and following behind it. god save ireland."
"Pours a beautiful dark brown, nearly black, with a tan head of about one finger. Don't get much of a smell, but what I do get is the faint aroma of coffee and toasted malts. Tastes of coffee, slightly bitter. Very smooth beer, with a decent bit of carbonation. So easy to drink, especially if you're a coffee fanatic."
"The appearance is super dark brown with a a nitro head that looks nice but is not big enough. The aroma is coffee, burnt malt, and a touch of chocolate but not strong enough. The taste is like the aroma and the best part of the beer. The palate is a bit thin for the style but OK. Everything about this beer is good but is not strong enough, at least for me."
"This is the classic Guinness, and the draught system works fairly well. However there are far better stouts."
"Notes: Guinness was my introduction to stout and continues to be the measuring stick others are judged by. I find Guinness to be at its best if I pull it out of the fridge and wait 20 minutes before opening."
"My son loves this beer and he can have it. It has no taste to me what so ever. I don't see what the fuss is about this beer. It looks good only because it resembles chocolate, but it just tastes bad. I know alot of people love this beer, just not all of us."
" color is classic deep black with a beautiful head, love the way the bubbles go down, probably the most iconic looking beer in the world. smell is pretty good, has a nice chocolately malt aroma to it, taste is pretty good too, i love to drink Guinness, but i dont think the taste is outstanding, i dont know if that makes much sense, but its just a good beer and a treat from the mundane. mouthfeel is probably its biggest downfall, it is very watery, which is surprising considering its color as most stouts are much thicker and richer. drinkability is high at least for me because i do love guinness."
"People say that Guinness is the standard for the Irish Stout style. And in this case, the standard is utterly average, when had from the can. Cano-a-cano, Murphy's blows this stuff out of the water. Much smoother, less harsh, but with all the flavor. Plus, the Murphy's can is a full pint. Sorry Guinness. At least you're very popular."
"Drinkability is good, it's definitely a great drinking beer. It's light, has a great mouthfeel and drinks like chocolate milk. I can't say it has a great aroma or taste like some of my favorite stouts but the appearance, mouthfeel and drinkability are very good in this classic beer."
"Happy St. Patricks!!"
"Stick with it on draught - the can is certainly drinkable, but you're drinking a shadow of the original form. Best not be disappointed and go with the good stuff."
"Notes: Light and watery. Decent roasted flavors, but just too light."
"We all know what its about, dark, stout, yadda yadda, but if you go to a place that has good guinness on tap...good stuff, a solid stout."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: having had the draught poured ""correctly"" in England and Scotland, I can honestly the difference in the widgeted bottle isn't palpable to me--the reliability and drinkability make this a great partner to any number of activities. Recognizable branding and availability make this also a winner for convenience's sake."
"Very easy to drink. Not much taste here, so I'm not sure I'd want more than one, but nothing offensive in the drinkability either."
"Easy-drinking."
"D: The nostalgia of Guinness being the first beer I ever had is tough to beat, but I've had way too many beers since then to really rate Guinness high. That said, its my go to in a bar with no craft beer."
"D- Despite the watered down flavor and weird mouth-feel this dam beer is pretty drinkable. Its not something Ill go out of my way for but I wouldn't turn one down either."
"I look forward to trying better versions of Guinness, but for now my impression has been tarnished."
"Pours into a frothy, auburn maelstrom that settles via cascade into a very dark brown, nearly black body with about a finger's worth of tan head that laces very nicely. There isn't much to the smell, only small bits of oats, malts, coffee, and sugar, all very faint. The taste delivers a solid amount of dark grains, with phases of milkiness and that trademark Guinness half-sour at the back. The body is near the top of the moderate scale, and is extremely smooth, leading to a highly drinkable brew. One of my favorite widely-distributed brews!"
"i have to admit i have had this beer many times but untill i got into really teasing beer i never enjoyed it how ever i have gained a new respect for this beer,,,the teste the smell is just wonderfull,,,and as i am not a fan of most dark beers even i have to admit my suprise,,,,this is a good dark beer that i belive everyone should try or try again,,,,"
"It has been a couple years since I've had a Guinness. I won't be seeking it out again soon. Not the Guinness of old."
"I used to love drinking this on tap since it's even better than in the can, but I then noticed I was getting hangovers. I think it might be because of the preservatives. I don't know."
"Well Ive had Guinness plenty of times but I will see just how drinkable this is tonight seeing how its Super Bowl Sunday and I bought a 8 pack."
"Not impressed."
"D: Nitrogen does work wonders for beer at times, but not here. The widget is pretty much spent upon the opening, resulting in flat beer when poured. Not my choice when it comes to St. Patrick's Day."
"Very good gateway stout, pretty sure many of us were introduced to this before drinking GOOD stouts."
"Hum, I am one who probably is so accustomed to mass produced beers in the USA that this monster will never, ever be included in by beer ""to drink list."" Such a horrendous hour of trying to swallow this tragedy. Ugly, flat, mouth-drying, uneven and just plain gross. The incredibly overpowering heaviness was such that I truly, truly considered returning it to the bartender. I trooped on, though and finished it in protest. An ungodly representaion of beer and will never voluntarily consume again."
"Drinkability: I couldn't even finish one of these. If this is the essence of what a stout is, then I'm not a fan. If all you've got is this, then get me a glass of water."
"This isn't my favorite Guinness product but it is still one I always seem to come back to."
"Poured into pint glass a long time ago, before I discovered that Guinness is not suitable for my vegetarian diet. The beer is dark, pitch black with a large tan head. The smell and taste are chocolate/bread/malts, the mouthfeel is medium bodied with an extra dry finish. I used to drink these all day during my college years, although once I found other stouts, I was finished."
"Still one of my favorites."
"D – Very drinkable, and pairable, obviously; it is the only beer routinely mixed with almost any other beer under the sun, and it is probably the most often cited beer for culinary purposes."
"d - like I said, watery with mild flavor and low alcohol content - you can put down a six pack without blinking, but for $10 i wouldn't recomend it"
"D: Highly drinkable stout. Nothing is too strong in this beer, it is all balanced nicely."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkabiliy are exceptional and extraordinary. This creamy devine beer loves company, sing-alongs, and Irish blessings! A true legend for all the right reasons."
"D: These are very easy to go through for me. This is a good stepping off point for lager drinkers looking for more. A sentemental favorite of mine."
"D - As long as it's cold there is nothing offensive so I had no problem getting a pint down."
"Finaly: What is this - a sort of bizarre experiment how much crappishness can be bottled/canned and people will still be drinking it? This brew hits the absolute zero on quality scale. He (Guinness) has gone where no one else has gone before."
"Overall: If this beer is being rated as a traditional stout it falls far short, but I believe that Guinness Draught from a can is not meant at all to taste like a normal stout, but instead like a can of nitro Guinness. This makes rating difficult because I am not sure what to compare it to. I think people either love Guinness for what it is, or disdain it because it is not a typical stout. Take your pick. Personally, I love this beer because of its interesting and rich history, and because of the marketing involved. It is packaged beautifully and looks simply wonderful in a glass. So it is watery? I kind of think it is refreshing for that reason. No it will never be Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout but I don't think it is trying to be..."
"guinness is guinness most people out there have had this. The simpsons said it right it's like having bog water and chocolate syrup. dark color tan head pours forth. Very bland stout. creamy taste though. I can always drink a few of these, but would rather have something else most days."
"D - I can see other people drinking this no problem; however, my problem is that there just isn't enough taste to it. It tasted too watery i have a hard time getting thru one."
"Mmmm, Guinness. This was one of my favorite beers before I got into micros. The best thing about this beer is the appearance: dark brown / black, with a huge creamy head. Head retention is very good, it stays around for the duration of the beer. There is a light roasted aroma. The flavor is of roasted malts and bitter coffee. This is fairly watery for a stout, but it still has a extremely smooth mouthfeel from the nitro. The mouthfeel would be exceptional if the body wasn't so light. Overall this is kind of bland compared to other stouts, but it's still a very drinkable beer."
"As with so many others, Guinness Draught was my first foray into beer other than American Adjunct Lagers, and a very long time ago, I loved it. Now, after having tried so many great aggressive and complex stouts (Yeti and FBS to name just two), Guinness Draught seems like water."
"I have to admit that this beer was and remains one of my first loves. I'd never tasted anything like it -- low carbonation, black, milky consistency, and a solid, nutty flavor that had me at the first sip. However, I will admit that this beer has its faults. The burnt, woody flavor quickly becomes monotonous. The taste is really too mild for its heartiness -- I found myself wishing for a ""bigger"" flavor with more depth. However, it's incredibly drinkable and has the power to lure beer-haters out of their caves. Those who wish for a stronger, more nuanced flavor might try Guinness Extra Stout."
"This is the first beer I got into when I turned 21, so Guinness always has a special place in my heart. Finally took the time to review one. My tastes have changed since then, but I still like it. Poured it into a Tulip style pint glass it has a nice looking nitro effect to it while being poured. The bubbles slowly work their way to the top. Whether or not you're a fan of Guinness I feel everyone should agree atleast that it's a good looking beer. A few years ago I would have rated the taste and smell so much higher, but pretty average now. It's generously malted, very sweet with hints of chocolate and coffee. When let back down to room temperature you can slightly smell the hop but you really have to look for it. In the taste it's also difficult to pick up on the hop, it does have a slight bitterness to it. It's nothing too high in quality but well blended. The mouthfeel is pretty good, for a stout it does feel a bit watered down for a stout. It's very drinkable, no matter what the occasion. Not my favorite beer anymore, but I'll still never turn one down!"
"D: This is really disappointing. I recall early on in my drinking days when Guinness was a fairly enjoyable beer, but it seems to have gone the way of so many other mass produced items."
"D: Definitely the easiest drinking stout I have ever come across. While that could be a good thing, depending on the circumstances, typically I'm looking for something a little more substantial with a stout, but in the dry irish stout cataegory, this appears to be the norm for this style of beer."
"Anyways, this one pours black out of the can with a thin creamy head that lingers. Smell is very weak. Taste is not terrible, with hints of chocolate and coffee. Light bitterness predominiates. The mouthfeel has always been a little thin for my liking, as I prefer my stouts a little more creamy/chewy. Even low ABV stout as the one could benefit from a rich mouthfeel. Drinkability is decent, but in my experience you'll feel 'full' long before you feel a buzz."
"D- nice heavy stout. It goes down smoother than most and easy to throw it down."
"this beer is pretty much the exact same as the nitro can version. the only difference is that maybe the mouthfeel was a bit more chewy and thicker, and the darker malts were, well, maltier. all in all the product is the same as the can, and i prefer neither."
"Overall Guinness isn't the Grade A beer I remember it being. But I still think it's worthy. I love the whole event of pouring a pint of it. If it wasn't for the appearance and mouthfeel I think this would be the same as any other middle of the road stout."
"Overall, I say give it a try. It is one of the most famous beers, and that's for a reason."
"D - fairly easy to drink"
"D. This is definatly a beer that you sit and enjoy for long periods of time"
"D: On its own, I wouldn't say this beer is overly drinkable, but, as a mixer I'm a huge fan, which is the main reason I keep them around the house. When mixed with other beers or cider, Guinness can't be beat."
"D: It is drinkable, but I would probably go to the corner store and pick up another brew."
"Dr. Easy to abuse, but much better on tap with friends in an Irish themed bar."
"D: Very drinkable, as far as stouts go, owing to it's slightly watered-down profile. Guinness gets a bad rap from all the beer snobs on here, but for a macro, it's decent."
"Mentioning Guinness seems to elicit a response from most people, but canned Guinness Draught leaves something to be desired. I would much rather take the Extra Stout, especially the lovely Foreign Extra I enjoyed so in Jamaica."
"drinkability-If I downed one of these it'll be an accomplishment. Someone will be getting an early christmas gift (ie, the other 5 in the pack)"
"Drinkability- I wish I could pour these all day. After that, its all downhill. I appreciate the effort that went into developing the nitro-can but the beer itself is lackluster. I don't mind drinking these at all, but for $6 for a four pack, a total dud."
"Overall I could sum it up best by saying: All bark, no bite"
"Nice buzz, nice taste, nice smell, nice look, real enjoyability for a darker popular beer. It's my new go-to!"
"Beer is smooth, one of the smoothest creamiest beers I've ever drank. Drinkability is high. This is a really sessionable beer. I could drink this all night long. There is mild bitterness and some nice subtle roast character. Some chocolate like flavors and a great medium body. Drinkability is high and mouthfeel is good."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink but too light. Not really a Stout."
"I will not rate this beer in the normal A,S,T,M,D fashion. This beer was the gateway beer for me into good quality beers. This beer really expanded my horizons. What gives it the the nice tang is the soured beer that is added to it. I recently am on a hiatus from drinking stouts but this was my staple for a cheap good tasting stout when I started leaving the coors and the other light beers. I really enjoyed this beer and was one of my tops for a long time."
"F: Semi bitter, earthy, a little sweet, lingering creamy feel and taste, some lingering fruity flavors and sweet syrupy like flavors."
"Doesn't smell like anything. The taste is unique, a thin stout, but likeable. Doesn't leave a whole lot to talk about mouthfeel wise, its rather simple actually. Drinkability, very drinkable. Lots of them."
"blah not going to finish this it's that bad."
"OK really who hasn't had this. Irish car bombs the other night, and it was so good. I haven't had one since I joined BA and its just like I remembered it, smooth low alky and enjoyable. They go down so smooth that you don;t think of the % in it cause its so low. doesn't matter it was good, and when nothing else is around I grab one."
"This really isn't quite the Guinness that I remember loving so much from tastes when I was younger...maybe its because I've had better stouts since then. It's not a horrible beer by any means, but it's just not something to get particularly excited over, and it's on the bland side."
"I'll admit, Guiness is still one of the prettiest pours when done correctly. Nearly pitch black body with creamy khaki colored head. As always, good retention, minimal lacing however. Smell is of burnt grains, dark coffee beans, sliglty nutty and hints of brown sugar. Taste is of faint dark, slightly burnt grains and coffee. Hints of chocolate, nuts, molasses and some funky sour-like thing going on (note: was amazed to come on and read so many reviews describing this quality, i did not remeber this at all last time i had a pint). Nitro gives it a creamy (once percieved as thick) light/medium body which works well with this beer. Not bad, the little sour thing concerns me and my advanced palate would love a bump up in the dark malt profile, but solid."
"D: Wonderfully, wonderfully drinkable concoction. I love fresh Guinness on-tap."
"Was kinda watery going down, but it is smooth. It has a thin slightly sour finish to it. Somewhat drinkable due to its smoothness."
"Good stout, but better in Dublin (of course!)."
"Poured into a pint glass coffee black with a glowing tan head that was present until the glass was empty and even left some foam behind. Smelled like a roasted malt with very faint coffee. Tasted very bland, slightly sweet, very dry and a burnt aftertaste. Long ago had viewed this as a very heavy beer, but the perception is just that - an illusion. A light beer with a dry thick body. Drinkability is one of the stronger aspects of this beer. Not bad overall"
"There are much better stouts, for the style Murphy's is better, though available only in cans in my part of the world. Availabilty, here, is the crucial criterion: I can't think of any part of the world where one cannot find Guinness on tap. Even in WV it can be found, at least in independent restaraunts and bars. When in doubt, Guinness Stout"
"I still think this is a great session beer. This review is for the nitro-can version. But Guinness Draught is positively best from the spigot and fresh."
"Poured into a glass tumbler it produces a large, thick brown head with fair lacing. The color is very dark, almost black brown. The aroma is of mild earthy hops. The taste is mildly hoppy and slightly malty. The carbonation is light with a nice, smooth feel in the mouth. I prefer this among the majors one finds in the kinds of bars and restaurants one gets dragged to by ones friends, where it is often served from the nitro-can."
"this is one of my first real beers to taste appearance is very nice very dark and suttle smell abite like coffe and tast abit like coffie very robust flavor one those you need to try for yourself beers some like it or others dont maybe scared of it but very majestic for me hope this helps"
"-On a side note I remember the first time I had Guinness I just turned 21 and caught the Cramps play in Chicago at the Vic. I had like 5 of them because that's all I saw people drinking. Then I found out they also served Old Style. I switched to Old Style....bad idea. It was 85 degrees in there and I was wearing a leather jacket. Upon going outside I went on the Red Line and on the Chicago Street exit I blew Old Stlye and Guinness over the cement and bench in front of me. People just stepped over it like it wasn't a big deal. Oh the memories!"
"(D)- Always a great session beer for long movie marathons. Has the smoothness to be able to drink one after another with an adequate flavor profile to keep your attention. Basic and straightforward, but just plain good beer!"
"Drinkability - Classic, not a prize winner, but easy to consume in large amounts with different kinds of foods."
"D: If there arent any other stout options, this ones just stout enough to tide you over."
"I have to say although this beer is not great, it is pretty drinkable for sure."
"Decent for the style, but doesn't really excite me."
"Drinkability: Goes well with just about anything. This beer is a classic that is extremely drinkable. I will always reach for it."
"I love when they leave a few fingers of that famous creamy foam to let coat the glass. You either love or hate the darkness of this beverage but it does not have that coffee flavor that one might think. The mouth feel is smooth and not to thick that you can't keep the rounds coming. The nice thing about this beverage is you can have it on a hot or cold day."
"Not much going on with this. Had a large glass from tap from a hot wing chain restaurant. Looks sorta badass but really is weak and flavorless. Very dark pour, adequate head. Not a good environment for aroma so not sure it's fair to rate but didn't get much. Has a nice creaminess but was really searching for something recognizable on the taste, maybe a bit of roasted grain but didn't really get malt or hops. I finished it but didn't get another."
"D: I have literally never enjoyed Guinness, and now I think I never will. No point in wasting time and money on it in the future."
"D: Flavourless and weak. Tastes like bitter water"
"D - Goes down easy, can drink these all day!"
"Drinkability is pretty decent. I could have a few of these at one time, however I feel there are better examples of this style on the market!"
"I have had Guinness straight from the can, from the bottle, on tap. To start I would say I love guinness. A smooth creamy head with good lacing. Taste has a mild burnt flavor but the chocolate levels it all out nicely. it has a very good drinkability in my opinion. over all stout flavor is great. I prefer this stout far more then bodington's or murphy's...over great beer!"
"overall pretty weak brew, after a 5 year break, just as weak as I remembered. The time for this beer is St. Patty's Day or in a pub in ireland, otherwise I can find something better"
"4.2% ABV, tasty but not overwhelming. My idea of the perfect session beer."
"A decent beer, and it's a classic."
"In terms of drinkability, Guinness is a fairly easy drinking stout. The low ABV lends itself to a sessionable beer, and it doesn't seem too imposing. I certainly enjoy Guinness, and while the review may not do it justice, I'll take it over most beers."
" Was really disappointed in this purchase. Don't know if they changed something in the recipe or if I've just grown as a beer drinker, but this is just an average beer."
"Everyone's first step into the wide world of Stouts... A decent brew, nothing to write home about though. Great smell and how could one ever ignore that mysterious black emanating beneath the off-white two finger head... the only thing that really stands out is the drinkability. Otherwise a good beer if you are at a crappy bar and you want a decent dark beer..."
"D: oh baby this beer goes extremely smoothly i could drink this all night"
"I had this beer at multiple pubs in ireland. Before I went to Ireland I thought this beer was mediocre, I heard alot of people insult it and I'd had it once or twice. It tasted much better in Ireland on tap than America and the great dark ruby red color was amazing, the head doesn't go away until the beer is finished which i have never had in a beer, the taste was great and chocolatey in an odd way, it is filled with so many different flavors. I love to drink this beer now and is truly my favorite."
"This is not the best stout that I have ever had, but it is very enjoyable."
"Highly overrated, imo."
"D - This stuff is too easy to drink but it's not really a pleasant experience on my palate. It looks great but that's it."
"I still like it, but there's plenty of other stuff to drink. Thankfully, it is because of this beer that I realize that now."
"Overall: this is my ""pub quiz"" and before football match (the only real football guys :)) beer. I always drink it in nice ambiance in good company. The beer itself however, is not such a great experience, it is just too flat. A decent stout, but there are so many many many better ones."
"Very smooth beer. Some complain of bitterness, but I think its just right, only a slightly bitter aftertaste, which i think works with this beer great. Overall closest thing to a draft guinness you can get at home."
"Okay, had it right after the Guinness original. So it was kind of a let down after the amazing real thing. All in all, good solid dark appearance in a pilsner, with a nice creamy head. Smell and taste was a watered down version of the original with the toasted nose completely missing. Even the mouthfeel was quite ordinary - I would pass this one on."
"D: Guinness is really, really bitter. It is hard to drink if you're looking for balance at all."
"Served in a nonic. Poured two shades shy of black with some deep ruby highlights around the base of the glass. One inch, dense, solid, off-white cap eventually settled into a quarter inch head. Excellent retention with some strands of lacing revealed during the session. Nose was mild - maybe some chocolate malt, but barely detectable. Taste consistent with nose - chocolate malt with a kiss of hops to break up the flavor profile. Mouthfeel was medium/light, somewhat watery, but also creamy at the same time. Finish was fairly dry. An incredibly easy and sessionable beer, and a standard go to when the draft list is lacking."
"Pours super dark brown with a hint of red. It takes several minutes to pour a proper Guinness from a nitro tap, as the bubbles have to settle throughout. Head is thick, rich, and has a high mininiscus over the top of the glass. Nose is very toasted with coffee notes. Taste is smooth and consistently good, there are no hints of tin, skunk, or over bittered. The balance is really good and while it goes down rich, it isn't that filling. I wish I could have that quality all the time, as I would drink Guinness more."
"Decided to give the bottle a try. Pours near black with a creamy tan head. Nose has roasted malts, chocolate and not much else. Taste is quite light yet bitter. No better or worse than the can version. Body reminds me of carbonated water. Drnkable, but not very enjoyable."
"I drank 8 pints without retching. It's drinkable enough."
"Watery, plain, boring beer. I hesitate to call it a beer. I hope you have saved your money. Cheers (with a bottle of something ELSE)."
"Contrary to their popular and long-standing slogan, Guinness is not ""good for you"". It certainly isn't good for me, anyhow. The world of stout offers far more excitement and experience than this. (That includes the variety of stronger Guinness Foreign Export beers brewed for overseas markets.) Guinness may have set the benchmark for stouts - but they set it really, really low."
"This one's pretty much the same as I've had any other way except that the nitro can really adds some body and smoothness to what, without the nitro effect, is a disappointingly thin and lackluster stout in terms especially of mouthfeel. Guinness was one of my first reviews on BA and I've only just gotten to having one from the nitro bottle again to review it."
"Guinness has been a staple of my bar-going experiences ever since I've started going to bars. My very first Guinness was from a proper pub in Dublin, Ireland and it was delicious and filling. The pints I've had since here in the United States have not matched my first Guinness adventure, but I suspect that has quite a lot to do with the overall experience I had in Ireland. This is a beer I will continue to revisit as long as I drink."
"After I tried guinness extra stout and thought it was decent I figured I'd give the draught a try and what a let down it was. They mot color this beer to get that dark color because I know it's not from the amount of malts used."
"Verdict: Chances are, if you're reading this you know exactly what it's like to have a pint of Guinness Draught. Inoffensive and generally uninteresting, yet highly recognizable and iconic, it's quite the paradox. Just the kind of paradox that's perfect to ponder over a familiar pint."
"D: High marks for Drinkability here. Goes down super smooth, especially with the light carbonation."
"In some ways, this beer seems both over and under rated at the same time. It's not the meal in a can the average bud light drinker hypes it up to be (which marketers are all to happy to go along with). It also isn't terrible either. It doesn't have a big flavour by any means, but it has at least some flavour and doesn't taste bad. A good session choice when nothing else is around."
"A classic, and a must have at least once."
"Drinkability: Very good. I've gotten this several times, and I'm sure I will get it again. I really like this brew."
"the widget makes for a crazy head, the retention is seldom matched"
"(From tasting notes recorded 27 Jul 2009)"
"All in all, a basic stout thats on the lighter side, but decent nontheless. The extra stout (I think its called) is much better than this IMHO"
"D- My go to session beer when out, very easy to drink."
"Guinness Draught in the nitro-can is more of an every-once-in-a-while beer for me because i genuinely enjoy the lighter, creamier (weaker) guinness some times. most days, it's not my favorite beer, but its definately a good session pick for me. the only deterrent is the price. good beer, but not always worth the craft beer price"
"Overall, it is drinkable, but only as a last resort if there are no other good options."
"Well, first off, the appearance of this beer is likely its best feature. Beautifully black with an oh-so-creamy looking tan head. Retention is legendary and some very nice, thick lacing clings to the glass. The smell emanating from this beer is, unfortunately, somewhat muted. What I am able to discern are subtle notes of bready, buttery malts, chocolate and some coffee. Taste is more pronounced with lots of bread and butter up front with the dark roasted chocolate notes picking up mid-sip resulting in a finish that is roasty with a nice amount of bitterness from the hops. Mouthfeel is thick and very creamy with not a whole lot in terms of noticeable carbonation. This stout goes down smooth. Drinkability is another excellent quality of this beer - I feel like I could drink this stuff till the cows come home. Overall, sometimes nothing goes down like it. It could be more pronounced flavour wise. However, when you're in the mood for a silky-smooth, easy drinking stout, it's hard to beat. Truly a classic - I'd love to try it closer to the source!"
"After pouring into an ale glass, the brew produced a rich, vibrant head that is tan in color. The body of the beer is rich and dark. After the beer settled, about one-half inch of head remained. In addition, a nice layer of lace is clinging to the glass. The aroma is both malty and hoppy. The flavor is both sweet and salty with a nice essence of hops. The beer is creamy and feels very delightful in the mouth. Overall, a wonderful beer and a classic that should be used as benchmark for measuring other stouts."
"The mouthfeel is average for a stout, not a lot going on, but smooth and creamy. Drinkability is average nothing to ward you off, but not as big and bold as some others."
"D: This beer is just way too watery, it ruins it for me. Flavor and aroma are very subtle, almost bland. This is basically a marco-stout. Aroma-less, flavor-less but easily chuggable. There are too many great stout available to waste my time on this one again."
"Can- Pours a dark, black body with a thick and frothy caramel coloured head. Aroma is slightly roasted, malty, but pretty much non-descript...any aroma here is very mild. Taste is semi sweet malt flavours, with some mild roasted sugary flavours as well. Very light, and watery."
"D - Definitely a beer I can have all night long."
"its easy drinking unless the only beer you have every had is watery lager."
"First beer I've ever had on tap. Much better than in the bottle. Same taste, chocolatey and rich, but the mouth feel is so much creamier. Has a nice, soothing appeal to it as it washes down your throat. Good carbonation, enough to give it slight bitterness but not enough to keep you from enjoying the texture. If you see it on tap and have never had it before, I'd give it it a try. If you don't like Guinness in the first place it probably won't change your mind."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of roasted malts. Taste is mild and easy drinking, some roasted malts, just a touch of coffee. Feels full bodied and creamy in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer."
"On tap at Oh Shea's in Philly, 07/25/09. 90 degree heat, and the wife & I needed a rest on our way to the Mutter Museum (awesome place, especially if you like syphilis-related lesions and other medical maladies). I'm hot, tired, ready for a cold pint, something light, and Guinness would supposedly fit the bill. Overall I was disappointed. Appearance is perfect and aroma is very good, but somehow its more watery than I remember. Reading other reviews its obvious I'm not alone in my opinion. Of course considering my last review was of FBS I'm probably expecting too much. Taste is good (pleasant roasted malt bitterness), mouthfeel is silky, but there's a wateriness that dulls both and leads to point deductions. Drinkability is okay but I only had one and switched to SABL. I'll drink it again, but probably not until St. Paddy's day (and then only if Beamish isn't available)."
"Sure, one can idle away the hours while sipping or swigging, but I have no such desire."
"Gotta say, compared to the Pub Cans with the little widget, or on draft, this bottle version is spot on with the rest. I know it's actually meant to be drunk out of the bottle, and I did take a few swigs and well... it's not as good, but... it works. Really the only thing negative about this is the 11.2oz bottle. Seems to be a sneaky way of getting you to pay more for less."
"Drinkability: I've had better stouts. If offered, I'd pass this one up; if found in the fridge, I might give it a try."
"D: Very easy to drink, much like water is."
"Poured dark with a frothy, tan head that had staying power. I could smell coffee. The beer tasted remarkable similar to pool water. I swear I could even get a slight chlorine taste, that may be what some reported as coffee taste. No body. As far as drinkability; you could drink it like water too. A case of a beer being average or above in all categories but taste, so the 2.4 rating is deceiving. Definitely not recommended."
"Drinkability: though its thick body has earned it the ""liquid bread"" moniker, I can drink quite a lot of this. It goes down smooth and isn't so oppressive that I can't have another."
"It smells and taste like coffee, but compared to other stouts its very weak."
"Last time i had this in the bottle i was shocked. maybe it was just a bad case, but i think my palet has changed. this seemed more watery and empty than i remember. Its still an ok beer, and i still like it better than other ""macro"" beers, but this is jumping down on my list, while the on tap version moved up a little."
"Funny, a few years ago, I would have said Guinness was a good beer - oh education"
"D - Quite OK overall probably would have one but not more thatn that"
"From a can. Once poured, a nice dark appearance with a foam top. It has a nice smooth bitter taste throughout with a distinct roast flavor that leaves an aftertaste. Creamy and not thin. Overall good choice for any occasion and one of the better commercial beers."
"Guiness Extra Stout is one of my favorite beers. This beer is only good for introducing people to something other than standard yellow fiz. I'm really dissapointed with this brew."
"D- This really is an awesome ""kick-back"" beer. Great for those hot days. Hard to believe that 250 years after Arthur gave this gift to the world that Guinness is still kicking ass. Cheers!"
"Most of the finer restaurants I frequent may not have a good selection of microbrews bit they generally do have Guinness on tap. ""Settling"" for a pint of Guinness is not a difficult choice."
"What can I say about the beer that piqued my interest in something other then BMC. It looks fantastic in a glass. The head is enormous and the color is dark brown almost bordering on black. The smell is faint caramel with hints of malt. The flavor is similar to ice coffee. Hardly any trace of alcohol. It's as smooth as` water going down. Which is why I like to start my evening with one or three of these. I enjoy this beer even if it's not real sophisticated."
"D- I put down alot of these guys do due the calorie and carb content, compared to most light beers I've tasted I'm actually quite happy this stuff is available all over, good weekday beer. As far as ""taste"" goes, not good not bad ...it's ok but I still drink around 5-8 cans a week. /shrug"
"In truth I think Guinness has earned a place in my heart as one of my favorite beers. On tap I don't think I would rather drink much of anything else. Its very complex in the sense of its different levels and craft. Even though it is considered a fairly commercial beer it still has that craft and care feeling everytime you drink one...Slainte to the Irish"
"11.2 oz brown nitro-bottle obtained at Hannaford's Supermarket in Derry, NH. dark brown to black color with ruby red highlights and an inch of light beige head. Slighty sweet smell, chocolate malts, tobacco, bark, a little roasty. coffee taste with a slight chocolate taste. strong tobacco after taste. the mouthfeel is slightly watery and thin.there are a few astringent tastes that ruin the drinkability of the beer. if you like light beers that tastes like the aftertaste when smoking a cigarette then this brew is for you!"
"On tap at Brit's British-Style Pub in Minneapolis June 17, 2009. Thick creamy head - lacing throughout finish. Flavorful, thin and very smooth. Highly drinkable and just a good beer - something different and definitely hits the spot on a warm, sunny day - cheers!"
"I don't care much for this style in general, but for what it is this isn't terrible. Boring, for sure, but drinkable."
"D= Very drinkable but ultimately disappointing. However, though there are better examples of dry Irish stout out there, this is not awful and quite often its the best thing on the menu so I have certainly sessioned a few."
"this is not even worth a proper review. mouthfeel horrible, not much for smell, and ive seen it in a glass.... cascading blah blah blah. its a nitro. it sucks. watery/creamy? its like half carbonated stale chocolate milk and a hint of bird shit. if you have never tried it... dont"
"Take an iced chocolate coffee, let the ice melt-add soda water and then let it sit and go flat for 48 hours. Then you will have brewed your own Guinness draught."
"Some charred barley, but like most from this style it is on the easy drinking, creamy, laid back. Watered down, tart taste, milky mouthfeel, and the drinkability is average just because I can't see myself looking forward to this or pursuing it any time soon. Once again another brew I'd prefer to try on tap, without the nitro blasting ball, but for this review in a can its simply uneventfull."
"Had this on tap tonight from a place with a pretty limited selection. Man, I don't recall Guinness tasting so, well, bad. Guess its been years and my tastes have come a long way as I used to enjoy this. It just seemed watery, flavorless, and, quite boring actually. The look is still there - a nice black with a brownish-black foam. The aroma is there. But the taste just wasn't. Its like drinking a good stout, diluted with about 5 parts water. Its black water."
"D: Easy to quaff, not boozy in the least bit. Sessionable, for sure, but there are many other great sessionable stouts that are more complex and flavorful. Still, a classic entry stout, and nothing can beat that gorgeous cascade effect from a freshly pulled pint.  Easily, Guinness Draught is in its best form coming off of a nitro-tap."
"Drinkability- overall pretty good, haven't had much lately but still pretty good"
"A good beer. It is the standard of Ireland after all, but I'd pay $6 for a draft pint any day of the week. As long as the can is near room temperature the subtle taste and aroma will show much better than the ice-cold recommendation. Personally, a little more salt (such as what you find in a Beamish), would really highlight this stout well. Can't have St. Paddy's Day without it!"
"D - A basically good stout, above average for the style - I would probably pick this if in the mood for a dry stout."
"its best quality by far is its appearance, wow very impressive. when i was trying this beer i wasn't really in the mood for its style, but who turns down a free beer? that is the reason i didn't give it a lower rating. i can see when i would be in the mood for this kind of beer, maybe on a different occasion. overall a better then average beer."
"D- Very good. Bland, but very sessionable."
"Feel is the other bright point, I like the full, creamy body to it. Too bad it's so low on aroma and flavor--for any style of beer. Not a beer I'll choose to come back to often. I'd like to try more of the Dry Irish Stout style to compare."
"Pours an almost pitch black with ruby red highlights. Smell is faintly of coffee. Taste is of roasted malt, not much body, and a hint of hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is light, gross tasting nitro finish. Drinkability is pretty good, the low alcohol and decent flavor make this a good beer when there are no other choices. I would not seek this out specifically, but its ok every once in awhile."
"The taste is not what you expect. It's very thick in the mouth, but thin tasting. Slightly chocolatey with a bitter end. None of the sweetness in the nose."
"Overall this beer is a middle of the road irish dry stout, nothing to write home about, but always a good standby when other options are lacking."
"Drinkability: Just like water... good that it is only 4.2%..."
"d- this wouldn't be my first pick out of the fridge, i can see the drinkability and great popularity of this, but just isn't for me."
"Had this guy poured from one of the 16 oz cans into a talll beer mug. I have no idea why so many people score this low on appearance -it's a very nice looking beer. Solid black with a thick, creamy, half inch tan head that stays the whole time leaving massive amounts of lacing. Amber bubbles that go backwards due to the whole nitro tap thing... How could this score under 4.5? Smells great at first, roasted malt, a bit of chocolate. Very inviting. Tastes very dry ( as is appropirate) with a bit of roasted malt flavor and a clean finish. The mouthfeel is nothing but creamy. As it warms the smell proves to be less complex as you might hope for in this style, but it's still pleasant. This is a very drinkable beer -it deserves its global following I think."
"There is no need to do a review....I don't drink Guinness that much over here, even though I think it's a great beer out of the can and from the odd pub that has it on tap here, but in Dublin, I had it just about with every meal and it's amazing. Really a pleasure to have! And the bartenders ALL know how to properly pour a pint, unlike over here....just saying!"
"Serving suggestion: Nitro-tap pour (by a bartender that knows how to pour Guinness correctly) into an authentic Guinness pint glass. A thing of beauty."
"Drinkability's always good on a Guinness."
"Taste: Slightly bitter taste with a roasted coffee flavor. Thinner then the appearance may give away but to has a good mouthfeel."
"The draught however can't compare to the specialty."
"Drinkability - due to the smooth nature and relatively low ABV, a great session beer."
"Is fearr tu de Guinness!"
"This is the stout for the masses, really. But its appeal as thick, solid lord of dark matter is hype, not reality. In actuality it makes me want to retch the more I drink. It's bitter and unpleasant without being complex. Not all that."
"Mouthfeel: After such a dense head the actual body is very light, with a creamy carbonation."
"D. Wouldn't deny another but wouldn't be first choice."
"D: I know people like to hate on the nitro bottle, but it seemed to me to be a pretty close approximation of the draught experience-in other words, solid but underwhelming. It's OK for an oocasional change of pace, but I'd never make it my go-to beer."
"This is straight from the bottle. Says so right on the lable. ""DRINK STRAIGHT FROM THE BOTTLE"". So that is what I did. What a let down. It's not even possible for me to explain the let down. Whatever the gizmo does it doesn't make drinking this stout from the bottle enjoyable. No foam in the mouth, rather thin as a matter of fact. No great flavor, sort of watery. I don't know, just don't expect anything , and ""DON'T DRINK STRAIGHT FROM THE BOTTLE""."
"Guinness is never my first choice at a bar, but not a bad beer if there's nothing else. It's quality and a very distinguished taste. The experience of ordering a Guinness with the head and watching it change colors, is better than actually drinking it unfortunately. The coffee type flavor is nice, but the beer could really use more alcohol. It can hardly be called a stout at 4.2% abv. If they boosted it up to 6 or 7% it would be a much better beer I feel."
"Nice flavor of slightly burnt malts. A bit thin perhaps but not nearly as watery as I've seen on tap at times which helps the feel and drink. Nice medium body and smooth flavor without the bitterness I've experienced at times on tap as well. The can I assume is universal. Alas, the can is a good vehicle to enjoy a Guinness without the expense of travel, though at a slight cost in flavor to a good pour near the source."
"This beer goes down very smoothly, but there's not enough to it that I'm really enjoying drinking it: I would probably have another in a sitting, if it's the best thing on tap. Overall this beer is nice, but everything about it is too mild. Plenty of other stouts (irish dry or otherwise) that are every bit as easy drinking but pack a better flavour punch."
"Pours a beautiful deep black with a stellar nitro head that looks like a fluffy pillow of goodness. Smells of roasted malts and a hint of ethanol. Taste is very underwhelming, if I had my eyes closed I'd think I were drinking bud light. Tastes like a watered down version of a roasted malt tea. Body is lighter than I thought it would be. Drinkability is average, I can see it being easy to throw a few of these back without being bogged down."
"I guess this is what we have to put up with in the states. Apparently, mass production outside of Ireland has harmed the recipe of this classic. I hope to one day try the real thing."
"What happened! Over the past ten years (my drinking career) it seems as though this beer has been getting worse and worse. Guinness' were my first beers and they were fantastic. Now the inconsistent, anything but black color, and weak head are breaking my heart. The smell is gone and the smooth creamy taste is more of a metallic sip of tap water!? I loved this beer and feel personally wronged by those who have watered down this liquid tradition. The only remenant of the old Guinness is the way the nitro makes it feel when you drink it, but the mouthfeel simply can't stand alone."
"Overall: It's OK. They've built an empire on reputation. I like Guinness but it doesn't really stack up nowadays with so many other options."
"if you are committed to drinking the regular guinness draught, opt for the cans or if you must stick with the brand, buy the extra stout in bottles instead, but in all honesty, do yourself a favor and buy a more flavorful stout."
"D--I drank three pints pretty fast, but I think that's because I kept searching for flavor. Nowhere near the Extra Stout in the bottle, and can't hold a shaky whimpering candle to O'Hara's on-tap. If you want real IDS from the country of origin and it's available, grab that one. Still, if I had a bucket of oysters on a nice Spring day...I'd probably still look for O'Hara's, or pick up a sixer of Smutty's Robust Porter (which is really a stout, I think)."
"It pours a deep brown to light black in color. The classic cascading action of Guiness followed when it was poured into the glass. There is a white tone to the beer as it churns and then it culminates in a thick frothy head. Very smooth flavor, even if its unremarkable to some. It has just a slight hint of roasted malts and grains, but you almost have to be searching for it. As I mentioned it is very tough to grade an old standard that is so familiar. You could certainly find a lot of beers that don't stack up to guiness. You could also find many that are superior."
"M/D- Silky finish with light carbonation almost flat mouth feel. Overall not worth the hype or cost for me."
"The taste is similar, being mostly water with light burnt toast and very faint hints of soil & coffee. It's watery, thin, and bland, so boring it's barely even one dimensional. However, it is not actually unpleasant and it's easy to drink. Even when not too chilled (and many seem to want it cold, confusingly), it still lacks any character whatsoever."
"D - It's always easy to put a few back. Going down, you barely feel it. Most experienced BAs could probably down a couple pints of this and go for a 5K run a half-hour later with little to no discomfort. Drinkability is high. What? Hey, shut up. You know you'll drink the hell out of this in certain situations. Don't even fight it."
"M&D-Kind of thin for a stout and very straightforward. Smooth and easy to drink tho."
"Cheers!"
"This beer always finds its way onto my list of good solid ""go to"" beers, can't go wrong with a pint of the black stuff when at a good Irish Pub. Also goes very well with chocolate desserts."
"D - Nice light bodied stout that consistently shows up in my fridge."
"This beer is definately better on tap, but from the can, still not bad."
"D - I enjoyed this more than usual on this particular night, but unfortunately Guinness is something that I only seem to settle for when nothing else of interest is available on tap. It drinks pretty well overall, but there are just so many other good stouts out there."
"Overall, this is one of my all time favorites. It's just a great beer that is widely available. Great starter beer for some."
"D - Moderate drinkability. Low ABV is a charm to manage, but the carbonation is more filling than most. Palette fatigue is starting to set in - the sour tones get a bit old after a while."
"-Haven't had any other true Irish dry stouts, so this beer will be my benchmark for future reviews of the style. Hopefully, these future tastings will be better experiences."
"D- Gets better as it warms while the chocolate comes out more. Next time I order this I'll just wait till it gets to that point."
"D: Probably one of the easier to drink dry stouts."
"its a good stout.. but not the best.. if bartender is good you get to see the bubble dance and the creamy head.. it is dark brown alomst balk looking.. smell is just an average stout.. nothign popping out .. taste lil roasted notes i taste leaves the muoth feeling with minal after taste.."
"After Thoughts: Seems Guinness has fallen victim to the corporate juggernaut. This is good beer, but I would no longer say it is a great beer."
"(D) Always a good brew."
"D- Easy to drink, very smooth. There are better stouts out there though."
"The cascading effect is cool, but it doesn't last very long. I'll gladly take Extra Stout over this any day."
"I must say I have an old feeling for Guinness, it is the first real beer I ever had and I still love the taste"
"It's one of the first dark beers I got into, and it's funny I used to think it was a big beer. I'm actually impressed now by how light and easy it is to drink. Fun to drink for the novelty or on St. Patrick's Day, but there are numerous other stouts I'd take over this one."
"I love the look of this pour. The black body and the brown castcading head is a sight. Aroma has a light molasses/coffee. Somewhat of a salty acidic flavor with a watery texture and a dry finish. I see this beer as a stand alone, meaning I would drink a glass but I wouldn't drink glass after glass."
"Good beer for listening to brewing network live shows like the session."
"D- Very drinkable. You could stick with this one all night easily."
"Drinkability is tremendous, now that it doesn't feel as thick. I could drink these forever."
"I'll preface this by saying that Guinness on tap is among my favorite beers. However, this review is of the nitro-bottle draught and it is sorely lacking. The look is very close as well as the smell. The taste is almost a flat, watered down version of the original. After drinking Guinness extensively on tap, I'm very comfortable saying that from the tap is the only way to fly."
"Just not as good as the original original."
"A classic beer and the one that ushered me into the world of beers outside of marco-lagers. While this one no longer compares to what I would call a world class beer, it will always be a special one for me."
"(its true, the best stuff is in dublin and it makes sense. i found this beer to be very drinkable while i was over there, maybe because its everywhere. but i can go for another, and another, another one of these, and it sits in the stomach great. great with a wide variety of foods as well.)"
"Overall I would say that this is a beer that I really enjoy. It is not the best of style and I do not go seeking this beer out but it taste great and is very easy to drink. Great default beer at BMC bars, you can find this beer almost anywhere."
"D: Drinkable because of its lack of heft, This beer is much lighter in body and flavor than even 5 years ago. More of a period piece and nostalgic with the lack of craftsmanship."
"D: Mild flavor and relatively low alcohol make this one of the more easily drinkable stouts."
"Can. Pours a solid black with the beautiful Guinness head. The aroma isn't as powerful as some, but there is some roasted barley and maybe a hint of coffee. A very fine carbonation with a very creamy mouthfeel. The feel can definitely throw people off if they have never had a beer of this nature before (i.e. mass produced crap). The palate follows the nose, with notes of roasted barley, a little coffee, and surprisingly light. Gentle bitterness and a definite dry quality. This one is famous and rightly so. Solid, not very complex, but the perfect gateway into better beer drinking."
"Nothing beats it on tap in Ireland, but this will have to do."
"Low in alcohol, smooth on the tongue, and inoffensive on the palate, Guinness makes one of the greater quaffs available virtually worldwide, making it a perfect fallback and one of the pinnacles of session beer-dom."
"Drinkability: It's Saint Paddy's Day, so what can I say? The drinkability is high, and it has that distinctness to make it appealing, but to me it's the ""lite"" version of stout. Maybe it's because I've only had it from nitro bottles and cans. Directly from the keg, as a ""draught," is the ideal way to drink it. Directly from the keg in Ireland would be perfect."
"It's hard to knock the appearance of the beer. That creamy two finger nitro head looks damn sexy. Unfortunately from there it's all down hill. The smell and taste are very tame and watered down. Only a slight chalky roastiness to it."
"Drinkability - this is a one-glass deal for me. It's not something I can pound away on."
"D- Could have a bunch. Good for an Irish holiday."
"D: This is one of my favorite Irish beers and seeing as how it's St Patti's day Im going to have a few. This beer is a classic, and it is very different. The one downside is it's quite filling"
"Can't truly enjoy St. Patty's Day without the obligatory Guinness! Served with the beautiful waterfall effect, the beer quickly settles to an almost opaque black with a frothy egg-shell head. Aroma is slight roasted malts. Taste is the usual dry roasty flavor I always expect, subtle, yet delicious. The beer is very light and well carbonated. Of course, Guinness is always great when the mood hits."
"Drinkability is ok. Low ABV. Nothing about this beer impresses me enough to want more though."
"Drinkability: Probably the lightest Irish dry stout on the market, as well as the most marketable. It's easy to see how this beer does well: a body similar to Bud Light, and a flavor that's rich and roasty. Definitely easy to drink, but there are so, so, so many better Irish stouts out there."
"A good clean guinness is the most refreshing of beers."
"Mouthfeel is nice and smoot, very drinkable."
"Purchased a four pack of cans. Why? Don't know but will say that when you open the can and pour it into a glass it is impressive. Nice black beer with a heavy, creamy head and lots of nitro bubbles. Unfortumately, not much aroma. A little bit of roasted malt. Taste - weak, kind of bland. Once again, a little malt comes through, no hops (do they even ue hops in the beer?)."
"D: very drinkable, and light. the nitro makes this go down smoothly with little gas filling you up."
"D: Very easy to drink, with an appealingly soft mouthfeel. It's certainly not robust or full-bodied, and I can't really say this is a great beer, but once in awhile I just have a craving for something like this, and it gets the job done."
"So you can't really review this by pouring. The nitrogen widget inside the bottle lets out a small amount of nitrogen each time it is tipped to try to replicate a mini draft each time so by pouring the entire bottle out at once, you kinda lose the point of having this bottle. However, the can is intended to be poured and will not be correct out of the can. So with that said, I think this is better than most reviews. Definitely not the best stout in the world, but I enjoy it as a lighter feeling dark beer with a unique taste that is easy to drink."
"D - For a stout, its very drinkable and at least for me its not to filling."
"Drinkability- Amazingly session able and quafible, a great beer so unique so soft smooth and creamy, a great occasional unique visit i love this beer so much for all it is, great and a classic, unique and hall of fame worthy"
"D: always mixed feelings about this brew. I respect, and yet, loathe this beer in some ways. Last I was in Ireland I put on my ""Guinness Drinking Shoes"" and they were soaked by the end of the trip. I grew tired in some ways of this staple and yet if I get the chance to have it, I never pass on it"
"I feel like this beer is one of the best beers out of a can. It has such a nice pour and head, goes down smooth and tasty, and leaves you drooling for more. Plus I can almost say that it tastes better in the nitro-can than it does out of the tap but i must emphasize the word almost."
"In that sense not worth it, but by the same token Guinness is a Godsend in those situations where you get dragged to some dive bar, and all they have is BMC or Guinness."
"Drinkability- This beer is quite thick and filling, so depending on your tolerance is might fill you up pretty quick."
"All that said. This is still an all-time favorite of mine. Even if for only sentimental reasons."
"One of my all time favorite beers. I should be a little more descriptive on the taste, but it is a true original in my book."
"drinkability- despite the average taste and mouthfeel it is really fairly drinkable due to the fact it isn't to filling and it has a low ABV"
"D: Incredibly drinkable. I reject the premise that Guinness is filling - maybe when I was a freshman in college it was, but now it's like water."
"My overall view, I might have got a bad bottle. It tasted rather watered down, and was rather weak compared to other stouts I've had. The appearance was great (and yes I know to pour 2/3 of the bottle, let it setle, then pour the rest) but the flavor was just not up to par. I poured it down the drain."
"Black in color and a frothy milkshake head on retrieval, had to let settle before consumption. Two minutes elapse. Dismal aromatics, some robust malt, a hint of coffee and chocolate can be detected as well. Gulp. Thick as brick, smooth on the intake. Taste of some roast coffee and the dark bitter chocolate come into play. The thickness of the beer make the gulp factor nonexistent. This is the goto beer if its twelve noon on st. patty's day, you're Irish, are you're in one of their establishments. The choice is yours, recommended on those factors alone. Tis the season...."
"Impressive pour, that little nitro tablet did job quite well I must say. When it was all said and done there was a nice finger of head a top the black colored stout. Nose is malty and rich, but only slight roasty and altogether mild for a stout. Flavor is good, but not great, the dark roasted malts come through a bit earthy. The body is lighter than I was expecting and the nitro show is over leaving it a bit, well, flat. Overall is not to bad and the drinkability is fair. The best part was the initial show however."
"Mouthfeel was thin but silky. All of the carbonation was in the head, not the body."
"Not black. Indeed, I've had darker porters. And those with more taste too. It has a bitterness that puts some people off, but without it I fear there would be not much to taste. However, this is a drinkable stout, and, in my area (New York) affordable. On sale, in glass, it's about $1.10 for the 11.2 oz (9.8 cents per oz). In the cans, I just got it for about $1.12 for 14.9 oz (7.5 cent per oz). So, it's about 90 cents per 3/4 pint while cheap beer is 66 cents- not much more. Even though it's watered down, it's cheap for stout and the only one in my area. It's an affordable beer, widely available, with great branding. My favorite part though is the pouring of the glass ""draught"" Guinness into a glass and watching the bubbles- it is the most beautiful of beers."
"D: Easy to drink and enjoy."
"It's easy to drink as nothing is overpowering, but perhaps that's also its downside - I think it lacks a bit of character. But it tastes earthy, it's very creamy, has slight coffee and chocolate notes and has very little carbonation. Slightly bitter finish."
"D: Watered-down, bitter aftertaste. Nitro-bottle no where near the same as a Guinness on tap."
"A dry, medium bodied beer with light carbonation. Has its moments but nothing exciting. I probably wouldn't want another, in fact I'm reminded why I haven't tried this in so long. Seems completely overpriced to me and just not worth it."
"Drinkability? It's very easy drinking (so that's certainly not a problem) with the caveat that I wouldn't go out of my way to buy more but if it's on tap with the usual macro suspects, I'd go for it."
"D - low alcohol and a pleasant (if mundane) flavor make this a beer you can drink forever."
"Overall, not a bad stout, but certainly not the best there is. Still, I would say that Guiness is one of the best international macros in the world."
"Note: I realized that my original review wasn't objective, so I altered the ratings to ignore my feeling of the style."
"D- Very drinkable. Light and low alcohol. Makes for a good session."
"Overall, hey, it's Guinness - mild stout flavours and an easy quaffing quotient make it a reliable option for a session of whiskey and ale interlacing. Add in the decidedly un-American ABV levels, and you're good to go, once you convince your eyes that this is not actually heavy in the slightest."
"Enjoy straight from the bottle? Sorry, but I'm doing a review so this is going in the pint glass. Wait a minute.. what is that clicking? Upon looking at the bottle there is apparently some sort of rocket contraption in here that will allow me to enjoy this as if it were served on tap.. well, here goes nothing. Pours a dark black with a creamy white head and the standard brownish alive cool looking action in the beer before it settles to black with the cream head that lasts. This is not lacing, as the beer moves from the glass the creamy composition of the head literally stays on the glass. Smells of coffee and faint chocolate. Tastes primarily of watered down coffee, a faint chocolate and a little nutty. The beer feels both creamy and watery, no carbonation. The Guinness Stout products I've had are robust and full of flavor, this is relatively very watered down. At least it looks cool."
"D: the ultimate session beer."
"The mouthfeel suffers as well due to the watering down. It's creamy, yes, but definitely not what it can and should be. Carbonation is pretty much non-existent. I couldn't drink more than a pint of this on any given night - it's just not my thing. There's nothing really to it."
"D- Depends on specific taste. I personally would only enjoy one or two guinness in a setting but I have heard of some that make it a session beer. Overall this is the world standard for stout beer that isn't the best one out there but certainly is worth a try."
"This is lower in carbs and calories than Budwieser. This is MY lawnmower beer. I can drink it all day and maintain. I can cook with it on March 17th, and plow through it for 15 hours until I move to Baileys on ice around March 18th at 5AM. My American heart pumps Irish blood, and this beer would be my desert island choice. Slainte!"
"D 1.0 - I poured this out, terrible example of a stout, I would not drink this for free - seriously - I am not trying to slam this beer but its undrinkable in my opinion."
"I had to come to the rescue of this beer, and the pride of the Irish in general. First of all, don't drink this out of a bottle or can, it will taste like crap. This review is solely based on my experience with Guinness, straight from the tap in a classic Irish pub in Dublin, which I assure you is quite different than cracking open a can and pouring it into an Irish Car Bomb. Now,Guinness on tap in CA is crap, in New York it's pretty good, in western Ireland is pretty damn good, and in Dublin is fucking amazing. The appearance is thick, like motor oil, with a beautifully dense creamy head. The smell is a bit hard for me to detect, but it's the classic ""stout"" smell, if you catch my drift. The taste was absolutely wonderful, thick, creamy, chocolatey. The drinkability can be judged by the general happiness and hospitality of the Irish people, who rightfully use this as their lifeblood to write poems, carry on amazing traditional music sessions, and appreciate nature. Ok ok, am I rambling here? To conclude, drink this in Dublin from a pint poured by an expert barman, rather than out of a can or in a car bomb. That'll be all, now."
"The beer is very drinkable, and legendary Guinness is outstanding!"
"For 35 a case, there are other beers I would rather drink, but I keep a 6 pk on hand for those nights where i just want a creamy smooth stout."
"4) Not as good when served in a bottle. When it doesn't have the gas release widget to give it that creamy effect, its just not as good."
"It pours black with some ruby highlights when held up to light. It has a beautiful off white head that lasts throughout. The nose is nothing over powering, but there are hints of chocolate and licorice. The taste is much like the nose, except with a touch of coffee. This beer is rather easy to drink as the taste is nothing overpowering. The mouthfeel in the nitro-bottle is somewhat thin especially compared to this on tap. While this was a decent drinking experience there are much better stouts out there which I would rather spend my money and time drinking."
"Pours black with a cool-looking, cascading-foam effect that eventually leaves a one-finger light yellow/gray cap. Slight lacing. Smells faintly of slightly sweet dark. If I strain I think I get a bit of coffee/chocolate, but that may be wishful thinking. Tastes similarly weakly, though slight bittersweet chocolate comes through. Really mild and just plain characterless."
"I was clearly not impressed with Guinness to say the least. The appearance made it look promising, but that was probably the only good thing about the beer. There was no smell to it, the taste was blah, and the mouthfeel wasn't very good. Maybe it's me, but I didn't feel this was a drinkable beer on its own. As part of a Irish Car Bomb or a fresh pint from a pub in Ireland, maybe. Not so here in the States. I'm not likely to buy a six pack of Guinness anytime in my future."
"Notes: guinness is pretty ""wet"" for a stout. i appreciate irish style and it will always have a special place in my heart but it is probly the most drinkable of stouts. not much aroma or taste. i used to drink it quite a bit and dont recall it tasting this impotent. great introduction to the style."
"served in a 25 oz mug, miles of head, beautiful lacing. weak almost non-existent smell, tastes like guinness, caramelly,and smooth. can't really know this beer, its not the best stout out there, but its probally converted more bmc drinkers than any other beer."
"D- This is definitely best on tap. Cans and bottles don't do this justice. Luckily, it's available at many beers making it a good fallback. Although sessionable, the sweetness becomes a bit cloying after a couple."
"This was my first stout and I still love to have a few every once in a while. I have moved on to other stouts and I hope to have one in Ireland but this is the one I always base my comparison on."
"I still need to get out to Ireland and drink the original there!"
"Someone once told me if you buy Guinness, make sure it's in the can. +1 to that. Don't bother with the bottles."
"Overall - this isn't Guinness. If you want a good version of the Draught style, get it on tap. If you want good Guinness, get the Extra Stout."
"D_Light aftertaste leaves more to be desired and the light body all lead to high repeatability, however the mouthfeel is too much to overcome"
"D- Not a beer that I find myself going after too often, but once in a while it hits the spot."
"Pretty smooth, a little heavy but still fairly drinkable."
"Had a bottle at my parents' house for Christmas. Beer looks like a monster - deep brown, almost black color with a nice off-white head that leaves excellent lacing. Unfortunately, other than the appearance, there's not much exceptional about this brew. Nose and flavor are very mild, smooth dry roasted flavor. Not a lot going on. Body's a little thinner than it should be, for a stout (and especially for the ""meal"" that Guinness always claims to be), although it's not bad by any means. Overall, it's mostly just uninteresting."
"Ordered this on tap at a restaurant. Back a few years ago, it was the first beer I had that I enjoyed drinking. I still enjoy the beer on the rare occasion that I order it now, but there are much better beers out there. The appearance was a nearly opaque black color. The head was medium sized and stayed around for a while--minimal lacing. It smelled of malts and cardboard. The taste was slightly bland. It tasted of chocolate and coffee. The carbonation was perfect, but it was slightly watery. Its also a decently drinkable beer, but I crave a better beer while I drink Guinness Draught."
"I could still see myself drinking quite a bit of this though, while it isn't deep or in any way exceptional, it can be enjoyable for what its worth. Low alcohol content also helps."
"D: Guinness is a very nostalgic brew for me. I fondly remember having it in Ireland and I don't care what anyone says, it does taste better there. It is a gateway beer and for that reason alone, I think it deserves more respect than it gets. It's a pretty subtle drink that can be pounded. I know that from experience as a kid. I wouldn't go out of my way to drink it anymore but when I do have a reason to drink it, it sure does bring back good memories."
"Given that it is designed to drank out of the bottle, 1 for appearance. Smell is almost non-existent, but when I get a whiff, it is empty and skunky and gross. 1. Taste (if any) is flat, watery, and every sip is forced down. Feel is so terrible I wish I could give it a negative 10. Feels like cough medicine - the texture is just weird. Horrible, horrible drink."
"Ok the famous Guinness, well It looks real pretty in the glass all black and stuff,with that creamy head. A nice subtle roasted malt aroma with a hint of cardboard. The flavor is a creamy chocolate,burnt malt,maybe a little tobacco,not really much flavor at all for a stout,drinkable but there are much better stouts locally."
"4/4/4/3/10 (2.5/5)"
"D - This is a very easy to drink beer, it's the type of beer that you'll get attached to without being an excellent one."
"Conan O'brien jokes as this beer being ""liquified pumpernickel bread"""
"Drinkability: I'll continue to drink this beer. Its amazing with desserts and even by itself. Moderately priced and available almost everywhere."
"This is good, easy drinkin', great drinkability, quality quaff."
"D- I could easily drink a bunch in a single sitting. I don't buy into the bashing, but it isn't really stellar either."
"Was my first can in ages of this stuff, hope it was only a bad can. Not representative at all of the stout genre, stay away."
"(rated Aug 17, 2008)"
"Summary- They aren't kidding about ""ice cold," the only way this beer is reasonable is almost frozen. That said, I was pretty disappointed at the change from how I remembered it in my youth. I guess I'll have to pick up some Extra Stout and see if that is at least Ok."
"The smell is metalic. Coppery. Followed by artificial sweetness. The flavor begins follows and ends a watery mess of diacatyl and burnt sugar. No body. Even with the rich head there is no more to this beer than the glass of water I have next to it. Drinkability? The metalic taste in the smell becomes overpowering. It drinks like medecine. What a shame."
"Cheers!"
"very drinkable would get higher marks if it had a bit more flavor though"
"Is this the gold standard of canned stouts? Pours a beautiful dark brown with cascading bubbles and a creamy tan head. Nitro can weakens the taste and aroma. Nice cococa powder and metal in the nose. Milkshake mouthfeel and taste. Lots of cocoa and carob. Enjoyable."
"And yet... I'll drink it again - you know I will. When I have to go out and have a drink with a buddy to talk serious talk and it's going to take a while, well, we should be drinking 4% beer. So this is OK enough for that. Not great. Not even good. But drinkable in its context."
"It has its iconic appearance, pitch black mixed with its cream-colored head. Smell and taste are slightly bitter and dry, with roasted malt... but it is not easily detectable. Flat mouthfeel with almost no carbonation. This beer somehow has a reputation as being strong when in reality it is not any stronger than the light pale lagers next to it on the taps. It is a good beer to have once in a while, but not much more than an average beer and far below average for a stout."
"I've never enjoyed this beer quite as much as others. It's always tasted a little watery to me when compared to other stouts, especially Guinness's own extra stout. It looks particularly fantastic from the can with the huge, foamy head and the deep black color. The pour is enjoyable. Smells alright as well. But the taste still tastes watery and lacks the thick, creamy feel that I look for in a good stout."
"Drinkability: Wow, this beer surprised me. I wasn't too big on the Extra Stout (guess it isn't my style) and was expecting not to like this too much. However, this ended up being a very good beer that I would love to have again. Absolutely great and I cannot understand all the haters for the life of me."
"Bought a nitro-can Guinness and a nitro-can Beamish and did a taste test. Both poured from the cans with the usual ""hiss"" of the nitro pellet in a nice foamy stream. Both looked about the same in the glass (once settled) with a massive rich foamy head on top (the Beamish a bit more tan and the Guinness more gray) and a deep brown to black (with ruby highlights) below. Little carbonation visible. Smell was similar, just a touch of smoky malts. Initial tastes were quite different. Beamish was smooth in the mouth, with a well balanced, drinkable mix of malt flavors and a hint of sweetness that made it very easy to drink--top to bottom. The Guinness was similar, but with a bit more hops bitterness that soon turned to a metallic hint of alcohol as it warmed. Definitely enjoyed both of them (who wouldn't) but the Beamish was a tad bit better, IMHO."
"there is nothing wrong with drinking guinness"
"An old standby that I grabbed for the holidays, easy drinking and well rounded."
"Looks great in the glass, with the tan bubbles slowly subsiding, yielding the jet black brew, and the fluffy, airy head holding it delicate stucture seemingly forever. The yin-yang of the fluffy head and the rich brew on the tongue. Unfortunately, I find the taste less overwhelming, a standard, straightforward flavor of strongly roasted, nearly burnt malt with a bitter chocolate bitterness."
"D - The smooth taste and low ABV means you can easily down several pints. Though among the 'big 3' I prefer Beamish, you can't go wrong with Guiness. Sure, it's not the most complex or flavorful stout - but it's readily available, reliable and highly drinkable."
"A pretty good beer in terms of how widely available it is, but definitely not one of the better stouts I've had."
"Pours very dark, almost black with a nice tan head. I would like a bit more carbonation. The prominent taste is that of bitter coffee, however, it is not overpowering. Even though I do not particularly like the taste, it is a smooth beer and one that is easy to drink."
"I did not particularly like this. It poured a dark cloudy color with a off white head. Had a weird mouth feel to me and a pretty bitter aftertaste. There was just something off with this for me. Not one that I would rush off to buy again. The stout is much better than this."
"Pours a dark brown-black color body, with a big slightly off-white head. Not much aroma. Taste has some malts, a thick roasted flavor, creamy mouthfeel, with a bitter aftertaste. But not too complex a flavor profile."
"Guinness is my favourite beer. Available in most pubs and always a good stout. Quite filling and apparently can be good for you, being fairly high in iron and everything. If there's nothing else worth having there is always a good Guinness. Good stout this one."
"Overall: well, this isnt the best stout out there, certainly; but it has a nice appearance, and it has some distinct flavors and somekind of character that I like. Served cold it is a fine beer."
"D - Very high drinkability with this one. It's a nice smooth beer with not a very strong flavor, and goes down nice. Would be a decent introduction to those unfamiliar with dark, more strongly flavored beers."
"D - You can drink a fair amount of this beer. It's ABV is lower than average and while somewhat boring still drinkable, a decent session brew."
"D: Drinks like a champ. Not a big fan of the beer or the style but it does have its place."
"Guinness is generally my go to at macro bars, when it's winter, and there are no other options. I wouldn't say I dislike the beer, though I don't love it, as you always know what you're getting. It's smooth, light, and at least brings some flavor to the table."
"Drinkability is super due to the low carbonation and low abv. Good beer to drink when you want a break from hop bombs or high abv beer."
"This is a difficult beer for me to rate as it was my gateway beer and I will always have a special place for it. Despite my introduction to craft beer, a cold Guinness straight from the tap is still one of the most satisfying beer-drinking experiences I can think of. However, I will try, as always, to rate the beer based on how the beer represents the style, and what the brewer intended the beer to taste like, and, to a weighted degree, my personal preference - not just any one of the aforementioned aspects. End disclaimer"
"Can. Pours a dark body with about a one inch thick head. Not a lot of aroma, some sweet malts and that's about it. Not a whole lot of flavor either. Some malts and a tad bit of caramel if you really dig. Medium body. Light but full mouth feel. The most refreshing beer out there."
"Althought I didn't like it enough to order another I can definately see how you could drink a ton of this stuff. Its smoothness coupled with its easy taste could make for a looong night (or morning depending on your tastes)."
"I have drank this many many times. the bottle is not the way to go. they tell you to drink straight from the bottle, which is stupid. off tap or from can to glass is one thing but this is a flat, lack-luster guinness at it's best. I do not recomend this from the bottle"
"well, i'll drink it. but I may not be totally excited about it."
"I would fly to ireland just to taste it freshly poured from a local pub ;)"
"Drinkability is moderate. It's easy to consume, but it's really not that great. It lacks depth of flavor and important aspects of body. It's certainly sessionable, but I'd be too bored to drink more than one. I always remembered liking Guinness and wondered why everyone slammed the Nitro Bottle so much, and now I think I've figured out why."
"D+ Very drinkable and easy going down full of flavor but no too strong. I can definetley put quite a few of these down in a sitting."
"Loved the appearance when it was freshly poured from the tap. It had the waterfall effect in the beer which is totally impressive with the little bubbles that trickle down from the top. Some are drawn back by the dark black motor oil look with the thick creamy head but not me. I love Irish Dry Stouts - they're my favorite. Smells of heavy roast and that is exactly what you first taste as it hits your tongue. However, you do get a slight tin flavor which is slightly odd. Full thick head stays with the glass all the way down. Mmmm, ""barkeep - pour me another""."
"D - A great session beer. Sure there are stouts with more flavors, but Guinness is widely available and it's mild mannered flavor makes it easy to drink as many as you'd like (One night I had 8 imperial pints in a row) without getting as full as I would have with other beers. Alcohol level is low so it keeps you standing and Guinness is calorically low which never hurts and makes it a good option instead of a typical light beer. I could drink this from 10 am on and all day on a rainy day and often have. The only killer is how many bars screw this beer up."
"D: Very drinkable. Didn't find it filling or overbearing."
"This might have use as a stepping stone for getting someone to come over from BMC products into craft beers. Other than that, I think it's a waste, personally."
"This beer is just really fun to look at. The taste is almost like chocolate milk to me for some reason. Really smooth and creamy. I'm not particularly impressed with it in any way besides the appearance. The flavor should be bolder and more full for the way it looks and the dark color I think. It's a decent beer though, I'll prolly have a a craving later for another"
"cheers!"
"I love Guinness but there are better options. Very Dark and chocolatley stout and goes great with hearty stews and works well for cooking. Guinness in America is good, but try it in the UK. It's a dream. I'm going to rate it as I normally drink here in the US. The only thing I don't like about Guinness is the slight negative aftertaste which I didn't taste when I was traveling overseas."
"Poured from a nitro bottle into an imperial pint. Cascading effect through a dark brown body. Nice creamy head, some lacing is there. Aroma of burnt coffee grinds and hints of chocolate. Taste is on par with the nose. Roasted coffee, dry baker's chocolate, slightly bitter. The mouthfeel is what gets to me on this one. It's thin and watery, not much in the way of flavor. I prefer the Extra Stout to the Draught, personally, but I could drink several of these in one sitting on nitro-tap. Maybe I should have drank this from the bottle as it insisted. After a few minutes, the beer became flat and watery which took away from the overall taste. Not very pleasing."
"Very smooth, easy drinking beer. Not nearly as good as the tap Guinness in Ireland but I have to settle just like the rest of America."
"To me, the only thing more satisfying than watching a Guinness settle is consuming it. The smooth taste is comforting. While I would say there are other beers out there that are more worthy of the ""brilliant"" accolade, Guinness will always have a special place in my heart."
"OVERALL: This beer is definately drinkable. Its low ABV means you can drink it all night, and that nothing is overpowering means you'll never get sick of it. Definatley sessionable, and I've sessioned it many times. Tastes and feels nice, is a pleasure to look at, and goes down very nicely. On the other hand, I could see how some might find it too dull and weak after a few pints, and want to move on to something else. In the end though, I find it to be a great session brew off the tap."
"Drinkability - It's Guinness, how could you hate it. I certainly don't, but I can't say it's as good as I once believed. It is better than a macrolager and since it's ubiquitous even a bad beer bar will have this and probably give you a glass if you order one. I'm glad it's around, but I personally don't drink Guinness much anymore."
"Definitely get Guinness if it's between Guinness and a watery American macrobrew. If it's between Guinness and another stout, go for the other stout. Unfortunately, the former choice is the one you will have at many US bars."
"Two tastes - weak coffee and bitter beer. Drink it straight from the bottle is the motto. However the best we can say is its coffee appearance and huge creamy head that stays there. OK to drink if you're drinking something after to take away the taste."
"This is a great beer to sit back with on a hot evening and enjoy. I like to milk these in order to enjoy the changing characteristics as it warms."
"Not as strong as the stout and goes well with an Irish Car Bomb. Yes I know it's a mixed drink but its what got me to try Guinness the first time."
"Overall a pretty decent stout..not the best out there though. Certainly don't mind having one of these every now and then."
"Poured from the pint-sized can. Poured the usual (but wonderful) cascading tan head until it was dark brown with a solid tan head that stays around for the long-haul. Smell is chocolatety with perhaps a hint of coffee. The mouthfeel is heavy with a strong coffee and chocolate aroma even before swallowing. It finishes with a solid aftertaste of the same and is very drinkable."
"D: Very drinkable. Didn't findi it filling or overbearing. Just nothing real special."
"Tastewise this wasn't all that great a bit of a malted chocolate flavor in there. The color was rich black similar to soda with with a tan head. Smell is sort of smokey metallic. Mouthfeel was sort of thick. It wasn't the most drinkable beer on the planet but was better then most of the stuff at the party today."
"D- The lack of richness in this brew would make it very easy to session."
"D-Good, easy to drink. A classic I've been drinking for years that I'm somewhat partial to due to experience, but now that I've expanded out a little, it's merely ok."
"D: Smooth and easy."
"Alright... I've taken a complete 360 when it comes to Guinness in general. What can I say? It's not bad. Pours a black color, thick tan head, and an overall visually appealing beer. This beer is smooth and creamy with a mild coffee flavor with hints of malt. A bit thin for a stout but this is the easy drinking, easy obtainable stout and I've got no problem with that."
"An awesome cascading effect when poured where the colors sift back and forth before settling. A nice milk-looking head sits on top of the ""living"" brew. But looks only go so far: no aroma whatsoever is backed by no real taste whatsoever. Slight cream make you feel like you are drinking a light, flavorless milkshake. A true disappointment."
"Makes one hell of an irish car bomb too which adds for drinkability too..."
"A nice creamy mouthfeel that makes you want to chug the thing!"
"Everything considered, while this is far from perfect it is a good solid beer when in the mood for something dark and bitter. I do remember getting this on tap at McCormicks Irish Pub back in Richmond, VA about 6 or 7 years ago and I think I remember it being better than this. Oh, it was so good!"
"D - I've had this from a can and bottle, but it is always best on tap. It is the choice at restaurants than just feature BMC."
"I wouldn't drink more that one in a row but I would gladly have one in the morning or for dessert. Anything that gets my wife involved and approving of my beer hobby is fine with me. She likes this one a lot."
"Often joked about, but very true, Guinness is a very thick and heavy beer. There are considerably heavier stouts from other microbreweries, but Guinness is up there. Low ABV, but I can't imagine having more than two of these in one drinking session."
"Overall, not to bad for something that is a beer that people talk about all the time. (or at least what my college buddies say to be one of the biggest beers of all time). Decent drinkability if it's your thing."
"this beer is almost black and you get like atleast an inch head on it, which tastes delicious. the only bad thing about the nitro can/bottle is as soon as you open it, it starts to spill so you gotta be quick about pouring it. this beer doesn't taste as strong as it looks so don't let it scare you, it kind of tastes like coffee"
"D: All day everyday...and for $2.50 a piece (happy hour) you can get alot done"
"Easily available, most recognizable, but definitely overpriced. This is a wonderful beer to look at, with a dark soft color and fluffy head this beer is beautiful. Not much aroma is given off, my nose can't pick up much of anything. Mouthfeel is real good with a texture that is silky soft and smooth. Finishes with ease. The flavor is where I am most disappointed. Overall the taste is good, but I want more flavors in a stout. I don't want to say Guinness is bland, but in a sense it really is."
"Overall, it is a decent stout. Certainly, it has been marketed and changed to appeal to the more 'common' beer drinker, but at it's core it is still a stout. There are many better examples out there but I suppose it still has a place in my and my other peoples hearts as the 'classic' stout. It is the beer that got me into good ales, so I have to thank it for that. I'll probably end up keeping a few around the house just to have for an easy drinker."
"This is what most people think of when they think ""stout."" It's not the greatest one I've ever had - especially from within Guinness itself. There are much better varieties of just this type, and stouts in general. However, it's not that bad either. I guess I would just consider this one to be ""average."" The ""draught"" that's actually on (nitro?) tap is better than the ""draught"" that's sold in the bottle. Neither of them are nearly as good as the Guinness Extra Stout, and even that's not the absolute best that I've ever had (though it's considerably better than this one)."
"Poured a deep, deep brown that was somewhat sluggish and slow to pour. Small tannish head. Nose was burnt barley and coffee. Taste was roasty, espresso and smooth but thin. The carbonation is ok, but the body is far too watery for a stout. Not nearly as good as tap."
"www.theviceblog.com"
"Overall, it's good, but not great."
"Guinness Draught is the joke of all stouts. Its appearance is its only saving grace as it is quite dark and leaves a good-sized, long-lasting head, which also leaves some good lacing. Once you get past that, there's not much good to be said. Smells like a watered-down stout and it tastes like one too. Honestly, where is the taste in this? Especially when compared with its Extra Stout brother, this one is just weak. For me, it's even hard to finish one just because it's so watered-down. Dear Guinness, please make Extra Stout your standard style."
"This is the best looking beer ever imo. The creamy, bone white head on top of the black body is quite a sight. Aside from a great creamy texture, this is just an average offering. Mild roasty smells and flavors, little else. Certainly drinkable given how light it is, but why bother?"
"Drinkability - This is an entry level stout. Not bad, but certainly not as full-bodied as one would hope from the most famous of all stouts. At 4.1% ABV it makes a great session beer...and at 125 calories per 12oz it isn't filling. Personally, I'll stay with Imperial Stouts if I have a choice...if not Guinness is a good standby. Even if I do have problems with their unethical business practices and treatment of the Irish people."
"A pleasant enough beer. I like the extra stout bottle much better."
"Extremely dark, near-black color with absurdly strong, creamy head and lacing; it just sticks to the side of the glass. Smell is rather weak. Flavor is decent; some malt and coffee, with a more bitter finish. Mouthfeel is very heavy, full and creamy - very smooth, but unexciting. I prefer the Extra Stout, which has more carbonation. Overall a good, thick and solid beer. But not spectacular."
"A stout for non-stout drinkers. Sad -- as it is not like the stuff you get in Dublin. These are very easy drinking, as they lack much character at all. And, if you are unfortunate to have one poured where the head is non-existent, you miss the most pleasing, dominant flavors. Wow, am i giving a thumbs down to a legend? Not really -- I'd still drink this over Bud any day, but this represents a sad example of the true nature of the original."
"If you cut my arms, I do not bleed blood but Guinness. This Is a black beer that has the cool reverse bubbles flowing up from the bottom. the smell is mild. The taste is slightly sour, with smooth malt notes and a good balance of hops. The mouth feel from the Nitro is very nice. It is a full but light mouth feel. The drinkability is surprising easy, you'll put away three before you know it."
"D - I don't drink this much at home anymore from the can's but it is an easy to go beer in almost any beer or restaurant"
"this was black as midnight, and somth as silk, form the first sip i was hooked, a nice dark roast coffie start and smooth finish, this was less bitter than the extra stout vershion, i love this one, this is a bit thicker than your starter beers but i love it, also try this one in a black and tan (every sip is a difrent flavor)"
"Overall, certainly very drinkable and sessionable."
"Could put back a few but really wouldn't want to. Could get something much better."
"Drinkability: I don't know if I'd come running back to this, especially if there are other Irish Stouts available but given the selection at the place that I got this, it was probably the best I was going to do anyway. All In all I'd say it was a decent beer but nothing remarkable."
"D - Easy to get down due to mouthfeel, but the flavor isn't something I want to experience for hours on end. Furthermore, this brew is an over-hyped representation of the style, and is somewhat bland."
"Spread'n cheer"
"This Guinness was great. The brew was completely black with a finger-length white head. The composition between the two was perfect -- it was so even and exact that it looked fake. I couldn't stop staring. The beer had a roasted, dry taste, just what you would expect from a Guinness. The head lasted all the way to the last sip, and provided the perfect creaminess to balance the dryness. I enjoyed this one profusely and will continue to drink it only from the tap."
"D: It's easy to drink, but more flavor would really help this along. I just don't see what all the craze for Guinness is about."
"Very enjoyable beer, not the taste and experience of a belgian but I feel is one of my favorite session beers."
"Well, looks like I'll be in the minority here. My first mistake was getting this from a can. Poured a nice dark earthy brown with good head. Smelled a little roasted. Then I tasted it and it was awful. It had the taste of burned up dirty rags. The group I was with was sipping away, but I couldn't even finish mine. Then I heard that the closer one gets to where Guinness is brewed, the better it tastes, like melted butter. Well, NC is a far cry from Ireland, so I don't plan on choosing this again until I get to the land o' the Irish. There are plenty of better stouts here for me to enjoy. Sorry, but I was sorely dissappointed."
"d: there are a lot of stouts that taste better out of the can than this one"
"Drinkability is very high. I can quaff many a can before succumbing to sleep. Not the best Irish dry ever but something that every beer drinker needs to drink at least once."
"Drinkability: always very good choice at any time."
"I'll have Guinness again, I'm sure, but it's not the same as when I first started drinking it."
"very dark brown in color with a one finger beige head thats like shaving cream, lacing is a continuous sheet down the glass. weak aromas of roasted malt and coffee. taste same, very weak and watery with low carbonation very disappointing. i do like guinness but i will not buy the guinness draught again."
"M/D - Creamy mouthfull. Drink it all night long."
"Everyone knows Guinness... And that is for good reason. I have to say this beer is the best ""light"" beer I've ever had. At 125 calories for a 12 oz serving it is a hard one to beat. It is a beer I look forward to to top off any night out drinking. It is full of flavor, it has a very dark (black) color, and it has a creamy head that cascades as it settles from the pour. If you have not had a Guinness Draught then get out of that cave you are living in and go get one. You may or may not care for it, but I feel the majority of people that try one, would have it again. I consider it the ""gateway"" beer for more exciting beer drinking. Although it is not my favorite beer, I rank it very highly for a very drinkable stout. Personally for its style I would prefer a Murphy's, but they are harder to find."
"D - Drinkability is average. The beer goes down easy and remains smooth throughout. However, this beer is the epitome of bland. I would only get this if nothing better were available at the time."
"This is not the worst beer ever, but it certainly is the most overrated. If you disagree with me then you are insane. I am not trying to troll, but the fact that I am relatively new to the world of fine beers and this one was easy to point out as terrible and tasteless, I should be allowed to make such a caustic statement."
"I tried this beer on March 15, 2008 at 'McCabe's Irish Pub' in Guelph, Ontario, Canada. The beer was a dark murky brown with a thick, creamy tan coloured head that lasted a long time. The aroma was almost non-existent. The mouthfeel was full-bodied, but very little carbonation. The flavour was very reminiscent of diluted tea."
"I know it says drink from the bottle, but I had to pour into a glass. Poured a very deep dark ruby color with the typical cascading nitro bubbles, thin creamy brown head that seems to last forever. Smell is likewise very creamy, some malty sweetness. Taste is slightly peaty, roasted malt. Very light flavor. Mouthfeel is fairly light, and dry as to be expected. I much prefer the ""Extra Stout", but if forced to choose between Draught in cans or these nitro bottles, i'd have to say bottles."
"Note: My ratings for domestic on-tap would be 5/4/3/4.5/4. And my ratings for the nitro-can would be 5/4/2/4/3. Significant differences."
"D - Roasty and dry, this is obviously a classic example of the style. Nevertheless, I can't say I really like it, it is pretty one dimensional and not particularly compelling."
"D: Very drinkable. A good fall back beer for beer joints who don't have micros."
"This beer will always be a classic. The commercial (widget bottle, nitro-can) are pale shadows compared."
"D. This is a staple beer. Its good drinking. Cheers."
"D- This is a beer that one really can't go wrong with. The easiest stout to find anywhere. Since its rather low alcohol one can drink several."
"People seems to give Guinness alot of flack for being ""not stout enough"" ect ect. But I think that missed the point. Guinness is a dark looking beer, but it drinks easy, and its lighter then it looks. At only 136calorires a pint, you can throw back quite a few, compaired to the 300+ with ""stoutier stouts"". In my opinion, there is no better drink when your with your mates at the Pub."
"The only people who like guinness are those who have never had a proper stout or porter in their life. Go buy a real stout by Samuel Smith (oatmeal preferably), and you'll finally understand why everyone says it tastes like mud."
"M&D - A mellow beer that can be fairly easy to drink. I guess the low ABV makes it so that you can toss back a bunch of them, but really...I'd rather not."
"drinkability is average - relatively low abv and water mouth feel means it can keep flowing for quite some time."
"I liked this a lot. I look forward to having the real thing in Ireland some day."
"M&D- Feels very good. Creamy and yet quite drinkable"
"Drinkability - Definitely not the original...I could swallow this down if there was no Guiness in sight but would rather hit the tap."
"MF/D: As an Irishman, I feel I'm obliged to include Guinness in my reviews, generally because whenever I'm in a bar and someone meets me, they automatically assume it's my beer of choice. It's a decent beer, one I've enjoyed many times, but not my favourite stout by a long shot. As most on here probably know, the notion that Guinness is ""a meal in a glass"" is ridiculous, and most stouts are lighter than a lot of beers, so you don't expect a lot of volume, but it's a little watery for me, and I personally am not a fan of the slightly bitter flavour. For a more enjoyable example of Irish stout, I'd go with Murphys."
"Great beer on tap, and a great feat in making it very similar with their nitro-widget can."
"Very drinkable, but based on the fact that there are not many overpowering flavors."
"Though some people seem to think Guinness isn't what it used to be, it's still a staple and certainly my mainstream beer of choice (that is, of the beers you can get a place like Chili's or Applebee's, Guinness seems to be the best offer). It may not be the best stout in the world, but is always a reliable fallback."
"Pours an opaque blackly brown with a milkshake creamy, light tan lid. Light nose of un-sweet chocolate and roasted coffee beans. Light and somewhat watery with a creaminess to the mouthfeel. Cream, dry chocolate, and roasted tasting. Not terrible, not complex, but it is quite sessionable."
"M + D: A little light, but decent enough, I suppose. An easy drinker in that sense, and it provides a reasonable lingering taste if allowed."
"D-Not bad but not good either....like a slightly more bodied and slighty roasty Bud...no kidding!"
"Irish Car Bombs, anyone?"
"MF&D- Thinner than the pour would leave you to believe, although creamy enough to coat the mouth well. Great beer that is light enough to session even though its a stout."
"Mouthfeel: medium-full body, silky-smooth soft texture, moreish as hell"
"Pours black with a nice dense persistant head. Pretty typical for a nitro- but good. Aroma is sweet with a roasted note. Taste is very mild roasted malt. Not a lot going on but not bad. Lightly carbonated with surprisingly light mouthfeel. Fairly drinkable but not something I like to drink a lot of. I've had plenty of Guiness in my life- I used to really like it but I haven't had it for a while. Overall it's pretty average stuff and a decent commonly available beer."
"D: The ale is quite drinkable, with a sessionably low abv. It's not as robust as some stouts but it holds its own reasonably well."
"in my day but I really did not care for this particular nitro bottle. You get this ginormous head which is fine but I thaught it made it kind of flat. It also had a very creamy tast to it. So not a big fan."
"I've had a lot of the 3 major dry stouts while I've been here in Ireland, and I would probably rank Guinness and Murphy's about neck and neck. Neither are as good as Beamish, but overall, all 3 are very similar, almost the same. They all look the same, smell the same and drink pretty much the same, but Beamish is slightly fuller and offers a bit more taste."
"On the plus side, my St pattys Day wasn't ruined. I've got a 22 of Rogue Kell's Lager on hand!"
"This used to be the beer of the God's for me. I still drink from time to time, but I really don't care for this too much anymore. There are so many other better stouts to try."
"D = Depends on what you are looking for. The flavor is a little one note and it is a little watery, but it is also easy to drink several of while enjoying the company of friends at a pub."
"I was lucky enough to have my first Guinness at the Brewery in Dublin a few years ago. While I wasn't expecting anything of that quality, this beer really disappointed me. Next time i'll go for the extra stout, instead of a can advertising an ""extra cold"" beer."
"The lack of body makes Guinness a great session beer. I know I had two more pints after the first. However, I'm of the school of thought that a good stout shouldn't be a candidate to be shotgunned or funneled, and I'd be perfectly happy doing either with Guinness Draught."
"Overall - 4 years ago, before I really liked beer, I thought Guinness Draught was overpoweringly bitter. Now I don't find anything about it overpowering, but it still tastes like crap. My can was imported from Ireland (some Australian Guinness is brewed under license), but it probably deteriorates signifcantly in transit. This is simply no where near as good as Guinness Extra Stout or any of the other, more traditional stouts in the Guinness range."
"d: Like most people, Guinness was my first ""dark"" beer. It is a great introduction beer for people scared of beer they can't see through. That's because while it may be dark, it is devoid of flavor and drinks like a light lager. Guinness is low in calories, low in alcohol, and is the wimpiest stout I have had. That being said, I can't help but love Guinness. It is still a remarkable beer. That pour, that cascade, that feeling when it hits you tongue, the ease with which it goes down, this is Guinness and nothing else is quite like it. Wish I could have had it before it was mass-produced."
"Lot's have been said about this beer, and of course I am drinking it to prepare for St. Patrick's Day. So let me review it: poured out from the bottle with a thick, creamy head, dark black with some amber in light. I must say, it is enjoyable watching it sit, giving it an added bonus. The aromas are very sharp and roasty of coffee, wheat, yeast, chocolate, and caramel. The colder it is, the more you can smell its chilled flavors. The taste is uniquely thin, especially for those flavors, with an overall dimension of bitter, coffee like sweetness. The mouthfeel helps perfect it, allowing the flavors to remain dry, thin and light. Overall, the draught of Guinness is very well known for a good reason. Very excellent."
"The biggest thing that pleases me is that it is popular *and* decent."
"Carbonation goes away quickly. This is a very distinctive brew that challenges the beer status quo."
"D= I could probably drink a lot more of these than the Extra Stout Original's, for various reasons listed above. I'd love to find it on-tap. Compared to the Extra Cold Nitro Bottle, the can is probably a slightly better version but nothing to justify the added expense other than the fun of playing with the Nitro-Can submerged-pouring."
"Sure, it is not the most impressive beer and not one to brag about on this site, but it's fun to drink and not offensive on the palate. It's worth the price."
"D: I really don't like this style much at all. I am not a coffee drinker, so this by far and wide is not my cup of tea... er ... beer. I hope this isn't the way all stouts taste..."
"cheers."
"Overall, I'll still drink Guinness, especially if I can find it when it resembles the original draught version."
"D: This is a pretty drinkable beer, all things considered, but there are better stouts, and better Irish stouts out there. The bottle really doesn't do it justice, I think the best way to do this beer is out of the pub can. The bottles are convenient for car bombs though!"
"Every time I think Guinness is old hat, I have one and remember that's it's still a standard to judge against."
"If this guy tasted as good as it looked, it could rival the best of the best. Sadly it tastes next to nothing; it sits just south of neutral. Guinness is a tragedy in the world of beer. The next time someone tells me that Guinness'll put hair on my chest... I think I'll cry."
"I have long enjoyed drinking Guinness Draught. Growing up in the Boston area, it was everywhere, always. Even if I have moved on to stouts I find much better, I really can't think of anything that looks better than a properly poured pint of Guinness. It's majestic."
"I suppose the ABV is very low so one could potentially drink several easily, I just don't know who would want to. I'll be honest I'm having trouble finding the redeemable qualities in this one. I guess I'll just say that it leaves a lot to be desired and I can't help but feel like this selection somewhat tarnishes the illustrious Guinness name. I realize its produced to be a widely appealing macro brew but I'm just not digging it."
"The only downfall is the thin, flat, watery mouthfeel. Creamy yet insubstantial. Still, I enjoy this beer every time I order it, But I only drink one in a night, and it has to be from the tap. That's the only way to truly experience a Guinness."
"D: A very tasty easy drinker."
"Appearance black in color with a two finger tan head. Smell highly rosted grain and coffee. Taste not profound but not bad dry coffee and bitter chocolate. Mouthfeel mediem body very light carbonation. Drinkability was very good I buy this beer about once a month and could drink it all night if I let myself. Very smooth!"
"The mass-market standard for Irish stout! Energetic head out of the can - deep, ultra-dark color contrasted with light tan abundant head. Roasted, slightly bitter aroma is there but does not stand out. Very dry toasty taste. Slightly austere mouthfeel. Always easy drinking. At 125 calories per pop, this is my diet beer!"
"My all-time favorite! As long as it is on-tap. The bottle kind of sucks and I haven't tried the nitro-can."
"Overall, a pretty drinkable beer. Not the most flavorful, especially after having tasted a good variety of stouts, but still a good beer to hit up when out on the town and in the mood for a stout, as it seems to be the only stout carried by most bars."
"I find this beer to be very drinkable, and it used to be one of my favorite Irish dry stouts."
"There's nothing like the site of a properly poured Guinness evacuating its bubbles and foam from the depths of a pint glass. It's mesmerizing and hypnotic. And from the tap it posseses the quality of a thin milkshake. Sweet, malty, and delicious yet bitter. This is a beer unlike most beers. Everybody who's anybody has has a Guiness but there are only a special few who can sport the Irish accent and drink it by the pitcher on March 17th. I can't wait..."
"Has a nice deep roasted malty chocolate flavor with no bitter aftertaste. Can see why it's been so popular for so many years. Fills you up tho, I usually have no more than 2 in one setting."
"D: Sometimes I wonder if I am Irish when I drink these because I can never get enough when its one of those nights."
"On tap. Waitress brought other drinks to the table and said my Guinness would be a few minutes. I took this as a good sign that a proper pour was being done. When my pint arrived it was still settling, most of the glass showed a light foaming brown, with just black showing. I watched as the pour settled, but did end up with close to a full serving. The beige head held on through the drink, with lots of lacing left n the sides. Dark black in color. The aroma is sweet and roasted malt, not heavy though. Flavor is smooth roasted malt, with just a hint of bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Enjoying this on tap far exceeds the bottle experience."
"D: On nitro, I can drink Guinness all night long and then for breakfast. This is one beer that dispells the myth of dark, ""heavy"" beers (stouts)."
"This is a drinkable beer, that is, for a mainstream brew. It is, more or less, satisfactory. One drawback is that it sits in your stomach like a petrified loaf of bread. It's not a beer you can drink a lot of."
"The look is legendary, black topped by white, sitting perfectly in the glass. Like it or not, Guinness is brewed for mass appeal, so that leaves it being fairly middle of the road in the taste department. There are no off flavors, but really nothing too special either. The mouthfeel is creamy and its high drinkability can make it quite addictive!"
"Nitro can poured in standard pint glass. Beautiful beer - black with 1 finger cream head that does not diminish one iota and how can you not like the reverse cascading effect. Decent lacing all the way down. Has a kind of a vanilla smell to me but my nose is terrible. With the way the beer looks you just want to be floored by the taste but it just doesn't quite work out...hint of coffee, smoke and slightly metallic, ok but doesn't fit the appearance. Mouthfeel - I love the shake like feel of Guinness. If Sam Adam's Cream Stout had a mouthfeel like this I'd drink nothing else. Takes me a while to drink Guinness because I like to swirl every swig around for a while. Drinkability is solid for me due to mouthfeel and low alcohol content."
"Mouthfeel is good, fairly chewy, and smooth to drink. It's the standard I defer to when there isn't much of a selection available. There are certainly other favorite dark beers out there but Guinness is always a 'safe' choice."
"Dallas, TX. Bottled. Well the famous Guinness that I have a love-hate relationship with. Really enjoyed visiting the factory, but the ones at the American supermarkets are different. Not a big fan of the aroma, heavyToasted/roasted smell with light yeasty undertones. Appearence is beautiful and well planned. Intial head is smaller than the final head which is nearly milkey. The head is off white and ALWAYS have a fingerwidth tall. Dark dark color, beautiful. Flabor is of roasted coffee with hardly any initial flavor. Finish is average with salty/sour taste. Texture was extremely extremely watery with nearly flat carbonation. Non descript finish-feel. Good, but better closer to the source."
"But, the odor has more sourness than desired and the roast character is a little lacking. It's there but not up front. These qualities follow through into the flavor too. It's a classic beer but I prefer Beamish or Murphy's for a more pleasing dry stout experience."
"D - This is one of those beer that is cool to sit at a bar, catch up with an old friend or new friend and just hang out and drink."
"Overall: extremely watery. Very different from the tap Guinness I know (I specially missed the creamy character of the tap version). Poor substitute to the original stuff. If you are looking for a Guinness in a bottle try the ""Guinness Special Export Stout"". Now that is a beer!"
"I think Guinness is better than it has been rated by some lately. I'm sure there are better stouts out there but this is such a classic."
"D - overall it's a great beer and used to be my favorite, but as I've broadened my consumption to Belgian styles and domestic crafts, Guinness is starting to move down my list as a favorite. Regardless, it's an exceptional beer and usually a mainstay at many watering holes, which is a nice alternative to the American lagers that I need not mention. Though, I would avoid ""chancing"" this beer and order it only when you know the bar and bartenders care about the way they serve it."
"This beer is solidly average. I'm sure one could find much worse examples, but finding a better one doesn't take much thought. I'd have to imagine that Guinness Draught would be much better in a pub atmosphere out of a tap."
"Overall - Despite having this beer more times than I can remember (my unenlightened days at uni were spent solely on this), I choose to review this pint because it tasted particularly good. Guinness doesnt have much taste and certainly not aroma but something can be said about the importance of mouthfeel because thats the reason I used to drink it. And Im sure the reason why so many people still drink it. I think that mouthfeel is the most important attribute to the sense of ""moreishness," and thats where guinness' strength is. Despite my dislike of beers which represent all thats bad about big business breweries, if Im confronted by a row of commercial lagers with this one exception, I would have to say that I would always go for a guinness."
"True there are better stouts out there but its a freakin classic. Best of all it has an availability rivaled only by BMC."
"By far my favorite beer. I truly enjoy the rich coffee flavor from the roasted barley. A wonderful carmel flavour from the creamy head. The great bitters finish. On occasion I have had it poured in the wrong glass (I found out that there are two styles of Guinness glasses available) and it does ruin the beer."
"Virtually no aftertaste, and with the low alcohol content, combines to make a pretty darn good session beer."
"Drinkability - I love stouts. People think I'm crazy when I tell them that I think it's somewhat thin tasting because lots of people think it's like a ""meal in a bottle"" but I don't buy that. I need to do a side by side comparison of this and Guinness Extra Stout, but I think that the Extra Stout is more up my alley. Also, I really wish Guinness used true 16 ounce cans and 12 ounce bottles. This 14.9 ounce/11.2 ounce business is just lame."
"Come on, we all know Guinness. It's the other gateway beer next to Sierra. It's good for what it is trying to do. Not a special stout by any means, but come on, it's Guinness."
"OK, I was a little annoyed after reading the Bros.'s reviews of this brew as they seemed harsh just for the sake of ""oh, if you had it in Dublin"" or ""it used to be better"" and the like. However, it's true, this has been dumbed down a good deal from what I remember cutting my beer teeth on from the tap. Not worth a purchase, especially with so many more American craft breweries attempting the dry Irish style (3F's Black Sun, anyone?)."
"The version of Guinness we get here is definitely light on the smell and taste. Only a hint of roasted barley flavor is apparent. However, the appearance, with jet black body and thick head, and the creamy milkshake taste are what makes this beer so enjoyable for me. Combined with the relatively low alcohol content, this is a very chuggable session beer that I can always depend on when I'm somewhere that doesn't serve craft beer."
"Anyway, if kept well, the pour is the classic we have all come to know and love. The smell is limited to a mild roasted flavour. All I can say about the taste is that it is distinctively that of Guinness, except when the quality of serving/keeping is lower and bitterness starts to overwhelm. A good draught Guinness should be smooth, nicely flavoured and not bitter - and dead easy to drink."
"There's nothing better the watching the creamy head foam on a Guinness. Smell has roasted malty aromas. Could be a little stronger though. Goes down extremely smooth, with light carbonation and much more bitterness than I remember. The malts and hops are very well balanced. This is one great beer and shouldn't be put down just because it's one the big boys."
"The bottle says this is supposed to be consumed directly from the bottle, so I did that. I only poured a bit into a glass to evaluate the appearance. It is nice and dark, but not black. Light does penetrate and it is more of a dark brown body. The aroma isn't strong at all. A touch of roasted malt is pretty much it. The taste is decent, but could use a bit more punch to it. There is a touch of roasted malt again and maybe a hint of coffee, but it is pretty thin. The body is as thin as the taste. I can't believe I used to think of this as heavy bodied. This is however, one of the most quaffable darker beers out there. There is something to be said for that."
"Haven't had one of these in a good while. Ordered this from a nitro-tap. Very interesting show before all was said and done with foam rising to the top from the bottom. Eventually, it became a dark black with a finger thick head that was the color of the inside of a Whopper (the candy, not the burger). Decent lacing. However, the line where the drink itself and the head meet looked synthetically straight. Kind of took a lot of the soul out for me. Smell is kind of weak, but rather sweet-smelling. Taste is rather weak, especially for something labeled as a stout. Mildly sweet malts. Mouthfeel is slightly creamy, but closer to the consistency of water. Easily sessionable, but I would rather move on to bigger and better things. Sadly, this is often the best thing available at many locations."
"Was actually my first time that I've ever had this world-renowned, popular brew... Sampled it on draft at Legal Sea Foods in Short Hills, and to be honest, I can't understand what all the hype is behind this one... Although I was pretty impressed with the dual-color, dark, tan appearance, it basically went down-hill from there... a basically average, dry stout smell that wasn't too appealing led to a bitter and uninviting taste that had an even more astringent after-taste... Oily, slick mouthfeel and too bitter to be a drinkable brew in my opinion... Glad I tried it, but won't ever again..."
"It can compare to the real draught version, but what beer does? And given that it's widely available, it's a heckuva a lot better option than Heineken or, arguably, Sam Adams."
"Solid beer. Not exceptional, but worth buying every now and then. But if you're a nonconformist conformist and don't drink it because it's popular, it's only your loss."
"D- Very easy to drink. In my early days of drinking, i always felt guinness was so overpoweringly bitter. After tasting a variety of stouts now, its amazingly bland. Fantastically easy to drink and aesthetically a masterpiece, but a real lightweight in flavour now for me."
"14.9 oz widget can. One of the best looking beers. The cascade effect is great and the lasting tan head is inviting. Smell of rich roasted coffee, maltiness, maybe almost chocolately. Taste is roasty, some bitterness, with not too long a finish, but I was surprised by how watery and thin I found this beer despite it being so dark, and a stout. For some reason I remember it having more body. I found it less filling and full flavored than I was expecting. Decent, but not good."
"D: There are plenty of local Irish stouts and Beamish that I prefer but an easy drinker that is without a doubt sesionable."
"I had a perfectly poured Guinness on tap last week, complete with shamrock. They haven't been able to can that yet. Drink this on tap or poured out of the ordinary bottle, forget anything with widgets."
"Overall this just seems watered down for some reason. Decent enough with food or in a pub with some friends but theres not much going here except for a nostalgia thing."
"i like this beer. better on tap in my opinion. still one of my favorites to drink though."
"If the Extra Stout I bought is anything like this, I will be severely disappointed."
"Overall: It's pretty much the same as guinness draught in the can, only it's in a bottle and you don't get as much. If you're just breaking into the craft brew scene it's a good beer to use to get your feet wet. Once you do, though, keep in mind there are other stouts out there that are much better."
"The place advertised a ""Perfect Pour," and I have to agree with them. A finger and a half of pearly head that left tight knit lacing all the way to the end. Pitch black colour. Lots of malts present, and a distinct roasted flavour. Just enough weight to the body; it wasn't watery, but neither was it like drinking oatmeal. The interplay between the creamy head and the robust beer worked well."
"Pours a rich black color with a gorgeous white and creamy, foamy head that just sits on top and waits, and waits and remains clinging to the bottom of the pint glass even when it is gone. Plenty of lacing sticks around as well, and the foamy head is present at every sip. Smell is very faint of roasted malt, a little faint espresso aroma. Taste is even more faint with every sip creamy yet distant with only the roasted taste coming through. My first time drinking straight Guiness. Nice change of pace."
"D: It's easy to drink but why bother? It's not challenging to the senses whatsoever."
"D: Very drinkable, I'll give it that. A decent session beer due to the low alcohol but there are many better stouts out there."
"I have to admit I'm a fan of this Irish Stout although over the years it has weakened in taste. I know you've all heard it before Guinness has definitely gotten lighter and so when held up to be inspected you can see light through the glass. I'm not sure of the reason this beer has become weaker although I have heard that this is common in the US but not every where else you may find this. So hopefully this will come back to the beer we all knew and liked."
"Pours black with a frothy, one-finger white head that lasted throughout the whole beer and left some lacing. Smells chocolatey and toasty. Tastes burnt, bitter, hoppy and a tad metallic. Also it seems watered down. Smooth and creamy and pretty watery mouthfeel. Drinkability isn't very high on this, it's just too watered down."
"I give up on Guinness."
"Drinkability: Excellent. This is one of my staple beers, one of the all time great session beers. [Old Guinness: ditto.]"
"This beer poured a dark brown with a three-finger tan head. The smell is fairly faint, and with some effort you can pick up roasted malts. The in the taste there is a definite presence of hops along with roasted malts that gives makes for a slightly sweet and slightly bitter brew that's rather pleasant. The mouthfeel a little watery, which helps with the beers excellent drinkability."
"Considering the nitro-bottle idea here, there's no appearance to speak of. I poured a bit out into a glass to get a whiff of the aroma since the small opening of a bottle doesn't let any smell out. What I got was hardly any aroma anyway! Burnt barley and a smidgeon of coffee. Tasted like water run through a loaf of charred bread, with the added bonus of a understated sourness in the finish. Yuck. The carbonation is nice, but the body is far too watery for a stout. I couldn't fathom drinking another of these unless it was part of a car bomb."
"D- I could drink these all night. Tastes like I'm drinking a stick of licorice or chocolate bar."
"Really bad. Not worth it. Like I said before. If you want dark, go local."
"I will only drink this beer in an authentic Irish pub. This is a beer that you don't just pour straight into a plastic cup and fling it to the customer. This happened to me in Boston and I was absolutely pissed. The pour of a Guinness is an absolute art. You will notice the color changing as its poured from the tap and how it forms a perfect layer of creamy foam at the top of the glass. It is not very bitter and its not too sweet. Hardly any carbonation, but its a great beer for sipping and sessions. If you are in Boston, you should try Mr. Dooley's."
"Drinkability is that I drink them whenever I am able!"
"Drinkability: Perhaps the widget-bottle isn't the way to go, 'cause this beer lacks any sort of distinct characteristics and comes across as watery and uninteresting."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: One of the first things I noticed when I started drinking this just now was that it has the same type of body and feel as a cool glass of water on a hot day, just after you've finished mowing the lawn. It is refreshing in that sense....cool clean water, with a bit of flavor thrown in. It is easy to drink and makes a great session beer, but I feel that a stout should be much fuller and heavier than this. Though I'm not a huge fan of this beer I'll most likely buy it again as at some point in my life this will be the best offering on tap at some low rate restaurant I happen to be dining in."
"Notes: Now here's a beer that's all about image. It looks impressive, but when you get down to it, it's completely lacking in aroma, flavor and body. It's not terrible by any means, but it's also not very good."
"The beer begins pouring a deep brown color mixing with the nitrogen and cascades into a midnight black beer with a soft two finger creamy head at the top. There isn't really much of a nose on a Guinness. Perhaps a bit of roasted barley, but not much. The taste is of the unique roasted malted flavor that allows for a bit of chocolate to find your palate from drink to drink and a dry finish leaves you going for another drink. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, but the beer is actually rather light and doesn't overly coat your mouth. The drinkability is very high on this. It's low in alcohol, refreshing, and satisfying. It makes a great session beer."
"The drinkability is unbelieveable. Drink these all day long and you will never tire or get full. Perfect!"
"Drinkability- Overall excellent beer, I could drink a six pack in 1 setting and still feel great. I drink this beer any time of the year."
"We Irish love to drink, and when we want to drink for a reaaally long time, we'll shakily raise pint after pint of Guinness and wake up with that familiar grey smile of satisfaction the following morn. The quintessential Irish stout. Brilliant."
"Guinness is always a good choice. Doesn't matter if you get it in bottle, can, or on tap... it just never lets you down."
"I usually drink this at home out of the nitro-bottle. But I was lucky enough to go to Dave and Busters and have it on tap. Pretty much is is the same. But I found the tap version to be a little more rich and a lot more tasty. Definatly one of my favorite beers."
"Dry Irish stout is one of my favorite styles easy drinking and not highly hoppped. Big creamy head. Great creamy taste. Toasty malt, light coffee flavor. I really love Guinness Draft. Light and refreshing even on a hot day. A session of Guinness is one of the best beer experiences. Highly recommended."
"On the palate there is some roasted malt, fair hop bitterness and a few hints of coffee. I will stick with my St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout and leave the Guinness for the rest of them."
"Drinkability: Not as good as a proper pint in the pub, but these can seem to consistently produce a passable pint"
"This is the beer that pulled me away from the budweiser's of the world. So smooth and perfect no matter what the mood it will satisfy your every need. The aroma and taste is like a creamy coffee and does not leave you feeling full as most people would have you believe."
"D: Moderate ABV and the taste always leaves me wanting more"
"Plus, you can mix it with a bunch of other beers and it's still great."
"D: I've had a many night where I drank a 4 pack of the draught cans whilst playing euchre or poker or just idling with my friends. They always go down nicely, and as they warm they get more flavorful, so, instead of a last drink that's pitiful you get a nice creamy end thats nice (thats what she said). Erin go Braugh."
"Review translated from french 5-25-2008."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable you could drink a lot over a short period of time just as easily as a single one over a long period. I find it appropriate at any time of the year"
"Yes Guinness does taste better in Ireland."
"Ok so its not a rare micro but this beer has got to be the official ""ol reliable."" If your worried about calories, the 20 extra calories is well worth it over a bud light and still a good option. You got to love the appearance of this, pours out black with a creamy body that cascades and rises to the top creating a tan immovable cream head leaving the black as day brew behind. Not much of a smell. If you try hard you get a whiff of roasted malt but thats with a big effort. Tastes nice and roasty with a minor hop bite at the end. Creamy in the mouth and smooth as silk. Though something with substance, these are as drinkable as bud light to me."
"Sure, it's not that complicated or complex, but I think that it's very good for a beer produced in such enormous quantities."
"There are two bars locally that have this one tap..one knows how to pour, the other doesn't. This review is from the one that does. Barkeep filled the glass 2/3 full, let it settle, then poured the remaining 1/3...WOW! The head quite possible could have supported a 1/2 dollar coin it was so rich and did not receed noticeably at all. The lacing was almost indescribable...more a sticky, continuous coating vs. gobs & bits. Smeel and taste are cklassic guiness...heavily roasted malt and some mild hop bitterness. Mouthfeel seemed creamier, but may have been due to the increased head retention. Could pound 8 or 9 of these in a pub setting easily."
"Ah, Guinness. Was my first ever dark beer, a long time ago. Now a days I have better understanding of it. So why not revisit an old friend. This beer pour a beautiful dark brown, almost black, with a nice full tan head. The smell is also very wonderful, hint of milk chocolate. The taste is not what I remember. It starts mildly sweet, and creamy, but the finish, especially as it warmed seem almost metallic. Mouthfeel was ok, think enough and creamy. Drinkability is a tough one, while it goes down smooth, and is not overly filling, the metallic taste at the end left my pallet a little ragged. Overall, I would not turn a Guinness down, and it is a bit better on tap, but with Beamish being back on the shelves here, and that Murphy's is easy to find, Guinness won't be my first choice when I want an Irish Stout."
"Just as good as in the can,nice dark brownish black color with creamy foamy tan head that holds well and nice lacing.Coffee,malts,licorice a touch of caramel and a mild smokey smell all blend together when you inhale thru the nose,great aroma.Taste is creamy coffee with a smokey licorice and malts comming at you with some hint of nuts,all going down smooth.Looks thick but actually got a thin feel to it,goes down rather lite to tell you the truth,great brew,even though the looks of this tar colored beer looks like a thick molases milkshake,it actually is very easy to drink and a few of these a day is quite easy to do,doctor recommended too,can you believe that."
"For me, when enjoyed properly, Guinness is the master of beers."
"Drank this one tonight with dinner. I've had it hundreds of times in the past and this was the same basic experience. Nice dark taste. thick, falling head that settled into a wonderful ""icing"" as I drank it. My favorite thing about this beer is the low ABV while not sacrificing much to taste. It makes drinking a 6 pack of stout something you can do without becoming ""that drunk guy"" in the room."
"The flavor is perhaps the weak part of Guinness. Despite being perhaps the epitome of its style, the taste is limited to weak notes of smoky malts, some carmel, and a touch of chocolate. Mouthfeel is great, however, with a creamy thick body that's quite refreshing. Not much of an aftertaste, however. Drinkability is hindered by its lack of complexity and thickness. Meal-in-a-pint. Overall, though, a pretty solid beer."
"There are so many really great stouts out there that I forget how much I like Guinness. It's great too. I hope to review at the very least the nitro-bottle and tap versions for comparison, but I expect this measures up surprisingly well compared to the latter and much better than the former."
"Dont buy this beer."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are right on par for the style."
"One of my favorite beers. It goes well with so many different meals or is great for just relaxing."
"Poured into a glass from a can this one had a nice thick head very dark color was noticed as the beer settled. The scents I picked up were chocolate and cherry sort of a coffee feel. The taste was hardly there nothing to write home about but not to bad. It did go down smooth with just a slight hint of an aftertaste. I guess you could put more of these away for awhile depends on your stamina. I have heard so much about this beer I had to try it."
"This is a stout for the masses and a good introduction for those who are not used to the style and don't want to be put off my something too strong or ""heavy""."
"Poured from 120z bottle with widget into english style pint glass. black with nice foamy head great cascade effect when first poured. Smell is pretty faint with cold coffee aroma. Taste creamy roasted coffee with burnt aftertaste. A little more watery than creamy but this beer is pretty easy to drink for a dark beer. Better from the tap."
"I know this beer is somewhat controversial here, and receives a lot of flack from fellow advocates for various reasons, but I can't help but like this brew. As I said, it's reliable and subtle, and is a great go-to beer when I'm out at a place with an otherwise poor selection. The hype is certainly overdone, and some of my friends worship this stuff (and the extra stout), but I'd be lying if I said I disliked this. To each their own."
"I have to say, they did a nice job with the widget in preserving the look of Guinness. Apparently the proper way to pour it is to forgo any tilt of the glass and just dump it straight in -- don't fear, because of low carbonation levels, it won't overflow... Basically, near black, beautiful cascading, incredibly durable head, foamy lacing. Smells much like the Guinness on tap, (creamy coffee, roasted nuts and ale hops) but with an unpleasant metallic tinge. This flavor comes out on the palate as well, and the characteristic Guinness sourness is also stepped up (I wonder if they put more ""spoiled"" beer into the vats meant for bottling than into those to be kegged). Not nearly as good. Again, weak mouthfeel, somewhat less creamy than that on tap, but still, an easy drinking beer for sessioning or the end of the night."
"Obtained a bunch of Guinness from family who bought it but decided ""dark"" beers weren't for them. Not a whole lot there in this beer, but it's a decent change-of-pace from my usual big IPA (at home) and Miller Lite (at softball)."
"Edit: Editing my review after trying a few other Irish Stouts. Still a great Stout but a bit dryer/bitter than some of the others"
"Try the extra draught. It's much better."
"Drinkability- One of my favorite ""standby"" beers when not much else is available, it is easy to find- even in Mississippi."
"Mouthfeel is perfect - smooth and creamy. Drinkability is insane. Low abv, plus a superb body and little to no taste equals a session beer I could drink by the gallon. It is what it is."
"Just a completely forgettable stout."
"What can I say, stouts are my favorite and Guinness is what started my obsession. The color is a wonderful, near completely black. The head is wonderful, creamy and foamy. It's lacing is fantastic, although the fact that I may drink it down pretty fast may have something to do with that. It's aroma is fantastic, deep and rich, the smell of rich dirt/loam after a heavy rain. I like to hold my pint and inhale deeply for a minute or two before enjoying its... taste, deep and rich, thick and creamy, chocolatey and loamy. All around wonderful!"
"Drinkability> Easy to drink... Perhaps too easy. Personally, I have one almost daily... Hey! I'm a vegetarian, so I need my iron; lay off me! :) It's ' Good for You', and my granny has been prescribed it throughout her life, so I have to accept the claim... and the tasty dosage:)"
"This is the first beer I think where my scores were all over the board. Let me break it down. Appearance was great, nice creamy, thick, almost tan head with those great Guinness bubbles. Nice and dark, when held to the light a hint of amber/ruby to it. Smell was not great, a little bland I thought. Smells a little of chocolate and coffee but nothing stands out. Taste is OK. Much like the smell, nothing stood out. Some chocolate and caramel, but somewhat bland. Mouthfeel was great. This had a fantastic smooth texture about it, very creamy sensation, low on the carbonation. And overall drinkability is OK. Easy to put a few of these away. This had its high notes, and low notes, a good beer though."
"Much rather have other stouts on the market"
"One of the best stouts on the planet. I'm sure some smaller breweries have made better but to make that amount and have it still be so damn good is still amazing. My personal favorite is the head. i love the head of a Guinness. It's like cream almost just beautiful. This will most likely remain my all time favorite stout!"
"Delicious!"
"notes:The word stout does not appear anywhere on the label or packaging. Why is this? Packaging says to drink from the bottle. I did not do this because a big part of the experience is the dense creamy head. Also, the packaging says to serve ice cold. Really? Why on earth would you do that when most of the flavors will be hidden. Boy do I hate marketing poeple and the crap they come up with to try to appeal to the masses because I can't imagine the brewmaster suggesting an ice cold Guinness experience."
"Pour came with a tan head and it doing it's thing cascading down the sides of the glass..(I will say this is probably one of the best parts of a Guinness on nitro..it's like beer eye candy). We all know what it tastes like and I'm not going over that part..what I will say was it was totally flat..no carbonation at all..it was like drinking a flat soda that had some buzz to it..boring..I had the SA Summer Ale before this...I should've stuck with it"
"Overall: I am surprised that it took so long to review this beer. It is ok, and will do in a pinch, but I wouldnt buy it if there was anything else available. Just not enugh flavor and aroma."
"D- This is definitely the definition of a session beer however I just don't like the flavor or the mouthfeel."
"I feel that this score is perhaps a little higher than the canned version of this beer deserves, but there you go. It is most definitely an icon, and if you are a fan, it is worth the premium price. There are definitely better stouts out there however, many of which are local and cheaper."
"Well I must say that I love the way a Guinness looks. Near black with a massive head that forms from the bottom up, leaving a thick and creamy mass. Smell is light and of chocolate and some coffee. Taste is much of the same. I've always noticed a little peppermint in the mix with this brew. It actually fits in pretty nicely. Mouthfeel is pretty light and has a dry creaminess to it. Kind of odd. Overall good drinkability. I can only imagine what it would be like in Ireland...my pops tells me good things."
"i put a pint glass and a bottle of guinness in the freezer for about 10-25 minutes. in the frozen glass the cascading was even more amazing. in the middle of all the action, things slowly grinded to a halt forming rock-like strata, or even like cloud layers on the planet jupiter for about 1/2in between the beer and the head. this time, the foam became a starchy, clumpy, foamy disc on top, a darker brown with little dark specks and more aerated like buckwheat pancake batter or the head on a rootbeer float with the same icy consistancy. using this method, some of the more delicate flavors and aromas disappeared, but the overall taste improved and the mouthfeel and drinkability skyrocketed."
"Drinkability: A classic, and one that deserves its status as such. Versatile with many foods, especially seafood, but I found it remarkable with smoked lamb and raw spinach eaten together. It brings out the sharp bitterness of the leaves and the gamey sweetness of the meat while emphasizing unexpectedly robust undertones in the beer."
"D: High. I love drinking Guinness. It was one of the first beers I ever tried, and despite hating it then (I was young and knew nothing), I love it now."
"poured into a pint glass from a 14.9oz nitro-can, it poured an almost pitch black with an amazing cascading effect and had a thick off white head that sticks around for awhile. smells of sweet roasted malts, has a fairly faint aroma. tastes just about the same, has a slight coffee and chocolatley flavor. mouthfeel is really light for a stout, i guess this would make a good session stout. this isnt a that bad of a beer, but i would definitley perfer somthing else."
"Very drinkable. Goes down really smooth and the low ABV is just a hair above a session beer."
"remember the first Guinness Draught I had. 20 years ago in London while in the Marines. As someone who had grown up drinking American macro-crap this was like nothing I had ever had. Pours an attractive dark color with creamy head that settles beautifully. Definitely a classic that every true beer drinker must try. Probably the best beer you can find EVERYWHERE (even south Mississippi). Great commercials too. Brilliant!"
"Guinness Draught is one of the best beers in the world. Guinness has a robust flavor profile that consists of hints of chocolate and coffee. If served in a clean Imperial tulip pint and poured properly, you will be hard pressed to find another beer that can match the exceptional taste and beauty of this beer."
"Not the best, but certainly not the worst."
"I still stand by what I said earlier, it's good but there are better stouts out there. Shakespear Stout from Rogue, or the World Wide Stout from Dogfish Head. But it'll still make you Irish everytime."
"D  I dont just think Id like another. I will enjoy another."
"D- Well, it seems to be made to be damn easy to drink. Enjoyable, but not killer. Not bad, but not what I was hoping for.... I wanted a little more out of this beer, but I've probably been drinking too many really good stouts lately."
"On Nitro-tap at The Spot in Bethel, this is definitely better on tap than it is either in the can or the bottle. Looks about the same, which is pretty close to amazing. A bit more malt in the nose same thing for the taste definitely more malt bitterness when this beer is out of the tap. The mouthfeel is very nice the real nitrogen injection makes this incredibly smooth and soft on the tongue. Drinkability is not bad either because again there is just enough taste to keep you mildly interested while the low alcohol makes it highly sessionable."
"Popping the cap and you hear the familiar fizz and bubbling from other nitro-enhanced cans. Pouring, you get the expected cascade, as good as the tap from what I see. Dark liquid, black with red hilights, and a thick and creamy, brown foam. Great retention and lacing rings are left behind. Not alot of aroma but there is some roasted malt and coffee. Taste is as expected from Guinness, thin almost watery, with flavor of toasted malt. Creamy smooth yet thin mouthfeel. Guinness Draught isn't strong and flavorful (like the Extra Stout) so it fulfills its expectations."
"D - Guinness is an excellent beer, nice tasting and very easy to drink."
"-Shoehornteeth."
"Your standard black stout look. Creamy head and nice smell. First sips sort of surprise you wish the amount of bitterness, but you get use to the bitterness and it just becomes a good bitterness. Tastes good and feels good in the mouth, little to no carbonation. Drinkable, but its a lounge beer not a chug beer."
"D. I don't mind the flavor of this beer, but it is quite weak and lackluster. I still need to try the extra stout. I could easily drink many of these, but with such little flavor and low alcohol content, it would burn money without satisfying me or giving me a buzz."
"One thing about reviewing a beer in bottle where the label says drink from the bottle - What's it look like?? Nice psst when I opened it and saw a little creaminess. Hard to smell it very well either, still, what I did whif was worth wiffing. At first swallow, seemed a bit thin, but gives way to excellent Guinness flavor and body. Unequalled finish too. Wasn't sure which one this was at first as it does say serve extra cold."
"However, Guinness makes a great introduction to craft beers, especially stouts. I just know there's better stouts out there."
"As long as the publicans maintain their lines, Guinness draught is hard to beat in the session beer category. Roasty enough to keep your attention, yet not so hoppy, malty, sweet, or powerful that it wears out its welcome."
"(6) Bottle - has a really flat taste...bring on the draft"
"D - Am I missing something? This is the world-famous Guinness beer? Either I need it on tap, or maybe the extra stout, but this beer is totally unimpressive!"
"Like the nitro can version, the nitro-bottle of Guinness Draught does a great job simulating the pub pour of draft Guinness. Great theatre watching the tall head overtaken by the liquid and the color is near black and near opaque. Smell is mild-mannered to not there at all. Mosty sharp-sour taste at first and creaminess and malts kick it after, but the aftertaste was bordering on ""huh""? Smooth, medium body mouthfeel and low carbonation. This is more typical, for me of a draft Guinness that the nitro-can I recently reviewed. I have to raise the drinkability score a bit, b/c of the mouthfeel. I still think Guinness fans might be better off with a fresh draft pour or the bottled ""extra stout"""
"Drinkability-Guinness Draught is the beer that made me realize there was more to beer than just Bud and Miller!"
"D: Not my best experience with this beer, I guess its sort of a suprise I've all you've been drinking are BMC beers but I think I'll pass on this one in the future."
"The first draw is incredibly smooth, medium bodied and satisfying. Rings of foam and lace are left behind with each successive pull. It has a faint roasted malt nose. The taste is distinctively Guinness, with a fine, almost inperceptble, carbonation masking a mild roasty bitterness till the dry finish. Overall, an outstanding beer when served fresh and constructed properly. A longstanding favorite of mine."
"D: Guinness Draught is a classic, very drinkable due to its lightness and easily a session beer. I would have liked to have seen and experienced it in days past when it wasn't so processed. Much better in the nitro-can, so go for that."
"Poured from a nitro-tap into a pint glass. This stout poured a deep black color with a one inch thick creamy beige head that lasted forever. Naturally, a good deal of lacing is left behind. Some lighter brown and mahongany colors are visible through the edges of the glass. Not much aroma other than some faint roasted malt notes. The flavor is also a bit bland. Some faint coffee notes sit behind a decent roasty flavor. The mouthfeel is lightly creamy due to the nitro infused head. The stout itself is a bit watery. Wow, I cant beleive I used to think this was top shelf stuff. There are so many other better stouts to explore. That being said, this is still much better than the bottled Guinness Extra Stout."
"Drinkability: I'll have a couple of these if I must.... but I prefer a thicker, more robust stout."
"Drinkability: Very accessible stout. Easy to find, and fairly drinkable."
"When at shit pubs with shit beer (can't avoid them all the time) Guiness is often my savior as it has some flavour at least."
"Every bar I go I order a pint, or every party i go to I bring the 6 pack. When I pour a bottle to a glass I'm treated to a 3 minute show where it goes from a light brown to a pitch black work of art. The smell of roasted hops eases my mind, and the 1st sip is as good as the last. Guinness is my number one session beer, as its low alcohol content allows me to enjoy a 6 pack with such ease. Brilliant!!"
"D: A very popular stout and for good reason. It is the benchmark for stouts because it can appeal to a wide range of people. Overall I am very impressed with this beer and will certainly have it again"
"D- my choice at places where the slection is sparce. While not the extra stout, on tap this is a good beer. Out of the can I will pass."
"drinkability: not a bad choice at all, if you can't get it on nitro-tap. Pour it up or drink it from the bottle, I tried both, and was pleasantly surprised."
"The bottom line: You can really do a whole lot worse, and a whole lot better. The main appeal of Guinness to me these day is that it is easy to access, as it is available even at places that only serve swill. It's not a particularly depthy beer, but it at least has some flavour profile, and I don't mind having one every once in a while."
"Drinkability: While a touch filling I don't have any problem putting away that 4 pack in a sitting... and at 4.2%ABV it won't sneak up on you."
"Guinness Draught is an extremely smooth beer. It is quite filling, so more than a couple will make a person full. Personally, I enjoy it as a dessert beer. So instead of getting a slice of pie for dinner, I like to get a Guinness."
"I just had my first Guinness in years. Ive had fond memories of this brand, because it was my introduction to the world beyond watery American lagers many years ago. Maybe my palate has evolved, but Im pretty sure theyve changed the product. It still pours beautifully, although Im convinced the head isnt quite as thick and creamy -- and its an eggshell white, rather than the creamy white I remember. Pleasantly mild roasty notes, but not as dry as I remember, and there isnt much of a finish at all. Maybe nostalgia is just coloring my memories, but the bottom line is, today I would consider this a decent refreshment beer but not at all one to savor."
"All told, probably the closest thing to ambrosia in the universe."
"D - Extremely drinkable. It's sweet and creamy but also roasty and bitter. Good stuff. I always drink this when I'm out at restaurants, shitty bars, ect. because I usually can't get anything good but this or SA lager, and when it comes down to it I'll usually get a Guinny."
"A bit over-rated, definitely better on-tap, but still a classic brew. Overall, a pretty reasonably tasty brew and a real gateway to the true craft brew market for many."
"A small child was walking along the road, looking for her mother, late one dark night in london. She found a pub, and, recalling her mother to drink the beer with the big 1759 on the label, she went in, wondering if perhaps her mother could be soliciting some business to bring back to the flat. Instead, she met the bartender, jake. Jake told her that her mother, the attractive brunette of about 115 lbs and a chopped haircut, had retired upstairs with a man that was wearing a rolex. katherine, for that was the little girl's name, thought a rolex was a type of filing system for papers and phone numbers. She wondered why her mommy would spend her whole retirement with an accountant. But jake, for that was the bartender's name, offered a new drink for her to taste. When she saw it, she was afraid. But England doesn't protect children from the amazing wiles of the dark. Katherine took a gulp. It tasted like whipped cream on top of the blackest soot-tea in the world. she took another. and another. soon she was joyful and frolicking, looking for her mommy or her uncle joe to take her home before she ate too much brie. Instead, her mommy came downstairs and introduced her to her new daddy, John D. Rockefeller. She went to live in the mansion of the wealthiest man alive, and grew up and married a respectable young man that loved her with all his heart."
"(11.2 oz nitro-bottle)"
"Though everything was pretty average, Guinness is still a very drinkable beer, and still a decent fall back."
"Overall, this is not as good as I remember Guinness being. Maybe it's because I'm looking at it more critically. It's just slightly better than BMC beers."
"really, i just don't get it. i don't get why this beer commands so much respect. i don't get why the everyman who has no idea what beer is gets me to come to some fucking shithole bar by telling me they have good beer (they saw the ubiquitous guinness tap). ok, it's dark and scary to bmc drinkers. so what? dark beers aren't my favorite anyways. the head is nice off the nitro can, though. guinness really does a good head. but so did some sluts when i was a youngin' and i saw no reason to stay with them more than once or twice. but somehow, i keep revisiting this beer, hoping for something more. must be all the ads. some roasted grain/malt aromas but not anything specific to discern. starts dry, finishes dry. short finish. some light malt flavors, that's it. no hop character to speak of. super light in body/abv. gassy, creamy mouthfeel. i'll just keep telling myself i won't do this again."
"taste is very good creamy, a faint coffee and roasted malty flavors, smooth is the main ke though. this beer is not one of those havey stouts or big stouts or robust stouts. ppl who need a wallop type drink may not like this. im reviewing it highly because the overall package is so good. the mouthfeel is a little lighter and a little more watery than i would like, but the beer is so creamy its worth it. This is a very drinkable beer. I had this right after i had a harp lager, and this beer was far more enjoyable. Once agin this is not one of those wowser stouts, its just a really good one, that would appeal to those ppl who dont like or arent in the mood for a ""big"" beer"
"this is a rereveiw from a while back when i thought beer was only miller lite looks very dark but every one should know that hell stevie wonder knows what this stuff looks like taste is a litle on the week side but still has a little complexity mouthfeel is exelent chalk one up to the nitro system drinkability is well...lets just say one could easily drink this all night"
"I have an ambivalent reaction to Guinness Draught  Guiness is different, they do provide a great alternative to yellow fizzy beer, but the beer itself is bland. This can be a plus for some people, but for me it tastes like roasted, liquid oatmeal. Aroma: boring, not much there. Initial taste is of sour, roasted grains. Mouth feel is creamy and soft, and bitter. The middle is low in surprises, followed by a tangy, hoppy finish. If you are having authentic Irish food, it is a great complement, but as a session beer, I prefer other brews."
"D - This beer is not so drinkble due to its incredible thickness, yet somehow I find myself able to go through several cans in a good night."
"Appearance from tap has a creamier head and the body was thicker than what comes from the nitro-bottle or nitro-can. Also had this beer on tap while passing through Ireland and Spain."
"I really appreciate Guinness for what it is. I don't usually order it, but it's always there for when I want it. A nice Irish Stout that I'm sure many craft beer lovers cut their teeth on. It's not the best stout in the world, but it serves its purpose well. Recommended."
"The perfect pour of Guinness is a piece of art. At first all you see is black with almost no head but then you start seeing the downward flowing bubbles and mysterious swirls of tan and amber as the head slowly forms into a tan masterpiece. Although it looks black it is light and non filling. Truly a great classic."
"Guinness will always have a special place in my heart. It was the first beer that lured me away from being an ignorant Miller Lite drinker and introduced me to a world of flavor, but my intake is now limited to tap-only and I won't pay more than $4 for one now that I am of the enlightened ranks."
"D - I enjoy this beer quite a bit, and can drink 5 or 6 in a row if it's all that's around, but it's quite filling and thick tasting. I need to switch after a few if I have the option. But it leads into and back out of a nice whit nicely."
"D - It's a good drinking Irish Dry Stout on St. Patty's Day or any other day of the year"
"What can you say about Guinness that hasn't been said already. I prefer the authentic pub variety but this will do in a pinch. Thx."
"Despite the quibbles  and the existence of much better stouts  this is a good, crowd-pleasing standby. I still enjoy it with scrambled eggs, sausage and HP Sauce while watching Premiership football on Saturday mornings."
"Drinkability: light bodied, you can have many in one night"
"Ahh, Guinness. My introduction to ""dark beer", back in my college days. Not much I can say that hasn't already been said. This is one of, if not THE, prettiest beer there is. Poured from a nitro-can, the cascading effect is hypnotizing, resulting in a head that just doesn't quit. The lacing on the edge of the glass after each sip is equally impressive. Tastes...like a Guinness. Not as fantastic as I remember that first sip being, but still pretty good. Mouthfeel is a bit disappointing - more watery than I remember. But, that makes it easy to drink. People who say Guinness is ""too heavy"" need to have their heads examined. The relatively light mouthfeel and average ABV make this a very drinkable beer - I try to keep a few in my fridge at all times."
"Yes goot ole risky whiskey! gotta try the combo!"
"Drinkability: Many times, this is the only non light beer available in bars, so I find myself with this in my hand a decent amount. For me, it is better than Bud Light, if that's a compliment?"
"What more can be said about Guinness. This clearly isn't as good as what you will find on tap at a bar that has fresh Guinness that knows how to pour it. The right experience on tap can be exhilirating. I still want to go to the Guinness plant and have it at peak freshness in order to compare it to the best of what we get on this side of the Atlantic. Having said all that, the nitro can is decent, creamy, and a reasonable take home alternative. The smell is a little tinny, but good and malty. The taste is water, roasted barley malt, and a little bit of tin. The lacing is excellent, if you want to call it lacing, in that it billows on the sides of your glass. There is no sweetness in this beer, very dry, all malt, no bitterness, lots of water. It isn't a strong beer by any standards and the alcohol taste is completely absent. The cream is good right out from the pour, but it does dissipate a bit towards the end of the pint glass. I like Guinness, always have, and it works in the right setting, complementing the right food. It's better on tap, and I'm sure better across the Atlantic, but if you crave a dry, malty, Irish stout, this is where you have to begin. You don't have to end here since Beamish or Murphy's is probably a better next stop. L'Chaim"
"Um..what's all the fuss? There is very little redeeming in this brew. Nice black appearance with that cool Guinness head, nice cascading effect in the pour. There is almost no smell beyond a slight grain aroma, no roast like the Extra Stout. In the same way that Budweiser tastes ""watered-down", so too with the Draught. The texture is by far the most redeeming feature of this schlock: creamy and full, hampered by thinness, but I'm willing to dole out the 4. Sorry to see such a venerable brand brought down by the bottom line. Boo Diageo."
"Thia isn't the greatest beer on the planet and its a far cry from the best of the Guinness products, but it does offer a certain amount of refreshment on a hot day with more flavor than a macro offers. This is by far the lightest stout I have ever tried,and the bottle is my least favorite method for drinking it. Pours a very dark brown with the trademark cascading effect in the glass Some okay lacing as well. The smell is thin,but there are some roasted grain and bitter chocolate notes as well as a slight whiff of iron. The taste is very thin with more lightly toasted grain and metal. Mouthfeel is creamy and refreshing and that combined with the low abv means you can definitely toss them down- just not a lot to keep you interested."
"D same as above"
"D - It's delicious, but sort of filling. I wish I could drink more."
"D - The classic Irish stout. Great flavor, average body, but very easy to drink."
"dark almost black body with thick creamy white head that (took up almost the whole glass at first then filtered down to a small white head at the top. Smell of toasted malts, chocolate, and cream. This is good but it doesn't have all that much flavor. Light malts with a hint of coffee. Mouthfeel is excellent, very creamy with medium body and little carbonation."
"The aroma was fairly neutral, with the faintest hint of espresso. The mouthfeel (big surprise) was very smooth. I tasted some caramel flavors up front mixed with roasted coffee, which became assertive towards the finish, which was fairly dry. Overall, a more this is Guinness light compared to the Extra Stout, and less interesting -- but also more quaffable -- and that's the idea. That said, I'd still prefer the Extra Stout, as it has just that extra bit of flavor."
"My dad got me a 4-pack of cans for St. Patrick's Day. Too bad it wasn't Murphy's or the Extra Stout, but this will do. An easy drinking stout, it's better than the nitro-bottle (you can see my review from that), as the taste isn't as rusty and much smoother. That being said, the roasted flavors are very faded for a stout with little else coming in to bail it out."
"Doubt I'd have even ordered it if not for the holiday. The thinness in the mouth is the most disappointing. I don't have much trouble drinking more than one, but find that I rarely want to."
"Overall good drinkability, low abv so Happy St. Pats and have another!"
"Drinkability - Session-able, but not the best stout around. I will go for something else if it is available."
"D: It's my understanding that this brew is meant to be consumed a few pints (or more) at Irish celebrations. As stated above, the pints I had tonight were much lighter than what I remember before. Almost weant down too easy. Very good, very refreshing. However, if this is what true Guinness tastes like, it might actually be a little too light for the style. That said, I still enjoyed it."
"Pours a black color with pillowy tan head, leaving that fantastic cascading effect. Nice sticky lacing on the side of the glass. Unfortunately that is the only good thing about this beer. Not much smell, some light roasted malt small. The taste is pretty awful, tastes watery over pasturized, not much flavor at all. The feel is watery, not what I expect from a stout. The drinkability is ok if you like really watery non-sweetened ice coffee."
"Pours nearly black in color with ruby hints at the edges and a light tan head that ultimately settles to about a half inch after the beautiful cascade effect. Smells of sweet roasted malts. Taste is dominated by the sweet roasted malts but there is also a nice bitterness there as well. Good mouthfeel. Very light in body. Great drinkability due to the low abv, light body and the beauty that is a properly drawn pint."
"Sampled on tap at The Brick Store in Decatur, Georgia, on St. Patrick's Day. Sits in the glass with that cascading effect and the creamy head that just won't relent. It's a dark beer, appearing black until you hold it up to the light, and then it's deep red. Not much in the smell, maybe a hint of hops and a sour odor like sour cream. The flavor isn't as roasty as most microbrewed stouts, but there is a hint of chocolate in the aftertaste. Sweet but pleasant. The mouthfeel is thin - definitely not as viscous as stouts tend to be. It's pretty drinkable, though perhaps a little too much carbonation. In all, a safe alternative to Bud, but it will not satisfy hardcore beer geeks accustomed to Shakespeare Stout and the like. A great session beer."
"D - I want to try this out of the can or bottle...and I want it at a temperature more suited to my liking...not from the tap. It needs another chance."
"D: Really really drinkable for a stout due mainly to the lightness of the brew which is both a good and bad thing. What other beer tastes like a milkshake when added to Jameson and Baileys I ask... surely thats worth a 1/2 a point. Happy St. Patty's Day."
"So there the Guinness tap handle sits next to two other ultra crappy beers, and calls my name. At first I balk. ...""Why be a beer snob?"" I think. To Bartender: ""I'll have a Guinness."""
"Nitro Can. Excellent body with a gorgeous head. Goes down extremely smoothly and leaves an excellent aftertaste. Every time I drink this beer I find it puts a very slight meaty taste in my mouth and I end up having to down a sausage right after. Excellent beer. No regrets!"
"had this tonight as a half and half with sierra nevada brown ale!! excellent brews to mix!"
"D - Drinkable on occasion, I can't drink it on a regular basis but it's damn good during the cold winter months."
"Notes: A good Guinness every now and again -- preferably on tap --is still a treat, though my tastebuds have moved on from a beer that I used to drink seemingly by the gallon. On the positive side, it's a nice looking beer with the cascading nitro effect, and it's very drinkable because it's so light. There is some flavor there, but it's not nearly as interesting as other stouts. And it really doesn't smell or feel like much at all. Funny that so many folks look at this beer and think ""ohmigod -- it's so DARK and HEAVY"" and miss the boat entirely. A good beer to have around the house for guests, and like I said, you can drink a lot of 'em without getting too full or drunk. But there are far better stouts out there. . . ."
"NB: If Guinness didn't blend their CO2 with nitrogen, I suspect that this would be a pretty shitty beer."
"Not as good as at the bar, but I'll always have one or two in the fridge just to be safe."
"One interesting thing is that having it from the can eliminates the effect that a bar's tap and lines can have on the beer. I definitely have to wonder if I haven't been to a few bars that were a little lax with their cleanliness."
"I tasted this at the Guinness Believer event in Atlanta, to confirm why I am a Guinness devotee."
"Guinness is definately a change of pace if you're drinking nothing but American Stouts. Many people go in expecting that same flavor and are severely disappointed. Don't be. Give it a chance and you'll find that this brew has a beauty all its own."
"Notes: Its just alright at best. As it warmed up this actually gets worse as there is a slightly astringent middle."
"Poured from Nitro-Can into a mug. It's Guinness, obviously the amazing process of pouring and watching the beer settle is part of the great experience of drinking this beer. Poured that famed dark guinness color with 2 fingers of tan head. Thick lacing on glass when swirled. Smells of nice chocolaty and nutty scents, very pleasant to the nostril. Taste is good, chocolatey followed by a coffee taste. I would like to try other stouts to compare. Unique when compared with other types of beers. Not as thick as it may look, but still quite thick, definatley not a beer to get drunk off of as it is filling and of a lower abv. A great full bodied beer that everyone must try at least once, the pride of Ireland."
"This is the best brew just to have in the fridge at all times. Not something that you expect to be complex, and full of artistry and masterfulness. It is what it is...old faithful. It's always there, and always good."
"My first nitro bottle, ehh is all I have to say. Poured fantastically, if you have never seen it you must, the cascade is just gorgeous. A very slight roasted malt, but that is about it. The taste is just flat to me. I am spoiled maybe by the good stouts that I can find, but this is just bland. No real presence, too oily and not enough character. The presentation is beautiful, but looks can be decieving."
"What can you say about Guinness that hasn't been said before? It's a way of life and a national treasure. I believe that Guinness can be substituted as a whole meal. Two of these bad boys and your good to go. As echoed before, If you have never seen a glass filled with this beauty, then your in store for a sight. Highly recommended."
"A.K.A. ""Vitamin G"". I for one am darn glad that they enjoy the distribution that they have (prefer Murphy's). I recall recently ordering a nitro-can in a smaller Midwest town and folks in the bar gathered around to watch. Anything other than a can of AB was an 'event'. I thought someone was going to call the news team...maybe they were the news team. ""I was counted"" 2007 toast. To heck with beer snobs."
"If you haven't seen one after a pour you need to...everyone should. This beer is a classic goodie that won't let you down. The taste is a deep dark taht will really impress you. It's not so much a standby as it is an occasional beer. At least for me anyway. If you haven't try you definately need to."
"A good fall-back beer to have in places where there is no cask ale."
"A good sipping beer that takes a little effort in order to really appreciate all there is to offer. I usually do not drink more than 2 or 3 of these in a sitting as it seems like a great deal of work past that point. Good beer all around."
"probably more ruby in color than black, but when first poured, it appears jet black. big ultra-creamy head is very appealing. smell is faintly of cold coffee, maybe a chocolate flavored coffee. a good smell, just not necessarily a great smell experience. (what?!?) very creamy in the mouth, which i like, with flavors of milk, chocolate, coffee, and mild roasted elements. everything is extremely balanced and rounded out, which has its advantages and draw-backs. very enjoyable, easy to drink many of. often this is a go-to beer when in a primarily-macro environment."
"If Guinness would brew a beer with some character (besides their extra stout, which is too sweet), and export it to the US, I believe they would have a lucrative market, if they would be willing to give it a shot."
"Besides just drinking these by themselves, it's always a treat to buy some Bass and make black & tans at home."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: One of the best aspects of Guinness is that it has plenty of flavor and yet is smooth and very drinkable. And also with a relatively low ABV, you can have a few without tipping over."
"D: Within the style this beer is tasty, but it’s not a style that I favor. It goes down very easily which has caused this beer to gain so much appeal. I used to think that I couldn’t handle this beer, but after having tried a wide range of high ABV beers and knowing that this beer has the ABV of a Light Lager, I now realize that I simply don’t like it. Having said that, I still appreciate the quality of this beer with respect to its style."
"drinkability - Not a bad beer. Interesting creamy top, never seen head like this. Enoyed the beer and will try it again."
"Guinness draft. A. Beautiful to look at. Thick dark creamy head covers deep dark opague brew. 5. Smell. Slight roasted malt. 3. T. Toasted bread slight malt. Almost neutral in taste. I think I drinking too many imperial stouts. Or maybe this is just bland. 3. Mouthfeel. Thin more carbonation than I remember. I used to really like this. I am not sure this was pulled properly."
"Poured from a nitro-can into a pint glass. Guinness is, for my money, a gorgeous looking beer - this may be a function of the nitro-can, but nothing beats the pitch black pour and the perfect tan head that sticks around forever. It's beautiful. But the smell and taste disappoint. The smell is odd - kind of like tomato soup and cheap coffee. The taste is, well, almost non-existent. There is a very faint coffee bitterness followed by slight sweetness, reminds me of flavored water. Mouthfeel is thin - there's no carbonation and slight creaminess, but too thin. This is drinkable - it is like a stout for those who don't like too much complexity. A very straightforward beer. Not recommended."
"- my sentiments exactly... drink this if you don't like flavorful beer...."
"Guinness has its place among us as a ""gateway beer"" and may it forever lead more and more beer drinkers to beer nirvana."
"This beer goes down like a champ, thanks again to our friend nitro. Low carbonation (obviously) makes a very smooth drinkable beer. Enjoy one of the better mass produced stouts out there. But enjoy it on tap."
"Always follow the 2 min. pour rule. Guinness Draught is best served at 6°C (thats 42.8°F), with the legendary two-part pour. First, tilt the glass to 45 degrees and carefully pour until three quarters full. Then place the glass on the bar counter and leave to settle. Once the surge has settled, fill the glass to the brim. It takes about 119.5 seconds to pour the perfect pint. But dont fret. Its worth the wait. May cause love at first taste!"
"Good for drinking it very, very cold."
"All this time I'd been thinking I've reviewed this one, but apparently not. Sampled from the nitro-bottle, which isn't designed to be poured into a glass, so I threw all my beer experience to the wind and reviewed this as they intended - straight from the bottle. Probably the only time that will ever happen. Anyway, it is black, presumably, and because I cannot actually see it I just gave it a 3 for appearance. It smells roasted, with coffee, oats? and an interesting character that kept saying ""ash-tray," although it isn't as bad as that implies. It tastes the same with the addition of a mild bitterness on top of a smooth, lactic body with low carbonation (nitration maybe is the correct word?) and a medium finish. Not too bad, but if I'm going to drink the draught I'd prefer the can. On the same token however, if I'm going to drink Guinness I'd rather imbibe the extra stout."
"Not a real enjoyable beer."
"Maybe the first but not the king of stouts IMHO."
"D: Why not drink a beer that tastes like a meal, but isn't heavy on calories?"
"I had this at a local restaurant on a nitro-tap. It was served much too cold, but looked delicious, with a tan appearance that settled as into a uniform dark-brown color. The too cold temperature I think helped deaden an already faint aroma, to the extent that I couldn't smell a thing. Taste was much more subtle than I remember - with a good but faint caramel taste. Mouthfeel is very light and a bit thin and watery. This beer is surprisingly drinkable; I felt like I could drink Guinness all night."
"Nitro bottle poured into a glass. Appearance is dark black, with light reddish tinges at the edges of the glass. Foamy, cappucino colored head with strong lacing. Smell is coffee, chocolate, underlying hops. Taste is very much the same, with very little alcohol taste, and the slight hop flavor bringing the taste of coffee out even more, with hints of chocolate. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, very nice. Drinkability is wonderful, I could go on this one all night. I'll definitely be keeping this one handy from now on."
"D: Extremely easy to drink, which is why I like it. And I chuckle when people order a Bud or something after saying ""Guinness is too filling and has too many calories."" It's got quite a mythology associated with it, that's for sure. Easy to drink quickly. Many times out this is the best beer on-tap, which isn't a bad thing."
"Subdued flavors, but true to the style (definition of the style?) and bland enough to be highly drinkable."
"Not much different from the nitro can except for maybe the size of the head. Not my preferred way of drinking this beer. I probably will just stick to the cans."
"Drinkablilty: I finished about half the glass, and gave the rest a drain pour. I haven't done this to too many beers, but I just couldn't finish this one. I thought I was going to throw up."
"Mouthfeel is of burnt wood bitterness with some sweet caramel, and vanilla lingering to a sweet finish. Medium bodied and slightly astringent."
"Pours out a cloudy pale that falls like a waterfall into black with a thick head that stays throughout the whole beer. The smell is roasty and light with some sweet molasses tones in it. Taste is watery and it's hard to detect, but once you get a taste it's not great. The roasty flavors have turned into a chemical flavor that makes me cringe. The mouthfeel is watery and unimpressive. I don't think I'll ever have this ever again."
"Drinkability. Yum. If you like U.K. stouts, you will definately like this beer. If not, then quit reading this review right now. Anyway...it's nicely balanced in all respects, and the Nitrogen charging makes a good beer great."
"Typical Guinness in a bottle with a widget rather than can. I don't really get it. It's in the bottle so you can drink it out of the bottle, right? Since when did it become so hard to find glassware? Hell, a plastic pint glass will do. But I guess this is all about show. In any case, I found it no different from the canned version. I didn't think the widget did as good a job, but that was with a single pour with just a few pauses along the way."
"The color is sublime and the head is there all the way through. It is always hard for me to describe the taste of stout to other people, but in comparison to other stouts I've had this one reaches the best balance, its not too bitter, not too heavy, the perfect roasted flavor without overpowering, Works great with just about any type of food, and is light enough to drink by itself. Ive had it both on tap and in the nitro can, and I find that they are indistinguishable from each other."
"Always great poured over a bent spoon atop Bass Pale Ale or Harp Lager as well!"
"Now in a new plastic wrapped bottle with instructions at the bottom that state ""serve extra cold"". They must relly be trying to get to the masses with that and the cheesy bottle wrapping. Beyond that it's a pretty good easily found stout."
"Packaged in the 11.2oz nitro bottle. There is no information given about freshness, but some nutriant info is given, and there is the cool widget inside the bottle. When the cap is popped, you hear the nitrogen bubbling through the beer. This beer is one of the more impressive looking beers out there. As it was poured into my Bell's pint glass, a creamy head instantly formed, with nitrogen bubbles cascading to the bottom of the glass. After settiling a bit, a creamy tan half inch head remains throughout the whole experience. The beer is very dark, hints of brown are visible when held to the light, but this brew is pretty opaque. Aroma presents a creamy roastyness, with a mild sour side. Not a whole lot of flavor. Dry, faint hints of roasted malt are present. There is a slight sourness to this beer, according to charlie papazian, guiness adds a bit of pasteurized sour beer to each batch of guiness. Overall a pretty bland tasting beer. The mouthfeel is decently thick, as a stout should be, but something seems to be missing, maybe not thick enough? This is an enjoyable brew, but unfortunately it costs about $8.50 for a sixer of 11.2oz bottle. When I go to the store and I see small bottles of guiness for the same price as regular bottle of Bell's double cream stout, I choose the Bell's. If this were cheaper, I'd like it more, but it's just not worth it."
"Poured from a nitro-can, into a pint glass. This has to be one of the best beers, appearance wise. The beer pours a fantastic 1inch head, that never quite goes away, leaving some nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is very creamy, kind of like chocolate milk. The taste is much like the aroma, being very creamy, with a slight chocolaty flavor. The mouthfeel is a little thin, IMO, for a stout. This is an exceptionally easy beer to drink. A great session beer."
"Served on tap into a pint glass, this beer has a very well retained head, as well as good lacing. At first the smell is smokey, with hints of nuts. The beer feels great and is well carbonated, not too much. A very smokey taste, with caramel flavorings coming out. First time having one, and it went down smooth. I will definately try this agian next time I'm out."
"Poured a dark brown color with the faintest of light just barely shining through the glass. There was a large creamy head that is typical for the nitro stouts. Aroma was malty with just a hint of roasted malt. Taste was coffeeish and roasty with a light sourness in the finish. Mouthfeel was light, creamy and smooth making this very drinkable. This type of stout lacks the character that the regular bottled version is known for, but it's not a bad brew at all and is very sessionable with it's light character and low alcohol. Given a choice between the standard macro light beers and this, the Guinness draft wins every time."
"Lastly, for relatively low-carb beers, this isn't half bad (only 9.9 g per 12 oz.). Much better than most other sub-10g beers."
"DA: THe low ABV % makes this an all-day drinker...and you gotta respect the classics."
"D: Flavourful, low in alcohol, easy on the gas, quite drinkable."
"First time in a long time. Trying this brew on draught is one of the most classic and endearing moments in beer. The look of the nitro-carbonation sheading the beer and floating to the top is something special. The head retention is basically a milk shake for stout lovers. Slight aromas of roasted grains, chalkiness, and mild souring. Flavors and moderate and firm, ranging from charcoal, roasted grains, mild lactose, and and underlying sweet maltiness. The feel of this beer is always supurb. Full and creamy, then thinning into a powdery, soft finish. Quite dry and fleeting in the aftertaste. It's the taste that defined the style. How can it be anything but great?"
"Pours a cascading black with a tightly-packed creamy off-white head (Looks good, despite the bottle saying ""Drink straight from the bottle""). Lots of gloppy lacing as only Guinness can do. Aroma is nice fresh Guinness Draught. Coffee grounds, burnt toast, lots of roasted malt. Taste is creamy coffee front, roasted malty middle, and slightly sour burnt finish. Mouthfeel was creamy smooth. Lovely brew as always."
"Good stout. Poured can into a glass mug. Let settle. Beautiful dark and tan color with a off-white head. You can smell the hops as soon as it's poured. Can taste a pleasantly slight bitter taste with a strong roasted barley aftertaste. Very smooth and thick mouthfeel. Very drinkable, but one should do you good for a little while due to its thickness."
"Drinkability- Overall this is an ok beer. It isnt the best beer in the world but it will do just nicely at the beer full of swill. For the price that people pay for Guinness you would be better off buying Murphys Stout or any other craft stout with more character."
"D: Extremely drinkable, I dont think I could watch a football game with out one."
"Out of a nitro can this is a classic and beautiful beer. Black, even when held up to the light and a creamy smooth head. One of my favorites before I really knew anything about beer. But now I realize that there is very little complexity to this brew and it is not quite as stout as a stout should be. The taste is very malty with an obvious chocolaty finish. Very smooth and highly drinkable, but leaving something to be desired if you want a really good stout."
"The drinkability was average or maybe a bit better but I did not get a second. MK"
"Eric"
"If you want an intro to stouts this is the classic brew. It's easy to drink, looks pretty and is available just about anywhere. I look forward to trying this in Ireland one day, where I hear the taste is much different. Until then, this is a nice sessionable alternative. Brilliant!"
"This is definitely a sipping beer. A classic in every sense."
"Smell is a little smokey and a litte roasted. Taste is mostly roasted bitterness, not a very strong taste. Mouthfeel is creamy but i prefer more carbonation in a beer. While its not my first choice of stouts, its a readily available and a nicely drinkable session beer. As my glass says its a lovely day for a guinness."
"i guess you aren't supposed to pour this out of the bottle, but i love that thick pour."
"I guess they put the widget in a bottle for those who fear canned beer. Nothing different here, just smooth velvety light bitter choclate and burnt coffee with that classic tang from the little proportion of soured beer. Very drinkable, and lacking in character with every successive time I buy one (only once every few months - just as a benchmark stout refresher course). Just because there are so many more flavorful versions out there is no reason to disparage this old standby. We all remember a time when we looked up to this beer in awe and admiration."
"Pours neatly into a chilled pint glass. The brown foam eventually settles out to a dark ruby red as seen through the glass when held upto a light. Smells of sour dough and faint spice. Head is creamy and thick like yeast foam when making bread. Unpleasantly sour tasting makes this beer not easily drank. Not smooth my taste buds became overwhelmed with the sourness and bitterness through out. Not a beer I would buy again."
"Very drinkable. Goes great with vanilla ice cream, or even Stout Floats. I love this one."
"I can drink these like there's no tomorrow, a great session beer. This is the standard for Irish Stouts, the grand-pappy of them all."
"The drinkability factor is through the roof in my estimation. You have all of the more appealing components of beer that make it grand. A dark and substantial flavour with a well titrated richness that never overwhelms coupled with a mouthfeel that is deceiving and vacillates betwixt thickness and light qualities. This beer just provokes me to sip it incessantly. With the somewhat slight abv, one can enjoy copious amounts of this and never become burdened by the effects. This is truly worthy of my praise. Well crafted. Easy to consume. Just plain enjoyable. I regret that I paid this beer no heed for such a long while as now it is a regular denizen of my cooling chamber. Live and learn."
"I am not sure if I have ever had the Foreign Stout or Extra Draught, but I look forward to their example, because this one just does not do it for me, compared to all the much more flavourful and stronger American Stouts. Give me a Murphy's any day of the week, over this."
"The mouthfeel is smooth and has a very pleasant texture. Drinkability is very good, especially with 4,2% alcohol in it."
"It's a session ale, so of course this beer is drinkable, moreso if you ""serve extra cold", which quite often is the case. What's that about?"
"This old standby doesn't really lose much in nitro bottle form compared to nitro can. A: Black and opaqueness over ruby red with the usual beautiful settling nitro, mod carbonation and tell tale tan head. S: Coffee and cocoa with a smoky hint T: malted chocolate with coffee flavors strong throughout and a very mild hop bitterness to finish. M: Medium thickness and lighter than the appearance would suggest D: outstanding due to lower caloric and alc. content. It's very rarely that Vitamin G lets you down."
"D-A very drinkable beer, with the great benefit of being low in cals and not hefty in alc. % either. Tasty, good looking, and sweet smelling, pick this one up!"
"I decided to try Guinness in a nitro-bottle. It was smooth but I've had much better stouts. It is just a mass producded, water down beer that I'd just drink to get drunk fast because the nitrogen bubbles allow me to imbibe fast. I do like the new bottle design but if you want a real stout try Left Hand's Milk Stout."
"My original favorite... But I have not had a Guinness in a while. I've been trying a lot of new beers and drinking a lot of flavorful craft beers, so I figured it was high time to review it. The appearance is great Black opaque body with about an inch of light tan creamy head. Smells of chocolate, malt, and a hint of alcohol. Tastes chocolatey, slightly roasty... Maybe just a tad sour? I think the nitro is dulling the flavor though. Not as good as I remember... I think that it's better fresh on tap than in the can, but I think this is more of a fall-back beer than a standby these days..."
"Had one at PF Chang's in Greenville, SC. Pours a rich, robust dark brown/black with a thin tan head. Smells like weak roasted coffee. Taste is of burnt coffee and roasted malts. Mouthfeel is entirely too thin for me. In the future, I will stick to the REAL Guinness, the Export Stout."
"D: This is a very smooth beer that is a good way to settle down afterwork. It goes down decently but not my favorite stout."
"Guinness Draught was almost black, but was actually a dark crimson red color when held to a light. The head was fantastic, thick and creamy with great retention and plenty of lacing left behind. The smell was very light, but roasted grains are noticeable. The taste is of dark malt and a little coffee. The finish is a little bitter. The mouthfeel was light with light carbonation. A decent beer, but I prefer the extra stout over this nitro stuff."
"I must admit, that when I began beer drinking I could not stomach a Guinness even for money. However, now it is perhaps my favorite beer. I am in preparation for my Oktoberfest party and decided to try out the 1985 Munich Oktoberfest stein I have just bought. The decision was made to christen it with two nitro bottles of Guinness. I find that as I age I appreciate Guinness for its robust flavors and its smooth nature."
"I also recommend Beamish and Murphys from the Irish Stout holy Trinity, I like all three for varying reasons."
"D - This is the beer that's gotten me to prefer getting new brews over new whiskeys. I consider this my ""goto"" beer when session drinking occurs. WIth its low alcohol content and low carbonation they're easy to drink but oddly filling. Hence the ""it's like a meal in a can!"" saying."
"The beer itself is not horrible (its not great either) I guess i just don't like the draught beer in a can concept. I realize the company wants to be able to market to a large audience, but to realy enojy a draught, go to a pub, order it, wait a few minutes for it to be poured correctly, then enjoy. No its not the best beer in the world, it just has a feeling to it. It needs to be enojoyed in a pub, preferably in an Irish Pub, and even better in a pub in or around Dublin."
"Silky texture, light carbonation, and full bodied flavour all the way back."
"This has the appearance and the smell that remind you of a Guinness, but after that it drops off a little. The appearance is black/very dark brown with zero transparency and a tan head that is light and creamy. The smell is complex with hints of toffee and raisins to suggest a couple. The taste is light, smooth, and smoky but a bit watered-down. The mouthfeel is also very watery, not as creamy or stimulating as I would have hoped for, yet the lightness does make this easy to drink. A good beer, but the nitro bottle doesn't do it justice."
"This is the rating for the 14.9 oz. (440ml) can w/ widget. Lightest mouthfeel of the 3 rated here. Sweetest of the 3. In the middle with the sour/chalk aftertaste..."
"Guinness pours ruby black with a beautiful creamy white head that lingers for quite a while. Smell is light chocolate and roasted malts. I taste the same, as well as a very slightly sour flavor. When it warms there is an apparent roasted flavor. The nitro can does a great job visually but I'm just not impressed with it otherwise."
"Overrated. but respectable."
"Nonetheless, this is a very drinkable beer; one should stick with the Extra Stout variety when looking for a Guinness (Stateside, anyway) with real flavor."
"Pours with a creamy tan color with cascading waves of brown liquid forming under a thick tan head. After about 20 seconds the motion stops and the rich roasted aromas spring forth. The flavor yields a similar dry, roasted barley character, with the roasted aspect becoming more pronounced as the brew warms toward ambient temperature. Simply one the best ever brewed."
"11.2 ounce bottle with shrink wrapped label."
" The cascading head is always very pretty. Both the smell and taste are middle of the road for stouts. Clearly, the brewers have positioned this one for the mass market but that doesn't mean it's not a good beer just one that won't overwhelm those used to macrobrews and might underwhelm those who have sampled the better craft stouts."
"A decent beer. Pales in comparison to their extra stout, as well as other stouts in general. Probably better in a glass out of a nitro can, definitely better on tap. I still use Guinness Draught as a way to start out the night in a bar if I'm not sure what I want or I just want to have something when I'm with people. This is still a good beer for the summer when you want something relatively strong with a roasty flavor instead of something hoppy (or bland). Also seems a little overpriced at ~$7-$8 per six pack for what you get. One thing is for sure though: The beer tastes much better than the widget."
"A very close match to the draft, and very different from the extra stout. They are all good in their own way. This one is videly available, making it a solid backup option for the fancier stuff I usually go for. Great to come back to if you've forgotten how good it is. Cheers"
"Appearance: Dark ruby brown body that cascades into a velvety black tone and forms a lucious textured biscuit tan head which rises above the rim of my glass, very nice. Aroma: Has dark roasted malts which give off the tone of dark roasted coffee roasts, dark cocolate, and creamy slightly acidic notes along with an herbal hop character. Taste somewhat metallic with more soured acidic chocolate milk with old coffee melded in, a very signature Guinness taste to it light hopping is evident with the herbal hop flavor. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth and lighter bodied with a definite smooth factor going on. Drinkability...this is a definite keystone of transitioning into better beer I can drink this in number although since discovering stout I've found many brews in that style that I crave over Guinness Draught."
"drank a few during a Steelers game out of my buddy's kegerator. Very impressive style that kept my attention. The aftertaste was delightful and drinkablity was perfect. Leaving the beer sit on the table and become lukewarm enhanced the flavor, although when it is served ice cold the flavor is good."
"¡Salud!"
"I can still recall not being able to finish one of these back in college and dreaded drinking them with friends at Notre Dame tailgaters a few years back. Maybe I've developed a taste for other styles but this one is just your average stout with a good mouthfeel and appearance, especially poured out of a nitro can. Great carbonation and head, smooth mouthfeel. Though no impressive smell, it's not too bad at all."
"I remember when I thought Guinness was the finest beer in production.... as my Guinness poster that dates from my college days attests. I know better now. Still a damn decent brew, and when I feel like having something a little lighter, I'll still have one of these. Ironic isn't it, that one would have a ""stout"" as lighter fare than the usual?"
"Drinkability: Not a party beer! This is a beer that is to be enjoyed in a relaxed setting. This is not a beer to chug, it is a beer to sit back, drink slowly, and enjoy. This is a break from the world to relax and enjoy."
"Had this at a bar -- otherwise wouldn't have tried the bottled version (the nitro-can version is ok). Beer pours a dark black-ish color, but has none of the great ""surging"" look that it is supposed to have. A real disappointment to start out with. The smell is very minimal, but it's really watered down compared to what a Guinness is supposed to smell like. Tastes a bit like a Guinness, but again, the flavor is a bit watered down and it has none of the thick, heavy, creamy flavor and feel of the original. As a beer it's drinkable, but not as a Guinness. What a joke... stay away from Guinness in a bottle!"
"Poured this classic from a bottle, dark brown with thick creamy off white head. As far as appearance goes, you can't beat this. Roastiness dominates the aroma. Taste is roasted malts and I get some acidity. The mouthfeel is pretty thin. This is a goodt beer to session, often in places that don't have anything besides this worth drinking."
"As for the second sampling, which was had straight from the bottle as suggested, well, lets just say while I know Guinness is something of a classic, based on this sampling, its really more hype than substance."
"Vigorous and slightly rougher pour into a pint glass to intensify the effervescent waterfall effect, appearance is an opaque ruby edged black with a full finger of light beige head that exhibits decent head retention. Aroma is light, mainly made up of roasty grain and sweet malts, very simple and pleasing to the nose. Taste is also light, just as it smells with some creaminess and bitter unsweetened cocoa and espresso notes. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate levels of carbonation, most likely an effect of the nitro widget's delivery. Goes down quickly and easy, washes off the tongue effortlessly given the light body. Remarkably refreshing, very enjoyable brew. Drinkability is good, easy to drink and appreciate, low abv. Will definitely purchase again, great standby beer that one could develop cravings for if not careful."
"Overall pretty bland and boring."
"D: The world famous Guinness. Not bad out of the can but better on draft. You know what you are getting when you drink this beer....if you don't then welcome to the world of beer, you've got a lot to learn!"
"Overall its decent. It's that one all those bmc drinkers ask if you like, gauging it and your taste buds on the color because they see it as a ""meal in a can."" Horse shit. But that aside, it is doable, but i certainly have to be in the mood for it, otherwise it may make me a little nausious."
"Felt like a Guinness today at lunch. The bottle is pretty neat, I suppose, nice shape, different. Smell was light malty and coffee like. Taste was watery coffee grounds with a hint of sweet malts, I much prefer the extra stout, though this is certainly better than most of the options at the local pizza shop. Mouthfeel is up my alley, smooth and refreshing, people who feel that guinness is soupy and thick rather confuse me. I think I could drink these all night long, in a party situation, the ABV seems lower than the already low suggested 4.2, then again, I've been into Storm King, of late."
"I am going to take another approach and say there are two ways I have had this beer and they are the best, one is as part of the best bloody mary I have ever had, bloody mary mix, horshradish, worchester, salt pepper, vodka, and guinness on tap to top it off, excellent, also as the main ingredient in cooking corned beef, the recipe is simple, huge piece of corned beef, spices are usually in the packet, dump that into a crock pot, pour in two tall cans of Guinness, let cook on low for 8 hours and serve."
"I always like to throw back a Guinness Draught when I'm already pretty hammered. Won't get you belligerent because the ABV is a bit lower and goes down easily because of the watery complexion. The appearance is always the high part of this beer. In its trademark glass, its a classic look and is hard to beat with the creamy brown head! The smell is of roasted malt (of course...) and a bit cocoa-ish. Taste is very different; especially if youre just getting into stouts (my buddies still consider this undrinkabily bitter for some reason). Tastes like chocolate mixed with coffee. Mouthfeel is always the downfall of a mass produced stout. Watery and feels flat. Which is EXACTLY why I like to drink it after a few heavier beers, cuts the bloating down a bit. Drinkability is just outstanding and I'd session with this any day if everyone else brings the regular BMC products to a get together, plus! It stirs some conversations! Brilliant!"
"Choosing a favorite beer is like choosing a favorite child but if I had to choose one this would be it. The beer pours a smooth dark brown with definite layers that separate into an opal color with a creamy head. A rich smoky smell. A crisp taste with a chocolaty after taste. The beer has a smooth creamy feel and that doesnt linger too long in your mouth. This is a beer I could drink all day and not get over powered by its flavor. It's rich enough that it's not boring but crisp enough that it doesnt over work your pallet."
"Really, among the beers available to us today, Guinness wouldn't stand out in a blind taste test, but it's still a classic, and light enough to drink all night without many ill-effects. I wish you could get the bottled carbonated version of the ordinary Guinness in the states, though."
"This beer is beautiful, the taste is just brilliant, ha! The dark colored body and the smooth, never vanishing head is a delight. The smell is very sweet, sorta like chocolate and the taste is smooth and bitter, but a good bitter. This is by far one of my favorite beers of all time. Served ice cold and poured into a glass, just awesome. The after taste is also great. Cheers!"
"As far as drinkability....this one can go morning, noon and night as far as I am concerned!!"
"I really don't know what to do here. Guinness says drink out of the bottle and it is creamier that way (creamier than this version is when it's poured into a glass), but the appearance and smell are N/A. Drinking this stuff blind is actually an interesting experiment although the results aren't very good for Diageo. The best features Guinness has going for it are its beautiful pour and ridiculous quaffability, the first is lost in the bottle, and the second, well it doesn't taste as good either so I'm not too excited to be drinking it."
"This beer pours black with amber hints adn a creamy tan head. The smell is dark malts. The taste is dark malts with some bitterness. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth and overall it makes you wish you had a nice Rogue Shakespear or an Old Rasuptin instead."
"Poured in a pint glass from a bottle, the best thing about Guinness to me is the appearance and the super thick creamy head, looks are great. Now the let down this brew has limited smell of malt and maybe some coffee but it is very faint. The taste is of ""what taste", Guinness to me doesn't really have that much flavor or taste maybe a bit nutty with hints of chocolate, the creamy head makes up for somthing a bit of vannilla. This beer is a big dissapointment to me and would not buy often."
"Pours black with a creamy tan head. The head is thick and tasty really adds to the taste. No huge aroma going on here, I couldn't pull much away from this one, a hint of the usual. A very subtle taste, not as powerful as other irish stouts. A hint of chocolate and a very tiny amount of a burnt flavor. This beer has no bite and I find it is one of the only stouts does not get better as it warms up. The flavor stays consistant but the creamy texture really is lackluster under warmer temperatures. The beer is full bodied but with less flavor than you would think. Still a very drinkable beer, and great if you are in the mood for a dark creamy stout."
"Served from a can with nitro thingamabob.I'm not sure why this version of GES gets such rave reviews. This rendition of GES is truly offensive. Yes, it pours black with typical nitro, foamy head. But the taste is so thin, so metalic with utterly no toasted, coffee or carmel notes that I wondered if I was in fact drinking a Guinnes. Miller Genuine Draft has as much character. This beer is all gimmick, and no heart. I gave the remainer of the 4 pack to a neighbour. If I ever drink Guinnes again, it will be from a bottle."
"The appearance is what first sells it- the turn to black is always a cool thing to watch. It has a mild coffee smell and taste to it and the roasted malts are apparent throughout the stout. There is also a thick, creamy head and a surpisingly smooth taste. I thought that this would be a thicker beer than it turned out to be."
"D - This beer is drinkable only because it is so dumbed down for mass consumption, in my opinion. Not one of the better dry Irish stouts out there."
"Ah, Guinness. Served in a pint glass, it pours dark brown with some tinges of ruby red in there when I hold it up to the light. The head is about 3/4 inches high, creamy and tan. The aroma isn't strong, but it smells like roasted malt with a bit of coffee. It tastes pretty much the way it smells, like roasted malt, coffee and some chocolate. There's a nice slight bitter aftertaste as well. It's very creamy and smooth, and goes down pretty easy. In my opinion it's a great beer, especially because of the way it looks (the taste is good too). I don't think I've ever had a bad Guinness, of course it's always better on tap somewhere. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone."
"This beer obviously has it's positives and negatives. What it lacks in taste it makes up for in a really cool look and drinkability. Had this on tap at a bar. I saw the bartender pour it and he poured it straight down the glass creating a ton of head that slowly but surely turned to a pitch black beer in front of me. I'm not sure if that's how it's supposed to be poured. I usually see bartenders taking their time with pouring a guiness, but this one just set the glass down pulled the tap, walked away and did something else. Either way, my beer arrived and was exactly as every pint of guinness I've had before. An awesome 1/2"" white head sits atop a black body for the entire time you drink. Not much of anything in the nose and only a bit of roasted malt flavor in the taste. If I focus and let my imagination go wild, I can maybe fool myself into tasting some chocolate notes. The mouthfeel is creamy smooth, but watery in a weird way. This beer is a session beer if there ever was one."
"Drinkability: I've had something of an ongoing debate as to whether I prefer the draught or the extra stout, and the conclusion I think I've come ot is that the Extra Stout is a better beer, but I wish it had some nitro. I suppose the moral of the story is ""just get it on tap.""The sweet finish does hurt the drinkability a bit, though."
"Had this (most recently) at Buffalo Wild Wings. The beer of course looks fantastic. Guinness has a very unique (as far as I'm concerned) look. Being Pitch black with a THICK, CREAMY head that lasts forever, it is one of the most daunting (readily available) beers for people to try. Its very cool to watch the beer settle, I never take a sip, and usually don't take my eyes off of the glass till its done. It Smells bitter, can't really pick out any particulars. It tastes good. To me its a very subtly flavour. tasted a little smokey, a little bitter. My girlfriend said it tasted like Bacon... but I have no idea what she was talking about. the mouthfeel again, is very unique to me. has a flat, but still carbonated feel. I like it. its a nice change of pace from your typical beer. Its a slow drink and I can normally only take 2 or 3 before I switch to something else."
"One of my favorite beers, the classic Guinness is overall a wonderful beverage. The hints of Coffee are one of the flavors I like the most about this beverage, not to mention its opaque color and traditional white head, this beer is definitely in the upper eschelon (in my own opinion, anyway!). As far as price goes, it can get a little pricey, but you pay for what you get all too often when it comes to beer, and I'm not hurting to pay a couple of extra dollars for personal enjoyment, though I wouldn't recommend drinking too many in a sitting if you're trying to keep away a beer gut :)."
"Appearance of this beer is great, unfortunatly that is where the impressing stops. Solid, inky black color that cascades for a while after the pour. Frothy brown head that has incredible retention. The smell is average for a stout, sweet coffee and creme, with some roasted and chocolate hints. The taste and mouthfeel are very much like an iced latte or something of the sort, quite sweet and filling, but not much malty goodness in most good stouts. For how deep this beer is, it has a very light body. This is a beer to make 'average beer' drinkers feel like 'good beer' drinkers. It is not impressive after you have tried some good stouts."
"I do remember my first Guinness, how ""rough"" it was for me. Flavor was too strong, or I wasn't used to drinking a non-yellow beer, etc. This time it was a little too easy to throw back. Weak aroma, weak flavor, almost no carbonation. A stout for the masses."
"I should add that I like the bottled non-nitro regular Guinness. It is one of those beers I have a love-hate relation with. But I always warm up to it after a few days. That beer exists on its own feet. This really wants to be something else, and fails miserably."
"Still a standard."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- What begins as a watery, thin entry expands ever-so-slightly and develops a creaminess that improves the texture. Although the carbonation is downplayed in favor of smoothness, I do not miss it here. This is undoubtedly one of the finest session beers of all time, for obvious reasons."
"Had this on tap at a bar last night for the first time. I loved it. Coffee was the most recognizable taste in this beer. Overall it was very creamy and smooth going down. A friend next to me had some and said they tasted grapefruit. I wish more people drank guinness."
"Guinness Draught is something I drink when I want to sit and enjoy a beer that's pretty good but won't get me too buzzed to do stuff that needs to be done. I don't buy it that often, though, because there's planty of other stuff that's asa good or better for the money."
"Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, it absolutely fits the style intended, cheers."
"If you like stouts, this one is a great one to try and if you have not had a Guinness before, try and have one on tap. It's worth a try."
"smooth, light mouthfeel with a velvety carbonation. burnt malts then a slightly hoppy finish with grapefruit rind flavor. a barest hint of balancing sweetness. it really is better in the UK when you have it fresh, on tap. the fruity, light hoppy character is completely lost on the trip over, leaving little complexity in the american version."
""
"An alright beer, but nothing spectacular."
"As stouts go it is not my fav, but I still would recommend you have one or two."
"When I drink a Guinness, I really get the feeling that I'm sitting in a pub drinking a traditional European beer."
"Nothing great, but still enjoyable."
"This stuff is amazing. It's hard to believe this is beer! Very creamy texture, with a very unique flavor unlike any other beer i have ever had. It has a long white creamy head, and it hangs around for the entire life of the glass. This is something to try if you are into different kinds of brews. For me, this is damn good stuff! Awesome for winter time!"
"I have been drinking this more often lately. Its available much more than most other premium type beers. The bottle has a 'rocket' in it. Not sure on the concept, but it takes up space and gives me less beer. I don't like that part, but if it keeps it fresher, i'll deal w/ it. The look is nice, very dark w/ a lacy head. Not as spectacular as the Extra Stout, but still a nice presentation. The smell is nutty w/ a slight toffee scent possibly. Tastes good!"
"Avoid the bottle. The tap is still the best. The can is nearly as good. The bottle is not worth it."
"It's drinkability is average for me. I am just waiting to try one in Ireland, as I feel I will learn to appreciate it once again. For right now, a good pour of this brew is terribly hard to find."
"This has to be one of my favorite beers to enjoy on tap. For appearance (from tap) it has a nice chocolate coloration to it. Smell is very aromatic and enjoyable. (NOT really hoppy smell but mellow smell) As for taste it has a great coffee and chocolate taste to it and I find it to easier to drink around 55 degrees Farenheit. Mouthfeel well to be honest here I don't really notice any cause I down it quite fast. But drinkability slpendid very, very nice. It is a well made no well crafted beer. Enjoy!"
"Poors an opaque garnet with a frothy creamy tan head. The head on this beer keeps going like the Energizer Bunny. Aroma is mild roasted malt. Light bodied for what appears to be a heavy beer. Roasted malt flavors with a hint of coffee/toffee character. Bitterness seems to come from the roast malt, but is just the well balanced hops. Classic beer. Easy drinker. Time for 'nother!"
"Pours a deep black coffee color with a dense one finger thick tan cap. The cap lingers and settles to a quarter inch, but leaves froth behind on sides of glass. Aroma is coffee, roasted malts, and a hint of chocolate. Medium body feel that is a little more watery than creamy... the flavor follows the aroma. Nice caramel maltiness surrounded by a very pleasing hop bitterness. Light coffee flavor to give some depth. Has that good ole' ""Irish"" flavor. Great beer anyway you have it. Goes down smooth and refreshing!! Good stuff."
"Drinkability: I wonder if the higher alcohol version we can't get in the states is also more complex? If that's the case, then maybe we should indeed take a chance on trying to get some over here maybe. Still, though this is one of the most overrated and consumed stouts in the country, I will buy it once in a while to watch the magic happening on the glass, and have a stout that's easy to drink when I want a few and don't want to worry about sipping one or two all night."
"What the hell happened to guiness, I remember getting this when i was younger and it didn't taste this watered down for a stout. What the hell happened? I will give extra stout a try sometime perhaps, cause this isn't cutting it. But on the other hand guiness has the stats of a light beer with 120 calories, so I guess it would be alright for a light beer, but man."
"Notes: Well I have alsways had a thing for Guinness as it was a good starting point for me getting into trying different beers in my college days. However now it really pales flavorwise in comparison to other stouts. Still a good beer to drink at the local dives with bad selections when I'm out with my friends."
"Okay, where to start, ""serve extra cold," ""drink straight from the bottle."" Neither inspire confidence. I like some nitro stouts, so it's time to give this one a try. I've decided to drink it as suggested by the manufacturer. I can see the nitro rocket at the top of the bottle. I can't really smell anything. Tastes pretty decent by nitro standards, but I miss getting the nitro pour. Notes of coffee and licorice are present. Not too bad, I'd have another."
"By far my favorite Irish stout and probably my favorite beer. I just went to Ireland and to Dublin. Is there a better place todrink guinness. Well this is one beer that I love to drink the head. Not many beers can do that to you. The black color is just amazing when the taste comes out. I think that this beer can go with any meal but the best time to drink it is after dinner.The problem with being in the U.S. is that the cans and bottles however still good are just not able to cut the tast of true tap guinness."
"Drinkability: the model mainstream stout. I always wonder how Guinness maintains its quality despite being a multinational macro. A lovely stout no matter where you try it."
"very drinkable due to it's mild flavor and creamy body. a classic. always enjoyable."
"Taste is all bout the roasted malts. Black coffee presides, followed by a slight sweetness leftover from the hefty malts used in this brew. Extremely dry, thin and creamy in the mouth. Bitterness is Over the top, but not in a West Coast USA, AIPA way, but in a first cup of coffee in the morning kind of way. Still, this is a classic beer, and one can't really argue with tradition. And the 4.2 ABV allows one to sock a lot of these away if so inclined. A classic pub brew, and one I'm not going to argue with."
"I should note that this rating is an evaluation of Guinness when ""it's done right""."
"Poured from a nitro widget can , very impressive cascading effect is pleasing to the eye. Once the cascading has stopped and the head settled , it remains as a super thick and creamy , off-white and inpenatrable layer. Much lace was left on my pint. The color of the beer is a deep black , mostly opaque , with some ruby edges near the bottom of the glass. Roasty and creamy aromas , malt . Taste is also slightly roasty malt , very creamy mouthfeel which provides most of the character and begs for deeper sips. Slight bitterness and almost no hop flavor. Leaves a slightly bitter and dry aftertaste. A very drinkable stout , not nealy as flavorful as many other stouts though. With the creaminess and abv , its easy to put quite a few pints away in a night."
"D - high, due to its smoothness and lower ABV, you can go through 5-7 of these before you know it"
"The characterisitics are very similar to my review of this in the nitro-can, but it is a whole lot smoother and creamier. The smell isn't as strong, but still is an excellent stout on tap."
"Update: 3-17-08 Part of a St. Pat's Irish Stout-a-thon. This beer is the most commercial of the ones I had side by side, and it was the lesser of the four beers IMO."
"D: I find it very easy two drink a couple of these in one sitting. When it comes to Guinness I work by the Irish quote when someone is deciding if they should have another pint or not. ""A Man can't walk with only one leg."""
"My first Guinness was actually on draft, and I was really ready for a beer. Bad choice at the time, that Guiness. I had to wait for the head to settle and I though it was really bitter. Time passed and I got away from the BMC thing. I felt that my tastebuds had matured so I tried another Guinness, this tme in a bottle. Kind of chocolaty, coffee like and soft on the palate. After a little research, I now understood the workings of the 'widget', what makes the head, and why it's so thick. Armed with all of that intelligence I still wasn't that impressed, especially with the taste. Something is missing. The taste is kind of bland. Maybe it's the soft mouthfeel of the nitrogen as opposed to the crispness of CO2. I'm thinking the shortcoming is more on the line of ingredients. I've had some killer Russian stouts. Hercules out of Belgium is outstanding. Bell's, from Kalamazoo, Mi., offers a great selection of stouts that blows this one away. Mix Guinness with a Bass ale to make a black and tan, or a Harp for a half and half, and that's a different story. That seems to liven it up a bit. That's really to only way that I drink this anymore. Otherwise, for the money, I would pass on a straight up Guinness if other stouts were available."
"I haven't had one of these is several years. I'm glad I didn't pay for this. Boy are people ridiculous when they say how ""meal-like," heavy and filling this beer is. I am quite convinced that people buy this due to how it is marketed, not due to how it tastes."
"Opinion: Well, I just keep trying this beer, as I want to see what difference it makes between the different packaging techniques. I don't think that it makes much difference. This is a pretty good session beer, and I can't hardly imagine being able to drink enough to get drunk on these. I'll stick with their export."
"I tried to brew my own guiness and though I did obtain a decent flavour I could not imitate the perfect head this beer posess. All those that believe that guiness is over-rated will disagree but I think this a very good beer."
"This is a somewhat close approximation of Guinnes on tap, but it doesn't quite measure up. It is pretty in the glass, although the bubbles and head recede more quickly than on tap. The major difference is the thin moutfeel. It isn't as creamy and delcicious as it is on tap. Everything else--the roasty coffee taste and good drinkability--is about the same."
"Mouthfeel: I feel like the bottle is always a little more watery than I would care for. It is lighter and not quite as creamy. Yet still has a comfortable body and still enjoyable. All in all I still think it really a decent beer even out of the bottle."
"A dark brown black beer. Has a creamy (nitro type) dark beige head with a good lace. A lot of chocolate at first (milk chocolate) in the aroma followed by some hints of toffee and a coffee bitterness in the background. The first sip give a chocolate note. The second leaves more dark roasted malt bitterness (with a hint of burnt toast on the back of the tongue). The mouthfeel seemed a bit watery to me."
"This is the only beer so far that I've reviewed twice, simply because there are so many ways to get a Guinness around here. Can't say that for most beers in Canada."
"It's pretty odd when the head is the best part of a brew, by quite a ways. This never got off the ground, even when I tried pouring it at different temperatures. Between the ""served chilled"" suggestion (I always thought Guinness should be served around 50-55 degress fahrenheit and the edges of the beer being a deep reddish instead of a uniform black, I think they dropped the ball on this. Is it true that not all Guinness is brewed at Saint James Gate, but also in Canada? My next serving of this will be on tap - brilliant!"
"Stick with the Extra Stout."
"Served from a nitro can into a Guinness pint glass that I purchased at the Guinness brewery a few years. What a nice St. Patrick's Day treat. The beer pours a nice black color with active bubbling activity from the nitro in the can. Interesting to watch as it settles. After the beer settles with a nice thick tan head, the aroma I get is of some nice toasted malts with a bit of sweetness. The taste is a nice lingering tongue of sweet toasted malts that is very drinkable, despite the slightly heavy body."
"I could drink these all night on tap but for some reason I refuse to buy at the store in bottles and cans."
"I always find myself ordering this beer at the bar. For a good session, I can't think of anything better. Pours blacker than a Saharan night during an eclipse. Nitro bubbles rise and fall in a hypnotizing dance that invites a sip. Head is a thick, dense, and tan. Smells like toasty malt, hops are nowhere in the nose. Once in the mouth it loses some of its luster. It has that toasty, dry malt I love, but it is just plain watery compared to other offerings. Drinkability? I can drink Guinness until I blackout. Low ABV and the watered down taste makes it slip down as easy as taking a breath. I consider this the finest ""macro"" brew, and turn to it whenever the goal is tying one on."
"[note: drank a second bottle ""extra cold", which is suggested on the bottle, and it helped the drinkability slightly. Still tasted awful.]"
"Drinkability is fantastic. I could go all night with this beer and have on occasion. Not heavy or overly alcoholic but very smooth and tasty."
"So, if on no other occassion, celebrating the day of the Irish is a great to sample an authentic Irish stout you can get just about anywhere; because we all know, Killian's Irish Red is not from Ireland. Slainte!"
"beer is very drinkable but i know it can be better, i have had guiness from ireland and this just does not match up imo."
"Had a draft Guinness on St. Patrick's Day. Nice creamy head that stayed for the whole drink. Good lacing on the glass. Nice dark (black) color. Some roasted malt smell. Taste was ok, malt taste...goes down smooth . Mouthfeel is a little thin, was expecting more richness. No bitterness or weird aftertaste. This is not an exceptional beer, but it is smooth and easy to drink. This is a good session beer."
"Classic black color with that fun to watch carbonation cascade and the nitro head that lasts the whole drink. Taste is not going to overwhelm most anyone and it's lighter than appearances suggest. Very easy to drink steadily (session beer?) and my tasting is based on hanging with a group at a pool hall last night. Very nice to quaff in a slightly smokey atmosphere."
"D - Decent. I prefer this to the extra stout, although maybe it's the nitro and not the beer. Gimmick or not, the nitro-head is a goodthing."
"Drinkability is also rather high. Guinness just begs to be consumed in two or three pints at a time. Beyond the bitterness, it's smooth, rich and just complex enough to be rewarding (but not too rewarding). American macros could really take a lesson from Guinnes Draught. And while its far superior on tap (but only especially so in the 'taste' department), I would never turn it down from a can - and in fact, I'll probably eventually buy more next year, when I still haven't found a bartender's who's mastered the Guinness 'perfect pour.'"
"The mouth is incredibly smoothe but a little water. All the essences from the nose are present in the taste. The finish is medium but builds up over time. While it isn't a very strong stout I can always do a session of these. Since it is so widely available it is one of my fall back beers when other hard to finds aren't around."
"remarkable but still a good beer."
"D - Highly drinkable. The beer is easy to session, although the charred flavor gets old quickly. It is easy to wash down food as well. All and all, a bland irish dry with a bit too much burnt character for my tastes."
"I dont plan to buy Guinness in stores any time in the near future."
"I personally enjoy drinking this one from the bottle. I believe the rocket widget for the bottles was a great idea. I'll be for sure picking these up on St Patrick's Day."
"wow. This beer really has changed since the last time I had it. The appearance was certainly nice, good head retention. I cant say too much about smell as my nose is a bit plugged, but it doesnt have anything worth noting. The taste is what dissapointed me most. I remember Guinness having a nice, strong dark taste, but now it just tastes like water. too smooth on the mouthfeel part, as many have said. Yeah you can drink it easily, but not for enjoyment."
"I won't be shelling out cash for this one anytime soon."
"Yeah, drink a bunch. It's really weak and watery. Just sad."
"I had this at a restaurant this evening. When I originally tried this beer, the roof of my mouth was burned because of hot cheese, so perhaps just the coolness of the beer made me say it was so tasty. I'm not saying I don't like this beer, all I'm saying is that maybe that contributed to my previously high rating. I don't have anything else to add aside from the fact that this is a strong strong beer. Still very enjoyable, sipping, full flavored beer."
"Overall, what can I say? I love Guinness when it's fresh, high-quality and poured correctly. I don't like it when it's none of those things, and that's what this can represents. Bleh. Tir na Nog, I miss you."
"Guinness Draught to me is one of the most mediocre stouts out there but here goes. Pours thick brown which slowly develops into a dark black. Smell has coffee and chocolate notes. The taste is very watery and milky. Doesn't have very much flavor at all....the coffee is there but it's not as pronounced as in some stouts. Overall is just a very average beer."
"Check that, I'll veritably pound ONE, then sit, sip and enjoy a couple more in the company of friends."
"A good session beer that you can easily knock back several in one sitting without getting shnockered."
"D: Extremely easy to drink due to the mouthfeel, but the taste and aroma are a little lacking for me to enjoy this unless I'm in the right mood (i.e. St. Patty's day)"
"My office bought a 6-pack last Friday; this and Heineken were our import choices. Happy with what I chose... :)"
"Drinkable enough, just lacks the depth of the export, other in-country competetitors or numerous clones inspired by the ""original"""
"More filling than the stout, i believe. But it is the perfect beer. So dark light can not pass through, a almost pure white head (not a pimple). The problem is you have to let it settle to get the full taste. so be in a hurry of you want to drink it. Perfect beer to have with cheese and a burger, but not if you want hot wings or a salad!"
"Not the Guinness I remember."
"I poured this beer out of an 11.2 oz nitro rocket-widget bottle into a Guinness pint glass. I feel like I really get cheated with only 11.2 ounces, the beer only comes up to the label on the pint glass. It has that beautiful Guinness cascade and the lovely thick nitro tan head that is a rock solid 1 thick. The beer itself appears black as night but is actually very, very, very dark brown. The modern nitro Guinness in a can and bottle to me has very little smell. What smell there is a light hoppy dry smell that smells like brown paper. When I first started drinking Guinness in the standard bottles many years ago, it had a yeasty sludge in the bottom of the bottle and appeared to be bottle fermented and carbonated  a completely different drink. However, this is a classic as well. The mouthfeel is smooth and amazingly light for a stout. The taste starts with a sharp bite of carbonized grain, to a dry almost ethereal warmth, and end with a dry aftertaste. A bit of a very light chocolate overtone in the flavor and a bit smokey as well. Nothing quite like a Guinness. This is a very drinkable stout, although I couldnt slam as many Guinnesses as say Sweetwater 420 or other lighter beers."
"Not bad but I still prefer the nitro-bottled version."
"Cheers!"
"This beer came a dark brown that let a lot of light through giving it some burgundy highlights. The head was a lovely pale tan that was flat and creamy. Smells of delightfully toasted malts with a distinctive sweet and sourness behind it that I can only say smells like Guinness. Tastes initially of a cocktail of dry roasted malts that springs to life with a pleasantly subdued sweetness, and then finishes dry with a coffee and cream and a gentle nip of hops. The mouth feel is a silky thin to medium body and flat. The real kicker here is the little bit of head that makes its way into my mouth on each sip that simply floats along my palate. Thats invigorating and down right enjoyable! Whats not to love?"
"cheers..."
"The pint is topped with a perfect 1/2 inch cap of dense miniscule stone bubbles that looks more like a dollop of cream. This one needed some time to warm up as it arrived at a standard bar draft temperature, which was far too cold. During the entire pint, the head never diminished at all, and there was plenty left once the beer was gone, even after painting the inside of the glass with lacing. Deep dark, almost black, with ruby highlights. The smell is of faint roasted malts and little else. The taste is slightly bitter up front with deep roasted malt, almost charcoal like, in the finish. There was something almost sour about it. Light body and a generally smooth mouthfeel, it is also a bit drying. It is drinkable, and in the states it is becoming about the only nitro stout readily available in Irish-themed bars."
"One of my favorites."
"D- This beer is not the dark roasted bitter ale that I hoped for. It is a bit thin and light with not a lot of depth. The aroma was faint but nice and then the taste was just to watered down."
"As anyone who sees my moniker can tell, I have a taste for the guiness..Very velvety mouthfeel, with hints of chocolate and roasted nut.Dry aftertaste. Had it in true draught form, and cant drink it in a can or bottle, also if sampling in a ber, make sure that the bar uses the guinness a lot, because if it sits in the lines at a bar that doesnt serve much guinness, it gets very bitter. I always ask the waitress/bartender how much the guinness is served(and i get my fair share of weird looks for it)."
"Drinkability - Was very tiresome after 2 beers. Bitterness starts to linger afterwhile. Buying one occasionally shouldn't be so bad, but the bitter after-taste makes this a poorer beer, imo."
"Guinness is a good beer, but alas it's not even my favorite Irish Stout. Usually after one pint I'm ready to move on to another beer. Wish I could have sampled it way back in the day before the realities of marketing and brewery consolidation set in."
"Other thoughts on this beer: definitely a good beer. I respect this beer for being supposedly starting the 'stout' style. I must say if you are not into microbreweries and trying new things instead of settling with a 'best' this beer seems to be the top of the chain for people. It's quite sad and silly. I have a friend who's irish, has red hair, and wears all sorts of celtic stuff and Flogging Molly shirts. He doesn't like other porters and always compares them to 'the best.' To me it's a beer you ought to try even have once in a while but to say it's The Best is a little over the top. I will say though that I have not yet enjoyed it off the tap. I have been told that this is the ONLY way to drink it. After then I can feel not full of myself. I bet it is better though. P.S. it is great though if you want to feel full after drinking a beer. I hear over in Ireland it's not uncommon to drink one of these for breakfast with all the grains and carbs."
"Overall - the classic dry stout. If you haven't ever had it on draft, you can't call yourself a beer aficionado."
"For me Guinness is a drinking beer. I can have vast quanities of it and never get tired of the taste. Its not a very flavorful beer, and thats what I like about it. It has a slightly roasted coffee taste that I can enjoy all the time. If I'm only going to have a few beers, this is not the beer for me. If I'm going out all day and night, can't go wrong with a good pint."
"Love Guinness. The appearance is dark brown/almost black with a creamy head that lasts. Excellent lacing. The smell is of malt, chocolate, and a slight bit of coffee. The taste is a little sweet, with an aftertaste of coffee, or even a slight, slight black licorice. Mouthfeel is very smooth. Hardly any carbonation. Goes down smooth which is what makes it great. I could drink these all night. One of my favs."
"The flavor was bitter and chocolaty though i didnt find many other flavors. It feells thick and creamy in the mouth. Overall I found this to be a quite good though heavy beer."
"d - This beer has always worked for me. I could drink a lot of them. It's not spectacular, is particularily weak in mouthfeel but I keep buying it and drinking it. It goes down easy. Also, if you are going to drink with friends who ""aren't into that conosuier s**t"" Guiness enjoys wide acceptance and is far more drinkable than yellow fizz."
"Once again, I believe it's time to review this beer once again. Once again, as always it pours to a beautiful dark opaque color. The head is thick, creamy and just does not subside. The smell hints at chocolate and coffee, as does the taste of the beer. The beer itself is nice and thick and it's really easy to drink down. If anything this beer is consistently good. Will buy again, of course."
"Pours a black body as the bubbles ascend beautifully to make a elegant creamy head. The aroma is dark roasted malts with chocolate and coffee. The taste and mouthfeel are good, maybe a bit on the watery side. The drinkablility is good as also good as I can easily throw back a few of these at a time."
"This is a drinkable beer but not great taste-wise. The head was amazingly resilient. It may have stood up through the dishwasher for all I know."
"Maybe I blew it. I can't bring myself to drink from the bottle. I didn't even read the friggin' label. So, I stupidly poured it into a glass. Inky purple black, with an off-white foam. Smell is roasty and a little chocolatey. The taste, and maybe I ruined it with the poor, was dominated by a ubiquitous metallic flavor. Thin, thin, thin mouthfeel. Some bitterness in the finish, but not enough to save it. Not appealing."
"Poured from a nitro tap, the legendary Guinness head formed as the falling tan foam settled. The head is extraordinarily thick and creamy in appearance, texture, and taste. I had to push through the head to get to the black richness beneath and found the familiar roasted goodness. At 4.2%, it is easy to drink. One would expect a heavier beer, given the color, but this is one great sessioner. Aroma was clean and slightly toasty. The Guinness Draught is simple and good, much lighter in flavor than other stouts. I don't know if it's comparatively light stout flavor complemented the oysters or if they oysters would have paired better with a richer, roastier, stout-ier stout. I do know that I could have easily had another couple of these with a couple dozen oysters had I had the time to do it."
"There's nothing quite like watching bubbles cascading in your glass and forming a thick, luscious creamy head on top of your brew. Go nitro widget go! Deep opaque black hue which fades to a slightly translucent cola color at the bottom of my glass. Head retains quite well, leaving rings of tanned cream down the walls of my imperial pint. Aroma is rather faint, save for a few subtlties, light roasted marshmallows, hint of chocolate and burnt coffee. Sour bitter flavor with light coffee, chocolate, roasty malts, tobacco. Rich and creamy on the palate with a clean, dry finish. One of the true gateway ales out there and a good one. Easy to drink, looks great and a killer mouthfeel, aroma and taste leave some to be desired. However, all things considered, this is my lite beer of choice at only 155 calories per 14.9oz can."
"D: maybe the style is not my favourite and it also has to be taken into account that the can-version is not as nice as the real draught version on tap, but I've come across lots of much better and complex stouts than this giant. Got to do better to live up to its reputation and self-expectation."
"However, I would not recommend this in a can and if you have the money to buy Guinness I would say go the extra mile for the Extra Stought, as it is worth it. But since it's very rare, Draught is a very good substitute."
"I never would have assumed Guinness would appeal to me. Like I've said before, I have pretty moderate tastes. Mostly my beer preferences run to the moderate. Red/Amber Lagers and more recently, ""white"" (wheat) beers. I'm not generally into the really heavy, dark, bitter beers. So Guinness is was a pleasant surprise. Now first, let me say this is the single most appealing beverage I've ever seen. A lot of people use the comparisons to say motor oil to describe the appearance. I never understood that. From the very first time I saw Guinness, my first response was ""whoa, nothing could possibly taste as good as that looks"". For that matter, since I was watching TV, I thought nothing could look that appealing in person (not true as it turned out). Anyway, the smell is distinctive- carmalized malts and coffee. The taste is surpisingly pleasant. Rich, with some sweetness, and an uncanny similarity to strong coffee. Yes, it is quite bitter (which I usually don't enjoy), but the way the bitterness comes out makes it less objectionable. The bitterness is in the middle rather than the finish, and does not linger. I assume this is because the bitterness comes from the very dark malts rather than the hops. The mouthfeel is, like Guinness (or really like stout I guess) in general, unique but enjoyable. It is rich and thick, creamy even. The head is especially pleasant and creamy. Guinness is actually more drinkable than it seems, it goes down pretty well and even washes food down pretty well. But for some reason I find the taste and experience of this particular beer gets really old if I have more than one or two. So the drinkability is what I'd call mediocre. To me at least, Guinness is distinctively different, but quite pleasant. I don't really drink it often, and I definately don't rate this a good session beer, but its still very good and one or two of them every now and then hits a spot that nothing else I've yet had will."
"Always the Guinness. I will always love this beer. Not always above all others, but above most. It is the classic beer for guys. It has one of the best heads on it and is known around the world for its taste and ability to heal stuff (not really sure about that). It has a dark complexion, as you know, but the taste must be experience. It has amber undertones and yet mild aftertaste. Not that anyone cares, but it actually has fewer calories than a regular beer."
"Overall: The light taste and body really make this an excellent session beer. Classic beer, really one to go to school on. Not surprised it is one of the most often reviewed beers."
"Creamy smooth, very drinkable."
"At one time, this was my favorite beer in the world. In fact, I started homebrewing so that I could make something similar that wouldn't cost me a fortune. I'm not quite as into it as I used to be, but it's something that I'll return to from time-to-time. There may be better stouts out there, but this one's still a classic in my book. Also tends to be widely available, even at places with limited beer menus."
"Drinkability/Overall: Personally I like them a bit stronger and this brew tastes like Guinness Extra Stout but with more water. For people who dont like it as strong this is a good pick but the extra stout is more like a meal than this. This is way too watery to live up to its big boy raps."
"Overall drinkability is okay. A bit too dry on the finish to be a favorite of mine, and there are certainly better stouts out there, but to be as available as it is pretty much everywhere, it's not bad."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, a bit oily, not much carbonation. Overall a great beer and one of my favorite stouts."
"Its drinkability is lessened by the watery qualities but I have sacrificed too many brain cells over the years to Guinness Draught not to keep this on my drink list"
"Looks amazing, everything else is average, not bad or good. I know there's the campaign to drink it warmer, but I think only bad notes (a noticeable sour taste) emerge as it warms... I'll keep it cold. I don't really crave another, but except for the price (usually between moderately high to high) this is pretty sessionable with the light body, low ABV, and accessible taste."
"Pours very dark ruby, near opaque with lots of translucent highlights. Very creamy tan head; thin and tight and produces unreal retention but leaves only modest lacing. The smell is sweet in a milk stout sort of way, with roasted barley and english hop aromas becoming more apparent as it warms. The taste is bitter from the roasted malt, and black patent lends a smokey sour taste. A dry hop aftertaste becomes pronounced in the finish, but the drinkability remains high due to the light body and nitrogenration that create a creamy mouthfeel. The levels of specialty malt, burnt flavor and dry hops seem too bitter, and distrub the balance rather than compliment eachother. Otherwise a well-done session stout."
"This beer pours a very dark brown, almost black, and forms a light beige head about one finger high. Smell is unremarkable and a little sweet, with some light chocolate and malt. The taste wasn't very strong at all, but wasn't unpleasant. Again some light chocolate and malts, but very underwhelming for a stout. Very smooth mouthfeel, and extremely drinkable. Not bad, but not exceptional either."
"This is a beer you can drink all night because if its mild flavor and relatively low alcohol content and it beats the crap out of standard cheap American lagers."
"drinkability: extremely drinkable"
"The mouthfeel is too thin, almost watery. This makes for good drinkability, but unfortunately, one is good enough for me. I used to think this stuff was good until I tried other stout offerings."
"Overall: I think this beer hits its mark if the mark is to be easy to drink and drink and drink. The lack of complexity in the taste and thin moutfeel make you forget you're drinking a stout at all - which isn't necessarily a bad thing."
"Drinkability: I suppose it would do all right as a session beer. The lack of flavour and creamy mouthfeel make it go down easily, (I had 2 pints tonight and wanted more) but I'd far prefer the Extra Stout to this stuff, even for long sessions. Why doesn't Guinness put the Extra Stout in kegs?"
"Surprisingly light for a stout, this beer pours down fairly easily. The only drawback for drinkability is that (like alot of stouts) it suffers a bit from the burnt finish and aftertaste. None the less, this is a pretty standard middle of the road stout."
"Drinkability - To a beginner beer drinker, this may seem way too heavy. It is heavy, but what's a beer without feeling like you ate a meal after it?"
"Low ABV makes Guinness very drinkable. Almost too drinkable."
"How can you go wrong with this beer. Dark coffee with the carbonation cascading through the drink. Truley one of the best visuals of a beer. Chocolate roasted malt,toasty, smooth, creamy, full of rich flavor, hops are present, but not overpowering. Proud to be half irish."
"I know that this beer bottle was designed to drink the beer from the bottle and I have done so, but this time I poured it into a glass. I just have to see my Guinness to enjoy it more. First, the pour is one of the best with the cascading nitro effect. The head is a beautiful finger high creamy off-white and the lacing is great also. Aromas of caramel coffee, roasted malts, and white bread. Taste is not as flavorful as the aromas lead on, but there is still plenty of roasted malt flavor, but it tastes a little watery. Mouthfeel is thin for a stout, but Guinness usually has that quality and I sort of like that. Low alcohol content and not as filling as one may expect which would make this an easy session beer."
"Good beer but better options for the style. Solid but not impressive."
"A dark brown color with a tan-colored head that has excellent retention and body. Smells of roasted barley. The taste is smooth and creamy with a dry finish that amplifies over time. Maybe it's just that I've had a number of Double Stouts and Milk/Sweet Stouts so to me, this beer seems rather bland. I know it's a good representation of the style, but it's just seems like something is missing. The texture of the beer, the richness of the beer seems to imply something else could be added, just don't ask me what that something is. Overall, this is a good beer that can be had several times, but I do think that it is a bit bland and can have additional complexity and flavors."
"D = Better stouts to drink."
"Please note this score seems much to high to me, but then again I think feel is much more important than appearance. If it is good in the mouth who cares what it looks like?"
"Drinkibility: Very easy to drink. I'm a fan, and I'd drink it again. interested to try it on tap."
"Meal in a can is what a lot of folks say about it, but I think I'd prefer actual food. The appearence is a beautiful dark mahogany, with a manila cream top. The head is good sized, but after taking a sip, I realize that this is because this where so much of the carbonation ends up. Since it's so flat, this coffee-chocolate brew would probably be better off served on ice as a mocha latte!"
"The quintessential Irish stout, Guinness Draught uses roasted, non-malted barley to create an easy-drinking, dry quality not found in many stouts. Combined with just the right amount of hops, the end result is a superbly smooth beer with a silky mouthfeel, notes of chocolate and coffee, and a gorgeous, tightly laced head that endures until the last sip. Truly a sublime experience!"
"I first had Guinness in the nitro-bottle and wasn't a real fan. I then decided to give the nitro-cans a try. Wow! If you have a choice between the two, get the can! It's like an entire different beer. Pours with a nice 1/2"" head that hangs around for most of the glass. The smell is pleasant but not very strong. the taste is full bodied with a strong dark roasted coffee aftertaste. This is a very drinkable pint. I downed mine before I knew what happened."
"Can't see the beer through the bottle. Where is the ""Sound"" Category? I would definintely give the clinking of the plastic thing in the bottle a 4.5. Doesn't smell like anything. Taste? No not really. A bit of muted sweetness and some cocoa. The mouthfeel is watery and flaccid. This is terrible."
"Overall a good beer, but the aftertaste reminds me of cigarettes and vomit, doesnt make me want another."
"Notes: solid brew, very drinkable, can't go wrong with this one"
"The guinness brewery put its flagship brand always on front of innovation, with this nitro can of a pint literally hit a ball of vanguard, its appearance, smell, and taste make feel like was in a irish pub widely recommendable, guinness is new brewer in my country, but start good and mantain its quality control is superior."
"a great disappontment, just flat and boring."
"Drinkability: a very drinkable stout; great for the stout category."
"If I'm going to have Guinness, I'll get cans or from a tap. Plus, the cans are 1 pint instead of a mere 12 ounces."
"I think this beer is the Budweiser of the Irish dry stout world. It's entirely overrated by the Irish wannabe crowd (that's right I said it!). The truth is there are better Irish stouts out there and drinking nothing but Guinness is like drinking nothing but Budweiser. I drank this in both nitro bottle and nitro can and for some reason the bottle version is more flavourful while the can has a thicker mouthfeel (though this beer never has very much body). Some of the flavors aside from the typical roasted barley and coffee are nothing and sour beer. That's right! I said it! I taste sourness! That's weird, I'm used to bitterness, but never sourness. Almost like they put old beer in the mix with new beer. I actually have heard that this was true of the brewing process, but I can't be sure. Whatever the case, this sour note can detract from my enjoyment of the beverage, depending on my mood of course. Mediocre with the occasion for disapointment."
"Drinkabliity: This is a good beer than can be found everywhere and would make a very good choice if the only thing around is macros."
"This beer pours dark black. It is one of the most interesting beers I've ever come in contact with. The bubbles go down instead of up! It smells of coffee. It is one of the smoothest beers I've ever drank. They go down very easily. I would recommend this beer to a friend. It is a little weak for a stout. All said, it is a great beer I enjoy often."
"Drinkability: Very smooth, and easy to drink due to the lack of carbonation you'd find in other beers."
"Certainly not a regular thing, but there's times when a Guinness is just the thing, especially as the first brew of a session."
"Tastes like Guinness, but not near as flavorfull as it is on tap or even from a nitro can. Not only are the flavors muted, but the mouth really suffers. I don't see any point in this packaging."
"Not bad. The insane creaminess saves this one. This pours a beautifaul rich brown then black with a nice creamy tan head. The aroma is of malts and coffee. The taste is of roasted malts and again coffee hints. The mouthfeel is so smooth and creamy. This has always been very drinkable for me. Not as good as the extra stout though."
"Ahh, Guinness.. Poured a deep ruby red, so dark it looks brown at first glance.. I love the small, persistant tan head from the nitrogenation... I personally find Guinness to be one of the most visually attractive beers that I have had. As for smell, it seemed somewhat caramel and chocolatey to me, and a bit of roasted malt.. Very good smell... Taste is a little bitter, somewhat coffee-like, but fairly balanced.. As for mouthfeel, its very smooth and creamy to me.. mmm.. Guinness is quite drinkable, though it tends to fill me up rather quickly... I wouldn't generally drink more than one or two in a sitting. However, the Guinness sold here doesn't compete with Ireland, I know this from experience.."
"It's almost worth the trip to Ireland to discover why the Irish are crazy about this brew. I don't think I'll ever be able to drink again the imitation Guinness we get in cans and bottles here in the states."
"Unless I mix Guiness as a black and tan, I'm not going to pay money for it however if It was close to being free I may. To much acidic taste and the bland resin hops along with the astringent finish is not my type of Stout."
"This goes down easy if you have a palate that requires a highly bland, inoffensive dark ale. I believe I saw a thread here a year or so ago from the Bros. as to how this beer had been recently noticeably dumbed down. It certainly seems that way to me. I've had too many good stouts to be able to drink this with any relish, regardless of how I once enjoyed it. Thomas Wolf was right - you can never go home again."
"Satisfying beer overall! A good overall introductory stout."
"I do love pouring nitro beers you have to enjoy watching that cascading in action. This beer pours deep black with a light tan head. Smell dosnt reveal anything. The retention on the head is ridiculous though ,it would sit there for days. A smooth mouthfeel paired with some biterness. Nothing spectacular but i wont snub my nose at it. I still buy this beer when im in a pinch. After all it is a tasty classic."
"Good tending to average..."
"Drinkability: I used to think of this as THE beer of beers. But now that Ive expanded my beer horizons, Ive been a little disappointed by this beer. I guess I just keep drinking it thinking its going to be as big and full as it looks. But as far as stouts go, its rather weak. But highly sessionable, and a true classic. Almost in a class of its own. I think if any beer is going to call itself the King of Beers, it should be Guinness (not that US macro swill) due to its age and worldwide popularity. One of the best looking beers though. I love how when I'm done with a pint I have to tip the glass back to get the last of that thick, creamy, tenacious head."
"Guinness draught from the bottle isn't that impressive from the outside can't see the beer at all. The smell is not there at all smells like water. Once you take a drink that's where the taste comes in. Drinking from the bottle is not as good as from the Tap but it loses some of it's creaminess. But other than that a pretty good beer."
"Fairly drinkable, but on the whole, I'm no longer impressed with this Guinness. Not giving up hope, though."
"Have a draft, and a song. You'll thank me (and everyone before you) later."
"Note: according to the bottles, the Extra Stout was brewed in Canada, but the Draught imported directly from Ireland."
"Ok, I'm in the minority here. I just don' t think this beer is that great. To me it has a very light,almost watered down taste. The color and head are good. The smell is creamy,but nothing great. I had a Southern Tier Porter and liked it much better."
"Guinness is one of the most unique beers I have tasted. Even with its fame around the world as the leading Dry Irish Stout the Guinness Brewery continues to make a quality product. The nitro-bottle can be drunken straight form the bottle or poured into a pint glass (or smaller, the bottle holds 11.2 fl. oz, 0.8 oz must be used for the ""rocket-widget""). The famed surge settles quicker from the bottle than form a nitro-forced tap, but it still flows into a tan creamy head. The smell is a bit on the sour side due to their souring technique, and few hops are detectable; just enough to balance out malt sweetness. The taste is something I have only found in a Guinness. The sour taste on top of the dry and roasted malt characteristics make this a complex beer whose flavors compliment each other. The mouth feel is smooth but not overly heavy; a common misconception due to Guinness's deep ruby color. This beer is very drinkable and does not leave a bloated or full feeling. A true winner for the average beer drinker looking for something other than Coors, Miller, or Bud; or for homebrewers looking for a good case at the beer distributor."
"Pours a dark brown with that famous Guinness nitrogen-fueled head of fine, dark tan, small bubbles that lingers and lingers. Best head on a beer Ive personally encountered. Smell is pleasingly mild, with hints of charred barley. Taste is slightly bitter, with something of a coffee flavor. Smooth and very watery mouthfeel. Mild, coffee/bitter aftertaste. Very drinkable. This would be a good beer to enjoy all night on tap, but in bottles at $8.50 per sixer, its of dubious value. (Note: drink them out of the bottle. Poured, they sometimes taste flat.)"
"At first pour, it poured the patented Guinness black, and poured properly gave a thick, smooth, 1 1/2"" head that lasted all the way through (characteristic of any true Diageo brew). The aroma was pleasant, and full of chocolate notes, along with a fluffy taste and full body. Evenly thick throughout, and finishes very nicely in all manners. Virtually no aftertaste, which left me yearning for another, and another, and another (as long as you can stomach the weight)."
"Poured jet black with an off-white creamy head that lasted for the entire pint. Helps the appearance but can't help the smell which is mostly neutral, some faint grainy malts, maybe some metallic notes, that's about it. Taste is rather neutral as well. Quite watery with some grainy/oatmeal malts. Slightly sweet, but not to any interesting degree. Mouthfeel is excedingly thin and watery. I could drink it forever, but I really don't have a desire to as the palate was right up there with the Shiner Bock I had last night, which is certainly not saying much. May be the #1 selling stout in the world but there are countless better options if you give it any serious look at all."
"I'm not a Guinness disciple but I do enjoy it at times. However, one is usually enough for me and it is hard for me to have another one because of how much it fills me up."
"Poured a nice dark ebony brown. The head was bright white not as tan as I would have thought. The aroma was weaker than expected with notes of roasted barley. Burnt grain leads off the taste joined by carmel sweetness and balanced with bitter chocolate. Hop notes are faint. This is an instatution everyone should try a pint. They say the closer you get to Dublin, the sweeter the Guinness. I hope to find out some day."
"This is so different to bottled Guinness."
"Filtered coffee appearance. Pours with a creamy white head. Rather subtle burnt grain and chocolate aromas follow through on a very smooth and creamy, medium-bodied palate gentle burnt grain and subtle bitter hop notes on the finish. (It does actually taste creamier when drunk straight from the bottle as the makers intend)"
"Mouthfeel was OK. Much more drinkable than the standard macro fare available, and although it wasn't exactly what I wanted or expected, it was acceptable."
"Will have this one instead of most of my Mexican macros, but not instead of my handful micros."
"Saying that, drinkability is not to bad but dont expect to down 8 of these in a session, nice for a cold day during winter. If you want something better of the style, try beamish instead, more flavor, less price, better overall package"
"Boo."
"This stuff has defintely been hit by way to much commercialism. The smeel is of malt, slight hops and probably its the inside of the keg I'm smelling. the taste is of burnt malt, and grain. not even good grain just,dirt. the hops Is long gone, taken over by the scent of cardboard. Forget about the aftertaste. There is a bitter aftertaste that is from the hops but its more like a carpet."
"In my opinion, this is the best beer you can get at many super markets as far as stouts go for sure. You can't go wrong with this beer. Wonderful. Just excellent."
"Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat!"
"I've had this beer an endless number of times. It was one of my stables before I started drinking craft beer. Its color is an opaque black with a light tan head. It has a faint roasted aroma, with an even fainter chocolate smell. The taste is of roasted malt with a faint chocolate aftertaste. The mouthfell is very creamy from the nitro-tap. Overall, this is a drinkable beer great for sessions."
"Drinkability - Very easy to consume with an overall impression of, ""Yes, pull me another."""
"Drinkability: Goes down easy enough. Great for Irish Car Bombs."
"Poured well, this is a fine beer. I recommend it for anyone who is looking to try ""better beer"" in this category. There certainly are more adventurous stouts, but this is a good start."
"I carried in several of these on a backpacking trip in the rugged South Cumberland plateau region of TN. I find that nitro cans are the best option for beer in the backcountry. They're lightweight, and because the carbonation won't activate until opened, you won't generate ticking timebombs from constant movement on the trail. Unfortunately this was my only nitro-can option at my local grocery store. Oh well, I guess it could be worse. It poured an almost opaque black with the signature nitro cascading effect which leaves a creamy, albeit thin, beige head. Roasted barley is the only significant flavor and it is not particularly deep and palate coating. Overall the brew is pretty thin, even for a low alc, stout. However this gives it high marks in drinkability and I'd choose this over many domestic adjunct lagers on a hot summer day. It was very satisfying after several miles on the trail."
"Poured into the glass from the nitro tap. Gloriously beautiful beer. Thick white head atop that dark, dark, dark ruby red body. Smell is of burnt coffee, light hops and sour malt. Taste is dominated by the sour malt, with coffee sticking on your tongue after you swallow, drying your mouth out in the aftermath. I like the beer, a great deal of my friends who are into craft beer were introduced to it by this Irish giant. Personally I think the best part of the beer is how beautiful it is from the tap."
"D&N: I had this one only because it was a nitro bottle. I got a fairly decent beer out of it. Nothing to go nuts over, but a nice stout on a cold spring day."
"Served from the can, this pours an almost black, with just a hint of red, and a nice everlasting beige head. Not much of a smell at all---just a little faint roated malt. Taste too is light, with roasted malts, some coffee flavors, and a faint bitter finish. The beer is extremely smooth and creamy---unfortunately its very thin for a stout and just not satisfying enough. This might be one of the best of the ubiquitous brews, but there are such better stouts that I can't see myself wasting any more money on bringing this home."
"An old, familiar staple. After drinking scores of pints of this stuff, I am finally getting around to typing up a review. I always liked the way it looks after poured from a nitro-tap. Pitch black with a nice thick and foamy head. Never goes away. The smell is like peat. Decent enough, but it smells like death. The taste is all malts, burnt chocolate and dirt. Hops are there, but almost forgotten. The mouthfeel is very full and with an incredibly dry finish. One of those beers you can drink all night and make a session out of it."
"In a nutshell: Good head, great retention. Flavor was somewhat bitter and mouthfeel was a little watery. Then again, this was right after a Black Boss porter. I had another Guinness a few days later, and on it's own, it fared MUCH better. This is the third time I've had this beer and it's growing on me...Maybe I'll try the Extra Stout next since boxing is on tonight."
"Well I sure like the way this beer looks, but I couldn't really taste anything special about it. I liked the smooth feel of it, but it went down without my really getting to enjoy it very much. I prefer a stout that has a more defined roasted coffee type of flavor. I found Guinness pretty easy to drink, but there's nothing about it that would make me buy a whole lot of it."
"While this isn't Guinness on tap, it is the next best thing. If you can't go to a pub for a few pints, then belly up to a few cans of this. It pours nice, thick and malty with a killer head. The head sticks around for a while, as it should. In fact, it is rare that I don't finish the glass before the head disappears. It has the nice dark color, with the beautiful tan head that I've come to love. Smells sweet, very distinctive. Taste is incredible, a nice malty, nutty taste. Tastes the same from beginning to end. Not overpowering at all, very smooth. I could drink these all day. I normally won't go for these in the summer, a bit too heavy for me in the heat, but if the temperature is below 60 I can't get enough of these."
"Overall-Dissapointing, what has happened to this beer? A dilluted down version of itself even among Dry Irish stouts. Beamish has much more flavor, give that a try instead."
"Overall its a good beer, but I really cant stand what the nitro tap does to beers like this: while it gives the beer a nice sustaining head, it adds this unpleasant sweetness to it that I think detracts from the overall aroma and flavor of the beer. Also, its pretty thin and watery for a stout. On the other hand, because this beer is fairly light and drinkable, it would make a great session beer (which cant be said about too many dry-stouts out there, IMHO). Also, the bottle says that this beer has less than 130 calories per 12oz serving, so for anyone on a diet, Id imagine that this is easily a much more flavorful choice than just about any other light beer out there. Still, even though beers of this style are prized for their roasted maltiness, I would have liked to have smelled and tasted more hop character. All and all, not amazing, but pretty good. Recommended."
"Drinkability - I think the drinkability on this is pretty good. Not my favorite but very smooth and easy. Relatively low abv lets you throw back a few."
"My appearance rating is based on the wonderful head and great dark color you get when getting it out of a keg at a bar. Basically the beer had little taste or smell and left me wanting more. A big disappointment."
"Haven't had a Guinness for quite some time, and one of my roommates offered one up to help finish off the St. Patrick's Day stock. What a disappointment. Sure, I may have been about 17 years old when I last had a Guiness, but in those last 5 years it seems amazing that my perceptions could change THIS much. I remember a brew that was completely impermeable to all light and that was damn near completely intolerable because of the dryness and the bitter roastiness of the malt. Now all I taste is a creamy, watery substance with a very small residual hint of the roasted barley. The beer even shines through a small hint of ruby, though I suppose it is still dark enough that I could have exaggerated the intensity in my youth. The head is a sticky, creamy foam, actually looks quite appealing. The smell was decent too, but the richness of the aroma was lost in the taste, which as I said was like water. No dryness to be spoken of. No wonder so many masses of mindless Americans are able pound so much of this shit each year on the day where everybody suddenly thinks they are Irish. It wasn't totally bad, but for the stout I remember, it was VERY disappointing. I'll stick to Rogue's Shakespeare, Chocolate, or Imperial Stouts when I have the craving for something a little roasty."
"This beer pours a thick white head with tiny bubbles that lasts through the glass. The body of the beer is almost black but has a ruby tinge. Aroma is all malt. Taste is roasted malt with a barely detectable hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is creamy. Drinkablity is good, a great session beer but probably would get boring after a few."
"I wanted to wait until I got to Ireland and had a taste of Guiness in its homeland to make this review, and I finally did. I could not be more disappointed. The idea that this average (at best) stout tastes better in a Dublin pub than it does at, say, a Times Square tourist trap, is nothing but myth. It's served just as cold in the pubs of Ireland (and I went to several throughout the west, south, and in Dublin) as it is here. The appearance makes this beer, while the lack of any sort of flavor beyond a bland feint, nondistinctive, cold coffee effect ruins the legend. I always suspected that Guiness was nothing more than marketing and myth; know I know. Don't believe the hype of this Hibernian Budweiser."
"Like a lot of us, I really used to like Guinness when I first got into drinking better beer. Since I've been checking out this site and trying new beers all the time I really kind of forgot about it and haven't had it in a while. Last night in honor of St. Patty's I started my night off with a Guinness on tap. I really wasn't too impressed. I mean it still has those typical Guinness things that you like; the nice classic Guinness appearance, the easy quaffability, etc... But it's really not that tasty to me anymore. There are better dry stouts. So I was thinking this last night and then my thoughts seemed to be backed up by the forum post about the declining quality of Guinness over the years. It's definately been popularized and rather macro-ized and really has kind of become a characature of itself. I prefer it out of the can for the cascade effect but really it's kind of just become a novelty act."
"I prefer the nitro cans poured into a glass, but straight from the bottle ain't bad either. It's the most easy drinking stout out there, which isn't to say it is the best stout. I ordered a bottle at a restaurant and couldn't believe how fast I drank it. So I got another and did the same thing. It's almost like a stout light. Very average on all levels compared to good stouts, but this is the most drinkable session stout I can think of. Great with almost all types of food."
"This beer pours a slightly rubied dark dark brown to black color with a finger of tight foam over top. The nose is nice and roasty, right about where I expect things to be. The flavor is nice, but a little thin for me. I want a bit more full flavor. The aftertaste has a nice bitter roasty quality to it. The feel is moderate and creamy. Overall, the aftertaste keeps me coming back to this beer time and time again. Its not as dry as others I have had in the past couple of days. I think Guinness may have been toppled as the best irish stout in my book. I still like and enjoy it, but it seems to be missing something here."
"It's St. Patrick's Day so I'm reviewing Guinness. I obtained my Guinness in one of those 14.9 oz. cans. Guinness pours a black color with no light to be seen through it. What little light appears around the edges of the glass is an extremely dark reddish brown. The creamy off-white head is about one finger high and stays on top of the beer producing a good web of lacing on the glass. The smell is of coffee and roasted malt with a slight burnt character as well. The taste is of coffee and cream, and bitter roasted malt. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth with hardly any carbonation. Guinness is a great beer, but certainly not the end all be all of beer. I'd have another though."
"Poured dark opaque brown, nice creamy head that retained well, smell was of roasted coffee, taste was a creamy mocha, bith a slight bitterness toward the end, mouthfeel was little carbonation, and a bit creamy, drinkability is excellent IMO, although I have had Stouts I liked better, this is nice!"
"Comments - I've noticed many reviews knocking pretty hard on this beer. To be sure, there are stouts out there that are more exciting in certain ways. However, this beer is a classic in my opinion. The beer probably also has played an important role in the advance of craft beer in the United States (again, in my opinion)."
"Is this the most reviewed beer on BA? In my opinion it might be one of the most overated too. The appearance is good enough. Almost black in color with a sizable creamy head from the nitro. The aroma is lightly of roasted chocolate, but not strong or memorable. This is light on taste, it's unoffensive, but not notable. Roasted taste is noted, but seems too restrained. Taste is too watery for a stout and needs more character. I won't be picking this up again."
"Good, but seriously... This is not an irish stout."
"Drinkability: This second time, I enjoyed more my drinking time, but I am disappointed by its lack of taste and personnality. After it is poured in your glass, it is like drinking cold coffee. I hope that I missed something and I hope to review it again."
"I have to admit - I am not that thrilled about the beer, but a well poured Guinness settling is one of the most beautiful sights on earth. The beer is good - but not all that many Guinness junkies claim. It is a nice dry stout - smooth and easy to drink. At many ""Irish"" bars in the US it is the closest you can get to real beer, so it fills a nice niche. The malt bill is impressive - it does have a nice deep malt taste and aroma."
"Its like a trophy beer.. all appearance and no substance."
"is what sets guinness apart, what makes it special. I love beer of all styles,colors, countries, and continents. I have made beer, read about beer, written about it, and made a living selling it. I will always come back to guinness."
"Everyone should have at least one pint of Guiness draught in their lifetime, and that is all there is to it."
"I think I'll stay away from Guinness in this form, it just doesn't live up the name I don't think."
"Still, Guinness is a classic."
"Notes: Like Corona, a geniously marketed import. Unlike Corona, Guinness has quality to back up the hype. I'd heard that Guinness was ""like a meal."" That is definitely not true. Although it is pretty thick, the calories and heaviness don't allow me to agree. 12 oz of Mountain Dew has 170 cal, while a Guinness has only 126. I drank 9 cans of this and a pint on my birthday, so it gets big points for drinkability."
"Same roasted aroma and taste that you'd expect from Guinness, creamy mouthfeel and smooth going down. I noticed that Guinness on nitro is more creamy and has a better mouthfeel and look thanks to the dense head, but felt that the nitro takes a little bit away from the taste. Still a great session beer and a great fallback on-tap if there's nothing better around."
"poured this from a nitro-can with the widget technology. Made a cool sputtering noise when I popped it open. Nice deep dark color with a large foamy head that stays throughout. Has an interesting flavor, almost a roasted taste. The mouthfeel is very smooth, and easy to drink. A decent session beer, but avoid the bottled form at all costs!"
"Poured from a bottle into a glass, this beer looks good at first. A very dark hue, just as close to black as I've maybe ever seen. The head is very thick and also a nice grayish-brown color. Yet after I tasted it, I realized that looks can be very decieving. This has got to be the most overrated beer I've ever tried. Extra thin and very watery-feeling, the taste leaves a lot to be desired. There is somewhat of a stout flavor, but it is scarce and just too watery. It is also missing carbonation, I mean there is NONE to speak of at all. The mouthfeel and taste remind me of a 1/2 drank beer that gets shoved back into the fridge and then resorted to another 3 days later, only to find that its really not good anymore. Tastes old and way too flat. I was highly disappointed by this brew, as I expected something way more than what I tasted."
"Overall: Eh. Widely available as a fall-back, but it's so watery that I can't imagine ever falling back to it."
"To me, guiness is the macrobrew of english stouts. It poured a deep black into my mug, with a tan head that lingered for quite some time. The smells are of chocolate and coffee, with that malt base. The taste is of malt, molasses, chocolate and coffee, with a bit of yeast and not a hint of hops coming through. Perhaps a bit of very dark bread, also. To me, the mouthfeel is almost milky, with not enough of the carbonation or pepperiness that I enjoy. For that reason, I find Guinness to not be a very drinkable ale. I do quite enjoy a good stout, but for some reason I am not very fond of Guinness. Perhaps it is because I have only had the American bottled version and the nitro can."
"Respect beer? Brilliant!"
"For some reason I like this stuff more out of the nitro can. It looks better, smells better, and is more drinkable. The nitro bottle seems have a weaker cascading effect, a slightly weaker smell, and more bland taste. It does have a better mouthfeel though."
"Very drinkable in terms of lightness on the palate, but the nitro bottle is not doing it for me. A much better beer on tap is an understatement. Back in the day, this one opened my eyes to actual beer versus macro-light-crap. Not nearly as exciting as it once was for me, but still an old favorite. This serving type though is extremely unappealing."
"Served on tap in the obligatory pint glass. When served properly, this is a glorious beer to look at. It's a very dark brown with a thick, creamy head. As I drank the beer, the sides of the glass were almost totally covered in foam. Between the color and the great lacing, this glass of Guinness is probably the best looking beer I've had so far. The taste is a letdown, though. The mouthfeel is very thin for a stout, and the aftertaste has a dry bitterness that seems artificial for some reason. Guinness is a nice alternative in places with a thin beer selection, but it's basically the Budweiser of the stout world."
"This might be the most famous of them all, but there are some far better dry stouts out there"
"Yep, I do."
"Despite the watery nature of this beer, it is readily available and has some refreshing qualities. Good but not very good."
"I think it has a very dry, slightly bitter, earthy flavor, with some minor notes of chocolate, and a strange sour twang that makes it a Guinness. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, but not as full-bodied as the brewery would have you believe. The drinkability is relatively high -- it's a go-to session stout, and one can easily put away several pints in a night. This is what the entire Guinness empire is built upon."
"Perhaps the most drinkable and pleasing of the commonly available beers on tap at most restaurants and bars. Guinness manages to be pretty consistant, with an excellent appearance, dark and thick, with a vigorous head and the wonderful nitro cascade. The smell is just average, having little in the way of distinctive aromas, just a basic stout smell and a little less fragrant than some of the better stouts. The taste is well above average, nothing to write home about and not as creamy as I like my stouts, but there is a distinctive flavor of hops that is pleasing. The mouthfull is good and full, what you would expect of a stout. A very drinkable beer. Pretty much my staple in bars that don't have large selections of ""good"" beers."
"I know there are better stouts out there and I am told what we get in the states is a pale comparison to what you would find in Ireland but this will always remain a favorite."
"Just a great beer."
"There are rumors that the American product is kegged in the US from a combination of the ""Essence of Guinness"" (A product of Ireland) and the same malt base used in malternatives. I will find out the truth one day."
"I've decided I've become fed up with the increasing shittiness of Guinness on tap. Every time I have a pint it becomes more watery and disappointing."
"Very easy to drink. Although certainly not my favorite stout it makes a great classic fall back when the selection is nill and this is almost always a choice at most places in Boston both at the Bar and in the Store. It lacks a little in the nitro can as oppose to the tap, but still very easy to put a few of them down. IMO, a safe bet."
"Just say no to ""Guinness"""
"Drinkability and Overall: This is a below average stout, that is nothing special. I've always heard this was a great ""fallback"" beer if nothing is available, but I disagree. Somehow I managed to skip this on my road to better beer, and I'm glad I did."
"I got this for Christmas. Thanks mom. It's ok, I guess. It came with a little mini CD ROM that shows those adorable little men from the commercials talking about famous plays in sports history. The disc was easily the best part of the package."
"Nitro can, pours like cold creamed coffee. Massive brown cascading head with lasting power and lacing. Roasted coffee aroma with chocolate hints, and little hops. This is a bitter beer, smooth and roasted, it has a creamy aftertaste accented by the nitrogen. The body is thin even with the nitrogen, and leaves a coffee aftertaste. This is a good stout that others can be measured against."
"D is reasonably good. hate to trash a brewer but here I go."
"Drinkability: Fantastically drinkable beer. Love to go with these for a session, the ABV is relatively low at 4.2, so you can have a ton and not be in too bad of shape. Given an unlimited amount of free guinness in an evening, i'm not sure when I'd stop."
"If you've never tried an irish dry stout before, I think Guinness would be a great way to break into the style. Just be sure you have Guinness on its own before you branch out into black-and-tans or irish car bombs. To experience it properly, I think you have to start with the basics."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, however there is almost no carbonation. Goes down like water. I could have a few of these, but there are plenty other stouts that I'd go to first."
"This beer tasted and felt watered down. I gave a friend a drink and he said the same thing. Just a hint of the things I love about Guinness, its a shame."
"Taste: Real smooth, so smooth I feel like it's clogging up something when I drink it."
"drinkability: good overall taste combined with low ABV equals a great session beer"
"What can I say, I'm a sucker for the look of nitro stouts. Velvety black body, with ruby highlights, and a thick, nitro-creamy, light off-tan head that never goes away. Smells of light roasted barley, mild milk chocolate, and nitro cardboard. Tastes much the same. I like the complexity of the roasted/milk chocolate malt flavor. Combined with the creamy, silky, full-bodied mouthfeel, it makes for a tasty, yet subtlle beer. Better as it warms, and very drinkable."
"Some people love to hate Guinness. I think it is the best Irish Dry Stout that man has created. Pitch black with it's creamy tan head that never goes away... I dig nitro dispensed beers... The light aroma of dark malts is nice and mellow. The flavor is every bit as mellow. It is a sweet and has a bit of a roasted malt bite that dry's out the finish. The hops are indiscernible in the background, but that is fine for the style. It is as good in the draught can as it is on tap. I wonder if it really is better in Ireland, but I think the American/Canadian version is pretty good. With it's low alcohol content it is easy to drink all night long."
"The famed Guinness poured black with a nice white head that left good lacing. The smell was rather weak, with only hints of roasted malts and dark chocolate. The taste didn't impress me either. Some coffee and chocolate and then a strong bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel was not all that great either, rather thin for such a dark beer. As for the drinkability; if this is the best beer that a bar serves, I'll be drinking rum and coke."
"very thin. very tasteless. does not possess most of the stout qualities which i enjoy."
"I have heard so many people refer to this stuff as the best beer ever it makes me sick. While i like the fact that it is available in nitor cans, which makes a final product that taste a lot like chocolate milk, there are much better stouts in the world. I do wish this had an abv of the extra stout, i would most likely get it more often."
"Also best on tap in Ireland, I tried one in England and it didnt have the same flavor."
"Overall, enjoy the head, fear the aftertaste. Everything in between is unremarkable."
"The BAs know you're just a poser."
"Smells/Tastes great, not at all overpowering, but the amount of flavor makes me think it should be. Wonderful beer"
"Stout water?"
"I noticed I haven't reviewed this beer on tap and I think that I really should considering the number of times I have had it on tap. This beer is so much better on tap, when it's not old, then out of the nitro can. I think the nitro masks all that this beer has to offer. Not really bitter but more of a chocolate, grainy flavor going along with some creaminess. I could drink this on tap all night long and when compared to Beamish or Murphy's, its in a league of its own."
"for best results drink from tap at a genuine Irish bar. Doesn't get much better folks"
"Consumed in October 2004 at the Prince of Wales Pub in San Mateo, CA. The barkeep took forever to pour this brew. The head kept growing bigger and bigger and would not subside. It took literally 5 minutes from the time they started pouring to the time I actually got the beer in my hands. Needless to say, it was a nice pour. Looks pretty damn black and creamy. Smells of dark malt. Not a whole lot of coffee scent, just dark, burnt roasted malt. Taste is just ho-hum to me. A little coffee flavor and admitedly goes down very smooth. Served at room temp which was also nice for this kind of beer. Have had this beer many times before and I am just getting around to rating it. A good beer, but not a great one in my opinion. A good stand by though. A pretty drinkable beer."
"The only ""negative"" to this beer is the low ABV%. It's like trying to drink light beers and getting a nice buzz on...it's a difficult task. On the other hand, this makes the perfect session beer on tap at my local Irish pub."
" A non-fat, low calorie instant breakfast !"
"I suppose I should complete this trilogy, and go to a bar to review a pint from the keg, but I seriously doubt that will happen anytime soon."
"Drinkability: A great session beer."
"The taste is similar, tastes sour on the palate but as it warms in the mouth you can taste more of the goodness that is Guinness. It has husky grains taste with coffee, and and another taste that reminds me of cranberries. Mouthfell is slightly thinner than expected but I don't really know why people can't drink more than 2 at a setting. I do think this beer is an acquired taste for most people. This is truly a unique beer in most ways."
"Taste...just wasn't the same as on tap. Seemed a little more watery. Still that classic guinness taste, but just a lot less. Lacked the smooth and creaminess too. This beer is just not meant to be had in a bottle."
"Guinness Draught is one of the wimpiest stouts that I've ever had. It challenges my taste buds about as much as kindergarten final exams would challenge my intellect. It may have been a slightly better experience if I had sampled it straight from the bottle, but any beer that has to rely on a gimmick such as that gets no respect from me. This is a beer that doesn't deserve to be taken seriously. Next."
"I have had the chance to drink Guinness on tap in Ireland and let me tell you it is better than the Guinness you find on tap here in the states. It is also much better than the rocket bottle and the can. In Ireland it is a science on how the perfect Guinness pint is poured. When done correctly you are left with a creamy half inch or so thick head that is just as enjoyable to drink as the rest of the beer. It goes down smoothly consisting of rich coffee and chocolate flavors. I highly recommend this beer."
"On reconsideration after having a few more of these, I've got to recant much of what was said here. While it was surprising to find a lighter bodied stout than expected, there have been quite a few times when I've been looking forward to and even craving that can of nitro-fuzzy goodness in the fridge. It's still light bodied, but it is smoooth and when that's what you're looking for, the Nitro-Guinness delivers!"
"Guinness Bottles... nothing special. Guinness 20oz ""Imperial"" Pint from a Nitro tap... effing amazing. Rich, creamy, smooth... reminds me of a coffee milkshake. Not bitter in the least. The appearance is just sublime, dark black in a guinness pint glass, bubbles floating down, thick tan head, condensation on the outside of the glass... almost a kodak moment. Man I love stouts."
"As a stout, this is not very monumental, but the availability and superiority to other macro crap gives this extra points."
"I know many people wont go for the nitro-can idea but if you have to pick up your beer in a rush at the local convenience store or grocery ...this is the deal. Its heads and heels better than anything with Budweiser,Coors,Miller, etc on the label, and it may not be as good as true Guinness on tap but it will sure do in a pinch. Hell I love the stuff !"
"A classic who's legacy can't be refuted. The bread and butter of the beer world. Not amazing, but approachable in every aspect. A solid all around beer."
"guinness pours a pitch black with a one finger head that retains well through my consumtion. liked the cascading effect that continues for about 45 seconds after first poured. smell is rather faint burnt barley and coffee. taste is just as good as i had remembered. coffee like flavor with a hint of chocolate, slightly dry. mouth feel felt rather thin in comparison to what i had remembered. easily drinkable. a fine stout when no other is availible. prefer murphy's by a hair but, would rather have a good, thick domestic stout."
"But really, nothing compares to the tap draught."
"As always, it pours out pitch black and chocolately with a creamy off-white head. After watching the storm show in the glass subside, I inhale the coffee and chocolate scents. Intensely smooth with just an eensy bit of carbination that taps you on the tongue. Always so drinkable any time of the year, hell, any time of the day!"
"always wondered if this was any good. friend conned me into trying it. Never tasted a beer quite like it, nice flavor. not too bitter. i dont know exactly what the thing inside is but it makes it unique. pretty descent brew overall. I'll have to try it on real tap one day. but until then it's not bad out of the bottle."
"Taste: Creamy, yet very light on the palate. No trace of hops here until the very end. But that is even very quick, and could have been mistaken for the bitterness left from the malt due to its roasting. Ver nice dessert beer, when in need of something light."
"Drinkability was slightly above average."
"Well Guinness is a well liked stout all over the world and it obviously rules bars during St. Patrick's day. I was lucky enough to travel over to Ireland last summer and take a tour of this great brewery. Much history goes into this brew. Smooth taste with a great head that coats the glass with a tasty film. Guinness is very enjoyable and is usually used by many people to compair other stouts. It has a great color black almost dark ruby if held to a light. It really is good to drink and it can fill you up. It does have a rather low ABV which many people don't care but I like stouts with a little more to them. In conclusion the brewery is great and the beer is decent. Drinking it on the top floor of the observation deck in the brewery over looking Dublin is a great experience."
"Dark brown purple color. The head is perfectly creamy and dense; it lasts forever. It was great to see how the fine white bubbles came from the lower part of the glass to form the head.The smell shows dark malts, a nice roasted coffee aroma, coffee beans, and almost some smoke. The taste is of coffee and chocolate, with some roasted notes and hints of smoke; a deep chocolate like bitterness. The mouthfeel is terrible. Weak, watery. You can't even get the creamy head, it remains in the glass. The mouthfeel makes me not wanna drink this beer again."
"It has a nice foam, and is ok refreshing, but definitely nothing special. The Nigerian Guinness Foreign Extra is a much richer, more complex and satisfying brew to me."
"Dense, creamy, light brown head on top of black beer with deep red highlights. The aroma was slightly sharp, with a light roasted smell. It had a light bitterness and strong roasted barley flavour, with some sourness in the mix, producing a dry finish. Not much in the way of malt sweetness. Very lightly carbonated and very smooth, but the light body leaves it a little thin. Head retention was great, with plenty left over at the end of the pint and thick lace down the sides of the glass."
"Not a horrible beer, but not much better than average. A lot of bars are keeping this and Sam Adams as their good beers. Given the choice between this, and Mic Ultra, Im definitely going for the widget bottle. The flavor is much different than the traditional tap. I thought the can had the same problems too."
"The process and understanding behind a properly poured Guinness can be very Zenlike. It is an excellent choice for those who are looking for some solace from the everyday world or perhaps relax and have some good times amongst friends and family."
"A staple in the refrigerator."
"Guiness of draught in England varies considerably from pub to pub, and a lot has to be said for the way it is poured and kept. If it is not a popular drink in a bar, then don't touch it...it could be flat and sour. They always say draught Guiness tastes better in Ireland, but it's probably more to do with the way it is poured than the beer itself. Somehow I do not think they brew a special Guiness just for the Irish bars ! I enjoy the dark mysterious appearance and creamy head that you can draw faces in, the very burnt malt and hops taste that lingers, though, as others have said, the finish can seem a bit thin. If it is served too cold, then you loose some of its subtle overtones. I enjoy one or two pints of Guiness, but more than that and you can have trouble in the morning!!"
"Nitro can: Poured a dark black beer with a nice foamy head with ultra long retention due to the nitro ball. Aroma and taste are quite dry and bitter with notes of roasted malts also being very present. Aftertaste is a bit too watery for my liking but overall I think this is a classic and pretty decent classic drink."
"I have a hard time not being biased towards this beer. This was the first beer that got me started being a BA. That being said, there are many stouts that far surpass this one. It pours dark black with the cascading foam that's hard to beat. Not much in the smell department but it does smell like good ol' Guinness. I really enjoy the taste although a little on the dry and on the boring side. Easy for me to drink a yit-load of these though."
"Usual impressive Guinness nitro head and bubble action, with great lacing. Not much in the aroma department, just a bit of dark grains and that ""Guinness"" smell, which I stumble trying to put into words. Taste was as expected from a nitro, somewhat deadened, but still a presence, for sure. Mouthfeel was the usual good nitro, and drinkability was excellent. Just don't know about their suggestion to drink it from the bottle, I'll take a glass, thanks."
"And to the people at Guinness, PLEASE make your Guinness on tap not foam so damn much. The bartenders spend 5 minutes scooping and repouring and it just makes it even flatter and gives the nitrogen too long to sit."
"Tasty creamy roasted malt flavor with coffee overtones. Ultra smooth, goes down fast. Like margaritas, there's hardly an alcohol in 'em and you'll have to put plenty down to fall off your barstool. Though the drinkability drops a bit with the ""meal in a glass"" feel, a Guinness pint only has 210 calories. But, if it takes 6 to make you happy, well, there's your calories. All in all, the more stouts I try the farther this creeps down my list of favorites, but still good stuff, and a great ""old standby"" in NYC where it's always on tap, even if you're stuck in a sh*thole."
"Lovely stuff, this. Pitch black in color, with a tan head. The nitro widget does an admirable job of replicating the cacading bubbles of a tap pour. Nice aroma of coffee and chocolate, and it comes through in the taste as well. It can be a little bland, but that's not necessarily a bad thing if you're looking for a mellow stout to knock back without needing a spoon. Mouthfeel is absolute satin. Some make a big deal about this not being genuine Guinness, or not up to a pub draw. I say let 'em, if it means there's more of it lying about for me. No point in being snobbish about what is essentially a good, light, utterly drinkable stout."
"Nitro boost creates an aesthetically perfect beer that I won't describe as it has already been done ad nauseum. Smell is all roasted malts. Taste is slightly burnt malt in abundance with a hint of hops for balance. Mouthfeel is thin for a stout, and I've honestly had Browns with more body. Drinkability is decent but boring. A one-dimensional that may be representative of the fact that it was imported. Honestly though, Black Butte Porter is a stouter beer than this. Stout for people who like the idea of drinking stout, but not real stout."
"Well the almighty Guinness, we meet at last. I was up in Hell's Kitchen for Halloween and my buddy took me to this place Scruffy Duffy's (coolest damn sports bar ever, check it out if your ever in NY) and wouldn't let me order anything until I tried a Guinness on tap. I must say I was very surprised. Dark and smooth, almost coffee like. Then I saw the ABV, 4.1%, with that kinda ABV I could drink this stuff all day!"
"Deep black with a white head that lasted to the bottom. Lacing was in nice coats, sheets, rings, etc. Mild aroma, slight roast, some chocolate. Very very smooth, minimal roasted character. Mouthfeel is creamy and not overbearing. Very drinkable and i had forgotten how enjoyable a Guinness can be. Might have rated higher if it wasn't brought to my table accompanied by a totally frozen lager mug. I will never learn about buying beer in restaurants. I politely told the waitress that this was totally inappropriate and to bring me another glass. All they had was mugs for beer. I stooped caring and took one that wasn't frozen. Wrecked the ambience of the brew. Any how, this is a stout i'm not going to ignore any more. A solid stout."
"d: 4:5 It is so smooth and so tasty that i could drink it all day. With so little ABV, you practically could."
"Guinness needs to be fresh, or it can be terrible; but these days it seems easier to find fresh sources than ""back in the day."" I know it's popular to believe that Guinness varies a lot depending on where it's brewed, but I'm not sure if I believe this. (I'm not saying I actively disbelieve it, either.) There's a huge potential for self-delusion here."
"A very smooth, creamy and easy to drink beer that suits its style to a tee."
"Not a bad brew, just average."
"Edit:I've got to knock the taste from a 5 down to a 4. Either this beer is changing or my tastes are drastically different now. Still good...but not close to perfect."
"A fair stout, found everywhere in the world. Easier to drink than guinness original, but not as full of flavour or as complex."
"I think that Guinness is where a lot of people are turned off by dark beers. I'd take it over a budmillercoors, but if there were a decent stout or porter around, I'd leave this for someone else."
"A descent stout. Was nice and dark with a very nice foamy off-white head which lasted for some time. Taste was rather bland, it was neither sweet or bitter. I found the taste to be disappointing. Very nice smooth mouthfeel. OK if this is the only dark choice at the bar."
"THis is a step up from the standard macroswill that college campuses tend to be congested with. I'm at leats happy that my friend drinks this instead of Busch Lite. Appearance is a light translucent brown, and seeing as how i took the advice of the bottle and drank straight from it, i couldnt tell you any more than that, save for the fact that it kept foaming over the top. Smell is mettalic and wheaty, with some meaty protein hints but not very much complexity at all. Taste is about the same, with a bitter metallic taste, but its clearly not from hops. Tastes kind of earthy, with some wheat and malt in there. Mouthfeel is thicker than most other macros, as would be expected, and there is little carbonation, which combines to make it feel like youre drinking foamy milk. Its an ok choice if you want something a step above regular macro, but not really a good choice if you want a real stout. I hear the Guinness Extra Stout is better though..."
"Slainte"
"Well, I have to say that one of my favorite parts of beer is the lovely Guinness cascade, which the nitro can didn't do very well. Guinness may have been the first ""dark beer"" I ever had, but I can tell that I've outgrown it, as this just doesn't have the bite that most other stouts do. It's a good fallback beer, especially at bars that don't have much else, but I wouldn't go looking for it (not that I have to, of course)."
"More than anything else, it's uniquely Guinness. It's not as special as some have made it out to be, but it's definitely still a good beer."
"Overall - This is a let-down for a stout. If you are looking for a true, full-bodied stout/beer, pass this by and go for a non-macro version. This is a very so-so brew."
"Stout is my favorite style of beer, this said I wonder why it took me so long to drink this. Guinness Draught pours a dark coffee black with a creamy, frothy tan head that did not subside through drinking, the head alone will leave you breathless. The lacing on the glass is incredible, you literally can't see the glass because it is covered by frothy lacing. The smell is of roasted malts with hints of mocha. The taste is very suprising, as I didn't like the Extra Stout offering from Guinness, this version is incredible, dark mocha flavors and caramel tones will bounce off the tongue, suprisingly refreshing. Feels very full and dry in the mouth. A very drinkable stout, probably the most drinkable for me, not to rich, nor to light, but my god the head."
"Well, this is too watery for me to think that strongly of it as a Stout, but its a refreshing drink and the nitro-can adds something to the experience. Im sure Ill be drinking this again as its the dankest option in many bars/restaurants."
"The beer is beautiful. Nice and black. Nice creamy head. No hop aroma. Taste is surprisingly... absent? The nitro kills what flavor there might have been. I try to hallucinate some roasted grains or burnt grains, and I get a tiny whiff. There is a minimal hop bitterness. The worst part is that it is so darn thin. I was struck by the fact that it tasted like water after the moderate bodied pale ale I had just before. It made for a great teaching point for my newbie friends, though. They were so surprised at how thin and light the Guinness was. ""Guinness is like a meal"" my ass. Anyways, this beer isn't wholly bad, just don't drink it after you've had a beer with any body at all."
"No aroma. Very little carbonation. A nice, creamy texture. But as I drink I note sour hops, a slightly burnt, yet syrupy malt. Bit of metal in the finish, along with the syrup of malt. It never hit me before how sweet this is."
"Guinness is also a very smooth beer. The mouth feel is creamy but with a low specific gravity and caloric value, this beer also feels light on the stomach. It is certainly easy to drink and makes a good session beer. The taste, although much better than a typical macro is a little on the watery side when compared to other stouts. Still, this beer is available just about everywhere and is allowing beer drinkers to get a consistently good, albiet not great product at most drinking holes."
"Happy St. Patrick's Day."
"The smell of Guinness is unlike any other. Charred. Roasted. Chocolate. Coffee. These are just a handful of words that come to mind when I smell a Guinness, and the taste, too, could accompany these words. The mouth feel is smooth as silk, as there seems to be a negligible amount of carbonation in Guinness. Also, to be as dark as it is, Guinness is very easy to drink. I typically don't buy Guinness because of the tremendous variety of other things I buy instead, but at least on St. Pat's, I gotta have some Guinness!"
" You can enjoy any other thing, any other time, but it is nice to go back some time"
"Guinness on St. Patty's Day, on-tap at Slainte."
"**Edit** (3/17/06) - Two years since my initial review and I enjoy Guinness even more than i used to. As my palate becomes more trained towards different feels and flavors, I have found that I really enjoy Guinness Draught. The appearance and mouthfeel are superior, second to none...Truly a unique creation and highly enjoyable."
"This is a case of my palate being upgraded by many of the stouts I've sampled in the years since I last had one of these. Standing alone, it's still one of the most drinkable examples of the style out there, but in comparison to some others, I realize that in some ways it pales. I have to say, it's certainly a classic, but it's something like a starter beer in the wide world of available stouts. But please, understand that I'd never say no to one of these. Often it's the best available on tap at a given establishment, and I'll order one gladly. It's just that it's no longer the one I think of when I want to go this route. Goes to show you, nothing lasts forever, no matter the marketing."
"Many people trash this beer now. I understand that it doesn't taste as it once did, and what get in the US (from Canada) is almost an insult. Still, I find myself coming back to this beer now and again. I think it goes great with Irish food, and there is just something attractive about this beer."
"14.9 oz nitro can. Pours jet black with a soft tiny bubble head, which stays and stays, leaving alot of creamy lace/froth. The classic stout. All I get in the nose is a bit of malt. Taste is pure roasted and burnt maltiness. Coffee upfront and a hint of vanilla. Sublime and subtle. Chalky, bitter hops arrive next on the tongue. Mouthfeel is luscious and smooth. More malt and hops in a fine long finish. I love this in the nitro-can delivery mode, much better then the non-nitro bottles."
"On-tap: Solid dark fudge brown, nearly black, thick and emensely dense dark cream head about a finger high, very frothy and whipped with caverness divets and rolling lumps. Lacing coats the glass very well in broken sheets. Smell is lightly roasty and chocolatey with a subdued dryness and sweetness of soft bread. Taste yields about the same as what the smell delivers with a slight roasy tone of malts the whole way through and dotting the mix along the way is a soft soggy breadiness thats a bit sweet, chocolate lightly appears with a subdued dryness in the finish. Overall, nothing to strong or lengthy in flavors. Feel is lightly smooth and kinda fluffy with a slight drying finish. It had been a while since the last time I'd had a Guinness in any form, the last being nitro-tap which wasn't very forthcoming, well now I remember why I don't order it on either tap or nitro. Maybe my tastes have changed so dramatically that I can't even enjoy a Guiness anymore. Oh well...?"
"This pours black as night with that staple off-white head that each Irish Stout is topped off with. The smell is sweet with a chocolate presence and coffee hints. Bitter taste with a dry finish of coffee and raosted malts. Sweet dark chocolate rounds this beer out. Very silky smooth feel that goes down well. Hops are barely present. Not a bad beer by any means."
"I like tap better, but this is good science."
"It is hard to knock the appearance of this beer. Watching the cascading effect is truly one of the pleasures of a beer drinker. The smell of this beer is not too strong, some faint notes of roasted malts is all i can perceive. The taste is very plain, this beer simply doesn't taste like much which i believe is do to the nitro. The flavors I do get are those of coffee balanced by a little bit of chocolate. The nitro does make this beer extremely creamy and the drinkability is high as this beer doesn't fatigue the palate. I just don't know who would want to drink this when there are much better stouts out there."
"M & D - Light body for a stout with not much complexity. Very drinkable and with a low ABV."
"PS - I hate non beer drinkers who say, ""Guinness is like a meal"". Ooo, that gets me. Just because it's not transparent and tasteless like a macro, all of a sudden, it's too heavy. It's ABV is less than most macros !! damn !! Have a pint of barleywine and tell me about meals. Ok. Sorry about that."
"Drinkable, I guess but just a really inferior Stout. Every other stout I have tried is better, sad really."
"""Lovely day for a Guinness"""
"I was so excited about trying this new Guiness Draught in the nitro bottle! I poured it out slowly into a nice clean glass with tingles of excitement running through me. I held the glass up to the light... jet black and wonderful! Nice frothy almond head. I took a nice deep sniff.... hmm... not much there. Not bad, but not as strong as I expected. I took a taste. Hmm...it had the aftertaste I expected, but where was the front end flavor??? Kind of felt a little watery. Make that a lot watery!? Not what I expected at all. Not in the least up to the standards I have come to expect from a Guiness brew. I have to say that overall, I'm not impressed."
"I had this a half a dozen times just to make sure that this was not a defect at the particular bar I was at and have to say it is the bigest beer disappointment I can ever remember having."
"The taste features sweet, malty flavors up front followed by a hop balance. The aftertaste offers a lingering burnt, black patent malt. The liquor is viscous and rich. While not as creamy as some stouts, it is a very full bodied. Overall, an excellent beer that commands respect from beginning to end."
"and the body is water thin"
"Overall drinkability isn't very high for me. I can get drunk off of it yes but I would appreciate it much more in moderation with a heavy dinner like the barbecue i mentioned or a hearty beef dish."
"smooth cramy mouthfeel, almost like drinking full cream milk. mmmm."
"When the pour settled it left a beautiful dark brown beer topped by a finger of fine tan head. It smelled of Malt and chocolat. It was flat weak and tasted of burnt grain. The feel was smooth, almost watery, with a sour dry finish. I would have to say that this is a beer I would only drink again in a pinch."
"Figured that since this is the most popularly reviewed beer on this site I might as well put in my $0.02...It is one of the best-looking stouts being nearly pitch black, and having a good creamy head that laces nicely along the glass. The smell is alright, good for a beer that isn't hopped for flavor. Taste is like a very mild coffee and the nitrogen makes for a good ""carbonation"" but not a harsh bubbling in your mouth. Being a lighter beer, I can tilt back quite a few of these..."
"I first heard of this new item when I received an invitation to a party Guinness was throwing on a ferry boat going around Boston Harbor in September 2001. They were going to premier the new Guinness in the bottle. Unfortunately, this shindig has been overshadowed in my life by September 11th (since this party took place on Sept. 10th, 2001). Anyway, I tried the new Guinness and I was impressed with the flavor. The flavor was a 100% improvement on the original Guiness extra stout bottle. However, when I purchased a sixer, I was disappointed to see that it was only 11.7 fluid ounces. I didn't realize this at first, since the Guinness ppl provided us with Guinness bottle covers at the ferry boat party. Also, the design of the bottle makes it look very attractive to those beer drinkers who go on appearence instead of quality. I prefer Guinness by the pint glass at the local pub, but if I need to pick up a pack of Guinness for some home enjoyment, I would purchase the four of the Guinness cans."
"Ink black hue, opaque, via the nitro-widget in the bottle a creamy, beige colored head was produced, about a finger in height, typical cascading effect. I found the overall appearance less impressive out of the bottle in comparison to the nitro-can or nitro-tap. Also the amount of beer looks sadly small in my Guinness imperial pint glass. The nose is small in aroma, light but pleasantly roasted malts that produce hints of coffee and chocolate, watery and hollow, in other words it smells like Guinness. The simplistic pleasantness of the bouquet is also found on the palate, roasty malts produce flavors of coffee and chocolate, sadly watery. The taste is adequate with enough flavors to inspire me to quaff this at the bar when a session beer is needed. The low abv is the most redeeming quality about Guinness in my opinion. Medium-light in body, disappointedly thin and watery, smooth and pleasant mouthfeel. It is plenty easy to drink. This is a beer that has crossed-over many drinker and I will always respect Guinness for that."
"Guinness from a bottle is pretty bad. The only good thing is when the beer is poured and see the little bubbles going down. Also pours a nice thick head. But it's downhill from there. The taste is way too watery. I used to drink guinness quite a bit, but then I started looking for some of the good stuff out there, and now drinking a guinness again is like drinking watered-down stout. There's really no body to this beer. Pluck down the extra 2-4 dollars and get a real six-pack. The only good macro out there is sam adams IMO. Quite honestly, if you're in the mood for an irish stout, go get 4 pack of murphy's or a 6 pack of o'hara's."
"The beer pours a deep black color with a thick tan head. The aroma is good. It is full of black and rosted malts. The taste is decent. It is light tasting for a full bodied beer. It has roasted and black malt flavor with a bit of a watery finish. It is refreshing. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is the first stout I've ever had. It drinks well, but is far from the best out there. It is a good starter stout for first time BA's."
"The current nitro-bottle offering from Guinness has an appearance like no other; a swirling pour from the bottle in the colors of off-white, brown, then an ink-black that forms nicely into the glass; a light tan head that maintains it's consistency until the last gulp of this fine beverage. A decent aroma of roasted malts, nuts and coffee beans. Up front, refreshing, crisp, clean, dark roasted malts noticeable. The body has a delicate creaminess and a lingering sweetness; as this is explored further, she is a bit light in the body, and dare I say a bit watery, perhaps from the widget? Nonetheless, a classic stout, great session brew, perhaps thinned out a bit to appeal to the masses?"
"What can I say? I really like this brew. Sure, it's not as good as Murphy's, but it's still better than most of the crap that's offered at bars and such. It's appearance is a beautiful sight for me, with the cascadeing colors in the begginning, and then it switching over to the pitch black body with the thick creamy tan head. One thing that's cool, is that at the Irish Pud I frequent, they dab the foam on top, so that it forms a clover. The taste is not too shabby. It's got a chocolate maltyness to it, plus the bite of the hops, and then it balances out to a creamy finish. I like this beer. It's gotta be the Irish Catholic in me."
"While spending the holidays in a pool in Dubai, Guinness in a nitro-can was the best beer I could find. I guess one doesn't go to the Persian Gulf to drink beer. Anyway, the bartender at the in-pool bar at my hotel poured the beer properly, and it looked mighty fine, deep and dark against the blue sky, with a one finger tan head that lingered much longer than the whisps of clouds baked away by the sun. The smell was roasted nuts, caramel and malt, full and flavorful. The mouth was thick and smooth. The taste? Well, after a week of euro-lagers on tap, the roasty bitterness of this Guinness really hit the spot. Sure, it's better on tap. But the two I had while lounging in the pool that afternoon in early January tasted mighty good."
"I do understand why many people think of this as the best beer in the world. They have never tried Shakespear Stout."
"Guinness on tap was a waste of my money and time. I don't care about any beers reputation this beer blew!!!"
"taste is mild and roasty. kinda watery but yet dry enough to make it very drinkable. nothing overwhelming or great. just ok. if i am in th right mood and it's a special occassion, i'll use this as a session beer, rarely."
"It's better on tap, and it's probably really better on tap in Ireland. Anyhow, it's still good. Although, I can't figure out why I used to think Guinness was so filling. So many people still think this way even though it has such a watery consistency."
"Says drink from the bottle kind of strange. Guess the tan plastic ring on top is the head(appearance 1). Not much smell either Tastes is lacking also, little more bitter from the bottle but it tastes more wartered down that way. Tried a glass pours nice and dark with rich creamy tan head. Smells of malt some roasting . Tastes light malt dry creamy touch of hops. Thin mouthfeel for a stout but drinakable. Just ignore drink from the bottle and its not to bad."
"This is a great standard beer for me. If I can't decide I'll go with a Guinness. Its creamy and smooth, with a nice slight bitterness. The color is also quite impressive, although to many people the color can be a deterrent, which is sad, because it is a smooth and flavorful beer."
"The smell was good but not very strong. I don't have the most incredible sense of smell so I wouldn't worry too much about it."
"Overall, still a decent beer, but just doesn't compare to the real draught version or even the nitro can whether you leave it in the bottle or pour it in a glass."
"Beautiful appearance, but then it went downhill. I was exepcting much more from a beer on tap. Smell was very faint malt and didn't invite you to drink more. Taste was mild, but witha bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel was watery. I know the abv is low, but there could have been more flavor. Easy enough to drink with the cheesburger I was eating."
"When the pour is fresh, there is a wonderul thick head on the top of your beer. You should be able to draw in it or make little 'peaks' on the head by dipping your finger in the beer. Guinness doesn't offer a variety or real depth of flavor, but never disappoints. Its flavor hits almost immediately with hints of coffee dark bitter chocolate. I can drink Guinness like chocolate milk - except in larger quantities."
"Feels very creamy but that doesn't make the beer more drinkable to me."
"I didnt really like Guinness from the bottle when comparing it to the nitro-can or tap. When poured it sort of flat not as I was used to. Its color was the standard black and the head was rahter weak and not very creamy. Kinda expected that though. The smell was almost dryish. The taste at first was good like a guinness from tap but the after taste is what really turned me off. It had a burnt bacon like after taste. I dont know how else to explain it. It was drinkable but the lingering after taste I didnt like."
"While not quite as good as a true pint of nitro-tap Guinness, the nitro canned version is decent. When you pop the top you can hear the nitrogen ball rushing the nitrogen into the beer. On the pour you get that wonderful cascading affect, that settles after a few moments and creates a pitch black, opque beer, with a lovely, dense, creamy nitro head of foam. The aromas are a bit subdued compared to draught, but they are still nice. They consist of roasted malts, and slight hops. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, but not as smooth as draught, and the drinkability takes a bit of a hit as well, for all of the above differences."
"The taste is mellow and not overly exciting for a stout, but it is pleasant. The roasted malt is most notible. Very creamy and smooth mouthfeel. The body is thin for a stout, but this make this a great session beer if there are no other good beers on draft."
"Black creamy liquid isn't for me I guess. Though, I do understand why many would love it."
"Impression--Mediocre out of a ""widget"" bottle. The real deal is quite impressive, as I recall. Most Irish folks told me that you would be unlikely to find a decent pint outside of the Republic. They be correct."
"I still drink this beer when I go out. (Remember, this is Wichita and my choices are severely limited.) But I rarely, if ever, buy it to bring home anymore."
"Another way for the Guinness corporation to diversify its interests."
"a classic even tho its not an especially great beer. guinness is the stepping stone for anyone looking to get past the usual dirge of boring lagers etc that pervade the market. pretty 'sexy' too as far as appearances go. if only every beer poured like this one."
"Unique in the sense that it's the best looking poor tasting beer I've had."
"On the whole, Guinness is a decent stout that is quite easy to drink. Still a good standby, I can think of a number of other stouts I'd rather drink, given the choice."
"Had to slum it last night while out with some friends. This was the best I could do. I had to ask the barkeep for a glass, and finally received one. Poured out a dark brown with minimal head. Decent lacing at least. Smelled weak. Very weak. Like maybe there was a roasted coffeesque flavor in there, but where? Didn't have much to the taste at all. A decent roasted flavor was in there, but it was really watered down. Decent flavor, just not a whole lot of it. I would say the gem of this beer though, was the mouthfeel. Very smooth and creamy. Very smooth. With a low ABV, it's also quite drinkable, and I'll take it over a Bud any day of the week. At least I'm not waking up this morning too sick. What little there is I blame on Tecate."
"John"
"Taste is bitter but smooth and creamy. Also watery and weak. Taste teases but refuses to satisfy. mouthfeel is also watery yet creamy with a light bitter malt aftertaste. Drinkable for sure but this is a different beer in the bottle vs. draft. Very good on draft, pretty mediocre in the can/bottle. The only good reason to have some around the house is for homemade black and tans, half and halfs and the like."
"Still an exceptional stout. Mine was a can brought back from Ireland, so it was not the export from Toronto. Beautiful silky black appearance topped with a creamy beige head. Coffee and chocolate lightly flow over the tounge with a nice dry slightly bitter finish. Goes down smooth like a glass of chocolate milk made from fine milk chocolate"
"What is my point? Guinness is not the greatest beer (obviously), but in the right place, and when poured correctly it can still be a great part of the beer drinking experience. I still visit that little dive whenever I can just so I can re-visit what I have come to love about the beer and the experience it brings. Since then though, I have yet to have another pint of Guinness quite as good as from that place. If you want Guinness, make sure it is poured correctly, and let the atmosphere be part of the beer. You might even buy into the hype, even if it is for just one pint."
"Look, it's a fun beer. It's just not a monster beer by any means. I can sort of see why my buddy drinks it. The Draught is light on the palate, absolutely no bitterness can be found anywhere, and it comes in this sexy, cutesy-widget bottle. All of the elements are there for success. If you're new to stouts or want to get off of the lager/pilsner bandwagon, this is the beer for you."
"Drinkability  A session stout if there ever was one. Not the hardiest one youll ever put down, but good nevertheless with an above-average mouthfeel."
"Tasted like burnt coffee heh. Your average stout taste. Kinda bland when compared to other stouts. Not a very strong brew but very good otherwise. Would rather have an Extra Stout. I enjoy Sammy Smith brews more."
"I'll leave my review open for revision after I try some more of this beer...."
"A can 330ml nitro-can costs 5200 won ($4.50 US) in Korean supermarkets and somewhere in the 10,000 won ($11 US) range in pubs or restaurants. Can you believe that? And to think Koreans often call themselves the 'Irish of Asia'."
"Ahh Guinness, for better or for worse, THE standard in Stouts. I still think its a great looking pint, the light head on the dark brew, the lightness eminating from the dark as you set it down after taking a sip. Simply one of the best heads ever, which lends a beautiful look to the whole thing. Taste is good, very presentable to someone not familiar with Stouts or a soul that's intimidated by dark brews, but not something that would make one more familiar with various dark beers throw down thier pants and say Hallelujah. Some say its too filling or heavy, but don't beleive what you're told in that regard, I can certainly drink ten pints of this without feeling more full than I would after 160 oz. of any other good beer. The bottom line: its Guinness; everyone should drink bunches of it at some point, but its far from the end all of Stouts."
"Guinness in a bottle is like cheese cake in a squeeze tube, its still good, but just make you want the real thing. No aroma. For as cold as it is, it actually still has a lot of flavor. The design of the bottle is nice, so I guess it gets some appearance points for that. Tastes like Guinness, I guess. Ok in a pinch, but dont give up the nitro tap."
"Guinness draught is one of the reliable ones when it comes to beer. In those airport bars, chain hotels, etc. you can always be sure with this brew. There may be better beers out there but never forget your old friend or you'll grow old alone."
"Still the most beautiful working beer in existence, still has the wonderful creamy nitro mouthfeel, still has the most distinct first sip roasted malt taste,and a superior lace, but now I find its aroma sadly lacking and I notice that the wonderful malt taste seems to fade rapidly"
"Pours from the Genie bottle with the ""patented"" rich and ultra creamy Guinness head, all tanned and wonderful looking. The cascading head slowly changes to a near black liquid in the glass, with just a hint of redness when held directly in front of a light. The nose is a mix of burnt torrified barley, very light smoke, very light espresso and some bitter chocolate. Taste is smooth and very creamy due to the nitro bottles, with notes of highly roasted malts, chocolate, fleeting fruitiness, a wisp of smokiness, and non-denominational bitterness...probably more from the roasted barley than the hoppiness, which seems to be minimal here. Finishes up s - m - o - o - t - h and quite dry. End thought: a super drinkable Stout, goes down easy and is quite the tasty quaff!"
"It varies depending on where it's brewed. Predictably the Irish version is the best. It's a good fallback at parties in the UK, especially when your in-laws are Irish. However, I can't take more than 3 cans of this in a day."
"I do not understand you people who gave this beer a 5. A ""stout"" to be had out of the bottle. When pured into a glass, the color is fairly dark, but clear. When held up to the light you can see through its character. The smell is non-existent. Little hops, but thats it. The taste, well, was great during my beer chugging days. Very watery, very plain. Made to be drunk quickly, if at all. Not all too much to say about this beer. I may continue to entertain it on special occasions when others are having it, but not with pleasure."
"Other: Guinness is the elevator muzac of good beer. Let others trash it all they want, it's not really _that_ bad. It's just not exactly that good either. Still, it's a consistent product (I mean shit, the brewery practically invented quality control as a concept) and it's available at some pretty nice places. I can down a few, look like a manly kinda guy, and not wake up hung over in the morn. What's not to like?"
"Drinkability: A perrenial favorite that is the benchmark for most stouts worldwide."
"Bottom line, if it can be avoided do not drink the nitro bottle, go with draft."
"There are SO many better stout options that you'd be silly to limit yourself to this as a regular stout. Marketing is amazing, eh?"
"I didn't mind a Guinness but truth be told wasn't the biggest fan, until I left Australia. Guinness drinkers of OZ, we are being let down. I thought the stereotype of ""it tastes better in Ireland"" was one of those nationalistic calls that every country needs to make, until I went there. Sitting in the Sky Bar of the Guinness factory with a view over Dublin and a pint of the black, expertly poured, without the touristy shamrock was a great experience. All the true stout flavours and textures came through. A hint of coffee, that slighly burnt taste, a thick creamy texture and not too much gas as Australian so called ""stouts"" can have, and a head that lasted all the way to the bottom of the glass. The only way to truly enjoy this beer, in the country where it was made..."
"But let's not kid ourselves here, folks. Why not just drink from your toilet? Find a better Guinness."
"My first Guinness was a horrid bottled beer many years ago. Today's version with the ""widget"" delivering something resembling a hand-pulled mouthfeel is a great improvement. The Draught cans still have a somewhat fizzier head than a draft pull, but at least the head is creamy and plays well with the roasty beer body. Good smoked peat taste. Acidic, too. I've based my ratings on the pint ""pub draught"" cans that have been in my beer fridge for over two years now (one left), and it seems to have aged pretty well."
"I don't care how ""common"" this beer may be, I say it is perfect in appearance for the style. What other beer has that velveteen cream head in which you can make two eyes a nose and a smiley face in the head and still see it when your finished? The aromas are fine, while the nitrogen charged mouthfeel is one of the worlds great mouthfeels. It must be experienced! The taste is all guiness. A near perfect balance in all things beer. A lovely bitter and a dry style that I can let slither down my gullet all night. I can drink this, and have in a hot sweaty, crowded bar in the middle of August and find refreshment. I hear in Ireland that this beer is even more delicious. I'm half Irish and will one day discover this legend."
"If you want to talk appearance...this is a beer to be talking about. Its fun to just watch. The head is almost surreal as it forms. As a homebrewer it is baffling. The head is so creamy looking, off-white, small bubbled froth. It never disipates, it just follows the beer to the bottom of the glass until you feel its time to suck it down. Smell is chocolate but a mild smell all around. Not very strong. Definately not hoppy. Tastes of malt and chocolate and definately some coffee notes. The mouthfeel is so Creamy. Sort of chewy. I'm not a big Guiness drinker so I've got no Idea how the Ol' tummy handles it in larger quanities, but, I'd sure give it a try one night. Seems a little too creamy to try drinking it all night. But thats just me. A damn good beer"
"This wasn't very drinkable. I could substitute this with my meal because it is so thick."
"This is the nitro bottle version. Very smooth tasting almost creamy, a bit of roastiness. Overall very clean and not too exciting. Carbonation is very low, and in this beer makes it seem a bit too thin. Much better versions of Guiinness exist, the Belgian version is awesome."
"Very simple, but a pleasant beer to drink when the tap selection's limited. Very easy to drink, with enough flavor to keep you interested. A definitive beer."
"I wonder what it would be like if we got the original Irish recipe, draughting, and serving temperature..."
"Not bad, but I've always considered Guinness' most appealing element to be it's silk-like smoothness. This, of course, is from the nitrogen it's either kegged or bottled with. Otherwise, apart from it's appealing crispness, I've never found anything about this beer to write home about. Instead, I always find myself wondering what other beers would be like with a nitro tap..."
"The Guinness draught pours a jet black with the beautiful creamy off white head that lasts forever. One could go into a Zen like state watching the head cascade and form. The smell is of roasted malts and grains, with heavy coffee, and chocolate notes. The taste is similar with flavours of coffee, chocolate and caramel. There is some bitterness from the roasted malts, not so much from the hops. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with a touch of dryness at the backend..This is a great session beer as the low ABV keeps you from getting too loopy. But be careful, as too many of these in a night can do frightening things to your innards"
"Say what you will about nitrogen and it's effects on taste etc., but it's hard to find a better looking beer than this. Black in color with a head that looks like meringue. Cascading effects are very cool. Very smooth and velvety taste/mouth feel, kind of artificial. Lots of roasted malt flavors somewhat chewy in texture. Some lasting bitterness for the finish. Pretty damn good for coming out of the can."
"A true classic among beers, I was re aquanted with it tonight on tap at Dave&Busters. The bar tender even knew how to pour it correctly, I was shocked! Anyways, it poured that great dark black color with a great creamy head that stayed throughout the whole glass. It smelled of roasted coffee and chocolate and tasted pretty much the same. The mouthfeel was great and creamy and it really opened up once it hit your tounge with a bit of a tingle. I could have drank it all night, but at 4 bucks a pint glass my pocketbook was saying ""no"". This is one macro that still tastes fucking great!"
"This time, points get deducted because I can't see the damn beer. It's dark....I'll give it that. Aromas are still on the thin side. Some coffee, chocolate, and nuts. Taste was a little fuller than expected, but still nothing great, with the roasted coffee and chocolate trying to show some muscle but really not doing much of anything. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Drinkability suffers since I really enjoy the ""visuals"" associated with a well-poured Guinness. I'll still take a fresh pint over any botte, nitro-bottle, nitro-can, etc."
"Poured it from it's 330 ml nitro bottle straight into a Guinness pint glass (regulation size I think....). Good Golly Miss Molly, that is probably THE most beautiful pour I have ever witnessed from a bottle (or any other vessel). Same traditional Guinness pour, nitrogen cascade slowly leveling upwards in a shower of tan layers until only a black curtain remains, topped by a thick beige head that leaves a spiderweb network of lacing all the way down the pint glass. I am very impressed. Aroma of roasted malt and coffee, very inviting. Flavour to match as well, mouthfeel is thick and creamy, rich and satisfying. I could drink this all year. Guinness used to be my standard ever since I was legal, I used to swear by it. Over the years it became a bit too much of a pop culture phenomenon, passe, and I've drifted away due to this image and in search of different stouts. Still, it's wonderful to come home like this. If only all macros were brewed to this caliber. High volume consistency is an art form in itself when it comes to this sort of quality. I've always loved the extra stout, but when it comes to buying draught at the beer store, mine will now always come in bottles. Halelujah!"
"Dark black color, large creamy head, is there anything more pretty in beerland than a Guinness pour? Rich caramel malts, strong roasted malt flavor, nearly chocolate. A Guinness is a Guinness.. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. For a MASS produced craft beer, it a nice beer,"
"Nice and heavy mouthfeel. Very dense on the tongue. A crisp finish. I enjoy this stout from the tap. I do not like it from the can or the draught bottle. Waters the flavors down."
"Who can't like a Guinness? I mean really, can you be a beer drinker and not like the rich creamy lovliness of a Guinness? I'd have to say that all stouts should be judged from this one. Well, if you're not familiar with it, here comes my review. It pours a dark black - completely denying any light that tries to pass it through. The head is perfect (always): large, thick, creamy white head that will stick around until you're done with the beer. It leaves a nice bit of lacing on the glass too. The flavor is very rich and full. Mostly sweet coffee and chocolate in the flavor with some maltiness underneath. The aftertaste has the coffee/chocolate hint as well and leaves you with a milk mustache. Wonderful. The only thing that can even compare with this stout (that I've found) is the Young's Luxury Double Chocolate Stout."
"The aroma is of dry, peated malts. Hops are probably used in this beer, but its not apparent, either in aroma or flavor. Its affect are known though partly as a balance to the lactic sour. A sip is a nice experience, as it leaves a drip of foam on the mustache. Instantly dry feeling in the mouth as the smokey and peaty liquid moves through the mouth, the sour backend and dry mouth feel are almost one of a kind."
"The version of this you get in pubs is one of my favorite beers ever. That just makes what comes in the bottle an absolute dissapointment. I'll confess, I'd rather drink this than 2/3rds of the beers out there, but it falls so far short of the tap that you spend all your time wishing you were back at the pub. The drinker shouldn't be left wishing for more like that. If nothing better is available though, then by all means, drink it!"
"This sample from a can poured a small creamy head of fine light brown mostly lasting bubbles and an opaque dark brown colored body. It has a mild malt aroma and a mild coffee flavor with notes of chocolate with a mouthfeel that contains a slight lingering after bite."
"We all know the situation. You're in an irish style pub and look at the tap selection. Swill, swill, swill, ah, I'll have a guinness. Black in color with a creamy nitro head. Aroma is of roasted coffee. Taste is mostly coffee as well. Very drinkable, makes me wish it wasn't so overpriced. It doesn't come close to many other stouts out there, but due to its widespread availability, it's certaintly a blessing."
"ng"
"It pours brownish black with a massive waterfall of carbonation throughout the brew. Once this waterfall lets up, it's black with a thick,creamy white head. Aroma is on tons of bready malt, with some coffee and chocolate aromas. The taste actually reminds me of hard italian bread crust. There's a nice bitter finish with some coffee/chocolate notes. Mouthfeel is smooth & creamy, just excellent. The benchmark for stouts, and a great beer at that."
"Overall, a highly drinkable beer. I'd definitely be able to drink a few pints of this without thinking twice."
"This is somewhat like a Guinness Light. I have had a nitro-bottle of this before and the can far surpases the bottle. Altogether, not as flavorful or as bitter as Guinness Extra Stout, but perhaps a bit easier to drink."
"Can. When this beer was poured into my glass, it poured with a very long-lasting tan, creamy, thick head with small-medium sized bubbles. There was lacing on all sides of my glass. This stout has a strong coffee taste in my opinion and one that lingers."
"I would venture to guess that this is most people's entry point into stouts. I used to love this stuff, with its velvety mouthfeel and slight hints of peat in there, but since I've started expanding my horizons, I find that there are just so many better-tasting examples of a stout out there. I will, however, never turn a pint of this stuff down. It's an old friend...."
"Went out for lunch, the only beers available were from AB or the Guinness draught, I got the Guinness, it does have a nice appearance, black in color with a huge creamy tan head, weak roasty aroma, bland and weak flavor, it is thin and watery, yet has a creamy mouthfeel from the nitro, overall very bland and flavorless, not much going on here."
"I much prefer to drink Guinness on draft over a bottle any day. A nicely poured Guinness keeps it's look and taste all the way to the end. While this is a beer to enjoy while drinking it, I can easily find myself and a friend putting away a pitcher over the course of dinner."
"The taste, which reminded me of used motor oil on my first sip in 1988, is a smooth, but dark roasted malt with almost enough hops for the balance."
"Pours a beautiful black with a finger think layer of off-white/cream colored head. The sharp distinction between the head and the rest of the beer is part of what makes a Guinness so nice to look at in a glass (the wonderful cascade following pouring also contributes greatly to its attractiveness). The thick creamy head is very persistent (its there til the end), and sticks wherever it comes in contact with the glass. The smell is of roasted coffee with an oaky undertone. The taste is also of roasted malts with a coffee flavor. A bit of smokiness is also present. A very smooth and creamy mouthfeel leads to this being a rather drinkable beer."
"I buy regularly and drink when in the mood. My wife is not a beer drinker, but loves this stuff. The Stout standard."
"Even though I tried both guinness and bass tonight, I didn't get to try a black and tan. I had this in a 16oz. glass on nitro tap. I was a little pissed off when the bartender didn't do a two part pour. It took forever to settle. The people of Guinness would not be happy if they saw this guy's aweful pours. Nevertheless, it pours a deep brown changing to black as it settles with a creamy white head. There is awesome head retention and lots of lacing. The smell has a roasted coffee aroma to it. The taste is a little bit of coffee with burnt malt. There isn't much hops noticeable. The mouthfeel is a little light due to the nitro. The drinkability is very good at 4.1%. This is offered almost anywhere and is good to fall back on."
"Noticeable roasted grain taste, heavier than normal mouthfeel, but not overwhelming in flavor, bite, alcohol. The nitro effect certainly softens up the mouthfeel as you would expect, I would like to try this in another format beside nitro bottle. Just a slight hop feel at the end, keeping in step with the malt level. Taste-wise, it's not over the top, but it *is* most tasty and a very drinkable beer."
"The legend. It pours pitch black with a decent creamy head. Head dies down a bit but a nice float remains which laces the glas just beautifully. smells of malt and a nice roasted scent but nothing stong. the taste is a mild roasted malt flavour with a hint of coffee and the mouthfeel is a lovely creamy texture that coats your mouth. The drinkability as far as taste goes is great, but they do ten to fill you up a bit. I also love them floated over a nice cider or brown ale. I've had them in the nitro cans also which were pretty good (not as good as beamish) and the bottles which i felt were very un-impressive (way to watered down). on tap is the only way to have it."
"A big change this beer has taken me on. Radical, because the first time i brought this stout from the states, in a can, I was seriously disappointed (like 1.0 disappointed). In a recent trip to North Ireland I gave myself a second chance on this stout. On tap, canned, etc. And It was, comparatively, fabulous. I underrated it the first time or did not have the palate for it, but for some reason it just tasted better- the range of flavours, the temperature, the pour- in NI. I became somewhat appreciative of it and, in spite of this lowering when retrying it in Paris, I keep a decent regard to it now, and change my opinion."
"The pour is just part of the experience, watching that wave of tan rising to the top of the glass. Beer itself is a very dark RED. If you don't believe me hold it up to a very strong light. Very subtle flavors of coffee and chocolate. I feel that this is a very under-rated and malinged beer. The ""widget"" can gives it almost an identical flavor to draught. I haven't tried the widget bottle, I can't bring myself to drinking it that way. Absolutely Genius!"
"The texture of nitro dispensed beers makes me a bit queasy, but that's just me. I'd drink two if there was nothing else, and I really wanted a beer - otherwise I'd be scoping the bourbons and whiskies on offer."
"Drinkability/notes: Quite nice, I prefer Guinness Extra Stout, but this is better than most of the beer to be had in this world."
"I acknowledge that I was drinking a nitro bottle, a fantasy, an illusion, a reflection of reality. This isn't a kind review but I am not giving up on Guinness. I am going to try it in all its incarnations before I chuck it. But with all the flavorful stouts out there, we're near the end of the line."
"Taste is fantastic, a complex taste that does not leave a bitter aftertaste that is often common with American made stouts. Some have compared the consistency of this brew to motor oil, but I disagree. Since this is a nitro mixture the beer is light, smooth and goes down easy."
"If money is not an issue, you can't go wrong with Guinnes."
"HOWEVER, the only reason it should be so famous is because the brewery has such an interesting history."
"Argue if you like but I think Guiness Draught on tap pours one of the prettiest pints in all of beerdom. Smell is weak though-light notes of roasted malt there. Taste is the same with a delicate blend of hops and chocolates. Relatively watery finish but body is moderate to slightly heavy. The greatest aspect of Guiness is its availability. With few exceptions you can find it where ever you go and have a half decent beer."
"Slainte!!!"
"If it's in a bottle or can it's not a draught...simple. Really dark with red/amberish tint. An earthy malty and peat aroma blends with tea and hops. The heavy extra roasted malt is smoky and thick. Highly hopped with tea-like and metallic bitterness. Strong coffee and a hint of molasses and a trace of camphor round out the flavors. A taste of earthy peat is omni-present. Fantastic beige/tan creamy/frothy head. An Original! But, somehow not as dark or bitter as I remember..."
"It took me a while to understand the supreme appeal of Draught Guinness, for the Extra Stout was my bottle of choice in early days. I did a taste test between the two, and ultimately found that the draught version resembles a chocolate milkshake, or a mocha latte. It's for people who want to go beyond fizzy lagers and such, but don't really want to approach the bold flavors and bitterness in a true stout or porter."
"Served black in appearance with a thick creamy light tan head that stays throughout consumption. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and creamy. Serving temperature was cool. Aroma consisted of roasted malt, coffee and chocolate. Roasted malt and coffee flavors dominate the palate. Dry bitterness lingers in the finish. Guinness on draught is still my number one preference when compared to the nitro can or bottle."
"Very nice presentation from the nitro bottle. Pours the cascading style that Guinness prefers to porvide. Very dark appearance with a great big, tan head. Good lacing. The taste is vintage Guinness with the kind of mid bitterness and creaminess that is well known. A godd beer that is a go-to when only macros are the alternative. Smell is not as robust as from the tap."
"I was told to drink right from the bottle, and I did so. Taste is very chocolate in nature. Somewhat malty, a little less so than the original. I thought I was tasting cocoa at first. Very watered down. The carbonation was pronounced, making it easy to drink. A pretty smooth ""stout""."
"stouts."
":-)"
"No where close to on tap. That being said, not too bad. Pours pitch black with a creamy tan head. Not too much going on in the nose. Some roasted malts and caramel, but very faint. Taste is not too bad for a nitro can. Usually they are very metallic tasting - particularly for pub ales, but this didn't real have that quality. Still, not too much flavor. Roasted malts, coffee, and faint chocolate. Silky-smooth mouth feel, medium bodied. Great drinkability due to low abv and low calories. All in all not bad, but I'm starting to get tired of these nitro cans."
"Utterly revolting, thin, lightly roasty body meets with rancid bitterness, body is smooth and watery, not really a good example of a stout, although i'm sure once upon a time it was. It has a nice appearance though (deep black colour, with a nice creamy head). But besides that, this is easily the most overated beer on this site and on earth for that matter. Cat piss and vomit in one, the Budweiser of Stouts, gives stouts a bad name."
"happy st. patrick's day!"
"Proper suspended carbonation, slowly cascading nitro creaminess with a solid hold of the upper head at 3/4 of an inch. Medium dark brown and clearish at the bottom. Slightly yeasty aroma, some sense3 of clotted cream. Milky mouthfeel, mocha java flavors, and a sudued sense of oily bitterness. More roast at the close. Somewhat surprisingly, this hit the spot better than I expected but there are definitely dryer versions of the Irish style. Happy St. Pat's Day..."
"Reviewed this on tap, now reviewed on can. Ugh, terrible when compared too nitro tap. Dark red/black colour when poured, with the fluffy cloud head I adore. Smell was similar too burnt toast. Some coffee, roasted malt, something sweet I couldn't put my nose too. Tasted boring. BTW, all 4 cans are gone. Unless I got 4 bad cans, this is an accurate review. Coffee, toffee, chocolate and more sweet malt, but not as much as from the cask. Terrible mouthfeel. Gritty. Like their was sand in my mug. Or sugar. Yes, it was a clean mug. Because of the gritty mouthfeel, it wasn't very drinkable. Very good on tap, not good from can. I'll try it from the bottle, for no other reason than too collect the cap. An overrated stout. Lacked the silk feeling I got from the cask, which was my biggest dissapointment."
"Taste: Slight bitterness after the swallow. Thats the only thing separating this beer from chocolate milk, well, also without any of the heaviness associated with milk. This is a beer you can drink and drink, so it's my Wednesday night drink of choice. Join us at the Half Door if you'd like. We'll be in a booth in the back."
"Pour is beautiful - black with a thick creamy tan head that just hovers on top, leaving thick lacing all the way to the bottom of the pint. Aroma is very light, mostly roasted and bitter coffee and chocolate. Flavor has the same hints of roasted coffee and bitter chocolate. Mouthfeel and smooth and creamy, probably greatly aided by the nitro."
"Looks good. The best low cal brew on the market for sure. I dig this as a alf and half with Woodchuck Granny Smith hard cider, but it is also quite good on its own... It feels very creamy going down. Tastes good, but it is a bit too light to have the taste that we would want it to have. Perhaps a bit more like the extra stout, but we can't have it all."
"Great looking beer, great head, good flavor. Best part about it is you can get it almost everywhere.Bad part is few sellers can pour a decent pint. Good beer if served correctly. Low ABV makes drinking it like pushing a rock up a hill, just keeps getting harder and harder till your too tired to lift an arm. Pass me a straw and some Whiskey please."
"Kinda' dull aroma, but better than most nitro-cans. Ends up being slightly sweet water quality with a bit of dark malt. Rock steady head after the show. Black with red tints. Good looking beer. Nitro can flavor, similar to all others. Malty bitterness, not unpleasant or excessive. Dark malt. Long bitter finish. Well balanced mouthfeel, a little thin but flatter carbonation (which I like). Very smooth. Good versatile beer."
"I reviewed this from a nitro bottle and I poured it into a glass even thought it says to enjoy it from the bottle. I love the look of Guinness, I couldn't resist. It still tasted pretty much like I remember it from the nitro can. An awesome looking brew with a thick creamy head that never dissipates. The nose is of roasted malts and a hint of chocolate. The taste is similiar with roasted malts up front followed by chocolate and a slightly bitter finish. The mouthfeel is super smooth, but personally I like at least some carbonation. I could probably go with guinness as a session beer but it wouldn't be my first choice."
"Some places serve this too cold. Don't be afraid to let it sit and warm-up. This is often one of the only decent beers a nonbeer bar or chain will have. Enjoy!"
"Pours a dark blackish brown and give off to the famous thick tan head that Guinness is known for. I love to watch the beer turn tan as the carbonation boils and turns to the head. The head slowly left leaving a thin lace behind. Roasted malts come to mind with a hint of coffee as you intake the aroma. The taste goes with the aroma, roasted malts and a slight bitter finish. I enjoy Guinness, even more from draft and will use this as my base line for other Stouts of this kind. Try it you will like it!"
"The best out of a Nitro tap. It should take the bar tenderat least five minutes to poor this one with a couple settling pauses in order to get the glass full. If it is with you in 40 seconds beware. Guiness has made great advances in its Nitro can and bottling methods but stick with the tap on this one, it is the only way to go."
"Pours a black colour topped by a thick creamy tanned head that does not settle until the last sip. Flavour and aroma consist of coffee, chocolate and toffee hints. Mouthfeel is quite thick. Drinkability is a bit poor since it's a bit heavy on the stomach. I actually enjoy pouring this beer from a nitro can rather than being served from tap."
"i can drink this like milk..very very nice will buy more of this."
"I love hearing the pop and fizz when the can is opened as the nitrogen widget mixes with the beer. When poured into a glass the upward cascade of bubbles is a wonder to behold. The contrast of the black color of the beer and the ivory foam head scores highly with me. Guinness has a wonderful thick velvety mouth feel, nice creamy ivory colored foam head that remains on top of the beer while you drink it, and a well balanced flavor of sweet malts and bitter hops. The taste is somewhat dry, bitter, and a mixture of coffee and chocolate. I thought the aroma was rather ""bready"" which did not seem normal to me. Overall, the pub cans are my favorite way to enjoy Guinness at home."
"The color was very dark and had a nice white head sitting upon a sea of white bubbles in dark beer. The head lasted a long time and the malty sweetness lasted throughout two LARGE draugts. The liquid clung to the tongue and finished with a dryness. The bite of the beer still clings to my tongue. It is by far my favorte beer when going to a bar that serves mainly mainstream beers."
"This beer is beautiful. The reverse cascading is like a piece of live art. The head was thick(probably a little too, but it settled pretty well) and looked like a milkshake. The smell had some nice roasted overtones, but the first taste was a little disappointing without the complexity I was expecting. It was not at all bitter and left a nice taste in mouth. Over all a good beer, deserved of its reputation."
"So much better the the Nitro swell of theirs. This poured a black color with a brown head of foam. The smell was not overly pleasant to me, but, I not a stout fan. The taste was average and the bitterness overpowed my taste buds. I am not impressed with this beer and will never drink it again!"
"The reverse cascading head is the coolest thing about this beer, it does make for a great presentation. I just don't get why the bottle says to serve very cold and drink from the bottle. Those who do ruin both the taste and the visual experience. Aromas of deep roasted chocolate malts. Taste is shallow, but in line with the aroma. Medium mouthfeel with little carbonation."
"the flavor was lacking. it was not as rich and roasty as had wanted it to be. it still had a good coffee flavor. the creaminess was right on as you would imagine. it was very smooth and almost no carbonation. i wanted a nice full-flavored rich beer, and i did not get it."
"Pours almost black in color with a thick and creamy tan colored sticky head that lasts to the end. Nose is roasted malts and grains with some notes of dark coffee. Taste is burnt coffee and very bitter chocolate. Very smooth and creamy in the mouth and yet quite crisp as well. So much better than the bottled version."
"Guinness Draught from a ""nitro bottle"" is a different animal than its nitro can and on-tap cousins. It is still a decent drink, but it is noticeably more bitter. This is perhaps intentional as this serving type is meant to be drunk from the bottle. A rather odd way to drink a stout, but it does mean that Guinness can now be sold at places that prefer to deal with bottles only (e.g., it has become popular in Las Vegas casinos). The mouthfeel and taste both suffer a bit in this version. The drinkability is still good, and this is still a pretty smooth beer."
"The taste starts with a thick maltiness and finishes with a very dry bitterness. The aftertaste has some notes of coffee and carmel with a hint of chocolate but is overpowered by the black malt bitterness. Not a whole lot more to it. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth like a thin mousse. Not bad for something brewed by Labatt. For me Guinness Draught is a, ""so you don't have anything else beer", or a lite beer (4.1%). I have had much worse and I have had some better."
"Although I recognize the shortcomings of this beer, it remains one of my favorite stand-bys. The appearance of a well poured Guinness is really a thing behold with it dark brown color(near black color). A Guinness head should really be the standard for all stouts, brown, creamy, pillowy soft ---- Perfect. Unfortunately, the taste of Guinness does not match its presentation, it is a rather bland stout. It is good but not great, with coffee being the only real flavor I can discern. The mouthfeel is thin for a stout, but overall the brew is highly drinkable with a low ABV. I love it.... and can see its flaws, but it remains a favorite."
"overall, one of my favorites that is consistant and available."
"Dark brown-almost black in color. Thick creamy tan head that takes forever to settle. Best looking beer ever. The beer itself is thick and it actually has a hint of coffe flavor.Tastewise, IMO it is the best beer made by a large company. However, I have actually tasted better micro stouts. My only complaint is that after 2 I'm done. 2 fills you up like you just ate a meal."
"I'm a sucker for the Guinness cascade, though the appearance of this beer is great even just based on its midnight darkness and bronze head. Smell is relatively muted, though some of the smoothness and roastiness comes through. Taste is good but not exceptional, highlighted by roasted choco-coffee flavors and a nice sweetness that is a big part of this beer's impressive drinkability."
"Honestly, I do not often drink stout beers. I am just not a big fan of the style, but this one definitely makes me have second thoughts. It pours from the bottle with a nice dark creamy color. In the glass it is very dark with hints of dark ruby coloring, if the light hits it right, and has an excellent thick creamy head that does not go anywhere until you start drinking. The smell is mostly cocoa with light hints of coffee and with hops right on top. The taste is also chocolatey with a superb combination of roasted malts. This brew is smooth in the mouth and goes down even smoother. The drinkability is good even though I am not a big fan of drinking more than one of these at a time, but that is just personal preference. Overall, this is an excellent beer and I would recommend it to anyone who has not yet tried it."
"While there are many stouts out there now that put Guinness (any version) to shame, it's still a classic worth re-visiting over and over... If you're going to drink one, do it right and get it straight from the tap."
"Yuk.....sorry but there it is, not a fan of this style, not a fan of this brew...once said I have never met a beer I didn't like...now I have, I am depressed....Oh well, somebody pass me a Aschi Super Dry...please!!!!"
"Amazing cascading effect that leads to a pitch black beer with a tannish creamy head that clings to sides of the glass. Sweetish malt aroma with a silky smooth taste that so easy to drink."
"Slightly different from can to tap. When poured it has a nice dark opaque color that is dark brown/black. The head is not quite like the tap but not bad. It has a creamy tan/beige color to it. The aroma is lighter. Hints of coffee, malt and light hops. The flavor is creamy with flavors of roasted malt and coffee. I believe when making a black and tan at home, the flavors of the can of this Guinness meld pretty well with the other beer to give a quality drink."
"A tried it straight out of the bottle(recommended) and in the glass. I liked it MUCH better out of the glass. Pours a beautiful, creamy brown head that stays throught the whole drink. I like Guiness Extra Stout better, but this is a very good beer overall. One of the better stouts."
"A wonderfull beverage, and one that can be drank all night long. Crisp and dry with a wonderfull smooth mouthfell and the sharp coffee bite of roast malt. When served right this beer is just dangerous, you can finish a pint without knowing it."
"Well, as it says to drink directly from the bottle? I tried it that way, quite cold, and another cold but allowed to rest in my pint Guinness glass I snatched from St. James Gate in Ireland, I still like it better in the glass. Pours the color all beer should be ""Dark", black if you prefer, wonderful creamy head, tons of lace, and that distinctive ""Guinness"" nose, roasted and toasted malt with hints of chocolate. Start is malt sweet, medium middle, dry finish with a nice hop presence, basically no carbonation, smooth and creamy rich. , not as good as getting a pint at the ""Gate", but quite drinkable nonetheless."
"It doesn't matter if you like this beer or not, you have to admit that the appearance it amazing.  Thick, creamy head balanced perfectly on top of a solid black body.  Not my favorite Stout and it bothers me a bit that it isn't brewed in Ireland.  Kind of watery and not big on flavor.  I have yet to try this in Ireland but I hear that it is different tasting.  It is a great expereince to go to an Irish Pub in Boston in the afternoon and enjoy."
"It doesn't get any better than Guinness in my book. Dark, creamy, tasty. I love the nitrogen bubbles too. Amazingly it is lighter than many lights that are on the market while still being delicious. It's a masterpiece, a benchmark for all other beers to rate themselves according to."
"Damn fine stout, a globally good drink.Canned version is a good imintation of the tap stout."
"Overall, not a bad beer. I'm glad I tried it from the nitro bottle. If the time was right I may even purchase it again."
"Its black. The head is tan/white. The smell is almost non-existent (some oily coffee beans and milk.) The taste is of sour, roasted, burned grain, water and soy milk. The texture is creamy. The drinkability is excellent (you can drink many.) Enjoy!"
"Had to try the plastic bottle with the widget. Not disappointed, because I had no exspectations. I don't know what the widget does but take up space. The Guinnness tasted very watered down, and it seemed there was barely any in the bottle. I think they should end this ""sham", they aren't fooling anyone."
"If you want a Guinness that will challenge your tastebuds, try the Extra Stout."
"The Highest Mark I will ever give a Canned Beer !!"
"While the nitro widget produces a wonderful looking head that resembles nitro-draught, the overall flavor of this beer seems a little simple. It is exceptionally creamy and drinks easily, but doesn't have the great flavour profile of the extra-stout. However, I have yet to experience any variation in quality as I sometimes do with the extra stout. A good substitute for real draught."
"Just not a fan of this one.  I picked this at a Mongolian restaraunt because the only other non-macro choice they had was Kirin's Lager.  Poured a black coffee like color with a VERY cream tan head.  Looks pretty nice.  Smells of roasted malt with a little caramel.  The taste is overwhelmed with the nitro creamy mouthfeel that just doesn't go well with this almost bland stout.  The flavor has light hints of coffe and burnt chocolate and then there is that creamy aftertaste too.  Middle of the road at best.  Cheers!"
"Pours black with a thick light tan head that lasts and lasts. Wonderful cake-like lace clings all the way down. Wonderful cascading as you wait for the head to form. This is what appearance is all about, makes my mouth water. Creamy mouthfeel, roasted flavors with hints of coffee. Finishes with some hops to balance and a little dryness. Highly drinkable, difficult to savor as it begs to go down all at once. great beer."
"What can I say that hasn't been said before. This is simply an excelent beer. Guinness blends the perfect melody of bitter and creamy. It goes down easy and fast. If all of life was like a nice cold Guinness."
"Opaque black with a thick light tan head; I never get tired of watching the cascading as it's being poured and while it sits waiting for the head to form. No beer I've ever had has a creamier mouthfeel. Roasted flavors with notes of coffee. Couldn't ask for a more drinkable beer, never mind a more drinkable stout. I know that by true beer experts' standards (and I ain't hardly a beer expert yet) this is a fairly pedestrian stout, but I always enjoy it."
"Excellent session brew since it has a lower alchohol content than a lot of other beers. Nice tight creamy tan head leaves lace all the way down the glass. Lighter body than what you would expect based upon the color. Almost black in color. Accents of smokiness come through in the taste.  An enjoyable beer, and entertaining to watch as it cascades after the pour."
"Nice striking contrast: perfect pitch dark beer with creamy soft and smooth head, cascading nitro effect similar to hand-pulled beer.  For a non-draft beer, it looks perfect.  Little to no noticeable aroma at first but warms to a faint roasted sour scent.  Taste is creamy but light, surprising those expecting a heavy beer. Unmalted barley taste evident and with slight sourness, finished with nice roasted taste. For a canned beer, I do not see how it can get any better....a session beer unlike any other."
"Okay, this beer arrived a very dark brownish black color nd formed an off white head with little lace.  It had an aroma malt, smoke and chocolate.  The flavor was of malt and chocolate.  The body was creamy and the finsh was chocolate with some smoke present."
"The thing which stands out to me about Guiness is the way it looks.  The head is so majestic, and the beer is opaque and dark as night.  Unfortuanely the beer doesn't smell or taste quite as good as some other stouts.  It's a creamy and full bodied beer, with a nice roasted malt aroma and flavor, and a nice upfront bite, but I find there to be a slightly unpleasant astringent aftertaste.   And with it's low alcohol content, it's too filling to drink very much of it."
"A good on-deck beer if it is not available on draft. I can't get enough of the widgets! The major downside is there is a rather small window between too warm and too cold. It is also a little thinner than the draft offering."
"The first time I had this, I was in my ""quantity not quality"" phase.  Drinking Bush and Bud at the time, I did not appreciate or enjoy it.  Now ordering it is a joy.  It poured with a thick off-white head and dark brown/near black color.  There was a nice malty aroma.  The first roasty flavored drink left excellent lacing.  This is an excellent choice when the other options are the macros.  I enjoy it even though it is not my style of choice."
"One of the best beers in the world, yet still an acquired taste. It is dark at the pour with no visability through it. The head is thick and apparent throughout the glass. Guinness' aroma is high with a coffee and dark chocolate tinge. From the first sip, this stout is satisfying and very much of a knife-and-fork mentality. A true beer fan must try this classic. I know it is rare for someone to give this brew a ""5," especially someone who has tried as alot of different brews. But I cannot lie. This is my favorite. When I go to my favorite haunt, I get great pleasure from watching a PROFESSIONAL tap me a quality pint, the proper way. In my mind. It is THE beer in my book. Bottoms Up!"
"While the stout style is not my favorite, I do enjoy a good one occasionaly.  The appearance of Guiness as always is as always exceptional.  Not for the novice beer drinker, your typical mass produced drinker needs to work their way to this one.  Of course alot of the appeal has to do with the pour, a bartender that doesn't know what he/she is doing can ruin this beer.  If your half irish like I am you can't help but love Guiness, I tend to want to drink it when listening to a U2 cd......CHEERS"
"On tap...Jensen Beach Ale House....The best beer served at my local bar. Nice deep dark color, thick, bubbly tan head. I love the cascading effect. Nice coffee, faint chocolate smells. Taste is creamy, silky smooth. Noticable chocolate malt, slight creamy sweetness. When fresh and poured properly is one of the best mass produced beers available. Noticably better on tap, than the bottle widget."
"Strange pour, but does settle like a nirto-can and does create the beautiful beige 1/4 inch head.  Opeque black/tan color.  It is not as good as the can or draught but it is still guinness.  I am not letting the other guinness products cloud my judgement... it is above average in comparison to the style and other Stouts.  I don't know why they reccomed to serve ""very cold"" or tell you to actually ""drink it from the bottle""?  The smooth roast malt flavor is still there though...  The brew also seems slightly thinner than the can or draught versions.  It is much superior to the regular bottle version!"
"44"
"Here's the nitro can perspective on Guinness: It suffers in the can. Perhaps it has something to do with the packaging methods. The canned product says that it is pasteurized, which can affect flavor adversely. Secondly, when tasted side by side with the Beamish nitro can stout, it tastes harsher and less appealing than Beamish ."
"A properly poured Guinness is really tough to beat. It's got that beautiful dark brown, almost black color, and that one of a kind head that makes you want to dig in with a spoon. The flavor is complex yet understated and subtle. It's rich and creamy and goes down with a silky perfection. Just the thought of it makes me want to run to the nearest pub."
"Beautifully thick, dense tan head as expected.  Intricate lace is left down the glass.  Deep garnet hue and very clear when held to a light.  Typically attractive for Guinness.  Malt notes are mild in aroma and are comprised of a hint of sharp, dark roasted barley sharpness, and a hint of chocolate malt. Light diacetyl comes through as the beer warms.  Roasted grain bitterness dominates the flavor, while hop bitterness seems to be more subdued when compared to draught Guinness.  Typically smooth nitro/CO2 mix induced mouthfeel.  The finish is soft, w/ less residual roasted grain bitterness than the draught version.  It's an okay dry stout, but even canned Guinness seems to have more character."
"Everyone knows Guinness so I won't get too detailed.  Guinness is my default beer when having quests as it is usually amenable to all.  Dark black with an o' so creamy head. Nice roasted character.  A very good beer, especially considering the volume it is produced in."
"Dark brown/black. Thick head. Cascading bubbles is a sight to see. Smooth and dry with a slight bitter finish.  A hint of dark toasted malts.  Not quite as complex as I'd like, but maybe its just the lack of traditional carbonation that freaks me out."
"In each country the beer varies a bit to meet the local tastes but the American version is deep black in color, with a dense tan head of foam that lasts until the bottom of the glass. This stout also features a surprisingly fruity aroma amidst the massive roasted malt nose. Deep, rich, and bitter with tinges of sourness and flavors of dark roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and malt. The version in the draught-can is somewhat thinner in body and less fruity and therefore more drinkable."
"I had a Guinness on tap after a round of golf this week.  I couldn't believe how disappointed I was.  This brewery gets credits for its longevity and ingenuity. The beer has few flaws, but its boring.  It simply isn't an interesting brew.  The nitrogen-induced head is a gimmick, and the character has been dumbed down for Budweiser tastes.  Go for the extra stout bottle if you insist on Guinness.  Or, better yet, go for a local or regional craft stout."
"I can drink it endlessly... That's why I always buy not more than 3 cans a time :)"
"What can i say about guinness that hasn't already been said, cascades, coffee, chocolate. The only bad thing about guinness in my mind is that it goes down a little too easy."
"I didn't try it before last night, because there's just something wrong with drinking from the bottle.  You don't get to see the beer.  You miss out on 99% of the aroma...It's just plain barbaric.  So, yeah this is a tough beer to rate.  Couldn't see it, couldn't really smell it.  It tasted OK, but compared to the Guinness I had off-the-tap earlier in the evening, it was rather lacking.  (1, 1.5, 3.5, 3, 2.5)"
"It's ~different~ compared to on-tap but I find it much better than the nitro-can. I'm suprised by the poor reviews. Let it infuse for a minute or two before your first sip."
"Guinness is definitely an acquired taste, as are many darker beers. Being that it is everywhere, I finally got the palate for it, and now it seems like a very light beer in comparison to many. The appearance, when poured correctly, is pure perfection. It's like a painting. Smooth as any beer you can find, creamy, with mild bitter notes of chocolate and roasted malt. After a few is rather filling, but I would not say it is a heavy beer at all. Finally have sampled Guinness in Ireland, and I don't know if it's the atmosphere of that beautiful country or the wonderful pubs and people, but Guinness is one of the most enjoyable things in Ireland, more than anywhere else. Not the most flavorful of stouts by any stretch of the imagination, but a classic in its own right."
"What's next?  Guinness 40's?"
"A strong, black, smooth but dry stout.  I'm not quite sure how much value the plastic widget adds but it tastes just exactly like every Guinness I have had."
"Quite frankly, I think Guinness is overrated. Don't get me wrong, it's a good beer, very much above average, but if I have the choice of the two  I'll take Beamish. It's still a good stout, but if you stick it next to a Shakespeare Stout, it's no contest. Still, Guinness is a good measuring stick for the style since (at least from what I read on this site) it was the first stout as Guinness wandered deeper into the black as their porter transformed into the first stout."
"The true pub classic. I have spent more time studying this beer than any other. I judge local pubs on how well they draw the pint, and spent two days in Dublin comparing the pint at the Guinness brewery to its competitors. This is the only beer I know that can be a 3 (due primarily to disappointment) at one establishment and the perfect 5 at another. Find the best pub (measured solely in terms of how well they pour the pint) and never leave."
"not a big Guiness fan anyway,  the bottle looks cool,  the beer is predictable,  rather have one on tap if it is the only good beer on,,,  but if someone had these in their fridge or bud,,,I take the guiness"
"The flavor may vary slightly from tap to tap, but Guinness is pretty much equal to all the big name stout's... ""a classic"".  Overall a very good session brew. Some places do serve it ice cold and knocks off the flavor a bit, but an good brew none-the-less."
"I enjoyed Guinness Draught from the bottle.  Sure, you miss the show in the glass that you get from the tap or the can, but it has that unmistakable Guinness taste.  I guess messing with tradition is a problem for some, but not me.  I liked the convenience of it.  While I will opt for the draft or can first, this version is fine."
"This beer is all in the head.  Although it looks like Guinness and does taste like Guinness, it is really just above OK.  I like to have one once in while when I am unable to get to a pub.  It serves the cravings.  I noticed lately that is too cold out of the can and you really don't get the flavor or bitterness  of the original.  Still enjoyable."
"bleach.  The can was a good idea and was a decent substitute for the pub pour if you were absolutely jonesing for a Guinness.  The bottle is just a abomination.  To get it to work all the beer flavor was sacrificed leaving a pallid, artificial tasting black, alcoholic liquid.  Guinness has gone too far this time.  In an attempt to garner even more of the market it is giving its flagship beer a black eye.  Part of the beauty of a pint of Guinness is in the pour, the cascade and that fact that you're in a pub.  Now with this bottle shit you can sit on the couch in your your underwear drinking Guinness as you would a bud light.  Shame on them."
"I've never felt that this comes close to the draft experience.  The beer always ends up almost completely flat.  Taste-wise, it's got the nice roasted flavor with a slight sourness but the creaminess is also lacking in the can."
"Guinness, why are you wasting my time with this gimmicky crap? Oh yeah, because there are far more idiots who drink beer than there are true beer lovers, and you want to tap into that market. Sellout, I say."
"One of my absolute favorites.  The first stout I ever tried and I am still in love with the style.  There is just something about watching the smooth cascade after the beer is poured.  Smooth mouthfeel and all the way down too.  A definite session beer."
"There is nothing more drinkable than Guinness. roasted coffee with almond flavours and a two inch thick head that stays right till the end. mmm mmmm..."
"Beautiful in it's appearance, and a welcoming texture on the tongue.  Smokey/burnt like essense.  Smells like a bouquet of flowers and hops.  Choice."
"Guinness on tap rules."
"Not my first choice in stouts. A good fall back since it's available most everywhere."
"If nothing else, you've got to credit this beer as one of the great first-steps for a lot of people looking to expand their beer-drinking horizons beyond the basic mega-brew lagers.  Mild enough so that it does not scare them off.  Not my favorite Irish dry stout, but a pint of Guinness is always like meeting an old friend."
"Ok, Guinness Draught is not my favorite but here is why it got the score that it did. Appearance: it got a 2 because you can't see it. This is made spacifically to drink out of the bottle which is shrink wrapped so you can not see the beer at all. The smell and tast are good for the style but this ""Draught"" stuff is just too thin. By beer rep said they poured it out into glasses to test it and it came out flat so drink it out of the bottle or not at all."
"a beautiful beer to look at, and nice to drink too, plus, of course, the added benefit of being the better half of the best looking drink of all, the black and tan."
"One word for this brew... thin. This is THE beer for fools that want you to know ""I drink an import, I'm sophisticated."" .  I'll buy my 6'er of Extra for $7, you buy you 4pk of Draught for $8."
"Notes: What can I say? It's not the most remarkable Stout that I've ever had. It's not very exciting compared to its siblings (yes, even on tap in Ireland). Apart from ""Guinness"" (the tap version) this is Guinness' top selling beer, and the most consistent as it's all too easy these days to get an inconsistent poured pint of Guinness. Personally I enjoy and appreciate the Extra Stout and Foreign Extra Stout 10 times more, but you'll find me slumming it on occasion. A mediocre beer."
