3.09,-13.9,3.5,3.25,3,3,3,"below the increasing quality of recent saranac beers this one, a thin and slightly off irish stout, not as dry as it should be, lacking any meaty body, and frankly just not all that appealing. lighter brown for the style, more of a brown ale really or a light porter than a true irish stout in looks. and the flavor is similarly watered down, the body is real thin, and there is a peculiar metallic bitterness all the way through it. i may be a little biased as this was my last beer in an evening of several world class ones, but i was still let down by this seemingly lazy offering. anyone who sips this notices inadequacies right away, namely the lack of body, but also the longer semi sweet finish, the minimal carbonation, and the partially oxidized taste in the finish. saranac has really been coming out with some top notch stuff lately, inventive and well executed, but this is the worst ive had from them in some time, and is probably at least part of the reason true beer geeks keep bashing this brand. barely passable as the style it proclaims to be, just a bit better as a dark ale, but not one i need to try again for awhile.","StonedTrippin","Jun 04, 2014"

Brilliant lacing and better-than-very-good head retention. ""Black"" body, dark tan head. Aroma: roast. beer. slightly nutty. I'm getting more out of it than Guinness. Flavor: similar to aroma. some twang. minor maltiness. balanced bitterness. surprisingly well put together. no flaws, other than the fact that the style itself isn't exactly ""rounded"" or ""balanced"". Finishes dry and subtly tangy and roasty. Overall, impressive. There are a lot of breweries that have taken a stab at the style, and many have missed the mark - not Saranac.","NeroFiddled","Apr 17, 2014"

The taste is basically the same in the roasted department, but adds a piney bitterness to it. Also, interestingly enough, the drink is dry, but it's also slightly watery.

Aromas of mocha coffee, with a slight sugary ribbon to the chocolate character, and a touch of earthy characteristics. Flavors of roast and char initially, with a slick, bitter coffee backbone quickly following. Some bitter chocolate highlights, but not as much as the nose would lead you to believe. Aftertaste is rich chocolate and coffee, with a strong bitter undertone. Light, dry body with a slick, quick finish. True to the style, but a little more chocolatey and rich than you may be used to.

4.17,16.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"O: This beer has two things working against it coming out of the gate: First, it's an Irish Dry stout, a style of beer that most Americans don't seem to understand or appreciate. Second, it's brewed by Saranac, a brewery that doesn't get a lot of love and has a reputation in the craft world for underachieving and making mediocre beer. For these reasons, I don't expect it to get a lot of love. That would be a damn shame though, because this is an excellent beer. In fact, this is one of the best examples of the style I've had to date. Attractive mouthfeel, highly drinkable, very tasty and textbook for the style; it's everything you could ever want. A case might be in order next St. Patrick's Day.","ryan1788a5","Mar 06, 2012"

Light cocoa and roasted malts, but it lacked alot of depth to put it over the top into another cateogory. Still though it was a decent little stout with a nice feel, and a 5.5 percent very drinkable.

It has a little less alcohol by volume than I expected (in the 6 % range). I bought a six pack of this and I probably wouldn't buy it again.","sluggermatt15","Apr 15, 2010"
3.95,10,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Dark ebony with a whipped creamt tan head that melts slowly leaving sheets of lace on the glass. The nose is good. Black malt and coffee roastiness. The flavor is spot on for the style, rich roasty black malts with a dry coffee like bitterness in the finish. Light bodied and slightly chalky with a dry finish. Slightly harsh carbonation is the only minor complaint. A pretty good version of the style.","biggred1","Apr 13, 2010"

Saranac did a good job of brewing a tasty Guinness-like beer, but I've had better Irish stouts. While there's a respectable sour/bitter tang, I would have liked more roast and chocolate flavor. I'm not saying it needed a lot. I'm just saying there was hardly any. Still, for the price it's totally worth trying if you like stouts.","tempest","Mar 13, 2010"

The taste follows straightforwardly, with the coffee taking a darker turn and placing itself further toward the van, while the dark malts and wheat march in step behind. The finish features a slight cranberry flavor, not unlike the finish you'd find from a Guinness. The body is decidedly medium, with a good amount of carbonation and a smooth, dry texture.

Light in body with a semi creamy almost buttery texture, chocolate and roasted malt a slight bitterness late palate does its job into the finish. No complaints with this one here, this may be my new favorite Saranac offering. Very drinkable, absolutely sessionable, thought the Irish Red was good, another very strong seasonal effort from Saranac.","ATPete","Mar 04, 2010"

The taste is good as well. It has a stiff black malt bitterness that's dry and earthy. It goes down smooth and relatively light and finishes bone dry with a creamy coffee feel. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a solid Irish stout. It's not gonna blow you away, but it's true to style and damn drinkable.","WesWes","Mar 03, 2010"

Poured into a standard pint glass. Dark brown color. Nice fluffy white head. Good amount of lacing. A great start to the first beer of the day from Saranac. Smell had a hint of milk chocolate. Taste was great, as it was dry and crisp, but also had a bit of sweetness of cocoa powder and sugary coffee. Not as thick as some stouts, but had enough body to satisfy me. Easy to drink, with a good mouthfeel and a moderate abv. I'd buy this for any St Patty's day if it came in six packs.","morebeergood","Feb 22, 2010"
3.8,5.8,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Deep dark appearance, it does let some ruby highlights through when held toward the light. Tan khaki head builds up and lasts for a quite a few minutes before dwindling. After my fist sip even layers of fine lacing form and continue to trend after each sip. Aromatics are coming with the dark roasted malts, bringing out coffee and dark chocolate tones. Nothing about it is overbearingly sweeet, maybe a slight sour mash and an herbal hop presence. Flavor has iced coffee like presence, with herbal hops and a hint of chicory. Dark dry baker's chocolate and a tart sour dough finish. This is an excellent dry Irish Stout, I'm glad FX Matt attempted this. Drinkability is solid I hope to see full sixers of this, god knows we love the pricing of their beers especialy in WV.","WVbeergeek","Feb 19, 2010"

Their High Peaks line is quite good, but everything else to me has been quite average. This Irish Stout surprised me in all regards. The color is pitch black, with only a thin amount of head on top holding in a slight coffee/nutty scent. The taste is of toasted barley and coffee, and is balanced extremely well. The carbonation is barely there in the mouth, as I like my stouts. What is truly great is the drinkability. The fourth beer is just as tasty as the first. What will put this above other stouts for me is the price. Easily as good as other crafts that are $4 more per six pack.","ericlawton007","Feb 07, 2010"

3.96,10.3,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Picked this brew up for a try, new offering from Saranac. In the past been hit and miss with the new releases so was not sure what to expect. Poured to nice black color and if held to a light source you get some dark ruby color. Has a nice medium tan colored head, quite creamy, great legs and tons of lacing. The aroma comes off more roasted and toasted than burnt with a slight sweet scent, lactose? Overall a excellent aroma coming from this one. The flavor is excellent, while not complicated it has a nice roasted malts flavor, very faint astringent note, slight sweetness in the middle. Has a similar profile probably from the yeast that I get in the other offering from Saranac. That flavor works here in some of the other brews it does not. Again this one is not overly complicated, but it works extremely well for a sessional brew. Slight watery but I feel the same about most of the major Irish Dry Stouts. Now I might be called crazy but for me this brew was just as good as the Guinness or Murphy's I have had, actually like the consistence of this one better ... maybe this is me being a homer. I must say that some of the Saranac offerings have been lack luster as of late but this one is very good IMO.","Stimack","Jan 16, 2010"

It's medium-light bodied, a little bubbly, dry and crisp with a clean finish. It's a pretty mellow flavor that's well balanced. It tastes a little roasty and the finish is pretty green. It's a decent session beer.","yesyouam","0"
