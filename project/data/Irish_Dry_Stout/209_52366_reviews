"O: I appreciate that it is thicker and has a bit more flavor than regular Guinness, but I wish some of the off flavors weren't there. I can do a pint or two once a year, but not much beyond that. Hopefully it's better on tap."
""
"Overall it wasn't bad.  It had many Guinness extra stout qualities like taste and smell with a little more carbonation . But this wasn't like the bottles of extra stout I had 20 years ago..."
""

"Simple and plain, but very drinkable stout.  I've actually got to the point where the draught guinness tastes too creamy for me and now this is the one that I turn to when I want a good old guinnness.  Sure it doesn't have the complexity of the american stouts, but it tastes great and that's all that really matters.  One glaring flaw of this guy however is the mouthfeel, which is rather watery even compared to the draught (guinness lite) brother."

"While not ""bad", something labeled as Extra Stout definitely needs a fuller body and more complex flavour."

"Final Grade: 3.00, a C. Guinness Extra Stout has lived up to the anti-hype. Sessionable, but completely forgettable, this is an uninteresting stout that pales in comparison to virtually all craft/imported examples. It has more flavour than the nitrogenated draught can, which may very well scare off the uninitiated, and the overall flavour profile is unlikely to appeal to most BAs given its pedestrian qualities and annoying sweetness. I'll probably use the rest of these bottles in black-and-tan experiments, because I don't know if I have the patience to plow through the rest of them."

"I confess that I've not drank that much Guinness except for the regular stout in bottles and an occasional draft- this beer is actually quite common in my town because of the heavy Irish-American presence. This higher alcohol version is a bit thinner and much less creamy but still worthy of a try."
""

"Overall, I didn't really care for this. To tell all, it's not a style I care for. But this still leaves something to be desired for."
""
"Overall - A bit disappointed in this, would much prefer the original draught beer, although this has a lightness that makes consuming multiple an option if you enjoy this. For me I will pass and move onto something more to my liking."
"For a stout this was crisp and mild. With a bit of hop presence this is an easy drinking stout that gives some light buttered toast and a touch of caramel to a bit of dark fruits and finishes a bit tame but altogether pleasant."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall I think they did well for what's practically a light beer to me, and I do actually like that I can have a few of these, but I just can't bring myself to get over the grape juice finish, and I still don't understand why this is an ""extra"" stout. Bring on the Obsidian."
"Overall - I enjoyed this Irish stout."
""
""
""
""
"Get one :D"
""
""
""
"Overall: Easy drinker, Even my wife likes it. I could drink a bomber of it easy."
"Overall, a good beer. I'd buy this again to have with my meal if there were no craft offerings, or any amber beers available in the restaurant."

"It is a pity that Guinness is basically a synonym for stout. I do not loathe the beer and actually view it as a reasonable session option, which probably sounds insane to beer novices (those novices who know what session means in any event). Seriously, drink more stouts, even other Irish drys, and you will see what I mean. The beer is that light and drinkable in quantity despite being considered the iconic Irish dry stout. Guinness in Canada pours up with a reasonable light mocha head and one is immediately struck by the reddish brown non-opaque appearance, not the black murk one would see with most microbrewed stouts and porters. The aroma is faint chocolate malt, a hint of burnt barley, bread, light roast coffee, a tinge of grape/muscat/random funkiness and little to no hops. The body is surprisingly thin and weak, almost feels like a mainstream Irish red ale like Kilkenny, very smooth and perhaps a tad watery. The taste is more bitter than the aroma but still the hops are subdued and the flavor is burnt toast, dilute dark chocolate, some vinous fruit but again its subtle, and a sweet black tea astringency. There is a touch of the vaunted Guinness sour which probably saves the beer from total mediocrity. If you are a stout fan you want to keep sipping to see what else emerges but alas there not much else and pretty soon the beer is gone. Its not terrible but its not great. Try it to pad your list but look elsewhere for better examples of dry stout."

"Whether I prefer Labatt's version (brewed in Ontario) over the actual Irish-brewed import requires a blind taste-test I do not care to take. In truth, I don't care for either. Odd though it may sound, Nigeria, Ghana and Jamaica all have better Guinness on offer than cold-climate Canada. Maybe it's a case of not wanting what you have, but I doubt it; Caribbean, African and Belgian Guinness are simply formulated for more refined palates."

"I enjoyed it. I got a larger bottle for $3. It had two glasses worth in it. This is certainly best enjoyed in winter and in traditional Irish weather where it's never what we in North America consider ""warm."" It sticks to your insides and builds a fire there. It's a safe bet for a nice stout. I don't like it nearly as much as Magic Hat Heart of Darkness, but it's a solid bet if you want a nice dark beer that clings to your ribs."
""
"O- Overrated beer, not worth it. A disappointment."
"The taste like an old cigar. It is to bold for my taste . I could only drank one or two of this beers. I still have four beers left in the cooler. I wish I can return them. This is not a good stout!"
"O lovely Guinness. Perhaps I shouldn't settle for the extra stout Canadian brew, but it's what's available. Pours with a reasonable dense head a deep brown. Just a hint of color. Nose of roasted malt, and hints of coffee. Mouthfeel is a bit sharp and carbonated for a stout. Taste is also somewhat unrefined and clunky, but certainly enjoyable. Goes down smooth enough. Need to get myself to Arthur's Gate."
""
"O: Easy to drink and sessionable - definitely would be happy to put a couple of these down during a session (I guess I should have had this one on St. Paddy's Day)."
"It doesn't feel as smooth as the Draught, but I think this has a bit more body to it. The smoothness provided by the nitro dispense can make it feel a bit weightier than it is, but I've always found the Draught very thin. This isn't heavy either, but it's also not as thin. It's definately not watery. I think this would work pretty well as a session stout. It's not great, but it works."
""
"Overall a solid representation of the style."
""
"Chilled to around 50 degrees and served in a tulip glass. Thick brown head atop red-brown beer that's practically black. Aromas of sweet fruits, chocolate and spices. Flavors of sweet coffee, fruit and dark chocolate. Other than its seeming unpopularity, I'm not sure why I've never had this before. It's as good as, if not better than, regular Guinness."
""

"O: This beer goes down quite easily and can be considered sessionable. I wouldnâ€™t have a problem drinking a few of these in one sitting."
""
"I was actually pleasantly suprised by this beer. My wife bought it for me, after urging me to try Guinness stuff. I'd tried their regular Supermarket stuff, and wasn't particularly impressed. But this stuff had a pretty good taste about it. There's definately a hint a chocolate in there, which is a big thing for me when drinking a beer, especially a stout. The rest of the taste just seems like dark roasted malts. So a pretty simple, but a very drinkable beer. If you like something complex or unique, I don't think this will do it for you. Not terribly expensive, and an alright session brew, so if you like dark beers, give it a shot. Not the best beer I've tasted by any stretch, but certainly not the worst."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Meh. It was a decent beer but nothing special. Honestly I prefer the regular Guinness for its creamy mouth feel. I probably will not buy this again. However if they released it with a nitro tab I would definitely give it a go. Don't get me wrong a stout doesn't need a nitro tab to be great but its just something i would like to see in this one. I'd rather save some cash and get the regular or even better get some St. Ambroise or Youngs if I'm in a stout mood."

"O: Guinness Draught's more robust heavier brother, it has more hop flavor and more alcohol content, flavors are similar but the texture is much different"
""
"O- Excellent beer but the burnt aftertaste is a distinct issue."
""
""
"Overall: I used to love Guinness, but this version made in Canada is definitely not the same as the original. Off by a few steps."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I thought that Guinness Foreign Extra Stout had finally come to Canada, and was disappointed when I realized that I picked this up instead."
""
""
"O: In the end, a rather bland offering that bests the swill offered on tap as Guinness in the US, but not what other dry Irish stouts are capable of."
""
""
"Overall - The beer overall looks and smells great, and initially tastes fantastic. The very bitey aftertaste and the somewhat un-flattering mouthfeel however bring it down. Overall it is not bad, but not fantastic either. If looking for a Guinness I would go for their nitro driven draught as it flavor transitions and feels much better. But this is worth the try."

"It has a bitter taste, with a remarkable presence of hops. Not my favorite flavor for a beer."
"O: Only so much you can say about a classic. Sure, it's macro by BA standards, but I think it holds up in its category better than most mass-produced pilsnery lager beers do in theirs."

"Guiness extra stout for NA market is brewed just across the border in New Brunswick-- assuming the Moosehead brewery is the NA contractor. I buy one or two bombers/monthly even though the craft stout market is strong here. The appearance is dark color with a large head that pillows. clumps and laces. Smell is of dark roasted malt and hops. Taste is of the heavy roast malts, dark coffee/chocolate undertones and hops. Mouthfeel is medium and crisper than some. Overall I still very much appreciate a guinness extra stout even though it is ""macro"" for practical purposes. The fact it is brewed just up the way makes me think the stock is a bit fresher here."
"Pours a clear super dark brown with a 1/2 inch foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form randomly around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark malt and some slight roast and fruity aromas. Taste is of roasted malt, burnt sugar, and some fruity flavors. There is a somewhat assertive roasty bitterness that lingers on the palate long after each sip. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average stout that is really roasty and bitter. Nothing I would go for again."
""
"Overall - This beer is just boring, not much going on, bought on a whim because i was in the mood for a stout and the store i was in had a very slim selection."
""
"Favorite beers (for comparison, after all taste preferences are subjective): Elysian's Daedalus Irish Stout, Rogue's Hazelnut Brown Nectar, Allagash's White Ale, New Belgium's 1554, Full Sail's Wassail, etc. Beers I don't like: IPAs (with few exceptions)"
"M. Lighter body with highly active carbonation. Unusually 'crisp' texture for a stout because of this, and I'm not certain that the high levels of fizziness match up well with the flavor profile."
"O-definitely a decent drinking stout. of course its not something i'd go to over many other easily obtainable stouts. the tastes are clean though, and if i'm stuck drinking this, i'll be okay with it!"
""
"Guinness Extra Stout pours a very dark brown, with some ruby near the edges. A one and a half-inch head of a light tannish head caps the brew, leaving a moderate lace throughout. As expected, rich roasted malt aromas dominate, with hints of chocolate and coffee, just hints. This brew was much sweeter then expected. As you may have noticed, Stouts do not get their fair share of ratings on our page, yet whenever we do get the chance to share them with you, we are always pleasantly surprised. Extra stout brings flavors of rich coffee, chocolate, sweet and smoky malt, and slight hop bitterness to the pallet. Lighter in carbonation, the brew features an amazingly smooth mouthfeel, and is medium-high in body. Sip and enjoy the flavors and history of this World-famous brew!"

"Pretty good brew! This one apparently was brewed in Canada. Its has really nice smell with a sweet malt with light hop finish on the nose. The taste little less impressive but its super smooth and very easy to drink to be an extra stout. I would recommend trying one out if you have a need for some Caramel style Malts!"
""
""
"O- The flavors are ok with this but it is clearly not in the running for worlds greatest stout. Comes accross as just a middle of the rood stout. Could use more body and some bigger smells and flavors. Still a good everyday beer to keep around."
""
""
""
"Overall I'm not really a big Guinness fan but I liked this. I would buy it again but am looking to try the foreign version next."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- After I've had the original Guinness in Dublin, how can I be anything but disappointed? Won't buy again."
""
""
"Poured into a snifter. Very dark with a light tan head and a little bit of lacing. Smell is nice with lots of toasted malt and caramel. Taste is sweet with more of a bitter finish than expected but not at all unpleasant. Not much carbonation. Medium body at most but probably a little watery. Very dry. This is pretty good."

"O. I enjoyed drinking this beer. not as good as the foreign/extra stout, but still worth the price. would def buy again."
""
"Worth a go in a pinch it is almost worth grabbing just to admire its aesthetic qualities."
"Overall: Recommended when your short of time."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I consider this to be a drinkable and very standard, average stout. So, ignoring grade inflation, it's a C. In the future I would get this on tap to compare."

"It's drinkable. And it sure impresses the chicks. I have to explain to them that's like Budweiser...pretty darn average...don't expect a great beer. Expect a good one...well I'm alright with saying that..."
"I would like my stouts to have more depth to them, but this does bring flavor to the table. I would easily buy this drink again, but mostly because it's the darkest drink around my town that could be bought late into the night. I would pick this easily over a Guinness Draught, but it's still no wow. One could easily avoid this drink, but if they are simply going to a supermarket to get a drink then this it's a decent dark choice."
"The taste is malty and sweet with some really harsh astringency that is somewhat metallic in nature. It's really quite gross. This is not a good stout! Drink anything but this."
"-Overall 4.0: The word ""reliable"" is what first comes to mind. I've tasted stouts better than this, but this is the old reliable. Come to think of it, I like this word better than ""reliable"": ""the standard."" To me, Canadian Guinness is the benchmark by which all other stouts are measured."
"O- Very disappointed in this beer; flavorless, which is definitely not what I want out of a stout"
"The lingering bitterness detracts from the mouthfeel for this type of beer in my view, but overall it's a pretty good package. I like it far better than regular Guinness Draught (especially the nitro-tap/nitro-can version) and would not mind drinking it from time to time."
"Overall it is a good beer ... especially for being mass produced."
"This beer reliably pours with a thick head that lasts. There is a distinct tannic flavor, low hop bitterness but heavy roasted bitterness. Tastes good cold and warm. I like."
"Overall its alright. As an american man with 3 Irish grandparents I wish our biggest beer from the Isle was a wopper of flavor but in the name of capitalism it sure aint what I hope it used to be"
"T: sweet notes, moderate roast, coffe like finish, bitter sweet on the palate"
"I really enjoyed this beer, I though it had nice flavor and relatively easy to drink for the style."
"I know now why stouts aren't good in the warm weather. hahah wayyy to heavy right now."
"Overall I am surprised by this bitter medicinal feeling, kind of was expecting this to be more enjoyable but when I examined it a little closer it really wasn't. It's totally drinkable I'll give it that."
"Decent in a pinch."
"O: This review started with a good looking beer... and went straight down hill from that! Being only the second Stout I've had (the first being Deschutes' Obsidian Stout) I think I had high hopes for this. Heard so much about Guinness. Not impressed at all. Don't even want to finish the bottle really. Will not buy again. I will give other Guinness' a shot though."
"It poured dark black in body, it had a tan head that leaves slight lacing. slight grape, hint of bitter chocolate. Tastes of chocolate,bitter chocolate, hop bitterness towards the finish and then a dryness that rides through the end with grape notes sliding on the sides of the palate. Medium-heavy bodied brew with pretty active medium carbonation. This is a good beer when there is nothing else on the beer list."
"D - I'm not a huge fan of stouts, and this one isn't really an exception. Less-than-enjoyable flavor really does it in. Though I have to admit, it looks pretty good."
"M & D - drinkable. Good, light malt aftertaste with mild coffee. Light body considering the fact that it is an extra stout. Goes down easy."
"All in all, I'm digging it a bit more than draught, but can't say it's all that. That being said, I think for a dry irish stout, its pretty solid."
"I mostly cooked so much with it because I wasn't excited about drinking it. Of course, my general tendency to not love stouts made this no surprise. As a stout I'm sure it's completely decent."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer pours like it is a lighter bodied beer. The beer is a very dark ruby-brown, with a chunky, light, big bubbled head that separates as it sits. The cascade was very quick and short-lived, which is kind of disappointing. Nose is slightly sweet-cream and coffee, with some chocolatey highlights, too. The beer has a light feel in mouth, leaning towards the dry side. There are flavors of slight sour malt, bitter dark chocolate, and dark brewed coffee. The beer has a very dry and quick finish, with a slightly bitter and sour aftertaste. Not as easy to drink as other Guinness offerings."
"O: I was hoping for a better result with this Guinness since i'm not a big fan of the normal one. But the sour taste to this beer wasn't exactly what I was looking for. The body was a major improvement though since I hate the watery body of the normal Guinness in the nitro can."
"O: I prefer regular Guinness or FES, but this is not as awful as I recall it being when I first had it. I've definitely had worse stouts from other brewers, and worse beers from nasty, dirty taplines. Overall, if you're in a pinch, it'll trump most BMC options."
"Pours black in body with small floating tan head that leaves slight lacing. Aroma of tang, slight grape, hint of chocolate in background, and some grassy notes. Tastes of chocolate, cola, bitter chocolate, tang, hop bitterness towards the finish and then a dryness that rides through the end with tang/grape notes sliding on the sides of the palate. Medium-heavy bodied brew with pretty active medium carbonation."
"You cant feel the high ABV and there was reasonable retention, otherwise this was alot of hype and little else."
"I haven't had an Extra Stout from Ireland, but the Canadian product really fits the style description. I've read a lot of disappointment regarding Labatt brewing this beer, but it has a lot of character in my mind, doesn't taste like a macro at all. There is a hell of a lot more to this than Guinness Draught as available in the U.S."
"D - With a little body behind it this could actually be a pretty good beer. The thin mouthfeel and lack of aroma take it down a few notches."
"The mouthfeel here is downright strange. I think I got a bottle with carbonation problems, it's quite flat. There's a little bit of a prickly factor here to remind me this should be carbonated, but not much. The drinkability also suffers. The lack of carbonation just makes this hard to get through, since it doesn't have a thick and creamy mouthfeel to make up for the lack of carbonation. Another fail in my quest to enjoy a Guinness. It's just not very good, at all. Next stop - FES!"
"I like this a lot better than regular Guinness draft and will definitely try it again."
"Not a great head, one finger of light brown foam that went away in seconds. Little lace, less cling. Very dark brown color, matching a 39 on the SRM beer color chart. Aromas of butter, chocolate, caramel, vanilla, and molasses. Tastes of coffee, toffee, caramel, vanilla, dark chocolate, malt, and molasses. Good amount of body as this brew flows over my teeth and tongue. This is not quite as good as the same product from Ireland, but not shabby. Will drink this again"
"This is easily the worst beer I've drunk since the last time I tried Guinness."
"Overall another failure from Guinness, though as far as Irish Irish dry stouts go this might be the best example."
"D- great session brew, drinks very easy, and tastes wonderful. far better than it's draught can/bottle little brother."
"I have to wonder if this is what the real Extra Stout really tastes like. Being licensed by Labatt to be brewed in Canada does not fill me with any amount of certainty, or hope. Expectations and now preconceptions aside, this was indeed a chore to finish."
"....Decent stout for quaffing with mussels."
"A decent offering here, a good bit different from the draught version, this is another beer altogether."
"P.S. if this beer is the same as one listed can someone tell me, and perhaps a brief history of how a Guinness says brewed in Canada on the bottle"
