Appearance is outstanding with a almost black body and creamy head that lasts all the way to the bottom with cascading bubbles until it settles down and she serves it. The aroma of sweet malt, roasted coffee and lastly the bitterness is perfect. The taste is a blend of tart and bitter with a smokey flavor (I like burnt-smokey alcoholic drinks). The feel is a rich cream giving way to a somewhat lighter than expected ending, overall a stout you can keep on drinking.","Capt_Pete","Mar 19, 2015"

3.73,6,4,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,"Anyway. It looked fabulous as always. The billowy silky smooth dark tan foam retained all the way down to the bottom of the glass. The beer is black and refuses any light to pass through. It smells carbonic and minerally, which sadly covered up any beer aroma for me. Nitro beers... It tasted better than I remember. The silky creaminess balanced nicely with the slightly bitter charred wood of the brew with espresso undertones. The deep burnt roast lingers long and very mildly sweet. I liked the rich creaminess. The lively epravescance keeps the creaminess at bay and keeps it from feeling like a milkshake. This beer was far better than I remember; I've sampled hundreds of other beers since the last. It's a good solid beer maybe 60-75 percentile. It's a good option at those crummy 5 beer restaurants that only serve this, a macro beer, macro beer light, a heffe, and a bad pale.","constantine_272","Mar 19, 2015"

3.59,2,4.75,3.25,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Well it's St Patrick's Day, and I would have preferred an Extra Stout, or Foreign Extra, but a can of Guinness Draught will do. It opens with a pop and a strange squeal from the hidden nitro widget. It resembles coffee with cream as it pours in to the trademark Guinness Perfect Pint glass. There's a beautiful cascade effect as the darker suds fight their way to the bottom. What's left when it's all said and done is a picture perfect pint. Deep, dark brown, nearly black, with ruby highlights where the light hits the base of the glass just right. The head is a solid inch of custard like foam, so densely packed that only a close examination reveals the miniscule bubbles. Dip your finger in to it and the impression remains, like icing on a cake. Guinness draught definitely has the look down. Perhaps one of the most appealing appearances of any beer out there. The aroma brings faint chocolate malts, black coffee and a little sourness on the nose. A hint of the roasted bitterness that is sure to come out in the flavor. Mild, yet characteristic of a dry Irish stout. The taste brings a bit of tartness, married with a nice bittering ash that creates a smoky, mild flavor. Lingering roast dominates the finish. Fairly simple, yet nuanced. Certainly on the thin, easy side of the spectrum. The mouthfeel is creamy and rich in the beginning, and then thin and watery as the nitro loses steam. Personally, I think it loses something in the draught flow cans. It's a novel concept that brings it to your fridge, but no substitute for the real draught Guinness on tap. That said, it's still a great example of the style. Simple, uncomplicated, accessible. A great beer to broaden your horizons with.","JohnnyI","Mar 18, 2015"

I know it isn't exciting, complex, interesting or even amazingly delicious, (especially compared to so many of the incredible beers that are brewed today) but I love it all the same. Maybe it's just the experience that comes with each glorious pint that I enjoy so much; Sitting down in a laid-back pub with friends, grinning like an idiot, just enjoying myself. For me, Guinness fills that perfect little niche between the crappy big-brand beers that you can mindlessly chug one after another, and the stupid-good craft brews that will put you on your ass after just a few.","ERMAHGERD","Mar 10, 2015"

Alot of flavors going on here. This is an iconic beer that is just simply well made. If you haven't tried Guinness, you should  give it a try. The more I drink it, the more I enjoy it!

That does not make it the king of Stouts that its branding would have you believe it is but for what it is meant to be this is a decent enough brew. This beer is more than drinkable and is a longstanding favourite here in Ireland its relatively low alcohol content makes it a very sociable drink and not too heavy on the gut like some.","BeerDrinkersWorldTour","Sep 10, 2014"

AROMA: roasted coffe like aroma with cocoa notes. some faint alcoholic aromas. low esters and very low hop aromas. APPEARANCE: jet black color and opaque with ruby highlights. thick slight tanned head with good retention. TASTE: roasted flavours with a coffee-like dry finish. some chocolate sweet flavour. medium-low bitterness and no hop flavours. PALATE: medium-light body with a creamy sensation. low carbonation and no astringency. OVERALL: a good and creamy dry stout that maybe would benefit from a little more hop bitterness.","titvs","Sep 06, 2014"

THis is one of my all time go too beers . if you want flavor , something light (Yes i said something light ) then grab a Guinness . low ABV and very light mouth feel . this is my idea of a Macro beer AKA coors light . i keep Guinness on tap always at my home along with two other beers on tap (usally HOp Devil) and many other crafted bottle beer . if you are looking for a high complex Stout this is not for you . this is something you can session and goes down nice after cutting the grass...","buzzedup","Sep 02, 2014"

The taste follows the nose, but a little sweeter and creamier. Almost milky, but in a very enjoyable way. Hints of chocolate.

You know what you are paying for and you know despite it's mediocrity compared to other more complex stouts, it is after all a Guinness and a classic. More of a starter stout for newbies opening up to the world of stouts, it pours a opaque dark brown almost black color, has an impressive 1.5 inch foamy creamy khaki head that dissipates very slowly (thanks to the nitro tap), most places put the clover in the head as well. Once dissipated it leaves minor lacing on the glass. The aroma is of roast, subtle coffee overtones, and a slightly acidic zing to the nostrils. It tastes rather dull, mostly the same as the aromas previously mentioned.  The mouthfeel is thin and watery though balanced with the thick head, a lot lighter body than what you would suspect after first looking at a Guinness. Overall, like I said, it's a classic and you when you want a Guinness you want a Guinness.","anthony23cippy","Aug 03, 2014"

Like most people I found the first few pints  unpalatable but came to like the beer after some time. Then I discovered real flavour and didn't touch Guinness again for years. A pint of Guinness looks great, smells uninteresting,,  has a one dimensional burnt flavour devoid of hops and an overdeveloped nitro-head that doesn't seem to do anything other than maintain the good appearance until the point is finished. If you want to drink Guinness and have flavour, ditch this and stick to the foreign extra offering.","Dextrose","Aug 01, 2014"

It's very low in alcohol compared to most of the American ABV bombs out there. It is very smooth. Not tons of flavor. Creamy. It is dark and that intimidates most people but I find it more mild than most beers. In some ways I get that the overall review for this beer is "okay". But then I don't!!! This is a Guinness!

The appearance looks good with the cascading effect in the glass, the smell is pretty typical stout, roasted malts with hint of coffee/chocolate. Then I got to the taste....yuck! Im not sure how they call that a stout but it is so watery and bland its borderline just gross! Not too happy with this beer by Guinness","tlennon0815","Jul 06, 2014"

From the creamy head to the hints of chocolate/coffee tones, I rather enjoy this beer. It's rich history helps to create a rather magical experience for the consumer. The best stout I've ever had? Probably not... But none can match this beer's place in history. After all, those stouts that we enjoy today were built upon this beer's foundation!","Big-Daddy","Jun 21, 2014"

This stout pours a deep mahogany color with a thick off white head and lacing. The nose is an unnecessarily sweet blend of coffee and; unfortunately, adjunct malts. The mouth is very smooth and very creamy. We all know the guinness mouthfeel and wish so many other beers could achieve it. The flavor is overly sweet and seems like mass produced beer. Yet it still has all the rich flavors of roasted coffee, vanilla, and dark chocolate. For a mass produced stout it is well crafted but lacks the finesse and refinement of other craft stouts.","lochef81","Apr 21, 2014"

I've had it on draft locally and thought it was perfectly fine, though nothing to rave over- it also makes a good black and tan.

However, it's still enjoyable in the total sum of all its parts (and has a great story and history). It's amazingly drinkable and smooth.

I hope to visit Ireland soon (not just for the beer of course (although that is one reason)), and I will definitely have to try it out. However, I've never had a pint of this beer that I didn't like.

This used to be my favorite stout before I began exploring the beer culture. I have tried numerous other Irish Dry Stouts that have surpassed Guinness. Since I have opened my eyes to new beers, Guinness has fallen as a "run-of-the-mill" stout. As many people have said on here, it is a typical go-to stout when nothing else is available, like at a typical restaurant.","TheChrisK","Oct 21, 2013"

3.32,-5.7,4,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and a solid example of the style, it's got just enough roasted flavors to fit in to the style while not being too filling and staying sessionable like it should. This beer had good drinkability, it's smooth, creamy, not too filling, and it's got just enough flavor to hold my attention till i get drunk and not care about taste anymore. I like the appearance and mouthfeel the most, to me that's one thing that sets this beer apart from other beers in the style. What I liked the least amount this beer is the taste and aroma, I think it could handle a little more roast, but I can see how people like it just how it is. I only really buy this beer for St. Patrick's day, but I will order it at a bar if there isn't anything better available. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to get into the world of dark beers, it may not be like a lot of dark beers, but it gives you a slight idea of what they are like. All in all I don't mind this beer, it's nothing that I will go out of my way to get, but when the options are low this makes for a good alternative.","StoutHunter","Oct 20, 2013"

This and a handful of Irish stouts were, for the longest time, the only conception of beer that I had other than macro light lagers like Bud and Coors. Back then I thought this was head and shoulders above those light lagers. Now that I've come this far, I can see that it's really the same concept: brew a bland, uniform, inoffensive beer and rely heavily on deep pockets and marketing to spread it around the globe and make maximum profit, sacrificing quality along the way if necessary. I will go on the record as saying that I still enjoy a Guinness from time to time, and that my own personal preference would still lead me to drink a Guinness over a macro light lager. But when I look at Guinness Draught in terms of what's available and stack it up against some of the other Irish stouts on the market, craft brewed and otherwise, it falls well short of the mark.","ryan1788a5","Aug 08, 2013"

Guinness draught isn't a heavy, complex porter that will change your perspective of beer. But it's a good simple alternative to the other basic lagers or porters you might order with dinner, or at a cafe. It's light enough to not dominate a meal or fill you up, but it's creamy and tasty enough to be an enjoyable alternative when you want something a bit different. Either way, I'm still quite fond of this beer.","freneticamnesic","Jul 01, 2013"

However, character goes deeper than appearance and, unfortunately, Guinness isn't all that it's cracked up to be underneath the incredible looks. A watered-down, diminished taste for a beer that looks absolutely incredible. I would get this on tap if better options weren't available and may purchase in nitro-cans if hosting parties or making Poor Man's Velvets, but would not purchase in a non-nitro format. I fear that the wateriness would be all too evident in other formats.","Beric","Jun 01, 2013"

A small pub on the eastern side of the country far from Dublin. But this little stone pub, darkly lit with a great fireplace and not-so-great fish n' chips served me my first Guinness. Yes, that's right, never had one in the States at that point. That dark creamy rich taste and texture was amazing. And, now, sipping on a Guinness Draught bought in Kansas City, I see why people say you have to have Guinness in Ireland to appreciate it. 4.5/5 on tap in Ireland. 3.5/5 (at best) in a can in the States.","jewellrunner","Mar 24, 2013"

2.86,-18.8,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,3,"I figured St. Patrick's Day was a good day to finally actually review this one. Poured on nitro-tap at Dugans on 3/17/13. This beer does look very nice in the glass. This is of course one of the more common introduction beers for most people to something other than a macro-lager. It looks wonderfully deep dark with reddish highlights and a very nice white frothy head developing from the creamy pour. The smell just isn't there though. After years of drinking other stouts, this beer just lacks the good nose of a stout. There's some light bread crust smell and maybe some dried grass, but it's not much. The taste, while better than a regular can or regular tap line, is still just average. It's creamy and dry finishing, but very watery overall. The body of the beer is just so wimpy after you drink other stouts. Tastes mostly of brown bread and a little of bitter, dry hops. Not a terrible beer, but not great.","estlinska","Mar 18, 2013"

I like Guinness for what is, not for what I want it to be, and that’s enough for me. Guinness is now a mass produced mega-brew, and the reality is that it’s not much better than any other brew produced on that scale. Initially, it pours dark with a nice creamy head that disappears soon enough. The first sip tastes of roasted malted barley, but as your taste buds adapt to the smoky, dark flavor it has a refreshing but watery taste. It is a porter in name only, and much closer in taste to a dark lager such as “Michelob Dark” (although smoother than more drinkable). I’m not necessarily a beer snob, but a modern Guinness Draught is no match for a quality micro-brewed porter. You won’t have to twist my arm too hard to get me to drink one, but this beer is nothing special.","bogggyboys","Jan 20, 2013"

The beer has the aroma of sweet and dark roasted malts and some coffee. The taste follows the nose and has the familiar flavors of Guinness in a more watery form. The roastiness is forward with some mild malt sweetness. The coffee notes blend well with the dark roasted malts. The body is light to medium with a creamy mouthfeel provided by the nitro widget.

This pours a nice black color with a large foamy mocha colored head (far larger than I'm used to on nitro bottles, perhaps this is due to removing the nitro widget). This has an extremely long retention time and leaves a lacing everywhere it touches. The smells are of dark roasted malts and a hint of the Guinness burnt smells. The feel is medium to thick and creamy. More warm this is better, the taste is light but smooth and easy to drink, you get the dark roasted malts, and a little burnt malt bitterness, more subtle than the traditional guinness. Not the greatest beer in the world but a great session one and I often order it with my meal.","DavidST","Dec 30, 2012"

4.8,36.4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Reviewing beers on this site is surely subjective, but when it comes to rating a beer, it should be based on its merits compared to other beers of the same style. Hands down, this is the BEST Irish Dry Stout from draft on the planet! This is the benchmark. No questions asked. I’d highly encourage people to remember that when they are reviewing this beer. I understand the bottle and canned version of this can vary greatly while a non-Irish tap will not taste as good; however, if you ever have the chance to enjoy a pint of this from a pub in Dublin, rest assured, you will not be disappointed. If you find another Irish Dry Stout that is more enjoyable, please send me a bottle or message with the name and I’d love to try it. Until I find one that is better, I’ll keep going back to this beautiful creation every time I need a quick reminder of what started my love and enjoyment for craft beer. Cheers Arthur and here’s to another 253 years of the beautiful black stuff!","spdyfire83","Nov 14, 2012"

I've had a few Guinness' over the years, but had to pick up a 12 pack after returning home to judge the difference. Overall, the appearance, smell, and taste is no comparison to the outstanding Guiness on tap so I am slightly biased. It's pretty much a staple in every pub, but for the imported bottles used for this review make it just an OK beer. The head is much smaller and the smell and taste is just average.","javatime","Sep 19, 2012"

The taste pretty much follows the smell. Imagine dropping two coffee beans into a gallon of water and you've pretty much got the taste of this brew down. The mouthfeel is nothing but water, With an even lesser extent of the coffee coming through. Overall I was extremely disappointed in this beer. This is not a stout in any way shape or form.

Why this pub draught stuff has surpassed the regular extra stout in popularity is beyond me, because there's no comparison in my view. Even on nitro, it was equally unimpressive, other than the look and the lasting, creamy head. But the body was still watery and the finish disappointing. Taste hadn't changed, the usual suspects for a dry stout, coffee, roasty, a bit nutty perhaps. Stick with the regular extra stout or the foreign export stout.","AlCaponeJunior","May 18, 2012"

3.29,-6.5,4.5,3,3,4,3.5,"A simple, Humpty-Dumpty Irish Dry Stout with loads of character, but not many can explain why. A beer to drink and enjoy drinking for those who don't give two hoots about the style or the historical butchering of the recipe over the years. A beer to scoff at for those who have had better dry stouts. Tough to love for those who have had North Coast Old #38, Victory Donnybrook, Beamish, or Murphy's. Tough love is God's love, I suppose. And, for a man who has had all of the aforementioned brews, I can only exclaim "My Goodness, My Guinness!". C'mon, if you don't know what this is, you've got no business venturing off into the better options out there. Guinness IS Irish Dry Stout. Guinness IS the import on nitro. Guinness IS a classic. But, the truth is, Guinness is nothing special, and certainly not worth the $5 a pint some bars charge. It's a one-and-done-and-thank-you with a smile, or a fall-back and nothing else. When in doubt, have a Guinness. 3.5","thecheapies","May 03, 2012"

However, this beer is so thin, flat, and burnt that I've wondered for years what people are possessed by when they choose to spend their money on this poor excuse for a stout. One advantage is it's drinkability. I've often likened it to water into which someone spilled their ashtray, but, water nonetheless. Hence, easy-drinking. I'd like to think that any self-respecting beer enthusiast wouldn't be caught in the darkest corner of the most obscure bar drinking this swill. I'm quite disappointed in my Irish half. Having been to the Guiness brewery and virtually every pub, large and small, around the coastal areas of Ireland, I know that Guiness isn't just some garbage made popular by American advertising like Samuel Adams was--the Irish really have a lot of pride in this so called stout. But, just to put things into context, Miller Genuine Draft and Budweisier was one Euro more per pint than Guiness at every pub in which I had the honor to visit. That speaks to me. You make you're own judgement. Felt obligated to drink it on St. Patrick's Day. Otherwise, you'd never have seen this review.","DocJitsu","Mar 17, 2012"

2.23,-36.6,3,2.5,2,2.5,2,"This beer pours a dark brown color with some ruby hues. There is a big creamy 2-finger off-white head resting on top. The head has incredible retention, and it leaves behind a big coating of lace on the glass. The nose is pretty light. There are some weak notes of chocolate and coffee, as well as some nuttiness. There really isn't much going on here. The taste starts off with some light roasted malts, and some faint notes of black coffee and a touch of chocolate. There is some burnt bitterness and a bit of a metallic taste. This is just a pretty weak flavor overall. This has a pretty light body, especially for a stout, and creamy carbonation. There is some bitterness and some sweetness as well. I think the creamy layer of foam on top is the only thing that saved the mouthfeel. The drinkability here isn't so good. It goes down really easy, but it is definitely lacking in the taste and smell. There just isn't much going on, and the flavors and aromas seem quite muted. I really just expect a whole lot more in a stout. This beer just really isn't worth the money. You can get a much better 6-pack of a nice craft stout for the same amount of money. I recommend going the second route.","JizackFH","Dec 05, 2011"

It is nice though. If you are one who is not into stouts or coffee/chocolate beers like the extra stout, this is definitely for you. If you are getting into the stouts, TRY THIS FIRST. if you like this, then get into the darker stronger more coffee-ish and chocolaty beers.

I have had this in the nitro can and the bottle and I think I prefer it from the nitro can.

I've heard the North American Guinness is inferior to the genuine Irish product, and that what we get is actually Guinness "Essence" that is mixed somehow with inferior base ingredients. Even assuming this is true, we have not gotten the shaft. Guinness on draft is still the beer to beat.

No smell noted, with a very thin feel that reminds me of drinking a standard American light beer. If not for the appearance, you might as well be drinking Coors Light or Bud light. It's pretty tough to taste the difference, although the mouthfeel is slightly creamier if you really concentrate. Overall, I'd drink this over a standard light beer but it's in the same ballpark.

When it warms it's pretty nice with a decent amour of dry, roasted malt. Hints of chocolate, toffee, nut and caramel complimented by the creamy lactic feel/flavor. Dry finish. Not the best of the style but underrated, possibly because of it's popularity.","corby112","Jul 04, 2011"

Ive had good pints, ok pints, and great pints. this review is for the pint of guinness i got at the 9lb hammer in georgetown seattle. first off the pour was done right, i had to wait a minute half way through for it to settle. this pint is deep black(red hue in the light), with a cream white head two fingers thick. beautiful! 9lb pours the coldest guinness ive had, which i think makes the beers taste fresh and clean. it's creamy, smooth, smoky and balanced. sometimes there's nothing like a guinness... i will say this, i try to stay away from the cans and bottles, on tap is the only way to have to have guinness.","aaron12","Mar 24, 2011"

3.66,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a beautiful, creamy, one finger head. I know this is just the work of the nitrogen, but it still looks amazing. The head is the closest to white that I have seen in a long time. And the body is pitch black, nice contrast. The head hangs in there forever as well. As for smell, I mean it smells like a Guinness, it's hard to describe because it's a one of a kind smell and flavor, I'll do my best though. The first smell you get is a sour smell, but it's not nearly as sour as the Guinness extra stout, it's very subtle and by no way off putting. The sour smell is mixed in with a sweet malty smell, maybe a tiny tiny bit of hops in there somewhere, but not much. Like I said, it's a one of a kind taste and smell, you have to have one to know what I'm talking about really, my description really doesn't describe it very well. The smell isn't amazing, because Guinness is not the most amazing beer, but it does smell good, and very smooth. The first thing I notice on the flavor is just a robust feel to the beer, that comes in before an flavor really. I know robust is a term to relate to flavor, but I'm using it with mouthfeel because I can't think of anything else to use. I can't say it's a thick mouthfeel, because it is a very thin beer on the mouth. And I also can't say that it has a robust flavor, because the flavor is very simple. But the beer does have robust characteristics, it's hard to explain, but it just fills you up with flavor and mouthfeel, even though it doesn't have much of either. :P confusing I know. The next thing I notice is just how it glides across the mouth, I mean this thing is so freaking smooth, wow. Yes, it is a little watery, and thin on the mouth, but it is so smooth. On the actual taste: yes you do get that sour flavor, but it is so small, it's hardly noticeable, and you do get a sweetness, and a malt flavor, but they are all mixed together nicely. No flavor is dominant, and no flavor is too present, which is a little disappointing that the flavors aren't more powerful, but I knew they wouldn't be coming into this. I don't really get any hops in this beer, if there are any IBU's to this beer, it's a 2 or 3. Overall, the flavor is very good, it's not impressive, but it's good, smooth, and drinkable. To come back to mouthfeel and drinkability: mouthfeel is good, but thin. Drinkability is very very very good!

Some roasted malt, coffee notes and a hint of chocolate. But just very watered down tasting. Also, the body was very thin for a stout.

Drinkability would be great if I was being forced to drink it, being so light and watery I could drink until I'm full, but the overall failure of this brew ensures I won't be buying this again.","jj311","Mar 04, 2011"

Mouthfeel was silky, creamy, like a dollop of something you might add to your coffee. Speaking of coffee, that was its initial flavour on the tongue. It was then followed by a chocolaty sweetness and then a charcoal bitterness. Finish was dry, more toward the charcoal/smoke taste than the sweetness noted earlier. Great lacing throughout.

Smells of roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate with that unique Guinness smell that I assume is a byproduct of the nitrogen. One thing that has always amazed me with Guinness is just how quaffable it is - everyone assumes that dark beers are challenging to finish. That's not the case with this beer. It's easy to drink which is probably why I got into it in the first place. The taste gives you lots of roasted and chocolate malt in the background, and the nitrogen lends the beer a nice creaminess. Chocolate milk isn't necessarily the best description - Guinness isn't a milk stout - but perhaps something like Yoo-Hoo is more appropriate. There are some hops there, though they are quite earthy and muted. Fuggles perhaps? The hops lend a nice and lightly bitter finish to the entire affair.

My very first Guinness was straight out of the tap at a small pub just off Grafton Street, near Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland. I thought I had died and gone to heaven, and have had a lot of Guinness since, in a lot of places, a lot of styles. This nitro bottle is actually not bad for a bottled beer, but it's not the same as a real nitro-tapped Guinness fresh from a hopping pub. This beer pours more dark brown than the classic Guinness black. The head is okay, but has a lot of larger bubbles. It does cling well to the glass as you drink it, and the head does carry a lot of the good bitter hops onto your tongue. Otherwise, the beer is just not so great. It has a coffee flavor that is too mellow, and a texture that is a bit too watery -- nothing near as thick and creamy as a "real" Guinness.

3.46,-1.7,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,4,"Overall: If this beer is being rated as a traditional stout it falls far short, but I believe that Guinness Draught from a can is not meant at all to taste like a normal stout, but instead like a can of nitro Guinness. This makes rating difficult because I am not sure what to compare it to. I think people either love Guinness for what it is, or disdain it because it is not a typical stout. Take your pick. Personally, I love this beer because of its interesting and rich history, and because of the marketing involved. It is packaged beautifully and looks simply wonderful in a glass. So it is watery? I kind of think it is refreshing for that reason. No it will never be Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout but I don't think it is trying to be...","allforbetterbeer","Jan 15, 2010"

3.62,2.8,5,3,3.5,4,4,"Mmmm, Guinness. This was one of my favorite beers before I got into micros. The best thing about this beer is the appearance: dark brown / black, with a huge creamy head. Head retention is very good, it stays around for the duration of the beer. There is a light roasted aroma. The flavor is of roasted malts and bitter coffee. This is fairly watery for a stout, but it still has a extremely smooth mouthfeel from the nitro. The mouthfeel would be exceptional if the body wasn't so light. Overall this is kind of bland compared to other stouts, but it's still a very drinkable beer.","chickenm","Jan 08, 2010"

3.68,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"I have to admit that this beer was and remains one of my first loves. I'd never tasted anything like it -- low carbonation, black, milky consistency, and a solid, nutty flavor that had me at the first sip. However, I will admit that this beer has its faults. The burnt, woody flavor quickly becomes monotonous. The taste is really too mild for its heartiness -- I found myself wishing for a "bigger" flavor with more depth. However, it's incredibly drinkable and has the power to lure beer-haters out of their caves. Those who wish for a stronger, more nuanced flavor might try Guinness Extra Stout.","amtriska","Jan 07, 2010"
3.29,-6.5,4.5,3,3,3,4,"This is the first beer I got into when I turned 21, so Guinness always has a special place in my heart. Finally took the time to review one. My tastes have changed since then, but I still like it. Poured it into a Tulip style pint glass it has a nice looking nitro effect to it while being poured. The bubbles slowly work their way to the top. Whether or not you're a fan of Guinness I feel everyone should agree atleast that it's a good looking beer. A few years ago I would have rated the taste and smell so much higher, but pretty average now. It's generously malted, very sweet with hints of chocolate and coffee. When let back down to room temperature you can slightly smell the hop but you really have to look for it. In the taste it's also difficult to pick up on the hop, it does have a slight bitterness to it. It's nothing too high in quality but well blended. The mouthfeel is pretty good, for a stout it does feel a bit watered down for a stout. It's very drinkable, no matter what the occasion. Not my favorite beer anymore, but I'll still never turn one down!","AndyAvalanche","Jan 06, 2010"

Light bitterness predominiates. The mouthfeel has always been a little thin for my liking, as I prefer my stouts a little more creamy/chewy. Even low ABV stout as the one could benefit from a rich mouthfeel. Drinkability is decent, but in my experience you'll feel 'full' long before you feel a buzz.","mondegreen","Jan 01, 2010"

Hints of chocolate, nuts, molasses and some funky sour-like thing going on (note: was amazed to come on and read so many reviews describing this quality, i did not remeber this at all last time i had a pint).

Retention is legendary and some very nice, thick lacing clings to the glass. The smell emanating from this beer is, unfortunately, somewhat muted. What I am able to discern are subtle notes of bready, buttery malts, chocolate and some coffee. Taste is more pronounced with lots of bread and butter up front with the dark roasted chocolate notes picking up mid-sip resulting in a finish that is roasty with a nice amount of bitterness from the hops. Mouthfeel is thick and very creamy with not a whole lot in terms of noticeable carbonation. This stout goes down smooth. Drinkability is another excellent quality of this beer - I feel like I could drink this stuff till the cows come home. Overall, sometimes nothing goes down like it. It could be more pronounced flavour wise. However, when you're in the mood for a silky-smooth, easy drinking stout, it's hard to beat.

Appearance is perfect and aroma is very good, but somehow its more watery than I remember. Reading other reviews its obvious I'm not alone in my opinion. Of course considering my last review was of FBS I'm probably expecting too much. Taste is good (pleasant roasted malt bitterness), mouthfeel is silky, but there's a wateriness that dulls both and leads to point deductions.

It has just a slight hint of roasted malts and grains, but you almost have to be searching for it. As I mentioned it is very tough to grade an old standard that is so familiar.

In the cans, I just got it for about $1.12 for 14.9 oz (7.5 cent per oz). So, it's about 90 cents per 3/4 pint while cheap beer is 66 cents- not much more. Even though it's watered down, it's cheap for stout and the only one in my area. It's an affordable beer, widely available, with great branding.

Pours a dark black with a creamy white head and the standard brownish alive cool looking action in the beer before it settles to black with the cream head that lasts. This is not lacing, as the beer moves from the glass the creamy composition of the head literally stays on the glass. Smells of coffee and faint chocolate.

This review is solely based on my experience with Guinness, straight from the tap in a classic Irish pub in Dublin, which I assure you is quite different than cracking open a can and pouring it into an Irish Car Bomb. Now,Guinness on tap in CA is crap, in New York it's pretty good, in western Ireland is pretty damn good, and in Dublin is fucking amazing. The appearance is thick, like motor oil, with a beautifully dense creamy head. The smell is a bit hard for me to detect, but it's the classic "stout" smell, if you catch my drift. The taste was absolutely wonderful, thick, creamy, chocolatey. The drinkability can be judged by the general happiness and hospitality of the Irish people, who rightfully use this as their lifeblood to write poems, carry on amazing traditional music sessions, and appreciate nature. Ok ok, am I rambling here? To conclude, drink this in Dublin from a pint poured by an expert barman, rather than out of a can or in a car bomb. That'll be all, now.","raoulduke37","Jan 20, 2009"

Little carbonation visible. Smell was similar, just a touch of smoky malts. Initial tastes were quite different. Beamish was smooth in the mouth, with a well balanced, drinkable mix of malt flavors and a hint of sweetness that made it very easy to drink--top to bottom. The Guinness was similar, but with a bit more hops bitterness that soon turned to a metallic hint of alcohol as it warmed.

That being said, I can't help but love Guinness. It is still a remarkable beer. That pour, that cascade, that feeling when it hits you tongue, the ease with which it goes down, this is Guinness and nothing else is quite like it.

The aromas are very sharp and roasty of coffee, wheat, yeast, chocolate, and caramel. The colder it is, the more you can smell its chilled flavors. The taste is uniquely thin, especially for those flavors, with an overall dimension of bitter, coffee like sweetness. The mouthfeel helps perfect it, allowing the flavors to remain dry, thin and light. Overall, the draught of Guinness is very well known for a good reason. Very excellent.","fitzy84","Mar 15, 2008"

Guinness doesnt have much taste and certainly not aroma but something can be said about the importance of mouthfeel because thats the reason I used to drink it. And Im sure the reason why so many people still drink it. I think that mouthfeel is the most important attribute to the sense of "moreishness," and thats where guinness' strength is.

The taste is decent, but could use a bit more punch to it. There is a touch of roasted malt again and maybe a hint of coffee, but it is pretty thin. The body is as thin as the taste.

Eventually, it became a dark black with a finger thick head that was the color of the inside of a Whopper (the candy, not the burger). Decent lacing. However, the line where the drink itself and the head meet looked synthetically straight. Kind of took a lot of the soul out for me. Smell is kind of weak, but rather sweet-smelling. Taste is rather weak, especially for something labeled as a stout. Mildly sweet malts. Mouthfeel is slightly creamy, but closer to the consistency of water.

Although I was pretty impressed with the dual-color, dark, tan appearance, it basically went down-hill from there... a basically average, dry stout smell that wasn't too appealing led to a bitter and uninviting taste that had an even more astringent after-taste...

The lacing was almost indescribable...more a sticky, continuous coating vs. gobs & bits. Smeel and taste are cklassic guiness...heavily roasted malt and some mild hop bitterness.

It starts mildly sweet, and creamy, but the finish, especially as it warmed seem almost metallic. Mouthfeel was ok, think enough and creamy. Drinkability is a tough one, while it goes down smooth, and is not overly filling, the metallic taste at the end left my pallet a little ragged.

Basically, near black, beautiful cascading, incredibly durable head, foamy lacing. Smells much like the Guinness on tap, (creamy coffee, roasted nuts and ale hops) but with an unpleasant metallic tinge. This flavor comes out on the palate as well, and the characteristic Guinness sourness is also stepped up (I wonder if they put more "spoiled" beer into the vats meant for bottling than into those to be kegged).

Drinkability is not bad either because again there is just enough taste to keep you mildly interested while the low alcohol makes it highly sessionable.","fank2788","Jul 26, 2007"

Dark liquid, black with red hilights, and a thick and creamy, brown foam. Great retention and lacing rings are left behind. Not alot of aroma but there is some roasted malt and coffee. Taste is as expected from Guinness, thin almost watery, with flavor of toasted malt. Creamy smooth yet thin mouthfeel.

Having said all that, the nitro can is decent, creamy, and a reasonable take home alternative. The smell is a little tinny, but good and malty. The taste is water, roasted barley malt, and a little bit of tin. The lacing is excellent, if you want to call it lacing, in that it billows on the sides of your glass. There is no sweetness in this beer, very dry, all malt, no bitterness, lots of water. It isn't a strong beer by any standards and the alcohol taste is completely absent. The cream is good right out from the pour, but it does dissipate a bit towards the end of the pint glass. I like Guinness, always have, and it works in the right setting, complementing the right food. It's better on tap, and I'm sure better across the Atlantic, but if you crave a dry, malty, Irish stout, this is where you have to begin.

As it was poured into my Bell's pint glass, a creamy head instantly formed, with nitrogen bubbles cascading to the bottom of the glass. After settiling a bit, a creamy tan half inch head remains throughout the whole experience. The beer is very dark, hints of brown are visible when held to the light, but this brew is pretty opaque. Aroma presents a creamy roastyness, with a mild sour side. Not a whole lot of flavor. Dry, faint hints of roasted malt are present. There is a slight sourness to this beer, according to charlie papazian, guiness adds a bit of pasteurized sour beer to each batch of guiness. Overall a pretty bland tasting beer. The mouthfeel is decently thick, as a stout should be, but something seems to be missing, maybe not thick enough? This is an enjoyable brew, but unfortunately it costs about $8.50 for a sixer of 11.2oz bottle.

Taste is also light, just as it smells with some creaminess and bitter unsweetened cocoa and espresso notes.

Not much of anything in the nose and only a bit of roasted malt flavor in the taste. If I focus and let my imagination go wild, I can maybe fool myself into tasting some chocolate notes.

After a little research, I now understood the workings of the 'widget', what makes the head, and why it's so thick. Armed with all of that intelligence I still wasn't that impressed, especially with the taste. Something is missing. The taste is kind of bland. Maybe it's the soft mouthfeel of the nitrogen as opposed to the crispness of CO2. I'm thinking the shortcoming is more on the line of ingredients. I've had some killer Russian stouts. Hercules out of Belgium is outstanding. Bell's, from Kalamazoo, Mi., offers a great selection of stouts that blows this one away. Mix Guinness with a Bass ale to make a black and tan, or a Harp for a half and half, and that's a different story. That seems to liven it up a bit.

When I first started drinking Guinness in the standard bottles many years ago, it had a yeasty sludge in the bottom of the bottle and appeared to be bottle fermented and carbonated  a completely different drink. However, this is a classic as well. The mouthfeel is smooth and amazingly light for a stout. The taste starts with a sharp bite of carbonized grain, to a dry almost ethereal warmth, and end with a dry aftertaste. A bit of a very light chocolate overtone in the flavor and a bit smokey as well. Nothing quite like a Guinness. This is a very drinkable stout, although I couldnt slam as many Guinnesses as say Sweetwater 420 or other lighter beers.","TheEclecticGent","Feb 13, 2006"

4.33,23,4.5,4,4,5,5,"This beer came a dark brown that let a lot of light through giving it some burgundy highlights. The head was a lovely pale tan that was flat and creamy. Smells of delightfully toasted malts with a distinctive sweet and sourness behind it that I can only say smells like Guinness. Tastes initially of a cocktail of dry roasted malts that springs to life with a pleasantly subdued sweetness, and then finishes dry with a coffee and cream and a gentle nip of hops. The mouth feel is a silky thin to medium body and flat. The real kicker here is the little bit of head that makes its way into my mouth on each sip that simply floats along my palate. Thats invigorating and down right enjoyable! Whats not to love?","DarkerTheBetter","Feb 10, 2006"

During the entire pint, the head never diminished at all, and there was plenty left once the beer was gone, even after painting the inside of the glass with lacing. Deep dark, almost black, with ruby highlights. The smell is of faint roasted malts and little else. The taste is slightly bitter up front with deep roasted malt, almost charcoal like, in the finish. There was something almost sour about it. Light body and a generally smooth mouthfeel, it is also a bit drying. It is drinkable, and in the states it is becoming about the only nitro stout readily available in Irish-themed bars.","hopsaplenty","Feb 08, 2006"

I must say if you are not into microbreweries and trying new things instead of settling with a 'best' this beer seems to be the top of the chain for people. It's quite sad and silly. I have a friend who's irish, has red hair, and wears all sorts of celtic stuff and Flogging Molly shirts. He doesn't like other porters and always compares them to 'the best.' To me it's a beer you ought to try even have once in a while but to say it's The Best is a little over the top. I will say though that I have not yet enjoyed it off the tap. I have been told that this is the ONLY way to drink it. After then I can feel not full of myself. I bet it is better though. P.S. it is great though if you want to feel full after drinking a beer.

One would expect a heavier beer, given the color, but this is one great sessioner. Aroma was clean and slightly toasty. The Guinness Draught is simple and good, much lighter in flavor than other stouts. I don't know if it's comparatively light stout flavor complemented the oysters or if they oysters would have paired better with a richer, roastier, stout-ier stout.

Aroma is rather faint, save for a few subtlties, light roasted marshmallows, hint of chocolate and burnt coffee. Sour bitter flavor with light coffee, chocolate, roasty malts, tobacco. Rich and creamy on the palate with a clean, dry finish. One of the true gateway ales out there and a good one.

3.96,12.5,5,4,4,5,3,"I never would have assumed Guinness would appeal to me. Like I've said before, I have pretty moderate tastes. Mostly my beer preferences run to the moderate. Red/Amber Lagers and more recently, "white" (wheat) beers. I'm not generally into the really heavy, dark, bitter beers. So Guinness is was a pleasant surprise. Now first, let me say this is the single most appealing beverage I've ever seen. A lot of people use the comparisons to say motor oil to describe the appearance. I never understood that. From the very first time I saw Guinness, my first response was "whoa, nothing could possibly taste as good as that looks". For that matter, since I was watching TV, I thought nothing could look that appealing in person (not true as it turned out). Anyway, the smell is distinctive- carmalized malts and coffee. The taste is surpisingly pleasant. Rich, with some sweetness, and an uncanny similarity to strong coffee. Yes, it is quite bitter (which I usually don't enjoy), but the way the bitterness comes out makes it less objectionable. The bitterness is in the middle rather than the finish, and does not linger. I assume this is because the bitterness comes from the very dark malts rather than the hops. The mouthfeel is, like Guinness (or really like stout I guess) in general, unique but enjoyable. It is rich and thick, creamy even. The head is especially pleasant and creamy. Guinness is actually more drinkable than it seems, it goes down pretty well and even washes food down pretty well. But for some reason I find the taste and experience of this particular beer gets really old if I have more than one or two. So the drinkability is what I'd call mediocre. To me at least, Guinness is distinctively different, but quite pleasant. I don't really drink it often, and I definately don't rate this a good session beer, but its still very good and one or two of them every now and then hits a spot that nothing else I've yet had will.","casualbeerman","Dec 29, 2005"

The taste is bitter from the roasted malt, and black patent lends a smokey sour taste. A dry hop aftertaste becomes pronounced in the finish, but the drinkability remains high due to the light body and nitrogenration that create a creamy mouthfeel.

4.71,33.8,5,4,5,4.5,5,"Guinness is one of the most unique beers I have tasted. Even with its fame around the world as the leading Dry Irish Stout the Guinness Brewery continues to make a quality product. The nitro-bottle can be drunken straight form the bottle or poured into a pint glass (or smaller, the bottle holds 11.2 fl. oz, 0.8 oz must be used for the "rocket-widget"). The famed surge settles quicker from the bottle than form a nitro-forced tap, but it still flows into a tan creamy head. The smell is a bit on the sour side due to their souring technique, and few hops are detectable; just enough to balance out malt sweetness. The taste is something I have only found in a Guinness. The sour taste on top of the dry and roasted malt characteristics make this a complex beer whose flavors compliment each other. The mouth feel is smooth but not overly heavy; a common misconception due to Guinness's deep ruby color. This beer is very drinkable and does not leave a bloated or full feeling. A true winner for the average beer drinker looking for something other than Coors, Miller, or Bud; or for homebrewers looking for a good case at the beer distributor.","DevilDogBeer","Jul 28, 2005"

Mild, coffee/bitter aftertaste. Very drinkable. This would be a good beer to enjoy all night on tap, but in bottles at $8.50 per sixer, its of dubious value. (Note: drink them out of the bottle.

They're lightweight, and because the carbonation won't activate until opened, you won't generate ticking timebombs from constant movement on the trail. Unfortunately this was my only nitro-can option at my local grocery store. Oh well, I guess it could be worse. It poured an almost opaque black with the signature nitro cascading effect which leaves a creamy, albeit thin, beige head. Roasted barley is the only significant flavor and it is not particularly deep and palate coating. Overall the brew is pretty thin, even for a low alc, stout.

On the other hand, because this beer is fairly light and drinkable, it would make a great session beer (which cant be said about too many dry-stouts out there, IMHO). Also, the bottle says that this beer has less than 130 calories per 12oz serving, so for anyone on a diet, Id imagine that this is easily a much more flavorful choice than just about any other light beer out there.

Sure, I may have been about 17 years old when I last had a Guiness, but in those last 5 years it seems amazing that my perceptions could change THIS much. I remember a brew that was completely impermeable to all light and that was damn near completely intolerable because of the dryness and the bitter roastiness of the malt. Now all I taste is a creamy, watery substance with a very small residual hint of the roasted barley. The beer even shines through a small hint of ruby, though I suppose it is still dark enough that I could have exaggerated the intensity in my youth. The head is a sticky, creamy foam, actually looks quite appealing. The smell was decent too, but the richness of the aroma was lost in the taste, which as I said was like water. No dryness to be spoken of. No wonder so many masses of mindless Americans are able pound so much of this shit each year on the day where everybody suddenly thinks they are Irish. It wasn't totally bad, but for the stout I remember, it was VERY disappointing.

It's served just as cold in the pubs of Ireland (and I went to several throughout the west, south, and in Dublin) as it is here. The appearance makes this beer, while the lack of any sort of flavor beyond a bland feint, nondistinctive, cold coffee effect ruins the legend.

I mean it still has those typical Guinness things that you like; the nice classic Guinness appearance, the easy quaffability, etc... But it's really not that tasty to me anymore. There are better dry stouts. So I was thinking this last night and then my thoughts seemed to be backed up by the forum post about the declining quality of Guinness over the years.

Extra thin and very watery-feeling, the taste leaves a lot to be desired. There is somewhat of a stout flavor, but it is scarce and just too watery. It is also missing carbonation, I mean there is NONE to speak of at all. The mouthfeel and taste remind me of a 1/2 drank beer that gets shoved back into the fridge and then resorted to another 3 days later, only to find that its really not good anymore.

Perhaps a bit of very dark bread, also. To me, the mouthfeel is almost milky, with not enough of the carbonation or pepperiness that I enjoy. For that reason, I find Guinness to not be a very drinkable ale. I do quite enjoy a good stout, but for some reason I am not very fond of Guinness.

The lacing on the glass is incredible, you literally can't see the glass because it is covered by frothy lacing. The smell is of roasted malts with hints of mocha. The taste is very suprising, as I didn't like the Extra Stout offering from Guinness, this version is incredible, dark mocha flavors and caramel tones will bounce off the tongue, suprisingly refreshing.

However, when I purchased a sixer, I was disappointed to see that it was only 11.7 fluid ounces. I didn't realize this at first, since the Guinness ppl provided us with Guinness bottle covers at the ferry boat party. Also, the design of the bottle makes it look very attractive to those beer drinkers who go on appearence instead of quality.

The nose is small in aroma, light but pleasantly roasted malts that produce hints of coffee and chocolate, watery and hollow, in other words it smells like Guinness. The simplistic pleasantness of the bouquet is also found on the palate, roasty malts produce flavors of coffee and chocolate, sadly watery. The taste is adequate with enough flavors to inspire me to quaff this at the bar when a session beer is needed. The low abv is the most redeeming quality about Guinness in my opinion.

The aromas are a bit subdued compared to draught, but they are still nice. They consist of roasted malts, and slight hops.

Guinness used to be my standard ever since I was legal, I used to swear by it. Over the years it became a bit too much of a pop culture phenomenon, passe, and I've drifted away due to this image and in search of different stouts. Still, it's wonderful to come home like this.

The thick creamy head is very persistent (its there til the end), and sticks wherever it comes in contact with the glass. The smell is of roasted coffee with an oaky undertone. The taste is also of roasted malts with a coffee flavor. A bit of smokiness is also present. A very smooth and creamy mouthfeel leads to this being a rather drinkable beer.","tar","Jun 11, 2003"

Nevertheless, it pours a deep brown changing to black as it settles with a creamy white head. There is awesome head retention and lots of lacing. The smell has a roasted coffee aroma to it. The taste is a little bit of coffee with burnt malt. There isn't much hops noticeable. The mouthfeel is a little light due to the nitro. The drinkability is very good at 4.1%.

The drinkability as far as taste goes is great, but they do ten to fill you up a bit. I also love them floated over a nice cider or brown ale. I've had them in the nitro cans also which were pretty good (not as good as beamish) and the bottles which i felt were very un-impressive (way to watered down). on tap is the only way to have it.","DESTRO","May 24, 2003"

In a recent trip to North Ireland I gave myself a second chance on this stout. On tap, canned, etc. And It was, comparatively, fabulous. I underrated it the first time or did not have the palate for it, but for some reason it just tasted better- the range of flavours, the temperature, the pour- in NI.

Poured a black coffee like color with a VERY cream tan head.  Looks pretty nice.  Smells of roasted malt with a little caramel.  The taste is overwhelmed with the nitro creamy mouthfeel that just doesn't go well with this almost bland stout.

For a non-draft beer, it looks perfect.  Little to no noticeable aroma at first but warms to a faint roasted sour scent.  Taste is creamy but light, surprising those expecting a heavy beer. Unmalted barley taste evident and with slight sourness, finished with nice roasted taste.

Unfortuanely the beer doesn't smell or taste quite as good as some other stouts.  It's a creamy and full bodied beer, with a nice roasted malt aroma and flavor, and a nice upfront bite, but I find there to be a slightly unpleasant astringent aftertaste.

It poured with a thick off-white head and dark brown/near black color.  There was a nice malty aroma.  The first roasty flavored drink left excellent lacing.

Guinness' aroma is high with a coffee and dark chocolate tinge. From the first sip, this stout is satisfying and very much of a knife-and-fork mentality. A true beer fan must try this classic. I know it is rare for someone to give this brew a "5," especially someone who has tried as alot of different brews. But I cannot lie. This is my favorite. When I go to my favorite haunt, I get great pleasure from watching a PROFESSIONAL tap me a quality pint, the proper way. In my mind. It is THE beer in my book.

Not for the novice beer drinker, your typical mass produced drinker needs to work their way to this one.  Of course alot of the appeal has to do with the pour, a bartender that doesn't know what he/she is doing can ruin this beer.

I don't know why they reccomed to serve "very cold" or tell you to actually "drink it from the bottle"?  The smooth roast malt flavor is still there though...

Typically attractive for Guinness.  Malt notes are mild in aroma and are comprised of a hint of sharp, dark roasted barley sharpness, and a hint of chocolate malt. Light diacetyl comes through as the beer warms.  Roasted grain bitterness dominates the flavor, while hop bitterness seems to be more subdued when compared to draught Guinness.  Typically smooth nitro/CO2 mix induced mouthfeel.  The finish is soft, w/ less residual roasted grain bitterness than the draught version.  It's an okay dry stout, but even canned Guinness seems to have more character.","marc77","Jun 04, 2002"

This stout also features a surprisingly fruity aroma amidst the massive roasted malt nose. Deep, rich, and bitter with tinges of sourness and flavors of dark roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and malt. The version in the draught-can is somewhat thinner in body and less fruity and therefore more drinkable.","stoutman","May 27, 2002"

The beer has few flaws, but its boring.  It simply isn't an interesting brew.  The nitrogen-induced head is a gimmick, and the character has been dumbed down for Budweiser tastes.

It's like a painting. Smooth as any beer you can find, creamy, with mild bitter notes of chocolate and roasted malt. After a few is rather filling, but I would not say it is a heavy beer at all. Finally have sampled Guinness in Ireland, and I don't know if it's the atmosphere of that beautiful country or the wonderful pubs and people, but Guinness is one of the most enjoyable things in Ireland, more than anywhere else.

It's still a good stout, but if you stick it next to a Shakespeare Stout, it's no contest.

In an attempt to garner even more of the market it is giving its flagship beer a black eye.  Part of the beauty of a pint of Guinness is in the pour, the cascade and that fact that you're in a pub.
