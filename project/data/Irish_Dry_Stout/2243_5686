I think I envisioned it to be a little too good, but the Oyster Stout is still one of the best stouts I've ever had, and I love stouts. Creates an amazing foamy head that is thick and cream, and the body's flavor, including the hints of real oysters, is like nothing I've ever had before.

Pours fairly crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, toffee, herbal, and yeast/roasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of roast/bready malt notes; with decent strength. Taste of chocolate, caramel, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light coffee, herbal, salt, and roast/mineral earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light coffee, salt, herbal, and roast/mineral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of roasted/bready malt and moderate earthy hop flavors; with decent robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and lightly creamy/chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a pretty good stout. Good complexity and solid robustness of roast/bready malt, earthy hop, and salty oyster flavors; and very smooth to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 05, 2014"

3.54,-3.8,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"I first read about oyster stouts in a book by Roger Protz, learning that these beers very rarely contain actual oysters today; most modern examples contain a little shell material or just carry the moniker because of the historical association. This one is apparently legit. Poured from the bottle into an English pub glass, this is a dark blackish brown brew with yellowish highlights and around two fingers of bubbly beige head. Aroma evokes caramel, light molasses, maybe a small measure of singed barley, and a wispy but nevertheless palpable sea salt note. Palate is expectedly dry and rather toasty. I get some licorice, faint aromatic wintergreen, medicinal iodine, chocolate ""Tootsie Roll"" candy, light roast weak coffee, and white pepper spice. The latter element lingers through into the roasted dry finish, which also features some earthy hops. It seems that other reviewers struggle to taste the oysters but I do get a different flavor here that makes this one stand apart from other Irish dry stouts. I agree that the beer does not taste overly briny but certainly this is not a Guinness. Body is chalky and dry with a mild metallic tang pervading the whole proceedings, along with a flinty calcium bite. Cool experience if not an acquired taste.","CalgaryFMC","Mar 12, 2014"

Obviously, this can be done well if one was to balance the meaty salts with nice, robust candi sugar and rich grain profile. Also, worth mentioning: this tastes like the same recipe used to brew their regular Stout, but with the subtle addition of oysters. It also reminds me of Guinness: boring and safe. Overall, rather bland. After having intense, true-to-style Oyster Stouts similar to those made by Upright Brewing and others, this just really pales in comparison. Won't be buying again.","Agent1","Feb 02, 2014"

Nearly black, almost opaque, small head after the initial pour, no lacing. The smell is okay - salty, almost earthy, briny... a tiny bit of chocolate, and mostly... a cloying and alien sweetness. Perhaps also, some oxidized essence. When drinking, the smooth mouthfeel is the best part. Too acidic, salty, and most of all, too sweet. Even though I am inexperienced in Oyster Stout tasting...

It shows a semitransparent dark black-brown color with a giant, thick and creamy tan head and very good sporadic but chunky lacing follows. I pick up mild wheat-malt and vague charcoal grass in the nose hit but it’s a bit weak, definitely not bold. The first taste brings a charcoal flavor with oyster shell edges and floral grass hop hints. I also pick up some grape/wine ideas. There's a chalky feel on the surface of this medium light bodied stout with modest carbonation, very much a cask ale feel. Not bad, although there's a very slight touch of soapiness and its a bit thin for my tastes. Decent flavor overall.","Durge","Mar 17, 2013"

On a hot day the briney oyster made this just the right beer. The cask was cold for most casks which appeased me on a hot day. The stout minus the oyster is also excellent. In fact, the stout minus the oyster would blow a Guinness away because it is not nearly as off-putting bitter and had great malty chocolate coffee.

After a vigorous poor into a Hennepin glass the bear foamed into a nice but too fluffy 2.5 finger head. The head held its ground well and yielded a nice lace, but was not the creamy dense head I expected. The scent was earthy without any sea, which I expected. Some overcooked coffee in the nose, and a hint of toffee, no chocolate that I really hoped for. The appearance was nice and dark, but not black and lacking that deep glow I love in a good stout. The taste was dominated by dark overcooked coffee, but in a nice, down home way. After it warmed a bit there was a slight sweetness like dried fruit, plumb and bitter grapes, again just a hint sweet. There was a bit of low tide in the background but not the sea flavor I was hoping for in my first taste of an oyster stout. The dram was a bit warming, with no noticeable alcohol, more like a warm loaf of pumpernickel bread. In all a decent stout, not much different than the masses out there, definitely more expensive than most. The best part was the cap, but that doesn't last long.","Beowolf1911","Dec 30, 2011"

Aroma is roasted malt, coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and an aroma that I can't identify. I assume that's from the oysters, but I could be wrong about that. This brew tastes good, I can taste roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, and a minerally and slightly salty taste that I'm pretty sure comes from the oysters. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, but it does seems a bit thin for a stout. Good carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth, a little bit slick and goes down easy. In my opinion this brew wasn't quite as good as Harpoon's Island Creek Oyster Stout, but it's still a good brew and definitely worth a try. I'd buy this again in the future.","bluejacket74","Jul 01, 2010"

4.08,10.9,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"About the taste of actual oysters ... there's nothing briny, salty, savory in there at all. Even if they do throw a handful in the barrel, it seems that it's just for show. That ultra-smoothness is a result of nitrogen...","emerge077","Jun 18, 2010"
4.05,10.1,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Had a bottle with my dessert panino at Tria. With the extra strength and body (compared to other Irish stouts), this beer came off a bit more like an English stout. I suppose that body could be from the oysters. Anyways, the stout had a lot more earthy and herbal taste than most, but it was still capped off by black roasted grains. Overall, this beer was interesting, delicious, and a great way to cap off a meal.","tempest","Jun 06, 2010"
4.47,21.5,4.5,5,4.5,4,4,"The last time, and also the first time, I tried Oyster Stout, I was a touch disappointed, but that was most likely because I had heard many a soul rant and rave about how this was the best beer ever produced in the history of humanity, and nothing could ever have lived up to the expectations I had allowed to develop in advance of my trip to Dublin in 2008, so I was looking forward to reacquainting myself with the Oyster Stout. Again the actual beer was a deep ruby red, although the head was rockier than the Wrasslers. The usual stout aromas abounded, chocolate and coffee front and centre, but there was something else, lurking in the background, something I couldn't place. The only thing I could think of was that it had a touch of the sea about it, somewhat akin to the Islay whiskies, perhaps that was pure suggestion, but there we go. As far as drinking goes, this is lighter than the Wrasslers, but full of flavour and with a long bitter finish, simply put it is great drinking and beats the stuff on nitro in Dublin.","velkyal","Jun 04, 2010"

4.15,12.8,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Lighter body, but fills the mouth nicely. Carbonation is just prickly enough to keep it lively and easy drinking. Not real filling, could put down a few of these. A nice example.","Bung","May 06, 2010"
4.15,12.8,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a nice deep brown color with some decent initial head and a bit of nice lacing throughout. Nice scent, some nice deep dark malts (roasted grains); a nice clean stout scent. Good taste, a nice semi-roasty sweet maltiness with an interesting slight mineral taste from the oysters; nothing fantastic, but it is a solid stout. Goes down very smooth, and even with the slight oyster mineral taste, I could have several of these at a long sitting.","JamesS","May 02, 2010"

If I had two sixers of this smashing 5.2%abv stout I wouldn't be writing this right now... I'd be on my porch listening to Tom Waits' ""Nighthawks at the Diner"" live album, smoking a cigarette, getting wonderfully potzed to a wonderful beer to a wonderful album. God, someone bless America! And Ireland, while we're at it. After all, they made this damn delicious beverage. I was even ready to write this silly thing off after reading its labels. The word ""Irish"" appears, like, forty times on the front label alone... (okay... a little artistic license there). SOOO glad I looked past that one pretentious quality of the packaging. Do yourselves a favor... if you see this beer anywhere... BUY IT!!! Besides that, it's pretty good.","sudsellier","Apr 23, 2010"

It was not very pleasant. Had I cleansed my palate with an other beer before leaving perhaps this not would have happened, but it was definitely a downer. This is a good beer and worth trying, but the Plain Porter they brew is fantastic as well and I would take that over the Oyster any day.","AWolfAtTheDoor","Apr 03, 2008"

3.63,-1.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This is a fairly standard, well-crafted, medium-bodied stout that has a slight sea-water taste to it.

I think I really do smell fresh sea oysters! This is a very aromatic drink, esp once it warms and opens up. Sweet butter english tofee. Smoky Irish peat. Dry roasted African coffee. I really liked the aromas. Taste was also good but not quite as amazing. Tons of roasty flavors with a definite salty, oyster edge to it. I had a few pints of this one and enjoyed them quite nicely.","granger10","Mar 14, 2006"
3.71,0.8,5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"T&M: a hint of sea-water kind of slightly salty flavour comes through with a creamy texture of roasted malts--slightly smoked but also refreshing along with ""floating"" hoppy presence on the palate. Lightly savoury-sweet finish on top of residual, low-level bitterness of dark malts. Overall it's medium-bodied and medium-flavoured, while its creamy smooth texture is not compromised by oysters but apparently thinner than XXXX Stout. It could be more dark malty and roasted bitter to be really flavoursome, but I can imagine that it pairs well with fresh oysters all the same!","wl0307","Nov 30, 2005"

3.82,3.8,3,3.5,4,4,4,"A complex stout. Black colour. Toasted aroma, ligthly caramel. The taste is less toasted, but with licorice and vanilla. Smooth and aromatic.
