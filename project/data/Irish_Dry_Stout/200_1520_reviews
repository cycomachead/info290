"Of course there is roast but there is some hops too. Has some lacing to it. You can see light through it in a pint glass if you hold it up to one. A fact I like."

"Initial taste is very flat. There is a hint of chocolate and coffee in the after taste, but there is also a lager or a metal taste at the end too. It's alright"
"A mild yet deceptively complex dry stout that drinks easily and satisfies the senses."
"07/11/13 At Rattle N Hum, NYC. On tap. Just a taste was enough for me. Member#28419's comment re Mentos & Coke was close to the mark. Lacks body & depth. Doubt I could struggle through a pint. Rate Beer touts ""bottle condition""ing so perhaps I judge too harshly. Let's try to put the Genie back in the bottle 'cause this don't cut it."

"Great Stout, great flavor, very drinkable"
"Typical dry stout hoppiness up front, but a pleasant creamy finish."

"The Black Hawk stout...has a great name #1...as in the #1 hockey team in the NHL...but is also a solid stout. The beer pours an opaque black with thin slightly offwhite head that is leaving a spotty lace. The scent carries chocolate and peat. The taste is more leaning towards espresso. The mouthfeel is fuller in body with smooth carbonation. Overall this is a solid beer."

"Assertive beer, but quite flavorful and very enjoyable. In my opinion it is under rated, and definitely I would drink this over Guinness."

"O: Not a fan, really. Hoppy stouts need to have a nice backbone of malt and hop flavors, not weak caramel with a ton of generic bitterness. Guess which one this achieves?"

"O-decent stout, needs bigger flavor, but enjoyables"

"Overall - This is my second go-around with this beer, and while I've enjoyed it more this time, it still doesn't quite hit the spot. It's a beer I don't mind drinking, so long as I don't have to pay for it."

"Pitch black in color with a thin brown head. Lightly carbonated. Mild coffee aroma with not much else going on. Light to medium bodied, a bit on the light side for a stout. More coffee notes from the roasted malt. The low carbonation makes for a bit of a flat feeling on the tongue. All in all, a very average stout."

"O- I enjoyed this one, its super drinkable and even sessionable. Roasted notes along with some sweet chocolate match well."
""
"Overall Drinkability: I like this, since it's a bit different."
""
"Pours pitch black with a thick, creamy, tan head. Excellent retention and lacing all the way down. Very fine bubbles in the head. Aroma is nice, roasted malt, caramel, and chocolate notes. Taste is good, bitterness from the darker malts comes through, coffee and chocolate notes as well. Slightly sweet up front with a lingering bite reminiscent of dark chocolate. Not bad, just not very different from many other stouts. Low to medium in carbonation, full body, and a creamy smooth mouthfeel. Overall a very nice beer for an end to a cold day like today."

""
"The beer is medium bodied and easy to drink, but certainly nothing special."
""
"O; Acceptable, for sure."
""
"O - I would drink a lot of other Irish Dries before this one, but it works. Cheers."
"Drinkability: Don’t let the corny label fool you. This is solid stuff."
""
""
""
""
"Smell was roasted malt, bordering on smoky. Taste was initially creamy and slightly sweet but roasted malt was assertive driving underlying chocolate and coffee characteristics. A bit earthy. Medium body. Dry finish. An okay Irish stout certainly, though nothing memorable."

"This is an easy to drink, flavorful beer. The citrusy character threw me off a bit, but overall I enjoyed it."
""
"O: While the Irish Dry Stout style doesn't exactly lend itself to greatness, Mendocino does a decent, but not spectacular job with this beer."

"Black Hawk Stout - The bottle says: “This award winning brew is Handcrafted to perfection. A Premium American Classic from a Pioneer Brewing Legend.”"

"O: Not a bad stout, pretty middle of the road. Got a 12oz bottle as a gift, probably wouldn't have tried it otherwise. Glad I did though. Not sure if I'd get a six pack of it, but I'd definitely drink it again if the chance arose."

"- I got this in my beer of the month collection and it is definitely a solid stout, but it didn't blow me away."
""
"o - Overall a decent beer. Was surprised by the light sour dark fruit in the taste; judging by other reviews I'm guessing this is not intended, though I kind of liked it. Tried it next to O'Hara's Irish Dry Stout on cask and O'Hara's was much better...I might have to revisit my review of O'Haras."
""
"O:  I'm not a huge fan of the style (i prefer my stouts Russian and Imperial) but this one was actually pretty good.  IMO much better than the Guiness and Murphys standards of the style.  Nothing spectacular but worth a try.  "
""
""
""
"Slightly sweet malt taste. Watery. Roasted malt flavor. Dry on the finish with a malty twang. This beer isn't really worth a full review because there's not much to describe."

"O- really underrated dry stout, very sessionable."

"Overall - The beer has some very nice qualities for the style, but then others really put away from its greatness. Overall fairly average"

"Good stout but a bit too dry for me."
"While I probably won't buy this again as there are better, readily available stout options in my area, this was better than I anticipated."
""
""
"Dr: Quite drinkable, in part due to its flawed mouthfeel. I could session this all night but I wouldn't want to. It'd be a bit better on nitro-draught, if only to bring out more cream. It's forgettable as a stout, but I enjoyed it for what it was."
""
""
"O: Overall, this was a decent beer, but not great. However, it was very drinkable and went down smooth. I would give this beer a second chance (my taste buds are influenced by my mood at the time), I just dont see myself buying it again any time soon."

"The feel of this beer is smooth and does have a nice drinkable feel as you drink it. Without seeing the label and seeing that is was labeled a stout I would have thought porter which confuses me slightly but none the less does have some nice qualities that make for a decent beer. This beer seems to promise more but does not live up to the expectations."
"Overall I can think of better stout offering and would prefer the RIS over this. Forgettable stout."
"Overall-Just an average beer all around. Flavors are pretty subtle and body is very thin. I'll finish the 6er but will probably never encounter this beer again."
"O- Although the look was nice and the smell was interesting, the taste was a little mellow and the mouthfeel was too light and thin for a stout. Mediocre drinkability."
"This beer is tasty, drinkable, and affordable. It didn't amaze me, but I'll buy it again. I'll have to pair it with some dark chocolate some day."
"Wonderful malty stout aroma, pours a thick creamy beige head that truly lasted a long spell, gracefuly laced the glass. Deep black opaque in color. More on the slightly sweet side with a hint of hops, slight bitter aftertaste that lingers quite a while, hence lower mouthfeel score. A very drinkable brew!"
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch frothy tan head. Head retention is great, and there's a lot of lacing left on the glass, too. The brew smells like roasted malt, chocolate, and some coffee. Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, it's all roasted malt, coffee and bittersweet chocolate. There's also a nice roasty bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little slick and creamy with good carbonation. I think this brew is more like an Irish style stout than an American one. If you're looking for a good, easy drinking mostly bitter stout then this is a good choice. I bought a single bottle of this for $1.55, and I'd certainly consider buying a 6 pack of this in the future. I wouldn't have any problem drinking a sixer of this in a session!"
"Overall - not a bad brew at all, but not terribly interesting, except for the noticeable hops."
"The beer pours a dark brown to black color with a tan head. The aroma is a mix of chocolate and roasted malt. The beer smells about like I expect an American Stout to smell. The flavor is heavy on the chocolate malt with some roasted malt. There are also some medicinal notes in the flavor, somewhat resembling menthol or spearmint. Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"This beer poured out as a deep black color with a tan color head on top. The lacing wasn't too bad here either. The smell of the beer has a pleasant roasted aroma coming off it it. The flavors of the beer have some dark malts, coffee and a touch of bitter chocolate on the tongue. The mouthfeel I though could have been a little thicker. Overall this stout wasn't too bad."
"A plain stout but a really good one. I wouldn't mind seeing this on tap instead of Guinness in every bar."
"Dark and black with a nice, creamy tan head that fades fast but leaves nice walls of lace. The smell is of roasted coffee with some nutty notes, dark chocolate and some earthy hints. Caramel laces throughout. The taste is full of caramel with hints of toffee, dark cocoa and coffee with robust roasted malts dominating. Its smooth, balanced, creamy, and easy to drink. Doesn't knock my socks off, but a great mild stout."
" Very nice robust caramel smell mixed with aromas of coffee and hints of roasted nuts and a touch of chocolate. Overall not bad. First impression was really just the perfect carbonation, great frothy and fluffy mouthfeel and just all around benefit to the palate. Lots of caramel flavors and again a bit of a smoked hint at the back. Small flavors of roasted nuits, chocolate and hints at black coffee. Very nice, but the mouthfeel was absolutly pefect. Light, balanced, a drinkers stout."
"Overall: A good mild craft stout. It is definitely more characteristic than Guinness or other mass market stouts but it isn't a standout stout either. A good attempt by the Mendocino brewery. A completely inoffensive beer that I might overlook simply because I rarely drink stouts."
"This has little complexity and is a bit thin on flavor. Bitter coffee up front, with a sour twang. Some bitter chocolate and seltzer-like flavors in the middle, clean long bitter finish. Nothing outstanding, but quite average. Feels like a porter. A bit thin bodied for the style. I'm ok with it, but won't get again."
"One thing about the glut of beer on the market today is that there's a glut of average beer on the market. There's nothing wrong with this stout, but there's nothing very interesting about it, either. It's dark, it's slightly roasted, it has a somewhat dry finish... it tastes like coffee and wet ropes. More of same. There's no harm in drinking it, but... why bother? This stout is but one of the many ho-hummers you will drink as you seek something better."
"Notes: This one may leave some die hard stout lovers wanting more but it is decent for the price range and may be a nice beginner stout."
"o - if i hadn't burned my taste buds out today i'm sure this would be better. but it lacks some flavor. it's kinda week overall."
"Although the flavor is behind everything else, I would recommend this as an introduction to the style for someone new, it truly is not bad"
"Poured a deep dark muddy black with a huge frothy tan head that produced some really good lacing. The aroma was of dark roasted bread malts, a resin hop and a meaty yeast with notes of dark chocolate, coffee and molasses. It tasted a little bitter-sweet with a hint of molasses and chocolate at first and finished with a bitter coffee flavor that had a strong dark chocolate presence at the end. Mouthfeel was very full in body and nice, smooth and creamy texture with a flat carbonation. Overall this stout was exceptionally smooth with a very nice flavor from beginning to end."
"This is a beer to enjoy once in a while, after dinner or on a nice cold night next to a fire pit. Not a session beer but easy drinking."
"The flavor is again a little underwhelming, with a dry peppery undercurrent that saps some of the flavor's better points. Spent coffee grounds come to mind far too often. Thin, not horribly so, but definitely leaning that way. Not much like an American stout. Weak effort."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is black, with some dark brown highlights under light, and a light tan head that starts thick and frothy, but recedes to a decent half inch, tightly bubbled presentation. The beer is malty on the nose, with no other characteristics jumping out. The malt has notes of molasses and caramel, but very mild. Initial flavors are light, and ride through on a clean, crisp body. There are flavors heavy on chocolate, with strong backgrounds of coffee and dark, sweet malt. Well balanced with bitter and sweet flavors. Body is smooth and crisp at the same time, never overpowering and alway complementary of the flavors. The beer transitions to a quick, smooth, and clean finish. The aftertaste is similar to melting a chocolate bar in half a cup of coffee. Very tasty, and very pleasant. Easy to drink with almost anything in terms of food."
"D: The lack of a heavy body makes this beer quite drinkable compared to others in the style."
"D: Pleasantly surprised by this beer, I enjoyed everything about it, esp the deep, especially the roasty aroma and taste."
"I always have, always will love this stout. Reasonably priced, reasonably bitter, reasonably malty, and just plain reasonable. It may not be the most impressive thing I've ever tasted, but if I want an all-night stout, which I often do, this is my choice - hands down."
"T/M: Strong chocolate and coffee malts, slight sweet and smoky. Low carbonation with a medium body that becomes a bit heavy over time."
"D - Apart from all of the negatives that I feel work against the intended style, this is not a terrible beer. There are certainly better examples of American Stouts that I would pick up before this one, but I could sit down and drink more than one of these in a sitting."
"D - Fairly easy to drink overall. A nice amount of flavors that stay well balanced. Pretty smooth and crisp."
"Almost more of a dark scottish ale of some sort. Not bad, just a bit different for the style."
"The one-dimensionality is not the problem, but the harsh patent malt is. It's a little too much ash. My first from Mendecino even though I love the place."
"Really, like I mentioned: Malta Goya/Dragon Stout mix. Does not remind me of a Guinness/Murphy's Irish stout style. A bit disappointing maybe, but hardly awful."
"Not a bad beer, really; but by far not one of the best ones I've had either."
"I guess I will have to pick up more to see if it is a really good one, because this bottle seems like an under pressurized reject."
"Not a bad stout, though it could benefit from a little more heft, and backbone."
"Poured from the bottle into a snifter a dark opaque coffee color. Head is slightly off white and dissipates quickly to a crown. Smell is slightly smoked with the coffee malts. Taste is much the same with the similar light smoky flavor with the coffee malts. Feel is smooth with a crispness to the carbonation and a full body. Overall a good stout, the smokiness caught me a bit off guard though."
"Pours a dark cola brown nearly black, light mocha tan head with chunky sporadic lacing clinging to the sides of my glass. Aroma is a bit muted dark roasted malts herbal hops and dark chocolate with hints of anise. Flavor contains bitter chocolate roasted malt character with herbal hops and a nice black roasted malt nuttiness about it, finishes like herbal tea. Mouthfeel is mediumm bodied carbonation is light but carries the body well, nothing offensive here. Drinkability isn't bad moderate alcohol nice flavor profile this is something I could drink without difficulty."
"Notes: A nice stout with a good balance. Quite tasty. Good amount of chocolate and roasted malt. Hints of other stout flavors. Overall a tasty beer and a good example of a basic stout. Didn't overly impress me, but I enjoyed drinking it."
"Overall: I was surprised at how fruit driven this beer was. Dark roast plays into secondary flavors. Mouthfeel really hurts this beer, wondering if I got a bad bottle. Overall, not a bad beer, not one I would seek out in the future."
"Drinkability - Relatively sessionable. After reading other reviews you'd expect this to be not that good, but honestly, it isn't bad at all. Perhaps the three years of cellaring this helped it out but overall a pretty good and sessionable stout."
"Overall: Overall it's a pretty good stout. Nice bitterness for a stout but didnt have enough sweetness for me."
"I wasn't expecting much after seeing the (lack of) head. However, it is a decent stout that I could see myself buying locally if I could."
"Poured dark brown into a pint glass with a very thin chestnut head, bad retention, and modest lacing. The aroma consisted of caramel, chocolate, and various nutty flavors. The taste certainly revealed walnut, hazelnut, milk chocolate, and coffee, with a thin finish. In fact, much more thin-bodied than expected, with modest carbonation. Sessionable, but still a little too thin for my taste."
"Aroma was unremarkable, mostly a slight coffee or dark chocolate. Pours a very dark brown, with a hint of amber. Mouthfeel is pretty nice, not too thin. Overall this tastes much different than sweeter, creamier stouts like Murphy's and Guinness, but I think it's worth a try."
"Moderate carbonation and a very light, smooth mouthfeel. Toasty chocolate malts and cream followed by a slightly bitter coffee finish. Easy-drinking, if not exactly groundbreaking."
"Its a good price, pretty accessible without dumbing the style down. This is kind of like your #2 or 3 starter in baseball. He's gonna eat some innings and be very reliable at a decent price tag."
"A slight bitter coffee taste. There isn't much sweetness to cut through the bitter, but the bitter takes place deep into the swallow making this a creamy, almost light-bodied beer that goes down easy."
"Final Notes: A decent stout though nothing really special. Would probably go good with barbecue or nice, hearty food. I'd drink it if it was offered to me, but I won't go looking to buy this beer."
"Drinkability: A decent stout. It's nothing particularly memorable but pretty solid nonetheless."
"Overall, not what I expected as this was labeled as an American stout here on BA. This leans toward the Irish dry stout category although the ABV is a little high if that was the brewer's intent. Decent, not great."
"Bought this as a part of a mixed six-pack of mendacino beer. This is not favorite stout but it was enjoyable. Very dark in color. Decent aroma but the flavor is a litte less aggressive than I'd like. At the low abv it is a very drinkable beer. I would recommend it."
"Yikes. I've had a number of beers way worse, but this is just one of those that does not suit my liking. You really should love an ashy, over-smoky stout to find this appealing, but unfortunately this is not my bag. Hopefully the Hawks aren't this dissappointing tonight!"
"I had this with some Thai food, but honestly, it was not a very good combination. I'm thinking this would go better with desserts, such as chocolate cake or cherry pie."
"D- a very filling beer. It is quite heavy but it goes down fairly easy."
"Pours almost black with an airy, fluffy tan head that dwindles down to a thin ring. Smell is modest, minerally with a faint malt odor. Taste is as modest as the smell, a bit of fresh, dry coffee bean with a tongue load of bitter flavor at the end. A decent semi-sweetness occurs as well. Finish is actively carbonated, and the hops linger around a while. Balance is just ""off"" with this beer. Big stout taste is lacking IMO. Good for a try, though."
"D - Easy drinking - abv is manageable. Not overwhelming flavors to the palette. Not filling. The tartness does begin to wear however."
"Drinkability: This is a unique (though not exactly unconventional) stout. Definitely worth it."
"D- not really a good example of the style. i dont think ill be seeking this one out. not a fan of the brewery except for the winter seasonal IIPA. the price point is ok at 6.99/sixer."
"D: This beer is average in every way except the mouthfeel which really is unpleasant. Too thin to be imperial but too smooth and oily to be pleasant. This is just stuck in an unhappy middle. I won't be having this again, there are better stouts out there."
"Pours a dark mahogany/almost black color with 1 finger of brownish head that faded quickly to a ring. Smells slightly grainy, with more prominent notes of roasted malt and bitter chocolate. Tastes is initially slightly bitter with a nice roasted malt flavor and goes out with a lingering, astringent, slightly harsh bitter finish. Body is medium with nice creaminess and drinkability is OK, hurt mostly by the finish, which is funny because the bottle claims that the finish is clean and dry. Dry - yes, clean - not so much."
"D - due to the overall lightness and okay flavor this stout is very drinkable. Good for an evening party or card game. However, since the flavor is do light, if you are only having one or two you might want to opt for something else."
"Drinkability/Overall - Sessionable, but there are better stouts"
"It's a dark beer night tonite, so this one fits the bill. Let's give it a whirl. Popping the top this brew yields a nice black licorice and chocolate smell.It pours to an opaque black with a big foamy head that slowly craters. Taste stays in tune with the black licorice and roasted malts. There is hopping but it barely can claw through the maltiness. The aftertaste is very different with a twang that hits the roof of the mouth then fading to a chaulky bitterness on the tongue. A good stout but a little too funky."
"Drinkability: This is a low alcohol, sessionable stout. Nothing bad here, but nothing too good either. Really goes downhill after you smell it."
"Pours basically pitch black with a short mocha colored head, thin brown lace. Smell is more sharp bitter, burnt malt than malt sweetness. Some coffee apparant in the smell and taste. More charred malt in the taste. Lots of roasted and burnt flavors, not really ant malt sweetness to speak of. Finishes slightly bitter, almost charcoal-like. Medium body, moderate carbonation, dry but not really a smooth finish. Paired well with a sweet dessert that helped cut the slightly sharp acrid finish."
"Drinkability: This beer really just did not come together for me. It seems as though the flavors were too separated within the beer. The smell really threw me off and while the taste was better, I was still only thinking it was ok at best. I will be passing on this."
"Notes: This would be a good mild sessionable stout. If you are looking for something big and bold, continue to look elsewhere, but it is enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Goes down well. Typical stout aftertaste, but not overwhelming and somewhat dry. I'd drink this beer again, although it wouldn't be my first stout choice."
"D: Wholly unimpressive, but decent enough. The flavors are very basic, with nothing off-putting at all, but also extremely unremarkable."
"Poured into a shaker pint. Black, no light shines through but was surprised by the small head that disapatted quickly into a thin film. Not your traditional stout taste. A little coffee bitterness but acts more like a crisp bubbly ale. Despite the film it laces nicely. Hoppy after-taste to it. Light taste considering it is as black as midnight."
"D: I found this to be an OK, but not great stout. Too mild for my tastes. Actually, it tastes to me more like a dark mild than a stout. The low ABV, makes for easy consumption."
"Flavor is pretty bland. A little watered down almost. Like basic stouts, but not as bitter on the back end. High carbonation at very cold temps, but eases out as it warms. Decent stout, nothing special."
"Pitch black colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is cocoa.Taste is chocolate,smoked malts and cream.It has a decent taste although it is kind of watery.If it was a litle heavier it probably would be an awesome beer.I would recommend and purchase again."
"All told, the taste was the best part. This beer had a really solid flavor, but the other departments were lacking a little. Still in all, not a bad brew overall."
"Nice light to medium body and really smooth. The moderate carbonation seemed to fit nicely and made this really easy to drink. Mostly dry finish with some residual bitterness."
"Taste: Sweet malty flavor with a nice roasted taste, that doesn't taste like the burnt smell. The sweetness was a little more powerful then the roasted part but pretty good."
"pours deep black with a one finger tan head. the smell is pretty weak, but i can pick out some black malt and chocolate aromas. taste is pretty average for a stout. good roasted characteristics, with just a hint of floral hoppiness (just a hint mind you). mouthfeel is good, if slightly watery. ends dry. drinkability okay. pretty average stout on all points."
"D- Simple, clean beer with nothing special."
"d: while not the best, it's certainly not the worst. I would probably return to this one if I saw it in the fridge, but it would not be my first choice for a memorable stout (or beverage in general)."
"Seems a little simple, but I'm not complaining. This is good."
"salud!"
"Drinkability: An awesome go-to stout for anybody, I love Mendocino's courage to let the hops flourish in this offering as it really sets it apart from other stouts on the shelf. Low ABV makes this overly drinkable without throwing in a boring factor, as this actually can be had more the once in a single night. Overall a perfectly balanced beer that will be a regular in my fridge for a long time."
"T- Mild sourish taste. Very vibrant, crisp maltiness to it, with limited smokeyness, which I like in a stout. Kind of refreshing, actually."
"People who don't like deep thick stouts may find this beer agreeable, those looking for dark thick depth, will be left wanting more."
"I was not a big fan of this stout, until it warmed up a little... Not a bad stout but not a fantastic stout.... This is my first brew from Mendocino... I'm curious..."
"Overall I perfer other stouts, but this isnt bad, its just not exceptional."
"This is a decent beer. It really needs better carbonation though. Maybe that would improve the head."
"D - Not a bad go at the stout category but not something I'd want much of if more than one. It's a mediocre beer that has no real standout qualities but follows American Stout guidelines fairly well."
"It may lack the depth of the big guns as well as their complexity, but it's a good stout and worth giving a try."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with no expiration date or lot code anywhere to be seen. Sampled on July 12, 2009. As it pours from the bottle it has a brown color but once it fills the pint glass it is near black like molasses. A little tan head tops the brew and dissoles but not entirely. The aroma is like smoked or roasted malts, coffee grinds, and a dash of hops on the tail end. The taste gives off a burnt sensation with roasted malts and a subtle dry hop finish. I found it to be smooth and enjoyable."
"D: enjoyable. not what I'd think of when choosing American Stout but certainly has its place. Terrific price to boot."
"A black color pour with a thin off white head , light crbonation, little to no lacing. Aroma of roasty grain , burn toffee ,and coffee. Flavor is rather bland, roasted grain,some hoppiness , slightly bitter , coffee , and charcoal. Thin body , watey mouthfeel , dry slightly bitter finish. Drinkable but nothing I would buy again ."
"Complex, quite good but not outstanding."
"M/D--Not overly heavy-bodied. Poured syrupy, but not as bad on the palate. Distinct hoppy spice and bitterness gives this nice bite and a drying effect. Well balanced. Because of this, I can and will enjoy drinking several of these."
"Drinkability- A good stout for warm weather."
"Drinkability: Not the thickest of stouts that I have had. Very smoothe to drink. I don't think I could have more than two of these, but it was very good."
"D: Very easy to drink for a pretty big beer. Balance sets up drink after drink."
"Overall, nothing special."
"12 ounce bottle that is poured into my standard shaker glass. Deep dark brown in color with a finger of tan foam. Smells and tastes of rich roasted grains, a hint of molasses, mocha, and bitter cocoa. A notch or two below medium in body with ample carbonation. Overall, a decent stout that's worth a try."
"Pours black with little head. Smells slightly sweet and somewhat roasty with lightly nutty and chocolatey notes. Fairly good balance between roasty notes and some bitterness in the taste. Definite notes of bitter chocolate which is pleasant, and a dusty note on the finish which is a little distracting. Pretty smooth with som light sweetness up front and some dry bitterness on the finish. Not bad at all, and definitely drinkable and quite dry."
"12 oz. bottle poured into a tumbler glass. Pours a cola brown color with a decent light-brown head, pretty good lacing. Aroma is mainly malts, bread, nutty, roasted, and a slight hint of coffee. Flavor is mainly roasted malts, a touch of coffee and a slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is kind of watery with a decent bitter finish. A little too watery for my tastes, but a pretty good beer overall."
"Smooth and uncompromisingly clean finish with black malts that go with you."
"Nothing overly outstanding, just a nice dry drinkable stout that is certainly sessionable at 5.2ABV"
"Medium bodied, but feels like you're drinking a guinness.. very malty in body, the typical ""liquid bread"" type beer. Goes down easy and is fun to drink."
"Drinkability: Very impressed. If I remember correctly, I was sorely disappointed by my last beer from Mendocino. This one is world's apart from that one."
"Drinkability- Light and somewhat smooth. Hard to talk up drinkability on this disappointing stout. Mendocino has better brews than this."
"D: Maybe coming off a pretty good beer to this one is ruining it fo me, but this isn't a big winner in my book. Most likely will not buy again..."
"Overall, this was certainly a solid beer, but just a little on the weak side for my liking. It is worth trying and I recommend it for anyone who likes this style."
"thin mouthfeel and not the drinkability of many other quality stouts. Not something I would search out."
"Pours a deep black hue, with a big fluffy tan head. Smells wonderfully roasty with some nice hints of grassy(english?) hops. Taste is very good, sweet, malty with a touch of hop bitterness. My problem with this beer is the mouth feel. Its thin, watery just doesn't feel right for a stout. That thin body does however make it quite a drinkable brew. Bottoms up!"
"I would buy this one again, its not my favorite but its pretty good."
"Drinkability: very high"
"Overall wouldn't say its an absolutely amazing beer but yet a good solid stout."
"D: This is a fine American Stout. Better than many, although not fantastic. Pretty good for the price."
"D - Given by a friend, I wouldn't necessarily seek this beer out whilst out and about. A disappointment, to say the least."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a deep, dark brown color with a three-finger head of mocha-like foam. The retention of the resulting cap was great and it left bands of lacing all the way down my glass. The aroma was of musty malt, light coffee and chocolate. The flavors were quite dark but simple for the style. Lots of roasted malt, coffee and some bittersweet chocolate. The mouthfeel was smooth, the acidity a little high due to the bitterness, the carbonation low and the body full. Rather one-dimensional."
"Overall this beer is a little bizarre. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I would enjoy having it again."
"D - Decent stout, not something that I would drink again though seeing as there are much better options"
"Beer is a very light stout. Somewhat mediocre, lacks character. Very drinkable, does not fill me up at all. Just wish there was more flavor to it. In no hurry to buy again."
"Don't think I'll have another one of these; I've already poured too many beers down the drain."
"D. Overall this is a very average stout. Good for the price but I'd spring for a better example."
"Overall, not bad, but I've had better stouts, and I'm not even a fan of stouts."
"Starts with a nice one finger, light brown head that lasts for about a minute before the first sip. Good light black to dark brown cola with dark garnet highlights. Light mocha coffee notes. Some coffee, flavored cream and charcoal roasted malts. Great roasted malt and soft smoked malt flavors in this beer. Grainy, and faintly tinny palate, but still prtty drinkable. Would like to try on tap."
"Pours dark brown, nearly black. Short tan head. Licorice, chocolate, sweet malt, and some roasted coffee in the aroma. Very loose and watery mouthfeel, not creamy as advertised. Bakers' chocolate, roasted barley, some coffee, and a bitter and dry hop finish. Decent."
"Though I will say that this is a very likable brew for those of you who prefer a dark beer with some flavor and aroma, a decent amount of carbonation, and a good drinkability that won't leave you with ""hop mouth"" ie. that bitter aftertaste that lingers (one reviewer mentioned overly hopped! I don't get that at all)."
"Overall: An acceptable stout though over hopped and lacking malt balance."
"D: it is pleasing, but I will never buy this again. A average stout with a overall lightness that misses the mark"
"This one has flavor to spare and is a drinkable stout but needs to improve the backbone a little to be one to reach for this winter."
"D - While I didn't love this beer, I think it's got good drinkability. Nothing too disagreeable about it unless you really dislike strong black coffee notes in your stout. But there are plenty of other ones that I'd buy before trying this one again."
" ~ This beer really came through. This is certainly a breakfast and or desert beer. I will certainy suggest my friends try this beer and hope to one day sample a pour straight from a brewer's tap."
"Not the worst beer that I've had, but for the style it's average at best."
"d. Very drinkable, with a definite light and crisp feel to it, especially for a stout. Lighter and a bit watery for my tastes, and I doubt I'd drink it regularly, but if light roasted malt without a ton of coffee or chocolate is your thing, this is the one. I certainly wouldn't turn one down."
"The taste is a strong point, fairly full-bodied, rich, and complex with chocolatr and coffee married nicely and without any acrid burnt character. There is a little caramelly licorice quality with a taste element and feel a bit like root beer. It's clean and easy to drink. However, the palate is a little thin, lively but light and unusually fizzy for a stout."
"Silky, creamy, and rather full-bodied, the feel of Black Hawk Stout is truly succulent and the drinkability is very good."
"D: I guess this is relatively drinkable since there isn't any disagreeable flavors. There just isn't a lot to make you want to come back for more."
"This is an ok stout, nothing too spectacular. A good looking and smelling beer, but falls short in the taste. An easy drinking stout that I would drink again."
"This beer poured an attractive black color with a nice tan head that lasted a while. The aroma was of roasted malt with notes of coffee. The flavor was also of roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee with a bit of the hops coming through. The mouthfeel was pleasant. This was easy drinking and an enjoyable beer."
"Poured a from a brown bottle into a pint glass dark muddy brown with a dark tan creamy inch of head. Had a sweet chocolatey malt smell. Tasted like sweet chocolate and bitter coffee. It had a thin consistency not very Stout. I got this for free and paid just the right amount."
"D= For sure a very drinkable stout. While it is not my favorite Mendocino brew, nor my favorite stout, its still a fine offering."
"Black, thin, tan head. Some chocolate, minimal roastiness, not much else going on here. Nice and smooth, actually too smooth. Somewhat watery, nice dry finish. Very uncomplicated and very drinkable, just not very satisfying. You better plan on having quite a few."
"D: Quite drinkable, this is the first beer that I've had from Mendocino and will definitely be trying some more of their brews."
"This poured a nearly opaque black with a bit of light tan head. It smelled like licorice and bitter chocolate with some espresso. It tasted like bitter licorice with some semi-sweet mocha and a bit of floral hops. It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a lasting tangy aftertaste. Overall this had a fairly unique flavor that wasn't bad, but wasn't quite what I was hoping for either. Fairly clean and drinkable, but not much more than an average total appeal."
"Don't expect any fireworks from this stout. It's a very pleasant little number, slightly sweet in the mouth with a nice bitter finish, but nothing to phone your friends about. Carbonation and body are lacking somewhat, which leaves the discerning drinker a little disappointed, but I'd still go out and buy another six-pack. It's giving me exactly the kind of burnt aftertaste that I look for in a stout or a porter - just the kind that I don't get from a good peaty single malt Scotch like Laphraoig. A place for everything and everything in its place."
"Nice dark red color, but a thin head which disappears quickly. You can smell light hops and alcohol. A little alcohol on the taste as well as burnt malt. A nice smooth finish, but not much of the thicker quality that is associated with a stout. Extra apperance points for the really cool bottle. More like a dark lager then a true stout."
"Overall, pretty disappointing for a stout. The taste and feel are just off."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark black color with a light tan head that sticks around for quite a while and provide a nice lacing quality. The aroma is on the faint side for a stout, with dark malts and molasses. The taste like the aroma, is a little thin for the style, with dark roasted malts and a moderate bitterness in the finish from the hops. This is not a bad beer, but it lacks a little in the flavor category. Overall, Black Hawk Stout is a decent stout that is worth a shot but nothing that I am dying to purchase again."
"I found this to be a below average stout - much better options are available."
"D: A dark roasted treat big on flavor, could use a little more body but still goes down nicely. Hearty."
"pours a dark black which is nice but the faint head dissipates immediately. nose is malt with some astringency. Mouthfeel is light and it's a bit overcarbonated. there's a soapiness that is a little unpleasant...could have been a bit too hot during the hopping process... I think it's the hops that are causing this 'soapiness'.. budget priced and budget taste... to think I can get Blackout Stout from GLB for a dollar more a six is laughable... glad I only bought one. Very Drinkable...you could pound these....but that's not what I'm looking for in this style."
"A completely average stout. Pours black, but with no head and no lacing. Burnt grain scent, but nothing else and weak. Same with the taste; although there is a little bit of an odd bitter aftertaste, not really hoppy, but nothing I expect from a stout."
"Overall - I felt like it was lacking in body, texture, and taste. I can't quite put my finger on it but give it a try. I personally prefer Guinness or Murphy's Irish stout. I'm not a big fan of Mendocino after trying a few of their products."
"Not the most drinkable of beers, it's a bit too bitter for my tastes. I've had many beers where I'd happily drink more than one, but this one isn't it. Nice to sample, but there's much better stouts out there."
"D-I'm trying not to be biased just because I am a Chicago Blackhawks fan,but I love the name and the style,this is a nice Red,White and Blue Stout...F YEAH"
"Black Hawk Stout pours an opaque black with a thin tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is malty, hints of chocolate are present. The flavor has some chocolate, or perhaps carob and kind of a hoppy finish. Not bad, but there are so many better examples available."
"D - Because of the lightness in its body, I could definitely have a number of these in a sitting. This is one of the lighter stouts I have tried."
"This has a very pleasant aroma and flavor but is a little weak overall. It's a bit too sweet and lacking in hops for me, but is still an enjoyable beer."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer looks like fresh motor oil on the pour and appears almost black in the glass with a thin, sticky head. The smell is malty, chocolate and roasted notes... there seems to be some metallic off-ness to it. The taste has the same metallic characteristic to it, otherwise very malty; dark chocolate, caramel, a touch of burnt coffee and has a warming effect. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a minimal carbonation and semi-dry finish. Drinkability is decent, I wish I had a different bottle to try, minus the metallic smell/taste."
"D - While this beer tastes okay, i think I wanted a stout with a little more flavor than lightly roasted malts."
"T: It was very carbonated and and some wold say too much. I am ok with it, as i like this in a stout. Anyway, it tasted like it smelled, and was quite enjoyable. Hopps were only present in the lingering aftertaste, and i like the presence of them at this time."
"Pours pretty much opaque with a slight dark ruby brown highlight, and about a quarter inch of tan head that soon drowns to a whisper. Aromas of licorice, dark roasty malt, slight chocolate, cocoa powder and a little dark fruit, no hop aroma. On the palate, it opens up to be a blend of roasted malt, chocolate, dark prune and raisin. It finishes dry, roasty bitterness and very clean, with a slight wateriness, which is okay for 5% abv. Overall, a clean, and straight forward stout, but nothing out of the ordinary."
"At least it was cheap. Wouldn't buy it again."
"Even with the taste smoothing out some from the first sip I would refrain from calling this a smooth clean taste. It does approach refreshing and would be a more than one beer event as it is 5.2% alcohol which may have also attributed to the bitter flavor and after taste."
"O- This seemed to be a really quality stout, though it was a little less weight then other stouts. I would purchase this one again."
"This is one of the first beers I ever had, and back when I tried it, I thought this was one of the most bitter beers I have ever had. For a while it was one of my favorites. Now, a few years later, I realize it's not-so-bitter in the realm of stouts, but it's still a great beer. It's a very drinkable stout, good for sessioning, and hard to set down. Recommended."
"First rating for a brewery I've often noted on display at every venue I shop; this one is the first from a sampler...jet black body with a swift diminishing head that turns to basically a penicl thin moustache... sweet caramel notes and peat--a bit thin to probing nostrils... thin, slightly creamy; medium bodied and pleasant.... sweet, smooth peaty and a bit malty under the tongue--surprisingly balanced... notmilky and smooth, not hot or smoked-- a flexible, companionable beer, especially with old friends like Greg, Nikki, Dave and Jenn on a snow day..."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"D= Easy to drink. Not too strong to drink relatively quick, unlike most stouts. Not too much alcohol either, so you can easily have 3 or 4. This is daddy's mocha."
"D - Very drinkable, my growler was empty before I knew it. I will definitely be in the tasting room soon for a refill! Highly recommended."
"This is nice. Very clean, very refreshing for a stout. I'm a dry, bitter stout kind of guy, so this suits me fine. Better as it warms up to room temperature. Would go well with an assortment of sharp cheddars and maybe a few blue cheeses. Would also pair well with a rich cheesecake for dessert."
"Well, don't know if I'd get this again. In a sampler, makes the dark beers fans like me happy, but nothing I'd go out of my way for."
"Pours opaque, but with little tan head to show for it. Nose is very muted but gives just the slightest hint of roasted molasses malts. Flavor is heavily roasted and very, very smoked. Calms down as it warms and gives a nice, robust, smoky profile. Feel is nice. Well bodied liquid and the carbonation is on a good level too. Smooth. Overall this was a nice surprise. Much more developed than I figured it would be and very much worth trying."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It leans toward medium bodied. Carbonation is good. All in all, pretty smooth and drinkable. Overall, it's a straight forward American stout. Nothing special, but far from bad."
"Poured dark brown with a half-inch of tan head. Subdued aroma of dark toasted grains. Taste is rather dull, one-note. Finish is dry and somewhat watery. This might be a good ""introduction"" stout for those normally put off by this style. But for stout lovers, this is a little ""light""."
"Drinkability- Not a bad but I think couple of these are all I would want in a sitting."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a very dark, almost black, brown, that was almost completely opaque. Had a 1 finger head light chocolaty brown head that left lacings and a ring around the beer. I smelled wheat bread, coffee, as well as maple sugar in the aroma. Taste was slightly sweet, and I occasionally found very dark chocolate tastes. Felt tingly in the mouth, was slightly bitter. Except for the bitter tingling, it was fairly easy to drink, I found myself drinking it faster than I remember."
"Feels watery, but not at all thin. Smooth and very easy to drink. It's really nicely balanced. More darkly sweet than bitter."
"Just ok for a microdrinker.. would probably be an ok gateway beer for a person who likes Guiness."
"Brewed and Bottled in Saratoga Springs NY, being local, I had to try it and I am glad I did. Poured from 12 ounce bottle to 1 pint glass, very little to no head but the lacing was very good. As it warmed in the glass, the flavor mellowed. good Drinkability, I just wish I didn't live in Coors Light Country."
"Sampled at the Odds and Ends Tasting II on 10/19/07: This brew is a dark brown color with ruby edges. Medium light tan head that burns off steadily and thin rings of lacing. Toasted malt aroma with nuts and vanilla. Medium, smooth body with roasted malt, nut and mild hops flavors. The finish is short with roasted coffee and hops. Slightly above average overall."
"D: This is defiantly a session stout as one could drink a number of these at one sitting, but would soon want something with more flavor and complexity. Not a bad stout just found this to be very thin and a bit weak in the flavor profile of what I want in a stout."
"Notes: I wanted this to be really good, but it ended up being an extremely average stout. Pass on this one."
"Okay, glad I tried it, and nothing really wrong with it, but not outstanding."
"D: This beer keeps getting better as it warms in your glass, and with another fresh cold one it starts all over again. Yum."
"Beer poured black as night with a nice well sustained tan head. Nose is a slight hint of malts and floral hops. Taste is classic dry Irish stout, chocolate roasted malts dominate up front. The finish is dry hops. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, a bit thinner than hoped. Drinkability is pretty good. This is a pretty good representation of the irish stout style, definitely worth a try."
"D - Not bad but not great. Could be a good session stout due to the fairly low ABV but it's pretty lacking in flavor to make it interesting so you may as well grab one of the super low ABV Irish Dry Stouts for a session stout. Still a drinkable brew."
"Can you say Imperial Stout Lite (if there is such a thing)? More fruity esters than I was expecting, mild cocoa flavor, but little roasted character to it. It has a rich opaque appearance that stares at you in the face. It's pretty dry in the end and quite drinkable. Not bad by any means; I just was expecting a much bigger roasted character."
"D - overall it's a decent enough stout, but a bit thin for my expectations - the roasted grain is the highlight here though"
"D - I could take my time drinking one or two of these but its not my first choice if I was going to drink a stout"
"Medium body, nice sparkling carbonation."
"Poured from a bottle into a glass. The head fizzled away to just a thin little layer around the drink . The color is a dark brown/molasses.The aroma had a plum and fruity scent to it.The taste is very nice just a little bite but nothing too serious. I would order this stout again. This one is 5.2 so could be a session brew for some. Enjoy."
"It poured a very dark nearly black color with very little head. I had this left over from a mixed 12 pack so it was a few months old which could account for the lack of head. Very a little aroma...very faint roast in the nose. However, it was very flavorful with the first sip. A little chocolate up front and a burnt coffee on the finish. Mouthfeel was a little thin but it was right in line with most of the stouts I have had. I don't normally drink stouts but I was in the mood for something different and this hit the spot. I found very drinkable and would definitely have it again."
"D: Very drinkable for this style. Goes down very smooth."
"[Served chilled, in a nonic]"
"D: A pretty good stout, I've had better, but sure glad I tried it, smooth and easy to drink."
"Pours opaque black / deep brown with a buried crimson tone. Small to medium-sized caramel brown head with a little crown of cream in the middle; mostly large bubbles and dies down quickly to a thin layer. A few small islands of drippy lacing here and there. Aroma is a bit on the watery side, but offers a rich, nutty, bread character with a background of molasses. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and juicy with a light but sharp carbonation. Flavor is acidic-sweet (tomato) and a touch smoky; steak and charcoal surface in the finish. Woodiness and a bit of a stale flavor linger; aftertaste is neutral with a hint of charcoal bitterness."
"Nearly opaque brown with a touch of red when held up to the light. Pours with a slim, light brown head that fade to a film. Light lacing. Nice roasted-toasted smelll a combination of molasses and caramel. Slight hop sharpness below this. Coffee, earthy , roasty flavor hits first, then the hops (mostly floral and general bitterness) which make a nice top end to the caramel/molasses sweetness. Not oversweet, more dry and drying. Good combination. Low apparent carbonation, although there is a touch of carbo sharpness in the first bit of the taste. Nice medium-to-thick body. Astringency really lingers. Good drinkability. To me, this actually had good complexity of flavors. A nice balance between dry and sweet stouts, although this trend more toward dry."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with no dating info into a pint glass. It was a solid black even against a light. It had a small tan head that faded into a thin collar. Heavy carb in the center but no lacing. The aroma was roasted malts and coffee. Smelled good but was weak. The taste followed the smell with roasted malts and coffee. Also kinda weak. The mouthfeel was solid. Overall, it's a good beer and worth trying if you can easy find (especially if in someone else's fridge) but there are better AmStouts out there so this won't be a player in the rotation (3.5, RB-IS, T, O)"
"This poured up dark black and opaque with a thin tan head. Roasted malt dominates the aroma with a hint of coffee. I don't know. It seems bland. Roast malts come through first on tasting with a hint of citusy hops in the background. And the finish is mild, a bit of the roasted malt lingers in the mouth. I thought the beer was a little thin. It's a good stout, not the best I've ever had, but good."
"It was relatively cheap ($1.00 for a 12oz. bottle) but not even worth the buck. Won't ever buy this again...much better stouts in the same price range."
"The taste has a lot of caramel malt up front that starts off very sweet but that's offset quickly by some hop bitterness that cuts the level of sweetness pretty well. I also get some good chocolate notes along with some roasted malt and an earthy flavour also shows up. It finishes slightly bitter but at the very end, it comes off on the watery side. It has a good mouthfeel to it for the style and the carbonation is fairly brisk. Pretty good stout in my book."
"This is an OK beer, but I feel I can do much better in the price range."
"Drinkable if you can handle the burnt flavor. There's a very good stout in here somewhere, but the lasting flavors of scorched chocolate and burnt coffee grounds are a bit over the top."
"Drinkability: While its not stoutstanding, it is pretty decent, but could benefit some more body."
"D: A decent introduction to darker grains. I bought 2 bottles and I'm still looking forward to the next, but that may be it for me and this brew."
"Smell was mild coffee beans, roasted malt, and damp, black earth. Nice. All these were present in the taste, too, as well as a fairly easily noticeable smokiness that I really enjoied. This is good; a good, dry, smokey stout. As I said before, the thin, lack-luster mouthfeel hurts it a bit, but everything else is quite nice. I would buy this again."
"Not a bad little stout. Favorite of the Mendocino Variety Pack for me."
"Pours a clean/clear dark brown color, some carbonation, little fizzy tannish head, some sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is malty, and some touch of toffee/caramel. The taste is thin malty, and some caramel. Light-Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad brew, recommended."
"It looks and pours the way a stout should - deep opaque brown, almost black, with a rich tan head. Aroma is stouty and smoky with hints of roasted coffee. In the flavor, smokiness predominates; there are hints of coffee and chocolate. Hop bitterness is strong but not overwhelming. It feels a bit on the thin side, but it is smooth and satisfying. Could be a good way to introduce dark beers to someone accustomed to light lagers and pale ales."
"Okay. Not a bad stout by any means, but there is much better out there. A bitter, toasted, dry stout for sure. It's got balls. Wouldn't go out of my way to find it, but would gladly drink another if it were the only stout around. Too thin for my liking."
"D - This is a good stout. A good chocolate and roasted malt blend of flavors."
"A deep, black, opaque stout with a solid light-tan head. Aroma is surprisingly light and spicy for a stout, with some definite smoke (almost like cigar smoke) and a hint of dry coffee. Flavour is on the dryer side, with the smokey elements sticking around. Roasted malt, a bit of molasses, again the dry, bitter coffee, and hint of very dark chocolate. Faint, mildly sour aftertaste. Mouthfeel a little on the light side for the style."
"Overall, I really like this. It's like a bolder version of Guinness."
"D- I'll have this again. It wasn't bad and was quite different with its touch of hops."
"Drinkability: Might grab a 6'er of this for the weekend, as its really not too strong, and I could drink a few of them."
"D - Not a bad selection...I'd like to give it another try."
"Not a bad brew if you can find it"
"The pour into my Fuller's nonic raises a creamy tan one-finger head over a nearly opaque body with ruby highlights. The head recedes slowly, but the lacing is almost too heavy to hold the sides of the glass. The nose is dominated by a lovely mocha scent, but there also comes through a bit of burnt caramel. The taste is very balanced between roast and chocolate-caramel sweetness. The mouth is velvety on the tongue, but still has a lively carbonation. Eminently drinkable."
"A light,watery mouthfeel,airy,creamy a nitro draft feel to it. Pleasing,moderate taste,if I had a session stout this one would be at the top of the list. Nothing extreme just a good enjoyable stout. One that everybody would enjoy, one to keep on hand. Give it a try!"
"12 oz. bottle- color of dark coffee , with a reasonable tan head - nose of malt , mint chocolate , cream , bitter chocolate , and some vegetation ( wet grass )  taste of mint chocolate , milk chocolate , and milk that is semi off- body creamy , and bittersweet aftertaste of bittersweet chocolate , and malts"
"The flavor delivers a brash assault of dark malt bitterness and acidity atop an underbelly of sweet, gently caramel-nougat-like maltiness. Dull, dark bittersweet chocolate lays itself across the middle; and some grassy and floral hops make an appearance here and there (mostly in the burp...), but the ashy roastiness truly dominates. The stoney bitterness is solid, enboldened by the dark malt acidity, and it finishes quite dry with a long-lingering charred-roastiness."
"Mendocino's Black Hawk Stout poured a very dark brown to black with only minor head development. Aroma consisted of a mild butterscotch and/or caramel aroma, but not much else. I couldn't detect any hop presence to speak of. Taste was both sweet and bitter with a slight burnt flavor. Overall, this is a smooth stout with plenty of carbonation despite the lackluster head. This beer goes down easily and is quite enjoyable, although there are better stouts out there."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a dark brown, almost black, forming a fluffy 1 inch head, leaving thick rings of lace on the glass. The aroma is weak, but seems to consist mostly of the roasted malts. The flavor is not as good as other stouts that I've tried of this kind. It tastes mostly of roasted malts, with very little in the way of coffee or chocolate. Not bad, but I'm used to their being that distinctive coffee flavor with a stout. Maybe I just havent tried enough American stouts to get the full range of flavors. The mouthfeel is a little thin, but seems to work with this particular stout. Overall, this is a good stout, and an easy enough beer, to have a few of during a session."
"a roasted taste pervades the whole drink which is a little too strong as a personal opinion,"
"Drinkability: the crisp mouthfeel for a stout did not cut it for me along with the slighty burnt tones. Not one I would recommend."
"Drinkability- A nice buy and will have to try again soon."
"D - A pretty well crafted stout with a nice hop bitterness. Not bad."
"Black, opaque in the body, but a dark brown tranluscence at the edges. The smell is mild roasted malts, nothing bad at all, but nothing noticeably special either. The taste is similar to the nose but it does have a pleasant malt character that tells us it's a stout. The mouthfeel is medium and consistent. Overall, a pleasant if not outstanding beer. Certainly very drinkable."
"D- This beer is pretty light and doesn't have a lot of depth but the flavors that it does have are nice."
"Pours a deep black with a finger tan head that disappates to just a coating and leaves some nice lacing. Smells of nice roasted/burnt malts, coffee, and some dark chocolate. Taste is dominated by the burnt malts, also present are notes of coffee and dark chocolate. There is only a mere hint of malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is ok. The beer is somewhat creamy thanks to the caronation but is a bit too thin in body. Good drinkability, this is an easily drinkable session stout and a well crafted brew."
"All in all an average-ish brew. Not bad, I had two or three and will be able to eventually finish the rest (or give them to visitors without having a guilty conscious), but not one that I would get again."
" I wish I had another bottle to sample. I found myself somewhat unsure of my thoughts on this stout. Ill need to acquire more and review it again."
"Will I revisit this brew? Yes"
"I got this 12 ounze beer from a Mendocino Mix case and poured into a pint glass. There was about a finger and a half of head. There was a bit of lace, not a lot but more than a little. It was very dark, and thick. It didn't have much of a smell. The taste was solid, very malty, but very well blended. The thickness provided a very nice mouthfeel. This was a very drinkable stout. Don't drink and review."
"D - Not too shabby here. It is a very average drinkable stout. Nothing too extreme in any aspect (the mouthfeel is bland, but that's about it). I am not impressed by this, but I would drink it again if it was handed to me."
"Pours pitch black but with a thin head and little lacing. Aroma is of molasses with a hint of caramel. I find it a little overcarbonated and a little lacking in traditional stout flavors -- there isn't enough coffee, chocolate taste. There is a bit of liquorice flavor which is interesting. Overall, a decent beer, but a little disappointing for a stout."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Dan average stout, but not sure I would have it again."
"This came in a gift pack but I would buy it, more likely in a bar/restaurant than to buy a 6-pack."
"Overall a decent stout with enough character to keep things interesting. Flavor becomes more complex as it warms. Certainly worth a try."
"Pours dark brown with tan head. Aroma of roasted malts, reminiscent of chocolate, some fruit aromas , and faint alcohol aroma. Some fruit flavors underneath the anticipated roasted malts. A faint tartness in the background. No significant hop presence I can detect. Nothing special but this isn't bad."
"Overall a lighter stout, easy to drink, but nothing to get excited about."
"Jen: This brew is quite perplexing. It seems like a stout at first, but towards the end, I just feel like I am drinking a dark ale. The taste is very well done with a roasted coffee flavor backed with smokey malts and a mild caramel sweetness. The body just seems a bit thin for a stout. I like this, but I am disappointed with the mouthfeel."
"Pours a deep dark brown. Thin tan head, with no real retention. Decent lacing. Smell is of roasted coffee, nut, and hops. Body is light for a stout, with very little carbonation. Taste is of roasted coffee, with a bite. malty finish. Decent. Good session beer. Would try again."
"Overall a nice stout with a manageable ABV. A good session beer."
"Really a very nice american stout. Loads of flavors, all in your face and yet extremely drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and fairly good. A bit too much carbonation makes this one too crisp and biting on the tongue for me. Overall good drinkability though. Simple with a nice toasted flavor, just not much in it to continually bring me back."
"Opinion: I am really enjoying this beer as it is really drinkable. I like a stout or Porter that aren't over the top in the roast department, and this beer satisfies that requirement. It has a good flavor and finishes refreshing. It is not an Imperial Stout, so you shouldn't be expecting one. It is just a clean and well-balanced dry stout."
"Timing and mood is everything, I know, but I enjoyed this dry stout. I had just finished two rather sweet, malty brews and this stout really hit the spot for me."
"Very dark brown, almost black, with a very small but tenacious, tan, creamy head. Smells of roasted malt, toffee, charcoal, dark bread, molasses and plum. Taste follows suit. Very bready and big, with some light brothy yeast. It has a medium-full body, lightly syrupy texture and moderate carbonation. This is a very enjoyable beer. Nothing spectacular, but a good representation of the style. The hops are a little weak on the finish in my opinion, but otherwise this is quite good."
"D: I wouldn't want more than one, but fans of dry stouts will like it."
"Drinkability: A good, easy drinking stout, at least worth a try. I purchased my six pack on sale for $5.99, when this regularly sell for $8.99 in Nebraska. For $5.99 this is a good beer; at $8.99 this is overpriced. I can find many better beers for less."
"Pretty good stuff; it just gets swallowed up by the bigger, bolder, and richer American Stouts out there. It's got the nearly opaque black / ruby hue with a dainty silk-like head and lacing. A solid, albeit tame, roasted malt flavor with a supporting, but not overwhelming, sweetness. In fact, the malts seem to balance out the bitterness that is supplied by the burned grains and the American Hops. I appreciate it that the hops are tightly controlled, not to dominate the Stout. The body is where the beer shines--great creaminess without nitro. Silky texture without being thick or chewy. Thins toward the finish without becomming watery. Finishes quite dry and with a pleasant charcoal-like powderyness(Irish Dry Stout). Alcohols remain consistant and muted. A beautiful beer that probably gets little respect."
"To clarify the taste- compared to Guinness, this beer is much more flavorful, sweeter (in spite of the hop finish), and generally more intense."
"An aggressive pour lead to a decent one inch head which quickly reduced but left a small crown. The body was totally opaque and black. Very nice to look at. My first whiff was a strong and unbalanced mix of alcohol and coffee, but after it breathed for a few seconds it was significantly mellowed and some floral and fruity smells came through. Strong bitter, dark and burnt malts are my first impression followed by some aggressive hopping. Sweetness lingers throughout. Medium bodied with a bitter and slightly boozy finish. Drinkable nevertheless and quite enjoyable."
"The taste is a little better but somewhat similar. This beer is worth a try but it's definitely lacking in complexity for a stout. A nice offering if you're stuck in a state with an abv cap."
"Notes: I'm an advocate of this brewery overall and this is no exception. Nicely balanced stout. Price per quality ratio: this passes with flying colors."
"Musings: A pretty decent beer. The taste character is great - but is not matched by the nose or the body feel. A taste this full should be backed up by a more substantial body."
"Poured out opaque, coal black with a huge, milk chocolate head that petered out slowly. Smells of roasted chocolate malt with a slight herbal background. Tastes first of the dark malts which lead into a fruitiness alongside a bitter roasted finish. Kind of weak, flavor-wise. Carbonation levels are pretty spot-on but it's rather watery. Pretty ho-hum all around. Not good enough for me to buy again, but not bad enough to pour down the drain."
"				~Benjamin Franklin"
"The smell of roasted malts and hops filled the nose, but nothing over outstanding. The taste was of roasted malts with a hint of tart and a touch of sourness. This stout got a little better as the beer warmed up a little. Not impressed with this stout!"
"Drinkability: Certainly the best Mendocino that I have tasted (although that is not saying much), this is a respectable effort but is a tad too disjointed to come together"
"Still, resonably priced, and a solid, if basic, stout. Worth a try."
"Brew pours to a deep, deep brown color hedging on black with a medium tan colored head that has some retention while leaving some lacing. The aromas are of coffee and heavily roasted malts, a somewhat burnt aroma. The taste is pretty good, coffee and roasted grains that go right along with what was in the nose. Also finished with a hop bitterness that seems to balance it out nicely. Very dry feel to it. Overall a nice offering. One of the better brew offered by Mendocino IMO."
"Black with a creamy head. Smells of highly of hops and some dark malts.The taste is somewhat hoppy with roasted/burnt malt flavors, sweeter caramel flavors, but of the little chocolate or coffee I usualy expect. Mouthfeel was really crisp for a stout. Overall the brew was enjoyable, but not exactly what I expect from the style generally."
"This was a refreshingly drinkable stout"
"Poured an opaque dark brown (almost black) with loads of tan colored head that just sat still for minutes and left behind just a touch of lacing. Aromas of roasted malt, hard candy, and faint dried fruit. The taste was as might be expected with toasted/smoked flavors carrying greater intensity than the sweetness of various malts. Somewhat astringent in the aftertaste with a sour flavor that didn't go away. This was my 2nd beer of the night and I had trouble with this one...just did not sit well with me and adversely affected my taste buds."
"Close to a Irish dry stout, especially with the dry, gritty mouthfeel. Medium bodied, but still processing a rich overall glow. It may be just a tad on the thin side, but the relatively low abv of 5% makes this a good session candidate  especially with the good sixer price tag."
"I've been a distant fan because of all the loyal followers of this brewery and their Red Tail Ale. Would always stop in when heading up to Reggae On The River and they are truely one of the original N. CA hancrafted brewers. So, I was excited when I grabbed a sixer of the Stout at Trader Joes. So let's start with what matters. The taste.... Disapointing. As few have mentioned already, this falls short. I did like the peety smoke taste you find in a scotch but no wow factor. More than usual carbination for a stout which is something different but not negative. If it's on sale and you have spent your beer budget, maybe. Damn, I wanted so much more."
"D: seems that this beer was meant to be very middle of the road and approachable by a few too many. tastes like sacrifices were made in order to get a broader appeal. that being said, i know i dont want another, not tonight anyway."
"Brewed in sartoga springs, NY. Wow this poured a black as fuck black. Virtually no ligh gets through when help up to my computer monitor. Decent mocha head that does not last. I admit i did a bad pour here, not a enough straight on head creation pouring. The aroma was mild but of sweet malt. The taste is smokey with a hint of coffee. Kinda sweet but sharp. Bitterly dry. The mouthfeel is kinda watery lite but smooth. Thin. An allright stout."
"Very smooth, no lingering after taste."
"Yep, it's an average beer. The picture on the bottle was cool and that was about it for this one. I was expecting something a bit more malty, but IMO it was stronger in the hops area. That's just what my ""buds"" were telling me. The head was pretty nice at first, but then died out fairly rapidly, leaving nothing behind, but spotty(at best) laceing. The taste was ok, just nothing too special. Not something I'll be drinking again though."
"Overall- a decent stout, not amazing but a mild middle of the road stout that could be drank a novice or a pro."
"Dark brown color with reddish hues. Light tan head that holds well and leaves spots of oily lacing behind. Aroma is faint nuts & malted barley with an off-metallic smell thrown in there as well. A little weak in flavor & mouthfeel for a stout..tastes are fairly typical roasted malts with a slight metallic/bitter character tagged on the end. At best, I'd consider it an average stout."
"M and D: Mouthfeel is nice, but I would have liked it to be heavier considering its jet black color. Drinkability is ok, a tasty one in a pinch, but wouldn't be my first pick. I would have this again however if the opportunity showed itself."
"This pours a dark black with a small creamy tan head.The smell is mostly roasted malt with a little coffee.The taste is roasted malt and not much else.The m/f is too light for my taste.This is an easy drinking beer,but not a good stout.I could drink this all night,but I was expecting a thicker heavier beer than this."
"Drinkability is also fine. I could drink these all night without getting too bored with them. There's a real good chance this beer will find its way into my rotation again someday."
"Pretty easy to drink, but just an average dry stout overall."
"Overall this is a pretty good stout but it is deficient of something more. What more I dont know. But it just isnt that extraordinary to me. Watch out, that first sip will catch out off guard if you arent ready. Cheers!"
"Just a year ago I would not have liked this. I am still not fond of it but have a fair idea of what bothers me about it. Flavors suggest poor blending and possibly low quality grains. Little amused by the ""The Legend Grows"" neck ring and claims that mimic Budweisser Select. Drinkable but marginal and it turns me away from trying other brews from Mendocino."
"Black with a brown bubbly head that becomes a thin foam on top. Week at the nose. Maybe some hops...maybe. The taste is fine...just fine. It taste like they missed something. It's just a bit off, but I don't know what it is. Not bad, it's just that something is missing. Mouthfeel is too thin and carbonated for a stout. It's a drinkable beer, even a decent beer. It's just not a good stout."
"All in all, Black Hawk is not a bad beer, but not particularly inspiring either. Drink if you can't find Guinness or your favorite stout."
"This is a good, solid stout. Everything is pretty close to the way I like it. Jet black with coffee & chocolate in the scent & taste. I would prefer a smoother finish. This tasted a little too carbonated - a bit too ""piercing"" I would say. A bit more caramel flavoring would be nice too. The bitterness in this stout is on point, though. I dont know if I would buy this again, as I have my pick of so many different stouts in this area, but this is a good effort from Mendocino."
"A little bitter for me. Poured with absolutely no head. A very dark color. The smell is nothing to brag about. I would not want to drink these much. It is not a bad beer but I think there are simply better choices of this style. I like for a stout to be smooth but this one kinda has a bite to it."
"Smells and tastes very carmelly, hardly bitter at all. Mouthfeel is relatively weak. Damn, this beer is a complete disappointment after the appearance. This seems like a schwarzbier, not a stout. Black Hawk walks the walk, but doesn't talk the talk."
"The taste is of black malt, chocolate, coffee, and even vanilla bean. Tastes almost like a black lager. Very crisp and smooth for a stout, as is printed on the label. A pleasant chocolate coffee and vanilla taste lingers in the mouth with a moderately dry finish. I could drink the shit out of this stout, or whatever you want to call it."
"I'm sure I've had this before & it was much better, but memory fails me now..."
"poured a beautiful deep brown color with nice puffy tannish head. Smell is very light and not overly pleasant. Very disappointing. Taste is nice for chocalate, caramel roaasted malt, but the hop bitterness is too overpowering and seems to become stronger with each sip. Very acid and astringent mouth feel. Glad I only bought one."
"Nice looking stout, very symmetrical looking creamy head, that fades to a solid ring around the outside, with a thinner layer in the middle. Coffee and other roasted malts in the nose, lightl dark chocolate. Taste is good, although not great. Nice coffee flavor, not overpowering, hops are not very dominant. Sweet, but not cloying. This is a very solid and drinkable stout."
"Pours a dark coffee brown with a few scattered bubbles, but no actual head. Smells burnt and roasty, with a hint of sweetness. Taste is quite heavy on the burnt side, with just a bit of coffee and unsweetened chocolate character. Finish is dry and astringent. Kind of a thin mouthfeel for a stout, but drinkable. An okay stout... a little too burnt and astringent. Not really up my alley."
"Despite how thick it poured, this beer is only md-thick bodied. Carbonation is mild, but does sting the tongue a bit. Overall, no flavor dominated to an unpleasant extent. The underlying flavors were noticable in their own right, but also worked to keep the roast flavor from isolation."
"Easily consumable, I would have another but will not seek it out."
"Good looking stout ---almost opaque blackness with a thick beige head and good lacing. Aroma is roasted malts, coffee, and dark fruity sweetness. Taste is dominated by the roasted malts with a bitter coffee/chocolate finish. Mouthfeel was smooth with a dry finish, but the body of this beer is too thin. Nothing about this stout really wowed me, but it was a cheap single and I could certainly stand to drink more."
"overall i would say to buy if it you have the chance because its cheap, but much better stouts out there. too sweet."
"Overall - A solid stout. Pretty inexpensive, goes down good. I'll get it again to keep in the fridge. Good session stout and also a good one for people who might not like some of the stronger examples of the style."
"Medium to full bodied, crisp and dry."
"Pours a near pitch black with a thin wispy head,deeply roasted malt and bitter chocolate with a light piney note.There is a real hop presence to this stout for sure when drinking at room temp,bitter unsweetened chocolate and highly roasted malt are most prevelant but a dry,piney hoppiness really comes trhu as it warms and in the after-burps.An above average stout not spectacular but I would drink again for sure."
"Overall a so-so stout. It has a nice crispness/dryness from the hops, but there's really no malt backbone to speak of."
"Drinkability and Overall: Your average stout. Simple as that. Nothing too special, but nothing too horrible. This may be a good beer to ""enlighten"" fans of Guinness with, but alas it's nothing special."
"This one pours a dark color with a small head that dies off quickly and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma has some roasted malts and some dark fruits. Interesting. The flavor has a good malt character, but there is a raisin-like flavor that I don't prefer in a stout. The body is a bit light as well. Could use some thickness. Drinkability is ok."
"Thanks to clvand0 for sharing this with me. It pours a slightly browned black color with a small head over top of it. The nose is slightly roasted, but mostly raisiney and figgy fruit tones. The flavor is a little weak to me, with mostly dark fruit tones with a slight roasted, hop bitter finish. The feel is well to thin. Almost watery. Overall, not my favorite stout. The flavors are not necessarily what I associate with a stout and the feel is just to thin."
"I need more."
"Drinkability: It's a bit of quandry: it's a bit too heavy to session, but it's not really unique or outstanding enough to go out of your way to drink. Still, I can't fault it for being a good, basic stout."
" I don't think that I could make an entire session out of this stout.There are but a few brews that are in that class. But, it's a good choice to start with then move on. Or, end with as a compliment to a dessert such as a piece of pumpkin pie or apple pie ala mode. While this one probably wouldn't make a good warm weather choice, the price allows you to have this brew in your fridge throughout the year without worrying about breaking your wallet. Pretty good."
"I can't believe that the Lowes Foods by me sells this for $5.50 a six, can't beat that. An aggressive pour yields a thick, chunky head that dissipates into a nice veil, medium lacing. Nose is all roasted malts, powdered cocoa, coffe, and bread. Taste is same but buttery, smooth, and has a nice, dry hoppy finish. Light carbonation and medium/light mouthfeel make this a good session beer. I drank one with a bowl of Hagen Daas Bailey Irich Cream ice cream for dessert--what a perfect match! A great deal for the price."
"Carbonation is indeed rough and definitely affects negatively the drinkability. Light body, despite apparent viscosity."
"The mouthfeel is nice, although not as creamy as some stouts, the Black Hawk goes down nicely. This is a really nice beer."
"The BlackHawk poured with a full foamy light brown head and left a coating of lace down the sides of the glass. The roasty malt came through in the aroma and the taste spoke of chocolate, coffee and roasted notes backed with a mild hoppy bite that matched the complexity of the malt. Overall quite dry and an admirable example of its style. I have had better, but this one was quite decent."
"A solid, above-average stout."
"The je ne sais qua of the beer leaves an unsettling vibe. I will not seek another."
"Drinkability - tone down the carbonation, but otherwise a fine stout. I could enjoy more of these."
"Drinkability/notes: A pleasing stout, surely best on a cool, dark, and windy autumn day, and not during an extended Texas summer."
"Pours pitch black with a sizeable coffee-colored head. Roasted malt and mocha are prevalent on the nose. Creamy mouthfeel holds a nice, dry palate of roasted chocolate malt, coffee, and a touch of caramel. Lightly bitter hops emerge in the lingering finish. Not bad."
"Poured a pitch black and creamy with a thick beige head that dissapated quickly, leaving only a thin ring and slight cloud in the center. Scents of toffee, coffee, dark cherries, and brandy. Light carbination and a bit of bite in the flavor. Tastes dark and smooth. Burnt toast in the sips and aftertaste. Sherry, merlot, espresso. Good bitterness. Good mouthfeel, but heavy tasting, maybe not one that you could drink a ton of in a sitting, but still very enjoyable."
"I like my stouts to be bigger and bolder, but Black Hawk isn't bad. It's a reasonably tasty, unchallenging beer that would be perfect for those newbies who express an interest in the style."
"Overall Impression: A bit disjointed. There are a lot of nice feathers, but it just doesnt gel into a bird. Nice roasted qualities, nice sweet note, but the bitter is a bit much and the carbonation is a bit high. If youre a Stout lover, worth a shot."
"The taste is sweet and chocolate like in the begining. It turns harsh and burnt like with some coffee notes to it and finishs quite dry. it seemed a complex flavor. Very enjoyable. The beer was also very thick and chewy."
"So good. Malts are upfront and in your face with their sweetness followed by the flavors of coffee with traces of chocolate on the tongue. Finish is slightly bitter, but leaves you wanting more. The only drawback of this brew is that the carbonation is a little harsh."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"One weird stout, can't say that I like it much, its interesting enough but something just doesn't sit well with me on this stuff."
"Drinkability: While I don't think that $1.59 for this bottle was out of line...it will be awhile before I pick up another."
"Pours a very dark, almost black, color with faint reddish highlights and a creamy tan head that fades into a sticky lace. Nose is roasted malts with notes of sweet dark fruits and a smoky earthiness. Body is decent but perhaps a bit thin for the style. Taste begins with sweet black malts and notes of caramel followed by some unsweetened chocolate and a bit of charcoal. Finish is crisp and dry. Not a bad stout, but nothing special."
"Notes: Stout Light come to mind when I drink this. It has the makings of a good beer, but falls short in my two most important categories which is taste and mouthfeel. Too thin! Cheers!"
"The drinkability is fine if you are a fan of stouts. This could be used as the perfect decently done stout, great for giving to people who want to know what a stout will generally taste like if done right. It's not earthshattering, but there's nothing wrong with it. It's simply a good stout."
"drinkability code... O A I. no i don't remember what that meant, but i wrote 3.5 and remember this beer when i'm buying stouts and sometimes nab one."
"Drinkability is OK, this is better than Guinness but not among the best of it's type."
"Very, very dark chocolate amber, with a nearly brown-tan head that settles quickly. This is a pretty menacing looking stout. After smelling it, however, it's really not. The nose is sweeter than most stouts, somewhat fruity in nature, without a real hop presence, and is not particularly strong. Surprising, to say the least. The charred flavor is definitely present in the flavor, and the sweetness unfortunately takes a backseat. I would not call the flavor particularly bold. It has all the signs of a good stout, but the volume is turned down, almost like it needs to warm up, but it is at absolute room temperature."
"Pours an opaque black with a pillowy tan head that leaves behind some lace. Aroma of rosted grain, coffee, and a slight touch chickory. Flavor is on the sweet side, with some coffee and lactose notes. Not very much in terms of depth, but solid. Mouthfeel is medium to full with low to medium carbonation. A satisfying if unspectacular stout."
"Overall a decent stout, very drinkable and smooth just not exceptional."
"Bitter espresso, followed by a chalky astringent flavour. An odd hop flavour lingers. Medium bodied & somewhat oily w/ moderate carbonation."
"The beer has a smoky component that reminds me of Hillshire Farms Summer Sausage. If I was told this was a smoked beer, I would have believed it."
"The beer pours a dark black color with a thin brown head that fades to lacing. The aroma is of black and roasted barley; a real dark scent. The taste is great. It has a caramel taste to it. The presence of black barley cannot be ignored. It is very smooth and creamy; delicious. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with medium carbonation. This is a great drinking stout.; a real pleasure of a beer."
"Dark brown almost black color, decent size light brown lasting head that leaves good lacing, has chocolate and coffee aromas. Dark roasted malty chocolate and dark fruity flavors, medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel maybe a little thin, finishes with a nice dry bitterness."
"The bottle has a menacing hawk with glaring read eyes. The beer is extraordinarily dark brown, nearly black. Thin tan head with minimal lacing. Aroma is roasted malts with a subtle smokiness. The beer is essentially dry, with considerable hoppiness. It's medium to light bodied, and could stand to have a bit more fullness. Very pleasant bitter coffee taste that lingers into the aftertaste. Overall, it's a somewhat-better-than-average dry stout."
" This is a very roasty stout, but the flavor is not as big as it should be. Coffee is dominant, and there are touches of chocolate. This beer seemed to have a bit of a smoky flavor to it which was nice, but it really needed more of a base to it. The body was thin. If they intensified this brew a bit, it would approach the upper tier of stouts, but it falls way short."
"Poured a deep chocolate brown, nearly black color with some ruby tints shining through. Slight phenolic or tannins in the aroma, along with roasted grains, some chocolate and coffee. Light, almost watery body. Cordial cherry fruits in there along with some buttery qualities. Not as bad as I make it out to be. Easy to drink, but middle of the road as far as stouts go."
"Drinkability: If you can drink hoppy beers all night this is it, if not, have 1-2 and switch to something else."
"If I designed a barleywine/stout/porter hybrid, this would be it. This is a good beer to give to those that are afraid of dark beers. A stepping stone on the way to drinking a true stout."
"The aroma is a bit light and really has no predominant characteristic. The taste is of roasted malts with a prominent alcohol sense, light hops, and some coffee notes. Good smooth feel and very good drinkability from the medium body."
"If you are in a mellow mood, try this stout out. It is a pleasure to have as a sleepy time stout. Forget about sleepy time tea."
"Not a bad brew, but not the best. Color and head were nice, but aroma was somewhat lacking...faint malts. Taste was slightly malty, but lacked character..Mouthfeel was ok, but not great. No discernibel aftertatste...easy enoogh to drink, but needs more character."
"Not too bad, nice and dry. But lacks a bit of flavour and complexity, quite roasty, with some chocolate and caramel, with a slightly fizzy mouthfeel. Easy to drink, nothing outstanding, dry n'roasty. uncomplicated, but still very decent in the end.."
"Anyways, kudos that don't show up in the points to the brewery for having a nice theme for the labels. I hope they give $$$ to raptor recovery programs."
"Black color, large creamy head. Deeply roasted malts. Large bodied stout. Somewhat hoppy from a stout. Flavor is not as rich as most stouts. Flavor is more subtle and subdued. Milder taste. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is smooth and surprisingly dry. Aftertaste is malty and sweet."
"Notes: An average, or less than average, dry stout across the board. For what it's worth, still better than Guiness."
"Overall this beer doesn't have that smooth, creamy quality that I look for in a quality Dry Stout. Would not buy this one again."
"Flavor. This is definitely a dry stout. It finishes dry but the flavor has complexities of both hops and roasted malts. If there were such a thing as a ""session stout"" this is it. A beer novice should make this one of his/her first stouts."
"Drinkability: started off as marginal but really came on after a warming period. A little more bitter than I'd prefer but I don't feel full and I've got one more.... I let this one sit a bit and enjoyed the second half more."
"This is good. It's not spectacular, but it's full of good taste."
"This stout had no head and left zero lacing so ambieance was not good. Faint roasted aroma, dryish roasty flavor on the palate. Fairly smooth, but had a rather thin body, not that this is bad. I sometimes don't feel like drinking something akin to motor oil. A rather disappointing stout from a brewery that I wish put out better stuff. I love the Mendocino coast of Northern California, I wish I could love all of their beers, not just Red Tail. O.K. drinkability I guess but there are so many great stouts out there."
"Very dry, coffeish stout, Roasty like Guinness but with more roasty and coffee overtones. The beer is black and very true to a coffee stout with a dry finish. Malts and hops are nicely balanced as the ale warms up and the blend becomes sweeter. A nice stout to seek out with low ABV."
"Drinkability: Certainly more ""refreshing"" than other stouts. Nothing too heavy on the palate at the end and not horribly complex. Perhaps a good ""1st stout""-type beer to introduce someone to the category?"
"What a boring, boring stout. Even though I tried this in context with several other boring, boring stouts, this was still more boring. The flavor is thin for style. It wasn't too burned bitter so I don't think the problem was overreliance on black pattent. I'm not really sure what is wrong but I need a little richness in my stouts and this doesn't provide."
"A bit too top-heavy, this one: too much bitter and sweet, but not enough malt to give body and balance. Tasty nonetheless, so I can't fully fault this very, very, incredibly fruity stout."
"This stout pours black with a barely noticable brown head. There isn't much of an aroma, but what is there is mostly a sweet chocolate aroma. It has a pretty weak flavor that keeps you longing for something more. There is a slight roasted chocolate flavor to it, but it isn't much. The mediocrity of this beer in a way helps its drinkability, but you'll be wishing for something better the entire time."
"Well, the war in Iraq is a week old, and I sit here thankful as hell that, while Iraqis sit with Black Hawks overhead, I sit with this Black Hawk stout in hand instead. Black Hawk poured a deep, dark brown, not quite black, and had a very nice light brown head on top that held with medium retention. Aroma was roasted malts with a slight coffee smell. The mouthfeel was very smooth and silky, heavy bodied, and tasted softly of cocoa and mocha. I also noticed a coppery, metallic taste but it was really, really tiny - maybe just my imagination. The aftertaste was balanced out with a crisp hop bitterness, not too much however. The drinkability is surpisingly high, this beer just seemed to meld with my tastebuds well, very soft and balanced. From top to bottom this was a very enjoyable stout, and it is a competitor in my opinion with some of the top stouts."
"Pours a dark brown color with a thick, rich tan head that fades down slowly, that leaves a thick, sticky lace on the glass. There are some roasted malt aromas that are very apparent with slightly sweet undertones. The taste is like that of a strong coffee mixed with roasted malt and chocolate. There is a mild bitterness that comes through at the end of each drink. The body is medium and well balanced. This isnt the greatest stout that Ive had but it was still quite enjoyable."
"Deep black color with a tiny beige-brown hued bubbly head that carries a moderate lace. Flavor is heavy in notes of charcoal and 'burnt' tasting coffee. Fairly bitter and acidic tasting (as noted by Bros). Body is full but not overly heavy. Carbonation is fairly light. To some this may be a drinkable beer but for me I couldnt have another of these with out some salted peanuts or something to distract from the charcoal-like flavor."
"This stout poured black with light brown, creamy foam that left a good coating down the glass. The initial smell was rich: dark roasted malt, chicory, and coffee. However, this smell dissipated rapidly, and by the last sip, there was not much smell left. The taste was initially somewhat sweet and malty, followed by floral hops, and then a clean, bitter hop finish. The mouthfeel was smooth, medium bodied, with low carbonation, and a dry finish. Overall, a nice, drinkable stout. Quite tasty and easy to drink."
"100th review, I must choose a stout. Black Hawk Stout randomly makes its way to my fridge. It's pitch black like a stout should be. But hardly any head formed at all, very disappointing. I poured it kind of roughly too. But then the aroma kicked in and made up for it in a way. It's a wonderful mix of dark fruits, molasses, milky sweetness, and roastiness. Just as the label says, this is a crisp and refreshing stout. There's not much of a coating and thick type of feel to it. It's medium bodied and crisp. The flavors don't really live up to the aroma though. I tasted mostly roastiness and hops. It's not unpleasant by any means, very smooth actually. I was yearning for something more to come out of the flavor though. I enjoyed the hoppy and crisp finish and the hoppy aftertaste. This is a stout worth trying. It's not gonna knock your socks off, but it'll make 'em loose. I feel that the drinkability and aroma are the best qualities."
"Clear, anthracite (hehe) brew with thin rims of chestnut when held to the light. Forms a tan head which quickly thins, atop medium-large bubbles with moderate carbonation. Solid sheets of lace are left in its wake. Aroma is akin to a Mackeson XXX Stout....sweet vanilla, light molasses, moderate fruity esters, and bittersweet chocolate. Mouthfeel is thin and dry, with a light to medium body. Taste starts out with an astringent bite of chocolate malt, fades into a brief metallic note, followed by thin black patent and roasted barley with a moderately sweet backbone, ending in a highly astringent, lightly grainy crystal malt/french-roast coffee/oak flavor with some slightly rubbery bittering hops and more metallic notes when licking the gums. The alcohol is slightly perceptable. Drinkability is decent despite the bone-dry finish. Not a bad beer, but likened to a Diet Mackeson XXX Stout + oak chips. If you like Sinebrychoff Porter, then you may like this, with it's dry, woody finish and lighter body."
"I really like this beer. The head is a little on the creamy side at first but then shrinks down to a light foam. The nose is metallic which is kind of repulsive but the rest of the beer is quite good. It is almost black in color but a little bit of red shines through at the bottom of the glass. The hop combination is quite appealing to me and mixes well with the roasted, smoky taste. As I moved through the beer I picked up a few hints of coffee and toast. This stout has a chewy characteristic to its mouthfeel which I find to be quite good. There is also a slight sweetness that is barely detectable. All things considered, this is a really good beer aside from the nose. The taste is complex. The hops are great. I will definitely have this again."
"Pretty damn near black, with a persistant dark tan head. Aroma is pleasantly roasty but lacking much complexity. The flavor too is dominated by a roasty maltiness, which takes on the character of bittersweet chocolate about mid-palate and finishes with a significant hop presence. Medium-full in body, with a creamy texture and a dry finish. Nice."
"Pours out to be quite the blackish brew with a bit of tan head. Tastes of burnt chocolate and black malt. This is a good stout. Certainly worth drinking, but there are many better stouts on the market. A dry finish keeps you sipping this beer all night."
"It poured a very dark brown/black with a healthy dark tan head. The head receded fairly slow leaving only a slight amount of lace work behind. The smell was a blend of coffee, chocolate, and roasted grains; of which none heavily dominated the others. The taste was initially a blend of coffee and chocolate, and then nicely moved to the malts. A slight spicy after taste was present that finished off nice and dry. This was my first taste of this brew and chances are I will try it again if other selections above what I can get are not available."
"A bit too dry and overly oxidized malt I guess, I'll put the rest of the 6er to task for black and tans to get more flavor into the mix. Not bad, but my heart lies with the 2 aforementioned competitors."
"Overall a good stout that has a nice complexity of flavors and a unique body for a bottled stout. This is the only bottled stout that I drink at room temp from the get go. Cooling or chilling Black Hawk does nothing for it in any form or fashion. Even in the summer I don't chill this one (I do live in Maine though)."
"This is an average stout. It tasts good, but only because i love the style. I would drink it if offered it again, but i dont think i would buy it again unless i really had a hankering for the style and had no better options."
"The bottle states 'The Legend Grows.' I think Mendocino should pat themselves on the back less, and work on their brews more. They may have been one of the pioneering micros way-back-when, but you can do so much better these days..."
"Opaque black with a frothy, cakelike burnt tan head, which dwindles quickly to a dark lace. Roasted and caramel malt aromas with some fruitiness. A metallic twang on the tongue, with some citrus-like hop flavors and roasted malts. It's dry--not as sweet as it smells. Finish is bitter and drawn out. It's not bad, probably nothing I'd pick up again though."
"The quintessential deep brown to black color of the ""stout style with a head that is monstrous in size, creamy in its texture, light chocolate brown in its color. Lace is in thick sticky sheets that cling mightily to the glass. Sweet chocolate aroma, coffee, roasted grains also make the nose quite aromatic. The sweet taste of chocolate starts it off with the malts right before the top which is rich and thick, the finish sparingly acidic, the hops stately in their spicy bite and the semi-sweet chocolate dry aftertaste ends a quite good stout."
"The head is a beautiful sight, Rocky, Brown and standing proud.  The color is to style. Aroma says hops in 10 foot tall letters (likeable).  Although the taste settles into a niceness, first impression is a sharp almost astringent/dry sensation. This pushed me away.  Perhaps I served it too cold as it mellowed as the glass warmed. Worth a try but I'm not likely to pay the price when there is so much competition @ 10 bucks a six."
"Shame really, if MBC dry-hopped this, I think it would be marvellous."
"Pours a pitch black color with a very good rocky head, with good pockets. On the nose the aroma was of molasses, dark fruits, coffee, milky, and some caramel as well. On the palate the aromas can all be tasted, robust, molassess, coffee, sweet, nice hop bitterness, hints of chocolate, little roasted astringency, black raisins. Overall a very good Stout, better if you let it warm up first."
"Dark chocolate appearance with a creamy tan head that settles slowly.  Toffee-like character in the nose, along with some sweet undertones.  Rich, creamy, coffee-like flavor with underlying caramel sweetness, more toffee-like character, and just a little kick of bitterness from the hops.  The body is closer to medium than full.  Creamy sweetness makes for a great mouthfeel and very good all-around drinkability.  I like a more full-bodied stout, but this is still a great brew, and a pretty good representation of the style."
"A decent stout, nothing special … just a well rounded stout that lacks bit of character."
"I'll drink it again and recommend it as well.  While it is not slap-yo-momma fantastic it is a really, really good Stout."
"Virtually black and opaque, w/ a hint of deep garnet when held to light.  Thick, slowly receding, dark tan large bubbled head leaves coarse lace.  The uniquely fruity aroma is combination of lightly tart esters, roasted barley, and caramel sweetness w/ subdued notes of chocolate malt.  Unfortunately fruity esters carry a bit too strongly into the flavor profile, and partially mask black patent and chocolate contributions.  Buttery diacetyl and light caramel sweetness dominate once the fruitiness fades, and this stout is left a tad one dimensional.  Lightly bodied.  Finishes dry w/ a hint of black malt sharpness and fruity tartness fading abruptly.  Black Hawk is an interesting stout, but was lacking in malt character.  Its fruitiness makes trying it worthwhile."
"Lots of big brown head on the pour.  Not much nose at all.  Black color.  Smokey roast malt flavor, but lacking complexity.  Carbonated mouth.  Slight hint of coffee in the finish.  I was not particularly impressed but it is drinkable."
"Picture a nitro stout. Remove the head completely then throw a narrow rubber band the circumference of your glass in its place. Black Hawk. Malt fruity nose. Mellow malt kicks back on the couch and watches the roast barley and citric hops pummel your buds. Very PNW and very good."
"The hops in this one tended to dominate this stout's finish. It looks great, albeit thin and would be a nice stout for those liking more a hop presence in their stout."
"Pours jet black with a thick creamy brown head.  The aroma is very nutty and very unique.  There is a very unique nutty taste in this stout that really appeals to me.  I also pick up some toffee on the tongue.  Pretty bitter.  A unique stout worth a try."
"Thinnish and on the dry side...impressive creamy head....definitely a stout with bite..dark burnt malt up front...just a hint of caramel midway through...lovely aromoa...just a bit too dry on the finish for my liking.."
"A very dark roasted malt flavor, nice head, but far more subtle and real then the almost burnt taste of something like Guinness Extra (hardly needing its fortified capacity now that it comes from Canada)...as far as Black Hawk, I was a little disappointed by its mouthfeel (could have been creamier) but the aromas and head were great...great American rendition of a stout..."
"Notes: Black Hawk Stout one helluva stout, and another top-notch beer from Mendocino. Quite complex and what you'd also expect from Mendocino. Most definitely give it a try."
"I didn't findjust a plain stout catagory, it is not really sweet, nor is it a dry stout. It is someplace in the middle. It is just a good solid stout."
