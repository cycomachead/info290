3.58,-3.2,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This irish stout pours a near black color with a short lived tan head that leaves decent lacing. The aroma is a robust blend of chocolate, coffee, and malt. It is reminiscent of guiness (not the bottle but fresh and on tap). The mouthfeel is rather light, more porter than stout. The flavor is a typical stout quality but has a metallic quality that is a turn off. This is good and if pushed a touch further could be great. Get the Publican Porter instead if you can.","lochef81","May 01, 2014"

4.1,10.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 2/25/2013. Pours pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, dark bread, light char, light smoke, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, dark bread, light char, light smoke, and roasted earthiness. Light coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, dark bread, light roast, light smoke, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of dark roasted malt flavors; with big robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent dry stout! All around great balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/roasted malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 05, 2013"

3.93,6.2,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"I thought the easiest way to describe this beer is to compare it to a Guiness, which I would consider the standard for an irish stout (if it truly is I have no idea). I think this brew from shorts stacks up favorably. There are many similar characteristics. The malt, aroma, bitterness, is all very similar. I would say this beer has a bit more going for it. The head is frothy rather than creamy and the taste is a little more acidic rather than smooth. It has a nuttiness to it, almost like roasted pecans. The moutfeel is medium and drinkable. I let this beer warm over the course of an hour or so and it's flavor profile held true throughout. I will say that it became softer with warmth, more drinkable, but that's not to say it was boozy from the start. Overall I think this is a really great every day stout.

Aroma that I get out of this is a little bit of coffee but also leather and roast matls. Medium/light mouthfeel. The taste is Slightly sweet up front with a big leather and slightly bitter ending. Ends rather crisply and dry but the flavors linger on a bit. Good lace left on the glass. Has a slight touch of alcohol taste. Hmm, not a huge fan but not terrible either. Pretty carbonated.","kbutler1","Sep 04, 2010"
3.53,-4.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Definitely a different take on an Irish Stout here, with the tart fruity tang of this really standing out. It wasn't necessarily unpleasant but just different, as the other aspects of this were mostly well done. I'm curious as to just how different this one ended up being in the bottle.","Kegatron","Beers"
2.81,-24.1,2.5,4,2.5,3,2,"Overall- drink this beer semi cold. i through my first one in the freezer for 10 minutes when it was already somewhat cold and it had a funky fruity/ sour taste. when it warms up this beer has potential it just walks a thin line. really dry. will never buy this again. i'll give irish dry stouts another try but if they're all like this then i'm good.","claminat420","0"
3.38,-8.6,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"D - Not sure I'm feeling the style very much. Maybe the beer had to still chill for a bit. Glad I got to try it, but I don't need to seek this one out.","Kaiser81","Aug 02, 2010"
3.5,-5.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Jet black color though somewhat "muddy" looking. nice head and leaves a layer of lace at each sip. Mellow, somewhat roasted and mildly cocoa aroma. Decent flavor-again mild roasted and cocoa flavors. Pleasantly dry with a definate grainy taste to it. Licorice/sourness flavors come thru near the end, and tend to be too much overall. Solid mouthfeel. Decent stout, though the somewhat off taste of whatever flavor I am getting would make too many of these hard to swallow.","lackenhauser","Jul 27, 2010"
3.53,-4.6,4,3.5,3.5,2.5,4,"Pours black with big initial beige foam, that tapers off to leaving some thick lace in the glass. Coffee astringency up front. Sourness on the back end, with sugar more at the end of the bottle. Dry aftertaste. Flavours going on, and that keeps me drinking for interest. Some anise. Big burping carbonation, yet this is 8 months aged. You sold it,I rate it and the sourness may be attributable to an oops infection batch, and it is more evident in the aromas at the end of the glass, along with roast.","Sammy","Jun 29, 2010"

Light tan head, gone right away...Super light aroma, a little light coffee but that's it...The taste is super light and sweet on the front. On the finish some very light coffee, just not a ton of flavor here. A light coffee sessional.","jrallen34","Jun 01, 2010"
3.74,1.1,3.5,4.5,3,3.5,4.5,"Comes out of the bottle a typical opaque dark with beige head. The real joy of this beer is in the aroma. Rich musky roasted malt, house blend coffee, a touch of cocoa powder. Flavor is pleasant and mild of java and dry chocolate cake. Mouthfeel is light and thin and a little metallic in the finish. This makes the beer quite drinkable.","ahking","May 22, 2010"

Slightly lactic and creamy with a lot of bittersweet dark chocolate, oatmeal, toffee, roasted coffee bean and burnt wood. There's also a very prominent hop bitterness especially toward the end of the palate which lingers into a very acrid dry finish. Sweet alcohol is present mid palate, lasting through the finish, but there is a bit of silky viscous burnt chocolate maltiness in the end of the swallow. This beer isn't as smooth or creamy as it claims to be and overall this beer has a really harsh acrid/burnt character that makes it difficult to drink.

Pours a dry-stout-dark-brown with a fair bit of tan head. Smells of burnt, charred malts. Taste is, as expected, quite dry. Again, those burnt malts, a tad of caramel and dark roasted coffee.
