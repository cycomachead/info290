"overall its not a bad beer, however i prefer a thicker, stronger, more robust stout. i was introduced to Guinness a long time ago with Irish car bombs. but now i ask for an English car bomb. (i find no difference between draught in nitro cans or bottles)"

"Great classic beer. I wish it had more hoppy flavor. Although it's pitch black and high in calories the taste is light. Almost too light. I still love Guinness but I always crave more. The mouthfeel of nitro beers is always great but in my opinion Guinness is a little watery. Personally I still think it's better than Murphy's."

"The feel of course offers lots of creaminess on the tongue and it flows like silk. It does have that thinness as well, though again style is in mind and it's not intended to be any kind of imperial stout. There is a slight grainy astringency in the finish."
""
"Must try and must mix into blacks & Tans. Pour your IPA or any ale and then top coatt with Guinness!"

"The beer is an institution. They actually get quite a bit out of the beer for the low alcohol level."

"Overall, this is not my favorite stout - the body is a bit too light and the taste a bit weaker than I prefer. I feel like a warm pint on tap would be better."

"I used to think this was what dark beer was all about, which is why I used to drink Miller Lite. I've grown up since then, and moved on to real beer. If you're on this site, you're probably only reading this b/c you agree with me. Guinness is just bland anymore, as far as stoudts go."

"O - This is the Guinness that everyone associates with the brand, and much better WITHOUT the nitro. That said, it's a classic, but ultimately a little too bland and boring for my personal tastes."

"A merely decent stout."
"Guinness is my macro-brew beer of choice. It's not great, but it's not at all bad, and at such a low ABV, you can enjoy them all night without making a fool of yourself."

"The best beer I have ever had, hands down. The creaminess of this beer is matched by no other. The chocolate, coffe flavors come straight through, with no after taste. Not to heavy, not to light. Simply perfect. The model which all stouts are made after."

"Black color. No oxidation. Flat body, very watery and tasteless or nearly so. Just a bit of roasted malt but then, really super discreet. Creamy touch unappetizing. Finish slightly bitter but with this industrial side well disgusting. Really not good at all. It seems clear that a cut Guinness Draught Classic with water."
""

"Overall: It's impossible not to drink this. Carbonation is off-putting from a can/bottle but great on tap. I average that as above average."
"Head is well lasting, laces the glass nicely. The taste is of coffee and dark unsweetened chocolate and a tangy bite of bitterness. The nitro bottle is the closest thing to bringing the pub home!"
"O: Guinness has always come off as adequate and this time is no different. You can defiantly do way worse and vice versa. I would recommend buying this in bulks for parties, beer pong, and etc... I actually seem to prefer the nitro can, oppose to the bottle. I heard it's really good on tap in Ireland, but I'm not visiting anytime soon."
"D: Good for that stout mood you might get in when the craft store is closed."
"The nose brings some very light chocolate and roasted malt. It's hiding in the background. Some light toffee as well. The flavor is a bit unappetizing. There's too much toffee and not enough roast. The creaminess further enhances the toffee flavor. I think there's probably a touch of diacetyl in there, but not too much. Mild roast that really doesn't come through until the finish, which is too dry. Not a big fan of this one, other than looking at it."
"Note: I don't really understand this ""extra-cold"" stuff... I assumed I was drinking a Guinness draught? but I don't really know now..."
"I'm not a big fan of pasteurized beer generally...additionally, this is the least flavorful iteration of Guinness I've tried so far..."
"Poured from a 14.9 oz. nitro can. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some malts and slightly sweet. Taste is also rather mild, some malts, much less flavor than some other Guinness stouts. Feels creamy in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"Lets just start by saying that I wasn't the biggest beer drinker until I started drinking this. I really do enjoy this beer and its got a great flavor and full body and the color is something to be liked as well. This beer kicks ass and a good one to start drinking with"
"Dr: Sure I'd have it again, but in Glasgow's real ale/cask ale scene, why bother? Guinness draught is better outright. The price is right, but the abv is low."
"The aroma is darkly toasted malt with some wisps of very dark fruit, not much cocoa or chocolate though. Those notes translate to the flavor as well, but with muted effectiveness. The flavors are thwarted by a creamy flatness (I don't what else to call it) which is not desirable."
"Thanks to the nitro-bottle, this beer pour beautifully. I absolutely love the way Guinness looks when it's from a nitro tap, and this looks exactly the same. Pours with a thick appearance that looks like a chocolate milkshake. It turns from a creamy brown color to a very transparent black. When held up to light you can see through this and it is a dark red color. Big creamy head on this one. It looks like what a cappuccino would look like. Now I had to write a lot about the appearance, because that's the best part of this beer...it kinda goes downhill from here. Scent is quite pleasant with some chocolate and malt notes. Also has a kinda skunky scent as well though. Taste is WAY TOO WATERY! The flavors of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and some vanilla are there, but just way too watered down. The mouthfeel is just like I said, way too watered down and flat. I know this is because of the nitro, but I've had bears that weren't this flat from nitro taps. Drinkability is somewhat high if you enjoy drinking chocolate flavored water."
"D - I feel like this may be a bad representation of guinness and I will definitely try different variations in the future, but this one does not impress at all."
"On tap from brewpubs across Ireland during my visit in 2001. Guinness Extra Cold is a chilled version of the classic Irish dry stout Guinness. Pours the same appearance as a draught - nice head and laces that lingers throughout the drinking session. Aroma of coffee and stout chocolate. Great carbonation and medium body throughout. Tastes wonderful being extra cold. Really liked the igloo on top of the tab handles. Too bad they're not served in the States. The beer is brewed at the James Gate Brewery in Dublin, Ireland and would be a great pint if it was served at normal ale temperature of around 8-12 degrees. Needless to say, even if the beer was too cold, it was still quite quaffable!"
"low carbonation and very creamy it is drinkable, but does not invite for a lot. Probably wont buy it again."
"Not the worst beer in the world, and quite sessionable, tis a pitty the beer has some off putting scents and generally is quite bland and watery."
"Drinkability: This beer looks wicked cool, but once you start pouring it back it's a real disappointment. If you want something light that boosts your ego to own this is the beer, but for the price you're paying the overall experience is woefully unimpressive. Thankfully there are stronger versions of this iconic brand available on the shelves."
"Drinkability - I've been known to kill a 6 pack during a basketball game. Overall a good standby stout without getting too expensive or adventurous."
"D- Drink 1 you gotta have 6."
"Overall still not impressed, my first guinness and i was so excited over all the hype but i was not impressed, i expected so much more, but then again popular beers are usually the worst beers because they are made to please the mass population not the Beer Advocates"
"D - good for a session. I like drinking this out at the bar. though it's mild by ""good"" beer standards you sure look cooler drinking this than miller lite."
"When it comes to smell maybe I got a bit of chocolate and malt, but it's mild. The taste is sour and watery, not much depth. It feels surprisely thin in the mouth, lots of water. The looks sets your brain for something better, thus the whole experience is dissapointing, however it works as a ""light"" beer, if I may say."
"A really crappy stout to say the least. Hugely popular in the UK though. Maybe even more so than the regular Guinness Draught from what I could tell. All marketing and nothing else. Avoid."
"I would pick up the Extra Stout far before this and if that's not available there are other Dark beers out there."
"Notes. Great session beer, good when you want something nice and smooth without losing ALL of its flavor, Nice mild beer. Great choice at a bar when there are mostly macros."
"Almost as if black food coloring fell into some flat and old Budweiser (but this has even less alcohol in it)."
"Appearance is black like coffee with a white creamy head. The smell is is on the mild side with a dash of a typical porter, if I dare to say. The taste is smooth, creamy, and light. Its like the bud light for porters/ stouts, in a good way though. This beer doesn't have any carbonation which make this quite a unique experience. There is something about this beer that is oddly addicting. It Finishes smooth and mild with a slight malt aftertaste creeping though at the end. This beer is truly a one of a kind in fact, I can't think of another beer in the world that is quite like this. But if someone knows of one, LET ME KNOW..."
"D: Overall, this is an ubiquitous beer and nothing amazing. That being said, I enjoy it, and will often choose it when at a bar and must choose between this and the usual macro suspects."
"Beer is thin, this is the beer that people say its bread in a glass. Its about as light as beer can get. Its creamy in the mouth. Its a little sweet, its a little roasty, finishes cleanly. I pounded it in a few minutes without realizing it. I could drink a dozen of these."
"It's no Extra Stout or Foreign Extra Stout (which are way better), but to me- this Guinness is the Guinness to have for a session. Incredible drinkability, Silky texture, and satisfying for ""what it is""."
"So this isn't a bad beer, but it certainly isn't good - lacks way too much flavor. I'd take the extra stout over this anyday."
"Go Ireland !"
"D- Although very thick, delightful to drink. Enjoy this beer over and over."
"cheers"
"The Draught is drinkable, in that it is easy to drink, but I don't think I would want more than two of them at a time."
"O- A damn good beer, as always."
"Serving type: nitro-bottle"
"D- Great drinkability due to the low abv and the thin mouthfeel."
"D= Drinkable but it just doesn't impress me as a ""beer"" for some reason. Simply not impressed."
"The Draught is good, but it's no Extra Stout."
"D - 4.2% ABV. 'nuff said."
"D - Poundable, but I love to enjoy and appreciate just one."
"Guinness will always hold a special place in my heart, it's just not on my radar these days."
"Drinkability - could pound these all night, and at the moment, that's exactly what I'm doing! :)"
"Drinkability: I'm not Irish, but I must say this is one beer I can knock back. Being a student, this is my go to party beer :)."
"Served from bottle into Euro Pint. Pours a dark dark brown with a red hue when looking down onto the beer. Has a one finger off-white head that stays until the end. Has an awesome pouring 'show' with the carbonation slowly making its way to the top. The aroma has slight nutty and malty hints. The flavor is light on the palate with little to no carbonation with malty notes. Overall this is not horrible, but it is definitely not a beer I typically buy with the availability. It will probably stay that way however..."
"Instead, I'd opt up to the four-pack cans of Guinness. You can pour it into a glass, savor the aroma, and it's full flavor is there. Or best-yet, find it served properly at a local bar. This twelve-pack bottled variety, although convenient, is not the real Guinness taste that makes it the unofficial beer of St. Patty's Day."
"Overall, I can understand the appeal of this beer but don't find it very appealing myself. I think it is thin and lacks enough complexity to make it a decent session beer. I actually prefer the Foreign Export version in the bottles without the widget and think that they have more flavor and better body. I'll have to put in another review next time I have the other version."
"Drinkability - I could drink this all day if I wanted to, but then again, the same with Pabst. And just the same with Pabst, only if I were having a particularly poor and alcoholic week."
"Overall: Very dissapointed I bought a six pack and am thinking of giving the rest away. Don't waste your money on this beer."
"I had this years ago while visiting Scottland before I was a hard core beer advocate. I wasn't a fan of Guinness but trying this in Scottland was amazing. I guess drinking Guinness fresh is a big difference. It actually got me to appreciate regular Gunniess in the states and was one of my transition beers into the wonderful world of craft beer. Guinness will always have respect from me as getting me to appreciate better beer. The coolest thing while I was thee was seeing a bartender pour a beer with a shamrock on the top."
"Notes: Pretty much the same as the regular Guinness Draught. Also suffers from the same problems. Too light and watery and not enough flavor. Not bad and has its place, but not one you will search for."
"I wasn't around for the good old days of Guinness, thus I have very little basis for comparison, but I think it's safe to say that I can't quite wrap my head around the fact that people rave about it. It's not really all that bad, but it's not all that good, especially for the price. With options like Carlow, Paper City or Murphy's dry stout are readily available, I have little desire to drink this. Sadly, Beamish is gone."
"Appearance is a very dark brown with the nitro made off white creamy head leaving almost a curtain of lace. Smell has light roasted malts, coffee and chocolate with a faint dark fruit note. Taste of roasted malts, coffee and light chocolate with light hop. Mouthfeel has a creamy smoothness that goes down slick with little carbonation. A little watered down from other stouts, but one I'd love to try on tap."
"Buy Again? On tap in a bar, yes. Otherwise, I’d have to see what is available."
"Hmmm. This one present and interesting conundrum. On the one hand you want to slam it hard. I mean who ever heard of a Guinness brewed for COLD. They do not belong in the same sentence. However when you try to get inside the brewers head you can't help but come up with love. As a beer this is pretty unimpresssive. The label states that this is to be consumed from the bottle. Not much to look at or smell. You can sniff out some roasted malt and earthy hops if you try but the flavor is a notch above BMC as there is a roasted grain presence. A bit of real hops as well. The upshot is this is a beer brewed for those times when a real beer lover is trapped. You know what I'm talkin' about. The bars that only have iced bottles no taps. Viewed in that light this beer is a life line for those of us who are looking at a night of ice cold piss or something closer to beer. The thin feel is a bit of a letdown but it does enhance drinkability, enabling you to quaff at a dangerous clip. So remember this is a beer for club night and it aint' so bad. Just order one and slam it down with your buddies and before you know it you're one of the guys not a beer snob."
"Suck 'em down in a hurry (and then move on to a better beer)."
"A nice stout. But not one I would seek out."
"Overall- I really do still like this beer. I still have never had it on tap or out of a nitro can which is supposed to be better. And now that I have had the oppurtunity to try Extra Stout I am still kind of jaded by that. But that isn't fair because that is like comparing an Xbox to and Xbox 360. Both beers are winners but I just prefer the Extra Stout. Don't get me wrong I will continue to drink this stuff because it is a very good session beer."
"UPDATE 2011 - Not bad, it grew on me a bit over the years but still sometimes can be undesirable to me."
"D: Very rich, easy to drink and low abv, makes this beer exceptional to drink in excess."
"Its a bitter boggy taste that doesn't give a sharp carbonated bite. It's smooth and very flavorful but its again not for everyone."
"Drinkability: I guess you have to be European to enjoy this. I will never buy this again."
"Taste is a bit disappointing, quite watery and tame, a bit roasty but not too much here. I'd say the nitro can or draft is the way to go for this beer, skip the bottle."
"While I like the beer from a tap more, it isn't bad in bottle form, except that you are supposed to drink it from the bottle...a little weird, but whatever. Looked pretty good, tasted decent, smelled like Guinness, had a wonderfully thick mouthfeel. Overall drinkability was great...Easy to take the bottle with you places rather than having to utilize a tap system."
"This is not a bad beer, but it feels like it lacks in everything. The Guinness Extra Stout is a far superior beer to this, in my humble opinion. This simply tastes weak and watered-down in comparison. Frankly, I'm disappointed that I bought a whole 24 pack of this and I'm going to have to either pass it on to someone (who doesn't realize or care how much better the extra stout is) or I'll have to get rid of it some other way. The prospect of drinking this over the next couple weeks does not appeal to me in the slightest."
"T: Roasted malts and a coffee-like taste swims inside my mouth. silky to the touch as to the pour. its a mild bodied beer, and although the palate is not too stimulated, this non-carbonated drink is very smooth and easy to drink. good lacing. very high drinkablility. A Definite pleasure!"
"D: great i can have alot of these not problem cheers"
"I think the thing I like most about Guinness Draught is pouring it from a nitro-can to obtain that perfect Guinness pour. It really is a beautiful thing when it settles. Appearance gets a high score here, but everything else falls short. I used to think it was pitch black, but now that I am reviewing it, I can see that it really is a dark brown with red highlights. The smell is of toasty malts and barley. No hop presence. Smells sweet of oak and vanilla as well. Taste is dry, and dull with some chocolate and oaky notes. A dry stout is a dry stout, what can I say. I also used to think that drinking these was like drinking a milkshake, but now it is rather thin on my palate. It certainly is creamy with the help of the nitro induced head. Very drinkable beer, low abv, so a few won't put you back too much. A solid Irish dry and I will never hesitate to order a nice and cold one at local bars."
"Everything about the same as the bottle or the can but it seems to bee alot more drinkable i mean alot more drinkable like as wheare i can lose count of how many i drank and then try to walk striaght but it is still missing something when it comes to mouthfeel like something thats in every other beer i have tried i do not know its just seems flat"
"brilliant!"
"While I really enjoy their extra stout and anniversary beer, I personally think this is my favorite."
"D - I could, and have, had these all night. Fantastic all around and not so rich (actually not very rich at all) that they can't be pounded (something I've also done). The last sip of all the foam is something to look forward to."
"Drinkability: This is an easy drinking brew, with good flavor and nice simple complexity without trying to do too much. This is not an afternoon BBQ beer, but a nice steak dinner brew for those looking for a change."
"Well, it's not cool, but it's still better than the extra-metal, extra-watery light beers. Still, it's extremely weak for a stout. It makes me wonder if the tap version is better at the pubs... The only exciting thing about it is...breaking it once empty. Yep. Put it in a bag, smash it against the wall and take a look at that widget."
" As such, not bad, nothing outstanding - a sturdy drinker in either the summer heat or winter cold. A very sessionable brew."
"Guinness on tap is just about my favorite beer but the nitro-bottle version is no where close. Its a good choice when you're out of options but I wont be getting it as a first pick any more. Pretty weak on the nose and pretty watery body. The widget banging around inside got kind of annoying after a while too. Still very smooth and easy to drink though. This version doesnt do the beer any justice."
"What a disappointment compared to real draft Guinness or even the Extra Stout. This watery tasting beverage seems devoid of real stout characteristics. Where are the roasted, coffee-like flavors? Where is the dry, bitter finish? No, this is no Guinness. This is a cheap imitation being put forth by Walstreet robots trying to earn a cheap dollar. One more reason I hate the robot takeover of humanity... robots have no tastebuds."
"D: This is not my go-to stout. I expected more from the heavily advertised company and I just cannot see why people enjoy this. There are plenty of other better stouts out there."
"M-D- Mouthfeel is very nice. Has a very morning like coffee feel. That being said it is smooth like a wake up beer as coffee is to wakeing up in the morning. Milky feel rolls over the tongue..very easy. As drinkable as a dry stout gets. Highly recommended for massive drinking from pub pints! Add Strongbow for extra flavor."
"Guinness is a great Beer. I like this version but I really prefer it on tap. My problem is that it gets warm pretty easily and when its warm it's kind of hard to drink. It goes down smooth and it great on it's own. Sometimes I am in the mood for a Guinness. I love it even more on Tap. I am not a fan when it's in a can. Nitro Bottle and Tap are the way to go."
"Pours a nice dark opaque pour with medium carbonation. One finger head with great retention and lacing. Has an immediate malty and mild chocolate and coffee aroma. Upon tasting, you can definitely taste the malts and there is a nice subtle chocolate flavor towards the end. The mouthfeel is very creamy and drinks like a chocolate milk. Very little carbonation at all. Coats the mouth very well and is very drinkable. Easily a session beer if you have limited options."
"What happened to the taste? It would seem that the boys at St. James's Gate have spent more time trying to figure out this widget thing than making a good beer. It is smooth, as it should be, but at a great sacrifice to flavour."
"Final Thoughts: My favorite Beer of all. Could drink this delightful beer all day, granted i could pay for it. Cost isnt an option though for what i enjoy. Try it if your a stought fan. The can made it nice cuz it was on sale"
"One of my everyday beers but not one of my favs... i guess that is what makes guinness so popular jeje"
"D- Most def. I could drink a pitcher of this. Tastses great in an Irish Car Bomb"
"Notes: I have a very fond memory from my childhood of going out to eat with my grandfather when I was around fourteen. I had heard of Guinness, so I jumped at the opportunity to taste his. I remember it tasting very heavy, very rich, and very, very bitter. Drinking this beer now I find none of those qualities. This could be that I was so young and I had never really had beer before, or it could be that Guinness has decided to ""dumb down"" their product. Judging by some of the other reviews on this site it's the latter, and this is such a shame. Regardless, this is definitely a beer to avoid - unless you're a fan of watery, tasteless, ""light stouts"" that bring shame upon the name of beer."
"Too bad there's not as much flavor as I'd remembered. This was one of my first stouts, and was pretty impressed with it for a while before I really began to learn what was out there."
"Overall - it's a great stout that can be drank at anytime... not expensive and a good beer to chill with"
"This brew left me hanging after the big build up from the pour."
"D: very drinkable, and light. the nitro makes this go down smoothly with little gas filling you up."
"After a summer in Ireland, Guinness is easily my favorite beer. Unfortunately, the only proper way to have one is from a tap in Ireland and poured by someone who knows the right way to do it. Of all of the Guinness products available in the USA, this comes closest. It is not quite as flavorful as in Ireland, but smooth and with the right feel. Excellent, particularly with dinner, goes down as smooth as water."
"Very drinkeable. Enough character and body to keep things interesting, but not so much as to make you say 'enough.'"
"It's drinkable, but it's a bit of a chore. I still have one left in my fridge and it's getting neglected due to a recent purchase of Irish Red."
"Overall: I'm just wondering what to do with the other one in my fridge (kidding). This serving does not live up to the Guinness Stout name that I know and love (and own a T-shirt even)."
"Note: it did say 'drink directly from the bottle'. So I tried it that way too. It made no difference."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass last night, a friend brought over a bunch of these for my dad, color was nearly black, big 1 1/2 inch tan head that was pretty soapy with a pillowy backdrop, leaves some lace at first, decent retention, smell is quite weak with roasted barley, burned malts, and some light bready scents, taste is rather dry, leaves a bit of a coating in the finish, roasted malts and barley is pretty much all I pick up, mouthfeel is slightly chewy and roasty, medium to full bodied, too much carbonation, could drink two of these and that would probably be about it, a little lighter than the standard Guinness I am used to having, would probably go for that over this if I had the choice, do not see myself having more of this any time soon, might be worth trying"
"Great start for someone looking to get into more advanced beers, and with it's wide availability, a good choice. Gotta love Guinness."
"Overall - This is still a stand-by as it is a quality beer and highly available, but I have had better stouts. I do think the nitro bottle has a positive effect on the head and the general appearance."
"Overall, a fine version of a classic stout, very easy to drink, and at only 4.2abv, certainly session worthy. Enjoy!!"
"Most folks not up on there beer assume this is a thick, heavy, high alcohol beer - nothing is farther from the truth. The only thing strong is the taste!"
"Overall I wish Guinness were a bit thicker and had more flavor because what faint flavor it has is wonderful but just not quite bold enough. This is very drinkable though especially for a stout, one of my favorites to have a few of."
"D - I actually enjoy Guinness Extra Cold a great deal. It's a great session brew, not too stout where it's hard to drink too many. Low ABV lends to it's drinkability. I was surprised to see this served at Lambeau Field when I watched the Packers make the Lions the first 0-16 team in the NFL this weekend. It was a great game to watch with a cold Guinness in hand."
" ~ While the nitrogen is supposed to add a nice creamy texture, I have never actually been a big fan. I think it masks the flavors dwelling within. I say pass on the Guinness Draught and go for a brew with some taste."
"D-Due to low alcohol content, this beer is very easy to drink. This is my go-to session beer when I don't feel like going the the beer store with a wide selection. This is my grocery-store beer of choice."
"This beer just isn't as good as what I remember it being."
"D- its pretty much like water, so it gets a 5 if you are looking at Bud Light's definition of drinkability"
"It is a very good beer drink with a smooth hint of coffee at the finish. Enjoyed this beer"
"D - This is the ultimate drinkable stout. Low ABV and smooth flavor. What it lacks in complexity it makes up for in pure drinkability. It goes well with anything from breakfast to a midnight snack. Cheers!"
"d: low abv, small bottles, and a solid taste is good enough for me"
"Drinkability- Was descent"
"Served in a stout glass as suggested extra cold. Has a dark brown cola color with a thin pale tan head. Smell is slightly of cola. Taste is mildly reflecting burnt toast and hazelnut, lacking much flavor possibly to make it more comparable to macro beers. Beer has mouthfeel almost like carbonated slurpy consitency or that of sucking on an ice cube. While by no means an exceptional stout, its by no means offensive, a mild and drinkable beer with a ""how low can you go?"" abv to boot."
"Stay away from this one!"
"overall impression= this beer is sexy and seductive"
"D: Decent session brew. Light body makes it very drinkable. Lack of complexity made me want a regular Guinness."
"Drinkability: It's still a Guinness, and therefore worth your hard earned dollars. It's not going to be your ""perfect pour", but it is still quite delicious."
"I also poured one into a glass. The Guiness visuals were of course amazing. Other than that... smell and taste were minimal. I can't believe I wasted beer money on these. The other 4 might be sink pours..."
"Thanks to Mr. Russev for bringing from Europe. Coffee and sugar aroma. Opaque dark brown with off-white head. Noticeably thin mouthfeel, though creamy from the nitro. Like old coffee grounds bitterness. Horrid really. We know they can make a drinkable version."
"Beer pours out extremely dark with a tan color dissipating throughout the beer. A very creamy white head along with excellent head retention ans lacing top off this beer. Smell was okay, somewhat malty with some hints of coffee. Taste wasn't all that exciting, coffee-like, malty once again, a hint of alcohol, finished off somewhat bitter. The beer was pretty smooth overall, creamy, and pretty drinkable. All-in-all though, it was somewhat disappointing."
"taste is creamy, bakers and milk chocolate, touch of vanilla bean ice cream, some coffee, end is slightly bitter and dry, excellent mouthfeel, creamy while drinking and dry after the swallow."
"A drinkable beer. It still tastes decent, and since it is on the thinner side, you can drink more than one."
"D - this was okay, not my favorite stout, but I have to respect it for what it is."
"Poured from a nitro-can into a pint glass. The beer poured what looked like a solid black, but when held up to light, it had some hints of red. Of course, when poured the beer provided a very nice cascade which started out brown before turning into the true color. The head was light brown, kind of reminded me of coffee with cream. The head was thick and was retained for the entire drink. The aroma was ok, seemed a bit weak, but it was a light malt aroma, not much else. The taste, again, was average at best, a light malt with a bit of sweetness. The was thick and creamy with little carbonation, but seemed a bit watered down. Drinkability was ok, but probably would reach for other stouts first."
"M + D: The mouthfeel is just too thin overall for my tastes. The nitro bottle just doesn't manage to bring out the creamy feeling I'd hope for. Granted, the styhle tends to be a little thinner and easy going to begin with, but it could afford to be a little heavier. Easy enough to drink back, which is a bit of a plus."
"D- Probably not the greatest stout out there, but for me it's always time for a guinness. Good memories, decent beer. If you get it on tap the best part is the nitro-head that tickles your lips as you drink."
"Notes: Defiantly one of the most recognizable stouts with that sweet looking head and deep dark color."
"Finish is somewhat short and roasty."
"Mouth-feel was just ok, the finish was very thin and watery."
"12oz bottle with the widget, which did its thing and produced the appearance of a draft pour. The beer was a very dark brown with a thick off-white head. While the head diminished in size, it persisted throughout, and was very sticky. The beer had a vaguely roasted malt/coffee aroma, with a similar taste. If you've had some better stouts, you'd consider this a little timid, more like a Stout Lite. Still, not a bad beer."
"Milder than it looks and smells. Light and dry, with more hop than one would expect. The dark chocolate really is the hook fior me. Thin and silky. Almost a smokiness to the finish of the last sips. Could definitely put more of these away by accident than necessary. Would be splendid with chocolate cream pie too!"
"Drinkability: They go down smooth. Mostly because of the low to no carbonation/nitro widget."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Acceptable at best. Drinking from the bottle as recommended does not make it any better."
"overall, i got this because it was on sale for $13.99 for a 12 pack and a free 20oz glass, i like the glass but will probably not buy the beer in the future"
"Not horrible. A lot different that most stouts. I can drink this stuff all night long though. I reserve this beer for St. Patty's day or other such long sessions."
"I used to dream of drinking Guinness as a kid because of how nice it looked when poured. Now I dream of not drinking it again (the Draught, at least) after being severely displeased with its taste."
"Being what it is, Irish Dry Stout, it is not bad, just not one of my favourite styles. The stuff is Okay for an occasional visit but I prefer Extra Stout without the widget."
"D - I could only drink one on any occasion, and I would drink one again. Lacks flavor volume for regularly repeated consumption, though.."
"THIS BEER REALLY EXISTS, BUT NONE OF THESE REVIEWS ARE REVIEWING IT!!...and it's definitely not the beer in the picture. THE BOTTLE IN THE PICTURE IS THE SAME RECIPE AS THE CANNED ""DRAUGHT," except it says 'serve extra cold.' In Scotland , and rarely in Ireland you will find a pub that has the appropriate nitro-tap. And this is exclusively on a nitro tap, which means the appearance, mouthfeel, and drinkability are incredible. BUT aside from the temp difference, I've heard the malt is slightly different from the typically draft. We used to slam these delisciously refreshing perfect examples of a good roasted barley, nightly ,when I lived in scotland. It deserves a better rating."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D - This is a very disappointing example of Guinness this is probably the reason why people think dark beer is shitty"
"Poured out a decent head that never receded, and left spotty traces of beige lace. Guinness always has great head retention, but head size seems to lack when served from anywhere but the tap. The color is a solid opaque black. Has a unique aroma that is distinct to Guinness. Lightly sweet, smokey, malty, bready, and slight hop notes detected in the smell. The taste has a very dry smokey flavor, like you just got done licking an ashtray. It is slightly sweet, but has along dry finish, and a touch of a lingering faint bitterness. Mouthfeel lacks in carbonation which is usual with Guinness. Mouthfeel is very watery and lacks any body for such a dark beer. The texture is as usual very creamy and always goes down smooth. It is very drinkable, but I find myself only drinking it a few random times throughout the year. I love it at St. Patty's Day as does everyone else. When I was in Ireland I drank it the whole week. It did have a different taste over there, which if I remember was a bit hoppier and maybe more carbonated. It's in a class by itself and it is what it is. There's no changing it now."
"Do yourself a favor and try the Guinness Extra Stout, which is sold for about the same price."
"A drinkable beer that I feel may not be the best to drink a lot of but a good beer to have if you want only one or two."
"EDIT - Sorry, I didn't even feel like giving this a real review. Go get a real beer."
"It looks like a Guinness Draught but is a little lighter. It has a roasted barley nose to it, just like Guinness Draught. The taste is where they seperate in comparison. It had a metallically almost flat taste, simmilar to that of an ice cube. Maybe too cold to have any flavor?"
"drinkability- 4.0"
" It makes it extra special wen the person pouring knows how to."
"Pouring a Guinness and watching as the head forms, changing colour from chocolate to a brwnish foam is a show. But I'm used to tap or Special Export and found this one bland. Smell of coffee and roasted, light in the palate and very watery. Taste of coffee with notes of chocolate and pepper. I miss the alcohol of the Special Export."
"The beer that basically changed my thought process on beer. Poured black into a 20oz Guinness pint with a dense white head. In the nose, hints of coffee and hops. Light in the palate, but filling and bitter. A great first step into beer, by realizing different tastes and colors."
"Pure advertising, but if you like the tap handle, go for it."
"I recommend that if in Ireland you seek Extra Cold out."
"Can't see why anyone would want this in preference to standard Guinness. Probably sounded good to the marketing boys in the board room. Sorry guys, not for me."
"No improvement. Still a good brew as Guinness is one of my favorite mass produced beers."
