"probably underrated here, this was the only beer i had at russian river that was neither hoppy or sour that really impressed me. its a big chalky textured stout thats as dry as they come, but loaded with deep earthy roast that never turns acrid or bitter. its drinkable too at a real low abv and a mouthfeel that almost leaves me thirsty. there are coffee notes in here too, rich and creamy in that way, but a dark chocolate complexion arises before the finish. i get the grain before the flavors it produces, which is how i like it. yeast has done a complete job here, residual sugar is nil. its really easy to put this one back, although maybe it does lack a finish just a bit. i had no idea russian river made beers that werent the hop bombs or the sours, and while most of the ones i tried were pretty pedestrian, this stout really stood out as a top quality beer."

"Guinness with deeper flavor, better body and color. I had this on nitro-tap and the mouthfeel was heavenly, rich and silky-smooth. I got some burnt malt but not overpowering as in some other stouts. I tasted caramel, chocolate and coffee with no off-putting sourness I've experienced in some stouts. Very crisp and refreshing finish. I highly recommend giving this one a try if you're near the brewery. It's a tap-only deal."

"On tap at the brewery in Santa Rosa. I'll start off by saying this was the best dry irish stout I have ever tasted. Dark black color, good tan head. Aroma was chocolate, coffee, dark malts, great. Flavor was exactly the same and so robust. This was delicious and I'd order pints regularly if I ever saw it on tap."

"Tried as part of a sampler at the brewery. This was a black pour with super creamy light brown khaki head. Chocolate and espresso on the aroma, plenty of roast to go along. Surprised at the big aroma for such a light stout. Big chocolate and roasted coffee flavor, finishes with lingering charred roast. This has more flavor than I have had in any dry stout. Nicely done. Very thin mouthfeel that goes down very easy with velvety carb. Not bad at all, and I would have this again despite this being one of my least favorite styles."

"M: It's medium body"
""
"This pours a dark coffee color with cocoa-colored foam. There’s a delicious roasty aroma that’s followed by a sweet roast on the palate, with hints of French roast coffee and dark chocolate notes. Finishes sweet. I like to call it dessert in a glass. Perfect capstone to a day of IPAS and Belgian sours."
""
"O: Not impressed. Would not have again or recommend to anyone other than people who like Guinness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkable enough at the start, but with the build up of ashiness on the back harms it. I'm surprised to say I didn't find this as good as I'd hoped. But then, maybe I just have unreasonable expectations."

"Overall: A nice stout, rich, good flavor but nothing overly special, still, i will not turn this one down!!"
""
""
""
"O - Pretty good stout, really liked the earthy flavor"
""
"A mild, smooth light cocao experience."
"Medium body and creamy from the nitro. A forgettable beer from RR."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark black with a solid finger of tan head. Mild bitter coffee and roast malt. Flavor is mostly bitter malt and black coffee. Thin with mild carbonation. Nothing really stands out. just another Irish stout. Then again. I didn't come here for a stout."
""
""
""
"Pours a rich dark chocolate with a dense, creamy off white head. Long lasting retention and thick sheets of lacing. Weak aroma of mild roast malt and coffee with light hops in the finish. Dry, creamy body with roast malt and mild coffee. Not bad, but a little boring and one dimensional."
"Dr: Very drinkable and affordable. I'd have it again. Strange for a stout. All things considered, it was a bit of a disappointment, however."
""
""
"O - The flavors were ok, but he body was not up to RR standards."

"This is one of the many beers that I wonder what it would taste like out of a normal CO2 tap. Or, even better, out of a cask. I'm just not the biggest fan of nitro setups. With that said, this is still a nice dry stout."
"Cheers!"
"Cheers"
"You may think hops when you think Russian River but that's not the case here. This is a pretty traditional Irish stout led by roasted barley and malt subtleties. And it's really creamy with the nitro carbonation. This is a nice, smooth and drinkable beer."
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors had great depth and richness and the mouthfeel was excellent. The addition of the hop flavor really worked well here."
"O: A great tasting and highly drinkable stout. The low alcohol makes this a very easy beer to drink again and again."
"The aroma was loaded with roasted malts, though not as heavy as one would expect given the big look of it. Light hope notes were also noticed in here, with a small plum or raisin like note, almost like some dark Belgian yeast was used. As it warmed some light cocoa started to show as well. The flavor was more of the same. Started out with a nice bit of roasted malts, which then careened off into a slightly hoppy finish. Lots of cocoa and light licorice hints swirling around in the background, giving it some nice depth. Very nice feel, rich, full bodied, with good carbonation that led to never a dull moment, and something that would be best categorized as not very dry at all."
"A solid, if unexceptional, stout. There's good flavour here but there are certainly better beers on the menu."
"GOOD, NOT A MUST HAVE!"
"O-very easy drinking. its definitely better than an average dry stout, but i think it lacks some serious or unique flavor. to me, this is good, but it has a long way to go before it makes a lasting impression like other craft dry stouts have done."
"Beer is super smooth and medium in body. There is a little sweetness up front and some midpalate hoppiness to it. That is followed up by some really nice bitterness from the roast with a moderately dry finish. This is a great beer to have a nitro. A cask version would also be quite good. So silky smooth. RR should triple the alcohol and stick this in a bourbon barrel for 6 months. Kidding. Its fine the way it is."
"Had on nitro tap at Russian River brewing. Nice compact 2 fingers of head. Very black/dark brown. Reminiscent of what Guinness looks like on tap. Smells very toasty, chocolatey. Does not have that sour watery smell that you'd get out a Guinness. Very toasty, coffee and chocolatey, with a bit of bitterness on the finish. VERY light. Everything an Irish stout should be. F#$@in amazing. Goes down like an iced coffee. CAN IT PLEASE!"
"Overall a tasty stout."
"Drinkability: Meh.. I didn't finish it."
"On tap at the brewpub. Nitro, making for a creamy head on black. Coffee roast aroma, flavour. Chocolate. A little watery, and can only drink so much of it. Sessionable stout, a Guiness sub but even a Guiness fan did not like it, good for a change of pace, but not the specialty of the house."
"I only realized this was on nitro as they brought it out to me. At first I was bummed because the only nitro beer I've enjoyed is Murphy's, and I've tried a few. There's over a finger of solid tan head that's clearly not going anywhere. The beer is black opaque with nothing pulling through in terms of light. Aromas are roasted coffee and chocolate. Flavors are similar with an emphasis on the espresso. Great coffee and chocolate flavors melding together. Mouthfeel is light with low carb, which is nitro's biggest downfall in my opinion. This is a delicious beer, with the only bummer being the lighter, undercarbonated body."
"Drinkability- It was really good. Usually everything they have is awesome."
"I order this a few times a year. It is a good version of the style that is usually overlooked with so many other offerings. Worth a try if you want to try something different from RR."
"D: 4.8%? Are you kidding me? This is a freaking fantastic beer to sit with all damn day long! Nicely blended, not very filling and goes down way smooth!"
"D: This is a great session/easy drinking stout. The flavors are nice and the alcohol is low, providing a beer that you can easily have several of throughout the night."
"Draught at the brewpub. Deep, dark brown with a beige head. Light creamy cocoa aroma. The flavor is dry and roasty, with some acidic dark malt, and a bitter, dry, and lightly acidic finish. Light and flat mouthfeel. On the bitter/acidic side of the style, which makes it interesting, but also still not that great."
"D: The mouthfeel is really nice, but there was really nothing special about the taste of this one."
"Had this on nitro-tap at the Russian River pub. The board says that it's currently at 4.15%. Poured black with brown highlights. Very creamy tan head, as should be expected from a nitro pour. The head sticks around quite well and leaves some fine lacing. Smells quite roasty with some light earthy hops. Tastes a little on the thinner side, with some sour graininess, some medium roastiness, and a fairly bitter, earthy finish. Smooth and roasty in the mouth, could be a tad creamier. Enjoyable for bing so low abv."
"D - One of the finest nitro pours I've ever been served. Very good dry Irish stout with an emphasis on the roast, yet it also packs plenty of hop bitterness. The nutty character also adds more depth, making for a tasty brew."
"If I hadn't already sampled all the sours here, I probably would have ordered several more of these, especially for dessert."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Roasty and dry. Chocolate and coffee, just a touch of sweetness from the malt. Light bodied with low carbonation, but very creamy on the tongue. Dry and bitter in the finish with a hint of earthy hops. This is surely a step up from most Irish dry stouts - more aromatic, more flavorful, but still light in body and alcohol. A great alternative to Guinness."
"D: Isn't masking a particularly high abv, but is drinkable for a stout."
"The beer looks great. It's a very dark brown or black with a head that just refuses to dissipate. The nose was mostly malt but a bit weak. There were some lurking coffee and chocolate notes in the aroma. The beer delivered more taste than the smell indicated. It has a light roasted malt flavor than is better balanced and more interesting than most beers of this style. The beer was still somewhat light-bodied for me. I probably would have loved this beer back when I was primarily drinking Guinness, but BA has happily ruined those days for me. It's a drinkable stout with a great flavor and a light body."
"On tap at the RR brewpub. Pours pitch black with a dark beige head. Nose- dark roasted coffee and chocolate. Taste- very dry and roasty with wood and smoky undertones. The nitro is not overbearing in adding creaminess. This dry stout is true to its name and is thinner in body than expected. A real brewing feat. Low in carbonation and slides down nicely."
"Pours almost black, brown and ruby red highlights in the edges, very thick tan head forms, drops a ton of lace, good retention, looks great. Smell is awesome, sweet and grainy, chocolate, coffee, nice roast, oats/cereal, light fruit, very nice. Taste is great too, dry roast, coffee, chocolate, bit of licorice, some fruit, oats, very biscuity bitter dryness in the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, very smooth. Textbook dry stout, this stuff is very good."
"d: a great stout w/ some strong roasty flavors"
"Nearly black in color with a mocha head that lasts throughout the pint. Good lacing too. Aroma is of sweet cocoa powder with a bit of creamed coffee. Flavor is mildly sweet at first but then explodes with roastiness. Charred roast coffee dominates the finish. Mouthfeel is rather flat as nitro beers will tend to exhibit. Quite drinkable."
"In taste, it's first nice and roasty with a good chocolate-coffee quality as well and fairly full flavour. However, the flavour then thins rapidly, becoming a tad weak and watery before picking up a little for the finish, which unfortunately is marred by the light burnt-moldy-skunky quality I noticed in the aroma."
"Drinkability is very good. A very flavorful stout, that checks in at only 4.8% ABV. I could see have a few of these in a seating..."
"On nitro tap at the Russian River pub. Poured, um, black with a nice creamy light tan head. The beer was creamy and contained a lot of sweetness. The roastiness was still there but not in huge amounts, and a lot of chocolate came through. The mouthfeel was very slick but airy. I really liked this stout, sometimes the roastiness is too much for me but that was not the case here."
"Drinkability- I guess this could be sessionable. Not a bunch of flavor that jumps out at you though."
"The flavors are smoke and roasted malts, not my favorites. Also it was kind of watery, another attribute I don't like. This was definitely my least favorite beer from Russian River."
"Wow, I was so unimpressed by this beer. I love Russian River beers. Perhaps because it was on cask at the San Diego Real Ale fest it may have tasted different than what it was meant to on draft or in a bottle. Beer was dark, no head (could be because of cask), mouthfeel was light for a stout. Taste was rather boring also. Nothing spectacular. I will review it again when I have a chance to try a different version."
"Overall: This was the first beer that I ever had at Russian River Brewing Company, and I swear I can recollect every single aspect of it. It is too easy to pass this one over in the wake of all of the other great brews, but this too is a very charismatic Stout. One of the regular beers that comes out of RRBC and rarely seen out of the Brewery Tap. Dont make the mistake of overlooking and missing this one. Sláinte!!"
"On tap at RR brewpub in Santa Rosa. Wonderful creamy appearance. Dark roasted and smooth as hell. Mouthfeel was a bit disappointing right away. Lacks the body you'd expect from a stout. Other than that, great roasted flavours - chocolate and espresso. Like a delicious iced coffee. Easy to drink, a great session stout."
"Solid brown nitro top adds a dark, solid color contrast between the black body and brown top. Aromas of mild vanilla and cappucino. This beer mimics and perfects the fluid cold smoothness that Guinness also does well. Seemed to be 100% chocolate, a blend of milk chocolate and vanilla. Liquid marshmellows. Thankfully not very sweet. Notes of toasty grains. Quiet and addictive brew."
"Drinkability  You could probably drink this all day and not get drunk. It is a very tasty session ale that begs to be shared."
"Tap@Russian River Brewpub. This is a good Guinness clone, only this is much, much better. Soft and dry coffeed texture, lightly Roasted. Decently long finish, could drink a lot of these. Pretty much the perfect session stout, good robust flavour, but not too heavy."
"Flavor is initially coffe with corny notes and a strong roast that dries out the niddle malt as a large hop bitterness finally throws through to a good dry finish."
"Being nitrogenated, this is one smooth stout and very easy on the palate. The light carbonation is just enough to make it dance on the tongue without being anywhere near 'fizzy' All in all a well crafted brew and something I'm sure I'll be coming back for again and again."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and simple. A medium body that holds its own. No watery finish. This stout goes down easy. Carbonation is mild and one could drink a few of these, especially off of the cask."
"This stout poured an opaque black color with light brown foam that clinged and coated the glass a bit. Impressive for a beer on cask. The smell was slightly sweet and malty (very roasted) with notes of cocoa. The taste was roasted malt with elements of cocoa and oats(?). Very delicious. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium-full body and low carbonation. Overall it was dry with only hints of light sweetness. It was relatively clean. This was a very nice stout, and was one of the best beers offered at the Real Ale Fest."
"The beer pulls from the cask an onyx color the head thick and tall, the color chocolate brown, the texture creamy with the lace a glutinous sheet to cling mightily to the glass. Nose was sweet chocolate; coffee with a rich toasted grain aroma to end it all, start was ambrosia, rich in malt and the top full and creamy. Finish was gentle in it acidity, the hops perfection, somewhat bittersweet and dry aftertaste, I voted this the hit of the fest at least for me, and just missed by a frog hair of getting some at OBriens, damn well better luck next time."
"This light colored stout, it leans more towards brown than black, left some of the best lacing I have encountered. A solid coating really added to the ambience. This beer had a strong roasty aroma, taste profile seemed to have some strong licorice notes to it, almost imparted a medicinal taste. A well made stout that just didn't quite make it with me taste wise. Could grow on you though. Ful bodied and enjoyable if you can adapt to the different taste."
