"a very good stout, although less distinct in its taste than some of the other beers i have had from these guys. its not quite black, but shocking in its density of color, medium luster, nitro looking head, pale in color, and carbonated pretty darn well. only loosely an irish stout i think, maybe the yeast is there for that, and definitely the dryness, but its so much more than that. i get oats in nose and taste, its too rich and thick to not have oats in it, plus its sweet, and creamy, it yells oats. it also has some bitterness to it, just enough though. one thing about it, is that its got a lot of body, a lot more than its low abv would suggest most of the time, its heavy even though it isnt sweet, uncommon and nice for winter, but hard to drink more than an english pint of this, its filling and tiring in some way, more than i need in the style for just one. i prefer the hoppy stuff i have had from societe, but i like this one a lot, i think it stands out an awful lot."

"Pours a dark brown, from draft. Expected more from this beer. Roasted aroma with hints of cocoa. Taste and mouthfeel are empty to me. Sharp bite and then it's gone. Not for me, but I'm sure someone who wants to get into stouts and doesn't want the full heavy body at first would love this"

"On tap at Hops and Pie as part of CBC, very cool to see Societe on tap. Dark black, good head. Smells like mild roasted malts, a bit of cocoa powder. Flavor is cocoa powder, dry, roasted malts, pretty much what you would expect given the style. No complaints here but since its not my favorite style I'm not sure I'd order this again."

"This beer pours a dark brown color with thin off white head. The aroma was subdued as is typical of the style, but absolutely delicious. The first sip was very mild, the beer was served too cold but it was right next to the Coors light tap so what are you going to do. About halfway down the beer reached a nice temp and opened up nicely. Light bodied, it had a nice roasty flavor with chocolatey notes and just a hint of coffee. It was dry, but not as dry as other Irish stouts I have tried. For the style I felt it was very flavorful, and a very well done example of the style. Well worth a taste if you enjoy the dry Irish stout."

"I had this beer at Societe on a recent trip to San Diego. The ABV was listed as 5.2% on the board. The beer was very dark brown to black in color with a thin white-ish head. Aroma was loaded with roasted malt and chocolate. Black patent malt and roasted flavors from beginning to end with a nice dry finish. I also drank Guinness at the brewery when I was in Dublin and would say The Pugulist is a better example of an irish dry stout."

"Good example of a fairly boring style."
"Pretty good. I don't think that this style could be heavenly, but it's aite like organic Cheddar Bunnies. (Read the labels, my children.)"
