Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, toffee, roasted malt, biscuit, raisin, licorice, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of roasted malt and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toffee, biscuit, coffee, raisin, licorice, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toffee, biscuit, coffee, licorice, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Very nice balance and robustness of roasted malt and yeast ester flavors; with a dry and roasty finish with no cloying flavors. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a moderately creamy and very smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is a very good dry stout.

3.85,1,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"I like Fullers a lot but admittedly did not realize they offer an Irish dry stout until stumbling across this brew on tap at Beer Revolution here in Calgary (these guys should pay me for all the name-dropping I do on here ... I will accept payment in beer. No?). 16 oz. pint presented as dark opaque black with flickers of brown, not even a colored halo, just inky blackness except for the moderate amount of tan head. Major black licorice on the nose, along with wood smoke and hints of fresh dough. Major licorice on the palate as well. While some stouts offer ample coffee and chocolate, this one combines an earthy bittersweet element with malt to yield a flavor remarkably like licorice all-sorts candy doused with smoke. Fruit is difficult to detect, as the sweetness is more herbal or medicinal in character. A little chocolate emerges here and there. Crisp and chalky with burnt wood and grainy husk in the finish. Very dry but never quite loses the licorice sweetness. Nice take on the style and perhaps my experience benefited from the beer being super-fresh on tap. Unidimensional but I don't expect Irish stouts to be as complex as some heavier North American examples.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 18, 2013"

One may, as I did, detect subtle hints of molasses and black licorice, in varying presence on the nose and tongue. Beginning of a thick blend of the roasted and pale malts in flavor. Quite full-flavored - licorice and bitters up front, acrid-yet-silky roasted barley carrying midway through the finish. All the while, a strong cookie-ish malt foundation. Clean and dry enough. Could drink a few of these in succession. Though not unique, it's of course superbly executed.","Bouleboubier","Jun 08, 2013"

Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick and creamy and very easy to drink. I think this is a good stout, I'd pick this up again at $5.29 a bottle.

For the price point, quantity and availability I would just rather get a 6-pack of their Porter because it is a better beer regardless of style. Great for the drinkability and sessionability but lacks a tad in the overall flavor profile.","claspada","Feb 01, 2013"

Aroma - very reminiscent of chocolate (70% cocoa of course - not milk). Flavour is chocolate and espresso coffee - with full, mellow mouthfeel. Good balance of sweetness and bitterness. Same again, please!”","triskadekaphobia","Jan 18, 2013"
4.12,8.1,4.25,4,4.25,4,4,"It's hard to put any stout or porter against Fuller's London Porter and expect to win, and I don't think this one does that, but a brew's job isn't to be ""better"" than something else. Each style has their own positive attributes, and this one has those in spades. This is a drier brew, and a damned sessionable one at that, and I likes it fine.","JohnnyBarman","Jan 11, 2013"

3.39,-11,3,4,3,3.5,3.5,"O- Not bad but I was let down by the taste. It just could have been a bit maltier and if it had the chocolate undertones the aroma delivered I would have been very happy with it. I guess I can't be too critical though as it is a Dry Stout. maybe just not my style of stout.","thepeter","Jan 19, 2012"
3.7,-2.9,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Dark black in colour with a thin cap of beige head. Black Cab is dominated with coffee and cocoa flavours with some roasted barley character and a nice hit of bitterness, but in a restarined way. Despite the strong flavour descriptors, this stout is mild and restrained. Its is boldly flavoured, but not intense. Medium bodied and very easy drinking. Nothing exciting, but a solid stout.","","Jan 06, 2012"
3.17,-16.8,3,3.5,3,3.5,3,"O: A somewhat enjoyable english stout served on cask; however, I personally think it smells better than it tastes as there is just nothing going on for me other than coffee.
