"Every bit as good as Guinness if not a bit better. Silky smooth and easy drinking."
""
"Overall, a beautiful beer. Due to Canada's ridiculously bizarre liquor laws, it is absolutely unavailable outside of a good Irish pub that will likely charge one exorbitant prices for a pint of said beer. Truly tragic. If you can get it on tap somewhere, take it over Guinness and allow yourself some time to make acquaintance with it. You won't regret it."
""
"The smell is decent, but the taste too watery for me. Overall, this is an ok beer."
""
""
""
""
"Good all around stout , great all around beer"
""
""
"Smooth tasting stout with rich body and flavors"
""
""
""
"Not as heavy as Guinness but still just as good"
"Solid stout. Not as sweet as Guinness."
"Draught pour in a branded glass in a local Irish pub. Appearance is outstanding with a completely black body and creamy head. The aroma is a rich milk-chocolate. The taste is a blend of caramel and malt, smooth and perfectly balanced. The feel is less heavy and less bitter than Guinness Draught. Overall a very drinkable stout and I'll do a ""Clancy"" with Guinness Draught if I want a little heavier stout."
""
"You can't beat the beautiful head on this beer, or the creaminess in general.  Just wished it had more overall flavor but I suppose that's the style.  Can always dump in some cider... :)"
"I hate to rate this beer (or any beer for that matter) as an apples to apples comparison to another, but given the similarities, with the widget and all, had to compare it to Guinness cans. Murphy's ""widget"" must not be on par with the Guinness widget as this didn't' give me nearly the massive upside down hourglass looking head to beer transformation. This also led to a less than full body when compared. Nose was muted as well. The taste though - more complexity than Guinness. Dark fruit and a little more nuttiness than it's contemporary."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Excellent stout!"
""
""
""
"O - it's been a long time since I had a Murphy's. It's a good Irish dry stout, but I probably won't get it again."
""
""
""
"I'm a bit partial to Guinness but this is a good dry Irish stout nonetheless.."
""
""
""

"I really wanted to like this stout.  This is by far my favorite style of beer. But this stout just didn't tingle my toes. The beer does pour a gorgeous black color with an appealing tan head that has some pretty good staying power.  That's about it. The rest was relatively meh. Watery feel, strong aftertaste, nothing that really impressed me outside of the low carbonation I do prefer."
""
"Dark opaque brown beer with a tawny foam. Smells of mild grain and chocolate. Taste is lightly chocolate, grain. Nice and smooth lightly sweet but with faint bitterness keeps it nice and dry. Lighter medium mouthfeel is creamy. Easy to drink."
"O -  Goes down entirely too fast, sessionable, and a classic."
"My favorite Irish Stout to date.  Love the silk smoothness, almost like the texture of drinking chocolate milk. The light burnt nut taste is what really puts this one over the top for me.  I stopped buying Guinness after tasting this one."
""
"A slightly dry Irish stout at its best"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Damn good stout. The nitro can is unique."
"Like the body, the flavor profile is light in intensity, slightly complex and well balanced.  It delivers a blend of chocolate and roast that flows to a mild bitterness.  As the bitterness fades, caramel is detected underneath along with a nice dominate mineral note.  The finish is a lingering mineral bitter note."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great stout comparable to Guiness but better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A great example of the style. If you like the nitro effect of a stout on draft, you ought to try this. Murphy's makes a great dessert beer that can be slowly enjoyed anywhere anytime. Additionally, its smooth mouthfeel and lower level of carbonation means that 2 or 3 of these could go down easier than you'd think."
""
""
""
"Similar but different to Guinness. Would have to try again with both side by side."
""
""
"Smells good, coffee-like flavor. In my opinion, perhaps even better than Guinness. Looks the way it tastes: rich. Smell isn't really special."
""
""
""
""
""
"Smooth creamy Irish stout that rivals Guinness (in the can)."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good stout. I recommend."
""
""
""
""
"Good beer. I'll make a habit of picking a couple cans up from Trader Joe's regularly. Certainly worth it at the price."
"Overall - Very good in all camps with no scores below four and no element that flags. In terms of the style this one is better than the more famous and better known Guinness."
""
"Pours beautiful, decent tan head and tremendous!!! lacing. Aroma is mild and smells like creamy hot chocolate. Ok, this is where it turns south from here. This beer tries, but does not give it's best effort. I get hints of malt, hot chocolate and creaminess, BUT, it is like someone added water to my beer when I wasn't looking. This beer lacks the complexity that I expected. Very weak. Maybe a bad batch??, maybe not!!?"

"If you think the U.S. Murphy's is good try a draft when you are in Ireland. It's smoother than a baby's butt. No aftertaste. Could drink this all day."
"The Murphy's Irish Stout is a very dark,  almost black stout beer with a very thick tan head and strong lacing left on the glass. Very deep roasted malt smell with tiny hints of coffee and chocolate. Very similar to Guinness but without the over powering coffee taste. An instant favorite."

"I thoroughly enjoyed this one & it definitely grew on me as I worked my way down the glass. Lighter, smoother & less bitter than Guinness, it's is a good alternative to that one with a solid taste to back it up. Can't wait to see how it tastes by the can since it's hard to find on draught in the UK these days."

"Poured from a Nitro-can into a pint glass. A nougat coloured head over a deep, dark cola body. There is lots of action beneath the surface after the intial pour. Smells of roast, burnt toast and grain. The taste is mild, with coffee and chocolate undertones mixing with the burnt toast of the nose. The mouthfeel is creamy, but seems too thin and watery for a stout. Overall, it's not too bad, but there are better options out there."

"When you first sip this beer you would think someone poured a cup of water into your glass. The beer is watery, and flat; like drinking flat soda. I don’t normally waste beer, but I’m thinking long and hard about pouring this down the sink."

"Overall: Not a bad experience and the best I could get where I was. If I am forced to go listen to drunk secretaries sing karaoke and all the horror that entails this will at least help me feel better about it."
""
"If it were possible to be worse than Guinness Guinness Draught this would be it. Thin, watery, bitter, flat... tastes like something gone bad. Doesn't look bad, smell too bad or have a bad mouth feel, but it tastes so bad it's hard to finish a can."

"DATE TASTED: March 17, 2014... GLASSWARE: the ""new"" Guinness glass, straight from the brewery itself... OCCASION: St. Patrick's Day pub crawl #3 at Penn State... APPEARANCE: pours a creamy, thick, impressively stable brownish black head; jet black body that shows a harrowing red eye in the light--picture perfect... AROMA: peat, biscuit, doughy strength with some chocolate hints...soft ground coffee too...PALATE: smooth yet substantial; creamy and viscous--a pleasure to ease into an all-day affair with...TASTE: surprisingly hoppy to start with a strong, malty throat-satiating finish; roasted and smoothly, subtly chocolaty... OVERALL: can't beat St. Patrick's Day in Penn State; this is a morning maker if ever there was one, like a loaf of bread that also brings the oven, the coal, and the warmth with it--a rival to the Guinness crown...no doubt a blind taste-test may be in order...."

"Poured a rich, nearly black color with a one finger, foamy head the stuck around and left nice lacing down the glass. Quite nice looking. Scents of roasted malt, coffee, cream, chocolate and an earthy, herbal undertone. Quite nice, a typical dry stout aroma with a nice addition of herbal character. Flavor begins with a nice hit of black coffee and roasted malt, moving into some dirty mineral flavors, cocoa powder and black coffee and roasted malt, alongside some herbal flavors in the background. Finish is dry, with roasted malt and earthy herbal flavors. Aftertaste is roasted grain and bitter black coffee. A very, very slight acidic sourness is present throughout. A very nice dry stout flavor, true to form, nothing off. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with low carbonation, and a smooth, creamy initial feel giving way to a chalky, drying finish. Quite nice. Very easy to drink. Overall this is a fairly good Irish Dry Stout. It hits the style notes straight on, and is quite nice to drink."
"Flavors offer roasty malts with burnt chocolate and dirty earthy notes. Watery Keurig coffee backdrop, which lingers in a lackluster finish. Creamy body from the nitro widget, but the body doesn't hold fully solid beyond that. The carbonation pushes it to near-exquisite."

"Poured a deep, dark brown, with a ruby-tint towards the bottom of the glass. A creamy khaki head lasts throughout the beer and leave some nice lacing. The aroma is very sweet, think very dark caramel, with just a hint of burnt grain. The taste is very malty with a nice earthy hops finish. It's thinner along the style of dry stout and is just a great stout."

"14.9 oz can into imperial pint glass, canned on 2/14/2013. Pours crystal clear very dark brown color with a 1-2 finger dense and creamy light tan head with awesome retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Dense creamy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, brown bread, light herbal, and roasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of roast/bready malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, brown bread, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Light earthy herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, roast, coffee, toast, brown bread, herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice and pleasant balance of roast/bready malt flavors; with solid robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, lush, and creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4%. Overall this is a nice dry stout. Good balance and robustness of roast/bready malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Always love kicking this beer back. You can session this all day but the creaminess makes you drink it slower. An excellent stout for any occasion."

"Enjoyed a pint on tap at Beer Revolution in Calgary, on good old St. Paddy's day of course. Pretty cool that they brought this classic in for the occasion. A dark brownish black brew, with a reddish twinkle here and there although largely opaque, with a creamy light tan head. Smells like dry chalky chocolate and light roast coffee, with hints of medicinal licorice and fruity esters than recall red berries. Lewis, in his book on stouts (part of the Classic Beer Styles series), describes this brew as extremely dry and roasty and I do not disagree. It is bone dry but also extremely smooth and creamy, quite carbonated but nevertheless easy on the mouth. Light bodied and crisp. I get chocolate and coffee flavors but also a robust fruitiness, perhaps unique to the tap format, with some cherry gum, strawberry, grape, and faint mint adding a rather refreshing element that moderately offsets the dryness. Does not come off like a mass-produced brew but should certainly work as a session option for the dark malt aficionado. Gotta say, it beats Guinness by a long shot from my perspective over here in sunny Alberta."
""

"Prost!"

"Poured from a can with a ""widget"" feature to give a nitro creaminess. Murky brown/black in color with a soft frothy head. Aroma is light; toasted bread, baking cocoa, cereal grains. Flavor is dry, very subdued and slight and follows nose. Not acidic and astringent like a RIS. Very one-dimensional with no undertones. No hop flavors. Silky mouthfeel that is very sensual, the best part of this brew. A saint patty's day beer that is at least better than green tinted Budweiser."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A rather decent Irish stout. It starts out sweeter, but dries out nicely with a decent level of bitterness from coffee and earthy hop flavors. With the nitro style pour, it makes for a good feel for the mix of roast and bitter as well as for the lower abv. of the beer and make for a rather decent session style drinker."
""
""
""
"Overall- A good stout and a good substitute when Guinness isn't available."
""
"I must admit, I'm a little confused by the ratings here for this beer. I've done many back to back comparisons with Guinness and this beer is milder version of guineas. Less flavor but more creamy. Guinness is in no way perfect but this beer is, in my opinion, lacks the flavor that Guinness has. Still a good beer. Try it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Must try."
"It hits the right notes for a milder stout. Quite enjoyable."
""
""

"Some charred barley, but like most from this style it is on the easy drinking, creamy, laid back. Watered taste, milky mouthfeel, and the drinkability is average just because I can't see myself looking forward to this or pursuing it any time soon. Once again another brew I'd prefer to try on tap, without the nitro blasting ball, but for this review in a can its simply uneventfull."
"Overall, this will my goto stout from now on whenever there isn't many ""specialty"" stouts to choose from."
""
"Murphy's Stout is more delicious than I remember it being. I'll have to pick up another can and do a comparative tasting of it and Guinness. I suspect that Murphy's would win hands-down. If memory serves, it's sweeter on the palate, drier in the hang, and its roasted malt flavors are better balanced by hopping."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty typical of an Irish dry stout. Perhaps a bit more complex. Recommended for fans of the style."
""
""
""
""
"Smells rich, and the taste is perfect. Just the right amount of bittery undertones and a clean, clean, clean drink. Tasting something like a bitter chocolate or a toasted nut of something. Just perfect. Smooth and thick without being bloaty-inducing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Murphy's Irish Stout pours a black color, with a large creamy head. There is a creamy dry aroma with coffee and chocolate notes. The taste is very creamy, nice smokey and very dry malty flavors. Nice taste, but watery body. Overall its a nice Irish dry stout, a step above Guinness."
"Thin and rather flavorless. It's nice to have a low-ABV stout, but there are much better ones out there, including much better nitro Irish dry stouts. So I'll pass on this one for the foreseeable future."
""
""
"Pours a solid dark brown with faint garnet highlights at the edges and a huge creamy tan head that persists forever and ever. Aromas of earthy roasty coffee and light cream with a hint of vanilla and chocolate. The flavor is a slightly mineralized caramel and coffee with bits of earth and roast. Medium to light body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a creamy watery mouthfeel and a lingering roasted bitterness on the palette. Easy drinking somewhat flavorful creamy ale. I could pound a few of these back if I were in it for the long haul."
"Overall - Not as thick as Guinness, but a bit sweeter and smoother."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall-- there are much better in this style If you're looking for a hearty beer don't be fooled by ""Stout"" on (in this case) the can.."
""
""
""
""
"Decent beer, but nothing compared to many other stouts I’ve had before."
""
""
""
"Last thoughts: looks perfect and wont disappoint the beer drinker, however the stout lover may want to try a friends before purchase."
""
""
""
"Served from a nitro can into a pint glass. A very good, underrated dry Irish stout. Frankly, I'll drink this over Guinness any day of the week (sorry, fellow Irish New Englanders). The mouthfeel is creamy, quite smooth. Appearance is dark, a healthy white head with only minor lacing. Initial taste is sweet, with some coffee notes and a slight bitterness at the end. This is one of those old-school stouts that I could drink by a gallon."
"O: Distinct flavor with a high level of drinkability, which pairs nicely with the low ABV. Definitely something you can slug and readily available at a reasonable price. I am fan."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""

"I haven't had this in quite a while, maybe since the advent of widgets. A delicious creamy mustache stout that is actually very middle of the road. Poured into a goblet at approx 50 degrees, black in appearance with a tan dense head that wasn't going anywhere. Watery mouth feel and wonderful after essence of coffee and dark roasted grain but no lingering or cloying attributes. Its flavors intensify somewhat as it warms up. It has very low nitro fizz and its highly drinkable with low ABV. Very enjoyable."
"Overall - Curiosity found me a new favorite stout to hap on tap up here, given the rather limited selection of most fine establishments. Definitely will repeat this purchase."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I like it."
"O: Well-balanced, sessionable, never sates. An easy choice."
""

"O - Better than I was expecting, and my favorite Irish stout to date. It's simple but tasty, with a nice nitro mouthfeel (could have been thicker)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There’s a light, roasty chocolate aroma to it with a flavor that has a slight roast with a touch of milk chocolate. Smooth, and rounded, albeit thinly bodied, with a sweetish finish. Not bad for a buck a can, and certainly a great alternative to the ubiquitous Guinness."
""
""
"A pretty good beer, seems like a step or 2 above Guinness."

""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""

"O- This Irish dry stout avoids the thin feel and limpy body found in other versions of the style. That helps set it apart."
"Really enjoy the chocolate taste and aroma of this stout. Goes down smooth, great dessert beer. Not a very complex flavor, but I'm very surprised I liked this beer out of a can (I typically don't like canned beers; sue me). Doesn't taste as dry as many stouts do to me, and the roasted malt flavor really works. Coffee aroma and tastes were present as well."

"Overall this is better than Guinness Draught. And an excellent example of a dry irish stout."

"Aftertaste: What aftertaste? I drink, there is a hint of flavor, and then it's gone again. There is literally no aftertaste here. I also like how they spell draft. On the can it says, ""DRAUGHT STYLE"". That is not how you spell draft! Oh well. I will give this beer credit for the style… but just not for me."

"O: A decent example of Irish Stout, and a nice alternative to Guinesss. I used another can for my Irish stew which turned out fantastic. this past weekend, and that might be a better use for this brew."
""
""
""
"O -- A great example of the style. ""Better"" than Guinness Draught? Not particularly, but just the mildest difference in having more chocolate character than the roasted, coffee-like character in the Guinness."
""
""
"O - For me its an occasion beer. I prefer it to Guiness (from here in the States anyway), but other than drinking ""Irish"" I'll get my stouts elsewhere. Too many good craft stouts out there to be stuck with this..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I figured I'd try a new Irish beer for St. Patty's day, but upon further inspection I found that this beer is brewed in the UK. It loses some style points there. Overall, it looks amazing in the glass, but it lacks any real aroma or a heavy mouthfeel that I expect from stouts."
""
"O – Good beer, the style itself leads to beers that are for the most part underwhelming. This beer however is one of the best looking beers I have ever seen. It tastes standard for the style, though perhaps a bit better, it doesn't have the earthy/dirt notes of some of its competitors. This is easy drinking, and leaves you wanting more."
"O- since my beer journey has started in earnest.. It feels good to review a commonly familiar style. The mouthfeel offered more and more with each sip."
"O: I tried Murphy's on a whim one day instead of buying Guinness, and enjoyed it at the time. Grabbed a 4-pack of cans for St. Patrick's Day this year and still found this a pleasing, easy-drinking Irish stout. If you're looking for a thick, complex, meal-in-a-can type of stout, this isn't it. This one is made for drinking a few in a sitting, or maybe having one with a meal or a snack. Pretty comparable to a Guinness, though maybe a little more flavorful."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not a huge stout drinker...tending to pay attention to it mostly around St. Patrick's day, however, as a rule, I prefer Imperial Stouts (high gravity/alcohol) to dry Irish ones. Of course Imperial stouts are sweeter, and usually more complex, than the authentic dry Irish style. Still, simplicity is a beautiful thing, as I've learned with German beers...and Murphy's is simple, and great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really love a good Irish Stout, and I think this is a particularly good one. It's certainly much, much better than the locally contract-brewed Guinness you'd get here in Australia. At 4% ABV, this is exquisitely sessionable. Indeed, the whole can went down without a question, and I'm already craving another."

"Two Words: Flimsy Staple"

""
""
"Overall: Not bad, not stellar. It's a good stout for people who don't like huge, full-bodied stouts. It's definitely designed ot appeal to the mass market."
""
"Poured this Irish Dry Stout from a 16 oz can into a pint glass. Poured a dark brown color, produced a thick tan head, excellent retention and it left a great amount of lacing on the glass. Aroma consisted of roasted malt, coffee and dark chocolate. Medium bodied, very creamy and smooth mouthfeel. The flavor is a bit watered down, but it does have some base of roasted malt, coffee and dark chocolate. Not a huge fan of Irish Stout's but this is one of my favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it is what it is. Basically a Guiness Draft in a different suit. I would be hard pressed to tell the difference if I were tested."

"Final Thoughts: The use of a nitro-canning definitely improves this beer and makes it one that anyone can enjoy. Would I drink it again? Most likely but I don't often seek it out."

"Quite glad I got this instead of Guinness...it's miles better and for a better price."

"Tried Murphys Irish Stout for this first time since I have been a member of BA. The beer looked great, nice and dark with foamy slightly off white head that left spotty lacing. The smell was simple, hints of roast and espresso. Thetaste seemed a bit off to me. The beer started with roast/espresso, then I got a finish that seemed to have bourbon or some type of scotch/whiskey in it. Wasn't very appealing. The mouthfeel was lighter in body for a stout with subtle carbonationl. Overall it was just ok."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I really like Murphy's stout. It's dry, easy to drink, not too heavy for a stout, and very tasty. I will continue to return to this staple in the future..."
""
""
""
""
""
"o - true to style, this one goes down easy and doesn't suck. could drink a few in a session no problem, 3 of these would be roughly equal to one of the many imperial stouts out there. worthy of an occasional purchase."
"Overall, buy it! It is underrated(unfortunately) but it's worth every sip. Great for breakfast, lunch, and dinner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm glad I tried it, but doubt I will seek it again. It is about on par with it's obvious competitor, maybe a little better. The appearance is very nice, but I wish it had been a little less watery."
"Overall: Excellent sipping beer. Dry and solid. At only 4.0% not too much guilt. Be sure to give the can a good roll before to loosen up the nitrogen. I can imagine that it looses something in the can, though. Would definitely order on a cold night off a tap."
""
""
"Overall: True drinkability. All things about this are subtle and reserved. I give this high marks because you continuously want another sip. That said, it lacks in flavor and complexity. An enjoyable smoothness, however."
""
""
""
"O: A decent beer. It is definitively a lot smoother than other beers of the same style which for some may be good."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 1 pint can into a pint glass, nitro can. This pours a pitch black color with a foamy nitro head which leaves a finger thick head which remains throughout the beer. The smells are good, you get chocolate, coco, some light dark roasted malts. The feel is medium although creamy. The taste is pretty good, somewhat , light but creamy and tasty, you get the roasted malts, light bitterness, likely oatmeal, smooth nice session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Would I buy it again? Yes and have numerous times... even buy it in the can now."
""
"The nose is of rich dark chocolate, chicory and oatmeal with an admirable mouthfeel. Not too unctuous as to be drinking 5w-20, but just enough weight that it doesn't feel limp. Also enjoyable is the fact that it isn't too sweet, perhaps less so than Guinness, and noticeably has far less alcohol than many domestic stouts making this a great long termer. Well balanced and somewhat straightforward, Murphy's quenches and satisfies without attempting to be pretentious."

"This pours a typical jet-black for the style, with the nice off-white creamy head on top. aroma is mellow, slightly roasty and slightly sour and husky. Flavor is very on par: mellow roasted malts with a hint of sweetness behind it all, and a touch tangy. finishes with a creamy mild coffee note. This is very drinkable and for the style very good. I keep coming back to this as a subtle, but tasty stout to have on hand when I want a simple, comforting beer."

"Looks nice and smells good but tastes and feels weak and watery. Won't buy again."
""
""
""
"Overall it's like a better Guinness. The bitterness is complimentary rather than overpowering and the light flavor notes are pleasing. After drinking so many fancy bears this was a great break. A very pleasant light beer. I will be seeking out more cans."
"Overall, this is a decent Irish stout which is readily available at many places. At only 4% ABV, it makes for a great session beer that can be knocked back with ease. Plus, it tastes pretty good."
""
""
""
"O: I prefer Guinness more. This wasn't as watery, but the bitterness got in the way of the flavor for me."
""
"overall- A great stout and also great as 1/2 of a black & tan. Perfect for a cold winter night or whenever you want to sip a fine stout and relax"
""

"Overall: It's good..but not great. I enjoyed it. Definitely something good to pick up on and enjoy."
""

"Overall: Great beer, if it wasn't for the watery finish, would be excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this beer is a little too watery in texture for my personal preference, otherwise it's an excellent stout; I think ""light stout"" describes this beer well and it would probably be a good introductory beer for someone who is just branching over into the world of stouts"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If there was a stout to just drink easily without much thought, this would be it."
""
""
"Irish stouts are beautiful beers. Near black with a thick, creamy tan head. Long lasting retention and ample lacing. The aroma offers some bread and chocolates. The aroma is gentle but enticing. Smooth and creamy, with a milk chocolate character. A hint of roast and no bitterness. A really solid example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Perhaps it is the pasteurization, but I find the beer a bit flat/dead tasting even while it hits more or less all the sufficient style notes. Perhaps a bit ""smoother"" than regular canned Guinness - but equally mediocre."
""
"O: this is a good beer that I would definitely welcome again in my fridge."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall a very pleasant beer. It doesn't get the fame like Guinness does, but this is definitely a superior brew. Would drink again."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Depends on how a beer should be judged. Versus type, this stout wouldn't rate well, but I rather enjoyed it."
""
"Overall: an unpleasant burnt coffee stout. The worst part of it by far is the mouthfeel - watery like a dark lager, rather than creamy like a stout."
"O/D-Could it be a bit better than Guinness Draught? It is a bit rougher around the edges; and I like that. Solid taste and a perfect look. I really don't care how the beer looks but this is just too perfectly defined in appearance to not warrant a 5. Nice little pint."

"O - For what it is, I'd say it has more flavor than Guinness, even if it isn't nearly as popular. Certainly worth a turn of the head, if this is your thing. It's drinkable, dangerously so since it has no carb to speak of and is notably watery."
""
""
""
"D: This was about on par with Guinness. Nice nitro body, but scent and taste are like a macro stout. Not very pleasant, although not entirely repulsive either."
"O - Kim Kardashian. Dark and drop dead gorgeous, but very little substance."
""
""
""
""

"Overall for 4% you really can't complain. Nothing impressive but nothing offensive either, real simple."

""
""
"The ""dryrish"" stouts are not my cup of tea, full disclosure...that said I did buy a case in march after getting a little too psyched for st paddy's day...The greatest thing about this beer for me is the pour. The science of the widget can to pint glass pour almost brings a tear to my eye. After that it's all downhill. Very little aroma, and what j could detect was a hint of malt. One mouthful tastes of sheer boredom to me. I do prefer it far beyond Guinness, but again, it's just not my type of beer. One on march 17th for me and that's it."
"O: It's a quality old stand-by, and I think superior to its main competitor. It seems to me that it improves significantly as it warms several degrees from refrigerator temperature."
""
"The real allure of this beer is the perfect appearance and superbly creamy mouthfeel that few beers posses. However, despite all the somewhat rare nitro tricks and solid nose, this beer has very little substance and almost tastes like a Guinness Extra Stout combined with 50% water. This tasted significantly better from the tap in New Zealand with a more substantial body and stronger flavors. I might purchase a few more cans then and again, but only to have the novelty of the English draught experience in my own home."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If you like sweet stouts - this isn't it, but then again it's not supposed to be. It's a decent example of what it is - a dry Irish stout."
""
"Poured into a glass mug. Pours creamy dark brown as the tan head builds in the glass. Sticky lacing coats the side of the glass as this beer is consumed. The aromas of dark roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee hit the nose. The smells are mild, but detectable. The flavor is exactly like it smells. There are dark roasted malts, smooth bitter chocolate, and minor bitter coffee notes. The flavors are creamy and mellow. There is a touch of astringency as well. This is a medium bodied beer with a creamy mouthfeel. This beer pleasantly sticks to the mouth. It's refreshing and very easy to gulp. Overall, this is an excellent beer and classic example of the Irish dry stout. Murphy's is cheaper than Guinness, so those looking to experiment with this style could turn to Murphy's first."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The real test, which is surprisingly difficult to do in Ireland, is to compare the tap versions of the three Irish industrial stouts-- Beamish, Murphy's, and Guinness."
""
""
"M - Medium body, somewhat smooth. At times this really feels like a nitro-tap and at other times it is a touch thin."
""
"O: Really enjoyed this, somewhat light on the taste but has just enough to make it interesting, can preserves that creamy from-the-tap mouthfeel and makes this an extremely drinkable stout"
""
""
""
""
"Pours nearly black with mahogany highlights and close to an inch of luscious tan head courtesy of the nitro. The feel is smooth and easy to drink, to say the least. Taste is of dark roasted malt, typical of the style. The flavor is mellow and mildy smokey, which is nice enough, but the highlight for me is the back end, which reveals a hint of chocolate and little of the astrigency that can mar a Guinness's aftertaste. I like Guiness as well, but I must admit I was presently surprised by Murphy's offering, so much so that I'd probably give it the nod over it's more widely available peer."
""
""
""
"Definitely a terrific stout, one I will return to repeatedly."
""
""
"Ov: It is extremely similar to Guinness without seeming as tart...or as expensive. It is refreshing, engaging and fulfilling. This is a beer that does not disappoint. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is hands-down my favourite draught stout. I've been to Ireland and there, Beamish, Murphy's and Guinness are all really good from the tap, but in the pub cans Murphy's is probably the best in the US. The low ABV and creamy, delicious taste make this one of my all-time favourites. Probably one of the best session beers around, and the price is usually much cheaper than Guinness."
""
""
""
"Overall –Despite the beautiful appearance the low carbonation resulting in a flat feel was the notable characteristic. This beer was drunk straight from the refrigerator so may try it again at a warmer temperature."
""
""
"I decided to try an Irish beer in honor of St Patricks day and chose Murphy's Irish stout. Being in the middle of a Belguim beer phase I was pleasently surprised on the taste of this stout. This is a vey mild beer and as a result goes down vey smooth. I normally enjoy a beer with a higher alcohol content but as smooth as the beer is it is very easy to drink a lot on a short period of time."
""
""
""
""
"Drink- Well it is St. Patricks day. Gunniess was the easy choice. This was pretty good with a creamy malty note. Id have it again"
"16 oz nitro can poured into a 14 oz ""pint glass"". Pours a dark black with a frothy cream color head. Smells like darkly roasted malt very sweetly. Very pleasant for a stout. Tastes of coffee predominately with hints of caramel, but initially has some watery taste. Very drinkable and smooth, going down really easy with a lighter body for a stout. Overall, a good Irish stout, definitely an improvement over most St. Patrick's Day brews from Ireland available in the USA."
"Overall - Go ahead and drink Guinness on St Paddy's day... you're short changing yourself. Drink this instead.... WAY BETTER"
"I might overrate it a bit because I drank a lot of these on my honeymoon, but I do like it. I get excited whenever I see it on tap at a bar - nice change of pace."
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Quite drinkable, but wonder if might be better fresh out of a tap rather than a nitro-can. Went very well with a traditional Irish dish (Colcannon) and I could probably have another if offered, but since I only bought one I'm okay with that. Good, but nothing special."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is in no way a bad beer but the flavor is rather light and in my opinion fleeting. The mouthfeel is almost perfect for the style though I find I like the creaminess of the head more than the lighter body of the beer itself."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On special for the upcoming St. Patrick's day holiday. Murphy's Stout is one of the few true session beers available around me. Classic nitro look - black body, thick and creamy mat of foam. Faint roast like weakly brewed coffee and a toasted nuttiness. Firm bitterness at the back end along with some earthy hop flavor keeps it interesting. Some fruit pulls through as it warms up. Dry, drinkable, and a tad better than Guinness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Highly recommended!"
"Poured from a nitro-can into a pint glass and watched the show begin. I love the 'fall-out' of the malty tan/brown head as the inky black liquid begins to emerge below. This process lasted a couple of minutes until finally a 3/4 inch head remained on top of the black stout. A quarter inch head remained until the beer was finished. Smells of creamy malt with a hint of coffee. The mouthfeel is initially creamy but gives way to a less heavy feeling stout- almost too watery. The taste is also creamy with a bitter aftertaste. Notes of roasted, almost burned nuts. Overall this is one of my favorite traditional stouts. Would love to have one on tap from a pub in Ireland one day."
""
""
""
""
"The palate opens dry with a mild lactose character with a little bit of creamy, grainy tartness. Just a touch of smoke is present, but there's also a fairly nice roast character present. Faintly hoppy on the finish with a light bitterness, this is drying , creamily so (thanks to the nitro can). Smooth on the palate, almost to a fault, this feels only faintly carbonated. I dislike what the nitro-pour's done to the mouthfeel. Solid stuff, a good step up from Guinness, but not something I'd drink a lot of. Still, it has its time and its place."
""
""
"O: Certainly drinkable, but not really worthy of the ""stout"" label. I won't be abandoning my Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout anytime soon."
""
""
""
"Very high drinkability as its low in ABV, and has a decent flavor profile."
""
"Served to me at Baton Rouge steakhouse, this dry stout came black as night, with maybe a half finger of head. Aroma was of coffee, roasted malts and a bit of caramel. Taste was lightly bitter, with a bit of chocolate sweetness. Mouthfeel was dry and a bit thick. Overall, an underwhelming beer."
""
""
""
"Anyone who thinks a dark beer is a bitter flavor bomb should drink this. I finished the can off but with no desire to drink another. Maybe if I was drinking a super fresh example in Cork I'd feel differently, but this is far too bland for me to ever want to drink agin."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sometimes I feel like having slightly more coffee grounds in my stout, and that is when I have a Murphy's. When I want more emphasis on the roasted malt, I drink a Guinness."
"O - At $8 a growler this really does hit the spot for me. I can understand others' reservations that it is not as ""big"" a stout as most, but the passive nature is very drinkable and keeps me coming back for more!"
""
""
""
""
"O - It is a filling beer. The tastes and aromas are mild. It has enough flavor to keep me interested, but not enough flavor to keep me coming back."
"O: Irish dry stouts have a reputation of being a bit plain and simple however, I really enjoyed this. Very pleasant, easy drinking and a little better than Guiness imo."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall this beer is a classic dry Irish stout. Compares favorably to Guinness, but perhaps it weighs a bit too much to session in the way one can quaff Guinnesses."
""
""
"Overall this is a decent Irish Dry Stout. I would take it over a Guinness any day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This stout does not impress me in the slightest, its a low to mid range offering, that lacks any depth of character, and doesn't have the fame or popularity of guiness, Id recommend avoiding this beer if you want anything of complexity, if you want a sessionable easy to drink stout, this might be your beer, but its not mine."
""
""
""
"O: Nothing too special here. Between this and Guinness Draught, I'd say this is slightly better. The nitro-can gimmick is nice as hell, but really, there's no substitute for having a pint of this on tap. Probably wouldn't buy cans of this stuff, though."
""

"Pours a dark almost black color with a very faint red tinge around the edges, Creamy tan head. I struggle to find any aroma. Dry very mild chocolate taste with very little bitterness. Very smooth with hardly any carbonation. Seems kind of on the bland side with not much as far as anything extraordinary. No bitterness and certainly finishes dry. I sense some sourness in the middle. Little bit of a chalky feel to it. Doesn't have anything as far as turn offs but doesn't excite the senses either."

"Overall: A half decent beer, not much in the way of flavor or aroma but what it has is pleasant. Very, very drinkable."
"The smell is not overpowering and stays low key with a lower serving tempature. It's nice overall and prefer it slightly to Guinness."
""
"Overall, this is like a better version of Guinness. I could see this being a solid session beer for winter, especially paired with the fact that it's incredibly cheap."

""

"Overall: It's like a Guinness but creamier and slightly more subdued, meaning Murphy's Irish Stout is a great beer for introducing people to the style. It's easy to dink and still maintains enough of the coffee and chocolate flavors associated with stouts to get the point across. Again, it's not the best stout out there but it's certainly not bad for a macro brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Body-Moderately heavy, very rich and creamy on the tongue without being too heavy. There is some effervescence present, though it’s somewhere between light and moderate. Overall nice, everything is in balance, the bitter offsets the sour and salty flavor, and the little bit of sweetness keeps it interesting. It’s certainly an easy drinking beer and great for a session beer due to the alcohol. Would get it again, not bad for the price. Pairs fairly well with smoked gouda."
"A nice pour. Smokey in the glass with a thick halo of head about 15% of the glass. Lacks distinction from other Irish stouts. Enjoyable but nothing remarkable. I cannot detect any strong odor emanating from the glass. I wonder if my alergies are acting up. Good mouthfeel, good taste, just good good good."
"Notes: an Irish Stout. Ho hum."
"O: This is often compared to Guinness and for good reason. They are very similar, with the Murphy's coming off as more creamy, and the Guinness coming off with slight (very light) alcohol presence. To be honest, I didn't feel like I had a beer at all. More like something you drink at Starbucks. Can't see anything special about this, but I suppose it would perfect for those starting out with beer."
"O - Not a bad beer, but just not my thing, I want a bit more flavor and mouthfeel to my stouts."
" Overall Drinkability - No redeeming qualities other than perhaps the sixer-mixer price of $1.50 per can."
"Overall: A worthy competitor, but I like Guinness better."
"Overall: Some nice roasted malt flavors going on here, but overall too watery for a stout."
"An opaque near-black with a lighter and persistent head--gorgeous lacing. The smell is mostly roasted malt, the taste is chocolate and roast with some chalk at the end, and the mouthfeel is creamy but curiously thin, offering no resistance to the gullet--kind of like a beer version of chocolate milk, comforting and smooth and sessionable."
"O: It is a well crafted beer and a great example for it's style. I will drink it again, but I can't shake the watery impressions it gives."
"O- its nice. alot of people probably hate on this beer, but for what it is I enjoyed it."
"Very creamy body, could use more carbonation."
"dr. Easy enough, but I was hoping for more from this one."
"Pours black with a thick, solid, creamy head that left plenty of lacing. Smells of roasted coffee, dark chocolate and metal. I tasted mostly bitter coffee grinds with a hint of chocolate and a slightly metallic taste. The beer is very light with almost no carbonation and a dry finish. This beer's not bad, it definitely beats Guinness Draught."
"Pours a dark black with a very creamy two finger head. Smell is of roasted malt. The taste is nice and malty but not too sweet. Not very complex but at the same time has a satisfying taste. Very creamy mouthfeel, one of the best ive noticed in a while. This stout doesnt bring anything super unique, but it does just what its supposed to as a dry stout."
"I would recommend this over Guinness"
"O: The ultimate chillin dry stout. It satisfies without making you think too much. Hard not to like this stout."
"O-It is good except for the thin mouthfeel if it was as creamy as it looks it would be really good"
"In view of the above, This is a Welsh Sweet Stout based on the Irish style! It is, in my opinion, a very nice and decent drinkable stout that edges out the equivalent Guinness product(which I also happen to like!)"
"overall a good stout with nitro"
"A tasty stout - I think it falls short of Guinness, but still a worthy adversary."
"O: I wasn't too impressed by this stout, and would not seek it out again."
"O- Despite the low ABV, and low expense, this is a stand-out beer that offers the best a craft brew drinker could hope for without crushing the palate or compromising the faculties of the frontal lobe. Really a great beer, substantial enough that having just one won't leave you dissatisfied, but many over the course of the night won't leave you burnt out from the flavor or incapacitated."
"I give two Schlitz for Murphy's Irish Stout."
"O-Very flat and naked for being a stout...taste like watered down cappuccino...very creamy and drinkable but definitely nothing amazing or even compares to other stouts...does look beautiful after you pour it though."
"A little better and more flavor than Guinness Draught. Highly drinkable."
"O: Easy drinker, good for the style, good for a few."
"o - Overall a good Irish Dry Stout that is pretty Guiness-like. Not ideal for this summer heat, but considering it was the best beer they had on tap, I would order it again before some of their other offerings."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark reddish brown with a 1 inch dense bone colored head that settles down into a small cap. Foamy thick rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt, coffee beans, and some chocolate aromas. Taste is of roasted malt and coffee primarily with some dark chocolate flavors to a lesser extent. Very faint bitterness on the palate after each sip. Mouthfeel is a bit thin with an almost flat and creamy texture. Overall, this is a pretty good irish stout but I am not sure I would get this one again."
"Overall: Decent pub beer, bit one dimensional though"
"O - I think it is as good as many of the craft varieties. It stands the test of time."
"It's been a while since I last had a Murphy's stout. Howzabout we change that today, eh? It pours a solid matte black topped by an even more solid finger of off-cream foam. The nose is pretty weak, comprising some extremely mild roasted malts, light cocoa powder, and a touch of what seemed like mint. The taste holds notes of roasted malts, light dark chocolate, very light molasses, and that light twinge of mint again. The body is a light-feeling medium, with a very light carbonation and a rather smooth feel. Overall, a solid Irish stout, one that could easily give Guinness a run for its money (though, if forced to choose, I think I'd still side a bit more quickly with the boys from St. James Gate...)."
"This beer is nearly a splitting image of Guinness, I honestly would have to try them side by side to tell the apart. The pour is a milky looking brown color as the nitro charges the beer. The head surges to the top making a tan colored creamy looking head. The smell of the beer had some earthy aromas and a light roasted smell to it. The taste was flavorful but with some of the roasted malts carrying over from the nose and some of the earthy peat flavors as well. The mouthfeel is very light and smooth despite the color. Overall it's a good brew to try I think. Worth looking into."
"O: Actually, nothing to write home about. Not bad, but not especially good either."
"Decent beer. I like it more than Guinness."
"O: Average beer in my books, nothing special but something to try if only for that look of the cascading bubbles and smooth mouthfeel."
"O: As far as Irish Dry Stouts go, Murphy's is pretty good. This might sound a little strange, but this would make a pretty good lawn mower beer as it's fairly refreshing. If you're looking for a light, refreshing dark beer with a good amount of flavor, Murphy's would be a great choice."
"O- I don't know if the scores bear it out but for me this was on par with Guinness. Easily drinkable, but not much in the substance of it for me. Good while out on the town, but not a go-to for me."
"This is better than Guiness but not by much, I'll stick to Russian Imperials thank you very much!"
"D- Not drinkable for me, I would definitely look for a different stout unless you want a less tasty/less filling stout. For the same ABV you can get much richer flavors and body."
"D - Had a few of these and enjoyed every one. If I'm ever at another spot that has it on tap, I'd grab another, but I wouldn't go out of my way for one."
"I feel this beer is very consistent with the desired style. This is one of my 'go to' beers for many occasions and foods. Its a shame this one is not on tap in as many places as I feel it should be."
"As I drink this beer more and more I find that there is substantially more creaminess to this beer than to a Guinness, Guinness is creamy and everything, but this is actually getting more and more creamy as I drink it. This affects the mouthfeel and the taste as well. I'm not going to change my grades, but still, thought it should be noted!"
"O: I think this is an above average beer in a below average style. I'd like more body and maybe a touch more sweetness but I don't want to knock the beer too hard for being done right. I like that it has a low ABV but I would take an English Dark Mild over this every day of the week."
"Overall: Absolutely comparable to (and some might argue, better than) Guinness Stout. I, for one, would be one to argue. This is phenomenal, and I really hope I can find it on tap sometime soon!"
"By the way, let me take this opportunity to state that I recognize the pub draft can (i.e., the nitro-can) as one of mankind's greatest inventions. I put it right up there between penicillin and peanut butter. Anyone else out there remember what dry stouts in the USA were like before these came along?"
"T: Again, not huge at all, but not terrible. Roasted malts are really all I pick up until a thin and metallic-tasting aftertaste. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy but the body's pretty light. I'd take this over a Guinness, but not a whole lot else in this category."
"O: This used to be among my favorites. Still hard to beat for a low ABV drink to go with a meal. More pedestrian than in my youth....but a nice drink."
"Creamy feel on this. The carbonation is low, but it's typical for a nitro beer. Overall nothing really great here. I got this because my first beer choice was kicked. It's servicable and I enjoyed it well enough. Not a bad go to with little options."
"Overall this is a very nice, smooth, easy drinking Irish Stout. At 4% this is a very nice session beer that is a nice alternative to Guiness."
"Poured black with a light tan all foam head that remains throughout consumption. Nose was dark roast malt, light coffee notes and mild brewers licorice. Taste was light flavoured, seemingly flat and boring; licorice, dark malts but remains watery and unimpressive. Mouthfeel was very lite and thin. Overall a weaker effort than the draft Guiness that's offered in chain restaurants here. Good abv, sessionable but thin on body and taste."
"Overall, fairly average for a draught Irish dry. Still tasty and highly drinkable."
"Overall - Basic Irish Dry here in fact it couldn't get anymore basic, I wish this was more robust and had stronger scent to it. That said go grab one and see for yourself."
"O- The lack of flavor in this one was a bit of a disappointment but I could drink this one again."
"The two may share similarities, but there are reasons why I never order Guinness yet often jump at the chance for a pint of Murphy's where it's offered. I've added my two cents to the Great Irish Stout debate, citing flavour, mouthfeel and quality as my testimony. If anyone cares to rebuttal, I'd be happy to keep arguing over another few rounds!"
"The can widget gives it an almost soap bubble-like foam but which only rises to about 1/4"". Dark raw umber in color. Smell is malt and not much else. Taste is a very mild roasted malt. Quite possibly the weakest flavored stout I've ever had. Hey, this is an inoffensive beer which even people who don't like stout could probably handle, because frankly there just isn't much stoutlike about it besides the color. D+ folks."
"Medium bodied and a bit fuller than expected with a soft roasted malt flavor that is roasted without tasting acrid/burnt. Hints of toast, toffee and biscuit while being slightly smokey. Subtle notes of cocoa, toffee and hazelnut. Nice and dry but a bit watered down with a bit of lactic creaminess adding to the body."
"O - A good beer that has great drinkability with an overall mild taste. I really must do a side by side next time I'm able to get Murphy's and a Guinness on tap. 3.5"
"Notes: A slight step up from Guinness, but only slight. More to offer in taste than Guinness draught, but it is plagued by the same light, watery body. If you are looking for a Guinness alternative this is a step in the right direction, but there's still much better out there."
"Step aside, Guiness draft...Murphy's is a superior version of the same Irish session beer. I could quaff these all night. Glad I found the less known cousin from County Cork."
"O- Overall this is a very solid dry stout that I would most likely purchase over other more popular examples."
"At 4%, with a thin creamy feel, dry, with some decent flavor, you'd have to call this a consummate session beer. Great for when you want a stout, but don't feel like cracking open something big. There is certainly a place for beers like this in my drinking repertoire, and I rate it accordingly."
"Another great Irish Stout! Looks, smells, tastes exceptional! Was a little disappointed when one of my favorite bars stopped serving Guinness then They handed me a Murphy's and I had nothing to complain about I was all smiles! I now go out of my way for this great beer! I had some delicious corn beef & cabbage & 4 or 5 Murphy's on St. Patty's day nothing better made me wish I was Irish!"
"O: Not bad, and it is something different from the usual Guinness, but not something I'd necessarily go back to."
"When I popped this open after the nitrous fizz cleared I gave it a good sniff and got hints of roasted malts and grain. I took the first sip and it was nice and creamy mouth feel, like a good irish stout should feel. I let it sit out to warm it up a little, because I do hate having a stout to cold and it masks the flavor. So during that first sip I got the flavors of roasted malts and grains, something sweet along the lines of maybe a little caramel or syrup, but for the most part a milky malty beverage. This beer is definitely a fullbody almost milkshakey like beverage. When I drink these I like to enjoy a few, so the drinkability is there, either a sipper or a kick back and drink type of beer as well."
"D- Very easy to drink, not overly complex but still good and quite solid. A nice session beer!"
"D: Easy to have a few but then the taste overwhelms and dries the tongue. Overall a tasty beer that is above other Irish stouts in my opinion. Had this many times but glad to give it another run."
"Overall, a mixed bag. I enjoyed the look and flavor, while the aroma and mouthfeel were lacking for me. Not bad in a pinch on St. Patrick's Day."
"Overall this is a decent beer, and I would take this Irish Dry Stout over Guinness any day of the week. But it is too thin and water and not enough flavor to fully enjoy, although on the plus side it is light enough that I can drink several in one sitting."
"Poured from a can into a pint glass, the beer pours a jet black coloring with a solid, thick, creamy, two fingers beige head. The beer has a creamy nose, with mocha highlights. Flavors of coffee and dark chocolate are first into mouth, with a dark coffee bittering effect. Creamy and smooth in mouth, the beer has a semi-sweet aftertaste that draws you back for repeated drinks. Very smooth and creamy in mouth, and the light finish allows for repeated drinking. Delicious! Very easy to drink, and very easy to consume in mass quantities."
"Notes: Would pick this every time over Guinness nitro-cans. It's richer in the mid-palate, where Guinness seems to have more acidity."
"D- Great drinkability! I am going to have a couple of these tonight no problem."
"Overall: Not as sweet as Guinness' pub can offering, but I'd like a little more roasted malt flavor to go with the lovely mouthfeel. You could slam back an entire four pack, if that's your thing, at 4 percent abv. It's a fine alternative to Guinness. But if you're looking for something a little more distinctive to challenge your palate -- well, Victory makes a fantastic Imperial Stout."
"Really not a whole lot to say about this beer. Feels and tastes like water with some roasted flavoring. Looks really good, but not much to it."
"Speaking of water, I can't believe how watery the texture is on this stout. I understand this is a pedestrian stout, but I do remember it being a bit more meaty and a bit hearty way back in the early 90s. Alas, my palate has been tempered with a vast array of beefy, bruising ales in the past 20 years, but I still can't help but think this stout has been 'wussified'. I still will quaff these when I return home after slinging back a few celebrating St. Patty's Day tomorrow, while watching my Spartans play UCLA in the first round of the NCAA tourney. GO STATE!!!"
"D-well the ABV and the taste make this a beer that i can drinker more of than almost any other beer. its just great. i first had this a long time ago and it always remains a beer that i occasionally fall back on."
"Pours a small half finger head of tan creamy looking head. Deep black with some dark red coming through when held up to the light. Smells faintly of sweet malts, slight bit of alcohol, chocolate, iced coffee. Tastes initially sweet and malty, then some roast malts, coffee, dark chocolate, some bitterness and maybe some sourness. The finish is medium dry, roasty notes linger, and some hop bitterness. The lingering roasty, medium dry and sourness on the finish is kind of off putting. Medium full bodied, light carbonation. I think this fits the style buy not my taste buds. I won't have a hard time finishing one pint but would if I tried another one. Overall a descent beer, better than the more sour Guinness. $7 a four pack."
"This is the beer that Guinness was supposed to taste like. Not the greatest stout ever, but it actually has a good taste to it. This is the beer I'll take from Ireland... even if it doesn't look as good when it's poured into a glass."
"Fairly creamy mouthfeel. Very drinkable. Not extraordinary but quite good."
"Drinkability: Finishes fairly long but with a moderate bite of astringency."
"D - This has okay drinkability. It really doesn't taste that good, and the mouthfeel is too thin. It's not an offensive tasting beer, it's just not very flavorful. I like it better than guinness, even though that's not saying much. Overall, I don't really mind drinking this, but I wouldn't recommend it."
"The nitrogenation of the beer produces a much less biting texture than a heavily carbonated beer. This usually allows for a more complete realization of the flavors in the beer. It feels much thicker than Guinness in the mouth and is more drinkable to me. Overall this is a great stout and a nitro can that should be tried by anyone who enjoys Guinness, but doesn't enjoy the sometimes biting acidity of carbonated stouts."
"D - A very easy drinking and enjoyable Irish Stout... Quaffable... I could easily drink a couple of these in a sitting without hesitation... While far from world class, this is a very nice departure from the over the top stouts that are all the rage in today's beer scene..."
"It's also good for cooking. Add half a can to your next pot of chili to give it a richness that you can't get any other way."
"D - This is superiror to Guiness and a far better example of an Irish stout."
"D - I would probably prefer this over Guinness nitro, by a slim margin."
"Overall, I doubted this was going to be better than Guinness but it was. It tastes better, feels better, and is smoother. It is delicious and I plan on drinking it again in the near future."
"D: A certainly easy sipper and with loads of depth on Guinness a clear winner between the two."
"From notes: Pours deep, dark brown w/a lasting creamy, velvety smooth light biege head that laces well. Lightly roasty and chocolatey w/ a moderate nuttiness and bready freshly ground malts. A hint of sourness in the nose. Smooth flavor w/ lightly coffee roasty flavor and nutty w/a hint of burnt coffee in the finish & aftertaste. Finish is lightly dry (duh, it's a dry stout). Some light caramel malt and a hint of sourness from dark grains. Velvety smooth m/f, lighter medium body, low carbonation, just enough to let you know it's there. A bit less flavorful than some other brands, but still a good solid beer. Great session beer."
"I have been on a nitro-can kick as of late. Not sure why, but that's neither here nor there. Let's get to reviewing the Murphy's Irish Stout. Purchased locally in a 4 pk. containing 16 oz. nitro-cans. Yes, real pints, unlike Guinness and the lame 14.9 oz. can they use. One up for Murphy's here. Pours a beautiful cascade of black and tan, ultimately settling to a great, creamy tan head that lasts to the end. Taste is definitely another one up on Guinness---roasted barley and malt, some chocolate and cream. Just a hit of bitterness. Very good. Coming in at 4% ABV, this is a real lightweight---but I'm fine with that. I can sip and enjoy a few of these over an evening and be very satisfied. Given the choice, I would go with Murphy's over Guinness any day. More volume, more flavor, more real. Overall, a very good Irish stout."
"Own every trademark of Irish stout, together with low ABV it is easy drinkable without doubt."
"Overall a quite good beer."
"D: very easy to drink, fun beer, I'd have another one."
"Drink - Have em one after another, very drinkable."
"D: This is quaffability at its finest; lovely."
"RJT"
"16oz Tall Boy can. Pours what looks like a chocolate milkshake with a good sized tan head. Tons of lacing. Aromas of chocolate, coffee, a hint of caramel and some roasted malts. Taste is a nice mix of chocolate and coffee flavors. Roasted malts and a slight coffee aftertaste. This is a very drinkable creamy beer. The low ABV, drinking it chilled, and the smoothness of this one make it extremely drinkable. Underrated brew."
"D: Quite easy to drink, because while it's a pretty good tasting beer, it doesn't have a lot of presence and is kind of muted."
"Atmosphere is really nice. Deep, rich, intimidating appearance with the great head, cascading carbonation throughout, and plenty of lacing. Nose is not complex, but a good malty character with some peat and sweet notes. Flavor, also, not complex, but a really good pub draught. A little stout....and a little dry. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"Food match: Meat pie, stews, casseroles or bangers and mash (with a nice heavy gravy)."
"Overall, this Stout is my favorite for its style. I won't buy Guinness anymore."
"All in all I was pleasantly surprised with this beer. Never thought I could be this happy with a canned beer but I have been jovially proven wrong. Definitely worth a try."
"Of the ""big two"" Irish stouts, this is the more flavorful option. That's not saying much, though. It's not offensive, but probably nothing I'd actively seek out either."
"A rounded stout but it's a bit dull and it doesn't hit the roasty bitterness that would make this pop."
"There are elements in this one that are done well, but none that have my running back to it for more. Especially at the price it usually draws. Think dark Speckled Hen, or darker Boddington's."
"Compared to Guinness Draught: This is much more flavorful and significantly cheaper by the case. I think Guinness is a tasty beer but no where worth the hype or price. I'd take a Murphy's over Guinness any day, since it is better in every way."
"very good irish stout. highly drinkable. smells of roasted malts, some cocoa and coffee in their. smooth velvety mouthfeel. had 4 pints last night while building a play kitchen for my daughter. nitro can is 16 ounces vs 14 ounces (guinness). also is 8 dollar cheaper for a case."
"Drinkability: very drinkable. Isn't too thick or thin. Bitterness from the hops enough to keep it interesting. Not a bad beer."
"This beer has just won the spot of ""beer of my heart"". The way it cascades upward into that perfect nitrogen head rises equal joy in my being. It's aroma is a bit understated but is still as comforting as a childs cup of hot coco. The flavor is where this stout really outshines the rest. It's as is someone took out that strange undesirable flavor from a Guiness and repaced it with smooth chocolate esspeso. The mouthfeel is a bit watery due to the nitrogen, but this seems to enhance the drinkability of this most fulfilling and simultaniously quaffable stout."
"Drinkability -- My first revisit to my go-to stout from college has only confirmed my appreciation of this beer. Much better than Guinness Draught, easy-drinking, and arguably the best tasting beer to come from a nitro-can. I can't help but think: what if a US craft brewer made a nitro-can stout? Oh, to dream..."
"I also used for a Black and Tan and was (finally) successful--can said ""Draught Style Stout, "" but I think it is the same as this beer, just a slightly different can."
"Well it was still lacking some of that much loved 'body', it did have more than the nitro-cans do. When drinking this out of a can, I like to crack it open really cold, then let it breath up to a good, slightly higher than normal temperature before I pour and drink. It seems to make it taste a little more heavy if that makes any sense."
"Had this at Hurley's Irish Pub in Montreal. Really felt like a stout, none of the brewpubs were open yet, so figured this would do. Pours pitch black with thick off-white head that doesn't dissipate at all. Lacing all around the glass. Pretty much looks like you'd expect with a nitro stout. Smells of roasted malt, with hints of chocolate and coffee. Really nice flavour, basically like a Guiness, with more flavour. Very creamy mouthfeel. Really nice stout that hit the spot."
"Easy to drink, but overall a fairly mediocre stout."
"Pours a deep blackish brown color with a thick tan head and some great lacing. Smells of vanilla and roasted barley with some sweet notes. Tastes of vanilla, roasted barley, a little sweetness with enough bitterness to even it out. Dry finish to this pretty good beer. Mouthfeel is medium with a little carbonation. Drinkability is decent."
"Drinkability - Overall good beer and glad i tried it, would be interested to see how it taste in a can. I can see myself having one or two of these, but that would be my limit."
"Drinkability - to be honest, I don't love the taste. I like the smokiness, but there's also a ""staleness", which I think is actually from the high hop content."
"Nitro-Can. Super creamy and light. Tastes sweet like milk chocolate, but might not be as flavorful and complex as some other irish stouts. A little one note. Easy to drink, i could chug this if I wanted to. This is still one of my go to beers after many years. Excellent."
"If looks could kill, all you can want. Jet black, creamy tan head, no signs of carbonation and incredible lacing. Toasted bread aroma, not too strong, not to weak. So far, so good. Ah, but true beauty is skin deep. Flavor is shallow. All I can find is some malt around the middle and a bit of bitterness in the back end. Artificial sweetener sensation after the finish. Mouthfeel is even a disappointment, as it is a bit rougher than the nitro would have you hope for."
"drinkability - 4%abv hell yes this is a session beer"
"Fans of Irish stouts (like me) are best off reaching for a Guinness or a Beamish in the pubs - and a Guinness Foreign Extra in the store."
"Pour produces the standard nitro-driven cascade. Black stout with one finger of long lasting 'driven tan head. Nose of barley and spicy hops. Barley malt and molasses up front with hops bitterness at the back, and a hoppy, chocolatey, dry finish. Mouthfeel is good, medium, smooth body. High drinkability due to creaminess and low ABV."
"From nitro tallboy. Pours and looks beautiful. Dense black with just a hint of mohagany around the base of the glass. Lots of roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate, smokey though all subdued. Creamy milkshake-ish feel but still thin. All in all I'm much more impressed by this beer than I ever thought I would be going in."
"Drinkability is high, with such a low abv and light body but full of lots of subtle and well balanced flavors."
"Carbonation felt super low, and this was watery without much body. Surprised this was so watery and not creamy at all to me. A light bodied and light tasting bittersweet brew. Seems like the kind of thing people would throw down multiple pints of while killing the afternoon at the local pub. Too watery and a bit weak for my tastes. I guess this style's just not for me..."
"Drinkability: I could drink these all day."
"Finishes dry with a touch of residual sugar, lots of lingering creamy nitro and light bitter stout flavors. Little dry fruity Irish yeast too."
"D - Not too bad. Much more flavor than Guinness with a nice contrast between the chocolate and roasted malt flavors. The style is inherently limited, but this is pretty drinkable."
"Not bad if you're just looking to knock back a few while watching a game at the pub or something, but pretty average tasting overall."
"Drinkability is good; just a bit fuller and more rounded flavor than Guinness Draught, its major comparison point, with a nice abv and no real rough edges. Now, nitro wears on me personally, but it's also pretty typical for the style, so I didn't deduct from teh score for personal preference."
"Poured black with two fingers of tan head, good retention, and good lacing. Smelled very roasted, with hints of dry cocoa powder and sharp coffee bean. The taste confirmed the aroma, with a big roasted malt backdrop, accompanied by a dry subtle coffee/cocoa blend and a dry finish; a very good session stout, with a smooth, slick, nitro-enhanced body."
"Pours and looks just like guinness. Black in color with a long lasting and tasty beige head that will not go away until you rinse the glass. The taste in my opinion is very similar to guinness in that is taste of coffee and light hoppyness, and is very creamy feeling. Since my palate is not trained well i can not distinguish why i like Guinness more, but i do"
"D - the weight and thickness make it fill me up incredibly quickly. this could be good or bad, depending on your stance on the subject."
"drinkability: this is where this guy really shines. I find myself gulping this refreshing brew. I do believe this is the most quaffable brew I've ever had."
"Mouthfeel is superior, has a nice creaminess to it, seems more filling so a couple pints would be enough for me. Only cost me $7.99 for a four-pack of pint-cans, so this is a pretty good deal. Besides the thickness it isn't really strong or bitter, so I'm sure other drinkers could put away more than me."
"Final Thoughts: How is this stuff not served where Guinness is available? I mean, the extra stout has it's place but this stuff simply trumps the draught in every aspect. Smoother, much better balanced and less alcohol content make this offering exceptional. No question, thumbs up. If you see it and haven't tried it, buy it."
"Smell was roasted/toasted malt notes with some sweetness thrown in. This stout has a nice sweetness to it that balances out the bitterness quite well. A terrific balance in this stout. Provides a creamy/velvety mouthfeel. I could drink these like the Energizer Bunny...."
"Wow - can you say Bacon? This is very smokey and tastes a lot like bacon! very odd! Fairly tasty but I'd say this is a step below Guinness nitro cans. It's got a bit of a sweet malt on the finish but the bacon dominates."
"I probably won't buy this again, but I'm glad I have something to compare my Guinness Extra Stout to now."
"D- ditto on M."
"D - Probably the best of the nitrogenated Irish Stouts I've tried, but I'd still rather have an O'Hara's any day of the week."
"Drinkability: I remember liking this mush more in my non ba days."
"Pours a very milky dark brown with a head of 1.5cm (after I let it settle a bit) that's very creamy and isn't going anywhere. Smells of roast coffee and chocolate, very malty, not yeasty at all. Tastes very malty, with the same roast flavors the aroma was alluding to. There's a small amount of bitterness at the end, and not a lot of the nasty flavor I usually get from nitro-cans. The mouthfeel is very creamy and smooth and a little lighter than I expected. Very nice. A very drinkable beer, and I'm not really a fan of stouts, but this is a very tasty brew and not overpowering at all."
"Overall an enjoyable beer on its own, good session candidate. However ends up last in this shootout, largely due to the finish."
"D: At 4% and with a light yet creamy character, this is a very drinkable beer. It's also somewhat of an enigma, having such a light aroma for the taste, then being light bodied but creamy... I don't know I'll just say it's a pretty good beer."
"D: this is a beer to spend a night with in a quiet pub."
"Congratulations, Murphy's. You've become my first drain pour."
"Drinkability is obviously there, I can't put this beer down when I start drinking it, if I can't do that with an Irish stout, then it's not a good stout. Had this a day after a few guinnesses, Murphys is much more flavorful and creamy."
"Obviously Guinness comparisons here are hard to avoid but I should say this is actually slightly more bitter than Guinness but with a richer taste. Would be hard to split the two - you'd have this one day and the other the next."
"This has to be the best dry stout I've had out of the maybe 10-12 I've tried (I'm more of an Imperial Stout admirer). Definitely will go back for seconds."
"Ok this was my first time having this beer, and I was blown away by it. It was so smooth and creamy, and not just in appearance but in flavor, and mouthfeel. The color was dark and luxurious, with and nice firm long lasting head. The aroma was full of roasty goodness, and malt. I can definitely see why some people prefer this stout over a Guinness, its less astringent for one, but me I prefer both just because of their differences. If you can find this on tap try it, I have never had it from the can mind yah. The worst part about this beer was patiently waiting for the bartender to pour it."
"Easy enought to drink. Pretty good beer overall."
"D: This is drinkable; simple but drinkable"
"D- Low alcohol content makes it pretty easy to drink. Goes down easily."
"D- It's an easy drinker (pretty common for the style), on par with Guinness or Beamish. Without doing a side-by-side, it seemed a little more refined."
"Anyway, the beer is typical of the style and will fare rather well as a flavouful sessionable beer. No problemo !"
"D) Delicious! This has always been one of my favorite stouts."
"Overall: I like pretty much anything about this beer. I wish more people would know about it, considering it seems to be a famous beer in Ireland. Goes toe to toe with Guinness like no other! Better than American Guinness, not better than Irish Guinness."
"man, it is so hard to distinguish between the Big Three irish stouts. having just reviewed Beamish, this tastes awfully similar, but equally as good. looks glorious with the little bubbles in the glass. taste and finish is roasty but clean. i guess it's just hard for me to find a well-made irish dry stout that i don't like."
"The appearance is pretty much black with a tan head. The head was not as creamy as some nitro beers but it was acceptable. The aroma is very toasted with both coffee and chocolate. The taste is like the aroma with a burnt biter finish. The palate is to thin for the style especially for a nitro beer. The beer is very drinkable overall but has some problems."
"Overall: A superior stout. Obviously, there will be comparisons with Guinness; this one is significantly better. Everything a stout should be without pushing any boundaries. Extreme beer? Not today, friend. Today I'm back to the basics, and I'm loving it."
"D: It's a good drinker. Very smooth, very easy drinking, very low ABV. Good beer."
"D- This is a dry-irish stout. Big look and decent smell and high drinkability as a session beer. Its low in ABV and calories so you could drink a big ole' mess of 'em. If there isn't anything worth while on tap and they have a nitro-system. Grab a murphy's and Ka-tang to the irish."
"drinkability-could play cards and drink this, if that's what there was. not overly impressed. would not buy again."
"later"
"In conclusion, I find this beer to be enjoyable, even if it is a little simplistic. I can't say that I would, in any way, pass on my old favorites to partake in this offering, but this brew does have a place. Additionally, considering I found a 4 pack of pints at my local grocer for 5.99, I can't complain whatsoever. All in all, a solid B beer."
"A superb dry Irish stout. I don't know if it's just contrarian of me or not (heh), but I always seek this out, whereas Guinness just seems to always be there, Murphy's just isn't that easy to find. A shame or a boon, I don't know, because I could happily sip on these all bloody night!"
"A good beer that I will have when more desirable options are not available."
"Pours a nice brown color, nice carbonation, nice two-finger creamy tan head, with some nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, slightly roasty, lots of caramel. The taste is malty, some roast notes, and caramel. Light body. Drinkable, not a bad brew."
"Cheers!"
"As with most nitro products, the pour created a nice looking creamy head and a cool waterfall look for a few seconds. Once settled, it had a dark brown, almost black, color with notes of amber. Head lingered and laced well as expected. Nose is almost non-existent. Sweet milky taste with a little roasted grain and chocalate notes thrown in. Very simple flavor that works well. Creamy and smooth mouthfeel with a slighty dry finish. Quite drinkable. Not the best stout I've ever had (or had this week- O'haras gets that honor) but a pretty solid brew nonetheless."
"In honor of St. Patrick's Day - 16 fl. oz. nitro-can served in my Sam Smith Nonic. Poured with a cascading, creamy/frothy head that eventually coalesces into a two inch dense, tan-colored cap. Head eventually settles into a solid one inch cap with thick sheets of lacing coating the sides of the glass and exhibiting excellent adherence. Appearance is a dark brown with ruby highlights around the edges and when backlit. Nose is subtle - dry with a hint of roast. Taste follows nose, with the addition of an expression of light, toasted malt, a slightly watery quality and a metallic flavor that peaks out at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-bodied, with the consistency of watery milk. Pretty good drinkability for the style and really quite easy to session, although my preference is for Guinness Draught."
"Notes - There's not much to this other than the drinkability and creamy mouthfeel. It's not even from Ireland: it says on the can that it was made in Edinburgh. I feel ripped off."
"D - okay, but I'll pass."
"D-a very drinkable beer with a good taste and a light body that can easily be enjoyed throughtout the night"
"Up Cork."
"Nothing wrong this just isn't my style. I wouldn't order one but I wouldn't turn one down."
"From nitro-can number 30-04-7-L9111-10-17:27. Sampled on March 8, 2010. The pour is dark brown with a snowy widget-enhanced silky, creamy tan head and busy carbonation. The head is a good inch thick. The aroma is of dark caramel malts, toffee, and even a tiny hint of smokiness. The mouthfeel runs about medium but comfortable. The taste is quite clean and crisp with a bit of vanilla bean and pleasingly bitter hops. It is also a tad soapy. Basically likeable."
"I really enjoyed Murphy's Irish Stout. I was similar to Guinness (obviously). It was a very dark stout, but little head. The flavor was comparable to Guinness. I thought this beer was extremely smooth. There was little bitterness and aftertaste. Great texture, just went down smoothly, not sure how else to describe it. If you like Irish stouts, I recommend Murphy's."
"Drinkability: Well, while it's relatively light body and cream mouthfeel helps to ease it down the gullet, it's also a bit bland and forgettable."
"Here's an Irish stout that is smoother and more balanced than Guinness, without giving up classic flavors. Yum."
"Notes: Nice to get at a bar with a limited selection, especially if you want something smooth and creamy. Somewhat sweet and somewhat bitter."
"D: High. The bitter aftertaste and the low ABV improves a lot its drinkability."
"The mouthfeel is velvety, some might think it's watery due to the nitrogen carbonation and the body is light. Very drinkable; a good, more obscure Guinness substitute."
"Pours a very dark brown colored body, opaque, with a big creamy light brown color head. Lasting head. Chocolaty aroma, some rasted scents. Has a light watery taste. Body is somewhat creamy. Very watery taste, light on flavor."
"D- A very tasty beer. The flavor was complex, rich and inviting. An overall enjoyable beer that I took a liking too."
"D - The low ABV makes me think I could session with this. The finish isn't quite as clean as I'd like though for a beer I'd want to drink more than several of."
"Not bad for a low alcohol beer I guess."
"Truly, this may be the ideal thing to get a belly full of. It tastes sublime, so you guzzle until there is no more room. At that point, you still aren't too wasted. I've loved this ever since it was available with the widget (and before??). It makes me imagine driving off in a Bristol on the wrong side of the road. Wonderful."
"D- This was a very drinkable beer I suppose. I didn't like the water down feeling to this beer at all. It would stop me from ever trying it in either the bar or at home once again."
"Had this on-tap just for the hell of it. I've had it canned before, and my beer tastes have developed quite a bit since then, but still, this tastes almost exactly like Guinness draft.. I don't understand the high rating on here. It looks neat when poured due to the nitro, however, it still tastes like someone took a very mediocre stout and added a whole bunch of water. Well overpriced for what you get. I will not give this beer three strikes; two tries were enough for Murphy's."
"Drinkabilty is killer because of low carbonation and straight forward tase"
"Drinkability:The body is perhaps too dense .A little carbonation would do great,overall a excellent beer"
"A very good Irish Stout which I highly recommend to anyone."
"Overall, a prime example of the style and without a doubt my favorite session beer."
"Of course any beer of this style begs a comparison to Guinness. Although I'm not a big stout drinker, I'd have to say I prefer Murphy's. Definitely a recommendation for any fan of this type of beer."
"Pours black with a sliver of chestnut at the bottom of the glass. Short but characteristically creamy beige head. Very light, sweet malty aroma...a hint of chocolate. Light, sweet, dark roasted malt flavor. Hints of bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and nuts. Very thin, obviously meant for drinking in numbers. Light and creamy mouthfeel. Easily drinkable, if boring."
"Taste, like an Irish stout, is smoother than the appearance. Very silky. Likeable, mouthfeel doesn't change, first sip is like the last, but you might not stop at one, once you get into a flow with these. Decent, but not mindblowing to say the least."
"Brew is very drinkable, very smooth. This is the better option then the Guinness Draught can. Good."
"D: This is a very drinkable stout. Would easily pick up a case of this..."
"D: Good as it gets; great example of the style."
"Poured into a pilsner style glass (I know but too lazy to get a proper one). I love the cascade effect from the nitro and the head that it leaves. Not as dark as most stouts since light shines through and not as much aroma. Really smoth a subtle taste. Not as dry as other Irish stouts. A little on the weak side of stout."
"Drinkability is good. Between the light but pleasant taste and the creamy smooth mouthfeel, this is a good session beer."
"D: the paragon of the dry Irish stout style. This is a must try for any DIS fan."
"Poured from a 16 oz. nitro can. Has a black color with a 1 inch head. Smell is a bit sweet, chocolate and malts. Taste is rather mild, malts with hints of coffee. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and drinkability is very good. Overal this is a fine quality beer."
"D: I enjoy this irish stout quite a bit and it is my go to at a bar that serves only macros. It's great for the price too."
"A very enjoyable beer. I think I would enjoy it with a hearty meal, or smoked cheese."
"D - I really enjoyed this and could put a few down easily. To be perfectly honest I think this puts Guinness to shame. I would doubt if there is a creamier and smoother Irish stout out there that maintains great flavor without any odd flavors or after-tastes."
"Pours nearly black in color with a thick (finger plus) creamy head of tanned silk goodness which is only seen in the power of nitro. Tons of lacing completely coating the glass. Lacking in the aroma department, not much of a nose except for slight bits of malt. Burnt barley plays most of the flavor profile. Slightly bitter but with a clean finish. As it warms it has a bit of a metallic taste that lingers. Light feel mostly in part by the nitro."
"Drinkability is quite good. Its goes down very easy and is nice and tasty. A definite session beer for me. This beer is much better than Guinness and Beamish to me. It just seams to have a much more pleasing flavor."
"Decent flavor profile, but a bit on the lighter side which fits, I suppose, with the low ABV. Toasted chocolate malts and marshmallow creme balance nicely with a subtle, earthy hop bite that suggests wood and spice. Normally, I find the mouthfeel of nitro-taps and -cans to be phenomenal, but this is just ""okay""...nevertheless, the creamy-smooth body is a delight to consume, albeit on the thinnish side. Great drinkability, glad I picked up this single can at Specs because I'd forgotten how tasty these UK nitro-beers can be."
"D - I took my time drinking this beer because of its superior taste and smell. One of my most enjoyable beer experiences in a while."
"D- May be a session beer for many but I can't get enough flavor out of it to recommend drinking too much of it without a meal. Really pairs well with a diverse range of foods from breakfast pancakes to lunch corned beef on rye with swiss to dinner steak."
"M)"
"D:I find this beer very easy to drink and drink a lot very easly and will buy many more cases in the future."
"Good appearance, dependable taste, and low ABV make this a very easy drinker. I'd prefer Oatmeal Stout in general to this, but Murphy's does a nice job here overall."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, very drinkable and with the low ABV this is a great session beer. Affordable too.. thumbs up."
"Verdict: Murphy's Irish Stout is a cheerful enough Irish Dry Stout, though really nothing new if you've ever tried Guinness. So, if you're a Guinness fan looking for something just a little different, this might just be the beer for you to try next."
"Notes - Guiness is great, so is Murphys. If youve had Guiness, try Murphys. In my opinion, Murphys has more character and flavor but both are the 2 of my favorite stouts."
"Beautiful creamy head on this black beer. Very malty flavor to balance out the high hop content. The roasted malt taste isn't that unpleasant either so it makes the beer easy to drink. The body of this beer isn't that heavy either which I find helpful in the drink-ability as well. If you're a fan of guinness then you'll enjoy this beer, probably better."
"Drinkability has decent marks due to its light body, and modest flavor."
"Overall this seemed like a classic dry Irish stout. Worth a shot."
"A pleasant surprise after being dissapointed the first time."
"Very black beer poured from a nitro-tap into a pint glass at O'Donovans Irish Pub it Minneapolis, MN. Bubbles started at the bottom and slowly rose in a cascade to form a thick creamy white foam head at the top. No way you're seeing through this beer, not even with a flashlight. Very smooth and somewhat creamy as with most of the well known irish stouts around. Definitely an easy beer to drink as it is soft in the mouth and goes down smooth. Low in alcohol so you could probably drink it all night without becoming too inebriated. The drinkability is also high so you should have no problem getting through a few. Definitely worth a try."
"A very easy to drink, well balanced stout. Similar to a Guinness, but with a bit less roasted malt flavor."
"pretty similar to guinness, actually. I'd like to try them side by side sometime. But, from my notes, Murphy's is a slight bit more acidic/tart up front, and finishes a with less fruit, and bit drier with a little less hop bittering and a little more roast coming though."
"On tap for $3. looks great, black, substantial foamy head. The smell is quite average, a bit of malt, boring. The taste reminds me of syrupy molasses and is just as unimpressive. I think I like Guinness better but this was still quite easy to drink.."
"D: This is one of the better nitro cans out there. I'd love to try it on nitro-tap!"
"(D)- A fine stout that is very easy to drink. Simple and straightforward, but enjoyable for its simplicity. If there were a session stout, then this would be at the top of that list."
"Poured it with a thin one inch tan head appearing after the suds subsided. The coloring is reddish black. Not much to smell, maybe a bit of cocoa. Taste is pretty good like pure cocoa in liquid form. It has a crisp muddy suddsy feel. Goes down easy enough if you like a bitter stout"
"D: i love this beer my favorite stout from ireland my opion way better than guinness"
"Drinkability- Very refreshing. I'm surprised. I didn't know a stout could be so refreshing and satisfying. This is the first daught I've ever had though and the lowest ABV for a beer. Session is written all over this one."
"This beer feels good in the mothh. It's very creamy. In addition, the drinkability is enjoyable."
"Overall a tasty, lively brew that is better (IMO) than the more popular Guinness offering."
"D: Not too much, maybe one day in Ireland I'll have another one."
"D: The low ABV and general lightness make this an outstanding session beer. I'm really glad I had this."
"Taste: Not a whole lot to the taste. Sweet, smokey, little bit of bitterness."
"Drinkability: the bitterness seems to build as a cumulative aftertaste, but I don't really think this hurts it. I would have no problem having several of these out at the pub."
"D - Here's a nitro stout I can get behind. Very sessionable at 4%, and has that 1 or maybe 2-dimensional flavor you're looking for in a solid social beer. Flavor is also a little more pronounced than its estranged brother, Guinness Draught. Overall, this would be a great ""pub crawl"" beer."
"this is a good stout. not the best stout, but good. i think this is on par with guinness. Its not quite as good, but it has more coffee taste to it, which i enjoy alot. without the coffee notes, this wouldn't be nearly as good. if you like guinness but want somethign different, try this. If you want a great full flavored stout, try something else. where i go they usually only have 1 stout on tap at a time, so i'll get this when i'm in the mood, and thats what they have"
"Pretty standard stuff but the best of the big three (Guiness, Murphy's, Beamish) IMO."
"While this is a boring beer, it's highly drinkable due to the fact there are not many characteristics to ponder. Makes a good session beer to drink with some buds, and talk about the weather."
"Comes out of the tap a deep, opaque warm sable with a fine-bubbled tan head - it looks a lot like a well-poured Guinness. Malty, smoky aroma has a firm hint of coffee and is almost like Guinness though not quite as good. Flavor is smoky and malty with a coffee undertone. Velvety smooth, fizzy texture is redolent of Guinness. A worthy stout."
"Overall, the beer is not bad to drink a few but I wouldn't go around hunting for it."
"At 4%ABV, you can drink these all day, if you want too. Also, the taste is not so overpowering that you feel compelled to sip. This is a working man's stout. You can pound them down with no remorse, and if it takes you more than 8 rings to finish the pint, you're a wee girly man."
"Murphy's Irish Stout is a solid black beer with a solid cream colored nitro head. The metallic aroma is pretty muted by the head. It is medium-light bodied and smooth; pretty flat, actually. The finish is watery. It tastes a little roasty, minty and quite metallic. It has a decent herbal bitterness at the finish. It kind of tastes like the can. This was from a blind tasting with Beamish and Guinness. It ranked last."
"This is one I've been interested in trying for a while so here we go. Poured from a can into a pint glass it pours a pretty much black color with a nice cream colored head. Head has decent retention and leaves good lacing down the glass. Smells of faint coffee and roasted malts. Pretty typical for an Irish Dry Stout. Taste is pretty much what I expected, some coffee but it's not very powering. The roasted malts are there as well but once again not to powerful. Pretty much what I was expecting, obviously a lot like Guinness Draught just a little different, don't know if I could pick which was better. The mouthfeel is very creamy and the beer has a pretty low ABV, no problem drinking this one I could do it all night. Overall really good, I'll pick it up again when I'm wanting something other than Guinness when I'm wanting a Irish Dry Stout."
"Cheers!!"
"Dark black in color with a thick, creamy head. Nose that is full of nice malty tones and displays some ""creaminess"" that I associate with stouts and I would guess is imparted by oatmeal or something similar. Smooth attack and flavor with some hints of coffee and roasted malts. The finish is clean and this is an easy beer to drink. There are some fruity hints that bubble up from time to time, but more a sensation than a flavor."
"I'm not sure I'd want to drink more than one of these at a time. It's not a bad beer, and the Irish seem to like it (had it at an Irish eatery), but it's not something I'd want to drink very often."
"d- goes down very smooth and is all day drinkable."
"Overall, a very nice Irish stout. I've only had Guiness a few times, but would prefer this any day over that. Especially considering they were the same price on the menu. Would be happy to order another next time I see it on tap."
"Smallish tanned head keeps tight, pretty marginal for a nitro tap. Color is dark brown, some highlighting. Good lace. Nose is a little wimpy, although roasted malt is noted, along with the coffee. Flavor's about the same, roasted, weak coffee notes. Body is very thin, almost watery, but creamy enough with the nitrogen. Obviously sessionable, but not too much excitement to keep me interested."
"Drinkability well you can't really go wrong with any of the Big 3 of Ireland I prefer Beamish, Murphy's then Guinness"
"Thin but creamy, not overly carbonated. There aren't a lot of beers more drinkable than this"
"gotta love murphey's.. amazing in ireland but still good here. from nitro pint can, pours gray then layers black as only irish stouts can. 2 1/2 finger creamy head -yup the nitro-, takes a while to simmer down then provides excellent lacing. smells of roasted grains and barley, perhaps coffee, very smokey. medium to lighter body (for a stout) in mouth, holds up quite well. can taste the cocoa and coffee first finished by the roasted additions. creamy and smooth, very drinkable -an easy-going stout for sure."
"Beats another Dry Stout. It really is a great beer and if the price is right will displace all variations of Guinness dry stouts in the future. You really need to try this if you think Guinness is the end all of Irish Stouts. A pint of Murphy's will be just as amazing as that first time you enjoyed Guinness Draught. Enjoy."
"My second favorite stout, only preceded by Sierra Nevada. This is so much better than Guiness. Much more flavor, more creamy... more everything. Just a smaller more unknown brand. It seems to be VERY hard to find in the USA.... My local 'podunk' liquor store carries this on a regular basis (thank goodness). Even the famous West Michigan Irish Pub doesn't carry this stuff... and when I asked they said it wasn't available in the US, lol. If you find it try it... Otherwise go for a Sierra Nevada Stout, or just as rare a Beamish."
"OVERALL: A good nitro stout; enjoyable and drinkable for sure. Unfortunately the canned versions never quite have the same feel as the nitro-taps in the pub. I remember this one being much better when I used to session it at the Irish joint in Hamburg. Non-the-less, the canned version is a decent brew I'd pick up again."
"This is a beer that doesn't get as much respect as it should. I know that Guinness is the media favorite, but I wouldn't necessarily say that it's that much better than this brew. Given the price, I think it's nice to throw down a few of these every now and then. It may be a bit more costly than Guinness, but if you haven't tried it you really should. This beer is definately one of the more underrated ones. I don't know if it will ever find its way out of Guinness's shadow, but it's still a worthy competitor, regardless."
"M/D: The beer had a thick feel to it. The beer was rich, smooth and very creamy and the carbonation was good, but not really all that noticeable. The beer was very easy to drink and honestly, way better than Guinness."
"Beer coats the tongue with an unforceful wash of stout flavor. Not too strong a taste, but that would keep you from taking a 12-pack of these down in no time, which wouldn't be a good thing."
"Final Thoughts - Nice draught style brew to enjoy at the house. Very affordable in the pub can 4 pack. Give it a try."
"Drinkability - This is a very sessionable beer, no doubt. I love the sweet nature of the flavor, this one is a couple steps above Guinness in my opinion."
"Taste is pleasant and offers a very good feel and drink. An easy drinking stout that does finish a bit thin, but at 4.0% that is to be expected. Singles available from T-Joe's, nice!"
"D: Pretty good. Not my first choice, but I would drink it again."
"i decided to dump a shot of coffee into this son of a bitch just to see what would happen, so this review is for murphy's irish coffee stout. pretty much opaque in appearance, nearly black in color, the coffee makes this stuff look a bit less girly i guess. signature frothy nitro head is prevalent and long-lasting. the aroma is of coffee and that's basically it. it's somewhat charred and burnt, but that's probably my fault for burning the coffee. the taste is coffee with maybe a bit of beer in the background, hard to tell, the coffee is somewhat overwhelming. fairly dry mouthfeel, a little chalky (possibly from coffee grounds). drinkability is good, this would make a nice morning picker-upper. in fact, i think i'll have one of these in the morning."
"Pours black with a tan frothy head that left little lacing . Not much to the smell. Smooth and light with noticeable carbonation. Not too bitter. Guinness was my first stout and although I still enjoy it, this is better. It is really easy to drink, leaves you wanting more."
"Simply delicious and drinkable."
"D,it`s drinkable ,not the best stout on the market ,but enjoyable to sip on ."
"D- I would rank this pretty well. Its a nice alternative to Guinness. I prefer Guinness over this, but this is pretty damn good too. I think that Murphy's has a tad more bitterness than Guinness."
"D- Good session Irish dry stout. Seems to be pretty true to the style. Could definitely have a few of these in a sitting."
"I'd heard that this was better than Guinness, and I can see that, but it's not that much better. Maybe on draught..."
"An easy-drinker, and a nice dry stout. Not much more to be said; an excellent session beer, inoffensive and nicely balanced."
"this beer finishes like a drinkable beer should, makes you crave more. the abv would allow that. if i were to get a shot of this on a nitro-tap the rating could be easily inflated"
"D - Very drinkable drought Irish Stout. These types of beers are delicious to me and go down like water. I could have it all night."
"A rather black pour with a lasting creamy white head. Smell is some roast malt, wet grass. Taste is also light roast malt, cream and some chocolate. Sticks to the glass. Very nice creamy body, but a bit watery. Fairly dry finish. Slightly more balanced than Guiness. A good drinker."
"D - Highly drinkable and delicious. Low abv and carbonation make this an excellent session beer."
"Just enough body to keep this from being a chugger, but thin enough where the pints could go down fast. As you begin to try more complex stouts, you see this beer in a different category -- it is gateway stout. Worth trying and having a couple of times a year, but this won't blow your doors off either."
"I can't say that I particularly love the flavor of this beer. These nitrogen widget cans can definitely hurt the flavor of a beer, but they make the thing so darn pretty. The head is like meringue, and the separating bubbles are enjoyable to watch. The aroma is roasty and a bit nutty. The flavor is on the bland side of Irish dry stouts but certainly not bad. It's a welcome change from Guinness. I would love to have a fresh pint closer to the source."
"The creaminess and mild flavor make for an excellent session stout."
"D: Drinkable like Guinness is drinkable."
"MF&D - the feel is thin like a normal nitro stout. but this one is a bit thicker which makes up for the supreme lack of carbonation that these beers tote, thus it earns the 3.5. I still have yet to find something with a really good body that is satisfying as a stout without nitro."
"Excellent drinkability. Not the best stout I've had but it packs pretty decent flavor and provides an enjoyable drinking experience."
"The mouthfeel was nice, smooth and complimented creamy nature of taste. This all added up to a better than average drinkability i feel. Under right circumstances, relaxing in the pub, live music, etc, this is an ideal beer. (could be influenced by drinking it in this exact situation)"
"This Irish Stout is pasteurized, pressurized, draught style, in a 1 pint can and pours a beatifully authentic pub draught style creamy head with a pitch black body. The head smells of light chocolates and maybe a bit of coffee. The taste of the body of the beer is a bit thin for a stout and felt somewhat metallic on the palate, however, the rich creamy head offsets this upon mixing your mouth. I would say this stout is much better than the overrated Guinness but if you want the real stout experience, go for Young's Double Chocolate, Samuel Smith's or North Coast."
"Overall, I enjoyed this as a treat for St. Patrick's Day, but I much prefer Guiness over Murphy's. Worth a try, but not something I will pick up regularly."
"D: Not my favorite beer, but nothing really hindering the drinkability."
"D: Nice session stout; sweeter alternative to Guinness and a nice change of pace. Definitely something for when I'm in the mood for a nitro-stout."
"Well it has been a number of years since I had my last Murphys but what I remember of it, I did like it. The can poured to a nice dark brown color that is hedging on black, has a nice creamy light tan colored head that had great retention and left some nice lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is somewhat mellow but quite nice, toasted malt, some chocolate and coffee notes. The flavor is also good, similar properties to what was identified in the nose. Toasted malt, chocolate and coffee are there with some sweet properties and the end has a quite dry finish. Nice feel as it is very slick and velvety. Nice brew, not quite what I remember but over the past few years my choice of beers have changed a it. Still a nice brew to have once in a while."
"A pre-St. Patty's trip to Meiklejohn's in E-Burg. Chocolate milk (look) in the glass, dark brown with those wonderful nitro-tap bubbles cascading down the sides. Gorgeous tan head of foam that leaves the telltale moustache with each sip and lasts right to the end. Smell is smoky malt (as expected) with smooth mouthfeel and rich, subtle carbonation. Flavor is uniquely balanced malt with less bitterness than Guinness, rendering the whole much more drinkable. I know what I'll be enjoying on the 17th while someone I know (N&E) are in Ireland. Must be nice."
"Drinkability: It's smooth, but also watery, as if Murphy's brewed a stout and diluted it...heavily. Yet it's amazing. Here's to you, Leopold."
"Overall, this is a decent Irish Dry Stout that is very refreshing and I could sit down and have a few of these."
"Very drinkable, and modest ABV adds to that."
"Drinkability: I prefer Murphy's in the can to Guinness, and it's one of those every-once-in-a-while stouts that I can't help getting a 4-pack of for the price and drinkability. Bars get away with selling it at an insane price, but having a few on a cool night always makes it a better one."
"OVERALL IMPRESSION: This is not a beer that will wow your socks off with intensity of flavor or aroma. Rather, it is a mellow, quaffable, pub ale that I think would be perfect for long evenings of shooting the breeze with good friends. I think the easy drinking nature of this beer is a showcase and a perfect beer for someone who wants a light pub ale with a little with a roasted twist. It would pair exceptionally well with traditional pub grub like fish and chips, thick rich stews, or steamed oysters."
"On nitro tap at Lucky Baldwin's, poured into a pint glass. Creamy nitro head as expected, jet black body. Mild roastiness in the nose, mild roastiness in the taste. Pretty thin body, but it definitely has more flavor that Guinness. Easy drinking overall, definitely could do a session of this when in the mood for a light stout."
"I know there are much better stouts out there. Ones that are lot more complex and interesting. But my goodness Murphy's is fun to drink. Nitro-can impressed me!"
"D- This is a decent stout at best. When I want a nitro-irish dry, I'll stick to beamish."
"A bit more creamy than some stouts, this beer does go down well but is a bit heavy."
"The best nitrogenated stout, I look forward to finding it on-tap again."
"i got this one off of a trade from a friend of mine. it pours a real dark thick black with a very nice creamy head that lasted all the way to the end of the glass with some pretty decent lacing, im guessing this is from the nitro can. the smell did not impress me too much, maybe some coffee, a little roastiness, and maybe a little chocolate malt. the taste was roasted malts and coffee with a little bit of a watery taste. it finished out real creamy and has that creamy finish most nitrogen conditioned stouts have. this beer is by all means nothing too special, reminds me of a upgraded guiness. but its pretty cheap and i was actually quite surprised, i had some low expectations for this beer but it turned out alright."
"I am not a fan of stouts, but enjoyed this one a lot."
"Pours an extremely dark brown with exciting caronation cascades (owing to the special draftflow you hear clinking in the can) and super creamy brown head that leaves perfect lace rings until the entire pint is gone. Chocolate and coffee ground aromas are extremely subdued. Taste is very good; I taste what I smelled with the addition of an earthy and roasty bitter finish. The body, however, is even more watery than Guinness. Beautiful to behold and good-tasting -- will buy this one again."
"D - Pretty good. Would consider downing another in the future."
"D: It's very easy to put several of these down in a sitting, lucky that ABV is kinda low! This is a great social beer, easy to sit back and relax with."
"Overall It's not too far behind Guinness. Pretty good for it's style though and fairly drinkable. Something I'd buy on-tap at a bar with no selection."
"D: This one is much better from the nitro can than Guinness. Still a subdued flavor profile, but it's tasty and extremely easy to drink. I get a craving for something like this once in awhile, and I'll keep Murphy's in mind next time that I do."
"D: It is certainly enjoyable, but nothing special. I could certainly drink a few."
"All in all, for what they are intended to be, they do a good job. People mark these beers down because they aren't an RIS. News flash, they're not trying to be. Appreciate them for what they are!"
"D- Yes. Multiple Murphy's wouldn't be difficult at all."
"Considering how smooth this is, and the lack of carbonation, this beer is very drinkable. I could see myself easily downing numerous of these in a single night."
"Still can't say I'm a fan of the Irish Dry Stout, but I'm trying. I think I'm just gonna have to get O'Hara's Celebration and if that doesn't do it, I'll have to conclude it's just a style I don't like."
"Overall - Not an especially exceptional stout by any means but definitely a sturdy one to session with or if you don't feel like spending more. I find Guinness to taste better but this is still a decent brew."
"D - Dry stouts are not my favorite stouts, and I love me some stouts. ok beer, not that complex to me"
"Smell like milk chocolate and tangy hops. Pours to a jet black with alight tan ultra fine bubble creamy head that stays put. Taste is roasted malt and good hop bitterness throughout. More bitter at the start then finishes a bit metallic at the end. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, kind of watery at the end, but then again it is only 4.00%. Again being only 4.00% for the flavor it is very drinkable. I could drink this stout in hot weather without a doubt."
"It's an ok beer, but for me it's nearly indistinguishable from Guinness. Not necessarily a bad thing by any means, but I see this as another good introductory stout."
"Final Thought: This blows Guinness out of the water on taste, a well-made Irish Stout!"
"A nice alternative to Guinness. Pours similar; dark brown with a cascading tan head and a creamy top. Aroma is stronger with more bittersweet chocolate. A little more bitter in the taste as well, which I liked. Bigger without being heavy. Goes great with Bushmills and Bailey's. Ka-boom!"
"D - Most definitely. Just went throug 3 of these during an evening at the in-laws. Had to escape some way."
"A very good dry stout. Richer and roastier than Guinness."
"Overall, a pretty decent Stout that's fairly easy to find in most places that sell beer."
"Murphy's is my least favorite of the 'Big 3' Irish Stouts, but there honestly isn't that much difference between them. I would NEVER turn one down, and I still pick up a 4 pack when I find it on sale."
"Comment I did a taste test between this and Beamish. A hard choice to pick one both are great beers. Beamish has a little less carbonation and is sweeter, more on the chocolate side and Murphy's is more carbonated and on the roasted coffee side. I recommend both highly."
"Very good Irish Dry Stout."
"This is my session beer. After four pints in two hours, I can still walk just fine."
"Overall, this is not the Murphy's I remember. What was a rich, hearty, full-flavored stout is just a bland, slightly flavored stout eerily reminiscent of Guinness Draught. I've drank quite a few of these (i.e., lots) and this pack is just...bland. I suspect I have got an old set of cans or perhaps my palate has changed and this is not as great as it once was. Either way, I'm let down. I've got 3 more to go through, so we shall see..."
"pours a completely black color with a big frothy head, just like guinness. i'm sure murphys is sick of hearing that but whatever. i poured it while it was too cold, so i can't promise this will be the most accurate review. Smell is of light caramel and maybe vanilla, no real hop flavors though. Taste if full and good, stouts are a different type of beer no doubt, a dry frothy mouthfeel accompanied by a molasses like soda thickness. stouts are good on certain times, cold nights like tonight they are great, i can't even fathom drinking this in the summer though."
"D: Heavens yes, highly drinkable. I have to say that I am not the biggest fan of the creamy stout but for what it is this is a quality brew."
"M/D: Medium to full bodied with good drinkability. Can't really go wrong with any of the 3 big Irish dry stouts, are all similar. But this one is the best."
"Pours a thick black with a creamy brownish white head that remaind during the drink. Aroma was oats with coffee and small tinges of alcohol. Taste was chocolate and coffee. Heavy texture, chewy but creamy. Light and crisp on the tongue. A good session beer but it is a little heavy. Very smooth and enjoyable."
"Nice waterfall action when you pour into a glass. Very dark black with a creamy tan head. The smell is malty and roasty. Taste leaves a chalky feel in the back of your mouth. The taste is not as good as a Guinness or Beamish. Also a little bit of tin flavor/smell. Definitely would have another of this Irish Stout."
"I love the appearance of these Irish stouts. Dark and creamy with a thick tan head. Smell not quite as appealing.. but evidence of dark roasted malt, chocolate, etc. Tastes similar. Creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Not overwhelming by any stretch and drinkable."
"Drinkability: Well I can never have many stouts at once, but that is just me. I can tackle a couple though. These are good"
"D - likely to show in my fridge to be introduced to my beer drinking buddies as a possible staple of Irish Stouts."
"I'm ""hopped out"" from Hop 15 yesterday, so I'll choose to visit a session favorite of mine. Black body with a creamy tan head, very attractive to me. The nose is milky, some faint roasted coffee. Love the astringency in the nose as well. Somewhat sweet (banana-like) and very easy in the mouth, no rough flavors to be found here. Get's a little coffeeish later on in the experiance. Another yum yum experience provided by Murphy's Irish Stout."
"D - This is an easy drinking stout. You can easiy have a couple of these in a night."
"Drinkability: Very Very nice. Could drink a few of these."
"The flavor and aroma profiles didn't quite blow me away here but man does thing stuff drink like a champ! A tasty and extremely easy drinking Irish Stout. Decent stuff!"
"Loved it."
"Beats Guinness in my book."
"taste is a creamy bakers and milk chocolate, roasted coffee, some sour malt, slight metallic on the first swallow which goes away, nice dry ending with some lingering bitterness."
"Notes: This stout has a big smooth and creamy character from the nitro system and a maltier flavor than some other nitro stouts that I have tried."
"MF&D - Creamy and easy drinking. The onlt drawback is it is a little thinner that Beamish or Guninness, but you still can't go wrong with this Irish classic."
"Sampled from the widget nitro can. Pours a black color with a very thick creamy tan head. Nice foamy lacing left on the glass. There's a ton of coffee and malty flavor in this beer. Creamy and very smooth. I would get this again. Pretty easy drinking."
"D-Not horrible, but I notice the lactic more and more when I drink these stouts."
"The widget cans are brilliant and whoever came up with them should get a straight into heaven card. Serious cappuccino-colored head. Opaque black. Settles beautifully in the cascading style as an Irish Stout should. Aromas are strongly chocolate and toasted malt. The flavors are very rich and smoky. Chocolate again, and the malt character is hearty like roast beef (that roasted thing again). Unbelievable lacing (clings all the way down the glass leaving a curtain of tan bubbles!) Surprisingly light mouthfeel for a beer this dark. Very light carbonation and quite quaffable."
"A very easy to drink beer that feels good to the mouth. One area where Murphy's stout really shines through is the drinkability. At 4% and so silky smooth I could drink this brew all night long."
"Surprisingly, Murphy's came out on top, due to it's extra creaminess. Beamish fell in the middle with Guinness not far behind with a more ""sour"" flavor. The five of us agreed Murphy's was the best, but there was some differences of opinion over Beamish and Guiness. When wanting a dark non-heavy stout any of the Irish stouts will quench that thirst, but when there is a choice I will always reach for a Murphy's."
"Murphy's is a bit tougher to find than Guinness. I think it's even harder to find on tap than Guinness. As a result, I'll pick up a Guinness in place of its subtler rival, but given the option, I think I'd reach for Murphy's."
"Nice clean taste to it nothing to strong nothing to intense just a great all around Stout."
"D: The low ABV and great characteristics of this beer made it highly sessionable for me."
"Pretty basic dry stout here no surprises. Pours an extremely dark color with ample head. Smooth taste very easy to drink and has always been enjoyable for me. Nothing significant with this one although I do prefer the taste of Murphy's over Guinness."
"Extremely drinkable and a kick to enjoy out of the kitschy nitro-can, which really does make Murphy's look good!"
"wow, 522 reviews as of this writing. I have had this plenty of times but only now thought I should post a review. I had this in boston at a cigar bar. it was off hours and just my friends and I lounging. Round 1 beer, round 2 beer and a cigar. I thoroughly enjoyed the pairing and will happily have this beer many times in the future. Definetly worth a try."
"After being impressed by Murphy's Red I thought I would give the stout a try. The beer pours great, looks great, smells great...but after the exterior judging it falls apart. Perhaps it just doesn't match my taste buds. I felt like it was a really watered down beer. It was, I will admit, refreshing but I prefer something with a little more substance. I would love to taste a Murphy's Extra Stout if they have one."
"This beer obviously pours a very dark brown/black color and has a light tan to off-white head. It smells of roasted malts, and tastes like Guinness without the sourness. It is a great example of a standard Irish stout. The mouthfeel would be better if it was nitro, however it has a nice low carbonation, making it easy to drink. I would seek this out on tap, but I don't know if it would be worth going out of your way for in the bottle."
"Extremely drinkable."
"overall, this is a good brew and i can see myself getting it again"
"Pours a thick, rich black, as the head begins to foam to the top. A spoonable layer of head forms, and is retained for quite some time afterward. The body is medium, and the taste is dry throughout with subtle hints of caramel or roasted chocolate. This Stout finishes with a subtle coffee aftertaste, quite like sucking on an actual roasted coffee bean, which I used to do to pass the time while working the Coffee aisle at Shaw's."
"I really don't know where all the good ratings of this beer are coming from. It was hard for me to get through the can, which I ended up not finishing. The flavors were quite bland or muted by the dryness of the finish. Overall I don't really like the nitro-capsule effect. I would go for a guinness extra stout over the draught bottle any day. While some might posit that the flavors in guinness are made subtle by its creamy mouthfeel, I find it much more enjoyable than murphys. I guess I'll have to try it on tap or in a bottle to see if this beer has the potential that others claim it to have."
"One of the best imported stouts available in draught nitro can."
"Beautiful rich black appearance with a thick foamy head that sticks to the side of the glass. Sweet coffee and roasted malt aroma. Bittersweet milky flavor with hints of coffee, chocolate, and nicely toasted malts. has the consistancy of a thin milkshake. Low carbonation, as it should be. Easy to drink. Very good."
"D = A very drinkable light-bodied stout."
"D - good but heavy."
"Talk about being all over the board. It looks enticing, feels seductive, and tastes and smells like a good stout but nothing that would make you scream and shout for more. And yet, as it slides down, it becomes more and more effortless to take the next sip. So while it's not exactly consistent, it ends up leaving a positive impression that means I'll never refuse one of these. In fact, I might just have to keep a four-pack on hand for those light-beer kind of evenings."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Low alcohol and simple but pleasing flavors make consumption pretty easy."
"Got this on tap at a pub by the same name. Deep brown almost black with excellent lush one finger head that was tan in the room lighting. Smell of roasted malts. Taste is the same, bit of a powdery feel and a dry finish. Great drinkability. This is what you'd expect from a dry Irish stout and I think I prefer it to the industry standard. I'll buy this again."
"D: Drinkability was pretty bland, and ordinary, sorry to say."
"d: I like this one quite a bit, but I prefer Beamish."
"D - It would probably be pretty easy to down a few of these, but my question is why? It's not a bad beer but at the end of it all I feel it's fairly one dimensional, not a good feeling about a stout. Nitro-cans are nice gadgets, but with fuller bodied beers like this I think they really mask a lot of otherwise interesting nuance. Is it Murphy's or just the can? I may never know."
"I was served a Murphy's with a two-finger beige head. It was dark brown, almost black in appearance. There's a scalded coffee ground smell to it. The taste is strong, and somewhat bitter. Mouthfeel is thick. This beer goes down easy. Highly drinkable and very close to Guinness Stout."
"The taste is similar, toast, chocolate, coffee, rather dry, with pretty good sweet-bitter balance, but on a fairly thin, watery body."
"D: A notch above Guinness in my book. Can pour back a few of these quite easily, with almost no consequences."
"A finger's worth of beautiful, deep-tan head was created on the pour. The cascade resulted in a dark-brown beer with ruby highlights. The nose was slightly smoky, highly appropriate for a dry stout. The mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a great smoky bitterness that lingered on and on. The finish was equally satisfying. Lovely, this."
"May have served it a bit warm, but flavorful for a Dry Irish Stout. Low alcohol, and not overpowering in any flavor sense, this beer would be easily sessionable."
"Overall, it's my favourite stout. Far exceeds it's more dominant (and bitter) cousin Guinness, and in my opinion leagues ahead of Beamish as well. Phenominal brew that really has to be sampled on tap back in the old country to be truly appreciated!"
"D - This is the perfect session stout it has a good taste and a lower abv so you can drink it all night at an Irish bar and still be able to play some darts"
"Really nice stout."
"Certainly drinkable and enjoyable, but there are definitely better stouts out there."
"single nitro-can from Trader Joe's Cary"
"The mouthfeel was typical of this style with a thick creamy, chewy feel. It coated the mouth well leaving behind a slight bitter aftertaste. Good example of this style, probably third on the big three list behind Beamish and Guinness. Fairly common so not a big find but definitely worth trying if you haven't had it."
"D- this is a pub pounder fo-sho. well rounded stout. (guinness+5)"
"The beer poured beautifully with a big silky head. The smell and taste, however, are fairly average with a touch of roasted malt and coffee. I like Murphy's because it's cheaper than Guinness and you get a full pint. But, I feel that Guinness is just slightly better."
"D- Easy drinking, nice low ABV. Great after a meal in place of coffee, or as your dinner beverage. Goes great with left over corned beef and cabbage."
"This was awesome. It definitely appeared lighter than a Guinness, but it was as wonderful to watch. Slight amber coloring around the dark black appearance differentiated it from Guinness, but it also had a light brown, almost frappe-like, thick head. The aromas of mocha and coffee were the strongest that I sensed. It was wicked sweet, almost dessert-like, filled with chocolate and coffee flavors. The mouthfeel was great: thick, frappe-like but very light. Overall, a great rival to Guinness."
"Served Nitro Tap. Poured a black with a thin head once it settled and was served to me. The beer laced the glass most of the way down. The aroma was of deep roasted malts, some chocolate, and some coffee. The taste was nice with a deep roasted malt base followed by the hints of chocolate and coffee probably from the malts used. The mouthfeel was extremely creamy since it was a nitro tap but I think it could have used a little bit more carbonation. It was a drinkable beer and I could go for another. Perhaps I would like it more out of the bottle."
"M/D: Medium to full bodied with good drinkability. Can't really go wrong with any of the 3 big Irish dry stouts, are all similar. I would put this one slightly ahead of Guinness, but below Beamish."
"I don't think I like Irish Dry Stouts, or I just don't like the nitro-effect. There is no depth and the few that I have tried are watery. This one is no different."
"Drinkability: Immensely drinkable. I have been going through four Irish Dry Stouts and I barely feel it. The style lends itself to low ABV (this one only 4%) which makes this a perfect session beer IMO. Light yet tasty."
"Has a thin body with a creamy mouthfeel from the nitro. I couldn't imagine drinking this beer without a nitro-charge. It wouldn't be very good. Although the ABV is low and you won't get filled up drinking this beer, I didn't rate drinkability very high because of the expense of a 4-pack."
"I am pleasantly surprised with this beer; it is quite similar to Guinness but has a smoother finish...I'm glad I broke with tradition. Hope my Irish lady approves."
"Murphy's is a good stout, great drinkability and taste, but it's not quite the same as a Guinness. More flavor, it seems, but the draughtflow isn't the same experience. On par in some departments, but not as good in others."
"Mouthfeel is about what you'd expect from a can with a nitro widget inside: flat and creamy. There's about as much carbonation here as there is in coffee, although the texture is quite silky. This is the perfect beer to throw into a carbomb and not even taste anything."
"D: Perfectly sessionable, the type of ale one could sip pint after pint of at the pub. It's subtlety in an era where plenty of beers aim for big alcohol, huge flavors and 'extreme'-ness. Glad I picked this one off the 'St. Patrick's Day' display at New Seasons; will have to mix it into the beer line-up more often."
"D - pretty easy. I wish I had a peat burning fire place to watch the flames flicker as I enjoy this one. A real good stout and I wouldn't mind having another."
"My second stout of the night at Porter Bellys in Brighton Center was a Murphy's. I wanted to have it right after a Guinness to compare. Pours with a dark amber color, almost black. The first sip revealed a head that was so thick that my lips made an impression in the foam. This had a bit of substance to it. Taste was good, with chocolate and coffee flavors on the palette. There was a lot more bitterness that I noticed in a Guinness, which caught my attention. Seemed to fit the style of a dry stout a bit better. When I am looking for a stout and they have Murphy's on tap, it's an easy choice over a Guinness."
"Appearance black whith one finger thick tan head with fome that stuck to sides of glass the whole way down. Smell chocolate and coffee. Taste same as smell with nice roasted notes and maby a hint of smoke which could be frome the roasted grains. Mouthfeel light carbonation very creamey mouthfeel. Drinkability one of my favorate Irish Stouts."
"Easy to drink, but nothing really memorable about it."
"The beer is black with a nice creamy cap of dense foam that lasts until the end. The aroma is earthy, dark roasted malt and bitter hops. The beer is light on the palate and has the bite of espresso. A slightly dry bitterness is present throughout and follows through to the finish. A nice drinkable beer. A very good well rounded Irish stout."
"D: Pretty darn drinkable, a much better alternative to other Irish Stouts. All in all a good stout and nice change of pace."
"Not especially thrilling."
"This is a pretty drinkable brew, but there are better stouts out there."
"D: A one."
"Very light in body and very quaffable @ 4.0 ABV."
"D-one of the most drinkable stouts I have ever enjoyed"
"Drinkability is great for stout. It is nice and smooth, but light enough to drink all day long."
"A nice alternative to Guiness, only not as good overall. It has a nice dark color with an off white foamy head. It is creamy with the aroma and flavor of burnt coffee. The mouthfeel is somewhat creamy and this is a beer I could drink again, although I do prefer Guinness."
"Arrived in a regular pint glass (still haven't found a pub that has those nonic tumbler (the ones with the bump)) and had that frothy, creamy head that left lacing sheets as I drank the beer. The smell is malty with maybe some coffee malt sticking out. The taste is rather plain, with some coffee and possibly a roasted malt sticking out there, but it is so smooth and full bodied. It goes down like milk and there is absolutely no bitterness - you can just pound this stuff. I have no problem ordering this on draft and staying with it. Don't know why it gets knocked, it is pretty cheap to buy not because it sucks but because Murphy's doesn't have to rip off its drinkers to pay for silly commercials (you know who I mean)."
"D: It is a drinkable beer but would be hard for me to drink many of these. I really am not a fan of mushrooms and so I was not a fan of the smell at all."
"Overall, I love Murphy's. A great example of a stout. A great Guinness alternative for those of us who can't get the real stuff from Ireland. When comparing Murphy's head to head w/ a nitro-can Guinness, Murphy's wins. A true session beer."
"To date, this is my favorite nitro-can stout, more flavorful than the Guinness standard."
"From a can, this was dark brown with tan head and good lacing. Nose of roasted malts and chocolate. Rich mouthfeel. Roasted malts dominate and the finish is dry. This was drinkable, and tasted quite good considering it came from a can. I would buy this again."
"Overall, a very worthy Irish stout that it would be easy to drink gallons of, if one was so inclined."
"D: Goes down almost too smooth. Good thing it's only 4%. Easily sessionable."
"Poured a Nitro-can into a pint glass, pours a pitch black with that nitrous head that we all enjoy, I enjoy watching the head flow through the glass once poured, awesome looking. Smell is almost non existant to me, I can't really smell to much of anything. Taste is a bit of a smooth creamy bitterness, it goes it a bit thick but very easy to drink, I can taste a bit of malt and roasted barley in there, I have been on a irish stout kick as of lately and this is just another fine offering."
"Drinkablity: One of my favorite canned stouts. Any port in a storm, a classic."
"There are tastier stouts out there, and for the price of four cans of Murphy's I would be tempted to go find them."
"Not very drinkable. It sat there on my desk for quite a while until it was finished. I just did not have a strong desire to pickup and drink such a tasteless brew."
"Mouthfeel and drinkablitly are great. It's got a real smooth filling texture and goes done great. Give this stuff a try sometime."
"Bought a duo intro can in the duty free liquor store at the airport departure and had my first one in the Hotel after lunch and before a short comfy nap. The pour yielded a quick receding one inch head that tops the jet black stout below. The smell was primarily roasted malts and coffee. Taste was typically roasted malts with a slight lactic touch and coffee towards the finish; not something out of the world; rather typical but no flaws either. Bitterness at the finish was well within tolerance. Generally light tasting for the stouts that I have tried. The after taste was again primarily roasted malts and coffee; again nothing out of the blue. The mouth feel on this one was medium to full; thickness partly due to the expected creaminess which was good. I was expecting more creaminess though, due to the nitro. Creamy smooth drinking and definitely one of the more drinkable stouts around. Not bad but I am not really a fan of this one; I am sure many folks can make a good session out of this one though."
"Drinkability- One of the better irish stouts Ive had, give it a try."
"a wonderful brew, I would say the creme of the crop along side Beamish. it pours nice and opaque, with a perfect white head, smells like any good pub in cork, or kerry. the taste is wonderful, light enough without being wimpy, and full of flavor. the mouth-feel is crisp and smooth, and it is so drinkable it is easy to find yourself asking where the 4 pack went. if you see this in the store pick it up, for certain."
"Throw your oatmeal away! Murphys pours and is truly alive inside as you watch the bubbles ""rain up"" the glass. a cool visual experience. black as oil and a head like pudding. thick and creamy, yet increadibly smooth. a wonderful irish stout. dry and frothy dark malty taste with hints of coffee or dark chocolate. truly a staple of an irishmans diet. so drinkable you wont even realize your drunk until youve soiled your trousers in the wagon!"
"I really like this beer out of can better than draft. Maybe something was wrong with the draft line, because it was very watery and didn't form the thick head of foam that I was expecting.The can was much better. the pour from the can to the glass was similar to Guinness. I noticed a semi-sweet taste from the first sip. Good head retention throughout the whole pint, but I don't think it beats Guinness head to head."
"it even tastes like the can"
"Pours black with a nice big head. Typical nitro stout look. Aroma is dark roasted malt with hint of underlying sweetness. Taste is mild burnt malt. Very mild bitterness from the malt balances by mild sweetness. Overall the taste is very mild and very balanced. Creamy with a dry finish. Very drinkable. Overall this is a very solid stout. Nice beer overall."
"M&D: the texture is much much ""lighter"" than what the word ""smooth"" can possibly suggest to its best intent... or, it's just watery, full stop. And, despite the creamy-soft facade imposed by nitro-gas, the body is just thin, thin, thin! In addition, there's little taste left in this cold, watered-down coffee, so I personally find this canned beer a total waste of money, even at 74p!"
"D: A easy drinking beer for a night at the pub, or a session at home while watching the game, Murphy's is a beer that is dangerously drinkable, low in alcohol, I could drink a lot of this."
"A very dark, nearly opaque brown with a caramelly-brown foamy head, reminiscent of cappuccino, that filled the glass to the brim. The cap is very nice and long lasting, leaving huge sheeting as it descends. A coffee malty aroma dominates with undertones of cocoa. No hops or fruity aromas. The taste is strongly of the same rich maltiness, with almost no hops flavor or bitters to interrupt. The finish is dry and roasty. Tiny banana flavor at times. Medium-low mouthfeel and low carbonation. Very drinkable, light and low alcohol. Not complex flavors, but rich and tasty."
"D- Extremely drinkable very light for a stout. Gould easily drink the whole 4 pack"
"D- Sessionable dry stout, low ABV and tastes good."
"d: definitely better than a certain irish stout whose name rhymes with puiness; the balance of the creamy mouth-feel with the simple flavors is quite enjoyable; a great stout that i could down a few pints of"
"Murphys seems to me to be a slightly weaker version of Guinness (weaker in both smell and taste). It is still a really good beer though."
"Drinkability : Excellent stout, encore meilleur à la pression ou à consommer chez soi en version cannette (N2)"
"Got the nitro dingy thingy in the can but this makes a foam of the smallest microscopic bubbles... like on a malted milk shake.... Bravo Mr. Murphy, Bravo!"
"D: It as short on body and flavor. I doubt this will be a stout I will sample again.."
"Appearance of this beer was good. Dark brown, with a very creamy head. Smell was faint, chocolate and hops. Good balance of flavors. Slightly sweet entry, then followed by bitter dry taste. Mouthfeel was very creamy. Drinkability is good. Its not too light, not to rich. Could be session beer. Overall I liked this stout, not as much as Beamish for Irish stout, but better then Guinness in my opinion."
"Murphys is very much like Guinness, but less. Its slightly thinner than Guinness is, and I think a tiny bit less bitter. There is still that coffee aroma, but slightly less so. Its a very dark beer, but a tiny bit less dark than Guinness is. Murphys has a creamy, smooth, long-lasting head, but less so than Guinness. The flavor is not overly complex, and has ""smoky"" and coffee-like hints of taste mixed into a somewhat watery ""base."" The flavor seems to just attack the front of the tongue, and finishes cleanly and smoothly. The end result is a very ""drinkable"" brew that quenches that thirst and tastes pleasant through and through."
"(Oh yeah, nice watching the sinking bubbles.)"
"After cascade, settled with a nice 1 to 2 finger creamy whitish-tan head. Appears black, but dark ruby color shows itself in the light. Smell is smokey, slightly roasted and ....meaty? Taste resembles smell, but with some chocolate notes as well. Slight hop bitterness. Very drinkable."
"D- Could drink these all night and not get full or too tanked. Just not interested with so many other great beers out there."
"Unfotunately I know my recent experience with Murph's on tap at a local bar here in Waterbury, CT cannot do justice to this proven fine stout. I had it many years ago in Ireland where it tasted considerably smoother and meatier than it does here. And I've had it in the cans recently as well. This one poured nicely with dark brown/black appearance and a sturdy full tan head with great longlasting lace. The smell curiously came in as a grapefruit and malt combination, just a hint of chocolate perhaps. The first taste struck me as much thinner than one usually expects from a stout. It has a tingly carbonation and the taste brings up tart cherries and a smokey background. There are some bready qualities as well, but I struggled to detect much in the way of malt or coffee as I recall from my experience on the Emerald Isle. It is somewhat watery in this sample but it remains drinkable enough. Even in this condition I would say this is an interesting stout option that should be sampled by any dark beer lover. Hopefully you will find a more representative sample than mine. I will say that when I had it in Ireland, it easily rivaled the Guinness. Different but similarly delicious. I'll have to look for other sources and hope for a review upgrade. Cheers!"
"I had this at Celtic Mist a new irish pub in Springfield,IL. I have had this before but never on tap.Let me tell you a tale...of one of thee most fantastic beers I have ever had.As the native irish bartender poured me a pint,I lavished as the head formed.It took about 5 mins. before i would even take the first drink as the head needed to settle properly.The smell is fantastic,dark rich malty character with a smooth creamy head.And the taste is something to talk about,smooth as it glides on the tounge,a perfect balanced stout.This beer is so drinkable, I love it!! No one in their right mind would turn their nose up at this one."
"D: Very drinkable. I actually find this more drinkable than Guinness. Good show from Murphy's!"
"D - it's ok, but I'll have Guinness on St. Patty's Day"
"A very tasty stout. This used to be my favorite Irish stout. Not quite as crazy about it as I used to be, though I'm not sure if the beer has changed or I have. Still quite yummy, though, and if I don't watch myself I can gulp these down faster than is good for me."
"Beer was so heavy, cannot drink a lot of it"
"Murphy's makes an excellent stout. It has a wonderful color, deep black and almost completely opaque. The head is tan and creamy and looks like a roiling boil as it's poured into a glass (and ends up leaving great lacing). It's aroma is great, a nice coffee scent to it. The only down side is that it's a little thinner than other comparable stouts. It still tastes great, just not quite as good as its more popular cousin from Ireland. I recommend you try it to see what you think yourself, and if this was the only stout at the bar I'd still be happy. It's just not the first stout I'd order."
"Overall, it goes down a lot like Guinness with a nitro can. I have a friend who swears by this stuff, so I'll probably give him the rest of my 4-pack. I can see how it might be enjoyable to some, I guess, but it's not for me."
"Not recommended unless a last resort amid a bunch of BMC taps."
"In all honest, this is a pretty weak stout. It is very easy to drink with not a lot of flavor to back it up. Guinness has it beat pretty easily. Don't get me wrong, it isn't a bad beer but if there are other options available, take 'em. It's worth it to atleast give it a try once."
"Just a note of interest about this beer: According to my friend who has ties to Ireland, Murphys is often considered the Irish Dry Stout for Catholic consumers, whereas Guinness is more popular with a Protestant audience."
"not as thick as the original Guiness, and at 4% ABV also relatively ""light"" this is a very easy to drink stout, nevertheless of some sophistication and excellent balance ... it also accompanies food very well .... excellent with seafood, especially any crustaceans"
"Pours a nearly black color with a brown, creamy head. Aroma smells roasty, almost like coffee with some faint hints of chocolate. Taste is much of the same except that the roastiness is more pronounced on the tongue. Rich and creamy and also somewhat thin by a bit. Still a damn good example of the style that I've had. There's a bit of dryness/bitterness leftover on the tongue but nothing offensive at all. This is what a simple dry stout should aim to be."
"Edit: Having enjoyed more of the drink(Alright...a 2nd one) I wanted to re-review the drink. The drinks dry flavour blends in a little more w/ the creamyness as you drink more making it a more enjoyable drink. Worth a shot to anyone interested"
"Not one I'd reach for often, as I don't dig the mouthfeel on these sorts of beers. Damn it, I've tried. There are better stouts out there, but the two remaining cans won't go unappreciated."
"D- An easy to drink beer, it's biggest downfall is that it is filling."
"Overall, exactly what I expected. Low on robust flavors, it's quite anticlimactic. I went in looking for good, but I'm really just not a fan of the style."
"D - A near perfect session candidate IMO. I like this better than the other two of the ""big three"" Irish stouts available in pub-draught cans, but it's not really that much different...I could tell this apart from Guinness in a blind taste test, but I don't know if I could distinguish it from Beamish. It's a bit more chocolaty than the other two."
"Had the pleasure of trying this in a pub with live irish music in the background, and I can't say I'm dissapointed. Appearance is dark dark brown, almost black, with a tan colored head that sticks around throughout the night. Smell is as can be expected of a stout, cocoa, coffee, just hints of toffee, and a dark roasted malty aroma. Taste is just rich enough to be really enjoyable without being overpowering. More of the same there, with the cocoa taking a front seat, the roasted malt flavor coming out more and the hints of coffee flowing in at the end. Mouthfeel is amazing, rich and creamy...almost like a smoothie in texture. Drinkability is good, but personally the sheer richness of it hurts it just a little. I'll definitely be having more of these in the future."
"Aroma is of roasted malt, chocolate and caramel. Taste is more of the same with some nice, but not over powering bitterness from the roasted malt. Nothing to special. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy but carbonation lacks a bit, as one would expect from a nitro. I prefer more carbonation. 4% abv adds to the drinkability. A more flavorful Guinness. Nothing too special here but a solid brew."
"D - Eh, the flavor or lack thereof makes it one someone could probably session. That wierd flavor keeps me from wanting more."
"Pours that gorgeous nitro infused mix of caramel cappucino and finishing into a fairly dark color stout (closer to a brown, borderline porter). Massive dense head is poured, pretty requisite to style. Aroma is pretty mute: whiffs of roasted grain, some creamy milk chocolate, a bit of floral hops, and finally some bitter black patent. On the palate, it is a luxurious smoothness of a light Irish stout, very dry with the creamy chocolate flavors coming first, a little astringency in the mid palate and finishing with a long sustain of black patent bitterness. Mouthfeel is spot on, low carbonation, medium body with a nicely textured head. Overall, these are the stouts for summer drinking. I spotted some Shakespeare and Yeti and decided when it's 80 plus out, this is a better option."
"Drinkability: I'll have a couple of these if I must.... but I prefer a thicker, more robust stout. It's better than the Guinness in my opinion though... only slightly."
"The best quality of this selection is the creamy velvet head. Albeit a small part of the experience, it does count for something. My final judgment is that it is lacking."
"Overall a very easy to drink stout. A touch sweeter than Guinness in my opinion."
"Well, this beer is easy to drink, that's for sure. The flavor is a bit watered down, but what's there is a solid Irish stout. Roasted nuts, slightly chocolaty, and just a touch bitter. Overall decent. Mouthfeel is medium, and the finish is smooth. This is just an easy drinkin' stout to be sure, but it's not going to set anyone's world on fire."
"This is an excellent pub brew. I would have to have some more of this to make a fair judgment, but as of now I think I would take this one over Guinness."
"On a more positive note, the head on this brew is phenomenal. Dense and cream colored. It takes some time to develop, and is quite resilient."
"Deep dark black and opague with a cappacino coloured head. Not much smell to speak of. Slightly roasted malt. Taste is very good. Bracingly bitter from the roasted malts upon first sip followed by an extremely smooth aftertaste. I think this is slightly better than guiness taste wise. A decent overall dry stout but I have had better. Mouthfeel is creamy at first but then slightly thin at the end. Could be better."
"The mouth is light and simple, with perfect smoothness. Again, simple wins here. A fine beer that I'm happy to review again with some more experience. One of my favorite Irish stouts."
"A pretty good Irish Stout. The beer looked great out of the nitro can and the cascading effect was nice to see. The smell was slightly grainy with a bit of sourness in there as well. The taste was all dark malts with a slight bit of smokiness in the very dry finish. The creamy mouthfeel was great though and really added to my enjoyment of the brew. The finish was quite bitter though, a little too dry. Due to the low ABV of this beer, it would be a good session brew for stout fans, so I'd recommend trying it for yourself for sure."
"poured a dark chocolate in color with a creamy head that stuck around awhile. Smell is sweet with roasted malts and dark chocolate. Dissapointed by the taste though, it has a roasted malt and coffee flavor with bitter chocolate and has a creamy mouthfeel, but lacked the body needed in a stout."
"Overall, I'll drink this in the pub no problem, especially if it is priced right. But for home purchase, there are a couple that would be a little more worth the money."
"D - Overall a very drinkable english/irish-style stout. Mouthfeel and smell are thin, taste is slightly better."
"Dark brown-black with a creamy off-white nitro-head that laces like Guiness. Aroma of coffee, burnt toast, roasted barley. Taste was lots of roasted barley and hints of chocolate and coffee. Mouthfeel was quite smooth and creamy. An above average and very drinkable stout."
"This one poured with a nice, thick, creamy, fine, tan head. Some lace too. Aroma is mainly chocolatey with some roasty, malty, and slightly beery character. Flavor's about the same, but not all that dry despite its label. Of course it's creamy, but also a bit watery too. Very short easy finish. Very easy drinking; a stout for people who really don't want a pow stout. Perhaps almost a porter in some regards."
"A bit too light to be great, but the ABV is low, the calories are low and I think it's probably a little tastier than that other Dry Irish Stout. I could see an occasional craving for this stuff coming about."
"Drinkability- This one's not as filling as most stouts. I notice that I downed a pint pretty speedily and easily. I could definitely drink ten of these. A good stout to get drunk off of."
"For a beer poured from a can, within the comforts of my own home, this is by far the best I think I can get. It's head was outstanding, and its flavor terrific. I served it up very cold (like I personally enjoy) and it went down so smooth. Yum! The 4-pack didn't last very long, however. I'd like to see this beer come in a bottle, however."
"Drinkability: I had this one sitting ont he patio at a local Irish bar and it certainly hit the spot. Guinness may be the ubiquitious irish stout, but this one is much better."
"My favorite Irish stout, and go to stout whenever I can get it."
"A generally nice beer, though some of the flavors aren't to my typical liking. I believe that many aspects of this beer suffer from the nitro-can -- it's probably much better in it's natural state. Generally common in the can and worth trying, though I don't really anticipate getting this again."
"D: In the past, I was more of a champion for Murphy's in the Irish Dry Stout category, but now I'm not so sure. The flavors didn't seem as robust as they once did. I'll have to give this one another try though, because I'd hate to see a fairly reliable stout go down the tubes."
"16 oz. can - color of dark black , with a two toned head after pour gray , and frothy tan settles with heavy long lasting tan head - nose of milk chocolate , malty , and anise  taste of milk chocolate , malty , milky , and bitter chocolate - body is creamy , smooth , and slight bitterness  aftertaste of maltyness , slight bitterness , and milk chocolate"
"Taste and mouthfeel: Great I love it! creamy and smooth the way of the true beer as I call it the only reason I didn't give it fives was the lack of it's other flavours but that it being a stout it should'nt have all that pizazz but it ranks high among classic brews and after all who likes to drink a few GREAT beers and be wasted? not I."
"Drinkability: Great. I could drink this often. With the girly 4% ABV this makes for a pretty good session beer. Also make a great black and tan."
"Drinkability - Not the same as a Guiness.You should try both and compare them. Very similar,but diffrent."
"Taste is slightly burned in a mild way with some faint oily notes. Some stock or meaty notes from the yeast. The yeast gives a little fruitiness. All very mild and very digestable, but nothing too exciting. Yesterday I had the 3F Black Sun, which also was not very much my taste. So this is probably my taste that is different."
"Murphy's Irish Stout is definately a quality brew. One that I have passed on far too many times. I picked some up for St. Patty's Day and I'm glad I did. A nice treat."
"Served with a rich dense cappuccino head that was lasting and left glorious lacing on the glass. The aroma was dominated by roasted barley. Taste was good and typical of an authentic Irish dry stout. The beer was good and refreshing for one that dry. While I prefer a good American stout, it's good to catch up with the origins of the style once and a while."
"Had on tap, thought I might as well review it. Looks pretty good, nice dark black/brown with a two-finger brown head that lingers. Smell is straight forward malts and chocolate. Taste follows suit, with mild but nice roasty malts. Mouthfeel is slightly thin but not bad. Drinkability is very high on this one, especially with the low ABV. A great session beer."
"This is a classic for me. One of the first beers I had that I couldnt see through. Love the look, almost completely black with a large, light tan, creamy head with great retention. Lots of sticky lace. The smell is mild and roasty. Chocolate, coffee aromas are most prominent in the nose, but not very loud at all. In fact the nose in pretty tame, and the taste follows suit, being a bit watery after a while. But still the creamy mouthfeel is wonderful. I could drink this stuff all night! Dark and flavorful, but not heavcy and cloying. Yep, still a classic to me."
"Not quite as black as guiness, doesn't lace like it either. One finger of malted milkball, nitro head. Soft smells of milk, chocolate, roasty grain. This is a creamy brew with herbal hop flavor upfront, roasted grain characters that are both fuller and softer than those of its cousins. Light sweetness comes out at the back. Has none of the metallic flavors of Guiness. I know this kind of like splitting hairs between BMC, but I think I favor this over Guiness or Beamish. It is really smooth and creamy and just more drinkable. Aftertaste really straddles coffee and chocolate. It is very light, and hard to decide which it is. In the mouthfeel dept. this is very light for stout, and silky-smooth."
"Maybe I'm just old-fashoned."
"D - No thank you. I tried it now on to something else."
"I poured it into a clean glass. It had a dark body but a thin head which surprised me. It had a slight malty smell, but had what I thought was a stale odor. The taste was bland with not much malt or any real flavor which really surprised me. The feel was watery and average and the overall drinkability quite boring. I don't think I'll drink it again."
"Irish dry stouts are the ""in"" thing this time of year but out of the big three; Beamish, Guiness and Murphy's I would choose Beamish hands down."
"D - For a stout, fairly drinkable; the taste is so good that I'd go back for two or three"
"Drinkability: It's easy to slam a pint, but it's not so exciting to savor the bland flavor."
"With the foul aftertaste lingering in my palate, its hard to say much nice about its drinkability."
"Pours dark as night, with a creamy tan coloured nitro head. Good retention. Extremely creamy mouthfeel, light and fluffy. Has a touch of roastiness and chocolate, but not much flavour overall. Very easy to drink and I much prefer this over Guinness at any irish pub."
"I'm very new to reviewing the characteristics of beer and I'm very new to beer in general. This Irish Stout is a beer that I will likely keep on hand for a long time to come and I would recommend it for anyone interested in a stout."
"Drinkability- this was a very drinkable brew and again without trashing Guinness the Murphy's had more flavor and a thicker feel while being highly drinkable. My personal favorite is Beamish but this is a very satisfying Irish stout."
"D: I didn’t find it to be very tasty, but it goes down easily, a little bit filling. I’ve tried this beer a couple of times at tastings and didn’t like it. I decided to give it a fair shot by trying it on-tap. It tasted somewhat better but I still don’t like it very much."
"It doesnt get any better than this! Guinness is good, but I'll take this over Guinness any day. Poured into a pint glass, this beer pours a very dark brown, almost black, forming a creamy 1 inch head. The aroma is of milk chocolate and roasted malt. The taste is fantastic! Sweet, slight chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt. The mouthfeel is a bit thin for a stout, but is still enjoyable. Overall, this is a great stout, and a very easy session beer. This is easily one of my favorite stouts available on the market in this area."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a dark brown/black color with a good sized creamy off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells like coffee and roasted malt. It tastes like roasted malt, bitter chocolate, smoke and coffee. There's a slight bitter aftertaste, but it's not strong at all. Mouthfeel is good and creamy, and a bit dry. The drinkability is good, it's very smooth, and with the low ABV it's a decent session beer. This is a pretty decent brew, I'd recommend it to anyone who likes this style of beer."
"This stout is one of my favorites and it pours well with a dark near-black brown and light tan head, sharing a smilar bubbling effect as many other stouts. The aroma is of dark roasted grains, coffee and a bit of baking chocolate. The tasted is rich, coffee, chocolate and a hint of smokiness -- all quite pleasing. It's a bit thinner, but nicely creamy. Very easy to drink, and isn't too heavy in the long run."
"The taste has some nice roastiness to it with a touch of sweetness. The finish has a semi bitter taste to it that is quite pleasant. Good sessionable Irish Dry Stout and I like it a lot...I could drink it all day. ;^)"
"This is an easy enough drinker. I like it better on tap, but the canned version is nice for home consumption."
"Just needs some more character to hold your interest. This is better on draft by miles. But this will work in pinch"
"Murphy's Irish Stout is very smooth, much smoother than Guinness is. I enjoyed watching the beer settle after pouring into my pint glass. Murphy's has a rich taste, which has hint of molasses and coffee to it. Another great beer to have with a meal. I find that Murphy's suits me very well."
"Cheers!"
"Nitro cascade is a thing of beauty--I'm a sucker for a good presentation. When settled, it pours the ultra tan (not white) cappucino-like creamy head that is two fingers deep. The color is pittch black even in my pilsner glass, and it is a reddish mahogany color held up to the light. Beautiful. Aroma is--well, smells like good beer, roasty malts and lightly hopped, not stale smelling. Taste wise--wow, I'm impressed. Notable in taste here unilike most of my experiences with Guinness, it is light but roasty, a bit of both sour and sweet. Not dense and full like, say, SN Stout, but this is a different catergory. There are detectable flavos or cofee roasted malt, even some caramel and paler pilsner kind of malts too. Flavor is what makes this beer heads above others that are comprable. Mouthfeel--nitro has none of the joys of spot on carbonation, and at times the lack of it ruins the drinking. Much better than fizzy, though. Overall, this is ultra drinkable, smooth and light. If you enjoy the taste, it is more drinkable than water. I dont know why anyone would rather drink fizzy corn flavored yellow beer instead of a stout when available, price not withstanding. I do at times wish this were more intense in flavor, but this is the go-to irish dry stout, and notably a good beer to drink if you want something that wont kill you in calories or alcohol content."
"Cheers"
"This pours from the nitro can to one of the best appearances I have ever seen: a dark brown body with hints of ruby, and a thick, creamy, dark brown head that stays atop the beer for the duration. Unfortunately, the aroma was only faintly chocolate malt, not nearly as strong as I would expect, and the body was extremely thin and watery, which overwhelmed whatever taste there was. Palate was so thin, I felt like I had just finished a glass of dark brown water with whipped cream topping. Quite disappointing."
"Da very drinkable stout and a sessionable choice to boot. I will return to this one again and again."
"This is a typical Nitro brew. The look is jet black poured in traditional fashion from the nitro can. The smell is noe-existant....at best a masked malty aroma. Taste is light and all malt....covered by a thick mask of creamy nitro. Creamy mouthfeel with more of a malty full backbone than was expected. Overall a very quaffable entry...not good but not bad."
"The usual deep color and a thick off white head. Thick and chunky lacing, beautiful Aroam very similar to Guinness and quite nicely familiar. Nice creamy roasted taste with a hint of cherry. Excellent stout. It's been quite sometime since I had one on tap and it was very good. Very drinkable, went down nice. Nothing bad to say at all."
" A classic Irish Dry Stout and undeniably sessionable."
"D- It might fill you up quickly but if you don't want dinner drink it all night. Good session stout."
"GET MY BUZZ ON- y (session)"
"Poured from a nitro can into a Guinness (of course!) pint glass. Pours a dark, dark brown with slight ruby hints around the edges when held to the light - not totally opaque black, but a very nice color. A large 3"" off-white creamy head forms and reduces to about .5"" for the remainder of the glass. Smells of roasted malts, vanilla and cream. Taste is very light - some may think flat, but it suites me fine. Great creamy mouthfeel. Could easily drink many of these!"
"The abv isn't even noticeable in this one. I drank a few out in the sun and it was even slightly refreshing."
"Overall this is a nice stout, and a pleasant divergence from Guinness or Beamish, all 3 of them making up the Holy trinity of Irish Stouts."
"the taste is very familiar. so light and dry. really weak, compared to stronger stouts i've had recently, (had my first impy a couple weeks ago). this is almost watery when i think of more impressive stouts. but when i think 4%, i'll take this over just about any other i've tried in the less than 5% session beer category. there is a lot going on, plenty of flavor, balanced with a slightly bitter finish. can't believe i just had this for the first time! the overall score is just a little higher than its more popular counterpart, (take a look at irish dry stout, ranked by number of reviews) but i think it's quite a bit better. definitely deserving the overall recommended score. i look forward to getting it again."
"I'll order this over Guinness any day."
"Very bland and watery, any roast qualities are overriden by the awful nitro widget. Has the qualities it needs for the style but only just barely, not enough to warrant a good score."
"16 ounce can with nitro widget."
" I find this slightly sweeter yet a tad less heavy than Guinness. Otherwise the two are very similar."
"Pretty much an average Irish Dry Stout, which is a good thing. Definitely a good alternative to Guiness."
"On-tap at my local irish pub. Great appearance, long lasting head with thick lacing. Smell can't match unfortunately. Very faint aroma of nitrogen, and bitter chocolate. Occaisonal off-smells make me wonder about freshness. Taste is rather bland. Friendlier than Guinness, but not a big improvement. A little chocolate here, a dash of coffee there, but not much substance. I expected more out of this beer, maybe the keg was old, I dont know. I wouldn't refuse a pint, but I wont be seeking it either."
"Pours super-dark maroon brown, with deep ruby highlights. Light beige nitro head, about one finger with predictably long-lasting retention and sheets of lace. Mild roasted barley nose, with faint herbal english hops. The taste immedidatly delivers rich, dark roasted barley, and slowly presents kindred flavors. Coffee and black patent become apparent in the properly dry aftertaste. The kiss of sweetness from the malt is just enough to balance the low hop bitterness and charred taste. Low carbonation and light in body, this is not only liquid silk, but defines the session ale. Just a touch of baking chocolate and burnt malt in the finish prevent it from drying out. I like that the nitro character fades quickly here, and gives way too a better Irish Stout than the likes or Guinness or Beamish."
"Flavorwise, it's perhaps just a tad stronger and toastier than guiness, with perhaps just a tad of an odd bitterness. A very drinkable stout, and definately one that I'll pick up again."
"Bottom black. middle brown/tan, top, dark tan/cream... at least for awhile ti' it dies down, then black with a creamy head that lasts. Light roasty aroma. A light dry roasty barley flavor, nice standard Stout, perhaps a tad better than the Guinness can (?) Very drinkable, almost always available at my local Von's, reasonably priced, good to have on hand. As my taste has grown more hoppy, i don't have this very often, but it still is a nice beverage."
"Murphy's Irish Stout. This stuff is hard to find in stock! Let me first just say I literally thought I was drinking coffee when I first had one of these. Makes Guinness seem mellloooow, a little more watery however. The appearance was pitch black, but upon holding it into the light, has a ruby tint, large creamy head. A real stout baby! The smell is almost non-existent from the can, but in a Guinness pint glass sort of formulates to coffee-ish, nothing strong. The taste is quite a smack to the face initially. Cocoa flavors, chocolate, coffee, a little bitterness, and roasted flavors. Very impressive, gets a little tiresome after awhile though. The mouthfeel is the major blow against this, and most other stouts. More watery than a natty light, then again, thats the stout style... Drinkability is excellent, stout is THE session beer. Lower in alcohol and no cringing after about three of these, of course, they only come in four packs...Very well done, however, not on par with Guinness Extra Stout in my opinion. Slightly mellower than that offering, but hey, its a good beer! Highly recommend if youre into the coffee scene/fad."
"Drinkability: unfortunately, I felt a bit stuffed after three of these. However, Murphy's is a great beer to either start or finish the night with. A solid stout overall."
"Quite drinkable, particularly for a stout."
"Pours black with a creamy tan head. Smell is mostly sweet, hard to pick up any huge characteristics. The taste is sweet with a bit more flavor than a Guinness. A very small bitter bite with a sweet finish. The thing I love most is the creamy quality of this beer. It is so smooth and delicious. The taste is not super potent, but delivers. The mouthfeel is amazing, I have yet to find another beer that is this creamy. This beer is very drinkable, a great beer for all beer lovers. Enjoy!"
"Overall a good session beer. A more economical choice than Guinness, especially if you have a sweet tooth."
"The brand just recently became available again from my local distributors, and damn am I glad. I hoisted many a pint of this in my last trip to the Emerald Isle and I've missed it over the past 2 years locally. I depended on trips to my brother's in SC to fill my Murphy's fix. I digress. A: Ebony in a pint glass when held to light a dark ruby red with a light tan head; excellent lacing and carbonation. S: Malted chocolate and mild coffee with caramel hints. T: Ambrosia.The taste has less of a bite of coffee than other stouts esp. Guinness, smooth and malty. M: Medium to thick with adequate but not overwhelming body. D: Almost too drinkable due to its smoothness and light aftertaste. Moderation is the key as I'm way too fond of this stuff. Sorry to sound blasphemous to Guinness purists, but both Beamish and Murphy's are a little smoother more in the nitro-cans than in their unpasteurized draught encarnations in the mother country. At least one good thing to come out of Heineken buying them out is wider distribution now."
"D - The sweetness would deter most, but I have a powerful sweettooth. Plus the wateriness actually makes it go down very smoothly, take that as you may."
"Out of the can it pours nearly black, topped with a creamy layer of off white froth. Great nitro head retention, with typical sheeting lace. Thin aroma, chocolatey and roasty with a whisp of dry engish hops. The flavor is decent. It begs to be compared to Guinness, and it's on par. Perhaps a touch more chocolate malt, but completely unassuming besides. Thin bodied with creamy nitro carbonation, which is fine, but still compromises the flavor by way of meekness. Some banana and pear esters. Cocoa dominated finish with a bit of herbal english hops. Snaps off dry and lingering on the coffee. Decent enough, homogenous with the other nitro can irish stouts."
"This one is off the chart in the drinkability catagory because with an ABV% of 4 I could, and have drank these all day."
"Medium to heavy in body, with a bittery, creamy mouthfeel. A good, easy drinkin, solid Dry Stout, very tasty and mildly alcoholic...cheers!"
"Murphy's Stout is not as popular in Southwest Ireland as is Guinness. Been to the homeland and tried both and prefer Murphy's. This is because to me Guinness has little flavor compared to other stouts. This is true in the US and Ireland. Murphy's Stout has stronger chocolate and coffee flavors that adds to its appeal. Would pick Murphy's over Guinness any day. Guinness just has better marketing."
"Though it seems that Murphy's has a better reputation on Beeradvocate.com than Guinness, I couldn't tell too much difference between the two. However, Murphy's was a little less ""foamy"" towards the end. The appearance is dark black with an inch creamy head which stays consistent throughout. Leaves a good lacing on the glass. The taste is excellent - very robust and with a good chocolate aftertaste. The smell is also robust with hints of chocolate. Ultimately, it's extremeley smooth - could have these all night. I can't say it's a lot better than Guinness, but it does give it a run for its money."
"drinkability: easily drinkable all night, not to thick, not too rich. The 4% alcohol makes it easy too, very well done session brew"
"I was really hoping for something more. I tried this a long time ago before I was drinking the dark beers and didn't like it then. I had another yesterday and was looking forward to it as I feel like I've come to appreciate this type of beer. Boy, was I disappointed, this beer has nothing on a Guinness, it tasted bland. It has a coffee taste to it w/ out the roasted malt hint that is so important in a beer like this. It also tasted on the flat side. The appearance is very nice though, the lacy head lasts until the bottom and then leaves a hunk of foam on the bottom of the glass. I can drink it and I don't dislike it, but clearly not a competitor of Guinness or a good stout or porter in my opinion."
"My take?... A rather dry Black, some what viscus black foamy liquid, that goes not much over a three pointer in my book."
"I'm a Belgian strong dark B.A. So, at the time this was the only dark available. I figured I had tasted Guinness befrore, this seemed to be the same, so may as well give it a shot. It's got the same smooth nitro mouthfeel as Guinness, but it' s a bit ligheter on the abv. Same chocolaty, malty taste but just a tad sweeter. I wasn''t too impressed. Especially at $3 + a can for such a low abv brew. It brought back the same wallet crunching memories I have of Sam Adams Chocloate Bock for $22 a 750ml. I was involved in some good conversation and, before I knew it, had five of these down. For the money that I spent, I don't think this one was worth it. Much better than any BMC offering, but that doesn't say much."
"The mouthfeel is the one disappointing part. Even with the nitro smoothness it is a bit watery. This is a decent stout."
"This is a truly great beer. Not extraordinary, but very good. Perfect type of beer to always have in stock in your fridge. It's great when you just want a really good brew and are in the mood for something easy and that won't get you wasted if you decide to have a few in one sitting. IMO far more enjoyable than Guinness, though I do like Guinness in the nitro-can as well. Also good for someone new to the world of stouts. Highly recommended."
"Not bad considering this bastard spewed all over me and my kitchen, causing me to have to clean the walls while missing the cascading nitro. Suffers from the typical nitro problems but still miles ahead of Guinness draught."
"This is a very good stout. Nothing is outstanding, but this stands up to, and would perhaps precede, Guinness any day."
"Opaque black body with perfect nitro head, ecru in color. I renew my protest against the need to make an ""appearance"" rating for stouts. Smells affirmatively nutty with notes of roast biteyness. The first sip... my god it's easy to mistake this for Guinness. This only the third nitro stout I've ever had so I guess that's no surprise really. The taste is slightly nuttier, less hop-bitter, and slightly fuller-bodied than the old standby; I actually slightly prefer it. It's as if they nitro'd the Guinness extra-stout. As to drinkability, well, I could pound Irish stout all night long and have on many occasions; I imagine this one would fit the bill nicely."
"Had this on tap last night. Came out to a dark black color with a creamy head that stay until the bottom of the glass. Amazing well drawn by the bar tender. Smell was fair, some dry malt and chocolate. Flavors along the same lines, and remained very easy on the palate. Very drinkable considering the lower ABV. I'm gonna have to compare a canned or bottled version. Highly Recommended. A step up from Guinness."
"Murphy's Irish Stout pours a thick black color with a tan, typical nitro head. The aroma is lacking, probably because it's a nitro beer. Nothing bad mind you, just not much of anything. Taste has notes of chocolate, coffee and most notable to me, licorice. The flavor is somewhat bitter, but not in an unpleasant way. This is my favorite of the Guiness/Beamish/Murphy's trio. A good example of the style, recommended."
"A fun one to drink on St. Patty's day - Cool to look at. Easy to drink quite a few of, though a metallic taste is left after a few."
"Although this is not my personal favorite of the big three dry Irish stouts, it is still quite good."
"The beer poured into an imperial pint with a thick creamy head. The nitro beers are fun to watch due to the settling that occurs. It is fairly dark with hints of red when held to the light. The smell is of roasted coffee. The taste is roasted grains. This is a slightly more bitter beer than others of the style. Not so much that it affects smoothness though. I could drink these in session. I will drink these again. Runnning neck and neck for best of the style in my opinion."
"As the bog standard, lame, watery ubiquitous stouts go this one ranks a little higher than the rather more pricey Guinness. The taste is rather one dimensional but pleasant with roasted malt to the fore and hint of aged banana skin along with the creamy taste of cheaper pasteurised beer which is sadly standard in these parts and a much too faint hoppy edge. The feel is watery without as much carbonation as promised by the beer's appearance, but regardless this slides down easily enough for it make a passable session beer. I recall it tasting a little better on draught."
"Pours a pitch black with your typical nitro head that is a solid retaining 2 fingers thick. Smells like that liquer chocolate that my friend from Switzerland used to bring me. The taste is smooth. This is the best of the nitro Irish Stouts that I've had. Sweet, milky, and coffee. Feels good and thick in the mouth. I've always liked the way the nitro head feels on my lips as I sip. Overall this is a very drinkable beer, that is good enough to session. Like I said this is my favorite of the nitro Irish Stouts."
"very drinkable, mild, but good tasting. and for what it is, a nitro stout, very good."
"Pours dark (of course), nearly opaque brown. Good 'stout' foam head, a couple of fingers tall, nice retention. Lacing was good also. Smells a lot better than Guinness. Slight chocolate notes, malts in the nose and the taste. Creamy, not watery, very good texture and mouthfeel. This would be my choice for canned stouts."
"Well, I'm having this a day after St. Paddy's day but oh well. Poured beautifully into a Guinness glass. Lots of carbonation that cascaded and finalized into a nice creamy half inch head. I took a picture of it because it just looked like a perfect beer to me. That nice dark brown/black with creamy head on top just looks beautiful. Not too much in the nose, little bready but nothing else jumps out at me. Taste is solid, I dont think I would be able to tell the difference between Beamish, Guinness or this out of nitro can in a blind taste test, but I know I like it. Feels silky smooth going down and leaves a slightly dry bitter taste on the tip of the tongue. I truly enjoy this beer everytime I have it, which everytime I say to myself is not enough. I feel I could drink this beer at any occasion and be happy."
"Mouthfeel is expectedly creamy and smooth. Little carbonation here, though this is true to the style. Drinkability is high since this is a medium bodied, dry stout, not a heavy American or Imperial style. It would follow also that hop bitterness and aroma is not as high as in a Imperial or Sweet stout. Lower ABV makes this a nice session brew."
"Pint for St. Paddy's Day. Pours an inky black with a thick creamy tan head, tiny bubbles and lots of lace rings, good retention. Smell is sweet chocolate, coffee, vanilla and a little iron/cherry. Taste is dry roasted coffee, chocolate, little bit of cherry and some vanilla. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, very creamy and smooth. A decent stout, head above Guinness."
"Pours with black depths and a nice creamy 1/2 inch tan head. Aroma of toasted barley is quite inviting. Taste is smooth and creamy. A hint of bubblegum seems to come through in the background of roasted malts, but it seems welcome here. Not as bitter as Guinness with a nice rounded sweetness that's not cloying at all. A very nice stout, and one which I prefer over Guinness."
"drinkability: low alcohol, very easy to drink"
"Thankfully not watery but thickish and delivering a decent amount of toasted grain crunch."
"I'm growing very tired of nitro brews in general, I think Boddy's is about the only left I truly enjoy."
"Widget works its wonders with cascading sand-colored head to creamed coffee churning to deep black with garnet highlights. However, I'm not sure that it's any better-looking than other nitro-infused stouts, whether on tap or in can or bottle. Subdued aromas of floral hops atop milk chocolate. Earthy-floral hop flavors ride the crest of a malty roasted cocoa wave. Mineral aftertaste. Taste is bit simple, but seems appropriate for the style. Mouthfeel is initially creamy, but immediately thins out. Low abv + thin body = easy drinking. Whether I'd choose this over another style is another story, though..."
"Again, very comparable to Guinness. Sweeter (lactose?), creamier, richer, and not as dry or chalky. Still highly roasty, medium heavy, cocoa, nutty, and clean. Bitterness is lower lying than expected from big roasted malt (charcoal). Lowly hopped as well. Colored a nearly opaque black / brown with ruby highlights. Still retains a firm head that remains unwavering. Maybe better than it's competitors."
"Mouth feel is a bit thin and it could stand to be a bit more carbonated."
"Body is medium, creamy, and VERY easy to down. A far superior alternative to Guinness any day of the week."
"Some charred barley, but like most from this style it is on the easy drinking, creamy, laid back. Watered taste, milky mouthfeel, and the drinkability is average just because I can't see myself looking forward to this or pursuing it any time soon. Once again another brew I'd prefer to try on tap, without the nitro blasting ball, but for this review in a can its simply uneventfull."
"Mouthfeel is fairly thin and watery, but astringent (dry, as in the style). Did not really care for this beer."
"The bottom line: this is just another mainstream Guinness alternative when one is out and about. Absolutely not worth buying from a beer store, but you could do worse in a bar."
"Slainte"
"Poured into a pint glass- nitro clouds billow down to the bottom for a long time. The head is creamy kahki color with TINY bubbles. Excellent. Great lacing. A tad of light shows through the bottom if you look hard enough. Small bubbles hit the bottom sides of the glass. It smells vaguely of a porter's sour and a stout porter's creaminess. A slight smell of coffee. The taste is creamy, mellow, sour, bitter, dark, and a bit like 70% cacoa dark chocolate. The mouthfeel is a 70% thick and a bit sticky. The drinkability is decent to me. I didn't find this to be a shockingly great beer myself but I'm sure a ton of others will. I drank a Pabst before then I drank 3 of these in 2 hours and then I moved to another Pabst. Obviously this beer is not meant to be drank in this fashion lol, but I didn't find that I liked the taste so much so that cuts the drinkability down a bit for me. I don't regret this purchase though. Defniitely a beer you may as well try. It's such a relished one."
"than Beamish, although I still prefer Guinness Extra Stout."
"Contrary to popular conceptions about ""stout"" beers, Murphy's is quite drinkable and neither its body nor alcohol content make it particularly heavy or overbearing. I prefer this beer to Guinness."
"The taste is a bit different from the others. It has a touch of tangyness that the others dont. Murphys also seems to be quite thin, yet incredibly smooth."
"After the first round they become smoother, a good beer"
"cheers..."
"Pours a cascading black filled with a foamy cloud of milky fuzz, huge big bubbled carbonation with the essence of chocolate and coffee flowing from the top. Taste is very coffee like, very balanced at the beginning with both bitter and sweet flavors coming through. Not as thick as Guinness going down, but quite good, obviously stout-like. At only 4% alcohol this is a great session beer for stout drinkers that deserves it's reputation. I think it's far superior to Guinness and at least as good as Beamish but to each his own."
"Drinkability: This is much more fun to look at than to drink, but then that's not really a good reason to buy this beer. I don't recommend this one."
"Taste is sweet, creamy and oh so drinkable. This whips the piss out of Guinness in my humble opinion. Perpetually drinkable as a pasteurized stout should be I suppose. Definitely something you can hammer back all night. Cheers."
" Got the advantage of an excellent pour but this is regardless an excellent stout."
"Pours a beautiful thick stout with a black body and light brown head. After it settles, because it first pours a cloud and then rises to the top. Smells like a chocolate coffee. It has a very watery mouthfeel to it. It tastes like a nice coffee stout that has a hint of hops blended in."
"I have Murphy's stout on tap in my basement pub and really enjoy this stout. The head is thick and creamy with a black body. The smell is a roasted smell with a chocolaty hint. The mouth feel is creamy smooth and tasty. The taste is complex and outstanding. Starts malty and finishes chocolaty smooth. Love this stout, not as dry and more flavorful than Guinness, more complex and tastier than beamish. I think it's the best irish nitro stout."
"Mouthfeel- A rich, creamy palate that after having 20oz. glasses of this stout, this was a dinner in and of itself."
"Ahh Murphys Irish Stout. Its a very dark black in color with a creamy white to very light brown head that is very dense. I drank this particular Murphys out of a nitro-can. Although, Ive had it on tap at Churchills in Savannah many years ago. This is like a clone of Guinness but a bit more smoother. It has a very rich and creamy taste with chocolate and coffee flavors."
"A good drinking beer. I slightly prefer Guinness, but Murphy's is good. I wish there was a CO2 version available, though."
"Pours a nice deep deep brown almost black with a nice fluffy tan head. the aroma is roasty with a hint of smoke. the flavor is very roasty, bitter, slight smoke, hint of chocolate. the mouthfeel is nice not to heavy. this is a very easy drinking beer. i like it more then guinnese here in the states."
"Black beer with a dense, chocolatey head. Great head retention and lacing, as expected. Mild aroma due to the nitro, but plenty of roasted malts and a bit of coffee and chocolate are evident. More chocolate in the flavour with moderate bitterness. Lingering roasted finish. Light body and low carbonation. A good irish stout and a fabulous session beer."
"mouthfeel is full and creamy and great. an easily drinkable stout. this is one of my favorites for its pleasant chocolatey taste. not as good as the young's double chocolate though. but not bad at all, underrated on here in my opinion. one of my old favorites."
"Coffee flavor is definite but moderated and creamy with a slightly burnt chocolate note and a dry finish with hops and coffee bitterness in the aftertaste."
"Anyways, its an ok brew. Not my fav, but hell - it was free, so cool."
"The mouthfeel is great. Nice and creamy. I don't think it's worth it to rob the beer of its carbonation, aroma, and flavor for an entertaining pour and a creamy mouthfeel however. This still makes a good session beer. I prefer it to Guinness at least, but that's not really saying much."
"Not bad, though I'm sure it would be much better in draft."
"Not quite as good as Beamish, but certainly far superior to a nitro-can Guinness. Easily om-par with Guinness served properly"
"I would definitely recommend this beer, its one of the best irish stouts I've tried so far."
"the appearance is a black with slight red tinges with a nice 3/4"" thick white foamy head. the smell is very similar to most stouts with a nice roasted aroma. the taste is out of this world with coffee, chocolate, and a slight hops flavor. ther mouthfeel is full bodied with a very creamy texture. If I'm only going to have a pint or two, this is my go-to beer. Very drinkable and cheaper than guinness."
"Minimal carbonation, which is to be expected from a nitro can. This leads to a good drinkability level."
"Tastes is about the same, coffee is what I would say is the strongest taste, some chocolate. Nothing too overpowering here, but a well balanced taste which is a bit on the hop side. I would say this is my favorite of the 3 major irish stout beers that are available here (Guinness, Beamish, Murphy's)."
"Nothing exceptional about the flavor. Fairly light and timid compared to American Stouts, but of course that's generally the case with beer from the UK as compared to beer from the US. Always more reserved... more proper. But good and i'd take this over many a beer."
"Pours a dark, dark brown with shades of crimson. The head is a creamy, thick, eggshell-colored one. Fairly easy on the eyes. It smells strongly of roasted malts and chocolate with a slight hoppy note. The taste is quite strong, somewhat bitter chocolate with an everso faint mint strand. It definitely could have used more carbonation in the mouthfeel, but all in all, a somewhat decent choice. Note: I hate nitro cans."
"Very drinkable, the flavors are close to being chewy and there is a decent balance of flavor and although mild a milky yet twangy finish."
"I could drink some more of these now, although the taste isn't terribly interesting. With the masterfully done nitro-can, everything shines BUT the taste, which is just average. Because of that, this is a pleasure to drink, and it's an okay stout, but I wouldn't drink it every day."
"Other comments: I ""think"" I prefer this to Guinness, but I'm not sure. Drank one yesterday, but didn't rate it. The one I'm drinking today had a nitrogen-bobble failure, so it came out like a normal bottled beer which is sort of nice because it doesn't have that nitrogen ""bite""."
"This beer is extremely easy to drink, thanks to the creamy nitro effect, though you do sacrifice an amount of taste. Good for a nitro fix at home."
"beer explodedev from the niro can ( I really love the look) o=into an oversized glass. Deep brown color with massive foamy head that would not quit. Smell a combination of chocolate and roasted malt. Taste is coffee-like with roasted notes. A great beer."
"Nothing to special in the works here, however nothing to bad either. This stout poured a usual dark dark beer with a frothy creamy head sitting at top that retained some pretty nice retention. It smelled faintly like creamy malts and hops and predominatly like coffee. It tasted about the same, creamy and smooth with some roasted flavors aswell. I found it to be less enjoyable than some of the other Irish Stouts but enjoyable non the less."
"Appearance is that familiar inky-black with a beige head and retentive lace. Aroma is of fresh cream and malt. Initially one tastes the sweet lactose, but then roasted grains with a hint of banana, and then the hops smooth out the experience by adding some dry, bitterness. This allows the finish to be pleasant and not too sweet. Reminiscent of Guinness, but nowhere near as good as Stones Imperial Russian Stout or Samuel Smith's."
"Drinkability: Sitting down to a night of bs'ing with some good friends and just kicking back to a few of these would be a pleasure. A great brew and - in my opinion - superior to much more popular, or at least smarter marketed, Guinness stout."
"Very easy to drink and so enjoyable. On tap now in many more places, and the one I'll go for if the rest of the selection is ho-hum. Very easy to put a few of these down, and enjoyable to do so at the same time."
"Dark, dense chocolate black with an even denser nitro-cushion of creamy tan head. Nose of light chocolate/cocoa powder with light roasted, nutty bitterness and a whiff of cardboard. Chocolate flavors are more pronounced as it warms. Milk chocolate sweetness with a nutty edge is balanced against a smooth roasted bittereness. Finish is bittersweet. Creamy mouthfeel with a medium body. Pretty good, especially for a style I'm not crazy about."
"Good beer that I have enjoyed for years, finally got around to reviewing it."
"Presentation: Packaged in a sixteen ounce can with a nitro capsule; served in a standard pint tap glass. Needless to say, the tap glass cannot contain the entire beer, so two pours were required."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, got the whole cool nitro-cascade thing working, formed a dense 1"" putty-hued head over the clear, yet almost opaque, dark mahogany brew. Head is frothy, as one expects from the serving style, and lasts superbly, with sticky, creamy lacing. Aroma is minimal, with little identifiable beyond a light, generic ""beer"" smell. Taste is sedate dark malts, with that nitro flavor that seems to pop up, and a lightly bitter close. Not bad, but as most nitro brews, lacking in character. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, yet seems thin at the same time. Drinkability is excellent though, and at 4%abv, we've got a session brew here, a good standby when more exotic choices are unavailable."
"Pours a deep drown color. Not quite black I can see some light coming thru. Nice head from the nitro can. Low aroma-I almost think Im smelling the foam and not the beer. Nice roasted flavor. Not quite as bitter as Guinness. A more rounded flavor comes thru in the Murphys. Slight smokiness. Great velvety mouthfeel. A very drinkable brew. I could easily make a night out of this."
"All in all not a bad, not at all. I'll stick with Guinness, thank you very much, but you could do much worse with this one."
"On-tap at Fiddlers Green in Orlando. Awesome!! Perfect cascading black with a tan head that laced the pint glass all the way down. Malt, coffee aroma that matched the creamy smooth taste. Medium body stout that you could drink all night, easily. Better finish than most dry stouts."
"Murphy's Irish Stout has the typical almost black color of a stout with the also typical large creamy head of a nitro can. The aroma is of roasted coffee with a mildly sweet finish. The taste is also of roasted coffee with a semi-sweet, dry finish. As for the comparisons to Guinness Draught, I find Murphy's to be a notch fuller in taste and aroma. I now need to try Beamish to finish off the big three of Irish dry stouts."
"Pours from the can with the characteristic cascading nitrogen creamy light brown head that sits atop a deep brown almost black beer. The aroma is fairly enticing with notes of chocolate and sweet grain. This beer is quite smooth on the palate, with a creamy mouthfeel from the low carbonation level. There is not a whole lot of flavor going on here, but there is a subtle chocolate note as well as a hint of roasty astringency in the finish. It seems to be a bit more flavorful than Guinness, but not by much. Basically an easily quaffable brew, that could certainly use a bit more roasted grain."
"Bought this for St. Patty's Day, but never got around to it until the other night. Pours a dark black in color with a very slight red tinge around the extreme edges if I look extremely closely. The head is thick, spongy and milky. The flavor is all malts with a lsight hop finish. Other flavors make me think of eating clover and milk duds. The mouthfeel has a very dry finish. A good beer to end a long day and it sits happily in the tummy."
"Comes in a 16oz can with a widget. After popping the top, the widget cracks and, well, a little bit spilled out. Beautiful cascading of the carbonation for about a minute and a half, before the beer settles out into a perfect 1.5-inch stiff, creamy head atop a midnight black body with ruby highlights. Rich aroma of roasted malt, with traces of cola, molasses, and a faint whiff of alcohol. Palate contains more rich, roasted malt, a touch of chocolate, molasses, and cola, and finishes with a small flourish of hops. Mouthfeel is a decadent creaminess from the head, balanced nicely by the lightly carbonated body. While some would say I should probably be drinking Guinness on St. Patrick's Day, I'm very, very happy with Murphy's."
"Pros: It's not Guiness, it's only 4%, it's creamy, it has some roastiness and chocolate malts, and it pours a nice lasting head. However, it's low on overall flavour, and does not go to the pros with bold stoutiness as in many other stouts I have had."
"Mid level mouthfeel went down smooth and creamy, leaving a slight caramel sweetness from the malts. Very drinkable and worth a few. Even though they are quite large, they have maintained their quality"
"Overall impression: A step above the more common Irish Stout. The roasted flavors shine through nicely, and it is still incredibly drinkable."
"Very impressed, I felt that the head looked very creamy, but the texture did not feel right.I felt it had much more flavor than the guinness drought.I loved the burnt coffee taste, and the just enough bitter after taste to my liking.It had a semi choclately taste;however the coffee taste, fortunatley dominates the flavor.It goes to down to damn easy.I could drink four easy in fify minutes.I highly recomend, if you are a guinness drought fan.The head does not compare to the G-drought,but the flavor much fuller, and I have a cold.In addition, if you are a person such as I, who is skepticle of stouts that do not have much of a biter after taste.This beer having a mild bitter taste is excellent."
"edit: have had three in a row so drinkability rating re-raised."
"Pitch black in color and a large creamy head! Looks beautiful! The smell has a faint coffee and roasted malt to it. Not as strong of a smell I would like. I do think the Nitro can has something to do with it. Taste like coffee, some faint burnt sugar and a slighty dry hoppy finish. Medium-light mouthfeel. What a great session beer! the drinkablity is dangerous. I can drink pint after pint of this beer!"
"Big roasty flavor. Nice beer. Drinkable."
"Pours beautifully from the nitro-can, dark with a large cascading foamy head. Smell is weak, thankfully the taste is not. Thicker mouthfeel than the guinness nitro-can, which has a much more watery consistancy. at 4% alcohol, it goes down nice and easy."
"At first glance this beer is almost black with a brown cascading head, but closer inspection reveals a deep garnet color. Roasted malt dominates the aroma with a distinct smoke presence lingering. The flavor is smooth malt, creamy and crisp. This has a bit more body than the Guiness stout in a similar can, which is a welcome change. Overall, this is a great, very enjoyable stout."
"Well, it looks great. I think it is pretty hard to award a nitro less than a 5. The cascading cream and perfect head are par for the course with a nitro, but still I love it every time. One could throw back several of these without really noticing. That's both a good and a bad thing. Yes, it this is a penultimate session beer, but there just isn't much flavor. There's some roasted malt flavor and all in all it is pretty thin. Good pub beer? Yes. Beer to really sit and enjoy? Nope."
"I'll always be a bit biased towards Murphy's as it was my ""gateway"" beer. The first beers I had tried did not deserve the title (you know the type, they're commonly found at college parties). I was convinced that beer was a lost cause. Then when in Cork, a friend of mine offered to buy me a pint of Murphy's, I declined initially as I believed I did not like beer, but he insisted. I am glad that he did. I was amazed! Beer wasn't an aquired taste afterall, it was down right wonderful! As such I'm still a bit biased towards Murphy's. While better beers do exist (I'm partial to Barleywines myself, and Trappist Ales), Murphy's is a good solid Irish stout. It's more drinkable and has a more complex and full bodied flavor than Guinness, without the metallic harshness that plague's it's better known cousin. A solid choice, I'd recommend to anyone who loves a good stout."
"Pours black with a ruby hue and one inch of creamy tan head that stays well down to the bottom of the glass. The smell is that of roasted malt. Hints of coffee and toffee in the taste and it finishes with a simple mild malty taste. A very smooth beer due to the nitro-can serving. A fairly decent stout, on par with guinness, and for £3 for a 4-pack I'll certainly be buying more of these."
"Very smooth, nice and full body. Couldn't be much closer to a Guinness. Easy drinking from start to finish, easy to handle."
"On the note of preference: I will be buying more of this. Not something I would turn down nor shy away from."
"Drinkability: Makes a fine session beer for a stout."
"I enjoyed this beer and fondly remember many years ago hitchhiking through Ireland and drinking Murphys at every occasion. Years later Ive got Murphys in a can in Portland, Oregon and while its still good, it does lack for excitement."
"This is strange because of the bitterness. I mean, it's bitter but there's no hops. What's the deal?"
"doesnt make you jump out of your seat, but certainly does what it should, and does it well."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Overall: I'm going to go with the Guinness crowd, but this is an enjoyable Dry Stout. Flavorful, rich, light, quaffable. Drinkability is very good, an excellent session beer and a thirst quencher. Recommended."
"Pours a deepest ruby color with a creamy light tan colored head upon settling. Aromas of roasted malts, chocolate, subdued hops and an air of fruitiness. Flavors of sweet roasted barley, Challenger hops, coffee, chocolate and an oxidized, metallic taste that suggests smoked ham. Reasonably dry finish to a sweeter dry Irish stout. Pretty good beer, and I don't really care for nitrogenated beers. I hadn't had one in a long while. I thought I remembered preferring Murphy's over other Irish stouts, but it'd been that long since I had one. I could put down a dozen pints between dinner and last call on St. Patrick's Day if I was feeling Irish..."
"The usual nitro-can properies take over in the mouthfeel. It seems a little thin considering the other properties of the beer, but is otherwise good."
"The color is Dark brown nearly black with a hint of mahogony when in direct light. Has a very thick light brown head that stays and stays. It was very hard for me to pick up much aroma thru that thick head. I did manage to pick up some maltyness with maybe a hint of butter. The flavor had a definite coffee and chocolate presence and a good roasted malt bitterness on the finish."
"The obvious comparison here is to Guinness Stout. I actually like Murphy's a bit better, although I do enjoy Guinness a lot. For me, the roasted malt character of Murphy's seems ""fresher"" and better done. I can also put away more Murphy's in a sitting than I can Guinness, which starts to bog me down."
"An excellent example of a stout. The tap pours an out of this world head thickness and retention. Off white, extremely dense fluffy foam is present throughout. Pure black color. Smell is subtle, of slight malt. Taste is extremely dry for a stout. Subtle hops in the aftertaste. A much lighter beer than it appears to be."
"The big, dense, nitro head is light tan (almost just gray) and sits flat and creamy atop the black (red-brown highlights) beer. There is faint chocolate in the nose with some nuttiness. Nice, if light. A light fruity front turns creamy and chocolatey. Call me crazy, but there's bubblegum in there. A tangy, fruity finish shows some coffee. It's a nice, creamy, fruity, chocolatey beer."
"Pours black as night with a thick tan head that lasts. Wonderful sheets of lace cling all the way down. Sweetish aroma with some roast. Creamy and sweet flavor, almost like a milkshake. Some roast comes in to cut the sweetness along with a light dose of hops. Finishes dry with a roasted barley astringency. Very creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Highly drinkable, the smoothness of the beer makes it glide down your throat with ease. Just as good as Guinness, maybe better."
"Oh so smooth with little to no carbonation feel on the tongue. Chocolate/malt flavors hit you at first which are delightful, only to be followed by a nice pleasant bitter coffee finish. Unreal how good this is."
"Pours as expected from a nitro can with a nice cascade of bubbles. After everything has calmed down the glass is left with a very dark brown beer capped by a sticky, off-white, creamy looking head. A sharp contact separtes the two, giving the beer a very nice appearance. Smells nicely of roasted malt and coffee. Tastes creamy with flavors of roasted malt present as well. Unfortunately the somehwat unpleasant ""nitro can taste"" is also present and masks some of the other flavors. This is a very smooth beer (as expected from a nitro can) and fairly drinkable. A pretty good beer, but not one of my first choices for a stout."
"This one poured nice, tasted creamy, with a nice balanced malty taste, with a very dry finish. My only complaint is that this stout tasted a bit watered down, and lacked the big flavors that I enjoy so much. Not very complex, but surely better on tap."
"The beer pours a deep black color with a thick creamy off-white head. The aroma is good. It has a nice sweet dark malt scent with a creamy dry finish. The taste is good. It has a thin dark malt flavor that feels a little watered down, but good. It has a definate Irish style to it. It goes down smooth with a dry, yet creamy finish. The mouthfeel is good. It has a medium body and adequate carbonation. The beer drinks well. This is a fine Irish style stout."
"Lets be honest here, it has to be compared to Guinness. Same great Nitro poured look and weak aroma with the muted flavors. Flavor was actually quite good with a sweetness running right along side the coffee bitterness. Nice dry finish. Very easy drinking beer, and I find it a bit more interesting than its rival from St James Gate."
"The less than aggressive flavor profile, the too-thin body and the low ABV make Murphy's Irish Stout quite drinkable/sessionable. It's pretty underwhelming though, all things considered. I can't help but think that it would be much better beer without the nitro gimmick."
"Pours out black with a big tan nitro head which is smooth like so fine yes it is. Better than the other big Irish stout import, which says a lot. Too much crutching on the nitro body though. Nice and roasty with a touch of bitter to help it go down. Worth a taste if you havn't tried the other Guinness yet."
"Nice off-while head hangs around for awhile. A dark color, though not pitch black. Held to a light, the light shines through. A nice mellow smell, nothing overwhelming. A very nice smooth taste and feel. Not the most drinkable but worth having on occassion. Can says to chill for a few hours before opening but it tastes best at room temp."
"All in all a great stout, dry but well balanced to include some sweetness"
"Slainte"
"My personal favorite from the big three in Ireland, although my memory of Murphy's on-tap is better."
"Drinkability: not my type, but I understand the attraction"
"My only gripes here: Nitro cans do not match my Tap beer expectations and The product is made in Canada but they try to obfuscate that with French! (I suppose Guinness started that movement)."
"Overall - A damn nice irish stout"
"Beats Guinness any day, I think the bottle is a bit better."
"The taste is nice, roasted malts and a wee bit of coffee. This appears to be a typical dry stout, light on alcohol, easy to drink, and deceptively rich and filling. I'd still like a nice pint."
"Nitro can hissed sharply upon opening and the beer began to foam quickly through the mouth of the can. I began pouring as fast as I could with minimal spillage. The color is black with the tiniest of ruby peeking through the bottom of my pint. Thick off-white and creamy tan head. Lacing is like a thick sudsy coating. Aroma could be a little stronger. Hints of roasted malt and vanilla sweetness emerge. Mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth and creamy. The body isn't nearly as full as say, Guinness or Beamish, but thick and coating non-the-less. Chocolate and roasted malt flavors initially. Hop bitterness arrives toward the back and with it comes a more of a burnt malt flavor. Finish is soft and mildly dry. Murphy's is extremely smooth and easy drinking."
"Ah, now this is a fine brew! Nitro can, pours out nice and coal black, supporting a sturdy, creamy tiniest of bubbles head and leaving a ton of creamy lace. Nose is pure breadyness. Taste is clean and malty, more then a hint of roastyness. Nice drying bitterness, leads to a long and smooth tasty finish. This one should be a staple for any stout lover"
"Dark chocolate color with thick off-white head. Smells of sweet roasted malts and coffee. Very thick body with a smooth creamy feel. Nice blend of malts and the faint hint of hops completes the beer. This ends with a dry and slightly bitter taste and tends to get watered down as you finish the beer. This is a quality stout and really goes down easy."
"Out of a nitro-can, very similar process to the Guinness in a can. However, similiarities end there. On appearance, Murphy's has a nice, thick black colour with a tan head. The smell is pleasant, with a coffee-like odor that hits the upper reaches of your nasal passages. For the taste, it is initially thin. However, when it hits the back of your tongue, Murphy's sweet roasted flavor comes into play. As it goes down, you really feel the heaviness of the beer. If you want to watch a game and drink down beers, this is not the kind to drink. However, if you are with good mates and enjoying conversations, then this is the kind to have."
"Would buy only if the tap offerings were slim pickings though."
"Very fine bubbles fill the mouth, and as I drink, the head leaves swaths of foam along the sides."
"If you want to drink a light beer, turn to a nitro-draught stout, not any of that low-carb. BS! It pours a just-shy-of-opaque black with a tan-colored thick, creamy typical nitro head. The smell is full of dark roasted grain, some chocolate and is somewhat malty. The taste is rather simple and straightforward; roasted barley in abundance, lightly mild and finishing rather dry. Pretty similar to Guinness Draught but usually priced a little better. Mouthfeel is thin, but typical of most nitro beers."
"A nice Irish stout, not the best I've ever had, but certainly worth my time and cash. Perhaps nepotism isn't such a bad thing after all."
"Appearance: Dark ruby brown with a big nitrogenous tan creamy head, leaves thick coating of lace. Aroma: Dry slightly acidic mild coffee nice brew can't complain, it's a staple as far as Dry Irish Stout's go. Taste: Creamy even flavor very similar to Guinness, the toasted malts and dry finish seem like the same beer. While, Beamish has some varitation to the flavor profile. Mouthfeel: Light and ariy mouthfeel nice and creamy, nitro tap. Drinkability: Excellent easy goingi dry Irish the working man's ale."
"Black in colour with a decent tan head. This is a good beer, but not the best, as far as stouts go. It had a light chocolate aroma along with roated malts. The taste was similar wth a watered down feel. It was good, but nothing I would call impressive."
"Poured out of a nitro can. Nice black color with a huge head. Smell consisted of a coffee/earthy aroma. Taste is very smooth and creamy. But I think it's too thin. Overall though, it does taste better than Guinness, but just a little too thin not only for my liking, but for a stout overall. On the other hand, that's why I believe it's highly drinkable. If you want a nice, creamy, smooth beer, go with a muprhy's. If you want to suck on a bottle, go for a Guinness. It's your choice. I'll take a Murphy's anyday."
"Good beer-good stout."
"Medium bodied (and I dislike a thin stout, so this is good) with coffee in that dark-bread malt taste. Finish has little hops, more a sourness lingering."
"I find it hard to discern the complete taste of beers when they come in these nitro cans and I think that's especially true for this beer. It poured a chocolate darkness with a huge, creamy tan head. Lots of lacing along the glass. I couldn't discern much from the smell, slight malt smell. The body was thin, very thin which left the taste weak. No real base. Chocolate and coffee seems to be the main flavors. Slight vanilla comes in along with some bitterness, malt bitterness probably. The finish is slightly bitter but it's also lacking. This beer just seemed to be lacking in substance all around. Not bad just not good either."
"Drinkability  If you are looking for engine oil stout or some West Coast hop monster then pass this one by. But, if you want something mellow or something you can drink all afternoon than pick up a few of these."
"Someone left a few nitro cans after new years eve so I thought I would revisit this stout. Pours a near pitch black with a nice creamy head. Has the mesmorizing cascade effect that the nitro cans produce. Smell is that of dark roasted malts, coffee, and a little chocolate. Taste is nice and dry with hints of coffee. It seems a bit more thin that Guinness, but that could be because it was in the nitro can and not on draft. The mouthfeel is smooth and velvety. Drinkability is High due to the creamy nature and low ABV."
"This didn't impress me as much as I was expecting it to, but I wouldn't turn one of these down if offered one. As with Guinness, I'm sure that if truly want the highest quality Murphy's, I'd have to go to the Emerald Isle to get it. In summary, a decent nitro-stout that is a tad bit watery and boring."
"Smelled of roasted coffee and wood scents, and thats about all. Taste is awfully thin but satisfying - roasty, bark-like, and thinly hoppy, enough to make you think Dry Irish Stout. Strange and unnatural, thin and light, but satisfying after so many bigger and better beers. Ill take this in a can, nitro widget and all, any day."
"WIDGET CAN. Dark black color. Large foamy white head. Aroma is chocolate and fruity. A light to medium bodied stout. Malts are chocolate and roasty. There is a slight metallic taste and it is a little thin and watery tasting. I wonder if the off taste is due to the widget? Touches of coffee and vanilla. This particular can is not very appealing. Will need to re-taste some time. The off taste just drowns out the stoutness of this beer. Mouthfeel is very thin. Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter"
"Notes: Not bad; enjoyed this a bit more than I thought I would."
"thick slightly off white/tannish head. creamy aroma with some sweetness and a touch of roast. very smooth taste with some hints of roasted malt and a bitterness, not sure if it's from the grain or hops. very nicley balanced and a refreshing aftertaste, very easy to drink."
"Can you talk Irish stouts without making a Guinness comparison? Of course not, so I'll get that out of the way first. Murphy's beats Guinness hands down, and is my favorite readily available stout. That said, I'll move on. A great looking classic Irish stout with the nitro cascading effect, great head, and beautiful light/dark contrast. Smell is good but not exceptional, again the classic roasted malt/cocoa/coffee notes. The taste is what sets this apart from Beamish and Guinness, its everything that makes those two good, just done better!"
"Pours a caramel brown that tumbles into a jet black beauty with a near-white, creamy head. It's smell is so faint, to my nose anyway, that I can hardly detect any aroma at all. This stout starts smooth and malty with a bit of chocolate or dark creme flavoring. It is - of course - full-bodied with gentle flavors and a wheat or barley thickness to the beer. Letting a bit of the head onto your tongue only serves to highlight that wheat flavor. This stout finishes strong, dry, and smooth with a pleasant bit of aftertaste. Mouthfeel, overall, is above reproach. This stout does leave a gentle weight in the stomach, however, which - when combined with limited smell - detracts from total drinkability."
"Good."
"Always liked Guinness the best, but I poured a Guinness, a Beamish and a Murphys side by side and taste tested them all. Murphys had the better nitro show, a more distinct and pleasing aroma, a slightly sweeter and more satisfying taste. The mouth feel was nicce on all of them. I can't see how anyone could call it different"
"awesome cascade action after cracking it open. settles as a solid black with a creamy tan 1/2 inch head that sits there the whole drinking session. light aroma of roasted malts and coffee. the taste is lightly sweet, with roasted malt and light coffee flavors. the texture is light and creamy and goes down too easily.if you want something that goes down the hatch without effort and lends a nice pleasant taste while doing it, this is your stout. perfect session brew for me. and you. and your momma."
"I have drank this a few times in the last few weeks and hope it gets better each time I drink it but it dont.A very nice looking black with a good creamy head that stays but there isnt much aroma a slight roasted smell but not much there.Taste is on the dry side with some light roasted malt flavors but a little watery taste to it somewhat bland.My best friend just got back from Ireland and said Murphys was the cheap beer to get in the pubs there,of the big 3 Guinness,Beamish,and this of Irish dry stouts I give this the lowest rating."
"Wow, this one surprised me...if you like light beers, don't waste your time and try this offering. The appearance was outsatnding...a creamy head that lasts forever with a beautiful cascading efffect...almost pitch black in appearance. Smell was malty and inviting. Tatse had a touch of burnt malt with a somewhat watery mouthfeel, but the again, it's only 4.0 abv. Extremely drinkable. A very pleasant surprise I will try again."
"Not a bad looking beer nice black color, good head malty brown tint stayed for the whole beer. The taste of this stout was something different int had decent enough flavor, mild not to bitter. a solid stout nothing to fancy better than most. Not a thick beer but not to thin either!"
"This brew came on looking like a million bucks - dark, murky black with a delightfully creamy tan head that wouldn't give up and sincerely sticky lacing all the way to the bottom of the glass. The smell was of murkiness also. It gave me a sense of great earthiness, perhaps like peat in the bogs. The flavor was good, if not great, being less coffe-like and more like a weak chocolate. The feel was definitely thin and watery, but I'd still say the overall drinkability was above average. I guess I was expecting more of a Guinness ""bite."""
"Not bad. Not as much coffee taste as in most Irish Stouts. Pours a dark color with a really thick and creamy head that lasts throughout. The aroma is of coffee and chocolate - no surprises here. The flavor was pretty smooth with burned malt being the dominant flavor backed by coffee and chocolate. I enjoyed this beer, but not nearly as much as my beloved Guinness."
"This is a favorable alternative to Guinness, in my opinion. The brew pours a nice, dark brown, complete with huge, thick, creamy head. The aroma was redolent of chocolate, roasted barley and some slight hops. A very smooth beer. Easily quaffable. Nice rounded taste, roasted grains, chocolate and hints of coffee like notes. Mouthfeel was above average, not as thin as Guinness, but not quite as hearty as Victory or others. Seek this one out if you like other comparable stouts - you will most likely enjoy this one."
"This was a great stout. A nice pitch dark beer with a wonderful head. It had a wonderful roastiness that would make this a great beer in the morning. I would drink this instead of coffee. It may make getting to work harder though. This was on tap at, get this, Murphy's Jazz Cafe. A very drinkable stout. One of my favorites."
"The drinkability of the Murphy's is just great...smooth, creamy and strong enough in flavor that it is very savory. I can't recommend it enough to folks discovering stouts or expanding their dark beer experience."
"Arrived at my table with the wonderfully thick head that really looked great. It was perched atop the black brew and laced like there was no tomorrow as I drank it. Aromas of roasted coffee and nuts, with a little bitter chocolate and toffee thrown in for good measure. As for the taste, there's still nothing quite like that first sip of a good stout with the creamy head smearing on your lips. The aromas translate nicely into the flavor. All sorts of toasted flavors are evident, and just a whiff of smoky flavor is noted. All of these flavors are lovingly slathered in the creamy smoothness that coats your palate. Mouthfeel is very creamy and it's one easy-drinkin' stout. Can't go wrong with this one. It'll hold its own against Guinness."
"I will stick to the tap version of this stout. I have never seen it in a bottle in California. I am curious about the bottle flavor. I'll find it."
"Mild aroma in a black body with an energetic head of light brown fine bubbles. Near the top of the head below the beer line a continuous flow of small bubbles can be observed. No carbonation in the taste and very smooth for a stout. Some coffee flavor but it is not overwhelming. Clinging vine lace adorns the side of the glass. It is a very nice smooth stout that I found myself liking more and more after each taste."
"It's always good to find this in an Irish Pub. It is also good to have this before noon. It poured black, with not quite a head. It had a good sweet taste, with coffee and a hint of caramel. It went well with breakfast. In fact, I prefer it for breakfast over Guinness or coffee."
"The nitro cans are good for one thing and one thing only. A sweet cascade pour. Murphy's certainly had that. It poured out like a milkshake that had to settle at the top, not the bottom. It settled into a kind of unnatural looking beige colored head. The smell was pretty indistinct with some sweet stoutish aromas and definite malt characteristics, but certainly lacking. The taste was full of coffee, but that was about it. No bitterness, or dryness that a dry Irish stout should have were present. The mouthfeel was also severely lacking. The is a very watered down feeling from nitro cans that I do not ever get when drinking tap. It is not something I relish."
"Id have to say the best part about this stout is pouring it into a pint glass and watching the waterfall effect as the foam cascades up and the liquid precipitates out. The head ends up a fairly thick tan, with the consistency of slightly watery whipped cream. The smell at first is nothing but coffee, while upon further inspection there is a hint of hops and malt. It ends up smelling rather like a regular macro-brew. The feel of this beer is not exactly pleasant in the mouth. Although smooth, it feels thick and creamy, almost like drinking half and half. The taste is also immediately identifyable as coffee, and there's really not much more, besides a slight twinge of hops at the beginning that fades too quickly. The aftertaste is almost metallic, although it ends up tasting, again, like coffee. This is by no means a complex brew, and if you were looking for this taste, I would reccomend an iced cappucino."
"OK, I don't have a lot of experience with stouts, especially the more popular varieties (never reviews Guiness for instance). I have had the Storm King and Samuel Smith's, and these were quite good, so I was a little nervous to try this one, which was arrived in the form of a four-pack of 14.9 oz. thin cans. The pour was fascinating--what a cascade! It settled eventually into an impervious, dark brew with a beautiful espresso foam head. The coffee motif continues strongly into the smell, but loses vigor in the taste, which I found simply flat and dull--and there was no finish to speak of. That's about it; thankfully it was a gift."
"It smelled like a mochachino, like chilled roasted coffee. It tasted roasted, and bitter, like malt and coffee with hints of chocolate. The flavor was strong at first, then the bottom fell out a little, and it finished with a bitterness that was just about right. Somehow, in between the first sip and the bitterness, it was almost like water, except for the creamy mouthfeel. It went down pretty fast. It's a great beer to share with a co-worker in the local Irish Pub with lunch on a rainy Friday."
"This is the perfect example of a great Irish stout. It pours a dark, almost black color with a thick creamy tan head. The aromas were of dark roasted malt and coffee. Taste if full of roasted malts and dark roasted coffee beans, with mild undertones of hops and chocolate, which leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy; an extremely easy drinking stout. This is a must have for any stout lover."
"Pours a viscous dark liquid with no translucency at all. a very dense brownish head forms and fades in its size until settling at about 1.5 inches. An acute smell is let off at a distance reflecting its rather bitter but slightly chocolaty taste: No excess carbonation but a rather thick feel within like screaming ""hey, you're drinking me"" as it varies from bitter to smoked to chocolaty. Not all bad but its not my style."
"This was so boring. I like stouts, but this is down on the bottom of the pile with Guinness (a bit below actually). I really couldn't gather a lot of flavor from the beer. It tasted a bit thin and the mouthfeel felt a bit thin as well. It's quite sad, actually."
"Pours near black in color with a tall creamy light tan colored head that lasts a remarkably long time. Nose is rather faint but there are notes of burnt coffee. Moderate in body and definitely lighter than I was anticipating by its looks. Taste is also a bit on the passive side with flavors of roasted dark malts, bitter coffee, and a mild trace of hops. All in all, a pretty boring beer."
"It's a nice day outside, so I was easily persuaded to go have a pint at lunch. Got roped into going to the over-priced pseudo-Irish pub, so I had a Murphy's. Very clear, and a little ""light"" in the sense that light penetrates this beer a little easier than some stouts yielding that stout-standard ruby red glow. Creamy mouthfeel, light roasted flavor with just a hint of buttery notes, and a very low, kind of undetectable hop presence. Supremely drinkable."
"My Nitro-can went well. A creamy looking tan head forms and cascades through the black brew, it puts on a very nice show. The head thickens to form a half inch pillow. The aroma is of chocolate, cold coffee. The taste is a roasty chocolate balanced by a slight hop accent. The drink is smooth although the body is lighter, watery mouthfeel. The mouth is left with a dark chocolate hint of bitter. I'd give this a slight edge over Beamish, but both very close & very good."
"My first instinct is to compare this to Guinness. I actually think the only difference is that Guinness is a little more well known. It has the look you'd expect from a nitro can irish stout. Black with a creamy tan head. There is a strong coffee aroma and the taste is more chocolatey. At 4.0% alcohol you would expect this to be a good session beer. Well thanks to the creamy head the drinkability is spectacular which shows that this was intended to be a session beer. Not the best stout, but if you can find it cheap than this is a great beer to take to parties ao you can enjoy it all night long when everyone else is drinking coors light."
"Had this one at the Thistle Euston Hotel in London. Dark brown, not quite black, forming a decent, creamy light tan head with good retention and sparse lacing. Aroma is very weak... lightly fruity with subtle notes of vanilla and roasted malts. Mouthfeel is thin and soft. Taste is of burnt malts, but in a pleasant manner, with hints of licorice, wood, and black patent. Finish is lightly bitter and woody. A decent stout on tap, but not nearly as good as Guinness or Beamish."
"Drinkability  If I want to pound beers, this may be good. I have not wanted to do that in a decade."
"Big stubby brown bottle: Color pours out a dark red-toned black with some highlights but not much light gets through it. Head was very foamy, frothy and whipped cream looking and off-white, close to getting light brown in color with some large bubbles and divets. Smell is mostly roasted malt tipping towards a burnt/toasty mocha or chocolate thats faint and soft. Taste is creamy smooth in its bitterness that lends itself to a roasted/toasted malt thats just a hint of chocolate cream or toffee flavored. Feel is creamy smooth, almost velvety with a lingering smooth bitterness thats dry and sweet. Super awesome feel. Drink, and drink some more. Pretty decent stout and would like to see this offered more at places that think Guiness is the stout to be drinking, cuz this is a slightly better offering."
"It loses a point or two out of the can for both appearance and mouthfeel. The nitro effect is still cool, but it is just not the same as it is at the pub. The mouthfeel is a bit more watery as well."
"Yeah, Murphys is a nice pint. Id choose this over Guinness. Its a little lacking in mouthfeel (its only 4% though) and I could do without the apple flavor, but its still a good stout."
"This beer poured from the nitro tap and beautiful dark black with a very nice brown head that lasted for a long time. The aroma was average and the biggest disappointment. The beer had a very flavorful malty chocolate flavor. The mouthfeel was creamy and full bodied. I find this stout much more drinkable than Guinness. I would recommend this beer to a new stout drinker trying to discover what a stout should be."
"Fluffed, albeit thin bodied. Nonetheless, this is drainable all night long...or until boredom catches up."
"Pours out of the nitro can with an ultra creamy dark cream-colored head that lasts 'til the last swallow. Liquid is practically opaque, shows some deep ruby highlights when held in front of a lightbulb. Nose has a nice bitter roasted barley with a small amount of smokiness to it. Taste is tangy and dry, with great roasted barley flavors, minute amounts of coffee and more smoky hints. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Finishes long and and smooth with a bitter dry note...much better than Guinness and a pleasure to drink on this St. Patrick's Day!"
"happy st. patrick's day!"
"Good Irish stout though not as good as Beamish..on par with Guiness Draught."
"It's pitch black. The head is the usual nitrogenous thick and creamy sort. Always a pleasure to admire the appearance of these stouts. I didn't get much out of the aroma, a little bit of roasted maltiness. Tasting this reveals a sweeter stout that it's competitors. It's quite pleasing. The smoothness and high drinkability is there of course. Roasted malts are pretty much the entire flavor, with some bitterness coming in on the dry finish. I enjoy this a lot more than Guinness, and just a tad more than Beamish. I really like O'Hara's Irish Stout when it comes to this style. But this is definitely a brew I will be going back to on many occasions."
"Living in Boston I have grown to loathe Guinness, Murphy’s is now my choice at many of the Irish pubs I may walk into. Murphy’s has a full flavor without too much bitterness, the creamy smoothness makes me want to quaff more than just a couple pints. It has the trade mark appearance of any other Irish stout but hands down it is the best as far as flavour."
"Remembering when Murphy's stout was a rare find, I decided to warm up at a local establishment which has been serving it for years and years and to have a few while catching some sports action. Server had done a fine job with the pour of this Irish beer with one of the very best stout lacings to be had. Aroma does not play a large role, but the appearance is superb. Dry though its taste and afterwards, with roasted grainy taste on the subtle side. Great *Irish* stout (not to purposely compare with some very great domestic varieties). As much as I enjoy Guinness (has its roastiness been toned down of late?), I am very appreciative that this brew from Cork has its place among the taps."
"A good beer, I'd place it just behind Beamish/Guiness and wouldn't hesitate to order it again."
"The appearance is excellent: deep black with a ""pancake batter"" light tan head that leaves a coating down the glass. The aroma is very modest (dark malt). The taste is not extremely rich or thick, but is of dark malt; there is only a trace of hops. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, though a bit thin. The drinkability is excellent, and I can drink this all night with no ill effects. I have tasted this side by side with Guinness at Irish pubs, and I can tell the difference, but I really do not have a strong preference for one over the other."
"Beautiful nitro-head of light tan foam atop a rich, dark red chestnut beer. The aroma is faint, but is a bit of a hop floral smell. The atse is also light, with roasted malt and chocolate notes. There is a good sweetness to it, followed with a nice hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is smooth and light, with minimal carbonation. Drinkability is near excellent. A solid Irish Stout."
"Nitro-can encouraged frothy tan head, superb retention, some lace, almost opaque hue. Light but pleasant nose, clean, hints of roasted malt. Pathetically watery, weak roasted malt, whisper of coffee on the palate. Mouthfeel equals water thus it is easy to drink but not enjoyable to drink. Murphys is well below its nitro-Stout brothers (Guinness and Beamish). I will not bother with this one again, not recommended."
"The taste starts with a creamy maltiness and background flavors of coffee and bitter chocolate. The finish is black malt and roasted barley with notes of chicory all combining to create a dry bitterness. The aftertaste has some notes of coffee and carmel. Not as bitter as its cousin Guinness. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with a warmth to it. IMHO Murphy's tasted a hair better than Guinness (less bitter) but for the most part they are about the same for me. If you don't have anything better than I will have one type beers. Murphy's only low point to Guinness is it's visual appearance."
"Nitro bottle, pours thin black color, creamy foamy tan nitro head, light roasty aroma. Roasted malt flavor, has a dry semi bitter finish, thin and watery mouthfeel, like Guinnes and Beamish IMHO they are overrated and pretty weak."
"The prototypical stout color that I love, deep brown to ebony, the head impressive, the consistency creamy, the lace a latticework to coat the glass. Toasted grains, earthy, coffee all rolled up in one fine nose, the start is sweet and the top middling in mouth feel. Finish is scarcely carbonated; the hops quite pleasant and dry as a bone aftertaste make it a quaffable brew. ""Bottled Stout", but much better from the ""Cask"". Alas, this is getting to be a ""RARE"" thing these days."
"I am a real big ""fan"" of Guinness, but I would put this on a pedistool with it. At some of the places I have had it at, it's actually better than Guinness. Has a nice hearty taste and feel comperable, sometimes even better than Guinness. It's a good strong stout, with an ""earthy""/coffee taste to it. It's kinda funny, the more I like coffee, the more I dig Murphy's. Has a nice thick head, which I call the ""bitter barrier"". Mine was like 3/4 inch thick. The body was a good solid black color. Great after taste of nuts/chocolate. If you are a fan of Guinness, you will most definately enjoy this. If you don't, then I am sorry."
"Much like a Guinness only with a bit more flavor and doesn't seem as dry. Both pour very similar pitch black bodies with bone white heads. The head stays consistent through and leaves a beautiful lace. I only pick up slight hints of coffee or chocolate, just a bit more than Guinness. It would be very interesting to try both of these head to head on tap. I think Murphy's might edge it out in my book"
"This beer pours into the glass a brown/black color. The head is a beige/tan color, semi thick and lasting. The aroma is of coffee, malt, and hints of chocolate. The taste is of coffee, chocolate, and a sweet malt. Kind of reminded me of that other Irish Stout, Guinness. Not a bad drink."
"Has a very good mouthfeel and head retention due to the nitro can. Many don't like the nitro cans, but I love them. Slightly bitter, and even slighter roasted malt elements of flavor. Noticeable dry chocolate/coffee flavors too. Dark color but not opaque. My girlfriend has a lot of family in Ireland so she's been there a few times. She says alot of the bars are either full of guiness fans or murphys fans. I can see why; their tastes and qualities are that close. I think I like Murph's a little more though."
"Nice looking beer with nice head that settles down rather easily. Malty flavour and a bit mild. Mouthfeel was very very thick and creamy. Nice brew and probably the next best alternative for guinness."
"Almost opaque ruby-brown, huge creamy head, faint burnt malt nose, dry with some malt sweetness in the background, light body, roasted malt flavor with almost no hops, light dry roasted malt aftertaste, watery. I was disappointed with the lack of ample flavor and body."
"Has a good show of a nitro can with a creamy biege foam that settles into a tan/cream head with a brown to black base.  As with this dispensing system, virtually no aroma, but eventually gives a coffee-like scent.   Taste has a lot of malt bitterness in front of the dark malts, but not overpowering or unpleasant.  Pretty simple overall, and not particularly complex, yet pleasing in its own way.  Finish has a coffee like bitterness with a fair amount of lingering.  Nice creamy smoothness to the drink with adequate mouthfeel.  I'm usually not a big fan of nitro-cans, but this is better than most."
"The beer was a very dark brown, nearly black, and barely and head because of my dysfunctional widget do-dad. Light malty smell along with toasted grains. That was the low point. Tastes great! Toasty beer which was relatively light on malt flavors. This was made up for by smokiness. Perhaps a little thin body and a slight metallic aftertaste. Otherwise, great dry finish and lingering bitterness."
"It starts out with a creamy tan head, and a dark brown body.  Not a bad beer, but it is not that substantial, not really much to say in the hop department, however, I can say that it is a good session beer."
"Okay, okay, I'll admit it: I'm a sucker for nitro-draft stouts, and Murphy's is no exception. Viscous black color with a thick tan froth. Coffee and chocolate aromas. Mouthfeel is as creamy as it looks. Flavors of mocha and cocoa, with a hop bitterness toward the finish. Couldn't be easier to drink. Sign me up."
"Again while in New Zealand, this beer on tap was soooo good. It was between dark brown and black with a heavy pale light brown foamy head. A mixure of chocolate and malted barley's with a smoky under tone set this beer on top of others. Also, it was very, very thick when poured in to a glass. To enjoy this beer you have to aquire a taste for this brew. Tried it here and struggled through the can. Yuck!"
"Served to me in a chilled glass---far too cold for a stout IMO.  The black color and thick creamy creamy head (which lasted the length of the beer and left excellent lacing) beckoned to me.  The aroma was chocolate and roasted malt.  The flavor was more of the same, although there was a hops presence the smell did not elude to.  The drawbacks were that the flavor did not last as long as I expected and there was not near the dry finish that I expect and enjoy (could have been too cold?).  Aside from these points, it is an excellent beer and well worth the money to try.  Is it better than Guinness?  I don't think so, but it holds its own."
"A very good stout.  Full flavor with less of the roasted malt aftertaste of a Guinness.  Very easy to drink.  Not as complex as most micro-brewed stouts, but a classic nonetheless."
"I had the can version. I was a little unimpressed with this one. As far as a comparison with Guinness, I thought this had a more bitter taste and a thinner body. Any points gained by the widget were lost by being a Heineken beer. Just get a Guinness can or Beamish can if you have the choice."
"Now I need to find some of their Amber."
"not quite what i had expected. for an irish stout, this one was a bit toned down. it was not as creamy and thick as others i have downed. however, it's somewhat lighter body was enjoyable and unique. i'd get it again"
"My review for this beer will be very similar to the review of StevieW just below mine. The pour was beautiful from the nitro can, but I was surprised that the head wasnt thicker and creamier. The beer wasnt as thick as expected either, but still tasted excellent. Will definitely buy this again, its an excellent stout."
"Nitro bottle....Nice jet black color as you would expect, but the head on this one was very thin and lacked the creamy, fluffy, fullness that the other nitros produced. Not sure, if this is good or bad. Heavy roasted coffee smells, more than guinness. Nice dry flavor on the finish, less sweetness on the finish. Lacked the creamy smoothness of the guinness nitro. Overall very tasty, a bit thinner than expected, but very good. I think it will be much better on tap...."
"The nitro / CO2 mix facilitates the typically dense and well - retained beige head.  The head is thicker than other canned nitro Irish stouts.  Deep garnet in color and very clear when held to light. Light chocolate malt and roasted barley sharpness in aroma.  When combined with the subtle and pleasant diacetyl the aroma is more pronounced than nitro can Guinness.  Flavorwise, Murphy's is soft and balanced-- The hop and roasted unmalted barley bitterness is mild for style, but residual sweetness is low as expected for a dry stout. Chocolate malt provides complexity and makes this beer bittersweet overall.  Unfortunately, the mouthfeel and body was a bit thin.  Murphy's finishes clean, dry, w/ lingering roasted grain bitterness.  It's a decent stout for sure, but as far as canned nitro stouts go, Beamish remains the best, IMHO."
"Deep dark black.  Similar looking to Guinness, but not quite as deep dark and mysterious.  Extremely smooth, like drinking a cool refreshing milkshake.  Sweetness adds to its texture.  Finishes dry with a slight pleasant bitter roasted flavor.  Superior to Guinness in my opinion."
"Weakish flavoured stout, slightly watery, but the roasty coffe chocolate flavour is there, its decent but not great."
"Can a stout smell thin? Aroma lacks the richness I expect from a stout.  Appearance is right - cascading bubbles from the nitro widget, settling into a nice beige head on top of a black-ruby body.  Taste is fairly blah, even considering it is a nitro can. Balanced and smooth to a fault.  Thinner to taste than I remember. NO real roastyness. Can indicates now brewed at Whithead UK instead of in Cork. The purchase by Heineken may finally be taking a toll on this fine, but once finer, stout."
"Haven't had the Guinness version of this yet, so I can't make the comparison. But I was pleasantly surprised that this was decent and drinkable. I typically don't care for the astringency that nitro widget brings to the beer. That being said, this was as good as any similarly packaged simulated draught beer. I prefer the draught version."
"The best nitro-can out there IMO. I've had it on-tap once and I feel it edges Guinness just a bit. I really like the aroma, it smells sweeter than it is. A tad-bit thinker than Guinness nitro-can."
"Creamy fresh 3/4 inch head, doesn't cascade downward like a Guinness nitro.  Some chocolate hints in the smell.  Extremely smooth and with a taste reminiscent of cream itself.  Needs more of a dark roasted malt flavor and more bitter mid mouth tastes to be a better Irish Stout in my opinion.  Very drinkable but not better than OK to fairly good."
"A good draught. Aromas give off burnt malt and coffee and chocolate flavors. The same aromas can be tasted on the palate but a very dry finish. Very nice creamy, milky, smooth mouthfeel and overall very drinkable. Very comparable to Guinness...at least that's what I think."
"Roofing felt black (running out of descriptors) with the standard widget cascade and whipped cream head. A flash of sweet malt turns roasted barley immediately, ending dry tart with background bittering hops. Normal Irish stout fare. Wouldn't bother if Guinness was to be had."
"Pours a beautiful dark color with a nice creamy head.  Roasted malts and slight burnt chocolate in the nose.  A creamy mouthfeel with plenty of roasted malts and just enough burnt chocolate and coffee flavors.  A nice hop bitterness to balance everything out.  Nice and drinkable.  A great beer all in all.  I have never had this on draught and can't wait to try it.  As far as a draught can goes this was even better than I expected."
"55"
"This beer really took me by surprize.  It was gorgeous in the glass, pitch black against a pure white head.  The head really deserves mention.  Frothy bubbles, gives it a real draught personality.  Very elegant.  However, it's other characteristics were lacking.  The taste was hardly stout.  Resembled more to a watery/beery cappuccino.  This might sound bad,  but to me it really wasn't.  Would have liked more complexity, but this beer remains unique in its own right.  Extremely mellow."
"I don't have too much to add that others haven't said, but it deserves better than guinnessguy's rating down there, so I'll put in my .02.  It's a damn smooth Irish dry stout from a can.  Mighty tasty."
"In my opinion ... comparable to any other Irish stout that hides its flavour behind a creamy, milky, nitro-induced mask. They might not have the marketing muscle of Guinness, but still worth a try for what it is."
"Nice and creamy...one of my favorites. The used to be a crappy little restaurant in Peabody that served 26.oz Drafts of Murphys. Now it has turned into a TexMex place. Boy do i miss that crappy little restaurant."
"Very satisfying.  nice and creamy, and tasty too."
"Excellent stuff here, though not quite up to Mackeson XXX Milk or Sam Smith Oatmeal's standard."
"I liked this stout's balance.  Fairly creamy at the front, but finished dry, typical of Irish stouts."
