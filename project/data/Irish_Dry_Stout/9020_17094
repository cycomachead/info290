3.36,-9.2,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"overall: A very session-able stout, on the watery side for the style but at 3% you could drink these all day and not feel them. Decent flavor's but nothing too strong or aromatic, on the tame side for a stout, even a lower abv.","Roman5150","Mar 28, 2013"
3.84,3.8,4,3.75,4,3.5,3.75,"M - Light to medium body. Light carbonation. A touch watery for the style at times.","TheSevenDuffs","Mar 23, 2013"
3.56,-3.8,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Stout poured a nice opaque black with a nice white head that dissipated quickly without much lacing. Malty aroma with overtones of roasted malt and chocolate. Taste like it smelled with a pleasant malt, dark chocolate and coffee. Dry roasted finish, true to style. Not many hops to speak. A few hops at the end would have made it a bit more enjoyable but this is a fine, drinkable stout.","John1985","Mar 21, 2013"
3.81,3,4.5,3.5,3.75,4.5,3.75,"overall: This beer has good flavor for a lower abv stout. The kinda thing that should be able to put guinness in it's place, but never will. Definitely lacks any chalkiness or earthy tones from the hops, but is pretty darn drinkable. Not sure if the flavors would come on too strong to session.. the malts are a bit charred-like and possibly keeps some of the other subtle notes shining through.","witster18","Mar 21, 2013"

4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Much better from the nitro tap at the brewery. Not only does it make it feel thicker and creamier on the mouth, but I think it brings more to the nose and perhaps the taste. Dominated with roasted coffee, a slight bit of smoke, and some cocoa. The taste has an underlying caramel, cocoa and coffee with some smoke and a bit of burnt flavor from black patent. The mouthfeel is greatly improved from the nitro. Overall a very good stout. What is most impressive is the flavor for such a low abv.","JayS2629","Beers"
4.03,8.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"O: Incredibly drinkable stout. Packs a punch in both smell and taste, especially for such a small beer in terms of ABV. Fresh from a trip to the UK, I can confidently say that Onward is as good as any sessionable stout that I sampled while there.","titosupertramp","0"
4.46,20.5,5,4,4.5,4,5,"Drinkability is fantastic. Easy going and inviting, this one just begs for a second glass before the first is even halfway done. An entire growler of this over the course of an evening would be no problem. Very happy with this one.","JohnQVegas","Feb 21, 2009"
3.83,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D- Pretty good. It has a pretty smooth taste. Flavorful with a clean finish. Could have a few of these. I would personally like to see Yazoo do an oatmeal stout rather than the Irish stout, but it certainly is good.","Misfit138","Jan 28, 2009"
4.35,17.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Easily one of the better stouts I've ever had. It's a shame this hasn't made it to widespread distribution and is only available at the Taproom (and a few bars around Nashville). It's easily one of Yazoo's better brews. I was terribly disappointed that there was no way to take any home with me.","Veryunclever","Dec 08, 2008"
4.28,15.7,5,4.5,4,5,4,"Drinkability is a tough one, it is quite flavorful, I want to rate this as being very drinkable, but I need to have more than 1 and 1/2 of these to judge if the flavor becomes too much.","treble","Nov 11, 2008"
4.28,15.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,5," Although rich, the beer was very drinkable....I only wish I could have left with a few growlers of it. However, I was told that due to it being a nitro stout that they were unable to do so.","jxhowell","Aug 09, 2008"

3.07,-17,4.5,2.5,3.5,2,3,"M/D - Thin bodied and an almost flat feeling. Just does not feel like a stout in the mouth. Decent taste which does make it drinkable, but I feel it is much better on standard tap.","ckeegan04","Jun 22, 2006"

3.45,-6.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Little to no head in the one I tried, but I think that was because the bartendress over filled it, I did get a tan ring to form. Dark in color, but you can pick up a little ruby color even in its center, yep it looks Irish anyway. The smell is of roasted malts, coffee and chocolate. More of the same in the taste, it almost seems like a darker roast that is in some stouts, the coffee malt was quite bitter, I think that is what stood out most about this beer to me. There is a slight hop zing in the background. I felt like the mouthfeel was a bit gritty, no so much chewy or creamy, I wasn't a big fan. I would put this beer in the ""worth a try"" category, but I wouldn't revisit it a lot.","dfried","Nov 29, 2005"
2.48,-33,4,3.5,2,3,1.5,"Of all the beers in the sampler served at their taproom, I anticipated liking this one the most and was sorely disappointed. The beer poured with an opacity and creamy tan head that were true to the stout style(although I wouldn't consider this a dry Irish stout). The predominant smell was one of charcoal which was my first hint that I would not care for this beer. No other scents could be detected due to the overall burnt character both in the nose and on the palate. I've tasted and enjoyed smoked porters and stouts before, but they were much milder than this. It literally tasted as though liquid smoke was added to the glass. I don't think storage, temperature, or age were to blame as it was sampled at the brewer's taproom, so I have to assume that it was a legit representation of their beer. I'm much more a porter/stout fan than a hophead, and I literally had to choke down the small sampler glass. I spent 2 weeks in Ireland last summer, and through exhaustive personal research, really got a feel for what a proper pint of Irish stout should taste like. This wasn't it. Stick with the Sly Rye Porter, Dos Perros, or the Pale Ale when visiting Yazoo. I will be in Nashville soon, and will give it a 2nd chance. I'll update if hopefully, change is noted.","veech","Nov 04, 2005"
3.33,-10,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Drinkability: I hate to rain on this parade of accolades as I am a big fan of local beers but this is an unimpressive stout; really more like a porter if the truth be told; I had high expectations and saved this one for the last of the four Yazoo brews I tasted on my Nashville trip but I cannot say that any one of them passed muster in my view; a real shame as the brewery is trying some unusual recipes but all of their beers seem to lack body","brentk56","Oct 24, 2005"

4.3,16.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I could easily drink a growler of this stuff and never get bored. Some beers I feel like the full impact of them is only on the first sip and smell. This one keeps on challenging the palate and rewarding subsequent pours!","fromage","Mar 19, 2005"
4.71,27.3,5,4,5,4.5,5,"Onward Stout, what can be said about this beer that will serve it justice. This is by far one of my favorite stouts. It has a nice tan head and is almost jet black in appearance. It has got a great coffee flavor and exceptional mouth feel. I know a lot of people try this at the Flying Saucer but if you get a chance try it from the source; you will be even more impressed by this amazing beer.","IPABrewer","Mar 19, 2005"
4.18,13,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"A very tasty stout, not the best I've tried, but definitely worth drinking another time.","otfiddler","Nov 01, 2004"
4.38,18.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Very interesting stout. Certainly not as heavy as an Imperial, but quite complex. Very smooth, with strong coffee and malt tastes. It almost reminded me of a cup of espresso (especially in the little 5oz glass in the build-your-own sampler at Nashville's Flying Saucer). Appearance was a nice dark black, but the subdued lighting in the bar made it difficult to discern subtleties about the appearance. Smell was not as strong as I normally enjoy, but a larger glassful in a quieter setting may be more revealing. Very enjoyable beer that I would certainly recommend if you can find it.","JiminKY","Apr 12, 2004"
3.9,5.4,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Had this on tap in Nashville. Pours a very dark color with a moderate white head that leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of chocolate and a little coffee - good malt character. The brewer told us he uses English pale malt, roasted barley, black patent, and flaked barley for this one. Along with EKGoldings and Target hops. It is very well balanced and has a great finish. Great beer.","clvand0","Beers"
4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"On tap at the Flying Saucer. Creamyness and dry tartness spot-on for the style. A very prominent smoked malt flavor. I've never had an opportunity to smell burning peat, so I don't know if that is what was used, but this seemed to me to be a hardwood smoke, maple burned in a fireplace comes to mind. The smoked malt, while fairly assertive, is not overdone and adds a nice depth to the beer. Very nicely done.","Brent","0"
