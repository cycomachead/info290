Might be that I just prefer my dark beers to be on the sweeter side (like the Snowblind doppelbock from the same variety pack--holy crap, that one was good.)  If you like your dark beers dry and roasty rather than sweet and sticky, I'd give it a try.","Pantalones","Feb 12, 2015"

It carries nice toasted malt onto the palate, backed up with some assertive hops and some serious effervescence for a stout, which adds a lively mouthfeel and nice drinkability. This is a refreshing and enjoyable beer that would be a very good session stout as an alternative to Guinness.","malloyca","Feb 24, 2013"

3.87,9.6,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This one pours a deep, opaque cola brown, with a modest, fizzy but lasting tan head. The aroma is a fragrant combination of coffee with milk, some nutty roasted malt, and a small hint of chocolate. The flavor features more of the same prototypical stout characteristics with a really nice dry, roasty malt profile. The medium body is a bit syrupy, but it doesn't get in the way of the flavors. Overall, this beer surprised me by providing a decent depth of flavor without feeling heavy.","devilben02","Sep 04, 2012"

None of the sweetness of the nose is present here, exacerbating the one-dimensional nature of this beer. Some hop bitterness is perceived as well, especially on the finish. While I know that dry stouts are, by definition, dry, they needn't be watery, which this one is. Moderately carbonated, this beer is too watery for its own good. I can't recommend it, but if it were cold and it were a hot day out, I might pound a couple.","DefenCorps","Apr 14, 2012"

It pours an opaque black-brown topped by a finger of thick tan foam that, unfortunately, dies away pretty quickly. The nose is kinda faint, comprising some dark wheat and light coffee. It's not a bad smell, just a weak one. The taste holds notes of roasted malts, burnt wheat, coffee, and a hint of mild sulfuric sour. I know that may sound pretty damn bad, but it's like a more bad-milk-y version of the Guinness sour, as though SH tried to mimic the classic flavor and kinda failed. The body is kinda light, with a fairly high bite of carbonation and sonewhat watery feel. Overall, I assume this was meant as a nice, light, sessionable Irish stout, but it comes off as too light and can't quite nail the Irish qualities it aspires to.

Retained head well but the nose was a bit drab - coffee and bitter hops mostly, maybe some caramel in there. The taste was almost exactly the nose, not much but coffee and bitterness associated with the stout style ales, and towards the end it seemed almost like the coffee had staled or been burnt. Mouthfeel was a bit light for a stout, at least for me. Too carbonated and too light seem to go badly for this stout. All around, a typical stout without much character, and perhaps could stand some more aroma and a little thicker brew.","jaredvanderview","May 19, 2010"

It's actually very inviting when at the right temperature. Taste is pretty nice as well. The smoke is more complimentary to the rest of the flavors. Some light caramel along with chocolate that is a bit sweet and milky. A dose of roast coffee comes through as well, giving a light bitter finish.

3.2,-9.3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Received a dark brown/leather brown body w/ one-finger head that died quickly. An alright malty smell with some light fruit notes. A medium-bodied beer that had an alright malt flavor, not really able to key on a specific malt as it was somewhat bland. A light-dry finish as it goes down a tad slick for a stout. Mild fruit flavor also. Not a bad stout, but nothing spectacular.","clayrock81","Apr 26, 2008"
3.29,-6.8,2.5,3.5,4,2,2.5,"Out of the bottle the beer pours with quite a good lingering head. The color quite dark, perhaps black without the roasty shades of some beers in this style. I like the taste that was more bitter than I was expecting from even a dry Irish Stout. The mouthfeel is disappointingly watery as is the finish. Chestnut tones in the flavor and a light smokiness build cumulatively as you drink the beer.","maestrotmbg","Apr 17, 2008"
3.58,1.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall, this was a very drinkable Irish Dry Stout. I don't usually drink this style, but if I do, it will be the Dark Starr Stout.","Riverwarrior","Apr 15, 2008"
3.62,2.5,4,4.5,3.5,3,3,"Quite a dark stout with only a thin glint of reddish-brown at the edges when held to the light. Great aroma of whole coffee beans and chocolate. Flavor is lighter than the aroma, but adds some charred pipe character to the bitter roasted malt. Mouth feel is medium-to-full bodied, but I sensed a little thinness that made me want the creaminess of a nitro pour. Finishes with some burnt malt/ toast flavors with a mild reprise of the aroma. Good stuff.","dedrinker","Apr 13, 2008"

3.92,11,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured into a Guinness pint glass a near opaque black but for a bit of ruby tint when held to the light a thinner light mocha colored head is gone quickly leaving no tace of lace.The roastiness is more subdued in the nose than the palate it shows thru with some vanilla,char, and cocoa.Highly roasted on the palate like dark French roast coffee and bitter unsweetened chocolate with a hint of molasses the only sweetness this brew shows.This is one style of beer I like on nitro it rounds the beer out better,Iam sure this would be very good on nitro as is pretty good.","oberon","Mar 11, 2008"

3.86,9.3,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D: Because of its medium body, this is a very drinkable dry stout that is has plenty of fruitiness that is balanced with bitter chocolate and coffee flavors. A really enjoyable stout.","argock","Oct 30, 2007"
3.14,-11,4.5,3,3,2.5,3.5,"I've had Starr Hill stuff on two other occasions, once at a festival (Microfestivus, Roanoke, VA) and once on tap (Depot, Charlottesville, VA). Neither were this Dark Star Stout, and neither were that impressive. If Irish dry stouts are your thing, this probably won't qualify as an all-time favorite but it'll probably be worth trying once or twice. It's really not to my tastes, and it's got some good traits, but amongst others in the style I've had better. It sure looks hot though.","Metalmonk","Sep 11, 2007"

4.15,17.6,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Dark Starr arrives at the table a bit too cold in a pint glass, with a black body and a small, light brown head that reduces to a collar. It smells of sweet blue/blackberry jelly, coffee, chocolate and roasted malts, raisins, and maybe even strawberry. On the palate there are all these flavors along with leather, tobacco, apple?, lactose?, smoke, and green, almost piney/spicy hops that impart a mild bitterness. It has a light to medium body with equal carbonation, and leaves a medium finish. Overall it's a good stout, one I've had before and will have again, but I wish this particular pint weren't served so cold.","mmmbeer","Apr 17, 2006"
3.74,5.9,4,2.5,4,5,4,"I got this pint at Malones in Lexington, Va. It poured a very dark color. The head was small and very coffee orianted. The lacing that did appear left fast and the retention wasn't much better. The smell was essentially absent, but what I could sense was sweet. The tast was a really good coffee flavor. The mouthfeel was exceptional. It was rigid yet smooth and not thick. This was a great brew.","treehugger02010","Jul 09, 2004"
4.13,17,4.5,4,4,4,4.5," Balanced with Magnum (Bittering hops) and a clean tasting English Ale yeast OG 1.048 and a mild 4.75% abv make for a good session beer.","karst","Apr 28, 2004"
3.68,4.2,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"14oz glass presentation. After the nitro effect settled down, there was a pleasing 3/4" mocha/latte head over the dark brown/black opaque brew. Aroma of dark malts and coffee, and the flavor follows along these lines, with a somewhat sedate coffee character. Mouthfeel okay, albeit a bit thin, and the drinkability acceptable as well.","ppoitras","Jan 13, 2004"
4.1,16.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Color is an inky blackness. Single-finger thick layer of dense tan-colored head. Thick lacing of the glass with distinct rings. Aromas are yummy, with all sorts of chocolate and espresso with a toasty malt base to it. Flavor is classic dry irish stout. Great mix of roasty, toasty malt base with a dash of bitter baking chocolate. Smoky middle, followed by a long-lasting and slightly bitter finish. On the thick side in terms of mouthfeel, with a decent creamy factor. Quite drinkable and one I'd not hesitate to ask for again.","OldFrothingSlosh","Nov 07, 2003"

4.27,21,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Both the aroma and taste are controlled by a coffee and chocolate quality. In fact, when I was drinking this beer, I was looking around for the person drinking an incredible smelling coffee, no kidding. The aroma is that powerful. The taste follows very similarly to the aroma. It is dictated by coffee and chocolate. There is very little burnt, or typical dry flavors associated with many dry stouts (as the restaurant/brewery classifies it). Incredibly easy to drink. Very smooth and silky. This is the perfect after dinner beer.","philipt","Beers"
4.03,14.2,4.5,4,4,3,4.5,"Poured a deep, deep brown, with a thin creamy head. Smells strongely of toasted malt, with some nice coffee overtones. A smooth beer, starting with a nice malty chocolate flavor, with a mocha aftertaste. Very smooth, very creamy, but a little lighter than most people expect from a stout. Combines for a good drinkability, definitely a solid performer for an Irish-style stout.","kaszeta","0"
4.77,35.1,4.5,5,5,4,4.5,"Pours blacker than night with a thick creamy off white nitro head on it.  The aromas are all coffee, espresso, and chocolate with a surprising lack of burnt smells.  The taste starts off with some great coffee flavors and smoothly slides into a nice mocha/chocolatefinish.  Tons of roasted malts in this but no burnt bitterness is detectable.  Super smooth and creamy, it could just use a little more body to it.  Great drinkablity due to the incredible sily smoothness.  One of the better stouts I have had.  This rates right up there with the Mocha Java Stout from Z Street Brewing, absolutely awesome.","Murph","0"
