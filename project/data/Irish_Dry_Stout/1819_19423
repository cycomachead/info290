Color is a very dark thick brown, almost black. 1" light caramel color head that dissipated slowly over about 5 minutes and left thin lacing. Smell was chocolate with some fruity elements. Texture was very thick and almost creamy, which made it seem sweeter than it actually was. Taste had overarching chocolate tones, with nutty, sweet malt, elements of coffee and a dry citrus aftertaste. Very low carbonation.","boogieman","May 19, 2014"

2.96,-10,4,3,3,2,3,"Served as part of an eight beer sampler at GC in SLP, MN. Pour was black in color with a half finger of medium tan head. Weak aroma of dark, roast malt and oats. Taste was roasted malt, faint, faint coffee and chocolate, oats, grain. Body and mouthfeel were watery and light. Carbonation was adequate. Overall this is absolutely an entry level stout not far removed from ye olde classic Guinness (but for Guinness has a far superior body and mouthfeel).","JackieTH","Dec 02, 2011"

4,21.6,4,4,4,4,4,"GC did a pretty good job on their stout. The beer poured a nice rich black hue. Very tall tan head that exhibied that laced slightly. The initial scent can carry soy sauce aroma, but then the toasted malt and coffee come to fruition. The taste included roasted and nice coffee with very mild chocolate. The stout carried a medium in body, so so carbonation, a bit of dryness in the finish. Overall a decent stout. Probably second favorite.","WoodBrew","Jul 03, 2011"
2.24,-31.9,3.5,2,2,2.5,2.5,"Poured black, but a watered down looking black. Nice 1 inch head that lingered on and on. Weak smells of coffee, some chocolate, and some malt. Tasted like a watered down under carbonated root beer. A bit of licorice, malt, some roasts, and just the slightest sweet chocolate. Mouthfeel was extremely light, just slightly carbonated, and very thin. Overall, I'll never get this again. It's almost undrinkable due to the very thin mouthfeel.","1Adam12","Beers"
2.91,-11.6,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"T, M.The bittering is well-balanced with what little sweetness there is in this brew...It's just that, everything from the flavor, nose, and body seems overly thin and watery.

The aroma has notes of roastiness, coffee and chocolate. The flavor is mild with a definite dry, roasty flavor that reminds me just a bit of coffee. Caramel, toffee and chocolate come through as the beer warms. The flavors are an interesting mix of subtleties... complex, yet subtle... subtle yet not watered-down. The mouthfeel is smooth and silky... medium body with a creaminess helped along by the nitro. Overall a very drinkable dry stout. I've got to admit that this one surprised the heck out of me...

3.76,14.3,5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Upon my fourth or fifth visit to the wonderful Granite City establishment, I was pleasantly surprised to see one of the standard offerings available on cask. Surely I had to jump at the chance to taste. I will say, this is one of the most handsome brews I have seen in some time. It has a beautiful chocolate colored head that has a peppery cloudy look. If there has every been a head that you just want to eat, it would be this one. As you would expect, the color of the beer itself is dark as night while the nose is strictly limited to deep cocoa notes. Not a bad limitation. The mouthfeel is thick and velvety, certainly not out of the ordinary given the style and serving type. There are large roasted barley flavors on the forefront while faint chocolate and coffeeish notes linger. An oaken quality lends that handcrafted feel that is much appreciated. It finishes a tad roasty and dry, with that unmistakable cork-flavored background. Smooth and tasty, this is surely a cask driven brew.","Hhawk06","May 18, 2005"

The potency in the nose was weak, it was served too cold, only some light roasted malts found their way to my olfactory. The taste profile is solid, smooth roasted malts with a nice complement of hops, functionally and agreeably bitter from the hops and coffee taste. The mouthfeel was a smidge too thin.
