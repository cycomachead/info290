4.01,12.3,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"12 oz. bottle from BevMo. Black body with a frothy tan head that quickly dissipates. Flavors of black coffee, dark chocolate and burnt toast give way to a big malt base and a surprisingly dry finish. Extra carbonation for a unique mouth feel that helps the flavors dissipate. I think they achieved their goal: a tasty, yet light, session stout.","loubar","Feb 09, 2015"

3.18,-10.9,3.75,2,3.5,3.25,3.75,"Overall:  This is an ok stout.  There are some nice flavors of roasted malt and brown sugar-like sweetness, but in my opinion, there’s too much espresso, licorice and hoppy bitterness for me to really like it.  Further, I think the mouthfeel is too thin, as I like my stouts, to have a thicker, fuller, more viscous mouthfeel that this one has.  If the flavors of espresso, licorice and hoppy bitterness were dialed down some, and the mouthfeel was thicker, more vicious, it would go a long way to making this a better stout.","Jeffreysan","Jan 26, 2015"

3.81,6.7,,,,,,"Overall (3.81) : I'm beginning to find that any stout made right is a stout worth drinking. This is another example of that. There are extraordinary stouts, that make you go "WOW", and there are some that make you go "hey, it's okay." That's this one. It's not the greatest or most unique stout I've had, and it doesn't taste like a blue fin fish, so all I can say is that this stout is par for the course. Good drinking, maybe a bit planty compared to the other ones. Due to the abundant carbonation, it may be a good gateway stout for those who are stout-shy. Give it a try.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Oct 02, 2014"

2.69,-24.6,2.75,3,2.75,2,2.5,"Popping the top on this one I was surprised at the “poof” of air and slight sizzle of carbonation and unsurprisingly, poured straight into a large tulip I didn’t get a quarter of the way through the beer before a thick four finger head stopped just short of overflowing the rim of the glass. I’m not lying - it took nearly 15 minutes of letting the head die down and pouring a tiny bit more before the whole bottle was in the glass. Umm...maybe a bit over-carbonated, particularly for a style that tends towards lower levels of carbonation? Eventually things settle down into a tan one finger head with zero lacing. Color is almost entirely black (39), with perhaps just a hint of dark brown amber. Nose is moderately strong and essentially all about dark roasty notes, dark chocolate, espresso beans, and perhaps a touch of hazelnut. Sip is sweet dark chocolate up front with coffee notes all over the midpalate. Back of the tongue is somewhat thin and both tastes and feels a bit like club soda. Now may be as good as any time to point out that the massive carbonation in the pour is apparent in the taste and mouthfeel - Blue Fin Stout is vastly over-carbonated, much to its detriment, both for the style and for the overall effect on flavor. Subsequent sips see a slightly more nutty presence, but as a whole this is pretty one-dimensional and actually quite thin, both in flavor and mouthfeel. Finish is bitter dark chocolate and coffee. All in all, this is a pretty unimpressive stout which I would neither recommend nor pick up again. Furthermore, along with their IPA (which had some odd blueberry notes) this is a second beer from Shipyard that has left with unimpressed. (4-18-14)","8stringfan","Apr 18, 2014"

It starts quite sweetly and chocolatey but then as the hops kick in and it becomes more bitter it tends towards coffee. After a couple of sips I'm glad I let the wife have half of the bottle, but trying to be objective I can see this is fairly well done, just not my, er, cup of tea.","charlatan","Apr 06, 2014"

Smell is of dark roasted malt and some subtle cocoa and dark fruit aromas. Taste is of dark roasted malt with some minor cocoa powder flavor. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a high level of carbonation that is a bit too much in my opinion.

All that was left was a white circle of foam around the edges of the glass. Smell was appealing, with good notes of highly roasted coffee. Taste was not bad, but I've had better. Seemed like a lot of the flavors didn't meld well; everything sorta seemed jumbled. The roasted coffee flavor was too hidden by that odd sweetness. It also became cloying on my palate. Plus, I got an unusual buttery flavor from this beer at the finish. Lastly, this beer was just a bit too thin on the body.

It has an aroma of dark, roasted malt with a hint of sweetness. It's pretty light bodied and a little sharp on the tongue. The finish is dry and a touch chalky. The flavor is very simple: dark roasted malt. It's pretty dry and has a little hint of coffee at the finish. No hop flavor is detected and it doesn't really have any noticeable bitterness, except perhaps at the finish. The roasted flavor lingers. It's simple, roasty and sessionable. This is the kind of beer I like to use when cooking chili.","yesyouam","Sep 07, 2011"
3.92,9.8,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Picked up a growler from the Shipyard in Eliot, ME. Poured into a pint glass, the beer is jet black, with only a thin ring of milk chocolate colored, bubbly head. Aromas are strong, with a heavy roasted coffee base and the slightest hints of bittersweet dark chocolate. Flavors are rich and full, with a heavy, bitter coffee tone overpowering almost everything else. There is a slight nutty and smokey highlight throughout, also. The body is light, dry, and slick, which is perfect for the style. The aftertaste is short-lived, but in the span you get a blast of toasted oats and bitter, dark coffee, with a slightly drying and clean finish. Very tasty and smooth.","GarthDanielson","Aug 25, 2011"

It's a solid medium bodied stout with a very smooth, near Guinness like feel. The charcoal offers a near lemon bitterness with some dry finishing. It's quite easy drinking for the style, very likable, the best of the three brews I tried this day in Kennebunkport at Federal Jack's Brewpub.","Durge","Apr 25, 2010"

It's a pretty decent dry irish stout with a little hint of bitterness from hops, some creamy lactose, smoothness, and overall tasty.

There are the usual coffee mocha dark chocolate flavors that keep this stout true to style. Blue Fin is a must try on nitro tap and Federal Jack's does a great job of serving this beer. If it seems a little cold, enjoy it while holding the glass and it will warm nicely to open up deeper mocha flavors as well as summon the complex blend of bittering and aroma hops.

I'd like to give this one another shot, preferably on tap to really give it a fair shake, but until I get that chance I'll persue other stouts in its place. Its OK, but there are far better examples to be had.","BuckSpin","Mar 17, 2007"
3.97,11.2,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours totally black with a small beige head that did not last long. The smell is rich with roasted malt and has some sweetness to it. The taste is roasted malt and coffee with a mild, dry bitterness at the end. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, creamy and some tingly carbonation. Drinkability is good as this goes down quite easily. Overall, a nice, easy-drinking stout.","uconnalum2","Mar 17, 2007"
3.95,10.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a huge head that has to subside before I can pour enough to drink, this be due to the fact that it was closer to cellar temperature. There is a muted but dark almond/syrupy hue to the head, not at all white. In the light the beer is dark with reddish tints. Aroma is stout and roasty, american hops, and mostly hops, but some roasted aromas coming though, smells rather good. Taste is sweet and a big creamy, but less so than a milk stout. The finish is roasty and porter like without much harshness, not quite smooth and non-threatening, enough roast to be hearty but not so much to think "charred." The taste here is neither monochromatic (think guinness) nor ultra complex, but right in the middle, and this is a good thing. Mouthfeel is full bodied but more acidic than I'd like. There was yeasty sediment at the bottom of the glass so this may not be ultra filtered and that is a positive. Overall this is very drinkable beer, it would be a more of a winner if the sweetness was tamed a tad, so after a pint, the rest of the bomber wasn't so easy to finish, but it was rather tasty brew, and surprising as shipyard is not my favorite brewery by any stretch of the imagination. I'd buy this again.","Liquids","Mar 14, 2007"

3.88,8.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours as black as can be, with a huge, fluffy, dark tan head that dissipates fairly quickly to dusting and a ring. The aroma is relatively mild, with some nice smells that don't have the volatility to make them really sing. What is there: coffee, bananas, faint diacetyl. On the tongue, there's an initial hop bitterness that bites on the tongue, followed by a move toward the middle of the tongue, where some diacetyl and sweet/sour stout malts come out. Some fruits come out toward the end, with the finish being a bit sticky; it only dries out a little bit. Mouthfeel features voluminous carbonation, a bit of hop acid, and an active finish. Overall, this is a very nice stout; one of the better Irish dry stouts that is available in my area of the country. It's not terribly complex, but that's partially a feature of the style. Definitely worth a try, and if stouts are your thing, worth a session's worth of drinking.","geexploitation","Oct 12, 2006"

The taste, as the smell is very mocha with hints of coffee. A mouthful is quite delicious the flavor seems very consistent mocha all the way down. The aftertaste continues chocolatey and the hops start to come through getting a bit sweeter. The carbonation seems just right for the flavor.

As the beer breathes, spicy, peppery esters with an earthy hop twang arise. Welcoming aromawise. In flavor, incipient is milk chocolate sweetness, which is promptly contrasted by a combination of roasted barley and hop bitterness. More fruity than most dry stouts, with notes of tart plum adding depth. Smoky, almost peaty hints surface after a deliberation. Lightly bodied and true to form in its dryness. Roasted grain acidity augments over time, complementing plum esters. Finishes acceptly tart initially, but fades into lingering bitter coffee and dark chocolate hints.

Incredibly fruity aroma, some burnt roastiness too. Flavor contains a big black malt kick, some coffee, burnt toast, caramel, and raisin flavors. Hops add a smoky, herbal element, give the beer a nice earthy kick. A severe fruitiness is introduced by the yeast (Ringwood, I presume) and I have to say it overpowers the beer and isn't quite right for the style. A nice impy stout or Baltic porter often has some fruit elements, raisins, figs, plums, but here it doesn't quite work with the coffee roastiness. This beer has real potential but the yeast tweaks it in a way that I'm not wild about. Mouthfeel a bit fizzy, not the session stout I was hoping for; one of these at the end of the day makes a fine restorative, but I didn't reach for a second.","Thrasher","Mar 10, 2003"

4.55,27.5,4.5,4.5,5,4,4,"Damned tasty stout, seemed maybe a bit over-carbonated at first, well worth drinking more of it.","MaineBeerMan","Oct 07, 2002"
4.55,27.5,4.5,4.5,5,4,4,"On tap @ Federal Jack's in Kennebunkport. Pleasing deep dull black color. Foamy tan head matched nicely. Lacing was near perfection, rich creamy head stuck to your lips, glass, and everything else. Smell was subtle roasted chocolate malt and coffee bitterness. Taste was super smooth combination of the same, and crisp dry hoppy finish, as advertised. Chocolate taste is by no means over powering. Very good. One of my new all time favorite stouts. I bought 4 22 oz bombers for $1.50 each and carried them home to Florida. Great beer, great name, beautiful souvenier of my trip to Maine.","StevieW","Sep 08, 2002"
4.03,12.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a dark, rich mahogany with a dense brown head that dissipates but leaves a sticky lace on the glass. First impression is of bitter chocolate and burnt grain and heavily roasted malts with a bit of an oily hop resin on the back of the mouth. Definitely a dry style without the body and sweetness of a sweet stout. More guts than a Guiness, but lacks the depth of the full bodied examples of the style. Leave it warm a bit to improve it's flavor profile.","QXSTER1","Aug 10, 2002"
3.88,8.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours blacker than black with a decent brown head that fades very quickly.  Barely discernable hop and roasted/burnt malt on the nose.  The flavor starts off with some bittersweet dark chocolate and tons of coffee.  Fades slowly into a very nice coffee flavor that has a lingering finish.  Somewhat thin for a stout but very drinkable.  Not a bad stout but not a super one either.  Thanks to the Bierman for the sample.","Murph","Jul 12, 2002"
3.85,7.8,4,4,3.5,4.5,4,"Notes: Forget American Guinness ... this is a far better stout, better when on tap as the bottle tasted too filtered to me.","Jason","Apr 17, 2002"
4.66,30.5,5,4,5,4,5,"An awesome US made stout. In the inevitable comparison to Guinness, this one doesn't give away a thing.","John","Oct 23, 2001"
