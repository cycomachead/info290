"O - man this is killer. Dry Irish Stouts aren't usually knocking my socks off, but this absolutely does."

"Pours black with a half-finger of creamy tan head frozen in time. It has a milk chocolate smell with toasted oats, pecans, and cream, but I only pick up on those flavors if I stretch myself -- it's all rather subtle. The taste brings cocoa powder, coffee, burnt toast, and bitter hops. It goes down silky smooth with a super dry finish and is on the lighter side of medium in body."

"O- I'm such a sucker for stouts on nitro pour so my rating is a bit overly generous. Still, this is a fantastic beer and I highly recommend it, nitro pour or normal."

"Overall: Very nice dry stout and I love the pun"

"O: This is a great sessionable stout. The thin body bothered me a bit but this was overall very smooth and drinkable."

"Beer is a fully opaque black in color. Served with about s half inch of very stable, very long lasting, creamy rich tan colored head. Lots of lacing. Aroma is mostly roasted malts, with notes of toast, coffee, and slight hint of smoke. Taste is more roasted malts, creamy milk chocolate, mild coffee, and cocoa. Body is a bit thin, but the nitro gives this one an incredibly smooth mouthfeel. Moderate bitterness. Another quality beer from CCB."

"Overall: I thought that this was a fantastic brew. Very slick and easy to drink, with exactly the flavors I wanted. Not exactly a traditional Irish stout, but for what it is, I highly recommend it (at least on nitro)."
"O: Ok, a decent if not somewhat watered down example of the style just not amazing."

"On Nitro at the brand new Brass Tap in Gainesville. Awesome creamy kahki head on top of a pure black pour. Smells like chocolate syrup and not much else. Yum. Super smooth drinking, but a little watery for me. Dry finish and easy drinking. Not much flavor besides some vague roasted malt here, which is unfortunate after the incredible aroma. Wondering if they accidentally poured Guinness, though I know this is a dry stout. I just expected a bit more flavor on this one. Not bad but meh."
"O: Easily one of the finest nitro beers I've had, one of the best Irish dry stouts, beats the everloving shit out of Guinness, I want this beer to be available year round, across the planet so people can use this as a marker for the style."

"Medium-bodied at best, slightly watery throughout. Strong effervescence in the middle after a lighter start and a nice finish. Flavor is pretty good but I would like more heft to it and a bit more balance in the nose."
"High drinkability, I am not sure about the alcohol content as it is unknown, but it seems relatively low meaning this could be a great session beer."
"Overall: Good beer overall. This would be great on a cool afternoon. Give it a try."
"Overall: This is a very nice irish stout. Smooth, easy to drink with nice flavor."
"The beer is dark brown, nearing black. The head is thick and beige and leaves some random lacing on the snifter. The aroma offers dark fruit, smoke, and roast. The flavor is quite nice. Eight ounces down, this is likely the best Irish stout I have yet had. Light bodied and easy drinking, with spot on carbonation. I would definitely drink this again."
"(Original review posted 3/15/2011 when it was still called Patio Tools.)"
"Overall this is likely in my top three CCB beers I've had, and that's among some stout company. A very flavorful low ABV stout that's well worth a shot."
"O: Expected more flavor depth on this one, but I guess it was intended for easy drinking after working in the yard or while grilling outside. To that end, it's just fine, just not my thing. One positive is that it would be an easy dark beer for non-craft beer enthusiasts to enjoy."
"Overall, a very nice beer from CC."
"Serving type: on-tap"
"Taste is bitter roasted grains. Elements of coffe and bitter chocolate peek through a light body. Very drinkable, a really nice traditional style from CCB."
"Overall, I like it for what it is. A good beer, but not something I would want a lot of. Glad I got to try this. Now that I am done with my review, I am headed to the patio (but not to be a tool). Decent drinkability."
"I would like to taste this beer on Nitro sometime too guys..."
"Overall, this is just excellent for a style that often isn't that exciting. Supremely drinkable. This probably won't surprise most of you, but I had this next to a Guinness and it was not even close! The Guinness was way sweeter and less dry, more watery, and just less flavorful in general. Goes to show how good this beer is for the style."
"D: A nice easy drinking stout and one of the better offerings from Cigar City I've had to this point."
"Overall a very nice and light little stout. I would have no issue with polishing off multiple glasses, in fact the growler was gone in about 45 mins. Really very nicely done and something I am glad I was able to try."
"d - Overall I liked this one a lot. It was very easy to drink and had a nice subdued coffee taste to it. Feel like I could drink a lot of this with the low ABV."
"Had again two months later at the brewery, more coffee grounds, and yes dry."
"Although I felt that certain aspects needed to be fine tuned, this brew was very easy to drink and definitely an original take on a much-mimicked style."
"Poured on-tap at the Cigar City Brewing tasting room in Tampa. Served in a pint glass, the beer poured a jet black coloring, looking like motor oil in a glass. No head. The beer has coffee aromas, with a light and slight smokiness. The flavor is light coffee initially, with a huge blast of campfire smoke at the end. Aftertaste is all smoke, with a slight coffee bittering. The beer's finish is a moutful of campfire coals. Great, dry, and light bodied. Bravo!"
"Moved this over from a bad merge, the original review as made on 3/15/10"
"This is a very fine beer that shows that Cigar City can make great ""regular"" beers."
"O-this is an impressive and fair example of the style. i've had this a few times and every time I am satisfied. its a much more versatile stout that most. a lot of flavor from the ABV."
"Beer is a little thin but has a nice late bitterness to it. Mildly sweet on the front and a decent finish. A simple beer but done well. I enjoyed it and would have it again."
"Drinkability: It's a nice, easy drinking stout, it has good flavor and the purportedly low alcohol is definitely appreciated."
"The mouthfeel is fairly full bodied for an Irish Dry, and has the excellent drying on the end that's the hallmark of the style. The drinkability suffers just a little bit for an Irish Dry, for something that's usually a bit lighter bodied and easier to drink. Don't get me wrong, it's still a very drinkable beer, but it doesn't go down as fast as some in the style. A very good beer that I'm excited to see bottled."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours a nice dark brown with a slight tan, tight head.Smells of coffee and dark roasted malts. The taste is great! It's tough to describe but ""tight"" come to mind, probably the dryness of it. Also get notes of coffee with a slight smooth hop flavor. Mouthfeel is light to medium. Chalkboard said this was 5.2% abv which was perfect. Love this beer."
"D - Very nice, this is a really interesting alternative to the traditional black brew of St. Patrick's day. It has all of the roasted dryness expected of a traditional Irish stout, but it has so much more depth and complexity. The spicy notes of coffee and clove that I taste are something much more interesting that you would ever expect to find in an actual Irish stout, while the notes of chocolate are such a break from tradition that they almost seem out of place but end up being a very welcome addition. Despite being served on CO2, the beer finishes with a dryness that is every bit as profound as the classic examples of the style, and it effortlessly presents a thick, silky body that those beers need nitrogen to develop. A really nice dry stout and proof that Cigar City can turn out complex, excellent beer without having to do anything ""extreme""."
"Serving type: growler"
"D: Excellent. Damn fine stout, homerun when compared to other stouts of the same style."
"O: One of the strangest, and tastiest Irish stouts I've had in a long time. Also, it has the added benefit of being a style that is truly a guilty pleasure of mine."
