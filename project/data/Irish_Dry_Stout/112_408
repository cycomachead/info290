4.05,5.7,4.25,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Solid all around, and very affordable for the quality if purchased as a sixer at World Market. It is a perfect enhancer for all manly meals--pizza, curries, grilled burgers or sausages, pasta with red sauce. In an ideal world, this would be the basic stout served everywhere, with premium stouts offered where there are lots of taps. I enjoy drinking these North Coast brews that have no faddish flavorings but are simply beautiful products of a remarkable brewer who is an artist with the basics.","MartyMaltose","Mar 16, 2015"

3.94,2.9,5,4,4,3.25,3.75,"12 oz bottle.  Pours black with tall, long lasting, creamy, beige head and nice lacing.  Aroma is of bready malt, toast, dark fruit, coffee and brown sugar.  Body is medium, creamy and smooth.  Taste is of toasted malt, coffee, chocolate, brown sugar, dark fruit and herbal hops.  Finish is long and dry. On a sweet side but tasty brew.","mikeg67","Mar 11, 2015"

Dark malts dominate, with notes of dark chocolate and coffee and earthy hops adding to it. The taste is very similar to the aroma, just not quite as robust and forward.The body is thinner, has a hit of carbonation and a nice dry finish.","delta490","Feb 19, 2015"

Many complex flavors, including chocolate, coffee, and hazelnuts. A classic American made stout. Goes down so smoothly, low bitterness, and it makes you want the next sip. Great session beer and I am probably a bit biased because this was one of my first micro-brewed stouts and I'm glad to be reunited with it!","bigdeuce","Dec 28, 2013"

3.7,-3.4,4.5,3.75,3.75,3.25,3.5,"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a very dark brown with a one inch tan head, that leaves behind tons of lace. Smell is chocolate, coffee, bread, and toffee. Taste is all of that, chocolate being the dominant flavor really well balanced and smooth. Body is fairly light for a stout, plenty of carbonation, a little dry, and very drinkable. This is a solid stout, not earth shattering but nice.","SawDog505","Dec 07, 2013"
3.98,3.9,3.75,3.75,4,4.5,4,"Appearance is very nice, with a pretty black pour and I don't mean ruby. The head comes off as creamy and tan but doesn't stick around long. There is some lacing for the duration but not much. All seems straight forward but pleasant. Yes, as advertised, no mistaking that this is an Irish Stout. To the nose, you get plenty of malt, plenty of dark chocolate and some might say coffee but I got something along the lines of creamy black tea. The mouth-feel is nice and creamy with nothing overbearing, very light on the palate. The taste is once again straight forward and nothing ground breaking but still very enjoyable. Up front is the creamy chocolate, accompanied by mocha and very light expresso in the end. You will also be able to taste a lot of the malt and that's something I like in Stouts. All around a very nice beer although a bit on the pricey side here in Vegas. I'd buy it again if the price was right as this is a nice one but there are better choices out there. This is NOT a big beer and no way resembles a serious Imperial Stout. It's not complex and will remind you of most other Irish style Stouts but it still sits higher on the shelf than most. Recommended.","Khad","Dec 05, 2013"

This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, a little creamy, not to filling and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, I could see myself drinking a couple of these, it's a pretty easy drinking dark beer. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style it was, it's just what I want in an Irish Dry Stout. What I liked the least about this beer was the aroma, it wasn't bad, but it had a slight stale aspect to it. I would buy this again, and I would like to try a bottle that I know is fresh, I enjoyed it and it was priced well. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the style. All in all I was happy with this beer, it represents the style nicely and it's pretty easy drinking. Good job North Coast, I'll have to keep an eye out for more of your beers, keep up the good work.","StoutHunter","Oct 29, 2013"

Pours very dark brown, almost black color; with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of cocoa, chocolate, roasted malt, light char, toast, molasses, raisin, toffee, light coffee, and roasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity; decent strength. Taste of cocoa, chocolate, roasted malt, toast, light char, molasses, toffee, light raisin, light coffee, and roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of cocoa, chocolate, roasted malt, toast, molasses, toffee, light raisin, and earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Very nice balance and complexity of roasted flavors with some light fruitiness; with good robustness, and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, chalky, and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good dry stout style. Good balance and complexity of nicely robust flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering; but I probably got an old bottle judging by the fruitiness and molasses notes.","superspak","Mar 03, 2013"

The beer pours a dark black with a substantial frothy brown head and is aromatic of burnt coffee. A somewhat strong carbonation hits the mouth making it drinkable but slightly harsh. For a dry irish stout, this old 38 is has no surprises. Well balanced, mild but not watery, bitter and flavorful enough to keep you interested until the glass is empty. This isn't a beer I would get excited about but definitely a go-to beer at a pub, and I would easily recommend it to a friend. If this is North Coasts attempt at making an entry level affordable beer to a wider audience, I think it hit the mark and I wholeheartedly approve.","BenHesk12","Sep 25, 2012"

The taste is very roasted, a tinge of sourness that ends bitter. It was a bit of a shock to the palette when I took the first few drinks, but I'm warming up to it now. I would maybe have more of these again, it's got a lot of flavor and body without the standard high abv that goes along with that sort of beer usually.

The most glaring problem is that he mouthfeel is off - I can accept thin bodied in an Irish dry Stout, but that needs to be compensated by exceptional creaminess, which was absent in this beer. Also, the taste profile is backwards - Malt and hop flavors need to be dialed up, and the plum notes dialed down. A decent, ""good enough"" stout that I would drink again, but wouldn't necessarily seek out.","Bockrules","Nov 18, 2011"

Smell is of dark roasted malt, coffee beans, and some slight cocoa aromas. Taste is of dark roasted malt, coffee, cocoa powder, and some vanilla flavors. A mild roasty aftertaste sticks around after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. A bit on the thin side though.

I could not even taste the beer very well until the beer settled down a bit. The finish was delicious-- roasted malt, coffee and chocolate were nicely and subtly put together.

3.43,-10.4,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"O- I thought it was more of a low-hopped American Stout than an Irish Dry Stout. That being said, it's a decent beer no matter how you cut it. Nothing too memorable or that seperates it from some of the other stouts (type of stout ignored), but it's a step up from Guinness and other entry stouts.

Smell is boozy and slightly sweet. The alcohol smell is slightly off putting. The taste is good on the otherhand. Lacing left on the glass as I drink. The stout has hints of chocolate but lots of caramel malts. Has a thick mouthfeel that is rich and creamy. This beer is pretty good. If it were more popular in my area I might purchase it more often. Is not nearly the best stout I've ever had though.","eggodoom","Aug 16, 2011"

Too light of a n aroma, as roasted malts and chocolate notes seem to be horribly off balance. Hints of coffee maybe? But it all seemed to be a bit of a mess for me to be honest. Smooth, even carbonation on a somewhat mellow profile, needed a bit more of a punch to really be anything worthwhile to me. Roasted chocolate, hints of tobacco, a light sweetness, but again it really all seemed terribly off balance to me to be honest.","mikesgroove","May 21, 2011"

3.88,1.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"D - A well made stout, its flavor profile isn't particularly dark for the style, but it has enough roasted character to give it a very nice dark chocolate character in the finish.

The nose is almost completely coffee, with some molasses and malty notes. The beer has inital flavors of bitter coffee, with a sweet undertone of malt based tastes. There was a smooth, round, full feel to the beer in mouth, and the flavors blend into a decent, light crisp finish. It's more dry than a cream or milk stout, but not as dry as an oatmeal of most dry stouts. The aftertaste is all coffee, but actually without the bitter. The easy aftertaste makes this beer easy to drink all night long.","GarthDanielson","Jan 10, 2011"
3.03,-20.9,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Poured dark brown with a medium almond head that disappeared quickly. Smell is dominated by molasses. Tastewise, there are some citrus notes, some coffee and sweet molasses.

Very enjoyable stout.","kwjd","Dec 29, 2010"
4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"A fair amount of chocolate mouthfeel to this one. Sturdy, chewy, not overly alcoholic as if it made you think in the nose. Does have a hop and slight bitter presence.

3.96,3.4,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"No controversy surrounding the number here, Jack! It pours into a Guinness-esque cascade, which settles out into a sleek black-brown topped by a finger-and-a-half of light tan foam. Quite lovely, I should say. The nose is somewhat weak, comprising light roasted malts, very light cocoa, and a hint of maple syrup. The taste does not deviate too far from this, holding notes of mild roasted malts, dark chocolate, a touch of espresso, and a vague feeling of gingerbread at the finish. The nitro allows everything to coalesce and slide about in an unassuming manner. The body is a sleek medium, with a light and comforting nitrogenation and a consequently ridiculously smooth feel. Overall, a nice little Irish stout. Were this always on nitro, I'd have a solid go-to when all other taps fail.","TMoney2591","Dec 27, 2010"

The flavor seems to have more of a burnt malt flavor, which came across as roasted in the nose. The astringency of it is nice and seems to help the hop bitterness. After subsequent the chocolate and coffee comes out - both of these seem to make the beer feel a little sweet on the tongue. Hope presence is there and adds a nice finish, which you don't get on most dry stouts. Does have a dry finish in the mouth.

Awesome floral and herbal aromas that compliment the chocolate and roasted malt. The hops come into play in the flavor as well. The beginning is hop flavors followed by the customary roasted malt that gives some chocolate and coffee notes. Not being on nitro or casked, it cannot compete in the mouthfeel department.

A sip yields slightly bitter, coffee flavors with a little figs and spiciness to provide a nice refinement. Reminds me of a good, refreshing Baltic Porter.

The smell appears to be great, and strong for the style. I can pick up milk chocolate with some coffee as well. The taste was almost repulsive. Initially there was a strong roasted flavor up front, and before the taste could settle in, the dry bitterness set in. I'm not sure what hops were used, but it left for a bad aftertaste. This one was close to a drain pour. The mouthfeel was decent: good carbonation yet a bit weak on thickness. Due to the bad taste, I cannot rate this beer high on drinkability, even with it's low ABV.

Flavors were roasted malts and dark chocolate with a balanced hop character - the finish seemed to be more bitter chocolate rather than bitter hops, which again was very pleasant.

But anyways I'm looking for something tasty..I see a green covered brown bottle next to a Heineken, it's called Old#38. They say it's a stout. So I was all for it. Little did I know this was a North Coast brew. But I was excited to have a stout on this windy day of golf. It kept me warm. Mouth feel is dry, smooth, tinge of alcohol, and some burnt taste of something. Smell was like coffee and chocolate. Appearance was nice. Foam proceeded to pour over my styrofoam issued course cup after ""they"" poured the brew for me, which was a little dismaying since I obviously wanted to drink what I paid for. So the head was thick and visually the brew looked like a Guinness. It is dry like a guinness with more carbonation and just about the same foam content. I was still able to enjoy the most o' this beer and am looking forward to getting a six pack; or an absurdly priced 4-pack. (I have had the 6 pack, twice now, they did not disappoint).

I pick up sweet malt and a touch of rye within an effervescent but quite drinkable, tastey stout.

Black as coal color, dull orange rust hue at the very outer rims. Carefully toasted nose of dark chocolate, coffee bean, chocolate coated raisins, maple syrup, comes at you slowly with its hands out in friendliness, the hops lack a distinct scent profile but do firm up and sharpen the dominant malts, lasts well but tactfully in keeping with general demeanor. Medium-bodied, probably fuller but it is sufficiently dry that it's hard for the palate to fully register what's soaking in. Again, no lack of black chocolate, coffee, licorice, malted milk ball flavors, slight increase in oatmeal, cereal graininess. Carbonation noticeable when you want to notice it, that is, appropriate level. Drying finish brings out shades of tea leaf, lemon peel and poor brown earth.

It has a roasted aroma that's sweet and a touch tart. There are notes of coffee, licorice and brown sugar. It is medium-full bodied and incredibly smooth. It feels a bit fluffy in the mouth. The finish is dry and dusty. The flavor is very roasted, almost smokey, with notes of coffee, chocolate, and caramel. It's a touch sweet and syrupy, but perfectly balanced. I think this may be the stout on which I originally developed my palate. The malt and hops just work together on a new plane of beer existence. I could drink a bucket of this.

The beer is preeminently creamy and medium bodied with just a bit of carbonation. The taste is roasted malts, a slightly hoppy bite in the finish to let you know there are hops present, and plenty of chocolately notes throughout.

Flavor hits with a quick punch of sweetness and then the alcohol takes over. In my opinion it stays way too long as it leaves a aftertaste on the mouth. Just seems a bit too much, though it doesnt completely overpower. I wonder what age would do to that. Slight cherry tone. Feel is slightly syrupy with minimal carbonation.

The bitterness softens a bit into a more rounded, hop-influenced bitterness, but this beer never stops being bitter and never stops being dry.

Taste has good amount of roasted toasted malts, the dark fruits in there, and its really all good and great, but like the aroma it just falls short, not enough strength to stnad up to the taste. Its not like I want something bang! pow! super tons of malts and hops or whatever, but just enough so it doesn't seem watered down.

One of the best things about this beer is its cocoa-like aroma, almost more reminiscent of baking chocolate. This isn't a very full-boded stout, which is probably one of the characteristics that puts into the dry category.

The taste is the same as the aroma; roated malt with chocolate tones. In general the taste is mellow. Not mellow in that it is lacking or faint, because it is flavoful, Instead, I mean mellow in that it is simple and relaxing. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with perhaps a bit too much carbonation.

Taste was not as good as the nose. It was mostly roasted with a light hop bitter, but a lingering hop that stuck around just a bit too long for my taste. I would have liked to see a touch of the chocolatey sweetness in there as well. The feel was light moderate with an active carbonation. Overall, a solid beer.

It is sweet, with a little chocolate flavor. Very roasted though, that is the strongest flavor I detect. This beer is thick and smooth. It is full bodied, leaving a coffeelike taste on the palate. It is carbonated well. I think that beer might make a good session beer. It is low in alcohol, so that wouldnt be a factor. Also, the flavor, while slightly aggressive, is smooth enough to enjoy.

Somehing came up and tickled my nose - must have been hops. The mouth was thin, high toned, and short. It was semi-crisp, smooth, with a slight hop underlying and mingling with the malt.

Taking a whiff, I smell the aromas of robust brown malts giving a slight chocolate or almond aroma. I also smell the hint of some earthy hops there. Not overly complex, but decent. Taking a sip, i first taste some fruitiness up front (sweetness) followed by some chocolate and nut flavors. Maybe even hints of caramel accompany the chocolate flavor when first sipping. The finish is a little more bitter than the initial sip, due to some hops flavors coming through a little. Very robust beer with a nice feel. The carbonation is not overpowering helping with flavor, alcohol is not there too much either.

Beige head, the apex was almost two fingers worth, collapsed quickly to half that size, the remainder hung around for a while; it does lace very well. Lightly roasty malts emphasize the nose, distant coffee and chocolate hints too. Stout-like and inviting. Tasty palate, dry roasted malts upfront, far from dominating but solid enough. In the middle, charcoal and chocolate notes wafts through, a faint kiss of sweetness. The finish is also dry but heavier on the coffee taste, hops bitterness. This is pretty much all you want in a Dry Stout. Exceptionally drinkable! Simple but well constructed, session brew material. Medium-full body, light carbonation very good mouthfeel. Just think of how many great Dry Stouts are ruined by that nitro-gimmick Im very glad this one is not. Recommended.","bditty187","Oct 28, 2003"

Aroma is dark, sweet chocolate and a nice alcoholic warmth and spice. Also blends in some nice malty roastyness and dried hops with a nice overlaying touch of fresh coffee beans. Taste is quite different then what the smell leads on; mostly a heavy roasted flavor with an older left-in-the-pot coffee sense, a milding roasted sweetness and the chocolate is all but gone from the nose with only hints of cocoa powder and light burnt brownie drying that comes in and through the finish. Feel is medium bodied with a creamy start and middle wrapping up the finish with a favorable little bittering and drying factions with notes of cocoa, coffee, and cinnamon.

A caramel / coffee taste was followed by mild bitterness and hop bite. Great roasted characteristics. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy. Pretty full and heavy, and very appropriate for the style. I really had a hard time finding anything sub-par with this stout. Very solid all around. The Old 38 won't really shock or excite stout drinkers, but it's a great, consistent brew overall.

Looks amazing, but it's nothing compared to the smell of this well done stout, with the dark fragrant roasts and strong coffee esque aroma just wonderful. The taste is also a great part of this beer very refined with hints of espresso and notes of dark chocolate the dark roasted barley fills this beer with slight burnt finish that is pleasant when matched with the other flavors going on.

Light hints of roasted grains and coffee, malt and a pleasant enough nose I guess, malt and lightly sweet at the start, the top disappointing in its feel, a bit light for this stout lover. Finish is moderately carbonated, the hops adequate, the aftertaste dry. Maybe I should classify it as a beginners stout, certainly most stouts have nothing to fear from this rather Wimpy stout, not bad mind you, just a tad to light for me.","Gusler","Jan 27, 2003"

The lace was full and lasting to the bottom of the glass. The aroma was of malt, cocoa, coffee, some sweet overtones as well. The tastes were of bitter chocolate, coffee, malt, kind of watery in the middle of the swallow, some slate near the end as it ended dry. As this beer warmed, it seemed to become more bitter and the chocolate also seemed to become more pronounced. To be honest while rinking this I had to check back to the bottle and reassure that this was a STOUT. To me it seemed more like a PORTER.
