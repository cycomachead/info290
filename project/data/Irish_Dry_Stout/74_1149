I was a bit disappointed at the beginning for that reason, since I had been expecting a heavier smokier more traditional stout flavor. But it is tasty enough, and gradually becomes more pleasing until it has warmed over sixty degrees, when it becomes somewhat bitter. The very low ABV allows you to drink the whole bomber and still remain fairly clear-headed.","scotorum","Dec 28, 2013"

4.01,4.2,3.75,4,4,4.25,4,"easily the best beer on at grittys, hands down. honestly the only one I had that I would care to drink again. it pours a really dark brown, almost black, letting not a smidge of light pass. the head is only small, but its a clue to the delicious creamy texture of this brew. lots of roast in nose and taste, not quite burnt, but still rather bitter, with faint English hops being detectable in the finish. the flavor fits the style guidelines well, but the mouthfeel is what makes this beer a keeper, its subtle and mellow for a beer as flavorful as this. its got a very full body, and feels like it could have come from a nitro tap, even though it didn't. I liked it more and more as it warmed, and while it might not be the best accompaniment to a lobster roll, it felt right as I drank it. really the only decent beer happening from these guys, so get some while you can.","StonedTrippin","Aug 19, 2013"

3.96,2.9,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, the beer is jet black, with a brown highlight around the edges. There is a thin film of milk-chocolate colored head that coats the top of the brew. Aromas are of deep coffee, campfire smoke and char, very bitter and dark chocolate, and some sharp spicing throughout (maybe some cinnamon and pepper). Flavors are light and very dry, with a dark roasted coffee ground flavor front and center, followed by campfire smoke and a meaty highlight. The body is light, smooth, and extremely dry, which is a perfect representation of the style. The aftertaste is mostly smoke, with a rich and semisweet highlight. The finish is dry, and extremely clean. Chocolatey notes finish off as the flavors clear. Very tasty beer...great for a campfire!","GarthDanielson","Oct 07, 2011"

3.9,1.3,4,4,4,3,4,"The darker flavors are the first on the tongue, and dominate most of the mouthful, bringing notes of burnt grains and chocolate malts, tobacco, dark toffees, black coffee, caramelized brown sugar, and dark fruit esters. The tobacco and burnt-black grains came on stronger near the end of the mouthful for me, and stuck around on my soft palate for quite awhile after I'd swallowed. Hops add a nice background bitter fuzz, but manage to avoid the grapefruity, floral notes that can come along with that--notes which would be unwelcome in a beer such as this. I was surprised, however, that the brew lacked the viscosity that I'd expected, given the massive number of ingredients, and the mouthfeel came across as even thinner than a soda. This was slightly unsatisfying, but the fullness of the flavors went a long way towards making up for it.","jondeelee","Aug 13, 2011"

From a nitro-tap this brew was an opaque black color with a one finger head of mocha-like foam. The retention of the tight cap was good and the lacing off it in thick sheets was outstanding. The aroma was soft but appropriate, roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate with a general dryness. The flavors were similar, with an added elements of caramel sweetness and a bitter, coffee finish. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body slightly watery and the carbonation a little too soft.

Smelled a lot like coffee rinds. Taste was somewhat on the bitter side, as it really had a roasted barley flavor to it. Not much sweetness to act as a counterbalance at all. Reminded me a lot of a Guinness Extra Stout. For the style, it was dead on: drinkable, but with enough dryness to not be a session beer.

It finishes so dry and clean with no aftertaste. It's not a lack of flavors upfront because it's a tasty medium bodied beer, but it's just a surprizingly clean fishish. Overall a very good brew.

An oily slick mouthful with a dark burnt roastedness fills the mouth gently warming and yielding to a slighty smokey and dark roasted coffee flavor. There is a very nice bold and charred bitterness and woodiness to this beer. The dried cherries, dark roasted coffee and burnt roasted malts all blend together almost seamlessly producing a light bodied dark roasted flavor. There is definitely a nice dried fruitiness from the cherries emerging in the middle of the palate before finishing with a nice charred and smoky lacing on the tongue.

It explodes over the tongue, almost like a soda, surprisingly refreshing for a stout. It finally quiets into a pleasant reminder of the same flavors anticipated in the aroma. I was surprised by the soda-like quality and at first disappointed in comparison to my first taste on draught at the Portland pub.

Aromas were mostly malty, plenty of character from roasted barley. Nuts, roast, and chocolate were all present. Mild bitterness, balanced towards sweetness. A little dry. Caramel, a bit of roast towards the end. The initial CO2 release left the body feeling a little flat. Otherwise it had a nice texture. Not bad, but I may have had an overcarbonated bottle.

I don't drink much stout, so take my review with a grain of malt. Aroma is fairly malty and leaves some of the head on my nose. Nice earthy flavour with some coffee aftertaste.

Smells mostly hoppy with some roast. Bitter anyways. Hops dominate the flavor, while roast or burnt malt play a big role too. Flavor is not overwealmingly strong. Not watery per se, but not as robust as some porters and stouts. A little more hop bitterness than I generally like in a stout. Fairly heavy-bodied. It's an okay beer overall though, worthwhile to try and have once in a while from a very worthwhile brewery. To be fair, the bottle might be a little old, though not expired.","MrHurmateeowish","Oct 20, 2006"

However, this is worthy of giving a go. As subsequent samplings (perhaps unintentional aging is a factor here). It pours a nice dark color with a monster sized head. The smell is malty.

This reminds me of McNeill's brews -- probably because I just had one before this -- but it has that same slightly sour taste off the bat that is intense when cold, slightly annoying bu more subdued when warm. This also has a huge dark ash flavor, like licking a campfire. Rather thin on the mouthfeel, and not particularly exciting enough to invite another pint.

The abundance of carbonation may have really thrown things off, but his is still a tasty dry stout. Certainly more complex than the most common Irish versions of the sample I've tried.

Medium-bodied (for a stout) with a nice creamy mouthfeel. Roasted malt is the main component of the palate, balanced by a nice but subdued hop profile, accented by espresso, dark fruit, and a touch of something akin to Horlick's malt.

It also smelled kind of like chalk dust to me... Mouthfeel is nice and goes down smoothly with a good fizzz. Leaves an irish cream taste in your mouth with highlights of chocolate, caramel, and roated malts. Very drinkable stout--Could have a few of these in a sitting.

Roasted malts are in there and sweet coffee makes an appearance as well. But where are the hops hidin', you may ask? I dunno. The taste is a bit better than the aromas, as some fersh hops are found in the back of this brew. The malt backbone is solidly great and the coffee and chocolate flavors work well with this here yeast and these diacetyl flavors. Mouthfeel is a bit light, but smooth. Drinkability is very good.

Pours a ridiculous nine (maybe ten) finger dead-brown head over a pitch black liquid. Smells of almost nothing. Water? WTF, this isn't shaping up very good. Very gentle roast and a vegetable that is likely the hops. Immediate taste is lightly sugary with light roast coming in shortly thereafter. As the swallow starts, I get some chocolate with a hint of molasses. Hops rise in the aftertaste with an oily aromatic Fuggles quality. Medium bodied and a bit more carbonated than I would like (which is surprising, as I would have expect all the carbonation to have blown out with the head I got). A light cherry sour sits on my tongue afterward in an interesting twist. Too bad the bottle was way overcarbonated. I only got a half a beer out of it and can't review any more. After a bad start, it the mix of flavors was getting interesting.

Aroma consisted of roasted and dark chocolate notes (trying to decide if it's 60 or 70% cocoa solids, ha!). Mouthfeel is smooth and thin.

Sparse lace present during the drinking experience. Essences of coffee and burnt grain make their aromas known delicately, no overpowering smells here. Taste continues along the same lines, with bitterness entering the flavor equation late, and then closes out with a heightening of the initial flavors.

3.48,-9.6,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"This one pours a dark blood black,like the blood seen through a black fly's belly. It's topped with a brown,rocky foam,nice and thick. It has a sweet coffee aroma with lots and lots of roast on the nose.It is a lighter,drinkable stout with a little dark fruit and malt sweet flavor and a roasty,dry finish.An enjoyable offering sent out by Bierman9.","jeffboo","Apr 13, 2003"

3.98,3.4,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall Black Fly Stout is a very drinkable stout that is good year round. I believe that it is smoother on tap and more drinkable than in the bottle.","purplehops","Jan 06, 2003"
4.05,5.2,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Black in color with limited ruby highlights at the base but some wider glints of dark mahogany at the rim. The full, dark tan head drops shortly but keeps a thin surface coating and leaves some spotty lace. The aroma offers rich dark chocolate and espresso. The body is light with a very fine, median carbonation that leaves it gently zesty in the mouth. The flavor starts dry with a distinct burnt currant fruitiness that mellows into more caramel, chocolate, and left-on-the-burner-too-long coffee notes before finishing with a splash of leafy hop flavor and a long lasting burnt malt character (similar to black malt - although probably from very dark British chocolate and roasted barley). Throughout the glass the combination of the lightly tart fruitiness followed by the acrid roastiness and long dull finish becomes quite endearing. Very unique. Probably a bit too much flavor to make it a good session brew, but definitely interesting and rich enough to make a pint last for alot longer than usual. I'd love to taste this cask-conditioned on handpump.","NeroFiddled","Nov 10, 2002"

4.7,22.1,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"A great stout and considering my location I really need to remember to pick this fine beer up more often. If you can ever get it on a nitro tap it is head and shoulders above Guinness.","MaineBeerMan","Oct 07, 2002"
4.48,16.4,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"A beauty in the glass. Deep dark midnight black. Great big fissy beige head. Fades fast but circles the glass nicely. Smells are balanced and not overwheming combinations of coffee, chocolate, and just enough bitter roasted finish. Taste is even and smooth, subltle coffess undertones, slighltly chocolate. Perfect crisp dry hop finish. No chalk like, slimy aftertaste. Very balanced and flavorful. One of my new all-time favorites. I carried a couple home from my summer trip, would love to try it on tap.","StevieW","Oct 07, 2002"
4.28,11.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours black as night with a good brown head that subsides to a nice film with a great lace.  The brew has strong coffee aromas with solid roasted malt/chocolate characteristics.  Great bittersweet chocolate characteristics mix well with the coffe and roasted flavors in this brew and make it very smooth and enjoyable.  The bitterness of the coffee flavors and the roasted/burnt malt leaves a nice lingering finish behind.  Definitely a very drinkable brew.  I don't think they know hot to make bad beer in Maine.  Thanks to the Bierman for this sample.","Murph","Jul 11, 2002"
3.53,-8.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I enjoyed this stout. Pours with little head, but as with all stouts, looks great in the glass. I liked the malt to hop balance in this one. The hops were there, but were not overpowering. A little lighter than Bell's K'zoo Stout, but a nice offering overall.","proc","Jun 20, 2002"
4.45,15.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This is a great dry stout.  Black with tan head.  Chocolate/coffee aromas.  Nice burnt malt flavors nicely balanced with a dose of hop bitterness. Finishes dry and light bodied, perfect for enticing you into another.  Nice lacing down the glass.  I wish I grabbed more than two.","pbrian","May 12, 2002"
4.5,16.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Notes: One of the top stouts brewed in the US, very well balanced and is even more heavenly on nitro-tap. Certainly a stout lovers stout.","Jason","Mar 21, 2002"
