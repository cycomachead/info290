"o: my first Moylan's beer, wasn't sure what to expect. for the style, this is good. easy to drink and has real nice roasted qualities. worth trying, just don't pay too much for it"
""
""
""
"Mmmm."
""
""

"Overall: quite a decent dry stout, plenty of roast coffee and chocolate.. At around AU$12 a bottle (an equivalent case of 24 x 330mL being around $130) this is cheaper than other top-end brews from Moylan's, Heretic etc, but it is also not the best top-end beer I have ever had."

"Overall - A decent dry stout; I wouldn't seek this one out again; average at best."

"A bit too one-dimensional, and not really all that Irish Dry Stout seeming - the variable milkiness, again, is ill-applied. That aside, this is drinkable, as an after dinner dessert accompaniment, or the like."

"Appearance is pitch black with creamy nitro head. Nose is mild and dry with heavy roast. Taste is smooth and creamy with chocolate, roasted barley and a dry finish. Not a whole lot of flavor, but still nice and drinkable. Mouthfeel is velvety and smooth. Overall, a nice smooth drinkable dry stout."

"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall: With a bit thicker and creamier mouthfeel, this would be slightly above average; as it is, however, it is not worth a second look"

"Black color with a one and a half finger foamy tan head that is stable for a few minutes, with medium amounts of lacing. Smells and tastes of lightly roasted malt, a bit of dark coffee and chocolate, all the usual suspects, but doesn't really promote any of them as aggressively as it could to make it more memorable amongst other Irish Dry Stouts. Although the body is light, crisp and clean in execution, it also seems at time to be as thin as the flavor within. I'd call it a good beginner's introduction to their first Dry Stouts, it's just not quite as complex as others, but that makes it accessible."
"Pours a black body with thick tan head. Smell is pronounced roasted malt with a touch of something sugary. There is definitely something sweet and fruity in there but I can't put my finger on it. Otherwise, it's very dry indeed. Kind of thin despite the creamy head. I guess that's how the style goes. I liked it, but probably wouldn't reach for it again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Not bad flavor but too thin for a stout. If this was a little thicker and creamier this would be great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'd get it again."
""
""
""
"A little roast barley with a dishwater aftertaste. No detectable smell. Some black malt but mostly a lager sort of flavor. Maybe it's tired from the St. Patrick's weekend. Could only be better in the bottle."
""
""
""
""
"B-"
"O - An ok example of the style with some excellent aromas. Unfortunately the main body of the drink was a little too thin which let it down."
""
""
""
"O - Overall this isn't a bad tasting stout, it just isn't a special one. I would prefer it to be more robust, full-bodied, and complex. Just average."
""
""
""
"I have to remind myself after so much brewed in American fashion (which is a good thing) that while this is a stout, it's not a mind-blowingly massive RIS. It's got a fullish body but teeters on the edge of it and is smooth but not especially robust without lacking richness. The feel is dry, stopping just short of chalky. It's on par for an Irish dry, not sn American or bigger."
""
"Poured an excellent black with some very nice head and good lacing throughout. Deep and dark malty scent, with good roasted grain aromas, quite a bit of coffee (maybe too much), and a nice earthy grounding. Good flavors, as well, with a huge coffee flavor, nice roastiness, and a nice earthy-neutral hop finish. Goes down extremely well, very dry and slightly bitter, nice and creamy. A very excellent dry Irish stout with perhaps just a bit too much coffee."
""
""
""
"O- Ok for the style. Not my cup-o-beer though."
"The beer pours fairly handsome. A very dark color with a hefty cap of creamy tan foam above it. The aroma is light chocolate. The beer slinks across the palate with a creamy texture. The flavor is mainly a sprinkling of cocoa powder. The creamy texture along with the cocoa conjures of thoughts of milk chocolaty drinks. The palate is left a bit dry, as it should be. Not a bad beer."

"Overall: Well done Irish dry. This is a style that often falls off into boring and one-note brews, but a well made one is a thing of beauty. Rich and full, but still true to style. My only gripe is that this is only sold in bombers. Sixers of this would make this a regular purchase."
"Overall: I'm let-down by this ale. Not dark roast malted enough for my taste. More like a porter. I've had more flavorful dry stouts."
"O – An easy drinking crisp stout, the bomber was an easy finish for me solo. I won’t be buying this again: thin structure and just nothing really drawing me in here. 3.5"
"22 ounce bottle, no bottle date. Pours pitch black color with a small 1 finger fairly dense tan head with nice retention that reduces to a lacing cap. A small bit of lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of big milk chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, toffee, vanilla, and some coffee. Some damn nice aromas here with good strength and balance. Taste of big roasted malt, milk chocolate, and caramel; with light coffee and vanilla. Some noticeable bitterness on the finish, with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, and vanilla on the finish for a short period of time. Still quite dry as would be expected. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice smooth mouthfeel with tons of creaminess. No alcohol noticed at all in the taste or finish as expected. Overall, this is the best dry stout I have ever had. For 5%, this has tons of flavor with a great mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: I really enjoyed this one, yet for the style it falls as just about a solid B. I like the tobacco taste and it looks divine, yet taste wise I have other favorites in the style. That said, I would have no problem downing a couple of these."
"Overall a one-dimensional irish dry stout that delivers pretty well on the premise. No surprises with this one. Decent go-to beer for the style, but don't go into this expecting something amazing."
"22 oz bomber into a giant snifter...pours a rich deep black with a decent head. Good retention too. Smell is malty and dry...pretty good there too. Taste is appropriate for the style, but not a standout. It is malty, dry, crisp, not too bitter. Mouthfeel is decent but should be more dry. Overall, nothing to rave home about, but a drinkable and sessionable stout."
"Poured into an imperial nonic a deep roasted chesnut brown with a 1/2 finger beige colored head atop.Dry and earthy aromas with a bit of char,dark roast coffee and a a hint of caramel sweentess in there as well.Seemed to be a bit thin and sharp in the mouth,not liking the sharpness to much in a dry stout.Flavors are roasted and earthy with coffee playing a large role in the profile,mild caramel sweetness in the finish.I have alot better dry stouts but this isnt horrible,just average."
"Poured a 2"" mocha colored head which eventually totally dissipated. Color is clear dark burnt umber brown. Smell is coffee and dark roasted malts. Taste is more of the same and also has a slight hint of cocoa. If I were using Guinness as a benchmark for stouts and compared the two I'd say Guinness has the better body and mouthfeel BUT Moylan's has more flavor. So all in all a quality stout which holds its own."
"Overall. Good stout. Not as dry as I was expecting, but tasted good."
"O: Overall I would rank this beer above average. It fits the style well. It is a little more bitter than I would like, and I wish it was less carbonated. The drinkability suffers a little because of this, after all thats what a dry stout is for."
"The pour was nice enough, very dark brown, basically black with no light shining through on this one at all. Rich looking head of tan on the top hung around for most of the session. The aroma was a bit light. Lots of roasted malts, with just a hint of cocoa underneath it. Really dry taste, but a little bland for me. Light cocoa and roasted malts, but it lacked alot of depth to put it over the top into another cateogory. Still though it was a decent little stout with a nice feel, and a 3.5 percent very drinkable. Not sure I would go here again though."
"I actually had it with a baked potato, which brought out the bacon flavor from the bits that I topped the spud with. quality beer for an inexpensive bottle."
"D: One of the most drinkable examples of the style."
"O not bad i would try again. there are better stouts out there tho"
"Large three plus finger head of loose, larger foam, heavily whipped, dark tan to outright brown in color, the lacing is haphazard but sticks fully where it lands. Just about pure black liquid, no color to be hither or yon, appears trim and clean. Taut and wiry nose, hits you with it, but it is indeed a punch, cocoa to malted milk balls, lighter caramel, orange peels, the hops have a subtle aggressiveness and pine and grass appear in uncommon percentage, plum, black grape, cherry fruit scents thick enough to anchor things, doe snot appear fashioned to gently soak in, no love handles. Full-bodied with a muscular enough structure to keep things limber and nimble with the added weight. Cocoa, dark chocolate nibs, coffee, hard toffee, the orange citrus a very dry zest, leads swiftly into pine sap and tea leaf accents. The carbonation has a finely granular character while still bringing a fair degree of fluff. Smokiness builds sip after sip, with it a semi-bitter nuttiness. Lots of elements, not so much harmony. As a result, does not deliver high scores on general drinkability."
"From the aroma, I thought this would be a winner, but with the watery taste, it is only average."
"D - great, beer doesn't any better"
"I love stouts and I've had some good stuff from Moylan's but this one was disappointing."
"Dark brown/black color with a very thick creamy head. Pretty thick lacing on the glass, looks like a stout and looks good. Smell is somewhat subtle but has a very malty sweet character. Vanilla and chocolate are pretty obvious but I can't pick out the rest. Taste is kind of subdued. Very creamy and definitely vanilla is the main taste. Not much bitter flavor or hops though. Pretty low for a stout. It was somewhat medium to light bodied and not very carbonated. It's alright but there are much better stouts out there."
"I'm disappointingly underwhelmed by this beer, given that Moylans is one of my favourite breweries and Irish dry stout is one of my favourite beer styles. Needs a little work, this one, Brendan."
"The beer is medium-bodied with an overall dry mouthfeel. Drinkability is great."
"Low ABV, great tasting, very aromatic...drinkability doesnt get any better. If only Hopsickle were this good..."
"Pours a dark black brew with a foamy, lingering beige head that stays around. Roasted goodness in the aroma with a big chocolate/cocoa presence in the background. The taste is roasty with some smoke in the mix. A little hoppy on the swallow with minimal carbonation. Some coffee characteristics linger in the aftertase and leaves the mouth salivating. At only 5% this was a nice sipping beer to fully enjoy the bomber. An excellent take on the Irish Dry Stout and the label states it was brewed in the Irish tradition. I feel the Irish would be proud."
"Despite the carbonation, its very drinkable. A great beer, and a pretty darn good representation of the style."
"I wondered how this usually hop-heavy brewery was going to handle a beer like this, and it is certainly less ""west coast"" than all the other beers I've had by them. It's not my favorite style, and not my favorite Moylan's beer, but I'm glad for the experience all the same."
"Overall, an enjoyable beer but lacked originality. Probably wouldn't be my first choice of Irish Dry Stouts."
"A simple roasted character is dominate. Which is very enjoyable. Not overly astringent or oxidized like I have found with many Moylan's Stouts. Just enjoyable. Something I would recommend."
"D - Very drinkable. This is a stout I could drink regularly and not tire of because of its balanced flavor. Its one drawback is its faint smell. I want a little more on the nose."
"Pours a pitch black colour with thin head and minimal lacing. Smells of coffee, mild chocolate, with some mild fruit and roasted malt. I notice some hop bitterness in the flavour with the sweet malt. A bit thin in the body, but nice carbonation. I enjoyed this stout."
"Drinks easy, a serviceable enough dry stout, nothing to get too excited about"
"M: thinner than expected"
"D-Very drinkable Irish Dry Stout, which for the record is not my favorite style by any means."
"Drinkability is quite nice as well. Flavorful without ever wearing on the palate, had this one been packed into a beer with a slightly lower abv (say, 4%) it would have been a perfect 5. Very nice beer from Moylan's, very impressive."
"This is a promising interpretation of by far, one of my favorite styles. A: Deep ebony with hues consistent with creme brulee in the head and lacing. S: Just as it should be: Cocoa, carob, a hint of licorice, earthy blackened maltiness. T: Strong character of smoky peat and slightly acrid grains and a medicinal composition up front with an incredibly dry, clean disappearing finish. MF: Excellent, coats the palate without being overpowering, allows for lingering transition between the assertive first punch and the phantom finish. D: Very high for a dry stout. More complexity that many dry Irish stouts without affecting the drinkability. Each sip begs to be followed by another as the evaporative character leaves the drinker wanting yet another imbibition. Very good stuff, I would love to sample this on draft or dare I say it, on cask. Not nearly as sessionable as a Guinness, Murphy's or Beamish, nor should it be. Solid as the military unit whose name it bears."
"D: Comparing beers is a necessary evil when reviewing, so I have to contrast the sharpness of Dragoons with the rich creaminess of Murphy's. Though the former is certainly drinkable, I'd rather session with the latter. And while we're on the topic of comparing beers, one sniff of a UK-born and bred Dry Irish Stout transports me right to London; Dragoons gets me on the plane, serves me a beer from the beverage cart, and then drops me off back in my living room."
"Poured black with a tan head, poor retention and spotty lacing. Smelled of coffee, toffee, and caramel. Same in the taste; nicely blended with a semi-sweet finish. On the thin side, with little carbonation. A little too sweet of a finish for an 'Irish Stout' for me, but still a drinkable beer."
"This beer isn't overly flavorful, but it's got enough to keep one's attention. It succeeds, in terms of mouthfeel and drinkability, due to the ABV and low viscosity. Nice beer to try, and again, a great stout for this time of year."
"D - The general mildness but rich flavor make this quite drinkable."
"Moylan's Dragoons Dry Irish Stout--2010 22 oz. Bottle. 5.00% ABV. 28 IBU's. (4.0 / 5.0) Thin tan thin lace head. No sediment. Clear dark ruby black pour turns opaque dark black. Rich roasted burnt mild floral hop front. Dry sweet cloying crusty burnt mild coffee cocoa earthy Stout body. Refreshing tangy mild hop bitter black malt citrus hint end. Sampled 5/30/2010. 2 @ $3.99 Each."
"On cask at Lagunitas beer circus. Beige head atop an opaque body. Nice chocolaty coffee like aroma. Taste is a touch bitter, roasted malts come thru nicely and the feel is very smooth and easy to drink. Nice to enjoy a great beer surrounded by a bunch of lunatics at this Lagunitas event. :-) Tasty, nice cask."
"Very drinkable, would drink this as a session beer if it were available in sixers."
"Bomber poured into a pint glass. Brownish black with a creamy tan head. Solid roasty aroma with some vanilla bean influence, maybe a little peat and caramel. Flavor is nice and roasty with light caramel sweetness and some dark chocolate as it warms. Minor acidity and a dry finish make this nicely drinkable. Another rock solid example of a classic style from the Moylans/Marin braintrust."
"Overall impression- While definitely a step up from the ubiquitous nitro Irish stouts, this could use a little cleaning up. Quite enjoyable as is, though."
"Overall: Not as big, subtle, smooth or rich as Guinness Extra Stout, which not even being brewed in Ireland anymore isn't a good indication of this beer's quality. Not a bad beer in any way, but not nearly close enough to the leaders of this style to be worth spending much time or money on."
"A pretty underwhelming beer."
"Wow! Taste is nearly a milk stout and less a Irish-style stout. Pretty sweet and malty all the way through. Lots of dark malty flavours with a touch of chocolate deep down and indeed, a bit of milkiness like Mackeson's. Not as assertive in the sugar department as Mackeson, but it *does* taste similar. Mouthfeel has a great weight to it to only be 5,0%. I was unsure what to expect with this one, but it certainly did not fail to please. Even though this did not drink like the style in which it is supposed to be (Irish Dry), it's still a very well crafted stout. Good job, Moylan's."
"While this isn't terribly complex, it is tasty and very drinkable. If it didn't flatten out so much as it warmed it would rate a lot higher."
"D: A nice pint on St. Patrick's Day. One of the best Irish Dry Stouts out there, and it's made in CA."
"Mouthfeel has a slick creamy texture. Guinness is the standard for a Dry Irish Stout. This version has more body and flavor than Guinness. Solid stout and enjoyable."
"I was very excited to try this beer, and I was pretty disappointed. This bottle could be old, or the flavors could be ""off"" from the room temp storage."
"22oz. bomber served in a shaker pint. Poured a deep brown/black with a finger of white head. Chocolate malt in the aroma. Light to medium bodied. More toward the chocolate malt than roasted barley in the flavor. The roasty flavor came out more as it warmed. Not a lot of hop bitterness, just some to round out the malt. Dry malty finish. Pretty sessionable. Decent Dry Stout."
"Recommended"
"Pours a nearly opaque black-brown, with a nice finger of khaki head that unfortunately dies away fairly quickly and leaves little lacing behind. The smell is primarily coffee, with a dash of cream and some plums and figs squatting in there as well. The taste generally follows, with those coffee nots dominating and the dark fruits pushed all the way back to the finish (and there joined by some red berries as well). The heavily medium body leaves a baseline chalkiness behind, and the carbonation feels overly up-ratcheted, forcing down the drinkability from what would/could have been decently tall heights."
"D-very easy drinking and a nice taste. The huge butterscotch nose actually threw me off at first. The roasted and coffee malts really came through in the taste though with a nice balancing of big roasted malts and a little hop backbone."
"Poured a thickish black with minor tan head that died quickly. A great smell that covers a lot of sweetness such as vanilla, caramel, molasses, syrup, dark chocolate, hints of coffee and roasted malts. Medium-bodied and smooth, this is a simple beer with chocolate sweetness, even stickiness mixing with some roasted malt for a sweet beer (more than chocolate, to note) that finishes a tad dry. What it lacks in complexity it makes up for with enjoyability - open a bottle and just down this b/c it is REAL goo."
"Aroma is smoky with a firm overtone of unsweetened chocolate and a roast coffee undertone. It pours a deep, opaque sable that is just a shade above black and has a thick, fine-bubbled, fairly persistent buff head. Flavor is smoky and fairly chocolaty, not sweet and just a teeny bit yeasty. Texture is fairly smooth, a bit chalky and fairly fizzy, a bit thinner than I expected but not disappointing."
"M/D: Lighter body, but high carbonation. Easy to down, and can I have another, please?"
"Lightly carbonated and drinkable enough. Not my favorite style in the world but this is a worthy version."
"D: Overall, this didn't seem like a balanced beer. One flavor dominated: burnt."
"On cask at Cole's cask fest. Black with Caesar, with a white bubby head. Stout aroma, but above average mouthfeel. A bit sourness in it. Drinkable but still not that great a stout.What can I do, I'm not a great fan of the style, and I do not get it on tap."
"D- I think that I can count the number of dry stouts I've had on 1 hand. This one is top notch and very easy to drink. I would definetly recommend this."
"Taste is also great, plenty of charred grain flavors, dark unsweetened chocolate and more malted milk balls with a very mild black licorice molasses flavor in the background. This is not overwhelming though, no nagging off flavors, no over abundance of charred burnt flavors. This is spot on for the style. I guess its because I've had so many terrible dry stouts in the past, I have been turned off to the style as a whole. But now the tables have turned. I really enjoyed this beer."
"Overall I can't think of another beer in the style that I've enjoyed more, even though it could be considered an American Stout/Dry Irish Stout hybrid. Well worth a shot and I look forward to having this again."
"Sample at Alan's HSC initation. This brew pours an opaque dark brown/black color with ruby around the edges. Thin beige head that recedes steadily, and stringy lacing. Mellow roasted aroma of malt and coffee. Medium, smooth body with flavors of roasted malt, coffee and chocolate. Mildly hoppy at times too. The finish is sweet and roasty with a mocha aftertaste. Good session Stout all around."
"had one of these on cask at the ginger man, it arrived in time for the last few bites of of my exotic hot dog - thick and black with a minimal head - aroma of roasted malts and coffee - taste followed the nose with a crisp and clean finish - nice clean mouthfeel that asked for another sip - i could have gone for a few more."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle poured into my shaker glass. Dragoons appears a translucent dark brown color with two fingers of pillowy tan foam. Nose and flavors consist of milk chocolate, mocha coffee notes, mildly roasted grain, sweet malt, very light bitter char. A notch better than medium bodied and amply carbonated. Finish is smooth and a tad bitter."
"A rather smooth and enjoyable Irish dry stout. Not a bad choice after drinking harsh DIPAs or a huge RIS. Recommended."
"D-Solid, easy to drink, flavourful and true to style dry stout. Nothing off the wall, simply a well made, tasty brew."
"D - This is a really good dry stout. Nice roasty flavors."
"I wasn't a big fan of this beer. The strong, oak taste was a little much for me. Looked and smelled great however. Almost black with a milk-chocolate head. This seems to be a slow drinker...might be good with a cigar or cured meats and strong cheese. Also, seems a bit weak on the alcohol side. Unique stout and worth a try."
"All and all a good stout. Not as thick, and thus a bit easier to drink than some others I have tried."
"Along with Mad River's Steelhead Extra Stout, this is one of my very favorite west coast version of dry stout. (Shakespeare from Rogue is not a dry stout in my book)"
"D: no feature knocks it out of the park (except maybe the smell, once warm but not too warm!). Can't dwell on that though. Main takeaway: regardless whether you love it, it's impossible not to at least /like/ this beer. Utterly drinkable, but never boring. I'd have no problem giving some to my Coors-swilling friends looking to branch out into craft brews, yet I'd also recommend it to my alcohol-shy mom. Worth revisiting if the price is right."
"D - Low ABV as expected with these stouts and taste isn't exceedingly overwhelming."
"The beer poured a nice dark and clear liquid into the glass. I chilled the beer a bit more than I would normally as it was a hot day. The only real downside is that the beer is just a bit sweet, something I typically don't care for in a beer. Better than most stouts, except for a few chocolate stouts I've had. This stout had a bit of choc itself."
"Quite a nice dry stout. Fairly roasty and chocolatey with quite a bit of flavor for a 5% stout. Pours very dark brown, near black with a creamy head that fades to a ring. Smells roasty, creamy, and a touch nutty, but all in balance and not too assertively roasted, but enough to create a nice toasty note. Taste is similar- especially creamy and a bit nutty with just enough roastiness to give it some flavor. A bit of light, lingering bitterness as well. Extremely creamy in the mouth, this is a very pleasant session beer, and quite a nice dry stout."
"Drinkability: Paired well with the movie ""The Quiet Man"". Though I'd like to see how this fares under a nitro-tap, it's still enjoyable in bomber bottle form. I'd prefer a hair more body and creaminess, but it's acceptable as is. At least it isn't guilty of what so many self-labeled dry stouts are -- having almost no flavor. A pleasant, flavorful, well-made dry stout."
"super friendly beer. hafta be an idjit to not like this. Poured with a nice tan head that lasts forever with lotsa lace. Aroma is just good fresh balanced stout. easty beer. Good beer. friendly beer. I want more. dark, good body. Alcohol isn't an issue. would be good with --- just about any got damn thang."
"As an aside, I used this as a steak marinade (along with some garlic, onion and spices) and it was fantastic."
"pours almost black, with a decent tan head that dies down but keeps a small presence. smells smokey and burnt (some will say roasted). taste is very much like the nose, roasty and ""stouty", not much else, the usual suspects like dark chocolate and some coffee. a little lacking and a tad thin in the mouthfeel department. easy drinking and pretty damn solid. a nice break from the nitro stouts and super intense imperials."
"Pours deep ruby to almost black with thin, light tan colored head. Nose is somewhat weak with faint coffee grounds in the distance. On the palate it is light bodied, with some dark chocolate and roasty flavors. This is more of an easy drinking Irish stout than an in your face stout, and I like it for that."
"D - Great flavor and low ABV make this one an all night drinker. I enjoy Beamish and the other 'macro' Irish dry stouts, and Moylan's is just more of a good thing. Take everything you know about Guinness and crank it up to 11, and you'll know what this beer is about. Great stuff."
"A very pleasant Irish stout. Flavorful, yet still simple and unpretentious. I came in expecting a decent, flavorful stout and that's exactly what I got. If it's not the most memorable beer in the world, it makes up for it with it's solid construction and tasty profile. I will surely buy this again. Recommended."
"Dark mocha brown, nearly opaque in the glass with two fingers of tan head that descends quickly. Dry and roasty aroma; light fruitiness, cream and toasted grain. Clean. Dark roasted coffee on the palate, subtle blackberry and bittersweet chocolate. Medium-light body, crisp and dry mouthfeel. Firm bitterness in the finish, an even mix of roast and hops. Pretty nice stuff, not spectacular but definitely solid and drinkable. This would be great on cask."
"Dark, Huge head and nice roasty nose. This is a really well made dry stout . Nice smoothness to the taste but still delivers the burnt malty goodness. Not huge but complex enough to enjoy in sips. Much better than Guiness due to the fact the finish stays with you after a few sips"
"Overall, this is a drinkable beer for a stout but there are definite rooms for improvement. For an irish stout, it is good and I would like to enjoy it again in the future. Minimal alcohol and a reasonable combination of the aroma, taste, and mouthfeel make it worthy."
"Wine Specialist/$4.45/22 oz"
"D - Solid Irish stout. It was nice to try something other than a hop bomb from Moylan's, and this particular stout was well done."
"A very nice Irish style stout. Nice to find in an increasingly imperial world."
"A good stout but not at the top of my list"
"The aroma is right for the style with coffee, chocolate, toasted malt, and earth. The appearance is dark brown with a very but head. The flavor is like the aroma with a touch of licorice. The palate is thin. Overall not bad but it is not exactly to my liking."
"Sweet roasted chocolate taste that turns smokey mid way through the mouthflow. Dry slightly hopped finish which is very smooth and easy to drink. Great example of an irish dry stout with enough sweet character to make it more acceptable to others. Well balanced stout!"
"Taste is just a touch more dry that the nose suggested but definitely plenty of sweetness. An almost lactose quality in the sweetness reminds me of a milk stout. The roasted qualities of the malt drys things out from the middle to finish while adding an almost burnt aftertaste. Coffee still persists into the taste. Not too complex, but definitely satisfying. Smooth but not creamy. Decent level of carbonation."
"D: Good, a beer I could drink more of than I would expect for something so dark. A good session stout."
"22 oz. Almost black pour, tanish head. Roasted coffee and malt nose. Roasted/burnt malt, espresso like flavors with a little bitterness. As it warmed just slight hints of cocoa. Rather dry, somewhat chalky finish. A dry stout, I think this is how it's supposed to be. To make it simple, I thought this was an better version of Guiness. Excellent drinking beer."
"Beer poured black with a one finger tan head that did not last long. Nose is malty with hints of mocha. Taste is roasted dark malts with chocolate. Finish is light coffee with a hint of dry hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and is moderately smooth. Drinkability is good. This is not overly complex but because of the average abv and with interesting enough qualities this is a beer that will have one reaching for more. Another nice brew from the folks at Moylan's!"
"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a pint glass, the beer pours a jet black hue with a thick, cream colored head. There is very nice lacing on the side of the glass. The smell is coffee and bittersweet chocolate, with notes of toast. The flavor is more than I expected. Coffee, chocolate, and roasty maltiness dominate. It finishes dry with a nice light hop edge. The beer is very smooth, and it's medium body makes it very easy to drink. Another session stout in my book."
"Pitch black colored beer with a rapidly fading creamy head.Aroma is cocoa and coffee.Taste is irish cream,coffee and chocolate.Exceptionally smooth and very easy to drink.You could put down a dangerous amount of these on a hot day.Overall an excellent stout!!"
"overall, this is definitely a beer worth drinking, but not something i would go back to often."
"Pours with a large foamy dark brown head, well carbonated. Opaque jet black color. Smells like coffee, chocolate, molasses, sweet toasted almonds. Surprisingly light body. Starts roasty and sweet, coffeeish, moving to a sweet burnt smokiness, finishes quite dry, almost burnt. Moderate alcohol."
"Body is a solid medium body with a slender creamyness to it. All the while adding its dryness in all the right places. The balance is remarkable between the two and how the dryness meets its smooth creamyness with a comfort and ease. Making for a wonderfully easy, clean & creamy, dryish drinkin' Irish Stout."
"Taste is also a big different. Moylan's retains that deep roasted bitterness of mild coffee and slightly phenolic spiciness and virtually no hop profile to speak of. The mouthfeel is lacking though, rather watery and feels undercarbonated feel where there should be a thicker, more substantial body. Black Sun has a fuller, more substantial and chewy mouthfeel which places it a step above Moylan's, but the flavor profile is again off from the style. Licorice and a slight chocolatly sweetness mixes with an undercurrent of estery fruitiness. I am going to have to give the edge to Moylan's on this taste test that wasn't even that blind thanks to the huge amount of hops in Black Sun. Moylan's tastes more like an Irish Stout should while the Black Sun tastes a bit too sweet for my tastes."
"Dark brown nearly black pour with a decent sized dark brown head. Has a smoky and peppery coffee aroma and has a dense taste that is mainly coffee but also some pepper and is layered with a very dry finish at the end. A surprsingly smooth and tasty brew that I enjoyed more than I thought I would."
"The drink is on the light side of medium bodied but is somewhat overly carbonated. A distracting wave of stinging bubbles greets the palate at each swig, but the net effect is that the drink is quite refreshing."
"From a 22oz bottle purchased locally. Jet black with a good tan head. Aroma is coffee and dark chocolate with a little fruity fig in there. Flavor is dry, with more chocolate in there. Roast flavor is restrained and bitterness balances. Carbonation is not to high, although it could be less. Smooth, creamy dry and balanced. This is a great example of an Irish Dry Stout made in the US. More micros need to make these."
"Slightly charred, dry finish. Light body is acceptable but seems a little too carbonated and not quite smooth. Maybe it was my frame of mind, but I was not impressed with the Dragoons and I don't think I'll even try the bottle."
"Pours a deep black with ruby accents and a light brown diminishing head. Aroma is lightly sweet with roast, coffee and herbal. Flavor is cocoa, herbal, roasty and nutty. Long fry finish. Smooth texture, medium carbonation. Overall a very nice medium bodied stout."
"This is an amazingly flavorful and drinkable session beer. It hit all the right notes and was true to style. I have trouble really finding points to criticize. Outstanding."
"One of the best Dry Irish Stouts I've ever had. Pours black with a very short tan head. Mild aroma of roasted chocolate malt and cereal. Delicious taste that is balanced well. Coffee, chocolate, cream, smoke, and vanilla are all there and compliment each other without drowning out the flavor. The hops balance the sweetness and give it the dry bite and finish. Excellent."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied. Good steady carbonation, pretty much spot on for the style. I think this makes a great everyday drinking brew with its low abv and nice big dry, roasted flavor. Definitely worth a try!"
"Dragoons Dry Irish Stout is a worthy addition to the Moylan's lineup. The fact that it doesn't score as high as Ryan O'Sullivan's say more about my love for big beer than it does about this beer's worthiness. Slap down your $5.29 and make up your own mind."
"Superior to many iterations of Dry Irish stout I have had, but nothing special."
"Overall its a good stout. Easily drinkable and might be great on nitro."
"Very dark, just short of black, with mahogany edges that showed a bit of a ruby tint. A one finger mocha cap was generated by a very hard pour, a mixture of fine and soapy bubbles that left considerable clumpy lacing stuck to the glass. Good head retention. Very roasty aroma, some coffee and burnt notes, with faint toffee and dry cocoa. Mild bitterness stayed beneath the malt and roast flavours, but remained solid throughout. It started out with sweet malts, some caramel and roast. Light grassy hops appeared mid-sip and grew into a finish that was balanced with lingering roast and toffee with a hint of vanilla and sour cherry thrown in as well. A bit dry with controlled astringency from the dark malts. The body was on the lighter side, firmly entrenched between medium and light. Carbonation was certainly on the low side, but remained lively enough to keep it from feeling dull. Nice texture overall. Quite a good stout, easy drinking with a little added malt and hop complexity plus a little more body than you normally see with the style. Good stuff."
"Over-all a nice stout, hearty and rich with a dark, espresso chocolate character and a few dust bunnies thrown in for good measure. Would drink again but with chocolate dessert."
"D: slightly above average, was dry, well suited per style, but didn't find myself jonesing for the next sip. Moderatly good overall."
"There's a bit of an acrid acidity and quite a bit of carbonation that is slightly abrasive. Overall though - a nice representation of the style, with soft cocoa sweetness and mild coffee with plenty of roast, leading to a dry finish."
"Hyper easy to drink this stuff basically sneaks down your throat when you aren't looking. Nothing bad at all about this beer, one of the bests of the type."
"Medium bodied, medium finish. A nice stout that delivers flavor, but doesn't stick around too long, or make any kind of fuss. Still, keep you reaching for another sip. Then another bottle."
"drinkability: good"
"Deep brown, almost black in color with a huge cascading brown head that leaves some sticking. Fruity, sweet malts and a citrus hop bitterness. Fluffy body, a bit of cherry funk and lemon skin bitterness, roasted caramel malt but there is subtle hints of coffee and chocolate as well. Almost tart cherry, vanilla flavor, a bit thin on the body, no chew. It honestly more sweet than anything, there's no drying alcohol heat or intense tongue numbing bitterness. Its thin, sour and borderline cloying. This is just off."
"This is on drinkable beer. I could, and would love to, drink a bunch of these."
"Brown colored beer. A light hint of espresso, roast and dried dark chocolate are present in the very light nose. Flavor is lacking depth. While it does have some nice elements (like a lingering finish,) it's very timid in the front and mid-palate and lacks richness. Had high hopes for this one, but it failed me."
"D- Tough to say, as we were testing such a fresh keg. But I can gaurantee that I will be back for more!"
"taste is dry, milk and bakers chocolate, some coffee, sour malt, some bitter hops, ends dry and just a little bitter."
"Dry feeling was left on the palate."
"d: A great example of the style. good roasted malt backbone. very sessionable. You'll want to let this one warm a bit to capture its full glory."
"Terrific representation of the style. I could drink these all day."
"Black body. Brown head. Thin lace patterns. Nose is excellent. Roasted coffee bean, baker's chocolate, roasted malts. Great roasted malt aroma. Perfect for the style. Flavorwise, this is about as good as it gets for a Dry Irish Stout. Great roasted malt character. A little smoke. Some powdered cocoa accents nicely. Dry chalky mouthfeel. And coffee grounds come to mind as well. Lingering roasted malt bitterness is enjoyable as well. Been a while since I've had a great Irish style stout. Good to see they're still being made."
"I think this is another one that was served a little colder than it should have been. I really think it would be better, both aroma and taste, at a slightly warmer temperature."
"As an Irish American I have a soft spot in my heart for stouts and other similar beers. One of the reasons I am a craft beer lover today is because of all those pints of Guiness I had to choke down and pretend I liked to keep up apperances. Until one day I actually liked the stuff. The rest is mostly history. First off Moylans is an execellent brewery. They make top notch beer. Usually bottled versons of Irish stouts just dont work very well, but in this case it really dose. Somehow they managed to put a smooth, creamy and dry stout in a bottle without all the high tech gadgetry you may find in other examples. The colour is black. The head is thick and tan. The armoa is rich with coffee and chocolate, but subdued. The flavour is roasty, chocolaty, earthy and smooth. It has a very mild bitterness so there is some sweetness but that just adds a layer of complexity. Not nearly as dry as say Guiness, nor is the body as light. Still I would say it fits nicely into the Irish stout category. I really like this beer and highly recommend it. Oh yeah its only 5% ABV so like other dry stouts it makes an awsome session beer."
"I am a bit surprised to say it, but this is actually probably better on Nitro, or preferably from the hand pump; the reduced carbonation and carbonic acidity would really help to keep this beer more balanced. And the beer does actually smooth out, become more integrated and not as overtly roasted if I vigorously swirl out the carbonation; serving this on the warm side certainly helps too. Not exactly the best beer to be drinking out of the bottle, if you work at it you can turn this into a nicely drinking beer though. I would love to have this served via hand pump from a cask at about 59°F / 15°C."
"Dragoon's is a good beer for sure. Nicely done version of the style that I would not hesitate to drink when in the mood."
"d: a good stout that is sweet and creamy; makes a good nightcap/after dinner desert drink"
"Very easy to drink, a very solid Irish Stout."
"The lightness, dry finish, & low ABV make this sessionable."
"Pours a very dark brown-nearly black with a brown head that quickly disappears. Some burnt malt roast in the aroma. Taste is malt, roasted, and very chocolate? Also a subtle sweetness in the finish-mouthfeel is smooth and lush-drinkability is exceptional. Guinness-c-ya later-give me a few pints of Dragoons. Saddle up boys!"
"Pours a pourous tan head that quickly recedes without any provocation from my lips, nose or tongue, to a medium island of foam in the middle of the beer. A little bit darker than Guinness, with just noticeable dark brown highlights. The aroma is a dru grainhouse roasted malt with notes of very light coffee and watered down chocolate. The taste has a upfront roated malt character with a bone dry hop and dark malt middle. Te finish brings out the light brownie and coffee flavors. All very subtle, but great for a very sessionable dry stout."
"Drinkability- Minus the carbonation, it's pretty well right on style. I would recommend it to fans of this style."
"A pretty tasty, and balanced stout. Flavor is pleasant and unified. A nice easy drinker."
"From a 22 oz bottle this poured into my Duvel glass a very dark brown that looked almost black. Rich nose of roasted chocolate malts and coffee, vanilla, and smoke. Thick creamy mouthfeel. Flavor is rich and the hops and malts are well balanced. Nice dry bitter finish. Most enjoyable. Shows you don't have to have some huge ABV value to make a great beer."
"Drinkability: Occasionally, I get in the mood for Guinness and I'm always disappointed when I drink it. From now on, I will surely drink this instead. By the way, the cheese pairing is delicious."
"Notes: Who needs to go to Ireland for a good dry stout when you can go to Novato for one? Or in my case, the local beer store. I forget how much I like dry stouts, and Moylan's was there to remind me of that. Here's to the skeptics: this beer won Gold at the 2007 GABF."
"Deep brown body with a malted milk tan head. Little or no lacing is left though head lasts. Strong chocolate and coffee aroma. Same on the taste buds, coffee, chocolate with a tinge of hop. A good traditional style stout. Very smooth and drinkable. Moylan's makes solid beer and this one follows in the tradition of good quality."
"Drinkability: I could close my eyes and see myself in an Irish pub, folk music being played and subtle grins on everyone's faces. Easy to drink but begs you to take the time to enjoy it. The alcohol content doesn't come through at all, and I could see this as a meal replacement. An Irish Brewpub like Moylan's can't keep the namesake without a good Irish Dry Stout, and this beer does not dissapoint. Well done."
"A very nice way to celebrate St. Patty's Day. Cheers!"
"Decent, and recommended if you are a fan of the big names in this style arena."
"Tap@Moylans Brewpub. Pretty nice, soft and dry, some licorice, subtle roasted maltyness, nutty, pretty easy going. Good flavour, and decent length, and whats more its not too sweet, nice dry finish, i could have drunk a pint or 2 more of this, but we had to head off."
