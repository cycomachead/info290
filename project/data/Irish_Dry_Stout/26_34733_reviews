"Overall: A nice, lighter bourbon barrel stout. A little hot still, and I'm not sure the body can suppor the barrel aging."

"D - The smell is wonderful, but unfortunately the taste is merely enjoyable. I remember liking this a tad more a few months back when a growler was shared late one night at the Hopleaf. Still, it's another fine barrel-aged offering from 3 Floyds that I'd gladly have again."
"It's a medium bodied dark chocolate brown in color with a creamy one finger head. The nose consists of sweet milk chocolate, roast, vanilla, oak, and bourbon and is really smooth and well integrated. The flavors mirror the aromas. It's really smooth with moderate carbonation and a nice barrel esque vanilla. It has great flavor, actually very similar to the Elijah Craig 18yr that I had this morning. This beer was delicious!"

"O - Deeply disappointed. I should've listened to the two people dining with me when they said I shouldn't do it."

"O/D: perhaps had they mixed in a portion, or larger portion of non-bal aged black sun this would have been better. or, some time aging to mute the alcohol/whiskey notes. i felt it was overall unbalanced in a not so great way. certainly worth a try though, and for those that like the whiskey barrel aspects to be front and center, this may be manna for them."

"Overall not too bad. Wasn't crazy about the barrels or at least how they presented themselves in this beer."
"O- Overall this was a pretty good beer. Pretty complex and enjoyable to drink. I just wish they made it a bit thicker which would have made it exceptional."
""
"Overall – A solid beer I was glad to try, albeit being a bit pricy at $9 for a smaller pour. No noticeable alcohol taste or warmth. Would I drink it all the time? Not at this price – but it would be a nice splurge."

"Rich flavor of bakers chocolate, woody tobacco, vanilla, moderate char, and dry oak in the aftertaste. The bourbon element was just right and well integrated. Dry in the finish with a mild fudgy sweetness. No cherry/tartness as mentioned in reviews of prior batches. Full bodied with low carbonation, though not much bigger than non-BA Black Sun. Easy enough to drink, the abv wasn't noticeable in the taste, but it was certainly felt. FFF's answer to BCS. Nice stuff!"
"Good beer, though. Probably the best bourbon-barrel beer I've had, not so dominated by bourbon flavors as most of them seem to be. I still want to know that I'm drinking beer, and the bourbon quality here is just right. Not sorry I had the beer, though I wouldn't have spent 9 bucks for a tiny glass of it had I known the price. I would have gotten two pints of the moloko milk stout for the same price, as my friend did."
"On tap at FFFs BrewPub. Dark/Muddy in appearance. Right off the bat, you can smell the bourbon. I like the regular Black Sun, but this is such a unique brew, I can't help but prefer it over the regular version. Has a great mix of sweetness and creamy/smooth taste...a must try if you're lucky enough to find it on tap."
"Overall, a nice beer, drank only one and I thought that was enough. Definitely a sipper."
"On tap at Three Floyds and served in a snifter. This beer poured a slick, oily dark brown with a bubbly head of dark tan foam that lasted a little white. Just a touch of slippery lacing was left behind. The aroma of the beer was made up of sweet bourbon notes along with a nice roasted malt backbone. The flavor included bourbon, wood, coffee, and burnt malts. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with very mild carbonation. A nicely done barrel-aged beer. The bourbon blends in nicely with the original beer."
"It's like you're drinking three beers at once and all of them are good."
"D- This beer has a smooth but big wood note and the brightness from the cherries really overpower the dry stout. Even though the wood is big it is not as overpowering as many barrel aged beers. Good choice of barrel and fruit but more malt flavors coming through would really be nice."
"Mouthfeel is somewhat thin for a stout and for a beer this big. Definitely too much time in the bourbon barrel, less time or a new oak barrel and this would have been that much better, however still worthy of a try and pretty solid."
"D: One of the nice things about this beer is that you're not bowled over by a heavy bourbon presence. It's there, but it's balanced by the tart cherries. A pleasant tartness, coupled with a restrained sweetness, and a low alcohol presence considering the 7.2% abv make this one quite drinkable."
