4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Sprecher's Irish Style Stout pours a typical black body and frothy-then-creamy tan head with an average amount of lace left behind. In the nose it's roasty and a nip chocolatey with some mild background hops. The body is medium-light, and it's gently carbonated, leaving it smooth across the palate with just a gentle tingle to awaken the tastebuds. The flavor is fuller, and less acidic than most examples; and it offers a lightly sweet note of gently caramelish malt and yeasty fruitiness before it dispalys its softly roasted side. The bitterness is present, but soft, and just enough to keep the malt in check before leading to a dry finish that lingers with notes of dark chocolate and then lightly charred roastiness.","NeroFiddled","Mar 27, 2006"

3.78,1.9,2,4,4,3,4,"First and foremost, this beer is mislabeled. As a milk stout or milk porter, I would give this one a better review but as an Irish Stoutthere are a few problems. Firstly, this beer suffers from a lack of head retention. Secondly, its transparentblack but transparent. Third, this beer is sweetkinda like a milk stout. Also the body is a bit thin and light. Now for the good pointsthere is an excellent mochachocha richness going on in the flavor. Really, the taste is just sublime. Furthermore, the chocolate/coffee flavors make way for Caramel macchiato and ultimately a wonderfully bitter hopped finish. The aroma is equally delicious. If Sprecher could fix the appearance and thicken the body, this would be one hell of a stout. As it is, its quite drinkable and very nice tasting, just not a very good example of the style.","DaPeculierDane","Mar 03, 2004"
3.47,-6.5,3,3.5,3.5,2.5,4,"Pours a standard black stout color, nothing exciting about it. A quick diminishing head is present for a brief period. Smells of roasty goodness. Smells strictly of roastiness. Taste is initially bitter. The bitterness comes from the roasty malts and hops. Not much of a malt body to back this one up. The signiture Sprecher yeast twang is here too. The mouthfeel of this one is pretty much the same as water, very light.

Medium to full bodied with brisk carbonation, the beer exhibits a bit of a smokey/fishy flavor and some off putting buttery nuances, as well as the usual suspects-dark roasted malts giving the usual chocolate/coffee tastes. I wish this beer leaned more to the restrained bitter/dry than the hedonistic, but hey, it's Sprecher. Decent, but not anything out of the box.","moulefrite","Mar 02, 2003"
