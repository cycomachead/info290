"What else could be better about this beer? It's perfect, 6 awards and it deserves every one of them."

"Overall, this is definitely pretty good but also definitely has some room for improvement.  Might be that I just prefer my dark beers to be on the sweeter side (like the Snowblind doppelbock from the same variety pack--holy crap, that one was good.)  If you like your dark beers dry and roasty rather than sweet and sticky, I'd give it a try."

"O - I actually didn't think it was that bad; my wife said it tasted like a fire pit, but I didn't get a lot of smoke; pretty average,"

"Beautiful dark chocolate brown color that just doesn't want to let the light through. Ok head and lacing. Aroma is malty with roasted coffee flavors coming through. Taste is awesome, very clean and a crisp finish. Hints of coffee and chocolate blend and balance well together. Easily drinkable beer with a nice flavor and a very clean and crisp finish. gotta have some more ofthese!!!!"

"O- very nice beer, hold true to the stout, just not as developed and strong as i might like, i like my stout like arnold and this is kinda like Rich Froning, still got muscles and knows how to use them, but arnold is still bigger and sexier"
"O-It's a great beer.Nothing to call home about but it is well executed. After I try a few more I will form my final opinion."

"O - A great converter for the Guiness drinker. Nothing worth getting too excited about. I wonder if there are nitro kegs out there..."

"Aroma was strong upfront, but the taste and mouthfeel seemed a bit weak the first few swallows. Thankfully, the beer settled down and became quite pleasing to drink. I had to knock a couple of categories up a notch. Definitely worth trying again."

"O - Overall, a very drinkable stout. Great dark smells and flavors and wonderful full bodied appearance."

"O- not a bad stout. an average and I wouldn't mind another."
"O- it's a decent stout with a moderately complex flavor. Not stunning, but not lacking, either."

"Dark pour to this with not a lot of head and practically no lacing to be seen once I worked my way through this. The appearance was that of flat soda but there was just a hint of carbonation that could be detected here. Lots of roasted malt with some coffee and espresso tossed in for good measure, and just a hint of soda-like stickiness. All of the flavors faded quickly and just a hint of the bubbles stuck around in the aftertaste, making this feel more watery than it already was."

"O: Easily sessionable but still has a good body and flavor. Nice coffee tones and malting."
""
""
""

""

""
""
"Poured from a growler into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours pitch black with a large fluffy light brown head. Smells of dark roasted malt, but not strong. Tastes of dark roasted malt and slight coffee. Finish for this light bodied beer is very smooth, carbonation is proper. Overall a slightly above average beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Out of the bottle it is opaque black. A thick tan head forms and leaves heavy lacing around the edge of the glass. Even after the head dissipates with a few sips, a froth remains on the surface. There is little to distinguish the aroma of this beer; it's just faint toasted malt. It carries nice toasted malt onto the palate, backed up with some assertive hops and some serious effervescence for a stout, which adds a lively mouthfeel and nice drinkability. This is a refreshing and enjoyable beer that would be a very good session stout as an alternative to Guinness."
"This is a fine beer. It's nothing remarkable but it is satisfying and enjoyable. I'm grateful to my friend who brought it back from the DC area for me, but I don't see myself trying to trade for another bottle."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by roasted malts. A good bit of roasted malts in the taste as well, some coffee, a bit of smokiness. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"Middle of the road stout, here. Not bad, but nothing special. It is definitely okay for only being 4.2% ABV, but it's not the first thing I would reach for."
"This is a very average-at-best stout. By todays standards I would say below average."
""
"Overall all this beer is average, not bad but not the first thing I would reach for."
"Overall – A decent light stout, but nothing that is really all that fantastic. It is sort of a sweet version of Guinness draught without the nitro. If looking for a low alcohol stout, would take a Guinness over this."
""
""
"This one pours a deep, opaque cola brown, with a modest, fizzy but lasting tan head. The aroma is a fragrant combination of coffee with milk, some nutty roasted malt, and a small hint of chocolate. The flavor features more of the same prototypical stout characteristics with a really nice dry, roasty malt profile. The medium body is a bit syrupy, but it doesn't get in the way of the flavors. Overall, this beer surprised me by providing a decent depth of flavor without feeling heavy."

"Overall: the beer is decent for the style. Highly drinkable but it appears this one sacrifices some flavoring for drinkability. typical of most irish stouts."
""
""
"This is a very robust stout to be an Irish Dry Stout. It drinks more like an American Stout. It has big, roasty notes throughout. It's highly drinkable and very flavorful. It's worth a try but you'll be disappointed if you're looking for a Guinness-type stout."
""
"I love stout and Starr Hill Dark Starr Stout is certainly not a bad stout, but it isn’t as rich and flavorful as I expected. It seems like a good session stout and a nice option for beginners, but I found it somewhat of a letdown based on initial appearance. It seems like it is going to be something much greater, but it is still not a bad beer at all and is certainly deserving of a taste."
""
""
"O: I will say this this would make a great summer, ""around the pool"" stout. Not many I would say that about."
""
"(Overall) Not the finest representation of an Irish Dry Stout I've ever had but it's a decent take on the style. 3"
""
""
"The beer had a lighter feel to it, which is typical for the style. The beer was very easy to drink and had low carbonation. Overall, not a bad attempt at the style, but I would still prefer a Beamish or even a Murphy's."
"The palate is where this suffers IMO. The roasted barley bitterness is a little too high in the mix, making this grainy, acidic and almost burnt, with stale coffee. None of the sweetness of the nose is present here, exacerbating the one-dimensional nature of this beer. Some hop bitterness is perceived as well, especially on the finish. While I know that dry stouts are, by definition, dry, they needn't be watery, which this one is. Moderately carbonated, this beer is too watery for its own good. I can't recommend it, but if it were cold and it were a hot day out, I might pound a couple."
""
""
""
""
"Pours jet black with a nice, slightly tan frothy head. Roasty smell to it. Taste is medium bodied, some nice roasted malts come through with a decent hop presence as well. Taste finishes a bit dry, but overall this is a pretty good stout. Not my favorite of styles, but it's a notch above a Guinness that's for sure."
""
"Overall Impression- A light black ale at most... Missed the mark for a Stout, even a dry version. Wish there was more body and character. However, I did go after this beer because of its label. I will most definitely be keeping it for a souvenir."
""
""
"M: Low carb, dry. Thin."
"Not my favorite style of beer, but really liked this flavorful interpretation."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A decent stout but nothing really noteworthy. Easy to drink and could easily drink again."
""
""
""

"Beer is medium in body and quite bitter on the end, leaving an aftertaste of ash and roasted coffee, some nuts, forward minimal sweetness and a light yeastiness / biscuit feeling. It was fine."
"An Irish dry stout is not a style I care much for, but overall I think Starr Hill did a good job on this interpretation."
"My pour resulted in two fingers of deep-brown head with great retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown with ruby highlights and allowing light to penetrate only at the edges. Nose had a rich chocolatiness to accompany the roastiness of the malt. My mouth was watering by the time I took my first sip. Mouthfeel was medium with a unexpected smokiness initially, followed by a black coffee bitterness, ending with a wash of dark chocolate. Wow! Finish was dry, a little smoky and quite bitter. I really dig this sort of thing, but I may not be for everyone. Once more, worth a try."

"O - I found the Dark Starr Stout to be a very well done take on an Irish Dry Stout. It's tastier than Guinness (at least the stuff you can get in the US, it's been a while since I had it in Ireland) and a great example of the style. By the way, I've had this in the bottle before and would highly recommend having it on draft/growler - it's a beer that is best fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: You'll get more flavor from a day-old Guinness. I recommend trying others."
"O- The bottle is a month and a half past it's date, but I usually assume a stout will hold out longer than advertised, so I decided to review it. Is that the cause of the metallic taste? I don't know. This beer has enough reviews that mine won't shift the grade, and I feel others may feel the same way about dates on stouts, so I think this could be useful information. I will revisit a fresher bottle and change accordingly (if needed.)"
"O: A pretty decent stout. Much better than the one iteration of Guinness that I had. I see that this style is supposed to be lighter in body. Personally I like a stout to be thick. Maybe the Irish style isn't for me. But this is decent."
"Overall an average stout, little thin and the sour after taste does not fit this beer."
"O - a decent Irish stout, despite the nose. Nearly on par with Guinness but certainly not up with the best versions of this style."
"D - the name on this beer made me really want to love this, just like a '69 Dark Star. However I was left a little disappointed with the taste as everything seemed very subtle and somewhat watery. Either way, enjoyable - just not something I would go out of my way to get in the future."
"This beer pours very dark brown (almost black, but not quite) with very little head. The smell and taste are of coffee and chocolate. The beer is pours very thin and is not as thick as most stouts. With that said, this beer is pretty tasty and would definately try again."
"The beer is not especially dark. Brown hued with a thin cap that leaves faint traces of lacing on the glass. The aroma consists primarily of roast, and is subdued. The flavor is very roasty, with a subtle chocolate and smoke presence. The feel is thin and watery, with low carbonation. I wasn't particularly impressed, but I would be willing to try this again. Overall, an OK brew."
"O- This beer for a stout is watered down and light. A more porter style than anything else. Alcohol is light meaning more than one is very do-able. A nice stab at the style but I would label this as a porter and I think the overall reviews would be better."
"O: Nice, but not enough going on. 3.5"
"O: Again, maybe it is just that this one needs to be on tap or fresh. I would encourage anyone who gave this beer poor marks to try one again if ever in the central VA area. Overall a good stout with one of the best roasted malt flavors I have ever experienced, without being overly heavy."
"Pours black topped with a thin but creamy, tan head. Dissipates quickly leaving very little lace. The nose on this one is not good. Faint roasted malts, faint chocolate but pretty bland and something is off here. The taste confirms my suspicions. Faded chocolate turning sour. Off flavors for sure. Medium body with very little carbonation. Not good... could be bad bottle but a drain-pour none the less."
"O- Mediocre per style. It has some good qualities but it also has some off qualities. I would like to visit this again on tap or something and see if I get a different opinion."
"Overall - Not very impressed with this one. I was expecting something different and it just wasn't here. As far as being drinkable, it was. That's about it, though...."
"I coupled this beer with my steak dinner and it went damn near perfect with it. I would definitely have another in the same situation and I would probably enjoy one as an unwind type of beer. My overall impression of the beer might be inflated by the fact that I had a great evening, but the beer might have also added to that great evening. Catch 22."
"D: Pretty alright. But not very much happening here."
"Overall an OK brew, but not much to offer for a Stout. A little light in body and flavor for my liking."
"D - It's drinkable, but I wouldn't grab for this one. The body seems to be lacking, though."
"I had the Dark Starr Stout poured into snifter glass. The appearance was black with a light brown head. There was a strong coffee smell, which I always love. It has a solid, clean, crisp taste that you would expect from the smell The beer was easy to drink and I would have no problem drinking more than one in a single sitting."
"OVERALL: The first word that comes to mind with this beer is bold. It is not particularly complex, but it doesn't need to be. It has an overpowering coffee-flavored nose and a full-on bitter taste. This beer is not the beer to use as an introduction to craft beer or to stouts, but for the seasoned veteran who is looking for a solid beer with a bite, this is it."
"Brought back from North Carolina from a friend. Pours very dark brown... nearly black with a soft tan head and a nice trail of spotty lacing. there is not much on the nose... roasted malt, faint chocolate and maybe some coffee. Faint flavor characteristics as well. Chocolate, light vanilla, caramel and some coffee-like nuttiness in the aftertaste. Light to Medium bodied with a creamy texture. Easy and satisfying to drink, But there is a ""metallic"" taste, not sure if it's the hops, or just the style of stout. Not a bad dry stout, but this won't be one I look for again."
"If you're going to try a Starr Hill brew, go with the Jomo - excellent session"
"**wanted to really like this beer as it is brewed in Crozet, VA where I used to run with rescue squad (Western Albemarle) back in the college days at UVA"
"These are somewhat drinkable, but the lack of prominent flavor makes you want to venture to other darker beers. After one of these I can't imagine wanting to stick with them; I'd leave it in pursuit of a thicker and tastier stout."
"Cheers!"
"Did not enjoy this, at all. With so many truly great stouts out there, I would not even think about drinking another one of these."
"I liked the label being a DeadHead and all. And that its Virginia brewery...wanted to try this during our summer tour of the Virginia/North Carolina region. So my wife and I gave it a shot. Poured out nice with a dense tan head. Not bad considering it should have a low ABV (as consitent with the style). Aroma was roasty with some dark chocolate overtones. Taste was frankly disappointing, very tart upfront and not much else going on in the finish to smooth that out. Mouthfeel was rather thin and the sourness made me not want to continue drinking multiple rounds. I would try this again on tap at the brewery...but I won't be actively seeking this one out in any other parts of the States."
"D - This was a decent beer. It wasnt the best stout i've ever tasted however it did the job. I think it could use a little more flavor."
"A solid good dark stout , but nothing that makes you ( or me) want to go out and get one."
"D-eh it goes down easily but its not something I'll be getting again. The taste stays fairly well. I think i'll be giving the 5 other bottles to other people."
"Nice lookin stout, full of off white head, pitch black, nice lacing, couldn't ask for more. Smells good too, chocolatey, coffee notes, grainy and slightly sweet. Has a real balanced taste, nutty at first, slight bitterness, classic roasted malty flavour, some chocolate and coffee notes make their way through just slightly. Has a bit of a chalky and dry mouthfeel, nice full body with good carbonation. Overall, a recommended, easy drinking stout that is fully balanced in my opinion."
"Good, about what I was expecting. This is one of the best things to come out of Crozet since the 2003 Western Albemarle HS football season"
"For the ABV, not overly drinkable. Those numbers you would think it was a session beer, but I don't think I could have more than a few of these in one night."
"Overall: Overall the beer was OK. Not much in the flavor department. I was a little disapointed because I usually enjoy Starr Hill beers."
"Overall, drinkability is good and this is a better than average irish dry stout. I'm somewhat impressed."
"Taste is a bit watery, but crisp and sharp. It's fairly smokey and sharp very creamy and nice. Mouthfeel is really light and smooth."
"D - Lack of sweetness + decent hopping + low ABV = drinkable"
"D- Excellent. Flavor is pleasing but it doesn't overwhelm or overstay its welcome. Recommended."
"Nothing extraordinairy, but I thought this beer otherwise nice enough. Not sure it's something I'd ever want to order again though."
"Pours black as night with a creamy brown head with excellent retention. Aromas are predominantly roasty but also has a good amount of dark chocolate and a faint whiff of scorched earth. I like it, just as I like the flavors, which follow the nose and then some, adding espresso flavors. This is perhaps the driest dry stout I've had. Better than most of the popular mass-produced Irish stouts out there. Body is a bit more watery than I'd like, but overall this is a delicious beer."
"D: Easily drinkable. Could go for a little more flavor and heftier feel."
"great beer!"
"Drinkability: This is a good, easily drinkable and sessionable stout. Not the best out there, but very enjoyable nonetheless."
"It finishes pretty dry, but no drier than it started. It has a mouth smacking dry and sticky quality though. A little bit more of that fruit from the yeast coming out, with a slight lingering malty quality. Most of the dark malts are gone now, no roast or chocolate, but a little bitterness coming from a slight bit of the roasted malt and some more from some hidden spicy and grassy hops."
"Bottle. Received as an extra. Pours a deep brown black color into my Kentucky Breakfast stout glass. Nice 1 finger tan head the color of mocha. The nose is rather subtle for me. Hints of coffee and chocolate. Very smooth taste with a bitterness in the end. Notes of coffee abound. Dry finish. Lighter mouthfeel than I would have expected."
"I don't really understand his stout. Sweet and effervescent but not creamy...wtf?"
"D: Drinkable, yes, as in you could consume large quantities of it without being too full or drunk. But I wouldn't really want to to be honest."
"Drinks easy, delivers plenty of flavor for the ABV, nice take on the style"
"D: Not a go to style for me. I was done with this before my glass was empty."
"This was the first real local brew I had when I moved here to the Commonwealth. Now's as good a time as any to have it again. It pours an opaque black-brown topped by a finger of thick tan foam that, unfortunately, dies away pretty quickly. The nose is kinda faint, comprising some dark wheat and light coffee. It's not a bad smell, just a weak one. The taste holds notes of roasted malts, burnt wheat, coffee, and a hint of mild sulfuric sour. I know that may sound pretty damn bad, but it's like a more bad-milk-y version of the Guinness sour, as though SH tried to mimic the classic flavor and kinda failed. The body is kinda light, with a fairly high bite of carbonation and sonewhat watery feel. Overall, I assume this was meant as a nice, light, sessionable Irish stout, but it comes off as too light and can't quite nail the Irish qualities it aspires to. It's still not bad, per se, but definitely not all that good, either."
"I've had this a couple times now and it's nice to have another Irish stout around, but I'm turned off by it being thick for the style. Really, it comes off like an English stout to me, but styles aside, this is a tasty beer. There's a tall tan head over the pitch black body. The aroma was heavy with roasted grain and coffee bean notes while the flavored followed those same characteristics, but added a bitter bakers chocolate flavor. Definitiely check this out if you dig stouts of any kind."
"I was disappointed to find out it's a stout. Would make a killer Black Ale. ""Mouthfeel"" suffers point loss for not being a good stout. Good beer, wrong labeling, that's all I'm saying."
"D- Won't seek this out again and I hope the rest of the breweries selections are better --- really loses you in the mouthfeel"
"D- A pretty good beer. I wish that I could get these in CT."
"This brew from Starr Hill was mediocre all around. On the pour the color was typical of a stout, completely opaque - dark black. Retained head well but the nose was a bit drab - coffee and bitter hops mostly, maybe some caramel in there. The taste was almost exactly the nose, not much but coffee and bitterness associated with the stout style ales, and towards the end it seemed almost like the coffee had staled or been burnt. Mouthfeel was a bit light for a stout, at least for me. Too carbonated and too light seem to go badly for this stout. All around, a typical stout without much character, and perhaps could stand some more aroma and a little thicker brew."
"Certainly not the worst thing I've ever had, but I won't be needing this again."
"Not a big fan, no need to revisit this one, just a run of the mill, albeit below average, boring stout..."
"Honestly, before reading the profile I thought this was an American stout -- I thought the hop profile was very assertive & the beer ended more bitter than I expect a stout to. The sour milk character brought me around, but the roastiness is still a little more than I need. I'm happy to finish the 6er I bought, but not in one sitting, & I probably wouldn't seek it out."
"Lighter in body, like a canned Guinness,relatively smooth, some dryness in the finish. The cigarette ash note fortunately fades pretty quickly. I suspect it is a combo of over-roasted/burnt malt and smoke combining less than favorably. The molasses note might also be at play here. Otherwise, quite good flavor-wise but weak in the body aspect. Effervescence is very light and all the aftertaste is in the back of the palate. A very slight warming is present as well."
"Pours an opaque oily sable with a fairly thick pale tan head. Aroma is strong and spicy with a firm undertone of molasses and a hint of miso. Flavor is smoky with tones of coffee and molasses and just a trace of hoppy bitterness. Texture is smooth and fairly tingly."
"Poured a very nice deep deep brown, with some decent head and lacing. Semi-deep aroma, with some decent roasted grain attributes, but not much else to make it deeper. Nice taste, some decent roasted grains, but it had a very sweet, almost lactose, taste to it at the end, which also may account for the lighter aroma. Goes down well."
"D - Nice to try. Average stout."
"D - This wasn't a bad stout...the low ABV and lighter mouthfeel lead to nice session beer...let this one warm up a little as the flavors came out more towards the end of the beer"
"D - It's an okay session stout, but borders on the bitter side."
"This is my first beer from the state of Virginia. Pours dark brown with a white head. The aroma is pretty faint with some dark malts and dark chocolate. The flavor is bitter malts with some chocolate. Light-medium, slightly watery mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"A little roasty for a dry stout, but pretty drinkable."
"Well I expected a bigger beer with lots of coffee and maybe a hint of chocolate. In fact this was something I was looking forward to since it was the closing of out tasting session today and we save the darker beers for last. Keep in mind I don't like big stouts, but since Ten Fidy I have kept an open mind. Aroma was coffee, this sorta got my lips wet, as for taste....wow SMOKEY. I feel like a chain smoker just exhaled a pack of 305's in my mouth. Though it calms down it was a bit too smoky for my taste. Good beer if you like stouts but I don't."
"Thin and watery mouthfeel, a bit off-putting. This beer looks and smells pretty good, but otherwise is average at best."
"Overall, its decent. But nothing I would seek out again."
"D – It is not my favorite, but I do love looking at the bottle."
"Overall it was ok, nothing really great. Maybe it was me but it just falls in line with a bunch of other average stouts."
"Very easy to drink, once again, style considered. I personally wouldn't want another right after but I could see fans of the style order two or three in a night"
"Buy Again? Yes, but there are better stouts."
"Bottle pours a dark mahogany body with a tall khaki head. Retention is good and lacing generously coats the side of the Duck-Rabbit pint glass. Weak aroma has hints of cocoa and dark fruits. Light medium body is moderately carbonated. The taste has some dark roasty bitterness that contains elements of coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Powdered cocoa is the dominant flavor and is joined by faint notes of nuttiness and dark fruits. Dark roasty finish. Pleasantly drinkable if not very memorable."
"Thankfully, Dark Starr Stout packs more flavor than the aroma suggested, as black patent & chocolate malts add a roasted bitterness to the palate. Dry cocoa and soil on the finish. A little lighter in body that I would like for an irish stout, but the tight carbonation is on-target and adds a subtle creaminess that pairs nicely with the bitter roastedness of the finish. Good, not great, although in its defense, this was a beer nearing the end of its shelf life. Still, a tasty Irish Stout to have within arm's reach on a cold night in the West Virginia hills."
"This one was a bit much for me, hard to drink. Poured to a black color with a good tan head. Nose is of coffee and chocolate. Taste at first sip is like a black olive. But as you continue to drink coffee, chocolate and nuts are the stars of the show along with that unmistakable alcoholic flavor. Very good when it is cold, but when it starts getting warm....well, we'll just say not very appetizing."
"D- Good, can have more than one as long a s you dont get bored with it."
"Note: Looked up the Dark Starr website and see it has won a ton of awards. Maybe I didn't give it enough credit, but it was bang on for the style."
"Medium light body very thin could have used so thicking. Very drinkable a good gateway stout."
".. this is a safe, but good stout. While it's complex - it's not really original by any means.... if that makes any sense... like hints of a lot but deliverance of a little..."
"I plan to create a more detaied review in the future pending my next opportunity."
"The glass is a quick drink, and a second would be easy to do."
"I really like this beer -- fantastic complexity, but I think it has a little too much carbonation that prickles the tongue. A bit more creaminess (without being a cream stout) would go a long way. On a nice cold day -- this is definitely a go to beer!"
"D - A nice Dry Stout. The malt is suitably acidic and not too complex with perhaps a touch more caramel depth and less acidic roast character than more traditional examples of the style. While this is not my favorite style, it is a nice interpretation and I could drink a couple more."
"drinkability: just an avergae stout, was not horrible by any means. I still would drink it again, but nothin to go crazy about."
"The taste is slightly sweeter, with some sweeter notes in teh chocolate, but not a lot. I get a bit more of the coffee as well, This is the first Irish dry stout i have had that was actually dry. Very good beer. I liked it a lot. Its a little thin on the mouth feel, and i could use a little less of the coffee notes, but still excellent beer."
"Drinkability: If you like coffee, you'll love this beer. It's pretty good but seeing as I hate coffee, I probably won't get it again. This is one of the strongest coffee tastes I've met in a beer."
"This beer was just OK. I bought it at Wine Warehouse in C-ville."
"Pours near black with an off-white head that hangs around a bit. The aroma is of roasted espresso with some dark, fruity esters. The taste is nice for the style - very roasty but not astringent, and finishes quite dry. The carbonation is a bit high, but other than that, very drinkable and nice example of the style."
"D- Overall, a pretty decent stout that is worth a try."
"Drinkability: Not so high. The flavors are not particularly enjoyable. If the malts were more roasty than burnt and the hops a little more balanced, I think it could be really pleasant thanks to the great body. I guess the beer guy was right."
"Pours a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy tan head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with a nice touch of chocolate/toffee, with some vanilla notes. The taste is malty, sweet, with some chocolate/toffee, nice touch of vanilla. Medium body. Drinkable, this brew surprised me, pretty tasty."
"All in all, not bad. A sweet stout."
"Drinkability: Not very robust but a passable virginian stout"
"Medium body, appropriate carbonation. Very dry finish. Kind of watery."
"M/D - medium bodied, slightly oily, the roasted flavor is almost a burnt taste. pretty good overall but doubtful i'd seek out another"
"M/D - Medium bodied with a light creaminess. Nice roastiness in the aftertaste. Easy drinking but the smokiness is a little overwhelming. I have enjoyed smoked beers in the past, but this one was just a little too rough around the edges."
"Drinkability: A great small stout, that I could enjoy many of. All flavor that doesn't linger around as an aftertaste. Nicely done."
"D: A pretty nice, coffee-heavy, Irish dry stout from Starr Hill. I need to start delving into some of these local beers more often. This is promising."
"Thanks to chaz over on realbeer for this one. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my nonic Imperial pint glass. The stout appears a deep dark brown color with about two fingers of pillowy ecru foam. The head settles to a thin layer within a few minutes. Nose and flavor are of medium roasted grains, milk chocolate, fresh mild roasted coffee, a bit of vanilla. Smooth throughout and finishing dry. Adequate amount of carbonation. Any fan of the style needs to give this one a try."
"D: This is a mighty fine and simple Irish Dry Stout. This is exactly what I expect from a standard Irish Stout. Easily consumed and sit nice and light. Easy to down a couple of these at any given time. This is basically a nicely amped up Guinness to tell the truth. Just better and not as mass produced. Just a good all around brew that I would absolutely have again. Thanks again, Larry. This is oh so nice."
"Not my cup of tea."
"Jet black-small tan head and leaves some decent lacing on down. Mellow roasted aroma and a slight espresso tinge to it. Decent roasted flavors. Lingering bittersweetness to it. Somewhat grainy. Nice body-really does come off as a ""dry"" stout. Overall a nice stout. Very sessionable at 4.8%. I could see this being good on draft as well. Worth a shot."
"Loved the logo, and the brewery has an interesting story as well."
"I had this while visiting relatives in Charlottesville, VA and it was in their refrigerator. The beer poured a black color with very little head. The nose was a pleasant odor of malt and coffee. If you sniffed it I would go so far as to say it is what a ""dark beer"" should smell like. The attack is clean and smooth as is the flavor. The finish is really where you get most of the flavors to come out. The coffee flavor is consistent with the nose and the smoke flavors are a not a surprise, but pleasant and unexpected based on the nose. Overall I would call it clean and smooth. Very drinkable."
"Deep dark black/brown, with a small head floating on top. Nose is slightly roasted, crisp and malty. Gentle chocolate. Very mild. Taste is like an average stout. Slight hints of cream. Boring but unoffensive. Mouthfeel is thinner than expected. Still, overall a very drinkable beer thanks to the low ABV and it's gentle qualities."
"I could not resist the name. Poured a tarry-black color. Surprisingly lighter in body than I would have expected, great drinkability. Was a bit too cold, so the flavors took awhile to reveal themselves - a solid core of rich roasted malt and some nutty carob-like flavors. Smooth and silky. A very fine stout."
"I wouldnt recommend trying this if you are looking for anything new just kind of an ok beer."
"This is a beer where the scores don't do it justice. There's excellent synergy here and my enjoyment of this goes well beyond the scoring of its individual elements. It drinks quite easily and could be considered a borderline fine sessionable effort (OK, enough with the fucking lectures from across the pond about what is and what isn't a session beer, by the way. I get it.) Well-crafted and solid after all these years."
"Overall, not the best or most balanced stout, but it is delicious in its own way, worth a try!"
"A nice, well done stout. I like roasty stouts and this serves it well. Very enjoyable."
"This brew has a very interesting flavor. Not really your typical stout but I like tasting something different. It gets kind of boring when all the beers of a catagory start to taste the same."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint. Purchase before June notched on the label. Poured two shades shy of black with a dense khaki-colored head that stuck around for a while. Brew left behind concentric rings of lacing as it was consumed. Nose was malty, roasty, nutty with a suggestion of caramel. Taste consistent with nose with a little hops detectable at the finish. Mouthfeel was somewhat watery with a lively effervescence that leaves a slight prickle on the tongue that lingers between sips. All and all a decent session stout with a fair amount of flavor. The major detraction for me was in the mouthfeel."
"Dark, nearly black in color, some dim mahogany highlights shining through the bottom of the glass. A tall, sturdy head of tan foam sits on top leaving plenty of lace. Aromas of mild roasted coffee, chocolate, and smoke. Roasted malt flavor...dry, bitter, unsweetened chocolate, weak coffee, and some char-iness. Medium-light bodied and slightly creamy, although there is an overall dry, bitter quality. Not bad and perfectly drinkable."
"Good beer. I was suprised and am looking for the oppertunity to pick up a sixer."
"impressive looks - black with a creamed coffee colored head that holds well and leaves nice lace. nose has milk chocolate, a touch of dark roast coffee and some subtle smoke and hop notes. taste is more of the same, but just not as pronounced as i would have liked. a bit thin, but a pleasant drink overall. i would love to try it on tap/nitro, and i believe this is a decent offering from starr hill, i just won't seek it out."
"12 oz bottle. Near black pour with a surprisingly dark tan head that lasted throughout the beverage's life. Dark chocolate, roast malt and coffee aromas. Flavor not quite as nice as the nose, but still nice. Coffee and mocha, but a little sourness. Just a bit chalky, but goes along okay with the dryness that should be there. Real nice dry coffee finish. The only thing standing in this beers way is the slight sour. Overall good, drinkable and worth trying. I'm sure this would be sessionable enough."
"I would be very interested to have this on a nitro-tap."
"overall- would like to try on draft"
"Unfortunately none of the aromas come through in the taste. Just a sour, ashy taste with a thin mouthfeel. I thought this could be past due but according to the bottle it's still good. Bummer."
"This is a dark stout - opaque black when held up to the light. Pours with a slight tan head. Notes of coffee in the aroma and taste. Has a bitter aftertaste, but not overwhelming. I found it a pleasant drink - it complemented a roast turkey dinner nicely. I'd drink it again."
"Drinkability: Well, this is day 2, and I am enjoying this tasty beverage. Had a few too many last night for a writeup."
"drinkability: ok"
"D - Easy to drink -flavors are subdued, therefore it does not wear on me. If I liked the beer more, it would be very drinkable."
"This one pours a deep and dark black and brown color with a very nice smell of roasted malt. The taste is rich roasted malt with a very nice dry finish. This one is a little to carbonated for me, so it would probably be perfect on tap, but is a very good dry stout."
"Drinkability: A decent beer from a style I can't say I care for too much, though it beats the pants off Guinness and does largely manage to hit all teh right notes. The drinkability's up there, given that it's thin, crisp, and decently flavorful without being over the top."
"D: This is a drinkable beer with good character. A good American answer to an Irish stout."
"A Virginian-brewed answer to those hankering for a Guinness. A roast beef and cheddar would pair well."
"Dark Star is one of my favourite films so I thought I'd better have a crack at this stout, and I'm not disappointed. Quality stuff. Deep, rich dark colour with a medium tan head, and coffee all over the nose. Almost a burnt toast smell, but in a good way, and both the coffee and the toast come out in the taste. Coffee? Toast? Sounds like breakfast to me. I wouldn't mind a bottle of this first thing in the morning. Very strong, dry stout aftertaste. Nice carbonation and good body. Definitely not the last bottle of Dark Starr I'll ever be drinking."
"Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Not bad for a stout. Again, I am pleasantly surprised with the offerings from Starr Hill."
"D: The stout hits some notes and misses on others. The smoke profile is interesting but it needs to be supporting a bigger stout body."
"single from Total Wine Fairfax, notched as best by January"
"A deep, near black pour with ruby edges and a nice tan head that falls slowly to a ring, leaving lacing down the glass. At first the smell is surprisingly smoked malts that seem overbearing. I think it was just a bit too cold. The smoke fades, though still present, and displays roasted malt. It's actually very inviting when at the right temperature. Taste is pretty nice as well. The smoke is more complimentary to the rest of the flavors. Some light caramel along with chocolate that is a bit sweet and milky. A dose of roast coffee comes through as well, giving a light bitter finish. Still, it's a little light and seemingly watered down compared to the nose. Nice mouthfeel that is light and slightly creamy at first. A good roast bitter finish, lightly drying. Overall, this is a pretty solid brew. I could drink a bottle or two."
"I'm not so sure Dark Starr Stout is ""the gift of great beer"" like its label promises. I would definitely say though it was a gift of good beer; there certainly was nothing wrong about this dry stout. I could certainly have a couple if I ever find myself in Charlottesville. Thanks Mary!"
"This poured an opaque black with dark tan head. It smelled like milk and sweet chocolate malt with subtle earthy barley and a hint of coffee. It tasted like earthy barley blended with weak coffee, with a bit of chocolate. It was watery with no carbonation, and had a brief mocha aftertaste. Overall this had a fairly bland flavor and weak body, but it was much cleaner than their pale ale. So it wasn't very rewarding to drink, but I wouldn't be opposed to having it again."
"If you're in VA and looking for a smooth, tasty, and sessionable stout, this one is for you. Plenty of roasted malt flavor in each sip. Recommended."
"A decent beer and would be pretty easy to have this over a long session. This could be a solid on hand beer but I think there are others that are better. Good local beer, though. I liked it."
"D = Other than the carbonation, this is a pretty drinkable beer and I could imagine using it for session drinking."
"Not too bad to drink. Light body and low abv (for a stout)."
"-Oelergud"
"Received a dark brown/leather brown body w/ one-finger head that died quickly. An alright malty smell with some light fruit notes. A medium-bodied beer that had an alright malt flavor, not really able to key on a specific malt as it was somewhat bland. A light-dry finish as it goes down a tad slick for a stout. Mild fruit flavor also. Not a bad stout, but nothing spectacular."
"Out of the bottle the beer pours with quite a good lingering head. The color quite dark, perhaps black without the roasty shades of some beers in this style. I like the taste that was more bitter than I was expecting from even a dry Irish Stout. The mouthfeel is disappointingly watery as is the finish. Chestnut tones in the flavor and a light smokiness build cumulatively as you drink the beer."
"Overall, this was a very drinkable Irish Dry Stout. I don't usually drink this style, but if I do, it will be the Dark Starr Stout."
"Quite a dark stout with only a thin glint of reddish-brown at the edges when held to the light. Great aroma of whole coffee beans and chocolate. Flavor is lighter than the aroma, but adds some charred pipe character to the bitter roasted malt. Mouth feel is medium-to-full bodied, but I sensed a little thinness that made me want the creaminess of a nitro pour. Finishes with some burnt malt/ toast flavors with a mild reprise of the aroma. Good stuff."
"D - very drinkable. Flavorful but goes down easy. Nice beer indeed. I would definitely buy again."
"D: You could drink a lot of these in a sitting, but I would want something with a little more flavor. Maybe dry stouts aren't my thing."
"Poured into a Guinness pint glass a near opaque black but for a bit of ruby tint when held to the light a thinner light mocha colored head is gone quickly leaving no tace of lace.The roastiness is more subdued in the nose than the palate it shows thru with some vanilla,char, and cocoa.Highly roasted on the palate like dark French roast coffee and bitter unsweetened chocolate with a hint of molasses the only sweetness this brew shows.This is one style of beer I like on nitro it rounds the beer out better,Iam sure this would be very good on nitro as is pretty good."
"D - Outstanding, this is a tasty and extremely sessionable brew. A definite revisit for myself, as well as a reco for you."
"Good example of an Irish Dry Stout. Saving the remaining bottles for St. Patrick's Day."
"D: Because of its medium body, this is a very drinkable dry stout that is has plenty of fruitiness that is balanced with bitter chocolate and coffee flavors. A really enjoyable stout."
"I've had Starr Hill stuff on two other occasions, once at a festival (Microfestivus, Roanoke, VA) and once on tap (Depot, Charlottesville, VA). Neither were this Dark Star Stout, and neither were that impressive. If Irish dry stouts are your thing, this probably won't qualify as an all-time favorite but it'll probably be worth trying once or twice. It's really not to my tastes, and it's got some good traits, but amongst others in the style I've had better. It sure looks hot though."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink but not particularly memorable"
"Mouthfeel on this one was nice, as it is a lighter bodied stout. Easy drinking in the heat of summer. Quite nice and highly recommended."
"Overall impression: Nice beer - but I think this should be classified as a dry stout. Very drinkable, interesting flavors."
"A very drinkable stout. Despite its heaviness, it felt like I could have knocked back a few of them without tiring."
"Dark Starr arrives at the table a bit too cold in a pint glass, with a black body and a small, light brown head that reduces to a collar. It smells of sweet blue/blackberry jelly, coffee, chocolate and roasted malts, raisins, and maybe even strawberry. On the palate there are all these flavors along with leather, tobacco, apple?, lactose?, smoke, and green, almost piney/spicy hops that impart a mild bitterness. It has a light to medium body with equal carbonation, and leaves a medium finish. Overall it's a good stout, one I've had before and will have again, but I wish this particular pint weren't served so cold."
"I got this pint at Malones in Lexington, Va. It poured a very dark color. The head was small and very coffee orianted. The lacing that did appear left fast and the retention wasn't much better. The smell was essentially absent, but what I could sense was sweet. The tast was a really good coffee flavor. The mouthfeel was exceptional. It was rigid yet smooth and not thick. This was a great brew."
" Balanced with Magnum (Bittering hops) and a clean tasting English Ale yeast OG 1.048 and a mild 4.75% abv make for a good session beer."
"14oz glass presentation. After the nitro effect settled down, there was a pleasing 3/4"" mocha/latte head over the dark brown/black opaque brew. Aroma of dark malts and coffee, and the flavor follows along these lines, with a somewhat sedate coffee character. Mouthfeel okay, albeit a bit thin, and the drinkability acceptable as well."
"Color is an inky blackness. Single-finger thick layer of dense tan-colored head. Thick lacing of the glass with distinct rings. Aromas are yummy, with all sorts of chocolate and espresso with a toasty malt base to it. Flavor is classic dry irish stout. Great mix of roasty, toasty malt base with a dash of bitter baking chocolate. Smoky middle, followed by a long-lasting and slightly bitter finish. On the thick side in terms of mouthfeel, with a decent creamy factor. Quite drinkable and one I'd not hesitate to ask for again."
"On tap at the brewpub. On the first taste I thought WOW, but my impression lessed over time and consumption of the beer."
"Both the aroma and taste are controlled by a coffee and chocolate quality. In fact, when I was drinking this beer, I was looking around for the person drinking an incredible smelling coffee, no kidding. The aroma is that powerful. The taste follows very similarly to the aroma. It is dictated by coffee and chocolate. There is very little burnt, or typical dry flavors associated with many dry stouts (as the restaurant/brewery classifies it). Incredibly easy to drink. Very smooth and silky. This is the perfect after dinner beer."
"Poured a deep, deep brown, with a thin creamy head. Smells strongely of toasted malt, with some nice coffee overtones. A smooth beer, starting with a nice malty chocolate flavor, with a mocha aftertaste. Very smooth, very creamy, but a little lighter than most people expect from a stout. Combines for a good drinkability, definitely a solid performer for an Irish-style stout."
"Pours blacker than night with a thick creamy off white nitro head on it.  The aromas are all coffee, espresso, and chocolate with a surprising lack of burnt smells.  The taste starts off with some great coffee flavors and smoothly slides into a nice mocha/chocolatefinish.  Tons of roasted malts in this but no burnt bitterness is detectable.  Super smooth and creamy, it could just use a little more body to it.  Great drinkablity due to the incredible sily smoothness.  One of the better stouts I have had.  This rates right up there with the Mocha Java Stout from Z Street Brewing, absolutely awesome."
