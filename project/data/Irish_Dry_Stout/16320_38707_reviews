"I am drinking a 3 year old bottle of Stouterik  and it has held up well. It pours brilliant deep dark brown under a finely bubbled 2” lightly tan tinted foam collar. It has a big sherry nose with a whiff of toast in the background. Sherry, dark dried fruit with mild roast and traces of caramel and chocolate form the palate. It is very smooth, creamy and surprisingly light bodied with above average carbonation."

"Billed as a stout, but tasted more like a lager with some caramel malt. Pretty drinkable, some nice flavor, but not the big stout flavor I was expecting. Overall not very exciting."

"Semi-dry and medium bodied, the ale closes with a sense of lightness (dangerously close to watering), light acrid char and campfire bitterness close the session even as colanut flavors persist in aftertaste."

"Thin, even at 4.5%. Lots of bitterness, which is not quite balanced by the complexity of flavor. Belgian stouts often have a unique take, but there's nothing special going on here - there are a thousand English beers like this (OK, maybe not quite so lean and roasty.)"

"Enjoyable, and surprisingly relatively light. Just not amazing."
"taste is much better than the smell. but still, not quality stuff. there's that little twang of 'something' that just lends to the credence that it is not a quality brew.... a bitterness like from a corn or something not really worthy. it's got a certain 'earthiness' which just seems to follow other brews of that aren't great. I guess it's decent for a drink, but i'm not buying it again. especially for the price."

"A pretty well made medium stout. You can keep looking for some complexity in the taste and can find it. I enjoyed it."

"Pours a hazy dark brown,  thick soapy light brown head,  thin layer sticks with a  few splotches  of lace behind.  Smell:  toffee,  mild earthy and herbal hopping,  brown bread,  mild roast.  Taste:  mild roast,  toasted brown bread,  lots of toffee and chocolate,  dark fruit note,  earthy  hopping to balance with citrus peel note.  Pillowy,  dry finish.  nice."

"Not sure if this was attempting to be a dry stout really, but it manages to be a standout for the style I'd say. Very drinkable and nice flavors."

"Poured from a 330ml bottle. Pours a dark chestnut brown. There's not too much to the nose: light roasted malt notes and little bit of fruit. Unremarkable. Taste is similar to that of a well-made porter, though maybe a little on the light-bodied side. It's roasty and smoky with good carbonation. A good session beer for those who like dark brews."

"Black with tan head, starting at two fingers and then fading quickly. Dark, roasted malts on the nose with a sort of bitter, astringent smell as well. After a while it takes on a wet dog smell, which I can’t say is good. I get a lot more chocolate drinking it than with the aroma. The malt is really roasty, almost burnt-like. There’s a slight hint of bitter coffee, but that’s all. The taste is very nice and more complex than I was expecting. The finish is dry, like an Irish stout should be, but I think there is way too much carbonation in this. I want it to glide down my throat smoothly, but instead my tongue is assaulted by CO2. I think this could have been an excellent stout, but the carbonation takes a lot away from it in my opinion."
""
"O - Overall, a solid stout out of Belgium. Have to pick up a bottle of this."

"Actually impressively multi-dimensional for a 4.5% stout. The chocolate flavor builds a lot with time and some warmth but the yeast still shines. Best example of the style I have tried thus far."
"On-tap at Moeder Lambic on 4/7/2013. Pours a deep brown with light highlights at the base. Head is rocky, 1.5 inches, dense and khaki-colored. The lacing on this beer is incredible and creates a basket weave pattern along the walls of the glass. Nose expresses dark malts, lactose, artificial sweetener, a roasty quality and perhaps a kiss of vanilla. Taste is roasty/earthy with some char, lactose sweetenss and some hops bittering towards the back the lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body, but closer to light, with an even carbonation - nothing spectacular, but spot on for what it should be. Overall, a solid low abv stout, but not something I need to revisit."
"Poured into a snifter glass. The beer pours dark brown to black with a thick, light tan head. The beer smells of dark roasted malt, chocolate, and fig. It's an interesting smelling stout. The taste follows the nose with some nice back end bitterness. The dark roasted malts also give some nice roasty flavors to the beer. The chocolate and light fig flavor also comes through. The body is light with moderate carbonation. The finish is dry. This is an easy stout to drink. This is a good beer."

"330ml bottle. Pours a hazy dark brown with a small quickly dissipating tan head. Aroma is of dry dark roasted malt, chocolate with a bit of dark dried fruity esters. Taste is sweet dry roasted chocolate malt flavored with some mild bitterness. Palate is a medium body with some good carbonation. Finishes with a dry roasted dark cacao malt with some bitterness on the end for balance. Overall not the best in class but a good respectable brew."

"O: Having tried a fair few, this is hands down the best session stout I've ever had. I hate the fact this isn't widespread on nitro, because it would whipe the floor with the watery cold low-grade coffee that a lot of people think typify the genre. As a relatively cheap session beer, this is quite simply glorious. Something you could, and probably would, drink all night, every night. Absolutely amazing and another great effort from the people at De La Senne, who are rapidly rising to well-earnt superstar status here in Belgium."
"Note: Had this beer to celebrate @metter98's birthday - since he is an enjoyer of stouts and his name is Erik."
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and sessionable. The Belgian yeast makes the taste a little more interesting when compared to other Irish Dry Stouts."

"O- really glad i tried this one. fun and easy drinking, i wouldn't turn down another bottle of this in a second."
""
"Beer is medium in body, light on the finish, mildly bitter from the roast, otherwise it is just a stout, well made and I'd have it again but nothing special here."
""
""
"Notes: Tasty, drinkable and a very good dry finish tops it off well and a good one to pick up. Cheers."
"O: Nice for the style, though it's not my favorite (you can always tell when I explicitly grade to style). If I ever wanted this type of heavy-handed roasty, light body/ABV stout, I'd pick up another Stouterik."
""
"Overall; simple, solid, well done, guessing it probably costs a pretty penny in the states and as such might have influenced the reviews I read..."
"Enjoy this with Buffalo wings or a cheesy dip. On its own, Stouterik does not hold up, but as a beverage for Monday Night Football, it will be fine."
"Pours a dark brown color with a good light tan head and some lacing on the sides of the glass. The nose carries distinctive Belgian yeast along with some chocolate and roast. Flavor hits on the roast and chocolate with yeast and fruit in the background. Some light spice. Medium body with a semi-dry finish. Pretty good."

"This is good, but far from the best belgian stout i've tried. Overall Decent but nothing i would be dying to try again."
"for the price ill definitely pass...i can have much tastier sessions for a third of the price"
"This is one light beer. Perfect for today since it is 97F outside, but I wouldnt really seek this one out. This one could be a beginners foray into craft beer or even the stout style. Rather boring."
" This is a pretty tasty beer for the strength, light bodied, but nice mild caramel from the malt and light earthy elements that seem to blend with the hops well. slightly piney and mild pepper from the hops which actual are more dominant from mid taste on. I thought this was decent overall, not great. I don't drink a lot of this style but I don't think this has a lot of stout-like, more of a slightly hoppy brown -it is drinkable though."
"Poured black with a finger of tan head that retained and laced fairly well. Roasty malts and cocoa on the nose, and a surprising mild hop presence. Smooth malts in the taste, cocoa and coffee, providing a dry and somewhat bitter finish. (That's probably what I detected in the smell, and not hops.) Medium bodied for a stout, a little thin, but still easily drinkable, even if not the best of its style."
"This was a very light beer for a Stout. I must agree with some of the comments below saying it looks like a dark wheat beer. The head is rather large and does coat the glass nicely. I expected this stout to have a much darker body to it and a ton more flavor to it. The brews mouthfeel was smooth and on the lighter side. Not as heavy as most stouts in the realm. I know most Irish Stouts are on the lighter side too, but since this came from Belgium I was thinking perhaps it would have been amped up with something a little more interesting. Wouldn't need to have this one again."
"The foam was dark wheat in color, thick, semi-smooth and very lacy. The color was a dark burgandy and semi-opaque. The smell was wheaty at best with some fruity and bitter accents with some nutty undertones. It had a stong bready taste with a malty undertone and some nutty accents. Mouthfeel - medium to heavy bodied and smooth. Drinkability - other than the semi-sweet accent, I had an ok session."
"D: A well made, drinkable stout. Well worth checking out."
"I am a big fan of rich imperial stouts, so lets see how one stands up with lower ABV than usual. Stouterik pours out a dark brown color, with a finger of white heading. Light earthy notes comes forth from the smell, as well as cocoa, milk and caramel. Milk chocolate comes in the front of the flavor, followed by a hint of char and bitter coffee (think cafe con leche). Mouthfeel is light and refreshing for a stout, not something one sees very often. Drinkability is superb, even sessionable in many respects. Talk about a stout that is pushing the boundaries in the opposite direction of most. Rather than high ABV and exotic ingredients, De La Senne succeeds with a low alcohol stout that is complex enough on its own. A must try as far as I am concerned for any self proclaimed stout lover out there."
"Jet black with small brown head. Mild but complex aroma, Very dry and bitter. Taste of dark roasted malt, chocolate, fruit and hops. Exceptionally drinkable dry stout, medium bodied and very enjoyable."
"D- I really liked this one, it's one of the better ones in the style with a Belgian twist. A light ABV makes for a session in the winter, but a tad pricy for the outcome, which does not deter from the beer, great stuff from a brewery I need to drink more from."
"D- easy on the abv and full of flavor. Nice stuff for sure."
"wow. Really. That is a much lower abv than i expected. This is a pleasant suprise. a dark american porter resemblance of a belgian stout. Pour is a reddish black with a mocha head of about two finger with an aggressive pour. Nose is a mineral based chocolate. The feel is grainy like sweet and quite dry. This is not particularly malty stout. Its salty and has a lingering oyster shell quality. One of the dark beers that i you say goes well with shellfish. Palate of chalk mineral bitterness and and mild sweetness of leeks. Hunger inducing salty. Quite lean feel. A nice belgian twist."
"The nose is pretty excellent. Moderate roasted malt, a mellow creaminess and a definite Belgian yeast character are all present, I almost wonder if a beer brewed with the second runnings from Black Albert will smell like this. The yeast is present as a spicy character, a little cinnamon sugar like? Moderately sweetened chocolate is rather prominent here, and swirling the glass brings up some coffee too. Pretty excellent. The palate opens with a prominent, dry, roasty bitterness, moderately grainy. Quite dry, there's no real sweetness here. Cocoa, a little coffee and some roast are all present, as expected, and the yeast character is solid too. Mildly spicy, there's also a light fruitiness present. Drying on the finish, this beer is light in body and has a moderate-high level of carbonation. The finish has a lingering coffee grounds bitterness, coupled with some roasted malt bitterness. One of the driest beers I've had in recent memory, this is very, very drinkable. Perfectly sessionable."
"A good, not great, dry stout, that would be a good lunchtime drink."
"Drinkability is off the charts because of the amount of flavor packed into this low ABV offering. Highly recommended but I don't think I will be paying $4 a bottle for this one again when there are comparable cheaper offerings around."
"Beer bistro. Black, with a little permanent off-whte head, lace on the sides of the glass, and rising carbonation bubbles. Sourish aromas, mild roast as well. The mouthfeel is below average. The taste is a mild stout, with roast right there. Sourish roast, a tad astringent, in the finish."
"Drinkability: High. A good Belgian stout that is closer to a modest Russian Imperial Stout than an Irish Dry Stout. Still worthy nonetheless."
"Good stout for its type"
"D: A well made Irish Dry Stout, even though it's coming from Belgium, there's nothing Belgian about it, true to style."
"Poured with a nice, light brown to tan, medium sized head and no lace. Color is an almost opaque dark brown with amber highlights. Nose is roast malt, cocoa, coffee, a hint of skunk. Flavor is a litlte like nose minus the skunk. Dry stout with a bit of fruit arond the edges. Not a lot of depth. Body is ok but carbonation is a little too fizzy for the style. Finish is like flavor with some legs. Neat label though."
"I picked this up from the marked down cart at Bestway today not knowing what to expect from this beer,I was pleasantly surprised.Poured into a tulip glass more of a dark brown than black,a fluffy one finger slight off white head atop that settled into a creamy mass leaving two rings of broken lace behind.Lighter cocoa aromas with some metallic/iron,the roast comes thru more as it warms a little.Flavors are very much like a dry stout up front,unsweetened chocolate,dark roast,and char make up the initial flavors, a decent fruitiness comes in late rounding it out very well.Very nice for a ""smaller"" stout,much more complex than expected."
"I think this is a tasty version of a stout, and at 4.5% it has alot of the taste elements of stronger Belgian ales, yet is sessionable. Packs alot of flavor that stronger ales are noted for but with considerably less alcohol. On the brewer's and distributor's websites, this beer is described as a pure version of a classic Belgian stout, made by brewers who are dedicated to making beers using old traditions. This style of beer is often altered to make it more widely appealing using cheap methods, such as nitrogenation or adding spices. I value the purity of their approach, which to me is evident in the taste, just as it is when I have an Orval. This one needs to be resampled to be fully appreciated."
"It was a pleasant experence but still left a little to be desired."
"Poured with a rather large, bubbly head. Very creamy in appearance with a burnt, light brown look. Dark, coffee-colored appearance, but the head dominates, even with its lacking lacing. Aromas have a decent mix of cream, toffee, coffee, burnt sugars. Taste has more of an acidic, bitter fruit taste to it mixed with a milky cream. Like you can see in this review, the creamy aspect is a plus to this drink, but its not overpowering or too off-balanced. Overall, decent."
"D- This beer has a pretty thin flavor with some interesting qualities and a unique hop profile. This beer intrigued me but I'm not sure I could drink to many of them."
"This beer pours black with ruby highlights to the edges when held to the light. An offwhite 1/2 finger head sits on top with decent head retention and wispy lacing that is left on the glass. The nose is thick with caramel and roasted malts. There is also a touch of smokiness and roasted coffee notes. Taste is of the roasted and caramel malts, and the burnt/roasted coffee. Touches of molasses in the taste with a mild smokey flavoring. Mouth is slightly chewy with a bitter aftertaste, moderate to high carbonation, lighter bodied than most stouts. This is a highly drinkable stout - especially with the ABV on it."
"Active carbonation sharp, med-light body. Easily drinkable in just about any weather, which is unusual."
"Very thin in the mouth for a dry stout, with little malt backbone evident. Without a maltiness to bring it together, the burnt coffee and smoky taste (perhaps a hint of tobacco) are left sort of hanging isolated and limp. Really is reminiscent of coffee that has been brewed too weakly."
"D) I really enjoyed this one. Alcohol is light comparitively, thus welcoming a second round. Okay, why not."
"Good but could even be better with a little more body to bring balance to the dry taste of roast malt."
"Picked up a bottle at Liquor World in Porter Sq. Poured into a tulip glass. Dark brown color. Heavyset white head. Carbonation really only noticeable at the very bottom of the glass. Decent amount of lacing. Smelled like a lot of roasted barely, with a sprinkle of milk chocolate. Taste was good, not great. Cocoa powder and coffee dominate. Didn't blow me away though. A bit thin in the body, but I have noticed that trend from other Belgian stouts. Very easy to drink, low abv. A bit on the boring side though, but good for one to enjoy."
"Final note: The website says this stout was inspired by the Irish style, but the Belgian in it is still more prevalent. A nice brew on its own."
"A decent offering, better than average."
"This is quite a nice beer, the aroma is definitely a bit more interesting / complex than the flavor though. I like that it is dry, and it could almost pass for a ordinary dry stout if not for that hint of fermentation character that makes this a little something extra-ordinary."
"Far more espresso-like than the smell would indicate. Relatively thin body with a high level of carbonation. The finish is like the end of a dark coffee."
"Pours a nice dark brown, almost black color with thin, coffee-colored foam head. Aroma consists of strong maltiness, chocolate, plum and raisin. Nice carbonation with a very smooth taste consisting of hints of dark chocolate, broasted malt and dark fruits."
"D: A really terrific stout; I recall being very impressed with the taste I had of this at Portland Int'l Beerfest this summer. A little over-bittered for my liking, but definitely one to recommend to fans of the 'Dry Stout' style. Would certainly have again."
"This is a pretty solid dry stout, which I definitely enjoyed. Different than a typical Irish stout, and I like it. Definitely worth a try."
"d- i'm not really a fan. i think there is a chemical charecter that comes through in this beer, i don't know what would cause this but it just felt flat and had an odd aftertaste."
"Bottle: Poured a light dark color ale with a huge off-white foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of light bitter roasted malt is somewhat interesting. Taste is also dominated by some light roasted malt and some light hops presence. Good carbonation but body is a bit thin. As previous raters mentioned, this beer seems to be geared toward drinkability and might lack some character."
"A very drinkable stout for sure and the modest alcohol can only help."
"It’s a stout, but no Irish stout."
"Drinkability is very high--I'm not particularly fond of stouts but I really enjoyed this one. Maybe it just got me on the right night. Recommended but I don't think I will be paying $4 a bottle for this one again when I could use that to buy an orval or something else more to my taste."
"D: Eh Somewhat"
"33 cl bottle. The beer poured a deep deep brown, nearly black body with a slight tan head that gave way to a little ring on the edge of the glass with some good lacing. There was a pleasing roasted malt aroma. The taste was a nice chocolately and roasted malt base with notes of coffee and a slight hop bitterness on the back. Medium body."
"Deep, deep ruby black color with a huge, creamy head. Strong aroma of roasted malt-almost a peat or charcol aroma. Strong roasted flavor-very strong dark chocolate taste. Quite a grainy flavor as well. Has a touch of earthiness. Nice body for the flavor and lower abv. Finish is rather dry. A different sort of beer and fairly enjoyable."
"Pours pitch black. No head on my glass, but they usually pour it very well at SD. Thick malty nose. Flavor is a mass of character. Smoky, anise, molasses, thick malts, burnt coffee beans. Throws a load to chew and dwell on in your mouth. Feel has a good carbonation to it and the liquid has a good body as well. Overall very drinkable. Thick and robust with a tolerable bitter tone and aftertaste, it's very well done. Especially considering this is a Belgian produced stout, which we never see that much (and even less, done well)."
"Mouthfeel is adequate...neither too thick or thin, and there is a gentle drying on the tongue after you swallow."
"Pours a five+ finger brown head that goes fairly quickly to a ring leaving a little lace. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Black color. Nose is slight coffee/earthy. Strong roasted coffee flavor with hints of bitterness. $3.95 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"D: Despite all of the ""porter styled"" burnt/bitterness going on here, I found this to be enjoyable and a quite a nice little surprise to bring home from West Lakeview Liquors!"
"The bottle says this is a ""Brussels Stout"". Wasn't sure what to expect. Turns out it's just a good sessionable stout."
"Stouterik is a well-brewed dark beer that is more conventional than expected. Unfortunately, the price of admission (I paid $4.09 for the 11.2 oz bottle) is too steep to warrant a repeat purchase. Given the cost, I suggest adding another two or three bucks and leaving with a sixer of some good American stout or porter."
"D: This is a solid stout offering from Belgium. Solid coffee flavor really drives it in general."
"D/notes: This is the first export stout I have reviewed. Based on this one it seems that they are substantially lighter than other stout styles. Easy drinking except for carbonation."
"This is a very fine stout. It pours a very dark, black, slightly frothy head with a decent amount of lacing. The smell is chocolate, burnt malts, and some coffee. This is a medium bodied beer with a bit of sweetness and burnt malts and chocolately flavor. There maybe some coffee here as well, but the coffee dissipates a bit as the beer warms. The beer is decently carbonated, but what makes this a nice warming drink is the medium bodied consistency throughout. There are plenty of hops which balances out the burnt notes quite nicely. You will enjoy a warming aftertaste as well. You can't go wrong here. L'Chaim"
"Overall - A pretty good stout although i think the flavours could all do with being beefed up a bit.. recommended..."
"The dryness takes a bit of getting use to, but once its flow has started to take place its easy to follow. A nice surprising find and will go back for more."
