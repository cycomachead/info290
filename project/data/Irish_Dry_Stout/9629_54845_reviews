"This irish stout pours a near black color with a short lived tan head that leaves decent lacing. The aroma is a robust blend of chocolate, coffee, and malt. It is reminiscent of guiness (not the bottle but fresh and on tap). The mouthfeel is rather light, more porter than stout. The flavor is a typical stout quality but has a metallic quality that is a turn off. This is good and if pushed a touch further could be great. Get the Publican Porter instead if you can."

"Overall - Good beer. Not a very heavy beer but this beer still has a nice flavor profile. Being a lighter beer you get more of a refreshing mouthfeel that is crisp, but not so heavy and full like a stronger stout."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 2/25/2013. Pours pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, dark bread, light char, light smoke, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, dark bread, light char, light smoke, and roasted earthiness. Light coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, dark bread, light roast, light smoke, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of dark roasted malt flavors; with big robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent dry stout! All around great balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/roasted malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O - This was a bit too burnt or smoky for my taste, but it was still enjoyable. Worth giving a try if you want a stout with a lower ABV."

"Overall: decent brew from short's. nothing I could get excited about but good to have around st pats day."

"O: Well I bought I impulse bought this to support a local brewery, and one of my favorite breweries personally, and my loyalty did not disappoint me one bit. Recommended by me."
"Overall not the most impressive beer but by no means bad. If you can get it on draft or a single bottle give it a go."
"Great representation of the style. I am not the world's biggest stout fans and when i do partake i prefer milkier stouts but the flavor here is spot on. Especially appreciable on a cold late winter day in Michigan. My only real complaint, which may be erroneous, is that the beer is a bit fizzy. I always associate stouts with a flatter feel. Anyway, a great choice for a classic stout"
"A super solid beer that, like others have said, is better than Guinness in every aspect, except maybe the appearance (it's hard to beat Guinness, in my opinion). Uncle Steve's is just a solid stout all around... try it if you haven't already."

"Great session beer ! Seen this at local Meijers store on sale and picked up a Six pack .This Beer has rich dark stout flavor with almost chocolate back end taste to it . I found it very easy to drink and you could easily enjoy this paired with fish and chips as i did ."

"Overall, a bit better than I remember it being. I could knock back six of these no problem. A tasty Irish style stout with a nice, bitter roast aroma and flavor."
"This is a nice hearty stout. Seems a bit too hearty for the style. Nice roasted tones with a thick body. Good complexities. I still think it's a bit too much for the style. Again, another Short's beer that is quite good, but doesn't quite fit to style."
"A magnificent dry stout and definitely a beer I'd recommend."

"O: this is a nice irish stout. uncle steve should be happy with this. beer is very true to the style. full of roast and biscuit with a slight hop."

"This comes out a black cola color with dark cocoa foam, very tight bubbles and a thick, strong coffee roast aroma on the nose. The coffee dominates but it is not exclusively so, balanced out by chocolate. The flavor is all about dark chocolate, dark roast coffee, and a sharp hop bitterness for definition. Itâ€™s full bodied, thick and robust. I dig it. Fantastic"
"I thought the easiest way to describe this beer is to compare it to a Guiness, which I would consider the standard for an irish stout (if it truly is I have no idea). I think this brew from shorts stacks up favorably. There are many similar characteristics. The malt, aroma, bitterness, is all very similar. I would say this beer has a bit more going for it. The head is frothy rather than creamy and the taste is a little more acidic rather than smooth. It has a nuttiness to it, almost like roasted pecans. The moutfeel is medium and drinkable. I let this beer warm over the course of an hour or so and it's flavor profile held true throughout. I will say that it became softer with warmth, more drinkable, but that's not to say it was boozy from the start. Overall I think this is a really great every day stout. I'm glad they come in six packs!"

"Overall~ A great stout from another recent favorite of Michigan beers"
"O - While not the best stout I've had, still pretty good for the money."
""

"O - Flavor profile is nice, but the high carbonation reduces the overall enjoyment. Still pretty good though."

"O: Not really a fan. It seemed a bit thin and I just didn't really like the flavor combination. Made well, just not for me."
"O- Short's didn't screw up with this brew, but they made what I would consider one of their most average offerings. I enjoyed it without dobut, but I expected a bit more."
"O- This is a wonderful example of the style. Flavorful, yet drinkable. It's screaming to get matched with Irish fare. I could sit down and put back a bunch of these. A very sociable drink. I had some initial worries that this might be a bit out of season (and bottling this style seems to ruin it for me). Any worries were laid to rest. Definitely exceded expectations."
"O - A very delightful drink! Relaxing brew! I would Love to see this brew come in a CAN! Good brew in a good trade! Thanks Another6pack, can't wait until round two...."
"Overall, this is my first from Short's due to where I live and I'm very impressed. This is a flavorful and drinkable treat."
"O: Quite good. I didn't have any expectations when I went in, but I was impressed by what a flavorful beer this turned out to be."
"O- This beer was a fantastic surprise. I was expecting something with a little offness to it (in a good Short's kind of way) and found a well balanced beer. The ABV is a nice lower number so enjoying a sixer of this is very much in the cards. Another great beer from Short's."
"the CPJ"
"Pours black, very little fading in color. Topped with a thin, tan head- dissipates quickly and leaves very little lacing. This beer smells of chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts. The taste follows quite nicely- more bitter chocolate, nice amount of roast, and a dab of coffee. Medium body, medium-low carbonation and a nice creamy mouth-feel. Slightly dry finish. This is a tasty stout and session-ably smooth."
"Update- I have been drinking a lot of the 2012 release, it's one awesome beer and without a doubt my favorite Irish Dry Stout, I am going to have to stockpile some before they are all gone."
"overall - good, not great. smoke a bit too forward for my taste."
"O: I have a soft spot for this style, and this was a very nice example of the style. Nothing earth-shattering here, but still a nice sessionable drinker."
"Pretty decent brew. Not anything that stands out as amazing, but was worth having."
"D - Very drinkable. Would be a great session stout; not too strong and for someone who loves stouts, would go down smoothly."
"I see that it has overall listed instead of drinkability. This is not a bad beer, but when it comes to an American brewery making an Irish Dry Stout I would recommend Avery Out of Bounds Stout over this."
"O-OK overall. Slightly heavier than I was expecting."
"d - i'd take a guinness, but nice to try a different offering from the style."
"This version of the style really works for me. Nice body, flavor, and overall a pleasant surprise."
"D: I think I got an infected bottle, but this one just tasted bad. I feel like every other bottle I get from Short's is infected. I would never drink this again."
"Drinkability - Because it is lighter bodied, it is damn easy to quaff. I was not expecting much going into this beer but I rather enjoyed it though it isn't my favorite stout it is definitely worth a drink."
"D - This has good drinkability. It goes down easy, and the taste is good. I am always excited to try a beer from shorts that I've never had. overall, I'm glad I got to try this one, and I would try it again."
"Drinkability is ok. Not a terrible beer, but not very good either. Too thin and weak. I think my review is actually being kind, because I don't really like this one..."
"Pours a very dark brown color, definitely bordering in on black. Light and thin tan head that recedes pretty quickly with only a bit of lace to show for it. The nose brings a lot of roasted malt along with a bit of roasted coffee. The taste is really highly roasted malt, coffee, and a small dose of coffee. Nice, dry mouthfeel with good carbonation."
"Given that I have come to expect beers from Short's to be so, I was unsurprised by the infection in this bottle; it actually sort of works here as well. Not bad and if you want to taste a dark sour beer that sort of works then give this one a go. If you want a nice Irish Stout then I can only recommend that you avoid this beer at all costs. At least it is interesting."
"This beer tastes extremely good for the style, more like an imperial dry stout. Lots of roasted malts and cocoa, a little bit sweet in the front and a long aftertaste of roast and cafe. Thicker than normal body (but not as thick as, say, your average RIS). I liked this overall, more than many of the Short's beers I've tried lately."
"overall a solid stout but needed a little more punch to make it last in my mind."
"Bottle. Pours a dark brown with a huge 3 finger fluffy tan head that is very slow to settle. Aroma that I get out of this is a little bit of coffee but also leather and roast matls. Medium/light mouthfeel. The taste is Slightly sweet up front with a big leather and slightly bitter ending. Ends rather crisply and dry but the flavors linger on a bit. Good lace left on the glass. Has a slight touch of alcohol taste. Hmm, not a huge fan but not terrible either. Pretty carbonated."
"Definitely a different take on an Irish Stout here, with the tart fruity tang of this really standing out. It wasn't necessarily unpleasant but just different, as the other aspects of this were mostly well done. I'm curious as to just how different this one ended up being in the bottle."
"Overall- drink this beer semi cold. i through my first one in the freezer for 10 minutes when it was already somewhat cold and it had a funky fruity/ sour taste. when it warms up this beer has potential it just walks a thin line. really dry. will never buy this again. i'll give irish dry stouts another try but if they're all like this then i'm good."
"D - Not sure I'm feeling the style very much. Maybe the beer had to still chill for a bit. Glad I got to try it, but I don't need to seek this one out."
"Jet black color though somewhat ""muddy"" looking. nice head and leaves a layer of lace at each sip. Mellow, somewhat roasted and mildly cocoa aroma. Decent flavor-again mild roasted and cocoa flavors. Pleasantly dry with a definate grainy taste to it. Licorice/sourness flavors come thru near the end, and tend to be too much overall. Solid mouthfeel. Decent stout, though the somewhat off taste of whatever flavor I am getting would make too many of these hard to swallow."
"Pours black with big initial beige foam, that tapers off to leaving some thick lace in the glass. Coffee astringency up front. Sourness on the back end, with sugar more at the end of the bottle. Dry aftertaste. Flavours going on, and that keeps me drinking for interest. Some anise. Big burping carbonation, yet this is 8 months aged. You sold it,I rate it and the sourness may be attributable to an oops infection batch, and it is more evident in the aromas at the end of the glass, along with roast."
"Overall, a decent dry stout. However, I think that this one went a bit sour. Pretty drinkable. Just sour in the aftertaste."
"Drinkability is very good; I could toss back a few with ease. Uncle Steve knows what's happening. Worth a shot."
"Overall, an decent Irish dry stout. Wasn't in love with this beer but worth a try if you are partial to the style."
"12 oz bottle into my Rochefort glass...Pours a very dark brown, not black but you could be fooled that it is. Light tan head, gone right away...Super light aroma, a little light coffee but that's it...The taste is super light and sweet on the front. On the finish some very light coffee, just not a ton of flavor here. A light coffee sessional."
"Comes out of the bottle a typical opaque dark with beige head. The real joy of this beer is in the aroma. Rich musky roasted malt, house blend coffee, a touch of cocoa powder. Flavor is pleasant and mild of java and dry chocolate cake. Mouthfeel is light and thin and a little metallic in the finish. This makes the beer quite drinkable."
"Pretty drinkable...nothing outstanding, but one I would drink again. Worth a try for sure."
"A dark black pour with a foamy light tan head leaving some jagged lacing , medium carbonation . Aroma of coffee , coco powder , roasted malt and earhty hops . Flavor is much the same as the aroma , light coffee , lots of roasted malt , coco powder and earthy hops , light body, oily feel, with a short dry roasty finish . Drinkable and sessionable but not my favorite style ."
"Short's makes some good beers but they are too hit and miss in the quality control department for me. If they can start putting out beers that aren't infected, they will move up in my book. I have another bottle of this that I received from TasteTester and hope that it isn't infected like this one was."
"D- I could drink this one again. Irish stouts aren't my favorite, but this one is good."
"From notes: Deep dark brown pour with eggshell head and some nice lacing. Aromas of roasted dark malts and a bit of smoke. Smooth. First sip is smooth with a mellow dark roast and some with a nuttiness. A bit dry with a touch of smoke. Easy to drink and well balanced. Medium bodied smooth and a bit dry. Overall, an interesting take on an irish stout, but I wouldn't expect less from Short's"
"Second bottle consumed on 9/21/10- has been in the fridge and has a very pronounced sourness from start to finish! Definitely takes away from the Irish stout-ness, but makes this stout a little more refreshing on a summer's day!"
"D - Ya I am definitely glad I didn't buy a 6 pack of it, I usually really Short's beer but this is a big miss for me."
"D: Not a bad beer by a long shot but not my favorite. Definitely session-able and I'll have no trouble drinking the other five in my fridge."
"D: The smooth and lightness of the stout lends to a very good drinkability. The avg ABV would make this a good session beer especially for the ""pre-St Patty's weekend"""
"Good easy drinking Irish stout. Highly carbonated and very roasty. Bascially tasted just like it smells with a bit more in the way of dark fruit. Body is light and watery like all Irish stouts. Such a boring style but okay once a year."
"Has a low ABV and is pretty drinkable and seems very smooth. A decent Irish stout but not quite up to some other Shorts Brewery stouts."
"All in all, this brew smelled a lot better than it tasted. It had a lot of potential, brewer just needs to work on the flavors a little more. Good brew to try once, but not worth hunting down if you can't get it locally."
"4/4/4.5/4.5/4"
"This is just about as easy to drink, but tastier than, Guinness. Very well done."
"I was a bit nervous to get a seriously infected bottle, but luckily enough it wasn't too bad. A good offering from Short's, and I trust they will fix the QC issues in the future."
"EDIT: Just drank another bottle of this one and it was very good. No sign of the sourness in the earlier bottle and a nice highly roasted stout."
"D: Low ABV and pretty damn drinkable. A sold Irish Dry Stout."
"While I had a poor experience with this beer, I am thoroughly impressed with Shorts Brewing's response to these QC issues. I am not telling anyone that this beer is horrible as much as this batch had it's share of problems. I look forward to another batch and an updated review. Thanks to Shorts for reaching out and offering to make this right - classy act for sure!"
"drinkability is good. nice balance. smooth and tasty. a nice irish stout."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, easy drinking stout. Carbonation is a bit high for the style, but real nice roasty flavours going on. Thanks Russ!"
"D - While it's not terrible, it's gonna be a drain pour. I'm just not a fan of this infection crap from them despite their best efforts at a good beer (which otherwise, it would be)."
"Taste was over the top roasty/malty with a long finish. This is way too much stout for a style exemplified by Guiness & Murphy's. Reminded me of a misplaced homebrew."
"D - Very good stout, very drink able. It's really nice to see a brewery get that amount of flavor in a beer without going crazy on the alcohol."
"Very roasty, almost burnt medium body with a lot of dark bitter malt character. Slightly lactic and creamy with a lot of bittersweet dark chocolate, oatmeal, toffee, roasted coffee bean and burnt wood. There's also a very prominent hop bitterness especially toward the end of the palate which lingers into a very acrid dry finish. Sweet alcohol is present mid palate, lasting through the finish, but there is a bit of silky viscous burnt chocolate maltiness in the end of the swallow. This beer isn't as smooth or creamy as it claims to be and overall this beer has a really harsh acrid/burnt character that makes it difficult to drink. I wasn't very impressed with this one."
"This is one of my least favorite styles but this one at least has some flavor though like most the mouthfeel is off for beer and it appears to be infected."
"Drinkability is high. This is a pretty good beer overall."
"D: This beer would be great to drink several of while watching Rugby, darts, soccer, or some other western European sport."
"(D)- A good stout that definitely satisfies when Guinness is just not enough. Nice job Short's!"
"Overall, I'm liking dry stouts more and more, and this one fits right in."
"Mouthfeel: Too thin."
"A nice little dry stout from Short's."
"Irish stouts are rarely as robust as their bigger brethren, but Uncle Steve's provides plenty of interest for its unaggressive profile. A tasty winter session option."
"D_Low ABV and the thin creamybody make this a great session beer."
"Dark coffee brown body. Tall, stately, creamy, light khaki brown head. Good lacing and retention. Roasted malts, peat, light smoke, dark chocolate, and a bit of earthy molasses on the nose. Mild roasted coffee bitterness up front. Dark chocolate nibs and mineral water fill in. Barely sweet caramel and molasses mid-palate. Earthy, peaty finish, with hints of licorice. Drying bitterness in the end. Medium-bodied, with a tad too much carbonation. Nice and drinkable!"
"D - A solid interpretation, and better than the imported Guinness ES."
"Cheers."
"D: A great example of a Dry Irish Stout. Well Done, but not extraordinary."
"Dark rich malts and bakers chocolate flavors are the first to introduce themselves in the flavors. In the middle it takes on something akin to dark fruits and green apple. The finish is quite interesting with a cool balance between the malt and hops but still finishes with a dryness that is expected from any proper Irish stout."
"For a seasonal, it may be somewhat appropriate, but for such a rare thing to find in bottle form, it seems somewhat lackluster. A good beer, to be sure, just not at all worth its price tag."
"Overall a classic interpretation on an Irish Dry Stout. Dead-on chalky dryness with enough malt traction to keep one's stout satisfaction level at a high mark. Great Stout from Short's indeed. Simple and classic."
"d - quite drinkable and spot on for the style, alcohol is non-existent in the taste, taste is not very complex or interesting, however"
"Had this after a Cup A Joe, so it was a bit tough to compete though."
"This isn't one of my favorite styles, but it is an excellent beer."
"D: Irish Dry Stouts aren't always my favorites, but this is a nice example of the style, and totally worth trying if you can get it."
"Picked up a bottle of this at Holiday Market in Royal Oak. I'm not usually a dry stout fan, but figured I'd give this a shot; and it didn't disappoint. Pours a dry-stout-dark-brown with a fair bit of tan head. Smells of burnt, charred malts. Taste is, as expected, quite dry. Again, those burnt malts, a tad of caramel and dark roasted coffee. Mouthfeel is that astringent dry quality you'd expect from a dry stout. I could drink a few of these in a session. Great for a cold winter night."
"D- A good drinking beer that doesn't seem to pack too big of a punch. Clean and nice for a change of pace."
"The drinkability is good with all style points considered. Not every enthusiast can sit down and serially consume a stout of any style, but this is a very drinkable beer. Another thumb's up for Short's"
