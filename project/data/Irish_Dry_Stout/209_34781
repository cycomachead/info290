Pours with a thick appearance that looks like a chocolate milkshake. It turns from a creamy brown color to a very transparent black. When held up to light you can see through this and it is a dark red color. Big creamy head on this one. It looks like what a cappuccino would look like. Now I had to write a lot about the appearance, because that's the best part of this beer...it kinda goes downhill from here. Scent is quite pleasant with some chocolate and malt notes. Also has a kinda skunky scent as well though. Taste is WAY TOO WATERY! The flavors of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and some vanilla are there, but just way too watered down. The mouthfeel is just like I said, way too watered down and flat. I know this is because of the nitro, but I've had bears that weren't this flat from nitro taps. Drinkability is somewhat high if you enjoy drinking chocolate flavored water.","DovaliHops","Jan 27, 2011"

Pours the same appearance as a draught - nice head and laces that lingers throughout the drinking session. Aroma of coffee and stout chocolate. Great carbonation and medium body throughout. Tastes wonderful being extra cold. Really liked the igloo on top of the tab handles. Too bad they're not served in the States. The beer is brewed at the James Gate Brewery in Dublin, Ireland and would be a great pint if it was served at normal ale temperature of around 8-12 degrees. Needless to say, even if the beer was too cold, it was still quite quaffable!","CuriousMonk","Jan 14, 2011"

They do not belong in the same sentence. However when you try to get inside the brewers head you can't help but come up with love. As a beer this is pretty unimpresssive. The label states that this is to be consumed from the bottle. Not much to look at or smell. You can sniff out some roasted malt and earthy hops if you try but the flavor is a notch above BMC as there is a roasted grain presence. A bit of real hops as well. The upshot is this is a beer brewed for those times when a real beer lover is trapped. You know what I'm talkin' about. The bars that only have iced bottles no taps. Viewed in that light this beer is a life line for those of us who are looking at a night of ice cold piss or something closer to beer. The thin feel is a bit of a letdown but it does enhance drinkability, enabling you to quaff at a dangerous clip. So remember this is a beer for club night and it aint' so bad. Just order one and slam it down with your buddies and before you know it you're one of the guys not a beer snob.","scootny","Jan 06, 2010"

The smell is of toasty malts and barley. No hop presence. Smells sweet of oak and vanilla as well. Taste is dry, and dull with some chocolate and oaky notes. A dry stout is a dry stout, what can I say. I also used to think that drinking these was like drinking a milkshake, but now it is rather thin on my palate.

3.58,0.8,4.5,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Poured out a decent head that never receded, and left spotty traces of beige lace. Guinness always has great head retention, but head size seems to lack when served from anywhere but the tap. The color is a solid opaque black. Has a unique aroma that is distinct to Guinness. Lightly sweet, smokey, malty, bready, and slight hop notes detected in the smell. The taste has a very dry smokey flavor, like you just got done licking an ashtray. It is slightly sweet, but has along dry finish, and a touch of a lingering faint bitterness. Mouthfeel lacks in carbonation which is usual with Guinness. Mouthfeel is very watery and lacks any body for such a dark beer. The texture is as usual very creamy and always goes down smooth. It is very drinkable, but I find myself only drinking it a few random times throughout the year. I love it at St. Patty's Day as does everyone else. When I was in Ireland I drank it the whole week. It did have a different taste over there, which if I remember was a bit hoppier and maybe more carbonated. It's in a class by itself and it is what it is. There's no changing it now.","kelticblood","Dec 27, 2007"

3.68,3.7,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"It looks like a Guinness Draught but is a little lighter. It has a roasted barley nose to it, just like Guinness Draught. The taste is where they seperate in comparison. It had a metallically almost flat taste, simmilar to that of an ice cube. Maybe too cold to have any flavor?","libbekat","Jul 07, 2007"

3.58,0.8,4.5,4,3,3.5,4,"Pouring a Guinness and watching as the head forms, changing colour from chocolate to a brwnish foam is a show. But I'm used to tap or Special Export and found this one bland. Smell of coffee and roasted, light in the palate and very watery. Taste of coffee with notes of chocolate and pepper. I miss the alcohol of the Special Export.","janubio","Mar 19, 2007"
3.05,-14.1,3.5,3.5,3,3,2.5,"The beer that basically changed my thought process on beer. Poured black into a 20oz Guinness pint with a dense white head. In the nose, hints of coffee and hops. Light in the palate, but filling and bitter. A great first step into beer, by realizing different tastes and colors.","OWSLEY069","Mar 13, 2007"
