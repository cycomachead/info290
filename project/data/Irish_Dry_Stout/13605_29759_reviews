"A really tasty stout, roasty and robust when it needs to be, but refreshing too. Really nice."

"OVERALL: This is okay, but a bit of a confusing creation. It’s categorized as an Irish Dry Stout, but there is a definite spicy character to it that just doesn’t fit. If they have indeed used Irish yeast, then I can only imagine the spicy flavors come from the hop additions. Regardless, this factor makes the brew more Belgian in style, which is interesting, but not necessarily to style. A decent effort and an enjoyable beer, but a bit of an oddity. Thanks again guys!"

"O-A rather assertive Dry Stout. I enjoyed it but fear I will remember the artwork far longer than the actual beer."

"Of all of the Québec microbrasserie stouts, this is my favorite. It has a dry punchy taste to start off with and offers cacao and coffee flavours with a hopsy spice to it. The feel is creamy and it isn't too sweet but not too bitter either. The aftertaste seems to be indecisive in the sense that it borders on bitter while leaving a little sweetness. In a nutshell, this is one of the more complex Québec micro brewery stouts and the boys in Shawinigan are on to something with this little pearl. It goes down great on its own but also accompanies strong cheeses very well."

"600 ml bottle featuring cool artwork depicting a kraken battling a bunch of dudes with axes and such. Name refers to blood. Brew is a rich jet black with a burnt orange halo along the bottom of the glass. Ample brown head and smells great: Prominent roasted malt, spice seed like anise, along with a soft fruity top note and a whiff of leafy hops. Taste is light roast coffee, chocolate, and dark dried fruit like raisins and dates ... A touch of smoke. Some herbal hop notes which combine with other flavors to create a licorice root effect. I also detect a bright acidity reminiscent of red wine and although the finish is quite dry as per the style, with some toast and bitter husk, there is a lingering sweetness as well and this is a very well-crafted dry Irish stout that incorporates more noticeable sweet fruit and herb flavors than is generally the case. Medium body which belies the opaque demonic appearance (you'd think it would be thicker), with dryish mouth feel ... Its a little buttery and sweet yet highly carbonated. Neat take on the style. Stronger and more complex than usual ... An American stout/dry Irish hybrid?"
"Overall this strangely works, the strong coffee bitterness you’d expect is reserved for the finish, while the rest of the flavor plays with citrus grapefruit and herbal hops settling into a chocolatey roasty (tho not over the top) tasty drink. Short of amazing but I would have it again without hesitation as a flavourful session stout on a cool night. 4"

"O: not a bad beer, a nice dry stout. I quite like the roasty malt flavor and though there is a slight bitter finish, I think this is a nice easy drinking beer."

"(3.75) D: This a good tasting stout with an outstanding appearance. Glad to see this available in Ontario."
"Although a French producer, this beer is one from straight out a British pub. I've always considered Dry Stouts to be the 'old reliable' of beer styles and Le Trou Du Diable Sang-d'encre is as solid as any of them. It is substantial and satiating without being too heavy or rich - one bottle was mighty satisfying though I like the idea of having two or three more."

"Hope it ages well, as I believe I'm about to buy many!"

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."

"Overall - Pretty solid stuff, as are most of the beers from this brewer. Price point might keep me away when 6 packs of St Ambroise Stouts are $7.99 at the same store.. but it was worth a try."
"I poured the bottle into a pint glass. Wow, lots of foam. It died down, leaving some tan lace on the glass and a hint of foam on the top. Good dark color. I couldn't smell anything. The taste was good. Roast malt. Chocolate. Coffee. Maybe a little strong for an Irish stout, more like an Imperial Stout, but good."

"O: a pretty good beer. It was nice to sip on a stout a mist my summer craze of ipas and low abv Belgians."
"worth a try but a I doubt I'll be a repeat customer with other LTDD brews beside it on the shelf that I preferred for the same price."

"Not really a traditional interpretation of an Irish Dry Stout, but this is good all the same - roasted, sure, but with those spice and coffee adjuncts, which make for a more complex and interesting affair all around. I'm hardly worried about any inherent sickness I might have for these increasingly interesting Quebecois offerings."

"Not bad. It didn't produce ""oos"" or ""ahhs"" but for the style it seemed about par. I think it would be good out of a nitro tap since the head was the main issue for me. Would have again."
"Overall. Nothing fancy here but a well made beer. Seems a little thin but that my only real complaint."

"Deep brown colour, over a finger of thick off white head, some lace as well. Smell is roasted and chocolatey, some coffee, clean in the nose. Taste roasted and dry, coffee and a little astringent as well, bit of hop and a nice mixture of coffee and hop bitterness, a bit of chocolate as well. Lightly carbonated and creamy, bit of a light feel but quite smooth. Nothing groundbreaking but a simple and effective dry stout."
"Overall, a straight forward but nice stout."

"Draft: Poured a black color ale with a nice off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of dry roasted malt with nice aromatic coffee notes. Taste is also dominated by dry malt roasted notes with some aromatic coffee which is surprising considering there is no coffee in here and those roasted malt do make a wonder. Body is about average for style with OK carbonation. Very well brewed for style."
"Had this on tap last night at Volo. Pours a pitch black colour with thin off-white head. Some lacing around the glass. Ok head retention. Smells of coffee and roasted malt. Very sweet flavour, only a hint of bitterness in the aftertaste. Very smooth mouthfeel. This seems to be a better version of and Irish Dry Stout than Guinness, but nothing too exciting. Was a bit expensive for the half pint, so likely wouldn't order again at the price point."
"Pours a nice dark brown/black, red edges, thick tan head, nice lacing, good retention. Smell is very alcoholic, fruity, some dark roast, grassy, kind of weird, not very stout like. Taste is better, caramel malt, light roast, chocolate, but pretty weak and watery. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation. Not horrific but not very pleasant, pretty weak attempt at a stout."
"Another dry stout, black with big head. Roast malt, chocolate malt. Lighter mouthfeel, light alcohol, with C hop in there. A tad of coffee, it all is OK but mediocre rep of the style.Nitro may have added creaminess but which may have impaired flavour."
"Taste: Mocha flavors with little cocoa sprinkles, body is quite light and the bitter finish is coffee-like and mild. A sessionable if not spectacular stout that Guinness lovers will dig, I tend to like mine with a little more substance."
