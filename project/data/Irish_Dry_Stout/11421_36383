3.76,10.9,4,3.5,3.75,3.75,4,"Poured from tap into a plastic cup, nice dark coffee colored pour with a inch or so of cream colored head. Aroma was of mild roasted malt with some coffee hints, taste was roasted malt with chocolate and coffee swirling around nicely together. Mouthfeel was smooth and slightly frothy in the beginning with a solid medium finish leaving a nice layer of flavor on the tongue. Overall a nice simple Stout that was good from the tap, I really enjoyed this local Las Vegas brew...just a tasty starter Stout.","Bear1964","Jun 22, 2013"

3.73,10,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Half finger head with excellent lacing on a jet black body. Aroma of milk chcoolate and cocoa mostly with some roasted malts. Flavor is also mosty chocolate and roasted malts with a dry finish and roasted bitterness which is mild but lingers on the palate for a while after. Medium body and light carbonation. Nice version of an Irish stout. Full flavored and not too watery for the style which is my least favorite aspect of this genre.","kylehay2004","Jul 17, 2012"

3.77,11.2,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall, it was a pretty good tasting cup of beer. Much better than what you normally find in plastic. I have a hard time complaining about a stout on tap, and this one while not the best choice, isn't a bad one either.","dali27","Aug 26, 2010"
4.2,23.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured on-tap at bar in the Venetian. The beer is black with a thin, bright, creamy colored head. They refer to it as "The Dark Side of Sin." There is a nose of coffee and earth. The flavors are very smooth, a good creamy blend of coffee, caramel, and nut. There is a very slick, short aftertaste of coffee. The lightness and crispness of the beer is unusual for a stout, but very enjoyable. This was tasty enough to warrant a growler fill on our way home.","GarthDanielson","Aug 08, 2010"

3.68,8.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"D - Pretty drinkable session stout. A pint went down easy, although it would have been a bit better had the astringency been a bit more attenuated. Not much to differentiate it from other beers of this style - had it mostly to tick off Nevada, a notoriously mediocre beer-producing state.","MasterSki","Jun 26, 2009"
3.49,2.9,4.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"D - Another solid offereing from Sin City... As seems to be the case, they make accessible and enjoyable beers, but ones that are slightly above average and far from the head of the class for their respective styles...","philbe311","Mar 04, 2009"
3.32,-2.1,4,2,3.5,4,4,"Into a plastic cup (doh!)(Vegas, stock), pours a cascading dark brown with a nice off white head that stayed around for a surprisingly long time. The aroma was light, maybe some chocolates in there. Taste had some nice caramels and roasted malts, stock. The mouth was nice and creamy smooth, good carbonation, easy to drink. Nothing great, nothing bad, a definitely good pickup when walking around one of Vegas's 400 malls on the strip.","objectivemonkey","Feb 21, 2009"
3.63,7.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Not bad! Good enough for another glass. Nothing amazing, but not bad at all. An interesting, albeit slightly weak irish stout with some nice character to it. Definitely worth a try, especially in the realm of availability on the strip.","djeucalyptus","Dec 28, 2008"

3.12,-8,3,3.5,3,3,3,"Not an offensive beer, just a bit lackluster for my taste as a stout. I may have a better take if it were a Dunkel.","BEERchitect","Mar 15, 2008"

2.53,-25.4,3.5,3,2,3,2.5,"Dark black with a fluffy tan head. Roasty malt, and chocolate smell. Creamy, yet thin body. Thin flavor of chocolatey roasty malt. Not really much bitterness or any hop presence. Alcohol is very prevalent in this one and it is quite watery. Not very good, but I've had much worse.","JDV","Beers"
2.98,-12.1,3,2.5,3,3,3.5,"The beer poured a not-quite-opaque red-black, with a fair amount of light tan head. There was no aroma. It was served rather cold, but exhibited only a faint amount of light roastiness. I found this beer to be disappointingly approachable. Mouthfeel is smooth but a bit flat and watery. Not a very exciting beer.","BeerBelcher","0"
