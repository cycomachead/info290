"Not a bad effort from Porterhouse but not quite up to the standard set by their Oyster Stout that I tried previously, mainly due to the fact that the bitterness was a little overpowering but it was enjoyable at least."

"This was an extreme stout, wouldn't really call it tasty, but definitely rich and rugged. A nice exercise, but wouldn't drink two of these in a row."

"330 ml bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours nearly pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, coffee, molasses, light herbal, and roast/bready earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roasted/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light molasses, light herbal, and roasted earthiness. Good amount of sharp roasted/earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, light molasses, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance, robustness, and complexity of roasted/bready malt and moderate earthy hop flavors; with a crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming presence after the finish. Overall this is an excellent dry stout style. All around great balance and complexity of roast/bready malt and moderate earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
"Overall: Probably one of the tastiest Irish stouts around. Pretty solid and spot on. These bottles are just a bit hard to find here in Boston."
"O: actually not too shabby, but potentially an old bottle and/or somewhat poorly handled/cared-for"

"A heavenly, robust stout. Thick and chewy without an overbearing sweetness with a smooth, soothing hop bitterness undertone throughout. I really like the overall character of this beer but also like the unique pull-tab bottle cap! Ah, but it's the beer's flavor and feel the makes this one a keeper. I hope to see this one around on a regular basis."

"Overall I am not sure how I got a mildly infected bottle but I enjoyed it the same. It could be the bottle was old marked down from 5 bucks to $3.50 or the kick as ring bottle opener (why can't more beers have this?) Regardless I still enjoyed it immensely"

"I'm very excited to try this newcomer to my local store, straight from Ireland. Wrassler's pours a solid black, letting only a faint amount of light through. It's tan bubbly head rises to about 1/2"" initially, but quickly fades to a thin sliver. There's not much lacing going on here, either. The aroma is pretty promising, and telling of the overall worth of the beverage. I'm picking up a lot of bittersweet molasses and unsweetened chocolate. Maybe a little vanilla. It seems pretty straight forward. And the taste is as well. There's the aforementioned aspects, along with an almost overbearing sharp bitterness that cuts through. Fortunately, I like bitter flavors very much, but this could put some people off. I also don't think it's the best thing for the style. It still is pretty smooth, light, and drinkable though. Not bad at all, but give me a Brooklyn or Sly Fox dry stout instead."

"Drinkability : a very good beer in the Irish style Dry Stout."
""
"O: Great example of the style and a beer I could easily drink through an entire session - smooth and easy to drink with low ABV."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is creamy and full. Relatively low carbonation."
""
""
"D - a great beer to nurse and savor, especially in cooler weather; it would be hard to tip back multiple of these ""full stouts," but you wouldn't want to, as you just want to sip and enjoy slowly"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad, very dry."
"O- Taste was average, especially considering the delightful smell. But this was a fun beer to drink."

"Poured into my tasting snifter. Beautiful thick, black color with a quickly dissipating tan foamy head. I really love the smell on this one. Dark, smoky and sweet, malty aroma. It just SCREAMS stout. Taste is on point. Slightly sweet on the front, silky and dry across the middle, with a really smoky bitterness on the back. Lacing down the glass is nice as I get further in. I LOVE the smokiness in the flavor. Mouthfeel is refreshing with the right amount of carbonation to be refreshing but still suitable for the style. Finish is bitter and satisfying with the smokiness hanging around just long enough. Once again, I can't overstate how much I enjoy the AROMA of this beer. I will buy this again for sure."
"I know we're supposed to grade the beer to the style it's placed in, but I've seen beer styles switched on beers a few times after I've reviewed them, so I don't really care. People don't care whether a beer fits to style. They care about how good it is when they drink it."

"Kind of a let down. Showed promise at first but that soapy hop aftertaste just won't leave and ruined the entire experience. You would think that would be a simple fix in the brewing process."
""
"O - Decent full stout, one of the better ones brewed in my country today (and it was brewed from a past recipe of a now defunct brewery)."

"This beer lacks excitement and the acrid bite hinders its ability to fill a session."
""
"Good stuff going on here. It's been a while since I had a new Irish stout, & this one's very flavorful. Not a big beer, but it feels like they packed this one with flavor, like a dense little package."
"Pours an opaque black with a 1/2 inch khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt and some nice cocoa and coffee aromas. Taste is of super dark roasted malt, coffee beans, and cocoa powder. There is a somewhat assertive roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a huge roasty flavor."
"O: A descent dark stout, especially if you're a fan of dark chocolate. The long lasting burning bitter aftertaste is a turn off for me, but some people get a kick out of that."
"Overall: a decent drinking stout and also fits the bill for a good session beer."

"It’s not bad, but I’d bet this was on the shelf a bit too long. The paper, honey and butterscotch are a little distracting."

"Worth a try."
"O - This is an enjoyable stout with a nice roasty bitterness."
"Pours jet black with a light tan head. In the aroma, a small roast, and a small sweet oatmeal. In the taste, pine hops and a coffee roast. A nice hop bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry pine hop in the aftertaste. Quite hoppy for a Irish stout. Interesting bottle cap too."
"Poured out looking rich, thick and black in color. The head was a light brown color with a creamy look to it. The smell of this brew is simple, there is a decent amount of roasted aromas on the nose and some minimal sweetness. The taste of the beer has a pretty good roasted flavor to it, kind of creamy but also dry. The mouthfeel of this one wasn't too heavy, I found it to be drinkable. Overall, I enjoyed this one more than the Oyster Stout they make. All around this one is pretty tasty."
"Overall: Pretty good dry stout cant say I have had many beeter than this one at the moment. Worth a try for sure"
"Bottle claims 5.8% abv. Pours a dark brownish black with a decent off white bubbly foam. Roasted malt in the aroma, with a hint of coffee. In the flavor, more roasted malts, char, coffee and a mild but defined bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied, alittle watery. Overall, a decent irish stout with alittle more flavor than the popular brands."
"Overall it's a decent beer. I picked it up because I liked the bottle cap. I don't know that I would go out of my way to get it again, but I'd drink it if someone gave me one."
"O- The big robust very dark malt flavors are earthy and charred but very fresh and just a bit inky in the finish. This is a nice yet unique stout."
"Overall: Just like the Oyster Stout pretty much sums it up. Do you really need to make two Dry Irish Stout, especially if they are so close of a beer to each other? This beer got a better overall score, only because it just edges out Oyster Stout as a little bit better beer."
"This is the last beer from Porterhouse in the book. Good thing, because these beers are weak. I mean, oysters… in beer? Come on guys. Maybe it’s time to hang your hat and call it a day!"
"Pours a three finger light brown head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Light carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Black color, no highlights. Nose is baked chocolate and flavor is roasted-burnt chocolate with a dry bitter finish. $4.85 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA. Label has the ABV at 5.7%."
"D: Good beer."
"Man...this started off looking great, but that was pretty much the pinnacle of this beer. Cool cap...but that's about it..."
"What did they do to this to get it into the bottle? I understand now why it gets poor reviews here - a shadow of the tap version. Lines up better as a Foreign Export (and it is marked 5.7%) but even then not great. There are far better Irish stouts, both American and Irish."
"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, this is definitely not one of the better beers I’ve had in the style."
"Plenty of character for a relatively low and light-bodied brew. A very robust stout."
"A strong pour gets you over two fingers of whipped up and semi-delicate larger bubbles, very dark tan to lighter brown in hue, leaves an intricate web of thin lacing behind around the entire glass sides. Pure black liquid throughout, up against the glass you can see tiny bubbles rising swiftly. The nose not quite roasty but heavy on the malts with coffee, dark chocolate and mocha components, supplemented by caramel, leesy yeast, sour milk and a bit of peat and earth, some undistinguished black fruits, not much lift but what is there lasts pretty well. Medium-bodied with a hard steel posture, stays rigid for no apparent reason. Dry with a creamy mouthfeel from the carbonation until the “bitter end.” Burnt cocoa, powdered dark chocolate lead with a slight sweetening effect from the honey, toffee and prune, plum to cherry fruit. Momentary glance of sour grapefruit to orange citrus. Hay, straw, grass make an appearance. Relentlessly dry and bitter, keeps kicking long after you’re down and stopped fighting back. Even if exaggerated, stays true to the category but hard to imagine putting yourself through more than one in a sitting. The Ireland Irish must be gluttons for punishment if they can drink this in meaningful quantities."
"O) An enjoyable stout, but not one I think I'll revisit as there isn't really anything that jumps out at me as ""special"" with this one."
"The bottle cap is a strange one almost like the old Spam cans where you roll the metal strip off. From a 330 ml. bottle and sampled on APril 11, 2011. Jet black pour with a delicate tan head that floats around up top for most of the session. The aroma is alive with roasted malts and grain and a moderate coffee scent. The body feels fuller than some Irish Dry Stouts I have had. The rich bitter flavor merges with the coffee and the dry hops to bring out a desirable traditional stout."
"D. A nice, well balanced stout. Worth trying if you have not had it as yet to see how it compares to Guinness. I quite like this, my favourite beer from Porterhouse to date."
"I felt like I went back in time with this beer. ""A truly traditional stout", the label tells. I wouldn't literally go back in time for this, though it's a pleasant surprise to see a throwback beer in today's quick changing beer market."
"O - Very good traditional stout, not sure $14.99 a four pack is necessary but I'm guessing it involves importing since I have not seen this many places. Solid adaptation of this style, would drink it all night long!"
"Overall, a really good stout. And, at only 5%, one that can be sipped on through the evening."
"Overall: A really solid brew from Porterhouse. This is a nice alternative to the macro stuff and a nice and hefty take on the style."
"D/O: tasty stout to replace other more well known dry stouts that used to be favorites."
"D- Very drinkable full bodied stout. St. Patrick's day is coming and this may be my choice for the night. A little pricey at $4 a 11.2 oz bottle but a very pleasing experience. Cheers !"
"Jet black pour wise. Nice deep black color. Small tan head. Nice aroma of roasted malts and dark cocoa. A somewhat metallic tinge. Great roasted flavor dominates. Nice malty graininess flavor. Distinct bite between the hops and dark malts. Nice mouthfeel-very dry finish wise. A great irish stout-tons of flavor in a low abv. The dryness might get a bit old after while but still a killer beer all in."
"Very drinkable and session-worty if not for the rather steep price of 3.99 a bottle. Still, very tasty and a good match for grilled meats or a pot roast."
"Pours a dark black almost ruby highlighted body with dark tan khaki head froming thick...Aromatics offerup layers of smoke malts from the peat. Creamy milk chocolate with herbal hops plays through as well. Harsh earthiness amongst layers of dark chocolate/strong coffee require somewhat of an honest character. Dark milk chocolate meets herbal dry stout, with character to create a mecca of flavor known to no other man to this date. Mellow carbonation fuller bodied resectable from every angle these pop top brewers are challenging my senses. I hope to continue the challenges found within this beer."
"Drinkability: At $4 a bottle, it gave me my money's worth. Compared to the Big Three it is noticeable and exceptional. Very decent stuff."
"A much better example of an Irish Stout than Guiness, the biggest knock on this fine tasting beer is it's cost. Still, glad to have learned of this brewer and to have tasted this stout. I'll keep tis in mind for St Patty's day."
"D: Drinkable, but I'm tried of it by the end of this small glass. Only recommended if you really like stout."
"I've had this on nitro and its much better, stay away from the bottle version."
"D: Drinkability is decent, dry as per style, making for a good pub style beer with a modest 5.7%abv."
"D - one. The bitter hop taste ruins the.great start of the flavor."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. The beer pours with a nice, dark black, opaque coloring. The head is very thin, and a dark shade of brown. The head actually dissipates before I make it from my bar to the couch. The first smell I get is a blend of coffee grounds and a sweet, fruity smell (plum?). The taste is heavy on the coffee flavor, to go along with the aroma. There is also an earthy undertone, with a little bit of sweetness, and a bitter bite to the aftertaste. The aftertaste also has a hint of dark chocolate, along with the coffee again. The beer is actually smooth and light for a stout, with a very dry finish. The bitterness sits in mouth for bit after swallow. The beer is very easy to drink, and I look forward to trudging my way through Dublin at some point to try it from the source."
"I thought this was a very nice stout."
"Pull tab bottle, first time I have had that. Pours promising, black with a little white head. Promising aromas of chocolate and lactose. The taste does not keep up, as very dry and plain. The looks turn into a light reddish colour. Even the aroma dissipitates. Not too drinkable."
"Dr: Make the flavours stronger, and I'll drink it!"
"I poured this brew into my tumbler at 45 degreees. The beer was black off course, kinda chocolate colored. The beer did pour a nice big head that was dark colored. Th beer was bitter on the after taste and left me with a dry mouth. I did not care for it. I will not buy again."
"Appearance is ruddy tawny color with thin off-white head. Nos is woody and roasted like charred oak. Someone said cigarette ashtray which I thought was a bit extreme, but I can kind of see what they were driving at. Palate is medium-light bodied and creamy but bitter and roasted on the finish. Charred wood is the dominant characteristic here. Very dry."
"Simple but seemingly consumer friendly. A basic decent drink with a very nice bold simple black coffee - long lasting finish."
"The full caressing body is beautifully balanced with the tingle of tasty sourness complimenting a very long and very satisfying almost earthy dryness. Every element is there to be tasted yet they merge to make a delicious whole. Ravishing. Top notch. Grand. Feckin grand."
"D: The beer is very dry and the sourness does not improve my feelings on this one. This one just wasn't for me."
"Drinkability is quite high. I could definitely have a few of these in one sitting. Easy to put down and with everything going on in this beer, it is still just simply enjoyable. Clean and great tasting."
"Well, I'll be a son of a gun. It's poifect. Poured with a huge, thick, foamy, frothy, light brown head that lasts and lasts and some lace. Color is basically an opaque black brown (basically because only at the very base of my beer glass where it's very narrow can I just barely see thru the clear garnet colored brew). The aroma is a very well balanced and pleasing blend of roasted barley, malt, coffee, cocoa, pipe tobacco, dark worn leather. Flavor's like the aroma plus there's a bit of sweetness against the dry bitterness of the other ingredients. Plus there's a bit of tang from the acid of the carbonation. Body is full, round, mouth filling and yet the carbonation is exactly where it should be to complement the other qualities. Finish is like flavor and slowly fades with no off characteristics at all. Session for sure. Love this beer!"
"Saw this on nitro tap at Townsend's in Hyde Park, so I thought I'd give it a try. Served in a standard pint glass. Huge surging action when it was ready. Dark blackish color, like charcoal. Intensely thick creamy head atop the body. Wonderful ground coffee smell. Really had the roasted barley flavor that marks the makings of a quality Irish stout. Super thick and luscious body due to the nitro. Very enjoyable on the palate. Easily drinkable and of course it had the low abv known for the style. It's nice to find a new stout on tap every once in a while, as an alternative to the Guinness, Beamish, and Murphy's. This stout is worth looking for on tap at your local pub."
"D - Honestly this pretty much hits the nail on the head for the style. If I was going to Ireland this is what I would hope to find everywhere in place of Guinness. Simply an amazing stout. If you can pick this up do it. I know I will in the future."
"Note: obtained in 2007 (aged three years)"
"D: A very well made and drinkable beer."
"Good beer. I'm going to enjoy this all the way through & mark it down as a ""Summer Stout""."
"Should have just stuck to looking this beer, as it really looks great. As for how it tastes.... mehhhh."
"Very nice to see another Irish beer in my hometown. Pours very dark brown, almost black, and a very tightly beaded head that fades to a swirly cap. Smells roasty and creamy, and fairly mellow. There are some light hops underneath and a touch of light sweetness. Overall the impression is that it is creamy and dry with an edge of roasted notes. The taste is a bit roastier and less creamy with coffee bean and bitter chocolate notes and very little sweetness. Very dry, and even a little austere. Quite a nice beer, and loads more flavor than a certain other more popular stout from Ireland."
"The body was decent, a little fuller than average for the style. The drinkability was good, but that sharpness and metallic taste hurt the score in this area. Overall, a decent beer, worth a try if you see it."
"Pours a great deep brown, just about black, color with excellent head and good lacing throughout. Deep roasted grain scent, a nice heady darkness to the aroma. Very good flavor; a wonderful tasting stout with excellent roasted grains and just a hint of hops at the end; mostly just a great dark malt flavor. Went down very smooth."
"Sorry there, got carried away. So yes, chocolate is a big theme in Wrasslers, both on the nose and in the mouth - though I am not sure of the purpose of putting beer on one's nose, I will strive to discover it though. Despite the big, smooth chocolate flavours, there is a good dose of bitterness to counteract that, I am guessing the Galena hops are responsible there. Simply put, this is so much better than the beer I had on a nitro tap, and I am very glad I have a good stock in the cellar."
"Hands down a solid Irish stout, maybe just a bit puckering."
"D - In some ways, this is a one dimensional beer. The strong, acrid roast character is the dominant, and at times only, flavor in the beer. This may prevent the beer from achieving a great level of complexity, but it is pretty much standard for the style and what the roast character lacks in depth, it makes up for in intensity. The roasted, charred, acrid bitterness of this beer is much more powerful than that of other ""classic"" examples of this style and that allows for a more enjoyable drinking experience as the beer pulls a surprising level of nuance out of this monolithic flavor profile. There are some hints of bread, caramel, and even smoke, but these are largely relegated to a supporting role where they are only called in at crucial moments to balance the acid roast character when it threatens to overwhelm the palate. Overall, an enjoyable example of the style with a sharp acidic roast character and an intense dryness to the finish that whet the appetite and make it a nice aperitif."
"Drinkability is good, but this definitely isn't my favorite for this style."
"Overall this was a pretty drinkable Irish stout however it doesn't have a single defining characteristic that will bring me back. Still, it's worth a shot, especially if you're a fan of the style."
"Pours a deep, warm, chocolaty sable with a nice thick light tan head that sticks around for a bit. Aroma is smoky and oily with a firm, slightly sweet mocha undertone. Flavor is like fine roast coffee with an infusion of chocolate, slightly sweet, slightly bitter, hint of licorice. Texture is fizzy, smooth and just slightly grainy."
"D- Super-drinkable. Sessionable even. Hands-down the best drinking beer I had in Ireland!"
"Glad to see some Porterhouse stuff in my area.Poured into a Bass pint glass a deep near opaque black except for just a hint of deep ruby when held to the light,a creamy-like one finger mocha colored head atop.Deep roast in the nose,along with some faint smoke,and a tinge of vanilla.Flavors are roasty and dry with that smoke coming in a bit,a touch of vanilla imparted sweetness comes in as you drink more.A nice dry stout,more robust than its other Dublin counterpart,pretty good."
"Wrasslers 4X Stout is a true Dry Irish. The American craft scene has always been more fascinated with Russian Imperials, probably because Dry Irish Stouts tend to be lower ABV, but that doesn't mean they can't be packed with flavor. This is not a garish hair-band rock star of a beer, and it does not squeal out a 25 minute solo like KBS does. It is a balanced, 5% ABV Irish stout that delivers: modest, full-bodied and satisfying."
"Very easy drinking, with a refreshing hop finish to every sip."
"Overall, i really enjoyed all of the Stouts from the Porterhouse but I think this one is my personal favorite. It's less sweet and has more bitter and roasted character than the plain or oyster stout."
"This stout seemed rather strange for me, because of that subtle, but noticeable soapy feeling, also quite bittery roasted that sometimes seemed too much."
"D: This has more heft than Guinness or most other irish dry stouts. The odd cigarette smoke note brings out a European bar feel, but does hinder the drinkability. I like it...not everyone will...kind of a bizarre brew."
"taste is thick creamy, dark and bakers chocolate, touch of espresso, end is dry and slightly bitter, a woody aftertaste."
"Pours dark black with a thin light tan head. Smell is roasty and somewhat mild. Taste is rich dark roasted malt and a very light bit of coffee in the flavor. Slightly bubbly mouthfeel, but this was pretty good overall and nicely drinkable."
"D - Can't say I am impressed by this. I wonder how much better the example Mr. Jackson was, because this was not an example of dry stout that I would ever seek out."
"Pours a Guinness like black with very muddy brown highlights. Eventually recedes to a thin foam, and then to nothingness. Very sparse lacing. Thick aroma of dry crea, coffee, oatmeal flakes, chcolate custard. An orgy for the nose to behold. The sip delivers toffee and heavily creamd dark chocolate coffee. The finish is a dry, dried oatmeal feel an flavor. Pretty compex beer. Very dry palate is just irresistable. I just want to drink more and more of this beer."
"Coffee flavors in the first sip, getting into more nutty, chocolate, tobacco, and waxy carob tastes later on. Full enough with a malty base that is balanced and easy drinking. Light for a stout, it shared some characteristics with robust Porter. A 750 was shared, but this is something I could return to easily."
"It's fairly drinkable. I would probably opt for their Plain Porter or even the Oyster if I HAD to choose one, but this would definitely become a regular (or possibly irregular) staple beer if I lived in Dublin."
"A solid brew all around, if i could find another bottle of this i'll definitely be down for another trip through the murk."
"nothing incredibly unique, very subtle in fact, received three of these, so will probably drink again"
"I like it. I like it a lot. A rich, full Irish stout, I need to save a bottle for St. Patrick's Day. Drinkable, but the 750 is enough. Not quite a session beer, as this is a big beer for this style - so don't give up on the Guinness just yet."
"I enjoyed the Porterhouse's other Stout offerings, but this one will be skipped next time around (unless someone can prove me wrong)."
"As fine and complex an Irish dry stout as I've ever had. On tap at the Parliament Street Porterhouse in Dublin's Temple Bar. Nice black brew with a solid tan head. All manner of chocolate and roasted barley in the smell, which play well against a restrained maltiness in the flavor. A clean, lingering, pleasantly bitter aftertaste. I would not classify this as a full-blown session beer, but several in a row don't wear out their welcome."
"Drinkability: I didn't care for this one at all."
"From a bottle that I got through the Michael Jackson's Rare Beer Club: I was immediately impressed by the pronounced roasty smell and richess of the liquid that could be seen in the pour. A seriously more substantial drink than any Irish stout I have had before. Rich and full of roasty, chocolatey and bitter flavor, yet sessionable as the style demands (definately wouldn't guess 7% abv). Perfect. I've been to Dublin several times, but never to the Porterhouse. I will make it a must stop on my next trip."
"One of the only beers from Eire I will miss at home."
"The worst of the stouts I tried at Porterhouse. I think something went wrong when they brewed this batch. Aroma is alright with the characteristic roasted chocolate and creaminess to it but the finish of the smell imparted this weird off flavor. Taste also began good but by the middle there seemed to be a metallic, band aid flavor. This had potential but the off flavors really threw me off and although I finish my pint, it took some effort."
"M&D: consistently silky smooth on the mouthfeel; almost full-flavoured against a medium body, this is a very easy-drinking and flavoursome stout much more satisfying than Guiness IMO. Just like other dark ales by Porterhouse, I think it should be served warmer than cold in order to let a thicker texture to be released. But it's a solid brew all the same. Recommended!!"
"Tasted well; strong roast malts with maybe a trace of blackcurrent and a trace of coffee. Overall, this was a good brew that grew on me. The taste was just as strong at the end of the pint as in the first tasting. Quite impressive."
"I tried quite a few of the Porterhouse beers during my stay in old Dublin city, and this was easily the best of the bunch. By far their thickest, creamiest and roastiest of their porters and stouts. Poured on nitro, a cascading black with a thick whipped cream like tan head. Mild aroma of nuts and chocolate. Thick, creamy slick mouthfeel. Roasty and malty with some sweet hints of nuts and chocolate, moreso than what appears in the nose. An easy drinker, and one that would session quite well. Had I not wanted to try so many of their beers, I would have drank many a pint of this fine Irish stout."
"I loved this Porter. Great flavor... my only regret upon leaving Ireland just yesterday is that I wasn't able to bring some home with me. This very dark in color and rich tasting beer was everything I hoped for. I highly recommend the food at the Brewery also."
"Black, with a creamy head of espresso foam. Aromas are of roasted malts, chocolate, caramel, and a bit of smoke. The taste is roasted malts up front, chocolate and coffee in the middle, and slight green hops and smoke in the finish. This is reminiscent of a lighter shakespeare stout. The mouthfeel is creamy and full and the drinkability is good. This is a good stout from this brewpub."
"This reminded a lot of Guinness but with so much more flavor. I would easily choose this over all those other Irish Stouts anyday."
"The harshest of the beers I've sampled here. This has a chocolate/coffee characteristic to it in the beginning and finishes too bitter for my taste."
"It doesn't have the smooth and cremosisty of a bitter."
"Quite nice, bitter coffee flavours, similiar and better (much better) than guiness, more flavour, and a bit of spice (from the hops), quite hoppy. Nitro-fied, which i didn't particularly like, but there still managed to be some stouty flavour, unlike Guinness, where the stouty flavours seem to be all but lost. And definitely hoppier than Guinness."
"In a city ruled by Guinness, a better stout can be found in the porterhouse.  Wrasslers is a real stout unlike the nitro'ed to hell Guinness on tap.  While G. is smooth by virtue of carbonation and lack of flavor, Wrasslers have true beer flavor and feel.  While you may never give up Guinness, Wrasslers is superior.  If the Porterhouse wasn't a brewpub with limited reach, Guinness would be in trouble."
