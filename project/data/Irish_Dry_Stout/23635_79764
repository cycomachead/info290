3.73,-2.9,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"OV: This is a solid Stout with the addition of the spicy rye adding a nice little dimension of depth to the typical Dry Irish Stout flavours. If the coffee notes were stronger I'd be enjoying this even more, but it's good. I'd have this again.","GuinnessAtRogerWilco","Aug 06, 2013"
