This careful juggling act was set within a really top-rate presentation / appearance / texture context, which helps the beer to produce an impression of something really special, greater than merely the sum of it's individual parts.","WastingFreetime","Sep 18, 2012"

The aroma is moderately roasty, bittersweet chocolate, and piney hops, solid. The flavor is a burst of piney hop flavor, followed by smooth bittersweet, roasty malts with moderate hop bitterness. The beer finishes slightly dry with a long lingering pine hop flavor. A delicious balance of hops and dark malts. The mouthfeel is medium-full and rather silky with medium carbonation.

The smell of the beer is hopped and has some coffee and roasted malt aromas on the nose. The taste of the beer is bitter with the chocolate, coffee and hops all working together to make a fairly nice complex brew. The mouthfeel of the beer was smooth with a lighter body than I expected it to have. Overall it's a another good brew from a great brewery.","Knapp85","Mar 12, 2012"

Pours a clear very dark brown color with a nice 2-3 finger fairly dense tan head with great retention that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big roasted malt, toast, chocolate, biscuit, coffee, pine, and herbal hops. Nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of chocolate, toast, roasted malt, caramel, coffee, herbal hops, pine, biscuit, and a touch of molasses. Good amount of herbal/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, coffee, caramel, herbal hops, and pine on the finish for a while. Good hop to roasted malt flavor balance. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is a very nice and interesting dry stout style. Definitely a bit off the wall with the hoppy flavors; but it is nicely balanced and still has a good roasted character. Enjoyed this one.","superspak","Feb 27, 2012"

Lots of hops, chocolate, and some burnt notes. The initial flavors are rather interesting as well, because some weren't noticeable in the aroma. All kinds of citrus and fruit is apparent. Some roasted notes start to creep through when it warms, along with a slight bitterness and burnt notes. Towards the finish, chocolate becomes more apparent. The roasted notes bursts, complementing the chocolate quite well. Citrus becomes overwhelmed by the other flavors, but is still noticeable towards the end.

Aroma is mild but am picking roast malts upfront, burnt sugar, bittersweet chocolate, mild coffee, light woody notes, and some husky grain. Flavor is sweet roast, burnt sugar, carmelized tree resins/fruit, coffee and slightly burnt, sweet granola. Palate is light to medium bodied, chewy on entry leading to a creamy middle and fairly clean dry finish with a pleasantly light carbonation.

THe head formed with only the slightest of help but left a nice lace on the glass. The head was a light chocolate brown color. The aroma was very amazing and I only rated it a 3.5 as I felt it was very off style. The smell was a extreme piney aroma coming from this stout. The roasty dry aroma from the malt was in the background and helped push the piney aroma threw very easy. I enjoyed the smelll but felt it was off charector. The flavor was pretty hop forward but amazingly blended with the roasty dry malt flavor very well.

The nose is pretty underwhelming with some roasted notes and a bit of coffee. The taste amps things up a bit with some stronger roast and espresso notes plus a bit of dark chocolate.

The nose comprises chocolate, kinda light roasted malts, barley husks, and toffee. Honestly, it's as though I'm sniffing my malt bag on the way home from the homebrew store, en route to my own sweet stout. Delightful! The taste holds notes of light chocolate, roasted malts, toasted oats, and a light bit of anise in the back. The body is a svelte medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a damn fine Irish stout. Straight up. Get some!","TMoney2591","0"

There is a hint of bourbon mixed within the heavy chocolate notes. It's like smelling a malted milk ball. The taste is a nice dry chocolate flavor there is almost a lemongrass flavor or some other earthy herbal note to the flavor on the back-end. This is pretty darn nice for the mouthfeel.

It tasted roasty and bitter but with some fruitiness. It was a bit dry and bitter with a slightly leathery finish. It isn't as sweet as it leads you to think it is when you smell it. That was a bit disappointing in my book, but it doesn't make it a bad beer. It was just a bit bitter for my taste.

Wonderful coffee aromas but there's a fruitiness that really sets this beer apart from other Irish Dry Stouts or any other stout for what it's worth. The aroma is only an appatizer for the flavor. How did they make such a wonderfully complex beer and make it so sessionable at the same time? Lot's of roasted flavors, coffee, caramel much like other stouts but only better. But what really makes this beer special is the hops. I don't understand how 3 Floyds seems to make the perfect hoppy beer everytime. They manage to pack lot's of hoppy flavor in their beers without making it a hop bomb. This beer is no exception to the 3 Floyds rule. The mouthfeel is wonderful and somehow is both creamy and dry.

The intensity of the roast and hops work well to intensify the medium-light body, making it seem a little bigger than it is. The initially high carbonation subsides, resulting in a moderate level that is appropriate. I'm enjoying this, and would love to try it again, and on cask if possible.

Nose also has a roasted hop bitterness to it, but once again it's damn hoppy. I don't know if you could do an irish stout any better than this. Dry and roasted taste around the edges with a smattering of hops that just makes your mouth water. The feel is very crisp and on the lighter side, but thats exactly what I like about it.

Other than that their is coffee and some chocolate, and some nice roasted malt in the smell. Nice smell overall. The taste has an overpowering coffee thing going on especially in the aftertaste, not necessarily bad though. There is also some chocolate in the taste as well as roasted and smokey flavors.

The mouthfeel is lacking though, rather watery and feels undercarbonated feel where there should be a thicker, more substantial body. Black Sun has a fuller, more substantial and chewy mouthfeel which places it a step above Moylan's, but the flavor profile is again off from the style. Licorice and a slight chocolatly sweetness mixes with an undercurrent of estery fruitiness. I am going to have to give the edge to Moylan's on this taste test that wasn't even that blind thanks to the huge amount of hops in Black Sun. Moylan's tastes more like an Irish Stout should while the Black Sun tastes a bit too sweet for my tastes.","bluemoonswoon","Dec 17, 2008"

The flavor profile is actually really nice on this. The taste loses the floral aromatics and sticks more to the dry Irish stout style. Dark bitter coffee, bitter chocolate, dark fruits, and roasted barley work very well on the palate. I am really enjoying the flavors on this beer, but my nose and my palate are not syncing up here and that really takes something away from the beer.

Balanced with a great bitter finish. Medium-to-heavy thickness on the mouthfeel, a little chewy. Very drinkable beer due to its balance of flavors.

Light smokiness wrapped around bittersweet chocolate finishes with a bitterness of both hops and roasted malt. Sweet, dark fruit meshes with deeply roasted chocolate. The body is medium with a relatively light mouthfeel despite the low carbonation level. This oscillates all over the place, with one taste being filled with roasted bitterness, while the next is dominated with fruit. The vanilla comes through, but it is smoky, as if you held a whole bean over an open flame and it started to burn. An alcohol prickliness tickles the back of the throat.

Flavor starts with a big deep roasted malt that goes quickly past a sweetness in the middle to a powerful sour-tart sweetness. I also get a little anise-black licorice up front in the roasted maltiness. Medium in body and fairly smooth and soft on the palette, the finish has some hop bitterness with a nice dryness that brings the roasted flavor back up.

4.05,0.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Yep, it's dry all right. Upon the first few sips, I began caughing up suit. But that does not mean that it's bad. In fact, it's an amazing Dry Stout. The look is an expected nearly-opaques burned amber brown with a light and airy foamstand, slightly tan in nature. Smells strongly roasted (coffee-like) without any burned or ashy aromas. Sweetness is light and a fermentation yeastiness persists in the nose. Tastes boldly of roasted grains, cocoa, and campfire-like. Sweetness really takes a back seat to the rosted grains and offers only a balance to the roastedness. Hop detection is nil, relying majorily on the roasted grain for bittering. Lightened in body for an easy drinking beer. Could handle a bit more creaminess. The finish is very dry and powdery (charcoal-ish). Quite clean despite the roasted grain bitterness. A huge success for FFF.","BEERchitect","Apr 26, 2006"

Overall I'm not sure this beer needs to be as intesne as it is for the ABV, and the hop flavor is slightly out of balance and hurts the drinkability.

The malt give me impressions of chocolate, light caramel sweetness and a moderate coffee roastedness coming in the end. Flavor hits immediate with hop bitterness and citrusy hop flavor with a nice herbal and fresh hop character. Behind that, there is good roasted characte r giving notes of coffee and a lighter chocolate sweetness. This is definately dominated by the hops in the flavor. Feel is on the thick end of moderate with a light carbonation that helps if feel like its a thicker brew. I like it. This one is definately an American Stout to me, not a dry stout, but call it what you want. I think its very tasty. I'd like to see the hop dowgraded a bit, but that is not the style of 3F's.

I got excited hoping that he meant to say Dark Lord, but alas, found this in the box instead. No matter, at this price from this brewery, it must be something at least close to the Dark Lord. I was surprised when I looked it up at home to see that I payed 10 bucks for a 5.2 percent dry stout. Ahh well. Anyway, 22 oz. bottle with an awesome label and a blurb about the beer that could easily be typed into this website as a review. As I pour the beer, it looks fairly viscous and settles into the glass a black with ruby tinges, and a half-inch of yellow/brown head that leaves some lacing. It smells like fruity hops at first, followed by chocolate, coffee, and notes of vanilla. The flavor follows suit with additional notes of roasted malts, raisins and other fruits, and leafy/green/citric hops. The body isn't as thick as the label implies - I'd say it's medium bordering on thick, but still feels nice. I didn't really believe it to be a dry stout until the end, as the American hops remind me of an American stout, but I'm sure there's an Irish back there somewhere.

Bitterness was balanced with the malt and seemed to grow as the beer warmed. There was a pleasant dry roastiness, almost a mild coffee flavour, that played well against the piney hops.

This beer left a hoppy dry finish in the mouth and across the tongue, kind of reminded me of having a little pinch of hops between the cheek and gums. Very rich and it is a good beer. Totally different then there other stout that I had, the Dark Lord. Another winner from the 3 Floyds.","Jarod","Dec 16, 2002"
4.36,8.2,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A big, roasty stout that (of course, being Three Floyds) has a very healthy amount of hops. A little more body than a Guinness stout, but not quite an Imperial-style stout either. Too thin for that designation. This is a stout for those beer drinkers who like their beer dark, roasty and very hoppy. Something akin to a Sierra Nevada Stout.","marcobrau","Beers"
3.53,-12.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I keep telling myself... ""they're not normal..."" and this is not by any means a normal stout... It looks normal enough: opaque and black with a thin but persistent head, and a beautiful lace all the way down the glass. The aroma is the first clue that there is something different here. Chocolate, coffee, pine, and citrus heavily hopped. The flavor begins with coffee, and finishes with pine some notes of chocolate quite a bit of bitterness. Very dry and smooth but thin for a stout. The hops seem a little out of whack it could use a little balance. Even though I love some of the beers that Three Floyds puts out, sometimes normal is ok.","zerk","0"
