4.06,14.4,3.5,3.75,4.25,4,4.25,"Nice thick, fluffy head with slightly larger bubbles than some in this category but still leaves a nice lacy residue.  Defiantly a nice kind of roasted or nicely toasted smell and taste, which I love.  Very evenly balanced in flavor.  Reminds me of Guinness Extra Stout but without the burnt, bitter or even sour taste. Also, I would like to mention that this beer is lighter feeling and not as syrupy and thick.  Overall, a great choice for a No Bullsh!t Irish Stout.  After all, it is a ""World Beer Champion""","KyleDeem5150","Dec 28, 2014"

3.81,7.3,4,3.5,4,3.75,3.75,"The body's good, and it's not too heavy considering it's not the Americanized idea of the style but sticks to the original blueprint, as it were. It is quite dry, though the leaf and chalk build up in the back of the throat with time. That lingers to some effect.","Brenden","Apr 26, 2014"
3.75,5.6,4,4,3.75,3.5,3.5,"Upon the initial pour this beer appeared to be a strong/heavy stout. It has a semi strong coffee scent but not overbearing. The taste is lighter then many other stout I have tried and there is a much more carbonated mouth feel then you would expect from a stout. Easy to drink with a definite chocolate hint to its flavor.","ZachMcGinn","Apr 21, 2014"

3.9,9.9,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light char, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity of bready/roasted malt notes with light-moderate hops; and good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light char, herbal, light raisin, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roast, dark bread, toast, light char, herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of bready/roastedmalt notes with moderate hops; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, and moderately creamy/chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice dry stout. All around good balance and robustness of bready/roasted malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 15, 2014"

3.5,-1.4,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.25,"Overall, the best thing about this brew was the quality of roast through its flavoring and its aroma. While neither was a blow away, they both kept the drinker interested, and although they weren’t very deep and complex, they did just offer enough of that drying fire and soft smokiness. In comparison the feel was on the thin side and generally unremarkable. We were waiting for a table here to eat, and standing at the bar this one caught our eye in a cooler otherwise filled with your typical Asian offerings. So for that purpose, to kill time while chatting with friends, it served its purpose well, but even still might not be our first recommendation to someone looking for something on the darker side of the equation.","TheBrewo","Jan 26, 2014"

Not a lot of flavor to speak of here, faint roasted grain, really not much going on. Relatively light, medium high carbonation. Better than Guinness, but not by much.","BMMillsy","Nov 05, 2013"

4.57,28.7,5,4.75,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Looks great with a head that allows you to pour the entire bottle at once, into a pint glass. The smell is cocoa, with the aftertaste from the last sip dominating. The taste is nice. I normally prefer sweet or American stouts, but this is a good change of pace. The balance is good, but it does have more bitterness than the stouts I prefer. If you're going to drink an Irish Dry Stout, this is a great one!","sneakymagician","Mar 14, 2013"

3.7,4.2,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"This is a nice stout. There is a good roasted/smoked tone that is just a hair about subtle that stays consistent throughout. Hearty body. Might be a bit too heavy for this style, honestly. It's still a good beer, though I'm not sure if it really fits to style. (Too heavy in body. Too much carbonation.)","RblWthACoz","Aug 26, 2012"

3.35,-5.6,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Stouts aren't my first or second choice, but I received this on trade. Pours dark and kinda scares me (in an I don't like dark beer kind of way), with a moderate to low, and fleeting head. Prominent lacing. This is a dry stout, and the first taste of this is not overly malty, thin-ish in a refreshing kind of way with roasted notes, and chocolate, and burnt coffee and light malt. Nose is malt and coffee notes mostly to me. Mouthfeel is substantial but not meaty, and some dryness perceived. Overall I was prepared to maybe not even finish this, but in the end I found I liked this more than I anticipated. I'm not sure this converts me to brews with loads of roasted muscle, but I finish this and thank my friend for the experience. I wouldn't turn this down again either.","Bitter_Echo","Jul 11, 2012"

3.49,-1.7,3,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Nice nose of roasted barley. Taste is bold, black malt with plenty of scorched sugar, but not at all sweet. Light body and a watery, refreshing mouthfeel. No hint of sweetness. Very grainy and more than a hint of charcoal. Tastes like a ""light"" black Irish Stout to me. Less head than you might want. Very long bitterness to finish. Quite hoppy.","mactrail","Sep 19, 2011"

A good gloomy day drinker as there was a light drizzle outside while I had this one. I could do a few of these in a sitting. I picture it as a good accompanyment to a stew or maybe the baked potato soup that was going in the crockpot.","GRPunk","Apr 03, 2011"
