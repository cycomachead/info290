3.56,-0.3,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"355 ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pitch brownish-black with a moderate amount of tan head that settles out quickly into a thin topcoat. Aroma is rather subdued but pleasant, milk chocolate is the main vibe I am getting along with coffee and hints of caramel and charcoal. Slight earthy Goldings hop. Palate flips the script and is predominantly coffee, more earthy and dry than the nose suggests. Hints of red berry. Drinkable (read: thin bodied), rather fizzy, and slightly citric. The sour note is likely an attempt to emulate the vaunted Guinness soured flavor and frankly manages to trump the original, although this is perhaps better described as an alkaline "soda" effect here. Not bad but finishes strangely empty and I think the intended target was overshot with regards to sessionability. Looking for the flavors to pop more.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 24, 2014"
3.8,6.4,,,,,,"You can never go wrong with a brew from The Brooklyn Brewery. Nose is a nice roast hops with an airy scent of coffee. Pours a rich dark brown almost black, like liquid dark chocolate. Head has small bubbles, rich in appearance that hugs the inner glass. Second nose now detects the chocolate, but barely. First taste is light: More coffee than chocolate, although it's there (can't really call it mocha: For the two are distinct on their own). I don't think they roasted the hops as long as one might usually to produce a porter, doppelbock or especially, a stout. Surprisingly crisp at the finish. One disappointment of the Dry Irish Stout is that with all these interactions, I found it somewhat one dimensional. The flavours and the ingredients didn't seem to be layered together as well I thought it ought to be. Still, this is a very good, yet disarmingly easy-going brew.","Solo007","Sep 22, 2014"

Aromas of bitter coffee with a hint of chocolate and a touch of earth and dark fruit. The flavor is bitter roast and light chocolate with a hint of acrid earth. Light to medium body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a slick sharp mouthfeel. Nice dry stout, a little bit sweeter than the standard Guinness, but a nice easy drinker.","johnnnniee","Mar 28, 2014"

Taste is reminiscent of dry roasted malt with light Coke notes. Body is thin and carbonation is way too strong for style and resemble more of a cola than a beer. Drainpour.","Phyl21ca","Mar 28, 2014"
3.58,0.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.25,4,"Final Grade: 3.58, a B grade. While it's not the most interesting stout I've ever tried, Brooklyn's Dry Irish Stout is still a solid example of this highly sessionable style. The flavour profile should be quite agreeable to most palates, although the thin body and weak aftertaste prevents this from being a truly outstanding stout. A good introduction to the style for anyone curious, and something that I would consider picking up again. It's certainly better than Guinness, although it's probably not as pretty.","thehyperduck","Mar 27, 2014"

Dark roasted grain front with a lots of coffee and charred grains. Sweetness is of the burnt variety and fleeting at that. Finish is short and earthy with lots of dark grains and a touch of ale yeast. Very smooth drinking. Feel is crisp and light with well proportioned carbonation that lends itself to sessioning.

Aromas of light milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, dark bread, toast, toffee, and some light and dark fruitiness. Solid and pleasant aromas with good balance; but there is hardly any strength here, very mild. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, light coffee, dark bread, toast, toffee, floral, and light fruitiness. Lingering notes of chocolate, roast, dark bread, light toffee, and light fruitiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice and pleasant balance of dark malt flavors and subtle fruitiness; with zero cloying flavors present on the finish as expected. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a lightly creamy and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a good dry stout. A little mild on flavors; but has good balance and is easy to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 02, 2013"

The aroma smells of cocoa, roasted coffee and a good bit of ripe citric hops, all giving this a rich tanginess in the nostrils. The taste is the same, with a smooth mix of chocolate, dark coffee flavors, some rather assertive ripe citrus flavors and a then a dry roasted finish. The feel is medium with a smooth and creamy carbonation in the mouth. Maybe it was the freshness here on draft but those hops really had a nice pop to them, with this overall having richness to the flavors that I wasn’t expecting.

The label is printed in gold for Brooklyn Brewery, Kelly Green for the Irish Catholics, Orange for the Irish Protestants and White for the eventual peace that will bring an end to The Troubles. The finger of rocky, deep-tan head was active with carbonation and quickly bubbled away on the morn, leaving some lovely lacing in its wake. Color was a deep-brown with little light penetration, just enough to show off its garnet highlights, especially at the edges. Talk about truth in advertising! The nose smelled of strong black coffee, dark chocolate and freshly dug dirt. Spot on, lads! Mouthfeel was medium and the roastiness of the malt was the prevalent flavor in the mouth. I would put it more towards coffee than chocolate in terms of initial flavor. It was on the finish that I really tasted the dark chocolate strongly. The lacing clung to the glass the way I clung to my maternal Grummy's leg as she moved about in her kitchen making Irish Soda Bread and other traditional meals when I was but a wee one.

Mouthfeel is light bodied as well as carbonation. Its a good brew but not one that makes my top ten. I'll offer this to those that believe Guiness is too heavy.","sfsean28","Jan 27, 2013"

4.13,15.7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"An excellent session ale found on tap at Mad Mex Robinson, pours a pitch black body with a light khaki tan airy head...fluffy texture forming everlasting head that has great retention. Aroma kicks up mild herbal earthy mint like hop edge, amongst the dark roasted malts, creamy textured hints of dark chocolate and mild coffee but remains pleasantly roasty with malt character. I noticed a non nitro tap which was a plus and actually brought out more character in this beer. Dark roasted malts bring ample bitterness a touch of tea like leafy earthiness going on as well, but a semi sweet multi-dimensional malt complexity comes forth with each sip...hints of creaminess, dark chocolate roasts in a light stout form. Mouthfeel was medium bodied easy to drink, nothing cloying or harsh on the palate very approachable beer to drink in number. Overall, I'm happy to see Brooklyn putting out a stout other than Black Ops, or their Chocolate Stout, this was pure brilliance.","WVbeergeek","Apr 07, 2012"

It's like a slightly bigger version of Beamish. The body isn't light, but it's on that side of medium, and creamy. I wouldn't mind having a few pints. Tasty stout, find it if you can.","tempest","Apr 02, 2012"
