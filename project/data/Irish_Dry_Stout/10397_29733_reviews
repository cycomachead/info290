"The beer appeared a nice, thick black color with a nice dark tan cascade and thick, dense, dark tan head, with excellent retention and some lacing. The beer gave off a very light, much lighter than expected roasted malt aroma with perhaps a slight hint of coffee. The beer had a nice malty taste that one would expect from a dry stout, with a slight bitterness to it. The beer had a good moderate feel to it, and it was smooth, creamy and very easy to drink. Overall a good beer, but my favorite is still Beamish."

"Overall: this is a very nicely flavorful Irish stout. The body is full for the style and this one is very flavorful."
"D - Nicely done and a better than average version of a be that few craft breweries attempt."

"Drinkability: Amazing beer. Nice, dry, and sweet. This is my new favorite in the style. Very true to the style, yet pleasantly complex. This one may be better than their pils."
"Overall a nice easy going flavorful session brew."
"Big flavor,low ABV. What else is not to like about this?"
"Drinkability: easy drinking, but not necessarily worth it with other stouts around..."
"D: Very drinkable, this was a great mix of flavor and feel, especially on the Nitro Tap so this is something I will be looking for again."
"D - I would definitely get this again. Packs a nice punch of taste and bitterness in the finish which keeps it interesting."
"I've had this this several times now - each time on nitro - and each time it's a dependably decent brew. Love the nitro and it's ultra-creamy pour - cascade action! - leaves an inch thick compact velvety khaki-colored head atop of the pitch blackness below. The scum left behind is immaculate. Being served via nitro, the aroma can range from quite muted to a soft roasted bitter - not a wide spectrum - but, for what style it is, it suggests something weightier, or more substantial, in density and concentration of flavor and feel than say Guinness Draught (which essentially is dirty water). Lovely smooth, more bitter than roasty, taste. Real creamy. Actually hangs on the palate nicely. I've had it with a more relaxed degree of nitro and the flavors really blossom. Hints of industrial coffee and some vague nuttiness. They really nailed the style as I sometimes confuse it for Murphy's (though it's still better)."
"This is definitely my favorite American-made Irish Dry Stout and the flavor profile and low ABV are perfect for an all-day session."
"Pours a deep amber, almost black in color with a creamy white head. In the aroma, a faint roasty malt. In the taste, grassy and a small dry roasty malt. A smooth and light bodied mouthfeel, with a dry, small bitter aftertaste. Quite thin, and lacking in flavor and aroma."
"Drinkability is decent. A nitro stout with nothing out of place, but not a whole lot stands out. A fair attempt at a Guinness imitation brand."
"On nitro tap at Sly Fox Brewery (in Royersford) into a standard pint glass. Poured a with a creamy one-finger head which settled to creamy off-white coating. Lacing was abundant and lasting. Nose was some chocolate, roasted malts and coffee. Taste was dry and moderately bitter, heavy roasted malts, grain some chocolate, and burnt coffee. Mouthfeel was light, very creamy and well-carbonated. I can't remember the last time I had a beer that was 3.6% ABV but clearly you could down a few of these without damage. A decent offering but nothing I would go out of my way to have again."
"T- This beer has a nice smooth vegetable (celery)) flavor to it. For a stout, it has a bit of tart chocolate taste, but very smooth once down."
"D: Fairly drinkable, and not as thick and one might perceive. Still, nothing overwhelming, either good or bad. Stout's aren't my favorite style, but I've tried several and have begun to appreciate them."
"Pours black with huge dense undulating head that takes several minutes to settle down. Aroma is roasted, like bitter chocolate or smoke, and evident at a distance. Flavor is sharp and coffeelike, bitter roasted like an excellent campfire. Deep caramel, round nutty bitterness. Mouthfeel powerful thick and creamy. Insanely creamy."
"D-it does bring some flavor and is very low in body, seeing the alcohol content just now i realize why it is so light. i guess i should give it a higher score b/c you could drink this all day and never get drunk; but personally i'd rather get drunk fast and drink something i enjoy."
"D: A pretty good mouthfeel and taste combination makes this beer very drinkable. While the mouthfeel seemed to be almost spot on for what I was expecting, the taste could have used a little bit more robustness with the roasted notes. Overall, still a nice beer overall and worth a shot if you get the chance."
"excellent Irish stout....actually prefer this over that other ""well known"" Irish stout"
"Overall: Exceptional drinker! I could see myself having many of these over a course of an evening. Prefer this over Guinness and Victory Donnybrook."
"This is one of my favorite stouts. It pairs exceptionally well with food and is not obtrusive with other flavors. The lacing is great. In my opinion has overtones of coffee and nut."
"Pours a clear dark orange, brownish tinge, very thick light tan head forms, drops a ton of lace on its way down, settles to a very thick layer, very creamy looking, bit light in colour for a stout though. Smell is alright, grainy and sweet, some caramel, light roast and chocolate, toasty bitterness, some raisins and dark fruit, not too bad. Taste is very dry and grainy at first, caramel sweetness, toast, light roast and chocolate, oats/cereal, very dry in the finish, light on flavour but nice. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low to medium carbonation, very smooth and drinkable. Just a bit too light to be great, but a decent Irish stout."
"Nitro tap at the Tap and Mallet,black, big creamy head, creamy mouthfeel, coffee grounds for taste, roast and one-dimensional, that of course is mediocre compared to the stout I want to drink. ALso not overally dry. Would like more stout flavour, maybe in a bottle?"
"This is a nice take on the style, not the best I have ever had, but a good alternative to some other irish stouts."
"Overall a nice Irish style lighter stout that can't rival the serious stouts, but Sly Fox made it that way. This beer was made to enjoy as a light offering that one could drink anytime. I really enjoyed it, but it is not something I would pick again if I was heading to Sly Fox since so many of their other beers are kick ass. Don't get me wrong, I would drink one anytime, but there are beers I enjoy more from them."
"This is exactly what an Irish dry stout should be. Just plain delicious. It's a very creamy body with a thick head and lacing. The flavor is a slightly milky, deep roasted flavor with an aroma to match. A great example of the style and oh so drinkable. Find this and get someone else to drive you home."
"Look is a solid stout appearance, dark brown (nearly black) with a surprisingly light finger of nice off-white head that leaves impressive lacing as the beer goes down. Nose is fairly mild, pretty dry roasted malt smell. A touch sour. I guess this is what gives the beer a little more character. Sourness comes through throughout the beer, very limited sweetness. Roasted malt as well. Feel is creamy and full bodied, solid. Overall, I could have a few of these, but the sourness might be a little limiting. I prefer my stouts a little sweeter, although that might not be this style."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink; a good example of a subtle, but flavorful, low ABV beer"
"Overall- An easy Stout to drink. Not the boldest of flavors but solid and a good beer to finish the day with."
"Super dark black, with a creamy, velevetty thick cappucino head on top. Some interesting things in the nose besides the usual roasted barley, with a soft coffee and slight bitter chocolate. There was also bbq, liquid smoke, bacon, roasted hot pepper. I didn't find those when I tasted the beer (maybe a little smokyness) but I did get the coffee and chocolate, and a little tin. Not huge, and finishes with a metallic coffee flavor, and a nice creamy mouthfeel."
"Flowing on a nitro tap at Trivia Pub in Moon Township, pours a dark brown almost appears black especially in the lighting of this grundgy pub. Tan head forms thick and lasts awhile and forms lacing with each sip from the pint. Aroma is a bit muted with touches of dark chocolate and light coffee notes a bit of an herbal hop finish but really nothing stands out. Flavor profile is solid a clean well balanced dry Irish stout that goes down with ease and has some of that tartness lactic edge that Guinness has. Light dark chocolate and coffee presence finishes with a touch of herbal hops dead on to the style. Mouthfeel is light and airy in body with creamy nitrogenated carbonation. Drinkability is with ease and the abv being so low this one is definitely a sessionable brew."
"Cheers!"
