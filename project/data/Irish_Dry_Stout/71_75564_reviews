"Commercial transnational parody on a good beer"
""
""
"Pours deep black, highly carbonated, nice frothy head. Smells of smooth roasted malts. Tastes of roasted coffee malts. Goes down real smooth with a slight bitterness in the aftertaste. Overall this is a really good Irish Dry Stout. High recommend."

"Enjoyed in a pint glass from the bottle.  Pours a dark brown with decent head and nice lacing.  Nose of chocolate, brown sugar, and roasted earthy grains.  Flavors of chocolate up front mingles with lightly sweet malts and a dry, slightly sweet clean finish makes this a good session stout, but not what I was expecting from one of my favorite brewers.  Solid, but not a big robust stout."

"Pours a pitch black in color with a thin foamy beige head that settles to a very thin layering along the sides of the glass. Some light spotty lacing is seen and actually leaves a light ring when sipped. The aroma is of dark roasted malts but is faint. Perfect carbonation. The taste of roast malts are right up front with a hint of dark fruits and coffee even. More going on with the taste than what the aroma suggests. Very slight dry finish but doesn't last. Overall a very decent brew."

"O: do not serve too cold: a richer and more complex flavor unfolds at warmer temps."
""
""
"Very good stout, dry and relatively unsweetened with nice roasted notes. Assertive, but not boring."
""
""
""
"The taste also brings out the dark malts, sweetness, and caramel while the hop bitterness at the finish is a but more muted but definitely there. There is a dry lingering finish. Great pub beer! Bring it on!"
""
""
"Overall: Easy chocolaty, roasty sipper. Nice balance - good stuff."
""
"O - a real surprise. Sweeter than I expected, but the balance is just wonderful. And a blast of flavour for a 4.5% beer."
""
"No Black Cab for me to take me home after one of these, but I would tackle another bottle. A good lighter, easier drinking alternative to the brewery's London Porter."

"500 ml bottle into pint glass, best before 2/28/2014. Pours nearly pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, toffee, roasted malt, biscuit, raisin, licorice, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of roasted malt and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toffee, biscuit, coffee, raisin, licorice, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toffee, biscuit, coffee, licorice, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Very nice balance and robustness of roasted malt and yeast ester flavors; with a dry and roasty finish with no cloying flavors. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a moderately creamy and very smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is a very good dry stout. Good balance and robustness of roasted malt and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."
"The mouthfeel was mildly creamy with a thin to medium body. This one puts me in mind of a porter rather than a stout. However, I like it despite how it is categorized."

"I like Fullers a lot but admittedly did not realize they offer an Irish dry stout until stumbling across this brew on tap at Beer Revolution here in Calgary (these guys should pay me for all the name-dropping I do on here ... I will accept payment in beer. No?). 16 oz. pint presented as dark opaque black with flickers of brown, not even a colored halo, just inky blackness except for the moderate amount of tan head. Major black licorice on the nose, along with wood smoke and hints of fresh dough. Major licorice on the palate as well. While some stouts offer ample coffee and chocolate, this one combines an earthy bittersweet element with malt to yield a flavor remarkably like licorice all-sorts candy doused with smoke. Fruit is difficult to detect, as the sweetness is more herbal or medicinal in character. A little chocolate emerges here and there. Crisp and chalky with burnt wood and grainy husk in the finish. Very dry but never quite loses the licorice sweetness. Nice take on the style and perhaps my experience benefited from the beer being super-fresh on tap. Unidimensional but I don't expect Irish stouts to be as complex as some heavier North American examples."
"A decent Irish Dry, the roastedness and fuller (hah!), rounder mouthfeel (when compared to you know who) making for an enjoyable tipple. It is nice to sip on a stout and not feel the heat, as well. Worthy of this convivial yuletide pub atmosphere, I must say!"

"Creamy, yet dry in flavour and mouth feel, easy on the palate and one of the best UK brewed Stouts around."

"Overall- A very good and delicious example of the style."
"M&O: lightly carbonated on the mouthfeel, not silky smooth as the London Porter, against a medium body of roast malt-led flavour profile. All in all, a very decent English stout that is easily quaffable without going boring that easily."
""

"Easy drinker, spot on for the style would to try this on cask or nitro"
""
"Pitch black with a healthy, beige head that cascades nicely leaving an inch of pillowy foam. Not much aroma as you might expect from a dry Irish stout. taste -The malt flavor is subdued a little too much, slight bitterness on the end. Mouthfeel - not as dry as expected, very little carbonation, very smooth. This would be a great stout for someone just getting acquainted with the style or if you like the lighter side of stouts. It's mild and smooth, and with a low ABV of 4.5%, it goes down very easy."

"overall, a nice quenching and satisfying brew. usually not associated with term 'quenching', this stout probably possesses that quality due to its low abv. but a great drinker!"
""
"Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium intensity, resulting in a smoothly foamy mouthfeel that fits the flavor profile perfectly: a modestly smooth-sipping beer. Closes quite dry, as expected from the roast malt usage, with very minor stickiness/sweetness lingering around the palate."

"500ml bottle. Pours black with a small quickly fading tan head. Aroma and Taste of sweet roasted caramel malt, chocolate malt, a bit of mocha coffee flavor and bitterness. A medium body, light carbonation. Finish is sweet roasted caramel and chocolate malt, with some mocha coffee flavor and bitterness. A good, nicely balanced easy drinking stout"

"Really dark brown, but mostly clear. Off-white head keeps for a good while. Roasted barley is the true centerpiece of the beer - naked, raw. One may, as I did, detect subtle hints of molasses and black licorice, in varying presence on the nose and tongue. Beginning of a thick blend of the roasted and pale malts in flavor. Quite full-flavored - licorice and bitters up front, acrid-yet-silky roasted barley carrying midway through the finish. All the while, a strong cookie-ish malt foundation. Clean and dry enough. Could drink a few of these in succession. Though not unique, it's of course superbly executed."
"Comes to the table a solid dark brown with faint ruby highlights and a creamy smooth off white head that persists forever. The aroma is mostly roasted coffee with hints of chocolate and lots of dark fruits. Little to no hop aroma. The flavor is lightly vinous with a bitter roasted coffee flavor. Very little sweetness and a hint of earthy hop flavor. Medium to thin body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick roasted bitter mouthfeel. Very nice dry English stout. Creamy smooth and flavorful."
"A decent stout, one I'm glad I found on tap. Some simplicity (or lack of complexity), but it still works."

"500 ml bottle, best before 30 September 2013. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with about a half inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like roasted malt, coffee, bittersweet chocolate and burnt/charred malt. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also a bit of dark fruit noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick and creamy and very easy to drink. I think this is a good stout, I'd pick this up again at $5.29 a bottle. A nice tasty brew if you're looking for something that's lower in ABV (4.5% in this case)."
"Overall a super mellow beer. I could see drinking this often if it was easier to get. What it lacks in complexity it makes up with mellowness."
"This is hands down the best under 5% beer I can think of. So much flavor so much complexity and just well damn. At 4 bucks a glass it's a touch high but on draft this is a perfect beer for someone who's got a drive and wants a bit more volume without you know drinking crap."

"O: Good drinkability. Lovely British Stout"
"This is a fantastic beer. I would be thrilled to drink it regularly and in quantity. It might be the best low abv stout that I've ever tried. I tend to get a bit excited by well-done English beers, and this is a great example to find at my local store, which is more than 5000 miles from Griffin Brewery. So, that's nice. Anywho, Black Cab is an excellent beer, and I'd love to see it included in the fantastic Fuller's regular lineup."

"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Stout."
"Overall, an interesting stout that is unlike many of the others out there. Not extremely interesting but one to pick up if you are in search of something unique and different."
""
"Big roast character, coffee chocolate and espresso flavors abound. Medium body with good carbonation and dry through out with a roastiness lingering in the mouth. Maybe not the best pairing for sushi but I'm liking this beer."
"This makes for a decent example of an English Stout. It is worth a try, but not worth going out of your way to find."
""
""
"A nice taste of England, and always nice to have a Fullers, either here or in London."
"This is a good stout overall. Nice flavor throughout. It's a little weak in the body for my preference, but there is plenty to enjoy taste-wise, especially if you're looking for a low-alcohol, malty dark ale."
"Poured a deep dark chocolate brown with some ruby highlights showing thru,a half finger lighter beige head head atop.Big dry roastiness in the nose and not much more than that,it's nice but really one sided.Big dry roastiness on the palate,earthy with some woodiness with underlying bitter chocolate that off sets the roast just enough.This is old school with its big roast and dryer tones."
"Interesting, flavorfull, and sessionable at 4.5ABV. A nice match for a burger or a steak."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, very mild kick, good representation of style, this is a very poundable beer if you’re in the mood for the style."
""
""
"Overall this was nice to try as I always enjoy anything from Fullers but this is one of their weaker offerings. For the price point, quantity and availability I would just rather get a 6-pack of their Porter because it is a better beer regardless of style. Great for the drinkability and sessionability but lacks a tad in the overall flavor profile."
""
"Black Cab is a little on the heavy side, very filling and enjoyable."
""
"500ml bottle $3.99. I've never seen this before so I snapped it right up for four bucks. Dark black color like a stout would. Aroma is muted, bit of malt. Flavor is very nice, chocolate, delicious. Extremely easy to drink, I killed the pint in about ten minutes. Yum."
""

"Bottle at home - poured black (well, very dark brown) - none of the ruby colouration seen with other stouts - with tan frothy head that dissipated but left tracing on the glass. Aroma - very reminiscent of chocolate (70% cocoa of course - not milk). Flavour is chocolate and espresso coffee - with full, mellow mouthfeel. Good balance of sweetness and bitterness. Same again, please!”"
"It's hard to put any stout or porter against Fuller's London Porter and expect to win, and I don't think this one does that, but a brew's job isn't to be ""better"" than something else. Each style has their own positive attributes, and this one has those in spades. This is a drier brew, and a damned sessionable one at that, and I likes it fine."
""
"O - Really wanted to love it; just fell short of the porter I am so very fond of."
""
""
""
""

"M: balanced between sweetness and bitterness just a little detail is that body is not bold enough for a stout besides that is a very well done beer with character and excelente sensation in the mouth."
""
"O: This beer is a nice light stout that is perfectly sessionable."
"A very powerful stout, maximal darkness."
""
"O: a Superb dry stout, excelent for any occasion."
"Overall a great beer."
"Note: labeled 4.5% in bottles"

"Overall, Black Cab is a solid full-flavoured Dry Stout with one of the chalkiest palates that I've encountered in a while. A great pick for a wintertime session. Thanks for bringing this in, Milos!"
"O- Not bad but I was let down by the taste. It just could have been a bit maltier and if it had the chocolate undertones the aroma delivered I would have been very happy with it. I guess I can't be too critical though as it is a Dry Stout. maybe just not my style of stout."
"Dark black in colour with a thin cap of beige head. Black Cab is dominated with coffee and cocoa flavours with some roasted barley character and a nice hit of bitterness, but in a restarined way. Despite the strong flavour descriptors, this stout is mild and restrained. Its is boldly flavoured, but not intense. Medium bodied and very easy drinking. Nothing exciting, but a solid stout."
"O: A somewhat enjoyable english stout served on cask; however, I personally think it smells better than it tastes as there is just nothing going on for me other than coffee. I'd be curious to try this on draft and a little colder to see if the profile of the beer changes as temp changes."
"D - Not bad; looks very watery; could use more body; still looking for those chocolate notes; otherwise, it makes a good stout and after dinner or bar time drink"
