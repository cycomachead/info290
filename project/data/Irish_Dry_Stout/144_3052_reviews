"I had this beer with a steak and baked potato. The beer was a good complement to the food. I would drink this one again."

"A very impressive, dark, bittersweet stout. Very well-done!"

"Not a favorite. But a straight forward stout."

"O: I'm assuming (hopefully) that this is some sort of brewer's mistake. It tastes like soy sauce and beef. Not really a pleasant taste or aroma."
""
""
""
""
"M. Fizzy, prickly carbonation on a lighter side of medium thickness body."
""
"Pours a black color with a creamy, fluffy head. Has a strong cocoa/coffee scent. Texture is thick, creamy, and robust. It was a little thinner than I expected but still very flavorful and filling as the robust flavors overwhelm your taste buds. Definitely a must try!"
""
""
"Drinkability: Awesome stuff. Who knew ethnic Germans and Poles could brew such awesome Irish-inspired beer?"

"O - A very good stout! Smooth, lots of character, and highly drinkable."
"D: Not for me. Doesn't live up to the rep of good dry stouts."
"overall, right on for the style, but nothing special."
"O-I like this one, not quite as heavy as most making it easy to drink on a warm summer day."
"a bit over-carbd... a bit thin on the mouthfeel, but the flavor is pretty good... I wouldn't buy this again, but I wouldn't turn one down either..."
"Pours near black with a light mocha head. This recedes quite quickly, leaving a spot or two of lacing. Thin collar. Nose is pretty plain with just a bit of roasted malt. As it warms, still not much more. The flavor is quite nice with the roasted malt pairing with some dark chocolate and a bit of bitter strong coffee. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Smooth bitterness in the finish. Pretty good all around."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is made up of lighter malts, but there is not really much else going on. The flavor is roasted malt and not too much else. Both the flavor and aroma are very one dimensional and not too exciting. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"O - a mostly enjoyable stout."
"O (D) - A pretty good tasting beer, pretty solid all around. Interesting without being overpowering."
"O. Probably my favorite seasonal from Sprecher - this beer never disappoints. I would be more than happy to have a bunch of these whilst hanging out in an Irish Pub."
"I will definitely get this beer again."
"Finish is actually a decent bitter coffee such that the end of the beer ""is"" the beer, although short and nothing other than a bit of roasted grain."
"Surely a Sweet Stout from my view.."
"Purchased from the Sprecher gift shop in Glendale, WI. Pours a black body with dark brown corners and thin grayish-white head. Aroma of faint roasted dark malt. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with low carbonation. Flavors of coffee, cream and roastiness with a slightly creamy finish. Good drinkability."
"Pours a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, with some minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some chocolate/toffee notes. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, with some nice chocolate/toffee notes. Medium body, the finish is slightly dry and bitter. Drinkable, a nice brew."
"Pitch black beer with a slowly fading creamy head.Aroma is chocolate and coffee.Taste is cocoa,chocolate and some smoked malts.Pretty smooth and refreshing..nothing offensive.All in all a decent brew.I would recommend to try at least once.I probably would try again."
"I've been looking for an Irish stout I can really get behind drinking for St. Patrick's Day, and I think this is it. Although that holiday has come and gone this year, I'll look forward to drinking Sprecher next March."
"I've had Sprecher's root-beer, but this is the first beer I've had from them. The Irish Stout pours very dark, also appears to be somewhat thick. Smells a little sweet, it is similar to other Irish stouts. Taste again is very similar to other Irish stouts I've had. The aftertaste is a little strong, like black coffee. Overall, I was a little surprised by this beer. Obviously, not the greatest Irish stout out there, but this a very decent beer."
"Overall a tasty non nitro poured IDS."
"D-High for someone who enjoys a great dark stout. Great for winter and fall."
"Back in the day (20 years ago), this must have been the shit. But now with so many good session stouts on the market, Sprecher's version is left behind. Still a decent buy; only $1.99 for the pint-sized bottle."
"D-Great fall/winter or whenever you need a stout beer ....beer!"
"D: Like most Irish-style stouts this is quite drinkable and is a nice cold-weather session beer."
"(D)- A great stout that certainly stands up well to the classic of the style (Guinness). Simple, yet delicious. Straightforward but enjoyable. One of my favorites from Sprecher."
"A beautiful black color with no head to speak of a few seconds after the pour. Smell of a nice roast notes, with maybe a hint of coffee. Nice fizz in the mouth a little bitterness, light roast flavors, small tastes of dark chocolate. A nice dry stout, easy to drink, good session beer. You can drink a lot of these."
"D - As full-bodied as it is, it's definitely more of a drinkable stout."
"Very water, thin mouthfeel for a stout."
"Much, much better in the hops department as it warms. Definitely beats the pants off Guinness and the like for hop flavor."
"tis the season for Irish stout. the caramel aftertaste and the coffee taste is very typical of a stout. the dark amber color is barley see through and has a light creamy head that settles into the beer leaving a light film on top. this beer is nice in drinkability very good for all day st. patty drink."
"D: a very nice stout. i will definitely be taking advantage of having Sprecher within 30 miles from my house and buy this at the local liquor store often until the season is over. i'd love to pick up a growler if im in the area (i think im gonna make it happen)."
"Watery looking jet black color. Not much of a head and no retention. The color is better than Guiness, but needs some more foam for sure. The aroma reminds me of stale an dry marshmellows and roasted malt. The taste makes me thinkof malted milk balls with an almost burnt, roasted malt flavor. Flavorful and sessionable. Non-dairy creamer palate, but darkly and dry roasted."
"I'm a big fan of thick dark beers so I could easily drink a few of these in one sitting, but it might be a little too dark for some."
"(D) A delicious stout. Nice and smooth."
"Drinkability: I was disappointed by this beer, I was hoping for a sweeter stout, but this beer is watery and with an aftertates to match."
"pours a deep black with traces of dark mahogany around the edges w/ a small brown cap that fades quickly leaving a decent lacing in my nonic ; not a strong smell, a buttery, caramel/coffee aroma with faint hints of dried plum and vanilla ; an almost too thin flavor, a french roasted coffee taste up front with some hop bite, a bit of chocolate and a darker fruit with a not unpleasant tart, vinous ""meaty"" undertone midway, finishes a bit smokey with a mineral note ; a light-med. body, not as dry as most irish stouts and modestly carbonated, yet stays creamy ; a very drinkable brew, in fact, i'm going to have one at every BBQ..."
"D- This beer has some nice black malt notes with good flavor but not much depth or character."
"I enjoyed this beer and could enjoy a few more in a sitting. However, it felt like it was lacking something in the taste."
"D: An oustanding Irish Dry Stout made here in America, will definitely try again."
"Had this again 3.5 years later. Creamy, dark, dying finish. Not a bad one."
"Although it's not what I expected. I say this as unfortunetly most of us compare Irish Stouts to Guiness. However its still a great offering. I feel this would serve as a great steping stone towards trying a Russian Imperial Stout for the first time."
"The beer pours a black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid roasted and black malt scent along with a mild hop aroma. It's quite dry with a decent amount of bitterness. The taste is decent. It has a complex malt flavor that boasts of chocolate and roasted malts along with a dry, hoppy finish. It's smooth with just a bit of a metallic off-flavor. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a flavorful beer that very enjoyable. Recommended!"
"Sprecher Irish Style Stout is good beer. Even though I prefer the big, malt-intensive stouts, there's something about a well-brewed Irish dry stout that hits the spot on occasion. Well done."
"overall, a very solid stout, not the best out there but definitely good for everyday consumption."
"A nice job. these classic and traditional beers are Sprecher's strong suit. This is almost sessionable."
"drinkability is good. this is a robust stout, with all the standard flavors, but the brew manages to remain drinkable despite the full body and rich flavors present. cheers!"
"Virtually pitch black. Aroma doesn't have as much roastiness as some and a bit of fruitiness is there too. taste is mostly roasted malt with just a hint of sweetness. Mouthfeel is smooth and supple, with just the right amount of drying finish after a while. Drinkability is good. Overall, a decent offering from a company I always associated with german-style beers."
"This beer pours a nearly opaque black color. The head is one inch in height, tan in color, and recedes quickly into a thin layer of lacing. The aroma is of roasted malt, cream, and a touch of milk chocolate. The taste is like the aroma, but with the addition of a nice mild tartness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a very sessionable dry stout. I would certainly drink this again."
"Into a Guinness glass, pours very dark black, a nice creamy light tan head that sticks around for a bit, fades to a thin film, and leaves some nice lacing behind. The aroma is pretty good, light chocolate and a faint espresso qualities, roasty, nice. The taste is pretty nice too, good roastiness and some faint espresso, chocolates are tasty, good bitterness that rides in with a fine carbonation after a smooth start. If I could get anything more out of it, that'd be great, but as it is its a very drinkable beer, tasty, and easy to drink. Sprecher sure does do dark beers well."
"overall, i really enjoyed this beer it was great as i initially sipped it a little cooler than what the proper temp is, then allowed it warm up very nice"
"Probably sad to say this, but I enjoyed the larger bottles. The price I picked up for this 4-pak was quite decent, and the 16 ounce bottles make it feel worth even more."
"Can't find much fault in this, but it's a bit too ordinary for me to fuss over."
"Sprecher's Irish Style Stout pours a typical black body and frothy-then-creamy tan head with an average amount of lace left behind. In the nose it's roasty and a nip chocolatey with some mild background hops. The body is medium-light, and it's gently carbonated, leaving it smooth across the palate with just a gentle tingle to awaken the tastebuds. The flavor is fuller, and less acidic than most examples; and it offers a lightly sweet note of gently caramelish malt and yeasty fruitiness before it dispalys its softly roasted side. The bitterness is present, but soft, and just enough to keep the malt in check before leading to a dry finish that lingers with notes of dark chocolate and then lightly charred roastiness."
"Drinkability: Smooth and creamy. The low carbonation level makes it easy to have a couple."
"D - I was a little disappointed with this offering. A little tweek in all area would make this a very nice beer."
"First and foremost, this beer is mislabeled. As a milk stout or milk porter, I would give this one a better review but as an Irish Stoutthere are a few problems. Firstly, this beer suffers from a lack of head retention. Secondly, its transparentblack but transparent. Third, this beer is sweetkinda like a milk stout. Also the body is a bit thin and light. Now for the good pointsthere is an excellent mochachocha richness going on in the flavor. Really, the taste is just sublime. Furthermore, the chocolate/coffee flavors make way for Caramel macchiato and ultimately a wonderfully bitter hopped finish. The aroma is equally delicious. If Sprecher could fix the appearance and thicken the body, this would be one hell of a stout. As it is, its quite drinkable and very nice tasting, just not a very good example of the style."
"Pours a standard black stout color, nothing exciting about it. A quick diminishing head is present for a brief period. Smells of roasty goodness. Smells strictly of roastiness. Taste is initially bitter. The bitterness comes from the roasty malts and hops. Not much of a malt body to back this one up. The signiture Sprecher yeast twang is here too. The mouthfeel of this one is pretty much the same as water, very light. This could be quite possibly the best session stout i have had, very easy to drink, unfortunately that isnt everything."
"One of Sprecher's better (best) seasonal offerings."
"Very deep in color with a moderate head and marginal lace. Aromas are malt driven-rich caramel, chocolate, with some buttery/diacytal notes on the tail end. Medium to full bodied with brisk carbonation, the beer exhibits a bit of a smokey/fishy flavor and some off putting buttery nuances, as well as the usual suspects-dark roasted malts giving the usual chocolate/coffee tastes. I wish this beer leaned more to the restrained bitter/dry than the hedonistic, but hey, it's Sprecher. Decent, but not anything out of the box."
"Had this on tap on Irish Fest in Milwaukee, which of course means plastic cups. It looked a very dark black color, gave off a mild hop mocha aroma, which didn't hint at the wonderful taste that I experienced on the first sip. rich mocha dark chocolate that seemed to get stronger as I went through the cup.The mouthfeel was a little thin, a creamier texture would have made this near perfection. The aftertaste was wonderful. Only available twice a year, if the bottled stuff taste this good, I'm loading up"
"This year's batch (2003) was brewed in a pretty small quantity (even more so than past years) so availability is said to be somewhat of an issue. I've had this on tap at Irish Fest in Milwaukee and it's a pretty solid offering. Out of the bottle, though, I wish the body was a little more creamier and fuller. Nose could be enhanced too. It's good, but just a tad bit on the thin side for a really good stout. Overall a welcomed offering to celebrate St. Patrick's Day."
"A very tasty beer with a great aroma...Looks more ruby red/brownish than black, and when I hold it to light it is clearer than you would expect a stout..small soft lace...sweet milk chocolate, hot cocoa, and some coffee tones on the nose...a great taste too..strong milk chocolate with a bit of coffee grounds in the background...minimal hopping and doesn't seem hopped up as much as a dry stout should be..very good taste, but thin in body which makes it very easy drinking but less than ideal for a stout..I would guess the ABV as low but I don't know for sure...solid, and tasty, but lacking the special characteristics of an outstanding stout"
"Almost black in appearance.  Doesn't poor much of a head, which is disappointing for an Irish Stout.  Aroma has great chocolate roasted notes.  I almost get a little bit of sweet chocolate in the aroma as well.  Very nice creamy mouthfeel. Great dark coffee taste.  I'm getting a nice taste coming from the yeast  I believe.  It is unique to me. Nice bitterness.  Finishes dry.  Very solid stout."
"Still, not bad for a one-off, St Patrick's day specialty.  Much better for the occasion than drinking Miller Lite with green food-coloring."
