"Excellent example of an Irish stout. No bitterness, light alcohol and deep rich roasted flavors.  Smooth texture and great head volume,retention and color."
"Not as good as expected. Pretty average."

"12 oz. bottle from BevMo. Black body with a frothy tan head that quickly dissipates. Flavors of black coffee, dark chocolate and burnt toast give way to a big malt base and a surprisingly dry finish. Extra carbonation for a unique mouth feel that helps the flavors dissipate. I think they achieved their goal: a tasty, yet light, session stout."

"Overall:  This is an ok stout.  There are some nice flavors of roasted malt and brown sugar-like sweetness, but in my opinion, there’s too much espresso, licorice and hoppy bitterness for me to really like it.  Further, I think the mouthfeel is too thin, as I like my stouts, to have a thicker, fuller, more viscous mouthfeel that this one has.  If the flavors of espresso, licorice and hoppy bitterness were dialed down some, and the mouthfeel was thicker, more vicious, it would go a long way to making this a better stout."
"The taste was to me was very lean. There was hints of roast and coffee but it drinks so dry and watery and feels way over carbonated that the flavor was almost mute."

"Flavor: U.K. style stout with plenty of very dark roasted malt flavor with little burnt or char elements."
""
"O: Well - it's OK but not amazing. Looks alright, though the head could do with sticking around. The aroma and flavour are decent enough; roasted malt and a dry, bitter finish. The insubstantial body disappoints. Drinkable but won't blow your socks off. No need to hunt it down."
""
"Overall (3.81) : I'm beginning to find that any stout made right is a stout worth drinking. This is another example of that. There are extraordinary stouts, that make you go ""WOW", and there are some that make you go ""hey, it's okay."" That's this one. It's not the greatest or most unique stout I've had, and it doesn't taste like a blue fin fish, so all I can say is that this stout is par for the course. Good drinking, maybe a bit planty compared to the other ones. Due to the abundant carbonation, it may be a good gateway stout for those who are stout-shy. Give it a try."

"O: [2.75] A middle of the road stout that is torpedoed by a stinging mouthfeel.  The Appearance was not great either with the fast receding head and lack of lacing.  With so many good and accessible stouts this one is off the list."

"Popping the top on this one I was surprised at the “poof” of air and slight sizzle of carbonation and unsurprisingly, poured straight into a large tulip I didn’t get a quarter of the way through the beer before a thick four finger head stopped just short of overflowing the rim of the glass. I’m not lying - it took nearly 15 minutes of letting the head die down and pouring a tiny bit more before the whole bottle was in the glass. Umm...maybe a bit over-carbonated, particularly for a style that tends towards lower levels of carbonation? Eventually things settle down into a tan one finger head with zero lacing. Color is almost entirely black (39), with perhaps just a hint of dark brown amber. Nose is moderately strong and essentially all about dark roasty notes, dark chocolate, espresso beans, and perhaps a touch of hazelnut. Sip is sweet dark chocolate up front with coffee notes all over the midpalate. Back of the tongue is somewhat thin and both tastes and feels a bit like club soda. Now may be as good as any time to point out that the massive carbonation in the pour is apparent in the taste and mouthfeel - Blue Fin Stout is vastly over-carbonated, much to its detriment, both for the style and for the overall effect on flavor. Subsequent sips see a slightly more nutty presence, but as a whole this is pretty one-dimensional and actually quite thin, both in flavor and mouthfeel. Finish is bitter dark chocolate and coffee. All in all, this is a pretty unimpressive stout which I would neither recommend nor pick up again. Furthermore, along with their IPA (which had some odd blueberry notes) this is a second beer from Shipyard that has left with unimpressed. (4-18-14)"

"Hmmm....it's riding the coffee line for me, although I'm not the best judge since I've avoided the evil stuff for more than the last 50% of my life. It starts quite sweetly and chocolatey but then as the hops kick in and it becomes more bitter it tends towards coffee. After a couple of sips I'm glad I let the wife have half of the bottle, but trying to be objective I can see this is fairly well done, just not my, er, cup of tea."

"A decent stout for a very good price. I have had several times without being disappointed. I get it in the large bottles and have tried in on tap. I still think the Breakfast Stout is the best available in New Englnd, but we can not get it in NH due to laws of kids being on the bottle."

"Got two bottles via beer of the month club but both were a bust. Inside of the cap had a sticky gunk. Both bottles totally foamed out as they were poured. Came back after the foam settled and tried tasting them. Never had an opportunity to truly evaluate them and felt like I wasted money."
""
""
"o: A good fairly solid stout. If you buy or order this wanting a dry stout you will be pretty well satisfied."
""
""
""
""

"Thought the body a bit thin for a Dry Stout but otherwise not bad at all."
""
"O - Excellent sessionable stout, lots of flavor, not big on alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A disappointment as far as I'm concerned, a beer that was a little thin and definitely lacked in both flavour and smell. A run-of-the-mill stout which is a shame because I was looking forward to this one."

"Pours a very dark brown, actually black with the aroma of chocolate, dark roast coffee and roasted malts. Not much of a head with very little lacing around the glass actually. Tastes like the smell would suggest with a slight dry finish. Overall pretty good and enjoyable."

"O: This is a session stout and is delicious at that. Lacks the ABV of a trophy type stout, but it doesnt matter because now instead of having 2 glasses of a bomber, you can have 6 beers of this and be straight!"

"O: Good, not great. Very easy to drink and noob friendly, at least. I won't get a six pack of it, but it would be a good one to try on tap."
""
""
""
""
"O: I used to have a co-worker who owned a place in Maine not too far from Kennebunkport and the Shipyard brewpub. He used to rave about this beer back in the mid-to-late 90s, and I remember having it back then and kind of liking it. Either it's gotten worse or my taste buds have improved; this is nothing I would ever get again."

""

"O: Overall a generally good stout, won't blow you away, but shouldn't disappoint as a casual example."
""
""
""
"The taste has a moderate to high bitterness but not hoppy. The ending is dry but it does not linger."

""

"O: Enjoyable beer, good for a few. Nice take on the style."
""
""
""
"Overall a tasty stout that has great drinkability. Very true to the style of irish stouts. Would recommend anyone to pickup a sixer."
""
""
""
"Thinner feel to it, and the carbonation was too strong. A miss for me."
""
""
"This is a very interesting beer, as I like how everything works in it except where the tanginess and thinness seeps into the flavor. Everything else is good, but something doesn't mix where the flavor's concerned initially."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a black color. 1/3 inch head of a tan color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, dry hops, and a hint of citrus hops. Fits the style of an Irish Dry Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, slight sweet malt, hint of sugar, hops, and a hint of dry hops. Overall, decent appearance, aroma, and body."
""
""
""
"O - Very disappointing, as stouts are my favorite and I've heard good things about this beer. Perhaps a bad batch or just very old? I will give this one more shot (from a different retailer) in the future. Flavor was severely lacking in complexity for a stout. Smoke and butter were the only two things I got from this. It was difficult to finish."
"Overall this is an average stout, a little thin and lacks that nice bite you get from a stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"Recommended to any Stout aficionados!"
""
""
"O - This hits the style very well. It would make a nice sessionable stout."
""
""
""
"Pours an opaque black with a 1 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Tiny streaks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt and some subtle cocoa and dark fruit aromas. Taste is of dark roasted malt with some minor cocoa powder flavor. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a high level of carbonation that is a bit too much in my opinion. Overall, this is a pretty average stout with an emphasis on roasty malt without any real balance."
"An Irish stout ought to be flavorful, quaffable and offer good value; Blue Fin Stout could be described by all of those things. I could see myself buying a fair bit of this if I were a New England resident. Their products may not be earth-shattering but Shipyard offers consistency and quality which, for me, both make compelling reasons to support them."

"O: Poured from bottle to stein, expecting a heavy flavor and mouthfeel. Might as well poured into a Pilsner glass and treated it as such. Enjoyable beer, easy to drink, just wished it had some more body and flavor."
""

""

"O: Great appearance and decent smell had my hopes up but this beer is pretty plain. Not horrible but basically tastes like guinness without the creaminess."
""
""
"Very nice pour with a soft light brown head and a deep, robust, almost completely opaque color. Chocolatey notes on the nose. Nice toasty malt with a smokey-like character also present on the nose. Medium body with an outstanding charring cocoa-like smokiness. Very good beer. Low alcohol content make this easily a great session brew. Roasty warm alcohol feeling to it. A great winter beer, actually and may be Shipyard's best. This is one beer that proves ABV does not make or break a beer."

"Overall- This one started out okay, but as soon as it hits your lips, it becomes a bit of a let down. It is like they have a base for a stout in here, but then did not finish it by working the carbonation or putting any good malt or flavoring in with it."

"I purchased a bomber a while ago in Maine, and opened it tonight. Served in a Brooklyn Brewery stemmed glass. Dark brown colored body. Nice tan head forms, but faded fast. All that was left was a white circle of foam around the edges of the glass. Smell was appealing, with good notes of highly roasted coffee. Taste was not bad, but I've had better. Seemed like a lot of the flavors didn't meld well; everything sorta seemed jumbled. The roasted coffee flavor was too hidden by that odd sweetness. It also became cloying on my palate. Plus, I got an unusual buttery flavor from this beer at the finish. Lastly, this beer was just a bit too thin on the body. Blue Fin is a decent stout, but I could have remembered liking it more in the past. Now, not so much."
"O: good for the style and good for me, good Black & Tan with the Pumpkinhead"
"D: Very solid stout. Nice nose, good flavor, decent mouthfeel, and it looks okay too. Stands up nicely against the standard benchmarks. I bet it shines on a nitro-tap."
"O - Overall this a great stout, not bad. Easy to drink on a cold night, and enjoy with some steak or bbq. Can be used as a marinating or beer batter as well!"
"With all the killer stouts out there right now, I feel like this beer needs to step it up in order for me to try it again."
"The body is light and the carbonation is soft. Overall, this smells and taste like shipyard. Which in my expirience i just bad."
"This is a bit of a disappointment. I guess I like it better on nitro-tap."
"Seems more carbonated than it actually is due to the real subtlety in flavoring. I'd rather this than motor-oil-thick, seems closer to the porter."
"This was a pleasant surprise. After I recently had Shipyard's (bad) Pumpkin Ale, I wasn't expecting much, but this is a solid, very drinkable stout. Nice contrast of sweet aromas and bitter and roasted flavors."
"Shipyard Blue Fin Stout is a black ale with brown highlights and a brown head that quickly fades to the thin film and leaves decent lacing on the glass. It has an aroma of dark, roasted malt with a hint of sweetness. It's pretty light bodied and a little sharp on the tongue. The finish is dry and a touch chalky. The flavor is very simple: dark roasted malt. It's pretty dry and has a little hint of coffee at the finish. No hop flavor is detected and it doesn't really have any noticeable bitterness, except perhaps at the finish. The roasted flavor lingers. It's simple, roasty and sessionable. This is the kind of beer I like to use when cooking chili."
"Picked up a growler from the Shipyard in Eliot, ME. Poured into a pint glass, the beer is jet black, with only a thin ring of milk chocolate colored, bubbly head. Aromas are strong, with a heavy roasted coffee base and the slightest hints of bittersweet dark chocolate. Flavors are rich and full, with a heavy, bitter coffee tone overpowering almost everything else. There is a slight nutty and smokey highlight throughout, also. The body is light, dry, and slick, which is perfect for the style. The aftertaste is short-lived, but in the span you get a blast of toasted oats and bitter, dark coffee, with a slightly drying and clean finish. Very tasty and smooth."
"O - Overall a decent Irish Dry. Nice beer for Guinness drinkers to try, to get them to enjoy more American craft. Can't say it is much better than that, but iI might prefer it just a bit."
"O- Great drinkability, if lightly bitter and predominantly coffee stouts are your cup-o-tea this is definitely worth taking a try. Great as a slightly warmer sipping stout, or a cold refreshing stout for those dark beer lovers."
"Overall this is quite enjoyable I would have this again for this style no problem. It might be my favorite Shipyard beer to date."
"O - I really enjoy stout beers. This has beautiful color and smells wonderful. Its too bad the smoke flavors overwhelm the taste. I could only have one of these in a sitting and it would be a night finisher."
"O) A decent stout. I'd have another one."
"A very pleasing stout. I just had one to complement the black cavendish I was smoking in my pipe. This beer is smooth and very flavorful with its a slightly sweet woody note. It has a pleasent odor. Enjoyable throughout with a rich carbonated, slightly bitter finish. Definetly one I will go back to. A very enjoyable beer especially on a rainy day on the back porch with your favorite pipe."
"Coal black with a very small head that leaves little lacing. Sweet roasty nose. Not as aromatic as one would expect. Nice malty coffee and cocoa taste with a bit of hop bitterness on the finish. Fairly creamy mouthfeel with good carbonation. Pretty refreshing for a stout. Enjoyable."
"Poured into my ccb pint glass. Wow, a four finger sudsy head, disapates into a two finger head that sticks around. Aroma of dark chocolate, roasted malts, coffee and light hops. Taste follows the nose but a little lighter than expected. Mouthfeel is also a little light even for an Irish dry stout. Average beer"
"Overall this is a good standard stout. Not gonna blow anybody away, but a good solid representation of the style. I'd recommend this to someone who hasn't had it."
"About a finger of frothy beige head over a pitch black. Absolutely no color coming thru, not even at the edges. Aromas and flavors are massive roasted malt. Coffee just absolutely dominates. The aroma is predominantly burnt notes. Mouthfeel is what every nitro beer has to offer...thin and low carbonation. But at least this one is flavorful!"
"Mouthfeel is very creamy and smooth, with little to no carbonation, a medium body, and a watery feel as it flows down. A really tasty stout that went down easy and is a solid recommendation if it’s on tap."
"had a nice cascading pour but with not quite the retention and look of a guiness, but the foaming was decent. aroma of roasted malts, hints of brown sugar, touches of vanilla and a small dose of caramel, the flavor is really kinda odd as it seems to just not go anywhere at all. the feel was a touch thin and left me hanging looking for more taste. roasted malts fade quickly and leave me with little more then a touch of light cocoa."
"Overall I don't know why I put faith into Shipyard again. I guess I assumed they could make a half assed stout which they did but it just didn't justify the singles price. Kind of drinkable but really wanted more roast and coffee..."
"Lackluster in nearly every category. Thin aroma of coffee and soap, combined with a body that's too fizzy and a taste that heads toward Pepsi (you remember that old song... ""Pepsi Cola's a stinky drink; pour it down the kitchen sink; smells like vinegar, tastes like ink; Pepsi Cola's a stinky drink!"") rather than stout or any beer flavor, this is one to avoid. If not for the appealing color this would be a failure in my book. Blech."
"OVerall, this is a pretty good beer. I don't think I would turn it down if offered, but I'm not sure I would actively pursue it."
"I really thought that I'd enjoy this beer, I pouted it out and it looked great at that point. Being a fan of most stout's this one should be good. I took my first sip and I was stunned with a taste of some kind of metallic flavor. I was a little grossed out by it. I let it sit for a little and went back to it and it still gave off this old metallic scotch like flavor. I was able to finish the beer thankfully, but I told myself that this had to be the worst stout I'd ever had."
"O - This is an easy drinking and inoffensive brew, even if unspectacular."
"Another six pack for St. Patrick's Day. The beer poured with a slick, black look with a dark brown head. Aromas were rich with a dark chocolate flavor and a slightly burnt coffee smell. Taste was a little off compared to the flavor. I really could not taste much of the same flavor from the aromas, but definitely sensed a thin, watery flavor from each sip. Mouthfeel was pretty good though. The drink had a creamy texture, but somehow balanced with a light body. Overall, a little uneven but worth a try."
"D - Highly drinkable due to lighter body and smallish ABV, but not likely something I will revisit."
"Thanks to beerthursdays for the chance to try this brew that is unavailable in the big ky."
"Drinkability: Nice Irish dry stout that I have some trouble finding. Purchased a 6-pack at the Hy-Vee (a grocery chain) near me for $6.99. Two weeks later they no longer carry Shipyard products making a repeat purchase difficult. Still, a very drinkable American version of an Irish dry stout."
"But still, it's not bad and quite easy to drink. It's gone...next"
"The body is light and almost fluffy. The carbonation is strong, and all settles into a chalky dry finish. This is definitely a well-flavored easy to drink stout, worth a try."
"I really like the aromas, but the flavors don't quite do it for me. Not filling and flavorful, I say give it a go."
"D- Goes down easily but its just not a fun beer to drink. I won't be buying this again."
"this beer feels surprisingly light for how dark and complex the taste is. drinkablity I would have to say this is a sampling beer because of its stong and complex flavoring. however one could drink this all night but run the possibility of getting tired of it real soon. I will buy this beer again but an every once in a while type thing all and all nice smokey beer."
"D - Nice enough but nothing special."
"Drinkability is pretty high. Is about as prevalent around the Boston area as Guinness Stout, and the flavor is a little more complex and the mouthfeel is thicker. I'd opt for this one if you're looking for an easy drinking stout that's easy to find."
"Pours opaque and black with a tan foam head. Leaves a nice lace ring all the way though the drink. Malty on the nose with notes of coffee and chocolate. Only slightly creamy on the palate. The roasted malt really comes through leaving some hits of it even being a little smokey. The sweetness of the malt is nice on the finishing end."
"creamy."
"D- Lighter side of a stout and easy to drink"
"Drinkability: nice on a hot summer night. Not too heavy, refreshing. I would and will drink again."
"Overall a good and complex IDS."
"Quite drinkable in a sense, yet a bit sweet and with a light level of complexity I don't think I'd want another. A bit bland overall."
"D- terrible, disappointing, definitely a non repeat"
"Overall: My wife who HATES beer liked to sip this during our holiday in Maine. A perfect beer for a cold day."
"D- all-in-all a pretty drinkable brew, not the best stout for the money however"
"This brew reveals a deep dark brown color, solid and thick with a big light brown head and solid lacing. The aroma is a nice chocolate charcoal, simple but true. The flavor favors the charcoal and smoke idea with a hint of dark chocolate. There's a nice sort of melon sweetness that blends without interfering. It's a solid medium bodied stout with a very smooth, near Guinness like feel. The charcoal offers a near lemon bitterness with some dry finishing. It's quite easy drinking for the style, very likable, the best of the three brews I tried this day in Kennebunkport at Federal Jack's Brewpub."
"Pours an oily sable with a fairly thick tan head, good for a stout. Aroma is strong and smoky with an undertone of sweet chocolate. Flavor is smoky and malty with an undertone of chocolate and a hint of coffee. Texture is smooth, slightly grainy and fairly tingly - it does not sit still! Satisfying."
"D: A nice inexpensive dry stout. A pretty rare style actually to see from a craft brewer and this is a good one."
"F: Finish is pretty dry and spicy, with some lingering bitterness. Despite being dry it has a little bit of a sticky syrupy lingering flavor and feel. Some roasted and scorched malts also linger that bring out more of that dry and bitter taste. I think this is actually pretty underratted for the score it has. It's a pretty decent dry irish stout with a little hint of bitterness from hops, some creamy lactose, smoothness, and overall tasty. The lower abv lets you drink a lot and makes it very sessionable."
"This is not the first blue fin i've had I actually used to drink this all the time in the early 00's, the store near my work started carrying it, i thought it would be good tonight. I certainly do not remember this aftertaste. I had bought 2 bottles (magnums) and thought maybe I hadn't washed all the soap out properly out of the glass, so the next night I rewashed a glass, and tried again, but still the same bad taste, I probably will not be buying this again."
"This wasn't my first blue Finn - it was the 3rd of a 6 pack I bought but my first review of it. I remember the first 2 tasting better. Maybe I will revisit this review later...."
"The feel of this light with a bit of a creamy feel to it."
"Not a stout I would drink again. The taste and mouthfeel were not right for my expectations"
"Overall, not a bad beer. I would drink this again but if had the choice would opt for a milk stout."
"Not really up to the standards of Guinness and the rest of the major makers of this beer style. Strictly a try it one time beer."
"Drinkability : I wouldn't sit around drinking this one after another. I probably would not buy it again considering what else is available in this range."
"A middle of the road stout. It poured black into a pint glass. Thin coffee-colored head. Mostly roasted grain aroma. A coffee, almost espresso, taste with a smidge of chocolate. It was thin and a little more bitter than I would have liked. An OK stout, lots of better ones out there."
"Good drinkability and good flavor. Enjoyable."
"A little thin in the mouth, goes down smooth enough... Mouth left a bit dry."
"D - Not bad. Could use a longer boil perhaps or more complex malts."
"It could use more intensity in the taste and this one would be so great. Not a bad beer, more like a session stout."
"Picked up a single from The Party Source in Syracuse. Appeared pitch black with a tall tan head that left lacing. I have to say this is my favorite beer from Shipyard. The Ringwood makes a great pairing with the roast malts, coffee bean, and dry cocoa flavors. Check this beer out, it's a great addition to the style and very worthy session beer."
"D: I'm only starting to enter the world of stouts, but I was really impressed by this one. A very good, non-overbearing dry Irish stout that would probably make a good entry-level stout for anyone else in the same boat."
"Drinkability: Low ABV stouts make it easy for a beginner BA to enjoy the flavors of a well crafted beer, and this one is a perfect entry beer. Shipyard packs great flavors, balanced correctly, with a nice light body that won't weigh you down and can easily throw back more then 2. Very sessionable and I really enjoyed this. Not the best stout I've had by far but a hell of a good one if you want more then one in a sitting."
"Off the nitro-tap at the Maine brewery this beer was a opaque black color. The tan head retained excellently as a cap and left outstanding, Guinness-like lacing. The aroma was... where? Hints of dry roasted malt was the most I got. The flavors were better but still unimpressive. Roasted malt, hints of coffee and a touch of sourness. Dry and rather one-dimensional. The mouthfeel was watery, the body full and the carbonation delicate. Putting it on nitro-tap surely made it better but having tried this before I was much less impressed with it this time."
"Pours a black color, nice carbonation, huge three-finger plus foamy light tan head, with tons of sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some nice toffee/chocolate notes, also some coffee thrown in. The taste is slightly sweet, lots of dark stuff. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty brew."
"Less than impressed. Poured a clear black-brown with a creamy off-white head. Nearly no lacing. Faint aroma of chocolate and milk, malty, but not roasty. Watery, thin mouthfeel, even for the style. Taste was equally thin. Cocoa powder and watery milk, no real bite as expected. It was missing something big-time in terms of flavor. Either more chocolate or cream, but lacking all around."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of dry coffee with not much else in term of discernable characteristics. Taste is also very dry with some coffee notes and limited roasted malt notes appearance. Body is about average with goo carbonation. I thought that overall this was too dry which limited the drinkability factor."
"D - Nice dark coffee-stout. It does not stand out among stouts, but is a fine beer."
"Mouthfeel taste very.. fresh. If that's a way to describe mouthfeel. A great, straight from a brewpub like texture."
"The tap made this brew shine and would parallel any import dry stout coming from an American brewer. Spot on for an Irish stout and just enough creaminess and hop resin to remind you it's American."
"D - Very drinkable. This is a classic session stout and comes with a bonus. The smell and taste outdoes the other dry stouts in my opinion. I don't get a waft of coffee like this from others."
"Poured near black, with a tan head and lacing that lasted. And that was about the only upside to this selection. The nose was toffee-like and buttery - the diacetyl from the ringwood shined through even the roastiest of their beers. The taste was roasty and chocolatey, a little bit of black licorice, followed by buttery popcorn. The mouthfeel was average for a dry stout, but the diacetyl cut the drinkability short."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but not too bad. Drinkability is pretty good. One of the better Irish stouts I've had."
"D- Light bodied and a low ABV, this was definitely brewed with drinkability in mind, rather than flavor."
"Not a bad beer overall, but not the best of it's kind. Probably wouldn't seek out again, but I will enjoy the rest in the sampler pack I found."
"Drinkability: Fairly average for the style. Turning the second glass into an ice cream float."
"I have had much better stout. It smells like a dry stout with a hint of sweetness but also like burnt coffee. The bitterness is astringent and not unlike burnt coffee . There is a hint of sweetness and hops. The palate is average. This one needs some more time in dry dock."
"Drinkability is nice on this beer and is almost forced on you. Every sip I take is so dry at the end that it leaves me thirsty for another sip. I am not a huge fan of dry stouts, but I think this is a great example of the style. Shipyard generally does a good job with different styles and I think they fit the dry stout right on."
"Smooth and oily. Medium thickness, but easy drinkin'. A very solid stout. Wait for it to warm and pour it slowly."
"Not a bad stout but not a great one either. Won't go out of my way to have this again. Probably a lot better on tap?"
"This is a great beer. I wish I bought more than the 22oz bottle. I also had it on draft at Federal Jack's in Kennebunk, ME. It tastes just as good out of the bottle."
"D: Drinkabilty is good, I guess I do say that about almost all beers I review, but this one does go down easy and its very sessionable. The thin mouthfeel and subdued flavor allow it to dissappear quickly, but at the same time doesn't leave much of a lasting memory."
"Pours black with a big tan head that dissipates very quickly leaving no lacing. Smell is big on roasted malts and not much else. The taste is pretty much the same and one-dimensional with roasted malts. Mouthfeel is a little thin for me but OK. This is actually a very drinkable dry stout but there's not a lot going on with it."
"Pours a black color with a relatively thick tan head but doesn't stick around very long and there's just a few spots of lacing. Roasted malt aroma but not very strong. It tastes rather burned, creamy, with malts. Aftertaste is a bit sour and bitter. I've had far better stouts but it's drinkable."
"Surprisingly decently drinking stout found by MarkB at the co-op in Burlington Vermont. Pours black with malt in aroma. Balanced, and not as dry, and decent balance of roast and malt and a bit of chocolate, all at sessionable ABV. Bottle..finished before lunch begins."
"Note: Was a 22oz bomber, not a 12oz bottle."
"D: This beer kind of surprised me, was a little better then I thought. Found it enjoyable and would have another."
"I guess if you are in the swillin' mood, you could knock a couple back. I say -- Why waste your time with another. Not gonna buy this one again."
"Taste is rich, roasted malt with some dark chocolate or mocha tastes. The carbonation is definitely very strong in the mouth, not sure if this bottle was just shaken up or something but the carbonation is much more than expected in a stout. I've had this on nitro out on Peaks Island a number of times and really enjoyed its smoothness. I think I prefer that quite a bit over the bottled version."
"Pours almost black with a one finger plus tan head. Good retention, and a nice lacing. Aroma is of roasted malts,and chocolate. Body is medium,with some carbonation. Taste is of roasted coffee,and dark chocolate. Nicely bittered finish. Not bad at all!"
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a very dry and roasted malt scent that boasts of special roast and chocolate malts. The taste is good as well. It is light and quite dry with a lovely roasted character. It's an easy drinker, but it doesn't lack in taste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a near perfect Irish stout. I love the flavor and the mouthfeel; a really enjoyable beer."
"Poured blacker than black with a decent brown head that fades very quickly. Barely discernable hop and roasted/burnt malt on the nose. The flavor starts off with some bittersweet dark chocolate and tons of coffee. Fades slowly into a very nice coffee flavor that has a lingering finish. Somewhat thin for a stout but very drinkable. Average across the board."
"Shipyard makes has a good line of tasty brews and being a dark beer I am always loving a good stout. I enjoyed this in my Warsteiner mug. Poured a deep dark brown. Nose had a pleasant scent of roasted malts, some bittersweet chocolate. Taste of sweet roasted malt but not too overpowering. The bittering hops do a good job of toning it down. Served slightly chilled."
"Here we have an easy drinking offering, with low alcohol. Though not too complex, it is not boring either. There is no need to contemplate this one, so it makes for a decent session beer."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew filled the glass quick with a huge brown head (much more than necessary) and was deep dark brown touching on black. The smell was of dominant burnt malt and some hints of chocolate and some light floral notes from hops. The taste is over taken by carbonation and this beer is too thin, in my opinion, for a stout. The taste is of burnt sugar and some slight bitter chocolate. Not exactly what I was expecting, but the beer has some character. Maybe good for someone who wishes to have some traits of a darker brew with a lighter body."
"D- I ended up doing something I never do: I poured it out after about half. Just couldn't stand it."
" This is a heavy and smooth session beer, 4.7 % means you can kick back a few without being dragged out of the bar by your buddies!! Pair with any chocolate desert or smoked meats."
"Good stout if you want something different than the usual suspects"
"Travelers, take note: if you're close to Portland and can get a really fresh one, any Shipyard (pronounced colloquially as ""Ship-yAHd"") brew ain't bad at all. This particular one was so surprisingly good it inspired my first review! Cheers!"
"This is a pretty good stout, it's definitely an eye opener."
"Not overly sweet, strong on the coffee taste which gives it a bit too much bitterness. Carbonation is overwhelming though and for a stout it's a little too thin."
"drinkability  Very nice stout, dirty dirty was the first thing that came out of mouth when I took a look at it, smelled it , and then drank it. Very good beer, would buy again."
"D: Take it or leave it. Nothing special but still drinkable."
"Drinkability: Eh... Like I said, left me a bit wanting. An OK stout, but nothing too special in my opinion."
"Excellent beer! Pours black from the bottle with a caramel colored head so thick it takes a while to settle. The smell is excellent. Very sweet almost chocolatey aroma. The taste is exceptional! Very dark and smokey but very sweet and a hint of chocolate aftertaste. Very good stout, well worth the price. Go pick up a 6 of these so you're ready for the cold winter nights."
"Drinkability: A very impressive root beer!"
"where is the balance and quality control?"
"This one is too watery to make it a keeper. It's not bad, but the alcohol content is low enough that Shipyard could easily bulk it up to say 5.5% and give it a richer flavor while maintaining it's drinkability and keeping it a dry stout for warmer weather."
"Dark brown color with a decent brown head. Aroma is very strong and brings about roasty notes that have some chocolate to them. Taste is much of the same. Roasty at first and then fades into a nice aftertaste that coats the tongue. Hints of roasted coffee follow with a dryness not unheard of for the style. A second sip confirms more chocolate and coffee notes and a decent dryness. I really love the aftertaste. Pretty darn good for an Irish Dry Stout. I'm thinking the Guinness Extra Stout is better though but this one is quite close."
"Pours a five finger brown head that fades quickly to a ring leaving traces of lace. Totally black color. Light-medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Roasted chocolate nose. Flavor is roasted chocolate, bakers chocolate finish; not a really dry stout like Guinness. $1.50 for a 12oz bottle from Capitol Convenience Concord, NH."
"I was completely disappointed with this one, the excessive ""burnt"" characteristics just ruined it for me."
"Very easy to drink but not not very rewarding flavor-wise."
"Had this at Federal Jack's in Kennebunkport Maine. Nitro into a 16oz standard pint glass. Arrived at the table still cascading with a half inch of thick dense creamy head. Aroma has a hint of the ringwood yeast which is of caramel and a little banana. Taste is more of the same with a perfect blend of aromatic and bittering hops. There are the usual coffee mocha dark chocolate flavors that keep this stout true to style. Blue Fin is a must try on nitro tap and Federal Jack's does a great job of serving this beer. If it seems a little cold, enjoy it while holding the glass and it will warm nicely to open up deeper mocha flavors as well as summon the complex blend of bittering and aroma hops. A great New England stout that doesn't quite achieve in the bottle(big bubble soda-like carbonation) what it does from a nitro tap(creamy fine bubbles with a luscious mouthfeel)."
"I only had one bottle, and it was tasty, but I think it may be a bit much to have a few in a session."
"Drinkability- One of these is plenty for me, not somthing you would want many of."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, slightly filling, good representation of style, it’s definitely one of the better beers that I’ve had within the style. I could knock back a few of these even though I normally don’t this type of beer."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark black color with a tan head. The aroma consists largely of dark roasted malts. The taste much like the aroma is dark and roasty with a dry and mildly bitter finish. Overall, this is a pretty solid offering that I wouldn't pass up if offered again. Not bad."
"I bought the beer for a get together and I was interested in what it tasted like. After trying it I could definely get the bitter, dark chocolate taste that everyone is talking about. Overall through I did like the beer and it was one of those beers that one shouldget if they are just going to sit around and have a conversation. If you're going to get drunk, I wouldn't get it. But for conversation beer, it does its job."
"This beer poured black with a very thick brown colored head. The aroma is coffee like with a touch of sourness. The taste is coffee and malt perhaps a hint of chocolate. It finishes bitter and sweet. The mouthfeel is full and carbonated. Overall, this is a tasty beer which Id recommend  however, due to its robust flavor, one may be enough for a single sitting."
"Light body considering the strong coffee taste. Couldn't drink more that one unless for breakfast after a rough night."
"Drinkability: A pretty tasty stout , nice roasty flavors and chocolate taste , just a touch to bitter and thin for me to want to quaff."
"Pours pitch black with a two finger thick, fluffy dark tan head. Head retention is decent, lacing is spotty. Nice roasty, malty aroma with hints of dark chocolate. Roasted barley, chocolate and coffee are the dominat flavors. I can also detect a hint of hops and some bitterness derived from the chocolate/coffee flavors in the finish. Mouthfeel is ok, medium in body but too highly carbonated by the style. Drinkability is good. I find the weak point to be the overcarbonation. Otherwise this is a good session stout."
"I'm not sure what to think of it. It was quite the adventure just to get it all in the pint glass, and it is mild & dry per the style, but it seems like the obscene amount of carbonation takes away from the taste. Unlike most stouts that usually respond & open up as they warm this seemed to withdraw, surrender. It was easy to drink, but the finish on both the aftertaste and end of the pint are what I'm remembering as far as the taste, and neither were very enjoyable. I'd like to give this one another shot, preferably on tap to really give it a fair shake, but until I get that chance I'll persue other stouts in its place. Its OK, but there are far better examples to be had."
"Pours totally black with a small beige head that did not last long. The smell is rich with roasted malt and has some sweetness to it. The taste is roasted malt and coffee with a mild, dry bitterness at the end. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, creamy and some tingly carbonation. Drinkability is good as this goes down quite easily. Overall, a nice, easy-drinking stout."
"Pours a huge head that has to subside before I can pour enough to drink, this be due to the fact that it was closer to cellar temperature. There is a muted but dark almond/syrupy hue to the head, not at all white. In the light the beer is dark with reddish tints. Aroma is stout and roasty, american hops, and mostly hops, but some roasted aromas coming though, smells rather good. Taste is sweet and a big creamy, but less so than a milk stout. The finish is roasty and porter like without much harshness, not quite smooth and non-threatening, enough roast to be hearty but not so much to think ""charred."" The taste here is neither monochromatic (think guinness) nor ultra complex, but right in the middle, and this is a good thing. Mouthfeel is full bodied but more acidic than I'd like. There was yeasty sediment at the bottom of the glass so this may not be ultra filtered and that is a positive. Overall this is very drinkable beer, it would be a more of a winner if the sweetness was tamed a tad, so after a pint, the rest of the bomber wasn't so easy to finish, but it was rather tasty brew, and surprising as shipyard is not my favorite brewery by any stretch of the imagination. I'd buy this again."
"Beer is black as night and poured a big tan head initially that is sustaining quite well. Nose is malty with a slight hint of coffee. Taste is a nice blend of malts, coffee, slight hint of chocolate, and dry bittering hops. Mouthfeel is very creamy and medium bodied. Overall drinkability is very good. This is another very good effort by this brewery. Definitely a must for stout fans."
"Poured black as night with a thick beige/tan head that slowly disappeared. Left a thin head that remained the entire course or the beer. Smelled of toffee, coffee, and chocolate. Tastes match the smells, with a bitterness rounding it out. Nice creamy feel with fine carbonation. Good stout, not too sweet, not too chocolatey"
"The head disappear quickly and showed little evidence that it existed. A very coffee smell. The is lots of smokiness in this stout, with a much more coffee flavor than a rich chocolate flavor. The carbonation seems high for a stout and feels like much larger bubbles than in other stouts I have drank. This is the most over powering characteristic to the mouthfeel which tends to brighten the smoky and darker flavors."
"Overall: A great looking stout with a nice coffee/bitter flavor, though average nose & body. Recommended."
"Pours as black as can be, with a huge, fluffy, dark tan head that dissipates fairly quickly to dusting and a ring. The aroma is relatively mild, with some nice smells that don't have the volatility to make them really sing. What is there: coffee, bananas, faint diacetyl. On the tongue, there's an initial hop bitterness that bites on the tongue, followed by a move toward the middle of the tongue, where some diacetyl and sweet/sour stout malts come out. Some fruits come out toward the end, with the finish being a bit sticky; it only dries out a little bit. Mouthfeel features voluminous carbonation, a bit of hop acid, and an active finish. Overall, this is a very nice stout; one of the better Irish dry stouts that is available in my area of the country. It's not terribly complex, but that's partially a feature of the style. Definitely worth a try, and if stouts are your thing, worth a session's worth of drinking."
"RE-RATE: Mostly black body with slight ruby-red highlights around the edges. Very thin tan head. Roasty malty scent. Tastes roasty and sweet, some chocolate notes. Some hop bitterness present too, but very subdued. Tastes better than I remember. Im not a big Shipyard fan in general, but this is probably one of their better offerings. Try their Brewers choice and Prelude."
"D: Very drinkable, quality session brew."
"Blue Fin Stout pours an opaque black with a fluffy tan head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. I tried looking for ruby highlights, but I just don't see any. Mild coffee aroma is present. Some chocolate and coffee flavors are noticeable in the taste. Roasted malt definitely dominates. Overall, not bad, kind of a good entry level stout in my opinion, but doesn't really hold up against the best stouts. Definitely worth a try."
"The body is a little light. I want more substance. The drinkability is good. This is a lighter stout, if that is possible. Nothing special."
"D - high, another great High Seas member, those Clipper City gents know what they're doin'"
"Pours a stoutly black with a few fingers of coffee brown, rocky head. Nose is dominated by roasted coffee and bitter, charred malt. Taste is predominantly bitter, with a lingering coffee/char aftertaste. Mouthfeel is on the thin side but this is an Irish Dry, so not too far off. Smells like a nice mocha but the flavor is laking a chocolate sweetness to round out the charred bitterness. Solid but unspectacular."
"D  Smoother and lighter than I recalled. Must've drowned those beer cells over the years. Definitely a nice easy drinking stout. Guinness is easier to find, but this is tastier if you can get it."
"Drinkability: Fairly drinkable, the light body helps with this, as does the creamy taste."
"Overall this a very good beer and an excellent value at $2.69 for a 22 oz bomber. However, it pales in comparison to some of the other fine stouts out there as far as taste, but at least it looks amazing."
"Notes: A very nice offering. I prefer more flavorful varieties of stout (RIS, American Double etc) to dry stouts but this one has enough flavor to make it very interesting. A nice beer to relax and sip, yet a low enough ABV to sit down with for a session without regretting it the next morning."
"I poured this beer from a 22 oz. bottle into a schooner glass producing a nice gurgling head thats really grabs the sides of the glass. The color is a beautiful deep black coffee color with a dark root beer tint where the light reaches it. The stout has a prominent chocolate smell almost as if you are driving by a chocolate factory. The taste, as the smell is very mocha with hints of coffee. A mouthful is quite delicious the flavor seems very consistent mocha all the way down. The aftertaste continues chocolatey and the hops start to come through getting a bit sweeter. The carbonation seems just right for the flavor. Not at all heavy for a stout, don't have to strain it through my teeth. I will enjoy the rest of these."
"Pours a jet black color with a two finger head the dissipates to about a half finger. Smells of caramel and chocolate greet your nose. Tastes different than I expected it too. Very fizzy for a stout, but I like the fizziness, and finishes smooth with a coffee flavor, but also leaves a hint of a taste of milk or almost like an irish cream, and I mean it's very subtle."
"I recommend opening this and letting it sit in your fridge for 47 days to get most of the carbonation out. You'll then find it a tasty stout."
"Blue Fin Stout has a smallish head,one finger,that is lacey,and a dark black coffee look.This has a lighter taste than most stout,but it is also more refreshing than most.It tastes almost like half a Coke, iced coffee,and a carbonated water mixture.Its not bad ,but its different.After sitting for about 10 minutes there was still alot of carbonation.This is a easy drinking stout and a nice offering from Shipyard.But its too easy and I like a stout with alittle more bite with taste and alc.This is way too light and carbonated for a stout."
"A kind of sporadic stout, and solid overall. I'd get it again."
"Tasted: 08/04/05"
"one of the better shipyard brews. yummy, well-balanced, very enjoyable stout. i need to try this on tap!"
"Creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Medium in body. nice long coffee and roasted malt finish. One of the better Shipyard brews."
"The first Shipyard brew that I drank (Summer Ale) was pretty decent. The last two, including this one, leave quite a bit to be desired. I'm a little curious about the rest of their line, but not curious enough to go to great lengths to try to acquire them. Blue Fin Stout isn't my thing. If light-bodied stouts are your thing, then by all means, knock yourself out."
"Whoa, poured that jet black elixir too hard, big ol tan head jumped up at me. Aromas out of the glass were nice roasted, malty chocolate. Even stronger roasted taste that finished well balance with the hop. Good texture and carbonation tang. Only had 1, wish I had another 2 or 3. Noticed on the label that its made in Orlando also (besides Portland), will try to look up some down there during a baseball spring training trip."
"Next to the Old Thumper and Winter Ale in my book of Shipyard preferences."
"The brew is a pitch-black beer, almost no light let through at all. Massive dark brown head results after a nice cascade show. Nice roasted chocolate malt scent. Roasted malts come through as chocolate and coffee, some bittering hop in the background. Medium bodied, fairly highly carbonated. Overall pretty good."
"Dark brown black in color, small, slightly creamy, gingerbread tan colored head. Smell is of dark chocolate strong coffee, and mucho hops. The taste is very dry, with bitter coffee and hops combining to make a smooth, yet intense taste. Mouthfeel is fairly thin, but offset by a perfect amount of carbonation. Good drinkability and reasonably priced."
"The beer poured a very dark brown--almost black--in color and had a rather weak head that went away fairly quickly. The wafting aroma was of dark chocolate. The beer's flavor was ot first heavy in smoke, but then after tones of malt, chocolate and coffee came through in the taste. Hints of semi-sweet hops were also present. There was a bit more carbonation than I was expecting, but not unpleasantly so."
"Drinkability  This is a really good beer that would be great if they had better control over the carbonation."
"Dark black color, huge foamy off-white head that leaves a sticky lacing in my glass, roasty chocolate-coffee aromas. Roasted burnt chocolate coffee flavors, nice bitter-sweet flavors, good roasted bitterness in the finish. Light to medium body with a semi watery mouthfeel, pretty nice."
"Medium-full bodied."
"Jet black and opaque. Head settles into a steadfast, tight, dark tan layer that leaves sparse lace. Dark roast coffee with a sweet, milky, mocha tinge upfront in aroma. As the beer breathes, spicy, peppery esters with an earthy hop twang arise. Welcoming aromawise. In flavor, incipient is milk chocolate sweetness, which is promptly contrasted by a combination of roasted barley and hop bitterness. More fruity than most dry stouts, with notes of tart plum adding depth. Smoky, almost peaty hints surface after a deliberation. Lightly bodied and true to form in its dryness. Roasted grain acidity augments over time, complementing plum esters. Finishes acceptly tart initially, but fades into lingering bitter coffee and dark chocolate hints. A very respectable dry stout with unique fruit character. Would make a fine session brew."
"Brief hops, mild, then smooth malt, slight chocolate, minor espresso-ish tones, just smoothness all along. Cocoa stands on top as a cheif flavor, but the carbonation is still too high for me, and, ultimately, this stout lacks an essential mark of character. It feels too underwhelming, too easy-to-please, too low-expectations,...the carbonation clashes with whatever else the beer was trying to be...it could be smoother, could be stronger, could be bolder...but can't...too bad..."
"Not a hard beer to drink, but not really worth drinking."
"This is a good stout. I've had better, and I've had a lot worse. An almost picture-perfect example of the style. The shipyard makes quality brews and this is just another in their line up. Nothing really stands out on this one though, which is why I couldn't give it any higher of a score, but I will absolutely come back to this one from time to time."
"A very nice stout, exactly what I expect from one."
"The aromas are very nice as can sense fruit, roasted malt and a nice floral hop. The taste is of chocolate with a lighter coffee and malt presence. A hop taste finishes the brew very nicely. Has a huge amount of carbonation, maybe a bit too much. Over all a very nice brew from the Shipyard, I do feel that it should be a bit heavier for this type of brew!"
"ng"
"Prost"
"Pours nicely black with a large, airy, light brown head. The head fade gradually, pitting first, and finally dissipating into a thick rick around the edges of the glass and a thin film of brown bubbles across the surface. There's something a little strange about the aroma. It's almost pear-like and something, maybe butterscotch or toffee. The flavor is clean. Coffee, chocolate. A really short finish. A little thin on the tongue."
"Poured this almost black beer into a liter mug and it created a nice nut brown lid of froth. Head stayed around although with minimal lacing. Smell was faint but delivered a deep roasted coffee and chocolate. Roasted malts abound with a nice delivery of hops at the finish. This beer needs some warming.Too cold and everything is hidden.Get it right below the condensation point (typical glassware) and it really wakes up.Nice, balanced stout."
"Pours a deep brown/black with a off white creamy head that leaves some nice lacing,aroma was very coffeeish and nutty.Taste was highly roasted and lightly chocolaty,the roasted malt flavor lingered after swallowing.A good beer definently not a wimpy tasting stout in my mind."
"Thanks to BierReise for the trade. This beer pours a very dark brown (almost black) with a medium dark beige head. Thin lacing. Strong roasted coffee aroma with a hint of malt as well. Moderately dry with coffee dominating the flavor. There is a subtle roasted malt and smoky character in the flavor as well. The finish is lightly bitter hops. Solid."
"Wow, what an appearance! Perfect for the style-nearly black with an awesome, luxuriously creamy, light brown head that stayed at the 1/2 inch mark throughout, the first sip imparting a creamy stout stache. The lace was a work of art. Aromas were tough to get hold of as they were blocked by the fine head, but soft espresso and roasted bean were present. The mouthfeel was perfect-full-bodied yet soft and very creamy. The carbonation was very fine and subtle. The taste was fantastic! Creamy, milky chocolate and bittersweet mocha-like the freshest, richest cream added to a very fine coffee. Long and roasted in the mouth, it don't get much better-Guiness Schminess!!"
"Deep and mysterious opaque jet black, medium head of tan creamy foam on a vigorous pour. Good retention and very nice lace. Light chocolate aroma, a nice touch of slight berry. Lighter bodied and more carbonated than I expected, the mouthfeel is a little ragged and the flavor straightforward with a standard dry java impression. The appearance and aroma got my expectations higher than the taste delivered, but not a bad beer."
"Super duper deep black, pretty much opaque, large tan head that sticks around for the most part and leaves much lace. Aroma of strongly roasted malt (dark black coffee), very slight floral hop presence in the background. Flavor starts with strong espresso, middle has a mild fruitiness to it, end has small amounts of hops. Medium-full body, very slight carbonation. An extremely tasty, easy drinking stout that is now a staple in my beer fridge."
"Would I have another?...you bet, but there are better local options IMHO."
"A faithful and flavorful dry irish stout. I'd take this one over many others."
"Tasted very thin and creamy. Tastes of malt, semi-sweet chocolate, and nitro. Why do they think they have to nitro a stout? Very light for a stout. The nitro give it a light, fluffy, creamy texture. I think it takes away from it, but I've never tasted it without it so I don't know for sure. Not a bad stout, but I've had better. Much, much better."
"All in all a very solid dom. stout. Recommended vs. Beamish, Guiness and the rest. Enjoy!"
"Jet black with a rocky, dark tan head leaving a little bit of lace. Smell was bountiful with notes of toffee, roasted barley and heavy raisins and prunes. Taste was a little thin bodied, but roasty malts, coffee and burnt currants coupled with sweet vinous and caramel flavors and a sharp hop profile in the finish helped keep this beer on track. The carbonation was not overly aggressive and the mouthfeel was plesant for a darker beer in the summer time. Very good selection for any situation."
"Overall, a good Maine stout."
"This is a nice stout, all the way. Good balance, nice chocolate-expresso flavors. Pours a large foamy head, nice retention and lacing. Nothing totally stands out, but nothing detracts either. Maybe a tad thin for the style, but a real nice beer, nonetheless. (thanks for sharing it, Ron)."
"Great stout from a consistent brewer. Deep brown color with a nice creamy head that scantily laces the glass and dissapates very slowly. Aroma is all coffee and bitter chocolate. Flavor is very balanced with nice chocolate and coffee notes. Finishes on the dry side. Excellent stout."
"Mmmm. Didn't know what to expect, but this was good. Deep dark borwn with a light brown head about 2 inches high made up of tight, identical, symmetrical bubbles. Light malt smell and even lighter hops highlights. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, but tingly at the finish. Flavor is immediae burnt malt, with hints of bitter chocolate and toffee, and a hops finish. The finish lingers and morphs into a sweet malt flavor. A bit of effervescence on the tongue, and an aftertaste of burnt mutmeg. Very nice."
"Rich dark appearance....The smell was rich in chocolate and coffee aromas. The taste was smooth, with a bite of black coffee. The mouthfeel was smooth with a hint of the aftertaste you get from black coffee. It felt well-rounded with a nice medium body. Smooth and drinkable, a cross between a sip and a gulp. If you like coffee, you should try this offering."
"I have to say this is a decent stout but I've definately had better."
"Interesting stout. I liked it, didn't love it. Impenetrable black with full head from a strong pour, head subsides but leaves great lacing. Incredibly fruity aroma, some burnt roastiness too. Flavor contains a big black malt kick, some coffee, burnt toast, caramel, and raisin flavors. Hops add a smoky, herbal element, give the beer a nice earthy kick. A severe fruitiness is introduced by the yeast (Ringwood, I presume) and I have to say it overpowers the beer and isn't quite right for the style. A nice impy stout or Baltic porter often has some fruit elements, raisins, figs, plums, but here it doesn't quite work with the coffee roastiness. This beer has real potential but the yeast tweaks it in a way that I'm not wild about. Mouthfeel a bit fizzy, not the session stout I was hoping for; one of these at the end of the day makes a fine restorative, but I didn't reach for a second."
"Blue Fin poured a solid black with a decent tan head that held for a few minutes. The nose is very slight, tiny hints of roasty coffee and cocoa. The first sip really left me impressed, a totally unexpected burst of smooth mocha - reminded me of one of those starbucks doubleshot coffee drinks. A little high in carbonation, but nonetheless a top quality brew from a reliable brewery."
"Thanks much cokes."
"A black beer that pours with a modest head the color of wet sand that fades to a minimal film. Adequate lacing on the glass. The aroma is very sweet and fruity, like chocolate covered cordials, with a touch of roasted coffe and malt. Very appetizing to say the least. The taste is strong on roasted coffee up front, with some sweetness and a nice hop bitterness late. A very nice roasted note comes through on the finish a lingers well through the aftertatse. Very good, but perhaps a bit too much roastiness on the finish. The mouthfeel is solid and very dry. Not my favorite (I prefer Imperials), but good for the style. The drinakbility is good, especially if you like coffee. The high levels of roasted coffee in the flavor and finish are enjoyable."
"Straight 4's here.Probably one of the best beers Shipyard puts out.Poured a beige coffee colored head.Quick to dissolve and didnt last long retaining a small thin head.The color was an opaque solid black.Had a great aroma of smoke and coffee.The finish was dry,long,and bitter.A very creamy and smooth Stout.Crisp and carbonated mouthfeel but nothing too strong and overwhelming.A hint of hops on the finish if you concentrate.Overall very good and worth another buy."
"The appearance was impressive, very black with a nice brown head. I smelled roasted grains and coffee. The taste was dominated by the roasted grains and some bitterness. I'm rather new to stouts and the dark roasted grains got to be too stong by the time I finished the glass. Give me some time and I think I'll start to love this one."
"Drinkability: Pretty high. This stout is quite good, and I could see myself drinking a few more of these. The coffee flavor is quite aggressive...and I like that."
"Decent."
"Pours black with a huge tan head that lasted. Malty, chocolaty and very bright. Tons of carbonation as it explodes in the mouth. I might even go as far as saying over-carbonated. The aftertaste is coffee and chocolate all the way. I need to have another bottle of this to get a better grip on it."
"Dark, black, sun-blocking. Average head. Good tasting, plenty of ""roasted"" taste, with a semi-sweet sensation. Always good on tap, not so in the bottle. A good stout, but not superior. I can only handle one or two."
"Damned tasty stout, seemed maybe a bit over-carbonated at first, well worth drinking more of it."
"On tap @ Federal Jack's in Kennebunkport. Pleasing deep dull black color. Foamy tan head matched nicely. Lacing was near perfection, rich creamy head stuck to your lips, glass, and everything else. Smell was subtle roasted chocolate malt and coffee bitterness. Taste was super smooth combination of the same, and crisp dry hoppy finish, as advertised. Chocolate taste is by no means over powering. Very good. One of my new all time favorite stouts. I bought 4 22 oz bombers for $1.50 each and carried them home to Florida. Great beer, great name, beautiful souvenier of my trip to Maine."
"Pours a dark, rich mahogany with a dense brown head that dissipates but leaves a sticky lace on the glass. First impression is of bitter chocolate and burnt grain and heavily roasted malts with a bit of an oily hop resin on the back of the mouth. Definitely a dry style without the body and sweetness of a sweet stout. More guts than a Guiness, but lacks the depth of the full bodied examples of the style. Leave it warm a bit to improve it's flavor profile."
"Pours blacker than black with a decent brown head that fades very quickly.  Barely discernable hop and roasted/burnt malt on the nose.  The flavor starts off with some bittersweet dark chocolate and tons of coffee.  Fades slowly into a very nice coffee flavor that has a lingering finish.  Somewhat thin for a stout but very drinkable.  Not a bad stout but not a super one either.  Thanks to the Bierman for the sample."
"Notes: Forget American Guinness ... this is a far better stout, better when on tap as the bottle tasted too filtered to me."
"An awesome US made stout. In the inevitable comparison to Guinness, this one doesn't give away a thing."
