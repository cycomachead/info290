"Would purchase again if I was here and in the mood for a stout. Otherwise, I am going with the Batch 1000."

"Definitely a decent beer I would drink again. Color is a very dark thick brown, almost black. 1"" light caramel color head that dissipated slowly over about 5 minutes and left thin lacing. Smell was chocolate with some fruity elements. Texture was very thick and almost creamy, which made it seem sweeter than it actually was. Taste had overarching chocolate tones, with nutty, sweet malt, elements of coffee and a dry citrus aftertaste. Very low carbonation."

"Overall - not a bad stout, flavors are there but watered down"

"The oats make this beer flow smoothly, as intended. The body is big enough for a stout. I would tone down the crispness just a notch."

"Had on tap in Madison, WI in March 2013. This pours a dark brown color with a creamy light brown head. There is a sweet malt scent. The texture is pretty thin and light that is sweet, creamy with hints of cocoa. It’s fairly decent given the company as it compares pretty similar to Guinness. Tried it once, but probably not going to try again."

"In summary a nice refreshing stout. I enjoy drinking this baby with the music of the Cranberries playing ""Linger"" from the cd Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?"

"O - This is a nice version of an Irish Dry Stout."

"Served as part of an eight beer sampler at GC in SLP, MN. Pour was black in color with a half finger of medium tan head. Weak aroma of dark, roast malt and oats. Taste was roasted malt, faint, faint coffee and chocolate, oats, grain. Body and mouthfeel were watery and light. Carbonation was adequate. Overall this is absolutely an entry level stout not far removed from ye olde classic Guinness (but for Guinness has a far superior body and mouthfeel)."

"GC did a pretty good job on their stout. The beer poured a nice rich black hue. Very tall tan head that exhibied that laced slightly. The initial scent can carry soy sauce aroma, but then the toasted malt and coffee come to fruition. The taste included roasted and nice coffee with very mild chocolate. The stout carried a medium in body, so so carbonation, a bit of dryness in the finish. Overall a decent stout. Probably second favorite."
"Poured black, but a watered down looking black. Nice 1 inch head that lingered on and on. Weak smells of coffee, some chocolate, and some malt. Tasted like a watered down under carbonated root beer. A bit of licorice, malt, some roasts, and just the slightest sweet chocolate. Mouthfeel was extremely light, just slightly carbonated, and very thin. Overall, I'll never get this again. It's almost undrinkable due to the very thin mouthfeel."
"T, M.The bittering is well-balanced with what little sweetness there is in this brew...It's just that, everything from the flavor, nose, and body seems overly thin and watery. Everything is in the right place, but unplugged. It needs amplification. It makes me wonder if the problem is that my palate is becoming jaded from too many ""big beers"" or if the problem is merely that this beer is only average in quality."
"D: Good, nice mild little stout. Michael can't thank you enough for thinking of me during your travels."
"37 IBU's. just FYI"
"Overall, this isn't a bad beer for what it is. It reminds me a lot of a guiness, but a bit better. It is very easy to drink if you want a lighter flavored stout. I had no problem finishing my mug."
"Pours a black color. One inch head of a pale an color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, slight pale hop. Fits the style of an Irish Dry Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average to low carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, slight sweet malt, and pale hops. Overall, a decent beer, but lacking in body and aroma."
"Another perfectly average beer from Granite City. They don't like to go out on limbs or take any chances. Not bad, not great."
"The mouth is soft yet a bit thin. Not a repeater for me."
"Drink: A smooth old brew for anyone interested, including those nae-saying bar patrons that insist that they ""don't like dark beer."" To them I say, well, try this one 'cause it is entirely drinkable."
"Dark black with a creamy head an decent retention. Smell is not real strong, but I could pick up some coffee and a bit of chocolate. The flavor is also light coffee and chocolate. Nothing extraordinary, but decent. Creamy, medium bodied, decent drinkability."
"D- This is I think maybe their best offering from their year around beers. Still nothing special but an easy drinker nevertheless."
"Overall: This beer, in my opinion, is the best offering this location has to offer. Well balanced, great malt profile, mildly hopped, carbonated just right...I think we have a winner. Good work."
"Draft at Cedar Rapids. With not too many micros to choose from in Iowa, I hate to knock any stout effort too strongly, but there's just nothing remarkable about this beer. I do drink it fairly often because we frequent this location. Aroma and flavor are somewhat bland. Not unpleasant, just not much of it."
"D-Solid, albeit lacking aroma and body. Easy to drink and tasty enough to enjoy my 20 oz. pour. This one will not rock your world but...hey, it's North Dakota!"
"Nothing really to brag about, but I'd have another. Appearance is average dark dark brown with some head. Smell is weak but there exists hints of bitter chocolate and coffee. Possibly some slight hops as well. Taste is more of the same but they are more prevalent. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good."
"Dark black in color with a creamy one finger head that stays due to the nitro tap. Small faints of roasted coffee is all I can get. Taste was a let down. Very lacking in flavor, only decent flavor that comes through is the roasted coffee. this was a very watery stout and definately needs more flavor."
"Overall - Good beer, the sourness diminished toward the end of the glass. Not the best stout I have had, but OK."
"Sample at the Super Terrific Stout Tasting on 02/16/08. Pours nearly black with a thin light brown head that disappears quickly. Minimal lacing is evident. Mild roasted coffee and malt in the nose. Medium, slick body with roasted coffee, malt and chocolate flavors. The finish is fairly thin for a Stout and has a coffee aftertaste plus a hint of hops. Below average overall."
"Man, did this beer look good when it came it. Great head, nice dark color. However, after the smell, things kind of went downhill. It smelled fainlty of coffee and some chocolate. It tasted like it smelled, however kind of watery with malty aftertaste. It had a very thin mouthfeel and went down slickly. Overall, not my favorite stout, but could see myself ordering it again in the future."
"Drinkability: A drinkable beer. One of there better offerings."
"D: Once it warms, this became a much better beer. A good offering from Granite City, but if you're in Omaha, you'll be better off going to Upstream or Lazlo's."
"If this isnt a Guinness clone, Ill be damned. Bitter aroma of oats, chocolate, and dark malts. Dark brown, almost black body with a thick nitro off white head. Tastes likeGuinness. Body is a touch on the watery side though. Smooth but light. Mildly bitter finish. Very drinkable but boozy when warm."
"At least the nitro tap makes it creamy smooth and more drinkable than the taste alone would deserve. (Just my opinion - if you like this, great) I like the Brother Benedict's Bock a bit better. I suppose I'm just frustrated to live across the street from a ""brewpub"" and not get something better."
"This beer pours a jet black color with a nice, tight tan/light brown two-finger head. The head disappears slowly and recedes a bit, leaving a lot of lacing. The aroma has notes of roastiness, coffee and chocolate. The flavor is mild with a definite dry, roasty flavor that reminds me just a bit of coffee. Caramel, toffee and chocolate come through as the beer warms. The flavors are an interesting mix of subtleties... complex, yet subtle... subtle yet not watered-down. The mouthfeel is smooth and silky... medium body with a creaminess helped along by the nitro. Overall a very drinkable dry stout. I've got to admit that this one surprised the heck out of me... I expect good beer from Granite City, but not necessarily great beer... regardless, this beer is very good. Color me impressed."
"Overall: The simple taste profile has a classic background setting and misses nothing; the airy nature of this one makes for a very drinkable Dry Stout. This pairs extremely well with the Vodka Steamed Mussels in Tomato Sauce, Butter and Garlic with the Ciabatta Bread. Nice!"
"This came with a big, foamy, deep-tan/light-brown head. The nose had a lot of roasty coffee notes. The mouthfeel was full and creamy, due to the pour. There was a good bit of cocoa on the tongue with the finish an interesting mix of coffee and a light smokiness. One was plenty, though, when faced with the prospect of going back into the Kansas sun (103 F that day)."
"I have to give this an average rating on drinkability because I would drink it again, but not when I wanted a stout. Either something isn't right about this batch or someone needs to go hit these people over the head with a bottle of Ireland's ( or even America's) finest."
"Drinkability: If you enjoy drinking multiple nitrogenated stouts in a session, this is a good candidate"
"A smooth and creamy stout. Unfortunately, it's lacking on taste and aroma. There's some chocolate and roasted barely in there, but its lost behind the creamy body. Looks and feels great, but just doesnt have enough in the flavor department. Give this to someone who likes guinness or likes creamy, low-flavored beers."
"Upon my fourth or fifth visit to the wonderful Granite City establishment, I was pleasantly surprised to see one of the standard offerings available on cask. Surely I had to jump at the chance to taste. I will say, this is one of the most handsome brews I have seen in some time. It has a beautiful chocolate colored head that has a peppery cloudy look. If there has every been a head that you just want to eat, it would be this one. As you would expect, the color of the beer itself is dark as night while the nose is strictly limited to deep cocoa notes. Not a bad limitation. The mouthfeel is thick and velvety, certainly not out of the ordinary given the style and serving type. There are large roasted barley flavors on the forefront while faint chocolate and coffeeish notes linger. An oaken quality lends that handcrafted feel that is much appreciated. It finishes a tad roasty and dry, with that unmistakable cork-flavored background. Smooth and tasty, this is surely a cask driven brew."
"The body was light and the carbonation was relatively high for the style. Overall this could be a good beer but definitely needs more of strong malt billed to be really good."
"Tasted On-Tap 05/11/05 at the Cedar Rapids, IA location."
"Mouthfeel was equally disappointing with a very watery thin feel about it."
"Drinkability: The third pint I have had. I do enjoy this beer (and the IPA). Couldn't even get Mr. Bud Light to try a small sampler (on me!), so I don't know how this one would be for the BMC consumer, but I thought it is a very drinkable stout."
"Milk chocolate brown, opaque, slightly lighter in color than I expected. head settles quickly to a tan ring. French roast coffee aroma, subtle but nicely executed and somewhat oily. Dryish and light in mouthfeel, hard roast plays off nicely with a slight carob and sugar sweetness. A little papery in the aftertaste and a little stuffy in the nose late in th eswallow. Nice texture and plays pretty wel in the dry style. This is a brewpub beer I would follow if I had a chance to drink it at regular intervals."
"This was a really nice stout."
"Broad Axe Stout might be good to introduce a light beer drinker to the world of dark beer, but anyone serious about authenticity should look elsewhere. Not horrible, just not much there to enjoy."
"Had this one at the St. Cloud location while I was back home visiting for xmas. When I was at SJU we would come here every wednesday to take advantage of their 75 cent taps. Ahem...dark brown with thick creamy, light tan, nitro-ish head. Smell is nutty with light molasses and coffee. Taste is buttery, toasty, roasted maltiness. Very creamy. Goes down easy, and I like it more than Guiness."
"Deep black hue. Creamy slightly tan head, served small in size but what was presented had good retention and as I sipped away the beer it did lace rather well. The potency in the nose was weak, it was served too cold, only some light roasted malts found their way to my olfactory. The taste profile is solid, smooth roasted malts with a nice complement of hops, functionally and agreeably bitter from the hops and coffee taste. The mouthfeel was a smidge too thin. Yet, this is a flavorful enough stout to enjoyable. Only objection: it was served too cold!"
"The Broad Axe pours a dark thin black with a very wide head that clings in patches throughout the drink. Somewhat of a bubbly carbonation with a coffee taste left on the palate, somewhat dry aftertaste. This seems a bit on the weak side for a stout, but rather drinkable for the version."
"This, unfortunately was one of the weaker stouts I have tasted.  The color is nice and dark and the head very creamy, but the roasted malts take over as the only determinable flavor characteristic and the body is much lighter than is acceptable."
