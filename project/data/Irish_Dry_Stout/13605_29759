3.15,-15.8,3,3,3.5,2.5,3,"OVERALL: This is okay, but a bit of a confusing creation. It’s categorized as an Irish Dry Stout, but there is a definite spicy character to it that just doesn’t fit. If they have indeed used Irish yeast, then I can only imagine the spicy flavors come from the hop additions. Regardless, this factor makes the brew more Belgian in style, which is interesting, but not necessarily to style. A decent effort and an enjoyable beer, but a bit of an oddity. Thanks again guys!","Jeffo","Sep 28, 2014"

3.92,4.8,4.75,4,3.75,3.75,4,"Of all of the Québec microbrasserie stouts, this is my favorite. It has a dry punchy taste to start off with and offers cacao and coffee flavours with a hopsy spice to it. The feel is creamy and it isn't too sweet but not too bitter either. The aftertaste seems to be indecisive in the sense that it borders on bitter while leaving a little sweetness. In a nutshell, this is one of the more complex Québec micro brewery stouts and the boys in Shawinigan are on to something with this little pearl. It goes down great on its own but also accompanies strong cheeses very well.","Humphreyproject","Mar 27, 2014"

4.1,9.6,4,4,4.25,4,4,"600 ml bottle featuring cool artwork depicting a kraken battling a bunch of dudes with axes and such. Name refers to blood. Brew is a rich jet black with a burnt orange halo along the bottom of the glass. Ample brown head and smells great: Prominent roasted malt, spice seed like anise, along with a soft fruity top note and a whiff of leafy hops. Taste is light roast coffee, chocolate, and dark dried fruit like raisins and dates ... A touch of smoke. Some herbal hop notes which combine with other flavors to create a licorice root effect. I also detect a bright acidity reminiscent of red wine and although the finish is quite dry as per the style, with some toast and bitter husk, there is a lingering sweetness as well and this is a very well-crafted dry Irish stout that incorporates more noticeable sweet fruit and herb flavors than is generally the case. Medium body which belies the opaque demonic appearance (you'd think it would be thicker), with dryish mouth feel ... Its a little buttery and sweet yet highly carbonated. Neat take on the style. Stronger and more complex than usual ... An American stout/dry Irish hybrid?","CalgaryFMC","Nov 05, 2013"
3.91,4.5,4,4.25,3.75,3.5,4,"Overall this strangely works, the strong coffee bitterness you’d expect is reserved for the finish, while the rest of the flavor plays with citrus grapefruit and herbal hops settling into a chocolatey roasty (tho not over the top) tasty drink. Short of amazing but I would have it again without hesitation as a flavourful session stout on a cool night. 4","mick303","Oct 30, 2013"

3.87,3.5,4,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"Although a French producer, this beer is one from straight out a British pub. I've always considered Dry Stouts to be the 'old reliable' of beer styles and Le Trou Du Diable Sang-d'encre is as solid as any of them. It is substantial and satiating without being too heavy or rich - one bottle was mighty satisfying though I like the idea of having two or three more.","biegaman","Oct 05, 2013"

I couldn't smell anything. The taste was good. Roast malt. Chocolate. Coffee. Maybe a little strong for an Irish stout, more like an Imperial Stout, but good.","deg","Aug 11, 2013"

4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"Draft: Poured a black color ale with a nice off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of dry roasted malt with nice aromatic coffee notes. Taste is also dominated by dry malt roasted notes with some aromatic coffee which is surprising considering there is no coffee in here and those roasted malt do make a wonder. Body is about average for style with OK carbonation. Very well brewed for style.","Phyl21ca","Jul 13, 2007"
3.58,-4.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Had this on tap last night at Volo. Pours a pitch black colour with thin off-white head. Some lacing around the glass. Ok head retention. Smells of coffee and roasted malt. Very sweet flavour, only a hint of bitterness in the aftertaste. Very smooth mouthfeel. This seems to be a better version of and Irish Dry Stout than Guinness, but nothing too exciting. Was a bit expensive for the half pint, so likely wouldn't order again at the price point.","kwjd","Jun 02, 2007"
2.85,-23.8,3,3,3,2.5,2.5,"Pours a nice dark brown/black, red edges, thick tan head, nice lacing, good retention. Smell is very alcoholic, fruity, some dark roast, grassy, kind of weird, not very stout like. Taste is better, caramel malt, light roast, chocolate, but pretty weak and watery. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation. Not horrific but not very pleasant, pretty weak attempt at a stout.","Viggo","Apr 09, 2006"
3.13,-16.3,4,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Another dry stout, black with big head. Roast malt, chocolate malt. Lighter mouthfeel, light alcohol, with C hop in there. A tad of coffee, it all is OK but mediocre rep of the style.Nitro may have added creaminess but which may have impaired flavour.","Sammy","Beers"
3.13,-16.3,4,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Taste: Mocha flavors with little cocoa sprinkles, body is quite light and the bitter finish is coffee-like and mild. A sessionable if not spectacular stout that Guinness lovers will dig, I tend to like mine with a little more substance.","Goldorak","0"
