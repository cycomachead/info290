4.17,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a respectably dark brown/black color with a thinnish tan head that I had to coax with a vigorous pour. Roasted coffee and caramel fill my nostrils along with powdered dark chocolate and a hint of toffee. Taste is roasty and creamy almost like a sweet stout rather than a dry. Chocolate and coffee mixed with caramel and toffee. Longer lingering roasted coffee bitterness mixed with just enough sweetness finishes every sip. Medium body with a light level of carbonation and a creamy smooth mouthfeel. Another great brew from the folks up at the Portsmouth brewery.","johnnnniee","May 15, 2011"

I believe this is my sixth or seventh bottle from these guys and I have yet to have on that was bad or off flavored.

Very faint citrus hops in the nose as well. The flavor follows the nose with a big roasted malt profile with loads of coffee and milk chocolate. Finishes with a leafy/herbal hop bite.

Keep up the good work, Portsmouth!","Kinsman","Mar 22, 2011"
4.07,1,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation.

The taste is probably what guinness would be(if it didn't taste like bog water and chocolate syrup). all the smells com through in the taste and it ends with a nice smokiness too it and coffee lingers on the tongue. It feels silky and creamy and ends with an enjoyable bitterness on my tongue that made me wait longer than usual to have another sip. I actually wanted more of this brew once i had finished the bottle, which for me is a lot to say since i tend to go from one beer to another when i drink, and this was 22oz to boot.

Beautiful cascading nitrogenation leaves a two finger tan head on top of a black body, head dies away slowly to leave very thin head, lacing is more like sheeting. Big nose of roasted malt, slightly acrid dark chocolate and espresso. More of the same on the tongue with a complex, dry finish. Medium bodied and infinately smooth.

While I opted for the fantastic ploughman's platter, I went for the stout eagerly as well. The pint gave looking perfectly poured, black with a wonderful beige with hints of orange head that stayed throughout the quaff. Roasted malt coffee aroma lent to a full flavor that tasted like a nice thick, bitter porter, with slight licorice hints. And then I had another...","selecter70","Dec 12, 2008"

4.22,4.7,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a deep dark onyx black with a thin one finger light brown colored head. A fair amount of spotty lacing remains on the sides of the glass. Smell consists of smokey malts, roasted barley, and faint citrus hops underneath. Some coffee and chocolate linger in the nose as well. I really, really like the aroma of this stout. Taste begins with milk chocolate, roasted malts, and some caramel mocha. Coffee flavors emerge midway with a touch of lactose and vanilla. Some earthy and floral hops tickle the tongue in the aftertaste with faint cocoa powder as well. Light and creamy body with a smooth texture from the soft carbonation. The drinkability is through the roof. Lots of flavor and low abv at 4.5% is a perfect session beer. I really wish more breweries would produce this style. I like this beer alot, and it's even better on cask. Another winner from Portsmouth.","BeerTruth","Sep 23, 2008"
3.78,-6.2,4,3.5,4,3,4,"Tap @ the Brewery. A little thin for my tastes, though it could be because I had it alongside the Portsmouth Kate. Black pour with no head. Lighter aroma of caramel and roasted malt. More chocolate and sweetness than expected. Good hop bite in the back. Very good.","magictrokini","Sep 01, 2008"
4.43,9.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Drinkability: Top notch. The kicker here is the taste: not over-powering but extremely enjoyable. True to it's style, yet very unique. Wish I had another one of these, but oh well... guess I'll have to make another trade.","ThreeWiseMen","Beers"
3.87,-4,3.5,4,4,3,4,"Oakes bottle. Damn good for its style this one. The smell of chocolate. A bit of smoke, lighter mouthfeel. Quite nice. Chocolate and roasty flavour held up well enough after room temperature that I finished another good sized sample then. Black, nothing special on head.","Sammy","0"
4.08,1.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Had this on-tap at the brewpub in Portsmouth. Poured black with a beautiful head that is satiny smooth with very tight bubbles. Great, very fine lacing. Smells roasty and creamy with an undernote of espresso. Tastes roasty as well, followed by a slight nuttiness, the slightly startling and faint flavor of oyster liquor, and a creamy finish. The oyster flavor I'm referring to is a brash brininess with a metallic tang and is evocative of the sea. Mouthfeel is extremely creamy, and this is a pleasure to drink. Quite a complex Irish dry stout, particularly for such a low abv.","Georgiabeer","Apr 07, 2008"
4.03,0,4.5,4,4,4,4,"I picked this up at the brewery along with a bottle of Le Chat Noir, in order to do a side by side comparison. The beer pours an inky black with a fluffy off white head that slowly retreats to a thin layer. The aroma is dry roasted malt with some chocolate and caramel. The flavor is a little sweet, with almost a milk like quality. There is plenty of burnt, chocolatey and roasty flavor to balance the sweetness. All in all this is a solid stout, although it may be trumped by their oatmeal stout.","ericj551","Mar 11, 2008"
3.31,-17.9,3,4.5,3,2.5,3,"Taste is primarily roasted malt with a decent smokiness to it, not creamy and seems a bit thin in the mouth, overall though the lack of carbonation really hurt this beer, not sure if this is the way it's meant to be presented but it meant I've had much better stouts.","deltatauhobbit","Mar 09, 2008"

3.75,-6.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a clear dark brown, reddish in the light, thick tan head forms, sticks around, nice thick layer, not much lacing. Smell is sweet and malty, some toffee, bitter chocolate, coffee roast, cream, quite nice. Taste is interesting, more brown ale than stout, light roast, caramel, nuttiness, light citrusy kick in the finish, bit of chocolate and coffee. Mouthfeel is light bodied, medium carbonation, little bit prickly. Not as smooth as I like my dry Irish stouts, but a pretty capable effort and definately a treat, flavours were nice and light, but had enough going on. Thanks Stan!","Viggo","Feb 23, 2007"
4.03,0,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Can't believe, in all my trips to this place, that I've never tried this beer. It's really nice, what I'd consider an unstoutlike stout. It's dark brown, almost black, with a sticky, coffee-colored head. It has a roasted grain/coffee aroma. Taste of coffee and chocolate, but pretty smooth, like there's some cream in it. Very enjoyable, drinkable beer.","lordofthewiens","Jan 28, 2007"

4.2,4.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"On tap at the brewpub. A nice dark brown/black color with a light chocolate colored head. The head clung to the sides of the glass and lasted for about 1/2 the beer. Aroma was malty with slight hidden sweetness, maybe brown sugar?? The taste was solid. Very little acidity/bitterness that was not noticable. Hints of malt and with slight sweet, same as the aroma. Very easy to drink, felt solid in the mouth. A well rounded stout, good choice to be on their taps year round.","mountdew1","Dec 01, 2006"

3.76,-6.7,4,3,4,4,4,"Originally reviewed May 29, 2005. On tap at the brewpub. Light roasted coffee aroma. Deep balck with a super creamy deep tan head. Fresh sea salt flavors, with some very chocolate and coffee tones. Finish is smooth and creamy, like a drop of sweetened condensed milk in a teaspoon of fresh espresso. Very nice! A little oaky on the back end, with some complex depth in raisins, cinnamon and lots of chocolate, coffee and rum.","CharlesDarwin","Jan 23, 2006"
3.95,-2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"The deep, black, bleak, darkness that is the Portsmouth Stout is sort of hard to write about. It's good, it's.... nice. It's a stout. There's not much else to say about it. There's nothing wrong with it, it's just a classic representation of what a stout should be. It has some nice bitter coffee notes in the nose, and drinks clean, dark, and balanced with almost a hint of cola. It finishes with some nice dark chocolate also. If you're looking for a new experience, this isn't it. If you're looking for a solid stout that won't dissapoint, then take a ride with the black cat.","dherling","Dec 20, 2005"
3.72,-7.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a light black almost dark brown or a burnt brown and leaves a sticky lace on the glass. The aroma is espresso, soft cinnamon, nutmeg. The taste on the palate is some what watery which is how the mouth feel is suppose to be, more of a smooth sipping stout. The body gives you a quick taste of coffee followed by some astringent smokey hop bitterness but quickly dissapates leaving you somewhat waiting for more flavor.","Franchise","Nov 22, 2005"
4.2,4.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The Black Cat Stout was my last remaining bomber from a recent trip to the Portsmouth area. I was sad to see it go because I enjoyed all of them so much, but I certainly wasn't sad to do the drinking! It pours into my glass pitch black with no light penetration. A thin tan head forms and leaves a nice lacing. The aroma is very nice and strong, full of a roasted malt element perfect for the style. The taste follows in this vein. A very nice roastiness comes in providing a very different bitterness than I'm used to drinking so many IPAs. There seems to be a subtle chocolate note in the background. It finishes very dry with an added kick of roasted bitterness. The mouthfeel is good, but does seem to become a bit light towards the finish. Very drinkable. This is a very good stout that exemplifies the style. There's nothing in it that tries to set it apart from its peers, it succeeds in doing this by just being a very, very solid example of the style. No gimmicks.","Hagbard","Oct 03, 2005"
4.23,5,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Really liked this beer. The flavor was more of a roasty than a toasty (or overly so). Very creamy body that was served at the perfect temperature. Poured a very black in color with a slight brown head. Very thick too, with bulbous-like lace. Picked up some slight coffee and vanilla on the palate. Not acidic at all like some other dry Irish stouts. Nose was mostly stale coffee and hints of chocolate.","MuddyFeet","Oct 01, 2005"

4.08,1.2,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Deep black color with a decent tan head that settles to a light lace after I drink. The nose has a ton of roast malt that gives off a little chocolate and maybe licorice.
