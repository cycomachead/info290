" This is a overall excellent beer on this cold January night thats dipping to - 0. A good flavorful stout. I meant to pick up a certain Imperial Stout tonight, wasn't available, this was a great substitute."
""
"O - Decent smoked beer, kinda watery and thin on the end."
""

"Overall, I like this alot. It's a slight smokiness, and it is blended just perfectly off the toasted malt. Would like to see it a bit thicker, though. Maybe a touch less acidic. But, otherwise, the flavor is excellent."
"Apparently I had this sitting in the fridge since last August. I'm glad I finally got around to trying it. It don't recall like an Irish Dry Stout more than this."

"I always have a lot of expectation for a beer that refuses the penetration of light. This black offering comes from a style I have no experience with: Irish Dry Stout. I've had many stouts but I don't recall a category for either Irish or Dry. I like Russian Imperial stouts and choclate or coffee stouts. I certainly can pick up the ""dry"" quality of this beer - but the Irish escapes me - perhaps because I am unfamiliar with the style. What was immediately both present, overriding and persistant was the smoke. I've had beers with a hint of smoke, but this was overpowering. Last time I recall that smell was when I was going through very old, musky, burned out, wet wood buildings looking for salvage. Burned out carbon. Because I am not a fan of smokey flavors (other than from those of beef & pork briskets) - and I have had many ""winter beers"" favoring this smoke characteristic -I have yet to have one that I would ask for by name. Again - just not a fan - for those who like this characteristic - kudos. The appearance was very promising, the mouthfeel right on but the flavor too smokey."
""

"Overall: So this is not really the Irish Dry Stout it claims to be. That's okay, it is still mighty tasty, even if the peat is a little too strong and clashes with the roasted malt."
"Drinks smooth with a dry finish. It's good and well made and pleasing all around."
"A fairly decent light strength stout that still delivers on flavor, but a little average in the flavor. Nothing bad about it and it's enjoyable, but nothing to make it particularly more appealing than any number of other solidly good stouts either."

"O- Ok at best not my favorite style."
"I liked this beer even though it's pretty two dimensional with the roasted malt and smoke. It had a lighter feel to it for a stout and was easy to drink."
""
""
"Drinking this beer reminds me of sitting around a campfire roasting fresh fish and tart apples. A very interesting beer indeed."
"O: An interesting take on the style. I would imagine this one might be enjoyable if you like smoked beers, eventhough the smoke comes through in a bit of a less than normal sense. Still a decent beer though."
""

"Overall, a nice beer to check out, thanks to curtisloew for sending this beer out along with all the other Wisconsin goodness. Go Marquette 10-0."
"A decent beer. The style doesn't do a lot for me, but this was quite drinkable and pretty tasty."

"D = overall this is a nice stout, I like the peat touch, smokier than I'm used to. Not a bad beer at all."
"O - This was okay, but I wouldn't get it again. The unpleasant acidity and char presence detract from the pleasant aspects of this smoked stout."
"OVERALL: Pretty good stuff really, and has held up nicely over the year. The flavor was very enjoyable and all the parts seemed to balance well together. One worth picking up if you see it. Thanks again thetomG! Recommended."
"This beer pours out as a deep brownish black color. The head was a light fan color. The lacing was pretty good at first then it trailed off in the end. The smell of some smoke and earth, a little roasted malt in there too. The taste is roasted and has a light creaminess to it. The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than expected. It's a decent stout but it wouldn't make menrun out of my way for more."
"O - This Irish Dry Stout is a good, solid brew that captures the style very well while adding something a bit different that remains very complimentary of the other components. Great juxtaposition. 3FD should have been my St. Patty's pick this year."
"Pour brings forward a beer that is nearly black and has a thin tan head. Some spotty lacing and not so great retention, though there's a thin collar throughout. The nose brings a bit of coffee alongside a strong base of roasted malt. The flavor is a bit more complex, adding in some dark chocolate alongside the dark, dark coffee. Roasted malt is dominant and becomes a bit too dry and bitter in the finish. Pretty solid effort; I'd have this again."
"O: This is one of the better Irish Stouts I have had. Would have thought there would have been more flavors in the taste given the smell, but overall a really nice brew."
"Bottle: Poured a deep amber color lager with a nice foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of lightly caramelized malt is quite enjoyable. Taste of biscuit malt is very refreshing with limited complexity. Body is quite full for style with good carbonation as well. Well brewed and easily drinkable which I bet was the goal of this one."
"Furthermore...never heard of them; furthermore, I certainly wanted to try the stout. Seemed like a good after dinner drink; furthermore, what the heck...why not. The was a deep rich dark beer, with creamy head. The scent gave way a sweet malt with roasty undertones. The taste was a little lacking to me...I want stouts that are fuller in body....sort of like chewy the beer!! Furthermore, the beer was very sweet...not to my liking. The mothfeel was fine, but a little too much going on....but nothing solid going on....futhermore, it is worth a try."
"An American hopped version of an Irish stout. Worth a try."
"I really like Peat beer, but I found this to be a bit one dimensional and relying on the peat a bit to much, plus has a bit of and off flavor in the finish."
"Drinkability: A decent session stout."
"3.5-4 this is one of the most enjoyable stouts i've had, but could use a little more something--chocolate malt, dextrins, something."
"Pours a deep black coffee color with a thin brown head and a little bit of lacing. Smells of coffee and some malt as well as a little peaty smoke. Tastes smoky from the peat with big roasted malt flavors, and little hints of chocolate and coffee. Mouthfeel is medium with a tiny carbonation Drinkability is medium."
"D-Not my favorite, but the smoky peat makes this an interesting one to try... but only once."
"D: Decent. Not a huge fan of this style, but its a good twist on it."
"I did like the hop bite of the brew but it's not something I'll come back to in the future."
"I finally found a Furthermore beer that I may come back to time to time. The flavor comes off well and the body is spot on. With a lowish ABV, this is one I can see drinking a few of on a fall/winter night. While being unphased by this breweries light beers, maybe they shine in the dark spectrum of beer."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and moderately creamy. Carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is good, I really enjoyed it. I loved the smokiness it had to it. There aren't enough stouts that display smoke this nicely in my opinion. Very nice beer overall."
"Not my favorite style, but this is a tasty brew, and something I would definitely drink again."
"D - This is my first furthermore and it really is quite good. I may purchase the variety and review it here. Damn good beer."
"Whoa! The finger of rocky, deep-tan/light-brown head appeared as if by magic. At first, I was getting nothing and then, Poof!, head. I love getting head. Mmm hmm. Color was a deep, dark, inky brownish-black noticeable only at the edges. nose had a pronounced dark-chocolate characteristic underlain by a mild smoky/charcoal scent. Mouthfeel was medium with a riot of smoke, charcoal, coffee and chocolate all vying for attention on the tongue and in the mouth. The finish was really smoky, where it counted. The label mentioned ""With a hint of peat smoked malt, this stout is a return to County Cork and the warmth of the Irish hearth."" I may soon need a lay-down."
"Overall it does have drinkability with a good blend of flavors that are lightly applied and so are not angry or challenging to the palate."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is earthy hops with some toffee, chocolate and nuttyness. The flavor is toffee with quite a bit of smoke. The smoke was a surprise since I didn't get any of it in the aroma. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Flvor delivers that same great smoky malt, almost in rauchbier territory, and I love it. The thing that makes this beer stellaar is the foamy, creamy, lively mouthfeel. The drinkability is awesome, this beer has a light frothiness that provides a surprising balance to the rich smoky malt. Not at all sweet. Great job!"
"D - This is one helluva good stout...one that I would recommend to anybody that enjoys a good flavorful dark beer. Two thumbs up to Furthermore on this one!"
"D: The smoked malts are a nice addition, adding depth to the roasted malt side. A sessionable stout."
"A very flavorful beer - just what I would expect from this brewery."
"SkÅL!"
"Edit: taste not quite as exuberantly exciting as I initially remember. Still darn good though."
"This is very drinkable! I will not hesitate to buy this one again!"
"D: I could drink this on a regular basis. Pretty good American/Irish Stout."
"Pitch black colored beer with a slowly fading creamy head.Aroma is smoked malts.Taste is a bolder smokey malt,chocolate and coffee.Very creamy and flavorful.This is my first smokey Irish Dry Stout and I liked it.I would recommend and purchase again!!"
"Pours with a dark black ruby highlighted body, head forms thick and billows mushroom cloud like above the rim of my glass. Aroma an air of smokiness from the peat smoked malts, dark chocolate bitterness, herbal hops and a touch of coffee. A nice dry Irish stout, dry smokey delicious drinkable offering, weighs in at session ale strength. A lot of character herbal hop additions, dark roasted coffee and bitter dark chocolate finishes nice and dry with a touch of sourdough bread. The peat smoked malts add a real nice complexity to it all. Mouthfeel is smooth medium bodied evenly carbonated dry finish to be expected. Drinkability is solid probably my favorite from the Furthermore beers thus far and I've had the pale ale, the Proper, and the Makeweight."
"A dry stout with a strong peat smokiness, though enough malt character still comes through. Smokiness does seem to grow as it progresses - think of a traditional Irish Dry Stout with more peat... Enjoyable, though smoky character does impact ""drinkability"" a bit, unless you are looking for a rather heavy peat character."
"D - Very drinkable, actually a treat to drink w/ som much flavor- Furthermore is a brewery to take seriously. I have tasted 3 offerings so far and not a clunker yet"
"Very drinkable brew, and I'm not all that enthused about ""smoked"" brews. Nice."
"A 12 ounce bottle picked up at Abe's in Bethlehem for around $1.75. Poured into my Victory shaker glass. The stout appears an opaque chestnut color with about a finger of quickly fading ecru foam. Nose and flavor consist of smoked malt, lightly smoked meat, chocolate covered bacon, somewhat fruity, coffee, sweet malt. Body could be fuller, carbonation is decent for the style. A tasty smoked stout worth trying if you dig that sort of thing."
"It goes down easy enough."
"A beer I would only occasionally drink, but one of the more flavorful Irish Dry Stouts I have had the privilege of trying. The mouthfeel is spot on. Pretty interesting that they brew this using peat smoked malt. Credit to Furthermore for another unique beer."
"It is a really Good Drink!"
"D - Pretty solid offering with only minor complaints. For this being my first Irish Dry Stout I have to say I am quite intrigued by the way the Furthermore folks worked the peat into the beer. Very interesting and definitely something I would like to try again, just not too frequently."
"This beer pours a semi-clear black color. The head is half and inch in height, and recedes within seconds into almost not lacing. The aroma is of roasted malt, milk chocolate, and a hint of beat. It is a very pleasant aroma, and quite strong for a Dry Stout. The taste is like the aroma, but with more peat. The peat isn't overpowering or what I would call strong, but there is enough of it that it is very noticeable. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with appropriately low carbonation, and a creamy texture. Overall, this is a nice beer that I will certainly drink again."
"M/D - Medium bodied with a somewhat creamy feel. Moderate carbonaion. Easy drinking....if you like smoke. The smoke could be a little overwhelming if it isnt your thing."
"Appearance is good, very opaque dark brownish, with almost no head or lacing. Smell and taste are pretty good. A slight amount of dry malt and bitter chocolate/coffee. There is actually a slight amount of hops here. Very light body for a stout in my opinion but the right level of carbonation is there. Drinkability is pretty good."
"Pours an almost pitch black, but with some dark brown highlights. Great two finger head and a thick foam that retains through almost all 12 ounces. The aroma is smokey and peety with just a little coffee, chocolate, and cream. his stouts hits the palate smooth, silky, and full of smoke at the start. The peet and roasted mlt mix for the middle. The finish has the smoke, peet, roasted malts, faint coffee, and light chocolate powder. Great flavored Irish stout with flavorable sessionability."
"Just bold enough to keep your interest yet it remains very drinkable. Can't wait to try this one in a roast."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Nicely balanced, and the smoke isn't overbearing at all. My one wish would be a bit less caramel and a bit more chocolate, which would bump this one up a bit, as the caramel meeting the smoke, while quite tasty, does tend to wear on me in terms of drinkability."
"D - decent, could belly up for a few on a cold day"
"An interesting beer, but it just wasn't that good. It was worth a try if you like peat smoke flavor."
"D- very good for a dry stout. something id like to check out again, and glad to try something from this brewery. very sessionable, and something i can see myself drinking a few of if given the opportunity."
"Update 10/2009: Now listed on the newish website at 5.5% abv, about right. Got another single thinking I hadn't tried this, on to another go with refinements only. The head has that Guinness look, like it's foaming up to explode slowly. Using a Sam Adams glass to try this one. No light comes through. A smoky nose reveals the peat smoked malt, almost dominates. All the aforementioned flavors are there, with the smokiness a bit more than I remember, very nice. It's not refined, but doesn't overpower making it sessionable. Still high drinkability deserved. I bump the smell .5 for more smokiness, well done here."
"Solid stout! I'll pick up more as its fairly cheap and well worth it."
"Pretty much pitch black with a light tan head that is fairly compact and somewhat persistent. Very earthy, peaty nose. Earthy notes mix with a bit of coffee, baker's chocolate and caramel. Mouthfeel is a touch prickly, perhaps a little over-carbed? Chocolate flavors in the dryish finish. A little watery upfront, but it is an Irish Stout after all. Overall, a very peaty, earthy stout and I approve. I purchased this up in Wisconsin. A town nearby was called Black Earth. This should be the town's official beer."
"D: I will take a lot of WI brews of this one, don't know the price of it around town, but for a $2 tap it was worth it."
"Pitch black with a ruby hue and little head. Smells of wonderful smoked malt, caramel, a unique scent from the peat, and a little bit of citrus to top it off. The flavor is predominantly the malt, warm and robust. It seems like there are about three distinct malts in the blend but I can't really separate them so easily. The peat does give it a wonderful smoky quality however. Fairly clean on the finish for such a dark brew, and very easy to drink. This is something I could get used to having around for when I'm not on a hop binge."
"D-Good, but with this pronounced smokiness, this one is not a session beer. However, the smokiness is not overpowering, and this beer is probably one of my favorite smoked brews, because it showcases the smoke effectively while allowing the other beer elements their times to shine."
"D - This is an interesting irish dry stout. The smoky flavor is a unique twist on the style."
"D- I was kind of hoping for in the face-over-the-top smokiness but what I got was pretty damn nice. The smokiness in the beer was classy and balanced. I will be drinking this again and hopefully soon! This beer is Sofa-King great."
"A deep brownish hue, near black with shades of rust. Frothy tan head that falls slowly to a ring. Smell is huge in the smoked meat department. Whoa now. Not really offensive but huge. Taste is great. The smoke is complimented well by other flavors. Some chocolate, light caramel and coffee, and an earthy hop presence. It's like a dry stout with a smoke addition that is on a larger scale than usual, similar to what you'd find in a Rauchbier. Very good. Mouthfeel is light to medium and silky smooth with a light smoke edge. Damn, I really liked this beer. At first I thought it was overwhelming but it definitely grew on me through the glass. Wish I had more but this is it. Thanks goes to maximum12 for the extra in a recent trade...yet another nice surprise."
"Goodnight!!"
"D: I really like this stout, some can get fairly thick and leave you not wanting another, but not this one!"
"Not sure if i got a good batch here or if i am just a bigger fan of this brew than most previous reviewers. This is my kind of stout, and something that will be purchased again. This is my first brew from this brewery, and it has me looking forward to more. Its easily drinkable, full of flavour, and likely low enough in abv to be sessioned."
"Medium body, medium carbonation, tad thin. I like this beer, it brings something new to the table. The mix of your standard stout with the peat smokiness is awesome."
"D - Yup."
"It's good and well worth a pint. I think there is much more potential for this to be a session beer if it could be served from a beer engine."
"Otherwise, this is not worth trying."
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer. The smokiness gives this beer a nice added flavor."
"D: A very drinkable beer. I liked the little bit of sweetness that happened to balance out with the smoke flavor. The smoke is strong but it isn't too overpowering, which makes it a very nice beer."
"HV"
"Pours a dark red almost purple. Got about 2 fingers worth of head from the pour. Aroma is mild but you get a bit of roasted malt in there. The first taste is earthy almost grainy. To be honest, I have no idea what peat moss taste like but I imagine it is similiar to what you get in here. You do get a smokey taste but it isn't at all over powering. If you are a fan of other smoked beers then you won't be disappointed. If however, you are like me and do not really go for smoked beers, you will find this is actually pretty pleasant. The flavors are all there but not anyone over powering. This is definitely worth a try"
"Excellent, if you have a chance definitely try this one, especially if you like Rauchbier or smoked porters."
"I generally do not like Irish Stouts, but this beer has changed my mind about them. Have to seek it out if and when it is offered on cask. An ABV of 5.5% also helps drinkability."
"Pours almost black with hints of red fairly visible on the fringes. Tastes a little thin on the mouthfeel but very quaffable. I could drink a few of these and still be reasonable. The peat adds a dryness that complements the style but does take away from the traditional roastiness finish."
"drinkability is good. this is a roasted and rich brew that is pleasant on the palate, without overdoing the malt or smoke. nicely proportioned."
"D: Just not for me that's all."
"I liked this brew... Very easy drinking.."
"A touch thin but considering it's not a nitro, that can be expected. A smooth drinker that doesn't fill you up or put you half in the bag. Absolutely sessionable."
"A neat take on the style for sure, but not my favorite. A great pairing with BBQ ribs."
"Mouthfell was ok, but it is a stout, it better have a decent feel to it. I choked half of this beer down, let it warm and tried it at different incriment to give it a fair shake. But down the drain it went."
"Into my pint glass, pours pretty much pitch black, a nice size tan head, ok lacing, pretty decent. The aroma is loaded with peat and smokiness, some coffee and maybe a little bittersweet chocolate. There is even more peat and smoke in the taste, roasty and toasty malts, very roasted coffee and a bit peppery spiced. The mouth is smooth, a little dry toward the end, good body and carbonation. I liked this beer since I first had it, and good smoky brew."
"A nice brew if you like smoky beers, but this one i wont get again just for that reason."
"The flavor has a good dose of smoked malt with a dry finish. It's got a light/medium body and the flavor is not overpowering. The smokiness lingers on throughout. Very drinkable."
"D - I am not a fan of peat malt but it blends nicely in this beer."
"Very drinkable and if you're a fan of Dry Irish Stouts, I would recommend this. The smokiness adds an extra dimension to an already good beer."
"Overall: The beer looks great in the class but doesn't seem to deliver. Decent beer, but a bit thin, lacks aggressiveness, and seems to have a brewing flaw, though nothing I'm not going to finish and enjoy."
"This is a good beverage, but it is ever so close to being truly remarkable."
"Pours a dark, chestnut-brown in color, with a medium tan head of good duration. Head consists of dense, almost tiny bubbles. Lacing is solid, and this is opaque when held up to the light.SMOKEY! The smoke fairly obscures the malts, but there are hints at the dark and chocolate malts that lie beneath, as well as a hint of sweetness. Very agreeable on the first sip, with a full-bodied impression. Smokey and a bit sweet, with all of the better qualities of the style coming to the fore, along with some bitter chocolate and light espresso notes. Closer to full-bodied than many of the stouts I've had in this style, and remarkably smooth. Although the smoke lingers, it doesn't totally obscure the finer malt and hop qualities present here; there's a roasted malt profile that hovers just undeneath the smoke, an assertive-yet forgiving hop bitterness, and a touch of oilyness that adds great depth to the malt profile. Top notch, folks. Now let's hope Furthermore sticks around a while."
"A wonderful smoked beer that's underrated in my opinion. More people need to give this a try!"
"Pours dark brown, a deep walnut color. Small khaki head. Chocolate and smoked malt odor. Fairly pedestrian and a little sour smelling. Fizzy, aggressively better in an old coffee grounds way. Too biting and sour with not enough chocolate or malt flavor to back it up. A bit thin on the mouthfeel. I liked the Knot Stock a lot better."
"An above average but not great stout. If not for the hint of peat, it would be fairly unremarkable, and the peat really is just a hint. The nose has some nice toasty notes. Good, solid coffee stout flavors, with the peat and some vaguely sweet milky notes coming in late. Nice dry finish. This might grow on me."
"Three Feet Deep would be better if it was Six Feet Deep. Having said that, this is very good beer that has that Furthermore twist that I've come to know and love. If you like well-crafted beer that comes at you from a slightly different direction, give this brewery a look."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a fast moving slightly prickly carbonation. Goes down easy while seeming to be a little on the light side for a stout. Overall, a tasty stout with a nice twist from the peat smoked malts. I wouldn't mind sitting down to a few bottles of this one. Glad to see a new brewer in Wisconsin and look forward to trying more of their offerings."
"Drinkability was only average. Flavors were fleeting, I felt it too watery to enjoy, too carbonated, and too dry."
"Thin mouthfeel, roastiness keeps the drinkability at moderate levels. A good interpretation of a smoky Scotch Ale."
"Rich, deeply roasted, and noticeably smoky, Three Feet Deep delivers a full sensory experience. Starting with visual of the creamy dark-tan head atop its ebony-colored body, it follows that up with a solid roastiness in the nose that's reminiscent of an early morning campfire: it's roasty, ashen, lightly smokey, and slightly pine-like or leafy in the background. The body is medium, and it's slick and gently oily across the palate with a delicate, restrained carbonation. The flavor brings some added dark caramel to the mix, buoying the roastiness and soft smokiness. A thin thread of bittersweet chocolate runs through it, and there's a suggestion of leafy, grassy, and piney hops in the backgropund. The bitterness is quite firm, but not pressing, and not much is needed to help the roasty, smoky, and gently peppery character in the dry, softly lingering finish. Very nicely done!"
"Bit of whisper of whiskey in there, too. Hmmm...was that intentional, he muses sarcastically..."
"This was my first Furthermore brew, I will surely try another."
"D- This beer is better and having flavors beside Band-Aid peat flavors but they are still to strong for me and I would like to taste the malt flavors over the peat."
"This beer pours an inky black with a plentiful dark tan head. Aroma is of chocolate, and little else. Flavor is light meaty smokiness (like a ham?) which reminded me of an O'Fallon Smoked Porter I had awhile back. Very interesting. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but this beer is still fairly drinkable."
"single purchased at Star in Madison, smuggled back in a suitcase"
"Drinkability/Overall: a solid beer overall. Doesn't wow, but little detracts from the beer's mission - a smoked peat Irish Dry."
"drinkability: pretty good"
"Doesn't do it for me."
"While this might not make my list of regulars it definitely stands out as an interesting change of pace. I give Furthermore props for using the peat. Its risky and I cant see many people liking this beer. Still, that managed to restrain themselves to a degree and the beer remains drinkable by any standards regardless of ones affinity for peat and meat."
