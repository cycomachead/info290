"Overall: This bottle has a few years in it but it still drinks nicely; the mouthfeel would need to be a bit better to take the rating up to the next level"

"This was a nice ""desert"" beer after eating their pollock fish and chips. The beer packed in the good, dark roasted malt flavors and felt relatively light yet rich and smooth going down the hatch. Very delightful, very drinkable..."

"Super fantastic and super drinkable, great beer!!"

"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is jet black with a low profile, dense, off-white head that clings to the glass like glue. Smokey and coffee roasted aromas, which smell light, and very tasty. Flavors are dry and smooth, with roasted coffee and a slight molasses highlight. Cloying, bitter aftertaste that is pleasant and rich. The finish is dry and bitter, cleaning the palate. Very tasty brew."

"Overall: Not your typical Irish Dry stout; I would place it as an American stout. The beer needs to be a little more roasty and creamy to be a good Irish dry stout. I enjoyed the oppurtunity of tasting this beer and it was the first beer I have tried by Portsmouth."
"Overall: Carbonation Overkill. (Bad bottle maybe?) although others tried it in our tasting group the same time as I did. Just not one that would bring me back again. Too many other better stouts out there and more easily available."
"A nice beer, first Portsmouth beer. Enjoyed a lot moreas it warmed. Thanks mikeyv35!"
"Very drinkable and tasty"

"A good example of a traditional stout. Went well with the pulled pork sandwich."
"Loved it. Try it if you're drinking in Portsmouth then I couldn't speak more highly of the Portsmouth Brewery. The imperial stout is great and so is the Bottle Rocket IPA."

"Very good stout."
"o - overall, this beer is to beer...what baileys is to booze. it is pretty light and has a nice irish cream thing going on. mostly char and roastiness with some subtle notes of coffee and a nice presence of powdered chocolate. this beer is totally hitting the spot right now."
"Overall: Probably the best Dry Stout I've had, which is not that many since they seem to be hard to come by in the craft world."
"O - Enjoyable. I really am a fan of the Irish Dry Stout, so this was hit home for me. That said, I've had better, but still, I enjoyed it for the most part."
"O: A wonderful example of the style. The care they put into their ""everyday"" beer is very apparent. Send more jax!"
"O - Overall this is quite the irish dry stout. Nice and creamy, really good appearance and smell. A solid brew from Portsmouth."
"O: Goes down easily, ridiculously tasty, not too filling, mild kick, and excellent representation of style. This is a phenomenal drinking Irish Dry Stout. One of the easiest drinking of the style that I've had. Yea - I could get with this one all day, every day!"
"Pours a respectably dark brown/black color with a thinnish tan head that I had to coax with a vigorous pour. Roasted coffee and caramel fill my nostrils along with powdered dark chocolate and a hint of toffee. Taste is roasty and creamy almost like a sweet stout rather than a dry. Chocolate and coffee mixed with caramel and toffee. Longer lingering roasted coffee bitterness mixed with just enough sweetness finishes every sip. Medium body with a light level of carbonation and a creamy smooth mouthfeel. Another great brew from the folks up at the Portsmouth brewery."
"That said, I'll withhold judgment on the debate between Cat and Kate. I'd rather have both."
"O-Overall this is a very good stout. Very drinkable and very pleasing to all the senses."
"Overall: I think this beer fits the style very well. Would purchase this again at the brewery to take home or have a pint if I was ever driving through Portsmouth. Very easy drinking beer and would recommend it to anybody."
"This is as good as they come in my opinion, easy drinking and oh so smooth. Don't get me wrong when it comes to Portsmouth, Kate the Great is where it's at but don't turn your nose up to their other offerings because they are just as good. I believe this is my sixth or seventh bottle from these guys and I have yet to have on that was bad or off flavored. So again I say if you get a chance to try or trade for one tonight's beers, this is a no brainer and sure win in the flavor category."
"O - Unbelievably easy to drink. Calm and smooth. This is really something. This is a perfect example of an Irish Dry Stout. I've never finished a bomber so fast. Wow. I'd love to get my hands on more."
"Pours a near pitch black, brown with a faint tan head that fades into an offwhite ring. Big roasted malt, coffee, milk chocolate aroma. Very faint citrus hops in the nose as well. The flavor follows the nose with a big roasted malt profile with loads of coffee and milk chocolate. Finishes with a leafy/herbal hop bite. Creamy, smooth, and silky mouth feel. Dangerously drinkable."
"So I am in New Hampshire for the Great Bay Half Marathon...its the night before a race and ....why not drink some....ok....alot of the local beer!!! Here Kitty kitty kitty....The Black Cat stout from Portsmouth is good. This beer has was dark/black in color with thin ecru head and great lace. The smell has a subtle roast coffee nose. The smell funnels into the taste of this beer. The reasonable ABV leads to this beer being a Session...certainly worth a taste."
"Cask beers always deliver a wonderfully smooth mouthfeel and this one was no different. In particular, this was a bit chewy and full bodied too. Overall, I've always enjoyed this stout because it really is a more flavorful version of Guinness and/or Murphys, but the cask and dry hopping really take this one up a notch. Keep up the good work, Portsmouth!"
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. The nitro delivery was not 100%, it was clearly a blend of beer gas nitro/c02 because the initial pour and head formation was short lived. Overall easy drinking and not bad. In the dry stout category this is among the better ones I've had."
"While this didn't quite come off as a traditional Dry Irish Stout to me, this definitely packed some quality full flavors and a well balanced feel into its easy drinking sub 6% package. I could have easily had a couple of these. I believe that this is usually their staple dark beer here and it's a good one to have around."
"D: Under 6%? Good enough for me. My Irish dry stout on St. Patrick's day."
"First review under the guidance of a great beer connoiseur. Bomber bottle from the brewery. Cocoa powder taste, not too sweet, has a bite to it. Not too bad for an Irish Stout. Thank you A Korsak for my grandchildren and for the awesome beer mentoring"
"(1-1-5, I'll never catch afksports)"
"overall - not that impressive of a beer, but i may just not like irish dry stouts?"
"Drink is decent, creamy and smooth, no bad flavors, could have used a bit more dryness on the finish, and I would like to try it without the nitro. The more I drink the more some earthy and a little herbal hop flavors come out, and start to interfere with the rest of the beer a bit, but that's my opinion."
"This is a very drinkable stout. Next time I'll opt for the growler instead of a bottle. It goes down that well. I'd also want to save some to cook with."
"D: I recall having this at Kate Day earlier this year and really enjoying it. However, revisiting it in bottle form has been a revelation. This is another very solid beer from Portsmouth. Feel is perfect and drinks much bigger than its ABV suggests. Really good and worth seeking out."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is decent, but not great. It was a little on the sweet side for me overall, but not too bad. Enjoyable beer overall."
"Thin mouthfeel that goes along with the dryness. This is a stout I can drink all night. It may even be a good summer stout with the roastiness and thin body."
"This is a great example of the style"
"Overall, a pretty decent dry stout. Easy drinking. Nice flavors. Good stuff."
"D: As drinkable as a 5%+ stout can be. The feel really leaves you longing for another sip. This is by far the best dry stout I've ever had the chance to drink. Been all over Great Britain and the US drinking stouts and this is the best Dry Stout imho."
"Drinkability: Finishes much easier than stouts I'm used to. This beer paired really well with my haddock - they complimented each other nicely, rather than got in one another's way. Would absolutely try again."
"I could drink this beer all day. My first offering from the Portsmouth Brewery. I picked up a bomber to bring home."
"as a side note, if you want to make the staff at Portsmouth Brewery laugh, just ask if they have any Kate the Great in stock."
"Update June 2011: Major skunked bottle the first time I tried this. This is a really good stout, creamy, lots of malts, slightly dry, some coffee and bittering chocolate flavors. Plenty of carbonation. This is a keeper for sure. Major upgrade from my original ranking of B-"
"D- If I were in a chugging contest, it would get a 5, however, I am not. I was pretty dissapointed in this stout. I won't be seeking it out again in the future."
"jet black in color with a small, tight tan head. Some great lacing going on. Great aroma-a rich, deep chocolate like quality to it. Nice roasted grain smell. Deep and rich tasting-nice blend of roasted grain and ""dark spices"" such as anise and licorice. Nothing is overwhelming but well blended together. Cocoa flavored. Silky smooth and very full bodied. Nice dry finish. Just a great beer in general. More flavor then any Irish stout I can remember. Thank you sir may I have another?"
"If you are a fan of Uncle Arthur, this a nice similar stout. Less creamy, more bitterness. I'm not sure which would be considered more drinkable, but this is worth a shot to see what you think."
"Thanks to Kelp for hooking me up on this one. Looking forward to trying more of their beers."
"Poured forth the color of cappuccino with a small brown head that went away slowly. Smells like coffee, smoke and cocoa. The taste is probably what guinness would be(if it didn't taste like bog water and chocolate syrup). all the smells com through in the taste and it ends with a nice smokiness too it and coffee lingers on the tongue. It feels silky and creamy and ends with an enjoyable bitterness on my tongue that made me wait longer than usual to have another sip. I actually wanted more of this brew once i had finished the bottle, which for me is a lot to say since i tend to go from one beer to another when i drink, and this was 22oz to boot. I do wonder how much nicer this would have been straight from the tap though."
"I had this on tap at Portsmouth Brewery on 10/16/09, poured into a shaker pint. Beautiful cascading nitrogenation leaves a two finger tan head on top of a black body, head dies away slowly to leave very thin head, lacing is more like sheeting. Big nose of roasted malt, slightly acrid dark chocolate and espresso. More of the same on the tongue with a complex, dry finish. Medium bodied and infinately smooth. I could drink this one all day, an extremely sessionable stout, very much enjoyed."
"Goes down quickly. I want to down this stuff quickly, but better discretion limits the possibilities. Nothing against Guinness; it serves a purpose, but if you could have this on tap why would you even consider anything else? Extremely well-constructed."
"A fine example of an Irish Dry Stout."
"D: This is the definition of a session beer."
"Good drinkability on this as well, but I tend to use it as a session closer more than a session brew."
"Drinkability was pretty high for a stout. Not as thin as a Beamish or Murphy's, but delicious enough to have multiple."
"D- low abv and otherwise great tastes make this an excellent session beer."
"Pours jet black, on the thinner side of stouts. Not a ton of head, or lacing. Ordinary in appearance. Smells pretty hoppy and kind of harsh, like sharp spicy bitter chocolate. Taste is great though, and very smooth. Lots of rich chocolatey flavours, some nice roastiness blending together to something that is fairly creamy, and surprisingly light and easy to drink for the style. Not boozey at all, nor is it overly hoppy. This is a pretty good beer, and a sweet session stout."
"Pours a jet black with a smallish tan head. The smell is pungent with coffee,chocolate,and roasted malt. The taste has a full flavor with roasted malt,coffee,and chocolate. A pretty good tasting stout. The m/f is light with all the flavors mixing well. A very good stout from a very good brewery."
"Overall this was like kates little sister for me. Rich, smooth, decadent and slightly dry this was a nice lighter stout that I really enjoyed and would have no issue at all going back to another day."
"Mouthfeel is creamy with a big round body. Delicious beer."
"D - Ever so easy. Such a sessionable brew that could be an everyday drinking, pending its availability of course. Great beer from Portsmouth, I'd seek this out especially for fans of Oharas Irish stout."
"Although the aroma of this beer was really terrific, both the taste and the mouthfeel were disappointing. I would opt for any nitrogen infused Irish dry stout over this."
"Drinkability- Man this stuff is tasty! It's got this sort of half semi-sweet half semi-bitter thing that I'm totally digging. It's got a beautiful finish that is dry and oh-so-delicious. Big thanks for sharing Adam!"
"d: I've never tasted anything quite like this, very tasty! Thanks joepais."
"This is a very good example of a dry stout and very sessionable."
"There's nothing like getting something than from it's source: the brewpub in Portsmouth. As we sat down I noticed a gentleman sipping a dark stout along with mussels. While I opted for the fantastic ploughman's platter, I went for the stout eagerly as well. The pint gave looking perfectly poured, black with a wonderful beige with hints of orange head that stayed throughout the quaff. Roasted malt coffee aroma lent to a full flavor that tasted like a nice thick, bitter porter, with slight licorice hints. And then I had another..."
"I could drink this black beauty all night. (once you go black, you never go back)"
"Pours a deep dark onyx black with a thin one finger light brown colored head. A fair amount of spotty lacing remains on the sides of the glass. Smell consists of smokey malts, roasted barley, and faint citrus hops underneath. Some coffee and chocolate linger in the nose as well. I really, really like the aroma of this stout. Taste begins with milk chocolate, roasted malts, and some caramel mocha. Coffee flavors emerge midway with a touch of lactose and vanilla. Some earthy and floral hops tickle the tongue in the aftertaste with faint cocoa powder as well. Light and creamy body with a smooth texture from the soft carbonation. The drinkability is through the roof. Lots of flavor and low abv at 4.5% is a perfect session beer. I really wish more breweries would produce this style. I like this beer alot, and it's even better on cask. Another winner from Portsmouth."
"Tap @ the Brewery. A little thin for my tastes, though it could be because I had it alongside the Portsmouth Kate. Black pour with no head. Lighter aroma of caramel and roasted malt. More chocolate and sweetness than expected. Good hop bite in the back. Very good."
"Drinkability: Top notch. The kicker here is the taste: not over-powering but extremely enjoyable. True to it's style, yet very unique. Wish I had another one of these, but oh well... guess I'll have to make another trade."
"Oakes bottle. Damn good for its style this one. The smell of chocolate. A bit of smoke, lighter mouthfeel. Quite nice. Chocolate and roasty flavour held up well enough after room temperature that I finished another good sized sample then. Black, nothing special on head."
"Had this on-tap at the brewpub in Portsmouth. Poured black with a beautiful head that is satiny smooth with very tight bubbles. Great, very fine lacing. Smells roasty and creamy with an undernote of espresso. Tastes roasty as well, followed by a slight nuttiness, the slightly startling and faint flavor of oyster liquor, and a creamy finish. The oyster flavor I'm referring to is a brash brininess with a metallic tang and is evocative of the sea. Mouthfeel is extremely creamy, and this is a pleasure to drink. Quite a complex Irish dry stout, particularly for such a low abv."
"I picked this up at the brewery along with a bottle of Le Chat Noir, in order to do a side by side comparison. The beer pours an inky black with a fluffy off white head that slowly retreats to a thin layer. The aroma is dry roasted malt with some chocolate and caramel. The flavor is a little sweet, with almost a milk like quality. There is plenty of burnt, chocolatey and roasty flavor to balance the sweetness. All in all this is a solid stout, although it may be trumped by their oatmeal stout."
"Taste is primarily roasted malt with a decent smokiness to it, not creamy and seems a bit thin in the mouth, overall though the lack of carbonation really hurt this beer, not sure if this is the way it's meant to be presented but it meant I've had much better stouts."
"D-Very true to the Irish dry stout tradition. Probably too filling to drink alot of, but certainly tasty enough."
"Not a bad beer at all."
"This is a very drinkable stout, especially with the low ABV. Had I not wanted to sample more of their offerings, I could have easily sat at the bar and knocked several of these back, given that it was a raw, rainy, cold and windy night on the NH coast.."
"looks very nice, smells very nice just needs to grow up more. it reminds me a lot of a beer i had out in oregon called the terminator, just without balls. if all the flavors were kicked up this would be very enjoyable but as is it's kind of boring. i might give it another shot."
"Pours a clear dark brown, reddish in the light, thick tan head forms, sticks around, nice thick layer, not much lacing. Smell is sweet and malty, some toffee, bitter chocolate, coffee roast, cream, quite nice. Taste is interesting, more brown ale than stout, light roast, caramel, nuttiness, light citrusy kick in the finish, bit of chocolate and coffee. Mouthfeel is light bodied, medium carbonation, little bit prickly. Not as smooth as I like my dry Irish stouts, but a pretty capable effort and definately a treat, flavours were nice and light, but had enough going on. Thanks Stan!"
"Can't believe, in all my trips to this place, that I've never tried this beer. It's really nice, what I'd consider an unstoutlike stout. It's dark brown, almost black, with a sticky, coffee-colored head. It has a roasted grain/coffee aroma. Taste of coffee and chocolate, but pretty smooth, like there's some cream in it. Very enjoyable, drinkable beer."
"Drinkability - This beer is very drinkable @4.5%. I could suck down a couple of these at the pub or at home watching a game. Nice work portsmouth."
"On tap at the brewpub. A nice dark brown/black color with a light chocolate colored head. The head clung to the sides of the glass and lasted for about 1/2 the beer. Aroma was malty with slight hidden sweetness, maybe brown sugar?? The taste was solid. Very little acidity/bitterness that was not noticable. Hints of malt and with slight sweet, same as the aroma. Very easy to drink, felt solid in the mouth. A well rounded stout, good choice to be on their taps year round."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, grainy, & mildly astringent. Semi sweetness up front fades away with some roasted coffee notes into a somewhat dry finish."
"D: I like this stout. At 4 bucks a pop it's definately worth picking up--if you can get to Portsmouth. Session brew at it's best here."
"Originally reviewed May 29, 2005. On tap at the brewpub. Light roasted coffee aroma. Deep balck with a super creamy deep tan head. Fresh sea salt flavors, with some very chocolate and coffee tones. Finish is smooth and creamy, like a drop of sweetened condensed milk in a teaspoon of fresh espresso. Very nice! A little oaky on the back end, with some complex depth in raisins, cinnamon and lots of chocolate, coffee and rum."
"The deep, black, bleak, darkness that is the Portsmouth Stout is sort of hard to write about. It's good, it's.... nice. It's a stout. There's not much else to say about it. There's nothing wrong with it, it's just a classic representation of what a stout should be. It has some nice bitter coffee notes in the nose, and drinks clean, dark, and balanced with almost a hint of cola. It finishes with some nice dark chocolate also. If you're looking for a new experience, this isn't it. If you're looking for a solid stout that won't dissapoint, then take a ride with the black cat."
"Pours a light black almost dark brown or a burnt brown and leaves a sticky lace on the glass. The aroma is espresso, soft cinnamon, nutmeg. The taste on the palate is some what watery which is how the mouth feel is suppose to be, more of a smooth sipping stout. The body gives you a quick taste of coffee followed by some astringent smokey hop bitterness but quickly dissapates leaving you somewhat waiting for more flavor."
"The Black Cat Stout was my last remaining bomber from a recent trip to the Portsmouth area. I was sad to see it go because I enjoyed all of them so much, but I certainly wasn't sad to do the drinking! It pours into my glass pitch black with no light penetration. A thin tan head forms and leaves a nice lacing. The aroma is very nice and strong, full of a roasted malt element perfect for the style. The taste follows in this vein. A very nice roastiness comes in providing a very different bitterness than I'm used to drinking so many IPAs. There seems to be a subtle chocolate note in the background. It finishes very dry with an added kick of roasted bitterness. The mouthfeel is good, but does seem to become a bit light towards the finish. Very drinkable. This is a very good stout that exemplifies the style. There's nothing in it that tries to set it apart from its peers, it succeeds in doing this by just being a very, very solid example of the style. No gimmicks."
"Really liked this beer. The flavor was more of a roasty than a toasty (or overly so). Very creamy body that was served at the perfect temperature. Poured a very black in color with a slight brown head. Very thick too, with bulbous-like lace. Picked up some slight coffee and vanilla on the palate. Not acidic at all like some other dry Irish stouts. Nose was mostly stale coffee and hints of chocolate."
"A very drinkable stout and it paired well with my fried seafood appitizer. Would have gone equally well with dessert, or as dessert, or with oysters. I liked this one a lot."
"Actually, it got a little too sweet and syrupy for me toward the end. If I didn't have to drive home, I would have tried something else."
"This is one solid stout. The Black Cat stout is well crafted and made with quality. Wish I could find this in stores around me. Check it out if you have the chance."
"A fantastic session stout."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Medium-heavy in body. The finish is long on the bitter chocolate and roasted tones after swallowing. Another outstanding beer at Portsmouth. It's almost a meal in itself."
"Deep black color with a decent tan head that settles to a light lace after I drink. The nose has a ton of roast malt that gives off a little chocolate and maybe licorice. The taste has a dominant roast malt flavor. Some of the licorice comes through in the flavor along wit a pleasant hop bitterness and some floral hop flavor. Very dry in character with a mildly slick mouth feel. Very drinkable beer."
"Full bodied, smooth and just a touch sour - nicely offsets all the sweetness that would otherwise be there. They should add a beer engine to their setup and run this one off cask. I picked up a couple of bombers from the store to bring home."
"Both the beers I tried at this place were really good. I'm going to have to make a special trip up here to try some of the others, or beg and plead these guys to roll some kegs into the Blind Tiger."
"My wife actually had this offering before I had a chance to try it and she even liked this one,pours a pitch black with a great creamy,sticky head.Aroma is roasted to the hilt along with some sweetend chocolate hints.Taste is roasted malt and chocolate with a marshmellow quality about it,a very enjoyable beer to savor the different flavors of this one."
"Cheers"
"Update: they do bottle this. Must be cold in hell"
