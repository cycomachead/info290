4.23,14.3,4.25,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Pours in to a Madra Rua proper Guinness pint glass with an opaque, dark color. Nearly black, but not quite. Mahogany and crimson highlights are around the base of the glass and where the light hits it just right. The chunky, towering beige head recedes very slowly, leaving mountainous peaks and plateaus near the rim. The aroma is heavy on raisin, cola and dark bread-like qualities. Faint molasses is present, as well. It's an intoxicatingly delicious combination, but not overpowering by any means. The taste brings black coffee astringency, with a little lime-like citrus bitterness from the combination of blackened malts and earthy hops. It's smoky and roasty with an herbal tobacco nature. Drying in the finish, almost puckering. It's flavorful, yet refined. With a body that coats the palate, yet remains moderate, this one strikes a good balance. If not for the creamy carbonation it might lack some depth.  Overall, this is extremely easy to quaff. Especially for such a boldly flavored brew. At 6% ABV it retains a high degree of drinkability. Guinness Extra Stout is distinctly excellent. A quintessential Irish Dry Stout that still serves a measuring stick for the style.","JohnnyI","Mar 08, 2015"

The look is obviously unmatched. A jet black body with the ""everlasting gobstopper"" of ale froth. Smell is hard to find, and taste is smooth, yet slightly metallic for my tastes. If all you know is American Corn Beer do yourself a favor and try this. Otherwise move on and find the ""foreign"" variety of their stout. Now that's a world class beer.","datalager","Jan 31, 2015"

I decided to go back to it and rate it, since I haven't gotten around to trying it again until now.  It's slightly lighter than I remember, my tactile memories telling me that drinking this is the past was like consuming liquid breakfast.  The dark flavor and creamy head I still remembered well, and I definitely like it.  This is a really good stout, and there's a reason why its popularity persists to this day.  I will try to drink this again in the near future, and maybe then I'll add to this review.","Doctor_Bogenbroom","Dec 13, 2014"

3.9,5.4,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 4/24/2014. Pours nearly pitch black color with a 2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Dense soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light dark fruit, light char, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light dark fruit, light char, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roast, toast, dark bread, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice dry stout. All around good complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 27, 2014"

The taste is all around a little bit stronger, although the sour end takes some getting used to. On the other hand the Draught is probably easier to drink if you are not used to stouts.","SensorySupernova","Sep 23, 2014"

Too much caramel malt and hardly roasted at all. Also too bitter for the style. I was expecting a creamy mouthfeel atleast since that's what Guinness is known for, but was let down. Better than Guinness Draught, But that's not saying much at all. Glad I tried it once, but will not return again unless I'm at a bar and the only other beers are BMC.","Bone53","Jun 12, 2014"

The aroma is deep malt, caramel and molasses with a little earthy funk to it. The taste is good, but pretty monochromatic. It is strictly chocolate malt (think coffee bean roast without the coffee flavor). It's not bad, but there isn't anything else. There's a good weight to the body and nice mouthfeel and a slight bite on the finish. A very good stout.","delta490","May 29, 2014"

4.1,10.8,4,4,4.25,4,4,"When Guinness was first brewed in Canada, there was a noticeable drop in quality. It used to be my go-to stout, but after they stopped brewing it in Ireland for sale in USA, I stopped drinking it. I found it for sale at my local grocery store and decided to buy it in honor of St. Patricks day and I am glad to give a thumbs up review. It is much closer to the Ireland brewed version and is quite tasty. It has a superb balance of malt and hops and is full flavored but not overwhelming. Kudos to Diageo for bringing back the traditional flavor instead of some ill conceived adaptation to ""American"" taste.","SanWrencho","Mar 14, 2014"

Big change in opinion, it is a great option for being a standby beer in my opinion, from the classic dark brown body to the creamy head, the wonderful yeasty finish (and aftertaste), and it is far better at 45-50 degrees where the yeastiness really shines.

The dark hue and thick, brown head make this beer looking creamy and inviting. However it is very bitter and full-bodied. This can be good or bad depending on your taste in beer. I didn't enjoy the first one, but by the end of the 6 pack, i thought it to be a very good beer. This is a great beer to pair with food. It stands up well against a stew or with steak.","JesseMurdock","Apr 14, 2013"

I get ""sweet dry roast"" out of this brew, and somewhat astringent, puckering & earthy. I'd enjoy this beer more if it the grains didnt come off so astringent to me throughout this pint I drank.

Flavor is fairly bitter due to roasted malts and espresso. Sweetness comes from vanilla and brown sugar. These flavors are very well balanced though. Medium to full body and moderate carbonation. Despite the bitterness this one is still pretty refreshing and clean. I think I like this one more than Guiness draught.","kylehay2004","Jan 13, 2013"

Obviously nothing beats a Guinness on draught, but I have had them out of a 12oz bottle and the pint can with a CO2 cartridge in it. It is a very dark, opaque with a swirling bronze color amidst its black depths. After pour it has a thick, frothy two-three finger head that leaves a heavy lacing. The smell alerts one to the bitterness in this stout, and it holds true to that promise, as it is a heavy, dark, toffee, and nutty taste. The discerning drinker might even note a hint of caramel malts. While it goes great with food, one might even say a Guinness is a meal in itself because of its thickness. I would recommend this to any who prefer a darker, bitter glass for their pleasure. Another great drink with Guinness is a black and tan made with a Bass or other type of lighter ale for a delicious layered beverage. Enjoy one for the Olde Country!","FratyardVines","Dec 04, 2012"

I am finding that this makes a lovely desert beer being as dense as it is and how well it pairs with chocolate or coffee flavored pastries. I am interested in enjoying Guinness with tiramisu. Is this beer for everyone? Definitely not... but if a person can avoid being intimidated by such a heavy beer, they may find they enjoy it more than they thought!","alienesse","Oct 02, 2012"

The taste pretty much follows the smell of sweet malts and agave, with some slight odd cherry sweetness perhaps? an odd bit of flavor if you ask me. The mouthfeel adds nothing new at all.

It's a roasty beer with a super creamy mouthfeel. Its bitter, almost coffee-like and leaves a beautiful aftertaste. Its strong and I can only have one as it made me a feel a big full.

There are aromas of roasted barley malt, chocolate, coffee, and some hops. This classic stout does not disappoint in the taste department. There are sweet bready dark malts as well as chocolate and coffee. There is some mild hop bitterness in the back end. The body is light to medium with adequate carbonation. The finish is dry. The drinkability is very high. Overall, this is an excellent beer. This is still a solid classic that has the definiting flavors for this style.","acevenom","Jun 05, 2012"

The mouthfeel is slightly watery. Overall, I'm disappointed. I've had this beer other times and have been wowed. Today, not so much. It's dry and carbonated.

In any of these situations, Guinness Extra Stout is a good, reliable choice. Perhaps slightly overpriced for what it is ($8-$9 a six), Extra Stout is highly drinkable, all-around solid beer(much better than Guinness Draught) that I will undoubtedly continue to come back to from time to time.","Bockrules","Nov 02, 2011"

4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Typical Guinness pour: opaque black cascades into your glass, light tan finger of head that recedes a bit more than you'd expect, and leaves good lacing, but probably not quite as much as the regular Draught. Smooth, heavily roasted malt aroma with some coffee and dark chocolate. Same in the taste: roasty, roasty malts, dark chocolate and cocoa bitterness, coffee, and little to no hops, though perhaps just a touch of a floral aspect.

We'll see how time and experience have treated this memory. The erstwhile beast pours a deep onyx topped by a bit more than a finger of dirty light tan foam. Man, I miss the usual Guinness cascade, but this is still pretty in its own right. The nose comprises roasted malts, rich chocolate syrup, light molasses, and a dusting of coffee. The taste holds notes of roasted malts, light cocoa powder, very light coffee, and a strong twinge of a semi-sour, semi-bitter (more toward the former, though) character. The latter lingers on a bit through the finish. The body is a solid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly chewy feel. Overall, though not as beastly as I remember, this thing can still hold its own against any other Irish stout put up against it. Good times.","TMoney2591","May 08, 2011"

Guinness Extra Stout is pretty drinkable for a dark beer, some people claim this is like a meal in a glass, but to me it's just not thick and flavorful enough to live up to that claim. I won't seek this beer out, but if I was at a bar that only has light beer I wouldn't mind a couple of these. I feel like this beer might be better in a nitro can and I will have to try it someday.

It's leaving very nice lacing though. The body is pitch black, even when held up to the light. I'm very confused by the appearance of this beer, but it does look good! It smells just like a regular Guinness to me except with more alcohol and a sourer smell. The sour is really overpowering in the smell quite frankly, still smells pretty good though. Wow, I'm not liking this taste at all, the first thing you get is the sour taste, and then that taste leads you into a wine taste, the beer tastes like strait wine. Finally after the wine taste passes, you get a gross unidentified aftertaste, I can't really describe it, but it's gross. Hidden in there is a little bit of a malt taste, which makes it bearable. Really not impressed here at all, I thought I would like this beer a lot more. Mouthfeel is ok, nothing too special there, a little thin for my liking, but whatever.

Displeasingly gassy for a stout, though, almost like an adjunct lager or cola. Twangy, lingering metallic sourness is noticeable, and a hard-water sort of character, especially if you sample it alongside other stouts (I paired this against an Old #38). Stubborn, bitter aftertaste clings on the outbreath. Some chocolate notes and a hint of sweetness, but to me this doesn't have a ton of character -- it tastes distinctly like a mass-manufactured beer. Too hard watery, sour, and fizzy.

D: like a sandwich only all liquid, could drink a few but would feel like I ate a loaf of bread. The second way I tried was in a Black and Tan with a nice Belgian strong pale ale-Judas. Supercharged Black and Tan with the 8.5% ABV as a treat in the bottom. Used a you tube video to coach on the pour.

I poured it into a Sam Adams glass, and it was immediately apparent that this was a much poorer product. There was no creaminess or full flavor or even full body that I enjoy in their low alcohol regular stout. The flavor was bland...mere hints of roastiness or maltiness in comparison.

Light-bodied mouthfeel is watery, bitter, and highly carbonated with a mildly dry aftertaste. This macro stout drinks like a mainstream English Pale Ale, and I can't say that's a bad thing.

The basic tastes between draught and extra stout are the same, creamy head and robust, full bodied stout taste with undertones of hazelnut and coffee, but extra stout differs in that it is not quite as smooth. What it loses in smoothness it gains in taste. Extra Stout has undertones of chocolate and is a bit dryer in taste than its draught brother and is a bit stronger in abv, but abv is an after thought to taste in my opinion, and the bit of extra sense of carbonation differentiates this beer from guinness draught and adds to the complexity of the beer.","squirrelJS667","Jan 22, 2010"

But the only reason I even had it was that I asked my girlfriend to pick up a good porter or chocolate stout to make a float with for dessert, and she snagged this (beer-wise, she ONLY drinks bud light), and it wasn't even good until the ice cream had fully melted to mask the beer.

A chocolaty aroma at first scent, then a mild bread fragrance with a slight grassy scent at the end. A strong dark bread flavor, along with heavy malt flavors. Those flavors blend to mild chocolate taste, then moving to a mild citrus bitterness, with a touch of pine, those last flavors linger on the palate for some time. Though it looks thick, mostly due to the head, it has rather a thin watery feel at the front. It does gain some weight as it reaches the back of the throat, leaving the palate fairly dry. This is a visually stunning and beautiful beer, the aroma and flavor are very lackluster and the feel reminds me of a macro brew, with out the strong carbonation.

When poured it produces a pretty big head that fairly quickly get reduced to about a one finger very light tan colored head that is frothy and rocky looking. Head has good retention and leaves nice lacing. The smell is mainly dominated by roasted malts and other roasted smells. Some coffee is there as well as maybe a bit of chocolate and nuts. Taste is very roasted tasting just like the smell. Coffee is there as well but most of all is all just has a roasted taste to it. Pretty strong but I like it. Mouthfeel is creamy, not as creamy as on tap but still creamy. If this is your type of thing then this one is very drinkable, and for me it's my thing.

Tastes a lot like a good stout should, minus the nitrogen. It has a depth that guiness can provide,(ie malt, subtle hop, and roasted barley) but it has a lack in the characteristic that a good on tap beer has.

The flavors are simple but tasty: a nice roastiness that (for once) doesn't necessarily evoke coffee or dark chocolate, unless you want to burn them in which case you get the idea. This beer has a simple, almost elemental quality to its features that establish the standard by which I (personally) compare several other beers of its style. It's body is medium-full, unlike the watery stuff that comes from several of the nitro-can/bottles.

I've enjoyed many a pint, nitro-can, and bottle o' ""the Black", and though I have hard issues with the brewer's practices and politics, there are no beers I like any better with Irish stew, or enjoy more frequently on St. Patty's Day.

The smell even seems different, subtle coffee beans and maybe a bit of charcoal. I get some of the same effect from the taste, with a hint of pumpernickel bread. Much more like a standard lager in feel, well carbonated, easy drinking but not as smooth and velvetty as the mother's milk you get on draught when properly poured.

Dark, with nice chestnut-ambered glints if held up to light. Head decent, though less thick and creamy than Guinness regular. Mouthfeel smooth and substantial. Taste: wherefore the charm--hint of toastiness, hint of sweetness, the spectre of creaminess chased by cool bitters. Truly delightful--a beer to nurse over easy convo.

The head is tall, firm, and quite rocky. It's an attractive stout. The aroma is all about the roast. Roasted barley, charcoal, a bit of dark bitter chocolate, and dark roast coffee. Dry and bitter. It's not a smooth beer, but instead has a welcome roughness. Bitterness (from the burnt and roastedness) begins early, and lasts into a lingering hop bitterness. Almost no malt quality, and no real sweetness, this one is surely dry. Full in body and distinct in character. It's not complex, not at all - but it's straightforward and solidly good for a dry stout. The finish is clean and sharp, making it very refreshing. Unlike a lot of my 'starter' beers, this one holds up well to its memory. I strongly prefer it over the draught stout, and it's definitely worth having every once in a while.","Suds","Feb 17, 2008"

I had a 22 oz bomber bottle to start my Super Bowl watching and was amazed because I am so used to regular Guinness which is way overhyped due to those incessant ads. Poured this in my mug and there was a thick, black liquid that proceeded with a frothy head that never went away. Nice smell, nothing overpowering, but it was a light coffee malt smell mixed with nuts. The flavor is more pronouced, as the body is heavy with coffee malt, roasted malt and maybe some chocolate. Balanced nicely with some smoothness attributed to caramel malt as the hops are pronounced and it ends dry. Overall, a standout stout that once could session.","clayrock81","Feb 04, 2008"

Taste is nice and full bodied as opposed to Guinness draught which is pretty thin and watery. Much fuller taste, roasty malts, a touch too much caramel flavor, but with the right amount of bitterness. This is so much better than regular Guinness I think. Mouthfeel is thick, creamy and nice, but with a good amount of carbonation that keeps it from being too heavy. Finishes with a medium to long lengthed slightly bitter roasted malt aftertaste.

The smell is roasty burnt grain, coffee and dark chocolate with some esters. The taste starts slightly sweet and grainy a touch of molasses, the sweetness moves aside as hop and burnt malt bitterness move quickly to the forefront. The finish is dry and really quite bitter almost puckering, overall mouthfeel is pretty full and smooth.

Poured from a double-duce bomber to a pint glass, beer is almost black with a faint dark brown hue around the edge and a nice, two-finger, foamy/creamy brown head. The nose is sweeter than I remember; I'm only getting slight roasted notes which is what I usually expect from Guinness. I think I served myself too cold, which is preventing the normal characteristics from showing themselves. The taste has the same sweet fruitiness upfront but is quickly quelled by the bitterness you might expect from burnt coffee. There is also a slight oxidation present which doesn't do much for the taste. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a creamy, expansive carbonation and finishes dry (duh).

The taste is balanced and not sweet with a mildly bitter and long aftertaste.

Smell is of ice coffee and malt and some caramel. Tastes like some malt, grain, and chocolate all mixed together, a great balance of sweetnees and some bitterness as well from the hops.

That flavor mellows out, but the sweet/sour flavor is still present. The mouthfeel is ok, has a lot of carbonation making it a bit fizzy.

This one isn't as full bodied or flavourful as a lot of stouts I've had, but nonetheless a very respectable product from the true originals of the style, and drinkable in quantity.

Offwhite head that fades to aring and leaves no real lacing. The smell is slightly roasty and slightly malty, with a touch of roasty sourness there as well. The taste is a classic- not the best in the world, not the worst. The bottled version isn't as creamy, but iis stronger, and in my opinion has more character. Flavors of roasted malt, some bitter hops in the end, and a little bit of salty caramel underlying it all. The mouthfeel is a little light, and not particularly creamy, but refreshing.

Very bitter, coffeelike, with the aforementioned hints of chocolate and almost a light nutty flavor. Mouthfeel is very heavy, but smooth and creamy. Almost like whole milk in texture.

Has the strong, distinct guinness smell, thats the only way i can describe it, just cant get enough of that burnt malt aroma. Tastes like the draught but with more of a hoppy, bitter kick. Has the deep burnt malt taste but suprisingly was slightly wattery. Not as thick as the draught. Not quite as drinkable as the draught but drinkable none the less. I do like this beer but when im in the Guinness mood i think ill take the draught, just has more to offer, but this is definately worth trying, if you can find it.

The mouth is medium light, with biting carbonation. This is easy to drink, and this is the last bottle in my sixer.

Upfront aroma is of course UK style, but with a slight alcohol aroma, and a bit stale smelling actually. The more I smell, I'm finding it also smells a bit like a strong macro lager for some reason...I'm thinking schaffer...? Go figure. Taste is smoooth up front, but becomes burnt and roasty malt, then that becomes water with a bit of sourness in the end. The flavor is kind of stale and...well, generic--at moments tasting like nothing. This is guinness and not a mistake. Take it or leave it. Surprisingly bright in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium in weight, and fair on carbonation though bright, lacking the creamy nitro thing, which is not an insult, just different than the draught in that way as well. Overall, this is not as good as I blissfully recalled from earlier in my beer explorations, sadly. I prefer stouts with a bit more and somewhat different character by now. This is classic obviously, and has a recognizable flavor profile, but a good stout need not be a Guinness take-off, as many seem to be. So pass me that SN Stout.","Liquids","Sep 02, 2006"

Deep roasted character, but with a little bit too much hops for a stout. The taste is the same way, coffee-like (not as pronounced as the Draught), but the hops really remind you of an ale. An interesting pairing I've never ran into. Drinkability isn't spectacular. After about two bottles you throw in the towel to the strong nature of this beer. Alcohol isn't pronounciated for a 6.00% however, so thats no issue. A very well done, non-watery stout. Can't say I like it better than Draught.

The flavor and smell is similar to communing with a great grassy expanse containing big fat roasting malts waving in the wind and roiling like waves in the ocean. Marvelous, I don't think there's a better roasted malt beer in the world. This is the gold standard. However, the Irish style ultra-smoothness of the beer in the mouth lends a bit less than exceptional rating on the mouthfeel and drinkability...if they collaborated with Porter makers in northern England (goodness, no!) to improve the gaseousness and put an edge in the mouth to help transmit more of that wonderful flavor, they'd likely make the best beer the planet has ever seen (and that was ever dreamed possible).","Socrates","Jun 22, 2006"

Well, I'm glad I chose to try this style for the first time on St. Pattys Day and give it a review. For its steep price, I wouldn't choose this over a cheaper domestic stout, but its presence in most bars will give me a good standby.","dreadnatty08","Mar 17, 2006"

It is really excellent and smooth. However, every now and then some pungent alcoholic tastes will ring through and really ruin it for me. The mouthfeel is good. It is slightly thick with no carbonation coating of the mouth. As for the drinkability the coffee bitterness does get to you during a big gulp but for drinking regularly it is good.

Not very pleasant. However, this initial unpleasantness gives way to a big malty taste that feels nice and broad on the tongue. This part is excellent! The malts don't wash away too quickly, leaving a nice bit of flavor in the mouth. The mouthfeel I think is the most interesting part about this beer. It feels weighty, but in a good way. It feels like this beer has substance! The initial thickness gives way to a malty grittiness that is just so addictive.

Not a very strong aroma, but hints of earth, coffee and herbs were noted. Taste was quite nice, flavors of coffee, hops and a smoke-like quality. Very filling. Decent mouthfeel, slightly creamy.

The taste is strong and appealing, also a little tart. And whattya know? A million times tastier than Guinness Draught. I notice sweet malts and a touch of coffee beans, both brought on with just the right amount of bitterness. Mouthfeel is not light at all, but probably a little thinner than medium-bodied.

Pours nice and dark with a nice tan head. The head stays around for the life of the beer. Smells great, as good as any version of Guinness. The difference is in the feel/taste. This is a lighter, thinner beer than the draught/tap version. I wouldn't say it is more watery, just thinner. Don't expect the same feel/taste as the draught/tap version, you'll be disappointed. While I normally like the thicker draught version, I do sometimes like this version better because it is lighter.

Taste is also similar to roasted coffee, but this is probably a little too bitter for me to love. There is a light sweetness here, especially in the dry finish, but not enough to make this great in my book. Drinkability is pretty good, but I think polishing off a six pack might be a little much.

The mouthfeel is about on par with most stouts in terms of thickness, but the carbonation was a little much. The taste is very bitter, and the roasted malts really come through. The Extra Stout is like Guinness Draught's evil twin brother. The Draught is smooth and creamy, while the Extra Stout has a much more substantial bite to it. I think the bitterness is a little over-the-top, but Extra Stout wins some points for having character to it.

It had a very smooth mouthfeel, surprisingly similar to what I'd get out of a tap. The taste however was watery to me. Nice flavors of coffee, toffee and toasted nuts, but all very mild.

It pours jet black, which is good. I like porters and stouts that you cannot see light through. It laces the glass well, too. It looks great! The smell is very nice as well. A little bit of dry roasted malt perhaps. A sweetened coffee like smell. Maybe some chocolate. The taste starts out wonderful, but goes south from there. It has a sweet malty taste to it at the beginning, which is nice. However, there is a very clearly noticeable...almost metallic like taste on the finish. It isn't totally awful, but I certainly don't share the enthusiasm that many others seem to have for this stuff. The mouthfeel is a little on the heavy side, which is good.

In The finish a cedary character becomes apparent. Hop bitterness is medium to high throughout. The mouthfeel is grainy and roughly carbonated. This is a very sharp tasting stout that is completely dominated by the roasted (burnt?) barley. Some how the taste really works, the intensity is reminiscent of very hoppy beers in a weird way.

Better than Guinness on-draught, though still brewed in Toronto to North Americans.

It's pretty dark, but the red brown hints show through and its apparent that it is transparent, just really dark. The three finger head is pretty thick and tan, but the bubbles are quite large, and it ends up looking like swiss cheese (receding unevely). The first thing i smelled when i smelled this was skunky rubber, obviously not a pleasant smell. There is some wheaty smells behind it, and a bit of malt too, but the alcohol is also apparent in the smell. Compared to the Guinness Draught, this is a little bit better, but not much really. There is a bit of charred taste to it, with a subtle earthy flavor, but theres really nothing on any other level. There is a tiny bit of fruitiness, but barely any at all, and the overriding taste is just a dry bitter flavor, and in this beer, its certainly not from hops. Its just kind of dry and chalky tasting. The aftertaste is all bitter and chalky. The mouthfeel is disappointingly thin, as I was expecting more from the ""extra"" stout after having the Draught. Its thin, dry and has a ton of tiny carbonation bubbles. Granted that it was free, I would take most other stouts over this one. This beer, given that I had some expectations of it to be better than regular Guinness, was quite disappointing.","FranklinPCombs","Apr 29, 2004"

When poured it became a dark coffee looking beer with a mocha frosty head that stayed on very well. Then when I expected to smell greatness, I was dissapointed, the smell is of roasted malt and traces of coffee but a very subtle smell instead of the strong smell in other stouts. The taste is below average on a basis of stouts. The coffee and roasted malts are strong in the beginning but a very metallic taste comes on strong at the end and won't let go, horrible.

This is one beer that took some getting adjusted to for my taste buds, at that point in my road to beerdom sipping on new beers was common ground, and I found appreciation for them all, however the first time I tried Guinness I recall saying I was never going to try it again. Now I would like to point out a crucial fork in the road of my life that if the next time I came across this beer I would have to make the decision to give it another shot or pass it up for good. However, I chose the right road, and that same thinking has made my beer drinking much more exciting and meaningful to me and my friends and family. So, I thank Guinness for being something completely different for most American swill drinkers and thanks to my brother Dante' for nudging my interest in giving this beer another shot. Pours a deep dark practically black ruby brown tone with a massive milk chocolate tan fluffy mountainous head with great retention and very nice scattered evenly fine lacing. Aroma some hop bitterness meshed within mild chocolate tones, freshly ground coffe, and slightly harsh dark roasted barley to form a classic aroma of a dry Irish stout. A sharp upfront slightly acidic tone with some hops adding bitterness and finishing with creamy chocolate tones leaving a dry pleasant but at the same time a palate battering coffee note. Unlike anyother beer style in the world something can be this drinkable with a fuller mouthfeel and so many flavors that don't belong in beer, well I am glad I opened my horizons to beer because this is definitely a satisfying treat that I will always be able to come back to.

Decent tan head that fades to much lacing and a creamy ring. Nose is of rich roasted malts, a bit of coffee, a bit woody, and a hint of sourness (a la Guinness' special brewing process). Flavour is rather mild for such a robustly dark ale, roasted malt with a mild sour aftertaste. It possesses the best mouthfeel I've yet to come across, rich and velvety, it just rolls over the palate and tongue, and goes down incredibly smooth. On those cold, blustery, barbecue-less Canadian winter evenings I've been known to down many of these to get me by until the first signs of spring and grilled red meat appear once again.

Tonight is the first time I've had Guinness in quite a while, and I'm surprised how thin and light it actually is. Since I been drinking much stronger beers, Guinness hardly seems stout anymore. Compared to most stouts or doppelbocks, it is downright tame. It starts off nicely, pours a dark, almost black beer, with a nice foamy head. Smell is pretty good, also. Guinness still tastes good, but the body is so light I feel like I'm drinking a glass of cola. It is a little bitter and dry, but once again, compared to something like Shakespeare stout, quite tame.

One of my first choices if I have to downgrade from draft beer at a bar with a poor selection.","Murph","Mar 19, 2002"
3.79,2.4,5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"I walk into the little market by my house to pick up some milk, and lo and behold, in the cooler, they are stocking bottles of this stuff (St. Patrick's Day must be coming up, eh?). This store caters to the Busch and Miller High Life crowd, so seeing Guinness Extra Stout was surprising. The cashier rang it up, looked at me and said...""Is this beer?"". I assured her it was (she needed to know to hit the ""beer"" key on the cash register.). I give this perfect marks for appearance. No, it doesn't give the show the nitro can or draft do, but it looks incredible in the glass with a brown, candy-like foam head and pitch blackness staring from the pint glass. Nice roasted malt taste, light hop twang, and overall a bit more warming than regular Guinness. Good stuff. FWIW, this was brewed in St. James Gate, not by Labatt in Canada.","proc","Mar 05, 2002"
3.78,2.2,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Bitter/coffee dominates...robust and grainy character...a little too heavy duty and oily to my tongue but its a classic and travels well -- though these days ""imported"" means from Canada. Its still my test standard for evaluating the Dry Stout style, this is one of those beers that's always good as a ""fall back""...","ADR","Feb 28, 2002"
4.6,24.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Rich smelling bouquet of mildly roasted malt and a sharp wild hops.  Black as any other guiness.  Don't get that beautiful cascade effect like the draft or nitro, but this is still a pretty beer.  Semi-sweet.  Mild bitterness that sticks on your palate.  Stronger than your regular Guinness, and because they give me more of what I'm seeking I like this even better.","Jordan","Jan 23, 2002"
2.7,-27,5,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Pitch black appearance. Not nearly as creamy and milky-textured as I would have liked. Way too bitter for me. Just didn't care for it at all. Was a little more enjoyable when it warmed up. Guinness On-Tap IMHO is so much better. I do not know, but looking at everyone else's review, maybe I haven't come across a good bottle yet here in town.","ThreePistols","Nov 09, 2001"

4.76,28.6,5,4,5,5,5,"Silky smooth, rich malt, chococlate & coffee. Outstanding. My bottles were from St James Gate and were no less than four years old! If anything the taste mellowed a bit with the age.","John","Oct 22, 2001"
3.82,3.2,5,3,4,4,4,"This is classic beer. Here in my neck of the woods the 12oz are from Canada but the 16oz is really from Ireland. My wife and I did a tasting of the Pub Draft (can) which was thin and watery, Extra Stout 12oz Canadian great flavor but a little thin, then the Extra Stout 16oz Irish Very tasty and creamyer than the 12oz with a little more body. But nothing beats the Extra Stout on Nitro Tap :)","mattmaples","Sep 14, 2001"
4.06,9.7,5,4,4,4,4,"After ignoring this stout for a while in favor of heavier bodied, fairly sweet English style stouts, it was a pleasure to have a few bottles of Guinness.  As others have said, there are better stouts out there than this venerable classic, but few can rival its easy drinkability.","Brent","Aug 20, 2001"
4.36,17.8,5,4,4,5,5,"A true classic. Not the best, but not far from it. Rich, creamy and very satisfying. I have to admit that I've never had it room temp in a pub.","grdahl","Jun 22, 2001"
4.94,33.5,4,5,5,5,5,"Unfortunately, this listing is for the BOTTLED version of Guinness. Those that know buy the CANS! Still probably one of the best beers around no matter what it's served in. In cans rating goes to straight 5s. From tap in Dublin rating goes to 6s!","suglis","Feb 01, 2001"
4.7,27,4,4,5,5,5,"Notes: This is the real Guinness, in my opinion. Known and labeled as their ""Original," and actually, orginally, their Porter product during the 1700's (becoming their Stout in 1799). An exceptional Stout! The 60/40 nitro-injected stuff you get at the pub today is fairly new to this world (1961) -- it hardly stands up to this brew.","Todd","Nov 11, 2000"
