3.41,-4.2,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours an almost opaque dark brown with a 1 inch puffy khaki head that settles to a craggy cap. Thick streaks of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, slight cocoa bean, and slight coffee notes. Taste is of roasted dark malt, burnt coffee, and some bitter cocoa bean flavors. Mild roas/coffee/cocoa bitterness on the palate after each sip. Low carbonation on this one with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good Irish style stout that I picked up on the cheap at Trader Joe's, but I am not so sure I would get it again.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 18, 2011"
3.91,9.8,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"M: The feeling is good, good lasting and good ending, a little bitter at the end combined with balanced little sweet with little bitter in the beginning.","karait95","Jul 10, 2011"
3.95,11,4,4,4,3.5,4,"dark brown, basically black with no light shining through on this one at all. Rich looking head of tan on the top hung around for most of the session. The aroma was a bit light. Lots of roasted malts, with just a hint of cocoa underneath it. Really dry taste, but a little bland for me. Light cocoa and roasted malts, but it lacked alot of depth to put it over the top into another cateogory. Still though it was a decent little stout with a nice feel, and a 3.5 percent very drinkable.","mikesgroove","Jun 10, 2011"
3.58,0.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall: This is a good cheap stout that is very drinkable especially in the winter time. I will make sure and pick up another 6 pack come winter time","DarthKostrizer","May 01, 2011"
3.75,5.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"T: A little sweet for a dry stout, but this is tasty. A bit of coffee bitterness upfront, followed by some smooth and sweet chocolate flavors. End finishes with a roasted and slightly charred note. A solid beer and probably the best stout in the Trader Joes lineup.","notchucknorris","Jan 11, 2011"
4.03,13.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Tastes great. Looks great. It's not in my top ten beers list, but it's a really good beer. Nothing more, nothing less.","rKunda","Jan 05, 2011"
3.85,8.1,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours an opaque black body with a 2-3 finger tan head. Smells of many things: dark caramel, raisins, dark chocolate, smoke and faint coffee. Complex smell but not as complex taste as I picked up mainly dark toffee, smoke and coffee followed by a hoppy bitterness which leaves a relatively dry finish. Overall, a light(er) stout in this style but a good stout. Try it out!","Beerbluesbiology","May 24, 2010"
3.63,2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Drink- It was free. It was not bad and I think North Coast does some good brews.","FosterJM","May 17, 2010"
4.12,15.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"It was only $6 for a 6-pack, so I figured this was a poorman's version of Guinness, but I was pleasantly surprised! Full-bodied, nice coffee flavour. Slightly syrupy, but not too thick. The best part was its low ABV - it makes a good session beer. As far as cheap stouts go, this one's now my favourite.","pennywhistle","Mar 16, 2010"
3.43,-3.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Not a bad beer, but not really a good one either. I love North Coast brewing but this is a miss for me. I won't be buying this beer again when its infinitely superior, more badass brother Old Rasputin is around. I often wonder if all these bourbon barrel aged, choclatey, anisey american RIS have ruined my taste for more traditional, dry irish stouts.","iD9","Mar 09, 2010"
3.51,-1.4,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Black with some tan head, little or no lacing to speak of, not bad for a stout. The smell isn't terrible, but there's some wet dog smell under the roasted notes that doesn't jive with me. Some chocolate and coffee notes too. Taste follows suit, largely roasted and chocolate notes, akin to a Guinness with a bigger MF. MF is a bit over-carbonated, though not terrible. Mutes some of the flavor. Decent drinkability, nice easy drinker, I'd like it to be a bit more interesting.","LordAdmNelson","Jan 27, 2010"
3.57,0.3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Fairly average pour, a dark brown color with a nice brown head. Aroma is very rich, with notes of chocolate and coffee. It is a bit mild in taste but still delicious - chocolate coffee and caramel malts with a bit of a dry finish. Mouthfeel is the same, mild but definitely not a bad thing. I'm by no means a dry stout person, but mild yet delicious flavors and mouthfeel make for a pretty damn drinkable stout for the price. Not bad.","tang3nt","Jan 03, 2010"
3.48,-2.2,4.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,"D: For the price a great value stout. Compared to what's out there I wasn't hugely impressed, but if you want a stout on a budget this is servicable.","Halcyondays","Dec 05, 2009"
3.88,9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Nice drinkable stout here. Not going to wow you, or knock you out with huge flavors or alcohol. This is just a quality beer that tastes pretty good, and is quite sessionable.","flexabull","Aug 23, 2009"
4,12.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability: Great stuff. Maybe I'm over exaggerating because I haven't had a stout in a long time, but I'm impressed nonetheless. If this is truly modeled after the brews they serve in Dublin and Cork -- not the stuff from St. James's Gate -- then I really admire and envy the Irish.","TheQuietMan22","Jul 15, 2009"

3.41,-4.2,3.5,2.5,4,3,3.5,"the carbonation is a bit sharp, but other than that nothing of note to the moutfeel and drinkability. I've been using this as my thirsty beer the last couple of days, and there is nothing preventing someone from drinking two or three of these in a row, if they are so inclined. It does not overly fill you, no single taste is too overwhelming to be repeated, it doesn't really coat your mouth, it's reasonably seesionable","kemoarps","Aug 17, 2008"
3.68,3.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"D - Nice for the type.","srandycarter","Aug 14, 2008"
3.83,7.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D-Solid. Just a tad on the thin side but I will forgive this due to the pleasant dry roasted flavours that come through...even more so as it warms.","Deuane","May 05, 2008"
3.35,-5.9,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: Light body (considering the style) boosts drinkability quite a bit. Black Hart was enjoyable, but nothing special. Obviously needs to be classified as an Irish Dry Stout.","ThreeWiseMen","Apr 02, 2008"

3.16,-11.2,4,3,3,3,3.5,"Poured a dark brown with lots of deep tan foam and some lace. The smell of roasted malts was the really strong aroma in the nose. The taste was of roasted malts with a hint of chocolate. The after taste was pleasant, not over bitter.","barleywinefiend","Mar 02, 2008"
3.87,8.7,3,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"This is another surprisingly tasty beer for the price. It's got the requisite chocolate-coffee aroma/taste you'd expect of a stout, with a bit of smoky hoppy bitterness to round things out. Decent, but not very long-lasting, head; full, complex body; eminently drinkable...it also becomes smoother the longer you keep it. I discovered this by accident; an ex left me a couple of bottles and I didn't get round to drinking them until a couple of years later.","oogenesis","Feb 05, 2008"
3.36,-5.6,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"D- Could probably drink as a session beer, something I could enjoy with company and food, a beer I would enjoy but not have to think about.","Maudite","Jan 31, 2008"
3.47,-2.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: North Coast sure does churn out alot of dry stouts. I have trouble seeing myself reach past an Old Stock Ale or an Old Rasputin to try this again.","ChainGangGuy","Nov 21, 2007"
3.9,9.6,4,4,4,3,4,"Pours black with lasting tan head. Smell is nice and sweet molassesy, and roastiness. Taste is very nice. balanced roasty, sweet, bitter, and a hint of coffee with a very drying finish. Very flavorful, drinkable stout. Quite good, unique (to me) and worth getting for sure.","JDV","Sep 28, 2007"
1.83,-48.6,3,2.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,"D- Each initial sip is very good but the after taste really distracts form its drink ability. Would go with other stouts rather than pick this one up again.","monkeybeer","Aug 25, 2007"
3.35,-5.9,3.5,3.5,3,3,4,"A thin mouthfeel with not a whole lot of carbonation, certainly a session stout that is very accessible and drinkable. All in all a good offering.","gwood","Jul 06, 2007"
3.6,1.1,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Black Hart is decent beer that could be better than decent with a few tweaks. At an ABV of 5.4%, it's well-suited for sessioning. Maybe North Coast Brewing didn't want to cannibalize Old Rasputin's sales. Mission accomplished.","BuckeyeNation","Jul 02, 2007"
3.18,-10.7,4,3.5,3,3,3,"A mediocre stout, but one that has potential to be something better. Too much burnt bitterness in the flavor, which I find unattractive when it's not balanced in this type of beer with something creamier.","mithrascruor","Jun 26, 2007"
3.32,-6.7,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"D: Pretty dry, but drinkable. I don't see myself drinking more than 2 of these at a time; but that doesn't say much since I can't down a lot of stout in general.","leechungsr","Mar 21, 2007"
3.62,1.7,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Great label! I got this beer on the cheap and was satisfied all the way.","travolta","Feb 15, 2007"
3,-15.7,3,3,3,3,3,"Alright drinkability. Run of the mill dry stout for me, just needs to be kicked up a little.","blitz134","Jan 23, 2007"
3.25,-8.7,3.5,3.5,3,4,3,"I was slightly surprised how light this beer was. For most stouts, I expect no light to penetrate except at the edges. When held to the light though, this beer let a bunch of light through lighting it a dark brown color. The mocha head disappeared quickly. The aroma is very malty for a stout, but still good. The flavor is surprisingly dry for such a malty aroma. It has a good roasted flavor, but nothing really stands out. The body is medium to full, which is appropriate for a stout. I certainly did enjoy this beer, but it's not among my favorite beers.","drseamus","Jan 21, 2007"
3.23,-9.3,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Drinkability: The über dry roasty character overstays it welcome and it soon enters overkill territory.","goschool","Nov 22, 2006"
4.13,16,4.5,4,4.5,3,4,"Pours very dark red with strong brown tones. Medium, foamy, tan head; light lacing, dies down quickly. Aroma is roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, and molasses. Medium body with an easy, surprisingly fizzy mouthfeel. Flavor is a strong roasted malt attack with charcoal, chocolate, and coffee. Grassy bitterness accentuates the stronger roast flavors. Some mild dark fruits in the finish. No particularly strong aftertaste.","Night","Beers"
3.75,5.3,3.5,3.5,4,3,4,"D: Tasty and goes down easy enough. It’s not very filling considering the style. I could drink a lot of this beer, but there are others that I would prefer within the style.","TheManiacalOne","0"
3.72,4.5,3.5,4,4,2.5,3.5,"Lighty roasty aroma with some mild brown ale nuttiness and very faint coffee suggestions. The body is dark brown to flat black and holds a creamy tan head that is about a thumb thick and lasting, but slightly bubbly on the sides. The first sip is slightly thin then a lot of roasted malt profile comes through with some cream notes and faint coffee. Tastes pretty good and has a nice burnt/roast bitterness in the finish. A mite thin, but tasty and enjoyable overall.","Jredner","Jun 28, 2006"
3.54,-0.6,3.5,2,4,3.5,4.5,"A solid American Stout. Thank you for your unending generosity Ken. I appreciate it.","HoustonTX","Feb 18, 2006"

3.27,-8.1,4,2,4,3.5,3,"Bought this on sale at Trader Joe's, where they're pushing "Irish" food and drink this month 'cause of St. Paddy's day. This is an intersting beer, definitely not run of the mill. About the color of Coca-Cola, it pours out thick, with a tall, creamy tan head. Smells a bit sour; tastes "earthy" and somewhat on the bitter side. Not a session beer, however. More the kind you'd drink one at a time. Should go well with rich and heavy foods. Overall, I'd give this about 3.5 points on a five-point scale, and maybe I'll buy it again next March ... but I wouldn't drink it on a day-in, day-out basis.","DFN","Feb 23, 2004"
3.62,1.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall: One of those weird singles that I picked up at Trader Joes for next to nothing, I think it was about 86cents all told. A nice tasty effort from Lost Coast Brewing Co., but a tad too dry for the long haul.","TheLongBeachBum","Sep 29, 2003"
3.22,-9.6,3,3.5,3,3,3.5,"A nice beer. I prefer a sweeter stout, but I enjoyed this dry style. Worth a try if you can find it.","winomark","Sep 25, 2003"
2.94,-17.4,4,2.5,3,3,3,"This brew was a real strange one for me. "Dry" almost doesn't begin to describe the mouth-imploding desert-like character to this beer.

There is a very slight metallic flavor to this beer, not unpleasant. Nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. A nice dry stout.","beerguy101","Jul 24, 2003"
3.43,-3.7,3.5,3,3.5,3,4,"I originally sampled this beer on 4 May 2003. I am writing this review from my notes. This wins the "bang for the buck" award in my book.
