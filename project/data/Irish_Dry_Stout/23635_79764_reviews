"Dry. Not much aroma. Slightly smoky finish."
"I really hate being forced to write a review since thats not what i do.  just let me rate the beer?  anyway didnt like this.  there was a very unpleasant bitterness that made this almost undrinkable.   could just be an old bottle."

"An above average offering from Lavery.  The aroma and flavor are good but the minuscule head and absence of lacing, coupled with the watery palate, lower the overall appeal of this beer."

"OV: This is a solid Stout with the addition of the spicy rye adding a nice little dimension of depth to the typical Dry Irish Stout flavours. If the coffee notes were stronger I'd be enjoying this even more, but it's good. I'd have this again."

"A great looking, great smelling stout that falls a little short in the taste department. Average mouthfeel as well. Makes it disappointing ultimately, wish there was more flavor and body. Not bad though, just left me wanting more."

"My bottle says 5.6% abv."
"OVERALL: Mild in its ways, but very agreeable, this was an easy drinking, well brewed beer from Lavery. I would be interested to see what age would do to this, I believe it would sour a good bit from the house yeast employed."

"O: I really liked the spicy nature of this beer as it wasn't just a one dimensional stout with roasted malt flavors. It is quite drinkable."

"I like the beer.Good taste and a great draft beer. Worth sipping and enjoying. Gotta be the right temp when served. I tasted the beer the first time at the Crossroads restaurant in Edinboro, PA. My comment length is t o short so I will add some additional stuff so it meets the comment field requirement for number of characters."
"It's not much, but it was worth trying. Love to see fun locals on-tap. 3.5"

"Overall: Refreshing - really like the mouthfeel here; also like the way this one finishes very dry; the brewer knows how to brew a well attenuated beer"
