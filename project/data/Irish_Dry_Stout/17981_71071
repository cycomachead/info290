It has a milk chocolate smell with toasted oats, pecans, and cream, but I only pick up on those flavors if I stretch myself -- it's all rather subtle. The taste brings cocoa powder, coffee, burnt toast, and bitter hops. It goes down silky smooth with a super dry finish and is on the lighter side of medium in body.","itsscience","Apr 04, 2014"

Aroma is mostly roasted malts, with notes of toast, coffee, and slight hint of smoke. Taste is more roasted malts, creamy milk chocolate, mild coffee, and cocoa. Body is a bit thin, but the nitro gives this one an incredibly smooth mouthfeel. Moderate bitterness. Another quality beer from CCB.","Florida9","Mar 03, 2013"

Super smooth drinking, but a little watery for me. Dry finish and easy drinking. Not much flavor besides some vague roasted malt here, which is unfortunate after the incredible aroma. Wondering if they accidentally poured Guinness, though I know this is a dry stout. I just expected a bit more flavor on this one. Not bad but meh.","BMMillsy","Feb 16, 2013"

This probably won't surprise most of you, but I had this next to a Guinness and it was not even close! The Guinness was way sweeter and less dry, more watery, and just less flavorful in general.

3.78,-6.4,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Poured on-tap at the Cigar City Brewing tasting room in Tampa. Served in a pint glass, the beer poured a jet black coloring, looking like motor oil in a glass. No head. The beer has coffee aromas, with a light and slight smokiness. The flavor is light coffee initially, with a huge blast of campfire smoke at the end. Aftertaste is all smoke, with a slight coffee bittering. The beer's finish is a moutful of campfire coals. Great, dry, and light bodied. Bravo!","GarthDanielson","Jul 16, 2011"

4.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The mouthfeel is fairly full bodied for an Irish Dry, and has the excellent drying on the end that's the hallmark of the style. The drinkability suffers just a little bit for an Irish Dry, for something that's usually a bit lighter bodied and easier to drink. Don't get me wrong, it's still a very drinkable beer, but it doesn't go down as fast as some in the style. A very good beer that I'm excited to see bottled.","shand","Jul 15, 2011"
4.55,12.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Poured into a pint glass. Pours a nice dark brown with a slight tan, tight head.Smells of coffee and dark roasted malts. The taste is great! It's tough to describe but "tight" come to mind, probably the dryness of it. Also get notes of coffee with a slight smooth hop flavor. Mouthfeel is light to medium. Chalkboard said this was 5.2% abv which was perfect. Love this beer.","kbutler1","Jul 15, 2011"
4.25,5.2,4.5,4.5,4,5,4,"D - Very nice, this is a really interesting alternative to the traditional black brew of St. Patrick's day. It has all of the roasted dryness expected of a traditional Irish stout, but it has so much more depth and complexity. The spicy notes of coffee and clove that I taste are something much more interesting that you would ever expect to find in an actual Irish stout, while the notes of chocolate are such a break from tradition that they almost seem out of place but end up being a very welcome addition. Despite being served on CO2, the beer finishes with a dryness that is every bit as profound as the classic examples of the style, and it effortlessly presents a thick, silky body that those beers need nitrogen to develop. A really nice dry stout and proof that Cigar City can turn out complex, excellent beer without having to do anything "extreme".","nickfl","Jul 15, 2011"
