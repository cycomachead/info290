4.1,9.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"330 ml bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours nearly pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, coffee, molasses, light herbal, and roast/bready earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roasted/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light molasses, light herbal, and roasted earthiness. Good amount of sharp roasted/earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, light molasses, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance, robustness, and complexity of roasted/bready malt and moderate earthy hop flavors; with a crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming presence after the finish. Overall this is an excellent dry stout style. All around great balance and complexity of roast/bready malt and moderate earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 30, 2014"

3.66,-2.1,3.25,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"I'm very excited to try this newcomer to my local store, straight from Ireland. Wrassler's pours a solid black, letting only a faint amount of light through. It's tan bubbly head rises to about 1/2" initially, but quickly fades to a thin sliver. There's not much lacing going on here, either. The aroma is pretty promising, and telling of the overall worth of the beverage. I'm picking up a lot of bittersweet molasses and unsweetened chocolate. Maybe a little vanilla. It seems pretty straight forward. And the taste is as well. There's the aforementioned aspects, along with an almost overbearing sharp bitterness that cuts through. Fortunately, I like bitter flavors very much, but this could put some people off. I also don't think it's the best thing for the style. It still is pretty smooth, light, and drinkable though. Not bad at all, but give me a Brooklyn or Sly Fox dry stout instead.","Neorebel","Jun 01, 2013"

Dark, smoky and sweet, malty aroma. It just SCREAMS stout. Taste is on point. Slightly sweet on the front, silky and dry across the middle, with a really smoky bitterness on the back. Lacing down the glass is nice as I get further in. I LOVE the smokiness in the flavor. Mouthfeel is refreshing with the right amount of carbonation to be refreshing but still suitable for the style. Finish is bitter and satisfying with the smokiness hanging around just long enough. Once again, I can't overstate how much I enjoy the AROMA of this beer. I will buy this again for sure.","jgurley","0"

The taste of the beer has a pretty good roasted flavor to it, kind of creamy but also dry. The mouthfeel of this one wasn't too heavy, I found it to be drinkable.

3.6,-3.7,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"A strong pour gets you over two fingers of whipped up and semi-delicate larger bubbles, very dark tan to lighter brown in hue, leaves an intricate web of thin lacing behind around the entire glass sides. Pure black liquid throughout, up against the glass you can see tiny bubbles rising swiftly. The nose not quite roasty but heavy on the malts with coffee, dark chocolate and mocha components, supplemented by caramel, leesy yeast, sour milk and a bit of peat and earth, some undistinguished black fruits, not much lift but what is there lasts pretty well. Medium-bodied with a hard steel posture, stays rigid for no apparent reason. Dry with a creamy mouthfeel from the carbonation until the “bitter end.” Burnt cocoa, powdered dark chocolate lead with a slight sweetening effect from the honey, toffee and prune, plum to cherry fruit. Momentary glance of sour grapefruit to orange citrus. Hay, straw, grass make an appearance. Relentlessly dry and bitter, keeps kicking long after you’re down and stopped fighting back. Even if exaggerated, stays true to the category but hard to imagine putting yourself through more than one in a sitting.

Jet black pour with a delicate tan head that floats around up top for most of the session. The aroma is alive with roasted malts and grain and a moderate coffee scent.

The taste is heavy on the coffee flavor, to go along with the aroma. There is also an earthy undertone, with a little bit of sweetness, and a bitter bite to the aftertaste. The aftertaste also has a hint of dark chocolate, along with the coffee again. The beer is actually smooth and light for a stout, with a very dry finish.

Color is basically an opaque black brown (basically because only at the very base of my beer glass where it's very narrow can I just barely see thru the clear garnet colored brew). The aroma is a very well balanced and pleasing blend of roasted barley, malt, coffee, cocoa, pipe tobacco, dark worn leather. Flavor's like the aroma plus there's a bit of sweetness against the dry bitterness of the other ingredients. Plus there's a bit of tang from the acid of the carbonation. Body is full, round, mouth filling and yet the carbonation is exactly where it should be to complement the other qualities. Finish is like flavor and slowly fades with no off characteristics at all.

Dark blackish color, like charcoal. Intensely thick creamy head atop the body. Wonderful ground coffee smell. Really had the roasted barley flavor that marks the makings of a quality Irish stout. Super thick and luscious body due to the nitro. Very enjoyable on the palate. Easily drinkable and of course it had the low abv known for the style.

Smells roasty and creamy, and fairly mellow. There are some light hops underneath and a touch of light sweetness. Overall the impression is that it is creamy and dry with an edge of roasted notes. The taste is a bit roastier and less creamy with coffee bean and bitter chocolate notes and very little sweetness. Very dry, and even a little austere.

So yes, chocolate is a big theme in Wrasslers, both on the nose and in the mouth - though I am not sure of the purpose of putting beer on one's nose, I will strive to discover it though. Despite the big, smooth chocolate flavours, there is a good dose of bitterness to counteract that, I am guessing the Galena hops are responsible there. Simply put, this is so much better than the beer I had on a nitro tap, and I am very glad I have a good stock in the cellar.","velkyal","Apr 27, 2010"

4.1,9.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"D - In some ways, this is a one dimensional beer. The strong, acrid roast character is the dominant, and at times only, flavor in the beer. This may prevent the beer from achieving a great level of complexity, but it is pretty much standard for the style and what the roast character lacks in depth, it makes up for in intensity. The roasted, charred, acrid bitterness of this beer is much more powerful than that of other "classic" examples of this style and that allows for a more enjoyable drinking experience as the beer pulls a surprising level of nuance out of this monolithic flavor profile. There are some hints of bread, caramel, and even smoke, but these are largely relegated to a supporting role where they are only called in at crucial moments to balance the acid roast character when it threatens to overwhelm the palate. Overall, an enjoyable example of the style with a sharp acidic roast character and an intense dryness to the finish that whet the appetite and make it a nice aperitif.","nickfl","Beers"
