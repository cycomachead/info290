"I will start with Amazing! First Bar Harbor Brewing offering I've ever had. One of the best and most unique Stouts I have ever had. Pours almost completely black with some red highlights. Creamy tan head with light lacing that fades quickly. Upfront tastes of bittersweet chocolate and coffee. Fades to plum, raisin and toffee with roasted malts and smokey notes. Just a bit of hops with a dry easy finish. Very complex yet extremely easy to drink. A new addition to my top ten beers. I highly recommend that you give it a try if you can find it. Picked up a six pack at Giant Eagle Market District in Pittsburgh."

"Overall: This is easily the best Irish dry stout iv had, and its an American beer. I think thats quite an achievement. Im not typically a fan of this style, but this one is an exception. Its very complex as i get chocolate and coffee, and undertones of dark fruit, smoke, tobacco, liquorice, etc. Definitely a world beater in the Irish dry stout category, and its not hard to find at all in western PA as i see it at Giant Eagle and my local beer distributor regularly. Cheers!"

"Straight up Irish dry stout. Good flavor with a roasty linger."

"Had on draft as part of flight.  My favorite of the group."
"Off bottle? Wildly overcarbonated ... and this for a style that is supposed to be low carbonation. Prickly feel and thin."
"4.24 | 94 | A-"
"An odd metallic finish and light fluffy consistency but unremarkable outside of being a dry stout"
""

"Overall-didint blow my hair back but a very nice take on the style. definitely worth giving a shot."

"How bizarre - I never heard of this beer out of Bar Harbor.  I didn't think anything happened in Bar Harbor. This beer though was a great find at Bauer as I planned on grabbing a coffee, and this replaced that non-alcoholic idea with something much better.  Took it home immediately (hopefully someone else will buy groceries) and poured this amazingly dark beer with little head or lacing.  Such a great coffee smell with hints of other things I can't identify (I think I smelled an old tire), but this was so smooth and perfect.  Not very alcoholy, but a nice malt balance.  This was great.  Perhaps I will visit Bar Harbor for some when they get a road."

"An exceptional stout. Slightly metallic, but malt complexity and a porter-like aftertaste."

"Fantastic beer from Bar harbor. Great tastes of coffee and chocolate with a thick thick head. Excellent stout all around."
"This is just one more fantastic beer on a long list of beers I wish I could get down south. top notch Stout made by very nice people, the fact that they refuse to deal with distributors(crooked a$$holes) is understandable. I miss the old labels for all of there beers. any back to the beer, nice thick head with the classic pitch black body that light cannot penetrate, a very nice toasty coffee flavor with chocolate nutty flavors present, nice smooth and thick mouth feel. a true pleasure to drink"

"Great. Will have again"

"Had this one after several other top flight stouts in the same evening. It certainly stood up to the others and to the hype. This is an excellent beer."
""

"12oz bottle pours deep, dark black with brown clingy, lasting head. Nice lacing as this quickly disappears. Toasted and chocolatey goodness. This is first-class stout."

"Nice!"
"O - Trying to learn BJCP guidelines and this one pretty much seems to hit home with the Irish Dry Stout catagory. The only thing I don't see described is the bit of alcohol aroma and taste. Bar Harbor Brewing beers were my entry into craft beer and I forgot how good they are. Although I wonder if the quality has gone down a touch since the brewery was sold from the original owners years ago."

"I've been looking for this one for a while, a personal white whale for me. It's not really rare at all, so I guess I could say it's more like my white porpoise or something."

"O: I have been looking or this beer since the yellow narrow Ratebeer ticker book came out years ago, and this beer certainly exceeded my expectations -- I can see how it might be considered an ""imperial"" dry stout -- it packs a ton of aroma and flavor into a 6.7% beer.  Unique in execution and worth looking for."
""
"This is a very enjoyable dry stout. The chocolate is the key to this one. The roasted nut finish is a nice follow."
""
""
""
""
""
"Similar flavors of char and chocolate in the malt, but has some assertive hops to balance.  Thick mouthfeel but not cloying.  Leaves the palate when asked to move on.  One is enough, but a nice beer overall."

"Overall: This beer has earned its reputation as a sought-after craft stout. Do yourself a favor and find it if you haven't. Bold flavors, good density, terrific aromas. Great stuff."

"O: pretty darn good... American sensibilities, for sure... I'd love to have this on tap either around town here or at the brewery... probably won't seek out another bottle though"
""
""
""
""
"Overall this really is an outstanding beer. My experience puts this near the top of perfectly balanced darks, and certainly one of the better stouts that I've had."
"o: A good stout, but the lingering bitterness at first detracts from the experience, and it seems a bit light on mouthfeel for a superior stout. On the plus side, the relatively low ABV allows a full glass will not put you under, and it's pretty easy drinking, especially later. It's also possible the aging on this particular bottle (it was purchased in early July 2013) did not benefit the flavor."

"Aroma is a subtle roastiness. Smells fresh, alive. Vinous, with a touch of fruitiness tucked in there. Waaaay in the back. The taste is a creamy slightly sweet oh god it just slipped like smooth and velvety down my throat. But not like velvet. It's like the carbonation is so fine and light that you get this amazing mouthfeel. Oh, but the taste is a subtle creamy sweet light roastiness with hardly any hop flavor and mostly light coffee (the way coffee with a little milk tastes, or coffee milk, if you're from RI) and in a way, like milk. This beer tells you you are drinking something special, something good. Slight roast malt sourness inthe aftertaste, but even that makes you aware of the complexity. Some bitter chocolate."
""
""
"Overall, really a very nice dry stout. This beer should take the place of Guinness in every bar out there- there would always be a good choice on hand! Straight forward but very good."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty darn bland if you ask me. Will quench a thirst though. I bought quite a few on a recent east coast trip. The recent reviews were decent enough and the price is low. Will update if anything changes."
""
"This is a very nice stout. Not as creamy as a Guinness, but very tasty and packs a punch. Lots of head. The first pour was all foam. Had to wait until it died down, then poured out the rest and it was worth the wait. Great flavors of roasted barley and the right amount of bitterness. At under $6 for a 22 oz bottle, it's a great deal! Will definitely buy again."

"O: This is really good. Packs a lot of flavor into a relatively light stout. Drinks like a four or five percenter, but packs in nearly seven. Quick buzz is duly noted."
""
""
"O- I'm quite happy with how this one aged. I haven't had this one in years, but I'd say I like it more now than I did back in the day (even though I enjoyed it back then, too)."
""
"O: Held up pretty good given the age and only 6.7%. Super easy drinking, goes down so smoothly. Super smooth and creamy. Proper dry finish for the style. Easily the best irish dry stout I've ever had."

"My wife brought me back some from here trip up to Maine and I lined one up for the next day. Curiously, every bottle I opened exhibited quite a bit of foam leading me to believe there was something wrong with this batch. So, keeping that in mind I took some tentative sips before really drinking some down. While I do like this beer I have to say that it left me wanting a little more...robustness. I'm a big fan of stouts and I feel like I could drink quite a few of theses - in other words they didn't seem to fill my desire as they seemed to lack a little something that most stouts bring to the table. Still, a worthy beer."
"O: Very nice dry stout. Well-executed in all categories."

"Overall - Get this beer. Seriously."
"I've been meaning to try this stout for years now and I finally found a bottle of it. Blurs the lines of the Irish Dry Stout style certainly but I did enjoy it. Would buy again."
""
"Loads of malt and some molasses. It's delicious."
"12oz bottle. Pours a pitch black color with virtually no head. The aroma is earthy and booze with hints of chocolate. Minimal lacing.Tastes booze and earthy with some hints of dark cherries and bitter dark chocolate. Coffee grounds as well. Slightly floral aftertaste. Light mouthfeel with little carbonation. Very drinkable. This seems like a great summer stout. Overall, pretty good beer I'd grab every so often."

"Only when I made my way through the whole pint could I feel the alcohol. Yes, it's that well hidden and didn't detract from the beer at all. While this wasn't terribly strong or rich, this was a solid brew that held its own and served as a good example of what an Irish Dry Stout should be. It's not a session beer but I can't imagine anyone not being able to kick back with a few of these in one sitting."

""
""
""
"Kick-ass stout. I can't believe it took me until now to finally give this a whirl. Countless times I've passed up a cheap sixer of this stuff (mainly, because I wanted to try it, but couldn't justify buying a full pack for the same reason). I can assure you, that won't happen again. The six-pack will indeed come home with me next time."
""
""

"A decent stout, smooth and plenty drinkable but nothing special."
""

"A great desert beer that doesn't weigh you down. would drink a ton if it was on shelves near me. Sweet and creamy with a dry finish, hits all the notes. Best dry stout I've had, a pleasure to drink."
"O: Decent and basic. Perhaps I should have had it sooner."
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a very dark, full, amber highlighted brown-to-black coloring with a thin layer of light tan, frothy head. Aromas of light coffee, both roasty and bitter, with a heavy dose of sweet, creamy, milk chocolate. Flavors of more heavily roasted and bitter coffee, with the sweet milk chocolate serving more to highlight. Some touches of roast and smoke throughout to help give a dynamic to the palate. The beer is mid-bodied, but full and robust. Aftertastes of roast and bitter, with a warm overall feel. The finish is more of the bitter and roasty coffee, but smooth enough to refrain from drying the mouth. Very smooth drinker, and very tasty. Good brew!"
""
"O – Perhaps this beer was past its prime. Perhaps it was a bad batch, but this one really disappointed me. I’m not sure I will seek this out again."
"22 oz. bomber: This one pours an opaque, very dark brown color. There was a very small tan head on it that didn’t linger long. Almost no lacing. Nice nose. Pretty full or aroma, but mainly chocolate and roasted malts. Some coffee notes also. The taste is good. Roasty, chocolate, and coffee mainly in the taste. A very nice stout!"
""
"O. This may just be the best stout I've ever had. It is so flavorful and refreshing and not too tart. Fantastic."
"Overall: Very well crafted beer. Simple, yet complex flavors give this beer a terrific feel and taste. I have had it several times and I have always enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer was awesome. If Guinness tasted anything like this I would be drowning myself in it. I wish that I was able to get this beer regularly. Just the perfect easy drinking stout. I see why this used to grace the top 100 back in the day."
""
""
""

""
""
"O-Bar Harbour, I'm going to keep my eye on you. This beer impressed me. Has to be the best irish dry i've ever had. the flavors are strong and awesome and its easy to drink."
""
"Overall, a very good, non barrel-aged, everyday stout. Beats the hell out of a Guinness, but not quite the level of Founders' stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"M - This is my first dry stout and probably my last. The dryness takes that afore mentioned nice choclate taste and turns it sour. I gave this a 3.0 because I didn't think it fair to pan it as apparently a dry stout is supposed to do this."
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: The relatively high alcohol for a Irish Stout makes it less drinkable than you would think. The carbonation is also a hindering factor."
""
""
"Thanks to Greg for this one!"
"Cheers!"
"O- Normally, not a huge fan of this style, but I found this one to be very enjoyable."
""
"O: This is a real nice stout for the summer, lighter in body and lighter in alcohol than a lot of the others available. I found this to be very enjoyable and I would definitely have it again. It is easy to drink and reminds me of time spent in Maine (where the summer evenings still get cool)."
""
""
"This beer pours black with a thin, tan head and lasting lace. The aroma is of coffee and dark chocolate. The flavor is mainly coffee with some toast, mild smoke and molasses notes. There's a noticeable hop bite but it's well balanced and the chocolate flavor comes through as it warms. The mouthfeel is full and smooth. Bar Harbor Cadillac Mountain Stout is a good, filling brew. Recommended!"
"O - This is the best stout I've ever had. I have others I like, but this one is great in every way for me. I think the minor head, and slight carbonation are a positive feature. The taste is so complex, I think too much more carbonation would ruin it. Just open your mouth a little to get some air in there and it works better -- so much character to reveal."
"Overall I was quite impressed with this one. Not too sweet to become cloying yet not too bitter and abrasive with roast or hops. Worth picking up."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and goes down easily. It would make for a good selection if you want a really nice tasting stout but don’t want something that’s really heavy and needs to be slowly sipped. For this reason, it makes for a good stout to have during the summer."
""
"Totally black in color with a thin beige cap. Mellow roasted malt and vanilla aromas. Velvety smooth, delicate feel, with rich, lazy carbonation that builds thru the middle to the end. Dark roasted malt flavors up front that transition to a brief, dark fruity sweetness. Hop bitterness yanks that taste buds away from the sweetness thru the middle. Roasted malt flavors return down the homestretch with a ripe fruit flavors underneath. Earthy delicate flavors from start to finish. This was a pleasant surprise. Pleasant, delicate aromas along with a unique and complex flavor profile."
""
"D: This may not be the best stout ever made, but it is definitely a stout-lover's stout."
""
""
"Overall: This is just a well made American stout."
"Great drinking non-impy stout here, the world needs more of them. Could drink this all night long...loving on the roastiness. Thanks a bunch for the long time want mnbearsfan!"

"A pleasant and powerfully flavored stout, but your taste buds will have to judge as to the world class potential. Quite drinkable, but very bitter and intense. From the 12 oz bottle bought at Monde Market in Philadelphia."
"O: Definitely a good brew, and one I would pick up if it became available down here."
""

"O - Smell and taste are great and it drinks easy."
""
""
"Overall - A nice beer, excellent balance and great drinkibilty. Its the only bar harbor beer ive had, and it makes me want to try there others. Great brew, really nails the style head on. Worth a drink for sure."
"O: this was a pretty good brew. I've had it before but wanted to give it a fair review. I would definitely have this again."
"Served in a nonic, completely opaque dark brown-black, and no head whatsoever, aside from a tiny ringlet that petered out in a minute or so. Nose is full of roast: coffee, dark chocolate. More of the same in the taste, with dark malts, dark chocolate, and coffee roast dominate players, and maybe a touch of sweet dried fruits in the background. Slightly bitter in the finish. Medium body, pretty smooth, and decently drinkable overall, but nothing really distinctively amazing going on here."
""
""
"Believe it or not I found one of my white whales in Pittsburgh, at a Giant Eagle. I would have never thought a beer like this would show up at any grocery store...I've been looking for it for about 10 years now. Pours a pitch black color with a billowing tan toffee colored head, fine even lacing is packed in my imperial pint glass. Aroma has milk chocolate tones, mild coffee roast bitterness, and some dark roasted malts with a hint of soft oatmeal. Creamy, dark, herbal hops a few components that come together perfectly. Complex fruity notes arise as it warms, dark chocolate roasts, and hints of coffee beans add a nice roasted malt quality...again a bit subdued in today's age of chocolate, coffee, oatmeal stouts aged on maple syrup and oak barrels. This is no frills amazing stout, get some find it trade with me whatever it takes to get down with this caliber of straight forward God's honestly good beer out there. Flavor has a nice charred malt flavor going with depth and complexity of mild fruitiness and a touch of acidity. Mouthfeel is velvet smooth texture with even ample carbonation a great beeron the palate that lives up to all expectations. It think this was 11.99 a six pack in the Burgh, but it was well worth it I'm in love with this brewery especially this beer."
""
""
""
""
"O - I enjoyed this one. With all the powerfl super strong Imperial Stouts out there, I am getting into sessionable American Stouts more and more. This is certainly one I would revisit...and often!"
"Overall: B+/A-"
""
"Not something I'd go crazy for, but certainly a good example of the style. I'm glad I found a bottle during my Massachusetts trip."
"O: Gets more and more impressive as it warms. Incredibly drinkable and smooth. Highly recommend trying this if you can."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: If I hadn't been rating this as it fits the style I would have given it all 3's. Maybe I just don't like thin stouts (dry or milk), not sure, but this one certainly missed the target for me."
""
""
"An excellent example of the style. As noted, the carbonation is a bit too much for me. This would make sense as a nitro tap though."
""
""
"Overall I was not expecting much out of this beer. Man was I wrong. This is a superb stout!"
""
""
""
"I enjoyed this one. A solid stout that's got a lot going on inside."
"O - The age on this one played in favor of the beer...there was a subtle dark fruitiness that I thought could have shown up from the age but other reviewers have mentioned it...great roast and chocolate flavors"
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good beer, all around. I like the lingering smokiness in a stout, really adds a nice dimension. The mouthfeel could use some help to really make it stand out. Still a really nice beer, and glad I finally got the chance to try it."
""
""
"decent, but sorta smelled and tasted a bit stale? maybe an older bottle, but no way of knowing."
""
""
""
""
"Its a nice stout. Not RIS... Maybe Oatmeal, but it didn't nail the creamy nature of an oatmeal stout for me. I'd like to just call it an American Stout. Something simple, something nice."
""
"O - Nice stout. A solid roasty backbone with balanced hop character. Fairly complex. Good mouthfeel. A likely repeat purchase."
"The suggestions of fig and raisins give the beer more than a one-dimensional flavor profile, which is really nice. The chocolate is silky smooth and shows a nice level of sweetness. Hops definitely play a role in the fairly dry and bitter finish...kinda finishes like a Sierra Nevada stout. Good beer that manages to be both approachable and flavorful."
""
""
""
""
"D: Quite a delicious stout that I would enjoy again. Pretty easy-drinking which could be dangerous as it's approaching 7%, but that's a risk I'd be willing to take."
""
""
"Cost: $4.99 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle."
""
""
"O: A solid stout. Nothing too interesting, but very smooth and tasty."
""
"Overall I was glad I tried it, but I won't hunt it down again. A good stout, but there are much, much better out there."
""
""
""
"D - Good. Damn good. This is a fantastic stout. True to the style. I love it."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a very nice drinkable stout. 3.5"
""
" A nice, classic stout in all ways."
""
""
"O - Very solid stout, very drinkable. Would definitely have this again."
"Think of a nice Irish dry stout and then give it some heft with loads of chocolate and coffee and you have this offering from Bar Harbor. A quality stout top to bottom."
""
"O - A nice smooth stout, I am glad I got to try this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - a fine american stout. didn't look all that impressive when poured but its whats under the hood that counts."
""
"I need to buy more of this. It has a ton of chocolaty and burnt flavors, and it's very drinkable. It's surprisingly low ABV, too. It's well-balanced, and well-rounded."

"D - While all scores above have been a 3.5, the overall drinkability is a notch above... While understated in many respects, the 6.7% ABV that doesn't hammer you over the head in a way most American Stouts seem to is a pleasant surprise... Not my favorite, but defiantely worthy..."
"O: Regrettably I can't recommend this stout. There's not enough complexity, the booze seems to be without a cause, and the aftertaste is not very pleasant."
"Pours a dark inky black with cap of compact creamy brown head, doesnt last too long though, decent lacing. Scent is straight forward roasted grain with chocolate brownie and hint of vanilla. Taste follows scent in being very simple and straight forward, what it lacks in complexity it makes up for in execution. Dark roast stopping before any char presents itself, semi sweet baking chocolate stars, a touch of vanilla and the faintest notes of coffee and berry. Lower end of full bodied, smooth, clean and lightly creamy. Well executed stout greatly appreciated in a time where every beer in this style seems to be wanting to go ""big""."
"O- A very well done Stout. Really easy to drink and the palate grabs hold of all the flavor after a minute break b/w sips. Would like to try a Imperial Stout from Bar Harbor."
"Dr. Very good, but took a while to finish a bomber. Sippy beer."
"Pours an inkjet black that is entirely opaque. Very little light-tan head develops, and what does appear fades quickly. Some legs are left in the glass, and a hearty swirl breathes new life into a bubbly ring around the edge of the glass. A few patches of bubbles cling to the walls of the glass. It smells of coffee, caramel, roasted malt, some oat/grain, and a touch of sugar. Very stout-like. Taste is very similar, with plenty of roasted malt, some chocolate, grain, sugar, coffee, and caramel all making appearances. The mouth is very smooth and goes down easy, leaving a dry and slightly sticky finish. Overall, a good stout that is worth trying."
"4.0 D: Good brew. They should brew this beer like they brewed the one I'm drinking."
"o - overall, more porter like than anything else, but the body is way less fizzy."
"Want an idyllic Maine beer? This is the one."
"Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, dry and chewy. Drinks nicely, pretty solid flavor, although not too complex."
"O: Much better than what i was expecting, totally enjoyable, would definitely be a regular bottle for me (if it were around). not a ""life-changer"" but a damn solid brew."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderate. The base characteristics of this beer are all solid and promising, but there are some things that keep it from reaching excellence. The metallic notes are one thing, as well as the rather weak flavors in the taste."
"O: I've had several stouts in my time by now, and I'd rate this one as middle of the pack. It has all the bells and whistles of a stout, but not enough strength. Maybe with a good steak, this beer might have presented better. So be it."
"Very, very good stuff here. A great looking, full bodied easy drinking stout. Delicious."
"Overall my favorite dry stout to date and very drinkable. I spent my Labor Day drinking many beers and several of these were in the line up thanks to my wife's Uncle Charlie."
"Overall- this is a nice stout... But nothin to get too excited Orr in the trading world. I'd drink this if it were on shelves (or on tap) locally for a cheap price."
"22 oz. standard bomber with no freshness date. Pours straight black, with an indeterminate carbonation level and a half-inch of medium tan head that reduces to a well-retained collar which doesn't leave much lacing. Smells roasty, with mild coffee, cocoa powder, earthy yeast, and just a hint of papery oxidation. The flavor is fairly mild, and adds augments the bouquet with notes of green/oily hops and a creeping bitterness on top of a light, tingly, dry and chalky body. Tastes a lot more Irish than American to me as it is light and smooth - so much so that I don't quite believe the stated ABV. Easily drinkable and certainly worth a try, but I wouldn't go out of my way to track it down."
"Had a few Mother's Milks this week from Keegan Ales and thought they were solid B stouts...this one is one notch below. Certainly nothing profound here. Not bad but not great either."
"O/D: It has great roasted characteristic and a surprising hop acidity to it. Worth checking out."
"O-A decent stout however the mouthfeel totally threw me off, the lack of carbonation was a major turn off to an otherwise decent beer."
"Huh. This was unexpected. I've had this beer once years ago, and I certainly remember liking it more than this. The roasted and smoky characteristics seemed a bit overwrought for a supposedly straightforward American stout."
"OVERALL: The age on this bottle may have muted the flavors somewhat, but then again, given how well some other American stouts have held up, this one may have just been mild to begin with. Regardless, while this is not a life-changing, memorable stout beer, it is definitely a good beer that was enjoyable to drink, which is reason enough to recommend it in my book. Thanks again for including this one in our trade Masterski."
"D - A solid brew for sure. I was just up in Acadia and I figured I'd try this one with stout season coming up, and I now know that it will be a go-to all fall and winter long. Very good."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Guinness pint glass. This is the third beer from Maine I've been able to enjoy, after Allagash's Curieux, and Belfast Bay's Lobster Ale. This had a monster 3+"" head after a rather vigorous pour. Opaque, typical of a stout. Nice malted chocolate aroma with some hints of coffee and licorice (although muted). Taste follows the nose with more chocolate and a bit of toffee. This a bit on the thinner side. It doesn't coat your mouth heavily. The beer departs with a slight tinge of acidity/alkaline. Overall, this is a solid stout. A very easy drinker that should appeal to anyone who's a fan of this style of beer. I'd definitely go back to this."
"Awesome stout! This tastes a little like a milk/sweet stout but with some added dryness towards the end. Vanilla notes in the nose. Taste is sweet dark fruit upfront, molassas, burnt roastedness towards the middle. A nice intriguing dry bitterness at the end. A sweeter stout but still very complex. Chewy smooth mouthfeel. So drinkable. One of the best american stouts I have ever had! Ratings don't lie on this one!"
"fantastic stout. glad to have tried it. recommended."
"Overall impression: A solid stout that's well worth a try."
"M: Smooth and semi thick character. Great!"
"Overall, its good. Nothing is overly good, but its well integrated."
"A solid black concoction with just a bit of a tan ring on top and fair lacing. The nose detects mellow roasted coffee beans and fruity rhubarb with the prefunctory note of chocolate malt. Very tasteful. And speaking of taste, the flavor offers intense coffee bitterness and near grape juice/wine-like sweetness. But it’s definitely about the coffee, and there remains some chocolate idea in there with a fairly dry but aqueous feel and a little touch of creaminess. Carbonation is adequate with tiny bubbles in a medium-full bodied brew that really sticks to your ribs while remaining thoroughly drinkable. This a special stout that should easily appeal to all stout lovers!"
"O - Awesome brew! Thanks for the extra Andy! I owe you a few!"
"O: I don't know how some breweries find this kind of balance. This is one of those rare brews that defines the style. I've tried tons of the great ""American Stouts"" on the market: Obsidian, Kalamazoo, Central Waters Coffeehouse, etc., and this one is right up there with them... maybe even above them."
"O - Wow...great tasting stout overall. Simple flavors all blend well to create a beer that I'd seek out again."
"Overall - Very good dry stout, quite bold for the style. The mouthfeel was a bit thick but I would have that beer again."
"O- I can not wait to but this beer again and drink it. Maybe it was my good mood as well that made me like the beer so much. Either way, well worth the try and the addition to the burger!"
"Full body with somewhat coarse carbonation. Overall this one's pretty good. A well done accesable stout."
"overall this is a great stout. i'm usually swimming in imperials, so it's nice to take a step back and appreciate a well made regular stout."
"O: Decent stout – well balanced and smooth as can be. I think the would have even been better on tap."
"The taste starts with a mix of roasted malts. The carbonation fills the mouth and reveals a creamy roasted taste. The carbonation subsides and leaves the mouth dry."
"Overall: My first take on this beer was that it was mindblowing. I decided to drink a second bottle to make sure. the second bottle showed me that it's not a knock-your-socks-off kind of beer, but it's extremely well balanced and delicious to boot. Probably one of the best examples of the East coast IPA, and at $7-$8 for the 500mL, it's a solid find."
"Tastes are sorghum, some roast, coffee, rice, peach skins, hops, pecans, walnuts, watermelon seeds, alfalfa, light malt, dark malt, garlic, milk chocolate, nutmeg and a neutral slinky flavor. Smells like a stout that is a good stout with light chocolate textures and some nuttiness... me likey, likey, likey!!"
"O-A very drinkable stout. I've tasted others with more complexity, but this is decent enough. As far as I'm aware, it's only available in bombers, and at the equivalent of $13.64 per six pack, I can find better examples at a lower price."
"Cadillac Mountain exhibits choice simplicity. Well-crafted and flavorful example of an American Stout. An easy recommendation."
"O- Not a bad stout at all. Impressed with the nose and taste on this one, as it provides great bold notes for a stout under 7% ABV."
"Overall: Another beer that is not hyped at all but knocked my socks off. If you see it, it is worth getting."
"Pours very black, when held to light, garnet around the edges. Alot of coffee and chocolate in the nose. Very roasty flavor, nice chocolate notes, slight pleasant bitterness from the black patent. This is avery drinkable beer and obviosly well crafted. This is worth seeking out."
"Pours a nice brownish red. Lot of nice tan head. Smells really nice and roasty. Tons of coffee and smokiness on the nose. Taste just slightly sweet with a nice roasty character. Sweet and not dry at all on the tongue. Nice well carbonated mouthfeel. Overall pretty darn solid"
"O: overall this is clearly well made. Tasty, clean and delicious. Very enjoyable."
"O - nice smell and initial taste but a little hard to finished. Definitely worth a shot."
"O: An above average stout, one that I would drink again, but not earth shattering. The carb could use some work. Thanks again Mike for sending me this one."
"O: Great."
"Overall, it is an easy drinker, but there just isn't much complexity to it. I can take it or leave it..."
"Medium-light body, moderately high carbonation, seltzer like feel, very easy to drink... maybe too easy."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer. I'm still new to stouts, just kind of dipping my toes in them, but this is damn good and very drinkable. Glad I got to give this one a go."
"I feel like this is very very good. I want a 6 pack and i've never really wanted a 6 pack of stouts before."
"Overall, a pleasant stout with a nice blending of flavors. I'd drink it again if it was available, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
" A great standard stout. nothing mind blowing, just solid."
"O: Pretty good stout. If this was local to me, I'd be trying it on tap if possible. 4/5"
"Glad to finally have the chance to try this one. Pours dark brown, near black. Thin tan head. Nose has chocolate, dark malts and hops. Taste is well balanced. Light to medium body, well carbonated. A nice beer, but notthing spectacular. Good brew to was down a burger."
"Overall (Drinkability): I will admit, this beer has impressed me. I was going into this one expected just an average beer, but this is actually a damn tasty stout. It's a shame I only picked up one bottle. Next time I'll have to get more...and they'll be bombers too. Recommend."
"Thin on the palate as the pour suggested, the carbonation is a bit high, as it does unfortunately thin out the texture. Easy drinking and enjoyable, this is a solid stout that doesn't try to be too much of anything that it isn't. I don't know where they give out platinum medals, but I can certainly see how this beer could win some awards."
"Overall, I am a fan of this stout. This aged bottle doesn't quite live up to the once legendary status of this beer. I would drink it again, most likely fresh and certainly nothing older than a year old. I had samples fresh at the brewery, and I remember liking it more, but the time and place could have been a factor in that memory. People will tell you that the beer isn't as good as it used to be, before the brewery changed hands and (supposedly) the recipe changed. I can't really comment on that, as I wasn't much of a beer geek back when I had the original recipe and I don't remember how it tasted. Still, it is a very good stout that is worth seeking out."
"I give a Schlitz about Cadillac Mountain Stout."
"Smooth, sessionable drinker, but really lacking any outstanding punch - perhaps balance is it's strongest suit - but definitely not as striking as I remember."
"Pours with almost no head, half a finger at best. Black coffee colored body, clear, some deep red if held up to the light. Kind of a let down that the head dissipates immediately. A ring of lacing does remain. Smells quite nice, coffee, espresso, sweet malts, roasted barley, milk chocolate. Tastes is off roasted barley lots of it, some dry coco, some burnt sugar, sweet malts, toffee maybe as well. The finish is dry with some lingering oily bitterness. The taste on this not too bad but the lack of body confuses me. I kind of think of it as an IPA without the hoppy flavors and/or aroma. Again the body is medium/thin. Medium high carbonation. The dry finish and kind of thin body leaves this one lacking. $5.50 a bomber, purchased 5/2010"
"D: this is a very drinkable American Stout. It features all the flavors you'd expect in a stout and has a great balance."
"D: I must admit, I had this beer at an imperial stout tasting and this poor beer followed behind several much larger and bolder stouts. My review probably isn't doing this beer justice as it just could not hold it's own against it's larger brethren. However, I did feel this was still a good stout and certainly was the easy drinker of the bunch."
"Drinkability:This is a very solid stout, not extraordinary, but easy drinking and sessionable."
"Drinkability is inconsistent but at the end made me feel like I could continue. However, I would not suggest thinking doing more than 3 of these."
"M/D: Medium bodied, nice carbonation. Has a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Extremely drinkable, a really nice example of the style. Would love for this to be a staple in my fridge, too bad getting the 22oz bottles down in Delaware was a random happening."
"Bottle. Black pour, thin brownish head, quickly recedes into a ring with a bit of lacing on the glass. Aroma is chocolaty, some burnt toast, kind of light aroma (or heavy if comparing with Guinness Draught). Taste is the high point of this beer, taste of fresh bread (some toastiness) with a very well balanced sweetness - chocolaty/molasses. A hint of dry herbs (anise) to finish it off dry. Palate is very sessionnable, well dosed carbonation, medium-light bodied. Damn I'd love to have this on tap at my local bar."
"Drinkability: All the aromas and tastes described above are very inviting, and the aftertaste sits very lightly in the mouth, despite being such a 'heavy', bold beer."
"The CPJ"
"D- A very solid beer. I have heard that the small batch bomber variation is much better than the 6-pack variation and if one if to consume they must do so with a bomber. My local bottle shop has both and the bomber mentions right on the label that this is a small batch beer. Every sip makes this beer better. I really enjoyed this beer and I think the complexity is outstanding."
"D - Delicious and refreshing stout."
"D - Stuff is quite drinkable. This is a very nice American stout. There is a reason why this is one of the top beers for this style, its just that good."
"This was my first beer from Bar Harbor and I'm impressed. I will certainly try their other work."
"D - Decent, not great. A bit too thin and fizzy for a stout, but better then average. Give it a try if you have a chance."
"More of that in the taste. Thought this was a great example of a chewy stout that isn't uber high in alcohol. Reminiscient of Obsidian Stout in that they both have substantial malt, chewiness, relatively cheap and not over the top alcohol. Would definitely check this out if I could get it out here, thanks to jsilva for throwing this down."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable, good session beer."
"Overall this is a really nice beer. Definitely the best beer that Atlantic/Bar Harbor Brewing makes. When your looking for a really good Stout this a solid bet."
"Pours an opaque black with ruby color seen only if held to intense light. Has a brown 1.5finger head which dwindles to a thin layer of foam on the head. Smells divine. Toffee sweetness balanced by coffee bitterness and acidity. Somewhat smokey smell as well. Tastes of toffee, dark chocolate with a really coffee like finish which lingers throughout the tongue. Absolutely an outstanding stout-nothing like it. I loved this ""meal in a bottle"" from the first sip. Try it if you get the chance, it is one of the best stouts, ever."
"D - solid American Stout here. As previously mentioned, not the most complex beer out there, but one of the better put together American stouts I have tried. Big thanks to drezz77 for sending this beer my way."
"D - Not particularly inspiring, given the options."
"Generally I enjoy a heartier body when it comes to stouts but if you are trying to introduce friends to better stouts this is a high quality, well-crafted ale. Quite enjoyable."
"D - Not bad, but I won't be seeking this out again. Just not my taste when it comes to Stouts, particularly in the mouthfeel."
"Poured midnight black in my Cigar City snifter with a smallish off-white head that lasted just under a minute. Thin trail of bubbles is all that's left of it. Clear with amber brown hues in the light. Immediate waft of burnt toast and caramel. Touch of pale grain and this might sound really odd, but I get a bit of french fries and coffee. Word! Very roasty and robust. I can definitely taste the black patent coming through, followed closely by a deep grainy/nuttiness and dark roast coffee. The flavor is brisk, lasting as long as the beer sits on the palate, but finishes with a lightly ashy and graininess that lingers, complementing a dry finish, nearly astringent. Carbonation is kept moderate, neither prickling the tongue nor slicking the palate. Beautifully made. Thanks again dude!"
"Good Job Maine."
"The feel of this beer is pretty full bodied but goes down well. The nice bold flavors keep your mind on the great flavors and hide the ABV. A really great American stout."
"Drinkability - Relatively so, a pretty good stout!"
"D: While low for your average 6.7% beer, it's pretty good for a stout, and a very enjoyable drink too. This one did not last long in the glass."
"D: The drinkability is not to impressive, definitely not a beer I would want to drink a lot of in the future."
"D: Great. Pissed that i have to take a trip to Maine to get this."
"This is a really good stout, much better than I expected."
"Notes: Must try!"
"Fuller bodied run the 12oz with a silkier chocolate malt presnce. Slightly more smokey with more of a bitter coffee bean flavor. It also has a subtle lactic creaminess that the 12oz lactic making it more complex and quaffable. Hits of licorice and hazelnut before a bitter dry finish. Better balanced than he smaller bottle."
"Drinkability - I really enjoyed this brew. nicely blended and balanced brew , This is a very tasty stout"
"D - Not overly drinkable for a 6.7%, but this is a solid beer that I don't mind drinking. A good representation of the style."
"This goes down pretty smooth. I had it while relaxing after a nice piece of steak."
"Good beer for this style and would have again and has no feel of heavy alcohol. Easily drinkable and very enjoyable."
"A fantastic stout. Great balance and unbelievable depth for just a 6.7% stout. Hightly recommend."
"Nice smokey aroma and flavor, but overall rather watery. I prefer stouts that command attention, whereas this one seems to prefer sitting in the corner waving a little lace handkerchief: ""Notice me! No, wait... don't notice me!"" The smoke is heavy-handed (although I liked it) and covers any other characteristic that might be hiding in the beer. There's a salty taste here that would be nice if it were offset by something slightly bitter. If you like all-ham beer, this is for you. If you prefer balance... look elsewhere."
"The taste is oily on the tongue, fairly medium bodied, despite what the marketers claim on the label. The beer has too many charred flavors for my linking, not enough body, some biting notes, and is just okay. I will re-review just to make sure that I am not panning a beer without due diligience, but this beer just isn't great. More to come."
"Not bad just not my cup of tea. I could drink several...as long as you are buying."
"Notes: Tastes an awful lot like a milk stout to me. It's good and very easy to drink, but it didn't bowl me over. I have only ever had this in the 12oz format. I would like to try one of the bottle conditioned bombers. I think it would be much better."
"D: At 6.7% it's definitely good, but how far can stouts really go in terms of how many you can drink?"
"The taste is initially sweet and malty, no hops are detectable in the brew at the time I am consuming it. The coffee flavors/dark roasted malts add a nice dryness to the finish of this beer. This is freakin' amazing, what a nice treat. There is nothing I enjoy more than a nice balanced average ABV stout and this totally fits the bill. The flavors are extremely well-balanced. The mouthfeel is kinda light but still above average. I have nothing else to say about this beer. I could drink this until I passed out because it is soooo darn good. So so so sooth and silky. Seek it out and hoard for future consumption."
"Good beer and nice solid stout. I would not mind getting another one of these."
"This should be in as a Dry Irish Stout (and an A- at that) - it's hitting all the marks for dry stout which can't be an accident. Even still, hops character could be brought up a little within the style. Easy-drinking, but roast a bit too prominent and too quiet for its own good."
"D - Decent flavor but a bit dull due to the lack of carbonation."
"gobble, gobble everybody."
"After a disappointing first go at it last month, I tried it again, and was richly rewarded. Worthy of true beerfaring adventures."
"Poured a 22oz bomber into an imperial pint glass. Color was a completely opaque dark brown/black with a 2 finger bubbly mocha brown head. The head clung to the sides nicely, and settled down to a thin layer. Aroma was slightly malty, but nicely sweet. Small amounts of dark brown chocolate with a bit of lactose. Taste was a mellow sweet, slight bitter kick on the toungue that switched to a dark chocolate coffee flavor. Felt good in the mouth. Nicely carbonated, a hint on the thin side compared to many stouts, but not bad. Very drinkable. More like a drink and less like a beer."
"While good this isn't something I'd go out of my way to try again. I'd grab for something else local like Buried Hatchet rather than this."
"D: Overall a decent stout. Pretty much what a stout should be."
"I drank a six pack of this stuff and I enjoyed it. I really think this beer is better than the overall score it received from be, mainly because of its appearance. Also, the flavor is a bit more than a 4, but not a 4.5. Solid Stout overall."
"D - Good drinkability for a big stout. Nice flavor, awesome mouthfeel. Of course we ticked to be sure we've secured it should it pops back on the top 100. :P Thanks again for sending this my way Keith!"
"Eric, we gotta get another trade going one of these days! Cheers!"
"This beer made me stop and notice how the complexity and finish was a step above most others of this style. Lovely smoky roasted malt falvour coupled with a tight chocolatey finish that seemed to go on for way longer than expected. Class beer that lives up to its rep( check all the beer books from the early 2000s and this is well regarded). Great beer but sadly it was brought back from Maine in a suitcase"
"D- its not too bitter like some stouts can be, which is good. Tasty stout, but there are better options out there. Glad I tried this one though"
"Drinkability is good. This is a quality stout. No nonsense. Just a well done, straight up, American stout with a bit of smokiness to it. Definitely worth picking up a bottle if you see it, but may not be for those that prefer a sweeter stout."
"While the flavor is a lot better than the nose led me to be, I find that I am quite disappointed. I was really expecting a lot from this beer and it just sort of fizzles out; it is nice and easy drinking, but isn't nearly as flavorful as I was hoping. I will happily stick to my ""go-to"" Kalamazoo Stout from Bells."
"Overall a great stout."
"Overall, I'm really liking this stout a lot. It seems like the RIS's, Double Stouts, and barrel aged stouts get all the attention these days, but its nice to have a plain old American Stout for a change. Simple, straightforward, and delicious."
"Notes: I had high expectations for this brew and it just did not measure up. I liked it, but it was not what I was expecting. Just too sweet. It is a good dessert beer and I hope to one day drink it again, but it won't be something that I strive to get often."
"Pours a very dark brown with a big rocky mocha head that eventually resides. Roasted chocolate on the nose, nom nom nom. Sweet cocoa flavor starts things out and transitions to a light bitterness partly roasted and partly from some subtle hops. Less carbonation than expected from the looks of the head and the mouthfeel is also a tad thin, which really only serves to make this even more easy drinking."
"Drinkability is really very good. It smells good, is quite tasty and isn't too much of a chore to drink with a light feel and a very well hidden ABV. I polished off my glass quite quickly and could have easily had another. A quality stout from Bar Harbor Brewing."
"D: This stout was definitely a solid beer. I picked this up while visiting in Bar Harbor and I'm glad I did. I have 2 others from Bar Harbor Brewing Co. and I'm excited to try them now."
"I am also a fan of Bar Harbor Brewing. Visited their little home / brewery a few years ago and the wife gave a beer lecture while the husband manned the brewing equipment in the basement and the daughter worked the gift shop cash register. Very craft and ""Ma & Pa"". Now they rent a shop / tasting room near all the action in ""downtown"" Bar Harbor - good for them!"
"Meh. Thanks for the shot, but if this is her true colors, our relationship ends after the first date."
"Pours a pitch black, near opaque color with a slick viscosity to it. Really silky as it purse and leaves a tiny tan colored head that recedes to a thin collar. The aromas are big roasty malts, some brown sugar and toasted marshmallows. E and dark chocolate follow. The flavors have a nice complexity to them. Has a touch of sweetness but bitter coffee backbone balances this out. A hint of vanilla bean and dry finish. Not overly carbonated mouthfeel which was nice. Really lives up to the hype for me as this is very well balanced and easy to put away. A home run."
"Nicely executed. Less bitter than more commercial dry stouts and that is appealing to me."
"D: Pretty tasty stout, although I'm not sure how many of these I would buy or drink."
"Pours a dark brown color with a creamed coffee-colored head. Roasted coffee in the nose with chocolate syrup and graham. Roasty flavor up front with more syrup and a smokey aftertaste. Light bitterness. Easy to drink, a little watery and short in the finish."
"D: Few stouts seem as well rounded as this one. Time to make a friend in Maine."
"Medium body and carbonation. What this stout lacks in complexity is made up in drinkability."
"It is modestly carbonated with a clean almost crisp finish. Some alcohol becomes apparent as it warms that blends very well with the roasty character of this brew. Very drinkable and smooth but has an increasing alcohol character that warms the back of the throat."
"This beer pours a ""Wesley Snipes dark"" to the point where light can't escape it and that ma-ma-ma-makes me happy! There is a thin tan layer of foam that is not long for this world on top. The smell is of some interesting rich characters. I detect whiskey, coffee, dark chocolate, pepper, tobacco and syrupy cherry. The taste is a super dark chocolate mocha flavor there is a little bit of maltiness, bitterness which seems to come from the coffee, and I believe there was a cigar tobacco style taste in the back. I thought it was a little flat on the tongue, but perhaps it was by design because this beer was a very smooth stout. I could very easily kick back a few of these with no problems at all"
"VDubb drinks faster than me. I can't wait for some of our future tastings (LZ Crew, what!)... This brew pours a dense onyx topped by a small outcropping of wan foam. The nose comprises large amounts of roasted malts, blackened pretzels, molasses, brown sugar, and a couple puffs o' smoke. The taste is very similar, with the roast kicked up a notch, some coffee and dark chocolate added, and the char upped a bit as well. The body is a very heavy medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a nearly chewy feel. Overall, a very nice stout, one i wish was actually available around these parts."
"Poured from a bomber bottle into my larger Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Opaque blackish color with dark tan head. Strong scents of roasted barley, almost burnt malts and coffee. This mouthfeel of this brew is smooth creamy, milky, almost silky. This is an outstanding brew. Dark chocolate flavors, cooked malts and coffee flavors. Mellow hop profile is noticed. I have drank this beer a number of times in Maine on vacation. This is bottle was left over from a recent trip. It paired well with a roasted turkey sub."
"4/4/4.5/4/4"
"Very good beer. Simple, straightforward, but with enough differentiation to keep it interesting. I likes."
"Note- since this has come out in 6pks I've picked up a few. Very drinkable. Great stuff coming out of ME."
"Drinkability -- Not too shabby. Great mix of sweet, dry, roast, and tart flavor elements. Not a game-changer for the style, but a quality regular ol' stout. Glad to have had it."
"Drinkability: Love the sourness of it, and if every bottle is supposed to be like this, then I would absolutely love to trade for more. However, since I doubt that, I would like to try another bottle to see what the differences are of one that doesn't have these tendencies."
"D: This beer is caught between an American and an English style stout and it thankfully represents the best of both. Great feel and amazingly complex for what it is. A surprisingly solid offering from an otherwise quite below-the-radar brewery. Definitely worth seeking out and trying though. Hugely drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is great, full bodied stout."
"D: Really great beer. A classic example of the style. Enough taste and the ABV is super reasonable. I would drink this all the time if I could get it."
"WoW!! This one makes me proud to be a native of Maine. Just an outstanding stout. Pours a jet black with a nice small tan head. Aroma is not much, maybe a little toasty coffee. Flavor is great, very nice sweet malt with just a hint of coffee. Hardly any bitterness from this one. Just a nice sweet toffee finish. Suberb! This is one of the best ever. This one is TOO easy to drink. Stock up on these when you see them!"
"D - Insanely drinkable. Before I realized it half of my glass was gone! I thought maybe the dog stuck her head in and snuck some when I wasn't looking but she's passed out snoring on the floor so I must have gone through it quicker than I thought! Wish I had more of this. I will definitely pick this one up again if I see it."
"A solid drinking stout, no issues having another!"
"D - I think this is one of the most drinkable beers, regardless of style. This is an all-weather, daily drinker, IMO."
"Drinkability: its drinkable, like I said before it could have been thicker."
"Into a pint glass, poured black, with a thin tan head, poor retention, but decent lacing. Very roasted malty and coffee in the nose, with some hints of cocoa powder and dark chocolate. The taste confirmed the nose, with the coffee and roast flavors somewhat dominating, and progressing to a dry cocoa powder finish. My big knock on this beer is the body; too thin for a stout, but smooth with very little carbonation. This would be a tremendous session stout if the body were just a tad bit thicker, but still a great stout nonetheless."
"MF/D: light sizzle of carbonation, smooth when it hits the tongue. smoky flavor overwhelms the tastebuds making this a singular beer."
"d-i definitely like it a lot. not my favorite stout, but it's damn close. excellent."
"M/D - Very smooth, light carbonation, great roasted malt flavors on the palate. Very enjoyable to drink. Up there with the best Stouts I've had. This has the typical characteristics of a Stout but they are all improved upon."
"Drinkability - Good carbonation for a stout which keeps it surprisingly drinkable. Could have three of these on a big night though I would be full. Truly a great beer sucks I can only get it once a summer when I actually present in Maine."
"Drinkability: Wish this was one of the old bombers... 12 ounces is simply not enough. Right up there with Kalamazoo Stout from Bells which this most reminded me of. With all the imperial stouts I find myself drinking these days its great to have a non-overpowering yet flavorful and smooth as this one."
"d- really great here. a dark very roasty beer that you can session. available at a great 6pk price. right up there with Sierra Nevada as one of my favorite really affordable American Stouts"
"D: Very easy to drink. In fact, mine disappeared way too quickly!"
"D: This is one of my favorite stouts, and I could drink it all day for the rest of my life and with every meal. Bar Harbor did a great job with this one, and I'm glad that Atlantic is keeping it alive as it was originally brewed."
"(D)- A solid stout that is so smooth and balanced; easy to enjoy and drink. I would have this over a Guinness any day."
"Wonderfully drinkable stout, and a shame I can't get this locally."
"This beer appears a near black shade with a nice, big head atop the beer. Retention and lacing are very nice, as well. This beer is very easy to drink. I already want to go out and buy more. This is quite possibly my new favorite lower abv stout. Roasted malts with a hint of coffee and perhaps even a splash of chocolate comprise the aromas and taste. Alcohol is hidden extremely well. Highly recommended."
"Cadillac Mountain is an amazing dry-ish stout from an otherwise rather average brewery. I don't know exactly what magic is going on in this bottle, but this is an exemplary stout, one worth seeking out and enjoying again and again. What's more, it's delicious. Three cheers all around to this American classic."
"Drinks ok- the less than stellar finish is tough to drink at times."
"Constantly let down by regular stouts, the mouthfeel is usually what turns me off, but with this one, I thought it lacked any pleasant tastes and the feel was just way off, I guess American Stouts really aren't my thing..."
"Beer is medium to light in body and really smooth. Beer is slightly bitter at the back end but finishes cleanly and isn't dry. A very nice tasting beer with high drinkability overall."
"D--I guess I have been on such an imperial stout kick of late that I may have been expecting too much from this brew, I was going to give it a 4 but I think my palate was not being quite fair to this one, and additionally, I may have served this a little too warm. Either way, this is a very solid brew and in terms of a more subtle, toned down stout, a terrific beer! Recommended..."
"Definitely worth getting if you're in the area. Unfortunately, they don't ship off the island, so if you're there, grab a case or two."
"Overall this was a very nice American Stout that is certainly worthy of its praise. Very glad that they have decided to distribute in my area. Recommended."
"Overall, a very good stout. Lots of interesting earth tones for me in the nose and palate that really made this one stand out. Try it if you can."
"World class big stout. The key here is complexity....sip slowly and enjoy"
"Flavor is not great, but good. Creamy milk and coffee. Almost resembles an iced coffee. Light mouthfeel, mild carbonation, not boozy in the least. As the beer warms, the coffee flavors become even stronger, but seems to bland out overall. But in the end, a decent stout."
"D- Insanely drinkable. I could do a few of these back to back. One of the most drinkable stouts Ive ever had."
"DB- A good price for a stout that has great drinkability. Before it's importation to MA I thought this one was gonna be bigger for some reason. Turns out it is just a dangerously sessionable stout with good balance."
"Overall, great brew! Not really my style of choice as I usually drink bigger beers, but I am glad I purchased a few more bombers as I will be visiting it again soon."
"Appears black once in the glass. Just a small head forms and quickly settles to a thin skim of bubbles. Some spotty lacing is left on the glass. Aroma has hints of bitter chocolate, coffee, and grassy hops. Not the most potent of aromas but smells ""stout-like"" anyways. Flavor follows aroma with elements of chocolate and coffee. A good malty flavored stout. I detect a bit of hops in the finish. No alcohol is detected. The body is not as full as I like in a stout. Just feels a bit thin and watery and not really stout-strength. Good flavor and very drinkable. Lacking in a few areas but overall a nice beer."
"drinks ok. would like a fuller, thicker stout experience to accompany the dark malt and coffee flavors."
"I poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a snifter. It pours an opaque obsidian with a moderate white head, bit of lacing. Sweet coffee and chocolate rule the nose, but very subtle. Sweet coffee and a hint of chocolate are up front. The flavor fades a bit with the lingering finish. The brew is medium in body, mildly carbonated, and a fine brew. An all around great American Stout."
"Picked up a 6-pack at Julio's last week, glad to see this available in MA now. 12 oz into a pint glass, this is my 2nd out of the 6-pack. An aggressive pour leads way to a huge (3 fingers or so) tan head, beer appearance is black. Eventually settles down to about 1 finger, very nice and creamy. Retains the whole time, but lacking in the lace department. Smell is unfortunately weak, reminds me of an Irish Dry Stout. Milk chocolate, cream. Not offensive by any means but there's not much to it. It's weird, the first sip is amazing but seems to go downhill after that. I'm getting faint coffee with cream, oats, rich chocolate. A small amount of hops noticeable. Tastier coffee notes appear in the aftertaste. Bitter finish. The taste is decent but overall it seems very average. Mouthfeel is fine, low carbonation, no complaints. Drinks easily and smoothly but I don't think I'd go out of my way to get this again. Overall decent but quite a letdown. If I did a blind taste test I would never guess this beer was in the top 100 recently. If only the whole beer drank like the aftertaste..."
"overall - i didn't care for this one much at all."
"This beer was a little hyped up before I tried it, so my drinking experience may be skewed. I think that over-all, it's a great beer that hits the nail on the head of a standard American Stout. However, I did not find anything absolutely outstanding about this beer. There is nothing wrong with it, but nothing extra special for me. Maybe I'm spoiled on Coffee Stouts and Imperial Stouts? I don't know. I can say I think this would be a great fall or winter sitting around the fire beer. I could definitely drink more than one in a sitting."
"d - I thought this was a very enjoyable stout and very easy to drink. Great chocolate smell and taste and could definitely have a few of these. Would love to have again."
"D- big on flavor but easy drinking and at 6.7 abv this one could go down as almost a session beer if your a big guy like me, but not quite."
"Im glad I tried this, it's not complex but it's something I would seek out from time to time. My favorite part is the french vanilla thing this has going. A light stout to celebrate the end of winter and looking forward for more. I wonder when Bar Harbor is going to come to Philly."
"F: Pretty dry, with just a touch of lingering sweet maltiness. With that is a long lingering roasted flavor, with a little more coffee and chocolate milk. Tons of bitterness and earthy charred malt flavors, with some tangy spicy acidic bitterness. Touch of sticky sweetness as well. With how drinkable it is and lower abv, I could put tons of these back no problem, the charred astringent earthy bitterness takes away from it a little."
"not bad, a little above average, the flavor dissapoints a bit."
"D- This beer drinks very good. The ABV is low enough to make this a couple bomber beer before going to something else. I have always wondered what made this beer get so high of ratings before and now I understand....this beer is very very well made!"
"Pours dark brown to black with a sparse whitish head. Smells of raisins and dry roasted barley. Tastes vinous with light amounts of roast and raisin. I don't know what it is but why is it so many highly rated beers are rated highly purely because of their similarity to wine? This is a good tasting brew, solid for a regional brewery. Feel is on the lighter side than I want, carbonation is medium-full. There are some good, clean flavors here and fairly light body makes it easy to consume. This is probably the best element of the beer, it is a stout with good flavor but also something that can just be drank. I'll drink to that."
"My first offering from Bar Harbor and its a good one. In this era of Imperial everything, I'm happy to find a nice well crafted stout that is nice and easy to drink and holds my interest at the same time. Very happy to try this."
"A session stout if there ever was one."
"Just a great beer and a good example of the style. If this were available in my area, I would definitely look for it just to always have some on hand."
"Consumed: 3/22/2010"
"Poured chocolate black with no head...no lacing. Mild coffee nose, coffee, chocolate taste, very light mouthfeel, almost watery, but pure coffee flavours infused with a touch of chocolate. I'd probably drink this again, however, I can't give this an ""A", I've had better stouts."
"Dark black colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is light chocolate.Taste is chocolate,sweet cream and smoked malts.A tad bit weak on the flavor but still a decent beer.I would recommend to try maybe once.I would buy again but not actively seek out."
"no bueno at all."
"D-Highly. Full of flavour with enough of everything to make it interesting from the very first sip to the end of the pint. Such a nice, relatively simple, straight forward drinking beer."
"Drinkability - A pretty drinkable beer. It's not the best stout around but I would definitely have it again. This is the 3rd or 4th time having this particular brew for me."
"Not really as dry as your typical dry stout, and way more flavorful than just about anything in the style. Overall really amazing stuff. Very drinkable and very awesome"
"D: This was a nice beer and one that I've wanted to try for quite some time. I'm lucky to have some more sitting at home."
"Cadillac Mountain Stout pours an inky black with an small but lingering tan head. The aroma is sweet, chocolatey dark malt with a roasted edge. The sweetness mellows out in the flavor with a nice rounded roasted character and plenty of carmel and dark fruit. Bitterness and more roasted, but not astringent malt comes through and the finish is almost creamy. Overall I think this is an excellent American stout, it's strong but not quite bordering on imperial."
"Pour is very dark brown, bordering black, with a light caramel head and some large bubbles. Nose is heavy coffee roast, slightly muddled roasted malt, a bit chalky and ashy, faint chocolate. Taste follows suite, heavy roasted malt and coffee, lighter chalky ash and a but more chocolate. Medium body, assertive carbonation, crisp dry finish with lingering roast."
"My notes say greatness and this truly was. An insanely drinkable full flavor beer with all the elements I love in American Stouts. What a beer - kudos to the Bar Harbor folks. Stellar stuff!!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied, slightly milky with a nice amount of carbonation."
"find it, buy it, drink it, enjoy it, and tell them Rick sent you."
"Overall, a very nice and well crafted stout. Love the roastiness in this one. Any fan of roasted barley and dark grains will be all over this one. A porter-like profile. Well attenuated and dried out without being too bitter, and a nice smooth chocolate presence riding underneath. A fine stout."
"All in all, this is a great brew if you are trying to get into stouts. It's a good gateway brew for stouts. Not bad to try at least once otherwise."
"Overall an excellent stout and worthy of it's high post on BA's list of American stouts. It looks fantastic, smells wonderful, tastes delicious, feels great on the tongue, and I could easily drink it all night. Now only if they would distribute out west!"
"a lovely dark beer black with the blonde topping. standardly sexy. it looks at me appreciatively as i gaze upon it. roasted barley, chocolate, smoke, the coffee flavor of black patent is all there. it has the body of charles barkley - thick and flavorful, with a dash of wit and cunning. supremely drinkable. bill is essentially making me compile a list of beers i can't get on the west coast that i will continue to want forever. what a great man."
"I guess I should have read some more reviews before jumping into this one. I'm really glad I got to try it, but I'll probably be sending out my other bottle."
"D- Like any good american or dry stout, I should be able to enjoyably drink a bomber by myself, and this is no exception. A very good stout, would love to try this one on nitro."
"Pours dark brown with a khaki head. The aroma is lots of chocolate and coffee. The flavor is coffee with a hint of smoke. You also get some roasted malt. The beer finishes very dry. Thick, creamy mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"D: Fairly drinkable, but a few beers into the tasting I was at (and after Firestone 13!!) nothing too spectacular."
"D: Great tasting and very easy to drink at just under 7%. This is just what I'm looking for in an American stout and consider myself lucky to have access to this beer at all times"
"D: Very high. Fairly-low alcohol to complexity ratio, so this is definitely one I could sip all day."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, but the flavor is so pronounced it seems bigger than it is. Not a bad thing at all. Carbonation is just right to keep things fresh. Solid beer and a damn good stout"
"Overall: A solid, tasty & easy to drink beer. Certainly worth seeking out if you can get your hands on it."
"Good overall drinkability. Well hidden 6.7% abv"
"D: A fantastically drinkable stout. Rich chocolate flavors and aromas abound. Make sure you swirl in all the sediment, it's delicious!"
"split bomber with PaulMPap the other night, first time trying this brew and was real excited. it didnt let me down but it was pretty different than what i had expected. pours a deep dark black with a tan little mocha ring for a head. smells of coffee, brown sugar, various chocolate pastries. smell was not overpowering though. the taste was well above average though. taste of dried dark fruits such as raisins, plums, and prunes right away. black coffee also comes through toward the end of the sip and gives it a nice bitter but easily sippable presence. it swallows easy and enjoyable, its VERY smooth and i cant wait to drink this again soon."
"Poured from a 22oz bomber picked up on my summer trip to Maine. Poured nearly pitch black with a nice tan head. Coffee and chocolate are the first things I notice in the aroma. Really enjoyed the taste, the bitterness, coffee and chocolate really make this enjoyable. Very tasty and interesting and I'm enjoying every sip of it. Mouthfeel is creamy and medium bodied. Very drinkable, I will be buying this every time I go to Maine which thankfully is pretty frequently."
"D = This is a very enjoyable drinkable stout. I would happily drink a couple of these at a sitting and will be happy to try it again, too."
"This is a rough & raw customer, though it's surprisingly easy to drink . It won't be long before I get the urge to rush up to Portland to snag some more. My first shot at this beer was a bomber, brought to me by a dear friend three years ago. I'm not detecting too much of a change now that it's being brewed by Atlantic."
"Drinkability - I am having an easy time sipping the bomber and wishing I had more. I'd love to return to this beer again and again - not overly complex, not overly simple."
"The Kings Of Hop"
"Glad I got to try this stout. I let this sit on my counter for 20 minutes before I poured it and it still required another 25 minutes to open up in the nose. It took even longer for the carbonation to settle down. Even with these issues, it was still a great beer."
"It's a stout! Nothing fancy here, just a really, really solid, simple American stout. Arguably the 2nd best non-imperial stout I've had (Ipswich Oatmeal being the first)."
"Decent stout, not epic in any way."
"M/D - Medium bodied with a stronger creaminess towards the end. Very enjoyable stout."
"Here is a dry stout. Tastes very close to the traditional Guiness. Unlike the smell, there is no hint of milk to the beer. Very bitter from the black patent malt (and, perhaps, roasted unmalted barley). Burnt toast flavors. The only detraction is thinner body and high level of carbonation. Great aftertaste of black coffee and burnt sugar (still not sweet)."
"D: Drinkability is the strength of this beer! At 6.7% abv and all the great flavor and mouthfeel this has 'big stout' qualities in basically a 'sessionable' beer! Gotta love the Caddy!"
"Tom and Analise"
"Overall, a great representation of a style so overlooked by this beer crazed community. A ""normal"" stout is something that is widely produced and widely accepted as a simple beer on this site. For Bar Harbor to make such a complex and enjoyable beer given the stylistic guidelines, I'd say it more than deserves it's stature among the beer greats."
"It is black with a large creamy head. Whhen it was all over the glass was pretty much clean with no lacing to speak of. All the flavours were there in both the smell and taste and they were all roasted: chocolate, dark roast coffee, - with an emphasis on the chocolate especially in the aftertaste. I like this stout. Kind of an afternoon de-light!"
"D: Pretty much lives up to its reputation... Bar Harbor Brewing Co. should take more pride in this beer than they seem to do. At their brew store in Bar Harbor, ME, they have posters up claiming it to be ""... the beer that beat Guinness!"" in a taste test. Big deal. I informed the beer pouring girl there that it was in the top 100 rated beers on BA... she had no idea it did that well. Time to start bragging more!"
"I know the ownership for this brewery has changed, it makes me wonder if the recipe for this changed as well because I am not experiencing ANY of the complexity mentioned in older reviews"
"Edit: Tried another bottle. Not as dark as I remembered. Didn't get the sournotes. It was very roasted with lots of coffee flavors. Good stuff."
"Very drinkable stout. Lower ABV with a great flavor."
"This is a very nice stout and would definitely seek this one out again."
"Flavor: Starts very smooth and subtle, little carbonation, transitions into chocolate and coffee balanced with subtle hops, ends with roasted maltiness, almost chocolatey on your tongue. Lacks a full mouthful throughout, but very tasty indeed."
"I poured this one into a snifter. It was dark black with minimal head and decent lacing and good carbonation. Smells much bigger than I would have expected. Rich roasty and chocolate notes. It tastes much like it smells with the chocolate and roastiness. It is very well balanced between the bitterness and the sweetness. It is a bit watery but there is no chalkiness present at all. Very smooth and easy to drink. What amazed me about this beer was that it drank much bigger of an abv than it was. Really impressed by that."
"This is bigger than me."
"this beer pours a dark black color with a nice tan creamy looking head that fades to patchy lace. the aroma comes through with all the nice roastedness that you could want. the taste has a nice chocolatey roastedness, and some really nice malt sweetness that's balanced by a bit of bitterness at the end. the co2 is a bit toward the medium side on this one, but with the full body it makes it a good drinker. this isn't the best stout that I've ever had but, it's pretty damn good."
"Very smooth, very creamy, easy drinker. Little extra carbonation gives a tingle on the tongue. Practically no alcohol detected. Very nice stout."
"The beer pours a dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice black and chocolate malt scent that gives off a bit of bitterness rounded out with a nice chocolate presence; perfectly balanced. The taste is great! This is so damn smooth. It's bone dry up front with a nice black malt bitterness. It goes down silky smooth with a light chocolate sweetness in the finish. This is a near perfect American stout. The mouthfeel is perfect! It's a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very good beer. I'm sorry it took so long to finally try it. Thanks to my mother in law for bringing it home for me from a New England cruise."
"i recently tried this among others from bar harbor brewing company on a trip with family to southwest harbor, maine. i thought it was excellent, i have to say that i was quite skeptical at first after trying some of the others like thundering hole, but was pleasantly surprised by this stout. the lacing was great and taste was better, it reminded me of one of my favorite beers...Sam Adams Cream Stout."
"Lots of roast to the malt profile, but nothing acrid here; Cadillac Mountain stout is as smooth as the glassy lake (or is it a river?) on its label. A bit overcarbonated and thin for a stout, again giving me more of a ""porter"" vibe, but that's okay. The dark chocolate and hops on the finish more than make up for any style discrepancies. Slightly drying finish, with an almost sour lactic note. Great beer, very sessionable for a stout, as the lighter body definitely bumps up the drinkability."
"The appearance is black with a very thin head. Aroma is mainly chocolate, very nice. The I get some roasted malts. The taste I get mainly dark chocolate. It is full bodied and the taste stays in the mouth for quite some time. Awesome taste. Carbonation is present in the mouth. Easy drink... at 6.7% it could be a dangerous beer. I will have to get more when I get back in USA."
"D - This is a very smooth and quite flavorful stout. Flavor level is almost at the imperial level, but lacking some of the complexities. For a dry stout, this is about as good as it gets. High carbonation is the only detractor to drinkability. Otherwise, this is very smooth, rich, and easy drinking."
"D: I enjoyed this one... its not massive in flavor, but as a 6.7% dry stout it was nice"
"This is a very drinkable beer and worth buying for sure. Like an Irish dry stout but with more balls."
"M/D: A bit too thin, but goes down smooth."
"Pretty good, a tad thin for my liking and a bit shallow in the flavors but not terribly so. Definitely an enjoyable beer."
"22oz bottle from a trade with belgianbeergal. This beer has been waiting about 8 months for me to try it, and it took a special occasion like this random Monday night to finally crack it open. The beer is dark brown and opaque with a thick frothy foam, large dry pillows which cling to the glass. The aroma is stunning, sweet malts and roasted malts, a hint of Baltic Porter, some dark fruits too. This reminds me somewhat of the aromas in Sexual Chocolate or Dark Lord. The taste is nearly equal to the smell, rich with sweet malts but not cloyingly sweet. The body, while substantial and thicker than water, seems light when compared with natural competitors based on the massive flavor. Very quaffable, highly drinkable."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle poured into a nonic pint glass. The stout appears an opaque deep black color with an inch of creamy ecru foam. The head leaves no lacing to speak of. Nose and flavor consist of rich roasted grains, cocoa, milk and dark chocolate, mocha, sweet caramel. Creamy and approaching medium bodied with ample carbonation for the style. A nice attempt at an American stout. Check it out if you have the chance."
"A nice stout, but I'm not sure it lives up to all the hype."
"M/D: Nice and creamy, though the body can be a bit thin. Wonderfully drinkable; not nearly as heavy as most other higher ABV stouts."
"6pack courtesy of Cool Mo'P. 12oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass -best before 12/09 notched on the bottle. Poured one shade shy of black with a dense, khaki-colored head. Nose reveals chocolate malt and a roasty character, with a hint of vanilla. Taste follows nose, but I'm also getting a little bit of coffee and some lactose. Mouthfeel is just shy of medium and a consistent background carbonation from start to finish that tickles the tongue without being prickly. Wow, delicious American Stout, maybe the best I've had. I've heard the 22oz. is better, but this is delicious."
"Overall: A huge thanks goes out to Mbrandon2w and Russpowell for both generously hooking me up with bottles of this fine beer. I liked it a lot. It is worthy of its place on the top of BA."
"Best stout I have ever had. This one caught me off-guard, wasn't expecting it. I admire the brewer for making a good beer, as opposed to a big beer."
"Overall, a fantastic stout. I did enjoy the chocolate deliciousness this beer offers, but still craving a little more complexity."
"This is a tasty, solid beer that can be enjoyed by most people. However, there's nothing really spectacular about it for me."
"You can probably consider this review as a permanent ISO."
"D) A good stout. The aroma is a little too bready. I'd have another."
"D: This is a flavorful beer that I wouldn't mind hanging out with some friends and polishing off a 6-pack."
"Appearence is opaque black with a slight tan head. It leaves nice lacing around the edges. The nose is a robust coffee and chocolate scent. A haevy dose of roasted malts as well. The taste is a dry roasted malt taste and some nice bitter chocolate.The mouthfeel is very dry but very robust. It's not as heavy as I would think. Overall it's very drinkable and one of the better stouts I have had. It's probably the best dry stout I have had."
"Drinkability - This beer could be a little more overpowering, but I don't want it to be. If I lived in New England this would be a relaxing every night stout I would sip on to ease into my late nights. A great easy drinking stout that doesn't give way in the flavor category. Very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Delicious flavor and thin body makes this an easy drinker."
"D: This is a big ole stout, but its pretty easy drinking because it is still a stout. Sure the flavors are big and they remind me of a much bigger beer. The flavors are just great and much bigger and more elaborate than what is expected from the style. Has that big ABV flavor without the big ABV, which makes it a nice drink on a hot Alabama night. Sure the feel is off, and it freaks me out a bit. Otherwise, everything else works so well. Damn skippy, damn nice. Big thanks to Larry for holding a bottle for me, damn fine."
"Thanks Adamdc"
"Drinkability: Maine's best beer, arguably New England's...Just a great example of what a dry stout should be. The alcohol is there, but not noticable. If something with a 6.7 ABV could be sessionable, this would be it...Just a great beer for the style and overall."
"D - Tasty!"
"Overall: The mouth feel is carbonated and dry. The Body of the beer is medium and finish is moderate. There is a nice wonderful flavor with this beer. It is a really good American Stout. There is a dryness to the beer and a very well made beer. I enjoyed this beer very much. The only complaint is the head didn't have much retention to it."
"Very thin, tons of coffee, some bitter chocolates. Not impressed with this. Very dry and just straight up displeasing for a stout."
"D - Pretty solid stout... nothing amazing but well-done overall. Cadillac Mountain features a prominent chocolate presence, which I found to be rather pleasant."
"Cadillac Mountain Stout is an extremely impressive beer. At least this one is. I've heard more than a fair share of criticism about the contract brews available in 12 oz. bottles. After trying this, I can only hope that a classic hasn't been completely tarnished. I'll reserve judgment until I actually try one of those bottles. As for this one, seek out a bomber while you can. It's truly impressive. I've sat on this 2006 or 2007 bomber for nearly a year and it's held up extremely well. Go find one."
"I could chalk up the appearance to the pour, which I thought was good enough, but maybe an outside factor is influencing this, because other than that, this is a world class brew."
"D: Very sessionable beer, nothing overwhelming. Mild and a very nice drinker."
"D - Dry finish and lack of bitterness from the roast makes this a very drinkable stout. Great beer."
"You can not go wrong here a well balanced stout with good flavor and excellant drinkability."
"A few chunks of milled barley in the bottom of the bottle - this one feels like an exceptionally well done homebrew, really. I just hope the new owner/used car salesman doesn't screw this one up, as the new brewer seems like a nice guy."
"Thanks to Rochefort10nh for this bottle! Pours a solid black color with barely any light coming through the edges, a large three finger tan head that left a small amount of lacing. Aroma is of dark roasted barley, hints of chocolate and caramel and it's slightly metallic. This beer has a wonderful flavor. There's loads of chocolate and coffee, light bitterness that's mostly from the roasted malts, a light sweetness is present, but it becomes very dry on the finish, and the taste sticks around for quite some time after the swallow. Silky smooth mouthfeel, carbonation is appropriately medium. It's listed as an American Stout on BA, but the bottle says it's a Dry Stout. I'll stick with the brewery's label. This is easily the best dry stout I've ever had. Thanks again Keith!"
"Overall this beer lived up to the hype. I can't think of a _stout_ that I've enjoyed more. Definitely worth a shot."
"I enjoyed this and would drink this again. I am glad to try it but i dont think i will be giving up anything special for it in the future."
"poured into my duvel tulip for a st patrick's day celebration, this poured a thin bodied black with an ever so slight red hue to it, their was a thick tan head that wont go away, the smell is coffiee and burnt malt, the taste starts out dry abd bitter with the rich malt taking the lead the coffiee flavor rushes in next and then a slightley sour presance makes itself known. at the verry end i am left with bitter chocolate and some alochal, this is a world class stout for sure, glad i started st patrick's off right!"
"Some great flavors, extremely clean, if not the most complex, and I love the drinkability of this one (damn you, Bud Light!)... but it's too easy drinking to really fulfill as a nightcapper, but too sweet to really be drank on its own. That said, I really enjoyed it, but now I need to go brush my teeth."
"Overall: A great beer...a must try! Cheers!"
"taste is great, nice sweet hints at first, followed by lots of barley bitterness. great mouthfeel as well, can really chew around in the mouth. besides the carbonation, its literally silk in a glass. well done bhbc, one of my favorite stouts. great feeling to be from maine and have such a great beer like this come from down the street."
"Thanks, mikeale, for the opportunity"
"I enjoyed this stout very much."
"D- One bomber of this stuff is just enough. It's too filling to have much more. I would if I could, though."
"Overall, I have to say this is overrated. For me, it was nothing more than a generic stout. It was so light though that I could easily session this."
"Not as full and heavy as it looks. Easy drinking sipper. No problem putting down a 22, and I'd have been pleased to have more if there were some."
"An excellent stout. It's actually a refreshing beer, probably because of the dryness. Interestingly enough, I have read that this stout used to be even better, which is kind of hard to imagine."
"Elder, 4.7, younger, 4.1."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Brother Thelonious goblet. This beer pours a murky black with a 2 inch beige head that melts away into just a little lily pad in the center of the goblet, leaving some seriously creamy legs when swirled. The aroma is just stouty. Coffee, vanilla, and some seriously roasted grain. The flavor is mainly chocolaty. Like a big, gooey, under-cooked brownie. Bits of vanilla, roasted malts, caramel, cream and once again, a whole lot of chocolate. The mouthfeel is velvety smooth. This is a great beer but its a much better beer when its in the non-contract brewed 22oz bottles that are still naturally carbonated. While this is a great beer, the other version is just sublime."
"A very drinkable stout. I look forward to trying to get my hands on another bottle."
"Drinkability: Awesome. Another stellar stout this evening. It is original and easy to drink. Will certainly be drinking this one again. Highly recommended."
"Even mouthfeel, not too rich, moderate carbonation. Finishes slightly dry. Very drinkable, tasty beer."
"This poured dark brown/black in color with a moderate light brown head. This had quite nice aromas of chocolate, rich coffee, sweet caramel and vanilla. In the mouth this was medium-bodied and started off powerful then faded to a dry/bitter finish. The midpalate lacked concentration and flavor though this should have been expected given the alcohol level."
"This one comes raging out of gate but paces itself at sipping speed. Such an excellent effort!"
"Notes: A really drinkable and balanced stout. I was surprised at how light it was on the palate given the color and the nose, but that only makes it more drinkable. Alcohol is in balance, too. I can understand why this beer is often asked for here in Vermont. Tasty."
"I had my last Cadillac stout (bomber) on Christmas Day, I had picked a few up this past September while on vacation. I picked up a number of offerings from Bar Harbor Brewing company at Tully's, great place. This brew lived up to its expectations, poured to a deep black color, some reddish highlights, big medium colored tan head that has very good retention, leaving a fair amount of lacing down the sides of the glass. The aromas, chocolate malt really comes through giving a bittersweet cocoa scent while also possessing a fair roastiness. Also some nice hops aromas come through. While the brew warms more of a alcohol scent seems to peak through. The flavors really show the malts as the chocolate and roasted flavors come through highlighting some sweet flavors then finishing with a very slight hint of hops. As the brew warms the alcohol scent translates to the flavors as well. This is a fantastic brew, I just hope to get back to Maine soon to get some more."
"Taste was just amazing as the smell. Dark malts and coffee up front with a killer vanillia touch! And you can't forget that chocolatey goodness! soo yummmy I'll have another!"
"I could drink a few bombers of this. Pretty light compared to many stouts, so don't go in expecting an overwhelming amount of flavor. Still, taking it for what it is... outstanding!"
"Overall, a very good stout and one that I would seek out."
"What stands out about this stout is it's balance. Really, no cloying flavors, nothing overwhelms. Typical chocolate, nut aroma and taste-and I stress this again-perfectly married to the alcohol and hops. Could easily drink a dozen of these, sitting along the beach after a day in Acadia. One of the better stouts I have drank, unfortunately I don't think I'll be going to Bah Hahbah any time soon."
"Drinkability is the tits. Wow, super impressed, yummy!!!! This went down like apple pie, and if I had more bombers, I'd probably drink them the rest of the night. While we got some great locals, this one is right up there with the best in class, no doubt!"
"A little fizzy for my taste with a dry finish. Easy enough to sip slowly."
"Drinkability- I'm not 100% sure what happened to the 'new' Cadillac Mountain Stout that made it not as good, but the 'old' version is spectacular. So creamy and rich and chocolaty. Big thanks to Greg for sharing the love!"
"Pours a black coffee-like color with a tan head. The smell is a pleasant mixture of chocolate, coffee, roasted malts and some sweetness. This beer goes down really smooth and has a rich almost dairy taste to it with a pretty clean after-taste. It's highly recommended that drinkers buy the 22 oz. bottle, because that is the original way this beer was bottled. After Geary's bought the Bar Harbor Brewing Company they switched to 12 oz bottles in order to sell 6 packs, but the beer lost much of it's taste. Now they are bringing the 22 oz bottle back. Great move."
"D: great dry stout and well worth getting because it is phenomenal. I see why it won a Platinum Medal."
"D - A milk stout full of many different aromas/flavors. Very drinkable."
"A perfect pair with the aroma of Irish turf currently burning in my Vermont stove."
"D- I know that this description sounds just like any other stout but the balance here is immaculate. The chocolate is the main character but the toffee and the roasted flavors play wonderful supporting roles. Nothing is overpowering and it all goes down wonderful and smooth...If this were a car it would ride like a Cadillac."
"Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel with a nice medium body. This stout may lack a bit in complexity, but it is nonetheless an excellent and very solid brew."
"Excellent dry stout. This and Three Floyds' Black Sun are 1 and 2. Don't quite know the order, but both definitely constitute the top tier of American dry stouts."
"it should be noted that this sample i'm having is a 22 oz. bomber that from what i understand was actually brewed at a different location that where it's now being brewed."
"A fantastic choice. Great with a smoked salmon dinner. A true must try for anyone. Worth the effort to hunt down this gem from Maine."
"The brewery version is a big improvement."
"Tastes chocolate, roast, fruity esters, ending ashy. Waaay to many flavors dancing together in that first taste to describe. Dark grains, fruity esters, hop flavor, and hop bitterness all present in modest levels. The best part is how they are all intermingled. Each distinct, but participating in a greater whole. All this from one sip. Yummers. Mild scorch and a bit of acrid coffee (been on the burner all day...sour acrid biting). Hop flavor is dry grass and berry. Hop bitter is mildly grassy from cohumulone. This mild, but rough, hop bitter blends well with the medium carbonation. Surprisingly medium, because I don't notice how intense until I concentrate on it specifically. I think the carb level is mostly covered by a thick silky mouthfeel. Mild foaming in the mouth. Esters are blackberry, banana bread, and cherry innards (no pit character). A very nice offering. Amazing this brewery seems to consistently make a quality product. Often the hype of some beer is short-lived, but this beer is still great several years after I heard to seek it out."
"Got a chance to sample this famous gem of a beer on tap at the brewery from a famous gem of an island while on vacation with my girlfriend. It poured out an opaque black like crude oil with a big to finger head of foam. The thin, brown cap became rocky after a little while and displayed good retention. Impressive lacing too. Aromas of bittersweet and dark chocolate, lots of coffee and hints of rich soil. The flavors were rich and well rounded, roasted and blackened grains, lots of malt complimented by a rich sweetness like a chocolate cookie. Coffee and brown sugar, earthy and full yet the hints of sweetness keep it from being heavy. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel with an appropriate amount of carbonation. Complex, deep, drinkable correct and worth the drive. I bought a case and took it home to cellar!"
"This one was a bit erratic. Nice flavors and wonderful drinkability but the aroma is absent, which drastically changes things in my opinion. A very servicable stout and glad I was able to try it."
"Pours pitch black with a tan head. Nose is a bit bright and berry-ish. Flavor is thick, yes. Roasted and bright just like the nose is. I think I can see how the aging can make a difference. Though I'm imagining that this is for sure a modified recipe. Nice enough, but no mass of complexities. Feel is slick on liquid and low on carbonation. Overall I prefer the original version. The question is: is it an issue of aging the beer, or does this new recipe lack? Honestly I can't really say right now. 4s across the board on this one."
"overall, one of my favorite non-imperial stouts, excellent all around, I would be happy to buy this again."
"I sampled this out of a bomber a few years back and remember it being better then, have heard the same thing from people recently, not a great beer but above average, probably just expected too much going into it, do not think I would go out of my way to get any more of this, still worth trying"
"Overall, a nice and solid example for it's style. Enjoyable and easy to put down."
"Thanks to Dr. Dogbeer for a truly excellent brew!"
"The fruitiness from the nose definitely comes through in the flavor, as it is evident right away. Finishes with smooth toasty grains."
"Overall: glad I got the chance"
"Overall, a complex beer and a treat. But, it's a bit too big to keep around all the time."
"A: Solid 2 inches of head on a 2 inch pour, light brown cottony head that appears to cling to the sides of the glass, deep brown with edges of ruby - 4.25, S: A very powerful nose involving lots of dark chocolate, espresso, possibly some cherries, sweetness is on the forefront and hints of grain, only the slightest sign of hops perceivable - 4.50, T: Strong flavors of a dark molasses, sweet espresso, some dryness - 4.50, M: The mouth fell of this beer was somewhat of a shocker in that it really lacked body and felt thin - 3.50, D: Overall this is quite an impressive stout, loads of flavors and aromas that pull you in - 4.25"
"Prosit, Mk"
"I know there is some contract brewing going on, which hopefully will assist in broader distribution (I hope it won't effect the product). Definitely worth a try, if you can find it."
"Did not know this was being contract brewed...perhaps that had something to do with it"
"D- I did not have very high expectations for this, but damn... this is amazing. Too bad it was hard to get my hands on some of this, I would be drinking this all the time if it were more available."
"This is a great beer!"
"Overall, this is an outstanding stout. Very drinkable. Nicely balanced and quite interesting."
"from wickedpete, a part of beer-o-cache v1.0, from the original brewery"
"Big thanks goes out to Johhhnie!"
"This is a very nicely done stout. I am very happy to get such a great extra in a trade. Thanks to Deuane for this one."
"The rating I'm giving this one is on the original version, with hopes that the new version being brewed at the brewpub will be up to grade."
"Very nice stout- very drinkable and enjoyable."
"There's been talk in the forums of late saying this beer has changed, but since I never had the chance to try the original recipe I have nothing to compare it to. I think it's a well-crafted stout."
"Drinks pretty easy, not a great stout, but pretty damn solid. A bit baffled as to its high ratings, but I might be outta of sync on this one. Worth seeking out"
"Drinkability: A great coffee-esque stout, lots of complex and full flavors, low in alcohol, not harsh at all - quite an attitude with this one. Highly recommended, and probably my new favorite stout."
"D: Not too shabby, nice feeling. I'd happily seek it out, try it again, enjoy it with friends. a Pretty decent beer."
"An unexpected treat...I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it. Thanks Joe!"
"You can easily finish a bomber by yourself, especially on a cold New England night but it is much more fun to share. Buy the bombers while you can. Now for the 12 oz well ""If it ant broke don't fix it ""is all I can say and they tried to fix it. (Different yeast not bottled conditioned as well as different water) It goes against everything that is down east in me to see what they have done to this brew. Ok enough ranting maybe the flatlander that bought this company will get the hint when the sales go south, although that is where he is from"
"Thanks again for sharing this treat, John!"
"It's just shy of a full mouthfeel, the carbonation is on the light side but fits it to a tee, and it finishes with *that* dry, roasted malty goodness. What a brew! I can see why it is so highly regarded and sought after. I'm so happy I got a chance to try it so another thank you is in order to Tom!!"
"This is the newer 12 oz bottle I'm reviewing with the supposedly changed recipe. Not having had the old version in the bomber I can't really make any comparison here. In any case, regardless how this may compare to the old one, it is still a tasty brew to be sure. Pours black with a nice initial tan head that fades to a ring. Nice aromas as well that meld spicy hop notes and rich, roasty, creamy notes. Surprisingly big citrusy, piney bitterness followed by roasted flavors of chocolate, coffee, and some cream. The taste is similar. really nicely integrated hops and roast and sweet cream that are all blended seamlessly together. Very nice. Relatively thick and creamy in the mouth, this is a bit more substantial feeling than many stouts at this abv level. Very nice beer, and I'm glad I brought some back from Maine."
"Simply put, the contract brewed version is (surprisingly) a much better all-around beer than the original."
"Pours a dark brown with ruby highlights when held to the light. Fluffy mocha head that laces the class on the way down. The nose is deep chocolate and coffee, nice deep roasty maltiness. Some fig and dried cherries in there too. Taste is creamy, velvety, chocolaty goodness. Slight alcohol bite and a little ash in the middle. Leaves a bitter roasted coffee in the aftertaste. Thick body with a silky mouthfeel and a medium dry finish. Just an excellent brew. I've had this several times and I just keep coming back for more."
"A very drinkable and delicious regular stout. A nice change from all the imperial stouts with just as much flavor."
"D - Drinkability is top notch, I could sip this one for a few hours at least. The quaffability is high w/ a smoothness most can't come near. Very clean and represents the style so well. I would like to try the contract version for comparison, but the '95 platinum medal winner is very easy on the tastebuds and was downed too quickly. I would certainly like to enjoy this dark gem in the future - it went well with my sausage and potatoes"
"HV"
"According to the Bar Harbor Brewing Co. website, this is ""The Beer that Beat Guinness!"" Well, I don't want to bash Guinness since it was my gateway beer that let to my beer nerdiness, but this beer does more than beat it, Cadillac Mountain Stout destroys Guinness."
"Drinkability- An overall tasty, well balanced and hefty stout, a truly great one to sip on."
"Pours a dark mahogany brown in color. Very nice, frothy, head and very good retention. Smell is roasted malts. Not a whole lot going on in the taste. This is a very reserved stout. Not a single dominant flavor is going to rule. It's very smooth, creamy on the mouthfeel. Very good there. Not a whole lot of flavor coming through. Well made, just not that complex."
"I didn't find any huge differences and will seek out more of either/both versions."
"D: This is one of the best standard stouts I have ever tasted and can hold a candle with some of the best impy stouts I;ve had. Get your hands on this if you can."
"The Bar Harbor Brewing company was recently sold and is now being brewed by the DL Geary Brewing of Portland, Maine. The stout is still good, but seems to be no longer bottle conditioned. All in all, it's not quite the same stuff and is now sold in six packs in 12oz bottles."
"Obvioulsy, this is an excellent beer. However, what really strikes me is how incredibly flavorful and delicious it is, despite a relatively low abv. Granted, this beer was blown away by the big boys at this tasting (the Abyss and Dark Lord), but for a 6.7% stout, it's nothing short of remarkable. A very fine effort from Bar Harbor Brewing."
"very good drinkability, it's awell crafted and taste recipe no matter who brewed it."
"Notes: A big thanks to deltatauhobbit for this one. It definitely lived up to the hype for me; one of the better stouts I've had to date."
"Hard to find much wrong with this one. What an enjoyable beer. Even with the high reviews it's received, I did not expect to like it as much as I did. Superb!"
"This has to be one of the best tasting Stouts I've ever had. It's flavor profile just pops in the mouth and I can't believe how quaffable this was when I realized that it is almost 7%. Definitley try to seek out a bottle of this if you can. Top notch for the style!"
"D: A very delicate brew yet very complex. It's all light and actually refreshing on the palate, none of the flavors stepping on each others toes yet letting you know they're still there. This brew drinks incredibly easy. I'm going to have to find more of this brew. Thanks again, Alan. You always find a way to impress :)"
"1052"
"Pours a deep dark brown with 1 inch of foamy/creamy tan head, good retention and lacing. Smells wonderful, of dark fruits, citrus, roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, and spicy hops. Tastes of creamy cappuccino, caramel, grapefruit, cherries and raisins, chocolate, with peppery hops and coffee in the finish. Lots of amazing flavors. Medium full in body with perfect carbonation, not too strong but not too light either. Smooth and creamy with good roasted flavors and a bitter finish. Extremely flavorful and easy to drink with a nice hop presence. Reminds me of a non Imperial version of Storm King."
" Due to the velvety feel, low alcohol and mellowed balance of this very dark brew I would call this stuff very drinkable."
"Pours black with a light short lived light tan head. Smell is dry, roasty, chocolate and coffee balanced very well. Medium bodied with a slightly bubbly carbonation and flavors of roasty chocolate malt and light coffee. Flavor is a touch thin but is very nice and drinkability is quite good. Nice beer."
"D- A very enjoyable beer. Wish that I had more, but I do not know alot of folks in Maine."
"D:IT was good. Different than most stouts. Very easy to drink. I expected a tad more complexity, but it was still good."
"D- I was ready to trash this one as I normally don't like stouts but I have to say the balance in this one really does it for me. It's not trying to be too big, just a nice, incredibly balanced, rich stout."
"This one is impressively well balanced, and considering the class of relatively low alcohol stouts, very impressive (I actually realized the low alcohol while writing my original review, I expected something above 9 ABV based on the incredibly rich taste as I was drinking it)."
"Bottle courtesy of Wickedpete: Poured a deep black color stout with a nice foamy head with good retention and some nice lacing. Aroma of light roasted malt notes with some great black chocolate element. Taste is also dominated by some great roasted notes with some black chocolates notes with what appears to be some lactose. Full creamy body is probably one of the best that I have tasted in ages with a great level of carbonation for the style. I was really impressed by this one and definitely one of the best for this style."
"The body is closer to full with a nice balance. Very nice blend with silky feel and no really yeasty aftertastes. Good carbonation to balance malty. Overall a great roasty stout. Thanks Bill."
"M/D: Full body, extremely smooth, creamy, velvety, excellent mouthfeel. Drinkability is really good. A very good stout, one I could easily drink a few 22 oz bottles of."
"Drinkability is great. This is an excellent beer, and I can see why it is well liked. Not my favorite stout, and not sure if I'd put it in my top 100. However, this is still a very nice well put together stout, that is very easy, and a pleasure to drink."
"d: Huge thanks to barleywinebrewer for the chance to try this awesome stout. If you get the chance. seek this one out."
"Try it if you can - it's worth it."
"Big shout out to zutmin for the chance to try this one!!"
"O: 4.1"
"Drinkability: Tough to beat. Nearly sessionable."
"Overall: Thanks for deltatauhobbit for the try. This has been one I have tried to trade for unsuccessfully for the past several months. It was a great tasting rather enjoyable beer. Thanks, glad you sent me a few extras to put away for a rainy day."
"Pleasant to drink...but not spectacular in my mind. Seriously, drinking a Black Hawk Stout next to it right now,m I prefer the Black Hawk."
"Pours to a jet black body hosting a two finger deep tan head that has nice staying power. Not thick but totally black. Nose shows nice zesty feel with notes of coco and spicey smoked malt. Enters the mouth with an electric sweet and spicey feel that melts together nicely. Burnt toffee notes are followed by soft bitterness twords the end of the palate. As it warms you get micely developed notes of chocolate hard candy. This is a very drinkable stout and almost refreshing change from big thick Imperial(which I love), and thus very sessoinable and drinkable. Mouthfeel is of cold coffee and spicey dark chocolate. A delecious stout."
"D: A very nice stout, deserving of praise. Easy to drink and reasonable ABV...this reminds me of Deschutes' Obsidian Stout, which I like alot. I recommend this one, all the while hoping to get some more."
"Not much hasn't been said about this beer so I'll keep it brief on this, my first review. Firstly, I'm very proud to have a local maine brew so highly regarded in the beer community. I feel like I've been overlooking this beer for a long time, mostly because it's so readily available around here. Well today I finally picked one up and am very glad I did. Smell is good, but the flavor really shines on this stout. Very smooth, balanced, chocolaty, creamy brew. Had to give it a 5 on drinkability since it went down so fast and so easy. Overall, good stuff, and I feel bad for sleeping on it for so long."
"I'm glad I was finally able to try this beer. I've been eyeing it up for awhile now and was finally able to set up a trade. A beer I'd pick up often if locally available. Thanks for the opportunity Shannon."
"Good stuff."
"Poured this highly anticipated beer into my SA glass. Very dark brown/black with 1 finger of glistening beige head. Aroma of chocolate and java hit me instantly. Big chocolate notes, with some undertones of vanilla and java. Extremely delighful beer! Very silky in the mouth...warm velvet. As the beer warmed, I got a wonderful flow of cocoa into a mild butterscotch flavor with a semi-hoppy finish. Even picked up some marshmellow in the finish. Very balanced, without 1 flavor dominating the palate. Split with my wife and I cannot think of another stout I have enjoyed more. Simply a beautiful beer."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling for a style that normally is, good kick, very good representation of style, I found this to be a very enjoyable beer even though I dont usually get too excited about very many stouts. I could certainly knock back a couple of bombers of this beer on the right evening."
"As far as complexities go, this one has got 'em. Unfortunately the intensity of the complexities is not that strong. A beer like this should not be subtle, it should hall-off and kick you square in the nuts."
"This is big, tasty American stout. I'd call it a classic American stout, but that might infer that something about this beer is average rather than amplified. This is an American stout turned up to 11. The flavor is a rich espresso and cocoa taste which finishes with a mixture of dry, bitter grain and residual sweetness. It seems like there are a decent amount of hops floating around in the background, but it's really that mixture of coffee and chocolate flavors that make this beer wonderful. In the grand scheme of things, this beer could be more complex, but darn it's tasty."
"Taste starts with rich, roasted malt with shades of bitterish coffee. Sweetish dark fruits (plums, dates) meld with meaty, slightly smoky flavors. Roasted chocolate coffee bitterness into the long delicious finish. Full-bodied with a chewy feel. An exceedingly good malty stout that is almost Scotch Ale like."
"A truly phenomenal beer in all aspects."
"Pours opaque black with mahogany hue and a tan frothy head that dies pretty quick. Nose is roasty with chocolate, a hint of coffee and a vanilla bean scent. Taste is nice and roasty, chocolate and bakers chocolate and a vanilla/toffee like finish with a little bitterness. Velvet in the mouth and not syrupy in any way. Nice carbonation. This is somewhat porter like in feel but has a lot of delicious stout taste. A perfect balance of flavor and body and a delight to sip. Could do another!"
"I shared the bomber but I really think I could drink this one all evening. Very hard not to gulp this down and open another one."
"An excellent stout, more coffee/chocolate variety than fruity. Looking forward to my next bottle!"
"D: This beer defines drinkability. I love darker beers and at under 7%, I could drink this one all day."
"D - a tasty indulgence"
"Pours a watery black color with light brown rocky, fizzy head. Leaves some lacing, but head slowly fades away to leave very little. Smell is very faint, with some mild coffee, and grains. Taste is much better than what I get from the smell. Sweet with some bitter coffee flavors. Watery mouthfeeling with soft carbonation ."
"The beer was a little thinner in the mouthfell than expected. At 6.7% I was expecting it to be a bit heavier. Overall this has great drinkability and totally worth making this a session beer fall through spring."
"This is a top notch brew by any standard and simply amazing coming from the tiny brewery it does. Oh, if only they had the inclination to expand production, the things they could produce! Ah well, at least we have Cadillac Mountain Stout."
"Nice full bodied mouthfeel makes this beer a meal by itself."
"I say this beer represents an American Stout very well."
"I'm now regretting giving so much of this away to friends. I did keep 5 bombers for myself, but I need more. I guess another trip to Maine will be in order soon."
"D: Good drinkability. Well balanced. Certainly a high quality American stout."
"Overall, a solid stout - but just slightly too sweet. Still nicely drinkable and satisfying. Admittedly, I had expected something a little more interesting after seeing the overall score."
"I agree with the commercial description that it meets or beats Guinness and Murphys but it is not playing in the big leagues with such Stout classics as Storm King, Wake n Bake and Kentucky Breakfast."
"drinkability is great. very well balanced. an excellent example of the style and just a damn good stout. thanks eric!"
"Pours a complete black with a nice two finger tan colored head that slowly dies die to a nice thin head that stays throughout. Stickiness is decent, holds on to the sides a bit here and there but not a whole lot. Smell is a sweet caramel malt combined with roasted nuts and a bit of chocolate as well. Taste is very much the same but dark fruits seem to stand out. Nice mild smokey nut flavor that is very enjoyable. Aftertaste is a nice date and raisin like flavor that stays forever. Great balance between the sweetness and roasted flavors. Such a full bodied, complex brew that goes down so smooth and creamy. Get your hands on this one for sure."
"Last swigs: Well done American stout. Surprised that there are not more beers that use the cadillac name."
"Got in a trade with johnnnniee - thanks! Poured from a 22oz bottle with no dating system into my trusty pint glass. Was deep black with mahogany edges. Had a good size dark brown head that slowly settled into a thin collar. Not much lacing. The aroma was kinda weak but what was there was very pleasing. Chocolate malts was dominant with a little coffee in the back. The taste was outstanding. This is by far the best AmStout that I've tried. It's described as a dry stout and I'm not entirely sure what that means but I like it. Was smooth from start to finish and avoided that bitter end that I find in some stouts. Really pleased the whole tongue. Just a nth from being a 5 on taste. The mouthfeel was perfect. Rich and creamy with just right carbonation. Highly, highly recommend. (4.5, HR, T, Y)"
"Thanks goes to zutmin for the bottle."
"Surprisingly lighter bodied, the mouth feel is slightly under-carbonated. That special citrus hop in the nose is captured in the flavor over the milk stout base. Very drinkable. The 6.7% ABV is well hidden. This isn't your highly roasted winter bev. Go for it!"
"D- Drinkibility is high for me for a stout. The intense malt and hops flavors really make this beer shine."
"Poured into a chalice a black color, nice carbonation, small creamy tannish head, mostly a nice oil slick, some lacing afterwards. The nose is mostly malts, toffee, slight coffee, vanilla, and some caramel. The taste is malty, slight roasted feel, toffee, coffee, and caramel. The finish is dry. Medium body. Very drinkable, a very taste Stout, would like to try this one again in the future."
"D: This is a very easy to drink beer, a very good stout. The flavors are soft and focused, creating a solid beer that never overwhelms the palate. This is how a good stout should taste."
"rhanks to zutmin for this trade and well worth it on my end. pours the blackest brew I have ever seen. nice light brown head, little carbonation. burnt notes, bitter coffe taste, medium body, easy to drink. great with a brownie. tasty end of the night beer."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable - goes down easy. That said, unremarkable and overrated."
"Guess what color this one was? Just kidding, it is obviously black. The head was foamy, tan, and sizable. The aroma was roasted, charred, and dark chocolates. the flavor made me think ""This is what Guinness should be"". The label did not lie, the chocolate flavor was ""focused"". This was good stuff but 12oz would have been enough."
"Not a bad brew overall. I would like to try it again, a bottle with less age on it perhaps and I will re-review..."
"This beer is very drinkable and quite tasty. It has a wonderful mouthfeel, but could use a bit more aroma. I hope someday this beer is distributed outside of Maine."
"D - Overall I would say excellent. The smoothest, easiest drinking stout I have ever had,, This was really a pleasure to drink I can certainly see why this is an award winner, perfect balance and drinkabilty. Really nice and a great brew."
"D: Damn easy to drink. If your a Stout fan, you must check this out."
"D- I think it is very tasty. One of the best regular stouts."
"D: Nice beer but #32 in the world is a serious reach."
"D: Not unpleasant, but not very good either. I'm thinking that this bottle is just oxidized, but until I can confirm this with another bottle, my recommendation is to pass."
"Simply put, if you love good beer, especially stouts, and really want to taste a well-crafted, incredibly complex yet so easy to drink beer you MUST try this. Outstanding, and #1 on my personal Top 10. Many thanks to Tod at Bar Harbor for keeping the faith and doing it right one batch at a time. I would drive over an hour for this, and I will very soon."
"I wish this beer was available in NC, as I would drink it all the time."
"Poured into a nonic a deep dark brown with hints of ruby hue a large blooming mocha colore head atop that settles slowlty into a creamy-like mass.Deep bitter chocolate notes with a great floral aroma coming thru that was unexpected but very nice you dont see that much in the style but made for a pleasant suprise underlying coffee tones come thru as well.Light to medium bodied but oh so smooth it was gone before I knew it,quite dry but not bitter firm unsweetened chocolate and dark roast coffee tones intertwined with a hint of charred fruit that really lends itself to the drier aspects of the beer.Defifnetly one of the better dry stouts to come my way if not the best,just flavorful I will look forward to getting more of this."
"Many thanks to dmeadows for sending me two bottles of this coveted stout. Sticker on bottle claims ""Batch #01829."" No idea what this means, exactly. Produces a noisy sand-khaki head that settles to a creamy cap on top of a nearly impenetrable dark chocolate brown, almost black, body with thin, faint garnet highlights. A beautiful sight in a 20-ounce nonic. Lovely roasted grain, chocolate, and coffee notes in the aroma. A slightly sweet toffee or caramel scent appears, too. Roasty mocha goodness. Can't ask for much more in the way of aroma for a stout. Velvety smooth, incredibly rich and full mouthfeel. Decadent chocolate caramel sweetness with dark-roasted coffee undertones. Almost veering towards dark fruits in the back, this stout is so rich and reminiscent of a dessert that I occasionally feel like it could almost be an RIS. But it's not scorched, vinous, or alcoholic enough for that. Slightly acrid finish, leaning toward off-dry. As far as the pinnacle of American Stouts is concerned, Cadillac Mtn. holds down the sweet side while Rogue Shakespeare's got the roasty dry side on lock. Can't go wrong with either one. I will gladly drink as many of these bottles as come my way. Superb."
"Coffee and bittersweet chocolate flavors abound with similar roasted malts. Faint floral hops on the dry finish. More medium bodied than expected. Very drinkable, the bomber didn't have a chance."
"Pours out black and leaves an excellent tan head and lacing behind. Smell was nice and roasty, plenty of cocoa as well. As I dug deeper I found remnants of earth, and a bit of some sort of a berry. Taste was earthy, sweet and definately roasty, but just didn't seem all that awesome to me (older bottle?). Medium bodied, medium carbonation, dry roasty finish. Drinkability is fine, but didn't keep bringing me back for more. I probably wouldn't go out of my way for this one again."
"Pours a nice big, thick head that does fall after a couple of minutes leaving a lacing behind. The color is nice and black. The smell is sour, with a backround of slight coffee malts. The taste is smooth and has a slight coffee backround, but has a weird taste before the aftertaste gives you a nice dry stout with some good sweet tones to it. The mouthfeel is alright, not too bad. Overall I wouldn't try this without xtenuating circumstances."
"Now if only Bar Harbor would sell this beer here."
"Just an awesome brew, Im the better (and lucky) man for trying and enjoying it immensely."
"Drink-Ability: What can I say I love Stouts and this one is great!"
" The mouthfeel is nice and creamy, but can be a bit foamy if not handled carefully. Overall, though, a very enjoyable beer, and extremely drinkable. Don't know why I didn't drink it sooner. It's probably a little better fresh, but age may have done it some favors."
"Wow, this beer lived up to all the hype and more."
"22oz. bottle poured black with big brown head leaving lace. Has an aroma of chocolate, malt and a little bit of alcohol. Taste rich and creamy but isn't thick, almost has more of a light feel with flavors of chocolate, roasted malt, and a mild bitterness. This brew is way to easy to drink. I think I could polish off a bomber in the time it takes me to drink some 12oz beers."
"Cheers."
"drinkability: good"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a plus sized medium body. The beer has low carbonation. This is a very creamy beer. Again I have to mention I really like this beer. This was a very hard beer for me to put down. I will seek out more of this beer at a later date."
"I received this as a present and couldn't have received a better gift. Poured into a glass to release a tall, thin foam on top of a thick, dark body. I could smell the delicious chocolate and coffee tones. Taste in my mouth was exceptional: smooth, light, and crisp with no aftertaste. Simply outstanding beverage. Smoothest stout I've ever tasted. Would love to get out east to be able to sample a fresh pint in the future."
"Medium-body, moderate carbonation. I say medium body because that's how it feels on the going down, but it's pretty filling at the same time. Balance is good. I would say that the promise of the aroma isn't fully realized in the taste. It's milder than I expected. Overall, a good example of the style."
"Nice & drinkable."
"Lots of big flavor and feel from a relatively small beer. This one is quite enjoyable. Many thanks to jrdegriselles for a chance to try this tasty brew. I would definitely recommend this one to friends."
"Pours pitch black with a big, tight-bubbled taupe head than fades to a dusting. Doughy, yeasty aromas predominate; in the background are some dark fruits, sugared coffees, and perhaps a slight earthy hop aroma. On the tongue, this beer really shines, with creamy coffee, slightly metallic, bitter malts, a perfect balance of bitterness and sweetness, and a delicate dark fruit twang toward the end. Mouthfeel is silky smooth, with just the right amount of fine-bubbled carbonation, and the finish lasts forever. There's really nothing bad to say about this beer; it's a phenomenal stout. There are bigger examples out there, and less alcoholic ones, but very few that combine flavor, moderate alcohol, and drinkability in one package as this one does."
"Best looking stout, I've seen in a long time. Pitch black, with a super frothy, cream colored head, that never goes away. With each refill pour, the creamy head returns. Lots of dark chocolate smells, backed with hints of raisins, charcoal, a little coffee. This is a winner of a stout. Creamy smooth taste, one of the best I've had. A nice mix of dark chocolates and some dark fruits, very well balanced. Way too easy to drink and way too enjoyable. i wish I had some more of this great brew. A must try!!!"
"This beer seems to have more alcohol than what is listed. The beer is a dark black with a creamy tan head. There is no lacing. The Smell is somewhat like pecan pancakes with maple syrup. The taste is coffe and chocolate. The mouthfeel is smooth but again, there seems to be a bit more alcohol than listed. The drinkability is good. You have to drink this slow however because it is filling."
"Thanks to enola for sharing. He's the type of guy that when you split a bomber, he gives you the glass that has the most in it."
"I tried this beer this past summer when visiting Bar Harbor, but it was one of the most delicious beers I have had. Dark color and tan head, smelled terrific, tasted beautiful with a full mouthful. Did I mention its one of my favorites? BHBC has produced some amazing beers, and this is no exception."
"1 of the best Stout's I ever drank!"
"I tried this beer while on vacation in Maine. I visited the brewery which is run by a husband and wife and that is all except for a college student helper in the summertime. Nice people and probalby my favorite stout if not top 3 for sure. Too bad i can't get it in PA."
"Figured Id re-rate this for old-times sake and since Ive tried so many more beers since, and I know what Im doing a little better what Im doing now than I did a year ago (though some may argue otherwise). Black opaque body withi initially thick, slow to dissipate tan head. Smells sweet, chocolaty or coffee (I cant decide), with hints of hops and yeast. Tastes initially sweet and roasty, but has a hoppy aftertaste. A very good stout, but would be better if the hop bitterness werent quite so pronounced. Still very good. Glad I got it again, Im more impressed this time. If I were smart, Id go to the coast and get it on tap..."
"If I could get this on a regular basis, it would be my go to stout, especially at that price. Amazing. Two exaggerated thumbs up to Bar Harbor."
"Top-notch effort from a cool microbrewery."
"So happy to have discovered this in NJ, then enjoyed soon after in Maine where it's from. Now back in NJ and ready to review with a glass right in front of me. Pours out a dark mahogony brown, nearly black with a coffee ice cream colored head. There are lots of things going on inthe nose, coffee, chocolate, yeast, even a little hops, but no mistaking richly roasted malt. You get all the same in the taste, but it develops one after the other, wonderful! The moutfeel keeps alternating back and forth between effervescent bite, and silky, creamy smoothness. It finishes a little dark, more coffee here, but extremely drinkable for a stout."
"Cheers!"
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Mouthfeel is a little thin, but this is a very solidly crafted stout, up there with the tops in style."
"A dark brown/black beer with deep mahogony highlights. Has a bis foamy brown head. There is a deep roasted malt character to the aroma with some molasess and hints of vanilla in the background. There are also some coffee notes as the glass warms. The taste starts out like a milk stout , nice and sweet on the tip of your tongue. Then the roasted malt bitterness builds as it heads to the back of your mouth. With some coffee notes mixed in with the burnt grain notes. A slight tickle from some hops on the finish and a hint of vanilla in the bacground."
"The mouthfeel is pretty great. It is smooth and creamy. The drinkability is very high. At less than $4 a bottle when I visit Maine, I make it a point to stock up. One of the best stouts out there."
"I bought this at Tully's in Wells Me. and I couldn't wait to open it. This beer pours a jet black with a huge tan foamy head. This is what a beer should look like ! The smell,however, was alot lighter than I expected. I could only smell a slight hint of coffee and roasted malt. The taste is full of roasted malt,coffee, and mostly chocolate. The m/f is medium with all the flavors mixing very well. This is a very good stout that should not be missed. I wish I bought a few more bottles."
"Not a style I go for all that often, but since we were cracking open a bomber we had purchased back in Feb, I said David pour me a glass too. Dark and opaque, I've been sitting outside reading and admiring the lovely golden sheen of the crema style head on top. Aroma is a bit reserved, but some deep whiffs reveal chocolate notes, and even some interesting metallic bits. Small not overly sharp carbonation. Medium, slightly sticky body. Tastewise, a nice 55% chocolate eaten with a cup of rich roastey coffee with ultimate note being the roast. It's not a big in your face kind of brew, which I don't mind, the abv and not over powering in your faceness makes it easy to enjoy. Good stuff."
"flavor and mouthfeel both lighter than expected, especially for a stout. medium-high carbonation. bitterness of coffee and roasted malts and a touch of chocolate sweetness. finishes very clean with a slight hop bite. easy drinking, pleasant and nicely fragrant."
"This beer was a nice black color with a thick coffee head, served in a snifter and just a little chilled. It had a dark chocolate odor. I could taste chocolate, roasted grain , and I think even some licorice. A great tasting beer. I thought it felt a trifle thin in the mouth, I guess I was expecting something a little more substantial. However, a great beer overall."
"what a great freakin stout. world class, and one of the few so which can be classified as american session brews."
"this is a great stout and you should try it if you find it!"
"Cadillac Mountain Stout isn't the world-beater that I expected, but it is a very good version of a 'just plain ol' stout, a style that is too often ignored. Assuming a little better quality control with regard to carbonation, I can see how it earned the accolades that are so proudly displayed on the label. I'd like to thank MuddyFeet for sending the bomber my way."
"Well, I poured this one wrong, I have an inch of beer and five of head. When the head finally recedes I make my second attempt and get what I am looking for a nice pure black wiht inch walnut head. First off the one has a good amount of carbonation in the mouthfeel and taste is a sweet and roasted all in one. As this one warms the drinkability factor jumps tremendously. I'm glad I took the trip to Portland to pick up this winner and the price is more than right grabbing four of these for less than $20."
"This one is worth the 90 minute drive up to Tully's (and the Maine Diner, of course) from my house."
"The taste is caramellized sugar, malt and some further chocolate hints. It also has some woodsy aspects to it. It finishes with a nice coating mouthfeel. The drinkability is quite good on a very cold day. An excellent beer for some of our coldest weather to date in this winter of 2006."
"Aroma is full of roasted coffee notes with a tinge of cola. Deep black body with a thumb thick tan head. Fore is very creamy feeling..nice first sip. Mild tobacco notes, roasted coffee, lots of chocolate flavor. Finish is again a little tobacco/ash tinged, but it is quite complimentary and not off putting. Balances the heavy chocolate notes quite well."
"Drinkability: Platinum award winner here note the label. A nice change of pace from the stouts that I am realy used too."
"Thanks to jamie2dope for the bottle."
"-UF"
"Solid pitch black colored body over a dark tan smallish head. Decent head retention and lacing. Great strong aroma filled with dark fruits, roasted malts and some bittersweet dark chocolate. Flavor was just as big with sweet dark ripe fruits over dark chocolate. Plenty of roasted malts and coffee as well. Dry bitter sweet finish with some staying power. Creamy smooth body with plenty of heft to it. Very drinkable and tasty stuff that would be in my regular rotation if I could get it locally."
"Definitely a good stout that I will drink again the next time I'm in Vacationland."
"On a day like today when all the liquor stores are closed and all of my beer for the holidays is gone, I need something special to fall back on, which is why I decided to open one of my last bottles of the Cadillac Mountain Stout. Poured a wonderful black cool color with a tiny lace heading that stuck around modestly through it all. Smell was of nice fresh coffee, very sweet fudge, milk chocolate, and maybe even a hint of some brown unrefined sugar. The stout tasted like a big piece of chocolate cake, not too rich, that was very sweet in the beginning and gradually became slightly bitter. There was also a vague smoke character in there, making it all the more interesting and complex. Mouthfeel was pretty light, which made it very drinkable. In my humble opinion, this is one of the best stouts in the U.S, even the world (that I have tried anyway). Would go great as a dessert beer, or paired with some sweet meats. I find myself growing a little bit sad as the beer in my glass becomes less and less. On a brighter note, If you get a chance to sample this beer whether through trade or in the Bar Harbor area, you'll be delighted to find that this is a superb beer certainly worth seeking out. Cheers to the brewers for making a great beer that I will hopefully get to have again."
"This may very well be the best beer I have ever had. It's that damn good."
"Ahhh, burly beer from Maine. Got this one for free from a friend, which always makes the beer taste better. Sort of... Anyway. A deep dark brown color, tan foamy head lasts quite a while. When receiving this beer it was described to me as a cross between a Scotch ale and a dry stout, which I think is a pretty dead on description. Slight smokiness in the taste which separates this beer from others in the style, and a big roasty chocolate malt backdrop. Also, some odd spicy notes, perhaps from hops, perhaps not. Either way, it's got a nice balance of spicy and sweet which comes together. Medium to full bodied yet with a lively carbonation that makes it somewhat floaty on the palate. Dunno how they keep the ABV at a modest 6.7% for such a flavorful ale. A definite side trip for this beer every time I find myself in the beautiful state of Maine. Quite the treat from Down East as they say. Ah-yuh."
"Cheers"
"I got a few 22 oz. bottles from my brother. He is proud UMaine Orono guy. I was suspect at first, but was won over by this stout rendition. Good mouthfeel combined with a high gravity to give it some warmth. It poured a little thin, akin to a porter, but stood up when it washed over the taste buds- definately a stout.This is a stout in a bottle that I would bring to a party so people could try a fine American example."
"A dark stout with red tinged edges with a nice almost tan head that hangs out for a bit. The smell is a nice roasted slight coffeeness and a clean malt sweetness. The first sip was weird there seems to be a off metallic taste to this. It has a dry finish too. The nice burnt smokey coffee flavor come through nice but in the finish is a dry metallic taste that was not just my glass. Overall I thought it had a nice body and was very drinkable I would buy another."
"Mouthfeel is creamy with a medium body and healthy carbonation. A really tasty stout that's easy to drink with a unique flavor profile. I really wish I had easier access to this as I would pick it up regularly. Many thanks to MuddyFeet and BIF20 for getting this my way. I will seek it out again if the opportunity arises."
"Judging by the ease of the cap sliding off and the lack of carbonation in the beer, I'd have to say I got a bad sample. Despite this, there were no weird flavors going on at all. I will definitely have to try this beer again...if I can get my hands on another one."
"Pours a light tan, five finger head, fades slowly and leaves a good lace. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Virtually black color. Nose is coffee. Starts with hints of chocolate and coffee, finish is smooth but a touch of bitterness. $4.79 for a 22oz bottle from Otter Creek Market Otter Creek, Me."
"An easy drinking stout, but nothing spectacular. Medium to light mouthfeel, mildly creamy. Some grain and carefuly roasted so that not burned. Lightly chocolate. Nicely understated carbonation. More malted sweet than bitter, mild spice. Thanks Viggio for the fresh bottle from Maine."
"Drinkability is simply put - more please. I like this one more than many others I've had recently...perhaps more than Stone RIS and Dark Lord, although it is not quite in that category - it is a regular American Stout and perhaps the heavy delivery of the RIS and DL shouldn't be compared..."
"(Mike Ryan)"
"Very dark brown with deep ruby highlights and a fairly dense, light brown head. Good retention and lacing. Lots of malt in the aroma, with plenty of chocolate, sweetness, and a bit of coffee. There's also a light fruit and hop character. Wonderful flavour, a combination of sweet maltiness, bittersweet chocolate, and fresh hops coming together very well over moderate bitterness that builds a bit towards the end. The roasted malts aren't sharp at all and there's a bit of lactose sweetness that really ties things together. It finishes very balanced, with a bit of coffee. Rich, creamy texture, especially as it warms, with a bit of dryness at the finish from the dark malts. Full, round body. Moderate carbonation is very well integrated and soft. An exceptional stout that I could drink all night. Thanks for the pick-up Viggo."
"Mouthfeel is quite thick...drinkability is a no-brainer. If you even remotely care for this style, you must get your hands on this one...one of the best IMO...thanks again Sean."
"Pours a very deep black, with some reddish highlights, slightly cloudy. Big brown head forms, very tight and creamy, sticks all over the glass. Smell is lots of coffee and chocolate, licorice, a lot of sweet grainy malts. Taste is amazing, some sweet molasses flavour up front, very grainy with bittersweet chocolate and coffee, with some caramel and a slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is as close to perfect a stout gets, very full bodied, tight carbonation, very smooth, excellent stout."
"Deep dark brown, nice light brown head. Campfire nose, pleasantly dry yet with vanilla flavors. Brown sugar sweetness contrasts nicely with bushes like hops. It tries to be dry in mouth,but this brown sugar presence cant be stopped. It feels slightly oaty, floury and cerealic. Farily rich stout in terms of ingredients I assume, but not particularly complex and somewhat overrated perhaps. Medium bodied, slightly powdery texture, rich for 5%. Good, but top 100 status? Not quite to me."
"Brew # 01501... Poured a dark black with just a little red around the edges, light khaki head, and some sparce lacing on the glass. Lots of chocolate in the aroma. Brownies, fudge, and dark fruits. Chocolate and roast coffee taste. Sweet, possibly even some alcohol noticed here? Smooth and creamy mouthfeel with light carbonation. I prefer dry stouts to be a little lighter in alcohol, but that is not knocking this one. Very well balanced for what it is, and very fulfilling. Big props to the parents for bringing this back from their vacation for me!"
"Black, shiny, slick, quickly fading head, small ring. Smell is watery coffee, some chocolate, rather tame nose. Taste is a sweet chocolate with bitter coffee flavors. Carbonic bite in the middle and a smooth finish of mild hops and more mocha. Mouthfeel is full and creamy in the early stages, slickening up at the end. This is sessionable and worth doing so. Great sweet stout."
"This one is worth seeking out. I will be hitting Lou's Beverage Barn in Augusta once more to find some of this nectar. Go Bar Harbor!!!"
"The mouthfeel is lightly crisp at the start, and finishes dry and smooth with a long chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt aftertaste. This is an exceptional brew that can be drank all day and night. Go out of your way to find this in New England / Maine area."
"very drinkable, possibly very filling too. an excellent stout that does great justice to the formidable maine landmark which is its namesake. try to search one out if you can."
"Drinkability and Notes  Very drinkable, and not too expensive if you happen to be in Maine. One of the best American stouts Ive had, second best in my book behind Shakespeare Stout. Its odd that the bottle says this won for dry stout, it certainly tastes too sweet to be a dry stout."
"Drinkability is well exceptional, wish I could grab this locally. Thanks go to mdavis31481 for this tasty treat."
"Drinkability, like I said, is smooth. Just slides into my mouth and down the gullet. The flavors did not wear me out so much as bring them to a peak."
"Thanks to cmaruschak for the trade. I can say with pretty good certainty that this is the best Dry Stout I have had. If Guinness tasted like this I probably never would have branched out to new beers. Pours virtually black with a thick and foamy beige head. Thin lacing. Nice aroma of coffee, chocolate and roasted nuts. Rich and smooth body with a flavorful blend of coffee, cocoa, malt and hops. The finish is bittersweet chocolate and hops. Well done."
"Thanks again to cmaruschak for the chance to enjoy a stout of this caliber"
"This is one of the better New England milk or dry stouts out there. It's such a treat. If you enjoy stouts, you must check this out. It's a finely crafted beer. Reccommended."
"Huge, HUGE thanks to VLC for this one."
"Large froth of starting head at an inch plus of nice-tight small bubbles. Dark black hue, though some slight action could be discerned on the edges. Round roast malt on nose with a slight mossy character and a tinny fond hint. To taste, a tintinnabulation of encompassing black tar sweetness, a tiny touch of black licorice spice, and a roasted character that pulls through quickly and cleanly at the end. This was a completely refreshing break from the American double stouts I would be more prone to drink. Truly a hit."
"Many thanks to brewguru for helping me obtain this beer via trade!"
"A very fine stout. Very well crafted. A big thanks goes out to Rajendra82 for the trade and opportunity to sample."
"Thick, luscious beer with a milky, elastic mouthfeel. Like chewing on a mouthful of soft chocolate candies or rubber bands. Sweet like a candy bar up front -- lots of milk chocolates of varying flavors. Moves to a moderate roasted bitterness and dries out through the finish, which highlights the woodier aspects of the beer. Perfectly balanced without too much sweetness or roasted flavor, and the chocolate stands out as being both natural and delicious."
"The beer poured an impressively inky black with slight brown highlights at the edges. The head was thick and rich, and appropriately colored like the foam on top of an freshly made espresso. The aroma was roasty and sweet. I could detect cocoa, coffee, toffee, and vanilla. The taste was robust, yet smooth. There were flavors of chocolate, caramel, vanilla ice cream, and coffee with hazelnuts, but none was overpowering the others. The aftertaste was dry and a bit grainy, but not harsh. Silky smooth and soothing, this is a very English feeling Dry Stout, and lacks the aggressive hop bite of the modern American versions. I should have no problems finishing the remaining three bombers in the upcoming weeks."
"Drinkability: This bomber bottle disappeared quite quickly. The smoothness of this beer makes it too drinkable to last long. Thanks a bunch to the Purples for the chance to retry this favorite of mine!"
"Dark with a tan head, quick rise and not so quick fall. By now there is no head, I've been enjoying this for quite a while. Fully smelling of roasted things and some hops. Flavors are stout, everything you could ever any or ask for in a stout right here. Mouthfeel is small, i wanted more! At least it's drinkable."
"Drinkability is very high. As good a balanced stout as I've sampled, near perfect balance."
"This was brought my way by SheepNutz in a 22oz bomber. Pours a very dark color with a tall tan head that falls very slowly and leaves lots of lacing. The aroma has a very malty character with roasted malts, dark fruits, and chocolate. Very pleasant. The flavor is much the same. Roasted malts, dark fruit, chocolate, expresso. Thick and smooth. Excellent stout."
"22oz. bomber poured into a snifter. It pours a deep midnight black color with three fingers of light tan head. A shitload of lacing. The smell is very malty. Lots of roasted malt and coffee aromas. It really fills the nose. The taste has a great burnt malt and mocha character. Some espresso bitterness and a hint of hops on the finish. The body was just a little light and oily. The drinkability is flippin' fantastic. Damn this beer is good."
"The beer pours a jet black color wtih 3 fingers of tan head that falls to a quarter inch over the beer. The nose is a nice mocha with some hints of dark fruits, raisins and figs. The flavor is mostly chocolate with some undertones of coffee. What a nice drink. The feel is somewhat thick. Drinkability is excellent as well. I want to keep drinking this one. An excellent selection if I say so myself."
"Aroma oozes sweet molasses and just a hint of herbal minty hop aroma, Northern Brewer perhaps? Busy is quite full but the phenomenal flavor of this beer makes it dangerously drinkable for a stout this big. Flavor is smooth and chocolate-mocha, with perfect roastiness. Theres a nice bitterness in the finish that I didnt really expect in the just slightly dry finish. As the beer warms I detect a bit of port-esque fruity tartness as well. This is a beer to be savored indeed.."
"Holy Stout, Batman! The Bar Harbor Brewing Co. has crafted one magnificent brew. It is supermodel stout with ponderous opacity, and a thick creamy head. The chocolate and coffee aroma is nice, if a bit subdued. The flavors are exceptional with chocolate and mellow coffee notes dominating a brew with a bit of a dry-sour dough finish. Its exquisitely well bodied and I would like another ... right now."
"I picked up a 22 oz bottle of this stout at the only grocery store I could find in Bar Harbor. It was really quite painful to have to wait until it was chilled, but once I popped off the cap, I knew it was worth the wait. The beer poured a dark, almost black color with a frothy, tan head. Great retention and lacing on this one, and the overall appearance was captivating. A heavy roasted malt smell was mixed with some subtle floral notes and hop spice - complex enough to be a challenge to discern, yet reserved enough to remain inviting. The taste of this beer blew me away. A sweet, somewhat dry malt taste vied with a considerable hops assertion, and the intertwine sent me reeling. I actually had a hard time keeping up with where the taste was taking me. Even in the finish, a slightly bitter aftertaste was overtaken by roasted malt and coffee. The mouthfeel was just right for the style - a full body and tickle on the tongue, but not overwhelming to distract from the taste. This is one of the most interesting beers I've had in quite some time, and easily one of the best stouts I've had. Excellent."
"This is a deligthful stout. Cadillac Mountain might not be a good enough name...How about Rolls Royce Mountain ?"
"I could easly have more than one of these in a sitting, but unfortunately it is not available in my area. Thanks go out again to PPoitras!"
"Very nice complexity, and worthy of its acclaim. Very, Very, tasty, and incredible drinkability. By far, the best of the many Maine brews I enjoyed."
"Not an overly complex beer, but it's very well balanced, straight-forward flavor is excellent. A very drinkable brew."
"Gotta thank tavernjeff for the opportunity to try this one."
"Thanks to trbeer (Tim) for providing the bottle."
"Silky smooth, creamy velvet texture, full-bodied and heavy on the palate but with a clean finish containing only a hint of acidity. A bit sweeter than I prefer but an excellent stout, no flaws at all. Many thanks to kfoss99 for introducing this beer to me."
"Cadillac Mtn. Stout: In a 22 oz bomber bottle, thanks Benjamin. A vigorous pours results in a huge head in my Imperial Pint glass, but it dissipated very quickly, leaving a slight covering. Inky black is revealed to be a beautiful ruby red when held up to a weapons grade light. Interesting and extremely pleasant aroma, with coffee and toffee present. The taste is terrific, initial sweetness develops with a nice blast of roasted flavor as well. Sweet aftertaste lingers, with a bit black licorice as well. Nice taste, easy to drink and well worth it. Pick it up if you have the opportunity."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed an 1"" of dense light brown head, and laced well. Barely translucent dark brown/black hued brew. Dark malts combined with a slightly effervescent some what fruity aroma make up the aroma. Taste is is mainly of the dark malts that you'd expect, and is accompanied by a pleasantly warming taste of alcohol. A brew that lives up to the hype."
"Big thanks to purplehops for this gift! You da man!"
"Im happy this is my first stout review, this is the yardstick Ill compare all further stouts I try."
"Thanks to purplehops for the bombers!"
"I finished the bomber in no time...and was disappointed that there was no more. I need to find this beer here in Jersey, the only thing that comes close as far as regular stouts is Basil T's up in Redbank."
"Brew # 1415. This is a great stout. It pours a deep blood red/black with creamy, dark tan head. Rich chocolate and roast coffee aroma with some earthy hops hiding in the backround. Creamy, full body holding a wonderfully complex chocolate, sweet malt, caramel, dark roast coffee, and earthy hops flowing together. The finish is long and lasting, slightly nutty and dry. Flavors blended in the best sense, great job with this beer...Highly recommended....Lucky Mainesters.."
"Drinkability: Complete. The sweetmalt, chocolate, and coffee flavors make this a top beer in my book, no matter the style. Wonderfully drinkable, if this was available here I would drink it everyday."
"Went great with some dark Belgian chocolate."
"Easily the most complex dry stout I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. If this isn't the closest thing to perfection, I don't know what is. Maine is hiding a gem of a beer bigger than the hope diamond. Get it if you see it."
"Very much like an imperial, this stout has strong coffee and chocolate flavors following an almost sweet beginning. Definately follow the recommended serving temperature to get the full flavor of this stout. This was my first from Bar Harbor and I am looking forward to trying all the rest."
"Very well balanced and a well brewed stout."
"One of the better stouts I've had the pleasure of drinking, and reason enough for a trip to Maine. I can see why this was one of the post- Llamafest highlights of the pub crawl. Many thanks to Patand David for the bomber."
"Tasted blind at the Saint Louis BA tasting 12/14/03"
"This is one pretty stout,it pours a super deep dark black hue reminiscent of an imperial stout, with the same smell to boot. The head is a fluffy tan masterpiece. Very nice and chewy chocolate, caramel, toffee, and coffee tones with an excellent mouthfeel, and unbelievable drinkability. I have heard alot of hype about this beer and it lives up to it. The burps remind me of Expedition Stout, which is not bad at all. thanks to Purplehops."
"This was tasted in the St. Louis BA 12/14/03 blind tasting. I thought it was Bell's Kalamazoo Stout, which is pretty high praise in my book. A fine stout, and my second favorite of the tasting."
"I would love to try this beer on tap but I don't think they keg their beer? Very good and I will purchase many more on my next trip to ME."
"Taste is huge and smoky. The taste definitely display a big burnt malt flavor with light chocolate undertones. this beer is smooth like black velvet. Big full body with a dry bitter finish. Nicely done. Very complex brew and did I mention tasty? Reminds me that I need to keep more of this on hand..."
"God I love living in Maine."
"F"
"Overall Impression: This is one great beer. It’s packed with flavor, but not overbearing. Cadillac Mtn. is a masterful blend of tastes and texture that I could drink all day. I’m sad that it’s brewed so far away from my beloved Texas, or this would be a regular enjoyment."
"I'm glad it comes in a bomber, sad I only have but one. A huge thanks to bennybrew for sending this great stout my way."
"Goodness. The bubbly (then creamy) head is the perfect size. It settles slowly into a nice blanket. Very good lacing. Very solidly dark beer. Coffee, toffee, chocolate... the usual stout aromas, but they make a strong combination. Surprisingly light-bodied, for the color and aroma, but rich in flavor. An incredibly drinkable stout, I must say!"
"Excellent drinkability, and at 22 ounces a pop, a good time at that. It's a shame though, I only have six of these beauties left. Time to gas up the SUV and get some more."
"Approaching jet black in hue, with a trace hazy deep garnet fringe when held to light. Massed, mountainous, dogged, chestnut brown head leaves wandering, exiguous lace. The aroma is dominated by powdery, dry cocoa with a soft underlay of sharp, carbonaceous roasted barley. Tittle of diacetyl along with understated caramel malt lend a buttery sweet contrast to the roasted presence. Clean, appetizingly burnt in aroma. Roasted barley character is surprisingly tempered in flavor, and runs parallel with a static, toffeeish dark caramel malt backbone. Airy, diffuse, chocolate malt presence is unhindered by the ashen hop bitterness, which in turn only partially offsets caramel malt derived sweetness. Marginally tart, acidic smokey hints along with a brief surge of diacetyl emerge as it breathes. Well calculated in attenuation, with ample dextrins facilitating a soft, yet pleasantly viscous mouthfeel. Finishes cleanly bittersweet, with fading hints of milk chocolate and burnt grain. A well balanced, unique stout with superlative drinkability. Although lower in hop and roasted grain bitterness than many microbrewed examples, malt sweetness never becomes obtrusive. Delicious. Big thanks to Bennybrew for the delivery of a fine Maine brew I've been longing to try. JohnnyP should be proud."
"On the pour a Atramentous color, the head Bunyanesque in size, the consistency that of whipped cream and the color a winsome light chocolate brown, as it dematerializes, a fine covering of lace is left behind to meld with the glass. The aroma that of strong coffee, bittersweet chocolate and lots of malt, sweet and malt-laden is the start, the top full and pleasing to the palate. Finish is crisply acidic, bitter-sweet chocolate aftertaste with the hops persistent and pleasant in their spicy bite, all in all a fine representative to the style."
"Poured dark brown but not quite black with a tan ring of head and many tiny bubbles floating upwards. Also some sediment floating around the bottom of the bottle. Smell was deep with plenty of sweet chocolate aromas and bitter grains. Just a tad bit of alcohol spiciness to round it out. Taste was somewhat raw with minimal coffee flavors, heaped in with an intense dry bitterness imparted from the malts, more chocolate, but in the taste it was lest sweet than the smell, and somewhat grainy hoppy flavor rounds out the taste. There was also a fair bit of alcohol punch to boot. Further down the glass it borders on cloying as the sweet chocolate reasserts itself. Mouthfeel was a little too agressive, not allowing the malts to dominate. Pretty flavorful beer, if at times a little unrefined. There is a fair bit of confusion in the taste without anything mixing very well. Overall worth the purchase though."
"A solid black color, blocking out light. Good choco bubbles. Available at Shaw's or Hannaford's. The tasre is awesome, roasted, malts, cofffee, some bitterness. A well balanced stout. Chewy and quite quaff-able. I could have easily drank this beer all night."
"A big, Acadian thanks to my Maine man bennybrew for the bomber."
"Thanks, Bennybrew!!!"
"Pitch black with a huge, noisy dark tan head. You would have thought with the fizziness of the head that it would have faded quickly, but the fizz subsides eventually and the head sticks around for a while longer. The nose is chocolate, roasty malt, prunes. The flavor is dominated by bitter hops but underneath that are toffee, wood and a hint of milk chocolate. The flavor would be better if they lowered the hops/burnt bitterness and raised the malt profile and complexity but this is still an excellent beer. The mouthfeel is prickly from the high carbonation."
"An opaque black body allows only a thin edge of mahogany to show at the base of the glass. It's topped by a foamy dark tan head that holds with great tenacity, keeping a thin but creamy head throughout the pint. Unfortunately, its lacing is not as good as it's retention and only spotty lace remains. The body is medium/full with a lightly gassy carbonation that softens to become much more creamy as it warms. The nose expresses a berry-like fruitiness, some bittersweet chocolate, soft sweet cocoa, and a light touch of roastiness; all of which are carried over and expounded on in a luxuriously rich and malty flavor that displays bitterness/fruitiness/toffee upfront, followed by bittersweet chocolate and cocoa (and even a touch of coconut) as it crosses the palate before it's firm bitterness and coffee-like roasty edge dry out the long finish. It's exceptionally well-balanced and keeps the palate in sway between the rich sweet malts and firm bitterness, never allowing either side to become cloying. Nicely done, highly enjoyable, and well worth seeking out."
"A huge thanks to my friend JohnnyP for bringing this back from Maine, the man doesn't lie, they can make some awesome beer up there."
"For a dry stout, this beast has real appeal. The deep dark depths of liquid swim beneath a thick frothy mocha head sending of the aroma of deeply felt dark malt. The initial flavor is that of heavy roast and a hint of chocolate enhanced by a well-rooted bitterness. The malt profile, while dry, is still present with enough force to give a thick heavy body. The carbonation is a hint sharp toward the end, but a magnificent monster of a stout."
"This is one of the best stouts I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. It can be hard to find, even here in Portland, Maine, but it is worth seeking out."
"This is an exceptional stout worth seeking out. Guinness drinkers may not recognize this as a dry stout, but stout lovers will recognize it as a fine brew."
"A saucy stout and a fat one at that, full flavoured and quite complex. A very exciting ale to sip and savour as you venture through the 22 ounces."
"Notes: A freagin' outstanding stout! Seems more like a sweet stout though? But, to hell with it ... this is a tasty brew! Massive, complex and thoroughly enjoyable! One of the better stouts to have met my palate in recent days, and one that actually excited my palate. Seek out this beer immediately."
"Dark carmel taste with a hint of chocolate.  very smooth and easy to drink.  rich creamy carmel head that makes your head dizzy from the bubbles.  nice brew"
"Nice dark color with a thick head.  Moderately bitter with lots of malt flavors.  Really nice roasted/chocolate flavors noticeable from the first drop.  One of the best stouts I have had."
