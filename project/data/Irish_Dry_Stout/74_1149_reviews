"O: Not my favorite version of a stout, lacking sweetness and depth. More of an Irish stout than American."
""
""
""
""
""
"Good frothy body and flavor but a bit watery"
""
"Overall: A fine stout, which I would recommend in light of the typical shelf beers which proliferate the liquor stores. However, the ratings posted are seemingly out of reach somewhat  for this brew, at least in my opinion."

"Very sorry I went to this pub.  Food was ok.  But the beers were mediocre to poor."

"Best stout ever!  Brewed in a traditional Irish style, this all-malt stout is well balanced, and packed with roasted flavor.  If in Maine, you need to look for this one.  Sold in bottles and on tap at their Freeport, ME restaurant and pub."

"O: Hands down the best beer Gritty's offers. I would drink it again."
""
"O - Decent stout, mouthfeel is the best."

"o: A surprisingly Belgianish stout, as though some yeast jumped over to Gritty's from Allagash. I was a bit disappointed at the beginning for that reason, since I had been expecting a heavier smokier more traditional stout flavor. But it is tasty enough, and gradually becomes more pleasing until it has warmed over sixty degrees, when it becomes somewhat bitter. The very low ABV allows you to drink the whole bomber and still remain fairly clear-headed."

"Cheers."
"Overall, an excellent Irish Stout. However, the serving temp is very important. ""Above Board"" as I heard a number of Irish bartenders say a while back."

"This is the best regularly available Gritty's brew that I was able to taste. Worth going back for more!"

"O/D-A good nitro offering that I would grab again probably."
"easily the best beer on at grittys, hands down. honestly the only one I had that I would care to drink again. it pours a really dark brown, almost black, letting not a smidge of light pass. the head is only small, but its a clue to the delicious creamy texture of this brew. lots of roast in nose and taste, not quite burnt, but still rather bitter, with faint English hops being detectable in the finish. the flavor fits the style guidelines well, but the mouthfeel is what makes this beer a keeper, its subtle and mellow for a beer as flavorful as this. its got a very full body, and feels like it could have come from a nitro tap, even though it didn't. I liked it more and more as it warmed, and while it might not be the best accompaniment to a lobster roll, it felt right as I drank it. really the only decent beer happening from these guys, so get some while you can."

"A good stout with a nice crisp taste. It was very flavorable and went well with my food. The beer had a thick head that hung around on the glass until the end. The beer had a distinctive smell. The beer is lighter than many stouts and is very easy to drink. Over all a good beer. I wish I could have had another."

"O: This stout seems somewhat lighter compared to other beers in the style but is very easy to drink—that is once the massive head finally subsides. I wouldn’t consider the bottled version to be sessionable but having this on a nitro-tap might be a different story."
""
""
""
"Note: I had this beer maybe 10 years ago and I remember enjoying it then. I'm happy to see my taste for this beer had withstood the test of time."

"22oz bottle. Pours a pitch black color with some brown hues. Over an inch of thick, frothy tan head. Tons of lacing. The aroma is earthy and malty. Slightly sour with an aroma that reminds me a bit of an Oatmeal Stout. The taste is malty with hints of chocolate and earth. Roasty towards the end with a slightly sour finish. Heavily carbonated. Slick, tingly mouthfeel. Overall, good example of the style."
""
"O: The beer is pretty well balanced overall, though the hop flavors are not really pronounced they balance out the sweetness of the malts. Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is just an all-around great beer, and a great representation of the style. It's rich, dark, tasty, and infinitely sessionable. More complex than your average Irish Dry to boot. What more could you want? I wish I could swap out every Guinness tap around me with this stuff."

"O: I really liked this one! Probably one of the best stouts I've had in a long while. I think that this one is a must try!"

"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, the beer is jet black, with a brown highlight around the edges. There is a thin film of milk-chocolate colored head that coats the top of the brew. Aromas are of deep coffee, campfire smoke and char, very bitter and dark chocolate, and some sharp spicing throughout (maybe some cinnamon and pepper). Flavors are light and very dry, with a dark roasted coffee ground flavor front and center, followed by campfire smoke and a meaty highlight. The body is light, smooth, and extremely dry, which is a perfect representation of the style. The aftertaste is mostly smoke, with a rich and semisweet highlight. The finish is dry, and extremely clean. Chocolatey notes finish off as the flavors clear. Very tasty beer...great for a campfire!"
"I originally reviewed this as a regular stout, it makes a bit more sense as an Irish Dry. I will try another bottle soon to see if this one was not good and fresh."
"Definitely worth trying and is highly recommended."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer and thought it was well done, although I think it would benefit from CO2 as opposed to nitrogen. Still, it’s worth a shot however you find it."
"The darker flavors are the first on the tongue, and dominate most of the mouthful, bringing notes of burnt grains and chocolate malts, tobacco, dark toffees, black coffee, caramelized brown sugar, and dark fruit esters. The tobacco and burnt-black grains came on stronger near the end of the mouthful for me, and stuck around on my soft palate for quite awhile after I'd swallowed. Hops add a nice background bitter fuzz, but manage to avoid the grapefruity, floral notes that can come along with that--notes which would be unwelcome in a beer such as this. I was surprised, however, that the brew lacked the viscosity that I'd expected, given the massive number of ingredients, and the mouthfeel came across as even thinner than a soda. This was slightly unsatisfying, but the fullness of the flavors went a long way towards making up for it."
"The feel is light and fluffy with soft carbonation."
"Very drinkable, it doesn't taste as dark as it actually is."
"This is a deep, solid black color with a thick brown head. It's a very nice-looking stout. The taste is interesting...licorice, barley, roasted malt, and some spicy hops. There's also a bit of sour-candy smell that's just a little off-putting. The taste is dry...way dry. Astringent and a little tart. The licorice character is a lot more pronounced in the taste. Dry and slightly light finish. Medium to light body. All in all, this is a pretty forgettable stout."
"M/D: Full bodied, carbonation is low. Very drinkability. Good beer."
"Very dry finish. Excellent stout. Low ABV makes it really drinkable. And super tasty."
"Overall, this was pretty good. I will try and sample Gritty's other offerings when possible."
"From the 22 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on July 17, 2010. The pour is rich black with about a half inch of silky tan head and excellent lacing. The aroma is full of grains and charcoal fired malts with a notable but light hoppiness. The taste is nice and dry, dark, and decent with hops. I could not quite define it but it wasn't bad at all."
"Drinkability: Very good stout. Easy to drink. I would recommend this to anyone."
"Have been a recent stout convert and am truly finding that there are some great craft breweries out there. This is one of them."
"D - 4.1%??? Wow, tons of body and flavor for this abv."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonanation, smooth and creamy. Kind of a neat dry cocoa powder finish. A pretty quality stout."
"Could knock a couple of these down a night good drinkablity."
"This brew does not apologize for it's strength, it wallows in it, for better or for worse. I will not give it extremely high or low marks, but getting critical about stouts is tough. The style is powerful and thus can hide all sorts of imperfections, but it also carries baggage. This one is generally good, and I would both buy it again and try other things from this company. It FEELS like a Maine stout should."
"D: I could've stayed in the bar all night and kicked back a bunch of theses."
"Overall very drinkable and definitely above-par."
"Not great but Im not into the Dry Irish stouts so much"
"Good stuff."
"Pitch black colored beer with a slowly fading creamy brown head.Aroma is chocolate.Taste is cocoa and coffee.This is too thin and watery for me to rate this any higher.Overall though it's pretty decent and something I would purchase and recommend to my buddies."
"D- I could have drank quite a few of these."
"Drinkability: I could have a couple of these again. It is very dry and solid."
"D - The low ABV made this really easy to drink. I could see this being a great replacement for Guinness - much more flavor to it."
"M + D: Lighter, as they often are... There is a soft creaminess there, carbonation has a little bite. Pretty good... full flavoured for an Irish Dry."
"Drinkability is awful. I really didn't like this one, and I was disappointed because I have liked all of the other Gritty beers I have tried."
"D: This one went down in a heartbeat. Very easy drinking."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable stout that represents Gritty's well. I would pick this up again if I was looking for a good coffee stout."
"Features a slightly chocolatey albeit chalky flavor. Flavor is pretty straight forward, blackened, not overly sweet malt, the standard gritty's feel (prolly from the yeast), and a bit of hops. Little thin, not quite watery but feels like there should be something a little more. Very drying, leaves my mouth parched after. Very drinkable, no bad flavors or kickbacks or anything. If you're looking for a sessionable, low-powered stout that still has a flavor, this is a good bet."
"Pretty much poundable. Enough flavor to keep you interested, but but thin enough to allow multiples."
"D - This one was better than I had anticipated. There is a good deal of earthy hop bitterness in here, which was surprising. Overall, this is a solid Irish stout."
"I have tried and enjoyed this one several time but this review is based off a sampling at the brewery in Auburn, ME. From a nitro-tap this brew was an opaque black color with a one finger head of mocha-like foam. The retention of the tight cap was good and the lacing off it in thick sheets was outstanding. The aroma was soft but appropriate, roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate with a general dryness. The flavors were similar, with an added elements of caramel sweetness and a bitter, coffee finish. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body slightly watery and the carbonation a little too soft. But it was still very sessionable for a dark brew and a great example of the style that I will happily enjoy again."
"D - Being a Dry Irish Stout fan, I could drink this all night long. Low on alcohol, great mouthfeel, real easy to drink. Beamish still has my number one spot, but this beats out O'Hara's. Unless we're talking about Grittys on nitro-tap, then it's by far my favorite Irish Stout."
"D - Drinkability is good. The classic stout characteristics are present and come together in a nice way for this beer. The only material flaw is the over carbonation. Normally this is something that can correct itself as the beer warms but this one just couldn't get it done. Overall it is a good beer that I could recommend to anyone that likes a good stout."
"A great dry stout, i prefer this very much over guiness. Has a better taste and more drinkable in my opinion."
"Aromas of roast barley, clean sweet malt and a faint sharp acrid note like bitter espresso. Flavor is similar with initial malt sweetness accompanied by roasted barley/coffee flavor and tarrish molasses.. Light acrid/acidic brightness leading into the dry and lightly minerally finish. Overall very nice but the over carbonation accentuates the more bitter & acrid elements of the flavor."
"My expectations where met and is good for style."
"Picked this up on a recent trip to Maine. Beer pours a jet black in the glass with about a 1/4 inch tan head with some evidence of lace. It smells creamy and sweet, hints of burnt malt and slight chocolate. Taste is on par with the smell - bitter roasted malt at first that then fades to smooth chocolately flavor. Medium-heavy body slight carbonation. It's a decent stout, though I've had better."
"The taste is definitely light bodied, yet with deep roasted grains, some fruitiness behind the largely dry character to the beer, and an almost charred coffee and chocolate flavor. The wateriness of the beer, the roasted dry malts, the charred coffee and chocolate flavors, and the slight fruitiness in the background make this an interesting, slightly complex, and eminently drinkable stout. The mouthfeel is a tad oily, and the aftertaste is very thin. A nice change up and worth seeking out."
"This is a very nice full bodied stout with a thick head when poured. It has a dark color with a nice balance of malt and hops. The taste is rich and full, rich taste with a hint of sweetness and cocoa. I could make this a regular in my refrigerator. A very nice stout."
"Really enjoy it."
"A lot thinner tasting than it looks, i liked that. I expected a meal and got a dessert. Bra-vo. One of my new favorite porter/stout beers."
"I may get this again in the future but am in no rush."
"Poured from a bomber into two pint glasses. Extremely dark black color, with a moderately sized brown head. Lots of carbonation for a stout. Smelled a lot like coffee rinds. Taste was somewhat on the bitter side, as it really had a roasted barley flavor to it. Not much sweetness to act as a counterbalance at all. Reminded me a lot of a Guinness Extra Stout. For the style, it was dead on: drinkable, but with enough dryness to not be a session beer. This was a nice change of pace from other stouts that I have had lately. Not many local brewers can do an Irish Dry Stout and have it taste this authentic. Good job Gritty's."
"I first tasted this on draft at Gritty's in Freeport and was great on a warm day for lunch. Definitely give this one a try."
"Nothing special. Wont actively seek this brew again."
"Overall, Black Fly Stout is a pretty good Dry Stout that is recommended."
"D: I would imagine this would be even more drinkable a tad bit warmer than I drank it (right out of the fridge.) After Yankee Brew News' latest edition about session beers, this would be on the list. Surprising, for a stout."
"Notes: Saw this case and got excited. Had it on tap years ago at the brewery while in Maine. This bottle does not do the tap version justice. As far as the excessive head, ? problem at the brewery?"
"Drink'em if ya got'em..."
"I'm done with this one. Not good -- love your label though!"
"I'd consider this one of Gritty's best beers. If you're looking for another Maine-brewed stout also check out Bar Harbor's Cadillac."
"Gritty McDuff's Black Fly Stout pours an opaque black with a chocolate milk colored head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is malty, perhaps a bit of chocolate. The mouthfeel is very thin. Bitter chocolate and coffee flavors are definitely front and center. A bit on the bitter side. Some nutiness as the beer warms. I think I'd like a little more body, but it's definitely a decent stout. Definitely worth a try."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Perfectly dry with a big black coffee flavor. Moderate bitterness, largely from the dark malts; no noticeable hop character. There's a slight metallic twang to the finish along with a hint of acidity - overall it's not quite as clean as I would like, but it's certainly not bad. Body is on the lighter side, even for the style it's a bit watery."
"D: very nice session stout, but a little thin, as I am use to extreme brews."
"Pours a deep black color with a tall and medium bodied tan head that laces the glass nicely all the way down. The smell is of really of deep roasted malts, some caramel, chocolate, and coffee aromas. Really nice taste too - deep roasted malts, chocolatey flavors, some nice caramel flavors intertwined with nice coffee flavors. It has a really velvety and warming mouthfeel that really is nice and makes it a very drinkable stout. Well worth it."
"All round, really lacking in flavor"
"Black Fly Stout is my third Gritty McDuff's brew and is probably my least favorite. It's still good beer, though, and is probably a gotta-have for dark beer lovin' BAs in the state of Maine."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, leaving about a half of an inch of tan head, which quickly receded. The brew is dark black in color. The nose is dominated by chocolate with some coffee notes. Maybe a hint of fruit. Tasted of chocolate and coffee, and some roasty malt. Mouthfeel is silky and on the thin side. Very smooth and easy to drink."
"Black in color, no ruby notes around the edge. Tan head that drops quickly and only manages to leave the faintest lacing. Smell of chocolate and coffee and some cherry in the background. Also a little bit of burnt smokeyness. Taste matches the smell but it's really the finish that makes this stand out. It finishes so dry and clean with no aftertaste. It's not a lack of flavors upfront because it's a tasty medium bodied beer, but it's just a surprizingly clean fishish. Overall a very good brew. The best of the Gritty variety case and the only one that seemed to match up to what is available fresh at the brewpub."
"That said, Black Fly Stout is a very easy drinking stout thanks largely in part to the well crafted body of the offering along with the emphasis placed upon providing nothing but an excellent tasting version of an Irish dry stout."
"tasted on 2/6/08"
"a great session stout"
"Black Fly is atop the beer menu board in Gritty's for a reason. Our drafts arrived with copious head that diminished to a nice, sticky lace, smelling of dark roasted malt with a hint of dry spruce and Starbuck's coffee. Delicious, but oddly not all that filling for a stout; smooth (if maybe a little watery at the end) in the mouth with a surprisingly clean finish. Good enough to drink a few, for sure."
"Pours a nice dark black color, nice carbonation, huge foamy tan head, lots and lots of sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is malty, some toffee/caramel. The taste is malty, with some toffee/caramel. The finish is slightly dry/bitter. Medium body. Drinkable, a pretty tasty/sessionable brew."
"Pours a dark opaque cola color with a moderate dark and frothy khaki head with great retention that hung around for most of the drink. For aroma there was a rich dark roasted nature with a bit of dried fruitiness (cherries) and oats. An oily slick mouthful with a dark burnt roastedness fills the mouth gently warming and yielding to a slighty smokey and dark roasted coffee flavor. There is a very nice bold and charred bitterness and woodiness to this beer. The dried cherries, dark roasted coffee and burnt roasted malts all blend together almost seamlessly producing a light bodied dark roasted flavor. There is definitely a nice dried fruitiness from the cherries emerging in the middle of the palate before finishing with a nice charred and smoky lacing on the tongue. The texture is very smooth overall, light to medium body and with a soft carbonation. The drinkability is fairly good per style."
"D: With a low ABV this beer is quite drinkable and a great beer to chill with during the summer months or curling up in the winter."
"Other: Early Impressive Characteristics Simply Cannot Make Up for the Unsophisticated Texture and Low Alcohol Content."
"D: Very well done. One of my favorite stouts. Light enough to drink several. Yet, flavorful enough to pair with a variety of foods."
"D: Decent drinkability. The bitterness cuts it down quite a bit. Overall a decent stout."
"D - Average at best. Not nearly enough flavor and all that fizzy feel makes it filling, yet not satisfying."
"Overall, a fairly drinkable stout. Not my favorite though."
"A nice easy drinking beer. Sorry I only purchased one"
"Easy drinking with a nice malty character. This would be even better if the carbonation were reigned in a bit. The taste and low abv make this a fine choice for a ""session"" stout. Perhaps I just got an overcarbonated batch - otherwise fine."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a towering tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry roasted scent that boasts of patent and roasted malts. It is quite dry to the nose. The taste is average. It has a weak, black malt flavor that is bitter and earthy. It has some roasted malt taste, but not enough to round out the flavor. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an average dry stout. The malt bill is simplistic, so the taste lacks complexity. This is a very uninteresting beer."
"Pours a deep opaque espresso brown with a thin but well structured head. Aromatics of carob, dark chocolate, chicory and marshmallow rise from the glass. A somewhat lean stout based on weight and structure; fresh and delicious and easy to consume, this is a nice departure from the heavyweight super endowed stouts that are in fashion now. This is a great beer with or without food as the mouth coating malts make for a great side to a nice meal or just simply a meal in itself. Light sweetness, ample malting and a well-defined recipe make this a very satisfying stout to enjoy anyplace-anytime. Well done!!"
"The feel is dry and ashy. Smooths out as it warms up. Quite thick, actually; substantial. I really like this one this time around: thick, bitter, smooth but dry, all at once. It's black coffee."
"Pours a five-fingered light tan rocky head that slowly fades to a thin layer leaving some lace. Solid black color. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Burnt coffee nose. Flavor is burnt coffee/chocolate, slight dry finish. $1.50 for a 12 oz bottle from Capital Convenience Concord, NH."
"D - Good drinkability -- has all the characteristics of an Irish Dry Stout."
"D- the best irish dry stout I have tasted to date and one I will have again and again"
"Pours a pitch black color with decent carbonation. Aroma is strong with coffee notes. Taste is similar, except that the mouthfeel is somewhat thin. Roast coffee with just a tiny hint of sweet chocolate in the finish. Not too bad for a stout. It's definitely a stout for one thing and a good one."
"pours pitch black from the bottle with a brown two finger head that settles to just cover the beer with some spotty lacing. no light comes through the glass with this beer. aromas of roasted malt and coffee, taste is same with a slight bitterness at the back of the palate and a dry finish. mouthfeel light, nicely carbonated. drank three from the sampler pack and could have drank three more. very nice beer."
"The deep darkness of this ""black"" stout is enticing but in the pour you immediately note the intense carbonation. Hard to keep it in my pint glass. The aroma of this lively concoction is solidly coffee to me, a nice mellow overtone of chocolatey sweetness. But even before it hits your mouth you sense the bubbling crispness of this stout. It explodes over the tongue, almost like a soda, surprisingly refreshing for a stout. It finally quiets into a pleasant reminder of the same flavors anticipated in the aroma. I was surprised by the soda-like quality and at first disappointed in comparison to my first taste on draught at the Portland pub. But ultimately I did like it and think it will be a great complement to the upcoming summer beer schedule!"
"Holy crap! A gentle pour yielded a gigantic quantity of tan foam... I could only get half the bottle in a pint glass. The beer itself was pretty much black, but had chestnut edges. The foam settled quickly to a marshmallowy cap with some chunky lacing left behind. Aromas were mostly malty, plenty of character from roasted barley. Nuts, roast, and chocolate were all present. Mild bitterness, balanced towards sweetness. A little dry. Caramel, a bit of roast towards the end. The initial CO2 release left the body feeling a little flat. Otherwise it had a nice texture. Not bad, but I may have had an overcarbonated bottle. I'd give it another shot."
"Drinkability - Oh yeah. Very refreshing and easy to drink, not at all overpowered by chocolate and coffee flavors. Just a healthy smattering of roasted barley, nearly perfect for an Irish Stout. Thank you sir, may I have another?"
"Beer pours to a pitch black color with a medium sized darker tan head that falls away pretty quickly but does leave some nice lacing. Has a nice smell of roasted/slightly burnt malts that give off some chocolate and coffee aromas, very inviting. The taste is very good; burnt flavors come out and mix in real nice with chocolate, coffee, maybe some caramel and a break at the tail end of hops which wrap things up well. Possesses a dry feel with some good carbonation that tingles the tongue. This is a very nice offering from Grittys, I am glad to have finally given it a try and will look for it in the future."
"Kinda meh, about this one. Nothing really stood out to me although I could see this being quite sessionable for some people."
"I distinctly remember the first draught pint of Black Fly I had years ago. It was at the brewpub in Portland and it was served at cellar temp on a warm summer day. It was the most delicious beer I had ever tasted. This bottle doesn't quite have that magic but it stands up to the memory well enough. Gritty's still makes a hell of a good stout and at 4.10% abv its a session beer to boot. Still one of my favorites."
"I thought this was an American stout until I looked on here to see it's a Irish stout. Changes things a bit. I gave it better marks is light of this."
"Overall a very nice dry stout. A very drinkable treat on St. Patrick's Day. I will buy again."
"Drinkability - Roasted, hints of chocolate. Dark coffee."
"Poured into a pint glass. Beest by March 2007 notched on label. Upon opening after removing from fridge, beer started foaming. Produced excessive amounts of foram. Poured a solid black color with a dark brown head. Aroma was malty with a hint of coffee and sweetness. The flavor was also slightly sweet. If the beer lingered in the mouth, it would leave a slighty bitter aftertaste, otherwise decent flavorings. Was not impressed with the mouthfeel, seemed to be too much carbonation."
"Creamy and smooth with active carbonation. Easy drinking and at only 4.1%, absolutely a good session beer."
"its not a heavy stout that you drink one and are done"
"Drinkability: A session stout. I've drank a few of these in a night, and at 4 percent, you can drink many."
"Overall- A good looking and good feeling beer that produces a nice tasting Stout. This is too easy to drink!!"
"Pours black. Massive tan head, with good retention, and lacing. Smell is not strong. Roasted malts, and hops mostly. Body is thin,and carbonated. Taste is hopped up front, with a dry roasted malt finish. This is not my favorite style of beer, but you may like this one if It's yours."
"Revisited this one and it was a totally different experience this time. Aroma of roasted malts, very clean and mellow. No sourness to be found this time, just a robust rich flavor with hints of chocolate and smokey malt. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, quite good really. First time must have been some bad bottles. My score reflects the update."
"12oz bottle, best before Nov 06. Pours black with an amazingly huge head. Now I'm not the most patient pourer in the world, but I can't seem to pour this one into a small glass without over half of it being head! Quite funny actually. I don't drink much stout, so take my review with a grain of malt. Aroma is fairly malty and leaves some of the head on my nose. Nice earthy flavour with some coffee aftertaste. Not bad."
"22 oz bomber with no freshness date to speak of. Opaque black body with few-fingers thick tan head that dissipates a tad quickly and leaves a fair bit of lacing. Smells mostly hoppy with some roast. Bitter anyways. Hops dominate the flavor, while roast or burnt malt play a big role too. Flavor is not overwealmingly strong. Not watery per se, but not as robust as some porters and stouts. A little more hop bitterness than I generally like in a stout. Fairly heavy-bodied. It's an okay beer overall though, worthwhile to try and have once in a while from a very worthwhile brewery. To be fair, the bottle might be a little old, though not expired."
"Poured a huge thick beige head. Solid black in color. Has a balanced aroma of malts,roasted grains,and hops. Leaves a bitter very dry coffee like finish. Mouthfeel is a bit too foamy and not what I like in a stout. Full bodied with definate coffee and slight chocolate taste. A very impressive offering from Gritty's. Being so dry on the finish drinkability might be an issue with these. Nicely carbonated."
"Gritty McDuff's Black Fly Stout is a very enjoyable version of an Irish Dry Stout. I must confess, that initially, I was not enthralled from my first exposure. However, this is worthy of giving a go. As subsequent samplings (perhaps unintentional aging is a factor here). It pours a nice dark color with a monster sized head. The smell is malty. The taste is a very nice balance of sweet malt and slight burnt coffee bittering. It has a nice dry mouthfeel indeed. A nicely drinkable stout."
"This is a light-weight stout that's easy to drink and refreshing to boot. Does not lack in good stout flavors though."
"Very sweet brew with a cafe mocha and vanilla flavor taking over. Though it would be described as ""creamy"" it wasn't hearty or chewy. Nice to have on a warm summer evening, it came off as a sweeter Guinness. A bit more carbonated than expected. Overall, not bad, just a little more sweet and not with as much bite."
"Drinkability: Not a bad beer, but not my favorite style, either. Still, a good change of pace from the beers I have been drinking lately."
"This was a black, black color with a thick coffee-colored head. It had a predominately coffee aroma, with a little bit of roasted grain. Taste was all coffee, but maybe a little chocolate snuck in. I thought it was a little thin in the mouthfeel department, but still very drinkable. If you like stout, you'll like this beer. If you're not a big stout fan, forget it."
"D - high, if you like this kind, which i do"
"Red-tinged darkness, nearly black. Thin off-white head. Serious roast in the nose, like coffee grounds. Also a sharp, slightly sour tang. This reminds me of McNeill's brews -- probably because I just had one before this -- but it has that same slightly sour taste off the bat that is intense when cold, slightly annoying bu more subdued when warm. This also has a huge dark ash flavor, like licking a campfire. Rather thin on the mouthfeel, and not particularly exciting enough to invite another pint. A bit one-dimensional."
"This was an enjoyable and sessionable stout. Had several of these over St. Pat's day and can easily see this as my beer of choice on that and other occasions. An enjoyable New England beer."
"A very good traditional stout, but falls short of being a great one."
"Comments: This was an average stout, but not my favorite. The high carbonation & thin, watery body makes for a slightly different twist on a regular stout. I did like the flavor & drinkability, but would choose a smoother, less carbonated stout in the future if looking for a beer in this style."
"A pleasant tasting Dry Stout. The carbonation is overpowering and takes away from some of this stout's true flavors."
"Pours a red-tinged black with a lasting brown head. Decent amount of lace. Faint dark malt aroma. Mild flavor of dark malt and a subtle hint of coffee. Unfortunately thin body, somewhat watery. Once again, an odd metallic and grain hull aftertaste. I don't find this to be a very good beer, but I suppose it would be drinkable, but the wateriness would get to me pretty quickly."
"Meh, not my favorite stout ever. It was very pretty- sooo dark and great head and lacing. But that was about the only thing I really enjoyed here. The smell had coffee and woodyness going on, but nothing very complex. Taste was more coffee, some biscuit- and something I really didn't dig. Almost a rootbeer gone bad flavor. Mouthfeel was way too watery and thin. Just not my favorite- I'd like to try it on draft, though..."
"Dark and opaque, pours with a thick, fluffy head. Pretty good head retention. Roasted malt aroma, with some chocolate, toffee. A little nutty too. Malty in flavor, chocolatey, hints of toffee, and a mild background bitterness. Slightly thin mouthfeel with pretty good carbonation."
"Here's a real fun one! Pours as black as night with a semi-chocolate-y smell and taste. It's so dark and thick, that you can't see through it at all. It has a rich, full mouthfeel and goes down pretty easy, all things considered. This is a stout that you can put down a lot of without it becoming a problem. Very good but kinda hard to find."
"This beer is definitely superior on draught. This was one of my favorites at the pub when living ME in the 90s, but from the bottle it didnt have the same complexity of flavor or creamy mouthfeel from the nitro. The abundance of carbonation may have really thrown things off, but his is still a tasty dry stout. Certainly more complex than the most common Irish versions of the sample I've tried. I'll try to review it on draught the next time I'm in ME."
"Pours a deep, dark, inky black topped by a small khaki-colored head. Aroma of rich roasted malt, dark fruit, and a touch of espresso. Medium-bodied (for a stout) with a nice creamy mouthfeel. Roasted malt is the main component of the palate, balanced by a nice but subdued hop profile, accented by espresso, dark fruit, and a touch of something akin to Horlick's malt. Finishes dry and slightly smoky. A nice, easy-drinking stout, brewed at one of the friendliest places I visited in Maine."
"Good initial head on black, lace. Smoke and coffee aroma. Taste of wood, smoke, coffee, chocolate malt,a spot of fuitiness, drying finish. Licorice on aftertaste. Good for its style, well malted but in a word balanced and very quaffable. Medium mouthfeel."
"Pours a dark brown almost black tint with a finger and a half brown head that leaves an abundance of lace as it goes down. Smells roasty, chocolatey, smokey goodness. It also smelled kind of like chalk dust to me... Mouthfeel is nice and goes down smoothly with a good fizzz. Leaves an irish cream taste in your mouth with highlights of chocolate, caramel, and roated malts. Very drinkable stout--Could have a few of these in a sitting. Probably Gritty's best beer as the malt notes hide the butteryness."
"An ink black color with a massive three finger head that lasts.A nice coffee smell with a bit of sweetness mixed in.The taste is a dry,coffee,chocolate,and cola like flavor.It has a slight hickory smokieness to start and ends with a sweet aftertaste.This has a medium feel,a little light for my taste,but not bad.This is a good offerring from Gritty's and I'm sure I'll have more of this."
"And, heck, even with that flavor issue I'm still gonna say that it's highly drinkable - under certain circumstances. So, hey, watch your circumstances and enjoy a pint! Cheers!"
"Medium / heavy in body. Crisp at the start. The finish is dry and crisp. The roasted malt and bitter chocolate linger long on the tongue. Superb drinkability. Definitely one to seek out."
"Very rich and easy going down, very good session brew."
"heavenly dry stout on nitro-tap. my preferred gritty's brew."
"Solid near-pitch-black pour with a frothy tan head that held well and laced. A ton of baker's chocolate on the nose, some caramel, some oat bread. Not much coffee on the nose to me but plenty of roaster malts/coffee/cocoa on the tongue. Very smooth and agreeable all-around, nicely drinkable."
"It pours a nice black color with a 3 finger head that falls to a sparse coating over top. A little too much head on the pour, but still where I want it after all is done. The nose is very nice and roasty. Good burnt malts come through. Light chocolate and coffee also comes through. I like it. The flavor is a little less bold than the nose. There are burnt malt notes, coffee bitterness coming through. It finishes nice and dry. Good flavor and a nice finish. The feel is moderate with a light carbonation. Overall, I really enjoy this brew. I had a bit earlier this week and was nit sure, but this bottle has me hooked. Very good beer. Smooth and enjoyable."
"A good American attempt of an Irish Stout. Looks dark black with an off white head that lasts. Low carbonation and rich looking. Smells lightly malty with caramel, roasted, toasted, and chocolate malts. No hop aroma. Tartness that is associated with cherries. Tastes largely of roasted malt and chocolate malt. Sweet caramel malts in the background. Firm, medium body holds on til the finish. Finishes dry and crisp. A creamy beer even without the nitro. Flavors give way to carcoal like finish makes this beer a little abrupt, but still a good beer."
"Awesome balanced taste: notes of coffee, caramel, cream, spicy bittering hop. Full bodied with a slightly high carbonation. The aftertaste is similar to unsweetened cocoa. This truly makes up for the initial impression."
"I'd recommend this one to anyone who loves the style, and even those who aren't."
"The smell is milk chocolatey, toasted malt and citrus rind. The taste is a dark roast malt flavor.. it fills out the profile, but keeps a good balance for the style. There is again milk chocolate, citrus.. banana.. Mouthfeel: Clean, dry, with an abrupt finish. I wouldn't mind drinking a few more of these."
"On-Tap @ Gritty McDuff's Portland, ME. A dark, nearly opaque brew, this one is. With a nice tan/khaki head on top. Aromas are very buttery, and English toffee like as well. Roasted malts are in there and sweet coffee makes an appearance as well. But where are the hops hidin', you may ask? I dunno. The taste is a bit better than the aromas, as some fersh hops are found in the back of this brew. The malt backbone is solidly great and the coffee and chocolate flavors work well with this here yeast and these diacetyl flavors. Mouthfeel is a bit light, but smooth. Drinkability is very good. A nice one from Gritty's."
"Thanks to Sulldaddy for this one. Obtained March 2005 and consumed about a week later. Bottled March 2005. Pours a ridiculous nine (maybe ten) finger dead-brown head over a pitch black liquid. Smells of almost nothing. Water? WTF, this isn't shaping up very good. Very gentle roast and a vegetable that is likely the hops. Immediate taste is lightly sugary with light roast coming in shortly thereafter. As the swallow starts, I get some chocolate with a hint of molasses. Hops rise in the aftertaste with an oily aromatic Fuggles quality. Medium bodied and a bit more carbonated than I would like (which is surprising, as I would have expect all the carbonation to have blown out with the head I got). A light cherry sour sits on my tongue afterward in an interesting twist. Too bad the bottle was way overcarbonated. I only got a half a beer out of it and can't review any more. After a bad start, it the mix of flavors was getting interesting. The smell has changed and there is noticable chocolate, molasses, and coffee to be gleaned from my empty glass."
"A very pleasant stout. I could easily drink this one all night. Carbonation is great, taste is fantastic. I wish Irish pubs would serve this instead of Guinness!"
"Once I get beyond what my be a fluke and an off batch of this beer, I like it. I was hoping for more, but this is a nice Northern New England version of an Irish Dry Stout...with the creamy diacetyl and all."
"Inky black color with a pleasant creamy off white head. Mild roast hop aroma with hints of dark chocolate and coffee. The taste is very subtle. Layers of roast malt. A little chocolate backed by a mild bitterness. Creamy smooth mouth feel very drinkable. This is a very subtle beer. A pretty good beer of the style, but the soft flavors are a little too tame for me."
"Black perfection with a finger's worth of milk chocolate cream on top. Sweet chocolate aroma. Wonderful texture, silky smooth and rich. Chocolate and coffee flavors with no burnt or smoky tones. Slight citrus hops. One of those beers that you know you're going to have two at the first sip."
"a nice stout from the gritty's folks. it pours a damn near black colour with a moderate tan head that leaves only minimal residue on the glass, which was a bit perplexing to me. the smell is of roasted malt, chocolate, a touch of sweetness and a touch of coffee as well. the flavour incorporates everything listed above into a creamy goodness that is spot on in terms of balance. chocolate and malt mix evenly throughout, with the start being a bit sweeter and the finish holding a touch of hop and coffee for a dry flavour that hits the spot. the fullness and creaminess of this brew are simply outstanding. this is a nice example of the style. recommended."
"This is one of the most well-balanced stouts I've come across. Poured a delightful, inky black with a mocha colored head. Roasted malt aroma with a hint of sweetness. Nicely roasted malt flavors that retained a nice, fresh aspect. Firm bittering at the finish, juxteposed against a bit of sweetness that almost, but not quite, ventured into sweet stout territory. Exceptional drinkability, one of those beers that seems to just evaporate from the glass. Thanks to Far333 for this gem."
"Had this on tap at Redbones. And yes I know the nitro-tap probably minused 25% or more of the flavor, but big deal, it was one beer. Pour was very very dark, rosy tones on the bottom of the pint. 1/3 inch of thick tan foam on top. Aroma consisted of roasted and dark chocolate notes (trying to decide if it's 60 or 70% cocoa solids, ha!). Mouthfeel is smooth and thin. Beer is all about the roasted finish with alcohol dryness coming in at the very end. Nice to try it this way."
"has a sweet aroma to it with roated barley character that you would typically find in a dry stout but does have a subtle hop aroma. smooth and nicley balanced very excellent marriage between the roasted barley and hops are barely noticable. very well brewed and very drinkable."
"Smooth and tasty, with very good drinkability. A must try, American dry stout."
"Drinkability: Like Nina Simone, I need a little sugar in my bowl. This was enjoyable, overall, but I'm looking for something else in a stout, namely bittersweetness and roasted malts."
"The color of this beer is dark brown/nearly ink black. I had a big light brown/dark beige head. There was chocolate and coffee in the aroma, with just a hint of licorice. The chocolate and coffee flavors ended with a smooth roasted bitterness. It seemed kind of watery on the tongue and there was a prickely carbonation sensation that was a little more than I would have liked."
"It finishes dry and clean."
"Thanks to PBrian for this addition."
"Poured an opaque deep brownish black into an imperial pint glass, with a small toffee-colored head, which was gone within minutes. Sparse lace present during the drinking experience. Essences of coffee and burnt grain make their aromas known delicately, no overpowering smells here. Taste continues along the same lines, with bitterness entering the flavor equation late, and then closes out with a heightening of the initial flavors. Drinkability gets an upswing because it seems not as hearty as some of the other brews in its style. An acceptable representation of the style, but not the top of the heap."
" The dark black beer had a hint of red if the light caught it just right. Its head was a light brown. The aroma was of roasted malt, which was also the primary flavor. The flavor was incredibly rich with strong coffee notes and a hint of caramel. The only drawback was it's relative lack of complexity. It's still a very drinkable beer."
"An all around above average stout...nice dark color with a ""chunky"" head and nice lacing. Smell was smoky, taste was well rounded with smoky undertones. Aftertaste was slightly bitter in a nice way. Mouthfeel was medium with a very drinkable quality. This brew is a good representation of the category. Recommend trying."
"My wife actually drank this while there in Portland and I tasted a little o it and here is what I got from it.Pours a deep black with red highlights showing thru a deep almond colored light creamy head.I noticed somebitterness in the aroma with some dark roast coffee,flavor is of unsweetened chocolate and some earthiness with that bitterness I got in the aroma popping up in the finish.All in all seemed to be a pretty solid stout."
"The body was black with ruby edges. I was getting smoke out the wazoo with this beer, but I don't see any mention of smoke elsewhere, but I swear it was there. A good bit of chocolate and a little roast support it. I'm not big on the smoke, but it wasn't quite too much for this beer."
"A very nice stout. Probably one of my favorites for a nitro tap."
"Black as night with superb lacing and stick. Sampled at Gritty's in Freeport (great place for a beer by the way!). I loved the nitro head with its luxuriously creamy head. Aromas included bitter and sweet, with chocolate and espresso dominating. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and oh so silky due to the nitro tapage package. The carbonation was subdued and done just right. The taste was the clincher in this one! Awesome flavors featuring again bittersweet chocolate, tang hop and a a sublime roasted malt character. This was an easy to enjoy stout and one not pass up if you find it!"
"I'm a little surprised to see this one ranked above Gritty's others. The Best Bitter and Best Brown really rocked my socks off but this one seemed a little bland. I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a huge fan of plain jane stouts, but c'mon, dude, seriously. Seriously. Gritty might have made a good stout for the stout lover, but not for the ambidextrous beer drinker."
"Hits the tongue with bitter roasted malt. Fades to smooth chocolately flavor. Medium-heavy body with that burnt malt lingering on the back of the tongue. Very drinkable and affordable. A solid local stout."
"Pours a black with a tan head. Good roasty burnt style flavors with an underlying fruity stout feel. Nice mouthfeel and drinkability. Solid balance. This would be a real treat on creamy nitro, but still quite nice in the bottle. One of the better stouts available around the east coast."
"Pours jet black with a beautiful tan/espresso colored head. Great retention and lacing. Smells of dark malts, coffe, chocolate, all the good stuff. The taste just envelopes your palate. Dark malts, followed by slightly dry malt, no bitter finish, just wonderful. Mouthfeel is what you'd expect from a stout, thick and hearty. Highly drinkable. The draught version is definitely superior to the bottle IMHO. A must drink brew when you can get some."
"It's really black. Light doesn't get through at all. Big, fat, lumpy, brown, foamy head. Starts out an inch high and settles out a bit, but never really leaves. The inside of the glass is coated as the head slides down. Aroma is full of different smells - roasted malt, chocolate, bits of coffee and raisin, and some hops. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, moderate to low carbonation. Bitter chocolate and coffee flavor, roasted malt, and raisin. Bitter tingly aftertaste sits in the roof of my mouth. Flavor gets bigger and rounder with each sip. Great stuff."
"Thanks to paceyourself for wending it my way!"
"This one pours a dark blood black,like the blood seen through a black fly's belly. It's topped with a brown,rocky foam,nice and thick. It has a sweet coffee aroma with lots and lots of roast on the nose.It is a lighter,drinkable stout with a little dark fruit and malt sweet flavor and a roasty,dry finish.An enjoyable offering sent out by Bierman9."
"Pours dark brown almost black in color, nice thick creamy head,dark roasty smokey coffee aroma, light body a little thin on the tongue, but has some nice chocolate-coffee flavor, nice roasty bitterness in the finish, a good solid stout, could drink another."
"Overall Black Fly Stout is a very drinkable stout that is good year round. I believe that it is smoother on tap and more drinkable than in the bottle."
"Black in color with limited ruby highlights at the base but some wider glints of dark mahogany at the rim. The full, dark tan head drops shortly but keeps a thin surface coating and leaves some spotty lace. The aroma offers rich dark chocolate and espresso. The body is light with a very fine, median carbonation that leaves it gently zesty in the mouth. The flavor starts dry with a distinct burnt currant fruitiness that mellows into more caramel, chocolate, and left-on-the-burner-too-long coffee notes before finishing with a splash of leafy hop flavor and a long lasting burnt malt character (similar to black malt - although probably from very dark British chocolate and roasted barley). Throughout the glass the combination of the lightly tart fruitiness followed by the acrid roastiness and long dull finish becomes quite endearing. Very unique. Probably a bit too much flavor to make it a good session brew, but definitely interesting and rich enough to make a pint last for alot longer than usual. I'd love to taste this cask-conditioned on handpump."
"I will thank pbrian for the sample nonethless.  I will always be willing to try anything that I've never tried before and pbrian helped my cause by sending me this beer."
"A great stout and considering my location I really need to remember to pick this fine beer up more often. If you can ever get it on a nitro tap it is head and shoulders above Guinness."
"A beauty in the glass. Deep dark midnight black. Great big fissy beige head. Fades fast but circles the glass nicely. Smells are balanced and not overwheming combinations of coffee, chocolate, and just enough bitter roasted finish. Taste is even and smooth, subltle coffess undertones, slighltly chocolate. Perfect crisp dry hop finish. No chalk like, slimy aftertaste. Very balanced and flavorful. One of my new all-time favorites. I carried a couple home from my summer trip, would love to try it on tap."
"Pours black as night with a good brown head that subsides to a nice film with a great lace.  The brew has strong coffee aromas with solid roasted malt/chocolate characteristics.  Great bittersweet chocolate characteristics mix well with the coffe and roasted flavors in this brew and make it very smooth and enjoyable.  The bitterness of the coffee flavors and the roasted/burnt malt leaves a nice lingering finish behind.  Definitely a very drinkable brew.  I don't think they know hot to make bad beer in Maine.  Thanks to the Bierman for this sample."
"I enjoyed this stout. Pours with little head, but as with all stouts, looks great in the glass. I liked the malt to hop balance in this one. The hops were there, but were not overpowering. A little lighter than Bell's K'zoo Stout, but a nice offering overall."
"This is a great dry stout.  Black with tan head.  Chocolate/coffee aromas.  Nice burnt malt flavors nicely balanced with a dose of hop bitterness. Finishes dry and light bodied, perfect for enticing you into another.  Nice lacing down the glass.  I wish I grabbed more than two."
"Notes: One of the top stouts brewed in the US, very well balanced and is even more heavenly on nitro-tap. Certainly a stout lovers stout."
