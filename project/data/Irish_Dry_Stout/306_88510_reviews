"Overall (3.47) : If you like smoke and kilned beers, and you're watching your wallet, this is your ticket. It's definitely not the best stout I've tried but it isn't half bad. I'm not sure I would buy it again as there's lots of other stouts out there that do the job better than this. But for a macro brewery to put out something like this is fairly impressive. Good job, Coors."

"It's actually better and truer to traditional stout than a number of craft stouts I've tried recently."

"O: don't let the Coors affiliation steer you away from this fine Irish Stout."

"overall light years better than Killians Irish red, and in my opinion better than Guinness. not really a dry stout. its on the sweet side. but still good and a great price too. a good brew from miller-Coors. wow, never thought i would say that."

"A drinkable yet rather forgettable dry stout. It has dark grained flavors going for it but nothing that really makes it stand out. The body seems rather weak and could use more body. Definitely fits the style profile but doesn't really offer anything unique yet still very drinkable."
""
""
"I recently tried Killians Irish Red, Was not overly impressed, However I tried Killians Irish Stout the same afternoon, and I was seriously impressed. To me it had hints of a slightly smoky coffee taste, but that only added to the overal flavor. It was very distinct and flavorful, every sip from start to finish maintains a good body with no nasty aftertaste. It was good overall, I have no complaints."

"Pours dark brown with one-finger tan head that quickly diminishes to mild persistent lacing. Aroma is roasted malts, mostly coffee with a bit of chocolate. Taste is slightly sweet malt, some coffee bitterness. There's a hint of a metallic aftertaste, similar to what you can get with an oxidized stout/porter. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for a stout. Overall this is a decent stout but a little too sweet and too thin to be a great dry stout."

"Taste is actually quite nice, I am a little surprised and impressed. Rich, roasty and sweet...not really to style for an Irish Dry Stout, its a bit on the sweet side, but it is tasty. Im still pretty shocked this Killian (Coors) product is this good. I would take this over a Guinness for sure, maybe even a Murphey's or Beamish too."

"Pours a very dark opaque brown, almost black in color with a small beige head. Good lacing was seen with each sip. Perfect carbonation actually for this one. The aroma is of roasted malts with a hint of chocolate and coffee. The taste was the same and actually pretty easy to drink as I wasn't sure on this one. Just a slight bitterness for the finish but didn't linger and wasn't over done. Overall, a pretty decent brew."

" As far as taste goes it is similar to the nose and feel with similar traits to the most popular imports - it has a good malt body but is like the feel in that it does not differentiate itself from the pack it has good flavor but is not bold by any sense. The mild roast and mostly dry body are there but it seems to flatten as it warms with only light bitter flavor lasting. Overall I consider this pretty decent for the style it represents and it is drinkable with good flavor and aroma. I would buy this if in the mood for a dry stout but there are others I would prefer."
""
"Like many other posters below, I was very happily impressed and surprised with this MillerCoors product. My wife even said ""It's not as bad as some", which is high praise from her. Tastes of deeply roasted grains and coffee are very warming and welcoming on this chilly October weekend."

"O: Better than I was expecting, not sure when this got introduced but since it was the first time I encountered it I thought I would pick it up... Not overly complex but easier enough to drink and enjoy. If I'm at another BMC bar around St.Paddy's Day, I know have something that I can drink besides just Guinness (and Killian's Irish Red)."
""

"Overall: great beer! Woohoo!"

"The taste is not quite as forward as the aroma might suggest but I still get plenty of dark malts and coffee as well as a mild hop bitterness on the backside. Don't let the Coors/Miller name influence you. Check this beer out on it face value."
""
""
""
"This definitely exceeded my expectations. I wasn't expecting anything with a good deal of flavor. This definitely has it's merits. I would like a little less caramel presence and tad more roasted malts and perhaps coffee or charcoal notes. The burnt sugar presence was actually enjoyable for me. Overall, this isn't a bad beer. There are definitely ""truer"" Irish Dry Stouts available, but for an inexpensive beer with a decent flavor this will do."
""
""
"O. Not great, not bad...much like a Killians Red, it does the job and not much else."
""
""
""

"Pours lack with a small lightly colored chocolate head. Lots of chocolate and coffee in the aroma, also has a slight fig smell, very impressed with the aroma. The taste falls off for me after a stellar look and smell. The chocolate and coffee are there it's just on the much lighter side. Which is to be expected, this being less than 5% ABV. I haven't enjoyed many Irish dry stouts but this seems to be a slightly above average version of them."
""
""
""
""
"Nice chocolate aroma. Opened and let rest for a minute. Again the aroma was good. Used a chilled glass. Dark very Dark. good pour left 1 inch head Carmel color. In comparison to other stouts ever so slight dry taste which makes it better. I do prefer a Red so this was not what I expected. I now have two beers of choice Killian Red and Stout."
""
"This is a great example of the style and, IMHO, a far better version of the style than Guinness. I will certainly get this beer again."
"George Killian's Irish Stout ---2.5/5"

"B- overall."

"You know, this isn't bad. Perfectly drinkable ."

"Pours to a ruby black color and off white permanent head and moderate lacing. Aroma is roasted barley/coffee, vanilla and toffee. Flavor is much of the same with a malty sweetness and a balancing bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium ad CO2 is just right. It is not exactly a dry stout but it is a good stout nonetheless."
""
"My pour resulted in just over a finger of foamy, deep-tan head with good retention that slllooowwly fell, leaving some nice lacing in its wake. Color was a deep, dark-brown, allowing zero light penetration. Nose had a smoky, chocolaty quality. Mouthfeel was medium, but the taste was tending towards sweet chocolate, which would be inappropriate for the style. I have a Sweet/Milk Stout on-deck and this was too close to that style for comfort. Finish remained sweet, very chocolaty, which was not bad in and of itself, but not what I want in an Irish DRY Stout."

"12oz bottle, pours black with ruby hues when held to a light, foamy tan head sticks around for a while. Aromas are similar to tastes: roasted barley, chocolate, creamed coffee, finishes slightly dry. Medium bodied and smooth. Overall, nothing wrong with this Irish stout, but nothing special about it either."
""
""
"If I'm looking for an Irish Stout, I'm gonna get Guinness. It's a shame too cuz I like George Killian's Red Ale fine. This one didn't do it for me, if you like overly strong and heavy beer that doesn't sit well in ur stomach, then go right ahead, but I'm gonna pass."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a thin, earthy, black malt scent that's bone dry and bitter and so good. The taste is decent as well. Again, it has a bone dry, black malt flavor. It's pretty one sided and lacks any real complexity, but it drinks fantastic. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a very accessible Irish stout that great for those who want something a little lighter than Guiness."
""
""
""
"In all honesty, I think this is a terrible rendition of an Irish stout. This beer is not even in the same league with the likes of regular canned or bottled Guinness. While it does have some of the coffee and chocolate notes one would expect from an Irish stout, the skunky finish kills all of what little one might be able to savor from the ""malts"". Additionally, it's over-carbonated which only further distracts from the malt."

"I would drink it again, but not gonna be in a hurry. Not when New Hollands Poet & Dragons Milk are availble and I have my own Stouts aging in my basement."

"Pours a dark brown with at least a finger of head that enjoyed some retention on the edges of the glass. The nose is pretty bland and the taste is similar. There is some roast and dryness on the finish, but this offering is nothing to write home about."
""

""
""
""

"O - Overall, I was actually impressed considering what I was expecting. It's almost like a light stout. Enjoyed it more than regular Killian's."
""
""
"O - Went in with low expectations, but was pleasantly surprised. Probably would good entry stout. Nothing is too overpowering."
""
""
""
"Overall - Solid stout. Simple, but a nice, consistent flavor. Decent body. Nice sessionable stout."
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some roasted malts., not a lot of aroma.Taste is smokey, roasted malts, very light coffee. Feels light in the mouth and overall this is a decent beer but nothing special."
"Overall much better than I was expecting from a Killian's product. Although I've all but written off the Irish Red, I believe I will actually grab some more of these."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a smooth drinkable stout at a good price."
""
""
"not bad considering the price,twenty dollars for the case!Quite surprizing considering I can't stand the 'irish red'so overall it's worth the trouble! not quite a Guiness but if your in the market for a budget stout for entertaining for the St. Patrick""s day holiday this is a good selection!you could spend a whole lot more on an Irish stout that people would'nt appreciate anyway,so if your going to buy for a crowd just to make a point you might as well go cheap!If not just go and buy the best for yourself!"
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark, almost black with ruby highlighting. Slight, light, frothy, off-white head that settles into a ring on the surface. Aromas of smoke and roast, with a coffee backbone and earthy overtones. Flavors are heavily roasted, with a touch of peat to it, overriding a bitter, dry coffee backbone. Good, oaky charring at the end of the palate and into the aftertaste. Bitter and roasty throughout. Light and dry in mouth, with a dry, clean finish."
""
""
""
"O - This is a nice Irish Stout. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality."
"Taste-Black coffee, roasted malt, dry black coffee finish. Not a bad attempt, but a bit thin in both body and flavor, probably for more mass appeal to the ""average"" Killian's drinker."

"I got this at Piggly wiggly, I drank the first one out of a glass and the others out of a bottle, just as food as Rhodes Scholor stout in my opionion at a fraction of the price. I'm guessing the alchohol is close to 6% judging by my current buzz after 4 of them in about 90 mins. I'll definitely get this again."
"Overall: George Killian's Irish Stout offers thoughtless, perfunctory quaffability."
""
"Overall, starts out awesome, then comes back down to the typical MillerCoors quality. Looks and smells great, minus the metallic scent. Without the watery feel and metallic flavor towards the end, this is a pretty good beer, but with it, it's just average."
"Overall: Lots of chalk taste but it's chocolatey. Not bad but it has a stigma as a Coors product, and that's a shame."
""
"Overall, a very nice surprise here. Not as dry as most of the Irish Dry Stouts I've tried but it's in the ballpark and when I come right down to it, it pleases my palate and is easy drinking. Well done."
"Overall better than I expected. A nice low cost alternative."
"a beer that taste good . looks good and one you want to keep around and a great last taste at the bottom of the glass maybe the best i ever had a dark beer in a glass that cant go wrong enjoy the beer enjoy the color enjoy the taste a smoothed very taste that slides down your thoart oh yeah a good one"
""
"This Killian's brand extension pours a dark brown, with a cream colored head. There is a mildly complex roasted coffee flavor profile. A nice stream of lacing is left on the pint glass. This is a highly drinkable beer with a smooth finish. Give it a try."
"Overall- This could be a really good beer with a little tweaking. The body is too thin and the flavors a little too subdued for what I think of a typical Irish Stout. It's not bad, and I wouldn't pour it down the sink, but I definitely have had better."
"For a massed produced ""roasted"" brew I would rather have a Stegmaier Porter. This is like a nice stout that was diluted to make it more appealing to a wider market that is used to drinking BMC...wait a minute.... Killians = Coors. A-Ha!"
""
""
"Overall avoid if you can I expected something since it's still a craft brewery but it's very basic stout even in Guinness standards. In fact get Guinness this stout is less than adequate."
"Sourced: Purchased at HEB in Texas on February 2, 2013 for $6.99 for a a six-pack of twelve-ounce bottles."
""
"After all this deliberation, it's honestly still an average Irish Stout. Quality of ingredients suffers a bit, but there's interesting complexity."
""
"Overall I thought this was decent beer and it was a slightly above average example of the style, it had most of what I look for in an Irish Dry Stout, but it ended up being just a little rough around the edges. This beer had pretty good drinkability, it was smooth, the flavor did an ok job at holding my attention and it isn't too filling, I could see drinking a few of these when in the mood especially on St. Patty's day. What I liked the most about this beer was the how balanced the taste was, it worked nicely with this beer and that aspect was pretty true to style, the appearance was also pretty nice. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was just a little on the light side and I could have gone without the higher and slightly prickly carbonation. I don't think I would keep this stocked in my fridge, but I could see buying a few of these at the bar when the selection isn't that great, I think I would enjoy this a little more then a Guinness and I would recommend this to someone as a good starter Stout. All in all I didn't think this beer was that bad at all, I didn't have the highest expectations for this beer, but it did end up impressing me a little. If this show's up at most bars that mainly serve BMC, I would be pretty happy with that, good job guys, nice to Killian's venturing out from the typical Irish Red Ale."

"Wait, there's a Killian's stout now? Okay. This stuff pours a dark black-brown topped by a finger of sandy khaki foam. The nose comprises mild roasted malts...and nothing else. Okay. The taste runs very similarly, just more watered-down. Sadly. The body is a very light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda watery feel. Overall, this is a pretty sad Irish stout, basically a watered-down Guinness (which I think speaks volumes). My disappointment knows no bounds."
""
""
""
"O. Meh. Decent but prob won't try it again. The dry finish doesnt leave a good taste and lacks an overall balance to it."
"Everything was great until the wheels fell off at the flavor profile. Not a bad option for a Coors product."
