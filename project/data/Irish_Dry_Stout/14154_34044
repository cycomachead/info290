2.75,-25.1,4.5,2,2,4,4,"I always have a lot of expectation for a beer that refuses the penetration of light. This black offering comes from a style I have no experience with: Irish Dry Stout. I've had many stouts but I don't recall a category for either Irish or Dry. I like Russian Imperial stouts and choclate or coffee stouts. I certainly can pick up the ""dry"" quality of this beer - but the Irish escapes me - perhaps because I am unfamiliar with the style. What was immediately both present, overriding and persistant was the smoke. I've had beers with a hint of smoke, but this was overpowering. Last time I recall that smell was when I was going through very old, musky, burned out, wet wood buildings looking for salvage. Burned out carbon. Because I am not a fan of smokey flavors (other than from those of beef & pork briskets) - and I have had many ""winter beers"" favoring this smoke characteristic -I have yet to have one that I would ask for by name. Again - just not a fan - for those who like this characteristic - kudos. The appearance was very promising, the mouthfeel right on but the flavor too smokey.","GoldHorde","0"

The nose brings a bit of coffee alongside a strong base of roasted malt. The flavor is a bit more complex, adding in some dark chocolate alongside the dark, dark coffee. Roasted malt is dominant and becomes a bit too dry and bitter in the finish. Pretty solid effort; I'd have this again.","Thorpe429","May 11, 2011"

All the aforementioned flavors are there, with the smokiness a bit more than I remember, very nice. It's not refined, but doesn't overpower making it sessionable. Still high drinkability deserved.

4.08,11.2,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"A deep brownish hue, near black with shades of rust. Frothy tan head that falls slowly to a ring. Smell is huge in the smoked meat department. Whoa now. Not really offensive but huge. Taste is great. The smoke is complimented well by other flavors. Some chocolate, light caramel and coffee, and an earthy hop presence. It's like a dry stout with a smoke addition that is on a larger scale than usual, similar to what you'd find in a Rauchbier. Very good. Mouthfeel is light to medium and silky smooth with a light smoke edge. Damn, I really liked this beer. At first I thought it was overwhelming but it definitely grew on me through the glass. Wish I had more but this is it. Thanks goes to maximum12 for the extra in a recent trade...yet another nice surprise.","ncvbc","Nov 02, 2008"

The first taste is earthy almost grainy. To be honest, I have no idea what peat moss taste like but I imagine it is similiar to what you get in here. You do get a smokey taste but it isn't at all over powering. If you are a fan of other smoked beers then you won't be disappointed. If however, you are like me and do not really go for smoked beers, you will find this is actually pretty pleasant. The flavors are all there but not anyone over powering.

4,9,4,4,4,4,4,"Into my pint glass, pours pretty much pitch black, a nice size tan head, ok lacing, pretty decent. The aroma is loaded with peat and smokiness, some coffee and maybe a little bittersweet chocolate. There is even more peat and smoke in the taste, roasty and toasty malts, very roasted coffee and a bit peppery spiced. The mouth is smooth, a little dry toward the end, good body and carbonation.

3.95,7.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a dark, chestnut-brown in color, with a medium tan head of good duration. Head consists of dense, almost tiny bubbles. Lacing is solid, and this is opaque when held up to the light.SMOKEY! The smoke fairly obscures the malts, but there are hints at the dark and chocolate malts that lie beneath, as well as a hint of sweetness. Very agreeable on the first sip, with a full-bodied impression. Smokey and a bit sweet, with all of the better qualities of the style coming to the fore, along with some bitter chocolate and light espresso notes. Closer to full-bodied than many of the stouts I've had in this style, and remarkably smooth. Although the smoke lingers, it doesn't totally obscure the finer malt and hop qualities present here; there's a roasted malt profile that hovers just undeneath the smoke, an assertive-yet forgiving hop bitterness, and a touch of oilyness that adds great depth to the malt profile. Top notch, folks. Now let's hope Furthermore sticks around a while.","Chaz","Aug 03, 2007"

I liked the Knot Stock a lot better.","aforbes10","May 27, 2007"

4.22,15,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Rich, deeply roasted, and noticeably smoky, Three Feet Deep delivers a full sensory experience. Starting with visual of the creamy dark-tan head atop its ebony-colored body, it follows that up with a solid roastiness in the nose that's reminiscent of an early morning campfire: it's roasty, ashen, lightly smokey, and slightly pine-like or leafy in the background. The body is medium, and it's slick and gently oily across the palate with a delicate, restrained carbonation. The flavor brings some added dark caramel to the mix, buoying the roastiness and soft smokiness. A thin thread of bittersweet chocolate runs through it, and there's a suggestion of leafy, grassy, and piney hops in the backgropund. The bitterness is quite firm, but not pressing, and not much is needed to help the roasty, smoky, and gently peppery character in the dry, softly lingering finish. Very nicely done!","NeroFiddled","Apr 07, 2007"
