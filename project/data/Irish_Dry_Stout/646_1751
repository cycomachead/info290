It could be compared to the peaty smokiness of a Lagavulin Scotch. Not the creamy and subtle stout I was expecting. Besides the taste, everything else was A1. Definitely will try in the future to see if the extreme smoke flavours are a commonality.","PorterPro125","Mar 14, 2015"

O'Hara's Irish Stout is a fantastic example of a quintessential Irish session stout, and one of the finest examples of this style that I have ever had the pleasure of trying. They did not skimp on the roasted malts, as this light stout provides far more roasty chocolate and espresso goodness than 'the leading Irish brand' could ever hope to muster. This is a skilfully-brewed beer, and a serious crowd-pleaser - you don't need to be a beer geek to appreciate this one. Session stout fans should consider O'Hara's a must-try.","thehyperduck","Nov 10, 2014"

4.1,6.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"330 ml bottle into pint glass, best before 1/31/2015. Pours nearly pitch black color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light char, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roast/bready malt and moderate hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, roasted malt, light char, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Moderate amount of herbal/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, roast, light char, herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and robustness of roast/bready malt and moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with fairly creamy, smooth, crisp, and lightly bready/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 4.3%. Overall this is an excellent dry stout. All around great balance, complexity, and robustness of roast/bready malt and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 24, 2014"

3.91,1.3,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Very dark brown with some chestnut highlights at the bottom of the glass. A massive, thick, pillowy tan head rests on top and leaves big splotches of lacing on the glass. Typical mild dry stout aromas of cocoa, coffee bean, cream, molasses, and a tart twang to finish it off. Smooth roasted malt flavor quickly turns to a fair amount of black barley sharpness. Smoke, espresso, and bittersweet chocolate. Medium-light bodied, bitter, and dry in the finish. Pretty much spot-on for the style. A super-drinkable, dark, malty beverage that is a great showcase for roasted barley.","wedge","Oct 31, 2013"

One of the best looking pours I've seen in a long time. The aroma is a roast and caramel thing, with just a touch of leafy hops. The taste offers a nice roast flavor, with some hints of chocolate, caramel, and the leafy hops from the nose. A pretty decent tasting dry stout. The mouthfeel is on the light side and well carbonated, and the drinkability is good. Overall, O'Hara's is a good Irish Dry Stout that I'd take over Guinness any day.","shand","Apr 30, 2013"

This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat and creamy mouthfeel.

The aroma offers classic charcoal malt, rlatively mild and unspectacular. The flavor comes on with smooth charcoal and mild vanilla malt with a touch of tropical fruit. Very nice and such an unusually creamy feel in a medium-plus bodied brew. There is a mild milk chocolate idea here, highly drinkable stuff. The most notable aspect is the slightly aqueous, creamy texture but plenty tasty as Irish stouts go. An easy choice though nothing too out of the ballpark.","Durge","Apr 12, 2012"

4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"The first time I ever had this beer, I fell in love. I was new to beer and it was one of my original starter beers that got me into beer with flavor. A few years later I bought another 4 pack and it just wasnt as enjoyable. The apperance was nice and black, like a true Irish Stout. The smell has roastedness and very enjoyable. The taste on the other hand bothered me. At first it was delicious and then it turned into a cigar taste. The taste would be a 5 out of 5 if it didnt have that horrible cigarette/ cigar taste. The mouth feel was nice and easy. Overall this is a good beer, but one little thing ruined it for me. Still have to appreciate all the good points of the beer though.","gtermi","Sep 17, 2011"

The smell is subtle, slightly roasted malts. The taste of the beer is toasty too. The mouthfeel is a bit thicker than a Guinness. Overall this beer a pretty good in my opinion.

I got two finger's worth of a thick, mocha-colored head that looked like the top of a root beer float. Nice. Color was a deep, dark, impenetrable brown. I could tell only at the edges of the beer, otherwise I would have said inky black. Nose was much sweeter than other beers of the style that I have reviewed today. Almost candy-like in terms of its sweetness. Warming, it had a light smokiness, but it still came off as sweet. Mouthfeel was full, almost creamy, with a pronounced smoky/charcoal bitterness accompanied by a caramel sweetness in the mouth. Very different from the rest of my day's stouts. Finish was dry, as advertised, with a sort of lingering tobacco taste. Not bad, but of the style, not the best, either.","woodychandler","Aug 07, 2010"

3.75,-2.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Big frothy head, close to filling half the glass if you're not careful, milkshake in look, has the dark brown as well as air-filled foam which creates a hilly landscape across the surface, the lacing shows stickiness and width. Fully opaque black liquid, you can stop typing at that. Nose has a curious sour, lactose edge to it, baking dough and cake mix, maybe barley, ground coffee, raw nuts, more roast than sweeter malts, more like a punch to your shoulder than a staccato burst of scents. Medium-bodied, dryness deadens the tongue sufficiently that you don't sense much movement or overall richness. Cocoa powder, blanched almonds, coffee, malt, all without noticeable sweetness. The carbonation just uneven enough to prevent a creamy, softer profile. Mineral water and vague herbaceousness draw you further away from any chocolate or vanilla flavors. Almost rugged, as if it's the beer correlate of a humble ""country wine."" Gives you some twist at the end.","farrago","Apr 07, 2010"

For starters there is definitely your typical roasted dark malts, some charcoal like ashiness present, but there is a nice underlying hop bitterness, and some toffee-ish malts that make this a fine complementary type of melange. The beer is creamy, and medium bodied, and not at all watery. This is a bit more beefed up than say a Guinness and it has more burnt and roasted notes present. There is a touch of chalky floral to the beer, that isn't detracting from the experience mind you. The aftertaste is a bit lingering, especially for a low 4.3 ABV beer. The mouthfeel is a bit oily, a bit bittering and mouth puckering, especially for a stout. This is an interesting stout, worth seeking out, for nothing less than its complexity.

The aroma, very inciting though I really had to put my nose into this one, chocolate, roasted malts, slight lactic sourness and coffee come to mind. The flavor is nice, roasted malt, bitterness adds to the chocolate feel and the finish is dry with a slight sour taste. The bitterness of this one is a little surprising but it does well. While this brew for me is light in its feel, but all of the Irish Stouts seem to be, it is a nice and a step ahead of the Beamish and Murphy's and seems to be way ahead of Guinness.

This simply is my favorite stout out there (thank you Publick House!) & I can imagine Diageo plotting to curb it's distribution in order to prevent it from harming their mega-sales. It seems that you used to be able to get a Beamish or Murphy's more regularly around town, and I loved that...especially when you had the choice (after all, place serve several brands of IPAs &c...why not stouts?). Nevertheless, this stout came with a beautiful, rich black-brown body & dense, firm tan head of 1& 1/2 fingers. Nice lace held throughout and retained the flavor & body well. The aroma is spot-on stout, all roasted malts & bready-nut goodness.

It's got a nice burnt aroma that is also present in the taste. I don't much care for the finish, but I also don't mind it too much. I can't really put my finger on what it tastes like, but it's not too bad. I think it may be some type of hops, but I can't be sure. It's really thin for a stout, making this a very drinkable beer. It doesn't have nitrogen in it, which is typical of beers of this style. That's fine though, because I've never really cared for the nitrogen. I mean, sure it looks cool, but it just tastes awful.

4.44,15,4,5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a nearly black body with fine-bubbled medium size head. Smell is unusual in that it is devoid of the dark chocolately element that I would expect, and instead smells of burnt driftwood, new tires, a fresh leather. Absolutely intriguing. Tastes has this bizarre charcoal briquette thing going on that makes me do a double take; tastes like a burned down walnut tree. Has an almost sour finish that is also very interesting. Definitely not a session beer; this is one to have every once in a while so that you can gaze in wonder at its uniqueness.","droomyster","Jan 29, 2009"

Stouts are not my favorite style, so this one may be out if you put it side-by-side with Guinness. It doesn't have the sour component, or any lingering acidity like most dry stouts.

The initial taste isn't all that great; there is an acridness about it from the roasted malt (somewhat expected based on the style), but it finishes very smooth and slightly dry.

It was a dark, deep ink color and the head was at least three fingers and a creamy wheat color. The lacing was great also and didn't disappear even as I was taking my last sip. The smell had hints of chocolate and maybe a little carmel which made it taste smooth. In each sip there was a powerful, but not overwhelming, hoppy taste which only positively added to the flavor. I was very satisfied with this beer and would highly recommend it.","KATE12","Mar 23, 2007"

Head fades slowly to a lingering ring of foam that hangs around for the duration. Taste is deep roasted malt with a licorice like flavor and hints of dark unsweetened chocolate. Hops are noticeable and provide a nice bitter counterpoint. Medium mouthfeel feels right for this brew. A tasty offering and one that stout lovers should enjoy.","LarryV","Mar 16, 2007"

It is pretty bitter - almost too much so - both from the hops and the burnt malts, and the medium body lingers and lingers as a result.

The mouthfeel is a bit milky, but this aspect is a kind of overwhelmed by the deep and lasting chocolate bitterness that circles the mouth. I felt like this beer was a bit too intense.

At first sip I thought there were some unappealing off flavors - mostly the hops which are grassy and grating. However I grew accustomed to them and began to enjoy them. I think the lasting, persuasive finish has something to do with it. If you're looking for a replacement for Guinness, get some Beamish. If you want something different - a rawer, less creamy, more uncompromising beer - check this out.

Overall a very drinkable nice little stout here.","Bighuge","Apr 22, 2002"
4.22,9.3,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Not a bad stout. About the same overall quality as Guinness or maybe a tad bit better. After having the this beer and Molings Irish Red (or maybe it was the traditional Celtic. The bar called it Molings Celtic Red which is neither of the beers' name) I've come to appreciate this brewery. They make good beers.","aracauna","Mar 27, 2002"
4.21,9.1,5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Deep and dark O' Haras pours a healthy beige head and leaves a trail of lace all round the pint glass. Mildly toasted nose. Dry roasty finish typical of the style. As much pleasure as I get from watching the pint empty I can't help but wonder why I didn't buy more of this easy drinking stout.","inebrius","Mar 14, 2002"
4.46,15.5,5,4,5,4,4,"I guess this brewery has only been around for about 5 years in Ireland but based on my first two beers of this, their Stout certainly blows away Guiness..This is definitely a dry stout (I prefer milk or sweet stouts) and is an outstanding one at that.  Perfect black color and slick creamy head...mild aroma with hints of dark cocoa and roasted coffee beans....this is a flavorful dry stout with a dry toasty finish..It is considerably more flavorfull than Guiness.  I wouldn't call it full-bodied...in fact its quite easy drinking...If you think you like Guiness, I highly suggest finding some of this.  This is an excellent stout...I'd love to taste it side-by-side with some of Bell's best..I spent over $10 for a six-pack and it is well worth it.","ZAP","Dec 26, 2001"
