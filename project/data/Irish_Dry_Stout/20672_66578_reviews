"O - A pleasure to tip back to celebrate St. Patrick's.  A fine Irish stout, with full flavor and feel."

"Yep, this is a fine Dry Stout. I'd say that if the carbo was bumped up a little, I'd like it even more."

"16 ounce can. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. Aroma is nice but very light, it smells like roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate and coffee. The brew tastes like roasted malt, coffee, burnt/charred malt, and some dark chocolate and earthiness. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and has medium/high carbonation. I thought this was a good tasting brew, although the weak aroma didn't exactly impress me. It's worth trying. $3.99 for a single can."

"O: Disappointed. Had many friends tell me I had to bring this back from my trip back home to Indy. Not commensurate with what I have come to enjoy about Sun King. Tasty brew to some, but for me this ends with an ""ehhhh... if you aren't going to drink it..."" sort of feel. I think the beer is missing something... just cannot put my finger on it. I think whatever this recipe is should be experimented with. Some interesting ingredients like white peppercorns (or if this was the base for a chili pepper beer) would be really exciting."

"O: Not the best offering from Sun King, and definitely over-priced, but it's worth a try if one has never had it. It looks amazing, and tastes very smooth, but it's far from rocking my world."

"O-Not a traditional Irish Dry Stout, had a brown and scotch ale twist to it."

"I'm drinking it without any food, but I'm sure it would hold up quite well with any kind of burger, most sandwiches and probably lots of other munchies."
"(On tap at Tomlinson Tap Room) Actually called an Irish Brown Stout, this was a great beer. Excellent dark brown coloring with fantastic head and very nice lacing. Nice deep malty scent with excellent roasted grains, but not an overkill of coffee or chocolate. Excellent flavor, with a great hit of dark roasted grains, a slight hint of chocolate, and a nice neutral hop finish. Goes down very, very smoothly, with a nice dry finish. Excellent brew!"
