"Black with a pillowy khaki head that settles to a 1-inch cap. Aromas of chocolate and coffee with a touch of caramel and roasted nuts. Taste is similar to the nose, nice and ""roasty", very drinkable, with a mild, balanced bitterness. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with a medium-full body and good carbonation. Overall a solidly drinkable Stout. No complaints."

"The most remarkable aspect that stuck in my mind about this brew is the way it manages to have pine resin, dark fruits, and charred malt in a combination in which the pine resin is content to stay in the background rather than overtaking the other elements, yet still be identifiable. This careful juggling act was set within a really top-rate presentation / appearance / texture context, which helps the beer to produce an impression of something really special, greater than merely the sum of it's individual parts."

"M: Medium bodied. Thin. Porter like."
"Pretty rich and robust for a Dry Stout. Nice one. Dunno if it is worth $10/bomber for something in this style, but good none-the-less."
""
""
"O: Definitely the fruitier side of irish dry stouts, could stand a hint more roasted malt character. Might be the age of the bottle though. Quite good regardless; one of the best of the style."
"D/O Drinkability is great with the welcomed smoothness, interesting tastes. Overall this is a world class Stout. 5.0"

"Quite enjoyable and not what I was expecting. Easy sipper here. A must try."
"o - overall, rather interesting...but i like it...A LOT! the hopped outness of this beer is awesome. i really dig an irish dry stout (who doesn't), and this isn't really classic by any means, but leave it to FFF to throw a curve ball and hit it out of the park in the same breath. loved it."

"Only my second from Three Floyds, but it was great. Highly recommended to pick this one up."

"Serving type: bottle"
""
""
""
"O - better than any ""big box' beer but a pass other wise."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a snifter this stout is jet black with a thick clingy tan head, very nice looking beer. The aroma is moderately roasty, bittersweet chocolate, and piney hops, solid. The flavor is a burst of piney hop flavor, followed by smooth bittersweet, roasty malts with moderate hop bitterness. The beer finishes slightly dry with a long lingering pine hop flavor. A delicious balance of hops and dark malts. The mouthfeel is medium-full and rather silky with medium carbonation. Overall a delicious beer, pick one up!"
""
""
""
"O: A very good beer. Great bittersweet/dark chocolate flavor. Mouthfeel needs some work."
""
""
"Overall Impression- While this is without a doubt my favorite brewery of all time, I never was very enthused about this beer... Very thin bodied and lacked some of the big time, up in your face character I'm used to from these guys. Wouldn't dis this beer but won't be going back to very soon."
"This was another brew send to me from Billakowski, thanks again man! This brew poured out as a deep looking black color with a brown colored head on top. The smell of the beer is hopped and has some coffee and roasted malt aromas on the nose. The taste of the beer is bitter with the chocolate, coffee and hops all working together to make a fairly nice complex brew. The mouthfeel of the beer was smooth with a lighter body than I expected it to have. Overall it's a another good brew from a great brewery."
""
""
""
""
"Aroma of dark chocolate and roasted malt. Also in the background is a hint of dark fruit. The color is a rich deep black with a short lasting tan head and good lacing. The flavor is at first of dark chocolate, followed by a coffee like roastedness and a dark fruit finish on the palate."
"One of the few Irish Dry stouts I have had. A decent beer, not something I feel I will want to have again."
"Overall (4.5): A great stout which is an interesting take on the style - perhaps because it's bigger than most versions. A bit sweet for the style and a bit more carbonated than I'd expect. Worth trying at least once."
"Black pour with nearly zero head. Forms a wisp of a khaki ring of tight weak bubbles. Aroma is a sucker punch of hops, dark chocolate and smoky malts, and blackberries. The beer is surprisingly smooth and well-balanced. Reasonably thick stout with ideal carbonation."
""
""
"O- This really is a treat. I've been wanting to get my hands on this for quite a while and it did not disappoint."
"O: a good stout overall. Manages to be fairly light and drinkable for a stout."
"22 ounce bottle into pint glass; no bottle dating but it is from this year. Pours a clear very dark brown color with a nice 2-3 finger fairly dense tan head with great retention that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big roasted malt, toast, chocolate, biscuit, coffee, pine, and herbal hops. Nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of chocolate, toast, roasted malt, caramel, coffee, herbal hops, pine, biscuit, and a touch of molasses. Good amount of herbal/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, coffee, caramel, herbal hops, and pine on the finish for a while. Good hop to roasted malt flavor balance. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is a very nice and interesting dry stout style. Definitely a bit off the wall with the hoppy flavors; but it is nicely balanced and still has a good roasted character. Enjoyed this one."
"The body is thick, robust and, as it should be, dry. In fact, this beer maintains an exceptional dryness without losing any smoothness or the very light crsipness that just keeps it active. While thick, the body is somehow still medium rather than being bigger or heavier than it should. Well done."
""
""
""
""
"O - Above average stout but maybe not worth it for the price."
""
""
""
"O- Overall, I think this is a great beer. I don't normally gravitate towards stouts. I enjoy them now and then but, in this case I imagine that Ill be enjoying this beer again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I enjoyed this stout. It's a very good stout that's by no means your everyday pasteurized and on every shelf dry stout. It's the best example of the Irish style dry stout I've had with it's complexity of flavors. For some reason I feel this was the way intended for this style of stout. Just remember it's not an American stout or an oatmeal stout or even one blasted with bourbon or sweet chocolate. Excellent stuff for me. Then again 'it's not normal'"
"Still <3 FFF, but won't be trading for this one again."
""
""
"O: Very happy to have tried this beer. A little excessive but - from my experience with Three Floyds so far - I wouldn't expect anything less. Its always a great experience with these guys."
"O-well i wouldn't call this a good stout. i really don't even know how this beer is considered a stout. as a beer, its just alright, nothing special, its probably better than most black IPAs that i've had though i'm not a big fan of black IPAs. probably the worst FFF beer i've had. definitely wouldn't bother buying this again."
""
"O- Not my favorite 3Floyds brew. I think I like the aroma more than the taste here. The smell suggests a very hop forward stout, and relatively speaking it is, however I kinda wish there were more bittering hops, as most of what I get is in the aroma. I guess it's not normal, but I think they could improve this beer by taking a page from Left Hand's recent book and add nitrous to this thing. I think the addition of some some fluffy nitrogen could really turn this beer around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very disappointing. The hops completely overpowered the other flavors when tasting it while they were pulled back a bit with the aromas. Not one of the better beers on the day"
""
""
"Overall: The beer was good but again not great nothing overall about the beer was overly impressive and for all the trouble it is to get this to California it is not worth it"
""
"Taste is similar to alpha klaus with a more pronounced chocolate taste and a roasted finish that is perfectly balanced. Really a nice beer."
""
""
"O: I like this style, especially when it’s done by a great brewer. Three Floyds is one of these select few that can really do stouts and, though this one has its faults, it comes out overall as a drinkable Irish Dry. Here’s to Irish brews – can’t wait for Brian Boru next month!"
""
"O: not my typical type of beer or stout but not bad. Pretty easy to drink. Certainly helped get through a webcast on investment strategies on a Sunday afternoon!"
""
"O - this may just have become my new favorite stout. i made a bad decision by splitting the bottle with a few friends and now i want more!"
""
""
"A fine example of the style, but unexciting."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drink- Eric, thanks for another offering to my collection of Three Floyds. Pretty good beer with some nice layering of flavors. I think not in a big tasting I would've enjoyed this more."
"O: Surprised by this one...not a typical Dry Irish Stout but it works. Enjoyable and drinkable."
"Cost: $9.99 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle."
"O- good Irish stout. Would love to make some black and tans with this and zombie dust."
"Overall - Hmm, Great thing about 22oz's i can really get a feel for the beer with quite a few drinks. This is a unique beer, hoppy, dry and smooth. Not what i was expecting nor is it my favorite FFF beer. Still good, and i really like the hoppy presence. I just wish it had a little more roasted malt and coffee up front. Still worthy and id drink again."
"Pours a semi-clear dark brown-black with a tan head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Small dots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, slight cocoa, and some slight fruity aromas. Taste is of the same. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good stout but the mouthfeel slightly kills the overall enjoyment in my opinion."
"Overall: Three Floyds has a nice dry stout here, but nothing spectacular. It isn't particularly difficult to quaff, with a mild mouthfeel and relatively low ABV, but it also isn't something I'd go crazy to try and get. Good for a lazy Sunday evening. 3.5"
""
"O- Like this bottle says, It's not normal. Its far from normal but in a good way. I really enjoyed this beer and will definitely be buying it again on next years release."
""
"This is not my favorite style of beer and I'm not a good judge of it. However, it's nice to see a brewer like 3F put their own personal stamp on a style and try to do something recognizable, yet still be distinct."
"The beer is medium-bodied with a gentle, moderate carbonation that allows a slight foaming up on the palate. The result is a very smooth, light, cloudlike mouthfeel. Really excellent for a stout."
""
""
"a fantastic render of the style. Looks as it should. Black with a nice mocha head and some lace. Nose is coffee roast and american hops. A bit me citrus a bit me pine. Otherwise mineral note and bitter make this a beautifully dry beer. Coffee and jasmine note. Perfume and ash brightness on the tongue. Very simple but very well placed. A tad malty but dry like peanut butter."
""
"I've had a fresh bottle in the past that showed a lot more hop presence. It's still a great beer, but obviously lacking in complexity. Also a bit sweet for the style, but I'm not complaining."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I've read some other reviews, and others don't seem to comment on the hops as much. I must have gotten a fresh bottle because this beer was loaded with citrus and pine flavors. It reminded me more of a black IPA than a stout."
"O - Nice base to DL, mild and a touch sweeter."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a pint glass- poured a black color with a two finger latte foam colored head. The head receded to a layer of foam covering the surface after a few minutes and had abundant lacing. The nose is subtle and mostly mocha. This stout tastes very much like dark chocolate with some hints of coffee. The head is luxuriously creamy and lighter tasting than the liquid form. The mouthfeel is totally unique to me- it is very light on the tongue with a tickle of carbonation towards the end; almost like a root beer float. This is yet another fantastic brew from Three Floyds."

"Thanks to Adam from Indiana for sharing."

"Overall a very nice and drinkable stout.  Awesome, really."
"A good beer overall. What you would expect from FFF. A solid irish stout with a unique hoppiness that isn't really found in others of the style. I think I would have this again, but there are other beers from FFF I would much rather grab over this one."
"O: A tasty hoppy stout."
""
""
""
""
"It may be classified as an Irish Dry Stout, and while dry it is much more flavorful than a Guinness, and I am a big Guinness fan. Thanks to Joey G for shipping out another winner from 3F which I highly recommend trying!"
"O: Pretty good with an intense aroma and flavor, but it is almost unbalanced and I probably won't get it again for a while."
"O. An untraditional dry stout. Not bad, but would have been a better Black IPA. The anise finish is off-putting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good, although it's definitely a hoppy stout. If you like hoppy stouts (Nightstalker, Storm King) you will love this one. Recommended."
""
""
"My first Three Floyds product. The brew store was holding their stash behind the counter and restricting sales to one per customer ... so I was expecting something very special. Instead I was a little disappointed. The pine/evergreen smell/taste is much too strong and drowns out any other scents/flavors hiding underneath. I commend the brewery for creating a unique product, but they've taken the ""It's not Normal"" philosophy a bit too far."
"Overall, not sure if this is really a stout because of the hoppy overload but it's tasty regardless."
"Fuller body, with a good amount of carbonation. Alcohol is not a factor here. The huge hop character kind of takes away from the beer for me. Still, a nice beer."
"Side note: bottle aging this beer will bring down the hop intensity if your not into hoppy beer"

"Creamy medium body, decent carbonation, slick and smooth on the tongue. A really nice dry stout that delivers way more flavor than many others do."
"Overall: Especially compared to some of the more popular beers in the style (Guinness), this drinks bigger, has a bolder flavor, and is just better overall."
"This is another very nice offering from the guys at Three Floyds. Just complex enough to keep you interested without being over-powering. Very easy to drink."
"My second beer from Three Floyds. Each one is not as amazing as you would expect from reviews. I think this is in part due to the fact I have traded for these beers, perhaps each one suffers from the journey? This had great choc malt flavor, and a good hop presence in the back. Lacking in a really good mouth feel; I like my stouts thick."
"I was convinced that this was an American Stout until I really started to ponder the mouthfeel. It definitely fits the bill of an Irish Dry, and it is very good considering the style. I'd be happy to drink this again."
"O - Good beer and very interesting taste with all the hops."
"D = high overall, good for the style"
"Mouthfeel is dry, medium bodied, well carbonated."
"O - Not very impressed with this ""stout"". It was almost like a borderline black IPA. Weak flavour characteristics turned this beer into a confusing drinking experience..."
"Overall: Another great one from Three Floyds. A bit pricey, but this one provides quite a lot of bang for one's buck. It has a bit more malty sweetness than other dry stouts I've tried, but this is definitely a positive for me."
"Pours black with two fingers of tan head. Head fades pretty quickly, but leaves some nice lacing behind. Smell is an interesting combination of roasted malt, chocolate and a nice amount of pine hops. Taste has more chocolate than the nose, along with some nice pine hops, earthy roasted malts and a touch of molasses. Nice full taste but the mouthfeel is not at all heavy. Medium mouthfeel with a lot of carbonation. I wish this was part of their year-round lineup. A very enjoyable stout."
"Medium thickness that drinks smoothly. Low abv and no notice of the alcohol. Well done."
"O: This is only my fourth beer of the style but it is by far the best one I’ve had. This is packed with flavor and character and was a real pleasure to drink."
"Pours a black color. 2/3 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, alcohol, slight oatmeal, and slight hop. Fits the style of an Irish Dry Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong alcohol, sweet malt, roasted malt, and slight dry hop. Overall, great appearance, a decent body and aroma."
" Overall I really enjoyed this brew,FFF did a great job I havnt been let down by them yet.I reccommend this to anyone."
"Pours a pitch black with an inch of tan foam that quickly fades leaving a few tiny bubbles. I'm picking up chocolate, molasses and smoke in the nose. Nothing too overpowering. Roasted malts, chocolate and coffee, slightly burnt aspect to it. Very nice drinkable flavor overall. Its light and crisp mouthfeel but seems to have an almost chocolate feel to it. Hard to explain. I really like this one and could drink a few for sure."
"O- great stout, at 899 a bomber i will consider getting this again. would love to try BA Black sun"
"This is a dry Irish stout? Wow. I wish they all tasted like this. I wouldn't say this is brewed to style, but this beer is absolutely wonderful. I love all the smoke it has. One of my favorite stouts, no matter what style."
"O: A really great stout, very tasty and drinkable."
"D - Pretty easy drinker. Smooth and malty with a slight sweetness to it. I recommend this brew and will get it again"
"Drinkability - I was very surprised with how the extensive hop bitterness and aroma mixed with the coffee malt. Super easy to drink. When they say, ""It's not normal."" They are undoubtedly correct. This beer almost makes me giggle because it's so different, but guess what? I like it. This beer may be a bit weird for some, but not for me."
"Creamy with a dry finish. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. This beer has a lot of flavor for 5.25 % abv. It has a lot of flavor period. When and if I see this again, I will definitely pick up another bottle."
"D: No burn. No off flavors or aftertaste. Could do a couple of these a night."
"Bomber. Pours black with brown translucent edges when put up to a light. The tan head quickly diminishes but creates some decent lacing. The aroma is very, very interesting. Lots of hops, chocolate, and some burnt notes. The initial flavors are rather interesting as well, because some weren't noticeable in the aroma. All kinds of citrus and fruit is apparent. Some roasted notes start to creep through when it warms, along with a slight bitterness and burnt notes. Towards the finish, chocolate becomes more apparent. The roasted notes bursts, complementing the chocolate quite well. Citrus becomes overwhelmed by the other flavors, but is still noticeable towards the end. I wasn't prepared for this, but was pleasantly surprised."
"A Dry Stout wasn't the first thing that popped into my mind as I was imbibing this but it doesn't matter. This is a well done American Stout with a robustness and fuller feel that belies its lower ABV. This was a dark and tasty treat."
"Overall, an absurdly solid stout. Very hoppy, very stouty. Solid brew."
"A great stout and what a day to drink this one."
"Notes: Not bad. A fairly solid example of the style, but not particularly exciting. No frills, just a good drink."
"D: Not like any Irish stout I've had before. Quite hoppy, which was nice, but the watery nature of the flavor and mouthfeel was a let down."
"D- I'm gagging with each sip. Drain pour. Hugely disappointing"
"Thanks to hurfer for the bottle! Poured from 650ml bottle (no date) into tulip glass. Pours nearly black presenting a creamy tan head that has mild retention and leaves thin lacing throughout the session. Aroma is mild but am picking roast malts upfront, burnt sugar, bittersweet chocolate, mild coffee, light woody notes, and some husky grain. Flavor is sweet roast, burnt sugar, carmelized tree resins/fruit, coffee and slightly burnt, sweet granola. Palate is light to medium bodied, chewy on entry leading to a creamy middle and fairly clean dry finish with a pleasantly light carbonation. I thought this was quite an average beer throughout though I'd love to try this fresh!"
"D: drank really good and was a pretty well balanced porter glad I finally cracked this brew open."
"Drinkability is great. There's a great dry stout in therre, and I love the hoppy twist!"
"d - An interesting, very dry stout. It has some nice pine and citrus hops, as well as chocolate and roasted malts mixing together in the smell and taste. Would have again."
"D - Drinkability is great IMO with a nice lower ABV but tons of flavor. I could have two more of these bombers easily."
"Tasty enough, but pretty middle of the road for a FFF brew. I don't know why but I expect bigger and better from them."
"Overall, an excellent beer and the best Irish Dry Stout that I've had so far. Another winner from 3F's. Goes down real easy on a cold winter day. Highly recommend. Not avail here in TX so shipped from Indy during Xmas. Rotation - this is a December release so will have to get several each season after we move to Indy this year [R;Y]"
"Appears blacker than a dark steers tukeus on a moonlesss prarie night. Little froth....black. Smells like coffe molasses and roasted malts. Tastes lighter than it looks, licorice, coffee, smokey alcohol. Mothfeel is milder than i would expect. Finoshes very crisp and dry. Piney, grassy bitter. Very tastey, especially with a friend!"
"Poured a nice solid black as it pured it was evident that it had a thin body. The thin body is totally fine as this is a 5% stout. THe head formed with only the slightest of help but left a nice lace on the glass. The head was a light chocolate brown color. The aroma was very amazing and I only rated it a 3.5 as I felt it was very off style. The smell was a extreme piney aroma coming from this stout. The roasty dry aroma from the malt was in the background and helped push the piney aroma threw very easy. I enjoyed the smelll but felt it was off charector. The flavor was pretty hop forward but amazingly blended with the roasty dry malt flavor very well. This is a brew I would be happy to place in my fridge any time and serve to guests."
"D: Even though its slightly above 5% ABV, I'd call this one heck of a session beer. A bomber was quaffed in no time and I was eager for more. Flavor profile is simple but delicious and feel makes this one dangerously drinkable. Worth picking up."
"The feel is great, as most FFF beers are. Very smooth and medium feel, mellow and nice. The beer is very drinkable and tasty at 5.25%, great stuff."
"Pours near black with a big tan-mocha head. Quite creamy and sticks around for a good period of time before falling into a nice cap and leaving some spotty lacing. The nose is pretty underwhelming with some roasted notes and a bit of coffee. The taste amps things up a bit with some stronger roast and espresso notes plus a bit of dark chocolate. Body is medium without any noticeable alcohol and has a fairly-dry finish. Pretty drinkable and one of the better versions of this style that I've had, but nothing earth-shattering."
"(22oz bottle courtesy of Lil'o boy). Pours black with creamy tan head. Some lacing and small carbonation bubbles. Aroma of nuts, cocoa, pine/wood, and something earthy. Taste is sweet with a bitter, roasty finish. Thin/medium bodied with a creamy texture. Bitter finish. There's an off-taste (band-aid) in this that is distracting. Not my favorite."
"I almost had a Soundgarden song stuck in my head thanks to this beer. It pours a sleek black-brown topped by over a finger of light tan foam. The nose comprises chocolate, kinda light roasted malts, barley husks, and toffee. Honestly, it's as though I'm sniffing my malt bag on the way home from the homebrew store, en route to my own sweet stout. Delightful! The taste holds notes of light chocolate, roasted malts, toasted oats, and a light bit of anise in the back. The body is a svelte medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a damn fine Irish stout. Straight up. Get some!"
"This beer is Tit's McGee for an IDS. It pours pretty dark blackness with a light beige head that fades rather quickly on the surface. The smell is pretty damn wonderful. There is a hint of bourbon mixed within the heavy chocolate notes. It's like smelling a malted milk ball. The taste is a nice dry chocolate flavor there is almost a lemongrass flavor or some other earthy herbal note to the flavor on the back-end. This is pretty darn nice for the mouthfeel. It's one of the more pleasant tasting IDSs that I've ever had, If only that herbal note wasn't around."
"Verdict: Far from elite, this is unique and worth trying but won't work for everyone."
"Tasty to drink and smooth in the palate, Black Sun's bottle says it's not normal, and it's right. It's a little bit better than that."
"D (4.5): This brew is somewhere between a 4.5 and a 5, for me. Awesome full flavor, very smooth and very interesting. Every sip has something new to explore; love this beer."
"Dry, Dry, Dry and very roasty almost like bitter bakers chocolate, earthy hops, very light on the palate and easy to drink. Some toast, vanilla, almonds and other nutty flavors. Has a long lingering dry finish that I am really enjoying. Another great beer from the FFF guys again I wish you came to PA."
"Pours nice, decent tan head, and pretty dark, not quite fully black, but close. (and damn near opaque) A little coffee and a more significant amount of piney-ness (I know, it not a word...) on the nose. I really got the piney hops flavor right off the bat, with a nice malt middle and a dryish finish. It's good, and I'd buy it again, but I would defiantly have to be in the mood for it."
"D- Very drinkable stout. With the lower ABV, I could easily have another bomber of this. Was thinking more of a guiness beer when popping this, but much more flavor and better mouthfeel."
"Overall, a great brew from Three Floyds. I would highly recommend this to a Three Floyds fan. Actually, I would recommend this to a stout fan!"
"D: No burn. No off flavors or aftertaste. Could do a couple of these a night."
"Drinkability: Another great beer from Three Floyds! If you like hoppy stouts, this is a good one. Definitely recommend!"
"Drinkability: This bomber was gone before I even knew it. This beer was incredibly drinkable, but more than that was a pleasure to drink. Nice because it didn't try to do too much by cranking up the ABV, just let the beer style speak for itself. The only downside is that I have no idea why this beer cost so much? I would love to keep it in supply all the time, but the cost is prohibitive of that in my opinion."
"Comes to me in a pint, black as night with a finger of dark tan head. Smells are roasted malts, some hops and slight coffee. Tastes are hops at the front, roasty malts, a hint of smokiness and a dry finish. Mouthfeel is good, decent amount of carb, drinkability is pretty high. Good beer!"
"A seasonable session-able stout."
"Drinkability -- Quite good, though the hops did become distracting over time. Really the only other beer I've ever had like it has been Alpha Klaus. I think I liked that one more..."
"D: Very smooth and maybe 2 would be my limit in one sitting. Lovely seasonal treat; another fine offering from 3 Floyds."
"Not too high ABV so pretty drinkable. Only available one month a year so availability is a bit limited. Will definitely grab this on tap at FFF but not sure if I'll grab another bomber."

"D - I don't find this to be very drinkable. It is too harsh. The alcohol is apparent (and it is only 5.3%) and the hop is overloaded."
"D: I could drink this all day long. I wish FFF would replace one of their hoppy flagships and replace this one for it. Since three of their four year around brews are hop bombs (Gumballhead, Alpha King, and Pride and Joy), I think they should this part of their standard line-up to add some diversity."
"Drink ability: Very tasty stout. I would like to have it when it's fresh."
"Dark, coffee black with a thick dark brown head that leaves sheets of crusty lace on the glass. Deep roasted malt and fruity hops in the aroma. I'm amazed at how well this beer has held up over the last year, the hops are only slightly faded and full of fruity flavor that pairs well with the intense roastiness of the malt. Coffee bean, anise and cocoa with a charred bitterness. Full bodied and slighly chalky in the finish. A tasty brew. I look forward to enjoying this fresh in the near future."
"Poured into a Tripel Karmeliet tulip, solid black in color with fizzy carbonation that goes away almost instantly leaving a mirror finish on top of the beer. Aroma is a faint chocolate and a touch of dark fruit. Body is light and slightly refreshing from the carbonation. Bitter chocolate and burnt sugar/molasses are the predominant flavors. The hops are lingering in the background but very subdued, willamette (sp?) maybe?"
"Drinkability is high. I would have thought this would have been a black IPA had it not been labeled an Irish Dry Stout. Indeed I'm going to call it a black IPA if asked my opinion. I would love to try this fresh just to get the real impact of the fresh hops. I have to believe they have faded to where they are now and wonder just how good they would be fresh. Recommended."
"It finishes pretty dry, just a hint of a lingering syrupy flavor with a little caramel, but it's very dry and finishes off the palate quickly, for the most part. More lingering roast and coffee flavors, the bitterness also dials in on the finish, taking advantage of the dryness and the dulled down dark malt flavors. The hops bring more pine and earthy qualities, as well as that spicy flavor still."
"Mouthfeel is nice and dry. The hoppiness and dryness make this very drinkable. A great beer."
"D- Quite drinkable.... which isn't too surprising given the low ABV. The esters are a bit unexpected in this beer, and don't work extremely well with the rest of the flavors IMO. This has a slight impact on drinkability..."
"Will certainly be drinking this again - YUM!"
"MF/D: very smooth and nothing less than i expected from a 3F beer. very drinkable and an enjoyable afternoon beverage."
"This beer appears a near black, with an average sized head and adequate lacing. The aroma definitely smells like a foreign stout. The beer is decent tasting, with a slight alcoholic warming note in the finish. The carbonation level feels a bit low, which is in line with the style. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. A pretty decent beer, but nothing leaps out. A fairly normal beer from a brewery that makes beers that are ""not normal""."
"I'd definitely recommend the Black Sun, the one knock is the low alcohol content."
"M/D- medium bodied with low carbonation, perfect for the style. easy drinking and very pleasing. nothin spectacular but a great drinking stout none the less."
"Beer is thin and finishes clean with mild dryness. Beer overall is mostly sweet with some bitterness in the back from the roasted grain. Its a decent and drinkable little stout. I liked it."
"D- Very drinkable. In fact, mine disappeared way too soon!"
"Drinkability is good. This is a very tasty and easy drinking stout, just doesn't have much mouthfeel. With a few fixes, this would be outstanding."
"thanks be to the dirtmen"
"Mouthfeel, again, the fruit aspect has a neat interplay throughout, never heavy on the palate, this just hit the spot for a cold tailgate yesterday."
"D- This is a good drinkable stout. Interesting because it's not like most stouts I've had before. Although, this is FFF doing it so it does not surprise me. Good job on yet another knock out beer guys!"
"M/D - Medium body but very light on the palate. Low levels of carbonation create a smooth texture as well. Zero hint of alcohol warmth also. Nice non-aggressive flavors allow for easy drinkability and one can enjoy this beer for what it's worth."
"D - Not a bad beer. Would not be my go to for a session, either."
"D: This was very enjoyable. It pushes the bounds of a typical stout, but was really nice and I'll definitely search this out again."
"Tastes chocolate, burnt roasted malt, coffee and light grapefruit notes. Pretty good beer from this brewer, maybe someday i will be able to try their dark lord!"
"SkÅL!"
"Three Floyds Brewing, Black Sun Stout. This baby poured cloudy dark brown with a hint of red to it. It smelled like chocolate, roasted malts, and a tinge sweet. It tasted roasty and bitter but with some fruitiness. It was a bit dry and bitter with a slightly leathery finish. It isn't as sweet as it leads you to think it is when you smell it. That was a bit disappointing in my book, but it doesn't make it a bad beer. It was just a bit bitter for my taste. This was another beer that my husband traded for and we also have the 2008 & 2009 Dark Lord in our beer closet from Three Floyds as well that we are looking forward in trying."
"D - one of those random beers i pull out of the fridge without high expectations that just impresses me massively. i dont know know if it was because I was in the mood for something hoppy, but this is really hitting the spot right now. this is going down SO easily...only had a handful of FFF offerings but this is so distinctive of their personality. love it."
"Looks like an espresso in a snifter. When I first smelled this beer I said ""oh wow"" out loud to myself. Wonderful coffee aromas but there's a fruitiness that really sets this beer apart from other Irish Dry Stouts or any other stout for what it's worth. The aroma is only an appatizer for the flavor. How did they make such a wonderfully complex beer and make it so sessionable at the same time? Lot's of roasted flavors, coffee, caramel much like other stouts but only better. But what really makes this beer special is the hops. I don't understand how 3 Floyds seems to make the perfect hoppy beer everytime. They manage to pack lot's of hoppy flavor in their beers without making it a hop bomb. This beer is no exception to the 3 Floyds rule. The mouthfeel is wonderful and somehow is both creamy and dry. This is a fantastic beer and it's thin enough in body and 5% abv to make it the perfect session ale. Thanks to Brewcrew76 for this beer."
"drinkability - this has to be hands down the best irish dry out there - as good as this is and only 5+ abv - how could it be anything less then a 5!!!"
"Overall a fantastic beer. So full of flavor, great balance, and something I could drink all night. I just wish we had Three Floyds in Colorado!"
"M: Creamy, with a dry finish. A very well done beer, one that I would pick up on a semi-regular basis if it weren't for the monstrous price tag."
"A solid stout - a bit bigger than the average Irish Dry, but well put-together. Black pour with the barest tinge of ruby at the edge. Nice roasted malt aroma. Dark but not over-roasted malt flavor, a touch of coffee and well-moderated sweetness. Nicely balanced hops bittering, but the finish was not as dry as customary for the style. Well done."
"Overall, a good stout...not great, but good for they style. I'm usually happy with everything Three Floyds puts out, and this one proves to be along those lines. A good, drinkable stout."
"Overall a pretty good Irish stout, I definitely liked it better then some of the classic examples. It had a lot of nice roasty flavors that really worked well for it. My only criticism is I would have liked a little more head retention and lacing. Both pretty much disappeared a few minutes after the pour."
"Three Floyds is always fantastic, but this kind of seems like a less exciting version of the Alpha Klaus Xmas Porter. Even though there's different things going on in this beer, I find myself missing that crazy minty-hop flavor I got in the Xmas....still not at all a disappointment for the style."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable!"
"D- Quite a drinkable session stout. I liked it a lot."
"I almost think of this as Dark Lord ""light"". Some of the vanilla notes, and perhaps a shared yeast flavor, come through strongly vs. my DL review from a few weeks back. In some ways I like this better."
"Drinkability is great too. Would like to try this on tap."
"Drinks easy, sessionable enough, but quite frankly, I was somewhat underwhelmed with this one. Loves me some FFF, but this one just misses"
"A unique beer that I'm glad I tried. Would maybe get more if I found it for a quarter of the price I paid."
"Coating the palate with a blend of hops and heavily kilned malts, this is about as removed from the typical Irish Dry Stouts as Pride and Joy is from the average Mild. The intensity of the roast and hops work well to intensify the medium-light body, making it seem a little bigger than it is. The initially high carbonation subsides, resulting in a moderate level that is appropriate. I'm enjoying this, and would love to try it again, and on cask if possible. Unfortunately, though, I've got about 2 inches of sediment in my bottle that precludes me from enjoying my fair share."
"Very tasty. Nice medium mouthfeel. Worth the wait!"
"Drinkability is good as it goes down easy and doesn't fill you up."
"Pours a slick black color with a finger of fizzy tan colored head that stays atop the glass as the beer is drank. The aroma is roasted malt heavy with some hints of cherries and slight smoke character. The flavor is chocolate covered cherries with a bitter roast character that coats your mouth. Its medium-full bodied with a slick mouth feel although finishes dry. Very unique and well balanced beer. Really enjoyed the chocolate covered cherry flavor that I kept getting and was a perfect Christmas morning beer. I did get an amount of alcohol warmth which I found odd."
"Extremely easy to drink, awesome beer!"
"Excellent stout. This is a great, clean, dry stout with big flavors. It pours a very dark brown, completely opaque with a small beige head. Black Sun looks a bit like hot cocoa made with dark chocolate. The aroma is rich and chocolatey with a hint of brown sugar. The flavor is rather dry with some lingering sweetness and a bit of ash. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy. It's an excellent stout and easily the best dry stout that I've tried. Bottle was from lambtaco on Reddit."
"I liked this more than the rating will reflect--the appearance is dragging this down more than I'd like. Tasty!"
"Bottle courtesy Guy411. Pours an absurd milky brown with a thin cocoa-colored head. Aroma is reminiscent of chocolate milk with some roastiness and a lightly fruity note. Rich flavors of chocolate and iced coffee with lesser notes of cherries and fruity hops. Doesn't make any sense that it would be classified as a dry stout, but regardless of style this tastes really good. Medium-bodied with a tiny bit of chalkiness and a dry finish."
"Overall: Despite low abv and not too thick body, the gritty chewiness makes this kind of unpleasant. Definitely different."
"Pours a dark black color with a nice deep tan head. Leaves sparse lacing around the edges. The nose is roasted coffee and malts with some nice chocolate notes. The taste is a very robust roasted coffee and chocolate flavor with nice malt back bone. There is a slight bitter sweet chocolate blast then a nice roasty coffee-like finish. Very smooth to drink, not overly bitter. This is a really good Irish Dry Stout. Some very good flavors going on here."
"Porter like in look, and kinda has the profile of a lighter stout. Black with brown highlights and a foamy tan head. Three Floyds usually packs in the hops and they do so here in a wonderful way. Only they could make a stout this hoppy without totally ruining the beer. Nose also has a roasted hop bitterness to it, but once again it's damn hoppy. I don't know if you could do an irish stout any better than this. Dry and roasted taste around the edges with a smattering of hops that just makes your mouth water. The feel is very crisp and on the lighter side, but thats exactly what I like about it. It makes this beer dangerously drinkable. There's no reason not to have more of this beer, MUCH MORE."
"D: This beer tastes great and it's fun to pick apart the plethera of flavors, but I'm not sure how many of these I could drink in one night..."
"D - If I didn't have the 22 to myself right now, I'd try pawning it off on a friend. I'm not diggin' it so much. I'll nurse it though a movie and hopefully it'll grown on me."
"Drinkability: One note, why can't 3F seem to get a grip on quality control. Most of their beers are phenomenal, but most also have serious QC issues. Case in point, the unbelievable sludge layer in this one means I probably got 15 or so ounces out of the 22 oz bomber. I really think I would rather drink decent beer with consistent quality, then great beer with the hit or miss problems. 3F, you are great brewers, but you are also businessmen, whether you want to admit it or not. Get your shit together please."
"Thanks Allen."
"Overall a great representation of a dry stout. I'm working my way through FFF lineup and once again they don't dissapoint."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle shared with brothercannon. Poured into a pair of shaker glasses. Black sun appears a nearly opaque brown color with about an inch of dense, yet creamy ecru foam. Huge staying power with the head here and a great looking pour. Aromas and flavors consist of deep roasted grains, rich caramel malt, baking and semi-sweet chocolate, cocoa powder, nice amount of earthy, herbal hops in this one, some coffee. Falls between medium and full bodied with ample carbonation. Tasty stuff."
"No more for me, thanks. I do NOT like big hops notes in my stouts. If I had anymore, I'd give them away. It's a well-made beer, but it's not for me."
"This was a tasty, balanced and easily quaffable beer. Definitely a few step better then the more readily accessible examples of the style out there."
"Chewy creamy full body with a very roasty bitter mouthfeel. Pretty hoppy up front adding a nice bitterness to the deep roasted coffee bean and burnt toast notes. Sweet chocolate maltiness with subtle dark fruit notes, vanilla, oatmeal, lactic creaminess, toffee and hazelnut. The bitterness from the hops and rosted notes is very prominent throughout, lasting through to a very dry finish. This beer is very complex but is still pretty quaffable with not a lot of alcohol heat."
"D - Great tasting and quaffable, perhaps the best dry stout I ever had, so drinkable and flavorful at the same time, a great beer."
"Poured very dark, almost black with a respectable, creamy beige head. The head quickly reduced to a collar for the duration. Aroma was roasted malt and coffee, delicious. The taste was a little disappointing. The malty smell did not come through with any sweetness. The chocolate was there as dark and bitter. The bitterness, though not great, hung at the back of the throat. Thick, rich and oily. Even though the ABV is not that high, I wouldn't want a lot of Black Sun. Not bad, but this is a tough category to be OK in."
"Two notes: This bottle was filled up to the very top of the bomber. We're talking centimeters between the liquid and the cap. Not sure what that was about, but it didn't hinder the head formation. Also, the end of the beer drinks (and Sanatar said it best) like a milkshake. It's thick with tons of yeast that leaves a super chalky residual coat on the tongue. Despite all that, a fabulous stout and I look forward to having many, many more."
"This was my first FFF beer to try, ever. I'll be trying the Dreadknaught and Alpha Klaus soon."
"This is a truly awesome irish dry stout. Probably the best I've ever had."
"I much prefer Alpha Klaus to this , but it can hit the spot."
"Overall: An outstanding and incredibly balanced brew that is way too tasty. 2 in 2 for Three Floyds so far. The hype on them is definitely warranted."
"D - Fantastic Irish Dry Stout with the obligatory revved-up FFF hop presence. These guys are quickly becoming perhaps my favorite brewery outside of PA. Everything I try is top-notch."
"I really enjoyed this beer. Nothing over the top, just a simple beer that works."
"From a 22oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a pitch black color with a pretty big light tan head. The head seems to have great retention which leaves some nice lacing. The first smell of this one threw me off, it smelled hoppy at first and almost reminded me of some of FFF's pale ales and ipas. Not a bad thing, just not used to stouts smelling like that. Other than that their is coffee and some chocolate, and some nice roasted malt in the smell. Nice smell overall. The taste has an overpowering coffee thing going on especially in the aftertaste, not necessarily bad though. There is also some chocolate in the taste as well as roasted and smokey flavors. I've only had a few different Irish Dry Stouts and this one taste quite a bit different than the others. I don't think that is a bad thing though."
"I enjoy this beer and I am glad that I have another 8 oz or so in the bottle."
"Overall this is a fine example of a stout that manages to hit all the important notes of the style, while still being uniquely delicious. Well done."
"D - Easy drinker."
"Overall impression: Very nice (not Irish) stout."
"D: This is one amazing beer, I really enjoyed it. Could have finished the bomber in no-time. Would feel privileged if I got to try it again."
"D- Easy to drink, its light, yet robust and filling."
"D--Very easy drinking here, there is enough flavor to make you want more but it is mild enough to never become cumbersome."
"Another good beer from three floyds. Cant wait to try them all!"
"3F puts out good brews, but like Bells's, they're overpriced."
"D- A wonderful stout for a touch over 5% ABV. This is very flavorful without being too rich. Highly recommended."
"D: Not bad, not great but real good."
"Overall, I'm not a fan of Irish dry stouts, but this beer goes a long way toward fixing that."
"D- Overall, a really tasty brew that is super easy to drink. Have to say this would be a great brew that is really easy to session as it is full of flavor, not overpowering and a nice low ABV. Definitely one of the better beers for the style especially."
"Mouthfeel was kind of thin, which also through me off. I wished I'd had another just to experience that metamorphosis again."
"Wow, Murphy's move over I now have a new favorite Irish Dry Stout style beer. Ordered this from Archer Liquors in Chicago. Pours a nice black color into my Guiness glass with little head. Awesome cocoa poweder aroma and some light vanilla and caramel. It continues with the taste with more cocoa powder, vanilla and very light caramel. Very smooth and easy to drink. I wish I could get this on tap with a nitro. Just thinking of that makes me drool. Awesome beer, it just sucks to be in Texas since we can't get any beers from this great brewery. Although my goal is to make it to the brewery once this year. Will let y'all know."
"Head retention turned out to be average and the lacing was almost nonexistant but...this one excels in every other category. A great Irish Dry Stout!"
"Poured from 22oz bottle into pint glass. Pours pitch black with two fingers of heavy tan head. Nice lacing stuck all over the sides of the glass. Smell is roasty and hoppy. Taste is very roasty up front then finishes hoppy. Hints of coffee linger on the tongue after every drink. Medium bodied mouthfeel. Great drinkability. A very enjoyable stout from Three Floyds."
"D: Great stout, could definitely have more than one."
"Overall this certainly isn't a traditional Irish Dry Stout, but it's pretty tasty regardless. Worth a shot."
"Pours a very black body with a small tan head. Aroma is medium sweet with grapefruit, some chocolate, light peach. The flavor is bittersweet chocolate, roast, woody and light citrus. The finish is dry grapefruit and a bit minerally. Light to medium body. Interesting hop choice for the aroma although I must say it worked for me."
"Dark brown/black in color...small amount of head. Hoppy smell with hints of coffee and citrus. Lots of coffee/dark chocolate tastes. Medium body with a clean finish. Overall, a great stout the I like whenever I'm in the mood for this type of beer...haven't tried the 22oz bomber yet, but will shortly."
"Overall very well balanced and enjoyable. Definitely recommended, although it won't be what you expect."
"Makes a nice St. Patrick's day nightcap."
"The intense hop smell was a little surprising at first, but the taste was very good, striking a nice balance of components. A decent stout, though I'm not sure it really fits into the Irish Dry Stout category. Still, it's well worth trying, though I wish it were cheaper."
"Man the hops really take over the upfront flavor. Is this simcoe? It's an interesting, very smooth citrus bitterness. The hops fade into big, black malts with heavy roasted grains, cocoa powder, a drop of caramel and a bit of fruity sweetness in the middle. Reminds me of Cadillac Mtn Stout and Shakespeare Stout - that's a very good thing. Big and delicous with a heavy serving of hops."
"this is one awesome irish stout, one of the better that i have had. no alcohol presence and a low ABV make this VERY drinkable. i may snag some more of these."
"D - At 5.25%, this would be a great session beer."
"This would be an excellent choice to serve to a Guinness fan when trying to recruit a friend into the world of craft brew."
"At five something a bomber I'm ona stock up before winter comes to a close"
"A very drinkable and enjoyable stout from FFF."
"The taste is the same as the nose. It's a 3F's take on an Irish dry stout (more hoppy!). This beer is light bodied and medium flavored. Carbonation in the mouthfeel is average and it's smooth and extremely easy to drink. I could drink this all night - highly sessionable."
"This beer pours a deep jet black, definitely opaque. There is a thick creamy two finger tan head that recedes slowly leaving big thick sticky lacing. Nose is of sweet caramel and malts, some bitter chocolate and a touch of coffee. Taste is nicely balance - here is where I picked up some hops that I didn't find present in the nose. Sweet chocolate starts this beer off, some caramel and roasted malts, hint of floral hops and bitter chocolate finish the beer. Mouthfeel is a little on the lighter side for a stout but overall a decent beer."
"22 oz. Jet black pour with a dark tan head, disappated pretty quickly. Roast malt and coffee with that signature piney hops. Tastes real nice with coffee, peat, hint of dark chocolate. The 3F piney hops work really well with the dry stout style. Semi-lively for a stout. Solid medium/full body. Finish real clean and hop dry. I find the 3F hop profile interferes with some of the styles, but it works perfectly with the dry irish stout. This is unique and a must try for anyone who likes this style. Extreamly drinkable to boot."
"Well done, yet again, from Three Floyds. It's a tad pricey at $7 for a 22 oz. bomber, but deliciously steady."
"I hear this is tons better at the FFF brewpub where they push it through a nitro tap."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. It smells and tastes great and the mouthfeel could be better but isn't so overwhelming that you can only have one. I will enjoy this again."
"D- Very very drinkable, this is what a stout should be. I could see myself drinking several pint of this in a social setting. Very well done."
"D- Good flavor and very reasonable abv make this a good session choice if you can afford it."
"Bitter coffee hits you right away followed by a nice floral and citrus hop kick. It's creamy but not in an over the top manner, giving it the consistency of a typical stout. Flavor wise its really different for a stout but definitely conforms with the typical hop usage exhibited in most of FFF offerings. Another job well done."
"D - very drinkable, however, this is not what I was expecting. This is the first stout that I have tried from FFF, and I must say that I plan on sticking to the other stuff (unless of course it is Dark Lord). It's too bad because I love stouts, and I love hops, this particular brew just didn't have the right balance for me."
"Mouthfeel is medium light bodied, fairly flat."
"Taste is also a big different. Moylan's retains that deep roasted bitterness of mild coffee and slightly phenolic spiciness and virtually no hop profile to speak of. The mouthfeel is lacking though, rather watery and feels undercarbonated feel where there should be a thicker, more substantial body. Black Sun has a fuller, more substantial and chewy mouthfeel which places it a step above Moylan's, but the flavor profile is again off from the style. Licorice and a slight chocolatly sweetness mixes with an undercurrent of estery fruitiness. I am going to have to give the edge to Moylan's on this taste test that wasn't even that blind thanks to the huge amount of hops in Black Sun. Moylan's tastes more like an Irish Stout should while the Black Sun tastes a bit too sweet for my tastes."
"While this is probably going to the be best Irish Dry Stout I ever have, and most far from traditional, I'd still take many regular stouts over it."
"D - Quite possibly the best Irish Dry Stout that I've had. Great flavors!"
"The body is moderate. Would have liked a much drier finish and crispness for style. Overall the beer is not bad but the hop is a bit much and some off notes in the nose and taste really distract."
"Poured to a jet-black with medium thick tan head hat lingered well thru mid-glass and left okay lacing. Nose was a pleasant chocolate-caramel malt with hints of earth scents as well. The mouthfeel of this medium-bodied beer was full and somewhat sweet, and the taste accentuated the chocolate-caramel of the nose. Alcohol never did make itself known, which at 5.25 is not surprising. Finish was sustained and pleasant. A pretty good stout."
"This is one unique take on a dry stout and very, very good. It's also extremely drinkable for a stout - a great session brew."
"d - great sipper and spot on for the style."
"Overall not a bad stout here I have to admit. A smooth drinking, nice session able beer from them, which was a welcome treat. Not sure what the age has done to it as it was still mighty fresh in flavor and vibrant in life. Overall I thought this was excellent and would go here again for sure."
"Damn. I love this beer. If you don't like hoppy stouts, this one may not impress. But it's done really well here, and it's great stuff."
"D-Would drink this all day and probably pass out at the tap."
"D: Easily drinkable and I'm glad FFF didn't screw it up by making the ABV too high... not that they frequently screw up or anything... they just tend to get too extreme at times."
"A nice smooth, full mouthfeel that goes down very easily. This great mouthfeel plus the low ABV keeps this beer very drinkable."
"Black Sun Stout pours an opaque black from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma has hints of coffee and chocoate. The flavor also has hints of coffee and chocolate, but realy the star player is the hops, northwest citrus and piney hop flavors permeate this beer. This is an excellent beer, but really it is what I would call either an American stout or an American Irish dry stout. It's not a traditional Irish dry stout."
"Would I have another? I'm out for the year, but otherwise, hell yeah!"
"Thanks, Wadsey, for the second chance (with a fresh bottle, this time)"
"Black Sun is really, really good. I can't believe I waited this long to try it, but I will definitely treat myself to this one as regularly as possible."
"Thanks to yem25 for trading me this brew to try!"
"22 ounce bottle, purchased at Keg Liquors, Clarksville, IN (Thanks Todd!). Served in a pint glass, the beer pours very dark brown/black with about an inch and a half tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells like roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, dark fruit and citrusy and piney hops. Very nice aroma. The taste is the same as the aroma. It's a hoppy version of an Irish dry stout, and it's pretty good. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's not thick but it's not watery either. Carbonation is average. Drinkability is very good, it's smooth and extremely easy to drink. I think it's a very good choice for a session beer, I'm sorry I didn't buy more of this. Definitely recommended!"
"Three Floyds has come up with a very good and unique release. This is not one of my favorite styles, but they've developed an ultra-hopped, nicely carbonated deviation from the norm. I'm impressed. This is easily one of the best Irish dry stouts out there. Recommended."
"If I ever make it to Munster I will go to the brewery strictly for Black Sun."
"The beer pours an opaque dark brown, almost black, with a nice tan head that falls back into the beer eventually. Immediately hit with an aroma of roasted barley and hops, maybe a touch of chocolate and coffee as well. There's definitely a balanced flavor here, of hops, roasted barley, chocolate. The mouthfeel is good, not too bitter, with an aftertaste that mirrors the flavors and aromas. Also an exceptionally drinkable beer. Smooth, velvety stout that you can definitely have a few of; no stout drinker could be satisfied with just one."
"Pours a nice dark, opaque color with good head and good lacing. It has a nice burnt grain taste, although there is a distinctive floral/hoppy aroma with it. It also has a decent stout taste, which again is almost overcome by the hops. It does go down smooth."
"HV"
"Thanks to lightindarkness for the chance to try this"
"So i had this while waiting in line at DLD 2008 but i probably was turned off because i drank it after the 2008 DLD, however it was still raelly good. it came off being like water compared to the DLD however it was really good, very good slightly sweet charachter and a really good crisp finish. dead black as well with a light head build up"
"Drinkability- I've always really like Irish Stouts but for some dumbass reason rarely drink them. I really thought it was going to be over-the-top hoppy from the nose (just like I thought Alpha Klaus would be too) but it most definitely wasn't. This thing is mega smooth and super easy drinking. Hugely quaffable at 5.25% this makes for a great all nighter (if you can afford to drink them all night). Highly recommended, almost mandatory that you give this thing a try!"
"Pours a black color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy dark tan color, very little sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is malty, nice tones of chocolate/toffee/coffee/caramel. The taste is slightly bitter, with some nice maltiness, nice touch of dark chocolates. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a tasty one."
"D: It was a very drinkable IDS. The low ABV, thin body and muted flavors make this an easy beer to drink long into a night of playing pool."
"Mouthfeel was thin to medium with light carbonation. Very similar to many Irish Dry Stouts. I probably made a mistake cellaring this one. I believed this to be a higher alcohol/heavier stout."
"Pours black, with a light tan head and a smell of dry roastiness with nicely noticeable hop nose which you don't generally expect from the style, and which almost gives in a minty freshness. Taste is roasty, mild, and dry with a subtle and simple hop flavor giving it a bit of added flavor. Very drinkable, I found, and although not groundbreaking, I thought it was exceptional for the style, albeit overpriced..."
"D: Not too shabby, but probably in the bottom of the beers I've had from FFF."
"Definitely 'not normal', the oddest Irish stout I've had. Hoppier than I am used to for a stout. I'm not sure I'll be visiting this one again."
"D - overall, a really tasty brew that is super easy to drink. Have to say this would be a great brew that is really easy to session as it is full of flavor, not overpowering and a nice low ABV. Definitely one of the better beers for the style especially."
"Highly recommended. The 3F prices may be too high, but they put out some solid beers."
"If I found this at a bar, there would be none others as far as I'm concerned. Take 5 Guiness, boil them down to its essence, do the same to 5 Beamishes and 5Murphys', and then bottle them, and you may get close to this one. Highly drinkable and fantastic!"
"D: This goes down quite smoothly, albeit a little light towards the end, as said. I'd have a second if it had been available, but unfortunately, that wasn't the case, so this one will have to be enjoyed for what it's worth."
"Overall drinkability is excellent. Great fullness and balance of flavor achieved with a remarkably low abv compliment it's overall character. Aftertaste and aroma leave me wanting a lot more. I could drink a ton of this stuff."
"M/D: Full bodied, some light carbonation on the tongue. Very good drinkability. You mean to tell me this and Guinness are of the same style? Like the bottle says, it's not normal. Very impressed with FFFs so far."
"From notes: Dark black but with light tinged edges of ruby. Off-white/tan head of foam is decent and stays awake for the life of the brew. Aromas of typical dry irish stout roasted malts, bread, coffee, chocolate, and slight green hops. Taste is very guiness extra stout like with a nice edginess brought on by the hops. Mouthfeel is dry and medium bodied and the finish is nice, non cloying, and lends to a good drinkability. good shit for sure, but nothing amazing or new to see here."
"Drinkability: I suppose the lighter feel may add to the drinkability of this one by not being as heavy and overpowering as some stouts prove to be. Decent beer but far from the best from FFF."
"This is a solid stout from Three Floyds. The aroma translates pretty well into the flavor. Light roastiness is the canvas with a splash of lactic creaminess here and dark fruit there. The dark fruit shows up on the backend."
"A very drinkable beer - most beers with this much complexity come with a much higher ABV. A very tasty stout."
"The taste is pretty nice, good roasted malts and chocolate, awfully bitter, can feel the hops coming through, but the thinner body fails on this beer, and then it dries up too much. And thats where it fails me. I was hoping for a bit more out of this beer, oh well."
"Thanks to UncleJedi for the opportunity to try this sucker."
"Another incredible brew from FFF. How do these guys do it?"
"The beer has an opaque black hue with two fingers of tan head on it. I wasn't expecting the aroma that this beer had. I was ready for the roasted barley and burnt coffee scent, but a huge blast of floral aromatics also come fairly heavy to my nose. It was packed with citrus floral scents from the dry hopping. The flavor profile is actually really nice on this. The taste loses the floral aromatics and sticks more to the dry Irish stout style. Dark bitter coffee, bitter chocolate, dark fruits, and roasted barley work very well on the palate. I am really enjoying the flavors on this beer, but my nose and my palate are not syncing up here and that really takes something away from the beer. The mouthfeel is big and chewy and really nice for the beer. This actually drinks very nice, but overall the scent and flavor profile do not really mingle that well."
"Drinkability - Very easy. Nicely balanced. Recommended!"
"Beautiful light brown lacing surrounded the glass. The alcohol was very well hidden. Rich, bold with a nice balance of chocolate, coffee, and malt. BSS is another great showing from FFF. I just wish I could get this in Georgia."
"Overall: a solid stout, especially for a coffee lover. It's an overhopped version but still a very nice, drinkable beer. I'm curious to try it on tap--I'm guessing the coffee and overly strong flavors might be smoother, which would really improve the beer."
"M&D - smooth and quite easy down, on the cusp of acridity, but never careens off that precipice, full of body and flavor, a great and strong stout that is a great beer, thicker body than any dry stout i have ever had, well done 3F"
"Taste is similar to aroma with some pine and citrus flavors followed by coffee, chocolate, toffee, roasted malts and a bit of a smoky flavor. Theres also a hint of woodsy licorice in the finish; it reminds me slightly of Kalamazoo Stout. I actually like this stout very much, one of the best dry stouts Ive had so far."
"Pours a midnight black with a one finger tan colored head that quickly dies down to a thin layer that lasts throughout. Stickiness is pretty weak, not a whole lot there. Smell, now this was a shock. Huge hop aromas of pine and citrus, say what? Yeah, hops, hops, and more hops with a bit of smokey malt and some caramel. I can't help but give this one a 5 for smell. Taste is smooth roasted barley with a bit of sweet citrus that tingles throughout. Aftertaste is a smokey sweet, I can't put my finger on it exactly...but it's good. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, and dry with a mild amount of carbonation. Wow, such a unique and amazing experience. What else do you expect from Three Floyds? Get your hands on this one for sure."
"Bottle courtesy of Hogtownharry: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a small foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of medium bitter hops with some roasted malt. Texture is quite oily with some medium carbonation. Taste is a complex mix between some bitter roasted malt, some light chocolate notes as well as vanilla with some light bitter hops at the end. I very much enjoyed that one and I was glad that they didnt rely only on hops."
"D: This strikes me as a very underrated beer. The dry stout body manages to sneak through and show off its darker notes while letting the hops run wild. A revolutionary beer!"
"This is one fine fucking stout, and that may be about all I should say. The creaminess is not too thick and everything seems oh so right. It may be a bit more -turbo stout- than I am uses to in a Dry Irish Stout but do not care too much. mmm"
"D: Quite drinkable."
"Had another bottle 2.5 years later, jason's, and it was a little oily side hampered drinkability."
"Drinkability: Thanks, may I have another? This is an easy-drinker; I'd have several of these on a cool night."
"Shared courtesy of the ever generous fisherman34. Thanks Kris!! This is one tasty brew. Beautiful looking stout with a great nose of roasty hoppy goodness. This is a complex brew that is really telling on how complex brew doesn't need to be a booze bomb. Roasty, medium body and medium carbonation with a cascade hop kick at the tail end. Finishes very nicely. Great session stout and holds its own against its bigger brothers. Well done FFF!"
"Overall, what a fantastic brew. You can always count on breweries like 3F to take a tried and true style and turn it on its ear. While off the beaten path for a Dry Stout, this is one I would frequently purchase if it wasn't so darn expensive."
"Poured black with a decent light brown head that fades quickly but left some decent lacing. The aromas are a little light- just a whiff of roasted grain and creaminess. The flavor is aalso somewhat light, but with clean flavors of lightly roasted grain, a touch of cocoa and a slight licorice flavor. Dry apple on the finish. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Delicious, a very nice dry stout."
"i don't typically like stouts but this one i could do. served from nitro-tap at the 3f pub, looked just like a guinness but after that guinness does not measure up to this beer for my taste. this had all the familiar aromas of a stout, complex dark roasted malts which suggested chocolate, coffee, and dark bread. i enjoyed the nice touch of malt sweetness upfront in this beer which was quickly wiped out by the nice roasty notes and noticeable hop bitterness. finished surprisingly crisp considering it was nitro and a tad sweet upfront. this would be good off a regular tap as well. another excellent beer from 3f. abv, mouthfeel, and body were medium, unlike the thin style of american guinness."
"Cheers!"
"Nitro pour from Cole's, enjoyed with oberon and his better half on a lovely spring afternoon in Buffalo, before all this nasty-ass January snow and cold descended on us again. Tar-black with mahogany-blood-red highlights and a viscous whipped to the point of having peaks dark beige nitro head. Surprisingly hoppy nose, with leafy cannabis-esque points arising in between a solid bed of black-roasted chocolate essence. Heavy on the dark roasted grain flavor: burnt toast with coffee butter and an earthy acidity to balance it out. Awe-inspiring coniferous hop burps. Hands-down the most excellent use of nitro I've experienced with a beer. It imparted a full, chewy and creamy mouthfeel to this already thick beer (I've also sampled it from a regular tap). I want this beer around regularly. Give it to me. Now."
"Poured nitro at Cole's yesterday,a beautiful pour to this ink black with a cascading mocha colored head that settled into a two finger creamy top giving off a creamy mustache after every drink.Light earthy,leafy tones in the nose along with some dark roast coffee with a hint of smoke,this is a dry stout I could quaff all day with the nitro giving it the creamy texture man its dangerously drinkable.Healthy dose of hops to this dry stout earthy and herbal with hints of toasted nuts and strong coffee with a lingering lightly smoked woody elemant in the finish.My new favorite dry stout this would be dangerous on ST. Pattys day,man that is good stuff."
"D - I was very impressed with this beer overall. Hits the style perfectly, tastes great, and the aroma characteristics were stunning. I have only been able to try a couple of 3F beers before, and based on those I expected them to go way too far and crush this style with hops and alcohol, but I was totally wrong. Great, great beer, and at 5.25% easy to take down a few of them."
"What in intrigueing brew. Dry stout with awesome citrus hops. I will enjoy this one again. Very unusual."
"A pretty solid dry irish stout, would make a great session stout."
"Taste is roasted, coffee with some mild maltbitter notes. There is a strange sweetness to the beer that isn't sticky. Hops give the beer an earthy or ground-like taste. Yeast profile is fruity and makes the mouthfeel smooth and velvety. Overall, I think this beer misses a bit of extra burned or maltbitter."
"D: Insanely sessionable. Full of various flavors that blend well together over the course of the sample. One of the tastiest Irish Stouts that I have tried. Recommended."
"While this wasn't my favorite of this style, I found it to be quite drinkable."
"drinkability is good. the alcohol comes through much stronger than expected, making it feel more like 10%abv than 5. the malt is also a little lighter than expected, making this one a little unbalanced. still a tasty and enjoyable beer."
"Please let this one approach cellar temperature as the beer really shines when served at just under room temps."
"Recommended."
"This was a real treat to sample, and at 5.25% I can't believe this lasted for 2 years in the cellar. Another sheer pleasure from Three Floyds that deserves praise for its incredible character."
"Split a 22 oz bomber of this with my good friends (one of whom brought it down from Three Floyd's). Poured into pint glasses. It pours a thick, opaque black with an off-white head. Smells of syrup, caramel, molasses, roasted malts, alcohol. Tastes much of the same: alcohol, roasted malt, molasses. Balanced with a great bitter finish. Medium-to-heavy thickness on the mouthfeel, a little chewy. Very drinkable beer due to its balance of flavors. As with many stouts (in my experience), the flavors and aromas become much more pronounced as it warms, which I really like."
"Poured from a bomber into my pint glass. Opaque black liquid with almost no head, that split in a hurry. No lacing either. Smell is of chocolate and hoppy fruits. Tasty is more roasted malt chocolates and bitter dry hops. The fruitiness dies off in the mouth, but what is there is raisiny. Very crisp light and dry feel, probably the beers most redeeming quality. I find this to be a drinkable stout."
"Drinkability: Superb. If it were not $9 a bottle, I would be drinking far more Black Sun. A friend split this beer with me. Despite stouts not being his favorite beer, he was star struck by this brew."
"On tap at the Firkin."
" This is probably the best (non-imperial) stout I've ever had. I bought it on sale afer it had been sitting for awhile and at 5.25% I was wondering how well it would keep, but this stuff is great! I'm going back for more soon. It sucks that 3F is so hard to find around here now, because I think my supply of this is about to dry up like the supply of Alpha King already has. Black Sun is a truly great beer that I can't wait to have again."
"Took the bottle from the fridge and poured it into my glass. Nice black stout with a small dark brown head that didn't stick around very long. Smell of coffee, licorice and dark chocolate came through even with my cold. Light body with light carbonation - perfect for a stout. Well balanced malt and hops, with a nice hoppy finish and a little roasted malt to go along with it. A little hint of warmth after swallowing. Alcohol may be just a touch too high for a stout. Still, a very drinkable beer that I'm glad comes in a 22 oz bottle because a 12 oz bottle just wouldn't be enough."
"D - One of the best stouts I have ever had. At 5.25% ABV could be an everyday drinkerif it wasn't so pricey."
"You really have to chew the hell out of this beer to get any sort of complex malt character and even then, there is hardly a hint of goodness. Its outrageously hoppy in both the aroma and flavor. Its unbalanced for me, way too hoppy and i like hoppy beers. Not enjoyable, but finishable."
"A big o Super bomber of Stout for Super Bowl Sunday! Poured into a snifter, this sucks in the light like a black hole, but has no head whatsoever. The aroma is sweet and fruity with a definite medicinal flourish. I guess 5% is relatively high for a stout, but on the first swallow I might guess this to be a higher gravity brew. This drinks with a strong java roastiness but theres also a ethylene viscosity, while not as robust as a Baltic Porter, at least reminded me of one. This is delicious, if not a bit thin for the body in the flavor. (#2684, 2/4/2007)"
"Pours complete opaque with a dark tan head that vanishes quickly without a whole lot of lacing. Smells like deeply roasted malt & coffees. Thick, almost chewy cappuccino with a balanced hop mouth feel. While i do get a creamy sense, i'm observing an average drinkability because i find the deep roast on the extreme side. I'm compelled to nurse this one."
"The drinkability is great. I can hardly keep from chugging this most excellent brew. Prosit und Zum Wohl. MK"
"Another treat from the Floyds!"
"Mouth is thick and pleasing for a stout. In all, I know these bombers are expensive (in terms of beer costs out here in the NW) but in spite of that I bet I would buy it from time to time anyway because it's really good. A definite pleaser for the stout lover."
"A very nice offering from Three Floyds. Its too bad I cant get this out on the East Coast, very much a session stout."
"This is a great stout. Nice and balanced. Dry as one would expect. There are hints of sweetness that top this off as a great drink."
"I had this on tap at FFF. I had a nice tan head on top of a dark black body. The nose is full of roasted malt (coffee and grainy) with plenty of floral hops. There is a good dose of bitersweet chocolate and coffee, with some hoppiness. A real nice creamy mouthfeel with tight carbonation. It finshes fairly dry."
"I'm someone who was reared on Irish Dry Stouts, so when I find a good one (and this most certainly qualifies) I'm sure to drink lots. Excellent example of the style."
"Color is jet black, with extremely slight reddish tints at the edges. While I haven't had extensive experience with stouts, this is without a doubt the darkest beer I've seen (let alone actually drank). The head is dark cream colored, with almost a rust tinge throughout. Head dissipated quickly. Hops are the main scent, with underlying bases of raisin and chocolate. Taste is mostly cocoa, with undertones of raisin and berries, finishing with a stong bitter hop flavor. Mouthfeel is somewhat creamy, with a slight feel of carbonation. Drinkability is good, though the richness of the stout makes it suffer a slight bit. A very tasty beer, and one I'll certainly be trying again in the future."
"A real good stout that would certainly split nice with a special someone in front of a roaring fire."
"D: I wish I had more... Very drinkable. I will definitely revisit this; hopefully sooner, rather than later."
"D- It is very good. Easy to drink and a very well balanced beer, is complex at the same too."
"Almost black in color, topped by a thin layer of brown bubbles. Very, very intense roasted aromas in the nose, almost to the point of being smokey. The taste is dry and malty, chewy and smooth. There's something unique here - perhaps the combination of dryness and smoke - that I can't exactly put my finger on. ""Smoke"" doesn't seem right, but it's as close as I can come up with, so I'm going with it - almost more like Liquid Smoke flavoring. Pretty darn good (though it pales in comparison to the Alpha Klaus tasted just prior to drinking it)."
"I'm slowly becoming a very big fan of Three Floyd's. Can't wait to try more of their stuff."
"Well done."
"D: 5.25% abv = waaaay drinkable. Very satisfying roasted flavors coupled with that FFF hoppiness. An excellent stout!"
"Drinkability - this is very good, rather original in the roast, inspired, quite tasty, and has low enough abv ( low to me, anyway ) to make it most sessionable."
"Sadly, I bought the last one from Ricks in Alexandria, VA, in Nov. '06 and for all I know the last bottle on the east coast. Let's hope 3FFFs can share with their friends out here again in the near future!"
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, it’s a little bit filling though. I made short work of the bomber that I had, but I’m thinking that after a second bomber I’d feel to full to drinking much more, especially if I were eating something with it. Overall, I think this is an excellent beer."
"Drinkability: At 5.2% this is a good session stout. Not very abbrasive, not too much carbonation. A great smell, nothing special in the taste. Unfornately it doesn't live up to the billing on its label (not ordinary) was expecting something more. And yet, the paradox here is that its nice to see an american brewery make a nice balanced stout, one which does capture that irish dry catagory very well."
"Poure dout like darth vader's cape with no head whatsoever. The nose has lots of spice, cinnamon and nutmeg, with malt, coffee, and chocolate. A slightly syurpy mouthfeel with heavy notes of bitter chocolate and some coffee, rounded out by a tiny amount of sour cherry. Long coffee finish."
"From the bomber to a proper pint glass, the Black Sun Stout is deep black in color. Not the darkest stout I've ever seen, but a nice color nonetheless. Thin dark brown head at the top which dissipates all too soon. The aroma is sweetish. Malted cocoa, coffee, and a not-unpleasant burnt charcoal smell. The taste complements the aroma perfectly in my opinion. Matly sweetness with a hint of vanilla, some sour cherry, coffee, and chocolate. Nice woody finish at the back of the mouth. But the mouthfeel is a bit thin for my liking. It could stand to be beefed up a bit, if that makes sense. Still, it's not a bad beer. And I would be tempted to serve this with dessert for the holidays."
"Notes: Special thanks to cahage for the sampling."
"Solid onyx with thin mahogany highlights. Tall, thick cocoa colored head of small bubbles piled around airy pockets and topped with chocolate milk-like froth. Calms down to a fine bubbled thin skim with stacks at the edges. A few clumps of thin lace cling to the sides. Rich aromas of cocoa, chocolate, roasted cherries, and vanilla extract with some sprucy alcohol. Light smokiness wrapped around bittersweet chocolate finishes with a bitterness of both hops and roasted malt. Sweet, dark fruit meshes with deeply roasted chocolate. The body is medium with a relatively light mouthfeel despite the low carbonation level. This oscillates all over the place, with one taste being filled with roasted bitterness, while the next is dominated with fruit. The vanilla comes through, but it is smoky, as if you held a whole bean over an open flame and it started to burn. An alcohol prickliness tickles the back of the throat. Nice and tasty, with a multitude of flavors whirling around. Not inexpensive at $8 though."
"Drinkability: Nice little beer. Though that's not something I usually say about FFF brews. Usually, I like them quite a bit more. Not a lot really stands out about this beer, but not a lot really hinders it either. For $8 a bomber, I definitely don't need to revisit it."
"Amazingly smooth. Very drinkable. Definitely on my top list of ""stranded on a desert island"" picks. I just wish there was a stronger flavor, and that it was cheaper."
"Drinkability: Pretty good beer, all things considered. It could've used more chocolatiness, though."
"Dark, dark brown, with barely a hint of light through the edges. Small, dependable, glass-crawling, cocoa brown head. Nose is full of caramel, malted milk, roasted marshmallows, coffee, dark chocolate, and peaty bitterness. Complex and good. Gentle roasted bitterness greets the tip of the tongue, followed by smooth, sweet malts. Charred fruits, milk chocolate, mocha coffee. Yum. Finish is dry and bitter and chocolaty. Medium-bodied. Gentle, smooth, consistent carbonation. Very well done."
"Poured deep black color with a brown head that left excellant lacing. Smell is incredible, piney hops come right through, paired with some roastiness and cocoa. I wouldn't normally expect so much hoppyness in a dry stout, but it paired wonderfully. Taste of coffee and cocoa paired with a wonderful piney hoppyness. Mouthfeel had medium carbonation and medium body, very dry finish. I love this, and even with the steep price tag, I will and did pick up more. Definitely worth trying."
"Overall I would have to say this was one of the very best Stouts I have ever had."
"This beer pours a dark-as-night black color with an equally dark head. I tried to tease out the smell, but there was little there to get. Faint notes of dark toasted grains add a bit of sweetness to it. The taste is the best part. I had this after a day of craving a beer and this seemed to fit perfect. Definitly not too big of a mouthfeel, but a wonderfully long-lasting aftertaste that leaves you craving more. But this never seems to get old, as too many beers do. A great find."
"Drinkability/Notes: Black Sun Stout is a very interesting dry irish stout. Big hops and roasted malt dominate. Very easy to drink and dry to the finish definitely makes you want to take another swallow. Nice and creamy in the mouth with a lingering hoppy finish. Not your typical dry irish stout by any means. Another fantastic beer from Three Floyds. Seek and enjoy. Highly recommended."
"Hmmm boy, did I enjoy this one. It's sat in my fridge about a month for a night like tonight, nice and casual with my wife. Right from its colder beginnings, I could taste and smell its quality coffee. the vanilla and caramel was a bit harder to notice until the temperature rose. Very nice lacing and head rentention, this is one classic Dry Stout. Enjoyed this 22 oz. thoroughly"
"Pours black with a thin tan head which dissipates quickly and leaves a little lacing on the surface and sides. Smell is roasted/burnt malt and tons of citrusy hops. Most striking about the nose is it's intesity- these are strong roasted malt and hop aromas. Nice. Big roasted malt taste quickly turns into bigtime citrus hops. This is definitely hoppier than any other stout I've had imperial or otherwise. Good, if a bit off balance. Mouthfeel is thick and nicely carbonated. Good stuff, different. Fairly drinkable"
"Pours black with a tannish brown small head that fades quickly. Aroma is a combination of a big roastiness balanced by a sweeter sugary chocolate. There is also a little smokiness and a decent amount of tart cherry in the smell. Flavor starts with a big deep roasted malt that goes quickly past a sweetness in the middle to a powerful sour-tart sweetness. I also get a little anise-black licorice up front in the roasted maltiness. Medium in body and fairly smooth and soft on the palette, the finish has some hop bitterness with a nice dryness that brings the roasted flavor back up. Very drinkable for me, the sour-tart sweetness was on the verge of being overpowering for me, but the other aspects kept me coming back until the end."
"I have yet to encounter a FFF brew that I haven't loved, and this is no different."
"So this is black but the best part is that the head is chocolate color with a med-small density of bubbles that hangs out for a good long while. The smell is nice and roast mild with some sweetness of malt and a decent touch of hops. Overall this is one of the better low alcohol Irish stouts I have had. Tasty without being too roasted, a nice heft to the body, with some actual hop flavor and a rather smooth finish. Very drinkable and I wouldn't mind having another case."
"A very drinkable stout. Kind of feels like a combo of a porter and a stout. I enjoyed it and will again. One bomber is not enough."
"Not at all what I expect from Three Floyds. Just no character whatsoever."
"Quite drinkable, well executed and almost an exact duplicate of North Coast's Black Hart (which is certainly more affordable at $4.99 per sixpack at Trader Joes.)"
"This is a beauty that I love to see onyx black body with an inch thick milk chocolate colored head. Nose has strong cola like zest that includes notes of chocolate, pine and malt. A very even burnt bitter malt enters the mouth. The palate includes very pronounced hoppy feel that is very unique for such a dark stout. With this is almost a citrus feel. This is the hoppiest stout I have ever had, While still keeping the integraty of the stout. Mouthfeel is thick and dark but balanced by the hops. Drinkability is enhanced by its uniqueness."
"Poured a thick and muddy practically black brown, appearance is not unlike used engine oil, like a thicker espresso. Thin half finger of brown head quickly fades to a light beige sticky ring of lacing, leaving a coating where the head once was. Aroma is mainly characterized by deep roasted coffee and malts, earthy undertones, has a slight burnt bittersweet character that lingers in the nose.Taste is more complex than the smell, adding some chocolate sweetness and sweet dark fruits that brings some balance to the overall dry roastiness this brew projects. Mouthfeel is moderate heaviness with low levels of carbonation, slippery and smooth on the tongue, coats the throat. Drinkability is high, easy to drink with an appreciative complexity that goes well with theh lower abv. Overall, another great product from the good folks at Three Floyds, very solid beer. Nothing over the top, but certainly fits the bill for an Irish Dry Stout. Strongly recommend trying, would purchase again."
"D- A little thin yet very drinkable. For the price there are much better stouts out there."
"if my wallet was fatter. As is, it's 2x the price of things like Shakespeare Stout, and only 75% as good."
"Overall, the sourness stops this beer from being a top notch stout."
"-UF"
"An exceptional stout. A mind over matter...of drinking the hell out of the bomber type of brew that exhumes itself from the depths of obscured stout sessioning. What the hell I'm I talking about? Just drink it. You'll be impressed; and if you're not, more for me ...ya simpleton."
"I really enjoyed this beer. My third offering from FFF and I've yet to be disappointed."
"The dryness of this one is really refreshing for the style."
"The BIF 30 package from BA orbitalr0x included this 22 oz. bomber, and I am finally getting around to it. When poured into the pint glass, this looked as black as any beer Ive ever seen, with a mocha colored foamy head. When holding up against strong back light, the body did not let a single photon pass through, so the color remained jet black. The aroma was a bit too timid for a beer that had such good looks. All I could detect was a distant coffee and burnt grain notes riding atop light alcohol fumes. The taste was very smoky with the coffee, toffee, and chocolate flavors being most prominent, followed by dense and citric hop bitterness. The finish was roasty and burnt, and aftertaste swung back into hoppy flavor again. The body was not overly thick to begin with, and the creaminess imparted by the carbonation made it feel even less so. It was a pretty easy task to get this bomber down."
"D: Pretty good stout. Decently complex, rich and satisfying."
"chocolate raspberry dessert."
"Well this is no Dreadnaught but this is still a quite drinkable beer. This is a stout that will be best enjoyed by those who like a deeply roasted and bitter stout more than a sweet one. In flavor this resembles Flying Dog Gonzo quite a bit."
"-Oelergud"
"Cheers."
"Pours a very thick, black opaque color, darkest beer I have ever seen. A nice caramel colored head, that retains very well. At first, the scent has a quick burst of some hoppy floral aroma. Then the raosted chocolate and coffee scents begin to dominate the aroma. The taste has that strong raosted malt chocolate flavor, with the coffee being the most evident and stronger. There is a hop bitterness at the end of each taste and it lingers on the palate. The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I expected, since it poured very thick inot the glass. It was more medium bodied and had a slick oily texture. Drinkability, could be so-so, it is not what one would expect from a stout, but it is still a very good beer."
"This is a very nice and drinkable stout. A whole lot of flavor. At 5.25% ABV you can't really hurt yourself to bad."
"I gave it a 5, nuff said."
"Taste is excellent. Very prominent hops for a stout, and they stand up very well to the roasted dark malts here. Dark fruits taste like fig newtons. A fresh, red cherry sweetness lingers throughout. The dark chocolate and burnt coffee notes are unmistakable, of course, but the fruitiness here is sublime. Roasted almonds emerge at room temperature, adding a smokiness. Very, very nice...A wonderful sipper. What a pleasant surprise! Goes down very easy. A very worthy little brother of the Dark Lord...."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" dark brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head fades gradually down to an uneven layer of bubbles, with ample brown lacing. Aroma is fresh green hops with a blackstrap bitter malt tinge. Taste is upfront with the piney hops, quickly almost balanced by the hearty dark malts and their totally different bitterness. All flavors linger in the mouth long after the swallow. Mouthfeel and drinkability both superb, so much flavor and only 5.25abv? Excellent!"
"This thing pours deep brown. Black. Decent head of chocolate colour. The nose holds so much citrus within a roasted malt envelope. This smells like alpha king made with roasted malt. Hops come through in typical luscious 3F fashion. The taste again holds citrus. It works amazingly well. There is a sort of smoky, roasted malt, dark, bitter flavour mixed with a juicy hop character. A bit of chocolate. Possibly coffee. The mouthfeel is medium to light. Drinkability is exceptional as usual. Three Floyds throwing their house spin on things to great effect."
"Mouthfeel is moderate, borderline thin. I was expecting something over the top but this is pleasantly mild. Extremely drinkable, but probably a bit too sweet for the Irish Dry style. I could easily session this."
"Nice bit of roasty coffee type malt flavours. Some muted fruit, with undertones of vanilla. Citrusy hops start off subdued, and become more prominent as it warms, becoming almost overbearing by the end. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation. Dry, but definitely American. Nice."
"Yep, it's dry all right. Upon the first few sips, I began caughing up suit. But that does not mean that it's bad. In fact, it's an amazing Dry Stout. The look is an expected nearly-opaques burned amber brown with a light and airy foamstand, slightly tan in nature. Smells strongly roasted (coffee-like) without any burned or ashy aromas. Sweetness is light and a fermentation yeastiness persists in the nose. Tastes boldly of roasted grains, cocoa, and campfire-like. Sweetness really takes a back seat to the rosted grains and offers only a balance to the roastedness. Hop detection is nil, relying majorily on the roasted grain for bittering. Lightened in body for an easy drinking beer. Could handle a bit more creaminess. The finish is very dry and powdery (charcoal-ish). Quite clean despite the roasted grain bitterness. A huge success for FFF."
"Comments  Id like to throw out a big BA mugs up to BeerGuy for bringing this bomber out to Seattle."
"Overall this is a very good stout, maybe a bit too flavored of hops (I can't believe I just wrote that), but I'd definitely drink it again."
"In summary: there are some pretender stouts on the market, but don't be fooled. Three Floyds brews this stuff with the intent of converting black sun star mass into energy...and result is a beer so dense, well, you know where I'm going with this..."
"like wearing sweatpants to high school... sometimes you just can't get up. this beer is fantastic. not all 3Fs blow me away.. but when they do.. they just slay me. this is killer, I wish this was available locally here, fantastic. Seek this one out, I sure as hell will."
"D - This is one very yummy beer and another solid offering from Three Floyds. It's got enough flair to be unique without straying from the style, and makes for a very satisfying treat."
"A dark black beer with chestnut highlights as you pour. Has a big foamy light brown head. The aroma is dominated by a very fragrent hop boquet, sweet and a little floral. There is a hint of roasted malt lurking in the background with hints of chocolate and coffee. There is a quick burst of sweet grapefruit on the tip of your tongue. Followed by the roasted malt character slathering itself over the rest. The finish starts with a bittersweet chocolate note at the back of your tongue followed by the hops nailing down a nice dry finish and a nice coffee like after taste."
"Another original and unique creation from Three Floyds. Rock on."
"Beautiful black color with a sizeable tan head on top. Really a classic looking stout. Nice, mellow roasted aroma. Tiny traces of bittersweet chocolate and some hops thrown in. Oustanding roasted and chocolate flavors with a big ole hunk of coffee strung right thru it-mellow espresso? Good level of roasted bitterness and subtle traces of the hops. Very, very nice dry finish. Well done in that respect. Great body-for the low abv its quite the ""meal"". Probably the best beer I have had from 3 Floyds. A bit pricey for the bottle but outstanding none the less."
"Cheers"
"Black pour, no real head, just a touch of tan foam that disappears looking a bit flat. Smell of toasty coffee and quite strong grassy hops. Seems less like a stout and more like a hoppy pale ale in aroma. Taste has faint coffee and chocolate notes, dark and roasty, but again, strong tangy hops are overpowering the mix. Moderate bitterness. Medium body, a wee bit watery, carbonation is decent. I was expecting more enjoyment from this stout, but the mild alcohol makes it decently easy to drink nonetheless..."
"Black Sun Stout hits every one its marks and is, therefore, the best version of this style that I can imagine. If you don't love hops above all else, you're unlikely to feel the same. There can't be too many beers of any style that combine this amount of taste bud saturating flavor with this degree of sessionability. Three Floyds hits another one out of the park. So what else is new?"
"Drinkability - a little too smoky for my tastes, but an enjoyable beer.3.0"
"Pours a deep black, with a noticable red tint as you pour. Tan head that drops quickly to a thin film that leaves faint trails of lacing on the glass. Smell and taste of bitter bakers chocolate. Bitterness gives a very dry finish to each sip. Somewhat chewy mouthfeel but then somehow it also taste a little thin. A nice drinkable stout that i would certainly enjoy at any chance I had."
"Pours out pitch black with a decent sized tan head that leaves some scattered webs of lacing around the glass. Big coffee notes with a strong backing of bitter hops in a similar manner of Alpha Klaus just not as much so. Roasted coffee starts off the flavor with some bitter earthy and floral hops. Light chocolate sweetness in the middle. Dry bitter roasted finish that lingers for awhile. Solid body over but I felt it would have benefited from a bit more girth. Easy drinking and a nice twist on the style as 3F so often does."
"Not at all what I expect in a stout, but exactly what I expect from Three Floyds. An insaner version of Rogue Shakespeare Stout, with punchier hops. Session stout for hopheads. Very much an India Black Ale, if there were such a thing. Since I'm drinking it, I guess there is. Forget Guinness, set me up with a couple bombers of this on St. Patty's Day. It's the good stuff. If you don't know, now you know. A little pricey at $8 a bomber in Rhode Island. Still worth it, at least for the experience."
"This is one of my very favorite beers. I'm sorry, Rogue, but 3 Floyds is now my favorite brewery. Grab this if you can find it. It makes life worth living."
"pours a midnight (black sun) black with a nice 2 finger fluffy tan head. excellent sticking and lacing. wow! the aroma! believe it or not, you get piney, grassy hops first and then a touch of sweet chocolate and coffee. swirling just explodes more hop aroma from the head. very unexpected. first sip is hop bitter with big roasted malts to balance. roasted, chocolate covered coffee beans with caramel nut in the finish. after the last of the 22oz bottle warms to just below room temperature, i get some nice dark fruit and sharp cheeze. nice bitter aftertaste that lingers as long as you wait between sips. not as dry in the finish as other irish stouts. 3 floyds claims this has a heavy body, but i don't see it. thin drinkable mouthfeel, to style, with a nice smooth swallow. tongue coating with a resiny grit that helps resemble a dry finish. medium carbonation. drinkability is quite high. bitter aftertaste keeps you drinking and the 5.25% is nowhere to be found. an easy session or an enjoyable sipper. overall, this stout pushes the envelope for an irish dry stout. it may just barely fall within the guidelines of the style, but it's as hoppy as a good russian imperial. complex balancing malty flavors makes this my favorite irish stout to date."
"drinkability: very drinkable"
"Not my favorite in the style, but definitely in the top 5...recommend this one if you have the opportunity."
"Inky black with a thick tam head. Nice fluffy head that leaves a clumpy lace on the side of the glass. Three Floyds beers have a unique aroma. The hops come across, thick and flowery. Ive heard they use Amarillo and Columbus hops for aroma. Many brewers could learn from these folks. The malt is there too, just a touch of chocolate and espresso, but its all about the hops. The flavor is nicely balanced. Milk chocolate, coffee, a little toasted malt with just a mild flowery hop flavor on the finish. It really brightens up the flavor. Nice sweetness right at the finish. Slick, smooth and rich mouth feel, very nice, very drinkable. Great beer."
"This is a very pleasant and drinkable (reasonable ABV) stout and while atypical in hop character a very pleasant creation. This is my first beer by this brewery and I will make an effort to try some more."
"But goddamn, it is a good tasting beer, but not a good beer for the price."
"The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. Awesome. Very insanely drinkable. I've been craving a beer with such a massive ass kicking flavor without the massive ass kicking alcohol buzz. Thanks again Three Floyds and jpm30."
"Very nice, soft mouthfeel really lets the beer fill every corner of the mouth. Exceedingly drinkable. The bomber disappears so quickly, leaving behind only a smile. A beer of character and originality which provides great pleasure to this taster."
"Pretty much totally black with a dark tan head. The smell is pretty much all hops. The taste has an extremely hoppy start, and only after the intense and complex hop flavor exits can I start to taste some malt. But by comparison, the malt flavor is small, with just a touch of chocolate and a tiny bit of fruit. The mouthfeel is thick and a bit dry, but not as thick as I expected. Overall I'm not sure this beer needs to be as intesne as it is for the ABV, and the hop flavor is slightly out of balance and hurts the drinkability. I think this recipe would be a bit better if they stepped up the malts and went for broke. But I guess they already have the DarkLord, so..."
"This one pours a very dark color with a moderately tall brown head that sticks around and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma has a huge US hop burst at first followed by a chocolate and malt backing. This is definately an American Stout, not an Irish dry stout. The flavor has a lot of chocolate and hints of coffee, but it also has a lot of hop flavor. Nice mix and well balanced. The body is at the high end of moderate and the drinkability is good. Nice beer."
"Pours a jet black color with a slightly less than one finger tan head that falls to a complete film over top. No light is getting through this one at all. Nose is full in hop aroma. I get big bright citrusy American hop, with a light hint of fresh, green hop aroma. The malt give me impressions of chocolate, light caramel sweetness and a moderate coffee roastedness coming in the end. Flavor hits immediate with hop bitterness and citrusy hop flavor with a nice herbal and fresh hop character. Behind that, there is good roasted characte r giving notes of coffee and a lighter chocolate sweetness. This is definately dominated by the hops in the flavor. Feel is on the thick end of moderate with a light carbonation that helps if feel like its a thicker brew. I like it. This one is definately an American Stout to me, not a dry stout, but call it what you want. I think its very tasty. I'd like to see the hop dowgraded a bit, but that is not the style of 3F's. This is a highly enjoyable and drinkable beer."
"An excellent example of what you can do with hops. Wow, these guys really know their stuff. Too bad it doesn't really work in this venue."
"Pours a deep and opaque black, little bit of red on the edges, big brown head, nice lace and good retention. Smell is pine, chocolate/coffee, caramel, vanilla, and more pine/coffee. Taste is coffee, chocolate, vanilla/toffee, up front, with a big molasses and pine hit in the finish, bitter coffee. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. A nice and experience, this stout is ""not normal."""
"Finish robs the tongue of moisture with a final bitter attack, leaving you gaping for more and wondering where the truckload of roasted hops that just ran over you went. Nice work 3F, Id like to try this one on draft."
"Thanks to Mr. Hustlemuscle for the bottle."
"Mouthfeel- Pretty oily, but at the same time, velvety. This beer that looks like squid ink, goes down much better than a triple shot of espresso straight. This beer gives the palate a very soothing feeling."
"After it was originally on nitro tap, I was able to drink it on straight up tap. The head was much fainter than the nitro version, but the flavors were the same essentially. The only thing I enjoyed about it was the flavors were slightly more pronounced with the thick foam accompanying it that you get on nitro. Alas, this beer is gone now and I will have to find a new favorite Brewpub beer."
"thanks, big thanks, to unionmade for securing me a bottle of this nectar."
"Drinkability: Interesting and good beer. I'd drink more of it, but a boatfull of hops doesn't make for the complex beer described on the label. Good, but a disappointment compared to some of the other 3 Floyds beers I've had."
"So I was in one of the better beer stores around town and I see that a case of Three Floyds hadn't been put on the shelves yet, and the guy who owns the store said something like ""yeah we got their dark sun stout."" I got excited hoping that he meant to say Dark Lord, but alas, found this in the box instead. No matter, at this price from this brewery, it must be something at least close to the Dark Lord. I was surprised when I looked it up at home to see that I payed 10 bucks for a 5.2 percent dry stout. Ahh well. Anyway, 22 oz. bottle with an awesome label and a blurb about the beer that could easily be typed into this website as a review. As I pour the beer, it looks fairly viscous and settles into the glass a black with ruby tinges, and a half-inch of yellow/brown head that leaves some lacing. It smells like fruity hops at first, followed by chocolate, coffee, and notes of vanilla. The flavor follows suit with additional notes of roasted malts, raisins and other fruits, and leafy/green/citric hops. The body isn't as thick as the label implies - I'd say it's medium bordering on thick, but still feels nice. I didn't really believe it to be a dry stout until the end, as the American hops remind me of an American stout, but I'm sure there's an Irish back there somewhere. Overall it's a quality beer, but way too expensive for what it is."
"This beer poured as black as midnight and formed a huge foamy dark tan head that coated the glass with lace as it slowly subsided. No light will penetrate this murky mess. The aroma is light, with elements of malt, hops and some burnt oats to it. The flavor was of burnt malts, hops and some burnt coffee. The body is light, but what you would expect of the style with a nice creaminess to it."
"Inky black with faint ruby highlights at the edges. The dense brown head left sheets of fine bubbles stuck to the sides of the glass and showed good retention. Initially, there was an intense piney hop aroma that I could pick up from across the table. After this subsided a bit, dark malts were more evident - some roast and chocolate with a burnt edge. Bitterness was balanced with the malt and seemed to grow as the beer warmed. There was a pleasant dry roastiness, almost a mild coffee flavour, that played well against the piney hops. Grapefruit appeared for a moment towards the finish. Hops really made up the majority of the flavour profile. Fine carbonation contributed to a round body and silky texture. Another interesting offering from 3F. Thanks Viggo!"
"Drinkability: Great session beer, low abv, and not filling. A delicious treat on a cold winters night. Another fine offering from Three Floyds thats highly recommended."
"If not, give this one a try."
"Notes: This is a solid, very drinkable beer. Very tasty and suited for session style drinking. I would love to see this one added to Three Floyd's year round products!"
"I like this beer, but I like most of their beers"
"Very disappointed, I paid $8.99 for the bottle and I want my money back."
"Served in an imperial pint glass at the 3F's BP. A large tan head sat on top of a black body. Coffee, roasted malts and chocolate malts dominate followed closely by some American citrus hops. Good lacing follow the body down the glass. Chocolate and coffee and roasted malts are in the lead with a balance of more hop bite. A nice roasted after-taste in the finish along with some hops. Drinkability is great but I kinda wish it actually had less carbonation. Keep in mind that this is now OFF nitro so its not as creamy as some other reviews in the past couple of weeks."
"Another easily drinkable brew from 3F. I dunno how you even put a style label on this beer, it's no Irish dry stout but it's damn good."
"good looking stout. balck, some lacing, 1/8 inch head maintained throughout the drinking period. Slight odor of grapefruit in amongst the expected maltiness. Bitter malt flavor, some chocolate (like baking chocolate). fairly smooth mouthfeel, nothing amazing but drinkable for sure."
"Drinkability: Dam this beer is good. Very well balanced between malty goodness and piney hops. I want some more."
"Drinkability- Not bad at all. Wasn't sure I was going to like it after the smell, but I guess it's what it's supposed to smell like, so I can't complain or down rate it because of that. Tasty and for sure interesting. Would buy again."
"I usually love everything from 3 F's, but this just doesn't work for me. I think this choice of chocolate, coffee, and piney flavoring hops isn't a good combination. Something is really odd in this beer. I probably would not get it again."
"22 ounce bottle. Thanks beerinator!"
"Bomber bottle, w/o freshness indication. Pours dark muddy brown, fine and slight dark tan head, leaves very fine lacing. Milk chocolate nose, lots of chocolate, coffee, burnt grains, some smoke, dried fruits. Tasty, thick, complex and gooey stuff. Grainy hops late. Lucious, silky and smooth mouthfeel. Yum"
"Drinkability is good. Nice stout that I can't wait to get into again."
"Personally, I think I prefer the Alpha Klaus, but only by a hair's breadth. My friend murrayswine likes his beers to be hoppy and unbalanced, and so prefers the Black Sun. Either way, though, you can't really go wrong. Two damn fine beers."
"D- With each sip that amazing smell of floral hops is wonderful but the taste doesn't follow through with the hops. The malt bill is very smooth and drinkable and the bitter hops do nicely in balancing the malt. Very smooth drinking beer but the aroma makes me want a hop monster."
" I love the beers from FFFs, and pay top dollar for all of them. Some, like Dreadnaught, Dark Lord, Behemouth, etc., are worth it. At around $9 a bomber, this beer is unique enough to warrant the price tag."
"Definitely not what I expected on first whiff. On pouring it smelled like it just opened a bag of fresh hops. Not that citrusy/piney IPA hop smell, but just fresh hops. There isn't much else in the mild aroma; possibly a bit burnt toast, but that's about it. Poured a small, dense, chestnut colored head that fades slowly leaving some nice lace. Pitch black beer allows a few ruby rays to escape. The interesting hoppyness carries over into the flavor balancing out the cocoa, coffee, and dark malt flavors. I don't know the hop variety, but I definitely like this one. I'd say it's an American Dry Stout, and pass me another."
"This is a stout IPA. Interesting, but not what I wanted in a stout. In a different category Black IPA? I liked it, but I would go for it if I was in a hoppy mood and wanted a change from the standard IPA. Interesting, but a bit expensive. Storm King minus the alcohol and more hops... (not quite as good...)"
"D - Very high, a beer this smooth, an with an ABV that isn't too deep at all, I wouldn't mind taking a few of these down. A very nice release from 3F that I would like to see as a regular brew."
"Mouthfeel is big, nice and chewy with a good amount of carbonation. I find myself working through this one at quite a fast pace. It's just so damn tasty it's hard to put the glass down. I would have no problem drinking this all night long. Very glad to see this one finally bottled in bombers again. This is a must try brew and another winner from the Floyds. Picked this up at the brewpub for $8/bomber."
"22 oz bomber, first I'd ever seen it, the usual sweet art work that's expected from 3Fs, I had no choice but to pick it up. Pours an opaque black, no light coming through even on the bottom, with just a thing ring of beige head, some spotty lacing. Smell is strong green fresh hops, grapefruit and citrus, excellent green smell, with just a slight hint of chocolatety malt lurking around in the background. Taste is more of the same, a big juicy grapfruit hops, a slight mocha and roasted flavor, more green grassy hops lingering into the finish. Mediumbodied with a fairly low carbonation level, this is a really easy drinker. Like it's cousin the Alpha Klaus, this takes a traditional dark roasted beer and amps up the hops to a level of domination, and just like that beer I absolutely love it."
"Incredibly easy to drink, this is a stout only in color. A very extreme interpretation of the style, but damn if it aint tasty and inviting."
"ng"
"A very drinkable stout."
"(Tasted this beer at the Blind Tiger's Three Floyds event)"
"I had this beer on tap at a local restaurant. Pours a dark jet-black color with a thick and creamy tan froth. Head retention is great, it lasted until the last drop, leaving a sticky lace on the glass. The aroma was full of dark roasted malt, hops, coffee, and dark chocolate. The taste is very well balanced. The hops are very apparent, as is the malt. There was just a perfect balance of coffee and chocolate at the end. This is an exceptionally smooth and easy drinking stout with moderately dry finish. Seek it, find it, drink it, love it"
"And malt flavors. The smell of the hops reminded me of their Alpha King. The taste was good and it had a nice bitterness. Light to medium bodied. Not that heavy tasting. Very enjoyable and drinkable."
"When received at my end of the bar the first thing I noticed was how perfect this glass of beer looked. A small thick full and creamy head sitting on top of glass of black gold. The color of the beer was jet black where no light was able to penetrate. The head was (like I said above) thick, creamy, and tan in color, long lasting and slowly diminished with each sip that I took. The lace was more like a full rich, sticky blanket that was draped over the inside of the glass. The aromas that came from the insides were at first slightly perfumey in nature, but that left very fast, as the other aromas quickly took over. Smells of coffee, bitter chocolates, floral hops, ash, roasted malt and wood, charcoal, and hop leafs (raw, and dried) this smell was very dominant. The tastes were rich and mouth filling. They were of hop flowers/leafs, rich coffee, floral hops, some bitter chocolate, some ash, roasted malts and more hops. This beer left a hoppy dry finish in the mouth and across the tongue, kind of reminded me of having a little pinch of hops between the cheek and gums. Very rich and it is a good beer. Totally different then there other stout that I had, the Dark Lord. Another winner from the 3 Floyds."
"A big, roasty stout that (of course, being Three Floyds) has a very healthy amount of hops. A little more body than a Guinness stout, but not quite an Imperial-style stout either. Too thin for that designation. This is a stout for those beer drinkers who like their beer dark, roasty and very hoppy. Something akin to a Sierra Nevada Stout."
"I keep telling myself... ""they're not normal..."" and this is not by any means a normal stout... It looks normal enough: opaque and black with a thin but persistent head, and a beautiful lace all the way down the glass. The aroma is the first clue that there is something different here. Chocolate, coffee, pine, and citrus heavily hopped. The flavor begins with coffee, and finishes with pine some notes of chocolate quite a bit of bitterness. Very dry and smooth but thin for a stout. The hops seem a little out of whack it could use a little balance. Even though I love some of the beers that Three Floyds puts out, sometimes normal is ok."
