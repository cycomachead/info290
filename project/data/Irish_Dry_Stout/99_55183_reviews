"below the increasing quality of recent saranac beers this one, a thin and slightly off irish stout, not as dry as it should be, lacking any meaty body, and frankly just not all that appealing. lighter brown for the style, more of a brown ale really or a light porter than a true irish stout in looks. and the flavor is similarly watered down, the body is real thin, and there is a peculiar metallic bitterness all the way through it. i may be a little biased as this was my last beer in an evening of several world class ones, but i was still let down by this seemingly lazy offering. anyone who sips this notices inadequacies right away, namely the lack of body, but also the longer semi sweet finish, the minimal carbonation, and the partially oxidized taste in the finish. saranac has really been coming out with some top notch stuff lately, inventive and well executed, but this is the worst ive had from them in some time, and is probably at least part of the reason true beer geeks keep bashing this brand. barely passable as the style it proclaims to be, just a bit better as a dark ale, but not one i need to try again for awhile."

"Notes: A decent looking glass of ""Irish"" stout despite the lack of nitrogen (well, that was only developed in the '60's or something anyway, right?). Brilliant lacing and better-than-very-good head retention. ""Black"" body, dark tan head. Aroma: roast. beer. slightly nutty. I'm getting more out of it than Guinness. Flavor: similar to aroma. some twang. minor maltiness. balanced bitterness. surprisingly well put together. no flaws, other than the fact that the style itself isn't exactly ""rounded"" or ""balanced"". Finishes dry and subtly tangy and roasty. Overall, impressive. There are a lot of breweries that have taken a stab at the style, and many have missed the mark - not Saranac."

"Overall an easy drinking beer that works well in this mix pack to provide some variation. Wouldnt seek it out on its own but is one of the quickest to go in the pack."
""

"Overall - Decent, very smooth and drinkable. Would like a little more hop bitterness since this beer is a tad more sweeter and then most irish stouts. A little weak in flavor overall but still enjoyable."
"This looks a bit better than it tastes, but it's not super underwhelming. The smell is roasted malt through and through, but still doesn't jump out at you. The taste is basically the same in the roasted department, but adds a piney bitterness to it. Also, interestingly enough, the drink is dry, but it's also slightly watery. I wouldn't get this again by itself, although I did enjoy it."

"poured into mug . pours dark and thick looking. nice amount of head that fades quickly. light caramel aroma with chocolate and booze. flavor has a bit of bacon, ashy, a little hoppy, a bit of a wet finish. has a nice bite to it . its a bit harsh with alcohol burn for such a low percentage"

"O: A great dry stout should be dry AND substantial...this is just dry. As a Guinness alternative, this is solid; as an alternative to other craft stouts, this comes up short."

"Overall, it is a tasty brew, but seems more of cross between dry stout and american stout."

"A fairly dry, roasty beer, with lots of malt dominance. There's a bit of an acrid character that is a touch offputting."
""
""
""

"Overall: Good beer to have, wouldn't replace my usual Irish stouts but definitely not a disappointment. Salud!"

""

"This was a basic Dry Stout. I was a little taken back by just how thin the body was. It seemed on the edge of almost being a Schwarzbier with some extra dryness."
""

"notes: fun, easy to drink, a winner for Matt Brewing, IMO."
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark brown-to-black coloring with light brown highlights around the edges and a thin, sparse, light tan coating on the surface. Aromas of mocha coffee, with a slight sugary ribbon to the chocolate character, and a touch of earthy characteristics. Flavors of roast and char initially, with a slick, bitter coffee backbone quickly following. Some bitter chocolate highlights, but not as much as the nose would lead you to believe. Aftertaste is rich chocolate and coffee, with a strong bitter undertone. Light, dry body with a slick, quick finish. True to the style, but a little more chocolatey and rich than you may be used to. Tasty."

"O: This beer has two things working against it coming out of the gate: First, it's an Irish Dry stout, a style of beer that most Americans don't seem to understand or appreciate. Second, it's brewed by Saranac, a brewery that doesn't get a lot of love and has a reputation in the craft world for underachieving and making mediocre beer. For these reasons, I don't expect it to get a lot of love. That would be a damn shame though, because this is an excellent beer. In fact, this is one of the best examples of the style I've had to date. Attractive mouthfeel, highly drinkable, very tasty and textbook for the style; it's everything you could ever want. A case might be in order next St. Patrick's Day."

"Overall- A solid Irish stout. Great balance of roasted malts and the bitterness of the hops."

"Overall: A real good example of the style very smooth and easy drinkability"
"O - Decent stout. Probably will have again in the future"
"very dark brown, basically black with no light shining through on this one at all. Rich looking head of tan on the top hung around for most of the session. The aroma was a bit light. Lots of roasted malts, with just a hint of cocoa underneath it. Really dry taste, but a little bland for me. Light cocoa and roasted malts, but it lacked alot of depth to put it over the top into another cateogory. Still though it was a decent little stout with a nice feel, and a 5.5 percent very drinkable. Not sure I would go here again though."
"This beer poured out as a nice looking dark brown color. It's almost black in color. The head was a nice creamy looking tan color and left a decent lacing. The smell of the beer had the musty earthy roasted aromas going on. The taste was nicely toasted and left a pretty nice bitterness behind. The mouthfeel was a little thin. Overall I feel that the beer was decent, the body could have been a bit darker, it was almost see through. Just about everything was mediocre but drinkable."
"D - This is my first offering from the Matt Brewing Company. It's a solid Irish Dry Stout but perhaps not the perfect example of the style. Certainly worth a try and I'm glad I got my hands on it."
"O: Can't go wrong with this beer especially for the price. Done very well for the style as well."
"Not sure on the age of this, but it still seems ok to me. Maybe not for long though. Probably a little better fresher."
"Black with red to dark amber highlights and a one finger head. Smells chocolatey with no real hop presence as expected for style. Pretty dry from begining to end. Roasty but not smokey. Taste lingers just long enough. A little thin for the style but that didn't bother me so much because that made it more of a hot weather stout which is quite appropriate at the time of this review. I'd get it again."
"Good inexpensive beer, which I would buy definitely again."
"O - This was a surprisingly good Irish Stout. I'd get some more for a good, inexpensive, sessionable stout."
"A sweeter version of a dry Irish stout. Black body with a creamy head. A whiff of smoke. Not so dry, and in fact a decent tastiness and drinkability. Half decent mouthfeel, a tad watery and a bit of caramel to give it some feel. If stuck, I would have it again. Thanks Radek."
"Overall this is a very nice enjoyable stout that I would definately buy again."
"Overall I loved this beer and give it an A minus. I compare it to a Guiness Stout, but a much better price and it is brewed locally here in NY."
"O-maybe I was ruined by the Guinness Foreign Extra Stout, but this is ok at best."
"D - Very drinkable. Nice balance of smooth and creamy elements. The flavor is nicely balanced and not too weak. Overall a pretty enjoyable beer."
"It's St Patrick's day, so what better to review than an Irish Stout. Poured pitch black into a Perfect Pint glass. A foamy cream head has good retention and leaves bits of lace. The hyper fizzy body masks the flavors a bit. Letting the beer breathe helps calm things down. Flavors are not that great to me. Bitter coffee is the theme here. Roasted flavors dominate, but aren't helped by much else. Things get acidic in the finish. Overall, this didn't do it for me. There are better stouts out there."
"Overall - Considering the trainwreck that the Imperial Stout is, I was skeptical trying this one out. I was very pleasantly surprised by how well done this one is by Saranac. Its not overly chocolately like many American micros and seems to have a trueness to the Irish stout authentisty with well balance and not going over the top like us yank brewers tend to do. Nice job Saranac!"
"O: The beer is very easy to drink and packs in quite a bit of flavor."
"D: Good drinkability and def could drink a few."
"The feel of this beer is dry and medium bodied with a nice smooth finish and a great light aftertaste that is there for a short time then is gone."
"12oz bottle purchased as part of the ""What Ales You"" mixed 12pk. Pours a black body with dark brown highlights. Smells like a Guinness - dark chocolate, roast, with a tinge of sourness. Tastes very much like Guinness too - roasty, dark chocolate and espresso notes, with nut and caramel notes in the background. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Not bad. Spot-on for the style for sure. A tastier and cheaper domestic alternative to Guinness products and the like."
"D- A decent stout. Worthy of a try but not anything particularly world class."
"Not as strong in flavor as a Sierra Nevada stout, but does have its own set of rewarding characteristics, making it a worthy brew for any stout lover."
"Cheers!"
"D: It is one of the smoother drinkable stouts that I have had. I would drink three of four in a night. I would like to see what this on tap at the brewery could offer."
"Like any Saranac, these are worth drinking, if they are a good value."
"This is one of Saranac's better offerings and a great take on a lesser loved style."
"decent drinkability"
"D - basically if you were to compare it to Guinness, I'd describe it as essentially the taste of Draught with (almost) the body of Extra. a nice middle ground. will buy this again"
"Coffee flavors up front, then carbonation hits in the back with some bitter spice notes followed by a chocolate coating, then finishing dry with a hint of anise."
"Appearance is that of a solid black, may seem even more so than Guinness but not as creamy looking. Very little head. Smells of mild toasted malt and mild chocolate and espresso. Taste is actually drier (like the style suggests) than expected but full of roasted malt and mild coffee. Mild hops help this beer finish creamy. Mouthfeel is pretty medium bodied and drink ability is also very good since I love stouts. A very solid brew."
"12 oz bottle. Pours dark brown with a thick, long lasting, tanned head. Nose is of dark fruit and roasted malt. Medium, very sharp body. Roasted malt, some dark fruit and some off sour notes fill the mouth. Long, espresso like finish. So, so stout as everything from Saranac."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a pretty decent mild stout that is worth drinking for a long time if you're in the mood for the style."
"At this point, it's unlikely that The Matt Brewing Company will surprise me in either direction. Irish Stout is a serviceable Irish dry stout that was worth a single bottle purchase. A second bottle? No thanks."
"Decent stout, above average I would say. I would drink this again. Maybe too heavy to drink a lot of though."
"Pretty drinkable, very similar to SA Cream Stout. Doesn't have the drinkability of other Irish dry's like Guinness, though."
"Drinkability: Could have two or three of these. One of Saranac's better offerings. Nice, dry, and true to style."
"D- pretty drinkable. A lot like Guinness without the body"
"It's a very approachable stout. There are no overwhelming flavors that would turn someone away."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a small head. Smell is of malts and coffee. Taste is like the smell, roasted malts and coffee. Feels full bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this makes for a fine quality beer."
"D - the smokey flavor makes this a very different brew worth drinking."
"One of these is enough I love a good stout but this one is taken over completly by its bitter taste."
"Overall I thought I was going to be more impressed with this one. However, if you are a fan of Irish beer or Irish stouts, I would say give this one a dry. It has a little less alcohol by volume than I expected (in the 6 % range). I bought a six pack of this and I probably wouldn't buy it again."
"Dark ebony with a whipped creamt tan head that melts slowly leaving sheets of lace on the glass. The nose is good. Black malt and coffee roastiness. The flavor is spot on for the style, rich roasty black malts with a dry coffee like bitterness in the finish. Light bodied and slightly chalky with a dry finish. Slightly harsh carbonation is the only minor complaint. A pretty good version of the style."
"An easy drinker, although you can do better. Much better than some of the brewpub I've had from the tap. An easy drinker for sure and nice to use as a comparison to others. Middle of the road, but actually ok."
"Drinkability: Rates high. Certainly more flavorful than Guinness but lacks the creamy mouthfeel that is expected for the style. Still quite good."
"Smooth and creamy with a lighter body than many would suspect. Very drinkable Irish Stout from a perennial favorite brewery of mine."
"Notes: Overall this was good solid dry stout. I am a fan of Saranac but this one still surprised me. I would take this over a Guinness Draught any day!"
"D - Not bad. Not hefty, so quite sessionable for a dry stout."
"Ok, but very mediocre at best. Will not buy again"
"D - Sits like an Irish stout would and should. Pretty solid take on this style by Saranac. There's room for improvement in the general body, but nothing to sweat over."
"Overall a very good DIS. I wish this was a year round offering as I fear I enjoyed one of the last kegs around. in any event, it is good to see a Saranac beer of tap on Long Island, as they are few are far between."
"Happy St. Patricks's Day!"
"d: A nice drink, again maybe not as dry per style, but then again I think it plays to its advantage drinkability wise giving this a juicy and sweet flair on the tongue that gave me incentive towards the next sip. I could drink a few of these no problem and think matt did a good job."
"Picked up a case from Shangy's for $25 and shared it with friends around St. Pat's Day. Saranac did a good job of brewing a tasty Guinness-like beer, but I've had better Irish stouts. While there's a respectable sour/bitter tang, I would have liked more roast and chocolate flavor. I'm not saying it needed a lot. I'm just saying there was hardly any. Still, for the price it's totally worth trying if you like stouts."
"I wish it were a bit more complex in the malt taste. I am stretching it a bit, pulling all sorts of things out of its simple roasted taste. I could see this being better with slight hints of caramel, vanilla and dark chocolate. Through and through this is a highly drinkable and simple stout."
"not as creamy-perfect as you know what, but quite similar. this has a little more 'bite' but still quite mellow and drinkable. carbonated to keep it a bit more crisp than expected (in a nice way), but still smooth and creamy. i like the snappy bite on the finish. a bit sour. a very drinkable stout that adds something different enough to stand out."
"D: I could drink a few of these."
"D) An alright stout."
"Pours a very dark, nearly opaqe brown with about a finger of tan foamy head that leaves a bit of soapy lacing behind. The nose is light coffee, toffee, and dark wheat. The taste follows straightforwardly, with the coffee taking a darker turn and placing itself further toward the van, while the dark malts and wheat march in step behind. The finish features a slight cranberry flavor, not unlike the finish you'd find from a Guinness. The body is decidedly medium, with a good amount of carbonation and a smooth, dry texture. Overall, a solid, if somewhat ordinary, stout with a high level of drinkability."
"Consumed: 3/8/2010"
"overall - good beer probably best one Ive tasted from the saranac variety pack."
"Pours a deep brown color with a 2 finger and strong tan head, a very nice looking stout. Some roasted grain, chocolate, cream soda, sweetened coffee and that standard Saranac musty aroma in the nose. Light in body with a semi creamy almost buttery texture, chocolate and roasted malt a slight bitterness late palate does its job into the finish. No complaints with this one here, this may be my new favorite Saranac offering. Very drinkable, absolutely sessionable, thought the Irish Red was good, another very strong seasonal effort from Saranac."
"The beer pours a dark black color with a 1/2"" tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry and creamy black malt scent that's earthy and coffee like. The taste is good as well. It has a stiff black malt bitterness that's dry and earthy. It goes down smooth and relatively light and finishes bone dry with a creamy coffee feel. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a solid Irish stout. It's not gonna blow you away, but it's true to style and damn drinkable."
"Notes: I bought the ""What Ales You"" 12-pack after grabbing a sixer of this and putting it back. Wishing now I'd bought that six-pack and had more than one remaining. Might just be the best Saranac beer I've had as far as nailing the style goes."
"The lacing was mediocre at best, but this was a very good stout that was very drinkable. I recommend trying this beer if you like stouts as this is spot on for this style. Another solid addition to the Saranac seasonal collection."
"A friend brought a 12 mix pack over for the USA/CAN hockey game. The Irish Stout was the first one I grabbed, as I don't think I've tried this one before. Poured into a standard pint glass. Dark brown color. Nice fluffy white head. Good amount of lacing. A great start to the first beer of the day from Saranac. Smell had a hint of milk chocolate. Taste was great, as it was dry and crisp, but also had a bit of sweetness of cocoa powder and sugary coffee. Not as thick as some stouts, but had enough body to satisfy me. Easy to drink, with a good mouthfeel and a moderate abv. I'd buy this for any St Patty's day if it came in six packs."
"Deep dark appearance, it does let some ruby highlights through when held toward the light. Tan khaki head builds up and lasts for a quite a few minutes before dwindling. After my fist sip even layers of fine lacing form and continue to trend after each sip. Aromatics are coming with the dark roasted malts, bringing out coffee and dark chocolate tones. Nothing about it is overbearingly sweeet, maybe a slight sour mash and an herbal hop presence. Flavor has iced coffee like presence, with herbal hops and a hint of chicory. Dark dry baker's chocolate and a tart sour dough finish. This is an excellent dry Irish Stout, I'm glad FX Matt attempted this. Drinkability is solid I hope to see full sixers of this, god knows we love the pricing of their beers especialy in WV."
"pours a very dark brown color with a quarter inch tan head that faded to a ring and a modest lace. smell was light and slightly sweet of roasted malt. nice roasted malt flavor with a slightly bitter finish. good carbonation and light to medium body. a lighter version of a guinness extra stout. would be a good session beer for me."
"Cheers!"
"This is a pretty good Irish stout from Saranac. Would like it to have a bit more roasted character, which is overshadowed on the tongue by the hoppiness of the beer. A touch out of balance but not too shabby by any means."
"Drinkability was the best thing about this beer (besides the bottle of course). At 5.5%, SIS is a little higher ABV than this style usually tops out at. With that being said, it is still very drinkable."
"MF&D - Medium bodied and creamy. Went down well, I would have this one again."
"Matt Brewing did well with the Saranac Irish Stout!"
"Even mouthfeel, not too full, a bit tingly and tannic. Tasty beer, pretty drinkable."
"All things considered, I think this is excellent. Only loses a couple points in the head retention department."
"Really felt the need to review this beer as I was surprised by this solid offering from Saranac. Their High Peaks line is quite good, but everything else to me has been quite average. This Irish Stout surprised me in all regards. The color is pitch black, with only a thin amount of head on top holding in a slight coffee/nutty scent. The taste is of toasted barley and coffee, and is balanced extremely well. The carbonation is barely there in the mouth, as I like my stouts. What is truly great is the drinkability. The fourth beer is just as tasty as the first. What will put this above other stouts for me is the price. Easily as good as other crafts that are $4 more per six pack."
"Style wise, overall a decent effort from Saranac. I'll give it another shot, but won't actively seek it out."
"Drinkability- A well balanced brew with no overpowering flavours, everything I would expect of a beer in this style. The medium to light body and sheer silkiness of this beer lead to the ability to drink several of these in one sitting. I enjoy what Saranac has done in creating this generic but very drinkable, well made, tasty brew."
"Drinkability: For a stout this is very drinkable. Not as heavy as others but it is a good beer to have to warm up with during the winter."
"Overall, a bit light-bodied and thin, but tasty and very drinkable"
"Overall- A bit light but creamy and easy to drink."
"Easy to drink."
"Picked this brew up for a try, new offering from Saranac. In the past been hit and miss with the new releases so was not sure what to expect. Poured to nice black color and if held to a light source you get some dark ruby color. Has a nice medium tan colored head, quite creamy, great legs and tons of lacing. The aroma comes off more roasted and toasted than burnt with a slight sweet scent, lactose? Overall a excellent aroma coming from this one. The flavor is excellent, while not complicated it has a nice roasted malts flavor, very faint astringent note, slight sweetness in the middle. Has a similar profile probably from the yeast that I get in the other offering from Saranac. That flavor works here in some of the other brews it does not. Again this one is not overly complicated, but it works extremely well for a sessional brew. Slight watery but I feel the same about most of the major Irish Dry Stouts. Now I might be called crazy but for me this brew was just as good as the Guinness or Murphy's I have had, actually like the consistence of this one better ... maybe this is me being a homer. I must say that some of the Saranac offerings have been lack luster as of late but this one is very good IMO."
"D: I would say I could def drink this often. Tastes like the typical Irish stout. Plus with its price you can't go wrong."
"Although I feel that this is better than Saranac's Mocha Stout, Oatmeal Stout, or Vanilla Stout (I've never tried their traditional stout)... I would still suggest either their Imperial Stout or Black & Tan over this."
"Saranac Irish Stout is a solid black ale with a foamy, tan head that has excellent retention and lacing. It has a toasty and malty aroma that seems a touch sweet. It's medium-light bodied, a little bubbly, dry and crisp with a clean finish. It's a pretty mellow flavor that's well balanced. It tastes a little roasty and the finish is pretty green. It's a decent session beer."
