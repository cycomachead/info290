Smells and tastes of lightly roasted malt, a bit of dark coffee and chocolate, all the usual suspects, but doesn't really promote any of them as aggressively as it could to make it more memorable amongst other Irish Dry Stouts. Although the body is light, crisp and clean in execution, it also seems at time to be as thin as the flavor within. I'd call it a good beginner's introduction to their first Dry Stouts, it's just not quite as complex as others, but that makes it accessible.","WastingFreetime","Aug 03, 2012"

Taste of big roasted malt, milk chocolate, and caramel; with light coffee and vanilla. Some noticeable bitterness on the finish, with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, and vanilla on the finish for a short period of time. Still quite dry as would be expected. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice smooth mouthfeel with tons of creaminess. No alcohol noticed at all in the taste or finish as expected. Overall, this is the best dry stout I have ever had.

Really dry taste, but a little bland for me. Light cocoa and roasted malts, but it lacked alot of depth to put it over the top into another cateogory.

Taut and wiry nose, hits you with it, but it is indeed a punch, cocoa to malted milk balls, lighter caramel, orange peels, the hops have a subtle aggressiveness and pine and grass appear in uncommon percentage, plum, black grape, cherry fruit scents thick enough to anchor things, doe snot appear fashioned to gently soak in, no love handles. Full-bodied with a muscular enough structure to keep things limber and nimble with the added weight. Cocoa, dark chocolate nibs, coffee, hard toffee, the orange citrus a very dry zest, leads swiftly into pine sap and tea leaf accents. The carbonation has a finely granular character while still bringing a fair degree of fluff. Smokiness builds sip after sip, with it a semi-bitter nuttiness. Lots of elements, not so much harmony.

T: Strong character of smoky peat and slightly acrid grains and a medicinal composition up front with an incredibly dry, clean disappearing finish. MF: Excellent, coats the palate without being overpowering, allows for lingering transition between the assertive first punch and the phantom finish. D: Very high for a dry stout. More complexity that many dry Irish stouts without affecting the drinkability. Each sip begs to be followed by another as the evaporative character leaves the drinker wanting yet another imbibition. Very good stuff, I would love to sample this on draft or dare I say it, on cask. Not nearly as sessionable as a Guinness, Murphy's or Beamish, nor should it be.

The taste generally follows, with those coffee nots dominating and the dark fruits pushed all the way back to the finish (and there joined by some red berries as well).

3.9,2.6,4,4,4,3,4,"Taste is also a big different. Moylan's retains that deep roasted bitterness of mild coffee and slightly phenolic spiciness and virtually no hop profile to speak of. The mouthfeel is lacking though, rather watery and feels undercarbonated feel where there should be a thicker, more substantial body. Black Sun has a fuller, more substantial and chewy mouthfeel which places it a step above Moylan's, but the flavor profile is again off from the style. Licorice and a slight chocolatly sweetness mixes with an undercurrent of estery fruitiness. I am going to have to give the edge to Moylan's on this taste test that wasn't even that blind thanks to the huge amount of hops in Black Sun. Moylan's tastes more like an Irish Stout should while the Black Sun tastes a bit too sweet for my tastes.","bluemoonswoon","Dec 24, 2008"
4.74,24.7,4,5,5,4,4.5,"Dark brown nearly black pour with a decent sized dark brown head. Has a smoky and peppery coffee aroma and has a dense taste that is mainly coffee but also some pepper and is layered with a very dry finish at the end.

3.9,2.6,4,4,4,3,4,"The drink is on the light side of medium bodied but is somewhat overly carbonated. A distracting wave of stinging bubbles greets the palate at each swig, but the net effect is that the drink is quite refreshing.","cvstrickland","Beers"
4.38,15.3,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"From a 22oz bottle purchased locally. Jet black with a good tan head. Aroma is coffee and dark chocolate with a little fruity fig in there. Flavor is dry, with more chocolate in there. Roast flavor is restrained and bitterness balances. Carbonation is not to high, although it could be less. Smooth, creamy dry and balanced. This is a great example of an Irish Dry Stout made in the US. More micros need to make these.","Brewsmith","0"

4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"One of the best Dry Irish Stouts I've ever had. Pours black with a very short tan head. Mild aroma of roasted chocolate malt and cereal. Delicious taste that is balanced well. Coffee, chocolate, cream, smoke, and vanilla are all there and compliment each other without drowning out the flavor. The hops balance the sweetness and give it the dry bite and finish. Excellent.","magictrokini","Nov 16, 2008"

4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Very dark, just short of black, with mahogany edges that showed a bit of a ruby tint. A one finger mocha cap was generated by a very hard pour, a mixture of fine and soapy bubbles that left considerable clumpy lacing stuck to the glass. Good head retention. Very roasty aroma, some coffee and burnt notes, with faint toffee and dry cocoa. Mild bitterness stayed beneath the malt and roast flavours, but remained solid throughout. It started out with sweet malts, some caramel and roast. Light grassy hops appeared mid-sip and grew into a finish that was balanced with lingering roast and toffee with a hint of vanilla and sour cherry thrown in as well. A bit dry with controlled astringency from the dark malts. The body was on the lighter side, firmly entrenched between medium and light. Carbonation was certainly on the low side, but remained lively enough to keep it from feeling dull. Nice texture overall. Quite a good stout, easy drinking with a little added malt and hop complexity plus a little more body than you normally see with the style. Good stuff.","DrJay","Oct 12, 2008"

Fluffy body, a bit of cherry funk and lemon skin bitterness, roasted caramel malt but there is subtle hints of coffee and chocolate as well. Almost tart cherry, vanilla flavor, a bit thin on the body, no chew. It honestly more sweet than anything, there's no drying alcohol heat or intense tongue numbing bitterness.

5,31.6,5,5,5,5,5,"As an Irish American I have a soft spot in my heart for stouts and other similar beers. One of the reasons I am a craft beer lover today is because of all those pints of Guiness I had to choke down and pretend I liked to keep up apperances. Until one day I actually liked the stuff. The rest is mostly history. First off Moylans is an execellent brewery. They make top notch beer. Usually bottled versons of Irish stouts just dont work very well, but in this case it really dose. Somehow they managed to put a smooth, creamy and dry stout in a bottle without all the high tech gadgetry you may find in other examples. The colour is black. The head is thick and tan. The armoa is rich with coffee and chocolate, but subdued. The flavour is roasty, chocolaty, earthy and smooth. It has a very mild bitterness so there is some sweetness but that just adds a layer of complexity. Not nearly as dry as say Guiness, nor is the body as light. Still I would say it fits nicely into the Irish stout category. I really like this beer and highly recommend it. Oh yeah its only 5% ABV so like other dry stouts it makes an awsome session beer.","mjryan","Jul 28, 2008"
3.48,-8.4,4,3.5,4,2,3,"I am a bit surprised to say it, but this is actually probably better on Nitro, or preferably from the hand pump; the reduced carbonation and carbonic acidity would really help to keep this beer more balanced. And the beer does actually smooth out, become more integrated and not as overtly roasted if I vigorously swirl out the carbonation; serving this on the warm side certainly helps too. Not exactly the best beer to be drinking out of the bottle, if you work at it you can turn this into a nicely drinking beer though. I would love to have this served via hand pump from a cask at about 59°F / 15°C.","Gueuzedude","Jul 03, 2008"

A little bit darker than Guinness, with just noticeable dark brown highlights. The aroma is a dru grainhouse roasted malt with notes of very light coffee and watered down chocolate. The taste has a upfront roated malt character with a bone dry hop and dark malt middle. Te finish brings out the light brownie and coffee flavors.
