"Pretty decent Irish stout, nice uniqueness in the flavor and aroma.  It's pretty distinct.  That said, the body disappoints a bit and it's ultimately nothing special, but it does manage a robust flavor and aroma for it's abv which is impressive.  Ultimately above average and worth a try."

"For a nitro, this beer didn't quite have the creamy head or cascading effect I'd normally expect. Typcial dark brown-black color for a stout, small bubbly white head. Basic aroma of dark malts and a touch of coffee and ash. Similar taste, dark malts, moderate roastiness, coffee, burny ash, a little weak, but not too bad. Thinner than a good stout should be, about medium bodied, and decently drinkable, but just lacking in good qualities that make me want to come back for more."
"This is an okay stout. It has that kind of sour tone that some stouts can get. Decent molasses with mild roasted tones. The body seems a bit thin and the flavor profile could linger a bit more. This is an alright stout in my book, but not much beyond that."

"D - As sessionable of a stout that I've ever found... Loaded with flavor and character and weighing in only at 4.6%..."

"Pours a dark near black with red highlights, dense khaki colored creamy head, little lacing. Scent is roasty with faint notes of powdered cocoa and a little woody, spicy note. Nice dry and lightly bitter roasty quality to taste, faint notes of chocolate and coffee with some char, splash of fruity and herbaly flavors on back end. Medium bodied, dry. a highly drinkable stout but lacking in any standout notes."
"deep dark black look to it and a nice head of maybe two inches that came up and over the top with some ease. Settling down it left a decent amount of lacing on the sides, but nothing spectacular though it did retain a good bit of the puff of tan on top. The aroma was nice, well blended mix of chocolate and roasted malts, hints of light coffee notes and a decent bit of dark fruit note carrying over. This was pretty much par for the course with the flavor. Started out very smooth with a rich and well defined chocolate note that dominated early before mellowing with a nice but of vanilla and coffee notes. Small touch of hops catching up right there at the end"
"Ordered this after finishing the Barley Wine at the brewpub. This beer was dark black in color with a soapy looking tan color head. Not much lacing here and looked a little weak to me. The smell was of coffee grounds and roasted malts. The taste of the beer had a touch of chocolate in there but mostly gave off flavors of burnt coffee bitterness and some malts in the background. The mouthfeel was smooth, but a little thin in my opinion. Overall this stout isn't bad but not something that I would seek out."
"O - This was my first Susquehanna Stout and I enjoyed it...the roasted malt was everywhere...only towards the end of the glass did it get to be too much...the chocolate presence was nice"
"O - I really wanted to like this one since the base beer is one of the only beers I like from ABC but I just can't. The flavors were good but the dead look and watery feel ruined it."
"D: overall, I don't find this to be terribly drinkable. I don't really care for that ""espresso"" flavor, and I feel like this beer has a touch of peppery heat that I find to be unenjoyable. 2.5"
"Poured very dark brown with a beige head that died rather quickly. A rather subdued nose, but I gather a bit of burnt toast, biscuits, hint of floral hops, and coffee. The flavor is like the nose and also has a bit of charcoal. Moderate body, could use a boost. Carbonation is decently smooth. A very meh beer IMO."
"D: a lot like a guinness, which is good for me because I started my beer enthusiasm with the st johns gate brew. And I love to buy local so I would almost drive to the ABC to get a growler of this before I got guinness. However if I found something a little closer and american this wouldn't be missed."
"Very drinkable...a nice offering!"
"Overall this was a very good stout with a good balance of roast and sweetness. Well worth a shot."
"Overall a very tasty and clean dry stout."
"I like this stout...I like it a lot."
"Pours a very nice dark brown/black color with excellent tan head and some decent lacing. Nice scent, some burnt grain and dark malt and a lot of chocolate. Same for the taste, a nice stout with a huge chocolate flavor. Goes down quite smooth. I would've rated it higher if it would've actually supposed to have been a chocolate stout."
"D - One of ABC's finest, especially on cask. This is a very good stout with a pleasant roasty character."
"D: Overall I really enjoyed this beer. A good session beer, low abv."
"D - his is a pretty good beer that I've never heard of before its worth trying sometime if you can get some"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. I actually do not live far from the Appalachian Brewing Company, I would love to try this straight from the tap."
"D: A nice mouthfeel and taste combination that was very good. A robust roasted and coffee taste with an awesome mouthfeel. A very good, smooth Real ale."
"D- goes down very well. Very tasty bee and seems to get a bit stronger after the first half of the glass. Wouldn't drink more than 2 though."
"Very flavorful, perhaps a bit overcarbonated. Definitely dry. A good example of the style."
"If I knew where to procure this, I would."
"In the end, it was nice little brewpub dark roasted session beer. This would make for a nice choice to put in your growler."
"D- a sipping beer. Not one to pound but light on the alcohol content. hard to drink but it was a nice beer dinner. Had with pomegrante blueberry chicken."
"Flavor is some brown sugar but lots of roasted malt and hints of espresso bean roll in. The finish is roasty and again grassy hops. The hops linger a bit. No hint of ABV anywhere. I found the beer to be an easy drinker but was surprised at the hop dosage. A nice drinking brew that I could have had more of if it wasnt only lunch time."
"Flavor is very chocolaty with hints of hops and coffee. Starts with an initial spicy bitter kick of hops and espresso, then melds into rich dark chocolate, finishing dry and slightly spicy."
"D- the low carbonation makes it easy to drink despite the fact that it is not on nitro. The taste however gets a bit strong after one and I don't think more than two would be prudent. Nevertheless a very enjoyable beer, I just keep missing it on cask."
"D: Not really one of my favorites from ABC. Not an easy drinker."
"The cask pour is deep brown - nearly black - with a thin head that carries a carmel color. There are several things going on in the aroma and flavor. Mild hints of toasted almond, dark chocolate, coffee and roasted malt are present, but overall, this is a little thin. It's certainly better on cask than the draft counterpart, and my favorite in the current ABC line-up."
"D--Good beer. Good representative of the style but a little boring."
"Mouthfeel wise it was very silky and smooth. Pretty heavy stout- pretty drinkable and overall very excellent with my surf & turf!"
"n: forgive my terseness as this was written from 2 week old notes"
"This is a solid beer all around. It's simple and to the point, and having it on cask just adds to the drinkability by accenting the flavours a bit (or so it seemed to me)."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a slightly less than medium body. The carbonation is ample to the beer. The flavor and aroma of the beer are very satisfying and long lasting. This is what I wish Guiness was still like. This is a dam good beer and I will seek it out again."
"D: A good sessioner, the drier flavor is pleasant without knocking the drinker out."
"A proud beer to central PA, the Susquehanna Stout was presently wonderfully as a cask conditioned ale. A perfect aperitif to a meal at the brewpub in Harrisburg, PA."
"Simply an amazing beer on cask, warm and toasted with biscuity malts, chocolate and coffee grinds filling the air. Even thicker than usual, sort of a sludge texture but no matter as the beer more than makes up for it. Alcohol well hidden, though this isn't exactly strong beer anyway. One complaint could be the lack of aftertaste as it somehow dissapeared with a Budweiser Select style of cleaness. Overall though very satisfying, I'd have it again."
"Cheers!"
"Served at the Gettysburg ABC, in a logoed pint. The beer has a beautiful lasting head (they pour well here, I've noticed). Head is dark tan, above an opaque black liquid. Leaves some very nice lacing. Smells of slight sweet and bitter roast, and high % chocolate. Tastes very rich and creamy (even more so with the pulled pork!), moves through coffee and chocolate to a bittersweet finish. Mouthfeel is medium, with low carbonation, which lends a very nice smoothness. Very drinkable, so long as you don't rush it (I was unfortunately in a hurry to leave, and wasn't fully able to enjoy the last bits)."
"While it was nothing to crow about, I did enjoy this pint. It has a basic, malty stout character that made a decent name for itself. It was easy on the ABV, and that combined with the crisp finish made it pleasantly drinkable. It might not be something I go out of my way to track down, but I'd not hesitate ordering it again should it find its way back to me."
"Heres a solid black color with a slight chocolate-colored head. The beer presents a fairly intense coffee aroma. Its heavy on the roasted barley, with a mix of highly roasted and burnt grains. The brew is pleasingly dry, with a full smoothness and a bit of chocolate and toffee flavors. Smooth and satisfying mouthfeel, with moderately low carbonation. The brew seems to have moderately low bitterness, and a nice roasted quality in the finish. Very nice."
"Drinkability: easy to quaff, but dryness tends to tire the tongue. Definitely good for a pint."
"Quite drinkable, and the ABV makes it sessionable. A solid stout."
"This was another obsidian-colored bevvy but, unlike the porter, this had almost no head at all. I again noted the charcoal notes that I often detect in the nose of both porters and stouts. This was a very nice, dry stout and most interestingly, it was served via CO2, vice N2. This meant that the mouthfeel was less creamy that what I would normallly expect for the style. The finish left me with a lingering taste of dark chocolate. Yummy!"
"A great beer to finish off a sampler at ABC. A good solid dry Irish stout, with a nice roasty body. Another one of the fine ABC beers I'd have again."
"Pours thick and densely black. No head, just a very thin ring of lace around the edge of the glass. Aromas of chocolate, milk, toasted malts and chocolate covered cherries. Flavor is mild but enjoyable. Kind of sweet and malty, I would think this would go more into the sweet stout category. Mouthfeel is a tad spritzy for such a thick stout. However, this is certainly one I could drink a few of, and the low ABV and mild sweetness would make this a great breakfast brew."
"ABC's stout looks great. It is almost pure black with a dark tan head and loads of lacing all the way down the glass. It was, however, strangely lacking of any depth in the aroma. There was hint of roasted barley but that's about it. I usually expect to find a lot more smokiness or chocolate or caramel undertones. These were lacking. The taste was good, not great. It is a classic Irish stout as opposed to an American, Imperial, or chocolate stout. That doesn't mean it should have less flavor but this one is a little light on taste. It has the roasted barley taste that is very pleasant, but little else. It was also thinner in the mouth than most stouts. I liked it but again there are better stouts in local brewpubs not far away, Selins Grove and Bullfrog to name two."
"Pours a a deep black with some light red flashes with almost no head to speak of,hints of cedar in the aroma with some roasted malt.Taste is highly roasted with some nutty flavors and bittersweet chocolate.a nice balance of earthiness and chocolate.A appetizing beer with a nice balance of flavors a good find on tap."
"Drinkability: I try to make the rounds at the brewery, but I always come back to this one. It is very drinkable and the alcohol won't pound you into the ground."
"Served as part of a sampler tray at their brewery. From the glass, this beer looked midnight black, with a very rich and dark tan head. The aroma is appealing with roasted grains and some bittersweet chocolate. The beer is smooth and creamy and has a decent malt body. The roasted bitterness is just about perfect in this beer. Finishes dry. I enjoyed this stout very much."
"Firm black thick concoction. Rich hop aroma with chocolate malt undertones. Offwhite head slightly less creamy than should be. Nice lace. Rich and bitter is the first impression. Slightly sweet and creamy mouthfeel. Dark and roasted tasted, like dark roasted peanuts. A little dry. Tasty."
"This stout pours an opaque black with minimal head. A scant ring of caramel colored lace hugs the side of my glass at surface level. Smells like strong espresso with a hint of dark chocolate. It tastes like weak coffee though. Not very malty, rather thin overall flavor. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. If you like tepid coffee you will love this beer, but it's not for me. Thanks for the chance to try it Jarod!"
"As this beer is poured into the glass you notice how dark and robust it appears. The head is full and a rich creamy/tan color. It's lace is nice as it glides down the glass. It smell and taste are of a classic Irish dry stout. The aroma has notes of a roasted malt , coffee, barley and slight hops. The taste is creamy and smooth. The flavors that come out are roasted coffee/light chocolate, barley malt and some hops. This is a ok beer that tastes better as the temperature rises."
