"An excellent dry stout with very fine charred bread crust and malted milk ball flavors. It leaves a nice dry, slightly astringent aftertaste as the smooth malt sweetness fades away on your tongue. A great find for stout lovers."

"Pitch black beer with a creamy white head. Nose is the malt character of an RIS, but a full cocoa roundness. Hints of coffee, and the lightest minty pine from the English hops. Taste is smooth, like a nitro but not. chocolate, coffee, caramel and a full malt bill with light roast to balance out, maybe a touch of nutiness. Very dry but a round slickness that gives a sweet impression. Lightest hop at the end that lingers with the chocolate. It sticks in the nose as well. Wow, this beer far surpasses the other O'hara's I've had. What a treat and a hella price over at Tully's in wells. $2.50 a 330 bottle or something."

"So many surprise beers in so little time. Leann Folláin has the characteristics of a dry stout, yet has the flavor of an imperial stout. Excellent, excellent beer which needs to be sought out."
"O-nice dry stout with good flavor, wish it had a little more body"

"O: A lot more complexity than I expected with such a light and airy mouthfeel. Very enjoyable and easy to drink. Quite flavorful."
""
" The flavor is very coffee and biscuit from the malt up front with a slight caramel tinge in the mid palate and herbal hops add complexity in the flavor with the light mineral yeast accent and subtle smoke in the taste from the highly kilned malt delivers a nice amount of layered flavor with some light cocoa notes and wood notes with earthy elements in the background. Overall this is a very tasty stout...I didn't expect so much malt complexity but this is a topnotch example of the style. I would recommend this to any stout fan"
"Leann Follain is an excellent example of an Irish Dry Stout. It's got a bit more flavor than most Irish Dry Stouts, with the very well balanced chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt flavors mingling nicely. The flavor doesn't linger for long, leaving a nice, dry finish. Overall, a great Irish Dry Stout that's a bit stronger and more interesting than the pack."

"This review is being updated in the smell department after another try. I think I must have had a stuffed nose cause the smell on this is really amazing. The notes are the same as above, but with a creamy, sweet smell that is really excellent."
"O: This beer is really easy to drink and is quite flavorful given its light-bodied nature."

"Pairs well with Irish Beef Stew!"
"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson-brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. A foamy latticework of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, and coffee beans. Taste is much the same with cookie dough and cocoa powder flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and super easy to drink."
""
"Poured a deep dark chocolate brown with some mahogany highlights when held to the light,a frothy one finger tan colored head atop.Ton of coffee roast with some woody smokiness,pretty much like a mocha coffee.A little sharper than expected in the mouth,I would like more of a smooth creamy feel.Dry heavy roast on the palate with some bitter chocolate underneath,it has a little more ""oomph"" to it compared to others of the style.Not bad but the feel takes away from a pretty good beer."
""
""
"O: And as I finish my glass, I notice the bottle cap somehow fell down in there. How the hell did that happen?! Oh well, this a fine offering. Not great, but fine."

"Picked up on a recent trip to Dublin. Had trouble liking this one. Has good appearance and mouthfeel but that's where the goodness ends. It has an unexpectedly sharp bite, but it doesn't seem to be hoppy so I'm kind of confused where that bite comes from. It also tastes quite roasted/smokey ... sort of overpowers any other subtle flavors that might be hiding underneath."

"This was very much like a chocolate stout. Wasn't t expecting it. Tried the pale ale from this brewery and wasn't t near as nice a brew as this one. A dessert beer, no doubt. Enjoyed, will get another one for ageing."
""
"Well balanced and very drinkable for an export strength stout. I hope they can reproduce this in bottles, especially the hoppiness."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the typical style Irish dry stout (but too expensive)."
""
"Taste is excellent! After having the regular dry stout, this one is much better. Roast is exceptionally smoother than most dry stouts, an amazing feat that fades seamlessly into dark chocolate. Fruit is prevalent, but never goes overboard. Body is full without being sweet, another impressive aspect. The bitterness throws in a nice curveball too. Best 'o the O'hara bunch me thinks!"
"Overall, Leann Folláin is one of the better Irish Dry Stouts that I've tried. Its bold flavours and layered aromas make it an unusually intricate example of the style. A great brew that I would recommend to any beer geek."
"Overall, this is a fine example of the style and one that I am pleased to have tried. Will have again."
"Dr: Drinkable but not fantastic. Ignore this beer, even if you're a huge fan of the style like me. It's far too expensive for how mediocre it is."
"D - it took me a long while to drink this beer - as it was already almost at room temperature off the cask, that wasn't a problem. Not a beer I would want to have more than a pint of at a time. Definitely for savoring. The best Irish beer I had on my trip to Ireland."
"Overall: This is what Irish stouts should taste like. The best in this style that I've had. It isn't a Foreign Export, because it lacks the sourness and heavy hops, and it isn't a true Irish dry because it's a bit heavier and much more robust. Take it for what it is: one of the best beers Ireland has to offer. Recommended!"
"D- Overall the drinkability was a little hard, i would probably only have 1 and only once in awhile. I would have it again when I'm looking for a change in pace in Irish Stouts."
"D: All told, I prefer O'Hara's standard Irish stout. This is more akin to chocolate milk than I care for. Nice enough, but not recommended."
"Ok, false alarm."
"Picked this up in Sheil's off Licence on Dorset Street, Dublin for about E2.40 per bottle. Pours almost pitch black in colour with a dark brown hue on closer inspection. Head is latte in colour - settles after pouring to about a fingernail's height in the glass and is retained well. Aroma is quite complex - cocoa, coffee and malt with some burnt/roasted notes. Taste is slightly bitter with strong coffee, smoke, and dark chocolate flavours. Mouthfeel is quite dry and cleansing on the palate - goes down nicely. Very drinkable dry stout that doesn't fill you up too quickly and the 6% volume isn't too taxing. All in all, it's an excellent stout and well worth a go."
"Overall - A very good and slightly unusual example of a Irish Dry Stout... definitely worth a try..."
"Despite a relatively tam ABV, this is definitely a sipping beer, with lots of malts and roasted flavors that work toward an effective balance. All that flavor make this brew a bit tiring on the palate, but the sort of satisfying tiredness that comes after a good workout, not from boredom."
"This is a very interesting brew and certainly worth a try."
