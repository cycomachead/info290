That said, the body disappoints a bit and it's ultimately nothing special, but it does manage a robust flavor and aroma for it's abv which is impressive.  Ultimately above average and worth a try.","Cylinsier","Jul 30, 2014"

3.33,-12.8,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"For a nitro, this beer didn't quite have the creamy head or cascading effect I'd normally expect. Typcial dark brown-black color for a stout, small bubbly white head. Basic aroma of dark malts and a touch of coffee and ash. Similar taste, dark malts, moderate roastiness, coffee, burny ash, a little weak, but not too bad. Thinner than a good stout should be, about medium bodied, and decently drinkable, but just lacking in good qualities that make me want to come back for more.","Rifugium","Jul 03, 2012"
3.65,-4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This is an okay stout. It has that kind of sour tone that some stouts can get. Decent molasses with mild roasted tones.

3.8,-0.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a dark near black with red highlights, dense khaki colored creamy head, little lacing. Scent is roasty with faint notes of powdered cocoa and a little woody, spicy note. Nice dry and lightly bitter roasty quality to taste, faint notes of chocolate and coffee with some char, splash of fruity and herbaly flavors on back end. Medium bodied, dry. a highly drinkable stout but lacking in any standout notes.","rfgetz","Aug 01, 2011"
4,4.7,4,4,4,4,4,"deep dark black look to it and a nice head of maybe two inches that came up and over the top with some ease. Settling down it left a decent amount of lacing on the sides, but nothing spectacular though it did retain a good bit of the puff of tan on top. The aroma was nice, well blended mix of chocolate and roasted malts, hints of light coffee notes and a decent bit of dark fruit note carrying over. This was pretty much par for the course with the flavor. Started out very smooth with a rich and well defined chocolate note that dominated early before mellowing with a nice but of vanilla and coffee notes. Small touch of hops catching up right there at the end","mikesgroove","Jul 19, 2011"
3.25,-14.9,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Ordered this after finishing the Barley Wine at the brewpub. This beer was dark black in color with a soapy looking tan color head. Not much lacing here and looked a little weak to me. The smell was of coffee grounds and roasted malts. The taste of the beer had a touch of chocolate in there but mostly gave off flavors of burnt coffee bitterness and some malts in the background. The mouthfeel was smooth, but a little thin in my opinion. Overall this stout isn't bad but not something that I would seek out.","Knapp85","Jun 08, 2011"

3.25,-14.9,3,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Poured very dark brown with a beige head that died rather quickly. A rather subdued nose, but I gather a bit of burnt toast, biscuits, hint of floral hops, and coffee. The flavor is like the nose and also has a bit of charcoal. Moderate body, could use a boost. Carbonation is decently smooth. A very meh beer IMO.","DmanGTR","Jan 25, 2010"

4.08,6.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Flavor is some brown sugar but lots of roasted malt and hints of espresso bean roll in. The finish is roasty and again grassy hops. The hops linger a bit.

A nice drinking brew that I could have had more of if it wasnt only lunch time.","sulldaddy","Mar 09, 2008"
3.68,-3.7,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"Flavor is very chocolaty with hints of hops and coffee. Starts with an initial spicy bitter kick of hops and espresso, then melds into rich dark chocolate, finishing dry and slightly spicy.","HugoGrim","Mar 03, 2008"
3.86,1,4,3,4.5,4,3.5,"D- the low carbonation makes it easy to drink despite the fact that it is not on nitro. The taste however gets a bit strong after one and I don't think more than two would be prudent. Nevertheless a very enjoyable beer, I just keep missing it on cask.","Klunco","Feb 26, 2008"

3.42,-10.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,"The cask pour is deep brown - nearly black - with a thin head that carries a carmel color. There are several things going on in the aroma and flavor. Mild hints of toasted almond, dark chocolate, coffee and roasted malt are present, but overall, this is a little thin. It's certainly better on cask than the draft counterpart, and my favorite in the current ABC line-up.","SierraGS","Nov 14, 2007"

4.03,5.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a slightly less than medium body. The carbonation is ample to the beer.

4.27,11.8,4,4.5,4,3.5,5,"Simply an amazing beer on cask, warm and toasted with biscuity malts, chocolate and coffee grinds filling the air. Even thicker than usual, sort of a sludge texture but no matter as the beer more than makes up for it. Alcohol well hidden, though this isn't exactly strong beer anyway. One complaint could be the lack of aftertaste as it somehow dissapeared with a Budweiser Select style of cleaness. Overall though very satisfying, I'd have it again.","TheDeuce","Aug 13, 2006"

4.03,5.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Served at the Gettysburg ABC, in a logoed pint. The beer has a beautiful lasting head (they pour well here, I've noticed). Head is dark tan, above an opaque black liquid. Leaves some very nice lacing. Smells of slight sweet and bitter roast, and high % chocolate. Tastes very rich and creamy (even more so with the pulled pork!), moves through coffee and chocolate to a bittersweet finish. Mouthfeel is medium, with low carbonation, which lends a very nice smoothness. Very drinkable, so long as you don't rush it (I was unfortunately in a hurry to leave, and wasn't fully able to enjoy the last bits).","mjc410","Jun 28, 2006"
3.88,1.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"While it was nothing to crow about, I did enjoy this pint. It has a basic, malty stout character that made a decent name for itself. It was easy on the ABV, and that combined with the crisp finish made it pleasantly drinkable. It might not be something I go out of my way to track down, but I'd not hesitate ordering it again should it find its way back to me.","Foxman","Apr 14, 2006"
4.13,8.1,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Heres a solid black color with a slight chocolate-colored head. The beer presents a fairly intense coffee aroma. Its heavy on the roasted barley, with a mix of highly roasted and burnt grains. The brew is pleasingly dry, with a full smoothness and a bit of chocolate and toffee flavors. Smooth and satisfying mouthfeel, with moderately low carbonation. The brew seems to have moderately low bitterness, and a nice roasted quality in the finish. Very nice.","Suds","Nov 30, 2005"

3.9,2.1,4,4,4,3,4,"This was another obsidian-colored bevvy but, unlike the porter, this had almost no head at all. I again noted the charcoal notes that I often detect in the nose of both porters and stouts. This was a very nice, dry stout and most interestingly, it was served via CO2, vice N2. This meant that the mouthfeel was less creamy that what I would normallly expect for the style. The finish left me with a lingering taste of dark chocolate. Yummy!","woodychandler","May 04, 2004"
4.3,12.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A great beer to finish off a sampler at ABC. A good solid dry Irish stout, with a nice roasty body. Another one of the fine ABC beers I'd have again.","beergeek279","Mar 15, 2004"
4.02,5.2,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours thick and densely black. No head, just a very thin ring of lace around the edge of the glass. Aromas of chocolate, milk, toasted malts and chocolate covered cherries. Flavor is mild but enjoyable. Kind of sweet and malty, I would think this would go more into the sweet stout category. Mouthfeel is a tad spritzy for such a thick stout. However, this is certainly one I could drink a few of, and the low ABV and mild sweetness would make this a great breakfast brew.","IrishRedRock","Feb 09, 2004"
3.61,-5.5,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"ABC's stout looks great. It is almost pure black with a dark tan head and loads of lacing all the way down the glass. It was, however, strangely lacking of any depth in the aroma. There was hint of roasted barley but that's about it. I usually expect to find a lot more smokiness or chocolate or caramel undertones. These were lacking. The taste was good, not great. It is a classic Irish stout as opposed to an American, Imperial, or chocolate stout. That doesn't mean it should have less flavor but this one is a little light on taste. It has the roasted barley taste that is very pleasant, but little else. It was also thinner in the mouth than most stouts. I liked it but again there are better stouts in local brewpubs not far away, Selins Grove and Bullfrog to name two.","rdrummer","Dec 16, 2003"

4.03,5.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Served as part of a sampler tray at their brewery. From the glass, this beer looked midnight black, with a very rich and dark tan head.

Finishes dry. I enjoyed this stout very much.","pezoids","Jan 07, 2003"
3.83,0.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Firm black thick concoction. Rich hop aroma with chocolate malt undertones. Offwhite head slightly less creamy than should be. Nice lace.

3.1,-18.8,4,4,2.5,3,3,"This stout pours an opaque black with minimal head. A scant ring of caramel colored lace hugs the side of my glass at surface level. Smells like strong espresso with a hint of dark chocolate. It tastes like weak coffee though. Not very malty, rather thin overall flavor. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. If you like tepid coffee you will love this beer, but it's not for me. Thanks for the chance to try it Jarod!","cretemixer","Beers"
3.98,4.2,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"As this beer is poured into the glass you notice how dark and robust it appears. The head is full and a rich creamy/tan color. It's lace is nice as it glides down the glass. It smell and taste are of a classic Irish dry stout. The aroma has notes of a roasted malt , coffee, barley and slight hops. The taste is creamy and smooth. The flavors that come out are roasted coffee/light chocolate, barley malt and some hops. This is a ok beer that tastes better as the temperature rises.","Jarod","0"
