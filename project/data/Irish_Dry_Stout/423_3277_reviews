"Overall, this is a beer I really like, but I can understand why Boulevard might be discontinuing it. I see it as a better version of Guinness, but I also don't drink the style terribly often, so I'm not a reliable consumer. And I have a feeling most regular Guinness drinkers would just assume stick with their favorite. It's a tough spot for Boulevard to be in, hence the discontinuation. I'll miss Dry Stout, but there are so many other Boulevard beers that I'd be much sadder to see disappear."

"Sampled on tap at the Boulevard Brewery tasting room on 7/5/2013. Wish they still bottled this beer, they have gone to keg-only on this brew. So any recent bottle reviews have been aged (send some my way!). Very aggressive settling. Faint nose of chocolate and coffee. Tastes of a quality but uncomplicated dry stout. Light-bodied and crisp, with a dry finish. In the vein of Guinness, but a bit dryer. Like I said, wish it was more available outside of local bars and restaurants."

"Was going in with high hopes on this one and the flavor just feel a little flat for me. Really great and viscus dark pour with a small tan head. Great lacing on my glass. Aroma is coffee and chocolate, the mouthfeel was smooth and creamy but the flavor was just missing. Was hoping for more; still very drinkable though."

"O: Enjoyable beer, nitrogen helps out quite a bit. Would definitely order it again."

"enjoyed in a pint glass at jacks smokestak bbq in kansas city. awesome place, local beer. poured a sexy black color with the frothy heavy creamy white head. smells like craft guinness, definitely dry and bitter a bit. taste is dark roasty and coffee-like, with notes of vanilla and cocoa extract. nice bitter hop finish. mouthfeel is perfect, smooth as softened butter with a nice full but drinkable body. stood up to big barbeque too, i would have had 5 of these if i didnt have to drive..."

"This beer has a minimal off white short head which leaves no lacing. It is also not quite as dark as I would like. Aroma is on the roasty side. More patent malt like than anything else. Almost smokey aroma. Nice. Flavor falls a bit flat, but is nice nonetheless. Kind of light, very roasty, light coffee flavor. Kind of nice. Mouthfeel is definitely too light. It is not dry, it just feels watery. Could use more carbonation to bring out some of the dryness. Overall this beer is fine. Its ok, and could use a few different things to improve it, but definitely a nice beer."

"Overall, this is a very fine Irish Dry Stout to have with a meal. It's light and versatile and tasty. Nothing world-beating, but a solid option for a classic style."

"O: Goes down easy. Nothing fancy just and enjoyable stout. Good for a few."

"Drink- Not too shabby. I like how my parents live in KS. I get all the Boulevard offerings. Probably wouldnt have this one again with the smokestack series in small bottles. Dark truth just stomps on the other stouts."
"Overall I thought it was a pretty good offering I think the nitro makes all the difference with the creaminess and such, I'm sure what effect bottling would have."
"M: Lighter, but appropriate for a dry stout."
"mouthfeel: way too dry. i understand thats the style, but this literally deprives your mouth of moisture to a whole new extreme."
"Overall this is a great beer. I an not a fan of he stouts that are flat and this has enough bite to satisfy me. Great beer Boulevard Brewing!!!!"
"12 oz bottle poured into a Unibroue tulip. Best by date of 4/9/11. Thin lacing, soapy and off-white. Body is thin and dark, dark brown. Aroma of coffee and roasted malt dominates. Taste has some caramel malt sweetness and of course coffee and roasted malt flavors. Very pleasing and easy to drink, quite sessionable, I would imagine."
"D: Um, whatever. Average to below average, AT BEST. Would not purchase again"
"M/D - slightly dry mouthfeel, not bad, nothing noteworthy, just a nice plain stout"
"D: very sessionable, this is very Guinness-like when on draft. Not really my favorite style, but a very drinkable, solid brew."
"Overall, a very good representation of the style as far as flavor and aroma. would've like the head to stick around longer, and the mouthfeel to be creamier. however, I could drink this everyday. Great beer!"
"Pours as black as used motor oil, with a foamy brown head which quickly disappears. Aromas of black licorice, semi-sweet chocolate, a little burnt sugar and dark malts. Very malty on the palate, with flavors of bittersweet chocolate and roasted espresso. A very nice example of the style."
"A nice Dry Stout. Not over the top, or underwhelming, as most of the style seems to be, just solid."
"Not a terrible beer but its just not that terribly exciting."
"Feels a little watery in the mouth. Still very drinkable."
"D: Not too heavy. I could drink these all evening. I would give them an agressive pour to bleed off some of the extra CO2 other wise a good session beer. It's great to have a this brewery in our area."
"drinkability-as much as one can buy at a time, i could drink it all."
"Great brew but not the best."
"HV"
"Overall: This is an amazing Irish stout. Balance is great, the amount of roasted barley is just enough to make this a stout. I enjoyed this very much."
"Oh so very easy to drink just another great offering from boulevard."
"D: With this being a bit lighter, it does allow for easier consumption."
"D: Nice how the heavy dry roasting was kept to a minimum. Certainly not my favorite style of stout, but this was an easy drinker and I'd re-visit this in the future."
"This is an easy-drinking dry stout from Boulevard. And very easy to drink."
"I love the flavor and really think boulevard nailed this guy. One of if not my favorite of boulevard's year round offerings."
"Pours very dark with a creamy tan head which settled down and left some lacing. Smell is not not impressive, but the taste is very decent. Light in the mouth with medium carbonation. Not too bitter with nice aftertaste. Very easy drinking. Not an outstanding stout, but easy to drink a couple or more at a session."
"this brew pours up black with a big bubbly tan head. the nose is chocolate, big malts, grainy. the taste is clean dark malts with a very dry and slight bitter finish finish. nice. full bodied, medium carbo. A very nice brew..."
"Very unexpected. Thank you."
"D - Very drinkable beer as long as it is optimally cold. If the bottle isn't quite cold enough, stick it in the freezer just a bit and enjoy."
"Boulevard Dry Stout is a typical Irish dry stout. I'm still new to stout, but from my experience this is one of the better stouts I've tasted. One of the things I've discovered with dry stouts is that they leave you thirsty for more stout. That's not always a bad thing."
"D: The body is delighfully smooth and rich earthy flavors with some bittering hops make this very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is low on body but higher than I'd like in carbonation. Dry on the palate. Drinkability is good except but the smoky dryness gets in the way for me."
"Pours a dark black color. 1/3 inch head of a tan color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, chocolate, slight hops, and slight biscuit. Fits the style of an Irish Dry Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malts, slight hops, and slight biscuit flavors."
"Re-reviewed on 6-20-09 -- raised the taste score from 3.5 to 4 -- damn good stout."
"The flavor starts out with a nice roasted chocolate and coffee malt presence, but turns a bit watery in the middle before giving way to a finish of earthy hops, cracked pepper, and peat. The medium-thin body is well-carbonated, lending a bubbly bite to the experience. Finishes clean and crisp. Overall, a forgettable beer, but a well-crafted Irish Dry nonetheless. I can't see myself buying this again, but I'd never turn away a pint of it."
"Pours a very inky black colored body, a little brown around the edges of the glass. Big foamy tan brown head, lasting, with decent lacing. Dry coffee aroma, some slight bittersweet chocolate too. Roasted aromas, some ash. Watery body, ash taste, roasted and coffee flavors, some toffee too. Roasted aftertaste. Some slightly burnt coffee taste too. Pretty tasty. Light for a stout, almost porter-like."
"Relatively light bodied, without much carbonation. Slick, but on the thin side. Really quite smooth. Pretty drinkable. There's not a lot going on flavor-wise, but it's an easy-going, sessionable style, so I can't fault anybody. I'd be more than happy quaff a few of these in an evening."
"Overall: A big thanks go to Vancer for sending this beer my way. It is probably one of the best Dry Stouts I have ever had. Most are thin and lacking flavor. This one was great."
"I tried this in the distant past as part of Boulevard's variety pack and found it to be unpleasant, maybe due to a bad experience I recently had with a glass of Guinness, but more likely due to my still developing ""beer chops."" Upon further review however, I found this to be a solid, albeit somewhat unremarkable stout. I'd certainly order this over Guinness any day."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours motor oilblack with an inch of fizzy tan head. Smell is very toasty but not very strong. Taste is light with hints of dark malts, cocoa, coffee, and burnt chocolate. Extremely light mouthfeel. This is an easy drinking stout. Not one of my favorites but worth checking out."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my New Belgium globe glass. This beer pours a dark espresso brown with a big 3 inch beige head that slowly melts into just a center ring. The aroma of this beer is flat. Definite notes of dark malts and a bit of chocolate, but not a whole lot and definitely no notes of dark fruits or coffee that is so typical to the style. The flavor is also just pretty bland. A bit of roasted grains, mixed with some coco powder. That's really all that comes to mind. The mouthfeel is the worst attribute of the beer. This beer is dry. Probably the driest stout I have ever had and it completely lacks the creaminess that makes the style so enjoyable. This is, in my opinion, the worst of the year round beers that Boulevard does. Give me a Bully! Porter."
"Over all its better than what I expected (this brand keeps surprising me) and is light enough for a sixer to go down easily. Will use this one to introduce to my beer drinking friends in this style."
"Overall, this is a very easy to drink stout. This stout isn't too think, but it is full in flavor."
"Medium body but a little thin and watery. At any rate, this is a very drinkable brew. It's no Beamish, but hey I'll gladly have another of these."
"D- Quite a drinkable stout."
"Thanks Linda for the sample."
"Out of a Boulevard variety pack. Poured a pitch black with clear, ruby highlights, and a tall tan head and lacing. The aroma is a bit lacking in strength and cardboard is preasent, but there's still a pleasant milk chocolate and smoke smell. The flavor is richer with espresso, dark chocolate, and deep roasted barley. The feel is nice and roasty, but just a toast too astringent. It's a bit thicker than the traditional imported IDS's, but it's worth a try if you big dry stouts, I'm enjoying it."
"Notes from 09/23/05."
"Not the best from Boulevard, but still good. Better than some of the Nitro crap Dry Stouts from across the pond."
"Overall: The body is light to medium and the finish is quick with a tainting of sweetness there is an alkaline dusty mouthfeel."
"this beer was ok and i would buy it again eventually i'm sure. the appearance and smell were ok. nice black color, the head didn't hang around long at all though. Had a bit of roasted smell to it. The taste was pretty good i thought. A nice metallic ring and a good roasted taste with a nice hint of alcohol at the end. I didn't like the mouthfeel for a stout. it was basically just a watery mouthfeel which is a quality i don't care for in a stout. The drinkability was for sure there in this one. i guess you could say it had its good and bad qualities."
"Greg"
"A little bitter and astringent on the mouthfeel. Smooth and a bit thin. Decent, but I much prefer their Bully Porter over all the others."
"Thats about it."
"a stout for the uneducated and curious. extremely drinkable and sessionable. i could see washing down some spicy smoked sausage and some pepperjack cheese with this brew. perfect for a late fall, windy, cold november eve. some college hockey and an early season fire in the fireplace is where this evening is headed..."
"A very drinkable brew, although not much more interesting than a glass of water. Sessionable? Yes. Interesting? No. This would make for an interesting crossover beer, or session beer if there are no other options. Probably a good stout to give to the macro drinker to open their eyes without being too challenging to their palates, but there is not much here to hold the interest of a craft beer aficionado."
"D- Too roasty for me, but a good beer."
"D - easy to drink and have multiple at a time...this was a good take on a dry stout..."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Good flavor and low alcohol makes for an easy drinking."
"Pours a dark reddish brown allowing only a glimmer of light around the edges,the head is a medium cream,a bit thin and no sticky shit. The nose is soft and mostly made up of chocolate powder and roasted coffee beans. This Stout is a little nuttier than usual,with lots of coffee and dark roasted malt flavors. Subtle caramel flavors mix with almond to create a flavored coffee affect that helps pull off a just above average flavor score. The body seems much too thin,and could really use some more dryness as well. Maybe a good intro Stout for those without an acquired palate,for me a let down from a overall good brewery."
"I would buy this if this was the only thing with ML, BL, CL, MGD, Bud, etc. But I am sure glad I got this one for free because I would have been upset buying a sixer. Decent, but there are much better ones out there and not hard to find."
"D: Nothing very special in the dry stout department -- go for the Boulevard Bully Porter or (even better) the Bob's Munich Lager from their line-up."
"D: Non-offensive and easy to drink. A light, sessionable ABV means I could have another; alas, this is my only bottle."
"Drinkabiliity: this is a very good dry stout. I would buy it again."
"Overall, this beer gets a 'meh'."
"*Note: The drinkability goes up .5 if you have this brew on March 17th."
"Smooth, delightful and very drinkable."
"Very nice drinkability due to being such a smooth and subtle flavor. Could probably use a little jumpstart. Overall enjoyable though."
"D - I probably wont be picking this one up again."
"This was one of the easier to drink dry stouts that I've had... not too strong but that will appeal to some and not others."
"Overall, I thought this was one of the better offerings from this sampler...well done, Boulevard and welcome to TN!!"
"In the non-imperial stout catagory, this one is a winner."
"A bit on the thin side although moderate carbonation is a plus. I'm not hating this beer but it does absolutely nothing to separate itself from the bigger brewers of the style."
"Pours a dark brown/black with ruby highlights when held to light. Has a skimpy off white head that sticks for a bit. Aroma is faint cocoa and dried fruit. I'm missing the roasted grains that are typical in a dry stout. Taste has some chocolates, a bit of roast bitterness and some more dried fruit. Carbonation is ample, mouthfeel is creamy, body could be a little thicker for me. Overall a decent brew, I could see myself sessioning this if it were more available to me. Could use more roast flavor and aroma."
"D - I would drink one of these, but not more than one, unless there was no better choice."
"Served in a pint glass from a 12oz. bottle. The beer poured a dark brown/black, forming a 1 inch mocha head, leaving light lacing on the glass. The aroma for this beer was very light, actually having to search for it. What was detectable was a light hint of roasted malts. The taste follows closely with the aroma, being a little on the weak side. The taste was also dominated by a light roasted malt flavor, with very little coffee/chocolate flavor as expected. This being in the dry Irish stout style, I expect it to be lighter in flavor, but not quite this light. Clean smooth mouthfeel and finish. Definitely a sessionable beer. I actually did enjoy this beer. I was just let down a bit by expecting one thing and then getting another. That aside, this is an enjoyable beer."
"D: Good good and more good, not a demanding beer but it tastes good and is a solidly sessionable beer."
"Tasted on 4/11/08."
"5-29 Had this on tap at a steakhouse in KC. Better than the bottle and a nice substitute for guinness."
"Pours fairly dark black with a small beige head. Smell is faint dark fruit and roasted malts. Not too strong, and almost a cherry note. Taste is thin and watery dark malt with a hint of tartness again. A bit of a drying character, but too thin and unremarkable to recommend. Not very good."
"D - So many nice things going for this beer, everything except for the entry and middle of the brew... which is kind of a big deal. Maybe on draft, real fresh it would be better, but this just tasted like it had fallen apart."
"pours a very dark black color,pretty much pitch black. has a small brown head on it, but not much, and no carbonation really. smell is really good, has that ""guinness"" smell to it, thats how i can relate to it, like a chocolately, hazelnut aroma. taste is pretty good, has a slight bitterness to it, with a more profound chocolate malt flavor. mouthfeel is decent, its a pretty drinkable beer, depending on the weather."
"This brew has a very peculiar, ever-changing flavor profile. One sip it's all malt, the next it's sweet fruit. Sometimes very bitter, sometimes sweet and creamy. It is quite interesting, but it never arrives at something very likeable or balanced. The mouthfeel was never quite there."
"Not the greatest stout ever made, but I would easily pick it over a Guinness. I could easily drink several pints and be perfectly happy with my choice."
"D: Decently drinkable, but nothing special. I can't knock it for being dry...it is what it is...but I prefer other stout types."
"Drinks pretty good, but give me a Irish big three over this any day. Love to try this on tap or better nitro. Just run of the mill"
"From a sampler pack, bottle pours a dark mahogany body with a small, but lasting, khaki head. Some good lacing is left on the glass. Not much of an aroma for a stout. Some roasty notes of burnt coffee is about it. Thin in the mouth, overcarbonated for style. Taste has a roasty bitterness like strong coffee and a pleasant nuttiness. Very mundane overall."
"D - I could drink this all night. Almost like Guinness light with all the flavor."
"This was all right, but not great. I've been happy with most of Boulevard's beers, but this one didn't really do it for me."
"I don't dislike this beer but with that said I would choose the more readily available big 3 over this. Guinness, Beamish and Murphys."
"This stout pour a very nice dark brown in the glass. It only lost points because while the head had a nice tan color it was small, and had very little lacing. The smell of this beer was good. Sweet chocolate malt, with a sprinkle of hops. Taste was good. Sweet chocolate...very sweet, I thought this was a dry stout. The hops hit finally but don't linger. Mouthfeel was ok, could be a little better if a it were a tad bit thinker. Overall drinkability was goood. Went down smooth. Didn't leave me to full. Nice stout even if it was a little sweet for a dry stout."
"Boulevard Dry Stout pours a dark black with a hint of amber up to the light. It has a mellow malty smell that goes along with a creamy dry malted flavor. The mouthfeel is very smooth making it quite enjoyable. A nice drink, but the dryness really kicks in at the end making it a bit tough to finish the bottom."
"Poured this into a pint glass. It poured a dark chocolate Color with a tan head that didn't last very long. The smell of this beer is malty with a chocolate kick. It also had the chocolate and roasted malt flavor. All in all this was a decent beer, with a watery mouthfeel. I would prefer it to be a little thicker in the mouth, but in a pinch, it is better than some beers. I would drink this agian, if I couldn't find anything else to enjoy."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a best by date into a pint glass. It was a dark brown color. It had a decent light tan head that quickly settled into a tiny collar. The aroma was so-so with roasted and chocolate malts. Not very strong. The taste was also just average. Had some flavor but really needed more to stand out. It's better than a macro but not by much. Mouthfeel was watery. Overall it's an OK beer but with so many better beers out there I don't see me having this one again. Only recommend if you can steal from a friends fridge. (One and done)"
"Deep dark color. Not a lot of carbonation. Nice, sharp roasted aroma. Good malty flavor. Nice roasted notes with a well balanced bitterness. Fairly dry finish. Decent mouthfeel. Very drinkable and enjoyable. I could see having many of these in a sitting. Bet its damn good on draft too."
"Pours out a dark, chocolatey brown with ruby highlighted edges and a fluffy and whipped khaki head. Smell has notes of chocolate, toffee, and a mild roast. Some fruity esters pop up as well. Pretty tame in the flavor department, but I enjoy it for what it is. Starts off with some esters and a far pushed-back chocolate. The finish brings on the roast and ends dry. Welcome bitterness hangs on after each sip. Mouthfeel is light and smooth. For its dryness and easy-going flavor profile, this is really drinkable."
"Completely average stout, with nothing outstanding at all."
"This beer isn't the best of its style, but its local and the price is right, so drink up!"
"D: Very drinkable beer. A sipping beer for sure."
"This beer pours a nearly opaque black color. The head is large, firm, creamy, and light tan in color. It recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of roasted malt, cream, and a hint of milk chocolate and vanilla. The taste is of roasted malt, chocolate, with a funky aftertaste. It is almost astringent. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with moderately high carbonation. Overall, this beer has a nice appearance and aroma, but the taste is too much for me to deal with. I will not drink this one again."
"Poured a dark black with just hints of ruby when held to the light. 2 finger tan head that didnt last long. decent lacing. The smell is of malts, coffee, chocolate. Taste is dark chocolate, roasted coffee, bitter finish. Mouthfeel was medium body, lots of carbonation, one was plenty. This is not my favorite style, but much better then other beers of the same style."
"I truely enjoy this beer. Great flavors but not too overpowering. Good full feel and good dry stout finish."
"D: drinkable, but personally, one is plenty."
"D: It's drinkable & a decent brew, but if you're a big stout fan, you'll probably want something else instead. I have a hard time believing this has the same parents as the Bully Porter."
"I think I like the bottle conditioned version better, the nitro version is a bit watery."
"Received as an extra from bort11 (thank you). Served slightly chilled in a pint glass, from a stubby twelve ounce bottle. Poured a deep, pitch black. Yielded about a finger and a half of creamy, light brown head with a vigorous pour. Head somewhat quickly dissipated into a thin ring of lace in the glass. Smell: Aromas of roasted malts, a slight layer of black licorice, a small hint of semi-sweet chocolate, with just a little bit of smoke in the background. Not a very strong nose, but not too bad. Flavor was comparable to the smell. The bitter semi-sweet chocolate flavor hits the tongue first, followed by the black licorice, and any smokey notes in the back. Finishes pretty dry as the name implies. A bit over carbonated in my opinion. A somewhat thin mouthfeel that had an almost chalky feel to it. None of the 5.2 percent alcohol was present. Pretty drinkable."
"A little too sweet, a little too carbonated. It's okay, but more ""sessionable"" dry stouts out there, IMO."
"overall i really enjoyed this brew, but i found it a little too sweet"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is dark - black with a thin bubbly head. Smell is enjoyable; slightly roasted coffee along with a touch of chocolate and hints of vanilla. The initial taste is similar to the nose with the roasted malt flavor being dominant and a decently bitter finish, not quite as enjoyable. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a creamy carbonation and a dry (really?!) finish. Overall this is a very sessionable stout. The bottle I have has a best by date of three months ago but it still tastes good. I would however like to try a bottle in its prime."
"Overall impression: Not as ""dry"" as I would think of for a dry stout. In fact, it's almost sweet enough to be a sweet stout. I expected more body too. That being said, it's a well crafted, highly sessionable, enjoyable stout. Not a classic dry stout example but a fine ale."
"Enjoyed one and would have enjoyed moving right on to the other, but not worth savoring, either."
"Thanks, Vancer, for the opportunity"
"Mouthfeel was medium to thin in the body. Zesty carbonation was a bit too much."
"D- There is not much depth in this beer but it is pretty drinkable and definitely taste like a stout."
"D - Good session brew, albeit a bit boring."
"Drinkability: Fair. I found this beer to be some what cloying after the first bottle. Not my favorite from Blvd."
"Overall just an average stout."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is sweet slightly roasted malts, and caramel. The taste is dry and malty with a nice touch of caramel. Light-Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad brew at all, glad to have had a chance to try it."
"Creamy, drying nitro mouthfeel. Seems really artificial and confected. Not a fan. Drinkable, but barely."
"D - It definitely got better as it warmed, but not your typical stout; maybe I need more experience with the style. Still ended up being enjoyable...a good session beer."
"A pitch black dark beer with medium off white head. Like a lot of other dark beers I've smelled. Kind of like molasses. Taste is a crisp dark beer with a mild after taste of coffee. The mouthfeel was a high carbonation in this beer. A little too much dry feeling in my mouth as well. drinkability is average. I might drink again if someone gave me one."
"Drinkability is above average, with possibly only the dryness slowing it down. I also have to say that the flavors and aroma that pleased me initially toned down quite a bit as I got used to the flavor. I can see this happening as this was my first beer of the night. Towards the end, I just didn't think the flavors were that strong and wished it was more robust."
"Poured to a deep dark brown with tan head that lingered for half the glass, and left okay lacing. Pleasant aroma, though muted, of chiocolate, nuts and toffee, with taste following along the same lines. The body was thin and slightly watery, and the 4.9% ABV never did make itself known. Not a bad beer, but Ive definitely had better stouts."
"The first thing you notice is that the mouth is very carbonated, overly so. Masks the flavor. Some lightly roasty dark malt. Kind of limp and watery, no creaminess or driness in this dry stout. Lackluster overall."
"Pours a four finger, light tan head that fades to a ring leaving a little lace. Midnight black color. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Roasted/burnt coffee nose. Starts with a burnt coffee flavor and finishes dry, bitter aftertaste that lingers. Not as dry as Guinness. $1.29 for a 12oz bottle from John's Grocery Iowa City, IA."
"From a nitro tap at the Crescent Moon in Omaha, NE. Chill-hazed dark brown, nearly black, but with ruby highlights around the edges; standard densely-packed creamy nitro-infused head. Nothing out of the ordinary so far. Only the faintest of sourish roasted malt aromas are detectable. Overall, a very meager nose. The taste is more or less a reflection of the bouquet, such as it is, with very modest roasted grain flavors mingling with a sour, earthy hop character. Somewhat funky nitrogen aftertaste. The mouthfeel is smooth enough, but not quite creamy. Light body, definitely to style. In all, this will hardly knock any socks off, but I suppose it's a step up from Guinness draft."
"Overall, this is by no means an undrinkable beer. Fairly well balanced in the flavor, no overwhelming flavors, just a strange mouthfeel is what really doesn't do it for me. If you really like stouts and are in Missouri, give this one a shot."
"Poured into a shaker at the Boulevard Brewpub - KC Airport. A long-lasting one-finger nitro-head capped off a super-dark ruby body. The head left some thick and slick lacing. The nose had a sweet light coffee aroma, with a bit of roast. The taste was good and highly roasted, with hints of smoke. It was exceptionally dry and bitter, but began with an initial quick sweetness. It also had a welcome bit of vinous acidity. The mouth was medium thick, with very light carbonation. A rich, but surprisingly quaffable stout."
"Overall impression: Nicely drinkable stout - not quite as stand-out as the porter, but still very nice."
"Not a bad beer. Similar to your bigger brand name dry stouts such as Guinness and Murphy's, but without the nitro-induced creaminess. This one is pretty good at holding its own. Recommended."
"This came with a very thick, deep-tan head. It was a deep, dark brown color with reddish highlights. It gave off a pleasant cocoa/chocolate nose. The mouthfeel was creamy and full as a direct result of the pour. I got a good chocolate taste in the mouth. The finish had both cocoa and a light smokiness. This would be good with fish or dessert, IMHO."
"Into a pint glass, pours a near black, ruby hues at bottom, with good head and now a ring around the top, no lacing. Aroma is classic stout, but not anything special, with really just roasted malts and no other hints or flavors. Taste is a little more appealing, roasty and a mild hint of coffee grounds, a nice dry finish, but still lacking a bit. The mouth isn't really that full, a little too thin, and entirely too carbonated with little creaminess to balance carbonation out. For me, this started out good, but every successive bottle I drink leaves me yearning for more and more again. Bummer."
"Pours a deep almost black, brown with deep garnet highlights. Good, sturdy head and thick foam with sticky lacing. The aroma was even dry. But a good coffee bean dry with some hints of cotton balls. Plenty of tootsie roll-like chocolate mixed with some deep roasted and surprisingly smoked malts. By surprisingly I mean that I wasn't expecting that much smokey flavor. Of a dry palate at the finish. But if I would let the taste linger for about five minutes, the feeling is one of great refreshment."
"Update: 3-17-08 Part of a St. Pat's Irish Stout-a-thon. Only non nitro of the bunch. I adjusted the appearance and mouthfeel. When compared to the nitro cans the head on this is weak, but it has a fuller mouthfeel. It may be apples and oranges, but when one thinks Irish Stout the ususal is a nitro can of Murphy's, Beamish or Guiness, so I used those as the guides. Still this beer is good."
"Boulevard Dry Stout is black in color with a tan head. Aroma is light, mainly dark malt. The taste is of roasted barly with a hint of dark chocolate and a dry finish. It is medium bodied and moderatly carbonated. There are better Irish stouts out there, but this one is not bad."
"I just found a stray bottle from this same batch that I reviewed, 3 years ago and cranked it open-- STILL FANTASTIC!"
"Originally reviewed May 27, 2005. 12 Oz Bottle. Pitch black pour with 2 fingers of large bubbled tan head. Dry roasted coffee and fresh linen aroma. A hint of ammonia. Pretty plain dry coffee and chocolate flavors, backed with a heavy dose of cream and finish of tangy sea salt. Aftertaste is tangy and a little oaky, pretty standard."
"A nice Irish stout and quite easy to drink."
"The beer is very smooth and easy to drink and I would enjoy having another. Once again Boulevard produces a solid brew!"
"D- Due to the lightness, this is very drinkable. In fact I could drink these easily all night. The flavor is well balanced and very enjoyable. It's not a ""perfect"" example of a stout, but still very good. One of Boulevard's best"
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a 1/2"" tan head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice earthy, black malt scent that also boasts of chocolate and roasted malts. It's sweet with a dry earthy aroma. The taste is decent. It has a thin black malt flavor that is dry and quite earthy. It has a dry roasted flavor, but lacks a significant body. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with less than adequate carbonation. This is an easy drinking stout, but it lacks body and carbonation."
"Beer pours out nice deep brown color with a small head. It smells slightly of charcoal and chocolate. There is a little chocolate taste as well, but it also has hints of caramel flavor. It is kind of bitter as well. It drinks very smoothly. Overall, I think is a pretty solid dry stout."
"Not the best Irish Stout I've tasted so far but certainly a drinkable example of the style."
"This stout can only muster a thin, brittle, tan head that disappears quickly. It has a light roasted chocolate aroma. The flavor is water roasted coffee with light coacoa and earthy hop notes. Mouthfeel is watery and overcarbonated for the style. This is very mediocre beer. Hard to believe that this and that killer porter can come from the same brewer."
"Overall: More impressed by the aroma than the flavor. The flavor actually seemed like somewhat of a letdown."
"This is an opaque stout that pours into my glass with a flourish of foam that settles rather quickly. The roasted coffee bean aroma is rather pleasant, with hints of milk chocolate present, too. I detect the flavors of chocolate and bitter hops before a lightly bitter-chocolate finish full of prickly carbonation. This beer does pretty well for a light bodied stout and comes across as a pretty tasty session beer. I would like a touch more coffee flavor, maybe a little more hop bitterness and a less prickly carbonation, but this otherwise a tasty dry stout. I'm don't think Boulevard does this, but a cask-conditioned example could be divine."
"This beer pours jet black with a tiny, tiny tan head. Par for the course, just nothing special. The aroma is barely there... a deep whiff brings just a touch of roastiness, but just a touch. Why? The taste brings some of the roastiness forward, but again not much and if it weren't for the aftertaste, I'd have to question whether or not I was drinking a macro's attempt at a stout. The mouthfeel is that of a lighter-bodied stout. Again, average, but nothing remarkable. Drinkable? Yes. this is more of a session beer than anything. Really, if they remarketed this beer as a ""mild"" I'd be more happy with this brew. Overall, this is a weak example of a dry stout, akin to something you might expect from a macro. Not remarkable, not memorable."
"Thanks to bditty187 for this beer."
"Almost no head or head retention. Slight smokey sweet smell and quite dark appearance. A little roasted flavor, no coffee, slight malt sweetness with equally slight hop bitterness. The flavor becomes a little more pronounced if you wait for it to warm up and swish it around in your mouth. The coffee flavor finally comes into play as well as a hop bitterness that wasn't there before, but still no real aftertaste. This beer is lacking in character and body. I like the idea of a bottle conditioned dry stout and the extra carbonation it gives compared to the nitro can/bottle. This one needs a little work."
"Smooth and very drinkable. Less filling than Guinness but still satisfying. Slightly milder flavor could make it more acceptable to non-stout drinkers."
"So punk bands that go pop are a dime a dozen now a days. A good coffee-esk Stout are not. Lucky me I have access to try Boulevards Dry Stout again."
"The sour does fade a bit as it warms."
"I will start by saying that I had expected more from this one. I typically like the offerings from boulevard and expected this one to be strong as well....I really wanted to like it....sadly I found the pour unimpressive with a 1 1/2 finger head that dwindled quickly. Very dark color looks tough and inviting with a full body smell that would bring promise of heavy malts and some bite from a floral whiff. The taste was disappointing burnt and almost stale. The drink date on the beer is thanksgiving day which should be safe not to say that it is the freshest that BB has on the shelf. The mouthfeel is watery more than anything....overall this beer had some things going for it but it didn't hit where it counted. I think I may try it again to check for freshness."
"Mouthfeel is semi dry and slightly sweet."
"The taste is also rich, but subtle. The roastiness and coffee play very nicely with the chocolate. Excellent example of the style, and quite quaffable at that. I highly recommend it to anybody."
"Very drinkable. will seek this out next time I am in the midwest."
"I went straight for another one after the first. Would totally drink again."
"I wanted to like it, but there's no way around this one...sorry..."
"On tap at Flying Saucer in Little Rock, AR. The bartended kept removing the foam from the pint till the glass poured near full, quite a site."
"All in all not a bad stout....worth drinking"

"This one pours a very dark color with a small head that has nice retention and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is subdued, but has some roasted malts and some coffee in there. Pleasant. The flavor is mostly comprised of the roasted malt. Pretty boring, actually. Tasty, don't get me wrong, but it lacks a bit in body and there's no 'catch' here. Drinkability is good."
"Boulevard Dry Stout doesn't taste like the Big Three dry stouts, but in this case, it works out well. It's an enjoyable beer on its own merits, and being a little different makes this a good session stout. Check it out."
"from the bottle. shared this one with bieristgut. poured darak brown, with a tan head. aromamalts, cocoa, molasses, black cherries, sugar. flavor, smoke, wood, roasted malts, I wish the flavor was a little more robust.all flavors were weak. chalky and dry mouth feel."
"This beer pours a nice black color with a finger of head that falls slightly to coat the beer. The nose is slightly coffee and slight chocolate. The flavor is nice and rich roasted coffee with a more chocolatey finish. The coffee bitter fades nicely into a sweet aftertaste. The feel is moderate and drying on the finish. Very nice. This is definately well worth looking into. I like the flavor and feel a lot. I could easily sit and drink this one all night. A very nice stout."
"Nice bottle conditioned Best By 4/29/05 frosty. Poured a coal black with dark brown edges. Minimum head and lacing but a good malty / chocolate aroma, perhaps caramel overtones. Tingles on the tongue, very dry (duh) with small carbonation. Very drinkable, for me  gave the wife-zilla a sample taste and got a whoooo outa her. I had another."
"This stout poured an opaque black color with tall, creamy, light brown foam that persisted a while but then settled, clinging a bit. The smell was roasted-malty with a light yeasty aroma. The taste was full or roasted malt and barley with a hint of sweetness and a hint of fruitiness. The hoppiness seemed light compared to the malt. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy and dry overall with medium body and moderate carbonation. It was relatively clean. This was a very nice and easy to drink dry Irish stout."
"Not too bad. Nice malty arorma. Short head dissapates quickly, but there is a substantial tan lacing. It is totally opaque, nearly black as night. Oh and the taste, roasted malt with a refreshing dry finish. One of Boulevard's better offerings. Cheers."
"12 oz screw-top bottle obtained from Johns Grocery (Iowa City) in January 2005 and consumed the next evening. Pours a finger-and-a-half brown head over a pitch black beer. Smells are of chocolate and coffee with some sweet caramel, too. Combined, they make molasses, I guess. Smells very sweet and creamy, almost oatmeal stoutish. If there are hops in the aroma, Im guessing Fuggles. Tastes coffee to start which fades gently to a late chocolate. Sour cherries in the end, too. Thats about it. Not much to say, as theres not much here. If theres any hop bitter, its blended into or hidden by the medium-heavy carbonation (more than I want in a stout). Medium bodied with a dry finish and a roasted roughness left on my tongue after the swallow. This bottle offering is much better than I expected, as Ive had it on tap and found it to be watery."
"Almost opaque. Thin light brown head. Lacing is adequate. There's a nice dry roasted aroma here. A little nutty, like roasted almonds. But also like roasted coffee bean and roasted malt. Some light roasted malt tones on the palate. A little coffee. Maybe some vanilla and caramel tones, but just not a lot of depth really. It's agreeable, but not special. Mouthfeel is just a little watery. Lightly carbonated. Decent brew but I wouldn't go quite so far as to say it's good."
"Boulevard Dry Stout is a stout, a dry one as well, there is just not a lot of hoopla here."
"Thanks to BuckeyeNation for the opportunity to try this out. The color was very dark, not completely opaque though. The head was nice full and fluffy but dissipated somewhat quickly as large bubbles formed and burst. But I greatly prefer this real type of head over the fake nitrogen one you get from some beers; this beer is bottle conditioned and it shows in the complexity of the aroma and flavor. The aroma features a bit of roasted malt and then hits you with a nice malty, grainy note. The flavor is very well balanced with a good blend of malt, roasty sharp bitterness, and back-of-the-tongue hop notes as well. It may have been a little less dry than I expected, although this is hardly a dig on the beer. The body was nice and full. Overall an excellent drinkable beer."
"Courtesy of BuckeyeNation. Pours a slightly translucent dark brown color with a medium thin beige head that disappeared pretty quickly. Very little lacing. The aroma is lightly roasty with coffee and a hint of chocolate. Medium-bodied and sort of watery at times. Coffee and hops in the flavor but not with much authority. The finish is dry and roasty. Overall this Stout is a bit of a letdown."
"Drinkability was at best average, relatively weak effort from a solid brewery."
"Appearance: Pours a dark ruby deep brown practically black forms with a nice sized tan head, good overall appearance the head seems the carbonation is a bit too high or fizzy. Dwindles quickly leaving sporadic lacing down the glass not bad. Aroma: Dark roasts consume most of the aromatics but there is a great herbal hop profile that must be noted seems very fresh with almost a hint of chocolate mint. Not a lot of mint just leaves that impression on me in a good way. Taste: Perfect example of a dry Irish stout creeps on the palate with decently robust dark roasts leaving a lingering dryness on the palate, however this one contains a nice splash of hop character bringing out some mildly earthy and herbal notes very nice. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied brew carbonation settles nicely not overbearing in anyway a very smooth brew in my opinion. Drinkability: Wow, I could definitely spend an afternoon imbibing on a few of these, very nice overall flavorful Dry Irish Stout. Thanks to BuckeyeNation for the sample, I really enjoyed this one."
"Pours nice, as it should, black color with a nice tan head maybe a finger and a half high. Head dissapates rather quickly though. Not a ton going on in aroma, slight roasty aroma. Flavor is, well, kinda bland, some sharp roasty bitterness in the end, but not a ton going on. A slight tartness ala guiness also. Has a slightly thin mouthfeel, but not bad for the style. I could drink these, but I'd probably look for something else."
"Black crayon hue with a light tan head, considerable lacing noted. Some chocolate malts and sweetness detected in the aroma, yes, it just smells somewhat sweet. Up front, yes it is dry, a near cotton-mouth effect. Some chocolate/roasted malts, some coffee bean tastings are also present. Medium based body, just a slight offering of bitter hops. Boy, the name dry stands out, not sure what clears the palate, but after two of these, a pitcher of water could be handy. Still, not a bad stout."
"Pours jet black color, decent size light brown head that doesn't last with no lacing, has light chocolate and coffee aromas. Dark roasted malty chocolate and dark fruity flavors, light to medium bodied with a crisp and carbonated mouthfeel maybe a little thin, finishes with a very dry bitterness."
"And as someone else reviewed earlier, the draught version of this is much better on it's own and also makes a good black & tan with their Pale or a ""Thundercloud"" with their Wheat. Most above average bars around KC will have all three available for mixing."
"Thanks to Bditty for the bottle!!!"
"Boulevard Dry Stout isn't really that good. It's a slightly different take on the style, but one that doesn't do much for me. Drinkable, yes, but I can't see myself buying it again."
"Dry is definitely the operative term for this beer. Very dry, indeed. Pours out a dark rich brown, almost black. Head is very nice, some lacing, and the aroma is, well, stout. Smoky, almost ashy in taste, it goes down easy with a little bitter aftertaste-a nice bite, very complex. It changes it's taste as it goes down, but has a thick, chalky mouthfeel. Overall, a solid offering from my hometown brewery."
"I regret to write a bad review of anything from Boulevard (wanna stay loyal to the local brew), but this is a piss-poor offering. There was a good reason they never released this in bottles until recently--it's not good. On tap, now, that's a different story...I like the Dry Stout on tap. It's a thinner, easier drinking ""session"" stout compared to thicker, chewier stouts like {insert any stout name here}, but I like that. On tap, Dry Stout at least has SOME toasty stout-like flavors. In the bottle, none. To me, this is the flattest, most tasteless stout I've ever had. I guess if you normally drink macro brew and prefer very little flavor in your beer, this may be a choice for you so you can look cool drinking a dark beer. I'm not saying this is an outright BAD beer, but it lacks anything good, especially for a stout."
"This beer tastes good, but I expected something more... ummm... stout! For flavor, I'll take a Boulevard Bully! Porter over this any time!"
"Overall, this is a good stout. I'm impressed with the 2 beers I've had from Boulevard and look forward to the opportunity to sample more of their beers. Big thank you to bditty187 for the bottle!"
"Pours to a fluffy tan head and nearly opaque black-ruby color. I had a very hard time seeing through this stout. Head dissipated to a thin film with ""hurricane swirl"" in the middle of the glass. Roasted Barley dominates the nose with hints of burnt popcorn. Flavor is DRY and roasty with bitterness coming mainly from the roasted grain. Mouthfeel is nice and thick. Finishes roasty and coffeelike. A very pleasing bottled stout. I bet this tastes 10x better on nitro draught."
"This beer is completly black, and even held to light you would be hard pressed to find a hint of red. Fairly small brown head topping it off. Scent is totally roasted malts, no room for debate on that one. The taste of this beer is more subdued than i would have guessed from the scent. Its roasted malt, i think the name dry stout sums this beer up quite well. What you'd expect, not a bad drink."
"A solid if not stellar stout."
"Ahhh, my quest to try this brew is complete. Being a total fan of the boulevard line, I felt like I was in for a wonderful treat. I recieved my pint glass with a smile and a nod. Beautiful cascading bubbles down the side, nice dark, dark brown color, creamy white head, lacing all over the place. Smell was roasted nuttyness, though not as strong as I was expecting. Taste? Well, not what I was expecting either. I think they went a little too far on the dryness. Very subdued flavor. Nice roasted maltiness, just not very much of it. Mouthfeel was the best part of this brew, my God man, just try this beer for that. Very creamy and velvety smooth. So very, very creamy. I could definately drink these, but, it would be nice if they could give this a little ""BAM!"" It could be such an awesome brew instead of being just above average."
"Taste also is lacking a bit. Not overtly bad in anyway, just not... For such a dark beer, there is much roasted flavor. Beer is thick in the mouth, but lacking in flavor."
"This looked almost identical to a Guinness when he brought it out: if I hadn't seen him pour it I might have mistaken one for the other. The aroma is fairly non-existent. The taste is a bit weak for a stout, but some hints of roastiness. Also, a hair of sweetness in the aftertaste. A better session beer."
"Boulevard Dry Stout, perfect for nights out when you're counting carbs but want more than 1 beer."
"The nose was lightly roasted malt, chocolate, and some coffee.  It has a soothing aroma to it.  The flavors are light coffee, chocolate, roasted malt, and (faint) bitter hops.  And as the name states, it finishes dry.  You want to have another.  The body is black and the head is creamy, tan, and influenced by the nitro tap.  This is a very good beer, a lightish stout, with enjoyable flavors.  I will gladly have another."
"This brew is a thick red-black color with fantastic head retention.  The aroma is light an roasted.  When they named this beer dry they weren’t kidding.  It is so dry the flavor turns up quite watery.  The brew is quite full-bodied and smooth, but a little more malt sweetness would be great."
"Near black in color with thick, creamy, tan head that lasted until the end.  The aroma was of roasted coffee and chocolate, with very slight malt.  The flavor was very roasty with little chocolate in the taste and the malty sweetness appeared towards the end of the aftertaste.  It was smooth, but a bit too thin (ie. watery).  It is more flavorful than the Guiness, but if you like a full-flavored stout (kind of the definition of stout) there are better ones out there.  Since I am not a stout person, I thought it had a good flavor.  Hard to drink more than one or two though."
"Tan, creamy, dense & sticky head after the nitro casacde effect. A hint of chocolate malt malt in aroma, but other malt notes are absent.  Hop bitterness is fairly low for style & gives way to malt sweetness unusual for a dry stout.  The chocolate malt flavor is mellow and pleasant, but sharp black patent and/or roasted barley notes are absent in this brew.  Richer in body than draught Guinness, but roasted barley contributions are lacking.  Roasted grain bitterness manages to eek its way into the finish.  A decent stout, but it's a bit too ""soft"" on the palette.  More bitterness both from roasted barley and hops would've made this a better dry stout."
