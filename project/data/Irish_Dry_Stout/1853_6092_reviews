"Draft at Liberty Craft House in State College, celebrating St. Patrick's day and Jer's 40th birthday...jet black body with a pile of pillorous brown head that mushrooms atop the nonick; thick, resilient glass-clinging frothy tracing ...milky elements and earthy, peaty  tones as well in the aroma....reasonably smooth with a palpable exit down the throat; leaves a noticeably dry, crunchy finish...speaking of crunchy, more hoppy than expected; lactic and sweet flavors dominate--pleasing to the palate...overall, a nuanced, balanced, swiftly emptying kind of stout...."

"Gorgeous head. The kind that when someone else orders it makes you wish you got that instead. Lots of spicy rye on the nose. Follows through on the first sip. Very smooth, from nitro, but at the  price of overall body. Decent stout, but not a particularly big one. Drinkable, and goes down very easily; traits enhanced by being dry as opposed to the cloying sweetness some big stouts can have and by the slight bitterness that makes you want to return to the glass frequently."

"O: An average brew."

"Medium thin bodied with lowish carbonation and a very smooth and creamy overall mouthfeel. Quite a good Irish stout that takes the ""dry"" designation seriously."
""
""
"Overall - While it is a pretty tasty nitro-dry Irish stout it is nothing too spectacular. It’s worth a try, but nothing to go out of your way for."

"Dark brown in appearance with a finger of head and some nice retention and lacing. Very mild nose. The taste is smooth, but very, very thin. There is a mild roasted bitterness on the finish, but not enough to pick this effort up out of the doldrums. Simply put: bland."

"Great price, great taste and relatively locally brewer beer. Could use a tad more body, by I'm really diggin the aftertaste. Worth trying for sure."
""
"The very low ABV almost makes it worthless to really drink though."

"really showed a tremendous amount of promise. Dark as night with a rich and creamy tan head that rose up from the bottom and settled down very nicely along the top of the glass. Bu that was about the best it would get. Too light of a n aroma, as roasted malts and chocolate notes seem to be horribly off balance. Hints of coffee maybe? But it all seemed to be a bit of a mess for me to be honest. Smooth, even carbonation on a somewhat mellow profile, needed a bit more of a punch to really be anything worthwhile to me. Roasted chocolate, hints of tobacco, a light sweetness, but again it really all seemed terribly off balance to me"
"O- overall it does not have enough going on, flavors need to be more assertive to pull off the lack of acidity from going nitro. Easily drinkable, but the primary flavor is the char which isn't really satisfying. Overall it is a pleasant beer but nothing stands out as extraordinary."
"Poured into a signature glass, pitch black with a finger of dense, creamy, tan head. Roasted malts in the aroma with just a hint of coffee. Taste of more roasted malts, a bit of coffee for bitterness, and really not much else. Pretty smooth, but not full-bodied enough for a stout. Nice and creamy on nitro though as long as the head lasts. Fairly drinkable."
"The nitro tap is always awesome, the beer pours much like a Guinness Draught. The color is a deep brownish black with a really nice creamy brown head on it thats sticky and laces pretty well. The aromas are lightly roasted slight smooth creamy aromas too. The taste is very smooth kind of on the flat side but the nitro makes it that way. The mouthfeel is very light and easy to drink. This is a pretty good attempt at an Irish Stout."
"D - This was a good Irish stout and the mouthfeel keeps the body from being heavy so it's easier to have more than one of these...the lower ABV also adds to the drinkability"
"Overall I thought it was a good beer that is perfect for after a meal or with some desert."
"Overall-dynamite Irish Stout, great sessioner, obviously knocks the big boys out of the park. Excellent job"
"d: I had high hopes for this, I'll definitely try it again elsewhere if I see it."
"O'Reilly's Irish Stout by Sly Fox is pretty much all one would ask for in a dry Irish Dry Stout. This beer, served on nitrogen, carefully poured at Local 44, is pitch black with a fluffy, 2.5 inches of beige meringue foam. The beer has just a faint wisp of chalky roasted grain. This beer tastes almost perfect. It is plenty dry with flavorful espresso and dark chocolate roasted flavors. The hop bitterness strong and a bit surprising considering the mellow hop flavors in Guiness, but it works well with the creamy, silky mouthfeel, accentuating the dryness of the beer. This is a pleasure to drink and at 3.6%, it is very easy to keep going with it all night long. The only thing was that the roasted grain and bitterness from hops made this just a bit too astringent, but overall, fantastic."
"Roasted smokiness with some chocolaty coffee. Not bad."
"Pours a deep amber, almost black in color with a creamy white head. In the aroma, a faint roasty malt. In the taste, grassy and a small dry roasty malt. A smooth and light bodied mouthfeel, with a dry, small bitter aftertaste. Quite thin, and lacking in flavor and aroma."
"Overall I don't love this stout, but it's not bad for a low ABV beer, but I don't love it either."
"A very solid stout! I've been in the mood for a good creamy stout and now I'm very satisfied."
"Drinkability maybe a bit heavier for the summer days but definetly on a nice cool and cold day. Very easy to put a few down."
"D- I ordered this because it has a low ABV and I was driving, so it has that going for it. While good I don't see myself having another but will get it from time to time. Having it off the nitro tap, I don't see having it any other way would suffice."
"D - I would be content w/ one since the roasted flavors and hops overpower the beer and nitrogen is not my favorite form of delivery. This is just ok in my book and compared to guiness it is a toss up personally. I think for the abv it has a lot going on."
"Taste comes across as watery. Not nearly the flavor I was expecting based on the wonderful aroma. Easy to drink but need a little more uuuumph! One dimensional to the roasted side and continues to have a watery element to it."
"6/4/6/3/13 (3.2/5)"
"D: Over the top in drinkability -- relatively light but nice in feel and with good flavors. Easily quaffed. A good substitute for Guinness, though my friend who drinks Guinness almost exclusively found it a tad bit too dry for his liking. Me, I prefer that dryness. Worth checking out."
"""That's brown sugar... the wet kind, not the dry kind."""
"A good Irish Stout from a local brewery does well!!! Rich dark chocolate brew that poured a hefty head that lasted the entire pint! Nose of coffee and malts...medium mouthfeel, not too heavy, not too light, just a nice stout. It was served at room temp, the way stouts should be served."
"Not highly recommended..."
"Normally one of my favorites."
"Tried this last weekend at the Blind Tiger in NYC. Dark brown color, slight head. The smell didn't do much for me. As for the taste, it was a nice stout, but it had nothing that really stood out. It was a good beer, but it did not make me want to order another. With so many choices at the Blind Tiger, I was a bit let down with my first choice. Oh well."
"drinkability: just bitter enough to make it crisp, and with very little carbonation this becomes a stellar session beer."
"As far as their claim of beating out Guinness or Murphy's in a taste test, well I'm not sure who was tested, but it certainly wasn't me."
"The overall drinkability was good. I enjoyed my second pint more than the first. Smooth and slightly creamy. I would drink this beer if I was in a bar that had it on tap but probably would not seek it out again in a growler. I recommend trying it but dont expect to be blown away."
"D: Very good per style, incredibly clean and smooth going down."
"While the style is not mine, at least by birth, this is a brew I will seek out every time I am home to visit."
"I bid you peace!"
"D- Light body made it very easy drinking, but the lingering aftertaste was a slight turn off."
"I was able to try this Sly Fox brew on tap at High Street Bar & Grill on 1/20/08. They poured it into a Sly Fox American pint glass. The beer had a beautiful jet black color with a long lasting silky 1 inch head of beige foam. It looked good enough to eat. It had a faint aroma of roasted malts, dark chocolate, and a pinch of sweet caramel at the end. The taste was dry (no duh!) with dark roasted malts, a splash of sweet caramel, a hint of bitter dark chocolate, a pinch of herbs, and then all of this ended with some dried roasted bitter hops. The mouthfeel was light and dry with a faint aftertaste of dried roasted malts and dried roasted hops. Even though the aftertaste was faint, the dryness of the roasted flavors lingered on for a few minutes. It wasn't the best Irish Stout I've had, but it was still a good one even though the aroma was faint and it seemed like the flavors needed to come out just a little bit more."
"In fairness I need to give this beer another shot, if it were the first beer of an evening I am sure it's profile would have been different. As it stands right now I will have to say that this is not a bad beer, but it is undistinguished."
"Gave this brew a try the other night while over at the Royersford. The brew was served in a nice imperial pint glass with the etching of OReillys on the side. One thing that I must say is that they do a good job serving their brews in the appropriate glassware. Had a very dark black color with a think, creamy, tan head that head great retention and left a lot of lacing through out. The aromas where of burnt grain with some coffee and chocolate highlights. The flavors seemed to mimic the aroma highlights but a coffee bitterness really came through which was nice being mixed with chocolate flavors. Had a very nice creamy feel and finished dry which is expected. Overall this is a good brew, would be excellent on a cooler evening."
"Overall a very tasty dry stout. A nice fresh allternative to Guinness."
"This is a nice beer overall. I'd like to try it as a non-nitro pour. I bet it'd accentuate some aromas and flavours and bring a fuller overall experience to this one. Still, no complaints about how this one pours now. Recommended."
"When they handed this pint to me I thought they poured me a Guinness. Has a very typical dry stout look and feel but has a very smokey flavor to it."
"All three pints I got of this beer poured beautifully: a pint of darkness with a finger of tan head that gets tired of leaving rings about halfway down and simply coated the bottom half of the glass entirely with foam. Remarkable retention (I'm remarking on it, ain't I?). Smelled primarily of roasted and sweet malts as well as dark grain and some floral and bitter hops Tasted great - creamy roasted malt and barley with a bit of bitterness and a great dry finish. The mouthfeel was fantastic; I could have stayed drinking this beer all night. It's got a nice body, very creamy going down, and then it all dries up. Textbook. Better than Guinness. Hooray!"
"For my money, this is what many of the more ubiquitous Irish stouts strive to be. It's got the deep roasted grain character nicely balanced by a bitter-sweet edge and well-proportioned hops. The result is a relatively light, quick-flowing drinkable quaff. Keep that flavor on my palate for jkust a bit longer, and I'd drink this over all but a handful of beers. And that ABV, wee laddie that it is, means you're never going to want to one-and-done this brew. So, guys, maybe we'll want to bottle this one soon, hmmm?"
"Excellent stout."
"Nice dark beer with an off-white head. Lots of toffee and coffeee in the nose. The taste seems watered down, everything you get in the nose, just less of it. Has a slight metalic taste to it too, possibly form the keg. Rather heavy mouthfeel. The finish is again watered down, but still bitter."
"It poured out dark with a thick, white head that remained almost to the last drop. The aroma was full of roastiness, but the first sip revealed bitter hops balanced by a coffee flavor. My favorite part was the mouthfeel: a delectable creaminess that had the texture of milk (but without the heavy lactose taste.) Drinkability was slow for me- by the time I drank the pint dry, my dinner partner was finished his second beer. This is a stout to savor and enjoy, not to pound."
"Served as dark brown beer with massive frothy white head (as would be expected) Left a coating on the entire glass as it was consumed. Smell is of a light coffee, chocolate texture. Taste is dry, coffee, chocolate and very enjoyable. Finishes with a good creamy mouthfeel and a dry bitterness. Perfect session beer with perfect drinkability."
"Black with ruby highlights, topped by a very dense tan head. This beer had superb retention and left thick sheets of lace on the glass. Gorgeous. Plenty of roasty dark grain in the nose, not quite to the point of coffee though. Some milk chocolate too. Mild hop bitterness, but this was supplemented a bit by the dark grains. Plenty of chocolate and roast flavour with a bit of hop character as well. Quite dry, but with a pleasant sweetness. There's some nuttiness as it warms as well. Light body with very low carbonation, some creaminess and some astringency. A fine Irish stout, an obvious session beer."
"The flavor is really clean and easy drinking. With the nitro and at 3.2%, I could easily drink this one all night long."
"A rich thick dark brown head over opaque black liquid. Roasty chocolatey nose, with flavors of roasted barley with little malt sweetness, light coffee, some hops. Very smooth going down and a pleasure to drink as it seemed very fresh. An unexpected treat to find it on tap."
"Pours nearly black, not overly thick as that wouldn't fit the style but with a solid thick ivory head. Rich, malty and chocolatey aroma. Flavors run wild, which is rare for this often-copied style that often turns out bland and flavorless, especially when served on nitro. Coffee, chocolate, and big toasted almond and walnut flavors meld into an extremely mild hoppy bitter finish, complemented by a slight sugar sweetness. As smooth and creamy as they come. Forget everything you think you know about Irish Dry Stouts (ie Guinness, though I do love her) and try this. It's available in quite a few places and seems to be more available than any other Sly Fox offering. Drinkable by the bucketful."
"Quite a nice example of an Irish dry stout. Nitro pour with a cascade of a rich head of tiny bubbles. Dark black color, smell is hard to make out in the bar, but it smelled kind of roasty. For a 3.6 dry stout, this has quite a bit of flavor. Roasted malt wtih some chocolate and coffee flavors. Mouthfeel is typically nitro smooth. They have this and Guiness on tap at Grace. Why anyone would ever choose Guiness over this one, I have no idea. It's nice and drinkable with just enough flavor to keep it interesting."
"Pretty good example of the style. Not among the best stouts I've had but certainly a solid beer. Poured on a slow nitro pour into a imperial pint glass. Looks pretty much like a Guinness and is dark as night. Smell is fairly non-existent although some roasted malts are present. Taste is kinda subdued cause of the nitro, but is dominated by roasted malts, bakers chocolate and a nice clean slightly hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is full and rich up front, a tad thin in the end. Very drinkable at only 3.6% ABV with a nitro pour. I give them credit for not just creating a generic brew-pub stout."
"On Nitro Tap at Grace. This is an absolutely amazing dry irish stout, probably the best one that I have sampled thus far in my beer tasting exploits. This is a beautiful looking beer. Opaque black in colour with a lovely tan/khaki head that lasts for ages. The aromas are awesome! Roasted malts, dark chocolate, espresso, caramel, a bit of vanilla, and more. Wow, this is like a Rogue Shakespeare stout stuffed into the frame of a 3.6%abv dry irish stout! The taste is roasty, with some lovely chocolate and coffee notes and the mouthfeel is thick creamy and awesome. Drinkability I hear you ask? Awesome as well! And at 3.6%ABV you can drink this all night and not worry about the next morning! My first beer from Sly Fox, and it has made a big impression!"
"Drinkability: very drinkable as the flavor is strong and it is lighter in body for a stout."
"The beer pours a deep black color with a creamy off-white head. The aroma is good. It has a dry black malt scent. It seems a bit heavy on roasted and patent malts. The taste is good. It is dominated with black patent and roasted malts. It finishes dry, but with good mouthfeel. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine stout. It has a good malt makeup and mouthfeel."
"Many a brewpub has tried to emulate the dry stouts of erin's isle, but this one has finally pulled it off! It's the perfect dry Irish stout served via nitrogen carbonation and dispense; and it rivals Beamish, Murphy's, and Guinness. There's not much in the nose (as to style!), but it's soft and creamy in the mouth due to the soft carbonation and densely creamy head due to the nitrogen breakout. It doesn't have the lightly sour tang of Guinness, but it does offers a touch more bittersweet chocolate than most which gives it a bit of a unique edge. It's roasty with a thin bit of malt underneath, and backed by a solid bitterness in the 40 to 50 IBU range. It's light body lends to its drinkability; and it finishes short and dry. An impressive rendition of the style, and an excellent 'end of the night' beer that offers alot of flavor with a limited alcohol - although it's equally at home as a session beer for the evening. Quite nice!"
"Wow what a pour,pours a pitch black with a great creamy head that leaves some real nice lacing,smells very dry and earthy.The taste is dry and earthy with some unsweetened chocolate under tones.A real complex dry stout,very enjoyable,first time trying,wil be sure to get again."
"This is probably the biggest surprise for me from sly fox. Dark black in color with a thick creamy nitro head. Aroma is of roasted coffee. Taste is chocolate with some coffee as well. Whenever I order a dry stout I never expect anything more than guinness, but this was fantastic."
"Its yummy."
"Rich thick tan head. Dark opaque look. The lasting thick creamy head does impress. Not much nose to speak of.. just a whisp of roast in the back of the throat. Very roasty malty taste with hints of expresso on the back of the tongue. Dry toasty finish left on the tongue. A solid Dry Stout.. the only area it was lacking was in the nose."
"Pours an opaque black with some light mahogany hues. Head is quite creamy and looks very much like a Guinness. I was very pleased to find the beer to have a much more complex flavor profile than ye 'old Guin. Flavors ranged from a bittersweet chocolate to coffee to a nice underlying roastiness. Mouthfeel was creamy and on the light side, but was still very pleasing."
"Pours an opaque black with slight ruby or mahogany highlights. The head is decent; light tan in color, dense and very creamy, lasts all the way through. On the nose the aroma was deep roastiness, bittersweet chocolate, coffee flavorsall of the same can also be found in the flavor, coffee, chocolate, roastiness, slight bitternessmouthfeel is super creamy and smooth. The is very comparable to a Beamish, a very good dry stout"
