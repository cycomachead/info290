3.56,-3.8,3.5,3,4,3.25,3.5,"16 ounce can. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. Aroma is nice but very light, it smells like roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate and coffee. The brew tastes like roasted malt, coffee, burnt/charred malt, and some dark chocolate and earthiness. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and has medium/high carbonation. I thought this was a good tasting brew, although the weak aroma didn't exactly impress me. It's worth trying. $3.99 for a single can.","bluejacket74","May 07, 2014"

Tasty brew to some, but for me this ends with an "ehhhh... if you aren't going to drink it..." sort of feel. I think the beer is missing something... just cannot put my finger on it. I think whatever this recipe is should be experimented with. Some interesting ingredients like white peppercorns (or if this was the base for a chili pepper beer) would be really exciting.","ahommell","Mar 12, 2014"

4.53,22.4,4.5,4,4.5,5,5,"(On tap at Tomlinson Tap Room) Actually called an Irish Brown Stout, this was a great beer. Excellent dark brown coloring with fantastic head and very nice lacing. Nice deep malty scent with excellent roasted grains, but not an overkill of coffee or chocolate. Excellent flavor, with a great hit of dark roasted grains, a slight hint of chocolate, and a nice neutral hop finish. Goes down very, very smoothly, with a nice dry finish. Excellent brew!","JamesS","0"
