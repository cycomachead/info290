3.45,2.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"A pretty solid black coffee colored brew with a very modest off-white circle of thin bubblage on top and decent traces of lace. The aroma suggests a woodsy skunk malt with a roasted peat edge. Not bad. The taste brings on a thin, harsh charcoal with bitter cider mash malt. Some grassy ash tray ideas here. Not bad but the body is closer to light with a very thin, aqueous feel and very little carbonation. Good but not great.","Durge","Jul 24, 2012"

The taste was of burnt coffee and acidified chocolate.Also, a touch too sweet for a dry stout. It actualy tastes somehow weak bodied,as if you were to take a very old batch of Murphy's or Guinness and add 10% more water! Slightly bitey aftertaste.","CaptJackHarkness","May 23, 2012"

A smooth taste, creamy, strong coffee flavors, on a rather smokey malty backbone. Very nice full flavor, stays on the tongue. Overall a very solid dry stout, enjoyable and different from the market favor Guinness.","vette2006c5r","May 01, 2012"

3.72,10.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Drinkability - This, overall, is a solid Stout. Worth a try if available and if you are a Stout fan. Solid all around. I could set a few back relatively easy. I would drink it again if it was offered.","Shrews629","Aug 17, 2010"
3.3,-1.8,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"This did not hit the mark for an Irish dry - more English than Irish. Color was dark black, but a bit thin as light penetrated around the edges. No creamyness to the mouthfeel or the dryness associated with the style. A tad watery, with distinct coffee notes and an undercurrent of slight oxidation.","Brent","Aug 16, 2010"
3.43,2.1,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Thanks to my friend Dave for sharing a bottle. Overall I'd say this is an accurate interpretation of the style. It has appropriate body and bitterness when many American-made "Irish stouts" are too heavy and chocolatey. However, the flavor is pretty tame. It finishes with the traditional black coffee and roast bitterness, but upfront there's just a mellow, smooth sweetness that emphasizes the blandness. Like I said, the finish is spot on and there's a lovely mild mocha aftertaste, but overall the character is lacking and I think I'm picking up hints of oxidation.","tempest","Jul 27, 2010"

2.21,-34.2,3.5,2.5,2,3,1.5,"Dark brown pour with two fingers of head that dies quickly. Aroma is quite acrid and oddly nutty. Tough to describe really. The flavor is along the same lines...only worse. An odd acrid nuttiness, burnt sugar, lip gloss. The body is light and watery. Overall this is just a poor beer.","alcstradamus","Jun 04, 2010"
3.29,-2.1,2.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into a tumbler glass. The liquid is very dark and opaque, but I can see some bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass. The head is thin, tan, and made up of small bubbles. It disappeared almost immediately. The aroma is slightly sweet, but mostly smells like burnt embers and toasted malts. It's not great, but I like it. There is a lot of roasted malt to the flavor and some coffee bitterness. It is very pronounced and lingers for a while after I swallow. The beer has a medium body. There isn't much of a coating, so the beer feels watery. The carbonation is very low; it's lower than I would like it. Overall, the beer goes down well enough, but it doesn't have any outstanding characteristics to make it stand out amongst the many beers in this style that are available to me. I wouldn't turn one of these beers down if offered to me, but I don't think I'll buy one again.","ToasterChef","Jun 03, 2010"
3.77,12.2,3.5,4,4,3,3.5,"The nose is nice and roasty with simple straightforward coffee and chocolate notes. The taste follows suit but adds some crisp bittering bite into the mix, definitely highly drinkable but not as light and airy as Guinness.","LucienDeRubempre","May 26, 2010"
2.3,-31.5,3,3,2,2,2,"D: I'm trying very hard to find something positive about this beer but it's not easy. It pours with a nice head and has some pleasant, if simple, aromas, but the taste and mouthfeel leave much to be desired.","jhoban19","May 22, 2010"

Tastes like there were some quality control issues on this beer. I may re-review at a later time if I have some in the future, but don't hold your breath. Even with the quality control issues, there are better dry stouts out there. Skip over this one and just pick up a six pack of OTR.","bevenson","Apr 24, 2010"

3.99,18.8,3,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Appropriately named, let's give it a whirl. Twist off top but I pop it with an opener. Bottle smell yields milk chocolate and fine Colombian coffee. Pours to dark brown brew that lets only a shimmer of light, of any, through. Head is consistently medium bubble and light tan. Taste is a burnt chocolate with a sweetness and a slight bitterness that accompanies well but doesn't override the toasted malts. A very tasty selection. Lots of flavor for a 4.7% ABV. I like the dry finish and the lack of heavy weight. I would seek this out over all macro stouts any day of the week.","mooseisloose","Apr 11, 2010"
2.72,-19,3,3.5,2.5,2,2.5,"Poured this one into a pint glass and headed out to the patio. The color resembled pure black coffee with a light brown head. Head was gone quick. The beer almost looked flat half way through. Smells of chocolate coupled with a certain smokiness or roastiness (not sure if that's a word). Those aromas fell right into the taste. It felt very bubbly almost over carbonated at certain parts. Not to sure what's up with that. A sweet, dry aftertaste. Not a beer I will seek out again in the future but maybe it was just do to the whole mouthfeel issue.","zebco","Mar 29, 2010"

3.63,8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I got this as part of a BOTMC. I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. Pours an obsidian color with a 2 finger white head, no lacing. It has a burnt coffee aroma, with a little sweetness. Mild coffee flavor throughout, leaves a mild charcoal flavor, not as bad as it sounds. It finishes dry. A bit thin, really don't think they added many oats. The carbonation is good and it is easy drinking. While I would not seek this one out, it is a decent brew.","bonkers","Mar 20, 2010"
3.69,9.8,3.5,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Not bad overall -- highlight is definitely the smell, like nothing I'd smelled before. Decent enough drinker, I might have a few in a row if given the chance.","OneDropSoup","Beers"
3.39,0.9,3,4,3.5,2.5,3,"The mouthfeel is slightly creamy with a slightly above average amount of carbonation for a stout. Also seems a little on the thin side compared to more favorable brews.

3.59,6.8,2,3,4,3.5,4,"This is a very light, thin and crisp stout; not sure it fits the dry stout category well as it's like a stout light. The mouthfeel is very light and almost watery with crisp carbonation which borders on champagne-like and makes this brew extremely drinkable. A good stout for anyone who really enjoys an easy flowing and relatively tasty stout. I enjoyed how light this beer was, as well as how easy it was to drink. If Guinness sets the stout standard, then this beer can run with the pack since it had good flavor and went down very easy.","CHickman","Mar 15, 2010"

3.55,5.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Poured from a cellar-temperature bottle into a standard pint glass. Thin tan head quickly dissipates into a lacy skim over this black opaque brew. The smell is of roasted coffee or espresso, with a hint of vanilla and perhaps oak. The vanilla flavor really comes forth in the flavor, and the coffee moves into the finish with a hint of sweetness. The coffee flavor lingers pleasantly in the mouth. There is very little bitterness to this beer, just enough to add some pleasant complexity. Carbonation is light and just right, but the mouthfeel is less creamy than I frequently encounter in a stout. Overall, this is a tasty stout - not the best stout I've ever had, but one which I wouldn't mind having many of.","Ladybugger","Dec 18, 2009"
2.53,-24.7,3,2.5,2.5,1.5,3,"My prevailing perception of this beer was "ZZZzzz." It was quite boring, even for an Irish Dry Stout. A frequent discussion thread on this sight and others is "good gateway beer for a Bud/Miller/Coors drinker," and I would nominate this beer. That is not intended as a compliment. This beer is black, but beyond that is about as interesting as a Bud Light. Flavor and aroma is minimal, and mouthfeel is dominated by a thin watery character. This beer is really uninteresting, but I guess there is nothing really offensive about it. Still, I can't say I'd recommend it.","BeerBelcher","Nov 22, 2009"
3.15,-6.3,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Reviewed 8/21/09. Bottle. Pours brown with a small light tan head. Aroma of sweet malt, coffee, roasted malt. Flavor is mostly just sweet roasted malt, some coffee notes remain but the palate is rather watery and thin. A good beer for Lion Brewery I guess. I didn't dislike it as much as some of the previous raters.","LilBeerDoctor","Sep 24, 2009"
3.27,-2.7,3,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,"Ebony with rosewood highlights and a wispy tan head that fades quickly to a film. Nice roasted malt and a touch of caramel in the nose. Nice roasty flavors up front with vanilla and a coffee like bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is the low point of this beer and is downright watery. An easy drinking lightweight stout.","biggred1","Sep 17, 2009"

3.5,4.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a lightly hazy dark orange, brownish, thin off white head forms, settles to a thin ring around the glass, few lace spots, looks okay. Smell is light and biscuity, light chocolate, bread, not much going on here, brown sugar and a bit of molasses, alright aroma. Taste is similar, just very light, toasty and biscuity, quite sweet, some raisin, chocolate, light roast, weak but some decent flavours. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low carbonation, pretty drinkable but just not very exciting. Thanks Craig!","Viggo","Aug 12, 2009"
2.74,-18.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Pours a very dark, reddish brown with hardly any tan-colored head that reduces to nothing very quickly. It looks like Coke, really. Sweet coffee aromas dominate the nose, but are also supported by a malty sweetness. This is very slick and quite light in body. The taste is fairly sweet and thin but with a good bit of coffee essence, particularly in the finish. Carbonation seems very low and feels like it was left out or not finished conditioning. The foam is a lost cause as I can't even swirl it enough to get any back. The detectable flavors here are good ones, but there's really no depth or complexity to make this a quality stout. Quite unimpressive overall and I really don't expect to come back to this one.","cdpike","Jul 24, 2009"

3.46,3,2.5,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both low. The aroma is nice. It's very malty, it smells like caramel, roasted/charred malt, chocolate and coffee. Taste is similar to the aroma, but it's not as strong. There's also a bit of a nutty taste in this brew. Mouthfeel/body is light, but it's way too thin and watery for a stout. Not much carbonation. Drinkability is decent, even though it's thin it's still easy to drink. I'd try this again in the future, but I certainly wouldn't seek this beer out. There's plenty of other stouts I'd rather drink.","bluejacket74","Jun 03, 2009"

3.42,1.8,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Easy drinker. The light body certainly helps in that regard, but it also detracts from it's drinkability. All in all, it's an interesting dry stout, even though it falls short in a few categories. Hey, I'll take it over a Guinness!","Gyle41386","May 08, 2009"
2.97,-11.6,3,3.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,"Drinkability: It's no friend of mine! It really lacks in the mouthfeel and body department.

The generally light body makes for an easy drinking experience, but not a very enticing one.","ChainGangGuy","May 05, 2009"
3.57,6.3,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Bottle in trade as a bonus from RoyMunson. Thanks man! Pours mostly black, letting through a touch of light and leaving a short lived beige head. Smell is of roasted nuts, chocolate and hint of smoky caramel. Nice smelling beer. Taste is nutty, chocolatey and with very darkly toasted malts. Comes off more like a rich brown ale, than a stout, but the flavor is still nice. A bit thin bodywise, and the carbonation is normal. Solid brew all around.","JDV","May 04, 2009"

As far as drinkability, this is one I'd buy again....however, I'm rarely in the mood for Irish style stouts....For all the braging the Irish do (stereotype) about drinking and drinking stouts and real beer-meaning their stouts-the style of stout developed in Ireland is really quite a pansy, in comparison to Russian Imperial Stouts, American Double stouts, and even Milk Stouts.","becktone","Apr 14, 2009"
