"This was a terrible beer."
"The darkest and most expensive glass of water I've ever had."

"i dont know why people seem to like this less, as irish stouts go, this is a winner, especially on the nitro tap. seen a few handles pop up for saint patricks day this week. its gorgeous from the tap, lighter than guinness in color, but with a similar head on it. the nose is light, i smell the dank irish yeast before i smell anything else, wet and musty and old in a good way. like the weather there. the malt is really light for its color, almost no body at all to this, i remember it being fuller for whatever reason, but it seems really really thin this go around. its creamy from the nitro, but its almost watered down in feel, not palate coating at all. at such a light body and low abv, this is a beer you could just pound on all day, and i probably would if i was part of the downtowny kegs and eggsy crowd, but thats just not me. not much flavor to it, i mean, its like a hlaf a stout, its good, no off tastes, but it doesnt taste like much. like roast without substance, which actually is kind of confusing and pleasant. milky feeling and super dry, i think its made well in that regard, and offers a nice alternative to the obvious, when thats the kind of beer you want to drink. i have no issues with this at all, and apparently like it a lot better than others have. strange on the palate to have it be so light but so creamy and thick at the same time, its thick and thin, cant think of many other beers that do that..."

"Goes down so smooth like chocolate milk.  Isn't going to knock your socks off but a solid Irish dry stout."

"Light body, watery really, perky effervescence. A pretty solid copy of Guinness for what that is worth."

"On tap (nitro) at DBGB (NYC), served in a 470 mL shaker pint. Deep, dark brown black with a thick, nitro head and good layers of lace. Good roasted nose and taste with dry finish; doesn't betray its low ABV. Silky smooth, medium to light body and fine nitro carbonation. Very drinkable; nicely complemented raw oysters."

"There's a bit of a berry taste to the deeply roasted malts. This would be a mellow dry stout for the Irish. It's good but certainly not bold flavor wise. Some cream. The body is neutral for the style and the ""carbonation"" is high for a nitro."

"Overall, this is a delightful beer. I would highly recommend it to any lovers of stout!"
"Had this on tap at the Liberty Bar on West 35th street in Manhattan. It was the tale of 2 beers. Initially, I had thought that I got a poor pour, as the brew had barely settled by the time it was presented to me and had a huge head, about 1/4 of the glass. In retrospect, the pour was the best part. Not only did it look fantastic, with the light brown head contrasted with the dark (very dark) brown body, but the head was the best tasting part as well. I always enjoy a nice thick head, especially when it comes to stouts. This did not dissapoint in that area. It was thick and creamy and extremely tasty head, with dark notes of chocolate/coffee sweetness coming through. It was particularly nice once I broke through the head to get to the actual brew, which when paired with the head in a single sip was a very pleasant experience. Unfortunately, that's where it ended. Once the head was gone and I was left with only body, it turned itself into a thin and average tasting stout."
"The taste has some malt roastiness but fits the style with low sweetness in the flavor adding some depth with a light yeast quality with some mineral dryness into the finish. Overall I enjoyed this pretty decent dry stout, suitable for sessioning. I think this is more of a guinness alternative for brewpub patrons but fits the style well."

"The body is on par for nitro. Finishes dry and helps that roasty black malt note that comes out. Silky feel. Overall not a big fan of nitro but this is pretty really good overall. Malt comes out despite the nitro. Would like a bit cleaner and more body/depth."
""
""
""
""

"This is a super light bodied brew with a modest amount of that silky smooth nitro feel. But this is very watery in the feel even by irish stout standards. It is lacking quite a bit in body and character but was a pleasant unique offering that I would probably have again."

"O-a very nice easy drinking beer. Very watery. Sadly not better than Gunniess. Not bad though."

"O â€“ This is an average brew to me. It is very drinkable for sure but there is nothing in the taste that grabs me and wants me to drink more. Not bad but not memorable."
"Since it's on nitro aromatics were quite light but i definitly could smell roasted malts and anise. taste was bold and smooth with a good creamy texture. A desent malt backbone greets you with a gentle puckering in the aftertaste. I've been jones for this brew quite a while and was worthy of the wait."

"A little disappointing right from the start. Poured into an imperial pint, a weak little tan head that lacked the creaminess and cascading beauty of a typical nitro pour. Bad line? Otherwise, typical dark opaque brown-blackitude of an average stout. Aroma of dark malts, notes of coffee and a dab of solvent. Similar taste, roasty, dark malts, touches of coffee and chocolate. Mild and a bit thin in body. A decent stout, but nothing to write a review about. ... D'oh!"
""
"An excellent representative of the Irish Dry Stout style and I'm very glad I tried it when I had the chance."
""
""
""
""
"Overall even though this was not on nitro I believe it was still quite a good session stout. Worth the 3 bucks."
"Tastes of dark chocolate and bitter, earthy hops with a light roastiness. Charred malt and a surprisingly smoky flavor approaching a Rauch style; what was merely hinted at in the nose emerges prominently in the tasting. Finishes quite dryly. Moderately thin bodied with smooth carbonation. Very creamy, goes down extremely easily. Quite a good take on an Irish Dry Stout."
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, very mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice sessionable stout to drink for a while."
""
""
"*from notes (5-25-12)"
""
""
""
"O - I have yet to fall in love with this style and this beer is yet another setback. I feel like the nitro version of these stout just come off as a little too subtle with a rather watery mouthfeel as well. I'll keep trying, but I wouldn't get this one again."
""
""
""
""
"This is far and away the best irish stout I have ever had. Much props to the great brewers at Victory."
"Taste is smooth with some very nice tobacco and licorice notes. A very creamy mouthfeel somewhat watery and light, but true to the style."

"This is a nice Irish Dry Stout but overall it's underwhelming. If it were St. Patty's I could see me putting in work on this beer. Otherwise, I'll pass."
""
""
"Overall not great, way too light, very little malt or stout flavors at all, thin and watery, and what there is for flavor is overpowered by the nitro. at least I can drink this like chocolate milk and pound it."

"Pours a very dark brown with a very impressive reverse-cascading mocha head and good retention. The nose carries some very light roast and a touch of chocolate. Nothing too complex, but I wasn't expecting too much. Flavor falls a bit flat after the nose, with just a bit of roast and not much else. Medium body with a nice nitro feel. Pretty good, though below Victory standards for me."

"Taste was great, a light roasted barley and charcoal with hint of dry dark chocolate, light woody bitterness to balance a very light sweetness. It had nice well-rounded body, and a great, solid feel, esp. for such low abv, etc."

"Outstanding in every aspect. This dry stout coming in @ 3.7%ABV is everything I could ever want for this style. Very high whole hop flavor (EKG I assume) for style, without the typical roasted malt bitterness normally present. I can't say enough about this offering from Victory. They are my darling East Coast Brewery, and they should be yours too!"
"Great smooth carmely, roasty finish. Good drinkability that one would not guess from the sheer blackness (which is not pitch black but the darkest of dark brown)"
"O: One of the better Dry Stouts I have had. Not an ovely complext beer, but a great session beer."
"O - Cant complain. Good Irish dry stout. Honestly havent had many but Guinness but this one doesnt dissapoint. I enjoy it more than Guinness. Well done Victory."
"This beer pours with the characteristic cascading head of a nitro tap. It is a bit light around the edges though which is not too great. Aroma is mildly roasty with a nice little bit of coco. Pretty nice. Flavor is a bit on the light side, but the coco comes out s bit more with a mild bitterness. Mouthfeel was pretty on point for the style, maybe a bit more dryness, but is good nonetheless with the creaminess from the nitro. Pretty good enjoyable approachable stout."
"A simple, undefined, uninteresting dry stout."
"This beer poured out like a Guinness. The surge took a little while to finish. The head is creamy and thick, the color of the beer is a deep brown. The smell is light, not much on the nose just a slight roasted aroma. The taste is very smooth and has a nice light chocolatey flavor to it. The mouthfeel is light and slick, nitro makes this brew very smooth. Oveall it's a good Dry Stout, typical for the style, really nice."
"Back to trivia. Before they were stars. I suck at this. But I just won a free beer for knowing it's abv the fastest. Beeradvocacy proves good for something!"
"O - Great stout! I'm glad it's on tap 1/2 a block from my house. Very drinkable, very smooth...I could drink this all night long."
"D - This one is uber-sessionable as this one packs a lot of flavor into 3.7% ABV... Great appearance with nice flavor and aroma all while being able to drink several glasses... Another nice job by the folks at Victory... I'm shocked it took me so long to sample..."
"This is a session stout all the way. Nice to have such from Victory with out the usual extra hop profile. Dark, beautiful pour - settled into a classic creamy nitro head. Great aroma of roast grains, hint of coffee and cocoa. Taste of the same, slight sweetness, and all at 3.7%. Nice to have a stout with lunch and not feel wiped out afterwards. Very drinkable, wish I could find this more often."
"*note for nitpickers, this is indeed less than 4% and I do mean I'd like to see more <4%abv beers like this."
"Taste is very creamy and smooth, the mouthfeel is phenomenal. Very toasty and a bit grainy. No hoppiness but perfect for the style. Surprising good."
"O: Overall a real let down. The watery nature of it just ruined the beer for me."
"O: In the old drinkability category this would get a solid 4.5. Overall it's a good beer, I think the serving style is hampering the impact of the flavours, give me this on cask or even regular draft and allow the flavours to come out more. That being said it's still a very easy drinking pint, but there's not a lot to differentiate it from Guinness at this point."
"Very light taste. Drinks easy. Some chocolate and nuts, light toast. Creamy/milky. Like an unsalted top (rye) saltine."
"On tap at Milltown in Carrboro.Poured from the nitro tap jet black with a cascading beige head that settled into a creamy froth after awhile.Some dark roast coffee,unsweetened chocolate,and metallic aromas,pretty much spot on for the style.Creamy as suspected from the pour,flavors seem a bit light with dark roast flavors dominating,a tinge of iron in the finish.An easy quaffing nitrogen dispensed dry stout,creamy and good."
"D- really drinkable. Not a lot of alcohol at all, and just the right amount of flavor too."
"Overall, good but not great. Victory Storm (obviously a different brew) is much better to me. Solid, easy drinkng stout. Entry level if you will."
"d: Very drinkable and quite flavorful."
"This is BEER! It would be great to be able to drink this all day everyday. Perfect for what it is. Way to go Victory."
"On tap at the brewpub. Pours black with chestnut edges. Nose is bitter chocolate dust, bakers chocolate, lightly bitter, light hop bitterness. Perhaps a touch of pepper? Flavor is light, smooth, all about the half bitter bakers chocolate dust and light malts, lightly bittering finish. Well balanced, low carb, creamy in the mouth."
"Overall impression: I love Irish stouts, but this one doesn't quite hit the spot."
"I had this on nitro at the brew pub today. The pour is jet black with a full fluffy, tan head. The aroma had some chocolate and roasted notes. The flavor is roasted malts and has a light dry finish. The body is medium/light and well carbonated. Very easy drinking, I had no idea it was so low in ABV. I prefer other Irish stouts, but this is not bad."
"Ultra smooth feel with a much fuller body than you might expect, very pleasant on the tongue. Easy drinking and super low abv, making it extra sessionable. Instead of turning this into a watery, thin, boring beer, Victory preserved the body, feel, and flavor. Nice!"
"D - Easily drinkable. A true session beer that I wish was more commonly found in area bars."
"Drinkability: I like stouts, I like Irish Dry Stouts, but this one falls flat for me. Victory can brew much better beer."
"D - This is a very easy beer to drink. It's mild but still enjoyable and very refreshing."
"d - I enjoyed this irish dry stout a lot. I agree that it's a bit of a Guinness clone, though a little watered down version. Either way, I enjoy Guinness and I enjoyed this beer. Very easy to drink and I would definitely drink this again if I was looking for a session beer."
"Served to me with a big fluffy tan head and the cascading effect from the nitro was on full display. Color was black and beautiful. Smell was very heavy on the roasted side. Charred wood and subtle notes of coffee, hazelnut and chocolate. Alot of dry and bitter tannins are quickly evident on the tongue. Roasted coffee and woody flavors. Not very complex, but an enjoyable palate overall. Mouthfeel isn't as creamy as I expected and finishes very thin. Drinkability is hampered a little by the lack of complexity in the flavors, which actually got a bit tiresome. Not a terrible attempt at a dry session stout, but not a great one either."
"Much better than I had expected as I am not a typical stout drinker. This one's good."
"Served from nitro-tap into a standard pint. Pours an almost black with a one finger light tan head. Maintains decent lacing throughout. The aroma is comprised of earthy and nutty notes. The flavor is of light malt and nutty notes. It had a medium feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall I was not really a big fan of this one. It wasn't bad for a low ABV stout, but not good for being considered a stout. Basically everything needs to be a little more robust on this one and amplified."
"MF/D: Creamy, smooth, carbonation was a tiny bit prickly, but otherwise enjoyable."
"I like it. If it came in bottles around here, I'd buy it over Guinness. I'd prefer a good local example but it's certainly worth a try."
"drinkability: probably the best irish stout I have had."
"D: Goes down very easy, quite tasty, nice representation of style - damn tasty and with the ABV on this one, I could drink it all night."
"D: Drinking this beer is a breeze. It is a good beer to session if you are looking for a stout with a lot of flavor."
"I really like the fact that Victory took on the traditional Irish Dry Stout and puts its own twist on the formula. The dryness is still there, as is the drinkability, yet, a new hint of sweetness is a nice addition to the style."
"D - This is a simple, balanced beer that one could easily drink all night. It is characterized by a flat, roasted note similar to that of cheap coffee, but this darkness is enhanced by a depth of chocolate and a light nuttiness that make it much more enjoyable than the more ubiquitous examples of the style."
"My go-to session beer whenever I visit Victory - Donnybrook never disappoints. Low ABV doesn't mean no taste - it has a roasty flavor that doesn't cross over into smokiness. Decent mouthfeel and consistently good flavor. Sadly, needs nitro so I can't take home my growler filled with this."
"I actually had the bartender check to make sure there wasn't anything wrong with the tap or keg. He did and said ""Can't notice anything wrong, just a bummer beer."" His words, but I'll stand by them. This beer is nearly flavorless. Poured inky black with a healthy light-brown head that held all the flavor. Sipping through the head I got hints of a semblance of roasted, nutty malt. From there on it tastes like watered-down Guinness. This beer is thin, watery, boring and offensive for those reasons. Not sure what niche Victory was going for with this one. It's not enjoyable for Beer Geeks at Beer Bars, it's not familiar enough for the lawnmower crowd, and who on earth would buy a six pack of water-Guinness for a fireside or front porch session? Truly ""a bummer beer."" Drinks easy, though."
"Dark with a creamy head from the nitro tap. Smells of light roasted barley, it's the smell of St. Patty's Day to me. Taste is wonderful, very light bodied and clean roastiness. Obviously similar to Guinness, but a much better beer, IMO. Very light and drinkable, and at 3.7% it won't get you shit faced any time soon."
"Easy, easy drinker. Didn't realize it was so light in ABV when I had it. Tastes a bit stronger than 4%."
"Pours a rich, dark brown letting just a touch of light through. Weak, thin stip of khaki colored head. Smell is of dark roasted malts, sweetened condensed milk and roasted nuts. Taste follows scent with a sweet creamy roasted grains and nuts charachter. Body is very chalky and dry and lacks carbonation, not very pleasent in the mouth. Decent flavor, but not a very pleasing body makes for a beer that could be much better then it is."
"D: High on taste and low on alcohol this beer gets it done better than guiness I feel. Thumbs up to Victory again for this delicious beer!"
"My vote for the best Irish Stout, even better than the original from Ireland!!"
"Drink is excellent I would recommend if you are a stout lover and love to drink it in session. Then this is your beer."
"Poured a dark brown body with a one-finger offwhite head that died quickly and left minor lace. A good smell of roasted and chocolate malts, a little oakey or woody as well. A sweet, smooth, real creamy medium body that is a little chewey with a malty taste. Chocolate, roasted, a little coffee and even a hint of vanilla and caramel with a very minor dry finish. A very sessionable stout as the malts are very subdued although after a while it could get boring. Sure worth a try though."
"Poured very dark brown, almost black, with two fingers of beige head, that laced very well. The smell was bitter yet mild, with hints of roasted malt and cocoa powder. The tasted was a little more intense than the aroma, with a nice dry finish. The medium-bodied mouthfeel was exceptionally creamy, with a pleasant dry bitter finish. Exceedingly sessionable."
"I actually thought the nitro hurt this one, being so mild to begin with it would have been more flavorful on standard co2. An OUTSTANDING session beer, but not all that outstanding otherwise."
"D- This beer is exceptionally drinkable, but its mild aromas and flavors could get bland and boring after a pint."
"This was the lightest beer offered at Victry Brewing on 8/7/09. An enjoyable one to say the least."
"This stout poured black with brown foam that persisted. The smell was of coffee grounds and roasted malt. The taste was roasted malt with a hint of sweet fruit, a touch of cocoa, and very light caramel and coffee flavors. The mouthfeel was dry with medium body, but a bit thinner than expected. The carbonation was smooth. This was a smooth, easy drinking dry stout."
"The pour was nice enough, very dark brown, basically black with no light shining through on this one at all. Rich looking head of tan on the top hung around for most of the session. The aroma was a bit light. Lots of roasted malts, with just a hint of cocoa underneath it. Really dry taste, but a little bland for me. Light cocoa and roasted malts, but it lacked alot of depth to put it over the top into another cateogory. Still though it was a decent little stout with a nice feel, and a 3.5 percent very drinkable. Not sure I would go here again though."
"Don't drink and review."
"This one didn't do much for me. Poured from the tap to a dark brown with medium tan head that lingered awhile and left okay lacing. Nose and taste were botrh a faint chocolate malt and the mouthfeel was fairly flat and watery. At only 3.7% abv, there was no noticeable alcohol, and the finish was short and non-descript."
"Had on tap at Rustico, in Alexandria, VA. Poured into a pint glass. Opaque and black, with an inch of creamy tan head. A fair bit of lacing remained through the course of the pint. Didn't get much in the way of aromas, but the taste was pleasant enough - dry and roasty. Reminiscent of Guinness, but a tad drier. I'd drink it again."
"This is a decent dry stout but it's nothing to write home about."
"Overall, a disappointing Dry Stout. Ready to move on to something else."
"Guiness is the first thing that comes to mind.. It may be a good representation of the style, but its a style that is a waste of time IMHO. I was dissapointed, and chugged this one down very quickly so I could move on to beers that have 3 times the flavor, and alcohol"
"Comes out of the tap a nearly opaque reddish sable with a thick, fairly persistent tan head. Aroma is richly of roast coffee and has just a hint of cinnamon. Flavor is surprisingly spicy and has a strong hoppy component, rather different from other stouts I have tasted. It has firm coffee and smoke components as well, plus a tiny metallic tinge - but the last may come from this particular batch. Texture is tingly and sharp, and just a teeny bit thin."
"Drinkability: The drinkability is fine from a low ABV, session-type standpoint, but being so devoid of flavor, I doubt it'd hold my interest beyond the one pint."
"Drinkability: With the low alcohol and the low bitterness, this could definitely be a session beer, especially on a rainy, blustery evening!"
"Overall this is a good Irish Stout. I'm still not 100% sure if it was a normal tap or if nitrogen was used, but judging from the carbonation it seemed like a normal tap. This is worth a shot if you see it around."
"I liked it."
"Keep the glass night at Flying Saucer, served a typical jet-black with the usual foamy nitro head. Because it was keep the glass night, mine and many others had been poured in advance, so I was not able to enjoy the waterfall effect. As the head slowly diminished, only spotty lacing was left on the glass. Aroma was the usual roasted malts, just not quite as abundant as I hoped for. Taste was pretty much textbook for the style, as was the mouthfeel; crisp carbonation and a smooth dryness. This is what it is, a good American made alternative to Guinness."
"Drinkability: Beats the pants off Guinness, low in abv%, and unusually flavorful for the style, a style I normally don't care too much for. This one's pretty dark sessionable though, mild and tasty. Not quite as ""dry"" as most IDSs, but that's alright with me - gives it character, I say."
"D: Very. A very sesisonal stout in a world of over-imperialization."
"Overall, this was a nice basic dry stout and hit the spot on a cold night. I would check this out again if for nothing else that the MF was superb on top of a pretty decent flavor."
"In the end, it was another nice light, dry, and roasted Irish Dry stout. It wasn't too dry or too roasted. It was just good. If I saw this again on nitro tap, I might order it again."
"""It smells like suede... tastes like if you licked my purse."""
"The beer pours a dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, earthy black malt aroma. It's light and creamy; a nice Irish Stout. The taste is great. It has a very smooth black malt flavor with a dry earthy finish that's a bit thin and creamy. It's very easy drinking. The mouthfeel is awesome. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good Irish stout. It's true to style and loaded with flavor; another winner from Victory."
"Creamy and easy to drink. Nice heavy full mouthfeel makes this brew incredibly satisfying. Very good."
"D: This lasted maybe 8 minutes in my glass"
"A stout I really enjoyed mainly due to the drinkability."
"I had this on nitro-tap at Deep Ellum back in early June. Nitro-taps are not usually my thing, but occasionally it will work really well with a stout. This stout is perfect for that treatment- light and very creamy, the nitro just accentuates what makes this beer so drinkable in the first place. Pours black with a creamy, thick head and great lacing. Smells creamy and a bit nutty. The taste is quite nutty with a rich creaminess and subdued cocoa notes. Delicious and so easy to drink you almost want to chug it- which I would never do, of course. One of the reasons I score this so high is that it is so sessionable. Such low alcohol beers are hard to find in the U.S. and this one sacrifices not a whit of flavor."
"The its overall character may not be hugely pronounced or anything I still find it very impressive that you get as much as you do for a sub 4% beer. I was also happy to find that the body packed a bit more beef than a lot of other crappy Irish Stouts on the market. And with that easygoing feel, I could session this all night. Definitely a great lower ABV alternative form Victory."
"A super easy drinker, and if the BA listing is true and it's less than 4%, a fine session drinker is what we've got here!"
"Pours a very dark brown that shows a touch of ruby when held to light. Head is creme. The nose is fairly roasted. It's one-dimensional, but still fairly firm. Flavor carries pretty much the same. Roasted and that's really about it. It isn't over-done at all, as I've had a lot of ridiculously roasted brews. It's smooth with a bit of a bite. The carbonation is biting as well and the liquid is good. Overall it's a nice fairly easy drinking brew. Between the bite of carbonation and the roasted aspects it might turn some beer wimps off, but I think it's nice."
"D_Easy drinking to say the least. A welcome chage of pace from the typical American stout. Probably the second best Dry Irish Stout I have had. A totally sessionable stout that does not overwhelm."
"Drinkability: as good as it gets for a sessionable beer. Not heavy, easy to quaff, and low alcohol make this a great beer to drink all day long."
"D: A good all around stout... i'd take it over a Guinness for a change in scenery..."
"Mostly black with lighter reddish edges and a thin light tan head. A lightly roasted malt nose with a small bit of coffee. Flavors of burnt malt, coffee notes with a little lactic tang similar to Guinness. The body was light to medium with a roasty/ grainy thin finish. I like the fact that they aimed for a low gravity stout in the classic fashion, but there needs to be some work on the body. Something a little more creamy. Or heck, put it through the nitro tap. I'm not the pro here."
"Overall I was very impressed and must give another hats off to victory for pushing the envelope (even if in the otehr direction...)"
"The beer poured a deep ruby-black with a thick, tan head (nitro-gas) into a pint glass. A nice chocolate/roasted malt aroma. A beautiful smooth, creamy mouthfeel, with a luscious chocoloate and roasted/toasted malt flavor and a slightly bitter finish - an excellent stout. A smoother version of Guinness, in my opinion. Great carbonation and lacing too."
"D- A low alcohol Irish stout that tastes better than the imports, a nice fresh stout, hard to beat."
"6 oz. taster glass at Rustico, Alexandria, VA"
"Great Job by Victory I would buy another barrell anytime."
"A very well done irish dry stout, almost like guinness done right."
"D: This is a great representation of the style with great flavor, an ease of drinkablity and a nice low ABV. Very well done."
"It began with about a half-a-finger of deep tan head with decent retention above an utterly black liquid. The nose had a mildly smoky quality. The mouthfeel had a very pleasant silky quality and a chocolaty/charcoal-y flavor on the tongue. The finish had the return of the dry, smoky bitterness that I had noted on the nose. Good lacing throughout."
"I found this on tap at a fairly new bar called Slainte in Philly across the street from 30th street station. It was delivered to me in an odd looking, kind of small ""Imperial"" pint glass that I'm guessing was actually more of an American pint at around 16 ounces. Despite the small glass, it had a beautiful appearance, very much like Guinness but with a just slightly darker head and a tiny bit less lacing (which could have been from the glass itself). Other than that it was almost exactly like Guinness, which it's obviously what it's trying to be. Or at least that's what the bar keep told me, that it was brewed specially for the Irish pub because they don't serve Guinness. Side by side with Guinness I could tell the difference, but I didn't really prefer one over the other. Nicely done!"
"One of Victory's very few low performers."
"Flavor of toasted malts, bitter chocolate, and some very faint coffee. Very smooth."
"D - A wonderful beer from Victory. Fantastic that it is only 3.7% ABV! This makes Donnybrook a wonderful session beer, the anti Storm King in ABV but not in flavor. Well done in making an Irish Dry Stout with flavor and not just another lame attempt at duplicating Guinness, which isnt that great to begin with!"
"After trying Uncle Teddy's Bitter for the first time at Fathead's we wandered up E. Carson a couple blocks where we found Donnybrook Stout flowing at Smokin' Joe's. Appears a deep dark roasted coffee hue with ruby highlights around the edges, light cream cascading tan head leaves behind even rings of lacing with each sip. Aromatics full dark roasted malts bring dark chocolate and coffee roast bitterness with herbal hop backings and some creamy milk chocolate after tones to balance out the dryness. Flavors are cohesive and resilient despite the fact that I usually find nitro tap offerings to be way to clean and airy tasting. Dark roasted malts give me chocolate, strong coffee, and creamy sensations like some Irish coffee in many aspects. Mild hop bitterness with herbal tea leaf hop sensations are really welcomed to give the dry bitterness a little snap. Mouthfeel is creamy like a milkshake, get ready to clear your beer mustache with this one, somewhat airy but the creaminess is there and there's enough body to not come off thin I would say medium bodied range. Like I said nitro taps usually kill the beer for me but that wasn't the case one of the best representations of the style I've come across in quite awhile. Drinkability, find this on St Paddy's or any other festive drinking day and this would be by the pint however that night at Smokin' Joe's there were just too many other interesting offerings to keep coming back to this one, but next time I see it I will drink up, hopefully in number."
"Interesting, it tastes like Storm King-light. It's very drinkable, but not your average Irish dry stout. The flavor is smooth and sweet chocolate liquor without any alcohol. It's just a little sweet and smooth, flavorful for the abv, but like a I said, but expect a normal dry stout."
"I had a pint on tap at d.b.a. in Manhattan. It was pitch black color with a thin beige head, and smelled surprisingly rich (to me) for the style. There was some chocolate and coffee (!) which I don't normally get out of dry stouts. The flavor was nice, roasted malts and coffee, not really any bitterness except maybe a hint in the after-taste. It went down easily, and at the low alcohol level you can drink it for a long time. Recommended."
"This brew came in a standard Nonic glass. Poured to a deep black color with a frothy Guinness like head that broke down slowly and did leave a nice sheen on lacing down the side of the glass, nice looking brew to say the least. The aromas seemed to be more on the burnt side than toasted, some coffee like scents and a slight hop. The taste seemed to resemble the aromas quite closely. The malt seemed to have a slight astringent flavoring but to me this brew tasted like it was missing something, not overly robust. Slight hop finish was good but just think that I have had better dry stouts. The feel was very creamy and again to its style had a dry finish. All in All, I was let down by this brew, but again I am viewing a single persons view. Let me just finish by saying that my expectations where high and was a little let down and this is probably why I have been as harsh, it is a fair brew."
"Overall a nice dry stout. Good drinkability."
"Dark brown color with a thick layer of creamy and rich darkish tan head on top. Smells strongly of roasted malts, with some subtler notes of sugars and dark fruitiness. Taste was a little paler and subdued than I expected given the appearance and smell. Had a slightly metallic and watery aftertaste that sort of ruined the initial taste which was a great mix of malts and sugars with some underlying bitter bite. Felt good in my mouth, round and filling but not too heavy; quite creamy. If the taste was vamped up a bit to maintain the initial level, I could easily have a couple of these, but as it was, I moved on to something else."
"D- Another great beer from Victory that you can only get at the brewery. The low ABV 3.7% makes it a great session beer and is a welcomed break from other places that are trying to recreate Guinness."
"Draught @ Victory: This one pours a very dark brown with a dense tan head. There was some cascading of the head: very Guinness-like. It leaves some lacing down the glass. The aroma was very mild. There were some roasted malts and a hint of chocolate. The taste is much better than the aroma and ABV would imply. Lighter body, but a good bit of chocolate and a hint of roasted malt. Very easy to drink."
"Extremely drinkable. If you want a session stout, this is it. With the low ABV it's a light, tasty stout that begs to be consumed in mass quantities."
"This is my favorite stout! Local Philly brewers are making stouts a standard and i couldnt be happier. I got this fresh pint from the blue dog cafe in lansdale. Great roasty flavor, not sour or acidic, full bodied and jet black. Similar to O'hara's (non-nitro stout favorite) but with more body and a fuller consistancy. Eastern PA residents... try this stout, i promise you will love it."
"Easy drinking as it's under 4% abv."
"D: Under 4%, are you kidding me. This is the kind of beer that you can belly up to all day long."
"Great beer to drink lots of.My girl thought I wouldnt like it because it was so light.I was in heaven,very creamy,seductive,light and down right tasty."
"Diatribe... In this day and age of big beers, it is refreshing, both literally and figuratively, to have such a wonderfully memorable brew like this..."
"Cheers!"
"Very drinkable. Was excellent to session on a long day of chili eating."
