"Nice stout. Wouldn't take it over a Guinness, if you're choosing popular stouts in Ireland, but it's good for a change. A nice burnt, bitter taste to it. The head on the beer is quite nice. Overall, would definitely drink again."

"Truely the best Irish stout. Upon the first sup one cannot help but fall in love with the spicy and cinnamon flavour that it has to offer beyond the white foamy head, which lasts way longer than the Guinness head. Best place to sample this delightful Irish stout is in its homeland of Cork."

"O: This beer is easy to drink, especially due to its light-bodied nature."

"Tough to find these days. Great, wonderful, spectacular Irish beer. I love it anyway I can get it. Nice change from Guinness and Murphy's just cause, why not? Was my first pint in Ireland at the Shannon airport directly off the red eye flight from Boston. Instant love with this beer. Not as available, really anyway compared to Guinness or Murphy's but that is what you beer snob dweebs are pretty much into, yeah? Go out getcha some Beamish!!! (If you can find it! And let me know where in the US it was found!)"

"Ireland's finest stout, much nicer than Guinness. I could drink a dozen of these and still want more. Personally I find it more refreshing and easier to drink than the world famous Guinness. If in Ireland, I would reccomend buying one of these before Guinness, they are just as widely availible as the other legendary stout. It is famous for being slightly cheaper too. I wouldn't buy this from a can or bottle though, completely different drink."

"Dark brown-black pour, nitro bubbles cascaded along the glass, settling as a firm, creamy, tan cap that retained well. Roasted malts in the nose, coffee notes, and not much else. Pretty standard stuff for the style. Taste was malty and dry, woody, coffee bitterness, and some unsweetened chocolate. Pretty smooth mouthfeel, medium body, a decent beer. The poor man's Guinness."

"O: Combination of ""cream"" and ""red"" ale qualities."

"Once you taste it, it clearly is not Guinness. Quite a bit more hop bitterness and a ton more strong porter like flavors. Lots of coffee and dryness. I enjoyed having something other than Guinness and I would drink it again. If we had the option in the states, I'd probably just drink Guinness."
""
""

"On tap. Roasted and heavy malt aromas. Pours black, with a nice tan head, long-lasting, creamy, some lacework. Medium body and low carbonation. Taste is malty, coffee, chocolate and some roasty. Nice dry finish. Looks like a stout should, with a fine off white thick head, which stays until the last drop of beer has gone. Quite a nice beer."

"Comments: If Guinness is the benchmark, this stout exceeds the mark on all accounts but one; the lactic acid sourness. I know my Irish cousins will scream heresy, but in all honesty, this beer is better than Guinness and makes Murphyâ€™s seem like a poor excuse for stout. The only thing I can think of that would make this beer better is a good soft lactobacillus culture."

"This was partly due to a succession of 'ok' pints of it's blander cousin Guinness, but next time in the 'old country' I will definetly seek Beamish out again!"

"Breakfast. The beautiful lass that poured this as my breakfast will, no doubt, skew my review. I wrote our initials in the thick head. As I quaffed this brew the initials survived to the bottom of the glass. I swear I could taste banana. Slightly sweet, heavenly aroma, the tantalizing flavors danced on all areas of my tongue with the exception of sour. Whoops! Time for brunch...I'll have another!"
"This beer poured out as a deep black color with a creamy surging head on top. These beers look beautiful every time. The lacing is just like a Guinness or Murphy's. The smell is a toasted and earthy. The flavor is roasted with a good amount of nut and earthy flavors. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Overall this beer is one I would love to have again. I had one can of this in 2008 and kind of miss it. One day it'll find it's way back to my fridge."
"Now this is beer, damn good stuff, I got to try this with a scoop of Ice Cream, probably end up being my favorite dessert."
"I lived in Cork Ireland for 6 months and had literally hundreds of these on tap. Absolutely love it. I've also had it from the can a few times, and while still good, it's not the same, of course. If you're ever in southern Ireland do yourself a favor and have the local brew."
"O: Pleasant, not something I want everyday but pleasant."
"Poured from a 440ml nitro-can into a pint glass. This stout poured a deep brown/black color with a thick, creamy, tan, nitro induced head that would not fade. Some light lacing was left around the glass. The aroma of this stout consisted of both sweet and roasted malt, mild coffee, and a few chocolate notes. The flavor was very creamy with notes of light milk chocolate and coffee. The roasted malt flavor was very mild when compared to other dry stouts. The mouthfeel was light-bodied with typical nitro creaminess and minimal carbonation. This was a decent, and very sessionable stout."
"Overall a great Irish Stout and a nice change from Guinness (and I think cheaper 3.50 euro vs. 4.50 euro for Guinness)"
"I could drink no more than a few in a sitting."
"The mouthfeel is fairly thin and creamy - that sounds like a contradiction but I am sticking to my statement. Overall easily drinkable and pleasant."
"D-A pretty nice Dry Stout that's light enough to have a couple of, but complex enough that it's not boring."
"Drinkability: Guinness draught has a definite leg up with its multiple notes and flavors, all of which are balanced better. If you're after an Irish stout, you're best off reaching for Guinness."
"Overall, a great beer and highly recommended to any stout lover."
"Dark brown to black in color with a thick, foamy, light beige nitro-head. Sweet, smokey, roasted malt, and toffee aromas. Light bodied, very low carbonation, a bit of a creamy buttery feel. Roasted malt and caramel flavors with a lightly bitter and dry finish. Not bad. Seems to be true to the style. I'm not a big fan of the low carbonation ales. Aside from the beautiful pour and impressive head retention, the nitro beers just don't do it for me."
"Taste, amazingly thin, and keeps getting thinner. Very creamy for the lack of thickness, a smooth, smoky, thin stout without any degree of bitterness of hops. But throughout, its just tough to get over the thin body for this beer. Makes it more drinkable, but the difficulty in finding this stuff, as well as the price, makes it a little cost prohibitive for something this thin."
"Thanks #1 for the sample."
"A quote from Lewis Carroll : ""And, has thou slain the Jabberwock? Come to my arms, my BEAMISH boy! O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"" he chortled in his joy."
"D - This is not as good as Guinness, but fairly close; it is equal to Murphy's and better than Young's, in the battle of the nitro-can Stout."
"A close 2nd in this shootout. Similar but superior to Murphy's. Subtle differences between this and Guinness and they are both quite good. Guinness gets a SLIGHT nod due to better appearance and aroma, availability and price also help the classic from St. James Gate take the victory in the shootout. Still, very glad to FINALLY be able to try Beamish after years of hunting, a solid silver medal winner in my book!"
"D - Really not bad for what it is. Some hop character shows through in the finish, which is a bit unusual for the style but adds depth. A bit lacking in malt character but with a rich coffee roast. Preferable to Guinness but unfortunately much harder to find."
"This would easily be my go to stout if it were still widely available, but right now it's a little tough to find. Much better than Guinness."
"after cracking the widget and pouring into a Guinness imperial pint glass, you get that perfect irish stout look: clear delineation between jet black beer and light tan head, about a 1/2 inch thick. there isn't much to the aroma, just some roasted malt, a little soapy. there is a little coffee taste and a little chocolate taste but neither is significant. taste is smooth and creamy with a clean finish. dry irish stouts are one of the more perfect beers when you plan to drink about ten of them. goes down light and easy."
"On tap at the Cambridge brew pub. Nice creamy Guiness looking head. Dark body. A little bigger body than a Guiness but not much. Not much aroma. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth and cream and the drinkability at 4.1 percent ABV is huge. When trying to keep up with Soupedupdiesel and Larsonstyle at the bar... this one really came in handy. I'm still disappointed the Moonbeam stout was kicked and I didn't have the opportunity to get a second shot at it."
"Very good drinkability. Nothing too exciting, but a great ""session"" beer!"
"D- A wonderful session beer. Could drink this all day."
"Pours pretty much opaque jet black with a super creamy tan head from its nitro can. Aroma is muted, but I clearly detect chalky bittersweet chocolate and a bit of roasted malt character. Taste is also quite mild with some acrid bitterness. Roasted coffee and a tad of biscuity malt can be identified. Chalky with only the rumor of hops, I find it (much like many other dry Irish stouts) to be quite thirst quenching. Mouthfeel is medium and super creamy thanks the widget. Slightly chewy, but finishes with just a tinge of sour, not sticky at all. Like others of this style, I could down these one after another. All in all I enjoy this more than Guinness, but it does not stand up to well made, fresh American craft examples."
"The drinkability is almost a foregone conclusion. Irish Drys may be the best session ales in the world and this is certainly one of the prominent renditions."
"Picked up a 4 pack of cans for St. Patty's Day. Served in Guinness glasses. Dark brown color with ruby highlights. Thick creamy white heady. Tiny carbonation bubbles right where the liquid meets the head. Classic looking stout. Decent roasted malt smell. Great flavor, more toasted malt and slight coffee aftertaste. The mouthfeel from the nitro is pretty satisfying. Has to be one of the creamiest beers from a can. At the end, the foam left in the glass slid down the side at a glacial pace, it was thick. Smooth, easy to drink, and low abv made me wish this was a 6 pack."
"D-a delicious beer with a great taste that can easily be enjoyed all night"
" This is an Irish favorite of mine. Nothing flashy here but an all around easy drinker. The taste is a tad dryer that Guinness in the nitro and i find more enjoyable that Murphy's. She comes out the can black as night, creamy off white head with some of the tiniest bubbles seen. I have never had the pleasure of having this one on draft but given the opportunity i would be all over it. Light aromas of coffee and chocolate come though the glass and beg to be taken in with large gulps. Beamish is one of those stouts I can drink all night, goes great in half and halfs, and never do I feel bloated. The taste is sweet but not too sweet the dark roasted characters meld the ale into coffee like candy treat. Raise this one on St. Patty's and leave the rest of the green Macro in the dust."
"More hops than expected on the palate with toasty malt. Roast makes an appearance throughout the drink, finishes dry, as expected. Unique brew."
"Absurdly easy to drink. Could quaff this even on the hotest of days."
"D - This beer drinks well, but is a little heavy for a stout. Not something to be chugged, or thrown into a Carbomb, for sure. Enjoy this beer and sip it smooth."
"This really is a mild, easy drinking stout and was my go to draft while vacationing in Ireland years ago. Love it."
"From the can to a pint glass. Pours black with a very light tan head. Kind of has that picture perfect Irish pint look you see for the advertisements for Irish stouts. The head leaves a lacing on the glass and stays till the last drop, great retention. The smell is pretty typical and what I would expect for the style. A nice roasted smell and this one smells great. There is also some chocolate in there as well, nothing strong but it's there. The taste, like the smell, was pretty predictable. A nice light roasted flavor, that small hint of chocolate, and unlike the smell I got just a dab of coffee as well. Nice refreshing taste. The mouthfeel is really creamy. I wouldn't say it's thick but it's definitely not thin, kind of almost chewy but more creamier than anything. Drinkability is high for this one. With a ABV lower than Bud Light kicking back a few of these wouldn't be a problem. This one definitely contends with Guinness and Murphys, not sure which of the three I like best but all are great. Overall this one is great, will pick up some more whenever I get the chance."
"Value: B"
"Pretty drinkable; a nice low ABV beer but nothing special."
"Smooth creamy mouthfeel. Wonderful water chemistry, with a bit of chalky bicarbonate and dry calcium, which you can really notice in the mouthfeel. Really enjoyable, worthy of a bit session. It's almost a perfect stout...not the most exciting beer but one you can enjoy the crap out of. Definitely my favorite stout of the big Irish 3."
"Not a bad stout but you could find a little better."
"Drinkability: This is definitely worth a try, and it's certainly something I could get again. I was quite satisfied."
"Overall this style traditionally leans towards non offensive and easy drinking. This beer follows suit to the letter."
"Pours a muddy brown, followed by an always nice to watch cascading, leaving black liquid with a white head that has the look and consistancy of heavy cream. The creamy head sticks it out to the finish and coats the pint all the way down. Theres next to nothing in the nose. Taste was typical Irish Stout I suppose, very bland, almost tinny. Theres a hint of maltiness and maybe some mild sweetness, but the bitter, dry finish somewhat mutes that point. The feel is thin and watery in a way. It is rather smooth, however. Though it would be easy to pound these back, you would likely be left unsatisified by the lack of flavour and the odd viscosity. I'm fairly convinced that I will never realize the true beauty of an Irish Stout until I cross the pond and partake of them in their native splender."
"Notes: Not sure if the recipe has changed since the Murphy's takeover or if my palate has evolved since I last had one of these. I remember liking it more than Guinness back in the day (and enjoyed it on-tap when I was in Ireland about 9 years ago), but now I don't really have a lot that's positive to say about this. At least the can was free."
"I knew this wouldn't be a shining example of the style, but it more than met my expectations. If it were more widely available and less expensive, I could see it staying in my refrigerator."
"*Goes great with Lord of the Rings marathons!!"
"D. well balanced and a perfect session stout"
"This one is very drinkable, and probably my favorite Irish Dry Stout. Were it more available, I'd probably be drinking Beamish much more often."
"Pours out a very deep black, with only minor hints of ruby-red at the edges of my pint glass. Nitro bubblies take a while to settle, and are bigger and whiter than is typical for the nitro-draft poured stout. Eventually settles into a tight and thick head which lasts the entire pint and leaves rings of lace the whole way down. Smell is typically underwhelming, roasted malt and light chocolate, and the flavour profile follows. Slightly bitter, with a dry bite in the background, but not quite so bitter as the other big Irish stouts. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and just a little too thin, and drinkability is fantastic. My personal favourite of the three popular Irish Dry Stouts, but it's nothing to write home about."
"D: Very drinkable brew that you can put back repeatedly. Almost too much like water not complex at all but good while it lasts."
"Had to try this one out because I had never had it before. Found it at an Old Chicago out of town on a beerventure. Very similar to Guinness except I don't know if I had just killed my palate with stronger beers by the time I drank this one but it seemed to me almost flat. Black as can be with a thick creamy off white foam forming at the top this is just what a nitro irish stout was meant to be. While I didn't enjoy it at the time I would say that this beer falls in the average range of the style and type that it's supposed to be. Very smooth, almost creamy and not too strong. If you like this kind of beer I don't see why you couldn't drink something like this all night. I'm more for the stronger stouts. So there it is, average but drinkable."
"Taste: Very much a roasted taste but it has a little bit of a watered down feel to it. The carbonation is very low and the body is very light."
"The corbonation is perfect in this brew. All the elements work well and complement each other. Likewise, this beer has great drinkability. You could easily drink this beer all night"
"D: I could certainly session this guy."
"D: The quote of the night sums it all up: ""It's like roasted water..."" It's just lacking in the taste and mouthfeel categories. I'm always going to be blown away by the appearance the nitro widget gives, and the aromas are wonderful...but the taste? It is just not quite there."
"Poured from a nitro-can into a pint glass at Paddy's Pub in Milwaukee, WI. The body was black with a thick off-white head. The aroma was faint, but smelled of sweet chocolate and cream. Light bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. Flavors of sweet malt, but also a roasted malt finish. Very good drinkability."
"MF/D: Very very drinkable. Light enough for a session beer and the ABV is low enough to drink a few of. Definitely will be picking up a couple of these next chance I get"
"Drinkability: Not bad! A smooth, mild, lightly flavored Irish Stout with a sensible amount of alcohol."
"From a 14.9 oz. nitro can. Pours a black color with a creamy 1/2 inch head. Light, malty aroma. Taste of malts with some hints of coffee. Feels creamy in the mouth. nThis is not a beer I could spend the night drinking. Overall a fairly mediocre brew."
"This is an easily quaffable beer and a fine companion for long sessions or billiards."
"Drinkability: the relatively light body and subtle flavors make this quite drinkable, but I would think it would be easily overpowered by most pub foods if consumed in such a setting."
"D: A good mouthfeel and taste combo, especially for the style. Despite the thickness, I found myself drinking this beer quite voraciously and could not wait of have another! A great tasting beer that goes down quite easily."
"A decent dry Irish Nitro Stout."
"Notes: Of the big three nitro stouts (Guinness, Murphy's and Beamish) Beamish is my favorite."
"D- A long time favorite of mine, and probably the easiest stout to session."
"D) Delicious. Straight from Ireland - the real deal!"
"D: Goes down so damn smooth. I found myself wanting to drink more just so that I could maintain the slick feel in my mouth."
"4.5 easier to drink than water."
"This one is harder for me to find than the other well known draught stouts (Guinness and Murphy's) but I think it has quickly become my favorite. The smell is fruity esters and roasted barley, very pleasant. All of the big three draught stouts tend to have a watery mouthfeel but this one seems just a bit fuller and creamier than the other two. Roasted barley bitterness is there, but not as overt as Guinness and Murphy's and there is a touch of sweetness more prevalent in Beamish. I declare this the most drinkable draught stout yet!! Bravo!"
"Better than the other dry Irish born Stouts IMO ..."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- A very thin beer in general, the carbonation breaks early in the mouth, then goes quickly and smoothly down the throat. An easy session beer for the enthusiast looking for more bittering and a roastier finish."
"Great stuff. I can only find it at a famous West Michigan Irish pub on tap. I've never seen it anywhere else in the US. Way better than Guiness in my opinion. More everything. I still prefer Sierra Nevada and Murphys Stout in my opinion, but this is well worth a try if you can find it."
"Once I finish staring at it and actually drink the thing, Beamish has a smooth creaminess that I have not seen replicated anywhere. Heavily roasted barley gives it at rich, complex, almost meaty flavor. I hesitate to call a beer ""meaty", but somehow it seems like the word that best fits. It doesn't reach the level of complexity of some of the best dark Belgian beers, but I don't think it's supposed to. It's mild enough that it won't conflict with any food pairing, and simultaneously robust enough to stand up to anything. One of my all-time favorites. I can't give it above average for smell because it doesn't really have one, but that hardly detracts from the overall experience."
"D: It's an easy drinker, but I get bored with drinking it. Just not much depth to the beer"
"M/D: The beer was thick, yet smooth, rich, creamy and very easy to drink. It had a very well balanced aftertaste, not too bitter, not too sweet. Honestly, I will rank this above both Guinness and Murphy's. An excellent beer and one that I will be enjoying again."
"Drinkability: This goes down very easily and the mild dry bitterness is very easy to take. I'll certainly return to the beer and I could easily make a night of it with this beer.."
"The body is light but good for style. Very easy drinking and smooth. Overall I would have liked to try this minus the nitro. But as is there is limited aroma and flavor leaves this a bit lacking."
"Overall I was impressed, this is a well balanced stout with complex flavors and textures. I would definately recommend this beer."
"Spotted a can in the trusty take out bin of my local go-to. Bird heard a rumor that imports of this were shut down. Either its false or this can is old. Opens with a nice pssst sound. Pours dark brown and opaque, with the liquid cascade of course. This can is fine. Smell is light, like oatmeal and coffee in the room adjacent. Taste is balanced sweet vs bitter. Light roasted malt character and bitterness, chocolate and coffee notes as well. Mouthfeel is creamy yet watery, artificial feeling but worth the effort. Drink quickly ladies and gentlemen. Duh."
"Overall, this is a good Irish stout that compares favorably to Murphy's, although I prefer Guiness as it has always been a good standby. Definitely worth a try for anyone who enjoys Irish stouts and the sweet flavor makes it enjoyable and easy to drink."
"Appearance is dark dark brown with a healthy creamy head. Smell of light roast and chocolate cake. Taste has coffee, light chocolate along with some earthiness to it. Mouthfeel is a little light in creaminess and body for the style, but still a very drinkable easy going stout."
"Pours dark opaque black with a dense, creamy head into a pint glass -- though surprised the widget did not make the head taller. Red cherry peeks through when you hold it up to the light. Very faint smell with only notes of malt -- biscuit and caramel. Nice thick, creamy mouthfeel. Taste is malty up front with a bit of sweetness, matching the smell, and finishes with roasted, smoky flavor. Not too much bitterness until you are done swallowing, at which point it's the only taste left in your mouth. No taste of alcohol. Very similar to a Guinness but with more smokiness. For me this is an OK example of the style, but not something I would drink a six pack of, and without the complexity I would normally go for."
"this brew pours up a jet black color with a super creamy tan head. definitely great lacing. there is just barely any aroma here! just a tiny tiny amount of malts. blah. the taste is very creamy, thin malts, bitter metallic finish, light bodied, smooth carbo. Blah. Exactly like Guinness Draught but not nearly as good. Blah..."
"The color is a very dark brown with deep red highlights. The head is very thick foam and leaves some sticky tan lacing on the glass. The smell is toasty grains (barley) with a little more sweetness and some yeast tones followed by hops. The taste is dry toasted grains with a hops backbone and a light sweetness. Mouthfeel is creamy and does tend to thin as you go, though it doesn't get watery. It is quite dry and leaves a bitterness in the finish. All in all this is very drinkable and I would prefer this to a Guinness as the best example I've had to date for the style."
"Call me crazy but I think this is the best Irish stout out there. For some reason getting harder and harder to find, at least by me. Everything is the same as a guinness except I think it has a smoother, creamier taste. If you haven't tried it buy a four pack and give it a shot. Makes nice for car bombs."
"Finally reviewing a nitro-can! Pours dark as can be but is a deep, deep mahoganey when held to the light. It has that beautiful cascading bubbles effect with the thick, creamy, mocha head. Smell is basically a watered down chocolate syrup. A bit of roasted grain. Taste is about the same. Sweet chocolate syrup thats been watered down with some burnt grain. A slight coffee finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and light with a somewhat chewy feel. Overall not bad. There is just something about this style that I have a hard time getting into, but I can still appreciate a good beer."
"D - Good drinkability. Slight bitter and dry flavors bump it out of what I would consider a session beer."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Light but very tasty. I'm not a stout drinker, but really like this one!"
"Drinkability- Can't go wrong with these light-bodied, irish stouts. Could probably drink a lot of these, if I wanted to down some stout for the hell of it. Personally, I like a little bit more richness and flavor in my stouts."
"Drinkability: Just as watery as Guinness and Murphy's, and just as drinkable on a week made to sell Irish stout."
"Beamish and Guinness just don't do it for me anymore. I will still seek them out around St Pats, though."
"Pours out a chocolaty brown with a very fine-bubbled head and lots of fine, descending bubbles like Guinness - clearly the result of nitrogen tapping. An extra half point for that. Smoky, chocolaty aroma has nutty and molasses hints. Flavor is mainly of unsweet chocolate with a molasses undertone and hints of smoke and nuts. Velvety smooth texture has a good tingle to it."
"Not as much head as a Guinness, though appearance was very similar, almost black, though not as red as Guinness when held to light. Smelled light but roasty, taste was similar with some sweet notes, chocolaty as well. Very smooth, easy to drink but fails to meet Guinness in every respect."
"Given the reviews that I have read of it, and the comments by Beamish fans, I was expecting a much better brew. Maybe this is a case of too-high expectations, but that would be giving the beer the benefit of the doubt."
"MF&D - the feel is thinner than what I enjoy. This is not a beer that I enjoyed in taste or many other aspects."
"Well, I'm impressed. I love me a good stout, but this one is quite remarkable. Very well-balanced flavor-wise and aroma-wise. I'm looking forward to enjoying the other 3 of my 4-pack!"
"Brew pours to a deep brown color with the base being more of a black color. Nice sized creamy tan head that has good retention. The aroma is very inviting,roasted malts, chocolate with a slight lactic like scent. The flavor has a nice roasted character to it, slightly bitter and finishes dry. Out of what I call the big three Irish Stout producers I feel that Beamish is the best and probably by a pretty good margin, but that is just one persons opinion, Has a slightly watery feel, meaning I think it could have a thicker feel to it. Though what is there is quite velvety and creamy."
"overall a great irish stout and WAAAYYY better than Guinness. I could easily put this entire 4 pack down in one sitting."
"The mouth feel was amazing also just smooth and not bitter with just a touch of carbonation makes for an easy beer to just hold and enjoy."
"mouth is silky, smooth and is a bit more viscous than Guiness. I like this better than guinnes but it's damn close to really be much different."
"Frothy, aggravated liquid. Forms a good-sized head after a while, creamy yellow, very lasting. Very dark brown blackish body, impossible to see through. Malty creamy aroma, earthy, dark coffee grounds. But not very strong aroma, even after warming up for a little bit. Watery taste, some coffee, chocolate. A little bitter."
"Similar to Guinness but with a few differences. It's opaque dark brown with an off-white creamy head. Less head retention than Guinness, but there's nice lacing. Can smell some chocolate, some roasted coffee and grain aromas and definite malts, typical of an Irish stout. Tastes creamy. Roasted grain character especially noticeable on finish. Kind of sweet, followed by bitter finish. A bit lighter than expected. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, very little carbonation and medium-bodied. Overall it's smooth and easy to drink."
"The drinkability is quite good. I appreciated its full flavor and smell much more than the 'other' stout found in every Irish bar."
"Drinkability - Because nothing is all that strong in this one, its readily drinkable. However, nothing leaves me wanting to revisit it very often. If I'm looking for an Irish stout, this would probably be the choice though - toss up between this and Murphy's."
"Beamish might have the best taste of the 3 big nitro-can Irish Stouts. But the mouthfeel falls a bit short. And this really effects the overall enjoyability. I would be very excited to try this on draught. Seems like it would really top the other two."
"D - I could have sat in this British pub for hours drinking it. That is if I didn't sit at a brewery and had a few just prior to visiting there. Very pleasant mouthfeel and taste in my opinion."
"This beer poured a cloudy opaque brown with a thick tan two-finger head. The smell is mostly sweet slightly roasted malt. The taste starts off with some bittersweet slightly chocolately malt that gives way to a little bit of coffee taste and a fairly clean finish. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with very little carbonation. This beer is very reminiscent of Guinness, and I'm not positive I could tell them apart if I had to."
"Taste: Sweet and roasty. More bitter than I thought it would be."
"Amazing, it confirmed just again that Beamish is my favourite stout. It gets much better grades if served on nitro-tap."
" I would recommend this beer to anyone who likes Guinness, Murphy's or any other creamy styled Stout."
"D- A nice Irish stout. I like the lower carbonation this beer has as well. It makes for repeat consumption easier. I purchased a 4 pack and drank them all in a session."
"D - Really a treat. Creamy and tasty with more flavor than guiness."
"Beamish beats Guinness Draught (but not Guinness Extra Stout) in my book. Looks identical to Guinness Draught when poured in a glass but Beamish has more character by all other measures. Roasty, cocoish aromas on the nose are exactly what you taste on the palate. Super creamy, easy to drink. I wish it was more widely available."
"Final Thought: Another staple in the fridge as is Murphy's; both are > Guinness! Yummy!"
"D- Can't stop drinkin' 'em. Low abv, great, unobtrusive taste, and great texture make this beer a great session beer."
"D - Very drinkable. Smooth and balanced enough to have more than one."
"Pours a dark black color. Good thick, 1/2 inch head with great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt mostly and some hop aroma as well. Fits the style exquisitely. Crisp mouth feel with low carbonation. The smoothest beer I've ever had - it was amazing. Tastes of sweet malt and some roasted malt flavors come out in the aftertaste. There is a hop bitterness present, but not in too strong an amount to detract from the malt. Overall, one of the best beers I've ever had."
"At only 4,1% abv, this is just too bland of a beer to look this good off the pour. What a shame."
"I liked all three, but Beamish really stood out to me. So creamy and smooth, to go along with a great taste really put it over the top for me. I would take a Beamish over a Guinness any day, and my friend agreed. However, he claims that Guinness is better on tap in Ireland. That I'll have to decide for myself if I ever get over there."
"Had this one ontap at an Irish bar. The apperance was a nice brown color with hints of maroon at certain parts of glass. The smell was fairly dissapointing for a stout. It smelled of roasted malts and hints of coffee. The taste was dominated with a toasty warm malts with hints of coffee and chocolate. I enjoyed the mouthfeel as it was nice and creamy with okay carbonation. I couldnt see me knocking down these but rather enjoying one every once in a while."
"D: Maybe I need to give this one another shot. It seemed pretty flavorless to me, but perhaps the stuff I got had gone bad, as the place I went--the Napa Valley Grille--didn't specialize in beer. They advertised it as ""Beamish Dark", which I assume is this beer."
"Poured an opaque color with a firm creamy head. Nose is like a coalmine Taste is dominated by licorice, spearmint and espresso. This beer still has a dryness to it but npt as bad as a Guinness or Murphys. Mouthfeel is creamy, dry and finishes off with a small bite. Pretty good brew overall. Worth a try."
"Of the big three, this is probably my favorite - it has a more roasted taste than the other two. I really wish I could try this without the nitro. Probably my favorite nitro-stout, I highly recommend it."
"D: Robust flavor, yet a light drinking brew. Really easy to drink. Enjoyable quaff."
"I could drink this all night. Very plain (but not in a bad way), session stout."
"Definitely a highly drinkable alternative to Guinness...."
"D- This is one hell of a good Irish Dry Stout. The 4.1% doesn't hurt either. Definitely a hell of an afternoon beer. I'm not usually a big fan of nitro-style beer as it typically kills off a lot of flavor but the beamish really holds up well to the creamy nitro."
"Drinkability is fairly high. A simple stout, pleasing flavors, enjoyable, and easily sessionable. No major complaints."
"D. This is one you can pound. A nice solid session stout, and on par with the Murpheys and Guinnesses of the world."
"As a note..the head on this beer held until the last drink from the glass..now that's impressive."
"Good Irish (Dry?) stout. Have to say it looks better than Guinness out of the tap, at least here in the States. Dark with slight head. Bitter like dark chocolate, but not heavy or thick. Bubbly, light but substantial mouthfeel. Like the bitterness and the chocolate more than Guinness."
"D - Easy drinking, tasty, and low ABV. Makes a great session beer. Beamish is far and away my favorite of the 'Big 3' Irish Stouts. I prefer the sweetness and clean finish to Guinness and Murphy's, though they are all quite similar."
"Bought a nitro-can Guinness and a nitro-can Beamish and did a taste test. Both poured from the cans with the usual ""hiss"" of the nitro pellet in a nice foamy stream. Both looked about the same in the glass (once settled) with a massive rich foamy head on top (the Beamish a bit more tan and the Guinness more gray) and a deep brown to black (with ruby highlights) below. Little carbonation visible. Smell was similar, just a touch of smoky malts. Initial tastes were quite different. Beamish was smooth in the mouth, with a well balanced, drinkable mix of malt flavors and a hint of sweetness that made it very easy to drink--top to bottom. The Guinness was similar, but with a bit more hops bitterness that soon turned to a metallic hint of alcohol as it warmed. Definitely enjoyed both of them (who wouldn't) but the Beamish was a tad bit better, IMHO."
"Matched nicely with a ""Beamish Burger"" at Delaney's, served in a Beamish pint glass. Nice pour, jet black with a creamy ivory head. Mild malty aroma. Taste is nicely balanced; sweet, malty, a little bit of coffee. Very easy drinking; the perfect choice for lunch on a cold day."
"D - This is a good irish stout. Very sessionable and tasty."
"Comment I did a taste test between this and murphy's. A hard choice to pick one both are great beers. Beamish is a little sweeter with less carbonation than Murphy's. I recommend both highly."
"D: This is another uneven beer in my eyes. The taste was simply too uninteresting and thin to be likable."
"This is such a yummy beer. The taste reminds me of carob. The head is very creamy, and lasts the entire time, much like a Guinness Draught. Very easy to drink. The flavor lends itself to being served cold (as opposed to some lesser beers that need to be served cold simply to mask their weakness). I definitely recommend this."
"D - The somewhat low(4.4%)ABV and the smoothness make this VERY drinkable. This is what I would probably give someone interested in trying a true irish stout."
"This is a pretty good stout, it's very easy to drink and goes down smoothly. It wouldn't be my first choice of stouts, but I definitely wouldn't pass one up. I could also see myself picking up a four pack when I was in the mood. It's pretty good."
"D - I could drink a few of these in one sitting. Great beer"
"GC"
"Pouring the beer produces a sudsy brown concoction that kind of looks like sludge at first but ends in a cola black colored beer with a lite tan head that maintains a 1 centimeter head. Smells chocolatey with maybe a hint of birch. Taste is slightly sweet but a little bland compared to the smell. The mouthfeel is quite thick almost like sherbert. Overall nothing offensive, to hurt drinkability, but nothing to make me want to race out and buy more either. Overall its a pretty good stout."
"Black colored stout with a foamy thick creamy head.Aroma is mainly coffee.Taste is chocolate,coffe and cream.This is just damn good!!Creamy smooth and tasty.Highly recommended.I personally don't think beer can get much better than this!!Good job by Beamish and Crawford."
"My favorite nitro-can irish stout, this has a bit more dry cocoa flavor and cool bitterness than the usual suspect. Dry and quenching with plenty of chocolate and coffee notes to keep it interesting. Milky smooth, mildly bitter and squeeky clean without being astringent. It lacks Guinness' sour note, but makes up for it in roasted flavors. Perfect for slugging down during activities such as darts or pool."
"Drinkability - Smooth and sessionable."
"Decent Irish Dry, though the flavor is sometimes hard to pick up behind the dense nitrogen infused head. Drinkable, and about along the lines of the sytle. Recommended."
"Aftertaste is creamy and the smells stay with you in your mouth. Very easy to drink and have another."
"The drink is light in body and an easy drinker with creamy feel."
"1/24/2005. Sampled from the draught nitro can. Pretty good, I liked it. Black color, nice thick head. Coffee and roasted malt flavor, with some chocolate. Nice. Creamy and smooth. Had a little bit of a thin mouthfeel but nothing major and this is all around a good Irish Stout."
"Well done."
"Enjoyed off a nitro-tap at The Scuffer, thanks John! Poured like a true Irish Stout should, thick and as black as midnight. Outstanding retention, displays a mocha brown head and a beautiful cap. Heavy body and light carbonation without being heavy. Exceptionally smooth as a result of light carbonation. Chocolate and coffee flavors; just a touch bitter and a dry finish. Solid yet slightly lacking in gumption. Very Guinness like, though not as heavy and Guinness still trumps it barely."
"For all those Guiness Draught drinkers out there, give the less known Irish Stouts a try, you won't be disappointed. While you are near the Guiness take a look down in the area, you may see one of these Beamish cans. While you are at it, also grab a Guiness and Murphy's, then go home and taste the difference."
"Ireland has about a 21percent tax on almost everything, but definetly worth it."
"Edit: Well after half a year and over 300 deep into my beer quest I've realized that Irish stouts aren't the greatest anymore. This one is still my favorite, but the taste is thin and lacking as is the mouthfeel. Certainly a sessionable beer but no longer one of my favorites."
"Hard pour out of a nitro can leaves a thick 1-1.5 inch light caramel head with prodigious lacing. Color is very dark brown; shines red when held to the light. Aroma is sweet smell of malt, oak and a hint of coffee. Mouthfeel is creamy yet loose, with a little fuller body than the Guinness to which it is so oft compared. Taste is burnt toast, caramel, coffee and a hint of chocolate, a little bitter at the finish. Overall this beer was pretty good. This is a good alternative to my go-to Guinness despite some very distinct differences the two brews have."
"This beer looks great, but the taste isn't exceptional. A good change of pace in Irish Stout, but nothing extraordinary."
"Grabbed a 4 pack the other day in anticipation of enjoying them tonight during the NCAA Tournament, which happens to coincide with St. Patty's day so win/win. The best pour of any Irish Stout I have ever had, comes out of the draught can creamy and immediately begins to cascade down in my pub glass. A thick creamy head blankets the top of my glass and stays throughout the entire beer, even after the beer is gone the head remains in the bottom of the glass. Intense lacing sticks to the glass. The color is a rich dark mahogony. Strong aroma is present making me aware of the roasted malts that dominate this beer. All of the other Irish Stouts I have sampled had a faint aroma that was hard to detect, Beamish lets you know right away that you are going to enjoy their brew. The mouthfeel is smooth and velvety, this stout is beyond creamy with an exceptional finish. The flavor is bursting with rich roasted malts. Undertones of coffee are present. It is now known that Beamish is on the outs and this is unfortunate because in my opinion Guinness is very good, Murphy's is better, but Beamish is the cream of the crop. My only regret is that I was not able to discover this beer sooner. Fantastic Dry Stout, I'm going back to the store to stock up."
"Easy to drink, nothing offensive, a good intro to the style. Not my favorite, maybe I'll have to try a bottle or tap as the nitro can character really overtakes everything: look, nose and flavor, feel, and sessionability."
"Very drinkable. Overall I give it a slight edge over the other popular dry stouts."
"Overall, a delicious stout. Good balance of malt, hops, and roasted grains; not too overpowering from any angle. All elements meld together great to give you a great tasting, easy drinking stout."
"D: Very drinkable because of the smooth flavor and lighter body."
"The beer pours from the widget can with waves and waves of tiny bubbles floating up to form the beautiful cap of creamy foam. After things settle down the color of the beer is a very dark chestnut brown with some ruby highlights. Earthy hops and coffee notes round out the light aroma. Light and almost silky on the palate. Cocoa powder is the main flavor on the palate followed by a bitterness that leaves the palate dry. Good and drinkable. I think I will have another."
"A good bit more flavor than Guiness Nitro, but that isn't saying much. Go for this if you find it."
"*Holds cardboard sign says: Needs change for Beamish. -God bless you*"
"D: I could drink so many of these. Much better than Guinness in my opinion (dodges bullets)."
"overall this is a very nice beer i enjoyedit very sessionable"
"On the palate the roasty flavors come through nicely with a modest amount of hops for balance. Medium to light bodied. Very, very drinkable for a dry irish stout."
"Nitro can, pours black with brown edges and eggnog colored head. Smell: sweet, grain, little bit of chocolate and coffee, smoky burnt character, yeast. Taste: roasty bitterness, coffee and cream. Mouthfeel: smooth would be the operative word. Nice dry stout, slightly better than the other big name nitro stouts."
"D: Compares very well to Guinness and the other Irish stouts of its kind. So in other words it's good. Nothing blows me away with it though. Very drinkable."
"D: Very drinkable...Should have invested in the 4 pack instead of the single."
"Pours beautifully. Reminds me of being in Ireland. Black on the bottom and beautifully tan and creamy looking on the top. Nice minor roasted thing going on with a nice malty body. It's smooth with just a touch of a bitter edge to it. It's nice. Smooth feel on all levels and it's extremely drinkable. Pretty tasty Irish Dry Stout that definitely should be tried if you have the chance."
"We totally received a case of this by mistake at the ABC where I work so I took it as a sign from the beer gods to go ahead and give this one a try. Served it slighty chilled in my Samuel Smith pub glass. Poured a powerful midnight black color with a rapid expanding cocoa brown head. Smell was of roasted malts with some cocoa powder and brewed coffee. Taste was smooth as silk (thank you nitrogen bubbles) with heavy baker's chocolate in the front and light, sweet, roasted malts on the dry finish. I could see knocking back a few of these on St. Pat's day."
"Pours a near black with some ruby highlights, 1/2 inch creamy off white head sticks around forever and leaves mad lacing. Aroma is of coffee, some cocoa, some chocolate milk. Taste hits first with the roast bitterness, then some dried fruit and some cocoa. Body is medium to thin. Crisp carbonation. Great irish stout, very sessionable."
"Light to medium body, exceedingly smooth, fairly well-balanced palate, overall a very simple and modest stout that's easy to drink and quite pleasing. Very similar to Guiness, etc, but I think it has a nicer body and slightly deeper flavor."
"A good beer alternative. I keep comparing to Guinness and although not as good it is a very nice beer. Kinda like a Guinness light or something, recommend at least trying."
"Beamish is a good Irish stout, and it gets a slight nod over Murphy's just because it's a bit more rare, I've found. It runs about neck and neck with Guinness for the style, so it's a good bet and probably a better value."
"Pours a dark brown almost black, but with some ruby edges in the light. A lovely 1 inch of creamy tan head forms after a nice fall, great retention and nice lacing. Smells of roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee, but some dark fruit notes come out as it warms. Tastes of roasted malt, caramel, chocolate, and coffee with a dry hop finish. Smooth and creamy, low in carbonation, semi thick with a good roasted sweetness and a nice dry finish. Lots of flavor and low in alcohol, great Irish Dry Stout from a can."
"Much easier to drink than nitro versions of Guiness or Murphy's, but there is still an overall lack of flavor. Maybe an intro beer for someone new to the style, otherwise it's just for those with love of the nitro-can. Nitro-cans work for near flavorless pale beers (i.e. Boddingtons), but for something like a stout which should be full of flavor, it's ""draught experience"" at the expense of flavor."
"Pours out a dark ruby (almost black body) with a moderate sized, creamy nitro head. Leaves some nice lacing. Nose is kind of light from the nitro, but there is a nice presence of roast, dried fruit and a little hint of smoke. Taste really blows Guinness and Murphy's out of the water. I get chocolate, dried fruit, smoke, ash, coffee and wet, sweet tobacco. For what it is it does its job well. Mouthfeel isn't as creamy as the other nitro stouts (which IMO is a plus as it doesn't have such an artificial feel). There really aren't many bubbles on the tongue. Great drinkability. This has always been my preference amongst the 3 big nitro stouts."
"drinkability is good. this is a creamy and drinkable irish dry, but it lacks a bit in body. more richness on the palate would make this one much better as well."
"After pouring from the nitro can and settling into my pint glass, this beer is jet black with a tan colored creamy head. A wonderful site to behold, exactly as you would expect for this style. Aroma is light and toasty and inviting. The taste is creamy, with a lot of coffee flavor. Finishes a little sweeter then other dry Irish stouts. Excellent beer, very well balanced and easy to drink."
"The first hint of good things is the aroma, which is not that muted. It's mild but still quite aromatic with a range of nice qualities: chocolate, coffee, burnt toast, a hint of cherry - more rich and complex than usual. The taste also was unusually rich and strong, with a definite chocolate-coffee character backed up with toast, but not overly burnt, smooth and tasty, with a hint of fruit. It has a nice, light bitterness in the lingering smooth chocolate finish with hints of coffee. It is even a bit oily and quite smooth, tasty, and very drinkable. It shows that even a nitro dry stout can be really good."
"Pours pitch black with a nice thick, creamy head. A hint of bittersweet chocolate and coffee. Roasted malt flavors too. A bit sweeter than other Irish stouts. Very drinkable. It seems that everybody has to compare this beer to Guinness. And if I had to choose between the two, I would go Beamish. Something about the slightly sweeter taste that gives it the edge."
"Drinkablity: Really easy to drink. The taste is stimulating, but the body is light enough that a person can enjoy multiple."
"Pours a dark brown/black color from the can with a short tan head that settles to a thick covering over the beer. Really nice looking beer. It laces the glass very well on the way down as well. The smell is of deep roasted malts, some coffee, some chocolate, some caramel, and a hint of hoppy bitterness at the end. The taste is really good. Very deep roasted malts are the base for a complex layering of chocolate, light coffee taste, and a hint of hoppy bitter at the end. The mouthfeel is very smooth with very tiny carbonation bubbles from the nitro widget inside the can. The drinkability is excellent. This beer does not have alot of alcohol, but it does have alot of flavor. This is my favorite Irish Dry Stout Yet."
"Out of the big three Irish dry stouts, this is my favorite. Unlike Guinness Draft, the body stays strong until the finish and the levels of sweet & roasted malts seem perfectly balanced."
"MF&D - My only complaint is I wish this stout was a little more dense, its a little watery side. Still all in all, Beamish is at the top of the class when it comes to Dry Irish Stout. I believe we can session this one lads."
"a bit watery, but smoothed out by the nitro."
"MF&D- Thick and creamy stout that coats the mouth in a slightly sticky smokey film. Not as dry as the other irish stouts. Very happy with this stout. Actually tried it because fellow Ba member nasty15108 said it was better than Guinness(blasphemy). He was absolutely right. Great thick stout body with a surprising sweet smokey taste. I highly recommend this to all Guinness enthusiasts as you will not be dissappointed."
"D- good D, especially on st pats day!"
"I enjoyed a can of this on St. Patricks Day and promptly followed up with another. Hugely drinkable and quite flavorable (especially comparted to that ""Other"" Irish Stout out there), this was a solid pick-up."
"Decent beer. Nice to see on tap here in Baltimore."
"Drinkability : a good beer in Irish stout style"
"Out of the 3 big Irish dry stouts, this is the best in my opinion. Still very similar to the other 2, but his one offers much more taste."
"Some outliers belie how much most of our 12 tasters liked this beer. 7 out of 12 gave it an overall of 4, while only 2 tasters gave it an overall of less than 3. It's dry and light-bodied, letting it drink easier than you might expect. Some thought ""the roasted flavor was a tad strong."" Still, the flavor is crisp and the smell a pleasant peaty flavor you'd expect from one of the world's most famous stouts."
"A damn good Irish Stout. Basically follows the lines of the other two but I have to say this is my favorite of the three big Irish Stouts. Slainte!"
"This is very easy to drink and probably would be great with car bombs. Easy St. Patricks day beer or when you are feeling Irish and want to be a little different then the Guinness crowd."
"Drinkability was impressive. This was a relatively light yet flavorful beer. A welcomed alternative to the ""other"" Irish dry stout."
"My new go-to dry stout, for sure. I'd have stopped drinking Guinness a long time ago if I'd tried this earlier."
"D - I like it. I'll be looking for it more this weekend during the St. Patrick's day celebrations. It doesn't weigh down your stomach and isn't real big on flavor or smell. Low alcohol makes it easy to session. One of these every now and then certainly wouldn't hurt."
"Drinkability is exceptional. Well, isn't that what this beer style is all about. I ended up taking care of the whole 4-pack and still wanted more. Oh well, next time."
"Taste and mouthfeel - Roasted barley, black coffee and woodsmoke. Light-bodied. The finish is quite dry, leaving a pleasant smoky aftertaste. Refreshing and incredibly easy to drink. Pretty bold stuff for being a mere 4.1% ABV; this is a hell of a lot better than Guinness."
"D: Overall a great irish stout on nitro with an incredible silky smooth drinkability factor."
"D-very drinkable on tap,two or three and I will have to reach for somthing a bit lighter"
"D- Classic Stout, delicious, a beer that you could really enjoy"
"Typical nitro pour - cascading bubbles settling to black with a creamy, off white head. Decent, if subtle aroma. Taste is of watery malt and wet paper. I haven't had this in years, but I remember it being better than this. Not terrible, but rather average even for an Irish stout."
"D: This is a great session stout. Very mellow with a lot of Irish character. Not as bold as more modern interpretations of the style. Very refined."
"On tap at McGillin's... Pours nice and slow, the creamy goodness cascading into the glass. Pitch black with thick off white head that sticks around and leaves great, velvety lacing. Smells of roasted malts, dark chocolate and coffee. Tastes of dark chocolate, roasted malts, and creamy coffee, with a finish of more roasted malts. Mouthfeel is excellent, so very smooth. Drinkability, too is excellent, about the best adjective for it."
"This was similar to others in the style, but I'd consider it slightly better. It's very mellow and blended and could be used as a great session stout."
"d: Tasty and easy to drink. I'll stick to the local stouts, but I am tempted to buy more of these."
"Smell is a bit fuller though. Stronger chocolates and roasted aromas. Taste is where I give it the biggest edge. Definetly sweeter than Guinness, but not over done. Finishes with roasted flavors, and manages to be both crisp and creamy."
"14.9 oz can. Pours nearly black, can see some dark ruby when you hold it up to the light with a 1.5cm tan dense head that is mostly lasting. Of course is does the rolling head display, not quite as impressive as other beers in the class. Aroma is roasted malt and some sweet cream. Initial flavor is sweet, creamy, and roasted all at the same time. Flavor ends on the roasted notes then to a dry, slightly bitter aftertaste. Some lacing, no carbonation once its poured, medium to full body, no alcohol noted. Drinkable, but with better options in the category, might be a long time before I'll be having this one again."
"A rich yet very different stout than Guinness. Less of a creamy head which is fine by me. Good flavour, nice chocolate/coffee finish. Nice bitters finish. A good balance between the two. Wonderful mouthfeel. Very silky. A worthy replacement to Guinness."
"Body is quite creamy, but very thin. It's pretty drinkable but I've got so many other better alternatives I won't revisit this one very often."
"D: Extremely easy to drink, but the dryness becomes a little draining. Creaminess is good though. I have to make the obvious comparison and still give the nod to Guinness although this would probably be a good piece to a black and tan."
"D: This is probably my favorite session beer. Easy drinking that can is good in the summer and winter and in between."
"wow... my first voyage into the Irish stouts. pitch black with a rich, creamy tan head. smells of burnt coffee and a hint of chocolate. for as dark and heavy as it looks, it's extremely drinkable. will definitely get this one again...highly recommended"
"The bitterness is not likely to be too bitter for anyone , which really means it could do with a little more"
"Almost taste/feels like a normal stout was watered down. No real flavor to speak of."
"D- A really easy drinker. I could see drinking a bunch of these if the mood is right."
"now this is Ireland's top dog. the best of the best. black with a thick sticky white head, smells once again like a good pub should. the taste is, for lack of a better way to say it, what irish stout is supposed to taste like. the mouth-feel is also perfect, and it is chug-able as stout gets without being watery. if you see this beer and pass it up, you should probably seek counseling."
"rivals murphys for the best in ireland. rains up and pours looking like an oreo missing the top cookie. smooth, thick, creamy, malty, and a little more grainy than its fellow irish brews. honestly if you put beamish and murphys in a glass most people would not be able to taste the difference, but wait for that little grainy mouth feel in the aftertaste and youll catch it. great beer."
"notes - to my knowledge kegs aren't available on the west coast, or at least that's what i heard at the pub that i go to that no longer carries it. i can only find the cans anymore at bevmo, which are fine, but i love this stuff on draft, does anyone know anything about this and if it's true how to obtain a keg?"
"D: A good brew from Cork, though I do think the nitro-packaging and pasteurization take something away from it, but a good session beer, with its extremely low alcohol content, and mild flavour."
"Poured from a nitro can to a pint glass. Very dark with a much lighter head, not as foamy as a Guiness. Faint roasted malt smell. Mouthfeel light and creamy and the taste, roasted malts, bit of coffee, burnt toast, nice bitterness at the end. I had a few on a gig, a wonderful session brew when getting a buzz is out of the question."
"Lighter and sweeter than Guinness or Murphy's, I probably like it better than Murphy's and not as much as Guinness, but any of the three are great beers and it is entirely a matter of what mood I am in."
"Pours out a great pitch color, you can barely see a pinpoint of light shining through it when you hold it up to a fixture. Excellent head, cascades great at first, with excellent lacing. A nice aroma, nothing too great, just a nice light stout scent. Nice taste, fairly deep, good burnt grains, but nothing out of the ordinary. Goes down excellent, very smooth. A nice alternative to Guinness if they have it at a bar/restaurant."
"Friendlier than Guinness but without the character. Very accessible. Easy drinking. But, still, creamy, rich, bittersweet, clean. Nice head. This one served with beer gas and a sparkler faucet. Good finish. A session Irish Stout, I guess. Wish this was brewed in Ireland."
"It's a decent gimmick that works well if you like your stouts much like I do."
"D- While Beamish is not readily available where I live, given the opportunity to enjoy again, I would choose this over Guinness for the smell and the taste."
"D - A very appealing low alcohol ale. The flavor is big for the strength a top notch Irish stout, Not the best I ever had, but very good and very drinkable."
"This will always be one of my favorite stouts. Never disappoints me no matter where I get it."
"What could be better in 95 degree heat than an Irish Stout? On draft at Branagan's in Fullerton, it has that trademark nitro-stout look to it. Not as rich in coffee flavor as I remembered it from the can, but more addictive on draft for some reason. Just like Murphy's on draft, if I had a bigger wallet, I could line the bar with empty pint glasses."
"Saw this on the shelf at Binny's and I had to pick it up. I love stouts, so I'm always trying more. Beamish appearance was wonderful. A very dark brown, to black, with good creamy head and good lacing. Smell seemed light for a stout, but chocolate smell is there. The taste starts out sweet, and finished dry and roasted. This made for excellent balance in this beer. The mouthfeel was creamy, but light for a stout in my opinion. Drinkability is good for this beer. Could easily session this beer. Overall, Beamish is going to be my first choice for Irish stout. Now that the weather is getting cooler, this will probably be a regular in my stash."
"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not that filling for the style, very mild kick, I suppose if youÂ’re a Guinness fan, youÂ’d probably like this beer, but IÂ’m not so I donÂ’t. Even though I donÂ’t particularly like the style for the most part, IÂ’ve definitely had better Irish Dry Stouts."
"at 4.00ABV, it makes a case for a good session beer. You could easily drink a few of these in mixed company and still be able to hold a normal conversation! It's definitely a bit more watered down that most stouts, but that's part of it's appeal. It's got good taste but doesn't fill you up. Can we say ""Dry Stout Light""?"
"Overall - A decent enough stout but sadly served way too cold... i would choose this over Guinness on tap if i could... worth a try..."
"hasn't got the body of a Guinness, nor the dryness of a Murphy's, but there is personality in this brew nonetheless ...."
"Overall great brew, glad to have back in the states."
"Drinkability: A very nice Irish Stout that isn't as dry as some of the others."
"I've had it many times, but I never found myself in a position to review it. Then I had a few left over from having some lads over for a Phillies game (they won, pretty much a coin flip these days) and I thought, now's the time. I've always enjoyed it, but looking closely made me realize it's pretty close to top of the heap among the true Irish Dry Stouts available. It's a bit more filling than some of its brethren, but with such a practical ABV it drinks like a well-baked, if voluminous, pleasure. There's a case to be made for keeping a sixer of this in the DBF at all times, if only it didn't seem to fly so below the radar."
"I've been drinking Beamish for quite some time and I prefer it to most other Irish Stouts. It's not quite as dry and has a nice creamy feel to it, especially on that first sip. It's smooth all the way to the finish. If you can find this on tap even better but the nitro-can works very well."
"This brew pours a nearly opaque black color. The head is half and inch in height, creamy, white, and does not recedes. The aroma is of roasted malt, cream, chocolate, and coffee. The taste is a lot lighter than the aroma. The are still some nice roasted malt, milk chocolate, and coffee notes, but they are all rather faint. The mouthfeel is light bodied with adequately low carbonation. Overall, this beer has a lot more character than Guinness, but is still only average."
"D- excellent Irish dry stout, sessionable, must try for this style, though i think some American brewers are doing this style better"
"440ml nitro-can from RSVP in Portland. Pitch-black body with just the slightest hints of ruby-red highlights. A good inch of off-white solid head that stays very well (thanks to the nitro). Smells vaguely of chocolate malts. Tastes sweet and roasty with coffee and chocolate playing big roles. Only a slight burnt astringency. Sweet. Flavors stay on the back of the tongue without the carbonation to wash them off. Fairly drinkable. Not bad, fairly similar to (albeit a bit better than) my old favorite Guinness Draught. Would be much better if carbonated or on cask IMHO... Still a relatively decent dry stout."
"The taste is very similar to the aroma. Still quite dry, but it is one of the sweetest of the Irish Dry Stout nitro cans I've had. I like how the nitro charge doesn't completely cover up the malt flavor. Great taste for a nitro stout, but it still seems no more robust than an American brown ale, just much creamier and maybe a bit more smoky. My beer of choice for making black & tans or Irish car bombs on the rare occasion that I crave one or the other. Very easy to drink in large quantities."
"Nice pitch black color with creamy tan head. Probably a bit more bitter than Guinness, but tasty in its own right. Has a bit of a smoke flavor to it. Has a very nice creamy mouthfeel. Aroma is of smoke and roasted malts. I liked it and would have again. Drinkability is pretty high for a stout."
"Poured out with a beautiful bubble cascde ,tan head dark ruby red hues. Mild smell of light coffee. Taste is very light, initially kinda watery but then a coffee type flavor shows through. No hops show through. Creamy mouthfeel from the nitro gives way to watery mouthfeel.Very good drinkable beer,,nothing heavy,,good as a session beer.Head stays until beer is finished."
"Nice tasting Irish Dry Sout. Some sweet chocolate along with some roasted malt, fresh roasted coffee. The coffee and chocolate flavors give this beer a nice mocha like finish and aftertaste. Slightly dry finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy typical of a nitro but features a little more carbonation, which to me is a good thing. This beer has great drinkability. A very good stout and in my opinion much better than Murphy's or Guinness, only thing lacking is a virtually nonexistant aroma, not unpleasant just not much there. Still a good beer."
"Beamish looks like a standard nitro stout in the glass, which is not a bad thing, not quite opaque with a thick off white head. The smell is of roast malt and other burnt/black malts along with black coffee. The taste great notes of dark malts, roasted malts, coffee, chocolate and wood, and a little chalky too. Some bitterness from malts but no perceivable hop bitterness. All in all more pronounced flavor than guinness. The mouthfeel is good very nice and creamy very full slightly sweet finish all together pleasing. Drinkability too is good low in alcohol plus a bit more flavor than guinness makes it more fun to drink, not bad at all."
"You can tell this beer isn't Guinness, but it's such a subtle difference. Maybe a bit sweeter, but I don't know if I'm just imagining things. Still... a very nice irish stout that I'd have no problem having again."
"Drinkability - When you drink a Beamish you can help but compare it to a Guinness. You shouldn't, but you do, for good reason. Both, in my opinion are fine examples of the style. In my opinion, I would drink a Beamish over a Guinness if given the choice. Goes down very smooth and leaves you wanting more. I find the finish of the Beamish to be what wins me over."
"Finish is slightly dry."
"14.9 oz nitro-can. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with almost an inch creamy off-white head. Head retention and lacing is very good. It smells like roasted malt, grain, smoke and a bit of coffee. Tastes like roasted malt/grain, coffee and some dark/bitter chocolate. The beer has a bitter aftertaste, but not very strong at all. Mouthfeel is light, almost a bit watery. Too light/watery than I care for in this style of beer. It's also creamy, smooth and dry. Drinkability is good, it's very sessionable. I'd definitely buy it again if I was in the mood for Beamish, it's not a bad beer at all."
"D- Very Very high in my opinion, this is my all time favorite dry stout from Ireland. Better than Guinness to me and highly sessionable."
"As a former Guinness lover who has found Guinness to be different than what it used to be, seeing this on tap was quite the find. I found it to be much like what I remembered Guinness to be. If you like Guinness, you'll love Beamish."
"D: Absolutely drinkable, easy and smooth. Wonderful dry/bitter finish, fairly clean yet eminently flavorful. I certainly would get this again. There's nothing terribly complicated about it, it's just agreeable and session-ably light. Recommended."
"D - Is what an Irish dry stout should be. Smooth and creamy, not a HUGE flavor but some nice taste. Low in alcohol makes it a great session dry stout."
"Drinkability - Definite repeater."
"D - Excellent. My favorite accompaniment to a nice juicy hamburger, and also a nearly perfect session brew."
"Although it seems more popular on BeerAdvocate than Guinness, I think Beamish just falls a little bit short. The deep black/ruby read appearance is near as impressive as a Guinness, and the taste is as smooth, but I find myself considering Guinness' mouthfeel and drinkability a little bit better. Beamish has the similiar creamy, inch-thick head, leaves a very fair amount of lacing, and the roasted barley taste is beautiful. If Guinness is a 10, which I consider it to be, Beamish is a 9.8."
"The color is black but when put to a light is more of a very dark ruby red..I don't think there is much room for it to improve on the look of the brew as far as a stout goes its pretty much perfect....If i was disappointed with anything its that I didn't smell much maybe roast with a sweet scent that I cant quite make out--but basically very plain smelling-the taste was very good coffee and cream but not to bitter like some stouts get a touch of bitterness in the end very similar to guiness but oh so much better mouthfeel almost like a milk stout- I think the feel of this brew is perfect so so creamy makes me want to keep on drinking them... definitely my nice fav nitro beer when i cant find a micro to drink. sorry Guinness found a new grocery store favorite. I wish I could find this on tap or growler somewhere to see what it tastes like without the can."
"Very nice Irish stout. I'm used to the nitro-cans ruining the experience, but here it doesn't do as much damage as usual. Will get again for sure when I want a beer of this type."
"Pub can at home produced a pleasurable pour as the beer cascades, then settles, in layers. The softest hint of smokey roast in the nostrils precludes a taste that holds a medium soft creamy smoothness, a Guiness with the slightest coffee flavoring. I find it difficult to argue with something as simple and basic as milk... a March-April staple."
"It's not heavy and at 4.1% abv, this is a very drinkable brew."
"D- A great stout that I will move ahead of the other big name in dry Irish stouts. Would like to try this on tap."
"D- Well suited for a night of authentic Irish stouts."
"D - Much more hearty than Guinness. More hops bitterness than I expected, but not unpleasant at all."
"Like I said, I'm not a big fan of Irish dry stout, so I'm not thrilled by this beer. It's ok, once a year, but not something I'd drink a lot."
"Deep, deep ruby red color-on the border of black. Doesnt have quite the huge cascade pour of a Guinness but an admirable looking beer. No real aroma-rather 1 dimensional-somewhat roasted tinge. Good amount of roasted flavor-just a hint of harshness to it. I am not a coffee drinker but this reminds me of a weak cup of coffee. Creamy though rather thin mouthfeel. I could drink this all night. Very drinkable. Beats Guinness in a bad way. My new favorite nitro can if I could find it locally."
"Overall: This is the quintessential dry Irish stout, and in my view it is better than its two more famous cousins. The widget can presentation is imperfect; I would prefer it on tap or, barring that, bottle conditioned, but this is the only way I have been able to get it in Ohio."
"From nitro-can, pours as expected - very dark brown with usual large nitro-head. Smell is mild - some iron and roasted barley...taste is same - very creamy/airy...buttery diacetyl...On this St. Patty's Day, I lined up the three Irish Dry Stouts - They are almost indistinguishable...Beamish a hair thinner than Murphy's...a slight, SLIGHT bit more buttery and sweeter than the other two...like the other two, easy to drink and fun for St. Patty's or at an Irish party, but not a whole lot going in the the flavor department...cool to look at, of course. Metallic aftertaste after a few. This one just lacks the publicity of Guinness."
"Super drinkable, a nice dry stout that kicks Guiness in the arse in my humble opinion"
"Mouthfeel was very thin. I expected so much more from the looks of this one. You would think you might need a spoon for this beverage but it's richness was as thin as water. I will not likely try this one again."
"Overall, this is pretty much a toss-up with Guinness, except for mouthfeel. Tastes a little bit better."
"This is an excellent stout. It pours a deep dark chocolatey brown that is close to black. The smell is substantially more chocolate than the coffee qualities that many stouts exhibit. The tastes continues this trend with a bit of caramel as well. Extremely rich and creamy texture and feel, and I've put away many of these in an evening."
"The beer held a half finger light tan nitro-head, over an almost opaque body with ruby highlights. Left great lacing. The nose was simply a sweet, light roast scent with hints of coffee and chocolate. The taste was very, very dry, with a bit of roast bitterness, and a prominent milk chocolate flavor. There was just a tiny bit of acidity, with a little vanilla. The mouth was quite thin, with low carbonation. A very easy, but entertaining stout!"
"this is one of my favorite stouts. an amazing cascading head that is very creamy and stays even after the beer is gone. rich chocolately flavors with coffee and some caramel. it doesnt leave any unpleasantness in your throat like some other irish stouts. even when drank out of a nitro-can, which usually kills most aromas and some flavor, it still tastes great and has decent aromas. a must try for any fan of guinness."
"This stout had a good appearance, a nice aroma, and a flavorful first sip. I did find it a bit heavy, but I was expecting a little more smoothness. I found the typical coffee note, with a woody and caramel flavor. I recommend to the Guiness enthusiast."
"Pleasant enough, better than the most popular Irish stout in my opinion."
"Overall a very good stout, which I will surely drink again."
"I would say above par with any other Irish dry stouts, above Guinness. A good deal of flavour with a strong coffee richness in the taste and texture. Only a small fraction of which is captured in the aroma though. Some coarse, mineral bitterness but an otherwise creamy body. Average drinkability. Not bad at all..."
"drinkability: high"
"I like this guy more than Guinness for its more chocolately creamy taste. I actually enjoyed this beer more overall on my last trip to Dublin than I did the other big guys from that country. Although my ratings for Guinness might be higher, that is only an objective analysis, whereas subjectively, I enjoy Beamish more for its intangible qualities. It has a better balance of roast and chocolate compared to just slightly bitter roast of Guinness. It's always good to have identifiable options."
"DA: I really enjoy this style and really easy to drink at 4.1 % ABV."
"GET MY BUZZ ON- y (session)"
"What can I say, I love this beer. Poured from a nitro can into a Guinness (what else?) pint glass. Pours the with the typical nitro cascading and settling into a dark brown-black, nearly opaque, beer with an super nice and creamy tan head. Coffee hints in the aroma. Excellent mouthfeel, very creamy, I think more so than its twin brother Guinness. Taste is chocolate, coffe and roasted malt with only a slight bitterness - again with the bitter bite and sourness of its twin. The creamy, slightly sweet aftertaste lingers. The lacing on this beer is amazing. What else to say, if you like Irish Souts, you will not be disappointed. Just as good as good ol' Guiness, but different is also better."
"Drinkability: Smooth, not too bitter beer with anice mellow taste. Couple that with a low ABV and I could drink this stuff for a while."
"Poured into a 20 oz. pint glass from a nitro can, with an inch to half inch forming as the nitro settled. A dark brown color with touches of red at the bottom of the glass. The scent of roasted barley, chocolate and coffee dominating the aroma. The taste of chocolate and coffee with a slight twang of hop bitterness. In the mouth it feels lighter than one would expect, but it has creamy texture at the end. A standard for irish stouts, very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Very enjoyable."
"A rock solid drinker. Pours out to a deep brownish/red/black color with a rich head of dense cream foam. the beer trickels down like a malty sunset, and leaves about a 1/2 inch head. Scattered lace, and lower carbonation. Aromas were light, but hints of roasted malt and dry grain were present. Taste was medium light bodied and totally enjoyable: dark toasty malts give way to a burnt charred wood note and minimal hints of hops linger on the palate. Nice. Mouthfeel was fair, kind of light compared to other beers in the style, but a solid and good level of drinkability added to the enjoyment of this beer. Easily sessionable. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied with a nice creaminess and a very mild graininess in there. Overall, a decent brew."
"better than Murphy's offering and not as tasty as Young's Choc."
"D - high, very poundable, a great stout"
"Very drinkable. A bit sweeter than Guinness, but equally enjoyable."
"Update: 3-17-08 Glad to see this still available. Purchased a 4 pack of 440 ml cans for $5.97 just for St. Pat's."
"Roasty and burnt flavor in a nice balanced mix."
"Lot's of roasted flavor... some good malty deliciousness. Very easy to drink. Not a huge body and nothing overly special... but highly drinkable in my book."
"I tried Beamish on St.Patty's day, cuz it's an Irish Stout and it just seemed like the thing to do. Now I'm not saying I'd never have another, but there are numerous other stouts out there I'd choose over this one."
"D- This beer is smooth dry and has a nice dark malt flavor. I think it would have more depth and flavor if it wasn't in the nitro can. That kind of washed out the flavor but really pumped up the mouthfeel."
"Full bodied and silky smooth. Heavy mouthfeel, almost like a meal in itself. Maybe this will be my dinner. I actually like this much more than Guinness. Seems more complex and more flavorful. Dry finish. A treat indeed. If it is like Guinness, it is very drinkable due to lower alcohol and low carbonation."
"I would say very drinkable and for a change of pace I often order this beer if they have it on tap as the flavor differs slightly from Guinness with a malty and coffee flavor that is more forward."
"Beamish and Murphy's are two brands of Irish stout that I would pick over Guiness any day."
"Very enjoyable brew. I hope rumors of Newcastle stopping import of this are not true."
"Drinkablity: I like it but I have had better It's ok and I would drink it again but I would grab a guinness first.Allthough I would love to try this on tap it would probably taste and feel great."
"Of the big three, Beamish is definitely my favorite dry Irish stout. It has a good deal of flavor and is nicely balanced; it is not overly astringent or overly roasty. If youÂ’ve only had the most popular of dry stouts from Ireland, I recommend that you give Beamish a try next time."
"This beer looked great with a nice thick head. Hard to distinguish the smell of this beer in a smoky bar. Tasted alright, but it just didn't do a lot for me. It seemed kind of watery without a lot of flavor. I could take it or leave it. I guess I'm just not a huge fan of this style of beer."
"It's got a widget! How can you not love the widget? I really have a soft spot for Beamish. Well, it was St. Patty's this weekend, and since the Irish choices were Guinnes, Harp, and Beamish, of course I went with Beamish (and plenty of Bushmill's whiskey). We've begun stockpiling Beamish in my house anyway, due to the rumor that production is to be discontinued this year. This is one of the few beers I'm wiling to drink out of a can (some guy at the bar looked at me with disdain and ordered a Bud Light, but asked to make sure he got it in a bottle, as he eyed my Beamish can). But it's very drinkable and easy to quaff. The widget always produces a huge head, so it's maybe advisable to use caution when pouring. . I hope it's just a rumor, and that in truth we have many more St. Patty's days together with Beamish, as well as many weekends and even week nights in between St. Patty's Days..."
"DÂ—a well made stout, very drinkable. The head is very impressive, much thicker than other stouts IÂ’ve seen. Not sure about the sourness I smelledÂ…that was really odd. 4-5 more of these is not out of the question."
"Drinkability: This is a very quaffable beer. A classic session beer. Dam you Newcastle for no longer exporting to USA!"
"Musings: Definitely the sweetest of the three Irish Stouts in the nitro can. I can honestly say I like the current Guinness product over this. Either way - I'll take O'Hara's."
"But they aren't going to be importing Beamish into the country any more anyway. Beamish, I hardly knew ye."
"Mouthfeel is thick and creamy from the nitro, but starts to feel thin by the end. Super duper drinkability though."
"Absolutely awesome appearance as you would expect. The nitro gives this an amazing cascading effect that is an awwe inspiring experience. The thick Ice cream like coating left after every pull is second to none. This is where the beer starts to fade. I'm a big fan of easy drinking stouts, and no doubt this is easy drinking but for me it comes up short. Smell and taste are similar in that there isn't much of anything to report. A touch of some charred bitterness and a watered grain. Extremely light on the palate to the point where it seems the beer is limp and lifeless. I would love to try this on tap, closer to its home."
"Light bodied with the same creamy (by the way, I like that nice creamy top!), nitro-based effect as a guinness draught, but seems to have less coffee taste than the Guiness. The deep black appeareance looks great. Taste has light bitterness. Considering irish stout beers, I'd say it's not that great, but worth a try."
"Well, I'm sorry to say it, but if Beamish does disappear from distribution here, I won't miss it. You can do far better for the price."
"Very smooth and easy to drink. Well balanced between Hop, Malt and roast. A well made example of Irish Stout. Maybe not everyone's standard (and not the biggest seller) but it's one worth having."
"So, this was a pleasant stout, but was more trouble than it was worth. A plain, non-nitro stout seems like a better bet. Hell, for the price, Anchor Porter runs rings around this."
""
"Black pour with a small but persistent tan head from a nitro can. Smell is a faint maltiness. Definitely some (though small) hop bite in the finish. Tasty enough, I prefer Murphy's myself (for some reason I haven't seen Murphy's stout around here for a while, the Irish red is around though). For me this is a good regular drinker."
"16oz Nitro can. Poured into my Guinness Smithwick All Irish Half and Half glass. It is as black as pitch. Nice cascading effect, but it doesnt last as long as a Guinness. A nice, pillowy thick 2 finger head formed and stayed for the whole beer. Smells of weak coffee. The taste seems a bit on the sweeter side of the spectrum. It leaves a tasty after-taste. Exceptionally smooth in the mouth with very little carbonation, almost tastes flat. Overall, it is a very drinkable beer, not offensive at all."
"this beer is much better than guinness in the nitro can/bottle that we get here in the states."
"D = very drinkable as far as stouts go."
"Drinkability; Yup, very drinkable."
"Overall: Maybe I just don't like the style, but this beer seemed too thin watery and devoid of character."
"Mouthfeel is very good as is the drinkability."
"All in all, I won't seek out this one again, but I wouldn't turn away a freebie, either."
"D: Excellent drinkability for a nitro-beer."
"**I saw where this beer was no longer going to be available in the US and I had been wanting to try it for a while. It will be a shame when this beer is gone."
"cheers..."
"Pours inky-black with ruby highlights. One finger of super-dense biege cream; retains cap to the finish and the lacing coats the glass. Big roasted aroma, with some faint chocolate malt and coffee as well. The taste is straight up roasted barley with a hint of chocolate. The aftertaste is bone-dry with some lingering roasted notes and ghost-like english hops.The malt provides enough complexity to balance the flavor and represent the style well, dare I say better than Guinness! It's smooth and easy to drink but has a creamy texture with a dry finish and some roasted flavor holding on. But the carbonation is nearly flat and the body is medium-this makes for a smooth mouthfeel conducive to session beer."
" This is good tasting stuff, not complicated or fancy but still a breath of fresh air after all those Guinnesses."
"This beer came a dark black with slight purple highlights and a thin creamy tan head that left mild lace. Smells of liquorish, chocolate and cherries. Tasted of smooth sweet red grapes and chocolate malt with a touch of sourness. What caught my attention most was a thin sweetness that permeated the entirety of the flavor and the surprisingly clean finish. Mouth feel was medium bodied and flat due to the nitrogen. With a nice and easy flavor, a clean finish, and a slick body, this is a very drinkable beer."
"Starts extra smooth with a soft, creamy taste. Right from the start, this beer is very thick on the tongue and in the mouth. Settles full-bodied but thinly-flavored. What you CAN taste is mostly a roasted coffee and caramel mix with a little of the oaky hint you get from some heavier wines. Finish is surprisingly light with a hoppy bitter blend that forms the lasting portion of this beer's aftertaste. My suggestion for a good compliment to this beer... breath mints. Especially if you're on a date."
"one good thing about stouts is low alc. content i can enjoy a few more"
"In spite of the its one dimensional taste every once in a while I'll get a hankerin for one of these and I'll grab one. Not a bad irish dry stout."
"This is a suprisingly light bodied beer depite the velvety mouthfeel. I feel it might almost be fair to call this ""Guiness Light", though theres a little less going on in Beamish, that makes it more drinkable and it seems to fair better out of the pub than Guiness, which can be shockingly inconsistent when purchased in stores."
"edit: brain-fart. Meant malty, wrote hoppy..."
"Overall a very smooth drinking beer."
"Poured very dark like Guinness, but I think this is much better than Guinness. It had a very frothy, tan head that was thick and did not dissipate at all. The smell was like coffee, a bit bitter but not bad at all. I also tasted both black coffee and maybe some toffee. The beer itself wa pretty thick and rich like expensive dark chocolate. It was a little heavy but it is drinkable. I probably couldnt drink too many of these but they beat Guinness, usually if a beer has a commercial, it's not that good"
"I've also had this via can and bottle... and it doesn't do it justice. This is definitely one to get on-tap... if available."
"Drinkability is very good. Definitely something that could be consumed all night with ease."
"Drinkability: I can down pints and pints of stout and never get full, so I'm probably not the best judge of this, but I'd say this one is very drinkable. More so than the Guinness draught I had the other night, as I find the roasty and malty characters of the Beamish to be more pronounced and more interesting. Definitely something I could drink for a session without getting too drunk and/ or bored."
"Drinkability: I had low expectations coming in but I am a real fan of this now"
"Could easily drink a few without much thought. Just not one I would go out of my way to get."
"Would I have a Beamish again? Not from a nitro can if there's anything better than MGD available. I don't know if Beamish is dumbed down for export or if it's always been a weak stout but I didn't really see anything to recommend about this brew. There are much better nitro-stouts out there."
"4.10% ABV and a great drinkable brew...enjoy as many as you want."
"Drink Guinness."
"16 oz. nitro can - served chilled in a pint glass. Pours like chocolate milk out of the mouth and after the cascade, ends up with a dense, 1 finger khaki head and a black body with a small amount of red shining through. The head leaves nice patches of foam/lace throughout - you can see the gulps I've taken - and there is a half inch of head left at the end of the beer. In the nose there is a malty/milky sweetness and some dark fruits (raisins). The flavor is the same but with coffee, chocolate, and a mild hoppiness/bitterness. Both the aroma and the taste is a little subdued. The mouthfeel is par for a nitro can - low carbonation, thin body, smooth, and refreshing. It is quite drinkable due to the low ABV and carbonation, but it is a bit up there in price. Overall, despite the subdued flavor, it is still more flavorful than Guinness Draught and one I'd come back to."
"I think this is the stout that Guinness should have been. It has lovely body and thick, smooth, buttery mouthfeel. It seems a bit obvious though ,even though I haven't tried it dispensed in any other way, that the nitro can is stealing some of the zeste from from somewhere in the taste profile. This beer can make a cold fall day a happy day."
"The dark chocolate and coffee is not balanced with anything and the rough metallic finish will not put the product in my fridge in the future. There are too many options available."
"A basic, yet safe beer. Quite similar to Guinness, with small variations. Appearance is jet black with thick whip cream head, albeit on the tan side. Aromas of roasted barley, black malt, and a touch of chocolate, vanilla and coffee. Tastes full of roasteness and moderately malty. The roasted grains give most of flavor: coffee, chocolate, and a burned charcoal bitter. Slightly more roasted than Guinness. Mouthfeel is slick, thick ( because of the nitro) and creamy. Also has a moderate grainy texture and taste. Finishes mildly sweet, bitter, and crisp. Slight powdery finish. Maybe not as dry as it's competitor. Still a pretty good beer."
"I get a really nice pour with this Beamish, almost a rocky head, which is surprising for a nitro can. The first is creamy and I'm surprised by the light body of this stout. The first flavors I detect are bittersweet chocolate and Turkish coffee with a hint of cookie-like maltiness. Very pleasant. The intensity of the roasted malt flavor increases towards the finish with the cookie/biscuit-like maltiness giving way a slightly astringent roasted malt flavor and fairly intense bitterness that adds to a long finish. Lace is left down the sides of the glass as I sip this one while a quarter-inch of foam sits on top of the liquid, all the way to the bottom of my glass. A very enjoyable dry stout!"
"Appearance is for all intents and purposes identical to Guinness, pitch black with the famous nitro-creamy head and falling cascade effect as it's poured. Smell, well, I guess a little roasted/borderline burnt malts...yep that's about it. Taste....more roasted malts...trumps Guinness in that the malts actually taste closer to roasted than burnt...some toast, and the slightest hint of barbequed meat. Mouthfeel is what really kills this style for me...flat and watery...but goes down like water as well. Overall, if you have to have an Irish Dry Stout, this trumps Guinness by a hair, but for gods sake there are countless better American stouts to be had. This pint was put to shame by two pints of Breakfast Stout later that evening on-tap at the Come Back Inn."
"Very smooth and easy to drink, definitely worth a try for those who appreciate a good stout."
"Whereas Guinness seems to have last its way, this Irish Stout has remained consistent over the years. Pours a beautiful dark chocolate brown, almost black with a thick, resilient head that stays with you to the bottom of the mug. Pleasing aromas of chocolate, coffee, and caramel. Tastes very much like a guinness used to, only less bitter. Very drinkable!"
"From the 1-pint nitro can with Â“widget.Â” Pours the color of chocolate milk with a unique two-layer head. The head slowly consolidates into a solid, tan head of very small bubbles which lingers until the end. Color is a dark, almost opaque brown. Nose of toasted chocolate malt, though not in-your-face like some brews; it is subdued. Taste of a pleasantly toasted malt and coffee. Creamy mouthfeel but not as rich as I expected. Crisp, bitter finish. This is a good stout but in my opinion not as good as others such as Mackeson Triple X."
"Poured a very nice black color with some dark red hues and a nice creamy frothy head that did not stick to the sides of the glass. It tasted great it had hints of Chocalate and coffee predominatly with some smaller nodes of hops and malt. Very tasty beer and definatly one of my more higher reccomended beers."
"I really like these nitro cans. Beer exploded from the can to become a dep brown liquid with a foamy tan head that lasted throughout the glass. Smell is chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts. Taste is roasted coffee with a nice dry bitterness. The lingering dry felling is powerfuuly enjoyable. A great beer."
"Overall, itÂ’s an alright beer but not big on flavor. This one could make a good introduction stout."
"Appearance is of black coffee with a beige head that sticks with you! Aroma is a creamy roasted grain scent followed by a CadberryÂ’s Fruit n Nut finish. Coffee asserts itself leaving a soft finish that is like roasted brown sugar. Gentle finish that leaves one ready to order Irish Coffee."
"Overall, a drinkable stout. Definitely better than most other nitro can stouts out there."
"Poured from a nitro can, do I need to even state how gorgeous this brew looks? Cascading foaminess thanks to the nitro can, the head is three quarters of an inch of heavy cream, tan -- dense -- with a solid black body. Smell: Grainy sweetness upfront, slightly sour through the middle -- pleasantly sour -- closing on almost a shrill yet subtle smokiness. Taste: Creamy sweetness from the top that falls down into a thin, rusty bitterness, as the sweet creaminess -- this ""creaminess"" no doubt has everything to do with the mouthfeel, which is unbelievably silky and dense, and lovely -- spreads out in the background. The finish is a slight black coffee bitterness, maybe even a subtle sprinkle of cocoa powder -- the thin hop bitterness is still present and lingers not unpleasantly. Middling carbonation. I dig it."
"Overall, a nice, if unremarkable, Irish Dry Stout."
"RIch dark brown almost black color with a large creamy tan head that never goes away. The smell is not very strong. Some coffee like malts and not much else. Rich creamy taste. Lots of coffee and chocolate with a dry slighty burnt finish. Damn good drinkability. This is one of the better stouts you can get in a nitro-can. Better than Guinness draught in my opinion. Cost less too."
"Probably the best nitro can stout I've ever tried. Not too pasturized, not too chemical-ly."
"Pours a deep ruby/black with a creamy nitrogenated tan head. Some roasted barley notes with hints at tobacco. Faintly mineral in taste with roasted barley and malts. Fair amount of astringency in the finish keeps it a good sipper, despite its low ABV. Texture is smooth and creamy. Maybe a nuance of mintiness in the finish. A pretty good Irish dry stout."
"IÂ’d come back to Beamish and itÂ’s a certain recommendation."
"In a line-up of nitro-tap stouts, they all look pretty much the same. And in my experience there isn't much differentiation in aroma either. That said, I think Beamish is slightly more easy-drinking than the others. The taste is the trademark Irish stout as everyone else has comprehensively explained, but drinking three of these versus three Guinness and you will feel slightly less full. A good beer, but very similar to others. Given the choice I actually would take a Boulevard Dry Stout (on nitro-tap only though, the bottles suck)."
"The appearance is the same as all nitro-can Irish stouts: black with large off-white head. The aroma is unwhelming and consists primarily of roasted coffee notes. The taste is a little better the Guinness Draught, but not as good as Murphy's. If you've had either of the aforementioned beers you know what to expect here. However, Beamish is probably the smoothest and most easy to drink of the three."
"Overall, i think this is, in fact, my favorite of the type, but i have to be in the mood for it."
"Smell is faint roasted malts. Taste is roasted malts, dark chocolate, traces of mocha. Extremely faint hints of can and nitro, not like Guinness in a can (which almost tastes over cooked). Thick, whereas Guinness cames off as rather thin. Smooth, tasty and enjoyable to drank. Easy to down a few of these."
"Pours from the can with the characteristic cascading nitrogen creamy light brown head, but more so than the Murphy's that I poured last night. The beer is a deep brown almost black color. The aroma is subtle with its notes of chocolate, and sweet grain. The feel of this is creamy smooth as it hits my tongue, but finishes with a bit of astringency and bitterness. The taste has notes of chocolate, subtle coffee, which as it warms up begins to become quite a bit more apparent. Again this is fairly light and could certainly use a bit more roasted malt to pick up the flavor a bit."
"A pretty good nitro stout, better than guinness and slightly above murphys"
"Mouthfeel a little thin, but overall a good thing. I can drink this one, but as with all stouts I have tried, one is usually enough in a session."
"All in all a great session beer and a nice companion for the holiday!"
"The widget explodes and a gushing of chocolate milk-esqe liquid arrives. After a simply beautiful cascade, it settles to a pitch black body with a tan head. The nose is full of roasted malt. The flavor is all dry roasted malt. This is more on style than Guinness and overall a much better St. Paddy's day choice. At 4.1%, one can drink this all day. Erin go braugh!"
"Overall-a nice stout especially on tap, sweeter than Guinness or Murphy's but most certaintly comparable to them in quality and appearance. Not a bad stout at all, actually quite good, if you like Guinness, give this one a try sometime, you just may find yourself surprised."
"Saw this is in the store on sale so I figured I would give it a try. Pours nice, good color, nice head. Rich smell that reminds me of other stouts I have had. Very nice black appearance. Reminds me of Guinness, but maybe a little lower on the scale. Very good for the price, however. Very smooth, nice on the palate, though I may have had it a touch too cold. Overall I enjoyed. Go for it if you like stouts."
"From the can: a typical, unremarkable nitro-induced head on top of an obsidian body. Nice lace, thoughÂ…thick, coating, and foamy. Aroma is faint, but has a burnt-grain and charcoal character. Fairly dry, with a roasted (but weak) coffee flavor. I thought that it was sort of one-dimensionalÂ…no real complexity at all. Body seemed awfully light, and almost watery. I certainly like my stouts to have more character and personality."
"Not bad, now if I could find some cans around here I may pick it up instead of Guinnes or Murphys."
"Not a lot of mouthfeel, but this is a good session beer. Would really like to try it on tap."
"This stout is reccomended for those who do not like a real bitter tasting beer. There is a bitter taste but it is very slight,and very enjoyable. The aftertaste is really to die for."
"This is a true Irish beer. This stuff has an amazing appearance. A better cascading effect than any Guinness I've had, and has a thicker, creamier head. It doesn't have much of a scent to it though, but that's a minor complaint. It's really sweet, in a good way, and is so damn drinkable. I could have it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner."
"This beer poured a dark brown color with no real head to speak or. The nose was sonewhat weak, with touches of roasted malt and chocolate in there. The flavor was a bit bland, slightly roasty and slightly chocolate, but overall lacking. The feel was almost watery thin...lacking again. Overall, this beer was not up to what I had hoped. The flavors were thin as was the feel. Eh."
"Can't wait to find this on tap somewhere. I'm ready to hand in my Guinness card...."
"In my opinion, Beamish is slightly better overall than a certain more famous Irish stout; it just seems to be a bit more ""substantial"" in taste and feel. A classic example of a dry stout."
"I used to relish a Guinness tap."
"I'm going to write a short review for this one because not much needs to be said except this: ""it's a stout as a stout should be."" Take Guinness, and make it what you think it should be. Now you have a Beamish. I would give the Murphy's a bit of a higher score for more flavor but otherwise, this stout is very good."
"I am a fan of stout to begin with, so my review might be a bit biased in that respect, but I have to say that Beamish is hard to beat."
"Wow does this thing look like a piece of artwork when poured properly. The ""widget"" in the can gets this thing excited and pours out a beautiful, creamy, pitch black stout. The head was thick enough to lose your keys in. The taste was nice, but a little thin. I was getting a very metallic aftertaste from this. The roasted malt was almost taken over by the off-taste. I believe that I may have an older can and that a fresh pint of this would be fantastic. This is a decent slow sipper."
"I've found the widget infused cans and bottles from Ireland and England to be hit or miss. This one is a big miss, bearing little similarity to the taste, body, and aroma of a freshly drawn pint in the country of origin. Looks very pretty in the pint glass, but that's the only redeeming feature."
"An excelent alternative to Guinness. Beamish poured simmilar to Guinness with its creamy black body and nice fluffy brown head. The smell was on par for the style with a nice hint of coffee on the nose. The taste was better than Guinness in my opinion as it had a nice coffee bite in the aftertaste and was a bit sweeter all around. A good Irish dry stout and definantly worth a try."
"Much preferred over guinness."
"Ok, I just reviewed Guinness from the tap and considering I had Beamish many times on tap as well, I thought it be important to compare the two. Beamish on-tap is nowhere near Guinness. It lacks much flavor other than a slight bitter chocolate flavor and a strong astringency in the finish. Grainy bitterness is strong as well. This one is better from the nitro can imo. When given the choice, always choose Guinness."
"Bass players. Go figure."
"Overall, not bad. The Scot in me might choose this over Guinness if there were a large difference in price, but beyond that I'll stick with Guinness."
"poured black as coffee with big light tan head that stayed around for a while. aroma roasted malts, caramel, toffee, sourness. flavor dry roasted nuts, caramel, toffee, watery, it did have more flavor than guinness. I guess I like my stouts with a little bit moremouthfeel than this one bad not to bad."
"Pours a beautiful, night black colour beneath a thumb thick foam of head. Absolutely mesmerising. Held up to the light, it's still pitch black. Thich head of foam so thick that it's like, well, mattress foam. Nice, real nice. Lace coats the glass like someone is painting it with a roller. Thick and sticky. Smells delicious. Sweet barley, roasted barley, bitter dark chocolate, black coffee and some candy. Tastes a bit sweeter than most dry stouts I've had. And the bitterness is due to the coffee and dark chocolate, not the hops. Though their are a bit of hops in this brew. Anyways, starts out sweet and bready, like slightly burnt toast that's been buttered with candy sugar. Then the dark chocolate balances it with a nice bitterness. Aftertaste is a blend of malts and coffee. Great tasting. The rest goes downhill. Mouthfeel was awful. Which is ironic, considering how great the beer is. Too me, it was lighter than water. If air can be drank, it would have the texture of this. Just very, very light. Ruined the beer. Which is sad. It had so many great qualities, only to be ruined by texture. Could the nitro widget have done this? It's a thought. Anyways, I found the mouthfeel so awful I couldn't finish it all. A little less than half the can was dumped into the sand. Too bad. I'd like to try this on tap, without the nitro, to see if that makes a difference in texture. I've heard people say nitro affects taste and mouthfeel, and I have the same beer with and without nitro. But never has it been affected like this."
"Pretty drinkable, if only that it is very dry, not too filling and approachable by almost anyone."
"Drinkability? Well, the imperial pint would have been a bargain if I had liked it more. I probably will order it again to give it another chance, but not for a while, and in a regular pint."
"Da: I've had this beer before and I'm sure I'll have it again. Not the best stout in the world, but far better than drinking junk-lite!"
"Much like the nitro-can, lots of thick-n-creamy head atop the darkness below. Lots of lacing. Subdued notes of toffee, coffee, and roasted grain. Not as sweet as I recall. Dry. Slightly bitter aftertaste. Decent mouthfeel and good drinkability."
"From 500ml widget can into a Bass glass. Black nitro body. Lots of action with the bubbles that don't know where to go at first, but it rapidly calms down and become mysterious and stable after a minute. Big tiny bubble beige head, eternal and great stickiness. Shy aroma of roasted malt and milk. Light creamy body, texture reminding of vanilla coke, notes of coffee. Very light. Decent, but I can have St-Ambroise oatmeal stout without needing to drive to Ontario."
"-Oelergud"
"It kept its head all the way down with moderate lacing. I hate to say it but I would probably choose this over Guinness from now on. But Guinness will always keep a place in my heart."
"This is an OK stout, but nothing to write home about!"
"One of my favorite beers, and one I often recommend to people who think Guinness is a bit too much for their tastes. Very drinkable."
"This Stout is black as coal. No light seemed to penetrate it at all. Big thick foamy light brown head. The thick foam head seems to dampen the aroma but I did perceive a light hint of chocolate. The flavor has avery strong bittersweet chocolate presence with a hint of espresso like coffee in the finish. A tasty stout out of a can."
"Pours total black with a very thick big head and lace that coats the glass like shaving cream. The aroma is of caramel and some hop bitterness and coffee. The taste has coffee and biscuity notes, with some caramel and chocolate. Drier and more hoppy than Guinness and Murphys. The mouthfeel is super creamy thanks to the nitrogen, a little too processed though. Its also quite watery. Overall a good stout though."
"Friday I found myself closing out the evening at Tom Colison's in Charleston, SC and a pint of Beamish seemed the natural thing to try. The glass came out in a beautiful cascade that I was able to watch subside. Leaving a creamy black/brown drink with a fine brown head. The smell was sweet and malty and quite inviting. The taste was strong burnt malt with plenty of coffee/toffee flavors, but also a sweet undertone that balanced the taste wonderfuly. The feel was creamy and smooth. I will have to finish off evenings with this fine offering when available."
"Low on the drinkability scale for me. Just too sweet."
"Beamish Irish Stout would be a great choice to introduce novices to the stout style. I've often heard that it's a rival to Guinness, but in my mind, they're nothing alike. As far as my personal preference? Guinness Extra Stout gets the nod."
"Bottomline: Personally, I found Beamish to have an overall 'better-defined' taste than Guinness; by that I mean the flavors were crisper and easier to pick out. It's a good stout, and I'd definitely reccommend it if you can find it on tap. If nothing else, drinking it will enhance the way in which you perceive and judge Guinness"
"Super smooth with a mild but pleasant bitterness in the finish that is preceeded by some sweetness. Preferable to that other Irish stout in my opinion."
"This is a beautiful looking irish stout. Very, very dark brown, almost black with dense creamy light brown head. Thick lace formed all the way down the glass and at least a quarter inch of head stayed on top throughout. Slightly sharp hops balance a strong roasted barley aroma. Dark malts contribute most to the flavour, with plenty of roasted and chocolate. Very well balanced by hop bitterness. The roasted barley helps keep the palate dry without being astringent. Slightly heavier body than some other common irish stouts, but still light enough that several can be enjoyed. Slightly bitter, pleasant finish. Definitely one of my favourites."
"The mouthfeel is better than Guinness, more well rounded and less watery. The poundability here is not that of the G, which is quite good because I could kill a 4-pack of G in less than an hour very easily if I didn't restrain myself."
"Taste is quite nutty. What follows is creamy coffee and light bitter chocolate. Smoky and bitter. Did I mention the bitterness? So from hops, some from roasted barley. A milky subdued bitterness. Very creamy and smooth mouth. Very drinkable beer and probably the most flavorful of the Holy Trinity of Irish Dry Stouts."
"Deep black body is topped by a nice off wite head. The lasts all the way down, but this particular sample left sparse lace. Roasty chocolatey aroma was inviting. Taste profile is roasted malts, some chocolate notes and a bit of Vanilla was detected. Interesting but there was something that was not quite as good as other stouts. Very creamy, smooth and drinkability is good. It goes down real easy. Could see having a couple, no problem."
"Nice enough dry stout....nothing to jump up and down about and certainly not my favorite style of beer in the world but decent enough...."
"Drinkability - I think this is very drinkable and an excellent pick on a Friday night. Filling, but low enough abv to have 3 or 4."
"This goes down very easily, like most nitro stouts. I think this has more flavor than Guinness, but that may be because I drank this warmer than I've ever had Guinness served to me. This would make a decent session stout, as it goes down rather easily, and isn't as thick as other dry stout's I've had."
"500 ml nitrocan imported into Canada. Purchased at the Beer Store in Sarnia Ontario tasting date 041704. Very deep black color with a light brown creamy nitrogenated head. Nose is very dry with big roastiness. Mouthfeel is dry, very nice, then comes a big roasted, fresh ground coffee flavor. finish is long and dry and invites you to drink more."
"Rather disappointing without any serious dimension to it. I've had far better beers than this one. Simply didn't work for me. Pass on it."
"Last place among the three Irish nitro stouts, behind Guinness and definitely below Murphy's."
"Not bad. I am just picky I guess"
"I would say this is slightly better than Guinness Draught, but all the nitro-beers taste very similar to me."
"This stout is more ""harsh"" than the other famous stouts, as if the Beamish recipe had doubled the black patent portion. My personal preference leans more to the creamier and slightly less bitter."
"Pours nice and thick with a large foamy head and lots of lacing. its very dark with a brownish head. The aroma is of coffee and chocolate. The taste has hints of chocolate and some carmel. IT is well balanced between a full body and a nice mild bitterness. Overall a good beer for drinking on St. Patty's Day"
"to drink and that aint a bad thing."
"Black in color with a frothy nitro head that lasts and lasts. Looks good to me. Smells of roasted coffee, but just a hint. More roastyness in the flavor with a nice balance of bitter and sweet. Creamy and pleasant mouthfeel. An easy and enjoyabe drink."
"Couldn't smell anything. Very dry and somber feel to it. The taste is really good comparatively to other Irish Stouts. Hint's of chocolate with a very smooth clean finish. No hops to speak of but it left my mouth with a desire for another. Guinness or Beamish? Just because I'm different, Beamish."
"Dark black color with an off-white head. Sweet roasted malts and coffee smell. The taste is slightly sweeter than the others (Guinnes and Murphy's) but still ends dry. Very creamy body and a silky feel. Still a thick body. Slight hints of chocolate and hops. Dry aftertaste of chocolate and sweet malts. I'm more partial to this Irish Stout and will be drinking this one for St. Patrick's Day. All I can say is this is a great beer."
"Pours a pitch black colour with a thick, frothy tan head. As beautiful as any stout I have ever seen. It has a smoked coffee aroma that I have never smelled in a stout before. It was good, but not what I was expecting. The taste was smokey. Strong hints of coffee with just minute flavourings of chocolate. A decent stout, a good session brew."
"Not my first choice of stouts, but it's nice to have a change of pace from Guinness and Murphy's."
"This beer, when poured, is as black as oil with a great nice tan head that is fairly thick that lasts a good bit. The aroma that it had was mild not strong at all. A friend of mine told be to pick this beer up after coming home from Germany, so I did. This beer looked so amazing but when I tried it, it tasted really mild as if I were drinking a coffee watered down with milk. Now donÂ’t get me wrong it wasnÂ’t bad it just wasnÂ’t what I was expecting. It's worth trying but then again everythingÂ’s worth trying once."
"The beer pours a dark black color with a thick light tan head; very nice. The aroma is good. It boasts of black malts and roasted barley. The taste is good. It is creamy and full of black malts. It is light even though it has a dark flavor. It almost seems a bit watery. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent stout. It's nice and creamy with real dark malt flavor."
"Beamish is the only Irish stout brewed exclusively in Ireland. It is slightly bitter with no prominent outpouring of malt or hop profiles -- just a nice roasted territory leading to a long smoky aftertaste. A true pleasure."
"Pint glass presentation. Excellent cascading, as expected from Nitro-tap, with hearty, thick tan-colored head, which had great staying power. Pleasing malty aroma, accompanied with heavy flavors of same, smoothness like you wouldn't believe. Exactly what was expected of an Irish Stout, in my mind. You shouldn't be disappointed."
"Very nice stout here!"
"Poured out a beautiful and dark midnight black color with a cascading and creamy rich head of tan foam. Sweet malt and roasted nuts dominate the aroma. The taste is light and rich, with a dry and roasted bitterness. The body seems a bit watery, but matches well with the rest of the beer and makes this highly drinkable. A very nice dry stout."
"Appearance: Dark brown practically black with a nice foaming tan head with each sip leaves thick bands of lacing very nice. Aroma: Toasted malts as a sweeter bready characteristic than the other dry Irish some chocolate edge to it as well with a mild coffee tone. Taste: Much smoother less acidity in the dry bitter finish of a Guiness much more welcoming and a truer stout in my opinion. Creamy chocolate tones work their way in with the dark roasted malts resembling coffee roasts very nice brew overall a winner. Mouthfeel: Lighter bodied with the nitro tap a nice creamy texture to it makes each sip feel like a dessert. Drinkability: Excellent would probably stand as my choice over Guiness any day."
"Overall Impression: A very mild beer with great complexity. This would make an outstanding session beer, but I could see starting to lose the subtle complexities of this beer after some palate fatigue. If you havenâ€™t found a Stout you like, and you havenâ€™t tried some of the Chocolate Stouts (Youngâ€™s in particular) this would be a good place to start. If you are into Stouts, have to recommend this anyway, really shows what can be done within the style. Enjoyed this beer with some great friends during a great holiday retreat, so that may have inflated my scores a bit, but I really liked this beer! Recommended!"
"Not a bad brew at all. It seems to be a happy medium between Murphy's and Guinness, as it isn't as bitter as Guinness, but moreso than Murphy's. For a nitro-can, this was one of the better ones. This is a good beer for those who want to be different if hanging out in an Irish pub."
"Looks like most other stouts, pitch balck, with a creamy off-white head. Smells lightly of the normal ginerbread, coffe, and chocolate tones that you get in many stouts. Taste has an average stout creamy-chocolate-coffee flavor that is not very impressive. As average of stout as you could find."
"Looks good in the glass nice dark brew with a nice tan head. Mild roasted malt coffee smell. Tastes smooth nice roasted malt with slight coffee, bakers choclate flavors.No real hop flavors or hop taste to speak of. Medium bodied stout smooth and tasty. Good Irsih Stout, could use a little more hops for my taste but not bad at all."
"Mmmm... a good, solid offering. Reminded me of Murphy's a bit...nice light malty aroma. Taste is light, smoky and leaves a pleasant burnt malt flavor at the end. Mouthfeel was light but full enough. Exceptionally easy to drink, reminind you that the abv is quite low."
"A bit to the left of Guinness. Excellent brew, but not spectacular."
"I have just finished consuming this 500 ml can and the remaining glass cling is astouding...I have a mountain range to rinse out of my glass."
"Pretty cool looking beer, once that widget does it's thing. I'm still impressed with these nitro cans and the NASA scientists that invented them for the Beer in Space program of the 70s. Very dark brown body with a 1 inch thick creamy dense sand colored head. Smells of roasted, slightly-sweet malts, but very subtle. Taste starts with mildly roasted malts, and slight bitterness into the finish. I'm also getting some weird metal and cardboard tastes. Very creamy mouthfeel and low carbonation make this one go down easily."
"beamish is very lacklustre in the world of irish stouts. as it often says about second rate horses in the form guide, i prefer others."
"The appearance of this beer was very promising... so the tasting was that much more disappointing. I've seen so many good reviews of this beer I think I'll give it another chance (on tap next time) some day. Easy enough to drink, but there are so many others more deserving of my time and tastebuds."
"Tasted this with glasses of Guinnessand Murphy side by side. I always give the nitro widget high appearance points. The aroma was very roasted malt, a little coffeeish, you can almost smell the creaminess.Had the nitro creamy mouthfeel, roasted malt taste, different than Guinness, and the normal Irish stout dry aftertaste. I rated this in between the other two."
"Not especially full flavored, but easily my choice for a real irish stout. I don't particularly care for the tinniness that the nitro carbonation imparts, but it's a tasty session pint. I prefer this over Guinness, as it has a more complex flavor to the malt."
"Pourred a beautiful creamy black brew with a nice foamy head that will stay for a while. Roasted nose with a little water aftertaste. Very similar to Guinness. I had better stout but this one is not that bad. This beer was drank from a nitro can (very effective for stout I find)"
"Nearly black when it was poured out. Lovely tan head that settled down and remained about a cm high until the end. Nose was pleasant but there was not enough of it for my liking. Still, there was coffee there and maybe even something else sweet - chocolate. The ingredients lists hops but they were certainly hard to catch. I was a little disapointed in the mouthfeel - a little too thin - watery even. Still a good unoffensive stout. Might be the kind to serve someone who figures they don't like stout. Let them get their tongue around this and then lead them into the underground world of beer!"
"I had this on tap at my place with my Nitro setup for awhile as an alternative to the usual Guinness we keep on tap. I am a big fan of this beer as it has all the characteristics of a typical nitro Guinness but with more flavor and a lasting, pleasing aftertaste. It doesn't give off that sour smell and aftertaste that Murphy's does but it maintains subtler notes of espresso and chocolate. Has a richer mouthfeel than Guinness, all in all one of my favorite Nitro beers. Now if we could only get St. Amboise in the states...."
"colored head, thick enough to eat. Butt that was it not much flavor to it almost like Guinness. It had a watery almost empty taste with no lingering aftertaste."
"Had this one out of the 16oz nitro can. Pours a dark color with a thick white head that hangs around a while. Promising looks. The aroma was plain - just a little coffee smell, but nothing else. The flavor was filled with coffee, but that was all. No chocolates, no malts. I didn't care much for it compared with its competetors."
"Better than Guinness, not quite as good as Murphy's, at least in my book."
"Best nitro I've had to date. Lacked that ""frappe"" taste, it really got down to the stout taste. Kept it's dark stout color, and it's coffee and burnt taste. If this was their nitro offering, I'll be looking for Beamish in a bottle or on tap. Until then, the Nitro can will do."
"This beer is average at best in my opinion. Appearance is the nicest thing about it. It is black, though I've seen more black, with a nice looking, tan, 1-2 finger thick head. I didn't detect very much smell at all, perhaps hints of coffee. The beer didn't have much flavor in my opinion and was a little flat. It was fairly light on the palate and was a little watery for my taste. Surprisingly enough, the drinkability is pretty good on this one. It does go down smooth, it just doesn't have a lot of flavor. I'll stick with Dogfish Chicory stout, or Guinness Extra Stout if I desire one in this league again."
"I was a little dissapointed in this Stout. It was very dry, too dry I should say. It had a great pour from the can and it looked great. A nice head that lasted and almost pitch black. The smell was very much roasted coffee and the taste was about the same but too dry for me. The mouthfeel was great. Very smooth, thick, and rich."
"This stout poured the most beautiful cascading tan foam that turned into a wonderful and long lasting head and a wonderful full black stout beneath. The aroma was of roasted malts Â– very earthy. The taste was smooth with a slight bite at the end, but nothing very distinguishable. I usually do not go for stout, but decided to give this one a go and was not impressed. In short, the appearance was great, but the flavor was very bland."
"This brew poured a small head of fine and medium sized light brown bubbles. Its body is an opaque black brown color. It has mild dark malty aroma. The typical stout flavors of coffee and java are there with an initially very smooth taste rising to a mild aftertaste but no strong bits. It leaves an excellent creamy lacing on the side of the glass. I enjoyed this beer as it went down very smoothly although it does lack the strength of some stouts."
"Nitro bottle poured with a rich creamy head. Nose of deep roasted malts. This is a ""light stout"" in that it has the taste characteristics of a stout but they are somewhat weak. I gave it a higher drinkability rate because it is a ""good beer"" and i could put away more than a couple of these easily. This would be a good beer for someone wanting to ease their way into stouts."
"Black in color with a huge creamy tan head, weak roasty aroma, bland and weak flavor, it is thin and watery, yet has a creamy mouthfeel from the nitro, overall very bland and flavorless, not much going on here, pretty much just like the bland Guinness."
"Pours with that great nitro cascade that settles into the very dark brown body topped by a tan styrofoam-like head. This glass actually had a few bugs land in the ehad, and I finished the beer, leaving the last bit of foam and bugs behind! Needless to say, great head retention. The aroma is a bit bitter, and a bit of coffee, but the wife says ""still smells like beer to me!"" what does she know? Decent aroma, but nothing great, It seems to diminish the longer the beer is in the glass. The taste is pretty good, with good roasted notes, some bitter dark chocolate, and decent hops bitterness on the finish. Always enjoyable. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, as nitro-cans seem to be. But this boosts the drinkability, especially in the summer. 90 degrees, and I had both a Beamish and a Guinness draught. Both are great and refreshing light bodied stouts, but the Beamish has so much more taste. A good mass-produced stout."
"A dark black colored stout with a medium creamy head. Roasted malts, slightly sweet. Slight hoppyness. A lighter bodied stout. Good flavor. Mouthfeel is a little thin. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, roasted malts. Nitro can does not add or detract anyhthing from this beer."
"Wow. Thick tan creamy head that never seems to want to go away. Stays with the beer all the way to the bottom. The smell is earthy, roasted grains, and a hint of hops nestled on the bottom. The taste is very malty, lots of roasted grains. Still feels slightly carbonated as it dances around my mouth. Not as thick as Guinness, but still very fulfilling without being simply ""filling""."
"On a dark and cool rainy night, nothing seems to be more gratifying than a nice stout. As an alternative to Guiness, Beamish certianly does the trick. Same nice pour out of the nitro can- it's just so lovely to look at even though it is such a manufactured product. The beer settles into a nice black base with creamy tan head. A little bitterness in the aroma, but this dies down quickly. Taste is full of flavor, roasted chocolate flavors, slight bitterness (not much on the way of any sour flavors like Guiness) makes this stout a pleasure to drink. Dry and smooth, this is one of the more drinkable stouts I have had."
"Lee's Discount Liqour (Huge beer selection) was having a sale on Beamish 3.99 a 4 pack of 16 oz nitro cans. Sounds like a good deal. I had Beamish once before at a bar when they ran out of guinness on tap and i was impressed, so i bought some. First off you get the awesome cascading effect of the nitro can and when poured right it will settle a nice pitch black with a small thick head. The smell is slight but pleasant with a hint of roastiness (I'm pretty sure it isn't a word). The taste is nice and mild, once again a mellow roasted taste and some nice maltiness. The head retention is amazing and it almost looks like icrecream atop a rootbeer float. The head laces the glass nicely and the mouthfeel is creamy and delicious. This beer is pretty damn good and if your'e looking for an irish stout via the store I would skip the guinness draught cans and grab this instead. very drinkable. So basically I killed this 4 pack immediatly and went and bought a case. It also works great for black velvets, black and browns etc. floating really nicely."
"Black as night, with a head the color of chocolate milk. The head is deep and thick and perfectly symmetrical, and rises to the top as the beer cascades slowly to the bottom of the glass. It's a full pint, so it fits the glass perfectly. The smell is light, of hops only, but the flavor is of roasted malt, chocolate, and toffee, with an aftertaste of bitter chocolate, coffee, hop, and smokey peat. The mouthfeel is silky, and the head leaves rings around the inside of the glass, nearly coating it as it descends. It's a shame I only have one."
"it poured sandy brown out of it's fancy-ass can and began what i like to refer to as the chocolate cascade-the building of the stout.it built to a dark near black body with a big old creamy head that stays for the duration. a great appearance! scent of espresso and coco with a light alcohol smell. the mouthfeel is not unlike a mocha milkshake, frothy and refreshing. it's exciting. i find beamish creamy and full of coffee notes with a dark chocolate that is like dry silk. i believe it has a smokeiness and even an oaky set of 'hint' flavors. beamish lingers insucha way on my palate that i just have to drink it again and again, i never, or...ehe...rarely get fulled up. i think it burps either rarely, never or with a great deal timeand effort. i don't think i could suggest this (can offering) over any other stout if the other stout is on tap, however i do find the can consistant from one to the next."
"This drinks smooth and is a very drinkable beer. I recommend it without hesitation."
"Comparable to Guinness Stout, only a little sweeter. Ebony in color with a big cascading frothy and foamy head. The lace is fairly clinging. The aroma is malty and slightly smoky. The full malt body is peaty and lightly grainy. Amply hopped with a tea-like bitterness and hint of citrus. Slightly sweet and really smooth and velvety. Gulpable and actually fun to drink."
"Walk into the cavern of darkness, with the aroma of roasted grains filling your nostrils. Let your tongue luxuriate in the creamy goodness of this moist lady of lace. Mild, smooth, lightly perfumed, I can drink in your sweet goodness 'til the bittery end. Exquisitely crafted to pleasure your senses -smell, look, taste and feel."
"pours a deep dark brown/black with a thick, lasting head. smells of coffee and chocolate, and the taste echoes the smell. whilst most irish stouts pretty much taste the same, this one is a bit creamier/sweeter than the rest. very easy to drink and always a possibility for a session beer if available. a solid brew."
"I tried Beamish to answer the question: How many Guinness Draughts are there in this world? The answer: Many. There's nothing unique about Beamish at all, and to be quite frank, I think the world of Irish stouts needs a little more variety. The taste is decent but it just makes me want a better stout. Dark, but it doesn't pass the flashlight test. When it comes to beers of this type, spending the extra few dollars is the only rational decision."
"After my trip to Ireland a year or so ago, I became one of the folks who maintains the often-held perception that Guinness in Dublin is better than Guinness here. And in this case, I'd say that, at the very least, Beamish *here* is better than Guinness *here.* Now, Dublin might be another story..."
"I have always battled back and forth on whether I prefer Beamish over Guinness, and I think I still go with Guinness. While Beamish's nitro can does do a nice job of capturing the draught flavor, the cascade that you get with a Guinness is not the same. The smell of the beer does have an aroma reminiscent of coffee. The flavor is very good and the hints of coffee and chocolate are a pleasure. It is a thin feeling beer in your mouth and thus it does not load down your palate, which makes it highly drinkable. I find it a tad bit smoother than Guinness but loses some of the bitterness. Overall, if the bartender says we're all out of Guinness, how about a Beamish, I'll definitely survive."
"This is a nice stout-in-a-can. And you even get a full pint, as opposed to Guinness, which I've always felt has cheated me out of that extra 1.1 oz. per can."
"I recently had a fresh can of this, and it was exactly the same as the outdated one. My marks stay the same..."
"Pours black in color with a smooth, creamy khaki colored head. Beautiful cascading action in the glass from the nitrogen is inline with other canned nitro stouts utilizing the ""widget"". Aroma consists of coffee, roasted malt and dark chocolate. Full-bodied mouthfeel that's creamy and silky smooth. Taste consists of roasted malt and dark coffee. Finish has a dry bitterness to it. A very likable stout that seems almost identical to Guinness Draught. Beamish may have a slightly more pronounced bitterness to its finish."
"Poured black as night with a creamy (nitrogen), tan foam head that left good lace and coating down the glass. The smell was very nice: sweet, creamy malt with a bit of yeast. The taste was modest: mostly roasted malts with a bit of sweetness and a little hops in the finish. The mouthfeel was clean, fairly dry, with moderate carbonation, but a bit thin on body. The drinkability was quite good. This is an excellent session stout -- very smooth and easy to drink."
"happy st. patrick's day!"
"Poured a thick black color with a thick creamy tan head that stays till the end. Cool cascading effect while pouring, settles rather quickly. There was a smell of coffee and some chocolate to it. Taste of chocolate, coffee and malts with a slight peanut taste at the end. Thick creamy mouthfeel almost like a chocolate milk shake. Drinkability is good, all in all very good."
"One of my favorite stouts,poured nicely with the widget can nice wavey appearance and great creamy head that stayes.Smell is very creamy of coffee and hint of chocilate.Taste is nice and coffee-like and the hops are more prevalent than some other Irish stouts(u know who Iam talking about).Will be drinking this today thrue tomorrow for St.Patty's day."
"Highly drinkable and a nice compliment to corned beef and cabbage."
"Beamish In the nitro-can, with the widget: Nice looking pour, with the tumbling head. The beer solidifies fairly quickly, leaving a pale almost white head. The beer itself is a rich deep ruby, very dark. The aroma is very nice, with strong scents of chocolate and coffee. This beer has less body than its well-known competitor, but the taste is drier, with a very nice taste of coffee. There are hints of hops toward the end as well. Very pleasant."
"this beer is so similar to guinness and murphy's. i'm not even sure if i could pick it out in a blind taste test. still, it's a yummy stout. beautiful pour and nice creamy roasted malt taste. i recommend this if you're looking for a nice dry stout. it was also very inexpensive at $4 for a 4 pack of big nitro cans. highly recommended."
"The beer pours jet-black with the head modest in size and a light chocolate in color, the consistency creamy and the resultant lace a fine sheet to conceal the glass. Toasted grain nose, hints of coffee, sweet and quite pleasant to the old schnozzle and the start loaded with malt, the top slim in its feel to the palate. Finish has a nice but understated hop bite, quite mild on the carbonation, bittersweet chocolate dry aftertaste, and a fine stout in its on right, and to me the equal of Guinness, but not the better, that is my humble opinion."
"It's opaque black. The head is awesome; large, thick and creamy. There wasn't much of an aroma, just a hint of roasted malt. Such a highly drinkable stout, there is pretty much roasted malt flavors and creaminess. The mouthfeel is a little thin though. But the drinkability makes up for that. This is a stout I will go to when I feel the need for quantity along with quality."
"I don't think the tastes suffered too much from being 1 1/2 old. A fresher version could have offered fuller flavors. But I think it's clear Murphy's is better than both Beamish and Guinness."
"I sought this brew out at dinner at the only spot around me that carries it. Im glad I did. It pours almost black with a frothy tan half-inch head or collar. The aroma of roasted malts & coffee. The taste had hints ( not overpowering bitter burnt ) of roasted malts, chocolate & coffee. The body was abit watery or lighter than other stouts. That may aid this brew, an easy drink with foods or desserts. Mouthfeel is left a creamy dry. I'll seek it again, but at this place, at 4.50 each, perhaps once in awhile is good enough."
"Cheers"
"Purchased a 4-pack of nitro cans - a treat every stout lover must indulge in every once in a while. This brew poured a deep, dark brown - almost black but not quite. The head was slightly off-white and had a mousse-like texture. The cascading in the glass was also pretty impressive - gotta love that widget. The nose and over all taste was kind of a let down however. Personally I thought the smell was a mix between chalk dust and flat budweiser. It also had a very watery mouthfeel and not much body in the taste - simple chocolate and malt and not much else. Nonetheless this was a good buy - easy drinkin', not too expensive, and definetely worth a try."
"There si nothing fantastic here, but it is a good solid irish stout. It is pretty dry and roasty. There is a good roasty flavor with a touch of chocolate in there. Bitterness comes in a bit at the end. The carbonation is very mild, and it is just a creamy brew. A very good mouthfeel that is silky and very enjoyable. This is sure a superior to Guinness, but it is nothing incredible."
"Read any review of Guinness and there you have Beamish, with a couple of notable exceptions. First, this is a cleaner brew, with a crisper, dryer finish. Second, this beer seems even lighter and easier to drink than the standard Guinness Draught. Great session beer."
"I think this is my new breakfast beer."
"This beer, like any other nitro-can brew, looks great. Ink-black with the faintest ruby notes at the bottom of the glass. Beautiful, thick, tan pancake head that lingers forever with sparse lacing (probably because I drink the stuff down so fast it doesn't have a chance to stick to the glass). At the bottom of my (ahem!) Guinness pint glass, I still had a 1 1/2"" head. Carbonation is mild. Could I tell the difference between Beamish, Murphy's and Guinness in a blind tasting? Sure, but I'd have to cross-train my tastebuds with some malt push-ups and and roasted barley sit-ups. This beer smells rich with roasted grains and coffee, and is probably closer in aroma to Guinness than Murphy's. The mouthfeel is luxuriously smooth, soft, and creamy with a medium body...highly drinkable. Uniquely, this brew has a definite roasted barley graininess, is clean of any metallic overtones, has a slightly more astringent black patent finish and mellower finishing hops. Starts with distinct roasted barley, fades into a mild malt background, and ends with both astringent black patent malt and perfectly balanced, smooth bittering hops. A subtle smoke and cigar ash note is detected towards the finish. Delicious...recommended over Guinness for it's subtle complexity."
"Picked up a pint can of this in a mixed sixer. Poured a solid black color with a thick cream colored head that lasted the whole brew. This was my first experience with the nitro can, I love the fizz that comes out as soon as you pop the top. Aroma was of dark malts and maybe a hint of chocolate, not a real strong aroma. The taste seemed a bit watered down, though it wasn't bad. Roasted malts dominated the taste with a little sweetness. I felt the mouthfeel was the lowpoint of this beer. It seemed to have absolutely no carbonation. It was smooth but the mouthfeel was like water, no it was like skim milk. Overall I liked this beer better than I thought I would, and I would drink it again."
"Notes: mixed the last half a glass to make a black and tan, the result was still sweet and tasty."
"Quite quaffable indeed..mmmmmm mmm mmm"
"A nitro-can, poured into a wide-mouthed glass. Virtually black in color, with a beautiful, fine, sturdy tan head. Aromas: soft, sly hints of cocoa, coffee, and nuts. Dry, yet a touch on the sweet side. Some initial bitterness and grit on the palate --does it come from the can? I can't shake a certain metallic tinge. No, it continues throughout the finish. The brief and uneventful finish, if I may say. Not as creamy as the nitro-Guinness Draught, but nowhere near as full-bodied and full of character as the best stouts in the world. Very forgettable. Pass me the darts, mate."
"Hmmm, that's pretty good, I may have to have another. (just to confirm my impressions, you understand...)"
"I must say that nitro-can widgets annoy meÂ…"
"Very nice Irish beer. How could you go wrong? Although the saying pertains to whiskey, this rings true to Irish people and thier beers as well. ""God created whiskey, so the Irish wouldn't rule the world."" Now, I must say that I am a huge fan of Guinness and Murphy's, but this is also another great stout. It starts off bitter, but finishes nice and smooth. I could drink this stuff for days, but I have work and a liver, so that is a little hard to do."
"Black as Guiness, but a much richer flavor. I didn't find the smell particularly persuasive. However, the taste makes up for this. There are definite coffee tones. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth. You might as well be drinking water. As a result this beer is has a high drinkability."
"Nice appearance (like guinness). Taste is very average (hops and malts). A bit sweeter than others though. Quite refreshing and goes down easily. The alcohol level could be a bit higher though to make the beer a bit stronger"
"I really have to give the person that invented the nitro-can some credit. It's just as good, if not better, than the draft pour. It's opaque black with mahogany highlights at the base and collar, and the head is quite impressve: light tan in color, dense and creamy, and astonishingly long lasting - literally lasting to the bottom of the glass! The aroma is lightly fruity and deeply roasty with some mild bittersweet chocolate, some soft dry tobacco, and stale wet coffee grounds. The body is light but appears much fuller due to the intensely creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is roasty from start to finish, but also includes some fruit and nicely sweet malt up front, a very mild caramel note as it warms in the mouth near the finish, and a lingering roast and bitterness. This is clearly milder than the Guinness that it emulates, and I think I find this preferable. It's softer and less bitter, with a touch of chocolate, and much less acidic throughout. An easy drinking beer with some nice roast character."
"On tap this beer beats out Guinness easily in my book."
"A thing of beauty in the dimpled pint pub mug.  Jet black with a perfect creamy tan head, thanks to the nitro widget - looked like chocolate milk as it poured.  Aroma was a pleasant roasted malt, but nothing stands out.  Flavor is a pleasant dark-roasted malt.  A hint of coffee and chocolate, but just a hint.  I did not get any peat smoke, as one often finds in dry Irish stouts, but it might have been hiding in the roasted malt flavor.  Flavor was not as roasted as Guinness, and not as assertive as Murphy's.  A bit on the mild side, but very pleasant.  Mouthfeel was this beer's downfall - very thin and watery, even for a nitro can."
"A very dark brown liquid emerges from this nitro can offering. It has a very creamy tan head that lasts the duration of the brew... looks pretty good. The smell is of subtle toffee and maybe just a little roastiness, but both are indeed faint. The tastes of toffee, roasted malt and coffee are present and well-balanced. The mouthfeel is a bit thin and watery, but this is an easy drinking stout. I also prefer Beamish to the Guinness nitro cans... on tap is a different story, however."
"Extremely dense, two-finger head which was tan. The beer itself wasn't completely black, just very, very dark red. Nice hop aroma, but above all it had a great roasty malt aroma and a little bit of smoke and toffee. Toast, coffee, and a little of both sweet and sour in the mouth. The aspect of this beer that stands out the most IMO is the mouth feel, rich and substantial. By far this is the best nitro can dry stout. I would love to try this one draught."
"I actually prefer this brew to Guiness, it pours with a nice creamy tofffe like head and leaves a nice lace.  The smell is somewhat on the roasty side and has a very good mouthfeel.  The taste has a good mixture of choc. and coffe very well balanced.  Goes down rather smooth...........CHEERS"
"This is pretty much a carbon copy of the canned Guinness, so it has all the same strengths and weaknesses. I would always choose a draught over a can but this is great for home use. That widget definitely has a Pavlovian effect on me. I salivate now whenever I hear it. If Budweiser ever figures that out I am in trouble."
"249"
"Had this today at McGillian's Old Ale House, a very nice Irish bar, but the beer list is less then great. AnywayÂ…Pours a solid black, with a solid creamy head. Aromas of roasted malts. Mouth feel is just super creamyÂ…excellent!  On the palate roasted malts, coffee notes, slightly dry etc. I think this stuff is better then GuinnessÂ…great stuff."
"I prefer this ""widget can"" stout over the same type of product offered by Guinness. It has a slight hop aroma and lacks that sour ""tang"" that Guinness is (in)famous for.  don't get me wrong, I like Guinness on tap, but if I had to choose between the two in the nitro cans, the Beamish is preferred."
"Fun to watch cascade. Tan head, thicker than tap version (had both same night). Slightly (ever-so) sweeter than the tap with stronger roasty hints on the nose and tongue. Dry. I still think Guiness on tap is the benchmark but Beamish and Murphys do a number too."
"Typically impressive ultra dense, thick and well - retained tan head from the nitrogenation.  Deep garnet and clear when held to light.  Chocolate malt aroma w/ a subtle coffee - like roasted barley note. Pleasantly sweet at first, followed by a light but lingering roasted barley and hop bitterness.  There's less roasted barley sharpness and hop bitterness when compared to canned Guinness and more chocolate malt flavor. Very mild diacetyl butterscotch is perceptible and complements the chocolate malt flavor.  Fairly full bodied from the use of flaked barley w/ the usual nitro induced super smooth mouthfeel. Finishes w/ a lingering bittersweet chocolate flavor.  Beamish is more flavorful and rich than canned Guinness and isn't nearly as ""dry.""   An enjoyable brew."
"Thirty seconds of cascading head, settles in at 1/2 inch of jello-like head,  with thick-walled bubbles in the middle...A little maple sugar in the malty aroma.  Quite mild in mouthfeel solid roasted malt flavors with coffee impression.  Stays pretty well away from bitterness.  As usual, minimal detection of hops.  Pretty satisfying, maybe a tad fuller if not better tasting than Guinness ""nitro"" Stout.  A little less head sticks to the glass than in some nitros."
"Fuller than Murphys, but slightly thinner than Guinness.  Nitro smooths everything, but some lingering hoppiness in aftertaste.  The middle of the road of the three Irish nitro stouts, and the one you're sure was brewed in Ireland."
"Beamish surpasses it's more famous and overrated counterpart (Guinness) in almost every way. It is a bit thinner, but the richer slightly sweeter flavor with chocolate/coffee tones definitely make up for that."
"Rubbery anise, chocolate and coffee nose. Sweetish start with a thin, creamy mouthfeel, better than Guinness. More roasty malt flavours, but still pretty cloying at times, like it, but its not insane."
"Bought this when the packy was out of that other popular stout and found it to be superior in every way.  Roastier with a little more body, it goes down like water(without tasting like it).  Extra bonus- comes in a full 16 oz can, not 14.9 oz like the other canned stouts."
"In the can, this is a better pick than Guinness. Full roast malt flavor, excellent texture, and perfect balance. Sweet and rounded, none of the mass-produced chemical flavor that one can sometimes find in Guinness. Haven't yet encountered on tap so can't compare in that respect. However, in the can, this is a tasty and satisfying Irish stout, and since Guinness cans leave me with a bit to be desired, this is the superior choice."
"Soft roasted malty nose. Toasted smoky malt flavor modestly balanced with bitter hops. A noticeably dissonant metallic bite. Decent drinking stout, almost, but not quite as good as, ..."
"Man this pours pretty, smells of licorice and molasses. Faint licorice taste with a roasted overtone, fairly watery and thin tasting, sweet taste throughout that slightly dries near the end. This beer very thin in feel, the head contributes some thickness, but not enough. This stout was rather one-sided and thin, but because of that was downed pretty fast... a session beer, but not as satisfying as other commercial stouts."
"A very good stout. Comparable and a fine substitute for Guinness."
"Slightly sweeter than the rest (Guinness, Murphy's) and a bit under-rated. To me the differences are so sublte that they all might as well be the same beer, but Beamish tends to be a bit more superior in my book."
