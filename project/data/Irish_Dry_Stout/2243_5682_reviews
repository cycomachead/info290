"Compared to the two other beers I tried at The Porterhouse (the Oyster Stout and Hop Head), this beer was very bland and just didn't have any character. I guess that's why they call it ""plain"". I'm a dark ale fan, but this Porter just wasn't cutting it for me. Thankfully the other two beers I tried were incredible."

"A perfect stout, add some great hops, and you get a great beer. Quite a surprise. Somewhere between a porter and an Irish stout, but its body sets the style."

"A nice stout with enough depth too keep it interesting, and not too heavy to drink."

"O- Not much to say about this beer. It's better than average."

"O-good flavor in this dry stout, confusing as it is labelled a porter"

"O- After first pouring and smelling this brew, I was a little worried that I was in for a disappointment. However, this ended up being a very easy drinker, with some solid taste to it. Would I drink another if it was offered to me, absolutely. Would I make it a point to actively seek this out and purchase, probably not."

"Strong, smoky aroma has notes of coffee and molasses and a hint of unsweet chocolate. Pours a dark-chocolate brown with a VERY thick light tan head, lets a peak of light in only at the very bottom. Lip-smacking flavor has caramel, molasses, coffee and unsweet chocolate notes with a hint of hop bitterness and another of honey sweetness; the last two balance each other nicely. Body seems to be on the thin side, and fizz leaves a bit to be desired. Overall, though, a good Porter - not really plain."

"O: Very enjoyable and very easy to drink with the light amount of bitterness and very pleasant roasty flavors and smells. Very enjoyable mouthfeel with the smoothness."
"O: While this beer is light-bodied, airy and easy to drink, it doesn’t shy away from packing in a good amount of roasted malt flavors. I also found the smoothness and creaminess of the mouthfeel to be rather enjoyable."

"Just had this twice on tap at The Porterhouse at Fraunces Tavern in New York City (@ Broad st & pearl st). A dark black porter with a beautiful inch of rich head formed of tiny bubbles (nitro). Smell is slightly acidic and alcoholy. The head is as creamy as it looks and the dark malty notes of the mid-body perfectly balance the richness of the porter. There is classic British hop bittering and tasty minerality to the finish. In short this is the best porter I have ever had. If you are in lower Manhattan you should definitely try this amazing beer."
"O - A decent beer, one that I've found to be much beter in the bottle than on nitro-tap as it's served in the Porterhouse bar, and since I live near the brewery, it's one I sample often!"

"330ml bottle.Pint glass.Enjoyed on may´11.Pours brown in color.Close & dense beige froth creates a lasting crown.Roasted malt & cocoa aromas. Coffee at first sip.Dry bitter mouthfeel. Quite flat flavors.Medium body,correct carbonation.Black chocolate notes on the aftertaste.Ok as a session beer."
"Showed up last year for the first time ever, I think their pull tab caps are pretty interesting I've never seen anything else like them. I had the Wrasslers XXXX Stout and Porterhosue Red last year, neither were stellar but both solid in their own regards. Here's the Plain Porter, forms a dark cola coloa nearly opaque let's reddish ruby highlights shine through around the edges. Billowing tan khaki head forms nicely with big chunky layered lacing. Aroma almost dirty earthiness with dark dry roasted nearly burnt malts coming through, maybe a hint of lingering butterscotch well hidden in the matrix. Nice cereal grains entrenched within the malts going on feeling very natural and well developed within the true Irish brewing tradition. As it warms up a nice cocoa powder tone arises along with some layered complexities that weren't initially there as it warmed up. Flavor is dry throughout, alcohol flavor more evident than it should be in a beer that's literally 5.0% abv. I'm not sold on the flavor the hops used in the bittering additions are over the top it doesn't let the malts and semi sourdough bread tones shine well enough. Dark roasted mint/herbal tones hidden in the earthy complex dark chocolate tones. Mouthfeel is fuller bodied with enough balls to stand up to any American stout or porter. Overall a classic drinking Irish beer that should be more widespread than it currently is, these guys aren't extreme for the sake of being extreme, their just trying to be flavorful with all of their styles in a mass market Guiness/Murphy's/Beamish driven culture."

"This is a delightfully approachable porter. Velvety smooth and highly drinkable."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Irish Dry Stout."
"Overall, quite drinkable and reasonably tasty stout, but I would prefer if it would be less sweet."
"Overall not bad, nice creamy flavors, dry finish, nice hops, but roasty, overall pretty good."
"this is what guinness should aspire to be"
"O - A new frontrunner for Dry Irish Stout. Too bad I can't get this everywhere."
"D. A below average porter that really disappointed me. I was hoping for much more."
"Overall: I know they were attempting to make a classic Irish Dry Stout, but that's no excuse to make something boring. This beer is a bit too thin, watery, and close to the macro stuff to praise it. Grab a Wrasslers XXXX; the name in ""Plain Porter"" speaks for itself."
"Hops -- Galena, Nugget, and East Kent Golding"
"Dr: A flavourless porter that isn't worth its high price."
"And that is not a compliment"
"D - Complex and unusual. There is a nice roast quality that is complimented by complex caramel malt flavors. This would make for an interesting and drinkable beer by itself, but the spicy notes in the finish really put it over the top and make it something special."
"Overall - A very good porter... recommended.."
"Easy drinking, but nothing too special."
"D - Nice sessionable porter."
"M/D: This is a very drinkable stout, rich, creamy and full of flavor. A very nice example of the style that dominates Dublin and one of the better ones at that."
"Overall, a great representation of an Irish stout. I like the Wrasslers 4X and Oyster a little bit better than this one, but it's still an amazing brew."
"A good stout that scores extra points with me for uniqueness."
"One topic that comes up now again is how to clearly separate a porter from a stout. Until now, my reference beer for porter was Sam Smith's, but this Plain Porter has now become my defining example for the style. I had this on draught at the Parliament Street Porterhouse. It is a deep brown/black with the barest ruby glow. The head is a thick medium brown and quite persistent. The dark malts star in this brew, and keep on the chocolate part of the spectrum without getting the roasted grain edge. It is an easy drink that has the complexity to maintain your interest through several pints."
"A very drinkable stout, full of rich roasted malt flavour. That said I'd have preferred if it was served a bit warmer and on a standard tap as opposed to the nitro"
"This Porterhouse offering came out dark black color with the velvety tan head. Roasted aromas with coffee standing out a bit more. There's also a sweet fruit element with some residual sugar taste in the backdrop. Flavor repeats itself. Coffee flavors are noticeable and somewhat earthy and bitter. The sweetness is chocolate like and maybe even raisiny. A smoky dry finish. Body is not quite as creamy as I was hoping for and on the thinnish side. A solid beer with some flavor to it. But the flavors didn't really do it for me personally. One pint and I was ready to move on."
"M&D: smooth on the mouthfeel and medium-bodied, it retains the creamy fizz to be lively enough to be a quaffable beer. Perhaps it could be more flavoursome if it was served 4 Centigrade higher? Otherwise one just have to wait and chat with other punters before going for a satisfying sip."
"Dark black with a small white head of foam that lasted and left nice lacing. Aromas are of roasted malts, a bit of vanilla and caramel, coffee, and chocolate. Taste is similar to the aroma with a nice roastiness up front and a chocolate and coffee finish. Mouthfeel is pretty creamy as well, but this stuff is eerily similar to the XXXX stout. Drinkability remains nice."
"Doesn't stand up to their oyster, though it is quite good. Slightly smoky with a bitter finish. A nice example of style."
"Maybe after a while it can impaste the mouth."
"similiar to the other two dark beers that the Porter House makes, but just slightly better than the Oyster Stout, creamy, which i didn't like (nitrofied). Nice balance between) the lightly bitter roastyness, and caramelly flavours, some hops in the finish. Pretty tasty."
