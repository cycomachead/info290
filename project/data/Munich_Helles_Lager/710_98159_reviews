"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, a bit of malts. Taste is crisp and light, some hops, malts, kind of mild. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a refreshing and sessionable beer."
""
"I was pleasently surprised by this. I had low expectations. If you're looking for something light and refreshing, this will fit the bill. Slight hop bite against a malty base. No off flavors. Not bad"

"Overall (3.54) : The strongest suit of this beer is its appearance when poured. The head is still standing straight up on top and adds to the creaminess of the beer. Straight from the bottle it tastes metallic, from a glass it's a nice balance. I would drink this again if it were given to me (again)."

"This beer just completely missed the mark. I suppose if they called it a hoppy, American pale lager it would make some sense. But even then it would not be good."
""
"Overall, a decent beer, slightly out of style and harsh on the finer edges of this style."
""
""
"Not terrible. But I agree it's a very macro feel. On the other hand, it's a very light, crisp lager, and I'm wondering if I'm not just biased to the style because it reminds me of so many American ""light beers"". Underwhelming, to be sure, but it's not a terrible tasting beer. If you're in the mood for something very light, this will fit the bill, but it's not going to turn heads."

"Ok beer. A very macro beer feel. Not much hop flavor. Not that complex. Works well with pizza since it doesn’t take away from the flavor of the food. Probably won’t buy again unless I’m in some backwoods Wisconsin bar that only carrys Leinies as their craft beer (happens often)."

"Overall - I like this beer actually, a great lawn-mower beer, and one that I could enjoy all afternoon in a backyard bbq. Much better than the macros imho. Is there better, sure - but this is a decent dry lager with a touch of hops, cheap, and sessionable at 5.5%."

"Hoppin' Helles is probably the most disappointing Leinenkugel effort I've experienced thus far. It bears that same sort of grassiness that I didn't like about Guinness's Harp Lager and that same kind of bitterness I find prevalent in many domestic beers. Not to mention, I always categorized Leinenkugel for its flavors, be them lemon, orange, lemon berry, or simply just refreshing and rather intoxicating hops, but Hoppin' Helles overdoes it to the point where the flavor is more of a nuisance than a presence. Definitely the weakest of Leinenkugel's otherwise surprisingly good line of beers."
""
"It's moderately crisp in a light-medium body, appropriate and not thin. It's pretty smooth without losing the bite."

"Presentation: Packaged in a standard twelve-ounce brown glass long-neck bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a Samuel Adams Boston Lager Sensory glass."
""
"Overall - More than I was expecting from Leine's. While not the best of style, appears to be a reasonable attempt."
""
""
""
"Overall: Objectively the best of three Leinie's I tried, but looses points for not being to style. This wouldn't be half bad with a pinch more improvement. Close but no cigar."

"This beer was a golden orange color with a pretty lousy thin head. The head became nonexistent after a few minutes which made the appearance poor. You could definitely smell the hops in the beginning. My first sip was nice and hoppy, what i expected, but the more I drank the less impact the taste had on me. It has that nice citrus like bitterness that you expect from an IPA but it was over powering. This would a great IPA style to have with meals because it wouldn't over power the taste of your food. Overall, nice beer. I enjoyed drinking it, but honestly I don't see myself making a run to buy it specifically anytime soon. If i was a friends and this was an option I would highly consider it though."

"O: I get the concept. Make a hoppy helles that might appeal more to the lupulin-addled American market. It works for Jack's Abby, right? It's not a terrible beer, just a little overblown in all respects. The hop acidity takes a slightly unpleasant turn particularly on the nose, and drinkability suffers a bit because of its size. A more subtle approach may actually have been better here. I actually have to respect Leinenkugel's (Miller) for trying something like this and not just laying down and becoming ""that shandy brewery"". However, what's really crazy is that I bought this from a 25 case close out stack . . . 3 weeks after the bottled on date. So I guess nobody really committed to it. Respect rescinded."

"Just because I arrived late to an impromptu game night doesn't mean I can't enjoy a new beer or two, right? This one pours a clear sunrise brass topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises light white bread, very light hard water, mild grass, and a touch of pine needle. The taste brings in more of the same, the now-flowery hops barely standing out against a bland, slightly-bready backdrop. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, an okay ""hoppy helles"" at best, something that just kinda sits on my tongue without doing anything but wetting it. It's not bad, just not good...or anything, really. I nothing this beer..."
""
""
"I poured this into a glass, it has a gold color with a small fizzy head. The aroma has a slight hop aroma to it. The taste is of slight hint of pine from the hops and a deep lager flavor to it. The mouthfeel is ok and leaves after taste on the tomgie. Overall a ok beer."

"I think everyone is being too generous here. A 74? Not even close. This tastes like a macro-lager, not an IPA. Where are the hops?! I taste none... If it is 90 degrees out, this beer would work. Any other time though, not at all. Quite possible the worst IPA I have ever had. Another doozy from Jacob Leinenkugel."

"A decent Helles, especially if you're not a huge fan of dark, heavy beer."
""
"Decent beer on its own with a few rough patches. With its level of hops, it could be confused as a pilsner. Nonetheless, Hofbrau and the rest of Munich have little to fear here."

"O - Very refreshing and invigorating! Leinenkugel's has definitely put forth a very refreshing and drinkable spring beer. I can literally taste spring. It's nothing that I would write home about, but it is definitely a beer I'll drink again whenever I have a chance to!"

"I'm a fan of Leinenkugel but not very fond of this beer. It's not terrible and it's very easy to drink but with so many good hoppy beers out there this just won't do. It really reminds me of a soured Miller Lite? On a hot summer day after mowing the grass I could slam a few of these but that's about all. I won't be buying again."

"Leinenkugel's Hoppin' Helles ---3.5/5"
""
"Overall a decent helles lager. Not all that authentic however."
""
"Overall, I would recommend it to those who prefer hoppy beers. I do not mind hoppy beers, but I did not find this taste particularly enjoyable for me."
"NOTES: Pleasant beer. Probably one of Leinenkugel's best. Clearly made to market to the ""hop"" niche - ""Hoppin' Helles"". Surprisingly hoppy in both the aroma and flavor though. Bright with resinous, citrusy, and grassy hops in the nose. Crystal clear deep gold body beneath a two-fingered head of rocky white froth that holds really well. Eventually over time, about a half a glass in, it completely settles but maintains an almost full surface coating. Good to very-good lacing. Medium-light body with a gently crisp carbonation. The flavor is balanced, displaying the hops foremost, but backing it with a solid amount of malt. Balancing, very firm bitterness. It finishes dry with some added herbal character. ""Helles"" is certainly not the style designation for this beer (resinous and citrusy hops and ""helles"" just don't go together), it's more of a pils, or even a pale ale - regardless of whether it's lagered or not. Regardless, it's well-done, and drinkable. If the malt were of a better quality this could be a great beer, but as it stands it seems to be simply lack-luster American 6-row. Shame."
""
""
""
"Overall not a bad beer. Love that Leinenkugels is bringing some new beers to the party. I probably wouldn't seek this one out, but I also wouldn't turn one down. My suggestion is give it a try, you might be pleasantly surprised."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- it was alright."
""
""
"Not much of a helles. Not that hoppin' either. Easy enough to drink though. Just bland."
""
""
"O: Matched really well with some spicy sausages - easy to drink, crisp, and refreshing. Alcohol is very well hidden."
"You know what? This is surprisingly good. I know it's easy to hate on Leinie's, but having this one and their Kölsch, it seems that when they want to, they CAN make quite a solid brew. If I were picking up a 6 or 12 pack, and the craft pickings were slim, I could get this and easily feel happy about that."
""
""

""
""
"The mouth is decent and it is an easy beer to pair with stuff like wings and chili. For what it is worth, I brought a case of this a football party on New Year’s Day and it was all drank. Some of the folks there were beer people, so I would say the hit the drinkability & approachability goals!"
"Overall: A nice, sessionable, and clean helles lager. Nothing over the top, but still a beer I could put away several of."

"Pours out to a nice golden color, brilliantly clear and a decent head with moderate lacing. Aroma is definitely hoppier than a true helles, with cat pee, pine, mint, dill and citrus and other American aromas. Flavor is a nice crisp lager that is overpowered by the trendy hop mania. Mouthfeel is good. Overall, this is offending me as I would like a good helles, not a jacked up trendy brew."

"Bought a case of this on off the sale rack for 15 bucks. Had been wanting to try it but never got around to it until I saw an offer I could not refuse so I rolled the dice. Overall I give leiny credit on this one. It is a helles lager, biscuityalty malty sweet goodness with a overdose of hops for the style...FOR THE STYLE.. Do not expect an dipa, ipa, apa... Or any kind of...a. But it is a good departure for those who like malty beers but let curiosity get the best of them and buy a beer with hop in the name. Maybe this will be my gateway to hoppier beers?"

"O - I don't know what to say. I know this was not intended to be a true to style helles lager. It wasn't IPA hoppy but definitely hoppier than your standard German brewed Helles lager. With that said, I did enjoy this one as it had some nice American hop characteristics. Style guidelines are definitely disappearing in the US. Not sure what to think of that. Read BA magazine issues 81 & 82. The Bros touch on this topic..."
"I do not know how to precisely quantify this, but upon removing the cap, it smelled like beer! My excitedly aggro pour created two fingers of puffy, bone white head that resembled to top of a vanilla ice cream cone. The nose was both grassy from the hops and biscuity from the malt and it put me in mind of some of my earliest beer drinking. Color was a gorgeous golden-yellow (SRM = 4) with NE-quality clarity. The unholy trio of Mammon, King Midas and Croesus were suddenly in front of me, clamoring for a sip, but that privilege was mine, all mine! Mouthfeel was soft and it makes me wonder about their water in Wisco. Their beers all have that same softness, which I really like. It makes for great ""drinkability"" and I wish that they would put more of the Leinie line in CANs. The taste was grassy, minty, definitely hoppy, but not confrontationally hopped. This was more like maintenance drinking for this self-avowed hophead. Finish was semi-dry and very satisfying. What a great recent find in one of my local bottle shops!"
""
"Malts and hops can generously be described as light. It is clean at least...just not a whole lot there. The hop blend seems like it would be pretty decent if you used more...a lot more. Meh, certainly wouldn't go looking for, but I won't have much problem finishing the 3 bottles in the pack."
""
""
""
"To the nose I only picked up some malt, but it certainly isn't unpleasant but rather unfulfilling. The mouth-feel is...oaky... but as I said, if you're looking for a ""hoppy"" PA or IPA it will be disappointing. The only thing that saves this beer from an F is in-fact that it is claimed to be a ""lager"". If you judge this beer as and American Adjunct Lager", then it is quite good. However, Leinenkugal claims this brew to be of hoppy origin, hence the name which is a mistake. The mouth feel is fine and I don't mean FINE. It is what it is. If I could rate this as an American Adjunct, well then this would get some really nice marks, however Leinenkugal is claiming a hoppy complex ""specialty"" and this beer is far from. If it's cheap enough and you need some relief, this is a good sessional brew...PLEASE DO NOT OVERPAY"

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours translucent golden with a small white head. Smells of sweet syrup with slight earthiness. Tastes of spice with a little bit of earthy hops. Beer is carbonated heavily with light body goes down great. Overall an above average beer."
"O - I tend to favor a lot of Leinenkugels stuff but wasn't overly impressed with this one. Kind of a weak, flavorless version of a good style of beer."
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, not to filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it’s a decent beer to pound down for a while."
"Low C-"
""
""
""
" The taste is sort of sweet but perhaps lightly buttery as if it has some diacetyl in there but not really corny it does have a slight tinge of hops in the flavor but a little overboard in the marketing considering I would expect hop flavor to dominate given the name. The taste fizzles when it increases in temp leaving more of a sweetish flavor lingering. Overall I would not buy this again...probably not buy any Leinenkugel beer for that matter since I did not like the last two I purchased and was kind of on the fence before that."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- It is what it says it is, a hopped up helles, It's certainly not bad, and is an easy drinking beer, but nothing more"
""
""
"Poured out of the bottle, it looks like any nondescript American brew - yellow gold. The mouth-feel and finish is the high point of this beverage; with its above average thickness and a crisp but lingering finish. There is nothing special about the aroma: A blend of malt that confronts their attempt at making this particular helles heavier than usual on the hops. The overall taste is a slightly (and properly) bitter beer. I'm not sure what the brewery is really attempting here - it comes off as an intriguing experiment with the style tweak, but results in a pretty average experience for the consumer ( similar to mixing Orange Crush soda with Sunkist - oh...it sounds so bold, but at the end of the day it's still orange soda). Let me be clear - I enjoy most of the beers that Leinenkugels offers (Red, Oktoberfest, the Shandy series, et al), but this one is sub-par by comparison. The Hoppin Helles is a good afternoon beer, but when you consider that you can get similar tasting run of the mill domestics (such as Michelob ) for less money, I don't know why you would opt for this more expensive one."

"This pours a clear, yellow straw color with a slight, white head. The aroma is very grass and grain like. The texture is thin but there is a decent punch in the taste. There is a lot of grain and straw that gives it a very earthy taste. Fairly well made for a Leinenkugel’s product."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not a bad beer at all. Really easy drink with a nice amount of hop bite. Its better then any bud or coors but still, its lacking the overall balance and flavor to become a great beer. Would be a nice summer beer or something to start a rookie out on."
"O. I don't know where to go with this. It wasn't bad. If say, it were a summer ale or kolsch, no prob. But they call it ""Hoppin"". There is no hint of hops anywhere. Whatever. If you want a smooth easy drinker; this is all right."

"Overall: an Americanized Helles that addes more citrus tones but seems less integrated and refined than a good German Helles."

"Overall, really a fresh tasting beer. Lots of pine notes. Probably one of Leinenkugel's better brews."

"Overall nothing I would seek out again and has more taste and body than most of the beers they put out. Still its a one note beer that would get passed over."

"They're trying, I get it, and I love the concept. I don't pick up on the ""hop forward"" claim on the label, as this is an ok helles lager that has a slight waft of hops more than a standard beer in the style. I appreciate the 12'er gift I got from my neighbor, and there isn't much to complain about with this beer, it's just kind of...average. I had high hopes that Leinie's was going to try to get away from their usual modus operandi, but this beer isn't it."

"Excited to see a light helles with more hops, but I understand it's brewed by Miller ultimately price per six a bit high 9.49 but it was on sale for 7.99. Pours light fizzy yellow but the difference here is the head along with some actual head retention, fine speckled lacing left behind. Aroma has a light citric hop nose with some cereal grains that can't rule out vegetal components of corn/rice. Pretty light on the nose let's see how it's tasting. Generic hop bitterness the label says 5 varieties but I truly can't hone in on one. Grassy herbal are some words with a hint of citrus but it's dumbed down, they are going for a light noble pils style. I can definitely tell you there are some noble hops in this brew. I'm all over it, as far as drinkability and accessibility goes. Mouthfeel is light as in helles light, a bit of fizzy un natural carbonation reminds you that your drinking a macro. Nothing to fault here hoppier than the norm easy to drink I could enjoy this watching a ball game. Not offensive at all, but at the same time there's many better lagers this will be reliable during this season."

"Overall – An easy drinker. Nothing exceptional, but nothing off putting either. Overall alright."

"O -- This beer is very refreshing and drinkable... for an APA. As a Munich style Helles, the resiny American hops dominate too much to style. It's almost as if Leinie's is back-tracking on the IPL to a plain ol' PL/APA hybrid. I had no trouble drinking the sixpack I bought, but I was not expecting a Munich Helles after the first taste."
"Taste-Pilsner malt, cracker,crisp, subtle earthy, herbal hops. light-to-medium bodied, faint hop bitterness in the finish. Refreshing and quaffable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Not by any means a bad beer, but not by any means what the marketing claims. A decent American lager, but doesn't live up to the billing. I think Leinie's tried to cash in on the hops craze but wound up disappointing here."
""
""
""
"I think everyone who's tasted this would dispute that it's a Helles, but it's among the most decent of Leine's non-Big-Eddy offerings, so I feel compelled to rate it above their usual swill. I would pick it over about 10 of Leinie's other offering, but it's ridiculous to call it a Helles."
"I've been a fan of Leinie's forever. I do stay away from its flavored beers (with the exception of the Summer Shandy, which is good enough to swill), since I rarely like any brewery's flavored beers, and I especially like the original and the Sunset Wheat. But the Hoppin' Helles was pretty terrible. Maybe I had a bad six-pack, but the beer managed to blend together everything I dislike in palish beers. The Hoppin' Helles, first of all, has very little hops to it, but it somehow managed to capture the bitterness of hops but minus the tang that I like. To my tongue, it has a skunkiness of a Kolsch-style lager but without the complexity. And finally, it's rather bland like an American-style lager but somehow lacks the crispness and lightness that makes American lagers so drinkable. I forced the six-pack down and won't buy it again."
""
"so this new concoction is an american interpretation of a german style using all american ingredients...or at least hops. it misses the mark on most counts, but still brings some attitude. a typical leinies brew....but yet a bit more....i really can't recommend it , but yet i can't say i wouldn't ever drink this again."
""
"O - It's not that it is bad, but in true Leine's fashion it is boring and lacking any real aroma or flavor. Picked it up because I was intrigued by the style I have yet to have. I'll find a better example."
""
""
"If I were given the choice of this or a regular Leinies, I'd go with this. If I were give a choice between this and several other maibocks, including the New Belgium Hoppy Bock and many other Wisconsin Maibocks, inlcuding Point's , Capitol, and New Glarus, I would not be choosing the Leinie's."

"From a ""Leinenkugel's Autumn Variety 12-pack"" that I bought back on 8/1/13 when they just put them on the shelf 10 minutes before I came in. Sampled 8/22/13 in a pilsner glass and chilled to 36 degrees in my beer cooler. They didn't list have the alcohol content on the bottle or on the package. I am guessing around 5%. Pours a golden yellow in color with close to a 2-finger white head that doesn't last too long. Not much lacing is seen. The aroma is just some sweet malts. That's about it. The taste was pretty much the same with some hops. I thought it would be much more 'hoppy' that it was. Overall it was ok."
"Scores are for the category not as a beer. It's not horrible or anything but when put in the Helles Lager category...sorry it does not measure close to average."

"Overall I wasn't a fan of this beer and I thought that it was very average example of the style, the hop profile was pretty much spot on for the style and it wasn't overpowering, but the super sweet malts really hurt this beer in the long run. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was fairly smooth and not filling, the flavors kind of held my attention, but the sweetness was just way too high and that would prevent me from having more than one. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both pretty nice. What I liked the least about this beer was the high amount of sweetness, this was the sweetest Helles Lager I have ever had and it just seemed out of place for the the style. I wouldn't buy this beer again on it's own and I don't think I'll be getting another one of Leinenkugels summer variety pack, the beer was a little off for the style and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. All in all this beer was a let down, I didn't have the highest hopes going into this beer, I thought it would be solid. but the high amount of sweetness really prevented from being as good as it could be. Better luck next time guys. So far this is one of my least favorite Helles Lager."
