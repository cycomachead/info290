4.1,12.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours hazy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger fluffy bright white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, grass, orange, cracker, bready grain, floral, pepper, and herbal hops. Damn nice aromas with good strength and balance of hop/malt notes. Taste of lemon, pear, pepper, orange zest, apple, cracker, bready grain, grass, floral, and herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of citrus, light fruit, pepper, cracker, bready grain, grass, floral, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice flavor balance with good complexity; very hoppy but still has nice malt balance; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent helles lager! Great flavor balance with good complexity; extremely smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering as expected.","superspak","Jan 21, 2013"

It pours a clear straw topped by a finger of sturdy white foam. The nose comprises green apple skin, honey, and light pineapple. I honestly didn't see that much fruit coming... The taste holds notes of sourdough, orange rind, lemon zest, honey, and bitter greens. The body straddles the border between heavy light and light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a creamy feel. Overall, a nice brew, but one that doesn't really excite me too much.

3.43,-6,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall -- Slightly better than average for the style, but I'm just not thrilled. Where's the interesting FFF slant on the classic style? Easily my least favorite FFF seasonal, not because it is a lager, but because it is so uninspired.","yeahnatenelson","Jul 26, 2011"
4.08,11.8,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"O: I find Gorch Fock to be a pleasant, sessionable beer that, while not typical of style, falls well within its parameters. A really well-made lager that I highly recommend. ","Wadsey","Jul 26, 2011"
4.12,12.9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"O: A spirited attempt at a non-traditional style; the results of which I thoroughly enjoyed. While it might not take the prize from Weihenstephaner (which I wasn’t expecting in the least), it definitely gives the Midwest an excellent example of this often overlooked European style. And if you can produce a good Helles, it says loads about your brewery, in my opinion. Just another reason why the boys in Munster should be proud.","BarryMFBurton","Jul 23, 2011"

The first drink was slighty disappointing, seemingly just another import lager.

Nice scent, a very clean and malty aroma, although it is a very weak scent. Excellent taste, very clean and refreshing, very malty with just a little hint of peppery spiciness. Nice feel, quite smooth, with just a little roughness from the overcarbonation. A good beer, a nice Helles, but not 3F's best.","JamesS","Jul 07, 2008"
3.85,5.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall a tasty and easy drinking lager. The sweetness was a bit annoying, but not too overpowering.","plaid75","Jul 06, 2008"
4.34,18.9,3,4,4.5,4,5,"I've had the pleasure of drinking many helles lagers in Munich so I was hoping that 3F would keep to the style with this. In my opinion they did an excellent job of not getting all hoppy on it, this was a very good helles lager.","TurdFurgison","Jun 26, 2008"
3.43,-6,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a somewhat foggy light golden hue with a one finger white head that quickly dies down to a whispy layer of foam. Lots of bubbles racing to the top of the glass with virtually no lacing left on the sides. Smell begins with faint grains, lemon, and honey. You really have to dig your nose deep just to get these aromas, so unfortunately this is about it. Taste starts off with a buttery biscuit like malt with a hint of lemon. Toasted grains some noble hops midway on the tongue. Aftertaste is moist with honey, fresh cut grass, a pinch of pepper. Light, smooth, and creamy in the mouth with a steady but subtle carbonation. Not a bad beer, but nothing I'd seek out again.","BeerTruth","Jun 04, 2008"

3.78,3.6,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a crystal clear light golden color with a smallish white head that leaves quickly. Aroma is mild malts some spicy and floral hops and a little diacetyl in there too. Taste is sweet and bready malts. Body is medium with a sharp carbonation tickle on the tongue. Not a bad brew, not my favorite as I think its a bit sweet.","johnnnniee","Feb 29, 2008"

3.2,-12.3,3,3,3.5,3,3,"Bottle courtesy of iconoklaztor: Poured a clear golden yellow color lager with a medium foamy head with limited retention and no lacing. Aroma of sweet lightly floral malt with limited hops presence which I the biggest surprise coming from a brewery renowned for hopping every beer to the maximum level. Taste is also dominated by some sweet and lightly floral notes with a minimal amount of crisp hops at the end. Full body with average carbonation. Good take on the style form a brewery not usually known for sticking to style.","Phyl21ca","Feb 07, 2008"

3.52,-3.6,2.5,3,3.5,4.5,4,"D - I must say, I'm surprised that FFF pulled in the reins so hard on one of their beers to keep in in-style at under 5% ABV instead of pushing the envelope like they normally do. This is highly drinkable and very well balanced.","EPseja","Dec 30, 2007"
4.3,17.8,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,"The mouthfeel is very crisp and light in body. The flavors meld wonderfully over the palate. Subtlety is a beautiful thing. I could drink this beer all day. This 22oz. bottle will go down within the next 5 minutes, I reckon.","neonbrown82","Dec 22, 2007"
3.55,-2.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"A light golden to straw color, with a small white head forming, but it quickly dissolve away. There is strong visibility of carbonation. A slight grassy scent at first, followed by a strong bready, cracked grain aroma. That bready fragrance, is strong at the first taste. It quickly blends itself with mild bitterness of citrus and grassy flavors. A watery feel at first, carbonation does become prevalent halfway across the palate. It has the classic feel of a very good lager crisp, with a dry finish. A surprise from FFF, this beer sticks to the style very well, though a little thinner of a feel than expected. It is still a very good beer, would be good some steamed seafood.","cameraman","Dec 09, 2007"

3.92,7.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Taste is strong of pine, grass, pilsner funk. No noticable alcohol, no surprise at 4.5%. Feels a little thin but leaves a nice hoppy aftertaste that sticks around a while. Lagers aren't my choice of beer but this one seems pretty well done.","kirok1999","Oct 15, 2007"
4.1,12.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"D- Keeping the style in mind this is a really good beer. I wouldn't usually buy this beer but for a time where it calls for a nice lager this would be the one I would seek out. Probably the best lighter lager I have had so IMO Three Floyds are staying strong with another good offering for a great session beer.","BlindPig","Oct 10, 2007"
2.86,-21.6,3,2,3,2,4,"Overall: Three Floyd's is in my opinion the best brewery in the US and possibly the world. This beer, sadly, let me down. Thank god I have a Dark Lord to get my hopes back up! I would say try it for the experience but don't get your hopes up!","iconoklaztor","Oct 05, 2007"
3.95,8.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Gorch Fock is one of the best Munich helles lagers that I've ever had. It proves the point (that didn't need proving) that Three Floyds is anything but a 'dump in a massive amount of hops and see what happens' kind of brewery. These guys are craftsmen, dammit. Forgetting the German origins of this beer for a moment, they're also one of the best brewers of 'American style' beer on the planet. Maybe *the* best.","BuckeyeNation","Sep 30, 2007"
3.95,8.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"What a change of pace for Three Floyds here. I really like this one, but as other reviewers point out it's a bit pricy. Very accessible and highly sessionable if the price wasn't so steep.","merlin48","Sep 30, 2007"
3.35,-8.2,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"i was very surprised at how mediocre this was considering i worship 3Fs. it's probably the first of their offerings that didn't blow me away or was at least an interesting and tasty interpretion of a beer style. i could sum this up quickly by saying that it's a standard helles lager, but i'll go on...this poured a pale gold with a chill haze and a minimal white head that diminished very quickly. some nice bready malt aromas and maybe a hint of grassy hops in the nose. some sweet malts balanced out by the underlying hops and carbonation. mouthfeel is fine. drinkable at this abv. i'm wondering why they bottled such a run of the mill beer when i've had much better offerings at the pub...admiral lord nelson, for example. also, this is way overpriced at $7 a bomber. you could get a sixer of spaten for that, which is not much different and a bit better.","MrMcGibblets","Sep 11, 2007"

3.96,8.5,2.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Slightly lacking in vitality although the thickness seems about right. The taste is excellent however and my recent fling with German beer leaves me finding this a very welcome interpretation of the style. Think Gumballhead goes to Bavaria.","malcontent","Aug 27, 2007"

3.4,-6.8,3,3,3.5,3,4,"On tap at Three Floyds Brewpub, and served in a pint glass. This beer poured a clear, golden color with a small, beige head. The aroma was made up of bread, very light pine, and some lemony citrus notes. The flavor was also very mild and included light bready yeast and citrus. The mouthfeel was light and had a small dose of carbonation. A solid representation of the style. Worth a try.","mdm46410","Oct 14, 2005"
3.37,-7.7,3,3.5,3,3.5,4,"Poured a hazy yellow, with a nice white head on top. Smell was of faint floral, spice and a little yeast. Taste was crisp, dry and of spicy hop. Very drinkable, I had no problem sitting back with this one while waiting for food, it was rather "light" compared to most of the other offerings by 3 Floyds, and for that I enjoyed it, sessionable I'd say.","HoboAGoGo","May 02, 2005"
