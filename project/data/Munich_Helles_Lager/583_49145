But it's not as big and bready with melanoidin character that I remember from fresh Munich Helles and the graininess is not at all to character.  Nevertheless, I won't hesitate to pick up some of this when the mood strikes.","steveh","Mar 07, 2015"

The aroma is of malts with a hint of lemon zest. Pretty much the same for the taste with a slight sweetness in the mix as well. No bitter or harsh aftertaste and goes down easy. One of the BETTER 'summer lagers'. Medium bodied with higher carbonation. Overall a good refreshing seasonal brew.","BeerWithMike","Sep 21, 2014"

The nose is bready and doughy with a cracker style malt but flashes of lemon, honey and molasses come through.

The brew smells like bready malt, grassy hops and light citrusy (lemon peel) hops. It tastes mostly like grainy/bready malt and some light grassy hops. It's light, crisp and refreshing with good carbonation. This would be really good on a hot summer day (as opposed to a rainy, mid 40 degree day like today is here).

3.49,0.3,3,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,"a nice twist on the standard summer beers out there, this is an extremely light lager, but it is more than that. pours a profoundly clear thin yellow color, schockingly light, but with a refreshing and excited head. nose is german malts all the way, with a hint of summer aromatics, cut grass, and dandellions. the flavor is way bigger than the appearance, and the munich malts are center stage. light body means high drinkability, but in a helles i need more body, too thin even for a summer brew. a not boring summer beer though. round it out with a bit more body next year and itd be a real winner.","StonedTrippin","Aug 26, 2011"

3.07,-11.8,2.5,3,3,4,3,"Poured this Helles Lager from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This Helles poured a golden hazy straw color. It produced a average white head, it has poor retention and there was a average amount of lacing left on the glass. The aroma consists of a slight hint of grain, and hints of citrus hops. The taste of the Helles Lager is light in body, some mildly toasted malted grain, slightly sour citrus hops in the finish. Overall the beer is very smooth, drinkable. Excellent session beer/lawn mower beer. Good intro into craft beer.","GossageBrewery","Aug 11, 2011"

Aroma is fairly strong, malty and a little fruity, typical but still acceptable. Flavor is rather well-rounded, better than most lagers I have tried, malty with a firm undertone of apple and pear. Texture is smooth, a little thick, just a bit fizzy. All in all, fair to middlin' and worth at least a try.","Cyberkedi","Jul 18, 2011"

The initial taste is crisp, light, and unimposing. The malts give a toasted grain and slightly grassy – maybe lemony – taste throughout the drink. This is then followed by a light hop snap just before a very dry swallow. Schlafly cans this beer for a reason: it’s the quintessential summertime beer.","jmvecchio1","Beers"

Not a huge smelling beer but pleasant. Taste is crisp and refreshing with somewhat of a hop finish. In between there are floral notes as well as breads. Mouthfeel is crispy and light bodied.

4.6,32.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Got a keg of this one on at home and it is not lasting long. The beer pours a light straw color. There is absolutely no haze in this one. A finger of white head falls to a brief cover over the brew, leaving a decent amount of sticky lace as it falls. This one fits right with what I expect for the style. The nose has some sweat fermenting dough qualities to it, with a light and crisp noble hop playing behind it. Things are pretty mellow in the aroma. The flavor brings more prevalence to the herbal noble hop sitting over the slightly sweet bready quality of the malt. It finishes with a crisp bitterness that hangs on beyond the final swallow of the beer. The mouthfeel is on the lighter end of moderate but with a moderate carbonation of very fine bubbles that really makes it feel light. The drinkability of this beer is second to none. At 4.5%, it is a true session beer. All aspects of the brew are mellow, but not boring at all. This is a style that needs to be made by more breweries. I might be putting in an order for another 50L of this one sooner than later.","kmpitz2","May 27, 2010"

4.02,15.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"What a flavorful Helles. Actually, it's bold enough with the floral hops that it actually brings out a fair amount of nectar-like fruitiness. Edges closely to a super clean Blonde Ale. The hop flavor (Saaz?) makes a remarkable impact in the nose and taste, then carries the beer deep into the clean finish. The hearty pilsner malts give a firm foundation for the hops and without interferring with the delicate and perfumy notes. Softly sweet and bready to create a nice light body and to bolster the carbonation to support a lot of creaminess upfront, and then dryness late. Definately a top choice for the lawnmower types. Only a slight graininess and vegital note both in the aroma and flavor keep this beer from very high scores.","BEERchitect","May 18, 2009"

The flavor reminded me of a delicate Maibock. More subtle, not as sweet. Something for a hot weather day (which it is in St. Louis).
