"Serving type: bottle"
"I really wanted to like the one, unfortunately it did not agree with my pallet.  The style  feels right, however the taste was not for me."

"Feel: Light and very easy to drink with good carbonation"

"Wasn't having high expectations since German lagers haven't hit my taste to well.  Bit this one is different.  It packs a lot of flavor in a low abv. and very good balance.  Well crafted for sure.  I'll grab some more of these, especially for daytime summer drinking."

"Overall: I was very impressed with this beer for how smooth it was. VERY drinkable. It tasted similar to boddingtons or john smiths, i enjoyed this a lot."
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Notes: Every time I try this style on draft at the brewery it is different. I have had better in the past from Penn Brewery."
""
"not one i'd buy outright but not terrible ."
"Overall -This one is nice and refreshing a great session style brew. One I will certainly get again."

"An infinitely sessionable and wonderfully nuanced lager, maybe the best offering from Penn in terms of session candidates. Pairs great with a wide range of foods but tastes good enough to drink on its own too. Excellent balance. Definitely a beer I will return to."
""
"O - A very well-done Helles with plenty of quality aromas and taste in a session beer. Well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Great lager, nice to drink a good lager every once in a while and this one is really nice."
""
"This is a very solid Helles Lager. The beer is crisp, dry, flavorful, and very easy drinking without being boring. Well done Pennsylvania Brewing Co. and thanks for representing my home state with the name of your wonderful brewery."
""
""
""
"This is what beer is supposed to be. A straight up no pretense beer. Damn good. Put this up there with Victory Lager in terms of a pure beer. Some of the best beers in the world come out of Pennsylvania."
""
""
"Pours a clean yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, a sweet malt and fresh lager notes. In the taste, a small sweet lager notes, quite fresh and a bit watery. A very small bite, but mainly smooth, and a light bodied mouthfeel, with a small and dry graininess in the aftertaste. Quite fresh, yet a bit sweet, nice, but just about average."
""
""
"Wow! this one way surpassed my expectations. When I first poured it I expected it to have a macro watery taste but I was truly blow away by the flavor of this beer. This beer is able to be extremely light across the palate and yet has a great flavor. Quite possibly the most drinkable beer I have ever had due to being overall light in body, full in flavor and low in alcohol percentage."

"VERY sessionable beer in one of my favorite styles. I’m lucky enough at the moment to live in Pittsburgh where Germanic and East European heritage has rubbed off on local breweries like the Pennsylvania Brewing Company and Church Brew Works: they both make nice German-style lagers. I hope to see more lagers from American craft companies."
""

""

"Overall one of the best I have ever encountered: good flavor, medium bodied, and sessionable. Would consider trying it again in the bottle to see if it's as good."

"M/D - Mouthfeel is very light and smooth but watery. Very drinkable in the same way all very light beers are drinkable. Would be a good substitute for a bmc."
"Not an absolute behemoth beer and not one to get all excited about by beer geeks, but truly a wonderful take on the helles style lager."
"D: Very easy drinking beer, well balanced low ABV, you could drink quite a few of these... but there is just not enough here for me to buy again and again. Good but not fantastic."
"D-The beer is balanced and has a good flavor reminiscent of the established german Munich Helles beers. Its lighter body and good balance of flavor makes is a very good session beer."
"Drinkable, and at 4 ABV, easy to pack away a few. A good brew, no complaints."
"Sweetness clings to the mouth early but the aggressive carbonation scrubs the malts and grains off of the tongue. The acidity helps with the crispness along with the carbonation. But that co2 and sulfur texture scratches a bit in the end."
"Drinkability was good. Penn Gold has a pleasing flavor and a very low ABV; you could drink these all day."
"Pours a very clear golden color with a thin white head. Slight hop spiced aroma blends with some maltiness and a touch of butter. It is a subtle nose but quite pleasant. Very drinkable beer with a crisp finish. Tastes include grain, malt and slight bitter hops to balance it out. Medium feel and moderate to light carb. It is simple yet good enough to want and sit down and have a few of."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer had a non-existing head and was a nice gold color. The beer had a bit of a fruity smell. The beer I think was old as it was a bit flat tasting. It had a slightly bitter finish. I was not impressed and will not buy again."
"Maybe the beer was old or a bad example. I plan to try again to give a fair shake."
"Overall, as a fan of the style I would prefer a bit more of everything as this seems to almost be a helles lager light."
"Pours an orange copper color with a slight head. The smell is a little faint, but has the presence of sweet malt and some sweet breads. The overall taste is a little weak as well. There is a grain and sweet malt backbone with some bread taste and a faint citrus hop. The mouthfeel is of moderate carbonation. Overall this is an average beer, you can drink one or two but no more."
"D - Well, really easy to get down, especially if I'm eating food with it, can drink these all day."
"Morey's Bottom Line: To give this beer a fair shake, I'll likely edit this review down the road after I've had the chance to explore the style a bit more. Good, but to me, it's not living up to it's reputation. I had Stoudt's Helles a few weeks ago, and I enjoyed it a bit more."
"Very much worth trying but not a ""run to the store immediately"" beer."
"N: A nice Helles Lager, but a bit too adjunct-like, all in all a good choice, but could use a little tweaking."
"Drinkability: I'm not exactly sure what I should be looking for with this style, but this was extremely easy to drink. I wish there was more flavor and a longer finish, but I could easily drink a few of these no problem."
"This is a very easy drinker, also quite refreshing. It would be easy to drink a bunch of these."
"T/M: This is an absolute thirst quencher. Clean, fresh, delicious, light bodied, with a nice carbonation to boot. Sweet on the front provided by the malts and a slight bitter back end with the hops. Again, nothing overpowering just a fine mix of two. A beer with just the purest flavors; it should put the macros out of business."
"I know like my words aren't doing this justice--but it was damn good. I think the subtleties were a bit past my depth honestly. I do know that despite my lack of appropriate words, this beer was really good and I'll be having more."
"A very refreshing lager. Smooth malts with a good amount of balancing hops. Really hit the spot on a warm spring afternoon."
"Very easy drinking beer, especially on a hot day like today."
"D - Could drink the whole 12-pack on a sunny day by the pool."
"Good authentic German style beer, with a fresh taste and no gimmicks. Nice golden color. Head was a little thin out of bottle; may have better head on draft. A relatively simple beer with no complex flavors. A great beer to pair with brats. Also a fine beer for a hot summers day."
"Something I could definitely see being a safe go-to beer if it were more available in my area. Great for parties or introducing macro beer drinkers to the craft world. Not a whole lot not to like about this beer. In the past, I've paired this beer with homemade buffalo wings and would definitely recommend it."
"D - keep 'em coming!"
"Drinkability is pretty huge. Tasty and mild enough that you could drink it all night. 2nd from Penn that I've had, after St Nicholaus brewer's reserve, and I conclude they are an excellent brewery."
"Pours a nice golden color, go figure it's a golden Lager. Nice luxurious head and plenty of body. 16oz chilled pint glass. Nice lacing. Mouthfeel is exceptional. I'm saying this cause I like it when a lager is impressive. Bitterness and maltiness are perfectly balanced. This is a real German style lager. Low alcohol makes it easy to drink a few and taste makes it totally possible as well. Think this is worth a brewery visit."
"D - Very drinkable beer. The flavor is nicely balanced and not too powerful, and the ABV makes this a great all night drinker. Penn definitely knows their lagers."
"Drinkability: What is it with Pennsylvania Brewing and their note-perfect German-style beers? I loved Penn Weizen and I like this quite a bit. Wonder if they brew a dopplebock...."
"Penn Gold is a solid pale lager that is probably ubiquitous within 50 miles of the brewery. Western Pennsylvanians probably drink a lot of this stuff. In the final reckoning, twelve ounces was just enough to convince me that the flavor score deserves an increase. Bottom line: no frills, just good beer."
"I has a very pale yellow color which is slightly cloudy. It has a large head. The aroma is very clean with a hint of bread and sweet malt. It starts with a nice biting carbonation. There is a lot of malt sweetness in it. Oddly, I'd say corn although I know they don't use corn in their brewing. I also get a bit of lemon and slight bread. The finish is clean with a little hops but definitely lots of sweetness. Very light and drinkable."
"Overall, Lagers are not my thing. But there are a few that are real good and this is one of them. If I were to session any beer, I would probably pick this."
"D - Excellent. A wonderfully flavorful, yet modest beer without any offensive characteristics. Penn Gold is definitely something I would purchase in quantity in the future."
"Will never buy again. But would like to taste it again to see if it was really skunked or not."
"This beer sure is drinkable, a great session beer. Balance of the bitterness from the hops and sweetness of the malt keeps it from becoming too boring. Crisp, smooth body with a dry finish makes you want to take another sip. Great lager."
"single from Whole Foods Raleigh"
"Not a carbon copy of the Munich originals, but possibly just as good in it's own way."
"Drinkability- This is a near five on drinkability. As a lawnmower beer, which it is, it has amazing ""poundability"" factor. Smooth and very drinkable. I would get this again and not put so much age on it next time."
"Pretty easy and drinkable. I guess a nice German lager session beer, but nothing exceptional to make me return to it."
"D: Another solid offering from Penn, definetly worth trying if you're nearby but not one to go out of your way for. Penn's definetly a solid brewery doing a good job providing affordable, classic style brews."
"Drinkability is through the roof. One of the most neutral but still flavorful session brews around. It never gets old and it goes well with pretty much anything food-wise. One of my favorite renditions of the style."
"Poured into a glass from the 12oz bottle. Lovely, medium lasting head over a pale amber body. Smells of hops and malt in balance, neither overpowers the other and the taste is the same although the hops bitterness seems to linger at the back of the palate way after the malt taste. There's a good body, a little creaminess, perhaps with some light carbonation and a slightly dry finish. This is a good beer with or without food. An excellent drinkin' brew."
"The hops give this grainy, malty taste some needed balance, with notes of spice and medium bitterness. The texture is light and juicy and presumably quite refreshing. Overall, this is genuine, quality German style drinking beer and I would pick up a sixer if I saw one."
"starting to get very hard to find in my area."
"Easy drinker, if they could up the aroma a bit it would be top notch!"
"Bottoms up!"
"Perhaps I am being overly critical of this beer as I have enjoyed the others I have reviewed from this brewery and expected the same with this one. This is a good beer, just not the quality I have come to expect from Penn brewing."
"D= very drinkable, would make a great on-tap session."
"D: An all-around great lager, very enjoyable in the spring and summer."
"Definitely a refreshing beer, all in all, and I could recommend it for sure. It's not really my style, though, so it may be a while before I purchase another one for myself."
"O - Maybe not my first pick, but I think this beer achieves the ""clean, bright"" flavor associated with the style."
"Drinkability: another eay quaffing brew from PBC. Flavor profile is mellow but pleasant."
"Mouthfeel is good. Good Helles lagers have a pillowy, soft mouthfeel and a little crispness. This one fits the bill. Drinkability is excellent. This is an ideal summertime session beer."
"Mouthfeel is sudsy and light, a bit thin. Overall a very refreshing brew, but not as tasty as I thought it'd be."
"Slightly cloudy appearance in a pint glass, with a very faint aroma and a very clean finish - a much better summer beer than a lot of what is out there and not so robust, so that you might be able to convince some of the light beer guzzlers to give it a try."
"I have a feeling this beer will see many springs and summers with me."
"Drinkability: A fine example of the style; goes down great on a hot day"
"Floral notes are present throughout this beer. Very easy to drink and I can imagine myself in the Biergartens that the back of the bottle speas of."
"Clear pale yellow under a pure white head. Lacing all the way down the glass. Clean pilsner malt sweetness in the aroma balanced with a mild noble hoppiness. Soft pale malt flavor with a touch of grassy hops. Light, clean, and simple. I could drink many on a toasty day in the sun...or any time I suppose."
"Final Thought: This was definitely a suspect/skunked bottle and the beer will be reviewed at a later time. I've had a case of this before and don't recall this backlash from the brew."
"This is a very tasty, drinkable brew. I don't often reach for a lager, but if I wanted a good one this would definitely hit the mark."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden straw color with no head formation whatsoever even with aggressive swirling (dirty glass?). In the nose I first get hints of Hallertau hops, a little bit of cooked corn, slight butter, but overall quite clean. On the palate, it's light pils malt all the way, with a nice grainy flavor finishing with a floral note from the hops. A medium low body without a strong carbonation level make this an easy quaffer. However, I'd have to say there isn't a strong enough supporting role for the hops to make this one I'd pick up again."
"This is a very drinkable lager. As the first I've had from this brewery, it's a good sign."
"Pours a slightly foggy straw gold. Nice crème head. Nose is uneventful. Can't seem to pull anything off of it. Flavor is pretty grain toned. Seems to be a steady and consistent with nice thick malt character to it. Feel is good on the liquid and the same on the carbonation. Overall very drinkable. Well made and goes down fairly easy, though the body is a bit thicker than the standard boring old lager. I can't say I would go for it again (not my style...), but it is definitely well made."
"I feel that this is a clean, well-balanced beer, but nothing spectacular. I would definately have another, as I find it quite drinkable. A consistent, ""go-to"" beer... but doesn't stand out. Take it for what it's worth."
"I'll say the aroma is delicate alright, it fades after a few minutes. At first its a beautiful citrus rind, herb, and farmhouse funk, but that fades to a creamy orange smell. The flavor is a bit bland, but still nice. It finishes with a smooth, pale grain taste, while the main taste has a typical lager tang with a semi-sweet apple, but the overall flavor is clean and almost pure, unlike the pale Euro lagers that are mass produced. There are better Munich lagers, but this is still a nice example."
"Overall, a very tasty Munich Lager. Smooth and crisp, yet flavorful. Highly drinkable. Recommended."
"Clear, straw gold with a bright white head composed of fine bubbles. The foam settled quickly, but left some lacing behind. Aromas of sweet malt were accompanied by a light fruity/spicy character and a hint of lemon. Delicate bitterness, balanced on the sweet side with ample malts and mild lemony hops. The finish went by very quickly. Light bodied with moderate carbonation. A little thin in the finish. Very easy drinking with some pleasant character. Solid."
"Penn Gold is balanced and refreshing. It's not extreme in any sense of the word. It's the type of beer that's not going to scare the bud drinker, but it's not gonna wow the hop-headed beer geek. It's a solid lager."
"D- Great. I could session and enjoy this all day. I will get this one again."
"I would have this again,very good for the summer and refreshing."
"Well this is OK but really I was expecting more. On the plus side though there isn't anything bad at all about this lager, it is just rather mild mannered and lacking in anything different or outstanding."
"of what an good lager should do"
"Its a bright bright gold with barely any head. Leaves little lacing. There is a slight hop aroma but not much at all. What it is, is rather spicy. There is a little bit of grainy flavor that is some what sweet. Very easy to drink. The mouth feel is rather bland. simple and rather slick. Overall its a nice beer. But nothing spectacular."
"Scent was little to none. There was a malt smell, but very light. Head formed and cleared quickly with small amount of carbonation and very little lace. Looked like a typical ""burp beer"" to me. The mouth was likewise, nothing to write about. Average. Hops were barely detectable, and wash was clean. Well, for flavor, I had to check that this wasn't a light beer. I let it marm a bit on my palette and found trace amounts of malt, slight alcohol, and they say this is a pure barley beverage, all I have to say is clean. I'll agree that the taste is as light and clean and refreshing, it would be a good hot weather beer. So, would I get this again? Not really. If it were on special or someone gave it to me I'd accept. Because it's so light, it's really easy to drink. Other than that, I want more flavor in my beers."
"I got this on tap at Tank's Taproom in Tampa, Fl. It poured very little head that had a nice slow retention. There was thin to no lacing. The color was a deep gold. The smell had an odd sweet aroma, something that I know I have smelled before, but I cannot place. The taste was the same as the smell but better blended. The mouthfeel was an excelent smooth feeling. All in all a fair drink. Don't drink and review."
"I am very surprised at how much I enjoyed this one, I am not crazy about this syle at all. Pours a rich golden color with a fizzy head, disapating to nothing, leaves no tracing. That is all that is well, average. The taste is great, light bodied with some toasty, buttery oatness with some true tettenang hops to balance out the sweet maltiness. A well balanced and heck, as good as any other of the syle I've tried."
"12oz. bottle poured a pale golden color with very little head and almost no lacing. Not much in the scent but some sweet malt and a slight hop aroma. Taste of sweet grain malt with just a bite of fresh hops. The mouth feel is light to medium not as watery as it looked. More of a hot summer beer than a fall/winter brew."
"Very good beer, slightly better IMO than the Pilsner."
"D: In the day of big bold imperial ales, this beer suffers from lack of alcohol and big bold hops. This beer gets back to fundamentals and nails them. The malts are biscuity and sweet and go down very smoothly."
"The drinkability is quite good, sessionable, a very fine well rounded example. Prosit MK"
"Poured with a nice white head,dissappeared quickly,a light golden color,very clear.Has a biscuity,slightly fruity aroma,not much hop aroma.Has a very clean taste,slightly fruity,just a qiuck little hop bite at the end.A refreshing beer, not a lot of flavor.A light bodied beer,very drinkable"
"Pours a clear golden yellow color with white fizzy head that quickly turns into a thin lacing. Clean nose that features sweet grainy malts and some spicey hops in the background. Taste is crisp, sweet grainy malt with a spicey hop finish. Overall, I was not entirely impressed with Penn Gold. It is a decent lager that really does not have anything that makes it stand out against the rest."
"Overall: A drinkable, straightforward brew that is as refreshing as it is quality. Good accompaniment to any light meal."
"Notes: Impressive. Tough to find a really good Munich helles lager but the bus can stop here. Was a joy to sit down to this as an after work relaxing beer on a hot summer day. Add this to your shopping if you can get it."
"Poured from the bottle a nice light gold, with a small and tight head that didn't stick around too long. Smell was average, fairly light, with malt dominating some mild hops. Malt again was the prevailing flavor on the tongue, and it was the carbonation that dominated the mouthfeel, which was light, very crisp, and again, carbonated. Beer was pretty drinkable, enjoyed a few back to back."
"Overall: Much cleaner than the previous bottle of Penn Pilsner which I sampled earlier. I noticed that this is brewed within the Reinheitsgebot, laudable. I enjoyed this one, rather quaffable too. A solid Münchener Helles."
"Very drinkable and contradicting it a harsh acidic lemon finish. Noticeable hops and light yellow with a decent head. hoppy like a pale ale. More bitter than sweet. Perhaps some corn in there. Medium mouthfeel. Refreshing buit reminds me of out-of-date ARizona lemon tea."
"(B'ham UK, while in Tampa FL May 2006)"
"Cheers!"
"A fine example of an all purpose beer suitable for any gathering."
"Poured a straw yellow color with a small head of foam that dissipated fast that very few rings around the glass. The best part of the appearance was that I saw all those carbonation bubbles rising to the top of the pilsner glass. The aroma was that of what smelled like sour malt or hops, but it you swirled it around a grainy smell emerges. The taste was very grainy with a slight hoppy aftertaste. It was too grainy for my taste buds. The mouthfeel was pretty much average, clean, crisp and with some carbonation. This made for a nice affordable lager and that's it. Nothing too special and although somewhat OK, this was the worst beer out of the variety pack. Not the best beer from Penn Brewery."
"Very easy to drink, but it reminds me of Budweiser a bit, which I don't really dig on. This isn't my favorite style but it was worth a try. Not a bad session beer though if you like the style."
"If Helles Lagers are your 'thing', this one is worth a try."
"Drinkability is ok considering this is not my favorite choice from Penn."
"I found that this beer was just ok. Penn Gold poured to a more hazy golden color rather than crystal clear. A nice white head full of carbonation with great lace down the side of my glass. Average taste but it didn't have the crispness that I found with other beers of this style. Good body with and ok finish."
"Drinkability: It was pretty good and refreshing. I had this beer during a Pirates game at PNC park. It was also a very good thing to find local micros there and helped me out to avoid BMC awful macros. Also, its price was about the same thing than the others brands sold on location. If I got the opportunity, I would drink it again."
"Penn Gold pours a slightly hazy golden color topped by a white foamy head which produces some light lacing. There are streams of bubbles coming from the bottom. The smell is sweet malt with hints of straw and just a whiff of lemon. The taste is really refreshing and clean. It is marked by a strong slightly sweet and bready malt character with a tinge of lemon. The aftertaste produces a light bitter feeling in the back of the mouth. Mouthfeel is light, refreshing, but possibly a bit more carbonated than I'd like. This is pretty good lager and is easy to drink and tastes better than any macro."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Enjoyed this beer on tap at their brewery. This poured a clean deep golden color. The aroma has a chalky maltiness about it. The taste is wonderfully clean and crisp. Soft malts and floral hops meld together flawlessly and finish with a slightly winey, lemony finish. Overall, a very nice, smooth and clean tasting beer."
"Drinkability: Fantastic. Would make a superb beer to have a few of."
"One of the best of the ""helles"" style I have had,pours a light golden color with a light to medium head,the aroma is crisp and lightly malty with a hint of grassines.Real nice taste here,crisp malt taste with some iron-like qualities and a hint of smokiness with a light grassy taste in the background.I could drink these all day real nice brew."
"Prosit!"
"Another fine offering from Penn. Definitely the sweetest of their regular offerings, the Gold is a great session beer, and one I know that I will have again."
"Snappy carbonation and medium-light body make for a pretty drinkable brew."
"-F"
"Appearance: Pours a clear golden straw color, with moderate carbonation. The head is dense, rocky, white in color and sticks around the glass. On the nose the aroma slightly sweet, grassy, grain, hallertau hops and fresh mowed hay. On the palate the flavor consists of slight malts sweetness, hints of green apple, graininess, slight bitterness, and slightly peppery. Very smooth mouthfeel. Very good drinkablility, refreshing Münchener Helles."
"This beer pours a brilliant amber color with a dense, snow white head. The head fills my pint glass and shows excellent retention. A moderate lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is sharp Hallertau hops with a touch of malt. The flavor is light and crisp, with a touch of malty sweetness followed by the nice earthy pepper note of the hallertau. The finish is very clean with just a touch of lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel is solid and a bit more robust than the flavor would lead you to believe. Beers with such a delicate and balanced taste are usually a bit thin, but this one stands up well. Drinkability is good, as this beer is enjoyable and easy going. The hops talk back just a bit more than you'd expect, which hurts drinkability a bit. Over all, a very good beer that surpasses most lighter lagers in taste and body. Another good example of an authentically styled German beer from Penn Brewing."
"As the name entails, it pours a crystal clear golden hue, with a nice full white head. Reading the description of this beer on the back makes it that more enticing. The hallertau hops have an almost biscuit like aroma, and the malt sweetness diffuses into my senses along with the hops. Very pleasant and mild aroma here. A crisp refreshing maltiness, along with a unique yeast flavor. The hops give the overall flavor a light rolling bitterness that blends perfectly with the rest of what's going on. Lighter body but it's perfect for this Munchner Helles style lager. Very drinkable, maybe too drinkable making this beer one great session beer."
"The Penn Gold poured a light tan color with an almost clear appearance. Lots of active carbonation bands rose quickly to the small, creamy head. Some lacing was noticed, but not too much. A nice fruity aroma greeted the nose, along with some sweet malt and a vague lemon scent. I was very impressed with the Gold's taste. Nice malt presence that's somewhat dominated by the Hallertau at first, but makes a recovery during the swallow. Towards the end, a strange but invigorating lemon-creamy taste made an appearance, followed some bitterness. Very nice interplay here...great taste! The lighter mouthfeel was also pleasing, and very appropriately smooth. Penn Gold has great session qualities...very drinkable, with a wonderful taste. My new favorite Helles!"
"Notes: Drinkable to say the least, three gold medals from the GABF (1990, 1993 & 1998) ... enough said. A great lunch time beer, goes well with rubens or roast-beef on dark rye."
