3.54,4.1,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and it's an above average example of the style, the malts were very bready and it had the signature spicy hops, but I think they were just a little light for the style. This beer had good drinkability, it was pretty smooth, clean, not filling, and the flavors did a decent job at holding my attention, I wouldn't have a problem drinking a few of these and it makes for a nice beer to enjoy on those hot summer afternoons. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel they were both pretty nice. What I liked the least about this beer was the balance, I feel like a little more spicy hops would help make this truer to style and balance out all those bready malts. I would order a pint or two of this at a bar, but I don't think I would get a six pack of it and I recommend to anyone who likes easy drinking Lagers. All in all I enjoyed this beer, it was a nice easy drinking lager, but Hofbräu Original is still my favorite of the style, i think it's more balanced than this beer and it does a better job at showcasing those spicy hop flavors. This made for a decent first impression for Rivertown and i'm interested in checking out more of their beers. Thanks a lot Adam.","StoutHunter","Aug 01, 2013"

Rivertown makes very solid attempts at traditional European styles, and the Helles is no exception... I'd rather have a pilsner, though. But a refreshing, malt-forward brew overall.","Groomsy","Jan 31, 2013"

3.84,12.9,4,3.75,4,3,4,"Overall: Really delicious Helles Lager. Slightly sweet with a underlying noble hop bitterness/spiciness. Very clean, crisp and refreshing beer, however with a bit too high carbonation for my taste. True German-Pils malts are prominently displayed.","santa216","Jan 21, 2013"

3.48,2.4,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"This is a pretty good helles. Unfortunately, the carbonation is so high that it really does interfere with the flavor delivery. What I do get is a nice grainy lager with a consistent flavor profile though. A bit metallic and tangy. But it's passable.","RblWthACoz","Sep 17, 2012"

3.58,5.3,3.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,"12 ounce bottle, single bottle bought for $1.59. Served in a pilsener glass, the beer pours a slightly hazy light gold color with about a half inch white head. The head retention is good, but there isn't much lacing left on the glass. The aroma is a little light overall, the brew smells like bready malt, sweet malt and a bit of grassy hops. It mostly tastes like grain/bready malt, along with some light grassy hops and lemon peel. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's nice and crisp with good carbonation. It's also easy to drink. I think it's a solid overall brew, it's nice and enjoyable to drink, and definitely worth trying.","bluejacket74","Jul 30, 2011"
3.55,4.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This one pours a very light and moderately clear faint gold in color with a light white lacing around the glass. When it first poured it even resembled a chardonnay. It eventually gained a light cloudiness. It smells of pilsner malt with a light sweet malty finish. It's moderately grainy. Upon my first whiff I even thought I got some ever so light white grape. Interesting and light. It drinks very clean and light and has moderate carbonation. Overall this one is okay, and I like when American breweries cover this style, but this one doesn't separate itself from the others.","aasher","Jul 29, 2011"
4,17.6,4,4,4,4,4,"A very pleasant Helles - crisp, bright malt body with a bit of toasted biscuit in the malt. A touch of grassyness with hints of lemon. Easygoing character makes for a good session candidate. I'd like to see this brewery get a bit wider distribution.","Brent","Jul 27, 2011"
3.85,13.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"What an excellent way to end a rather long work week during an especially hot summer. This is an ideal quaff - I finished this in no time and found myself reaching for another.","jkrich","May 04, 2011"
3.37,-0.9,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"On tap at Bodega in Columbus, $4.50 per pint. Clear pale golden color, about a cm of foam that sinks to a filmy layer. Bready aroma, neutral and a little grainy, very little impact from hops (appropriately). Nice flavor, nothing offputting at all. Just a solid and unassuming Helles Lager. Good carbonation and body, no real complaints with this beer.","TurdFurgison","Apr 14, 2011"
3.88,14.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Quality helles lager in true Bavarian fashion (as opposed to a mediocre American imitation). I'll be seeking more offerings from this small, local brewery...","Natural510","Nov 05, 2010"

3.36,-1.2,2,3.5,3.5,4,3,"It's sweet. Almost too sweet for my taste. I can't drink more than a couple of bottles of this lager. It seriously needs a hops infusion. It may be OK for some traditional Bavarian foods, such as a pretzel with mustard, but it's just too sweet for my taste. I'll probably not get it again.","Cannoneer","Sep 07, 2010"
4.25,25,4,4,4,4.5,5,"Just enough creamy mouthfeel to let you know it is there, but not enough to keep one from gulping if they want.
