3.64,-5.2,4,3.75,3.5,4,3.5,"Served in a willibecker at the lodge.  Pours a golden-orange hue with a slightly hazy clarity and a loose, bright white head.  Nose expresses light, fruity esters, a slightly grassy quality and a hint of sour mash.  Taste follows nose with the addition of a light biscuit malts, a hint of sweetness and a faint, lingering sour mash character towards the back.  Mouthfeel is light in body with a pleasant, even carbonation and a clean, mostly crisp finish.  Overall, a solid domestic Helles on par with those I've had in Germany; however, I'd like to see more of a clean finish.","Jwale73","Nov 05, 2014"

3.88,1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Taste is classic, full of quality malt, and mildly bitter. This is what the AAL's aspire to be....like a Bud made with care and quality ingredients. Crisply dry finish with vaguely lingering bitterness. A nice example of what is to me a none-too-interesting style. Not the hugest fan of this kind of beer but it's clearly done very well.","tobelerone","Jul 14, 2011"
4.56,18.8,4.5,3.5,5,4.5,5,"This is my second Trapp beer tasted and I continue to be overwhelmed. I told my daughter to bring as much of this home from Vermont as she could and she was kind enought to do so. This beer comes in a big flippy bottle. This is as rich and luscious a Helles as I've ever had, which is plenty. A nice hazy gold in the glass; the bottle-poured head fluffed right up. Decent lacing followed the beer down all the way. Wonder-full malts with just the right hop balance create a great, smooth taste. The sweetness is in there but just enough. The conditioning is light which adds to the silky mouthfeel. This is a great beer!","BeerIsland","Apr 30, 2011"
3.83,-0.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a deep golden color with a huge rich off white head that sticks around forever. Smells of grainy bready malts with rich melanoids mixed in. Earthy floral hops are more aggressive than I would have thought. Taste is sweet grainy toasty bready malts with hints of honey, burnt sugar and an earthy hop bitterness that threw me at first. Finish leaves a sweetness with an earthy hop bitterness. Medium body with crisp carbonation and a sweet almost sticky mouthfeel. Great Lager that I'm glad I tried on a whim.","johnnnniee","Dec 16, 2010"
3.7,-3.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"On tap. Pours a translucent straw color with a 1/2 inch of head. Good amount of lacing. Sweet toasted malt aroma. Very crisp and refreshing. Slightly buttery. Nice sweet malty flavor. Overall its nothing over the top but its a solid beer. Worth having again. Highly drinkable and very satisfying.","PicoPapa","Dec 15, 2010"
4.3,12,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured into a massive imperial pilsner glass, golden with a slight haze and a big foamy white head that has a decent retention. Smell is bready malts, sweet and somewhat sugary, some raw grains. Taste is sweet up front with a slightly bitter finish, sweet bread dough, pilsner malts, spicy hops. Medium bodied with a medium carbonation, clean finish. Helles is one of my favorite German styles and this does not disappoint. I think this is one of the best American takes on the style and I would gladly order this whenever I can. A very drinkable beer.","nkersten","Sep 13, 2010"

4.15,8.1,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Off tap at the brewery this beer was a perfectly clear, golden color with one finger of frothy white head. The retention of the cap was average but the collar did last quite a while and the lacing was scattered and streaky. The aroma was nice and dry, crystal malt, Vienna malt, lager yeast, grains and a slight boozy note. The flavors were very dry and clearly grainy (most the Vienna/Crystal again) with hints of toasted malt and a little mustiness as it warmed up. Much like a Pilsner I found it to be crisp and refreshing. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body medium/light and the carbonation perfect.","thekevlarkid","May 01, 2010"
