"Refreshing summer beer. Drinking it at Fat Daddy's Smokehouse on Maui.  Good beer in this setting.  Not enough of a standout to seek it out, but it's OK when the taplist is a little shy."
"Perfect session beer any time of year. It smooth with just a punch of flavor to keep things interesting."

"More like pilsner. Word word"

"Interesting and clean helles lager.  Taste is of grass, honey, and slight tropical fruit which differentiates itself from others in the style.  Not bad, but one that I will likely not pick up again."
"m writing this is because it made me. do yourself a favor and pass right by this beer."

"I only gave it a ""3" because it had a cool looking can! Other than that...tastes like Miller Lite mixed with kitty litter...very gritty!"

"I've had this from the tap at Maui Brewing. It's an okay session beer but I need more ABV. Widely available in Maui."

"Not a bad beer, awesome color and decent head. There is just the right amount of balance between the bitter and sweet that this beer works. The sweetness seems to be like high fructose corn syrup, maybe I am wrong. It has decent carbonation and drinks well. Got a touch ore than I expected in this one !!@"

"Overall, this is a sleeper of a beer. We were a little blown away here. This is an amazing rendition of a not oft-made style from a smaller American brewery, and they nail it both stylistically and artistically. We didn’t really write a long review, but that should speak to its well-crafted simplicity and elegance. The aroma and flavor, both, showcase raw, flakey barley like none other, at least as far as freshness goes. We have a bunch of other “world class” beers lined up in the fridge, but I might honestly give one of them up if I could sip on this the rest of this summer’s night and enjoy the breeze and the hockey game."

"355 ml can poured into a flute. This one is a nice golden yellow with a rich creamy white head that retains its form well. Aroma of hay/grass, dry cracker-like malts, and maybe just hints of orchard fruit and green peppercorns. Taste reveals why this won a World Beer Cup award in 2006. At once bready but not particularly sweet, assertive noble hops, and again just hints of citrus and stone fruit, this is a solid Helles lager. Features a very soft but flavorsome cereal malt character and hoppier than usual for the style. Moderate body with some dextrins apparent, vaguely chalky, and just the right level of carbonation, on the far side of moderate. Finishes dry and grassy with a little white pepper and grape. Nil huskiness or other off-flavors. I regret that I have only one can in my possession."

"O: Solid, clean, and bready. Very fluffy and soft mouthfeel. Goes down easy and smooth."

"Would be a solid session beer on a hot day."

"Pours a clear gold color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of slight sweet malt, pale malt, and a hint of yeast. Fits the style of a Munich Helles Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of slight pale malt, slight sweet malt, hint of caramel malt, and a hint of yeast. Overall, good appearance, decent feel, but weak aroma and body."

"In the taste, quite malty, very bready even a touch of nutty caramel. Mild menthol like minty herb from the hops. Faint citrus. Well carbonated medium bodied lager. Very smooth. This was a refreshingly unique take on the style. I would drink this again without hesitation. A perfect choice for a warm weather thirst quencher, and a solid lager beer."

"A solid lager with a satisfying aroma and flavour. The noble hops are understated but come across well, while the yeast adds depth. Not sure what the Germans would think, but never mind. Well crafted and very drinkable; I'd be happy to have a few of these on the beach. Worth sampling if you come across it."

"O: Decent munich helles lager. Went down easy and was refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"this is a very tasty helles lager, very sweet and flavorful. it's funny that i'm starting to finally appreciate lagers after tasting ones outside of nj."
""
""
""
""
"O: While nothing spectacular this is a solid lager. I could see this being a nice everyday summer brew for myself. Easy drinking but with good flavor and a nice balance. This is my first taste of Maui Brewing as a selection of their beer was given to me by a friend who had it while in Hawaii. I'm looking forward to trying the rest of the beers."

"“Bikini Blonde is a fresh handcrafted Helles lager brewed with the finest German hops and barley, not skimpy on flavor… bold, smooth, and refreshing.”"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a decent enough lager, a fair bit better than longboard. Not crisp and clean as you would expect but the creaminess does work."
"Good enough at cold temperatures, but this fails considerably more upon warming. I don't need to revisit this one."
""
"I like this lager. It's very smooth, with a mild sweet tone. Seems very well balanced. All too often I get that overly malty sweet thing with so many American produced lagers. But that doesn't happen here. The carbonation gives a bit too much bite on the tongue, but overall, this is a very nice beer. Glad I was able to try it."
""
"O: C+"
"Overall: It’s a solid lager for sure but didn’t wow me like I was hoping. I purchased this because of the high marks it advertised and I was looking for something in a can to pack in a cooler for the beach -- this looked like it fit the bill perfectly. It was pretty expensive though -- I think the same quality can be had for cheaper."

"A more or less perfect start to an evening of relaxing on a patio overlooking the ocean - a light, refreshing, full-flavoured German-style lager - Munich brewing goodness in the Hawaiian Islands, nice. The only drawback? No label to admire, but I have that more than covered (heh) in a few other ways right now."
""
""
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is full of bready malt, with some grass, grapes and yeast thrown in. A fairly complex aroma, definitely more so than I was expecting. The flavor is fairly straightforward, with a lot of bread and biscuit malt as well as some very light spices. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Maui Brewing has done a great job on this beer. It's a beer definitely worth checking out."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Pretty easy to put a few of these back. A little malty and lacks the crispness I'd expect but the smooth creaminess was nice."
"I had this beer on a sunset dinner cruise in Maui. There was nothing liking sipping on this smooth tasting blonde while watching a beautiful hawaii sunset. It's not as bitter as other blondes I've had. Color was light for a blonde and very clear. I really enjoyed it."
""
""
"Overall: Easy drinking and enough flavor to be interesting. Not outstanding, but manages to never fall flat on its face. Carbonation is its downfall in the end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall a decent beer. Easy to drink and light and crisp, with some nice fruit in the taste. Not as good as their CoCoNut Porter but worth checking out once."
""
"O- I've tried several different beers made on these Isles, and so far, this is my favorite beer for everyday drinking! It works very well on the beach, or at the table with family while playing games! It has a richness about it that I never really experienced with anything else local that I tried in a lager, but I realize that this style is supposed to be more fulfilling and it delivers!! Great job Maui Brewing!"
""
""
"Pours a clear golden color with a 1 inch puffy off-white head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Thin broken rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sweet malt/grains and some fruity aromas. Taste is of sweet malt/grains, light fruits, and slight citrus zest. There is a sweetness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a crisp carbonation level with a bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good and easy drinking lager but nothing too exciting."

"This looks like a yellow fizzy beer. Very foamy. Low, barely detectable aroma and not a whole lot of flavor either. There is a honey-sweet taste to it, and a sweet finish, but not a whole lot else going on here. Wasn’t horrible but not terribly exciting. I certainly don’t picture myself sitting on a warm, sunny beach and wanting to drink one of these."
""
""
""
"O: Good tasting beer. Although not a standout, definitely worth a try, and likely something I would drink over and over in a bar."
""
""
""
"Overall – An enjoyable and refreshing beer. It had a nice amount of noble hops and reminded me a but of the sunshine pils by Troegs. I could see myself drinking a few of these on a beach in Hawaii."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a good beer. I enjoyed many of these on my vacation and it became my go to beer in the hot Hawaiian weather."
"Overall this would be an awesome everyday beach drinker, flavourful but not over powering would be awesome with a touch of hoppyness."
"This was a brisk and flavorful lager -- definitely preferred to the mainstream stuff. Solid."
"D - Super drinkable. Very smooth and refreshing without sacrificing on the flavor and the body. Really nice grain-hop mix with just enough sweetness."
"This pours a clear light yellow / straw color with a decent white head. The smell has some noble hops, some bready malts, and a little citrus. Feel is light and crisp. The taste is pretty light also, there are the german hops, some bready flavors and a little earthiness. Not bad."
"M/O: Very crisp and carbonated. Great bright beer that goes perfect in the hot weather."
"It can be a little bit more than a regular six pack of your generic beers, but definitely worth it. I have yet to meet someone who didn't appreciate me bringing this to their get together."
"O- This is an incredibly refreshing beer, one of my favorite pool-side beers. Definition of the session beer"
"O: Really quite decent, but the corn and oil flavors make for a bit of a taxing beverage. It drinks very easy, but the flavor makes me feel like I'm drinking a bag of corn nuts. Some people might really like this, but as a person that likes to have food with beer, I feel like this tastes more of fatty salty fried snacks than I'd like. However, there were some things that made this really pretty good. In the middle-flavors I had visits from plantains and dried apricots. I thought that was a really compelling mix, but it was too short lived. I want to up the fruity characters of this beer, and cut down on the salty nuttiness. There's something worth cultivating in here, but for right now it's just pretty okay."
"D-A very good beer but not your usual helles. As are many of the beers that are bottled or canned down there it is a great warm weather beer."
"Easy drinking with a bold flavor but it’s a very filling beer that I really couldn’t finish many of. Very heavy for a lager."
"Overall, a really good beer that surprised me. Goes down nice and smooth on this hot Texas summer day. Need to get some of this for my friends who I'm getting to explore more beers. Avail in TX for a couple months now. Rotation - I can see getting a six pack of this every so often and would like to try on-tap [O;Y]"
"Overall, it is very drinkable. Very good beach beer."
"Overall: this beer's refreshing qualities and bodacious mouthfeel make me enjoy it beyond its flavor and aroma qualities. I could definitely see myself knocking back a few cans of this on the beach."
"Nice touches of light bready malts, caramel, light grasses and a well rounded and nicely done hop profile. Warming brings out cereal grains, touches of light grass and a well carbonated and easily maintained profile. Extremely session able with an amazingly crisp and clean flavor, I had no issues at all with putting this one down."
"Seriously an enjoyable beer."
"Taste is full with a bit of sweet lemon bread followed by a mild bitterness. Feel is moderate to full, never getting too slippery or watery and maintaining a nice spice character as it warms. Balanced by a spot on level of carbonation and with a return of a rich lemon texture on the finish."
"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty decent beer. Unfortunately it is hard to make a beer this light that won't show something a little weird as it warms up. This one seems to be getting vegetal as it warms up, though I don't think that it was actual corn used. I don't regret getting a 6-pack of this stuff as I will surely drink it. I am not sure when I will be buying another one...but I would certainly consider bringing some to the beach sometime if Southern Star's Bombshell Blonde isn't available where I am."
"A really clean and refreshing lager. Great for a hot summer day like today."
"This one does indeed fall somewhere in the netherealm of a lager and an ale. Too sweet to be a refreshing lager with a distinctive bready, nutty yeast presence. And yet it tastes a bit too 'clean' and has a lighter body than most ales. It is a pretty unique beverage and does have some good flavors, but I think 1 six-pack purchase will be enough to satisfy my curiosity."
"Overall a great beer. It may taste even better because I drank this while staying in paradise. Recomended!"
"Decent representation of a helles but I would like it to have been more crisp and light. Flavor is well integrated and the alcohol in the beginning of the flavor goes away with some warming. Decent lager but who's gonna be critical on the beach in Hawaii."
"Many thanks go out to woodychandler for providing this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, sweet, some grains. Taste is very good, malts, biscuty, some sweetness, extremely refreshing. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a beer worth seeking out."
"Nice level of carbonation. This is an easy beer to drink with enough going on to make it worth a try. It's just a bit too sweet in the finish to make it utterly sessionable. Still, great drinker for the warmer weather."
"Would I buy more of it? - I'd probably go for their IPA or their CoCoNut Porter over this one if faced with choosing from their three canned option. That being said, this is a pretty refreshing and light beer that would be great when mowing the lawn."
"Overall - A sessionable, tasty craft beer in a can. CAN it get any better?"
"O - Overall, an incredibly drinkable beer. This would be my go to beer if I were on the beach in Hawaii. I could see myself sitting in the sun and going through a bucket of these no problem. Like I said earlier, lagers rarely tickle my fancy, but this is a damn fine representative of the style, and one I would absolutely buy again."
"Poured from a can into a pint glass, the beer has a vibrant straw-gold coloring, with crystal clarity and a decent amount of steady carbonation showing in the glass. The head starts out fluffy and thick, but over a minute or two recedes to a thing film of bubbles. Smells burst out of the can during the pour, heavy in oat and slight toasted characters. The beer has a very slick mouthfeel, and the flavors slide through quickly. There are notes of sweet toffee and fruity flavors, as well as the cereal/grain flavors. Very smooth and light in mouth, and unbelievably easy to drink. It's starting to get warm where I am, and this is the perfect beer for a day out in the sun. Fantastic summer picnic or BBQ brew."
"Crisp and drinkable, but a little thin overall for my taste -- I wouldn't seek this one out again. Maui's dynamite Coconut Porter, on the other hand...!"
"Drinkability: Yes! I love this beer and will be being more. Perfect for a summer day or winter night."
"It has a full flavor on the mouthful that tingled in the back of the mouth. I wished the day was 85 degrees out and I could sit on my back patio to enjoy rather then the 45 degrees it was here in Boise."
"Cheers..."
"A stellar lager, excellent example of munich helles. So bready, and malty, and drinkable. Good to know that if I ever find myself in hawaii, there will be at least one good lager to enjoy on the beach."
"D- Just an interesting take on a traditional style. Not great but not too bad. Like a few others from Maui, I had my fair share of these while in Waikiki."
"Drinkability is great, great warm weather beer, crispness and low abv leads to a great session beer."
"One could easily confuse this as a Blonde Ale, rather than a Helles. Sweetness is a bit high (though not cloying), hops are not overly defined, and that expected German lager crispness and clean finish is missing. That said, it's an interesting, very drinkable brew nonetheless."
"D- Refreshing and easily sessionable."
"The mouth is highly carbonated. Lots of bubbles rising quickly throughout this beer. It's not wearing on the palate, but it is spritzy. Strong flavors of lemon, lime, and a bit of a chemical astringency that I can't place. Faint hops noted. Bitterness is low. This is extremely easy to consume. It was gone before I knew it. Great refreshing beer for the warm months, the beach, or the backyard."
"Lighter body, very carbonated, some lingering dryness. Pretty smooth drinking, and definitely not bad beer overall. This would be pretty nice as an afternoon session beer during warmer months."
"The Bikini Blonde pours a hazy, golden lemon yellow color with only a thin foamy white head. The aroma is a bit grainy, but it has an underlying hop profile of earth and citrus. The flavor is light, sweet, and a bit lemony. Not heavily carbonated, it is light on the tongue, making this lager an easy drinking beer that seems to fit perfectly as the light lager option from a brewery based in a small town on the west coast of Maui."
"D - Why a five? Because i could literally drink this for 24 hours straight."
"Bikini Blonde reminds me more of the modern Helles style Festbiers rather than a simple mild Helles Lager. Very drinkable and refreshing beer! This is my first Maui product and I am not disapointed."
"D: An almost perfect session brew. A craft beer lovers ""lawnmower"" beer."
"Overall, a nice, straight-forward lager from the islands. Nothing earth-shattering, but very good for what it is: a refeshingly simple beer perfect for relaxing with."
"D) a delicious lager. I'd drink another for sure."
"drinkability - a nice lager overall, well crafted"
"Into a pint glass, in poured a highly-carbonated translucent gold, with one finger of white, decent retention, and average lacing. Smelled of apple, pear, and herbal noble hops. The taste confirmed the aroma, with a nicely blended fruit/malt backing, and finishing on a modest herbal note. Light-bodied, and smoother than expected with not as much carbonation as the appearance would suggest. An excellent session Helles."
"Drinkability: I would have this again if this was regularly available. I recommend this to those seeking a solid lager with a pleasant malt profile."
"I tried this with some stinky French cheeses, Morbier and Pont L'Eveque, and it was a terrific pairing. The carbonation cut through the richness of the cheeses, while the quick hit of malt and orange added just enough fruit to tame the pungent, slightly bitter cheeses."
"This is a very light beer and it doesn't have that grainy aftertaste I don't like in light lagers so I find the drinkability of this to be fairly high. Overall a nice but not astounding lager."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is smooth and rich. Very enjoyable and refreshing. This is a dangerously drinkable beer that I'm not sure I could stop picking up in a social setting."
"The body is crisp and clean. Drinkability is very good, having a few of these would be easy and fun. Certainly worth trying if you see it."
"Also I had a second can poured into a devul tulip to see the difference... the nose was much more pronounced and the biscuit flavor was heightened a great deal."
"It's grainy, semi-sweet, clean and crisp on the palate. Honey flavors emerge again along with subtle fruitiness (banana and stonefruit). Aside from a hint of buttery slickness in the finish, the mouthfeel is clean and crisp and the body light. It's a touch sweeter than I generally like my lagers to be, but it's a well-crafted beer."
"This probably wouldn't be my first choice at the bar, yet I could see myself happily drinking this all night long. Love the grainy character."
"D: Very drinkable, smooth, crisp and dry. Perfect for summertime!"
"Drinkability: Nice Helles Lager overall, but I prefer my German lagers a little more dry."
"Overall: Decent helles lager. I haven't had all that many, but it seems pretty good for german lager styles in general."
"D - Definitely a good session beer."
"As for the appearance, its very light and almost looks like a macro lager. Heavy carbonation, light thin head with no retention and no lacing. For the smell, there's not much there. Again, smells like a macro. For the taste, its very similar to a BMC beer but with a little extra spiciness at the finish. It's also a little sweeter. The mouthfeel is very thin with pretty much no bitterness. Drinkability is high as this is a very easy drinking beer and thus a good session brewski."
"Pours clear gold with a tinge of goldenrod. Nice lasting white head is the only thing differentiating this from a macro lager so far. Aroma is wet grains and a vague perfumey floral hop character. Flavor is cereal grains, a touch of citrus, and a light grassy finish with a modest bitterness that barely tickles the tongue. Mouthfeel is standard, drinkability is pretty good."
"D: a refreshing brew for a hot day on Maui. it wouldn't be my first choice, but a satisfying beer under the right circumstances."
"D - Very Drinkable. I could picture this beer being the gateway for those who are used to BMC pale lagers."
"Mouthfeel is light and effervescent. Drinkable, but not exciting."
"Thanks, atigerlife, for the opportunity"
"Beach: Sure, as long as I am vacationing in Hawaii. Don't pay premium prices to haul it to a mainland beach. My .02"
"D: In Maui, on the beach or in the pool after a long day of hiking, a tall glass of this beer really really does the trick. It's a very nice change of pace from the fruity colored booze conveyance devices that are so ubiquitous here."
"Drinkability is very good. This is a nice tasty lager that is very easy to drink. Would be a great go to beer on a warm summer day. Well done Maui Brewing, all three beers I have tried from your brewery have been quite good. And canned to boot!"
"The taste is a lot of grain, a little slightly raisiny alcohol, grass, hay, pear, apple peel. It has some slight, faintly off-tasting, husk and vegetal flavours that become noticeable after the first couple sips and which detract slightly, but they are very light. It has a long grain aftertaste and is full-bodied. Its taste is a bit unusual but otherwise it's a good, full-bodied lager more reminiscent of American style lagers than true German Helles lagers."
"Poured a nice golden yellow with very little foam and no lace. The smell of mild hops and barley filled the nose with a fresh aroma. The taste was also of hops and barley. Nice balance of ingriedents with just a little sweet bitterness. Nice for summer quincher or just sitting around chewing the fat!"
"Just a really good sweet session beer that wont yell at you and call you hurtful names like ""Prick"" and ask you to leave the set."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink for sure. Not a challenge in the least bit, but good for a hot day. Better than Miller Lite :)"
"Overall: Very easy to drink. Deliciously refreshing, would be such a treat on a hot day. Many flavors while"
"Serving type: can"
"Well , the cheescake can does not bode well for what is inside but surprise Maui brewing put some effort into this light beach beer. The beer is cloudy (like an unfiltered Lager from germany). The nose is nice and hoopy and the taste is pretty full bodied. The more I drunk this the more I appreciated the craft put into making a decent all malt lager with some character."
"Beer pours bright, shimmery yellow, with an inch of frothy head. Foam quickly fades leaving little or no lace. Light smell of citrus and light malt, also thought we picked up some honey-like sweetness. The flavor is lightand flowery, with sweet malt, and a clean, dry finish. Enough hops to keep balanced, but not bitter. No aftertaste. Easy to drink, and best served cold. - and I get to keep the can."
"D: very drinkable, light and refreshing. solid helles."
"Thanks Maui. My first taste of your offerings was worth it."
"Can: Poured a light golden color lager with a large pure white foamy head with great retention and some lacing. Aroma of pure malt with some traces of dry German hops. Taste is also well balance between some lightly sweet malt with a somewhat dry finish with noticeable crisp hops. Well done for the style."
"Here's a lager I can enjoy on the beach, but at a high price (about $10 a 4-pack here in SoCal). That's just for starters; being so light, I might need two 4-packs for a day at the beach."
"Pours a pale gold color with a ton of pure, clean white head. Head sticks around for while, but eventually shrinks to a ball that sits in the middle of the glass. Great lacing (wasn't expecting that). Aroma is floral and citrusy, with biscuity tones also present. Taste is floral hops and sweet maltiness. Finishes slightly bitter. Light to medium in body with a crisp and creamy feel. Very drinkable, I wish I had more than one to be honest! Hawaii....check!"
"6/4/6/3/14 (3.3/5)"
"Overall a decent brew from Hawaii, and you really can't ask for any more. Thankful I had the opportunity to try it."
"Decent stuff here, that while not possessing the most in-your-face flavor profile that I've had, was still quite refreshing and quaffable. I'd definitely go to this for some thirst quenching relief."
"D: A fair beer from Maui, not as good as the major German producers, I thought it was too hoppy for the style."
"D: This is an OK beer. It could be a sessional beer. It's certainly good for a lager."
"Drinkability - This is THE beer you want to drink first after a long day's work. It is thirst quenching and flavorful yet light enough in alcohol that you can down a can or two without feeling tipsy. As far as American-made session lagers go this is on the top of my list."
"Maui Brewing has another winner with Bikini Blonde Lager. I'd take her (and five of her friends) to the beach any day of the week. If you're looking for wonderful balance and drinkability in a canned beer, look no further. Aloha."
"From a 12oz. can into my Smuttynose shaker glass, the pour produces a hazy light yellow color with a frothy white foam that measures about two fingers deep. Smells of bready grains and citrusy hops. The hops really come through in the taste, producing flavors of lemon peel and bitter orange. A nicely hopped lager. The aftertaste reminded me of lemon cleaner. Medium in both body and carbonation. If this was more accessible, I'd reach for this on a regular basis."
"S-Certainly drinkable and refreshing beer, but too light. It goes down easy, has some flavour and certainly refreshing, but give me a sign that this isnt water (or a BMC light product.)"
"Surprisingly pleasant."
"Drinkability is completely subject to how much you like sweet lagers; I personally don't think this is all that great."
"S: Very drinkable beer. It goes down easy and it's flavorful and refreshing."
"Has a similar aroma as a Heineken, which is to say mildly skunky, but tastes a bit better and has more body and character. Nice mouthfeel, very drinkable. Perfect hot weather session beer, to be served ice cold. Overpriced though, to be sure. I think this was around $10 a sixer, which makes Heineken look cheap in comparison."
"Is this what the Sailors REALLY come to shore for? I doubt it."
"This was delivered to me by a dear friend who just returned from a terrific visit to Kauai. It pours a bright, translucent yellow, with a one-inch foamy head that dissipated very soon into a lean surface covering. Smells of citrus and light malts are certainly noticeable with a good sniff. Also, a nice floral presence is discernible. The aroma is delightful and seems to predict a particular taste. The flavor is light, with a bit of sweet malts on the front, followed by a dry and biscuity finish. Hops aren't on top here; there is an emphasis on balance with this one. Not much of a lingering aftertaste. Easy to drink, and best served cold."
"I had to edit my review and knock the drinkability down to 1.0, as I will never drink it again. So after the first night of drinking it, I woke up the next morning with a headache and tight muscles. I did not blame this on the beer, and thought it was totally unrelated. Then I talked with my friend who had experienced the same exact thing. I still didnt really put it together. But then I had it again, and sure enough a headache set in, shortly after just one beer. AGAIN, I gave the beer the benefit of the doubt. So I finished off my six pack the next night with the final two beers. Headache and back ache AGAIN. I have no other choice now but to come to the conclusion that they have put Something in this brew that is causing this."
"Easy to drink, and pretty tasty. Not particularly standoutish in any particular dimension, but it's a good lager."
"this is nothing special, the novalty of being from the islands wares off fast, the can is cool though. this is week in abv, color and taste. this tastes of corn and no hpo presents at all, i am glad that i got to try this but one is good enough for me"
"Blondes or these types of lagers are not my favorite beers by any means but this was really good, further proves that Maui's lineup of three is pretty much unparalleled on the islands, drank a lot of this stuff the past week and could still drink more, recommended"
"D : Would be good on a hot summer day but I was hoping for a little more flavor."
"Pours a cloudy yellow with a big white head. Smells of fruity pine, very nice. Head dissipates to a ring around the glass. Little lacing, but some. Yumm.. this is what canned beer should taste like! feels good in the mouth, kind of fizzy, smooth, light but flavorful. Yeasty, a little fruity (apricot?). Nice finish, kind of a dry sweet. I could drink some of this beer."
"Pours cloudy yellow and opaque with a huge lasting head. Smell is yeasty, light malt, and lemon. Taste is smooth and creamy despite the appearance of high carbonation, almost wheaty with a hint of lemon. Musty, yet clean. Interesting and definitely different than the average pale lager."
"My only knocks are that the carbonation, although contributing to the nice head, does make the mouthfeel a little harsh, and the overall price of 10.99 a sixer prohibits this as an everyday brew. Oh well, it does the job and is a nice change of pace."
"Beer poured a straw yellow with a nice foamy white head. Nose was not much, hints of German hops in the background. Taste started with a mellow malted barley. The ending was quite a nice surprise, a blast of spicy German hops. Mouthfeel was light, no redeeming smoothness to be found. Overall drinkability was pretty good, it was refreshing, a great beer to have at the beach!"
"D: Session beer all the way. Bring on a few more."
"It's an straw color - looks very similar to an unfiltered style wheat beer like a hefe of a wit. The taste is very refeshing - some lemon with a nice lingery malt. I could drink this all day."
"Michelle, if you end up reading this review... you need to remind me to give you a big hug tomorrow at work... Thanks from the bottom of my heart."
"D: This is an excellent lager. Satisfying and tasty and actually quite interesting to the palate. I wasn't expecting much and was pleasantly surprised."
"Maui Brewing Co.'s Bikini Blonde Lager is a enjoyable beverage. It pours from the can a nice golden color. The head is frothy, white, and large. The smell is a mixture of citrus, grass, yeast, and malts, with none being overwhelming. The taste is nicely balanced between sweetness and bitter, neither one over-riding the other. The finish is dry and crisp. A very refreshing beer. Enjoy!"
"Tastes light malt sweet with lemony zing. Some musky hops, like tettnanger. Wet finish with some carbonation acrid placing a sour counterpoint. Nice hop flavor with a honey-like hallertauer. Clean of esters and no oxidation. Touch of papery. Light body and strong carbonation. Nice enjoyable beer."
"Drinkability: One of my favorite lagers. I'm not much of a lager-lover, but I enjoy them on beach days. This was refreshing and not too bitter. Excellent find, Couz! Ono!"
"My parents brought this back from Hawaii, I showed my graditude by spilling about half the can on ground before drinking. Crying in my beer aside, what remains of the can pours a slightly hazy golden color with a thick foamy head, probably a little larger than it would be if it was a controled pour, but it lingers very nicely. The aroma is crisp and grainy with hints of sweetness. The beer is crisp and dry with more of the grainy flavor from the aroma. The flavor is light, but what is there is nice. This is definitely a training wheels beer for the brewery, but not bad considering."
"I had this beer on tap at the brewery while I was on vacation there. As a disclaimer, I should mention that I'm not a huge fan of light beers. This beer was straw colored. It has a light hop aroma with not much else present. The hop flavor is pretty good, and is the strongest flavor without being too strong. It is light bodied and I would consider it to have medium drinkability."
