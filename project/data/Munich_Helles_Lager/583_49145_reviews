"O -- Overall, this is a nice, flavorful drinker -- very reminiscent of Anchor's California Lager.  But it's not as big and bready with melanoidin character that I remember from fresh Munich Helles and the graininess is not at all to character.  Nevertheless, I won't hesitate to pick up some of this when the mood strikes."

"Certainly not the best Helles Lager I have had, but a little better than average"

"Pours a straw-yellow in color with a thin white head that settles to just along the edges of the glass. Some spotty lacing was seen with each sip. The aroma is of malts with a hint of lemon zest. Pretty much the same for the taste with a slight sweetness in the mix as well. No bitter or harsh aftertaste and goes down easy. One of the BETTER 'summer lagers'. Medium bodied with higher carbonation. Overall a good refreshing seasonal brew."

"One of the better Helles style lagers I've had, this presents a complex aroma and taste. The nose is bready and doughy with a cracker style malt but flashes of lemon, honey and molasses come through. The flavors are more malty, with a barley grain, caramel, molasses, tea leaf and cracker. There is still some of the obligatory bread and dough but I get lemon and honey for sweetness. Hints of iced tea finish in a very refreshing beer."

"tried a fresh bottle again today. Most of this is the same, but there's overwhelming diacetyl here too now. Obtrusive in the nose, obtrusive in the flavor, and leaves a really slick body on the mouthfeel. Bumped all scores down; disappointed in this version."

"O: Not much to say. It's faint, a little too funky, but pretty drinkable and unoffensive, if not quite pleasant."
"O: This really seems to be a nice selection for a ""lawnmower"" beer if you're looking for something that's very easy to drink but isn't an adjunct or a light lager."
""
""
""
""
""
"Straw yellow in color with lively carbonation. Just a bit of foam on top. Pale malt in the aroma. The mouthfeel is pretty crisp and smooth. The taste is pretty refreshing and simple. Just a hint of corn and almost like a bit of grapefruit. Pretty satisfying as a refresher."
""
""
"Overall: good summer beer that I would share with anyone."
""
""
""
"O - Overall not to my liking, but it was fresh. Wasn't what I was expecting from a summer style brew. It made me want to snack on peanuts or have a pizza. Don't get me wrong, I would have another, however I think I would first ask, ""What else ya got?"""

"Overall- A good summer beer. Easy to drink and refreshing on a hot summer day."
"Overall, I'd choose Konig Pilsner or Pilsner Urquell when I want a lager. I'd probably never have this again."
""
""
""
"Overall: Good summer brew, refreshing."
""
"Overall, a decent beer although the flavors are quite fleeting. I only wish they would hang around longer. Something I would consider picking up again, though."
""
"Overall a decent lager. A bit too sweet for me."
""
""
""
"O- I would say that this is a highly drinkable lager, and it stands up really well to it's American counterparts....can't say if its the best out there but it has great flavor for the style that doesn't overpower, and would be really refreshing on a hot day as a patio beer! I recommend giving this a try!"

"O: Good and refreshing lager for the warm weather."
"It has a wonder full deep golden colored body. There isn't much for bubbles or head. There is however a bit of tight lacing. It has an average lager aroma there is nothing that special about it. There are some grassy tones but that is about it. It has a grainy and light hops flavor. There is a bit of a corn tone to the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light and easy to drink."
"D- A very enjoyable light beer for the horrid summers in Missouri."
""
"12 ounce bottle, bottled on 3/16/2012. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a clear light gold color with a half inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The brew smells like bready malt, grassy hops and light citrusy (lemon peel) hops. It tastes mostly like grainy/bready malt and some light grassy hops. It's light, crisp and refreshing with good carbonation. This would be really good on a hot summer day (as opposed to a rainy, mid 40 degree day like today is here). At $8.99 a six pack, I'd buy this again. I liked it."

"Light mouthfeel and crispness."
""
""
"There's not a whole lot to say about the beer, but it is a good, lighter beer that you could easily put a few back and still feel alright. Will probably enjoy this beer a few times throughout the summer."

"a nice twist on the standard summer beers out there, this is an extremely light lager, but it is more than that. pours a profoundly clear thin yellow color, schockingly light, but with a refreshing and excited head. nose is german malts all the way, with a hint of summer aromatics, cut grass, and dandellions. the flavor is way bigger than the appearance, and the munich malts are center stage. light body means high drinkability, but in a helles i need more body, too thin even for a summer brew. a not boring summer beer though. round it out with a bit more body next year and itd be a real winner."
"Nice touches of light bready malts, caramel, light grasses and a well rounded and nicely done hop profile. Warming brings out cereal grains, touches of light grass and a well carbonated and easily maintained profile"
"Light bodied, rounded and supple and soft. Crisp and refreshing on the palate with a short finish. Solid and easy to drink. I'd have no qualms drinking multiples if this was my only option for a hot summer afternoon. There's nothing fancy here, but for a summertime lager I'm quite impressed."
"Poured this Helles Lager from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This Helles poured a golden hazy straw color. It produced a average white head, it has poor retention and there was a average amount of lacing left on the glass. The aroma consists of a slight hint of grain, and hints of citrus hops. The taste of the Helles Lager is light in body, some mildly toasted malted grain, slightly sour citrus hops in the finish. Overall the beer is very smooth, drinkable. Excellent session beer/lawn mower beer. Good intro into craft beer."
"On tap in St Louis. Pours light, low to moderate carbonation and very little head. No detectable hop aroma. Great pilsener taste, somewhat light on the mouthfeel - wondering if there's a little adjunct in here? More malt backbone and this would be really good. As it is, it's still an enjoyable Helles. Would definitely buy again."
"Overall: I have been on a Helles style kick lately and this one just does not stack up to the more local (Pennsylvania) offerings."
"Pours a clear, wan yellow with a thick and not persistent white head. However, the unimpressive appearance is this beer's weakest point. Aroma is fairly strong, malty and a little fruity, typical but still acceptable. Flavor is rather well-rounded, better than most lagers I have tried, malty with a firm undertone of apple and pear. Texture is smooth, a little thick, just a bit fizzy. All in all, fair to middlin' and worth at least a try."
"I think I'll have another."
"Would I buy more of it? - I probably would. It's a nice change from all those IPAs I love so much."
"The beer pours out a bright straw yellow with a fluffy white head on a good draft pour. Typical of the helles style, there is almost no aroma off the beer. The initial taste is crisp, light, and unimposing. The malts give a toasted grain and slightly grassy – maybe lemony – taste throughout the drink. This is then followed by a light hop snap just before a very dry swallow. Schlafly cans this beer for a reason: it’s the quintessential summertime beer."
"O: Very sessionable; the lower than expected carbonation may even help here. Missed the style a bit in appearance (helles=bright)."
"Once again woodychandler unearths a canned beer for me to try. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a pale golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, a touch of citrus. Taste is crisp, refreshing, a tad sweet and malty. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent brew."
"Just a very average beer here. I know that not all beers of this style are that mundane and restrained, which is good."
"O: Nothing fancy just a nice Summer beer, an easy drinker and good for a few."
"Overall/notes - Well, there's two things Schlafly knows: German beer and a hot, Missouri summer. The two are combined here for yet another refreshing brew. It won't wow anyone with its depth or complexity, but when both the temperature and humidy hit the nineties, that's the last thing I'm worrying about."
"Helles is a tricky style since you can't hide anything. While this one seems to play it safe, it is quite clean and therefore a decent example of the style."
"Overall, I found this a little more enjoyable straight from the can, but this is certainly a tasty and enjoyable for a summer beer."
"O: Quite drinkable and refreshing, good beer to crack on this first hot day of June."
"The CPJ"
"Hazy light yellow gold in color. Forms a large sudsy head. Good retention. Smell is odd an unappealing: a combination of bready malt and cider vinegar. Taste is slightly more appealing with bready malts, some light noble hops, and a little beast of yeasty banana."
"A rich and tasty light brew, tailor-made for warm weather."
"Overall this is a better alternative than Budweiser on a hot day."
"O - this is not my favorite offering from schlafly, nor is it my favorite summer-style beer, but it is most definitely worth a try"
"This beers has supplanted Bud Light as my bbq beer! Go ahead and get yourself a 6 pack of this, invite some friends over, fire up the grill, and enjoy!"
"O: This is a great light beer. I anticipate transitioning out of my winter stouts with this beer every year. When I need something lighter with flavor I never hesitate to grab this beer. It is in my beer cooler and fridge for the whole summer."
"D: All around a great beer to me. They go down so smooth and the beer is very refreshing."
"Canned this is an excellent fishin' beer. I could easily drink them all day long, and fast. Tasty when really cold too."
"Thanks to Jeff M. for bringing a few samples back from St. Louis."
"Are you looking to fill your cooler? This is it!"
"Drinkability - great summer/fall beer. These go fast."
"The summer lager pours a nice golden color with a pillowy white head and some lacing on the pint glass. Smells of yeast, soap, and some hops. Not a huge smelling beer but pleasant. Taste is crisp and refreshing with somewhat of a hop finish. In between there are floral notes as well as breads. Mouthfeel is crispy and light bodied. Drinkability is good for a summer afternoon. Definitely very sessionable with the mediocre ABV. I could handle a sixer of this pretty easily."
"Overall this was a dissapointing beer. Back to the drawing board for this one."
"Got a keg of this one on at home and it is not lasting long. The beer pours a light straw color. There is absolutely no haze in this one. A finger of white head falls to a brief cover over the brew, leaving a decent amount of sticky lace as it falls. This one fits right with what I expect for the style. The nose has some sweat fermenting dough qualities to it, with a light and crisp noble hop playing behind it. Things are pretty mellow in the aroma. The flavor brings more prevalence to the herbal noble hop sitting over the slightly sweet bready quality of the malt. It finishes with a crisp bitterness that hangs on beyond the final swallow of the beer. The mouthfeel is on the lighter end of moderate but with a moderate carbonation of very fine bubbles that really makes it feel light. The drinkability of this beer is second to none. At 4.5%, it is a true session beer. All aspects of the brew are mellow, but not boring at all. This is a style that needs to be made by more breweries. I might be putting in an order for another 50L of this one sooner than later."
"Overall: Not a bad beer by any means, it's just not something that I would pay the extra dollar-fifty a sixer for when I could just drink some Dos Equis or Modelo and get the same effect."
"Drinkability is relatively high. It's an easily sessionable beer not only due to low ABV, but also a small and simple flavor profile. Clean and refreshing, yep it's a summer lager alright."
"Nice malt sweetness of the best simplicty. This simple toasted malt sweetness mxies well with a divining grass hops that balance everything out to crisp yet sweet brillance. Very crisp palate that is refreshing and easily sessionable with lots of flavor."
"Mouthfeel is a little heavier than a Pilsener. The spicy kick adds a new dimension to a crisp finish. I had this with some spicy Pad Thai, delicious combo. I look forward to cracking open a can after mowing the lawn."
"side note schlafly tweeted that they are canning these this summer!!!"
"It has a wonder full deep golden colored body. There isn't much for bubbles or head. There is however a bit of tight lacing. It has an average lager aroma there is nothing that special about it. There are some grassy tones but that is about it. It has a grainy and light hops flavor. There is a bit of a corn tone to the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light and easy to drink."
"Pours a straw yellow with a thin white head; not much in the way of lacing as it goes down. The smell is a bit of grassy malt with a tiny bit of sweetness. There is some citrus in there as well; this comes out a little bit in the taste along with some Noble hops. The mouthfeel is light-medium with moderate carbonation. This was very refreshing on a hot summer's day."
"This brewery had the right idea when they aimed more toward a Munich Helles than a typical American Summer Ale for their summertime beer."
"Drinks pretty easy, wouldn't say this takes me back to Germany, but an alright American take on the style"
"This beer pours a clear straw color with a one finger of sudsy head to it. Head retention is quite good but leaves no lacing on the glass. Nose is of grains, malts, spices and a bit of lemon zest. Taste is light malts up front, a bit of vanilla, with a finish of lemn zest and a touch of clove. Light bodied beer, medium carbonation, goes down easy and makes for a nice summer sessionable beer."
"Refreshing, smooth and very drinkable. Light/medium bodied. A very nice summer cooler but good enough to be a year round drink."
"I'm really starting to fall in love with these Munich helles lagers, they are just so good. This one is being reviewed from the tap room on st.Louis on of my favorite places in the world. Has a light golden color with zero head on it, smell is kinda weak has. Tiny skunkiness to it like it should. Taste is awesome ,has the perfect mixture of malt and hops. This beer has a great mouthfeel and even better drinkability"
"It would not be hard to drink a lot of these."
"Schlafly needs to make this very drinkable brew all year round. I could pound these all night. Good job Schlafly!!!"
"12oz. bottle served in a pilsner glass. Poured a pale straw with a quickly dissipating head. Noble hops in the nose with a little sulfur, also some bready malt. Decent base of malt, fairly dry. Noble hops in the finish. Very easy drinking. This is a great summer time beer. I've been drinking a lot at the lake this summer."
"D - Very tasty and refreshing. Just came in from outside where the temperature is @ 95. This really hit the spot. Well worth a try."
"Taste features a bit of sweet, fresh toasted grain, a refreshing lemon zest like citrusy hops, along with a bit of spice. Slightly dry finish. Very refreshing and easy drinking on a hot summer day. A welcomed new edition to the Schlafly seasonal lineup."
"Its got a very light taste but there is still a bit of hops on the tongue. I was pretty surprised with this beer, usually summer styles have a strong, almost overpowering citric taste to them but there was just a hint of lemon and honey here. The overall effect was very very good. It's not a complex taste at all, but very drinkable and a very solid choice for a summer lager."
"What a flavorful Helles. Actually, it's bold enough with the floral hops that it actually brings out a fair amount of nectar-like fruitiness. Edges closely to a super clean Blonde Ale. The hop flavor (Saaz?) makes a remarkable impact in the nose and taste, then carries the beer deep into the clean finish. The hearty pilsner malts give a firm foundation for the hops and without interferring with the delicate and perfumy notes. Softly sweet and bready to create a nice light body and to bolster the carbonation to support a lot of creaminess upfront, and then dryness late. Definately a top choice for the lawnmower types. Only a slight graininess and vegital note both in the aroma and flavor keep this beer from very high scores."
"This is a fine example of a summer session lager and what a good time to try it: the memorial day weekend. This is an underrated style and I am glad to see more breweries attempting the helles lager."
"this is a perfect summer beer. nice and light in flavor but still has that dominant beer profile."
"Overall, not my favorite of the schlafly beers. or maybe its just me. This entire winter I have indulged in Belgians, stouts, and dopplebocks. really complex brews with alot of flavor and alcohol. As for this beer, I just don't feel it is exceptional or unique"
"Pours a clear, pale yellow color. 3/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of yeast cleanliness, pale malt, and slight biscuit/grass aroma. Fits the style of a Munich Helles Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with a higher than average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast cleanliness, noticeable pale malt flavor, really smooth finish, but slightly reminiscent of an adjunct without the harsh metallic aftertaste. Overall, a really easy drinking beer, but nothing I would drink unless it's scorching out."
"D - This is a nice sessionable lager. Not a bad attempt at a German lager."
"D - this is the definition of a summer beer. Light, easy to drink, and refreshing."
"Mouthfeel was zesty and light to medium in body."
"Aroma is toasted biscuit on a malt bed, quaff is very grainy husk, but still the malt backbone kicks in and balances the dry finish. The noble hops add an unique grassy aspect. Very smooth drinking lager, this will go over well in the summer heat and those looking for something but the AB pilsner choices."
"This looks like a pretty typical lager. Light amber/yellow color. Not a lot of body or head. I always expect a salty flavor from a helles but this one is particularly mild. It's a good beer for a hot summer day but there is no need to go out of your way to try Schlafly's, which is a a shame because they typically do a great job."
"D: See the last line of above. It's wierd, but it really reminds me of their Kolsch. To prove it, I did a side-by-side. It's close..Are they using the Kolsch yeast for this beer?? Damned fine session beer, even better than their Pils. Will pick up a case jsut to have around...looks to be a new staple in the fridge for me. Damned fine lager, guys."
"I had this on tap yesterday at the main bar in the Tap Room. It poured a clear straw colored gold with a thick fluffy white head. It presented a malt aroma with some fruity essence. The malt came across with mild figs and dates and a hint of caramel on the finish. The fruit came as just a hint of pear on the finish. The flavor reminded me of a delicate Maibock. More subtle, not as sweet. Something for a hot weather day (which it is in St. Louis). It had the sweet malt with light caramel and dates, and more fruit than I see in bock beers in th form of pear and apple flavors. Nice smooth mouth feel, very drinkable. Good hot weather beer."
"When poured into my glass, the head was small sized and white with fine-large bubbles that quickly dissipated.The body was carbonated and clear with a golden hue.The nose was malty and somewhat skunky.It had a bitter flavor that left an aftertaste.The mouthfeel was tingly, smooth, thin textured, watery and medium bodied.There was virtually no lacing with this beer."
"I would rate this beer as very drinkable and clearly a session brew. It is most reminiscent of the Hofbrauhaus strain of Helles and I believe it could sub there very easily. Clean, crisp, and clear are all attributes of this offering."
"Clear light golden in color with a small white head that doesn't last very long.Light bready and flowery aroma, starts sweet and bready with a hint of grains and flowery hop flavors, light bodied, somewhat of a thin and watery mouthfeel, finishes smooth and crisp, I would say this is an average American Helles lager."
