"Golden color, white cap with no lacing, smells and tastes of biscuits, malts, and yeast.  Bubbly carbonation and easy to drink.  Great all around beer."
""
"16.9 oz bottle poured into a stein. Light gold color, excellent clarity, and a creamy white head that leaves behind spotty lacing. Sweet malts in the aroma with a touch of spice from the hops. Clean and malty in the flavor as well but great balance with the hops. Medium bodied, full of flavor, and ridiculously easy to drink. Soft carbonation bubbles rise to the surface throughout the beer. A classic Helles lager, one of the best I've had to date."

"beautiful, almost champagne-like pour with lots of carbonation. lively brew! lively yellow color. a bit dry. takes me back to ""the day"" when I was venturing out, branching out on my beer and realizing there is more to beer than Michelob and Lowenbrau. Old World Village in Huntington Beach is where I got my first tastes at 17 and haven't looked back. great memories. great beer. Germany still rules..... if this is a LAGER, than this is one of the best representations of it."
""
"Just about the very definition of that classic German lager. Highly carbonated, very clear. Almost no hop flavor but clean malts."

"O - I don't venture into imports very often, I'm glad I did this time. This beer was refreshing in many ways."

""
"11.2 oz bottle poured into pint glass.  A: clear light yellow, very little head S: Distinctive, grainy T: smooth, balanced, very light flavor F: watery O: a cut above typical American lagers but not as good as Czech beers.  I am not a fan of this style, so consider the source."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – I feel like I know Weihenstephaner mostly for the hefeweissbier and the weisse variants, but this is one of the better golden lagers I’ve ever had.  Something to satisfy the beer snob AND the mass-market lager consumer."

"The quintessential Munich Helles......nuff said."
""
"O:  super clean and easy-drinking, Original tastes very much like a good German pilsener with the hops sucked out of it -- there's no discernible hop flavor in this, no grass, dirt, earth, nothing bitter; much, much better than American-made Helles I've tried, but it's a nothing special if still solid brew, and one I'll definitely revisit as a palate-cleanser when taking a break from the hops"
""
"O: the sulfur detracted from the experience;"
"OI: A world class beer and one of the beers that sets the standard for the style. A must try at the brewery or in Germany. Didn't give it a 5 because I like one other helles just a bit more."
""
"It's light yellow in color, hazy/foggy with super white head and sticky lacing all down the glass. Aroma is strong wheaty funk. Super smooth to drink, light bodied, well carbonated, wheat sweetness. Crisp, wheat sweetness. Goes great with fresh water fish."
"Weihenstephaner Original Premium -----4/5."
""
""
"Pours a nice clear golden yellow, nice two finger head, fluffy bone white. Good carbonation bubbles rising, nice lacing. Aroma is grassy, with just a touch of spring flowers, with a nice bready malt smell in the background. The taste is grainy malt up front with a nice bitter crisp noble hop finish - very nice. The mouthfeel is crisp, light with a good carbonation bite. Overall, this is one of the best lagers you'll find out there, light, crisp, but full of flavor."

"What an amazingly clean and refreshing beer! Awesome clarity and balance! Pours a light straw yellow that displays a spritzy carbonation. So smooth and drinkable. Taste has an incredible balance of hops and malts. Each are subtle; a slight hint of bitterness with a slightly sweet and malty finish. I also detect a lot of bready tones. Feel is so crisp; the carbonation tickles the tongue and is slightly spicy. A light beer but oh so flavorful. If I was trapped in a hot desert and I came upon an oasis, this just might be my first order."
"A little too metallic/grainy in the flavor profile for my taste. This characteristic may be true to style."

"Pours a clear straw-golden yellow in color with a good 3-finger foamy white head that settles down to around a good 10mm after a while. A decent amount of sticky lacing is seen with each sip. The aroma is most of grassy grains.Pretty much the same for the taste with bread/yeast with a hint of lemon zest(?) in the mix. Crisp and easy to drink and goes down easy. Lighter+-medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall another great brew from the world's oldest brewery! (Started in 1040 AD)."

"0,5 l bottle into a mug. Clear pale golden, white medium head that fades quickly, good lacing. Grainy malt and floral, grassy hops on the subtle smell. Crisp and grainy taste of pale malt, followed by a floral, lemony and slightly grassy hop taste, ending dry with slight bitterness. Fresh and lemony aftertaste. Light body, high stingy carbonation. Overall a pleasant helles. Light and crisp with some flavor."

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and good example of the style, it had everything that I look for in a German made Lager and there wasn't any aspects that felt out of place.  This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, crisp, slightly prickly, not filling at all and the taste did a nice job of holding my attention, I could drink more than a few of these without getting tired of it.  What I like the most about this beer was how true to style it was, it had everything that I expect from a good German made Lager.  What I like the least about this beer is nothing, there isn't anything that I disliked or would change, it's good just the way it is.  I would buy this beer again when in the mood for the style and I would recommend it to anybody that enjoys a good Lager.  All in all I was happy with this beer,it was just a well crafted lager and I enjoyed it.  This is up there as one of the better beers I've had from this brewery and I think it's now my favorite German made Lager.  Good job guys, this was one good Lager, Keep up the hard work."

"Overall, this beer is lovely. All parts work well together."
"O: Refreshing and super easy to drink - very enjoyable and a great example of the style. Definitely worth getting and I plan on getting it again soon (it's good for the summer)."
""
""
""
"O: Great example of the style. Very enjoyable beer. Perfect for this near 95 degree day."

""
""

"This everything one could ask for in a lager beer and I give it high marks. I think I paid only about 4-something for the half liter, which ain't too bad considering it came halfway around the world from here. It's good to see more variety in my town (Butte, Montana, purchased at the Hennessey)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I expected this to be just a bit behind the favorites of this brewery: Korbinian, Vitus, Hefe, Kristal, etc. But I believe this beer more than holds its own. Very crisp and refreshing. Perfect for a hot summer day. Does all the things that a German lager does, with plenty of malt and biscuity tastes. I'd be satisfied to reach for this whenever I see it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All that said, it's not a bad beer, just not one of the best of the style. I prefer Weihenstephan's Oktoberfest, if we're talking pale lagers."

"This was my first Munich helles style lager and I was very pleased. This is what I expect a lager to do for me after a bout of sweltering yard work."

"Pours a clear deep gold with a somewhat foamy white head. The head has moderate retention and leaves some light lacing. The aroma is reminiscent of fresh bread and some nice earthy hops. The taste closely matches the aroma and is just as enjoyable. There is a nice weight to the body a pleasant crispness on the finish. This is a great lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My second one I poured into another chilled glass, it poured nicely and had a nice thick foamy head to it. The color in the glass was light, and looked smooth. After taking a few sips from my glass, I asked the waiter where I could purchase some of these to take home, and I was given directions a nearby liquor store that sometimes carried it. Lucky for me the Total Wine in my hometown of Miami carries this, and it has become a favorite brew of mine."

"First off let me start by saying that I absolutely love their hefeweizen. It's one of my favorites and a beer I give to non-craft drinkers to rave reviews. However, I just don't get how this beer is so highly rated. As the previous reviewer stated it has a skunky smell, much like Heineken and doesn't taste much better either. Maybe my palate isn't advanced enough to taste all the flavors people claim they pick up in this one, yet it just tasted blah. In fact I would turn it down offered it again. Do yourself a favor, if you just have to try this beer because you figure it must be good cause they have been brewing it for like 1000 years and their hefe is so fantastic, then only buy a single. Yet even that I would caution against."
""
""
""
""
"O - I was hoping for a less skunky, more malty brew, just like those SW German helles lagers that are not available here. Guess I'll have to look some more. Although I'm a little disappointed, this beer is not bad at all - just not all that it's cracked up to be IMHO."
""
""
""
""
"I think Jack may have ADD or something... Anyway, following what VDubb referred to as a perfect pour, this stuff looks pretty solid, a clear brassy gold topped by about two fingers or so of white foam. The nose comprises hard water, straight grains, noble hops, grass, flowers, and light wild rice. The taste brings in more of the same, the noble hops shining against a backdrop of mineral-laden grains. The body straddles the line between hefty light and light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a damn tasty and extremely easy-to-drink beer. Why don't more beer drinkers take home sixers of this on the reg?"

"O - Beerdrinkers of the world (and by world I mean Beer Advocates) really need to recognise that there is definitely a place for lagers. This was a great way to start my session, easing in with a classic and refreshing beverage."

"I love this beer and glad it is readily available in the Cleveland area. I have a good friend who was skeptical, but is now a believer as well. As member Ohiolager said - ""move over Hofbrau"". Hofbraus is good too, but this beer is my pick at the moment."
""
""
""
"Not my favorite style, but this classic beer is definitely worth trying every once in a while."
""
"overall this is a must have. its drink ability is superior, tastes better than it smells and it's from the worlds oldest brewery. for an import, top that! my new favorite helles Munich lager move over hofbrau."

"The Original is great....it poured a clear golden color with thin white head that is leaving some lace. The scent carries biscuit and grass like tones. The taste is well balanced....its starts with nice bready push then finishes slightly bitter coming off the pallet very clean!!! The mouthfeel is light to medium in body with great carbonation. Overall this is an excellent beer great for sessioning as it is very easy drinking...I would have this again....and again....and again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A wonderfully done lager. Crisp, clean, delicious flavors. Very well balanced."
""
""
"Overall- Really like this helles lager as it pretty much is dead on clean malt flavors (I'd like it a little drier) and a crisp hop snap backing it up.  Simple but plenty of flavor for an easy drinking beer."
""
""

""
""
""
"O: not a bad beer by any means. But I don't know why this has an A. It is barely different from a Peroni in my opinion. Still a great beer though. Never had a Helle's lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Perfect lager. Better be perfect if it's been brewed for over one thousand years. Seriously though, what a badass beer. Pours hazy yellow/orange, with a nice frothy head that never goes away and decorates the sides of your glass as you drink it. Obviously an extremely meticulously crafted beer all the way through, the definition of well balanced. Hop profile that will leave you craving more."

"Overall - Does a helles get any better then this? Smooth, balanced, flavorful and very enjoyable. World class and a must try not only for the style, but because its a wonderful beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer looks amazing in the sunlight. Not much for a head but the beer is crystal clear and gold in color. The amazing part is the perfectly visible rising strings of bubbles. Aroma is full of crisp crackery grains and doughy bread. Zesty, floral, and spicy with perfect, slightly sweetned lemon. Next is taste. Flavors are an excellent reprise of the aroma. Crisp and dry crackers, a kiss of lemon, delicious deep and perky spice, some kind of almost herbal floral... Awesome beer right here. Super dry and grainy feel as well as chewy. Faaaantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I can't iterate how much better this is than all those other lagers, be it domestic or imports that just can't even hold a candle to this. Simply put, those other beers are chop meat; this is Filet Mignon."
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: With a big meal I could drink and drink this without hesitation. A very drinkable lager, and just right in regards to aroma and taste - constantly interesting and full of flavor, but not overpowering or palate tiring. Clearly this beer was finely engineered to be drank in mass quantities with pleasure. Well done!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My vote for what should be in the dictionary when you look up ""beer""."
""
""
"O: This is a fantastic light beer. It is easy to drink, and unlike most ""light"" beers, it holds a good amount of flavor. It is the kind of beer that you absolutely love to sit back and drink, and look forward to the next time you get to have one."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Surprisingly delicious brew. Simple of course, but great balance, mouthfeel and drinkability. People talk about AALs being perfect lawnmower beers, but this is my style right here along with witbiers and hefes."
""
""
""
"Original pours a golden color with a nice large lacing head. There is a grainy aroma, that is pail. The taste is grainy as well, overly sweet. A little too much carbonation, taste isn't the best and strange sweet aftertaste that is stuck to your palette. Overall its not the worst, but too sweet, and carbonated, reminds me of a ""grain soda."""
"Overall: As light a lager as this should be, I do feel it's lacking a bit of character. I think what really abets this aspect is the slightly watery mouthfeel, which detracts from the taste. I do feel, however, that this is an excellent example of this traditional style."
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is excellent. Giant head, effervescence is pervasive, tons o' lacing. Nose is hay, grass, and traditional bready components. Well-balanced light combination of bread and lemon citrus. Overall, this is a great quaff."
""
""
"overall; will buy this maybe once in every three or four beer hauls. (which is a lot for someone who tends to constantly mix it up) this beer is appealing to all types of beer drinkers i have come across, and is incredible for not just for a lager but for a beer of any kind."
""
"O: Not my typical style but I was really digging this one. Super clean and easy drinking. Great price on these considering I got a tall boy for 2.99. Grab a few tall boys and you can make quite the session with these."
""
""
"O: Well-balanced in terms of flavor, aroma, and feel. Not my favorite style, but a seriously fine example of a German lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On the heavier side of being light bodied with crisp carbonation but feels nice and full in the mouth while remaining extremely smooth. Sweet dry biscuity malts followed by herbal hops, finishes balanced with some lingering sweetness, goes back like water with some good flavor. Nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"this is textbook, exactly what this style should taste like! it pours a very light clear honey color, with an inch or so of lasting snow white head and jovial carbonation. the nose is less banana and clove than the others, but still there to some small extent, with soft and semisweet malts being balanced by a hopping only an old world german brewery could execute, this is the art of balance ladies and gentlemen. very mild flavor, grains first, bittering hops second, with the yeast sort of uniting both camps in a harmonious mixture of german purity and tradition. the yeast has some soapy complexion to it, and a touch of acidity, maybe citrus, to cut the malt sweetness. an impressive offering by any stretch, but the drinkability here is unrivaled. so clean and bright, perfect carbonation, expertly refreshing, and you cannot beat the price!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good brew for a hot day. The super clean, dry flavor and lively mouthfeel makes this very refreshing, despite the disappointing nose. A good, solid brew for refreshment, but not much else."

""
""

"Probably would be better on tap"
""
""
"Overall- Above average but I really need to try another example. If I am reading the bottle code correctly, this beer is almost a year old. Still, a fairly good beer in its degraded condition."
""
""
""
"Transparent light straw colored ale with a thick, white head. Great retention and lots of lace lines. Crisp herbal aroma with some fresh grains and grass thrown in. Bready malt character in the flavor with rice and corn. Very well balanced with an herbal, grassy hop bitterness. Hint of garlic. Finish is crisp with lingering hop spice. Light bodied. Lots of bubbles. Highly refreshing. A tasty German lager which I could thoroughly enjoy year-round."
"O - Ridiculously drinkable beer, with perhaps a little more sweetness then I would expect and prefer. I want to give it higher rankings based on the others I've had from this brewery, and while it is tasty, there are many other options (from this brewery and others) that I would prefer."
""
""
""

"Overall every beer I picked up by these guys has been amazing. Will have to track down their Festbier next. Worth the price tasty and smoother than water."
""
"O: Man, this is the lager of lagers. It's usually not really my style of choice, but I could see myself ordering this again on a rare occasion. Crisp, clean flavors mixed with an exceptionally smooth feel make this one of the most pleasant lagers to be had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Been reading about about Helles lagers over the last few days. This is a great example, and really a lovely, delightfully refreshing beer. Not my favorite style, but so good to have once in a while, and great for a session or on a hot day after mowing the lawn."
"O - This is a great and inexpensive lager. I don't quite buy into the hype, nor do I put it up there with their Hefe-Weissbier. However, this is a very solid beer for an easier drinking choice, either for a session beer or for a hot day outdoors. Much easier to drink than a Weissbier."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For my first review, I'll write up one of my favorite warm weather beers. This is a perfect lager, one of the best I've ever had. Light floral nose with honey notes. Delicious, full mouth feel and crisp refreshing flavor, honey, honey. Sweet without being cloying, one sip begats another until its all gone. Love this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"High drinkability, distinct grassiness, crisp flavor. A wonderful session beer. One of my favorite lagers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Quite disappointed. This brew comes nowhere near my 4-5 favorite (as of now) Helles lagers. A very average beer without much going for it. Wouldn't mind trying this on tap, but I doubt I'll ever buy a bottle again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On a sad side note, I offered one of these to a friend, who tasted it and said ""Wow thats good, tastes just like Miller High Life."" I just stared at him."
""
""
"This is one of the best pale brews I've had. It is immensely refreshing; a hybrid of a lager and a pils. The lemon in the smell is the first on the scene, followed by the biscuits. It is the same with the taste, except the lemon dominates most of it. You could drink this every day, but mostly on warmer days; actually, it's just as excellent on cold days. I would definitely get this again."

"No kidding, Weihenstephan does it again. I'm beginning to think that they can do no wrong, as there isn't a beer by them that I've tried and haven't liked. I'm starting to grow more fond of the Helles Lager style, and this is a good place to start for anyone who is venturing in that direction, as well. Can't say I like this one as much as Schlenkerla's helles lager (it's that smoke, baby), but it's still damn good and oh so insanely drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"After years of drinking Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier, I finally got around to trying Weihenstephaner Original, and I am glad that I did. It was immensely refreshing and surprisingly full flavored. This would be a perfect warm weather beer."
""
"I am not a big lager fan in general, but this is a delightful beer. Shows you what a traditional munich hells is suppsosed to be! Very nice, I would try it again."
""
""

"RJT"
""
""
""
"O: Wow, a pale lager that I actually enjoyed. Very mild and friendly tasting."
"This is surely drinkable but entirely ordinary, and nowhere near the league of Weihenstephaner's vastly superior offerings. I find it odd that the brewery's ""original"" brew is by far its most average, but most things would seem that way compared to their weissbiers."

"O: Perfect summer thirst quencher & I can see why this is considered a textbook example of a classic Munich Helles Lager. Good stuff."

""

"I'm new to beer, so I'm still developing my palate and finding out what I like. This beer is absolutely exceptional. Very smooth and delicious. You experience just a hint of sweetness at the first sip before the bitter flavors kick in. It is very balanced and nota at all overwhelming. I really enjoyed it and will definitely buy again."

"Bros: Be more critical so there's actually a reliable rating. And i'm not referring to this beer, but pretty much any review has 90+. You even communicate beer karma rules - so might be worthwhile to consider this yourself as well. Be more detailed in the rating is all i'm saying. 100 means it's perfect. And what's the benchmark? My benchmark is i've never had the perfect beer - so 100 is pretty much impossible, unless i really feel like heaven drinking a beer. This beer made you feel in heaven? You can like it, don't mind me, but be realistic ..."

"Overall: Pretty solid beer and now I know it is considered one of the best within this style. Awesome beer to enjoy with dinner."

"Pours a crisp, clear straw golden color with a large foamy white head. Nose is bready and floral, with grass, straw, light citrus and dough. Crisp body, with a doughy grain flavor and a light grassy lemon citrus finish."

"Overall, not a bad beer at all! I strongly endorse this one. This is the kind of beer you want on a summer afternoon."
""
""

"Not a bad beer, I guess my first of the kind, although it reminded me more of a light lager than anything else. Weihenstephaner is just so good. I’m 3-for-3 now with two more to drink in my fridge."

"The beer pours a slightly hazy lightly-pinkish yellow, much like slightly cloudy piss. The head is massive and beautifully stark white, with a creamy tight texture and tinny little bubbles. Carbonation appears moderate in the body of the beer, which is the faintest bit hazy, but truthfully quite clear. Lacing is in thin sticky sheets that run little lines across the glass. On the nose, the beer smells sweet and spicy, much like a Czech pilsner. Sweet sticky grain malt mixes with spicy grassy hops to tantalize the nose with varying layers. Slight caramel and biscuit can also be detected in the malt, and faint citrus plays alongside the spices. The beer tastes wonderfully bready with light spices from the hops. On the opening sip the spices tingle slightly at the beginning alongside a steadily growing bready flavor which eventually explodes in the middle of the taste, drowning out the hops momentarily with its creamy biscuit qualities before mellowing light citrus and hay with spicy zest and a faint lingering taste of biscuit. On the tongue, the beer is crisp and bubbly, though not too much so. The beers holds properly thin and drinkable in the mouth and it leaves the mouth quite clean with light droplets of saliva on the tongue. Overall the beer is quite refreshing and drinkable, with some nice malty complexity, although I do wish more of the spicy hops were able to transfer over from the smell to the flavor. A terrific Munich Helles with some nice flavor to rest alongside the easy drinkability, and a great start to my Weihenstephan experience."

"A classic German beer that is a definite session beer and a very above average (yet still basic) lager. It’s quite easy to drink, readily available and inexpensive – a winning combo and a solid overall beer that basically set the style guidelines."
"I get a lot more of the nuttiness as it warms. No wonder Germans like ""warm"" beer! This one is good. I'll have to keep an eye out for it next time I go to a German restaurant."

"Poured into a glass mug. Pours pale golden with a tall, white head and plentiful visible tiny bubbles. The head retreats, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. This is the typical helles lager smell. There's the bready and biscuit type malt with some grassy hops. The taste absolutely follows the nose. There's a solid malt profile here that has some biscuit notes. The noble hops add some grassy and spicy notes. The taste absolutely follows the nose. There's a solid malt profile here that has some biscuit notes. The noble hops add some grassy and spicy notes. This is an excellent beer."
"O: This is king of the Helles as far as I'm concerned. There is no flaw in this beer. A simple but pleasing style executed to perfection. It appalls me that this sits on the shelf. Put down your harpoons and halt the whale hunt long enough to drink and appreciate the truly great beers that are regularly at your disposal."
"Lots of foam that is quite persistent overtime. Appereance and aroma what is expected from a Munich Helles Lager. Light body with good carbonation. Flavor of malt and raw grains, which keeps constant without any unwanted mutation. High drinkability, actually as high as it gets."
""
"Food match: You could almost make a sandwich with the bold bread flavours in this brew, or in the least forego the slice of bread at meal time. German food is an obvious choice of course. Quiche would also pair well."

"O: Extremely drinkable. My new favorite Munich Helles Lager."
"Served from bottle into a sampler shaker. Poured a pale golden yellow with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, spice, and wheat. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, spice, and wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. I was really quite impressed with what I found going on in this one for the style. It was very refreshing and inviting for the palate. This fact made it extremely easy to drink and I could see this one being enjoyed in fairly larger quantities without too much trouble. A solid offering from this brewery that I would not hesitate to suggest to anyone out there."

"Overall, delicious and good for you."

"Overall - The prototypical German lager. Not too big. Easy drinking. Delicious. It's a shame Budweiser doesn't taste like this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I wonder what this would be like fresh--it has all of the makings of a wonderfully subtle and refreshing lager."
""
""
"Body is medium-light to light, with spritzy, lightly tingly carbonation. This results in a crisp, slightly foamy, flowing mouthfeel: the beer never lasts too long on the palate. Hops are noticeable in the spiciness they provide to the mouthfeel. Finish is semi-dry."
""
"This beer pours up a crystal clear pale amber with about two fingers worth of head and a little bit of lacing. The nose is bread, earthiness, and sweet apples. Mouthfeel is close to perfect with just the right amount of carbonation. Taste is fairly mild, but complex just the same. An understated sweetness giving way to an understated bitterness on the finish and no lingering aftertaste. I've had this bottle for a couple of months and just kept passing it over. It is easily one of the finest offering I have tasted as of late."

"Overall: It's definitely overshadowed by other Weihenstephaner beers, but this is a very good Helles lager. Worth checking out. I go on German kicks occasionally and I'll be back for this beer the next time I crave something German."

"Overall: nice and refreshing, though probably my least favorite weihenstephaner"
""
""
"The world-renowed Weihenstephaner Hef has a tendency to overshadow the other beers from this brewery and that's a shame, because there are some other good ones in their catalog. The Original is one of them, decidedly more rich than their pilsener and one of the best overall lagers I've tried. The beer has great clarity and perfectly pure taste. Try one!"

""
"O: Delicious. would buy this any day, especially a beach or pool day. refreshing"
""
"For all the praise as a classic German beer, it tastes like another dull lager in my experience with it on tap at Pizza Port in OB. I really like their wheat beers, so I might try this again but in the bottle."
""
"This is a well put together, quaffable beer. It has enough flavor to keep you interested, it's perfectly to style, and it's very refreshing. I'll definitely give this a go again."

"A classic and beautifully crafted German lager and an easy drinking, quenching choice on a hot summer day. Superb session brew too. This defines the Helles style."
""
""
"O- A very fine lager from Germany. I'd love to try this one fresh. Even skunked its incredible."
"The Weheinstephaner is an excellent example of a helles lager. The Augustiner is still my favorite (though I haven't had it in a while), but the Weheinstephaner has that perfect, light, bready German flavor, and that clean, lightly bitter taste that balances perfectly but, like the selfless working-man's beer it is, doesn't linger too long, because it understands that you have places to be and things to do. It is a fizzy yellow beer, yes, but it German lagers are the paradigms of all fizzy yellow beers, and this one still has a nice, creamy head and light lacing down the glass that belies a beer with much more class and style than Americans expect from fizzy yellow beers. If all your friends could be exemplified in fizzy yellow beers, then the helles lager is your well-dressed European friend who's a very nice guy and tends to pick up surprisingly attractive women. And it smells like the south of Germany. It smells like a great vacation. It smells like summertime."
"Overall - I'm not big on lagers, but this one is fantastic. Reminiscent of Heineken, only much, much better."

"O: A classic. This would definitely appeal to the non-craft crowd and might help steer them into the light. Easy to drink, affordable (especially for an import), and is fairly simplistic. A must-try for all those lager-lovers"

"O: It take a lot to impress me with a lager and this one certainly does. Not only excellent for style but just a plain excellent beer."
"o - Overall I thought this was a very well made helles lager. Not traditionally a style I'm crazy about, this is one of the better ones I've had. Some nice Belgian notes mixing with floral and citrus, and super easy to drink. Would certainly have it again, and could see it being a great summer night beer."

"O: I am not generally a lager guy, but this was terrific. The numbers I gave this do not necessarily reflect how much I actually enjoyed this beer. This is very easy to drink and very tasty, and since it is reasonably priced, it is very sessionable. I see myself drinking much more of this in the future."
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy light yellow with a 1 inch foamy eggshell color head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Very thin foamy rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt/grain and some grape-like fruity aromas. Taste is of malt/grain, white grape juice, and some other fruity flavors. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a crisp mouthfeel with a bubbly quality. Overall, this is a very tasty and crisp lager that is very easy to drink. Much different from the other beers Weihenstephan offers but a good choice nonetheless."

"500 ml bottle into pilsener glass, bottled 7/27/2011. Pours slightly cloudy golden straw color with a nice fluffy 2-3 finger white head with fantastic retention that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice soapy lacing down the glass as you drink; with plenty of carbonation streaming up from the bottom. Aromas of lemon, cracker, black pepper, apricot, herbal, grass, and bready grains. Very nice, clean, and balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of biscuit, herbal, lemon, pepper, grass, and bready grains. Fairly dry on the finish as expected; with slight lingering notes of lemon, bread, grass, and pepper on the finish for a bit. Great balance of flavors. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium bodied; with an extremely crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Very drinkable, with no alcohol noticed at all as expected. Overall this is an excellent Helles lager. Plenty of well balanced flavor and easy drinking."

""
""
"O- You don't survive as the oldest brewery in the world if you can't make a good beer. Thankfully they make great beers."

"Appearance is a crystal clear pale straw color with a large eggshell head. Scent is mainly doughy biscuit, with a bit of lemon and grass - strong and perfect for the style. Taste is high on grain, with a slight nuttiness and even slighter citrus. Thin mouthfeel. Crisp, clean, refreshing, and light-bodied."
"O - Tremendous beer on draft. Very different than drink from their bottle. I would love to have this after mowing the lawn on a hot summer day."
"Excellent mouthfeel! Sets the bar VERY high- exceptionally light bodied with more than moderate carbonation. Refreshing and tingly. Great beer- I'd love to have it on tap in Germany though... I""m sure there's a lot that we Americans are missing."
"Pours a clean deep yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, a small gingerbread like malt and not much of anything really. In the taste, a gingerbread like malt and a note of lemon citrus. A smooth and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry gingerbread like malt and a note of citrus in the aftertaste. A mix of malt and lemon citrus, eh!"

"The color was a very nice golden clean and active blonde like a good lager,the head was a bit flat,and the lacing was lacking. The smell was a very nice bready,sweet malty odor. The tase was that as well,but a tad bitter at the end. Still very good ,just not quite as balanced to me as a samuel smith or even a paulaner,I did love this beer,however."
"All 4's...."

"O. I'm generally an ale drinker, brought up on English bitter, and lagers don't often find their way into my fridge. This is one that does. It's an excellent example of the style; clean, refreshing, full of all the right flavours."
"Overall- I might have received a bad batch of this or something but haven't gotten back around to it. Definitely not my style but I'm sure if its good enough for the Bro's its good enough for others."
"Pours a golden yellow color with a half finger white head, which quickly disappears. Extremely clear and clean looking brew- very easy to see through. Decent lacing on my glass as well. The nose is grass, lemon, mild hops, and a little bit of malt. Very pleasant, and clean. The taste follows the same suit, and has a nice mild sweetness to it. The feel is well carbonated, medium bodied, and has a clean, sweet finish. Overall, a nice refreshing beer. Cheers."

"O- I was very surprised with this brew. Lagers aren't normally my cup of tea but this would be an excellent introduction to a newbie drinker. So much better than the main stream lagers out there. It actually has taste, and is well balanced. And at just over 5%, it's also a great session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"While I am always trying new and different crafts, this is one to stay in the fridge all the time."
"I didn't particularly care for this brew, simply because I have grown away from many lagers, but if I ever want an excellent German lager you can be sure I'll pick up some more!"
""
"The body is a bit more full and rounded than it looks. Once the carbonation subsides, it invites huge thirst-quenching gulps. Nice Beer! Very nice!"
"Compliments the spicy BBQ and slaw I've been enjoying; mothfeel enhances the spices from the sauce nicely. It's been a minute since I've had a nice lager, but I'd call it a pale lager paradigm."
"O: Super easy drinking and a great example of a helles."
""
"This is a simple straightforward enjoyable lawnmower beer with good malt flavor. Very drinkable. Classic helles example. I really enjoyed this beer and would have it again."
""
""
""
""
"It has a medium bodied, refreshingly clean taste. The beer is evenly balanced with a gentle burnt corn and hop finish. I don't get a lot of depth in this, just a real smooth, highly drinkable lager that I thoroughly enjoyed trying. This is one of the better helles lagers I've had."
"The mouthfeel is light with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a very good beer of the style. Nicely flavored and well balanced."
""
""
"O: This fits the style of a Munich Helles Lager quite nicely. I never really was a fan of this style, but with the grassiness that this gives it's quite beautiful. I love nature in my drinks: oak, pine, and grass. This will be something that I will like if I could find it in large quantities."
""
""
"O: This should be a nice light quaffer. Instead I'm sitting here sipping it slowly- it's just that complex and enjoyable. And this is during December- I can't wait for summer to get here; I'll buy it by the case."

"As I've gotten older, my palette has turned a little bit more towards pilsners and pale lagers. I don't know yet where this one ranks among its brethren....but it's way up there. A beautiful beer."

"O- It's a pretty good beer. It's a mild flavor hitter just because of the style, but you could drink the snot out of these. Gimme a nice beer garden, pretzels and I'm good to go here"
"O-this is a fantastic beer. its not an extremely flavorful beer, but what it lacks in flavor, it makes up for in overall drinkability and quality. i wish this type of beer could be found in 6-packs and on tap all over. its a great go-to beer."
"O - This is a very clean and well-made Helles. It is not my favorite style, but this is clearly an excellent example."

"Great beer, lots of flavor. I could drown in a vat of this and die happy."
"O: I'm not the biggest lager fan but this beer gets the job done beautifully. This beer is light enough and very drinkable which is why it can be paired with a lot of foods and enjoyed at pretty much any time. Another quality product from Bayerische Weihenstephan."
"I don't care much for the style, but I could probably be swayed if I drank more beers like this one."
"O - Pretty basic, but it's a lager isn't it. Nothing big or bold about this, but very sessionable."
"D: Easy to drink and quite tasty. The best lager I've tasted to date."
"O - A true, well rounded, classic German drinking brew."
"Pours a pale golden yellow color with a thick filmy white head that clung to the glass. I could smell lemon peel and grassy hops, it's kind of tart and sour. Tastes of hay and lemon with a nice malt flavor, with a mild metallic hint. The beer is very smooth and low in carbonation with a dry finish. This beer is really good and I could drink it all day."
"As far as I'm concerned, the wonderful folks at Weihenstephaner can do no wrong. Bravo!"
"Very good beer. I could drink a lot of these and I'm an IPA guy. Respect!"
"Overall: Good beer overall. The aroma and flavor are up there with any pilsner I've had. Weihenstephaner never disappoints."
"I love their hefe so I'm excited to try the lager (although not my favorite style). This pours a clear light yellow / straw color with a nice foamy white head. The smell is very clean and crisp, I get lots of floral hops, a little grain, not bad. Feel is medium with moderate carbonation. The taste is pretty good also very crisp and slightly dry, it has some grainy malts up front with a nice hop balance. Overall, this was pretty good, but I'll stick to the far superior and more flavorful hefe."
"O - Overall I enjoyed this beer alot. Weihenstephan really doesnt make a bad beer, everything is quality. Would buy again."
"O: An excellent if delicately-flavored lager that is easy-drinking and refreshing. Too light and too close to ordinary to be very interesting."
"A very flavourful lager - bright is indeed a good way to describe it. I could see putting back these easily - stein after stein."
"This one pours a light bodied vibrant gold in color with great clarity and a two finger bright white, sudsy head. The aromas consist of a light pilsner esque malt, light honey like sweetness, with a very light bitter hop finish. The flavors are spot on for a Munich blonde. It has nice pale malty sweetness with a touch of honey and an ever so slight, dry and hoppy finish. The finish is nice and smooth and overall refreshing. The flavor reminds me of fresh a Hofbrau Munich Helles from the Hofbrau House. This bottle drinks exceptionally fresh and crisp. This is a top notch beer for the style and a great beer for a hot day. If this were America's national style I doubt too many people would complain."
"O - Overall I am not a fan. Big disappointment from such a brilliant brewery."
"My pour created almost two fingers of foamy, bone-white head with good retention. Color was a lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a pleasant grassy, Saaz hops odor underlain by a biscuit maltiness. My mouth began to water in anticipation. Mouthfeel was medium with a clean, lightly grassy bitterness on the tongue. I really love drinking adjunct-free lager, especially after so many AALs on The CANQuest (TM). My FerMentor, Lew Bryson, has described lagers as the equvalent of frozen tundra with nothing to hide behind. That would sum up this beer. It was slightly dry on the finish, refreshing and very pleasant. Now, if they would just put it in a CAN ..."
"O: Well-balanced, complex, mature in its flavor profile, and easy-drinking, this is a beer that I’ll definitely have again; especially if I ever make it to Germany, where I can have it fresh. Two offerings this good make me want to go nuts and get every beer this brewery makes; so that’s what I’ll do! More Weihenstephaner reviews to come – these guys are just too good to be overlooked."
"O- Interestingly enough, the label classifies this as a Malt Liquor. This is far and above the best malt liquor I've had! Haha.. No, but seriously, this a great, refreshing German lager that is a great beer for a hot summers day (117 degrees heat index today) or a good session."
"O - No doubt about this being a German Lager"
"Biscuity, bready malts. Like fresh baked bread, creamy mouthfeel, light ant refreshing zesty carbonation. Moderate bitterness dries out the sweetness of the malt on the finish. Some toffee hints, floral, and a bit spicey in the middle."
"Overall a very nice pils. Spaten is still my fav."
"Overall, this is really good. This is a super refreshing and thirst qunecher"
"A very elegant and sophisticated beer that focus on the malt and yeast."
"Drink- A german classic and tasty but not my fav style. Glad I reviewed on tap. Tasty but not for me in the future"
"This is the best beer your money can buy. 9.99 a six pack is a deal of a lifetime for such a fine beer. Enjoy this beer regularly and keep them producing this. For the price nothing can or will ever match this in style or expertise! Highest recommendation. I just wish I could find this on tap in Bowling Green, KY."
"Overall-Good beer. Very drinkable, sessionable. Could drink a 6 pack very often."
"D-Very easy drinking, but a little too simple and understated for my taste."
"Notes: A quality, well made lager. A little bit watery but no other imperfections. Lacks the wow factor of Spaten but decent,nonetheless."
"A nice aromatic and refreshing lager. Tasted at a blind sampling."
"Overall, this is really good. This is a super refreshing and thirst quenching lager, the best I've had in a while."
"O: Hands down my favorite Helles I have ever had. I love the style and I will regularly purchase this when available. must try"
"Wouldnt go out of my way to get it again, but would never turn it down either."
"In all, the original is just another solid and delicious beer from possibly Germany’s best brewery. I think I could enjoy this beer in nearly any situation."
"Mouthfeel is crisp, clean and satisfying. Another Bavarian classic--this Munich Helles Lager is fantastic. I have a hard time seeing how you can improve upon this offering in this category."
"Very solid lager here. There's a nice balance between the malt and the noble hops that makes this quite drinkable and enjoyable. I'd drink this anytime. Recommended."
"This beer is a golden yellow with a large amount of carbonation rising up through the glass. A thin layer of head that curtains the sides of the glass. The nose contains a lot of straw and a spicy hint of hops. The taste is very crisp and smooth. A solid amount of carbonation tingle as well. The flavor is light but dynamic. The straw is present right off the bat but it has a light honey/lemon zest with a balance of a light amount of hop pepper. The aftertaste is malty and sweet. Great beer on a warm spring day."
"Overall: A solid helles from ""The World's Oldest Brewery."" I would definitely recommend and definitely go back to again!"
"If you are a Helles Lager fan, this is a prime example along with Lowenbrau Original. Absolutely fantastic beers."
"Extra points given for the really clean taste, but it may be a bit too clean, I was hoping for more flavor. Still, it wouldn't be a chore to down a few of these."
"Cheers!"
"O: A delightful beer to drink. Makes me jealous that this and beer like this are the NORM in Europe as opposed to the standard offering at bars around here. This, along with the Hefe have made me into a Weihenstephaner fanboy and I don't see myself turning back."
"O- Overall this is a very nice beer and a premium example of the style."
"Delicious, crisp, refreshing would be the best way to describe this lager taste-wise. Hands down one of the finest lagers I have had the chance to enjoy. Definitely worth a try and comes highly recommended."
"O- This beer does deserve its high marks. A perfect German Helles IMHO."
"I won't get it often but will enjoy it when I do."
"This was a delicious beer. Immediately you taste the wheat followed by a malty character that lingers for just the right amount of time. This is an exceptional lager from a treasured brewery. I have not had a Weihenstephaner that I have not loved. I highly recommend the beer as a classic example of a German lager."
"overall - this is a really nice beverage, this tastes like a really refined lager that other breweries should strive for"
"How can you not like this? Great with or without food. Easy to drink, great lingering flavors. Good for any season. This is going to be great when I get the grill going this year. An absolute return to this."
"Pours a light golden yellow with a big two-finger bright white head. Looks like a BMC commercial. Awesome lacing and head retention. Nice subtle aroma. Yeasty and grassy with a bit of lemon. Extremely crisp and refreshing. Light crisp hops start it off. Follow the nose, grassy and a bit of lemon Mix well with a bready and yeasty middle and a pale malt to close. Just very crisp, well put together and refreshing. Great representation of the style."
"An example of an easy-drinking lager done right."
"Pours a nice golden color with a tall white head and visible carbonation throughout. Good retention and lacing and a solid cap as it goes down. The nose is mostly bread with some light graininess in the background and some faint Noble hops. The flavor falls along the same lines with the breadiness of the nose constituting the main flavor, fading into a bit of hop bitterness in the finish. Light body with good carbonation. Quite drinkable."
"Final Notes: The holy grail of Light Lagers. Big malty flavor, a bit of hops to even it out. What more could you ask for?"
"Poured from a bottle, it looks bright gold, has plenty of carbonation, and forms a good head. Smells great - pretty aromatic for a lager. Tastes outstanding, similar in ways to Hofbräu. This is certainly a beer you can drink heartily - classic style for a Bavarian lager, perhaps easy for some brewers to equal, but certainly hard to beat. I will definitely get this again."
"D: Absolutely fantastic. This is a great brew to show to people who don't think they like good beer. I highly recommend this to all who are seeking to dip into the land of lagers, as it is a full flavored version of the crap-lagers most of us grew up drinking. Actually, I will shorten that to, ""I highly recommend this to all."""
"Drinkability - For a lager, a very good beer. Perhaps one of the best. Had to remind myself to rate within the style."
"The mouthfeel is absolutely perfect. It goes down full-bodied yet absurdly delicately and dries the mouth a perfect amount for the hop zing this one has. The drinkability is also very good, there's absolutely no issues drinking this. A superb, time-tested lager that's absolutely worth your time. Highly recommended."
"Overall, although the Hefeweissbier gets most of the acclaim, this brewery is certainly no one-trick pony. Although the first impression isn't overly impressive, this is a terrific beer that I would gladly order again and again."
"Not a life changing beer, but pretty good"
"T: Looks light but doesn't taste it. Fantastic German taste. Nice, smooth malts and then a snap of grassy hops followed by a smooth malty finish. A great German beer."
"Drinkability: Light, quaffable, sweet, not light on the lips, a delicious drink to sip on or to drink up."
"drinkability; a very drinkable and tasty beer, no need for elaborate flavors, just simple flavors in a clear and pure format."
"A really great beer, and something I could drink on any day!"
"I'm making this disappear quickly, even on a winter night. I figured I'd finally review a classic and it does not disappoint. I've been to Munich, but before my beer awakening and therefore did not sample this at the source. If I'm ever there again I may drown in it."
"An excellent Helles. Not as dry as a Pils but fuller in a way, and very drinkable."
"Pours into a pint glass a light golden color, almost like lemonade, with a large bright white head that leaves lacing all over the glass. The nose is bready with a bit of lemon and spice. The taste is similar with a metallic tinge to it. Very easy to drink. I'm not a huge lager fan but this beer is great, subtle and flavorful, very complex but easy to drink. Definitely worth a try, a great beer to keep around the house, especially in the summer."
"Everything about this appears textbook: pale, yellowish-straw-colored with a slight haze, topped with a beautifully creamy, moderately dense white head. A grainy aroma, reminiscent of white toast, jumps out amidst a light sweet malt base with an essence of shrubby noble hops. Very inviting. With a quite malt-forward taste, it drinks creamy smooth and decidedly full-bodied for the style - cereal grains with a touch of honey sweetness highlight what's essentially a uber-malty pilsner flavor. Brawny and hearty, surprisingly filling yet refreshing."
"Pours a pale yellow with a thin white head. A hint of blue-green it is so light. Smells of generic Euro-lager. Taste is nice lager yeast up front, followed by a smooth grain middle, but the finish is lifeless, and there is a very poor amount of bitterness here, even for the style. Mouthfeel is average, average carbonation. Drinkability is good, its a pretty light and refreshing beer, but it is quite a disappointment in comparison to the other Weihenstephaner beers I have had."
"D: Highly drinkable. I found this one very thirst-quenching. Very refreshing and a nice brew for a lazy spring day. Very crisp."
"This tastes like a generic malty Euro lager to me. At least it doesn't smell like one. Sorry."
"D: As I neared the end of my glass, this beer's sweetness did begin to weigh on me a bit, so I don't think I would be able to fully enjoy two in a row. Definitely worth a try though, and I'm sure I'll be returning to this in the summer months."
"This is a quintessential beer of beers. Very smooth in the mouth, the ample carbonation melds hops and grain into a mellow, traditional lager. Dry, with a slightly fruity tang, it can be drunk just for the pleasure of experiencing a classic brew, or it can easily accompany any meat & potatoes type dish, from pretzels to pork chops. A lager of this caliber enhances the flavor of food without overpowering it."
"Very pleasant beer - not my cup of tea typically but it makes for a very nice change once in a while - this would be excellent in the summer."
"So easy to drink. A must have for lovers of this style."
"Weihenstephaner has had hundreds of years to perfect this recipe and it shows. All the beers they make are phenomenal, but everything other than the Hefe goes unnoticed. This pours a mildly cloudy golden color with a tall white head that has good retention. Carbonation is visible floating up through my glass. The smell is as potent as other beers, but this beer still smells delightful. I caught a whiff of sweet grain, a little bit of apple or citrus as well as some hops. The fruity smell is less emphasized in the taste as what really comes through strong is the well balanced hop and malt blend. The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, and drinkability is off the charts. Another near-perfect creation from Weihenstephaner."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light pilsner and Vienna malt scent that's sweet with a dry nuttiness. The hops provide a faint aroma that really rounds out the nose. The taste is good as well. It has a light pilsner malt flavor that goes down easy and lays a solid foundation for an excellent hop bitterness and flavor. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer. It's and easy drinking with good hop character."
"D: This is quite flavorful and I can't get over the beauty of this beer."
"D: Very drinkable lager, a great session beer."
"this was a great beer and should be tried by anyone"
"Drinkability: This is a very pleasant drink, if not a challenge. It pairs well with just about anything, and is eminently sessionable."
"This is acceptable beer but I don't for the life of me see why it scores A's. Poured a huge head which dissipated to nothing. Fairly standard straw color and fairly typical mild taste. There indeed are some bitter hops but nothing special. I'm hoping some of their other labels impress me more."
"D: You cant beat a good Helles. It is just about impossible."
"Overall: This is a relatively simple beer, but that is what's so excellent about it. It is Reinheitsgebot beer in its purest form, and because of the simplicity you can really pick out the flavors in it nicely...in many ways, this just tastes like the ""daily bread"" of beers. This beer is very drinkable and would pair handsomely with a big yeasty pretzel or bratwurst in a big Bavarian biergarten."
"By the way, the bottle I had was labelled 'Original Bayrisch Mild' and I'm assuming this is the same beer."
"On second thought talk about a good way to wing someone from macro lagers. Shows that a lager can have character and some flavor. At the same time the beer doesn't have so much flavor or power that it could cause anyone an issue."
"I would happily buy this again, I'm currently loving every sip of it. This is perfect as I sit here typing up a report for class drinking a worthy beer. A true heffe."
"The flavors may be simple, but this is a nearly perfect lager and a nother example of what makes Weihenstephaner so amazing. It looks great, it smells wonderful, the flavor is simple but very balanced, perfect mouthfeel and I want to drink it all night. What else can you ask for?"
"Drinkability: extremely drinkable. This beer isn't perfect, but it is definitely quaffable and fulfilling."
"Oh definitely an easy beer to drink and enjoy. This is the type of beer you'd drink at any occasion. Want to impress? Check. Want to have fun and drink a solid beer. Check mate."
"What a lovely yet delicate lager, an underrated as well as overlooked beer, as the spotlight usually shines on its wheat beer brother. No frills and fits with the style. An ease to quaff back a half liter (or a full liter, for the more ardent lager lover)."
" i had no problem enjoying this, a real classic in style and longevity!"
"Nice flavors but a little weak compared to many other beers I've been drinking lately. Excellent lawnmower beer or bbq/grill-out beer when your friends come over to hang out -- something to get them to stop wasting their money on Bud Light. Good for what it is. Glug glug glug!"
"D: I could throw these back all afternoon and evening, preferably in a one liter stein. If you're looking for a good German lager, start here."
"Drinkability is excellent, better than most other lagers I've tried. It's a simple, but very well done brew that exemplifies the style and quality I've come to expect from Weihenstephan. Definitely my lager of choice going forward."
"Pours with a straw coolor and with a thick fluffy head that stays with the beer. Overall smell is floral and grainy, very delightful. This beer has one of the crispest hop bites of any helles I have had. Very potenet saaz hops are complimented by a rich pilsner malt that possesses a noce clean taste that has some grassy notes. Mouthfeel is drying yet pleasant and it puts a smile on your face making you long for more. This is a gold standard for this style."
"BTW, neck label says ""Original"" the main label says "" Original Premium"" I don't know if there is a separate product or not."
"I find the smell and taste hard to rate... kudos for a bit of skunk, but *bleh* for way way too much."
"Drinkability is very good, as with most lagers. Though I do not feel this particular beer is all that unique enough for me to buy again. Definitely a good german lager, however."
"Pours a clear bright gold with a short lived white head. Aromas are almost all of Pils malt - pleasantly sweet and grainy. Tastes great. The flavors are fairly simple, sweet, clean Pils malt and light graininess dominate the flavors but do not overwhelm the palate. Light, grassy hops provide restraint to the sweetness and refreshment to the palate. Finishes mostly clean with a light sweetness lingering. Medium-light body is perfectly weighted and is perhaps the most perfectly carbonated Helles lager I've ever had. It ""feels"" just right. This simple beer is exceptionally well crafted."
"I'm still getting used to pale lagers that don't taste like butt."
"D: Good and drinkable. Pleasant, repeatable, but not amazing."
"Also my first of beer of this style. I'm glad I enjoyed it. Also happened to be one of the better beers for a hot, humid New England night in mid-August."
"Overall one of the best, and easily the most solid lagers you could ask for. Easily accessible and deserved of a place in everyone's fridge."
"It's from Weihenstephan, need more be said? Highly recommended!"
"Seems pricey for what it is, but I guess when you travel halfway around the world, the freight costs add up."
"D- One of the most drinkable beers I've ever had. Easily can have several of these, and have no problems at all. This really is a wonderful beer, and recommend it to all that manage to see this review."
"Carbonation is surprisingly low!"
"Crystal clear, light gold, very bright. An easy pour produced an inch of fluffy foam that, while it settled fairly quickly to a thin layer of fine bubbles, left a lot of streaky lacing stuck to the sides of the glass. Sheets of bubbles eventually coated the glass as the beer quickly disappeared. Mild aroma with notes of cereal grains, pils malt, light lemony and herbal hops. Delicate, balanced flavour. Grainy sweetness, a bit crackery, with light lemony bitterness and grassy hops throughout. Slightly spicy in the finish. Delicious. Light bodied with ample carbonation, some crispness and dryness. This stuff is good. Refreshing with excellent balance. I'd be happy having this on a regular basis as a go-to lager."
"D: Overall, I was quite happy with this beer. Even though it was supposed to be the hefeweizen I was searching out, I was glad to try this. Definitely not my favorite Munich Helles, but still a great beer. Definitely makes me want to visit Germany and try as many of these as possible. LIght enough to be very drinkable, yet flavorful enough to keep my interest. This would be a great beer to give to a macro drinker to turn them on to better beer."
"Its flavor is quite bitter from start to finish, although it is light is well defined . The end is not widespread but leaves a good memory in the throat."
"D: A very delicious and drinkably refreshing lager, and I really don't like lagers. An enjoyable treat after a long day of work in the hot sun."
"Smooth finish, some malt lingers. Very drinkable beer. Definitely a classic in the world of beer (oldest brewery in the world, right?)."
"Well, this is a lager and this is beeradvocate so I should probably divide all the scores I gave this beer by 1.25 and call it a day but I won't because lagers rock and you suck."
"Just like a golden lager should, this goes down fast. Relatively low ABV prevents any regrets later on from doing so."
"D- exelent, i will take 6 of this ones with no problem, at thios time the best munich lager hell that i have try"
"D: Low ABV makes this one a great sesson beer.... Over all flavors are OK, not the best I've had from Weihenstehaner, but a good little beer."
"Drinkability is very good. Tasty beer; nothing much to complain about here."
"O This is a good German Pils, but I prefer their worldclass hefeweizen. I would recommend this for the American Pils drinker if they want to take a baby step toward fuller more rewarding beers."
"This is frankly disappointing after their awesome korbinian. I need to revisit and review their other beers also."
"Drinkability: An excellent helles. I was trying to buy Weihenstephaner's weissbier, but apparently wasn't paying enough attention when I bought it. This is still a very good beer and very satisfying overall."
"Drinkability- easily drinkable and the hops keep this beer very smooth and drying and leave you looking for next sip, this is a very nice beer not sure complex but none the less a very solid example mucich helles, def on the drier end of the spectrum for a euro lager, worth looking for if you are tired of super dull lagers but dont want go to complicated, nice warm weather summer beer"
"poured from 500ml bottle to a clear golden yellow color with a nice 1 finger head with a great pure white head..the smell is grass ,malts, some floral hops smell and bread..it smells like a classic pils ..the taste is crisp and pure with grass and malt first with some sweetness..followed by some floral noble hop taste..quite refreshing and tasty ..the mouthfeel is medium light but has enough malt and hop to let you know that this is a well made helles..this is way drinkable and really crisp and refreshing on a warm spring day in may in mpls..nicely recommended"
"Taste is crisp and smooth with a really quick finish and a light amount of carbonation. It's got a light sweetness and sharp very light hop bite. Very easy drinking."
"O: Perfect example of the style. I could drink this all summer."
"The flavor is very crisp and clean with grainy, bready malts initially. The hops are noticable but not overly so. The initial taste is that of toasted malts, and the finish is slightly sweet. Medium/light bodied, well carbonated and finishes dry. Quite a good beer and very easy to drink. I can definately see myself drinking several of these in a sitting..."
"d- average drinkablty"
"D: This beer is light and goes down easily. It's eminently drinkable and a good example of the style."
"Very simple, light, crisp, refreshing, and drinkable, but nothing to rave about."
"Served at 50 degrees in a pilsener. 6269 indicated on the back label. Poured a bright, translucent yellow with a three inch, frothy bright white head. Head exhibits good retention, revealing delicate cloud-like bands of lacing as it recedes. Light nose - a little grassy and a little skunky. Taste consistent with nose; however, a faint hops presence and also a little bit of grain comes out in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-bodied with an easy carbonation and a clean finish. Easy drinking and refreshing on a warm day."
"I discovered this on my quest for a great pilsner, session beer. A standard Pilsner appearance but with a more hearty mouthfeel. It has a fantasic earthy/funky and fruity, almost floral notes, with hops only on the back end. I would drink this often. This is my new favorite beer."
"d - very easy to drink. an exceptional lager."
"D: It's very refreshing and easy to drink - a great choice for a session beer."
"Definitely a very easy-going beer. Crisp mouthfeel, quite drinkable, and the complexity that it has is very subtle. Good for when you don't want the beer to be the centerpiece of action, be it a hot afternoon in the biergarten or with an equally soft-palated meal. Overall, not bad."
"Another solid german brew. Well done."
"D--Very drinkable, sweetness and clean flavors make this a good beer to start the night."
"I wasn't expecting a lot of this beer since I presumed the brewery put all of their effort into the hefeweizen. Wow, was I wrong! This lager is great. Golden yellow with a solid head. The complex flavors only increase with the intake. Enjoy in large qualities or buy cheap, mass produced beer instead and leave this stuff for people who can appreciate it."
"Golden pour but not bad, seen worse, decent smell, not super impressive, but wow. This is a good beer, nice and smooth, one of the better ones I have had, good with a light meal. not bad with the maltiness, very tasty indeed will be buying this one again."
"D: Very high. This is a beer you can and want to savor over the course of a fine meal. Perfect with onions and rare beef."
"Pours slightly cloudy, pale straw yellow. Nice foamy head that dies down quickly. Smell is grainy, like a silo, but pleasant and toasted, almost nutty. Taste is malty and maltier, with an undercut of bitterness that lives on to the finish. Mouthfeel is satisfying and not prolonged by any means. All in all, a rather good beer that I would drink a few of. Much respect!"
"The world's oldest brewery! What an extraordinary claim to fame! Brewing beer since 1040, this Bavarian brewery makes a range of quality, interesting beers. Like most older German brewers, they make a lot of noise about following the Reinheitsgebot, that fabled bad idea that fans of German beers still claim as a 'purity law'. That old law of 1517 was enacted on behalf of German bakers concerned about competition from brewers for wheat. Like many half-baked laws in societies the world over, why they didn't just pass a law saying ""wheat is for bread, not beer"" we may never know. Since then, it's morphed grotesquely into a purity law. Thankfully, German brewers managed to make good beer in spite of the law. Readers of this site probably know that the law was officially repealed in 1987. Weihenstephaner's ""original premium"" has a crisp, clean and light-bodied great taste. It pours light golden with a foamy white head. It's aroma and taste are good clean malt and mild hop. Drinkers of the beer axis of evil (you know the giants) should give this style and this brand a try. It's a very refreshing, every day kind of beer that can satisfy those afraid of the dark, but with enough complexity for people who find little interest in cars that only turn left."
"Mouthfeel is light and effervescent with a dry finish."
"Every lager should follow this formula. Very tasty. Thanks to my father for bringing a 6 of this to God's country."
"The bottle claims that Brauerei Weihenstephan is the oldest in the world, and hence the drink is the father of all helles lagers, if not all beer. 1040 AD, rock on."
"Notes: This is an outstanding easy drinking lager. The only big negative was the odd yeast floaters that filled the glass after I poured the beer. Anyway it didn't take anything at all away from the flavor."
"As soon as I took my first couple drinks, I realized this beer goes down super easy. I could easily finish a huge German Stein/mug full. I won't get this again, probably because I want to try their other styles. This was good though, and I would grab one If you see it."
"D – A very poundable brew; perhaps the best choice for das boot. And it will pair with nearly anything."
"It's a lager. So it's yellow and a little watery. Kinda fizzy. It's better than most lagers, which I guess is a back-handed compliment. Can't say I agree with its overall grade here.Good price, though, as are all their beers. I think the Hef is just a lot better, and on a hot summer day, would be the choice."
"D: Great go-to beer. Drinks very easy. Would have this almost everyday... desert island beer?"
"Great with rich foods... perfect alone!"
"Really excellent. A testament to what clean, quality ingredients and masterful brewing can produce. Sure, its not the most exciting or bold style, but sit back and sip one and the delicate complexities are really impressive."
"D: A direct, no-frills, pure and to-the-point lager. Good example of the style."
"D - Extremely drinkable and refreshing."
"D: Very refreshing, even on a cold winter's evening. A classic Munich Helles."
"Weihenstephaner Original Lager is an exceptional lager. It is tremendously thirst quenching and with its ABV makes it a great session brew...Hard to have just one."
"Drinkability: this is a very easy to drink beer that one could have all evening long and not get bored. Solid beer here."
"Drinkability: A very good, super light, and super sessionable lager. Very clean. I could have several."
"I thought I was getting the Hefeweizen. This was a nice surprise. Wish I had gotten a whole six pack now. This is a very tasty and satisfying beer. I will try to have this many times again."
"Excellent beer. Very crisp and refreshing. Subtle floral and citrus flavors, and goes down like silk. Beautiful golden color and a nice bright smell compliments the sturdy but overall light quality of this beer. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this beer and wanting to have another."
"Overall - What can I say? Weihenstephaner can do no wrong."
"O: My second bottle of this wasn't mishandled and terrible like the first. I can now honestly say that I love this beer. If only American adjuncts tasted this good!"
"worth checking out if you want a good german lager"
"If anything, this is a really drinkable beer that would be perfect for a summer day by the pool. Light, crisp, flavorful, and not a filler-upper at all. A very solid beer from the world's oldest brewery."
"D: Good ABV and very drinkable. Pretty tasty overall, especially for the style."
"D: Normally I'm not the hugest lager fan (especially not lighter lagers), but this one was quite the exception. A fairly flavorful beer and not too bad price wise."
"Pours a very clear yellow with a medium-sized white head. The aroma is biscuity/bready malts with a little bit of hops. The flavor is malty with hop bitterness at the end. You also get a little bit of toasted/caramel malt in the flavor. Very tasty. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D - very good, great session beer, especially in hot weather"
"D: very easy to drink."
"D: This beer has character for how mellow it is. Easy to drink, inexpensive, and very tasty. This is a session beer if I have ever experienced one. There's no wonder they have been in business for almost a thousand years."
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mostly malts, a bit sweet. Taste is crisp, sweet and malts, pretty tasty. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is a good session beer. Overall this is a fine beer."
"So I'm trying to knock off a few styles that I haven't reviewed so I bought this and a Dunkel Weisse tonight and will try them back to back. Pours a clear golden color with a three finger white head that fell slowly leaving incredible lacing. Aroma is sweet, bready, with notes of lemony noble hops. Flavor is light, some bread and grassy flavors, non-existent bitterness. Basically just a lightly sweet doughy beverage. Medium bodied, ample carbonation. An easy quaffer."
"Overall it's pleasant and easy drinking. Good but just not that special."
"D: Pretty much the definition of a quaffable beer, whether on a warm summer day or after a long day of work."
"With all of the excellent German and domestic helles lagers on the market, what's the point in drinking American macros, unless price is a factor? This beer is crisp and clean with an abundance rich melanoidiny bread character."
"This is a well-crafted brew, but the Munich Helles remains a difficult style for me to get into due to the light funk in it and a lesser strength all around."
"D - not bad. more of a summer brew to me versus drinking it in cold weather. i believe it would be very refreshing drinking it outside in hot weather."
"Drinkability: This is pretty good. It's something I could drink again and I think it would be a good session beer."
"My father doesn't like my beers because they ""taste like flowers."" I was able to turn him on to this though. I generally dislike lagers (well, American adjuncts), but a great lager."
"This is a very nice German lager..especially fresh and on tap!"
"D: Refreshing and not challenging for days when the palate needs a break from over the top American hops. I'd drink this over any BMC for that matter."
"There are many superb Bavarian lagers out there, and there are those which are painfully average. This offering from Weihenstephan is unfortunately the latter. Too light for my tastes, even for a Helles lager."
"D- This is everything I want in a lager. I could knock down several of these."
"Poured from a 500 ml brown bottle. Pours a pale golden with a medium head that leaves about an inch of foam and moderate lacing. Aroma is a bit less detectable than expected, pretty much just a slight maltiness. Taste is a very subtle malt and yeast. The hops are barely detectable at first, though they do come into focus more in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is soft and well rounded, as befits the style. Smoothness gives this brew a good drinkability. Overall, a decent representation of the Munich Helles style."
"D - A tasty lager, clean and well made w/ mild overall effect. The drinkability is good and would go best with sausage, since it has enough carbonation to cut the grease - a very good helles, a quality drinkable brew."
"Drinkability: There is no question that this is a very drinkable beer, and I was actually surprised by it being 5.1% because it had the body and mouthfeel of a beer a great deal closer to 4%."
"Disappointing."
"A crisp, happy hay colro withs consistant bubbling, but a light, bright head of less than one finger. The aroma was a pale and crystal amlt delight with hints of some mineral water and grass. The taste was a crisp hay field of pale and pilsner malts. The hard water makes itself evident in this beer. Very good though. Helps bring the hops into a better light. Slightly dry, but other very crisp and refreshing palate."
"Overall this is a pleasing German Lager, with more complexity in the flavors than many others. I admire how it tastes slightly unique, and isn't one of the many generic lagers that characterize this type of beer. I would buy it again..."
"D-4.0"
"D - Impressive response to a Czech Pilsner."
"D - Smooth and clean with a nice balance of sweet grainy malt and herbal hops. Tasty."
"D: I'd have another, but it's hard to choose this one over other Weihenstephaner beers!"
"Lighter bodied but not watery. Decent carbonation."
"Drinkability: Goes down quickly, its smooth and slick; its good stuff, you could session with this beer no prob."
"Overall: Second brew by my German brethren and they sure know what they are doing. For its category it is a surefire winner and if I'm looking for a light lager then this would be a go-to."
"D: About as stereotypical a Munich Lager you're ever going to fine and a pretty damn good one at that."
"This beer pours a pale straw colour with nice carbonation that leaves a one finger head with nice lacing,it has a really nice honeycomb,rice pudding aroma to it with some hops noticeable aswell,it has an above average mouthfeel with nice hints of real malty,malty hops and a nice creamy finish,a very nice beer thats very easy to drink and could drink all night."
"Drinks very easily and I would drink this all day and all night. Wonderful."
"I took the first drink and it matched the aroma perfectly. Very well balanced, great lager taste, mouthfeel, and at ~5% ABV it has great drink ability. My girlfriend even liked it! Get a hold of this one and try it."
"Nice nose of light grassy hops and some well balanced malts. Bit of yeasty funk and light lemon. Rather bright and clean on the nose. Taste follows and offers some toasted light malts and a slightly coarse texture. Offers a long finish for the style yielding a decent feel. Drinkability matches well given a good carbonation that keeps through the pint. Not my favorite from the brewery but they've yet to dissappoint."
"The body is light and crisp with carbonation while it finishes dry. This is a highly drinkable beer with moderate abv."
"Overall this was a very easy-drinking lager and is one that I could session on a hot summer day. Definitely worth a shot."
"Drinks very nicely. Goes well with a warm, humid evening, but not so fast that is can't be enjoyed in the process. The fullness of the carbonation helps slow the drinking down...now I have more time to enjoy it."
"Drinkability: Definitely drinkable. A great beer for whatever you're doing, a session, eating, etc."
"D- This beer is smooth and crisp making it quite quafable but it has good complexity for such a light beer making it a good session beer."
"d) Very refreshing, covering many functions. An ideal thirst quencher, an ideal session beer, but also the perfect starting lager at a dinner party, in the finest glassware."
"D- Super easy to drink, makes a great session beer. Cant believe it took me this long to try it."
"d- decent drinkability, guess i thought it would be a little better than it was, it didn't wow me as much as the the hefeweissbier did, although i didn't hate it, just probably wouldn't buy again."
"Reviewed 07/25/09, on tap at Pub & Kitchen, Philly. Pours clear and golden in color. Aroma is sweet, lightly flowery, pleasant. Taste is sweet with a husky grain flavor as well. Earthy hop notes balance things out. Balanced, flavorful certainly by lager standards. Mouthfeel is smooth, good carbonation but nothing overpowering. This is refreshing, easy to drink, medium-bodied and finishes slightly on the dry side. A winner."
"very drinkable, esp since it is 9:30 in the a.m. here in the toasty central valley of CA."
"The brew is extreamly drinkable, and would be gobbled up quickly in a large get together. Nice drinkable brew - which is just what a good session calls for. The only problem with this brew is you can get similar brews for much cheaper if you are looking for a very drinkable party pleaser."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: A fine beer, notable for it's easy-drinking, refreshing qualities, though, please, pass their hefeweizen."
"OVERALL: Another fantastic offering from Weihenstephan. A great and tasty helles, this one definitely rivals Augustiner for top spot in the category. One I'll be re-visiting on a hot day. Would love to have this fresh on tap. Drinkable and enjoyable. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel was a little thin. Definately what a lager should taste like."
"Overall, this is my first Munich Helles Lager that I know of and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I cannot say enough about this beer's balance. It is very easy drinking and I hope to drink more in the future."
"Clean, crisp, well bittered and balanced. I am a fan of German beers and this is a great example of the fine lagers that come out of that country. A touch more spicy in the hop department then a pilsner which is ok with me. A great easy drinking brew."
"Notes: My first Weihenstephaner out of the 5 different bottles that I bought. I chose this one first since it is the ""original."" Now I am even more motivated to try the remaining ones."
"Drinkability is as high as it gets. This is the ultimate session lager. Yes, it's a little bit pricey for a lager, but it's worth it. I have no idea how fresh my sixer was, so I'd like to get my hands on a definitively fresh sample. Either way, this is a kickass lager."
"mouthfeel is good, it has a mild flavor and that makes it an easy driinking beer. recommended"
"Tried this beer from my cousins pack of world beers. Pours a pale yellow with good head retention. Nice taste of malt and a little bit of fruity notes. I felt it also had a little smokey flavor to it, not overwhelming but just barely noticeable. Over all it's taste is very well balanced. The aftertaste was a little bit displeasing but i think I will we buying this one again."
"Another wonderful beverage from Weihenstephan. I can't get enough of their beers."
"(from tasting notes on 13 June 09)"
"Drinkablilty: I find it almost impossible to not chug this. Its so refreshing and clean tasting. I really want one of those giant mugs full."
"An exceptional example of the helles style. So refreshing, you simply can not drink only one and stop. While this lager is ideal for the summer season, I could quaff this one all year. I am impressed with the freshness of this imported low ABV lager."
"I'm going to have to try this one again after a while and see if I find it as appealing as I have this evening, but I suspect I will still enjoy this one the second time as much I have upon first tasting. I gotta recommend this one."
"Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! Will you smell that! So much what a good German beer should smell like! Traditional golden look, but maybe a tat on the lighter side. The head is something else foaming up nice a thick and high that makes you say, ""yum!"" Taste is a little lacking from my usual German brand. Grading apples to apples, German beer should have a little more flavor. But it goes down extra smooth. You can chug this beer, but should a German beer be like that? Notably, it's the world's oldest brewery, though that is likely misleading since it is likely not made the same way as in the year 1040. It's more likely a marketing ploy. The beer seems to be like it's competing with American Lagers instead of German Lagers."
"Drinkability - The most drinkable Lager I have had to date. Very good."
"I guess this isn't the most descriptive review, but my opinion should be clear. If I had to drink one beer for the rest of my life, this would be it. Oustanding!"
"D: I really appreciated the on draught, much fresher than any bottle I've had. Here's to simplicity, nailed perfectly in a pint glass."
"Overall, a wonderful German lager. Crisp and refreshing, light and playful, a great beer for almost any occasion. Might also make a decent stepping-stone beer for those who need such a brew (you know who you are)."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is carbonated and creamy. The body of the beer is light and the finish is nil. This is an okay beer. There is no spiciness to the beer. Kinda surprised was hoping for more."
"Poured into weizen glass from bottle. Crystal clear with massive fluffy white head, great retention and lacing. Smell was of grain, yeast, and some biscuit. Taste was heavy on the biscuit malt (dry) with some spice and grain. Not bad for a lager I suppose. Mouthfeel was light and crisp, overall a good beer."
"Appearance on pour is wonderful. Very light color; very clear. It has a bright white three finger head that disapates quickly to steady, lacy thin head. The aroma is sweet, citrus, yet rather earthy. The taste is not strong; but somewhat hoppy. Finishes very clean and somewhat dry, leaving me eager for another. The feel is very smooth and pleasant, not thin. Carbonation is rather high, but pleasant. This beer is very drinkable, one of my favorites so far."
"Pours an immaculate light straw color, crystal clear with a persistant white head. Smells of lemony wheaty bready light malts and European hops. Tastes crisp, clean and clear. Its actually a bit creamy which goes well with the taste. Drinkability is very high."
"16.9oz brown bottle. Pours a pale yellow color with a rocky white head the left some lacy stickiness on the side of the glass. Aromas were of pale malt, fresh lemon juice, and some dried grass. Mouth-feel was thin and bubbly with decent carbonation. Tastes were similar to aromas - lemon, pale malt, slight dried grass and a hint of hop. Finishes dry, which calls you back for another sip where the initial lemon taste refreshes the palate once again. Very good lager from one of my favorite German brewers!"
"Pours a clear straw color with a fluffy white head that quickly fades. Lot of carbonation in glass. Smells sweet and bready with some floral, earthy hop aromas. A nice flavor, some sweet honey and bready malt flavors with the flowery, earthy hop bitterness. The aftertaste also has a flowery bitterness to it. Also detected a slight metallic tinge in the finish, but not much. Good light mouthfeel and great drinkability. Definitely a crisp and clean beer made with quality ingredients."
"D - Ideal for a helles. Wish some place kept this pour on draft. Excellent. Come on BAs give lagered beers some love."
"Weihenstephaner continues to impress. They couldn't make a bad beer if they tried. While this is not quite on the level of their most prestigious beer, it's impressive nonetheless. It doesn't possess the depth or character of Hefeweissbier, Vitus, or Korbinian. The nose and its body could use a little attention, but it's nice all-around otherwise. One thing's for certain, you can't go wrong with Weihenstephaner beer. I'm repeatedly impressed, and occasionally blown away, by their beer."
"pour is golden. mild sediment with a decent head. smell is a bit malt a bit hops. earthy, apple, and honey. palate is quite balanced and very mild. goes down very well. but wouldn't say its either more so malty or hoppy. apple, honey, earthy straw finish, and clean. very consistent and a great gateway... not a extreme of helles characteristics."
"This one goes down very easily, and is a great lager."
"D: A good summer drinker."
"clear light straw, snow white head. aroma is bready, doughy fresh malt and light grassy hops. taste follows suit. on balance, lightly sweet. light-bodied with a crisp drying finish. very drinkable, good example of the style. would make for a nice summer quencher and gateway beer."
"A decent, unoffensive lager...it does a little better paired with food than served alone."
"in the last couple days i have drank a few helles lagers and this one take the cake so far"
"D- The sweetness builds a bit which brings the drinkability down a bit. This would be a nice beer with a meal."
"D: A fantastic beer."
"D: An outstanding beer that never fails to impress. This is about as good as it gets when it comes to pale lagers."
"Average at best; drink cold so it is at least a bit bitter. I expected more from Weihenstephan."
"D: Firts the definition of drinkable. I wish more American beers would mimic this style... it is tasty, refreshing, and drinkable! Excellent!"
"The beer is poured a clear straw colour with a great white fluffy head. Brilliantly clear. In the nose there is a bit of hops, but mostly a grainy/bready flavour. It's not very big on the nose, it's just pretty much standard. The flavour of the beer is incredibly smooth with a nice noble hop character in the background and a smooth grainy flavour up front. This is just a great balance between lightness, hops, and breadiness. Mothfeel is light, as expected. THe beer is also quite drinkable!"
"Pale yellow gold and crystal clear with a fine rocky white head that leaves nice lace on the glass. Smells of toasted grain and noble hops with lemony citrus. Tastes of soft lemon and fresh bread with a nice hop bittering in the mostly clean finish. Light bodied and effervescent. Classic."
"m/d - Smooth, low-moderate carbonation. Not sticky sweet, pleasant. Easily sessionable, not particularly tasty but a great alternative to a light American style lager."
"I can only say that either this bottle was off, out of date, poorly stored or brewed under license by unhygienic fishmongers. I can't understand how my review is so out of whack with the general opinion, but truly the bottle I had was appallingly bad."
"Weihenstephan has yet to produce a beer that doesn't follow its style to the T. No wonder their school is the most renowned brewing school throughout the world."
"I will be purchasing many more of these ~17oz bottles in the future. A great session beer that surprises, and makes me wanting more."
"Served out of a bottle into a stella glass. Poured perfectly with a 1 and half inch head. Clear golden color, head stays fairly prominent through most of the beer. This beer taste amazing. It's one of my favorite bavarian style helles lager. You can truley taste the hallertau hops that they have been using for hundreds of years. The mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth and light. Truely meant to be enjoyed out of a liter mug or tall style glass. The only other bavarian style lager that rivals this one is Augustiner."
"Ultimate drinkability. I'll be back for more of this"
"A fair amount of honey throughout the palate, not really desired. Slight yeasty/hoppy bitterness on the back, a bit of a sticky mouthfeel; body is quite thick and slow, with very little carbonation upon drinking. This is overly sticky, and quite unpleasant. When I'm drinking a lager I expect some sort of gas. Having said that, the palate is not very nice, yes, but it's fairly well balanced. This is drinkable enough and it's what I would expect given the style."
"D - Really exceptional beer. I like the reasonable amount of carbonation, and the balance of bitterness with the fruitiness. I'll absolutely buy this again."
"Pours an extremely clear, light yellow colored body, fizzy, not cloudy at all. Big creamy white head, quickly diminishing. Very malty nutty aroma. Fresh malty smell. Some graininess, but not a strong aroma overall. Sweet taste, some nuttiness. Refreshing and clean tasting. Tastes much better than it smells. Very quaffable. Some breadiness in the taste. Wow, this is very tasty, I am shocked, based on the light color and aroma. Soft palate."
"drinkability: drink this instead of coors, bud, miller... you get the idea.."
"Refreshing and easy to drink, very well done."
"Overall: Great mouthfeel, strong carbonation and light in body make it very drinkable as well. I'm liking this brewery even more."
"Possibly the best session beer that I've ever tasted. It's crisp, dry and fresh. The hops give the beer a perfect, slightly spicy finish. The malt is up front and smooth. It tastes fresh and clean. This lager flavor is incredible. It's a light yellow liquid that should really be served in a massive stein atop which I can picture a bubbly white head that leaves plenty of lacing. This beer is obscenely drinkable. It's physically difficult to take a small sip. I would thoroughly enjoy drinking this beer from a one liter glass while sitting in a beer garden in Germany. Sadly, I can only imagine how good this beer is fresh from a tap at the brewery."
"Drinkability- Among the most drinkable available. Smooth, flavorful, refreshing and delightfullly sessionable."
"A nice, easy to drink example of the style that has a good amount of flavor. Sessionable and I could knock back a few in a sitting."
"I have started to develop an appreciation for the Munich Helles Lager and I think this stuff is damn good. It's a bit expensive for what it is, and I think Spaten is almost as good, only a 12 pack can be had for about the same price as four bottles of this."
"Salud!"
"*Update on 08.13.13 -- grabbed up a bottle and it's perfectly clear."
"The flavor profile was without hops in the beginning, but as the brew warms, the hops become more present. The malt character is stronger, but still manages to produce a nice balance"
"Drinkability - wish I had more, a great example of why Germany is known for lagers"
"D - Light and crisp, this one is definitely an easy drinker."
"I would definitely recommend anything from Weihenstephan that you can get your hands on! It's all good stuff and I understand that the brand is pretty hard to come by. I'm lucky enough to have a store that carries a lot of there varieties at the entrance to my neighborhood. CHEERS!"
"Poured from brown 500ml bottle, a clear straw color with fluffy white head. Great retention and leaves lacing all the way down. Smell: sparse, spicy saazy hops, light grain. Taste: spicy hops, grain, nicely balanced. What I'll call a banana precursor, lemon. Very smooth and creamy (isn't this the case for all of their beers), semi dry finish."
"A great lager by ""the oldest brewery in the world"""
"D- This is a delicious beer that goes down very easy. Very tasty in its own right and super quaffable. It would go very well with food too."
"Another Weihenstephaner that I could drink until the beer stops flowing - light, welcoming, but still flavorful and satisfying."
"It's a bit pricier than some of the other Bavarian Helles Lagers available in the States, but if you love the style as much as me, you might want to give this one a shot."
"good drinkability."
"Clean and refreshing and crisp with a smooth aftertaste. This beer is very easy to drink and quite delicious even though I am enjoying it out of season. Weihenstephaner is one of my favorite German breweries with good reason."
"MF&D - I think I should mention I am drinking this at about 3 in the afternoon, I couldn't wait untill 5, (as my sister says, ""its always 5 o'clock somewhere!"") therefore I find this beer amazingly easy and pleasing to drink. though a bit thick, I do not find this to be a detriment, only it holds it back from being perfect for this style. Though the consistency is really great for a beer, and does indeed make me want to drink it all night."
"Drinkability: Very good tasting, great mouthfeel. Recommended"
"D: This is so easy to drink. The flavor is very nice, although nothing outrageous, but it's so well balanced and clean that it has to stand out as an example of what a lager should be."
"Overall - I would give this the benefit of the doubt that if it wasn't skunked, then it would be much better. The taste really casts a shadow though, it was very bland. Hopefully a re-review will fare better next time."
"Very drinkable, an excelent session brew."
"D: A good light drinking lager that was cleanly brewed with an equally clean finish. Respectable session."
"Drinkability: As I have read in some forum posts about breakfast beers, and this being a good substitute for orange juice i can see where they were heading towards. Its so refreshing and crisp and well done that it can be enjoyed slowly or at a faster pace because the flavors are so upfront and clean. For breakfast, i wouldnt drink this, but as an early beer for a starter in a day of drinking, hell yes. I would drink this all day long."
"D- My tastes certainly slant toward ales but this is a nice malty german lager with just the right touch of spicy hops to help provide and maintain my palatte's interest. Could easily drink many more of these if it weren't 40 degrees outside and had a second and third bottle in the fridge."
"Bottom line: A killer example of a minor style. Quite nice, quite drinkable, but simple as the style dictates. You could do heaps worse. Go Germans!"
"Taste: Malts with a light hoppiness."
"This is very easy drinking. Such a perfectly well integrated beer."
"Pale, clear, straw colored with a short-lived snow-white head. Biscuty, slightly medicinal nose. Balanced taste with light floral notes, a bit of spice, lots of grassy flavors at the end, all embedded in a bready, malty package. Its crisp and clean. Not trying too hard to be what it is not but still more complex than the few others I have tried in this style."
"This beer pours a light golden color with aromas of some malt and faint hops. The taste starts out with a light clean hop flavor that finishes with a malty creaminess. Not a lot to it but still one of the better German lagers I have had. I would rather have this one than Bitburger or Warsteiner."
"Going to be tough to get 250+ on this one, because there's really not much to it. Pours clear gold with a bubbly white head. Faint flowery aroma with malt and light hops. Taste is a lager with good maltiness and no bitter metal in the finish. Good, nothing special."
"Could drink more than a few of these at a sitting."
"Note - I really enjoyed this brew, but listed as a lager, it could easily mistaken as either a pilsner for hefeweizen by any of the senses..."
"Aroma is malty and fresh, but with an underlying aged or cooked grain note. On the palate this beer is crisp, flavorfully malty, then subtle lemony hoppiness takes over in the finish. Very nice balance of crispness with very mild bitterness, and a touch of starchy sweetness at the end. Very drinkable and refreshing, and retaining an individuality and interesting character that sets it apart from the many euro and american lagers out there."
"D - very easy to drink a few of these."
"I'm sure ""delightful"" has been appended to many other reviews of this beer, so let me add my own. It really is a delightful beer. Very bright color with plenty of bubbles and a loose head that fizzes with a nice cloud of honey, lemon and lime. The body is light, clean and bubbly, and you'll find no shortage of citrus and honey in the flavor with just enough hoppiness to give it a bite before it goes down. Somehow Weihenstephan has managed to stuff a sunny May afternoon into a beer bottle. Had this with a plate of chicken sausages and brown rice-- wonderful. An instant favorite."
"So bavarian, so damn good."
"D- as far as helles goes, i've never been a huge fan, but this offering has showed me what the best can be like. fresh grainy flavors and body and bitterness to rival czech pilseners, this is much much more than just yellow beer water in a glass."
"This beer was a damn good surprise when I had it at a tasting recently. Great looking clear golden color. The malty, bread bakery aroma and taste were right on target without being sweet or cloying. This is what malty lagers should be all about. Perfect balance IMO."
"Presentation aside, which was the best there could be, this brew was fantastic. Not only did it pair awesomely with my jager schnitzel and spatzel, but it drank so well on its own, before, during and after dinner. If I'm hanging with a lager crowd and know where I can find Weihenstephaner lager, I'll pick it up in a heart beat,"
"A perfect example of a benchmark German lager. Weihenstephaner Original pours a clear yellow color with a sticky and fluffy white head. Fruity pale malts balanced by slightly tart hops. Light and very drinkable. Classic beer. I highly recommend."
"Extremely easy drinker. A most pleasurable German lager. Recommended, but I like some of the other Weihenstephaner offerings better."
"Poured into a seidel. Typical pale gold color with a nice crest of white foam that leaves chunks of lacing everywhere. Aromas of Munich and pils malt, with only the slightest hoppy lemon twinge. Flavors of lightly toasted bread, honey sweetness, soft tart lemon, a touch of grass, and a fleetingly metallic finish. Mouthfeel is standard Weihenstephaner perfection. Soft and crisp with no wateriness regardless of the light body. An excellent example of the style."
"Light body with a carbonation that is not harsh. A very refreshing beer. A good Helles Lager."
"A really good lager-style beer. I'm just beginning to drink some of the better representatives of this style, and so far am liking them. Nothing spectacular, in my mind, but a great beer when more than a couple are on the horizon."
"D - Damn good. Highly drinkable and not overly bland as seems to be par for the helles style. One of the most remarkable aspects of this brew is it's complete lack of wet dog and metallic flavors, something that I find always creeping into lagers and pale lagers especially. Well done."
"Palate is toasty, cracker like with soft malt sweetness, enough hops to make it have a gentle bite (more like a nibble), and it is light bodied. This one is amazingly refreshing & drinkable, and above all else - for a lager like this, it has no flaws. Simply one of the very best in its style."
"M/D: Overall not a bad beer but not really one of my favorite styles. Nothing really stood out to me."
"D: I could drink a lot and like it. Decent taste, good finish in the mouth - clean and dry."
"PS- Any of you who review these lagers and pils, give them a D, complaining about the weak or bland flavors...stop reviewing the style if you dont like it and don't want to be objective. Yes, this isn't a Double Bastard, we know...go fuck yourselves."
"Drinkability is supa dupa!"
"This is an enjoyable change of pace for me. Too bad I waited until the end of the summer to try it. Very good."
"pours a nice clean clear pale yellow with lots of carbonation and a good fluffy white head that lingers unusually long for a lager. Nose is slight skunk and good graininess. Very nice taste with grain, light fruit, some slight spice, a little bit of skunkiness and a touch of slight cream. Some grass or straw as well. Mouthfeel is nice, and not too thin or overcarbonated. Drinkability is quite good, but could be better, although still an excellent sessionable lager. Overall a very pleasant lager, and one i would certainly revisit. Great for the summer grill, or moose camp in the fall. good beer."
"D - this is the first German lager I have tried and was pleasantly surprised. This was very simple, yet delicious."
"Pours a clear light gold or yellow color with a thick fluffy white head which settles down but I still get some nice lacing. Aroma is malty with a lot of fresh cut grass. The beer tastes OK, there's nothing foul about it, but I wouldn't call it good either. A mix of grassy semi-sweet malts and hops and the beer finishes a little sour and dry. I'm sure I'll have a beer from this brewer again but it'll be their hefe I buy, not this one."
"It poors a golden straw color with a large white rocky head that last very well and left some patchy lacing. The smell is of light grains and light sweet almost honey malts with some mild hop aromas including grass, spicey and slight lemon. Tatse is malts all the way upfront, very sweet yet light malts with a dry crisp finish showing off the noble hops. The mouth feel is medium in feel and carbination with a dryfinish that leaves you ready for more and also makes it very drinkable. This one like most great Helles is straight forward and right there with no hidden secrets, just a very well crafted beer. If you a fan of Helles pick up a 6pk of this it won't disappoint."
"This is the beer I will reach for if I want to quench my thirst and get drunk"
"Note: Drink this chilled - I let this warm up and some not so inviting minerally and off flavors showed up - blech."
"This would make a great session beer although I prefer the Weihenstephaner Dunkel."
"D - not bad. Something different for me recently. Refreshing and enjoyable. Would drink on a hot day again without an issue"
"Overall, this is drinkable and decent for the style but not really up to the other beers under the Weihenstephaner brand."
"D - Well balanced with a great flavor. What else can you ask for. By far thee best Munich Helles style lager that I've had to date! Good alcohol level and great flavor make for a great session lager IMO."
"The taste is clean with a good malt profile all the way through until the hotness leaves you with some parting gifts. It is well carbonated as the hundreds of tiny bubble release through the clean yellow color. Overall it is the original for a reason. Definitely one of the best lagers for me to date."
"Dumped the 12 oz. bottle into a .5L mug and got a whopper of a head that quickly sank down to a thin foam on top. It's a clear straw color, with some golden hues. Smell of copper and loam, with a hint of apple. Taste is crisp and metallic, with a nice hop bite to coming after the apple tones, with a breath of alcohol in the finish. It feels clean and watery in the mouth, quite refreshing. This is my summer beer, and I'm loving it."
"D- What a great beer and with such a low ABV, this is easily sessionable."
"Pour is a pale straw yellow with a tiny film on top and little to no lacing. Aroma is weak and a bit grassy. Mouthfeel is thin and sticky. Flavor is average at best but leaning more towards bland. Overall this beer is a major bummer considering their wheat beers are much better than this offering. Next time I will pass."
"D- Easy to drink, goes down like that of a Macro beer."
"Body medium with light carbonation and a slippery mouthfeel. I did not want to finish it."
"Very nice Helles."
"This is a very drinkable beer. I think that if I needed to sit down and drink all day (we'll call that day ""saturday"") this would be a perfect beer for the ocassion."
"The taste is very good, very smooth, very refreshing. This is a crisp beer, reasonably well balanced, a bit drying in the finish, a slight bit of citrus, a little bit of the husky grain emerges as well. There is a sweetness, not overpowering, in the mid section that segues into a drier finish. This is a light bodied beer that has a slight spicy hop bite in the finish as well. An enjoyable beer, very drinkable, well worth seeking out. It is a hot summer day as I'm writing this review, and Weihenstephan is exceptionally befitting. L'Chaim."
"Pours a glowing pale golden color. Lively carbonation, a healthy white head with excellent retention rises up and remains. Light and clean scents. A well-balanced act between hops and malt, with malts seeming to have the edge in the nose. Taste is quite thirst quenching. A delicate sweetness from the malt that is never too overdone. Nice nibble from the hops, ever so gentle. Somewhat grassy, leafy hop presence and a splash of lemon zest. Some biscuity bread is also present. Very soft and smooth going down with a light crispness to it. Entirely too drinkable. I would have more than just another. There is not much you can say wrong about this one. Hits the nail on the head for what it should be..."
"The beer did not have too much carbonation as noted above and I think that I have learned as of late that I really enjoy the German beers. Overall, this is a great beer and I will try to keep this in stock in my fridge."
"Crystal clear yellow with a slowly fading white head. Clean, sweet pale malt aroma. Fresh and doughy. Delightfully soft pilsner malt flavor...sweet with a light leafy hop bitterness. Medium bodied and smooth due to the somewhat low-ish carbonation. Yummy...that's a damn good lager. I wish it wasn't so expensive, I'd buy it by the case for the summer months."
"A wonderfully easy to drink beer that is perfect for the summertime. A lager that hits the spot."
"D: This beer goes down easier than my date on prom night. Easy drinking brew that has amazing flavor and still refreshes. This is a good plain drinking brew on any day. Happy day."
"MF&D - A quality beer. Great summertime choice."
"Drinkability wasn't great. I almost finished the beer but when it went flat during the last eighth or so of the beer, I had no desire to finish off the beer as the taste didn't appeal to me. I have no desire to hunt down this beer to drink, especially when I could spend the same money on a beer I like."
"Overall a decent summer drinker, that's light enough to enjoy on a hot day. As a lager it still exhibits a nice clean balance between the malt and hops."
"D: My second beer from this brewery, and it's simply outstanding. I think I have found my quintessential summer session brew. It went down in three large gulps after the few initial sips it took to assess flavor."
"Poured into an oversized wine glass with a small ½ fingers worth of white head. Watery golden yellow color and extremely clear with trace amounts of bubbles slowly rising from the bottom of the glass. It had an earthy grain and wheat type of odor to it. This one also tasted of grains as well but did have a slight hop presence near the end. Easy drinking with a light and almost fluffy mouth feel, I was pleased with my purchase."
"A quintessential beer that I couldn't even begin to appreciate or fully enjoy before I had treated myself to a few years of reading, tasting, and reviewing... truly tasty!"
"Golden, it has a huge white head that steadily shrinks to a permanent 1-inch head and leaves very nice lacing. The aroma is wodnerful and full-bodied, bread, honey, light pine, flowery citrus. The taste is outstanding with a strong bready quality, grain, pine, honey, hints of lemon and hay, sweetish and full-bodied, faintly oily, with a light, balancing bitterness. It's incredibly drinkable yet very tasty with full, clean, even flavours and light, interesting complexity."
"A very good example of the style. Also a great lawnmower beer with good complexity. Simply Wunderbar."
"Very drinkable and will look to but these more often."
"I'm not sure why I have avoided this beer for so long, but it truly is a world class lager. Clean, yet flavorful, with an amazing drinkablility. You can't go wrong here..."
"D = Very good drinkability, a nice light lager that is just a pleasing light lager."
"This beer poured a nice golden color, with about a one finger head. The head lasted only a minute or so. Good lacing though. Smell was good with malt and hops. Taste was very good. Sweet, and malty. Hint of citrus, and the right amount of hops on the back of the mouth. Was very crisp. Mouthfeel was good. Light and crisp. Drinkability of this of this beer was good. It was crisp and refreshing. Seems like a good summer beer. This might be my new BBQ beer."
"This is definitely one of those ""less is more"" beers. Pours a light gold with a moderate head. Both smell and taste are very earthy and bready. There is alot of citrus in the taste as well, which is more subtle than its bread counterpart. This beer is very clean and crisp. Highly recommend, especially for the Summer months."
"Awesome brew that goes down smooth, can likely match any meaty food and is quite refreshing. One of those true essence of beer brews."
"Poured into a pils glass and received a foamy one-finger head aided by good carbonation; stuck around for awhile and left some lacings on top of a golden body. Extremely hoppy and grassy, with some lemon piercing through on top of something sugary. A great hop presence is noticeable and there are some spices that hit the tip of the tongue. A medium-bodied beer that goes down smoothly but with a nice, dry aftertaste. There are some bread malts or something in there, plus there may have been some light fruitiness and sweetness, i.e. apples and honey. Not my favorite style or perhaps I would've enjoyed the complexities more, but I'd still recommend this to any beer drinker and look forward to buying another one."
"Excellent carbonation; crisp and refreshing; could suck 'em down at the Hofbrau all day long."
"I could drink this stuff all day. It seems to be different to the helles from Munich, maybe more like a beer from the schwarzwald ? Either way i love the fact its widely available in Perth."
"D: A fantastic lager beer, I need to buy this beer more, especially during the summer months."
"It does get a bit acidic feeling, hurting drinkability. But Brauerei Weihenstephan is batting 1.000 in my book. Maybe the crappy Tigers can take a lesson."
"This poured a light yellow color with beautiful fluffy head that lingered forever. Aroma was sweet malt. Taste was malty and also of grain. Was balanced a nice hops presence. The mouthfeel and carbonation were perfect.. The drinkability of this one is at the top of the scale. A nice sessionable lager. Not complex and not meant to be."
"An excellent session beer and one to give those who may not like beer or only drink macro crud. Just wonderful."
"D: Wow -- now I see why people make a fuss abou Weihenstephaner beers. This is such a smooth, drinkable yet distinctive beer that sets a very high bar for lagers."
"Bright but mild with lower carbonation for the style which allows that delicate buttery flavor to come through. Semidry in the finish with a lower ABV which provides high drinkability. A well rounded and unique brew."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied, yet slightly sticky on the lips. This is an OK beer"
"I don't know about this one. I've tried Weihenstephaner's beers before and never had a problem. I might go back and try again with this."
"This is probably my new light lager of choice. Good thing the restaurant that has it on tap is only 15 minutes away:)"
"D - This is a very nice lager. Everything from Weihenstephaner is quite good."
"D: Wow I want to kick myself because I only bought one twelve oz bottle."
"D- taste a little like they use the same yeast all their brews, beyond that a tasty munich helles lager"
"Outstanding beer! Appearance crystil clear golden yellow three finger white head with perfect lacing. Smell breadlike with hints of fresh mown hay. Taste cookielike malt character with just enough hop to balance it out. Mouthfeel mediem body mediem carbonation. Drinkability I could drink this one all day its simple but still has flavor. Use this to convert American macro drinkers."
"Recommended as a good representation of the style..."
"Mouthfeel is very smooth and light in the mouth. This drinks very easily and I would definitely love to sit around and drink a few more Very refreshing."
"Drinkability-outstanding drinkability,it's no wonder this brewery is still around!!"
"Pours a very crystal clear light straw color with a dense white, fluffy head and medium visual carbonation. The aroma is quite mild with sweet grain and slight noble hop aroma coming through. A little vegetal note coming through from pils malt, but nothing bad. On the palate, it comes through first sweet then hits the side of the mouth with a dry tartness. Hop bitterness is totally in check with the light toasty flavors of the pils malts and a little apple fruitiness from the yeast. Carbonation and mouthfeel are both according to style, medium and a medium low respectively. Overall, a nice example of the style, nearly textbook, but what else would you expect from the worlds oldest brewery."
"Drinkability is great. It's not really my style, but for what it is it's stellar. Give me one of these over a Heineken any day of the week - preferably a week during the summer, on a scenic vista overlooking the Rhine. Cheers!"
"This wasn't awful, but it was, in the end, droll. Nothing about the olfactories grabbed me and wowed. Decent."
"drinkability is great. this is an example of a great lager brew that keeps things light, but does not sacrifice lightness for lack of flavor. cheers!"
"Carbonation is lower than the spritzy beverage expected, but quite enjoyable. Body on the light side, and drinkability is nearly off the charts for me. Unfortunately only the 1809 is currently distributed to Kansas, otherwise Weihenstephan would be a regular in my fridge."
"Nice golden color with a decent head thatssticks to the glass and yet is fluffy. The smell is good to average, but has a nice smell and a clean crisp to it. the taste is great. Smooth as silk and is still good as it warms. This would be a great session beer."
"Worth a try, does not appear to be a dumbed down export model."
"Poured into a pils glass this beer lights up nicely, pale gold and crystal clear with nice active carbonation and a sticky and lacy one inch head that fades to a cap in a minute or two. The smell is nice an clean with touches of malty and grassy sweetness here and there, the taste at first is a mellow and buttery green apple that warms into a nice bready sweetness. I'm not really a fan of the style personally but this is still a very nice beer."
"Smooth and light on the palate with an infusion of carbonation that tickles the tongue. Toasted grain notes and a lemony floral hop presence round out the flavors. Not a very complex lager, but definitely a very solidly constructed brew. Easy drinking and quite tasty."
"Had in my Weihenstephaner glass. This beer poured a clear straw color and formed a nice foamy white head that left latticed lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, bread and grass. The flavor was of grain, biscuts and pepper. It was a fairly light body with a nice crisp finish to it."
"D-High. Did not expect the sweetness in a golden lager but would go back for more."
"D: Goes down smooth. May drink again."
"drinkability - Very easy to drink, nice and refreshing. I have had other from this company and they are great."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not filling at all, the kick is ok, if Im going to go with a light German lager this would be a pretty good choice. I could certainly drink several of these."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The mouthfeel is as perfect as could be... liquid silk, transforming to a foamy sea that finishes with sublime elegance. Although this isn't my go-to beer for this style, its presentation and tasting was a rewarding experience."
"I was surprised by this one, but I guess not really considering it's from the oldest brewery in the world. I considerd it very drinkable, and I could have several of these in a row without growing tired. This is the first Weihenstephaner I've tried, and certainly won't be my last."
"D - Good taste and smoothness make this easy to drink its one of those beers that you can drink all night."
"Pours a bright golden color with lots of creamy white head that sticks around for a while. Smells of noble and cascade hops and slightly yeasty. Taste is also very hoppy, citrusy and noble. There's lots of munich and lager malt flavor there as well, very tasty. Mouthfeel is a little creamy and a little fizzy, there's some scraping on the tongue. Overall, it's a very drinkable beer, I wouldn't mind having more."
"I'll consider this beer a delicacy after tasting a lot of Light American Lagers recently. This beer opens with a hop-dominant nose of Noble hops, releasing a boquet of earthy, grassy, herbal notes. A sturdy backbone of pilsner malts offer support for the hops, while offering little in terms of sweetness or graininess. Any pilsner-type dms or acetaldahyde are swallowed by the hops. Delicate malt textures bleed well into the dryness of the hops and mild alcohols. Finishes light, crisp, and with a lingering hop flavor. Very nice beer, but perhaps a bit too hop-dominant to be considered balanced."
"Weihenstephaner Original pours from a brown twelve ounce bottle as a golden yellow color with a thick white head that persists stubbornly. The aroma is malty with a hint of citrus, and a hint of hops. The taste is very well balanced, toasty malt and hops merge beautifully. There is also a hint of citrus flavor. Exceptionally easy to drink, one of the best lagers I've ever tasted."
"This brew pours to a golden yellow color with a fair sized head, which has left a fair amount of lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is dominated by malt with some light citrus like flavors, but not from hops I believe, more of a lemon flavor. The taste is nice, I will say that though I feel that this is a good beer, I think it is probably the last favorite that I have tried from Weihenstephan. I will say though that this brew exceeded my expectation and would be one that I would stock in my fridge especially during the warmer months"
"12 oz. bottle and in the lager mood...sparkling gold bubbly body with thick, creamy head--near-perfect Brussels lace...crisp, light/medium cereal malts present...soft texture, light body--a tongue-to-throat swiftness...a bit weak and thin...extremely weak and fleeting in taste... I kept waiting for what the commercial description calls ""character""...a yeasty finish...pleasant summer drinking but lacks a big pilsner taste...since 1040? tradition puts the overall where it is, hemming at the average while the promise of its beginning is unfulfilled..."
"D: Would make a great session beer, but personally I'd prefer something more substantial."
"Overall: A so-so pils, clean and light but rather unremarkable."
"D: A fantastic helles vom fass. Could drink this all day in the Biergartens of Munchen. If only i was there now!"
"Overall, one of the best lagers Ive had. An all-around solid choice that can make an excellent beer choice for when you want to have a bunch, or when you just want to wash down your bratwurst."
"This is the ultimate example of what a lighter colored lager should be."
"Edit: As this beer warms it develops a wierd metallic taste. Much better cold."
"As of now, this is probably the finest lager I have ever tasted. The freshness and lack of skunky tastes put it leagues ahead of most mainstream lagers. The price is on the high side, but not unreasonable considering the quality. There are certainly more interesting German beers out there, but this one reeks of quality and makes for very enjoyable drinking."
"Very drinkable. Might become a regular session beer for me. I was very suprised by the quality of this brew (have had bad luck with bottles from Germany in the past). Recomended."
"Light towards medium bodied, this one is so smooth, crisp and refreshing that it just begs for more."
"A surprise offering that in my opinion matches that of their hefeweizen. This was one of the best blonde lagers I've ever tasted. Will it be enough to win the Weihenstephaner Invite? Their dunkelweizen will be the last one on tap, coming up later."
"D - Quite drinkable. Perfect summer beer that can be drunk any time of year."
"D - Nothing remarkable in the smell or taste, just nicely balanced with enough character to make it a highly drinkable beer. Can't wait for the warmer weather to get stuck into more of these."
"D: A decent Old-World beer. They deserve credit, but maybe my 'buds are spoiled by the big flavor US versions. A session-er for sure. Tinge of sweet malt is appreciated and balancing. Finish is dry and short. Good stuff, but the flavor level needs to be more bold."
"I honestly thought it was going to be skunked, but I guess that I misread the pull date. I was wrong about this, and I'm glad I was. Great Helles, can definitely have plenty of these in one night."
"Great beer for BBQ's and relaxing by the pool."
"Overall a good and drinkable lager. Simple and straightforward."
"When I read the reviews from other BAs I had to relook at the bottle to see if I was drinking the same thing. Several said there's was cloudy or hazy. Mine was kristall klar and a pale straw colour. I got no phenolics that some reported but a malty grassy aroma and similar taste. There was a crisp sparkly mouthfeel but otherwise nothing overly complex. It sure is drinkable and I really enjoyed drinking it but it's not overly interesting. If I was going to a BBQ and this was available I might take it but then I'd probably just buy the hefe and be really happy."
"This is a simple but perfectly executed lager. The smell and taste are similar; grassy, organic, hints of clove and citrus. Hops linger slightly (in a pleasant way) in the otherwise very clean finish. A bit thicker than I was expecting, there's a slightly creamy quality that I found highly enjoyable. This is hilariously drinkable stuff."
"A great lager, and a good addition to the fridge. This one's recommended."
"Drinkability: easy drinking beer most definitely for the summer time, a style that I am more and more appreciating and trying to replicate in my homebrewing."
"Talk about tasting something ""again for the first time."" This is one of the first real Germans I tried (after the obligatory Beck's) and thought it was good. But I really didn't appreciate how good until years later, drinking it again as an experienced (IMHO) BA. The color is nice, somewhat cloudy pale yellow; with a fresh, subtle malt/hops in the nose. Thinner mouthfeel, but very nice taste that balances the pale malt flavor with a distinctly fruity or citrus (?) hops flavor that makes it extremely refreshing to drink. According to a German wine lover I know, the taste is reminiscent (if subtlely so) of a crisp German Riesling Kabinett. Very good--and something that I've served to BAs and ""macro"" lovers alike, with equal rave reviews. Truly a universally popular German helles."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a slightly hazy, light yellow-gold color with a thick, bubbly head that blankets the top of the beer. The smell is both sweet and spicy, slightly of cloves. The taste is very mellow, with an initial spicy sweet malt nicely balanced with a decent hop profile and finishes with a slight sweetness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a smooth, lightly carbonated consistency. This is an enjoyable and drinkable beer. I've had their Hefe several times and I would say this is on the same par as that (for the style)."
"A crisp, happy hay colro withs consistant bubbling, but a light, bright head of less than one finger. The aroma was a pale and crystal amlt delight with hints of some mineral water and grass. The taste was a crisp hay field of pale and pilsner malts. The hard water makes itself evident in this beer. Very good though. Helps bring the hops into a better light. Slightly dry, but other very crisp and refreshing palate. I need to have one of these out of a boot."
"Footnote: From the Weihenstephaner website: ""The Bavarian State Brewery Weihenstephan. Nearly one thousand years ago it was the monastery brewery of the Benedictine monks, then the Royal Bavarian State Brewery. Today, as a regulated enterprise of the Freestate of Bavaria, it is a company run according to the precepts of private business. As the oldest existing brewery in the world, our brewery occupies an exalted site atop Weihenstephan Hill in the Bavarian city of Freising, surrounded by the comparatively still very young Weihenstephan science centre of the Technical University of Munich. Yet it is precisely this unique combination of tradition and custom, proven knowledge, and modern science, which gives the brewery its incomparable identity and permits it to brew beers of the highest quality."""
"Poured a clear golden straw color with a decent white head that left some nice lacing on the side of the glass. The nose is very faint, some noble hop scent. Has a dry cracker malt taste with some light hop flavor. The flavor doesn't stand out but it is nice and crisp and refreshing. The feel is a bit watery, crisp, finishes very nice. This is a very drinkable and refreshing beer, why American macros can't follow this style is beyond me."
"this poured light gold with a 1""head average retention and when it left it look out of this world for a lager...a cool foamy/stickyness on the surface with lots of nice lacing forming. Smell is earthy hops and a hint of banana. Love that hops on the nose. Taste is a little dissapointing considering...appearance. Just doesn't go down very easy...mouthfeel is nice but there's no lingering good tastes...this is overrated here....would it be a travesty to say that Velas Hellas from Gatlinburg is as good? Sorry I know this Brewery has been doing this since 1040 but I thought it would be better. Good but not fantastic by any means...other than it's appearance."
"D - Smooth"
"The pour into my rarely-used pokal raises a sweet-looking off-white two-finger head that has lots of large bubbles slowly bursting through the foamy surface. It falls slowly, leaving sticky lace on the sides of the glass. Below, the body is hazy, deep golden yellow. It's about the appearance of a filtered wheat, even at the thinnest part of the glass. The nose smells of sweet grains, and just a tad less noble hop aroma than expected from a pils. Clean and mild. The taste is the same way. I've enjoyed Helles before, but there's just not much to be said. It's got a lot more taste than most macros, and, unlike them, no off flavors, but this just doesn't do it for me. Medium-light in the mouth, with high carb. I won't be seeking this out, my fav. Helles is Penn's."
"Drinkability: A good lager, I haven't tried specifically munich helles lager, but this is refreshing and flavorful for a lager."
"D: Very quaffable. Would go well with most food. Good enough beer for its style, but nothing to make me say ""wow""."
"D: Highly drinkable lager. Crisp and refreshing. It's really too bad this is not more widely available and/or marketed. It could convert a lot of macro drinkers to craft beer drinkers."
"Golden-yellow color with a frothy white head. Medium-high carbonation. Aromas of malt, honey, and hops. The flavor is dominated by sweet malt with a crisp juicy texture, slightly chewy. Hops and malt are well balanced. Honey and light fruit flavors upfront, with bread and malt flavors in the finish. Overall, this is enjoyable and an excellent example of the style."
"Outstanding - however, the sweetness means this is not the best option for a refreshing, quaffing lager."
"received in a trade with finite (thanks). thought it was a hefe until just before reviewing. so not the style i was expecting, still a nice beer overall."
"From a 500 mL German bottle, 11.8P OG, 24 IBUs. It pours a fairly carbonated pale gold, topped with two fingers of crackly white head that retains well and deposits loads of lacing. A few floaties keep it from a five for appearance. Smells lemony/grassy and metallic at first, sweet, with an increasing doughy character; very smooth and appealing, but not very aromatic. The flavor is bright and gently malt forward, with doughy/biscuity and grainy malts that yield a light sweetness, and lemony/grassy/herbal hops that balance nicely and contribute a mild bitterness. The body is fairly light, well-carbonated and silky smooth, with a light bitterness in the short finish. Quite a drinkable beer, and one that is very clean and well-brewed. A great helles that is hard to savor because it drinks so easily - definitely recommended. Overall - 4.25"
"For several months now I've been indulging myself with IPA, DIPA, Stouts, IRS, Porters, and Pale Ales. This weekend I decided to try some German lagers such as this one. Poured a clear blond hue with a small frothy one inch white head. The head last throughout the drink and left a good amount of lacing. The aroma was faint yet my wife and I got a whiff coliander, light sweet bread, fresh cut hay and strangely enough clean barnyard (weird). The flavor was lightly malty sweet from start to finish, nice fizzy carbonation, clean and crisp. Overall, we like this brew alot and glad we picked it up. The drinkability is easy and very refreshing."
"D: This is a session beer that goes well with almost any food. That said, there is nothing profound about this beer which will enable it to stand out in my mind."
"This one complements my Weihenstephan 0.5 glass very nicely. It pours a light golden color with a thick white head that leaves some lacing. It smells sweet, of malt and honey. Tastes sweet as well, not too sweet though. The malt and honey type taste are evident, so are the slight hint of hops. This is a very light and crisp brew. Very easily drinkable."
"Pours with a two-finger white head that fades to a ring leaving no lace. Clear amber color. Light bodied and light carbonation. Nose is lemony. Starts with some sweetness, mild flavor, hoppy/lemon finish. $2.99 for a 500ml bottle from John's Grocery Iowa City,IA."
"D: Extremely drinkable. All day long..."
"D: What can I say, its very drinkable, but nothing special"
"Recommended, but I like Weihenstephaner's wheat beers better."
"D- exceptionally drinkable, goes down super easy, tastes good, would be even better off tap, a reasonably priced (about 2.50 for a bomber) session beer, would buy/recomend"
"Pourks pale yellow with white head which dissipates quickly. Not a strong aroma, faint malts. Flavor is malty sweetness balanced nicely with hop flavor and bitterness. Medium-thin mouthfeel with a very clean finish. This would be a great session beer, but price is a little prohibitive. I enjoyed this one."
"Drinkability is dangerous."
"Drinkability: This seems like a standard lager, but it's still much better than the american macro version, but I still don't love it."
"Drinakbility: Just what you look for in a lager of this type. Nice blend if flavors without anything being too forward."
"Very drinkable. One that I hope to find on-tap some day and will probably find it even more drinkable in-session."
"Possibly skewed because I'm an 'ale' person, but I thought if anyone would make a helles/lager that I liked, it would be Weihenstephaner. Apparently you just can't pull that much flavor out of those ingredients."
"This is clean, bright, refreshing and so very, very balanced."
"D: A great hot day beer, really refreshing and not too terrible tasting."
"This beer pours a clear golden yellow with a decent white head that dissipates to a thin film without much lacing. The smell is sweet and malty, crisp and clean. The taste is also malty up front but has enough hops to balance out the flavor There is a good mouthfeel, a little on the thick side for what it is but still quite good. Overall a great beer to tailgate or cool down with in the summer."
"Pours a pale yellow with a sticky white head. Aroma is grassy malt and a faint smell of hops. This is a really good smelling lager. Taste is biscuity with a slight amount of citrus and hops. Overall, this is a world class lager from ""The world's oldest brewery""."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied, mildly sweet and like candy with a crisp bite."
"Cheers!"
"A very easy-to-drink, simple, and thirst-quenching lager."
"D: Not bad, but not my cup of tea, er... I mean beer. Sure, this stuff goes down like water, and I could pound them all night, but why would I want to? Gimme something with more taste."
"Tastes like a pure,classic, German, Helles Lager. Very well balanced hops and malt with a nice refreshing hop bitterness and slightly spicy malt to it as well. Perfectly balanced. The only complaint I have, the beer doesn't have a whole lot of finish. That said, this appears to be intentional for this style, as it goes very well with food, and is an excellent thirst quencher (but still complex) on a hot day."
"D- perfect the ultimate easy drinker with tons of hop undertones to add to the complexity. Perfectly balanced perfectly refreshing. The ultimate bier in one of my favorite styles"
"Quenching and pleasant."
" Nota bona: I looked on the label and read the words : ""Cont. Malt Liqour, 12 FL. OZ."" I about died when this happened. I was like oh I guess there is no reasoning to this universe. Then I found the beers style listed on here and was releaved. Keep on rockin' in the free world."
"Very enjoyable beer, as usual another great beer from Weihenstaphener."
"Dry and bitter with an offputting musky flavor to it. Not something I will try again. Weihenstephaner is usually fantastic, but this is more than disappointing."
"Beers like this make me wonder why things like BMC exist. Its severely drinkable, simple, inoffensive...but delicious. I think you could give this to a BMC devotee and a light might turn on (or off)."
"This is a extremly drinkable Lager that was very enjoyable."
"Prost! MK"
"Drinkability - this is decent, not really great. It goes down easy, and is sessionable."
"Pours a typical lager yellow (same color as Bud), with a small white, head that fades fast. Leaves some lacing on the glass. More prominent smell than Bud, mild hops aroma. The taste is much better and more complex than American Macro lagers. Starts out with a mild hops taste. As you drink it, a malt flavor is more prominent in the finish. Nothing exciting here, basically a lager beer with stronger, better taste and a bit of complexity. Good with food and would be a good session beer. Mouthfeel is about right for a lager (a bit thin)."
"This pours a clear yellow gold with a medium sized head. Nice ,but nothing really special looking. The smell is something special. Full of malt, lemon, floral aromas, and a bakery yeast that's awesome. The taste is crisp and clean with a malty background with floral, citrus, and mild hop flavors. The m/f is light and very well mixed. This is a very good beer that could be my new ""lawnmower"" beer. Cheers."
"Extremely drinkable. I could definitely drink a lot of these in a row, especially out on a hot summer day."
"Single bottle bought from the Fayetteville Harris Teeter. The code ""8024"" is printed on the back label."
"This is one of the finest examples of the Bavarian Helles style I have tasted."
"The beer poured a straw gold color topped by a white colored light head fed by champagne bubbles. This looks similar to a fine Czech Pils. The nose is very subtle. Slightly earthy, a little grassy hops followed by just a touch of caramel malt. The taste is classic Bavarian lager. The earthy hops come to the front of the flavor, followed by the light caramel I found in the nose. The hops lend a mild bitterness, and just a bit of herbal flavor. Nice light mouth feel, very soft on the palette. This is a highly drinkable beer, especially here in the summer months.The beer poured a straw gold color topped by a white colored light head fed by champagne bubbles.

"Bottom line: This is *superb* Lager that deserves your attention!"
"Looks like a light lager but wait, there's favor, and no skunky smell. Did somebody forget the corn, rice and green/clear bottles? Looks straw yellow and smells of pale, slightly bready/biscuity malts. Taste is sweet with a slighty citrus bitter edge. This reminds me of many other euro and macro lagers, but only in the sense that they tried to be this beer, but messed thigns up along the way. Best lighter lager I've had to date, a pleasure to drink on a hot day."
"D: Fairly drinkable. I've used this beer in chili to good results, and served cold it's very refreshing and enjoyable. Not my favorite style, but for the style this is pretty good."
"D - Very drinkable. This is my first Helles, but it is a my very first great tasting lager for sure. Absolutely an awesome brew, this is what an American Lager should taste like. Highly recommend, I'm glad a finally got ahold of one of these."
"A nice change of pace from the more heavy American and Belgians I have been having lately."
"This brew pours a pale golden color. The head is small and recedes quickly into thin lacing. The aroma is what it should be for a helles lager: mildly malty with a hint of saaz. It is actually quite amazing how the aroma is so vocal with such mild tones. The taste is refreshingly malty. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is one of the best ""small"" beers I have had to date. It is very refreshing, interesting and easy to drink, and leaves me wanting more."
"Poured a pale golden color with massive white puffy head. Smell is of sweetish malt and pleasant. Taste is full of firm malt and gives a nice crisp taste sensation. Finish is more of the maltiness and leaves a very refreshing feeling in the mouth. Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"This is one beautiful lager. Practically perfect, it's got an interesting taste (but with a lager smoothness) and is highly, highly drinkable. Wow."
"Yum. An amazing and delightful refreshment: nice and crisp. Picked a growler of this up at Half Time beer store. It pours a light golden color, with a foamy white head. Smells faintly sweet. The taste is very understated and pleasant, simple yet delightful. A near perfect lager. And a definite session beer for a hot sweaty night. Search out and enjoy."
"D: An average beer for me. Impressed by how far beer has come. To me this is worth trying just to have something that puts a spin on the usual beer. I wouldnt pay too much for it though. Something different but not outstanding, but could drink plenty of these in one sitting."
"Pours out a brilliant golden color with a white head that, although not that thick, leaves tremendous lacing. Appears to have minimal carbonation in the glass. Smells of bready malts and spicy German hops with a subtle hint of pear cider. The hops run the show in the nose. The malt is very clean, nutty and bready, with a spicy hop kick at the end. Just a perfect helles lager. Very smooth mouthfeel and softly carbonated. A flavorful session helles lager. Awesome."
"What a disappointment. I grabbed this bottle thinking it was the famous Hefeweizen (label is very similar) and figured this would be similarly tasty, but I was woefully mistaken. I would recommend avoiding this one."
"Overall- a HUGE disappointment. This is beer?! C'mon now, little flavor with no b@lls."
"Perfect sessioner, I'd say, no bitterness, so no hop intrigue, but hey - sometimes this just hits the spot. Lovely."
"highly drinkable, will try again I know from previous tastes this beer is better than this. Having said that, all those samples were within 50 miles of the brewery!"
"The mouthfeel was mild and slightly dry. Quite light. Refreshing. Overall, this was very drinkable. Not aggressive with a very crisp feel and a nice balance. I'm certainly glad I have another one in my fridge. A beer that goes nicely with food and beyond."
"Refreshing, nonetheless. I stick to the other Weihenstephan offerings."
"I picked this up by mistake thinking it was the hefe! I was pleasantly surprised though, as it went great with my pizza. It pours with perfect clarity, a straw gold color with a medium white head. The aroma is vaguely sweet with a hint of spicy hops in the background. These two elements switch places in the taste. A nice classically German hoppiness presides for the majority of the taste. Not a huge amount of bitterness, but filled with a grassy, florally element. There is a nice malty sweetness that provides a counterpoint to the hops. This is a very crisp and clean beer with a beautifully dry finish. The mouthfeel is crisp and prickly from a fair amount of carbonation. It goes down easy so it's fairly drinkable. A very nice, crisp lager that goes down very easily."
"Overall: Drink this one fresh to get it at its very best and it is unbeatable!! However, I do find that older samples soon turn sweet and into a bland corny mess that tastes like an American macro, why is that I wonder? As this is one of my favorite German Helles Lagers, I cannot believe that I never reviewed it before now. Hey maybe I just enjoyed drinking it too much to sit down and write about it. Well now that I do, its fair to say that (when fresh at least) this is a damned fine excellent brew - solid stuff that I could drink all day. An Original-Original for sure."
"Mouthfeel is fluffy, soapy, and bubbly. Very frothy, almost... cappuccino-foam-like feel. Actually nice. Overall fairly drinkable- light, nothing overpowering to the palate. But I wouldn't go after this that often."
"Drinkability is outstanding, top marks! I greatly enjoyed many beers like this during my time in the USAF in Germany. A fine example such as this just makes me homesick for more."
"Malt dominated drinks are probably not for me , however I think that this is a touch above average"
"Hop in the aftertaste, but a little stale. It lowers the drinkability."
"Weihenstephaner beers have this subtle complexity which I cannot explain. I guess thats what happens when your the oldest active brewery in the world."
"An outstanding representation of the helles style, though a little on the hoppy side compared to many. It's very accessible to macrobrew drinkers and does a nice job getting folks interested in ""better beer"". Also makes a great, if somewhat pricey, session beer."
"Bought a six at HY-Vee in CF last week. This one's a good 'all purpose' drinker. Pours nice, not a lot of foaming. Some lacing. Taste was smooth with a very mild sour yeast flavor with good hop and malt balance. They must use some of their hefeweizen yeast in this because it had a similar tartness, just scaled down. I enjoyed this one and I'd buy it again. I can't say it will change your life, but definately worth trying."
"The color is a cloudy golden with not much in the way of head or carbonation. The aroma is of light doughy malts with yeast smell mixed in. The taste is more of the same, classic Munich malt taste with some grain taste towards the finish. Yeast flavors accenuate the malt body and provide a mild fruitness. I found this to be a good session beer, but still a little bit below the quality I was expecting. Then again, I don't know how long this has been sitting on the shelf. I bet it's truly excellent on-tap in Germany."
"This straw colored brew poured a nice head with decent head retention. Nose is malty and perhaps a slight hint of a fruit. Taste starts with malts but is dominated by a subtle hop finish. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth. Overall this is a tasty little lager that I would recommend!"
"Didn't think I'd ever like a helles this much. Well done."
"overall: please note that this is far from my favorite beer. it's far from my favorite styles of beer. however within the style, i must rate this beer high. it's fantastic!"
"D = Great. Relatively cheap for such a great beer."
"Opinion: This is a super flavorful beer! I just love this style, because you have a beer that is as light as a Budweiser sitting in front of you that has so much to offer your palate! They are beautiful when well crafted, and this is one of them. I believe that there must have been something up at the brewery when they bottled this batch, because it seems under carbonated. There was a good amount of off-gas when I opened the cap, so I don't think that it leaked...besides the fact that it still tastes good. I will definitely be drinking this beer again...and probably review it again because I think that this bottle is an anomaly."
"A you can guess, it's pretty light bodied. While I prefer something with a little more substance (or, in the case of my beloved porters and stouts, a LOT more), this would be quite nice to quaff in quantity on a hot day. Apparently the world's oldest brewery makes a lawnmower beer!"
"This is an excellent beer. Coming from the oldest brewery in the world, it should be. They must be doing something right to have stayed in business since 1040. Anybody up for a Weihenstephaner millenium celebration in about 35 years?"
"Final Thought: Well, Weihenstephaner makes another great beer but it could increase the flavor of this one."
"Great bang for the buck beer."
"Clear bright gold with bridal white head and columns of carbonation. Nose was a bit bready, but simply the lack of a corn smell in a beer this color is enough to make it a winner. Taste was light and smooth. This is the answer to those macro folks who ""can't taste their beers"" because it has just enough crispness, just enough hop bite to make it a quenching, if a tad boring, and satisfying beverage. The mouthfeel is a little too thin, but never watery, for my taste. Consuming these should not be an issue for anyone who even remotely likes beer."
"This one pours a clear blonde color with a white head that sticks around for a short time. No real lacing going on. The aroma is of light malt and mild hops. The taste follows the nose. It has the flavor of light malt with a light hop aftertaste. A little bit of a dry finish. The mouthfeel is average. medium carbonation with a dry finish. It's a semi-drinkable beer. I wouldn't stop anyone from trying it but I don't know if I'd recommend it. It's a good beer but there is nothing about it that stands out and makes it special."
"Pours a clear pale yellow (almost the shade of budwieser) with a nice white head that dissapates quickly...pretty average looking lager. Smell is bready malt with a fruity yeast background, wasnt really expecting the fruity, banana like smell from this lager. Taste is pretty standard for a munich helles, very clean palate with a bread-like malt accent and a light fruity banana flavor hiding in the background. The finish is clean and crisp, the mouthfeel is thin and its moderately carbonated. The drinkability is pretty high, this is a somewhat flavorful beer thats extremely drinkable, a pretty good offering from brauerei Weihenstephan but not really up to the standard of their wheat beers."
"Pours a very light golden color with a finger of white head a little bit of lacing. Lots of carbonation bubbles visible even after a few minutes in the glass. Clean biscuitlike malt aroma with a little bit of floral hops are present in the nose. The taste is more of the same biscuity malts, with a mild citric hoppiness joining in at the end. The extremely clean and crisp finish and the simple malt goodness makes this a very refreshing brew. As someone who prefers ales, I must say this is an excellent beer, and probably the best lager I've had the pleasure of tasting."
"Overall: Kind of cliched, but this is sort of the grandaddy of good lagers; well worth seeking out on tap; it's even better than in bottles."
"Drinkability: Although I'm not a big lager fan, this is a beer that fits the bill to a Tee; a good one for a summer's day at the beach"
"A pretty good German Brew. Hay like golden colour, that pours out clear with medium carbonation and a decent head. Left a touch of lace around the glass as the head came down. Odors of malt and alcohol were detected, as were the faint scent of baked bread. Flavor was straighforward and crisp, with overtones of malt, yeast and hops. A very good example of German beers brewed to the 1516 Purity Law. Worth a try."
"Pours a very clear light golden color with a very tall white fluffy head. Appears very effervescent. Smells of grassy hops, slight citrus notes (lemony) and sweet, toasted sugar aromas. Taste is more citrus-y than the smell, with a prominent lemon flavor that melds with some hop bitterness and a very slight malty flavor backing it up. Extremely light and refreshing...finish is crisp and clean with a faint hop bitterness lingering. Very drinkable, with a light body and high carbonation."
"Notes: Although I'm not a lager drinker, I do enjoy SA Boston Lager with large meals. I could see Weihenstephaner becoming it's replacement as it is a much more balanced, not as hoppy, alternative."
"This beer may be classified as a Munich Helles Lager, but it tasted extremely similar to a Breznak I had recently. Same floral hop aroma, same average head retention, and possibly the same effects of not being quite fresh enough. This last point may have led to the comparison - I can't remember what it's like to have fresher than the one I just had, but in any case, this and Breznak are in the same beer category in my book. In fact, I bought this thinking it was the Hefeweißbier (which I really felt like) but didn't read the label properly and realised upon the first sip (and spurious clarity) that it wasn't a Weissbier at all. And to think, I broke one of my good Weizen glasses while getting it out, and I wasn't even having a Weissbier after all! In any case, a good beer, better consumed fresh, but doesn't satisfy when you're after a real Weizen. Good thing I'm following it up with a Weihenstephaner Dunkel..."
"Pours an effervescent clear pale blonde color topped with a pure white head. Looks very refreshing and inviting. Clean aroma of grass and grain, very slight floral note. Good smell, but a little weak. Taste is very smooth and clean. Hops and malt are equally married, beginning to end. A refreshing lemony hop jolt is well backed by sweet and biscuity malt. Some grassiness is present and dances with faint fruit. A hint of clove or some other spice is present as well. Perfect carbonation balances the creamy mouthfeel. Extremely drinkable and refreshing lager."
"Clean tasty refreshing, authentic German Lager! Nothing more to say... pick some up!! You will love it!!"
"edit 2/28/2005: After abstaining from this brew for a few days, I decided to give another go with the remaining half of my 6 pack. For some reason I enjoyed this much more and have adjusted my marks accordingly (I would still recommend the Boulevard Bob's '47 over this if accessible and in season)."
"poured out a yellow beer with much carbonation, 2 finger head.Mild grainy smell slightly sweet smell.Tastes pretty standard,wayy better then a macro lager but along the same lines,clean ending beer. Mouthfeel is pretty boring,average. Not a bad brew though, wouldnt mind knocking a few back once in a while."
"Pretty nice, but I keep losing interest in it. Took me a while to finish it off."
"Verdict: Not bad for what it is. It's not especially complex or flavorful, but it's a nice, easy-drinking, malty lager. I'm not sure it's worth paying import price for it all the time, but it's a nice beer all the same."
"Pours a lightly hazed straw gold color with a thin white head. Aromas of bready pale malts, a light yeastiness and faint hopping. This helles is going to be swayed towards the malty side. It is very crisp and tasty, malty and smooth. Lightly astringent from moderate hopping that comes through in the finish paired with a faint citrusiness which makes for a very drinkable lager. The yeast has its own flavor profile, which is faintly chalky and nutty. It actually is pretty well balanced. Not as malt-dominant as I thought from the aroma. A finely crafted helles in every sense. Recommended for any occasion when a lighter, yet flavorful lager is in order."
"Drinkability - good session beer, good cross-over beer. I'll have to try a sixer this summer."
"I admit this is a hard-to-appreciate style for me. This beer is spot-on for all the requisite characteristics, except the head. But it still seems bland to me (and disappointing because Weihenstephaner makes my favorite hefeweizen, without any doubt)."
"Drinkability- That damn metallic flavor did it in for this beer. Even though the taste eventually went away 1/2 through the bottle, it still ruined it for me."
"Poured into the glass with a small head of foam, almost non exsistant. The aroma was refreshing, reminded me of Paulaner's Orginal Munich Lager. The taste came with an orangish bitterness upfront, a tangy middle, and a subtle dry finish. Very nice mouthfeel, the carbonation wasn't overwhelming. Pretty big bragging rights for being around since 1050. I always wanted to try something from the world's oldest beer making establishment, I wasn't disappointed."
"Light and crisp, this is nice little beer. I've heard that it's much better in Germany, where the bottles haven't been sitting on the shelf for 8 months before being bought, and this Lager doesn't really seem as fresh as Weihenstephaner's other beers. Still worth a try, though."
"-Oelergud"
"Pours clear gold under a thick 1.5 finger white head that lingers well but can't muster any lace. A smooth malty nose wafts up from the brew, mild to the point of sublime, with nothing but the purest barley tone. The mouth is light and very prickly. The taste typifies the style, mild and smooth barley malt flavors, with just a touch of sour to add some zest. There is no hoppy bitterness, but a flowery presence starts to grow as the sip count increases and the beer warms, adding a hint of spice to the aftertaste. This is a good, pleasant, if not spectacular beer."
"This brew has a darker straw/golden color clear body. Nice white foam head on top. Light sweet malt scent, hint of flowery hops. Sweet bready malt taste, kiss of hops, hint of lemon zest. Light/med bodied brew, very nice and refreshing. About as good as this style of beer can be done."
"Pours that gold straw everyone keeps talking about. No murkiness-no head --minimal carbonation -no lace either. Smell is malty, grassy, herby and typical of that Euro-lager type of taste- a small bit of nuttiness too. Taste is almost the same as the smell except it finishes wet on the palate but in a nice way which helps mouthfeel and drinkabilty.Overall, the other brands I mention are better for this style but I would still recommend this one."
"It is quite refreshing, but it lacks a little in the flavor dept."
"Medium bodied, crisp and clean in the mouth with billowing carbonation. Flavors float all over the place. A great beer anytime of the day."
"This is a tremendously drinkable, thirst-quenching, refreshing Munich Helles Lager. Because I'm not a big fan of noble hops, the gentle flavor and light body is just what the doctor ordered. 'Der Rasenmaherbier' indeed. While not nearly the equal of their hefe weizen, Weihenstephaner Original is still pretty good beer."
"Very drinkable, can't even imagine if it was on tap somewhere near me. Great beer, defines German lager."
"Pours a light straw color, with a big white head that fades quickly to a fine lace. Smell is predominantly sweet malt, maybe a little light grain. The taste is sweet and malty, but still very light. Some hops follow, with a short, dry finish. Mouthfeel is good, a very nice, light summer's brew. Very good drinkability, could definitely be a good session beer, and one good for converting macro drinkers."
"notes: a good drinkable beer.. but that is what I expect from a helles.. it didn't do anything special for me... I'd probably opt for the one of my good ol' munich lagers next time"
"12 ounce bottle, with no freshness information. poured light amber/straw. Amost an olive oil like greenish hue. White soft creamy head, leaving lacing. Nose is bready,yeasty, also some pepper detected. Medium bodied, clean malt notes, not much hoppyness, but it does finish dry. Would go great with any summery foods. Fine session brew."
"Not the most pleasant of aftertastes lets the overall beer down, but it is another solid Weihenstephaner offering."
"A good beer for drinking with light snacks like potato chips or Doritos®."
"This is a most pleasing helles. The style may be simple, but the beer is very enjoyable. A good down-to-earth beer that can be enjoyed by almost anyone."
"Taste: Initially slightly sweet from the crisp maltiness, with a nice full mouthfeel. Elegantly hopped, with a bone dry finish and lingering light bitterness. Characteristic house yeast is an interesting addition to this lager. Quite nice overall."
"I will make sure I am picking up the right beer next time,"
"I think I've found my fall back brew. This is one of the easiest drinking beers out there with a nice crisp taste. Poured out a light gold color with a nice amount of carbonation that went away after a while. Smell consisted of some hops, slight yeasty aromas, a little bit of malts, and a hint of sweetness to it. Taste consisted of a dough-like flavors blended in with some hop bitterness and an ever so slight taste of lemons in there. Finishes on the sweet side a little, but not overpowering because the hop bitterness balances it out very well. I could drink these any time of the year. Crisp lager that goes down well and yet has a nice full body to it. I'm sold."
"This beer is clear with much less head and a smell that is hard to quantify. The finish is pretty dry. This is a good tasting beer. The taste is still kind of bready with fruit, maybe pear. I find it a little light tasting, but I am used to drinking strong full bodied beer."
"Clear gold on the pour. Pretty big, fluffy head. Smells lightly of malty grass, and a tinge of hops. Light and crisp flavored, not meant to be a big beer. Still, above average for a lager. Their hefe-weiss and korbinian are much better, although I have no complaints about this."
"A fairly decent lager, goes down easy"
"Brightly clear, light golden dulled yellow color with a thin white frothed cap that faded off quickly. Smell has a nice crisp and clean herbal essence with a soft, fresh bread roll dough. Quite nice, a firm crispness and sweet doughy breading for its nose, which really comes together as it warms. Taste is a nice crisp and clean hop, some dried herbal variants float around that are light and airy with a nice and firm bread dough sweetish malt backing. Totally reminds me of the dough used for white bread rolls or cresent rolls. Feel is a bit lighter on the body but the super clean, super crispness makes up for the lack there of. Kinda sweet and very smooth, quick crispness at first with a lightly dry breadish souring finish thats nice. A pretty darn good Helles thats easy, clean, crisp, and drinkably good. Yum."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden hue with a sizeable foamy head. Beautiful nose of floral hops and a hint of yeast. Surprisingly thin, almost watery body. More floral hops on the palate, balanced by the yeast and a touch of malty sweetness, with a very subtle biscuity character towards the finish. Very little aftertaste. Great German-style lager"
"Drinkability: Oh yeah. Maybe the easiest quaff I've had all year. I could see myself buying cases of this if I can find a place. Excellent. Maybe even moreso than their hefe. Oh shucks, they both rule!"
"John"
"Very drinkable brew. A superb lager."
"Pours a very clear pale straw color with a very creamy dense white 2-finger head. The smooth smell of biscuity malt and well balanced hops will start your mouth to watering. Wow! The taste again is smooth yet fairly complex despite the basic four ingredients with more of the malt and a bit more pronounced hop than the aroma revealed, and tapers into a light dry bitter finish. The mouthfeel is silky in this light to medium bodied beer. This is nice! Superb! Prosit!"
"Overall Impression: I thought I picked up the HefeWeissbier, and so was very confused when I started this. In comparison to its cousin, this just doesn’t seem right at all. On it’s own merits as a lager, it’s well balanced and has some mildly interesting qualities. A good summer thirst quencher, session beer, or a decent beer to help educate the masses, but nothing I’ll seek out in the future. Worth a karma point, but didn’t rock my boat."
"I wanted something special for my 300th review, I have had everything available in the local stores that is special. I decided to try this lager because it has been really nice the last few days here in No. Cal. I thought a lager might go down well. Pale straw color that had a white head, retention was minimal lacing sparse. Aroma was weak but malt sweetness could be detected. Clean smooth malty base with minimal hopping. Some bitterness was detectable and I think some lemony notes. As far as lagers go it was refreshing which is basically what I look for. I can see putting a away a few of these on days like this, but then again, I'd rather have an Anchor. Drinkable if in the right situation."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Weihenstephaner Original was pretty tasty and went down smoothly and quickly. Another top-notch brew by a world-class brewery."
"Appearance: Golden sunshine hue with a nice frothy white head specks of lace form as the head dwindles. Aroma: Nice bready cereal grains, yeast mix of dough sweentess with Hallertau hops. Taste: Clean tasting cereal grains, noble hops are here as well very balanced. Mouthfeel: A bit thin but decent carbonation is here. Drinkability: Very nice helles straight outta Munich, classic in all regards."
"Note: Being a lover of this style, I was a little disappointed, $8.65 a six pack? It should be the second coming. It wasn't. Buy Spaten for two bucks less."
"Very clear with a frothy white head of foam. Lightly carbonated. Fresh aroma of earthy grassy and slightly lemony grains. Slight metallic taste, sweet grainy body with a decent bite. Cant get over the metallic taste. Its ruining the enjoyment here. Other than that this seems like a very clean and highly drinkable lager beer. Not as crisp as a hoppy pils, but more flavorful than your regular premium American lager. I will have to sample this one again."
"Cast and mold for a light euro lager, I just wish more domestic craft brewers would add some of the lesser known German styles to their lineups, but I digress. This brew pours a pale gold with a scant brilliant white head. The aroma is a wonderful amalgam of herbal and spicy hops (Hallertau on parade!!), grain, and some light malt. Balance is the hallmark of this brew. Herbal hops, simple sugar maltiness and a slight breadiness are combined beautifully. Spot on for style...any maltier and it'd be a Dortmunder, any hoppier a Pilsener. Sign me up for a keg! Prosit!"
"From the oldest brewery in the world - and their experience shows. Aroma: A mild citrus, lemony, with a hint of floral/fruity bouquet, followed by a sweet malted nose. Taste: Good carbonation, just-right body, kept from over-sweetness by some citrus hop bite, biscuit malt and perfect yeast. Oh, my gosh! Where has this beer been? The finish features a light, perfectly dry, silk-glove slap from alcohol and a lingering hoppy finish. Did I mention this is the best Lager I have ever tasted? Why has no liquor store I have ever been in not featured this beer? And only $2.69 for 1 pint, .9 oz.! Around $7 for a sixpack. If you havent tried it  go find some now!"
"Update  I first reviewed this in 2004 with a 2003 vintage so thought that I would re-review it with a 2005 bottle. Im glad that I did. I got a much better head than the original review so raised the Appearance from 3 to 4."
"paid $7.99 for a 6 pack."
"This lager pours a very pale, clear yellow, with just a minimum of white headiness. It has a characteristic lager smell: a touch of citrus mixed with a good balance of sweet malt and a foundation of light hops. The taste is mellow and lightly refreshing, and there's a hint--just a hint--of ginger. The mouth feel is clean and sparkling. The one complaint is that it is farily expensive; hence only average on the drinkability scale."
"Light golden and-well, very lagery. A soft blanket of white head fades quickly to a whisper. Aromas are soft with barley and sweet malt featured. Crisp and refreshing in the mouth with fairly bold flavors for the style. Sweet grain and freshly baked bread come to mind. A true to the style brew, yet overpriced in our market. Paid 3.50for the pint+ bottling. I can get the Hefe for Less!!"
"This beer pours a clear gold color. A thin white head goes to the top but quickly fades away. The aroma is a bit thin, mainly malt and hops. The taste is crisp but also a bit thin and matches the aroma. It is quite drinkable but it seems to be missing something. Over all, slightly above average."
"Light gold color, small head. Aroma is a little chemical, but there is also vanilla and yeast. A lighter bodied Dortmunder, more largerish in taste. Light malts and hops. Mild flavor, not very complex. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"The flavor follows suit being more of a weakly hopped pilsener than a strongly yeasty/bready Helles. Still, let's not take anything away from this beer for what remains is truly a very fine lager beer. The clean, crisp taste and decent feel all speak well for it, and it is very drinkable and enjoyable. We ain't talking macro here, you know."
"This is a very light bodied, slightly crisp lager. Nothing spectacular, nothing offensive. One of these years, I'll learn to appreciate pilseners more. I liked Victory's Prima Pils & Dogfish Head's Prescription Pils, but most seem so bland to me."
"Pours a clear pale yellow with a decent sized fluffy head. Smells clean and crisp with minimal hop pungency. Taste is decent.. seems a bit thin. Not quite the pilsner hop bite I expected. Nicely quaffable beer. Would be a good session beer on a hot day.. Not a bad beer, just nothing too exciting, would drink but probably not spend the money to buy."
"I was dissapointed with this beer. It tasted a lot like Grolsh or St. Pauli Girl. It had a certain bitterness at the end that I did not enjoy. Everything else about it was okay. A decent head and a nice golden color. Just a bitterness like Grolsh and St. Pauli Girl that I do not like."
"Pours to a brilliantly clear straw color with a thick white head. It leaves a good amount of lacing when sipped down. It has a sweet malty, bread-like aroma. Very clean smelling. The flavor is malty and bready, with a bit of sweetness. It is a smooth, drinkable beer with a drying finish. A tasty, refreshing beer."
"Overall a solid pilsener."
"This beer is pristine. Crystal clear grape juice colored beverage. A nice sized white head forms and dissipates with about the same speed. Beautiful malt nose. Man I love it. Subtle notes of german hops as well. The mouthfeel is lacking carbonation. A little flat in my opinion. The flavor is a step down from the nose. The maltiness is subtle, almost too subtle.....and the hops impart a bitterness that is not overdone, but not very distinct either. Maybe the lack of carbonation is bugging me too much, but something just doesn't seem up to par here."
"Poured a thin head that dissapeared quickly leaving a nicely carbonated, clear, light amber lager. Aroma is of sweet malt accentuated by a light hopiness. The taste is a very nice blend of german hops with a clean finish. The body is light and this beer is full of carbonation that is very fine. Overall this beer is very drinkable and as it warmed a little it became more balanced and smooth."
"F"
"This brew was a highly carbonated pour which immediately filled my glass with a white head of small bubbles and a light transparent yellow orange color. Its aroma reminds me of fruits, but its taste is not fruity, but ... man I wish I was better able to describe my tastes. This one escapes me too. It is carbonated and smooth. Very drinkable and does not convey a high alcohol content. It was an easily drinkable beer."
"As good or better than, oh, say, 85% of all the lagers in the world."
"This is, without a doubt, one fine lager. Not much of an aroma from this one, but that seems to be the case with many lagers. Poured a very clear, golden color with minimal bubbles. This stuff is insanely easy to drink. I find it very hard to set the glass down once I've picked it up! Great beer for summer time also. If you like lager, definately give this one a try."
"This lager poured a bright clear light straw color from its brown pint bottle. The head was a fluffy white and did not last long. A thin ring of bubbles clung to the liquid line and left a little lace. The aroma was only of malt and fairly subtle. The taste was of malt with a hint of chocolate. There was a slight hop bite. The mouthfeel was light. All in all this is a good beer but not a great one. I could see drinking this with a bunch of brats and potatoe salad."
"($2.59 / 16 oz.)"
"I would get this again, but I prefer slightly more carbonation and a bit more dryness in the finish. Not bad, just not the best I've ever had."
"Pours a slightly hazy deep golden straw color with a puffy white head that quickly fades into a thin creamy lace. Nose is sweet cake-like malts with a bit of fresh cut lemon. Light to medium in body with a lively and crisp texture. Taste is sweet malt, lightly toasted bread, and fresh baked biscuits followed by some wonderful nutty yeasts and herbal hops with a touch of lemon. One of the finest lagers in the world."
"The smell is simple, lagery. Same in the front, with some slight fruitiness. The middle is sweetish, a little corny, finishing dry and a little metallic. After the Hefe, this is a little disappointing. There's nothing bad about it, but there's nothing special about it either. It's actually not far off a good NA."
"Notes..overall I am very dissapointed with my first taset of the worlds oldest brewery..this was a well brewed lager but very pedestrian..ordinary..give me a Paulaner lager or a Jahr hundert bier anytime."
"Poured a clear light yellow with medium foam. The smell was of a hoppy and citrus nature. The taste was of hops and a lemon citrus flavor, with a dry bitterness that I was not impressed at all with. This lager was not what I expected from this brewery."
"This one sits squarely atop Mt. Helles."
"I would have to consider this to be the best beer labeled as a (pale)lager that I have had (edging out Paulaner Original Munich and Samuel Smith's). This beer is so clean and refreshing, no trace of skunk. Pours a relatively ordinary looking, pale glass of beer. Smaller, foamy head, which dissapates rather quickly. Refreshing, almost flowery smell and taste. This may be the ""softest"" beer I've ever had. To me, this is the kind of beer that would have a shot at converting some of the masses if they ever tried it. Just as refreshing as an American lager or even a wheat beer, not bitter at all. Weihenstephan is top quality, all the way. I love their beer, and nobody does any better with wheat beer or lagers."
"Package reviewed was a pint brown longneck, which was labeled ""malt liqour", this perhaps in conformance to Texas' curious laws regarding beer."
"I rate this as my favorite lager in the world,incredible fruity aroma and taste.Not a wimpy beer by any stretch,the house yeast imparts a great floral-fruity aroma,love this beer in any form but am crazy about it on tapT.Weihenstaphan is one of the great breweries in the world for a reason."
"This one is worth a try, especially as transition beer, and with grilling ."
"Pours a clear gold with a persistent white head... it's supported by what looks to be a million tiny bubbles rising in a fast and steady steam. The glass is completely coated in white lace as you drink it. Aroma is beautiful... plenty of spicy noble hops, supporting the grainy malt. Flavor is very delicate, but impressive. Begins with a somewhat sweet cracker-like malt flavor, which is balanced nicely by the spicy herbal hops. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp. Even though this may not be a style that I seek out very often, this is an extremely well done bier."
"This is another excellent German Wheat beer. The cloudiness right away tells you so. The smell is enjoyable and refreshing. the taste is smooth, almost pillowy soft in texture. The hops are light. A well balanced flavour that speaks of genereations of craftsmanship."
"Served in a 500ml bottle. Poured a slightly hazy straw color with a small head that quickly disappeared. It had a light malty smell with a touch of sweet. It had a mild, slightly watered down taste. The mouthfeel was good with good carbonation. Overall, it was average and not worth trying again unless down to this or a macro. (One and done)"
"The beer pours a limpid light gold or straw color if you like with a blazingly bright white head that is meaningful in size, the lace thin clinging sheets to envelop the glass. The prototypal lager/Pils style nose, dominated by the malt, fresh and clean with a wisp of citrus, quite pleasing to the senses. Front is lightly sweet, the top wraithish, finish minimally acidic, the hops apropos for the style, droughty aftertaste that lingers on. Personally, my least favorite as it tends to be a tad to light in all categories, but trust me well worth the sample, and one fine beer especially here when you come in from the 115-Fahrenheit temperatures in the summer."
"clear dark yellow color, nice head and a little lace.  grainy aroma...no euro skunk.....wahooooooooo!!!     perfect lager mouthfeel; smooth and refreshing with a crisp finsh.  this may be the best lager i've ever tasted...soft malty/grain and mineral flavors with a nice hop accent in the end that melds with the crispness described above.  no need to overanylize this brew.  just enjoy...and contemplate why american lagers can't attempt to mimic this lager perfection.  damn good!"
"Intensely fruity aroma, reminds me of sour apples.  Medium-light body with a crisp feel.  Nice fruit flavor in the mouth is well, with malt sweetness underlying and little if any hop flavor.  Interesting beer, and pretty well balanced."
"Had this at the ""Ranke 2"" in Berlin. Wonderful beer. Paired nicely with my bean and sausage soup."
"Not very impressive. you'd think in 1000 years they could have come up with some better qualities. Golden color with medium carbonation, thin head and bland lager flavoring. Finish was somewhat weak as well, and there was hardly any flavor left by the end of the glass."
"Light gold, substantial, steady white head. Fresh bread, light grain and herbal hop aroma. Light, but assertive malt, spicy hop flavor. Continuous stream of bubbles generated from the bottom of the pils glass. Made an excellent fajita accompanyment, but would be equally satisfying alone. Wonderful drinkability...wish I had another. Classic German pilsener/lager."
"Clear, golden in color, with a bright white head that dies quickly. It does maintain a nice collar throughout the glass but the surface retains only whisps of foam. Outstanding aroma of bright, fresh, grainy, malty sweetness and a slightly herbal note, but without any distinct hops. The body is solidly medium and the carbonation level is moderate. The mouthfeel is crisp on the front of the tongue and filling at the back of the mouth. Starts with a bold malt note up-front - void of any hop character - that widens as it crosses the palate, then slowly reveals the presence of a gentle hop flavor. It finishes quickly at first, but creeps back in with a strong malt character and light hoppiness throughout the mouth . An interesting balancing act! A very distinct and unique beer brewed just outside of Munich. I see it as a strong version of a Munich helles rather than a Dortmunder-style export as the emphasis is on malt. It doesn't have the crispness of the Dortmunder beers. Still, one could argue it both ways. Exceptional!"
"Very pleasant peer.  Clear, golden color.  Herbal, continental aroma.  White head doesn't last long at all.  Mild maltiness, well balanced hop bitterness.  Yeast and toasted malt tastes."
"Yes my friend ""goindownsouth"" had this beer at his wedding, that is me and him had this beer.  We hid the good stuff in the car and slipped out to fill our ceramic steins (hey you gotta do what ya gotta do).  This is one of the best german beers I have tried, the aroma is there but not to heavy and even in ceramic you can observe the belgian lace it leaves. While I prefer a more hoppy beer this brew goes down very smooth and easy.  I will always remember it for that joyous occasion in PA...............PROST"
"This is one fantastic bier. Let me just go so far as to say this...this was the bier I had at my wedding. Enough said. It is light and crisp in the aroma department, and the head, like many good German biers do, fades to a lace. The first sip is incredible. There are slight hints of malt, grains and hops. Once at the bottom of the glass, there is anticipation for the next one. Perfect balance between aroma, flavor and drinkability. Best had in a ceramic half liter mug. This is a German staple. Prosit!"
"Light golden in hue and crystal clear as expected for a well - lagered brew.  The white head settles into a moderate layer that leaves a respectable lace. Soft grainy malt notes, with a mellow, well rounded sweetness in aroma.  The hop nose is mild, but green and herbal Hersbrucker is perceptible. Grainy, light bread and butter - like notes comprise the initial malt flavors, and residual pleasant and well calculated sweetness follows.  The hop bitterness is quite low, yet it provides enough foundation to prevent overbearing sweetness. This brew finishes expectedly sweet, but hop bitterness and lightly toasty Vienna malt emerge on the back on the tongue.  Weihenstephaner Original is a superbly balanced brew, and is a definitive example of the style."
"Pours an appealing shiny crystal clear golden/straw color. On the nose are aromas of spice and herbs. Slightly smooth but also slightly sticky mouth feel. The same on the palate, a spicy/peppery herbal hop-ness presents itself all the way though to the end. Very refreshing brew and easy to drinkgood brew"
"Clear dark yellow, small to medium bodied head that lasts for about one minute.  Just a touch of sharp aroma, mostly yeasty.  Medium impact flavor with nutty tones typical of many Bavarian brews.  Sustained malty flavors, just a hint of hop crispness.  Nice lack of flavor fade, nice fullness for style.  Nut-like taste circles the mouth before the swallow.  Nice beer, good impact for what its supposed to be."
"Well balanced malt and bittering/flavor hops. Mild malt, grain, hop nose. All the requisite lager characteristics with a little more depth. Well carbonated and drinkable."
"What a balanced beer.  The yeast....so perfect"
"Very solid - a quality lager."
"wow. that about says it. excellent."
"Notes: A lager in the raw, in its authentic natural form. This is the quintessential lager in the world. Bow down to the true lager and you will be one with beer. This is the best of the best hands down."
