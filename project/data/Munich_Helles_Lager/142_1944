Blonde and bright, nice and fizzy, refreshing, and really clean in the finish. Enjoying the hops on it, more than others, and the yeast is an absolute classic, often found skunked out in the market because of the green glass, but when fresh, this really is an excellent lager, distinct from the others in its class I think, and pleasantly flavorful for what it is. Often the best beer available at non craft spots.","StonedTrippin","Feb 15, 2015"

Light earthy spicy hop flavor with a light level of hop bitterness. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet rich malty mouthfeel. Nice flavorful malt forward beer.

Crisp golden color like a mildly tarnished golden wedding band with a cap of thick white head that kept pretty good retention and a touch of lacing. Smelled a lot of biscuit mix, freshly kneaded in the kitchen from several feet away as well as a touch of some citrus. The citrus came out more pronounced in the taste and mouthfeel, almost like a bit of lime zest and/or rind along the back of a bready malt. The mouthfeel was pretty light and just a very small touch of carbonation and spritz. Pretty good for a lager overall.","estlinska","Mar 14, 2013"

This beer had pretty good drinkability, it was smooth but the flavors couldn't quite hold my attention, but I could still drink two or three of these if in the mood. What I liked most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was true to style and just where it should be, no complaints there. What I liked least about this beer was the fact that it was a little skunky, I think that's from the green bottle, these older brewery's that still use green bottles need to get with the times. I might have this beer again if I was looking for a sessionable lager, but I would be more inclined to revisit this again on draft, it's got to go great with brats. This beer made for an Ok first impression for Spaten, and I would be interested to try more of their beers, but you can be sure that I will be a little leery if they are in the same green bottle, good brew, it just needs better packaging.","StoutHunter","Jun 05, 2012"

The nose is subtle but does have nice malt presence and subtle sourdough bread notes. The perfect golden-yellow is what you would expect from a Munich Helles and is nicely effervescent but not overly carbonated. For me it is moderately sweet on the front of the sip and leaves no off flavor aftertaste but finishes clean an d a bit wet.

It pours a very average light see-through typical color of what you would expect from a lager. It has the carbonation, lace and head of a lager, and the aroma of barley and hops you'd expect from a better lager. The beer to me resembles a malt liquor in terms of the bitterness and dryness and it is evident on the tongue for a strong mouthfeel. Not a bad brew, not a great brew.

The body is pretty light, with a very light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel.

Short finish of malt and hops. Crisp and dry, light bodied with average plus carbonation. I liked this quite a bit, even though I'm not partial to the sulfury hop notes.

Medium-bodied, has decent heft without giving up much of its ability to refresh. Hay, sweeter grains, corn, more floral here, teases out a small portion of apple, pear fruit and lemon peel. The carbonation is fine yet very active, few flavors soak in fully. The peppery spice remains as a subtle accent.

It's tasty and satisfying without being extreme, to me it's what a macro lager should be.

Mildly hopped, the dominate character is the subdued malt aroma. Hints of sulfur are to be found also. All in all a little too subdued for my tastes. However no flaws are detectable, the beer is just simply mild. When it comes to flavor Spaten delivers a slight yeast influenced sulfur quality paired with a mild hop bitterness. Malt quality seemed to be lacking in the flavor department. The mouth feel was thin and almost empty. A very drinkable beer, and in fact, in the Biergarten an absolute crowd pleaser.

Mostly a sweet taste from the hops, and a little thickness created from the malt. Not really a whole lot in the taste that stands out. Light mouthfeel. Overall, I could see having this beer on a summer afternoon, to relax, but if flavor was the issue, I would be going elsewhere. Its not to say that this is a bad beer, but its always hard to enjoy a lager, such as this one, for its flavor. Its stubborn, but I am still trying to get more into lagers.

Its not a powerful aroma, but it is pleasing, and much more appealing than most euro-macro lagers. The taste is composed of a nice malt flavor (pilsner) thats well balanced. The high carbonation gives the beer a spritzy quality that I could have done without. The finish has a mild shot of hop bitterness, along with a lingering semi-sweetness. Medium-light body.

It's nose is bright and welcoming with the hops and malt taking turns in appearance, but also working together to deliver a more concise presentation. The flavor follows along the same lines; and it's ""rich"" and exciting without being overly bold. It's malt is nicely grainy, and softly sweet with suggestions of Munich malts; and it acts as the perfect, supple, blanket on which to lay its grassy and spicy hop flavors. It's components are distinct, but always kept in check. Even it's bitterness is solid and clearly present, but not aggressively bold.

Some hops lurk in the background but largely serve to make the aroma more complex. The taste is fine. Fruity and sweet and just slightly bready, with a nice mineral-rich aftertaste.

3.87,5.2,3,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Drank this one in Venice, Italy. I'm wondering if this is the same beer as the Munchner Hell renamed for the export market? Clear, light golden with a light white head atop small to medium sized bubbles, with moderate to poor retention and nice lacing. Carbonation is moderate. Aroma is crisp and delicate with extremely clean ferment, freshly cut hay and distantly husky, sweet munich or carapils malt. Hops are minimal. Mouthfeel is brisk, wet, and crisp with a light to medium body and a sparkling character upon the tongue. Taste begins with some delicate earthy flavor hops up front, followed by husken pale malts, giving way to a well-balanced smooth, earthy bitterness with a lightly astringent husken character in the finish. A well-made delicate and pleasant brew.","Mitchster","Apr 27, 2003"
3.1,-15.8,3,3,3,3,3.5,"An easy-drinking eurolager that doesn't challenge, but is slightly above average for the style.","shirfan","Apr 04, 2003"
3.55,-3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"I liked the nice gold color to it medium sized head wich left a good lace that stayed for quite awhile.Very grainy,sweet minerally aroma very malt accented.Pretty clean tasting a hint of hops in the finish,a little thin in the mouthfeel department though.A pretty good lager better than the American giants but not as good of its European partners.","oberon","Mar 14, 2003"
3.41,-7.3,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Dazzlingly clear straw gold color with a large white head, decent carbonation, and lots of sticky lace. Aroma carries a slightly sweet bready note as well as mild hops, completely free of lager skunk, probably due to the brown glass bottle. Taste begins with a moment of sweetness, followed by solid malt flavors, finishes with lingering mildly bitter citrus hops. The finish is clean and a bit dry. Mouth feel is quite smooth and full, good for the style; the soft carbonation imparts only the slightest tingle. This beer is another textbook example of German brewing quality.","Pegasus","Mar 14, 2003"
3.16,-14.1,4,3,3,3,3.5,"The smell: lagerfonk-o-rama! Some bready grains.The front is lagerfonk with nice grains. The middle is metallic, some malt, sweetish. The finish is nicely bitter, but a little metallic. The fonk and metal definitely tame as the beer warms. Overall, this is a decent beer.","kbub6f","Mar 12, 2003"
2.48,-32.6,2,1.5,2.5,3,3.5,"Poured yellowish-golden with a thin, inconsistent head. Turned off by the smell, as it almost had a skunky characteristic. Can't say the taste was anything special either. It had a bready texture with more of a floral finish. Fortunately, it was very smooth going down. I expected better things, as I am typically a big fan of the Spaten line.","Hhawk06","Mar 04, 2003"
3.16,-14.1,4,3,3,3,3.5,"pours out a clear golden color with a fluffy one inch head which stuck quite nicely, leaving a nice lace down the glass. sweet malt and grain aromas, a bit of lemony hints with light hoppiness around the edges. light tastes of sweet grain, lemony malt...not really in the typical euro-lager fashion. more like a good quality american lager/pilsener rather than mimicking the euro style. rather light bodied. a hint of spiciness to the hops. clean and crisp finish. despite the green bottles, i neither smell nor taste any skunk. spaten premium comes off as a clean and non-descript easy drinking euro-lager. probably quite average in comparison to others within it's style, but easy drinking nonetheless.","budgood1","Feb 16, 2003"
3.74,1.6,3,4,3.5,4,4,"Very easily to drink could see this as a good summer BBQ beer if i had the cash!","Reidrover","Jan 31, 2003"
3.33,-9.5,4.5,4,3,4,2.5,"The medium-light body has a light, but rounded maltiness and a crisp, but faint bitterness from the hops. VERY little hop flavor. Smooth and sweet--this is a beer I've used to convert several macro guys to better beer. My complaints with it are that it's slightly too foamy and that it leaves a slight sourness in the finish, which lingers unpleasantly. I've had this beer on draft at the Bavarian Grill, where they seem to take good care of their beers, and it's better there--firmer and less prone to souring on the finish. Someday I'll try it in Munich and have a definitive answer :)","TXHops","Jan 30, 2003"
3.85,4.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Blinding gold, ultra translucent, small white head, poor retention, decent lace. Slightly hay-like, grassy, very quiet spiciness, the malt is solid but ultimately an unimpressive nose. Very tasty palate, grassy-hay, a murmur of peppery-spice, decent malt undertones, slightly crisp... refreshing. Simple and light pleasant mouthfeel, easy to drink and enjoyable. Id recommend it for a cross-over beer or for hot summer days. While this is not the best Helles lager, Spaten Premium is a decent and enjoyable beer.","bditty187","Jan 08, 2003"
3.55,-3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"As I always beat on lagers and pilsners, I must own up to finding this one quite pleasant to quaff, as fair is fair and it deserves my praise. Bright gold color as it sets in the glass with a spacious frothy white head and as it dissipates, leaves a fine covering sheet of lace to cling mightily to the glass. Sweet tones first, then malt, with a light earthiness to end the nose. Malt start, with the top light and fresh, the finish smacking in its acidity, hops apropos to the style, dry as a desert bone aftertaste, and just plain refreshing.","Gusler","Jan 06, 2003"
3.95,7.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a ultra clear very pale yellow with a 3-finger head that shrinks to a nice lumpy layer. The smell reveals an earthy grain with black pepper spicing. The taste is a lightly sweetened malt of earthy tones and the hops that are in the aromas are not apparent in the taste. Very, very mild hopping...perhaps under-hopped. It is a very pleasant taste despite the lack of bite. It is a light bodied brew with just a light sticky-sweet mouthfeel and drinkability is quite high for this one. Prosit!","BeerAngel","Dec 17, 2002"
3.48,-5.4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Agreeable, yet remarkably average. But there is nothing here to criticize. If US macros were anything like this, I'd still drink them.","cokes","Nov 27, 2002"
3.45,-6.3,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a pale yellow color with a thin white head. Slightly hoppy aroma. Taste is crisp and refreshing with notes of sweet malts and bitter hops. A pretty average beer but a definite step up from the macros.","Morris729","Nov 26, 2002"

3.62,-1.6,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"An average looking beer with a clear golden color and moderate, short-lived head.  The aroma was hops laden with just a hint of malt.  The flavor was slightly off (victim of the green bottle syndrome), but the high hop content and slight malt finish were refreshing.  The good carbonation and long-lasting flavor upped the mouthfeel.  An easily drinkable beer that would be better if fresher.  I anticipate more samplings of this style.","ryanocerus","Aug 15, 2002"
3.06,-16.8,4,3,3,3,3,"This beer poured a light gold color and formed a nice white head that left some lace.  Some light carbonation present. The aroma was of hops and touch of lemon.  The flavor was of hops and a little lemon.  The finish was a bit astrigent and had a bit of citrus to it.  Not bad for a session beer, but there are better ones out there.","Wildman","Aug 10, 2002"
3.15,-14.4,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Quite OK with me. Very pale yellow colour, small head and little lasting, sweetish maltiness, medium bitterness. Highly drinkable, fruity flavour, not too bad in the end.","rastaman","Aug 09, 2002"

3.72,1.1,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Clear yellow-gold color, 1/4 inch head in a Pilsner glass that's decently persistent.  Slightly nutty aroma.  Light-bodied, malt is unobtrusive but hops are well balanced and lend just a touch of crispness.  No annoying skunk.  Pleasant finish, a little honey sweetness.  I was looking for more grain or nut characteristics.  Not a ton of memories here but a very drinkable beer.","ADR","Jul 08, 2002"
3.2,-13,3,3,3.5,3,3,"Golden yellow in color, with highly carbonated fizzy white head. Bitter hop smell mixed with some malty sweetness, made smell like beer. Taste was somewhat malty and sweet, but the bitterness lingered to long, and was off. Too bitter to be balanced. Light to medium bodied. Easy to drink, but not a beer to really go back to for a while.......","StevieW","Jul 07, 2002"
4.22,14.7,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"A very nice example of what a German brew is and should be. It is very refreshing and aromatic at the nose. From the very inital sip to the very last, it is extremely consistent and user-friendly. The head is light, yet still lightly omnipresent. The aroma of the earthy malt and hops are a fantastic match with all foods German, particularly with pork and sauerkraut. Well worth seeking out! Prost!","goindownsouth","Jul 06, 2002"

3.83,4.1,3.5,3,4,4,4.5,"One of the basic fine German lagers.  Always available, reliable (unless it has been sitting to long in the store).  It has a nice golden color with white head.  Crips tasting, with lingering bitterness, but with enough smoothness for balance.  It a beer for everyday consupmtion.  Maybe this is the mass-produced version of German Bud, but at least it is good.","AaronRed","Jun 04, 2002"
4.11,11.7,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Spaten Premium:  Very nice example of the classic German taste.  Pale golden beer with a pure white head.  The aroma reminded me of skunk, but the taste of the beer was anything but.  Sweet taste, with a pleasant sour follow through and a hoppy dry, absolutely clean finish.  Very nice and very drinkable.","jackndan","May 25, 2002"
3.55,-3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Above average for an American Beer, slightly below average for a German brew.  Moderatly malty with a slightly hoppy aftertaste. Goes down pretty smooth.  What middle-age, balding men from Germany drink after mowing THIER lawn.","psugrad98","May 23, 2002"

3.98,8.2,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Nice fluffy white head, frothy, initially head takes the larger part of the glass, then mostly diminished in a few seconds. Body is light white gold, or platinum in color, or as I say spaten-num. The aroma has very light malt & hop notes/ herbs & grain smell. Flavor is lightly sweet. Finish is moderately bitter. It has over the top carbonation. Overall a very drinkable brew, and surely a change of pace as far as lagers go.","WilliamPhilaPa","Feb 19, 2002"
3.24,-12,3,4,3,3,3,"First surprize came, when I poured it into my glass.  Very white, like champagne, the head was thick and creamy. Most of the emphasis is on the malt.  A few raw barley notes.  Crisp bite at start, creamy aftertaste.  Don't enjoy many lagers, but this one is special.  Delicious!","Jordan","Nov 07, 2001"
