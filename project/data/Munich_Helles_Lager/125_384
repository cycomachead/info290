On the palate, it's light pils malt all the way, with a nice grainy flavor finishing with a floral note from the hops. A medium low body without a strong carbonation level make this an easy quaffer.

Well made and goes down fairly easy, though the body is a bit thicker than the standard boring old lager.

The flavor is a bit bland, but still nice. It finishes with a smooth, pale grain taste, while the main taste has a typical lager tang with a semi-sweet apple, but the overall flavor is clean and almost pure, unlike the pale Euro lagers that are mass produced.

Looked like a typical "burp beer" to me. The mouth was likewise, nothing to write about. Average. Hops were barely detectable, and wash was clean. Well, for flavor, I had to check that this wasn't a light beer. I let it marm a bit on my palette and found trace amounts of malt, slight alcohol, and they say this is a pure barley beverage, all I have to say is clean. I'll agree that the taste is as light and clean and refreshing, it would be a good hot weather beer. So, would I get this again? Not really. If it were on special or someone gave it to me I'd accept. Because it's so light, it's really easy to drink. Other than that, I want more flavor in my beers.","Ricochet","Feb 17, 2007"

The best part of the appearance was that I saw all those carbonation bubbles rising to the top of the pilsner glass. The aroma was that of what smelled like sour malt or hops, but it you swirled it around a grainy smell emerges. The taste was very grainy with a slight hoppy aftertaste. It was too grainy for my taste buds. The mouthfeel was pretty much average, clean, crisp and with some carbonation. This made for a nice affordable lager and that's it. Nothing too special and although somewhat OK, this was the worst beer out of the variety pack. Not the best beer from Penn Brewery.","AltBock","Dec 03, 2005"

It is marked by a strong slightly sweet and bready malt character with a tinge of lemon. The aftertaste produces a light bitter feeling in the back of the mouth.

On the nose the aroma slightly sweet, grassy, grain, hallertau hops and fresh mowed hay. On the palate the flavor consists of slight malts sweetness, hints of green apple, graininess, slight bitterness, and slightly peppery. Very smooth mouthfeel.

4.13,9,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This beer pours a brilliant amber color with a dense, snow white head. The head fills my pint glass and shows excellent retention. A moderate lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is sharp Hallertau hops with a touch of malt. The flavor is light and crisp, with a touch of malty sweetness followed by the nice earthy pepper note of the hallertau. The finish is very clean with just a touch of lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel is solid and a bit more robust than the flavor would lead you to believe. Beers with such a delicate and balanced taste are usually a bit thin, but this one stands up well. Drinkability is good, as this beer is enjoyable and easy going. The hops talk back just a bit more than you'd expect, which hurts drinkability a bit. Over all, a very good beer that surpasses most lighter lagers in taste and body. Another good example of an authentically styled German beer from Penn Brewing.","aaronh","Mar 05, 2003"
4.13,9,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"As the name entails, it pours a crystal clear golden hue, with a nice full white head. Reading the description of this beer on the back makes it that more enticing. The hallertau hops have an almost biscuit like aroma, and the malt sweetness diffuses into my senses along with the hops. Very pleasant and mild aroma here. A crisp refreshing maltiness, along with a unique yeast flavor. The hops give the overall flavor a light rolling bitterness that blends perfectly with the rest of what's going on. Lighter body but it's perfect for this Munchner Helles style lager. Very drinkable, maybe too drinkable making this beer one great session beer.","WVbeergeek","Mar 03, 2003"
4.2,10.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The Penn Gold poured a light tan color with an almost clear appearance. Lots of active carbonation bands rose quickly to the small, creamy head. Some lacing was noticed, but not too much. A nice fruity aroma greeted the nose, along with some sweet malt and a vague lemon scent. I was very impressed with the Gold's taste. Nice malt presence that's somewhat dominated by the Hallertau at first, but makes a recovery during the swallow. Towards the end, a strange but invigorating lemon-creamy taste made an appearance, followed some bitterness. Very nice interplay here...great taste! The lighter mouthfeel was also pleasing, and very appropriately smooth. Penn Gold has great session qualities...very drinkable, with a wonderful taste. My new favorite Helles!","SchmichaelJ","Feb 05, 2003"
