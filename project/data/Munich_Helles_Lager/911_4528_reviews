"This beer was a perfect beer to start my evening. Light, crisp, very drinkable. It paired well with some almonds I was eating."
""
"overall: A good brew they made this one so you would want one after another. I like it definitely recommend to anyone"
""
"Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
"O- A plain excellent beer in all what helles are supposed to be. Just very very good"
""
"O: A question comes to mind; can the brewer at Andechs brew a product that isn't top notch? In my opinoin; NO, not even in his sleep. Yet another fantastic Bavarian beer."
"O - I'm very impressed, it is a lovely beer. I doubt I'd ever get tired of a couple of these a week!"

"Overall an ok beer but not strongly recommended."

"Beer is medium to medium-light bodied, with active, refreshing carbonation that is slightly prickly on the tongue, but pleasing and effective with the beer's nature. Overall mouthfeel is crisp and smooth, with a dry finish that makes taking another sip pleasant. As to be expected, no ethanol warmth."
"Thanks to Thirstybird for bringing this one back from Germany. 500ml bottle served at 48 degrees in a pilsener glass. 12 09 12 indicated on the back label. Pours a translucent gold with a loose, two inch, off-white head that sizzles and pops as it slowly recedes. Tiny bubbles effervesce from the base of the glass to the underside of the cap. Nose expresses cereal grains and a light grassiness - fairly clean. Taste consistent with nose - very clean and refreshing with a light, lingering German yeast character at the back without the skunk. There's also just a kiss of noble hops to keep it from coming off as overly sweet. Mouthfeel is light and lively with a fairly clean finish. Overall - wow. I'm not too familiar with the style but this beer really hits the spot. Light and refreshing with a great balance. Really easy drinking and although not really a session beer per se, I could see myself having a few of these in a sitting."

"I get the Reinheitsgebot. I really do. And this was proof to me that there's something to it besides economic success for grain growers in 16th Century Germany. 500 ml bottle hand-carried just a day ago from Germany by C,N & E (Thanks!!). Part of a multi-pack souvenir selection. They got to go to the Andechs Monastery, but this was the next best thing for those of us that didn't go to Oktoberfest. The bottle had a May 2012 freshness date. Yeah, that fresh. Deep gold in the glass with a nice frothy lemon-tinged head. Taste was rich, slick malt with a hint of fruity hops and a nice, rounded lager flavor that ended with just a touch of bitterness. Exactly the kind of beer you'd expect from a legendary German brewery. That said, there was a hint of residual oxidation (cardboard-like) flavor that surprised me because the bottles are so fresh. A common ""off flavor"" in bottled Germans, it's almost unheard-of in kegged beers. But the bottom line was that this one was fantastic; rich mouthfeel (much more so than their regular lager) and my favorite from this multi-pack. Made me wish I could taste it on tap myself someday."
"Overall: A must have with a trip to the Holy Mountain! Alongside the plethora of beer that this monastery pumps out this is a good base for the magnificence that this place will bestow upon your taste buds. Gogogogo!!"
"I find this beer to be a very drinkable refreshing lager. I can see getting in trouble drinking too much of it (too drinkable for this higher alcohol beer)."
"D: A very nice beer. I mention the fact that I don't generally like lagers on every lager review I have ever done, but I have respect for this one. It's clean and flavorful."
"Decent carbonation, maybe a little less than usual, with a full mouthfeel, silkier than usual. Overall I like this but don't feel the need to search it out again, there are others I can find in the USA that scratch the itch just as well."
"The taste is mostly just grain with some faint white bread. A bit of very light fruit. Feel is a bit light and creamy with low-ish carbonation. Some nice flavors throughout, but fairly plain without much to really draw me in."
"Beer is light in body and pretty bitter from the grains on the back end. Its mildly sweet up front. This is the least favorite of the three lagers from Andechs I've had recently. It lacks a little bit of something, its too thin, too bitter, finishes too dry. Still a good helles though."
"But in a Gestaltian sense, it's more than the mere components--it's perfectly balanced, expertly tuned, and a paragon of craftsmanship. It's simply one of the best beers in a country skilled in the art of brewing. It's as German as apple pie is American--and no less delicious"
"Notes: Best before 18/10/10. A very nice, easy to drink beer. Well balanced with a good amount of flavor. Made for a great beer to sip on a sunny and warm day. Refreshing and has just the right amount of hops to keep it interesting. Definitely worth a try if you can get it."
"Overall, an average lager. I'm glad I had it but would choose other brews from Andechs before selecting this one again."
"Drinkability - Very high. Like everything else from this kloster, enjoy whenever available."
"D - Very easy to drink, due to the light flavor profile. The excellent feel helps the drinkability quite a bit, as it goes down easy and without any unpleasant side effects (aftertaste, bloat, etc.). Still - it's a little too bland for me to use as a lawnmower beer."
"D. Very drinkable. My wife and I polished off a few in a short time."
"--As an edit: after several months, this beer truly is the best of the Munich Helles. Augustiner Pulls a close second, but the Andechs holds a slightly spicer peppery edge that really puts it out on top. The sweetness is in perfect check, and now after drinking a perfectly fresh bottle made 2 days ago, Im editing the review for top place."
"Of course it is a very good beer, and there was nothing wrong with it. We just expect more from an Andechser, that's it."
"EDIT 2: On my visit during 6/11 I had the opposite reaction. I definitely preferred this one to the normal hell and enjoyed it quite a bit. Maybe this time I'd had more pilsners and wasn't burt out on helles beers, but I found this to be outstanding."
"Clean and refreshing it is, interesting and exciting it isn't."
"Flavor is very good, much fuller than an average helles beer. There's a pronounced hop presence and bitter aftertaste as well. Sweeter and fuller than a pils, similar bitterness as well, but more complex I'd say. Good subtle carbonation and a smooth drink. Overall an enjoyable brew at nearly 6%; something I'd have again."
"Taste is very malty with some wort notes. There is a small sweetness which makes the beer mild. The hops are nicely balanced and balance the heavy malts. Drinkability is good. The yeast is clean and produces only minor sulfur."
"Poured out a bright straw yellow clear color crowned by a big bubbly bone white head. The nose has mild straw, hopping, and malt. The taste is like a light Belgian, something like watered down mollasses, light malt, some Belgian candi, and mild hopping. Well balanced, easy drinking, and uncomplicated. Not a terribly complex beer. Finishes with a bitter crisp bite. Very refreshing, nicely carbonated mouthfeel, and extremely drinkable."
"This Helles Lager poured a clear, golden color with tall, creamy, bright white foam that persisted and clinged to the glass, leaving lace. There was good carbonation from the bottom of the glass. The smell was mildly hoppy with some floral hops notes. The taste was dry malt with some biscuity malt flavor, and balance with a good, moderate hoppiness. The mouthfeel was smooth and crisp with medium body and good carbonation. The hops came through in the finish and lingered, fading to leave a nice maltiness in the aftertaste. This was a very nice, easy to drink German lager. As with all Helles Lagers, you really have to drink them fresh to fully appreciate them."
"D: Not something I would seek out. I like other beers from this brewery. Compared to their other beers, this is in no way impressive at all."
"M&D: full-bodied and brilliantly-textured, with ever so soft carbonation to caress the tongue while remaining refreshing and lively... not at all like a 5.9%abv. beer. This is easily the best strong pale lager I've encountered for a long while (apart from its Czech counterparts which I still prefer). A fine and solid product, yet it could be even better (to me) if only the overall malt sweetness softens a little bit."
"B'ham UK"
"An unassuming, really nice helles to relax with, if you can get your hands on it. I hope I can find another bottle before too long."
"Poured a short dense white head that fades slowly leaving a few whisps of lace. Clear golden-wheat colored beer is full of tiny rising bubbles. Spicy hops and crisp sweet malt aromas. Lightly sweet pale malt with and earthy bite of hops come together into a tea like flavor. Crisp, with a light fizz in the mouthfeel, and nice sharp bite in the end. A biting, juicy, pils-esque beer. A rereshing beer that isn't just for hot days."
"I must say it's not a bad helles, even so, probably the only thing that enhanced its personality was the scenario I tasted it in- not the beer itself."
"Many thanks to Bill and Marlis for hand carrying this from Germany."
"BB 04-04-06. Normal white head and a nice golden beercolor. Nose is as malty as a helles should be with some sweetness and litle alcohol. Good nose overal without too much yeastinfluence and very clean without paper or any off tastes found. Litle fine hops also reminding me of perle and halletau. Great taste also being just slight stronger then most helles. Overwelming malts with sweet caracter and further just alcohol, fine hops and cleanest taste. Fine carbonisation makes mouthfeel good. Drinkability is probably best of the beer.... just fine."
"tastes pretty yummy, balanced, kind of bitter finish. I'm still not sure about this style, but for a lager, this is definitely better than the macros. tasty, but i'd prefer a doppelbock ..."
"I'm drinking by bottle too quickly :o(."
"500 ml bottle, bought in Germany. ABV is 5.9%. Pale golden colour, large and lingering white head. Fruity and grassy aroma, some malty sweetness too. Soft mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, moderate but decent hops well balanced with the pale malts. I am rarely ""swept away"" by a helles (nor by any other type of pale lagers, for that matter), not by this one either - but the Andechser Spezial is a well made and very drinkable helles, as far as helles go. Kloster Andechs is probably one of Germanys best breweries overall."
"Superb quality, second best helles sampled while in Germany (Augustiner on cask wins out). This bottle, brought back, conjures up many fond memories."
"Not one of us is a lager fan, however, so coming from this family, this rating is way above average."
"Overall Impression: Not my cup of tea. Good quality, but the hop/bitterness was over the top to me. The late malt presence helped."
"Good hell, not exceptional. Good drinkability."
"Refreshing but not interesting."
"Delicious. Smooth, coating and creamy mouthfeel and an excellent example of a style I usually don't enjoy. Throughout is a delicious light fruitiness and a buttery maltiness with lemon, honey, herbs and flowers"
"The head quickly fades into a thin white collar on a clear transparent golden color body. The smell is grainy with some skunkiness. The taste is very very grainy with a deep bitter and thick hoppiness. The mouthfeel is a bit more complex than in the Andechser Hell, but it's still not amazing. A veil of citrus, but it's mostly grainy and dry, and not really interesting. I got bored after two sips. Even considering the style is not one of my favorite, I can't find anything exceptional in this watery beer. A disappointment in comparison with the hefe weizen or the bergbock..."
"Yum, actually, ...the more this sits in the mouth, the more I have to conclude that it's one of the finest lagers that's ever been there. Just nice, very, very nice. Always that honey/lemon flavor, however mild, but always noticable, and just an eternal reward. Yum, again..thanks, you German monks! I hope to taste your brew again, some sweet day!"
"Ahh, Andechs! I was thrilled to see this appear on tap in a previously unremarkable German restaurant. Served in a logo glass better designed for a wheat beer, this pearl came out clear vibrant gold under a two finger white head with great retention and very nice lacing action. The aroma was nice and hoppy, with sweet malt to balance. The mouth was mildly carbonated and slightly cloying. The taste is what it should be: nice smooth sweet malt, chased by a mild but distinct hoppy bitterness. The aftertaste is pure Goldilocks: not too bitter, not too sweet. This is a good beer!"
"Listed as 5.9%ABV on this fresh German bottle. This is a classic Helles lager that pours out a very light golden colour with a small white head of foam. The aromas are classic munich malts, light floral hops, and that zesty German spice. The taste is spicy and malty, classic for a German lager. The mouthfeel is spritzy, dry, and clean. The drinkability is great. A great beer from this brewery that sadly does not import their beers to the USA :-("
"Very pale yellow colour. Sweet malts at the start, with some herbal hops towards the finish, medium bitter finish. A bit uninspiring, but not bad, quite quaffable, i guess i was expecting more, given the other fine beers this brewer is responsible for, but not bad as i said."
"A pretty good beer overall, one that I cant wait to get straight from the source."
"pat"
"The typical lager/pils color a sparkling gold as it sets in my glass, the head majestic in its presence, the color a brilliant white as it deflates, leaving behind a delicate coating of lace on the glass. Crisp clean Lager nose with the malt dominate, but also present an underlying musty aroma. As you sample, the semi-sweet front is the precedent to the middling top and the bitingly carbonated finish that combined with the purposeful hop spiciness makes this a Top Notch lager. Dry as a bone aftertaste, and quite a pleasure to quaff and that is high praise from this loyal Ale fan."
"On tap at Klosterbrauerei Andechs Bräustüberl. A visit here is indeed a special occasion worthy of the Spezial Hell. Yellow/gold colored clear brew, frothy off-white head. Malty, hints at sweetness...hopped gently. Balances back and forth between the two expertly. A refreshing and thoroughly enjoyable helles...one of the best."
