The malt smell and taste is a little low for me. Light wheat color to it. Had a thin head to it. Alot better than my go to beer miller lite. So it a keeper.","Lager_stout_87","Feb 05, 2015"

Damn nice aromas with good strength, balance, and complexity. Taste of cracker, bready grain, apple, pear, herbal, floral, grass, pepper, light clove, and earthy spiciness. Lightly tart earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of bread, light fruits, herbal, floral, grass, pepper, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Nice amount of flavors with good balance; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice.

Smells grainy but smell does not do this beer justice. Now the taste, by the way I like this very cold, exceptional as rated. I can't believe this is brewed in Penn tastes better than most Germans I've had. This thing is pure and delicious with sweet bread alittle pepper and some mild bavarian bitterness on the finish.

4.3,10.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"O: With all the impressive and unique beers that exist in the world of mircobrews today, the classic types are often ignored or sub par. Every brewery, it seems, has a pale ale or lager because it is part of the line up (it is tradition). My point? That Stoudt's Golden Lager shows how excellent the classic types can be. Sure, it is amazing to have a rare beer aged in oak for two years with chocolate or roasted Hawaiian coffee beans before being blended with other casks and then, finally, reaching the shelf in very limited quantities (yes, I used a bit of hyperbole). After all, I am one of those people trying to buy that interesting beer. However, it is nice to buy something that reminds you that beer does not have to be brewed in unique (and sometimes unnecessary) ways for it to be good.

The aroma is sweet and clean with pale malt, honey and gentle grassy herbal hops. There is also a pleasant toasted/slightly buttery aroma. The flavor is very clean, smooth and well constructed. Much like the nose, it definitely has a bit of a toasty character. The hops are soft and herbal with a pleasant grassyness that accentuates the grain character of the malt. It is very well balanced and enjoyable. The mouthfeel is light with a definite smoothness to it and a slightly drying finish. Very drinkable and refreshing. This is a great American brewed Helles, and was also enjoyed by the non-beer geeks that I shared the growler with.","zoso1967","Aug 15, 2010"

The only thing limiting the appearance score is the very pale color. Even for a Helles it is pale. I was not so impressed with the aroma and flavor. Almost no hop presence. I want some Noble hops in my Helles. The malt gives a nice semi-dry bready element. Finishes dry, crisp, and clean. Nice body with lively carbonation. Good lager elements.

Beautiful golden color, nice foamy head that lasts for the first couple of sips and then falls to lace the glass all the way down. Substantial mouthfeel, with a soft malt (and just a touch of hops) in the nose. Taste is at once clean and fresh (it's great to live so close to the brewery) malt, very mild spice, touch of sweet--but not too sweet. A bit of buttery smoothness and fruity complexity, but only a bit. Very simple, well crafted, good tasting beer that rivals the best Munich imports for quality (and exceeds them in freshness).","tugdriver7","Jan 08, 2007"

The head that it produced was a creamy/beige colored that was good in size foamy and creamy in nature, and it seemed to last for quite some time. It left a sheet with rings at the end lace behind a good portion of the way down the glass and then broke off into a patchy lace. The aromas that came from the glass were sweet and spicy like a peppercorn. I nosed fresh hops, sweet malts, citrus fruit, peppercorns, fresh grass and some caramel. The tastes were much like the aromas. Flavors of fresh floral hops, sweet malt, a light pepper, citrus lemons, kind of a watery presence, fresh grass, caramel and a tad alcohol. The aftertaste was a mix of hops and a fresh clean water feeling that balanced the hop right out. Medium bodied. Stoudts did a good job in balancing the hop bite with the sweet malt IMO, the two flavors complimented each other and did not overpower one another. It is a refreshing beer that is clean and crisp. Not a super beer but very good to drink.","Jarod","Apr 26, 2003"

Nevertheless, I love their beers and think they are worthy of more attention. This beer is no exception, a crisp, malty, clean quenching lager that is a perfect American representation of a German style beer. Lovely head that wisps into clouds, appealing musty aroma, full rich maltiness right off the bat, then tempered by flavorsome (not too bitter) hops. This beer will do for any occasion and you might be able to get that Bud-light-swilling friend of yours to drink a few of these under the right circumstances. A flawless beer, ridiculously drinkable.

4.1,5.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"As this bottle was brewed at the Lion Brewery in Wilkes Barre, PA.... this is obviously an older sample as their contract operations have been moved to the Frederick Brewery in Maryland. It pours a clear, deep golden body with a frothy white head that leaves some nice lace throughout the glass. The nose displays some lightly peppery/spicy hops over a gently sweet malt. The body is medium with a fine, median carbonation that leaves it crisp on the tongue before warming to become a touch creamy and smooth. The flavor delivers a rounded malt that obviously includes a good percentage of Munich malt. It's just lightly toasty and a tad sweet, but very well-balanced by lightly floral and gently herbal hop flavors and firm bitterness. It finishes dry but with a lingering maltiness. Quite nice, and highly drinkable. It's refreshing, but also offers enough character to make you want another. A good example of the Munich helles style at a very nice price. Well done, and certainly worth trying!","NeroFiddled","Apr 06, 2003"

The hop bitterness is a bit more prevalent than I expected. The beer has decent bitterness on the finish, but a slight metallic note detracts from the flavor.
