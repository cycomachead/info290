"a whole lot better than i expected"
"D - Decent. I guess it could be considered a session beer."

"Not a hop bomb so if thats your thing you will be disappointed.  Overall it carries the ball well for team helles as far as look and feel goes.  It is a departure from the style in the smell and taste.  It is ALMOST in the IPL territory.  Floral notes on top of a helles body.  worth a try."

"Slight hop flavor makes it just a couple touches better than your average beer.  If you find it discounted somewhere, its worth drinking, but I wouldn't go out of my way looking for it."

"Overall: Taste has a bit of hops and malt with some bitterness to it.  Middle of the road beer. Smooth finish. Good German beer brew."

"This beer.. I could take it or leave it.. Not blowing my mind.. It's a lawnmower beer at best."

"Really nice caramel color poured into a glass."
"Like pretty much everything else Leinie's puts out, this is a mediocre product.  Taste is bitter, stale hops and grass. There are much better options out there."
"   This shows what the brand can do when they want, I enjoy several styles but still miss the FIRESIDE NUT BROWN that turned me on to Craft beer even before I knew it!"

"Leinenkugel's only misstep in my book has been Hoppin Helles (now named Helles Yeah), for its musky bitterness and the fact that it's inconsistent in Leinenkugel's line of exceptional, fruitier brews."
"Solid hoppy, easy to drink beer. Tastes like hops and bread. Golden colored. Don't expect a nice head or any lacing, but it's tasty."
""
"Thank you Leinenkugels for finally brewing something without fruit."

"Clean, crisp, and wonderful looking beer.  Not really my style but enjoyable nonetheless."

"Beer #500!  Helles Yeah. Part of a great sampler pack found at the local supermercado, containing actually four brews of which I have tried none! That said let's give it a whirl. Popping the top I get a nice sweet noble hop waft with a malt base.  Pours to a bright pee yellow with a pillow top white foam head that recedes slowly and clings.  Taste is a nice shot of honey up front with a balanced but slightly more bitter mix of sweet malt and hops that is natural and very grassy.  Finish is a light sweetness with a quickly fading bitterness that leaves a clean palate.  A tasty brew, great for hot weather."
