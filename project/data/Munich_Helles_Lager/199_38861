Regardless, this stuff pours a clear brass-straw topped by a short finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises dry barley, light sweet corn, sweet flowers, a touch of grass, and a few sprinkles of powdered sugar. The taste brings in more of the same, some lovely helles-style goodness trickling through my GI tract. The body straddles the line between hefty light and light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a very solid and highly drinkable little lager, something we need more of 'round here.","TMoney2591","Apr 26, 2014"

3.84,7.9,4,3.75,4,3.5,3.75,"Okay, Cuz, come wid it! The Crack revealed yet another brimful craft CAN and I hope that the big boys are paying attention because this is how to make the CANsumer feel like they have gotten their money's worth. An inverted Glug later and we were off and running. I briefly had a finger of fizzy, foamy, bone-white head that quickly dissipated into wisps, leaving just a skim across the top in its wake. Color was a pale, straw-yellow with NE-quality clarity and I once again want to mention the plight of Lincoln, NE's own Val MidWest who has been cited for public nudity while trespassing on private property. Ha! She may beat this one and I will stop there. Say, a fizzy yellow beer from San Diego (County), California ... Doesn't someone else from the area have some choice words to say about such things? Nose is good, with a pure lager scent driven by a honey-like sweetness with an underlying grassiness, undoubtedly from Saaz hops. I say ""pure"" because one of the drawbacks of The CANQuest (TM) has been my repeated exposure to AALs and once I realized what a lager was supposed to taste like and what Prohibition desensitized us into, I wept and CANtinue to weep. Mouthfeel was medium, not overly carbonated as I may have led people to believe with my ""fizzy"" comment. The taste was more grassy than malty, which straddles a fine line between a German and a Czech but as the site's description reads ""... a bit more subdued and in balance with malts", I will bow in deference. It was not as in-your-face as a Czech Pils, lending credence to the CAN's verbiage about being ""... solidly balanced", but as a self-avowed hophead, I would now like to challenge my Westie Cuz to make a Czech Pils in a CAN. Finish was, indeed, ""... clean with a hint of hops"" so kudos for truth in advertising. I think that by ""clean," they are referring to the qualities that adjuncts, especially corn, impart in a lager and this was definitely clean. That ""hint"" business puts me in mind of the old Schlitz slogan, ""Just a Kiss of the Hops"". What are we? Kissing cousins that I just get a peck on the cheek?!? I want a kiss like my Old Lady's, where she punches me in the mouth with her lips! All jagging aside, this was a solid iteration of the style and would definitely be cooler-worthy in my humble estimation.","woodychandler","May 27, 2013"

Drinkable but even less interesting than many industrial lagers. A slight tanginess is about the best I can say for it, and it still has that kind of sweet nearly insipid taste. An earthy tough to the not very bitter hops. I would hope for a good San Diego style lager from somebody around here to counteract all the over-hyped IPAs.

3.88,9,3.5,3.5,4,4.25,4,"D/O: Full of traditional qualities, this American pale lager does a credible job of measuring up to the German archetype. The constant craft beer drinker may be misled, dared to contemplate how this beer does not stand apart meaningfully from everyday adjunct lagers. In fact, the truth could not be farther away from such a thought. In a direct comparison, evidence of traditional ingredients and careful contemplation on the part of the brewer ooze from this product. It should not be mistaken for an aggressive, next-generation American craft pilsner such as Sam Adams Noble Pils or Green Flash Fizzy Yellow. This is for the old-school beer purists--and those that simply order 'a beer' when trying Beachwood BBQ for the first time.","beagle75","Apr 08, 2013"
