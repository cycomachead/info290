"I am neutral on this beer."
""
"Overall - This is a good beer, as it should be for the price. This beer has been around since the 1500's; WOW I'm impressed! I am a bit disappointed that the beer was slightly skunky, considering that this is one of the most famous beers in the entire world. I can't imagine what this beer would taste like on tap, but is still good from the bottle. My only advice to the Hofbrauhaus is to import your beer in dark bottles - you should know better. Otherwise, I'm glad I tried it and I would drink it everyday if I didn't have to pay over $11 for an 11.2 ounce six pack."
"Overall : while not the best per se, this isn't a bad lager. Worth a try but maybe not worth it's price tag. Try it if you can."

"Very light reminds me of a white wine a little bit of honey. Very little carbonation. My mom likes it so it must be palatable to must everyone."

"This is THE legit lawnmower beer for me. Poured 12oz into my Spiegelau, clewr, golden, and carbonated throughout... fluffy finger of white head. Bready, clean, and slightly vegetal/grassy nose. Ridiculously light, balanced, and crisp taste. Bit of nice bitterness in there. Refreshing as hell, and really well done. This has to be the blueprint for the American Adjunct Lagers... they have a long way to catch up."

"Decent Munich Helles lager.  One of those beers that taste much better on draft if able."

"This is my favorite beer"

"Nose of malt, grass, corn, cereals. Taste sweet malt, straw, bready, faint hops & caramel, light bitter finish;"

"Crackery, sweet aroma and a smooth, crackery, pale malt flavor with just enough noble hops in the back. Not too thin as some in the style can be, not certainly not as full and rich as others. A nice middle ground for when you're just craving a good classic Munich Hell."

"03/18/14 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Full bodied & less bitter than the famous weiss these guys do. Very good & goes down too easy. Thank goodness it's a mere 5.1 ABV."
""
"I like to have a nice strong IPA or other Pale Ale, or two, then have a Hofbrau Original.  The smoothness of this lager is a great palate cleanser after the hoppy beers.  If I just have one of these right away I would give it a 3 but for some reason after a couple of pale ales it seems almost creamy."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pale yellow with a fizzy head. The smell is a little sour with mostly the malt coming through and then some citrus from the hops finishing the beer. The taste is mellow in the beginning with an almost tart finish from the hops. I thought it was a nice german style but it didn't floor me in any category though."

"O - I had given this a simple rating a long time ago, so it needed an upgrade. Very good Munich Helles Lager and much better than I remember."

"The beer appears a clear golden hue with an inch of thick, white head. Distinctly German lager scents rise up to the olfactory senses before the glass is even lifted. Refreshing flavor, with a bready, yeasty quality that can make a lager beer so quaffable. A standard of the style and one I shall certainly return to. Tasty."

"500 ml bottle into lager glass, bottled on 3/26/2013. Pours crystal clear golden straw color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of light lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, straw, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of light lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, straw, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light lemon, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, straw, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester flavors; with a very clean flavor profile and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and clean mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Helles style. All around good balance and robustness of clean pale malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Lightly bready malt in aroma, floral hops are subtle. Flavor is slightly stale cardboard, but bready and malty. Might be a little oxidized. Not what I remember or expected, and I hope it's the bottle. Will have to review on draft to hopefully get a better experience."
"Final Grade: 4.01 even, an impressive A-. The Germans are the masters of lagerdom, and Hofbr√§u Original is yet another testament to this fact. This is an outstanding Munich lager that could easily become a staple - if it became readily available locally, at least. Until then, I'll probably just stick with other imports, but as far as this style goes, I do believe I've finally found a new favourite to displace the venerable (and ubiquitous) Spaten. A wonderful continental lager that should appeal to not only BAs, but beer drinkers in general - grab one while it's available."

"Overall: I normally don't like lager but this one was quite good. Another home run for the germans."
""
""
"Overall: Just a classic munich helles lager. The hop tones play along seamlessly with a airy biscuit malt body. A beer I would share with anyone with conviction that this would be enjoyed by all."

"500ml bottle. Lager glass. Gold color, crystal clear appearance. White froth, lasting head. Slight sulphury odor, pale malt, grain, floral & Noble hop aromas, hints of hay & vanilla to the nose. Crispy upfront, sweet pale malt flavor ar first sip. Light body. Moderate carbonation. Dense to watery texture. Subtle spicy & grainy flavors in the middle. Funny & sparkling palate. Low hoppiness resolves in a long bitter/sweet finish. No flat, no fat, but clean bitter beer. Easy drinkability."
"Poured from the bottle into a flute. A lighten golden yellow brew with a massive white head, immediately making its presence known via a pleasant noble hop spice and sweet doughy malts on the nose, a touch of vinous fruit as well. Good head retention. Palate is dominated by clean pale malts (with a hint of pancake), only faintly sweet, with hints of lemon rind, licorice, hay, cinnamon, and strawberry candy. Clean and crisp, with an uber-smooth mouthfeel and soft carbonation. Damn near perfect helles lager except for a little skunk and metal in the dry spicy finish. Less sweet and more malty than other commercial examples with a complex array of German hop flavors that of course do not overwhelm what is essentially a malt showcase. Not hard to find and well worth it if you wish to experience a classic helles flavor."

"at $8.99 a six pack 11.2 oz bottles. there are craft beers at this price point with higher abv. but like i said this is about having an authentic munich specialty lager. worth every penny, if you ask me."

"I wish I could get a permanent supply of this in cans. As others wrote, it's not much to analyze, just drink, enjoy and not wonder why it's so simple yet so good."

"Glue was stuck to the underside of the lip of the nozzle on one of the beers which detracted from the taste and was poor packaging. Other than that oversight it was a delicious beer."

"Pours a crystal clear deep golden color with a smallish white head that dissipates rather quickly. Huge skunky aromas as soon as I pop the cap and pour into the glass. Luckily those dissipate rather quickly revealing a pleasant bready decocted pilsner malt aroma with a hint of floral earthy hop. The flavor is rich melanoid and pilsner malt with just enough earthy hop flavor to provide some balance. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick almost sweet mouthfeel. Decent Helles, I've have had better, but I could drink this."
"Pours golden with a brilliance and perfect clarity. Fat head of off white foam that fell well to a ring and some clusters of foam on top. This beer is shining. Nose is pristine. Light sweet grain, doughy malt., a touch of floral and some fresh cut grass and wet hay. Crisp and light on the palate with just enough bubbles to tickle the tongue. Wet grassy flavor in the middle and drinks so easily and refreshing. The noble hops are so light they engage the palate effortlessly as the lightly sweet grain kisses the drink as a faint little bitter leaves you wanting more. Truly motivating. Simply outstanding. You could drink a few of these."

"Pours a clear golden-yellow in color with a 1+-finger white foamy head that doesn't last long. No lacing was actually seen, if very little. The aroma is of some grassy malts. Most brews that come in a green bottle have a 'skunky' smell for some reason, this one had just a very light hint of that BUT not like many others. The taste was clean and crisp with a very slight drier finish. No bad aftertaste. Overall a very good brew despite the higher carbonation."

"O: Crisp and flavourful. Definitely a beer I will have again."
""
""
"Light and fairly crisp, with plenty of nip but lots of give as well, this beer is active but flows smoothly and easily. It's fluffy without being airy, and is really very nice to drink."
""

""

"o: i went in not expecting too much on this, and i was pleasantly surprised. it doesn't have the biggest of boldest flavors, but its put together real well, and the that taste is crisp, sweet, and refreshing."
""
""
"Pours a clear, straw color. 1/2 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of pale malt, slight sweet malt, hint of hops, hint of sulfur, and a hint of adjunct?. Fits the style of a Munich Helles Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sulfur, pale malt, slight sweet malt, hint of hop, and a hint of adjunct. Overall, I'm sure this is better in Germany, but still not too bad here in Missouri; decent Munich Helles Lager."

"Overall: A very good lager and an excellent example of the style."
""
""
""
""
"It's an excellent beer."

""

""
"Overall - Really enjoyable especially if you need something to quench your thirst. I can also only imagine the copious amounts of this that is served at Oktoberfest every year in Munich, and wish I was there to enjoy it on tap."
""
"The bready, doughy, and malty characters are just as prevalent in the flavor making this tasty in the German tradition. Clean but dry finish that lingers briefly. I bet I would have liked it more from a keg or a brown bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not my favorite style by any means, but I can enjoy a few of these. I've never been to Oktoberfest or the Munich Hofbrauhaus, but I've had a few layovers in German airports and some mugs of this with some soft pretzels are always a bright spot on miserable travel days."
""

""

"A decent helles, nothing special but solid and thirst-quenching."
""
"Overall, a very fine lager. Don't know what else to say. I would drink it again if I felt like a lager and wanted a good quality lager at that. Holds up much better than many. Improves with warmth which is a big plus."

"Overall- Not the most interesting beer in the world but appears to be a good reflection of the style and will be rated accordingly."
""
""
""
""
"The taste is light with a light malty base and no caramalt or any sweet or dextrinous tastes, just pure malt. The bitterness is nicely balanced with the malt and the hops jump out of the beer. Again the hops are upfront and determine the character of the beer. The yeast character is clean."
""
""
"Pours a two finger white head that vanishes slowly leaving some lace. Crystal pale straw color. Good carbonation and light-medium bodied. Grains and light hop nose and flavor is lightly sweet and hints of hops. 330ml bottle, from Gift Specialists Oceanside, California."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Good lager with good drinkability."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 500ml bottle. Pours a bright yellow with big bubbles. The nose is clean and fresh with notes of grass, grains and bright hops. The palate is rich and slightly sweet with notes of cereal and a nice dry slightly bitter finish. The mouthfeel offers big creamy carbonation. Great lager for a hearty meal or just cooling off on a hot day."
""
"O - A great representation of the style. There arUe still a couple Munich Helles' I prefer, but this is a damn good beer. Tasty and refreshing, perfectly sessionable. Look forward to picking up more."
""
""
""
"Served ice cold this has all the flavor and tons of drinkability expected in an Old World German lager. Strong oatey, malty, biscuity flavor and they disappear one right after the other. No wonder the English soccer fans underestimate German beers. 5 pct ABV, flavorful and drinks like water."
""
"Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
""
""
"Hofbr√§u Original expresses the true voice of Germany's proud brewing tradition. It is a model showcase of the simple yet substantial beers that made Germans so renown for their lagers and reduced breweries worldwide to mere copycats. True, you can easily find lager everywhere, but this reminds us that in Germany is still where you find the best."
""
""
""
"Overall ‚Äì A really refreshing solid example of the style. This is the type of beer I could drink all night long, especially during the warmer months."

"O- A very drinkable beer on par with the style guidelines. I would definitely recommend drinking this on a hot day."

"Poured a 330ml bottle into a Sam Adams glass. Poured a clear pale gold with almost no head and no lacing. Aroma is sweet with notes of bread and maybe green apple (there's a certain tart feeling to it). The taste is very malt forward, with the same flavors as the aroma and a nice hit of hop bitterness on the finish. There is slightest bit of carbonation and the mouthfeel is a little bit thin and both a really quite nice. A great German lager, simple and well made."

"O: This is a beer you drink after a long day at work. Plop on the couch, pop some popcorn and watch/read something."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nothing stands this apart from the thousands of simular brews around the world: refreshing but standard fare really. Just above your average mass produced lager type beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Another of those German lagers, the kind where you start to wonder why you're wasting your time analyzing it, when a good chunk of your DNA has been co-opted by the general laid-back, but still stern, uh, pleasantness of this offering, and whether you should just get on with the drinking. I'm strongly inclined to just say 'Prost' to it all right now."

"Overall - Great all-around lager. Flavorful, without being cloying. If I were in the mood for a ""honeyfied"" sweet brew, I'd definitely buy this again."
"Classic one, even nicer when having it at Hofbrau in Munich."
"Overall / Drinkability: Not bad. Not the best German lager I've ever had, but not bad. I think the beer needs a bit more malt to balance out the hops, but, I think this beer would work really good with food. I had it by itself and I keep thinking I need something to pair it with and so drinkability is not high - one is enough."
"overall, why is there only ONE october review of this brew? oh, probably because everyone in the world has already had this beer, and reviewed it YEARS ago.... there is a slight 'cereal' taste to this one. it's very 'commercial' and very drinkable. seems most of germany's 'commercial' products can qualify as a 'standard' for many other parts of the world."

"Half litre bottle, poured into pint glass. One and a half finger head which wasn't retained well. Pale colour, clear. Aroma was Saaz hop with citrus notes and a hint of malt. Tasted Munich malts, had a sharp after taste, fairly sweet, slightly fruity. Moderate carbonation, fairly smooth, crisp body. Very easy to drink, good warm weather beer. Typical Munich Helles Lager."
""
""
"O: a delicious munich helles. pretty standard"
"A style that I don't see too much, but I really enjoy and this one is well done by Hofbrau."
""
""
"Prost!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A very sessionable, refreshing, and flavorful lager"
""
""
"Quite a flavorful beer, if mass market lagers had this much flavor, I'd be buying them. While not my favorite style, this has to be one of the better lagers I have tried."
""
"O: One of the best German lagers that I've ever tasted. Extremely well balanced. Not sweet or sour, and a nearly perfect blend of hop, malt, yeast, and grain flavors -- at least for me. Perfect at 35 degrees or so."
""
""
"Overall: quite a nice lager / wheat beer cross-over, bit too expensive though, at AU$70-ish a case (2012)."

"Pours a crystal clear golden yellow with a 1 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, grass, and some grape juice-like aromas. Taste is of grain/malt and some grassy flavors on the finish. The malt really sticks around in the aftertaste though. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is very easy drinking."
"Notes: Very solid and very drinkable oh yeah it's a lager as well hell yeah. Cheers."
"O: I had this on tap at the Munich Hofbr√§uhaus a few years ago - it was excellent. This, however, was a complete letdown. I've been fighting the general disdain of green bottles, but this normally good beer has taught me that beers in green bottles just aren't worth buying. This review may be an injustice seeing how good this can be on tap. Just don't buy it in bottles."

"Single finger white foam head with little lace on a straw colored clear body. Aroma is mostly of breads and pale malts. Flavor has more of a sweet corn, floral and grass note with a pale malt background. Light body and high carbonation. Overall refreshing and drinkable, simple but flavorful. A little too sweet however."

"Poured this Munich Helles from a 12 oz bottle into a ping glass. Poured a clear pale golden color, produced a thick white head, excellent retention and left a nice amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is full of malted barley, fresh cut grass and floral hops. Light in body, this Helles is full of malted barley, fresh baked bread, and a hit of hops at the finish. Clean, crisp, refreshing and this is even better on Tap I have had the privilege of drinking this fresh at Hofbrauhaus in Munich, while i would say it was much better in person on tap- I enjoyed this bottled version very much. Prost!!!"
""
""
"Notes: pretty good, pretty drinkable. As always, better on-tap (unpasteurized)."
""
"A great lager. Something perfect for the summertime after a hard days work."
""
""
"Overall - 4/5 - A surprisingly tasty lighter beer style, something I don't drink often. The American macrobreweries could learn something."
"Still one of my favorite German lagers after all of these years. There's a lot of subtleties flavor-wise, yet the body of this beer is very warming and alive to maintain interest throughout consumption. Far better on tap (at the brewery) rather than in the bottle, and I would recommend to drink this as fresh as possible upon purchasing. A good pick amongst countless Munich lagers to choose from."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Helles Lager is something special. No die hard beer fan will call it his favorite style, yet he's sure to appreciative the consistency and roundedness of the style's exemplars."
""
"O: A lawnmower beer with some huevos. Easy drinking lager with more flavor than any other green bottle I've come across. Prost! Just wish I could find it for cheaper than 11 bucks a sixer. Still, it's nice to come across good light lagers with some flavor."
""
"Overall - The subtlety of this beer is what makes it world class. Everything is perfectly crafted - nothing better than the original helles lager when the time is right."
""
""
"O- Good beer and differnt style from what I usually have. Would like to try this in Munich to really experience it!"
""
""
""
""
"O - A very nice Helles that will not leave you disappointed"
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer poured out as a clear looking golden yellow color with a foamy white head on top. The smell of the beer was earthy but not overly grassy which I liked. The taste of the beer had a good strong sharp flavor to it with a good amount of grain in the beginning, and finishing with a nice sharp crisp bitter finish. The mouthfeel was clean and light, tingly carbonation with a dry finish. Overall it's not a bad German Lager."
"Overall this is an above average beer. The only downsides are the moderate skunkiness and it is just a tad sweet. Otherwise excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - a definite summer session beer."
""
"I had expected an even smoother and balanced brew, like the Helles I had in Bamberg. This one is a bit too sweet."
""
""
"A little pricey for the lack of ingredients, I guess the time it takes to make/cellar/lager a lager weighs into it, as well as the transportation issues, but still. . ."
"O: Extremely enjoyable beer at its original home, making it that much better. would definitely have again."

"This beer pours a clear golden color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is a nice balance of biscuits, caramel and noble hops. The taste is a bit maltier than the aroma, with the hops playing a backing role in the finish. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with a smooth texture, and lively carbonation. Overall, this is a really good beer with real complexity that I will certainly drink again."

"on tap at Uberstein...they have it in the one liter mugs! dangerous...I drank a few. Classic of the style, crisp, clean, good yeast character. Goes down soo easy, it's hard to stop. Was perfect with some cheese curds and other appetizers during Packer game. Recommended. Will review the other Hofbrau beers on tap next time I'm there. I've had most of them out of the bottle, but they're especially great on tap."

"O- Didn't get to enjoy this beer in Munich, so I'm making up for it here. Good brew. I wish it were more complex though."
"This is an interesting lager. It packs some interesting flavor profiles while remaining very drinkable. Not a beer I see myself going back to short of going to The Hofbrau house in Northern Kentucky but I enjoyed this and it had potential to be pretty darn bland."
"when i pored this beer i was not surprised it was a light gold like bud light smell was floral but not too strong sugesting no taste whatsoever head was not there but taste was really good i was really surpised i would try other types of this beer. light but refreshing not to heavy or bitter"
"O-wow this is a thirst quenching beer!..which isn't something i find to be common. some times a good and crisp german lager has everything i want. bought a whole 6-pack of this and i'm glad i did, the other 5 won't remain in my fridge long enough."
"Taste is ilke these pilseners should be, soft and round and with a bit sweetness but not much."
"O: Real nice, pleasant beer. Easy to drink but still delicious."
"O - Good helles, not the best"
"O- A good beer, and a good example of the style. Clean and malty, with just enough of a noble hop kick to keep me interested, while relying on the malt profile, as it should. Good beer."
"This pours a very light yellow or straw like color with a decent white head, which leaves a little lacing. The smell is initially of some type of rubber or latex (maybe from the green bottle?), under that there are some grainy smells and bread malts. Feel is light and watery. The taste is okay there is also a latex taste followed by some grains, but I wonder if this is going bad. I don't think its very old so perhaps the green bottle might be to blame. This might be a drain pour."
"O: This is as most Munich Helles Lagers; very drinkable."
"This was directly from a case of beer which had just come in at the store so theoretically it shouldn't have been exposed to too much light and should have been relatively fresh. I look forward to hopefully getting this again in the future to review it again. I can't imagine this is the flavor that has gotten such consistent high reviews here."
"Overall, a beer with finesse. Very drinkable."
"Very nice beer... exactly the sort of thing I could see drinking with some friends while watching the brats grill during football season."
"O: Nice drinkable brew might could be stronger in body."
"Overall, a very solid, well crafted beer; I'll buy more of these, especially for guests who prefer what they call ""lighter"" beers"
"O - A great German drinking beer, from Munchen's watering hole."
"I took a special trip to Milwaukee, WI to visit The Old German Beer Hall and had the privilege to first enjoy Hofbrau on tap there in a large 1 litre glass. Absolutely delicious! When I got back home to Grand Rapids, MI I had to do some searching but was able to track down some bottled Hofbrau to give it a second go around and I think I'm even more in love with it! This fine Deutsche Bier is now my favorite! Prost!"
"This style has completely taken over all my Summer Lager needs and desires. Heavenly to drink, I can't imagine going without Helles."
"Cant really go wrong with this one. A solid offering that is super refreshing. Would be great on a hot summer day. Def worth a try!"
"Overall Impression- I'm very sure I've had this Hofbr√§u while in Munich for the Oktoberfest but this American version is very different. Everything here was average and nothing really special. Showed decent signs of a Munich Helles Lager here and there but only at par."
"RJT"
"O: A light, crisp, easy to drink beer with some good flavors. Solid stuff."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Yet another brew here at the Brauhaus. I do plan on leaving eventually... Anyway, this one pours a clear sallow topped by a finger of white micro-foam. The nose comprises wheat, flowers, and grass. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a light vein of lemon zest and a tiny pinch of nutmeg. The body is quite light, with a very light moderate carbonation, a nearly watery feel, and a crisp finish. Overall, an okay brew at best, one that would have been better if it's taste had been echoed in the smell and feel (the latter two being far too meek and thin and watery to be really enjoyed)."
"Poured at the Hofbrau House in Panama City from tap. The appearance is a hazy gold with creamy white head that fades fast and leaves spotty lace. The smell is of earthy grain, caramel, bread and earthy notes of hops. The taste is caramel, freshly baked bread, and lemon with an herbal, earthy touch at the end. Overall a nicely balanced beer, but on the watery side."
"Dr: It's probably fairly priced in Germany, but it's not in Ireland. I'd have it again as a run of the mill drinking beer, but it's nothing special."
"Not bad at all."
"I loved the fact that this came in a 16 oz. bottle since it was so easy to down. The alcohol couldn't be felt and this is about as ""bright"" a beer that I've had for a long time, given how light it appeared to be when I poured it out. This won't blow anyone away but give me a bunch of bottles of this and i'd be happy for a while. There's no doubt that this is simply wonderful."
"O- Great drinkabilty, as you would expect. A good thirst-quencher with no major issues and nothing much interesting to say"
"Ordered a bottle this past weekend while dining at the Beehive in the South End. Poured into a small dimpled mug. Loads of carbonation. Bright yellow body with a modest sized white head. Smell was fairly fresh, with only a slight smell of skunk from the green bottle. Not enough to detract points for though. Taste was actually pretty fresh. Lots of malt, just a bit of bitterness from the hops. Mouthfeel was pretty smooth but uneventful. On the watery side, but needs to be to enjoy in mass quantities (no pun intended). Overall not as ""euro"" tasting as I was expecting. This beers holds up quite well on the journey over from Germany."
"D: Enticing, but I didn't care for the particular hopping and 0.5 L was more than enough."
"Overall: A very drinkable lager. It was gone before my lunch arrived. I could drink several of these. Very nice indeed."
"Overall - Decent beer. Pretty basic and uninspiring. I enjoyed it for historical reasons, since it's brewred according to the German Purity Law according to the bottle, which also says ""since 1589""."
"A must when in Munich, either at the Hofbrauhaus itself, or at one of the many other gardens or kellers in Munich or elsewhere."
"Mouth feel is watery with a cheap carbonation like soda. I feel like this is their version of the US' fizzy yellow stuff"
"overall its a nice lager...very light and crisp. really nothing special but sitting in the hofbrauhaus it tastes delicious."
"Could use some more balance, but very drinkable and refreshing with the bitterness."
"Very good Bavarian lager, simple yet pleasurable. Nice choice to pair with fish or salad, along with everyday usage."
"I currently have a keg of Hafbrau Original and my rating is based on what is sold here in the U.S. Overall, it's a 4.0. The Hofbrau sold in Germany is much better. It's so clean and fresh - straight from the barrel and naturally carbonated. Definitely one of best beers I've had."
"This beer washes down heavy meals and sorrows."
"Bright gold in color with a foamy white head. Tangy malt nose with some faint clean grassy hops in the background, along with some lemony notes. Flavor is well balanced and slightly favors sweetness. It is a clean, smooth, slightly-sweet malt palate, with a bit of a sour aftertaste, all without being watery. It won't wow you with its complexity, but this beer is a solid choice."
"Poured on tap at the Hofbrahaus in Las Vegas into a 1L beer stein and probably in Munich back in my days. Light gold color with a big white head. Good lace as the beer drops. Subtle malty aroma with light kiwi and apple touches. Bready malt flavor that is lighter in intensity, and a dash of bright watermelon. Subtle spicy and fruity hops in the flavor, with a touch of bitterness. Medium-light body and smooth but ample carbonation. A nice, malt accented helles. Very drinkable beer (hence the high ranking I gave it)."
"Finish is smooth and sleek with a good mouthfeel and very drinkable. Could be a nice session beer."
"Hofbrau is a basic, no-frills lager, but with enough balanced flavor to be worthy. Solid, enjoyable, and quite drinkable."
"Definitely recommend, was not too impressed with the initial appearance but hey, it tasted great!"
"drinkability; very refreshing and crisp without sacrificing complexities in the flavor, one of the better choices for the style."
"d - A pretty good German lager. Lots of floral and earthy tones in it and easy to drink. Would have again."
"i typically don't like helles lagers, but this one is great. it's buttery and slightly grassy, enough flavor to be worth drinking, but then again, it doesn't really keep me interested for long."
"12 oz bottle. Pours golden in color, almost without a head, lots of carbonation. Aroma is of grass and hops, some malt as well. Medium, clean body. Flavors are a good amount of noble hops and sweet malt. This beer much exceeded my expectation. Typical German lager."
"Overall very impressed. Nice well balanced brew. I really enjoy Hofbrau Original, it is a regular and welcom visitor to my fridge and my palate. This beer truly does hold alot of character and my wife will even drink it."
"Notes: Having just recently found this beer, I have to say I really like it. Would be highly sessionable, if only it wasn't so expensive."
"A perfect Helles IMO. Simple, but it does not skimp on character. An excellent beer. Highly recommended."
"I'll definitely be picking up a six-pack next time!"
"Overall: Basically the same original Spaten."
"Overall i enjoyed this beer as a great sessionable lager that has deserved a spot in my fridge. I am really diggin this style compared to american lagers. A good tasting lager then can be drank all night."
"very high. a crisp clean refreshing beer that is light bodied but great flavor. I would love to have to bratwurst while drinking this now. Would be a great beer to have a big liter mug and grilling some german fare outside."
"An honest and well balanced beer, sampled at beer tasting at De Klomp, Link√∂ping, Sweden."
"Pours a crystal clear bright golden hue with an eggshell white head. Minimal lacing speckled around my glass. Aroma has a nice grassy/herbal spicy noble hop accent with hints of green bottle but nothing like the average Euro lager. Pale biscuit malts balance out the hops, flavor has a slightly metallic edge with a spicy h erbal hop note in the flavor. Mouthfeel is light bodied sturdy carbonation no off flavors left behind, nice hop burps after a couple sips. Refreshing and solid everyday drinking beer, this could definitely be a staple if cheap and readily available."
"Within the style I'd rate it slightly above average on drinkability. A decent offering but not very noteworthy. Would work on a summer day out in the yard."
"Pours a clear golden orange body with one finger of bright white foam that clings pretty well to the glass. Aromas are grainy and grassy and quite subdued and uninteresting. The taste is fascinating in that the front and mid-palates are Exactly the same as the finish. Grains and honey from beginning to end. One of the most uniformly flavored beers I've ever had. Uncomplicated to the core, but in a good tasting way."
"Drinkability: Screw Bud Light. This is what it means to be ""superiorly"" drinkable."
"Atmosphere is really nice. Really full, imperial appearance, and a full although simple nose. Really pristine, and true to the style. Flavor is not complex, but very very well balanced. Just the way you'd want it to taste, and nothing puts you off. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"Damn you Germans, damn you for being so damn conformist!! [/steps off of soap box]"
"Drinkability - I really thought this brew would have more ""kick"" or ""bite"". It's not a bad beer by any means. It's very drinkable and is still better than any macro, but I was just expecting more considering its very high rating. Would pair nicely with a real hot spring or summer day however."
"D - Extremely drinkable. Get a bunch and a designated driver,"
"One of my favorite German Lagers, this one demonstrates the subtle flavors that I have become so fond of in this region and style. Highly recommended. Much better than the American macros that I used to have for this type of situation."
"Yes, I'll try it with food -- bratwurst perhaps."
"D- Very drinkable, refreshing, great for a hot day"
"Refreshing beer. A good amount of flavor and highly drinkable."
"Overall: Overall, it was a pretty good beer. Nice taste of sweetness to it, with a little too much carbonation. Not my preferred style, but still pretty good."
"D-very good drinking beer. I would drink this beer again but I would only want it on tap."
"Poured from a green 12 oz. bottle. has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains, a bit of sweetness. Taste is crisp, mild, some grains, just a tad bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a decent brew."
"Quite enjoyable, have had this on-tap before many times but this is the first time from the bottle. Much more spicy and malty from a bottle. On-tap you still get the crispness but the malt doesn't coat your mouth in quite the same way."
"About 2"" head when poured from bottle. Thin lacing on weizen glass after first sip. No fruity taste just a clean crisp taste with slight hint of the hops. Pale orange color with heavy mix of yellow hue. Great beer to enjoy anytime especially when temp of beer is around 40 degrees."
"D: It's very easy to consume this beer so it is sessionable and well suited for drinking several of these in one sitting out of litre-sized mugs."
"The beer is a clear golden color with a nice thick white head (got a little on my nose, good sign) Smells hoppy and malty. Tastes very fresh, in the front is a sweet malty flavor and it finishes hoppy with a little bitterness. The bitterness is perfect, enough to make you want another sip, but not enough to leave a bad taste in your mouth. It has a medium/light body and is pretty easy to drink, very sessionable (the way this style is meant to be)"
"D: Munich Helles Lagers are intended to be light and very drinkable while still having some depth and flavor. Hofbrau Original is finely crafted and spot on for the style."
"Crystal clear and light gold with a fluffy white cap. Decent head retention, lots of sticky and streaky lace. Cereal grain and malt aroma, with floral notes and a hint of spice. Solid hop bitterness that has just a bit of bite, floral and grassy up front with more of an herbal finish, almost minty. Mild malt sweetness and flavour throughout. Light bodied, moderate carbonation, a bit dry. Crisp and refreshing, quite tasty. I ended up liking the hop profile even though I wasn't sold on it at first taste."
"Drinkability: A good session lager here from Hofbrau, and one that I may revisit someday soon."
"In all, I'm very glad that I know where to find this in the case that I want something tried and true."
"The beer pours a clear yellow color with a large white head. The aroma is grain and grassy hops. The flavor is more of the same with some light malts and some grassy and slightly earthy hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Notes: Again to sum up this beer it is well balanced, tasty and easy to drink. It makes for a good summer drinking beer and works well with a light snack of soft sour dough pretzels."
"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable brew, I usually never pick it up due to the high probability of it being light struck. This time the fates were aligned and I lucked out. If I make my way to the Hofbrau house in Munich, I'll be grabbing a liter or two."
"D- Not bad. Not exactly my cup of tea (or beer, as it were), but I could definitely see this as a good change up from PBR or Coors, a real German beer that serves as a great intro to ""real"" beer."
"D- late June, rack of ribs in the wet smoker, and havin 2 litres of this is helpin me deal with the skeeters. Glad it's in my mug. Back before I knew anything about beer I thought helles tasted like shit. Except for the a/b endeavour burnin helles back in say, 2004-05, but that doesn't really count I guess and, ah look at me, I'm ramblin again. Point is, enjoying a style for what it is and what it's worth is truly a righteous time. By far and completely the best helles I've had and totaly on par with jarhundert century bier from my salaciously coveted braueri von aying. Which I'm still tryin to find a case of. I haven't showered today."
"Overall: a very drinkable beer that leaves you wanting one drink after another. great for a session."
"Good memories associated with this beer, even without that, it would taste just fine. I've rarely seen this in the States but it's a good bottle and fresh as can be expected."
"verdict- I want to rate this beer down, call it an average pilsner swill with a rotten nose, but darn if it isn't just the most drinkable and refreshing thing you can get from a tap."
"Ultimately, a nice brew that I would enjoy again. Held up well with food."
"D: Very drinkable. The relative lightness of this beer combined with its crispness go down easy. However, I just can't get past the godsawful smell."
"D - What I imagine something like Heineken SHOULD taste like. A real beer and very enjoyable."
"This beer is a clear golden color with a fair head. The smell was of grain, a good clean aroma. The taste was crisp & clean with a slight sweetness. The feel was light, smooth and went down very easy Another very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: ah, the light lager's strong suit. I rather like Hofbr√§u Original more than most other lagers I've tried, and on top of that it is mega refreshing on the palate. Good stuff."
"D- Light beer very easy to put down."
"Drinkability - This is actually pretty good for a lager. If I want a lighter colored lager and not looking for the more intense bitterness of a real pilsener then I would probably grab one of these. Pretty impressive overall considering the type of beer."
"I poured this beer while holding my nose into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was blond nearly and poured the best head of the night. It was big and white. However the skunk smell made me think something was going to crawl out of it. The beer had a sweet taste that was too much,tasted green. I will not buy again."
"Beer is medium to light bodied, slightly sweet but finishes really nice. Overall its a lot of fun to drink. There is good carbonation in the mouth, the body is right, the flavors are subtle but good. Overall its all excellent. I really enjoyed it."
"A pretty solid Helles, nothing special and not much stood out, but definitely drinkable."
"Value: For $8.99 this is a bargain."
"Nice, chewy medium mouthfeel. I think I could drink plenty of these because of how refreshing they are. Would definately make for a great sessionable beer."
"D: Really high. I could see myself drinking this frequently."
"Could drink an ocean of these. Just a well rounded drinkable beer. Spend the extra few bucks and drink this instead of some corn and rice beer from the states."
"D: I had this beer on tap in Munich and it was a hell of a lot better there. In the bottle this beer is just above average."
"GERMAN beer! finally from the house itself. I loved this beer in the liter glass beer steins with a pork knuckle. Fulfilling taste, grassy, honey malt and hop finish, drinkability is exceptional."
"D: This beer is extremely quaffable. Goes down real easily. My favorite of the non-Doppelbock offerings at Wolff's."
"Poured from a 500 ml brown bottle. Pours with a medium sized head initially that subsides leaving a thin layer of foam and only moderate lacing. Aroma is pleasant but subtle; bready, yeasty notes predominate, with hops far in the background. Taste is malty at first, with citrusy hops notes coming on a bit more in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is very soft and well-rounded with a medium carbonation that feels very suitable for the style. This is a very drinkable beer, and one of the best representatives of the style I have had."
"This beer was excellent on tap - it was also brewed on premises at the Hofbrauhaus in Newport, KY. I finished the half liter and could have easily had another."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a nice mild beer with some flavor and substance that make it worth drinking for a while."
"D: Drink it all day every day, a quintessential Munich Helles lager and a great beer to down on it's own or pair with food. Mine went well with my roast pork loin and spatzle. At about 5% ABV, raise a liter high and session it til dawn."
"MF&D - Well done. Crisp and refreshing. I could drink this one all day."
"Overall I was puzzled by how the botterness came and went like it did. I could not find a brew date so I think it may have been an older beer that I tasted. It is worth another try."
"D: I can really session this beer. At a $1.49 locally for a 22 oz bottle, how can you go wrong?"
"Good german brew, very drinkable. Not spectacluar but there's something very liable about a well made pils."
"D - Excellent drinkability. Great with Brats and other German cuisine."
"D: A good session beer, if not a particularly complex one. The low ABV makes this beer go down very easy."
"Bit of lightly sweet husky grain on the nose, some grassy notes and a light noble hop presence. Just a touch of clean sourness in the yeast. Nicely balanced in flavor and without any false notes. Offers a short dry finish and decent drinkability. Does outgas a bit too swiftly as for carbonation, causing the beer to change character quite a bit and becoming rather flat in the end. Overall decent but somewhat boring and nondescript."
"A good lager that is easy to drink on a poker night."
"Notes: Wow,this was good. Refreshing and such a good session beer."
"This has a good, fresh grainy malt flavor with a fair amount of hop bitterness on the finish. I imagine this is what Euro Pale Lagers strive to be, but this beer is much tastier than any EPL I have had. Goes down unbelievably quick and easy, crisp and refreshing. I am enjoying the helles out of this beer, I need to find me some more. Great summer session beer."
"Recently had Hofbrau Original at a German restaurant on Long Island called The Village Lanterne in Lindenhurst. Great place. Poured a robust gold with a two inch white, foamy head. Left some lacing on the glass. Smell is delicious -- sweet, hoppy, with a faint hint of fruit. Taste is strong & crisp with a dry finish. Very smooth and solid throughout, and easy to drink for a Munich Helles Lager. This would be a good choice for a Bud/Coors drinker wanting something a bit stronger but wary of trying something too far out of their comfort zone. A real beer."
"It tastes very smooth with a nice texture."
"Brown 500ml bottle. A bright clear golden color pour with a soapy whiote head, high carbonation, spotty lacing. Aroma of sweet honey malt,and grassy floral hops. Flavor is nice and hoppy , mostly floral,some grassy aromas, nice level of bitterness, clean crisp flavor and mouthfeel, nice hoppy finish , lightly sweet, a very good drinker and tasty, quite sessionable , would buy this again"
"Haven't had a Helles in awhile. Looks like a your average helles, definitely is decocted from the taste and golden hue of the beer (not as yellow as non-decoctions). Taste is pretty mellow and balanced. Tastes like a less ballsy pilsner urquell, which is odd, because it's actually stronger abv wise, just not as hoppy, which are most certainly saaz hops. Pretty good mouthfeel, and sweet on the tougue. I could drink this like water all day. Pity no american brewery really does a decocted lager. Something to give to your BMC-induced psycosis friends."
"Awesome drinkability. A very refreshing and tasty beer that goes down well."
"Overall a superior German lager."
"I could imagine how much some of you would have liked it from the freshest tap in town!"
"I had this at the Hofbrauhaus last winter, so I was pumped to see it at the local beer emporium. Poured a clear, golden yellow color with two fingers of head that faded slowly with sticky lacing. Has a malty, grainy, slightly sweet smell, with some vegetables in there too. Taste starts out pretty smooth with good mothfeel and some mild bitterness. Maltyness comes through on the tale end and then it finishes pretty clean, if not a bit thin. This is a really nice, balanced beer that's very easy drinking."
"D: Whenever I drink Hofbrau, I am reminded of a quote by A.J. Liebling: ""No sane man can afford to dispense with debilitating pleasures; no ascetic can be considered reliably sane. Hitler was the archetype of the abstemious man. When the other krauts saw him drink water in the Beer Hall they should have known he was not to be trusted."" Anyway, this is a solid German lager. Nothing more, nothing less."
"Definitely drinkable---went great with a cheese/bread snack, and seems perfectly fine tuned for a complex dinner serving or just for grilling out. Great brew---wish I could be sitting in the streets of Munchen sipping on this."
"pours a very pale straw yellow with a nice white foamy head and a small amount of light lace. love the smell, fresh cut grass/hay smells of farm country and herbal notes also. fresh clean malt with a nice hop bitter taste smooth light crisp carbonation adds to the great taste. drinkability anytime all the time. if you like the style you like this beer."
"D The highest and the point of the style."
"A refreshing drop though, to be sure, quite well-balanced and with enough flavour to make it interesting. A solid offering; no brewing pinnacle."
"D - real good German lager, easy to drink."
"Drinkability: Nice but why wasn't this my first lager I tried. Its not earth shaking, but a nice change."
"Good carbonation as well and a bit lighter bodied. This was a real drinker. Went down very easy. A very very nice surprise here, and worth the try."
"Pours with a giant, fluffy white head with loose, airy bubbles. Ramrod-straight carbonation rises continuously from the foot of the glass-- very appealing. Aroma is a bit bitter, with grass, lemon and some oranges; maybe a bit of crispy spice. The taste, however, was a bit sharper than expected: very edgy, bitter, even pucker-inducing. Tasted hoppier than I normally like, but the back end was less zingy than the front. Almost too dry, but still a nice thing to have in the fridge for a hot day or a spicy dinner."
"This is exactly the sort of beer to fall victim to the likes of Budweiser or Tooheys New. This is what a pale lager should be like, and there is unfortunately a prejudice against the style because of the most famous (and poor) examples. Very drinkable, very well made and very enjoyable."
"drinkability is high - this will be a very good sessionable beer for me this summer."
"Drinkability - not the perfect beer in my humble opinion, but a great golden pilsener. The six pack won't last long in the fridge."
"Light copper with a big foamy off white head that lasts for a white leaving nice blobs of lace on the glass. Fresh grain and hay with floral smelling noble hops in the nose. Tastes soft and pure with clean sweet maltiness offset by a nice mild hop bite in the finish. Light and creamy smooth. Highly refeshing and easy to drink."
"Drinkability:what can i say thats never been said ? this is a fine lager the hops are pleasant, tasty and clean ,i`m not the biggest fan but this is nice."
"Drinkability is good. Goes down really smooth and settles really nice."
""
"Drinkability: A flavorful beer, not quite robust. Tastes wonderful, but could have played better in the mouth. Carbonation should not be something a brewer is fearful of, yet the Hofbrau seems as if it is."
"Drinkability: Not bad, but nothing special either. Definitely wouldn't buy it if there were other choices."
"Drinkability: A good refresher, and overall a solid beer. Not the best of the style, but damn good. I wanna have this with a giant buttery pretzel."
"D - To me this is a fancy lawnmower beer good for when its hot out and I want a cold beer I guess the style doesn't get me going all that much"
" It's still quite drinkable, but out of the big Munich six, this is my least favorite Helles."
"This beer looked great, clear and golden. It tasted great too. The taste is clean and crisp, with just a notice of hops. Very refreshing. I think I like Augustiner better, but this is the classic of the style."
"The only complaint I have is that I wish it was a more gold, brighter in color. Otherwise, great helles lager."
"Poured from a 12oz green bottle into a pokal. Clear golden with a two-finger white head that dissipates to a foam film. Little lacing. Smells slightly skunked, but not horrendously so. Faint pilsener malt and grassiness come through after the skunk, along with some definite floral hop aromas. The malt is again very evident on the palate, with quite a bit of grainy character. Bittering hops are there to balance it quite well. Really refreshing. A nicely done helles--would certainly be even better out of a keg."
"Love this beer. I get it on tap at a really good local German restaurant, usually by the 1L. stein. When I can, I also by a couple 500ml bottles at my local major liquor store. In glass, has a great golden color and a huge head, which eventually settles down. Aroma has a nice smooth malt note. Taste is clean, while having an excellent malt and hop balance, and goes great with whatever German dish I'm having at the time (or is good just on it's own). I can't comment on the 12 oz. green glass bottles (the 500 mls are brown). I've read bad reviews for that serving, but can't comment on them as I just prefer having it on tap thru the restaurant. I bet this one is even better in Germany."
"Trailing bitterness leaves you wanting nothing but the next drink - exceptionally enjoyable, and fitting of the season."
" ~ This is a good beer. This is something I will certainly recommend to my friends. I'd really like someday to travel over seas and sample one straight from draft."
"Drinkability: nice medium to light bodied beer with good flavors and lasting taste. If i had to dirnk it only out of 1 litre mas all day, i would drink this beer among a select few for sure. Its a definate session beer."
"Great draft German Lager. Nice golden color and lacing. Held a nice head. Bottled is good, draft is of course always better. Unfortunately this bier is somewhat difficult to get locally, however it is very popular in NYC German bars. Would recommed to anyone looking for a decent German lager. A must at the Munich Oktoberfest!"
"Don't miss out on this beer. Simple and delicious. Thanks for the sampling Hyland24."
"Tap. Pours clear light gold with a minimal white head. Metallic and sour malt aroma. The taste is just like a pilsener. Light pale malt, a bit of saaz sweetness, and sharp metal. Very easy to put down a lot of these. Just not as as good as the hefeweizen."
"This was an okay beer enjoyed cold on a hot day, but nothing special."
"Very drinkable, I could easily see having this as an everyday beer. It would be a good watching-the-game or grilling-some-brats kind of beer. This type of beer wouldn't normally be my bag but this one is really well done."
"Drinkability and overall: It's actually an OK beer. Nothing spectacular, but very drinkable....this almost seems like damning with faint praise (cf: the current light beer ads in the US that plug drinkability), but it's not. Not very memorable."
"hoping this was just a lousy specimen and am probably willing to try once more some day, but j.p. henley's is supposed to be a decent place and i asked them about freshness to try to ensure a good experience. disappointing."
"Poured from green bottle to HB pilsner glass a clear golden yellow with a solid inch of white foam and a heavy bubble rise. Very fresh clean smell of grass and malts. Taste is crisp with grains and sweet malts and just enough hop bitterness to balance it out. Very crisp feel and this one goes down very easy. A solid choice of a six pack to keep stocked at all times."
"What happened? This has to be the first beer in a brown bottle I've had that's been legitimately and strongly skunked. Eventually the nasty aroma faded, but what was left wasn't terribly impressive. Just light caramel and bready malts without much else going on. This is a generally a clean and pleasing beer, but I've had better."
"D: Very drinkable. Guess I was expecting more though as I had tried several of their offerings."
"Not bad at all. You could do much worse."
"This is classic Munich Helles for anyone wondering what the style really ought to taste like!"
"Now, I just have to find my way to Munich so I can appreciate it as intended."
"The firm carbonation and light flavor combine with a wonderfully complex and balanced profile to yield a remarkably drinkable brew. Kripes, it's no wonder the Germans consume so much beer. If I had cheap, easy access to this stuff I'd have it for breakfast!"
"Hofbrau Original poured a light gold with a small white head. The smell was all hops. Taste was great. Crisp hop flavors. And became malty sweet when it warmed a bit. Very refreshing. Mouthfeel was good, refreshing, with good carbonation. Drinkability was nice, crisp and refreshing. Nice summer beer. I enjoyed this a good deal."
"The room temperature thing is the best way to drink this beer. I feel it would lose a lot of flavor being served ice cold. I found that out the hard way. I purchased a case of Hofbrau Original and was simply disappointed. All the original flavor and taste were gone. However, I did find drinking the bottle at room temperature made it a little better."
"On this occasion, the beer was presented to me in a 1-liter glaskrug, with little head. It looked like your average clear, golden-colored lager, with little smell. However, it went down deliciously smooth. Light body with balanced hop and malt flavors made this a very fresh brew I could have kept drinking all night."
"D - good session beer - very enjoyable; defines the style nicely"
"Summary: My favorite of the German lager crowd...actually one of my favorite beers period. More substantial in body and taste than most in this genre."
"I used to drink this alot back in the 70s when I lived in California and I'm pleased to say, it's still a damn good Lager. Could I session on it? You betchya!"
"D- This one isn't even worth trying from a bottle."
"D: A one."
"An easily drinkable brew and one I enjoyed consuming in large quantities when visiting the Hofbrauhaus. This particular review is from a bottle purchased here in the States, and from the best of my memory it's not quite as enjoyable as the on tap version straight from the ""Haus"" itself. Of course my surroundings and company at the time may have had something to do with that, lol."
"This was a wonderful Helles, with the crisp maltiness one would expect from German lager. Sparingly hopped, but enought to balance well. Show this to a lover of the Macros and they might convernt yet! I wish however, that they were in brown bottles, because I got that slight skunkyness from UV reaction. Such a terrible mistake for a good beer"
"This is about as mellow and smooth as a beer can get. Again this is a benchmark for what a lager should be, especially speaking at the macro level."
"This is better than American macros, but it will still fall into the lawn-mower category for me. I'd love to see more bite to the taste and higher complexity."
"I poured the beer into a clear glass and it poured a light golden color. At first sniff I got a slight skunky smell. This turned me off at first. The smell kind of went away after it sat in the glass for a minute or two. But it didn't go away completely. Every time I took a sip I got a slight sniff of skunkyness. Don't get me wrong, the taste of the beer isn't to bad. I've had this beer before and don't remember it having a skunky smell. I'll try this beer again at a later date. Maybe the beer I had has been on the shelf for a while."
"What a treat from draft. Enjoyed in a narrow 22 ounce schooner at Gustav's J√§gerhaus in Anaheim, this beer hit the spot with a dinner entree of three different sausages and a pork chop. Smooth, lemon sweet, and quite a malty lager. The flavor sits and dissolves on the tongue leaving flavor goodness the way milk chocolate melts in your mouth. More please!"
"This is usual beer, which I actually buy by the case. My staple beer, as it were."
"Pours from a green bottle a clear goden yellow with several fingers of pillowy white fluff that leaves behind awesome amounts of thick stickieness as is recedes to a thin cap.The nose is grainy and a little spicy with some hops easily detected.The taste is buttery and buiscuity with a terrific balance of ingredients,light earthy grassy notes blend with a strong malty backbone that ends with a calm sweetness that almost goes without notice.The body is nice and light,with minimal carbonation and a nice skunky/funky Euro finish that lasts between sips.This would make a great summer thirst quencher,or a great winter one for that matter."
"I've been a a beer lover since the age of five when my dad gave me my first sips. His staple beer was Reingold!( of all things!) I have a lot of favorites, but this is definitely way up there. It's simple and uncomplicated...to me it's delicious beer!!!!"
"The taste is creamy malty grain, bread, lemon, pine. It's zesty, smooth, full-bodied, yet rather crisp ans very refreshing. It's on the sweeter side but with a nice light, aromatic bitterness especially in the finish. It goes incredibly well with food and is exceedingly drinkable."
"While not the greatest, there is a reason why this is a classic. This beer does just what a macro can do, but with much more taste."
"D: A great lager with nothing but positive and no real weak point aside from the green bottle."
"Now this is the epidemy of the perfect German helles lager! A great staple for Oktoberfest this beer just makes you want to get a bunch of buddies, drink, and have a jolly great time. I enjoyed it nicely chilled in a pint glass. Poured a piercing golden color with a pleasantly sweet aroma. The taste was smooth with a well balanced malt foward goodness. The price is decent to so stock up and drink till your heart is content!"
"D - Moderate drinkability. Nice hop character, but a bit too sweet to be quite as sessionable as a helles should be."
"This is a great lager that grows on you as you drink. The green bottle be damned!! I like this beer. I can't wait to have a cold one this summer after mowing the lawn."
"Light gold, with a yeasty lager like, and slight hop aroma. Taste is lightly yeasty, malty, with a nice noticeable hop twang to it as well. Touch of tartness to it. Crisp carbonation and decent mouthfeel. Nothing too special, but for what it is, it seems well enough made. Decent, drinkable beer."
"Well carbonated, with a very smooth mouthfeel and a dry finish. Crisp and clean. Really drinkable."
"Definitely recommended."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Great action in the mouth right from the start, becoming creamier and easy to swallow at the end. A classic, solid beer that I am so glad to be able to purchase locally. It's in a green bottle, so pay attention to exposure to light in your store."
"poured a 12 ounce green bottle into a 16 ounce pilsner glass. it poured a long lasting nice 2 finger thick foamy head. a bit cloudy and golden in color. smelled of noble hops followed by a slight skunky aroma. feels creamy and well balanced on the palate with a faint alcohol burn on the finish. nice and smooth taste, refreshing, good grainy flavor not too bitter. i can see myself killing a sixer of this stuff."
"D- Very smooth any yet again crisp...very nice."
"Light golden yellow, clear body. Fluffy, marshmallow, inch of cloud white head. Toasted malts, fresh hay, and slightly skunky, yet very herbal and assertive, hop aromas. Bready malts and spicy noble hops up front. The hops could be fresher and they show some skunkiness. Toasted notes and cardboard around a fruitier malt center. Mild cooked vegetable flavor. Bitter, spicy, herbal hop finish. Quite dry and appetizing. Moderate body with refreshing carbonation. Not bad, but probably better at the ""haus."""
"Drinkability- Aside from the aroma (which really isn't that objectionable) , this is an all around good beer. I would definitely give it a whirl."
"Overall impression: Very drinkable and interesting enough to keep me coming back."
"Sampled at the Odds and Ends Tasting II on 10/19/07: Pours a clear golden color with a medium thin and frothy white head that diminshes steadily. Spots of lacing. Lightly floral nose with spots of fruit and malt. Light body with flavors of grain, malt and fruit. The finish is mildly bitter and short. Pretty average all around."
"D - Not horrible but really did nothing for me. May as well drink something like locally brewed stella."
"In summary, I felt that this was a good beer, but nothing special. Refreshing and light, I felt that there are better beers out there of this style."
"A very good beer. A lawnmower beer for those with a couple extra bucks."
"Notes: A solid, crisp, refreshing lager. Not necessarily the best around, but a worthy choice, and very drinkable."
"Update: I pored a 500 ml bottle into a large Spaten mug. It had a bone white head and dense lacing. The head receded slowly from a one inch head to an even cover and then to a ring around the collar. Nice malty aroma with pleasant mouth feel. Refreshing and easy to drink. [03-01-08]"
"D: Could have several of these, as they're so easy to drink. I believe being available on tap helped out. Balance and subtlety is the key here, and Hofbrau does it well."
"Low quality beer in my opinion."
"D: Very good, an easy drinking Helles, for an easy-drinking day, and one of the cheaper German beers on the market today, and easy to find, so that is a plus."
"D: Very drinkable indeed. A high quality lager."
"D - A nicely hopped and crisp late German lager. Very easy to quaff, but not overly dynamic."
"Overall: refreshing and pleasant beer. Not much body or flavour though."
"This is a great example of a Munich helles beer (great balance of malt and hops). I've actually been to Munich Germany and had this on tap which was great. In bottle its almost as good but it's not like you get to go to Munich every day."
"Overall: No doubt this is an old sample; I need to be careful when I buy lagers, etc. from this particular store. Otherwise, a good example of the style, drinkable and refreshing. Worth a try."
"D- This beer has some nice malt and grain qualities but there are some off flavors that get in the way. I didn't mind drinking an American pint of this beer but I couldn't drink a full liter."
"The beer looked good, if for no other reason than the large volume sitting before me with a massive, long-lasting, bubbly froth on top. Yeah, maybe the Helles was a good call. The smell says otherwise, just a clean aroma, maybe a little malty in a wishfully bready way, but maybe too neutral to tell. The flavor was the same, malty if anything but not so much so as to remark about. The mouthfeel was OK, crisp and carbonated, refreshing and easily drinkable. Anyway I pounded that liter like nobody's business, so I could order the dunkel weisse. I can recommend this as a reasonable and authentice Munich Helles, but really there are others in Munich which are better."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Smooth and velvety creamy on the palate. Light carbonation bubbles dance over the tongue with a medium-light body. This beer is easy to drink, I can see it pairing with many foods quite nicely. Not a brew I'd seek out to buy, then again nothing I'd shun, I would definitely like to explore this style of beer more though before coming back to this one. Well, nothing really to write home about I guess, just average."
"D - A good lager. Not my favorite style, but this is a great example of one. Fairly archetypal."
"D - To me, this is the ideal six pack beer. You know what you're going to get every time and you aren't so much concerned with complex flavors or drinking a meal. This is a very enjoyable session beer to have in social settings."
"12oz green bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a pale golden yellow color with lively bubbles rising to the top to produce a small white head. The aroma is really nice with malt and some grassy hops. The taste is malt flavors with a nice slightly spicy hop finish. Overall, this is a very nice brew and is a perfect session brew for the hot Florida summers."
"It¬ís okay. Nothing special, unexpected, or bad."
"I normally drink this one straight from the bottle- don't like it quite as well now that Im drinking it from a glass..."
"12 oz. bottle- color is golden , with a white head - nose of sweet corn , grassy , hay , cider , bready , slight hops , and malt ¬ñ taste of sweet corn , grassy , hay , cider , bready , slight hops , and malt - body is light , crisp , and with medium carbonation ¬ñ aftertaste is sweet , short , and slightly bitter"
"Gem√ºtlichkeit!"
"I could have a few... 4, 5 of these, then I need some hops!"
"I'm using my pokal for a second Helles tonight, and I'm hoping for better results. The HB version raises a very white, thin head over a clear, golden body with some copper color in it. The nose has a muted malt character, with a bit of noble hops. Very mild. The taste is somewhat dry, with a ild hop bitterness, with some metallic qualities. Again, it's balanced but not distinguished. The mouth is medium-light with high but fine carb. Not much here, but it would be fun in a biergarten."
"The taste is ultra smooth. A very clean, refreshing flavor of grains, malt and oily hops make this a balanced, easy drinking lager. It's not going to set the world on fire, but as a session beer it's very solid."
"pour a deep golden hue with lots of foam and lots of carbonation present, smells slightly of hops and corn and malt. alcohol warms the tounge and the beer excites it, tastes damn good, pardon my french, i'm not a giant lager fan but this is like folgers, good till the last drop, i can drink it all night long, shame its 11 bucks for a 6 pack"
"I like it without falling in love with it."
"Poured a clear straw color with a nice white head that left some spot lacing. The smell was not pronounced but did have a grassy smell to it. The taste is very light malt and very light hop. This is what the American macro lagers should taste like. I don't understand why they need to add corn/rice. This is a very drinkable lager. Crisp, clean goes down way too easy. Good show."
"A solid brew. A little bitter at the finish but beautiful balance for a light bodied lager. Far more and better hops than most in this genre. You can taste the freshness of the hops as they emit a natural grassy or green leaf like undertone in the beer...VERY drinkable..I'm gonna have to head back down to greeny's..I love this stuff. Wow the Germans really do this style right in all the ways we do it wrong....No adjuncts..fresh taste..distinctive...a nice bitter/flavor bite....I like beer with my beer and as far as lagers go this is top notch."
"This a nice tasting German lager. It has bigger bite than most American lagers and is pretty refreshing. Has a large grassy hop taste to it and mouthfeel is medium. Overall a pretty decent brew. It would probably taste better if I was sitting in Munich. Anybody want to help me out with that?"
"Served in a pilsner glass, the beer pours a clear pale gold color with a nice white head with a good bit of lacing. It smells like grain/bread, grassy hops, and some malt. The beer tastes like sweet malt, grain, and has a slight hoppy bitter finish. Nice flavor and good balance. The mouthfeel is light to medium, and the drinkability is high, as it's crisp and refreshing. Overall I think it's a pretty good lager. I'd definitely drink this again."
"Flavours initially of the malt. But, fresh floral, herbal hops come through, with a medium bitterness, and clean finish."
"D - It is pretty good. It is a very easy drinking beer."
"A pretty ideal session beer. Should've picked up more than one half liter bottle."
"Medium golden color with a nice creamy white head. Moderate lacing. Smells a bit grassy but more bready and honeyish. Taste has a touch sweetness but more of an underlying biscuity maltiness. Smooth creamy flavor. Good floral hop throughout finishes with a bit of spicyness. Yeast really smooths this out. Solid flavor, easy to drink."
"Pretty easy drinking lager. A solid malty but not sweet beer but that's about it. Not really any remarkable specialty malt that would make it more interesting."
"D: This is a pretty good beer overall."
"I'll take this over a pils any day, but still on the thin side. Good for a hot night."
"D - Drinkable. Not a bad brew, but will not buy again."
"Overall i see this beer as being a little bit simple, but still good."
"This is an OK Munich Helles Lager. As a beer it's good, but it's missing the spices, the fruit, and the hops in the taste. Not bad, but I'd rather buy Spaten for the same price."
"Very standard and ordinary beer. Difficult, yet finess in it's simplicity. Mildly malty with solid noble hop spiciness. Lightly earthy, grassy, and fruity. Light apples and pears. Medium body makes it very drinkable with a clean light finish. Difficult to praise, but tough to criticize also. The look is the typical moderately carbonated, crystal clear straw hue. Nice loosely laced carbonation. Pretty good beer to chase a braw with."
"An excellent Eurolager...crisp, refreshing, very nicely balanced, and easy to drink with soft bitterness. I will remember this one and pick some up next time, especially considering it's a good price."
"Drinkabilty - goes down easy, would be a decent, but not great session beer."
"Nice and refreshing beer for summer. I bet it's better when it's brewery fresh."
"Highly drinkable, well crafted lager. Nothing fancy but a solid old-world attempt at a classic lager beer style."
"Overall, a solid and tasty brew. On the hoppy side for a helles, but not overly so."
"This is pretty much your run-of-the-mill Helles Lager. Pours a golden yellow and has a thin white head. Tasted refreshing and Pilsner-esque. It's not that memorable or remarkable, but it's better than any macro. A very drinkable beer, and would be very refreshing after a hard day's work. I recommend giving it a try."
"Drinkability in High as there is nothing distastefull, and it goes well with food. MK"
"It poured a ratehr weak-looking pale hay color with almost no head. It did have a lot of large bubbles, significantly larger than most other beers I've encountered. The aroma was almost non-existant, possibly some sweet malts, or grain, but thats about it. But the best is yet to come. The taste was wonderful. Very dry, with sweet and slightly roasted malts, grains, mild floral hops and almost no alcohol presence. I thought ""Pilsner"" with each sip[. Mouthfeel was semi-sweet to start but finished very dry and clean, with a smooth aftertaste for such a dry beer. I could have had these all night. I loved it and although this isn't technically a Pilsner, any fan of the style will love this beer."
"Musings: I usually keep some around as it get warmer. Deals on this stuff are usually good. Find some - you'll drink a bunch of it."
"Drinkability: I would say extreme ! Very nice to drink ice cold in a very hot sunny day wherever..."
"Opinion: This is a really tasty beer, and a great example of a helles. It has a rich malty backbone with enough supporting flavors to make is a super palatable and drinkable beer. I am not sure which I would choose over this or Paulaner, but this is a really nice beer, and one that I will definitely drink again."
"D - Great drinkability. Could drink one after another. Recommend this as a session beer."
"Oh man, why don't brewers in America believe in decoction mashing? This beer is a beauty . . . light and smooth with a pleasant hop boquet. This beer makes me fall in love with beer all over again. Honestly, I ask you, what more could you want in a beer? Simply wonderful."
"There's something about the Hofbr√§u Lager that just makes you want more, and that's something you have to respect."
"Per Label: ""Since 1589"" & ""Munich Specialty"""
"This beer poured a clear golden straw color with a thin white head sustained by a field of bubbles from the bottom. Smelled of a sour dry lager with a dusty coffee dryness and a musky sweetness. My nostalgia for the Hofbrauhaus wants to rate this higher than it deserves, but it is a distinct smell not soon forgotten. Tastes of light pungent and doughy grains with a nip of sour and a creamy dryness. Finishes exceptionally crisp and dry. Mouth feel is light to medium bodied with a light carbonation. This is an ultimately drinkable beer."
"Had this at the Hofbrauhause in Munich. Presentation in a liter stein is enough to warrant an exceptional appearance score alone, add to that a classic pilsner color and frothy head and you have a winner. The smell was a bit mroe than subtle, the pilsner hops were there, but a general smell of freshness is most prevalent. Taste is classic. Exactly what I would expect from this beer. The flavor is not over the top at any point, exceptional balance between malt and not too outragous amount of hops, but the hops are the dominant flavor. This beer is not trying to grab your attention; it's a classic case of less is more. This is one beer everyone should have on tap to understand the style and intention of the beer. In the US there is a mentality that every beer has to try to ""out do"" the competition and grab our attention. That¬ís not the case here; you will actually be wowed at the fact of how a simple beer can be so great. Mouthfeel is smooth and watery, refreshing and light. And drinkability is insane, to be served in a liter stein this thing has to be drinkable and that it is."
"D - Very nice drinkability. Simple but very pleasing. I am impressed with the rich, sweet flavor of this German beer. I will be drinking this again."
"poured an absolutely crystal clear pale golden color with abundant white puffy head. Smell is lightly malty. Taste is nice and crisp with a good malt presence and some hops coming through. Finish is cold, light and refreshing, andvery pleasant in the mouth. A nice easy-drinking beer."
"overall- a great beer to have at any time. Nothing really overly stands out, but its just a solid, easy to drink beer. Reccomended."
"This is not my favorite style of beer but i figured I'd try to expand my palate and give it a try. Poured a very transparent pale yellow with a light white head.The Nose I quite enjoyed with very herbal/floral notes suggesting the dominance of hops over malt in this one. Taste is bright and fresh with a surprising amount of maltiness to the middle but ending in pure hops with tart evergreen flavors. A nice clean, quenching lager and one that has opened up my eyes to the more positive aspects of the style."
"pours a nice clean golden. smells sweet, like honey. a bit doughy. taste? very good. sweet (once again honey!). a little biscuity, straw, clean. clean is a flavor right? crisp and well carbonated. has session written all over it. summer brew for sure."
"Pint poured at the Essen Haus in Madison, WI. Hofbrau Original has a clear, yellow color with just a small head. Bready aroma with a little honey and grassy hops. The mouthfeel is a little thin, but the flavor is still pretty good. Malty flavor up front with spicy hops in the finish. Slightly lemony flavor too. High carbonation. A little watery. Great drinkability, but other than that this beer is only slightly better than average."
"Well worth a try."
"Hofbr√§u is best known as the brewery that gave birth to the weizenbier and perhaps the bock bier. It is one of the famous ""six sisters"" of M√ºnchen, and supplier to one of the most famous bierhalle in universe. Naturally, my expectations were high. When I poured the beer there wasn't much foam although plenty of carbonation, perhaps too much? It smelled hoppy amd tasted bitter with a touch of citrus and a little herbs. It had a crisp and full taste but didn't quite reach the heavenly heights of a Czech pilz like D√©mon. It's good, no doubt about it, but it will never be a five-sweep field marshal in the battle of European lagers."
"This is a very drinkable session beer."
"The color is honey golden with a large, frothy head. The retention is a little bit less than I expected, but not bad. The aroma is of light, sweet bready German malts. Smell could be a little stronger. The taste has the classic Munich malt flavor with a touch of straight-up grain towards the finish. Light noble hops mostly provide a balance. This is another in a long line of tasty German beers, my only complaint here is that I think the malt flavor could have had more depth. I bet this is truly excellent fresh at the Hofbrauhaus."
"John"
"Very extraordinarily drinkable. After all, meant to be drunk by the liter."
"Sweet grains with a grass flavor quality to each sip. Nicely balanced as well. Very clean, crisp, refreshing and drinkable. A solid Helles Lager and perfect after a hot day like today."
"This is the classic for the style. It is a very drinkable beer but I am not in love with this one."
"Music: Deutschland ≈∞ber Alles."
"Pours a beautiful yellow-orange with a pure white (though fleeting) head. Smells of hops, musty organics, and a slight, ambiguous sweetness. The hops are quite strong on the tongue, perhaps overpowering. There is a thin, butterscotch finish that tastes a little artificial, but still nice. The strength of the hops is tamed by a striking lack of carbonation. More balance is needed here. In the end, the faults are noted, but this is still a very good beer."
"It's refreshing, smooth and clean. Uncomplicated yet well-balanced. One to keep in stock."
"Inexpensive when compared to ¬Ä2.80 for a Westmalle dubbel (330ml), or ¬Ä3.15 for a 500ml Poperings Hommelbier purchased at the same time. But price isn't everything!"
"Hofbrau Original (think my bottle with the upside down label is worth anything?) is a good example of the Munich Helles style even if it isn't among my favorites. Although it lacks that certain something that would garner effusive praise, there isn't much wrong with it either. I think it all comes down to the fact that this style isn't a 'boat floater' for me."
"Mouthfeel is fairly light; just shy of medium."
"Pours medium deep gold, grain and malt both evident in the nose. creamy white head. Slightly sweet flavor, somewhat grainy and malty. Slight hop flavor. Medium body, no fruitiness or astringency. Mouthfeel is medium and drinkable, finishes slightly sweet."
"It pours a slightly pale golden colour in a half-pint glass, with overly abundant carbonation and a thin white head which quickly disappears. It doesn't look quite right, I think... On the nose there is very lively, dryish and toasty lager malt, with undertone of delicate, grassy hops. Smells not too bad but of just average quality for any interesting lager. On the palate a lemony taste dominates, with chewy bready maltiness underneath...quite clean and dry in the finish with a touch of delicate aromatic hops. Fortunately there is no suggestion of unpleasant, residual sugary mouthfeel in the finish, as often appears in a lot of cheap Euro lagers, but overall the aftertaste falls a bit short. A light-bodied, medium-flavoured lager, it's quite drinkable but easily getting boring... I look forward to trying Hofbr√§u Original and see how different it is from this replica by the Badger."
"A little too carbonated. But thats Ok with me. Pretty good beer."
"Very smooth and drinkable. A decent German lager."
"Looks great, crystal clear yellow, white frothy head that stayed. Smell was malty but lacked some of the sweetness the others have. Taste was a little surprizing in that it was more highly hopped than I'm used to in a Helles, it was more like a pils IMHO. Mouthfeel was full and foamy, and of course I could drink this one happily. Unfortunately, this one is beaten hands down by the more available Spaten and Paulaner."
"Pours a clear straw color, minimal head. Aroma is kinda nice, grassy and grainy. Taste is fairly rich and full of malt. Nice. Mouthfeel is thick and lush. My only rant about this beer is yes, it is good, but I paid $2 a bottle at a party store. It's not bad, but it's not that good."
"Mouthfeel and, in particular, drinkability is as good as it gets. This one is for having more than one. Especially in the social outlet such as a biergarden."
"You've got to dig the back label text that promotes the ""fine harsh aroma"". Let's not put a red satin thong on a fat, pimply ass and tell you it's good, let's endorse our 'bare' fat, pimply ass as the original. Grain laden nose touched by butter and matchsticks escorts a wash of honey drizzled weeds. It's a good beer here, imagine a liter or two in Munich."
"Overall, I might order one of these at a restaurant, but I don't think I would drink more than one of these at a time. I'd want to go for something more adventurous after one of these."
"Drinkability ¬ñ This is why I wish I lived in Germany."
"An underappreciated style, I admit I find Helles beers a bit bland. This example is clean and quite drinkable, though."
"500 ml bottle purchased cold from the Beer Depot (Ann Arbor, Michigan) and consumed later the same evening in December 2004. I did not expect this beer to hold up to my memories of the beers served in the actual Hofbrauhaus from earlier this year. This beer was, however, enough of a shadow of those beers to almost bring a fond tear to my eye. Poured a crystal clear rich golden straw with a delectible 4 finger head that had the consistency of clingy marangue. Smelled of noble hop (possibly Tettnanger) a non-descript sweet, and perhaps some grain. Medium-light body. Tastes sweet with some hop character. The sweet is mildly grainy, but clear and clean of fruit, with a possible tiny hint of tannic. There is a small bit of metallic to the hop. Finished somewhat dry with a fine carbonation originating off the flat of my tongue. An acceptable beer, but nothing close to the quality of a fresh one at the brew house in Munchen. Now if I could only get something that tastes like the cheese-bread/pretzel thingies!"
"Nice drinkable brew might could be stronger in body."
"Tiny print on the back lable did have the curious description ""full bodied, refeshing and fine harsh aroma have made it world famous."" Fine harsh aroma? I think something was lost in translation."
"This is a sentimental favorite of mine. First had it in the mid 70's when I was drinking mainly macros. It showed me beer could actually have flavor. It disappeared for a long time. Good to see it back on the west coast after a long absence."
"A solid if unspectacular helles. Would be fine for a crowd with mixed preferences."
"Mixed sixers of some decent brews for only $5.00! How can I go wrong??? I scarfed this one up in one of my sixers. I was expecting another pale Euro lager and I was pleased when I popped the cap to smell something similiar to Vienna style lager only lighter in the malt aspect. The strength of the nose seemed to fade pretty quickly though. It poured a light golden color with a whispy white head on top. Taste was very clean with a pleasant noble hop bite present at the end. Very well balanced. Mouthfeel wasn't as thin as I was expecting (thank god). This could be a superb session beer and I'll definately be picking more of these up if I get into a lager kick anytime soon."
"light on mouthfeel which is not bad at all. keeps you from filling up, and keeps the beer refreshing."
"Drinkability - allright."
"The mouthfeel was crisp and clean, with a slightly dry finish. Lighter bodied with relatively strong carbonation. A perfect beer to have with german sausages or a large pretzel."
"Pours a very clear pale golden color with lots of bubbles racing towards the massive 2-1/2 finger white pillowy head. The smell consists of a slightly tangy grain, hops, and with a touch of a sticky sweet aroma. The taste starts with a grainy malt taste that starts smooth and fades to an astringent hoppy flavor and ending with a sticky dry bitterness. This is a light bodied beer that goes down fairly easy. Prosit!"
"Served at a German restaurant in Moscow, this most famous of beers came out a deep clear gold with lots of bubbles under a 1.5 finger white head that displayed very good retention and some nice lace. The nose features some sweet malt, but is very subdued. The mouth is fairly prickly and surprisingly heavy. The taste knocked me out with the tons and tons and tons of malt - sweet, bready barley all over the place. There's a bit of hoppy bitterness in the finish, but not enough to overpower the malt. The aftertaste reflects the bready sweetness. Definitely a unique Helles."
"Another import served at Chicago's downtown Christmaskindlmart. Noticeably darker than the normal straw colored lager. Taste was surprisingly complex, too. The hop profile was almost flowery. This was served pretty cold, but some nice aspects came through. Malt taste was actually held back a little. I suppose this is more representative of the M√ºnich style of Helles. Very nice."
"Uncomplicated decent brew. For those in OZ you can pick up bottles of these at the same price as VB (about $2 ea.). I know what I'll be drinking."
"Enjoyed on tap at the Restaurant section of the main Hofbrauhaus in Munich."
"Overall Impression: A well-made beer, just a touch on the light side for my tastes and my expectations of the style. Would make a good session beer, and as a positive note: my wife liked it. Would make a good transition/‚Äôconverting the Bud Lite‚Äô crowd beer. If you are a malt monster, or a hop head, give it a pass, but this lighter beer has some merit."
"This is an excellent lager beer. This stuff smells great. It smells like fresh floral hops, and heavy german malts. The taste is just like the smell...This is a malty german style lager. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing, and this beer goes amazingly well with German food, such as Bratwursts. The drinkability is excellent as well."
"Poured a very clear pale yellow color. Bubbly and lively with a large foamy head that settled in to a meringue-like cream. The aroma is strong with lemon grass and a vegetable like grainy smell. Earthy. Taste is sweet and crisp. A beautiful and simple beer. Very drinkable."

"A bit more golden in color than the light. Another faint, off-white fizzy head. Lots of freshly mown hay, grass, and other grainy smells. Some hops fade in and out. Good crisp lager flavors. Definitly some more toasted qualities to it. Light snappy hop kick, warms at times. Freshly mown hay again, some slight herbals as well. Light bodied, not much to it, easy to drink, but very tasty. Refreshing crisp, traditional lager. I think this would be great with a nice grilled bratwurst and saurkraut."
"It pours with a nice straw-colored liquid and thick frothy white head. The aroma is nice and yeasty, with some nice hops and malt undertones. The beer is nicely carbonated, which gives a nice bite to the taste, complementing the good grainy lager taste and mild hops bitterness. Very clean tasting, with a nice light mouthfeel. Very, very drinkable."
"Clean crisp lager with an extremely fresh taste. Nice medium golden color with a decent white head. Not much aroma, a bit of malt and a bit of hops. Just really clean with a noteable bitterness on the finish. Hard to beat a fresh lager for just pure drinkability, either alone or with food."
"Would be nice with some spicy food. (I had some vegetarian chili with mine.) :)"
"Notes: This lager has grown on me over the summer and has won a spot in my fridge, a plate of grilled bratwurst and braised cabbage went perfect with this brew."
"Brown 500 ml bottle."
"A very good lager beer brewed on the original Munich recipe. The body is a beautiful clear gold with a small white head and plenty of lacing. The nose is all lager giving hints of malt and the balancing hops. Nicely flavored, this beer provides a delicately balanced flavor perfectly poised between its sweet and bitter sides. Very drinkable and thirst quenching, my drinking companion was downing these like water, though he did show signs of getting quite swacked."
"Had this out in a bier garten yesterday and it just seemed to hit the spot best out of all the brews I had.Poured a nice golden color with medium head that left some lacing,smell was slightly malty and very juicy fruity,very appetizing.Taste was a little fruity and grainy,very quaffable warm weather beer great for sitting outsied under the beer tent."
"Clear Gold in color with a foamy white head and thin trails of lace. Bright hoppy aroma and pleasant sweet malt smell. Medium sweet malt and fairly high in citrus and light metallic bitterness. Lightly Sweet and Herbal. This is a fine example of what a lager is. Very drinkable. Bring on the summer and an umpah band!"
"This is better at the source...from the bottle it's pleasant and easy to drink, but not a lot of complexity in the taste. pat"
"Brilliantly clear dark straw hue. Fluffy, thick, well retained porcelain white head leaves lace. The aroma is comprised of a lemony, lightly grassy Tettanger hop nose, along with softly sweet, grainy malt with a tinge of husk. Bready, white cracker like sweetness upfront in flavor is followed by a combination of mild, non astringent grain husk and soft, almost airy hop bitterness. Subdued grassy, vegetal hop adds an earthy tone and couples with the grainy malt presence to lend an impression of rustic, hay like sweetness mid palate. Lightly bodied, but with supple dextrins faciltating a smooth, agreeably inobtrusive mouthfeel. Finishes with a tinge of honeyish must and underbaked dough, but otherwise clean and dry. Balanced, innocuous and quaffable in its current state-- Could be an outstanding helles if sampled at the source of found fresh. Soft and tasty."
"I had this on tap at the Hofbrauhaus Newport served in a .5L mug. The color is a typical golden lager color with a finger of head and lots of lacing left on the glass. The smell is a little weak, just a faint hint of hops. The taste is a pretty good balance of piney sweetness and hops. The mouthfeel is fairly ok, and the drinkability is good. Pretty good for a run-of-the-mill lager."
"Noticeably more body on the front side of the taste, a more solid mouthfeel, as it should. Hop presence about the same, fairly detectable and in pretty good balance with the beer style. Definitely more personality in this beer, and I do perceive a taste in there that could be interpreted as skunkyish. I can see where that characteristic comes from now. Not offensive, I just noticed it. A very drinkable session beer."
"Drinkability/notes: Other than the skunk characteristic, quite good. I would like to try this in the larger brown glass version."
"This is probably one of the worst examples of German beer I've had recently and the fact that it was a freebee from the store owner where I bought a case of good beers from didn't help any. It was probably old to begin with and so this may not be a fair review but then few have given it a decent rating here. Looks promising in trhe glass but the flavor is not of a good lager. Kind of flat tasting with little character. Almost reminds me of some basic American lagers in that respect. Slightly bitter and with an unpleasant aftertaste."
"This particular brew poured an average white foamy head. There was very little lacing on the sides of my glass. It had a malty aroma to it. It was yellow in body. It had a slight bitterness to it. There was also noticed a slight aftertaste with this brew."
"Pours a yellow golden straw color with a foamy white head that fades into a semi-sticky lace. Nose is sweet malts and grains blended with some strong notes of herbal and perfumey hops. Light to medium in body with a very smooth texture. Taste starts off sweet with notes of malt and fresh grain as well as some biscuity flavors. This is followed by some astringent husk flavors and a good amount of bitter hops leading to a dry finish. An enjoyable lager and a nice choice for a hot day."
"There's an interesting flowery element to a sweet, grainy nose. The front is sweetish, lagery. Apples in the middle give way to a lagery bitter finish. There's a little alcohol evident in the bitter, grainy aftertaste. This is ok, not better than that."
"It's a very drinkable and unexciting German pale lager. Pours pale of course, the head diminishes to nothing too quickly. Some hops and a little sweetness in the aroma. Mouthfeel is watery thin and crisp, with some hops coming through in a the flavor a little bit, as well as some skunkiness. The skunkiness was very small though, just a hint. Pretty refreshing qualities here, a solid lager that's good for the summer."
"Clear, golden colored beer with a white head. Leaves a good amount of lacing. Aroma is of sweet German malts and hops. The flavor is sweet, and bread. It is a smooth drinking and clean beer. It is refreshing and easy drinking. Would be a good beer for a warm summer‚Äôs day. Just not too memorable."
"A very good German-style pils/lager style brew. A great light golden color with a wonderful German-beer aroma at the start. The head is light, lacey, and fast-fleeting. The aroma and flavor are everything a good German brew should be. Well worth seeking out if available in your area. Prost!"
"Nearly a year and a half later (5.3.04) and perhaps from a fresher sample than before. There is still a healthy complement of astringency, only this time the malt element is smooth and honeyed underneath. Not a delicately styled lager; it is wildly doughy and aromatic with massive, chewy suggestions of freshly cracked grain. No trace of dilution in this one."
"a quality german lager. bitter a crisp, this one goes down great. i would say it is of higher quality than a becks, but it is not near the level of hacker-pschorr or spaten. it was a very enjoyable beer."
"Promising aroma, sweetish start, relatively bitter, slightly hoppy finish, a bit of a chemically preservative taste in the finish, but very enjoyable, highly drinkable."
"It doesn't get much better than this. It's hard to equal the atomsphere in the Hofbrauhaus in Munich. Loud, raucous, fun. The beer's not half bad either. The klink of the liter sized mug against the tap of the oak barrel...music to my ears. Though the atomosphere may be even larger than the beer itself, it doesn't take a thing away from the experience."
"Pours a nice shiny golden color, with a nice fluffy white head which dissapates towards the end. A very nice and highly noticable herbal hop aroma on the nose, ..herbal hop spiciness on the palate...all rounded out well. Very easy to drink and hard to complain about...good stuff..."
"HofBrauhaus Lager:  (half liter brown bottle, no freshness date, abv, unknown). Dense white head, with some stickiness.  Tan, absolutely clear beer.  Very powerful hops aroma that I could smell from almost two feet away.  Light refreshing beer with a bitter hop bite.  The only problem is that I‚Äôve had this in Munich, where it is fresh and a full point better."
"Lovely white head arose from my glass.  The bubbles were tightly packed and did not dissipate until the end.  Golden in color, this beer was much more then I had expected.  Light, but with an abundance of flavor.  Malt is noticable, but certianly not overpowering as this is a beer that invites you to drink it."
