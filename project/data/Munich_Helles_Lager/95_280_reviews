"Lowenbrau is an excellent beer it is perfect for any ocasion"

"What's is going on here???? How do people actually consider this a good beer? It is TERRIBLE. It's smells like a bundle of hay. They were pouring $5 schooies of this stuff last night and it's easily the worst beer I've ever had. Drink real beer like VB, export or New. Not this crap, I feel sorry for any tasteless person who considers this a good beer."
"A nicely priced iteration of the style."

"A clean, crisp, smooth and well balanced beer, Löwenbräu was really easy to enjoy. A good pure Deutsche lager. Refreshing."

"sweet and hoppy. The flavor is dry hoppy on a good malty background"

"Had a tall can of this well-known commercial example of a Munich helles lager in the classic blue and gold colors. This brew pours a lemon drop yellow with a massive amount of white head (unless you choose to mitigate this with your pouring technique, but this way you will get more of the aroma). Releases an aroma of pale green malt and bread yeast, smells sweet with a lot of fruity green grape character and a bit of a skunky sour tang. Palate is sweet white bread, bicarbonate of soda, apple, sour vines candy, grass, hay, and some white pepper spice. Maybe a subtle undercurrent of cherry pit which could very well be something I am inferring for an unknown reason. Fairly thin body and quite dry as per the style, but in all honesty I get a fair amount of sweetness here too that was detectable even by the non-beer geeks who accompanied me. Despite the massive billowing head, the beer was only moderately fizzy and perhaps I let much of the gas escape during the pour. Finishes fairly dry with a lingering green noble hop spicy bitterness that evokes melon rind. All in all, a pretty complex and tasty yet delicate brew that hits the right stylistic notes, even if it is a bit on the sweet side. I could detect no obvious flaws."

"Overall, not bad, but not particularly interesting either. Seems too thin and mild to hold up to food, and not enough flavor to be interesting by itself. Inoffensive, but is that something to be celebrated?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D - Well done but not awe inspiring. For the style it's pretty tasty and the price is right. Drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Solid beer all around and while not the gold standard of the style, certainly an affordable, accessible entry that is inoffensive as can be but is a huge improvement over the general swill."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, it's a pretty decent lager. The hoppiness is not as strong (or existent at all, for that matter) as I would have liked, but the beer looks great and has a fantastic, clean taste with fruity undertones. There is an off chance I'll but this again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an excellent beer for any lager or German beer fans. Highly recommended."

"Cheap, tasty lager. Nothing special, but when I'm hoping for a few cans of something I can enjoy without really worrying too much about it."
""
""
"Sure, this could qualify as a session beer, but I can't see anyone downing more than one or two in a sitting. While this wasn't a drain pour, it certainly wasn't anything worth remembering either. There could have been more of a bread/biscuit/potato chip starchy fullness to this to give the beer more body but alas, this was pretty watered-down and somewhat generic. While not as bad as other European beers in green bottles, not much stood out about this either. This is only worth giving it a go if you've never tried it, as previously was the case with yours truly."
""

"Not impressed with this beer. Smells like straight apple juice. Virtually no sweetness, though, and a sort of flat tasting bite. Thin bronze hue, slightly pleasant crisp mouthfeel, but not as crisp as my old standby, budweiser. Tastes pretty cheap, but I can sort of dig that kind of metallic flavor in that it personally brings back memories of getting drunk in college. Overall didn't like it, but it wasn't anything nasty, and beer is beer. Lowenbrau is ok."
"Not feeling this beer at all- I like my Helles(es)? To be super crisp, this lowenbrau fell flat for me . Not as clear as I like either - the appearance is like pale tinged yellow. Smell is a little off for me but its hard for me to pinpoint it exactly. Overall I would pass on this beer again, glad I tried it before getting the six pack"

"A good beer for its price, highly drinkable and pleasant."

"Löwenbräu Original is a satisfying beer that has a good balance of malty-ness and hoppy flavour. It is refreshing and a good representation of the style they are trying to convey. Above average Munich Helles Lager and a good german macro brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is a good representation of the style while also being very drinkable. I could see this as a good choice for someone who is first getting into beer and wanted to try a Munich Helles Lager for the first time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

""

"Meh - a pretty average lager. This is a shade above many macro products; at least the malt doesn't taste like it's been cut with adjuncts. However it lacks depth and hoppy notes, while the rather harsh finish makes for a sub-par experience. Quenches your thirst, but leaves you unsatisfied. No need to seek it out."

"Food match: Veal schnitzel with a side of bratkartoffeln mit senf and spargel."
""
""

"A good beer for the style. Enough flavor to bring me back to it once in awhile."
""
""
""
""
""

"a minor upgrade over the other lousy euro beers. pours golden and clear with a decent white foam head an inch or so high. smells like there might be a little hops in this one, behind the light pale malt aroma is a crisp bitterness that really stands out after drinking hopless stuff all summer. the flavor indicates that its no ipa or anything, but there is a slight hop presence in the finish that is a very welcomed feature. its crisp and clean in the finish, quite enjoyable. mouthfeel is consistent with the style, a little more body and a little less carbonation. overall a trusty go to brew in a market saturated with awful beer."

"is going to feel so so good, its so much like water."

"O- Decently refreshing, not interesting at all. Totally average, score fits perfectly"
""
"RJT"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: All in all, just a very simple and well done beer. This is what the generic lager should be instead of what big brewing has made it into. It could use more complexity, but I'm not that inclined to hold that against this beer too much."
""
""
"O - A great lager and example of the variety."
"Would drink it again in a pinch"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Overall, this beer seriously lacks in the flavor department and delivers a rather 'clean & crisp' lager feel, minus the adjuncts and skunk. A simple summer afternoon beer and nothing more."

"Third of a litre serving, in a Löwenbräu glass. Pale colour, two finger head, clear. Crisp noble hop aroma, almost a bit like a north german pils smell. Tasted a hint of orange, was malty with balanced sweetness and a slightly wheaty finish. Fair amount of gas. Easy drinker, thirst quencher. Good beer."
"Overall: Not a very good beer, just below par. They need to not use green bottles and need more flavor!"
"O: Decent beer, not a bad as some would like you to believe. Good for a few."
""
""
"O - A well balanced beer that lacks a little flavour depth but is crisp and refreshing and one that I actually enjoy on a hot day."
""
""
"Cheers LampertLand"
"Aroma is of pure golden barley, while the taste also has mild hop bittering elements in the finish. Certainly not ""dry & clean", but not an offensive lingering corn-sweetness."
""
"O: Good beer, it doesn't disappoint. It's ideal with this Steak-Umm sandwich. I wish I'd cooked another, but that would be gluttony; besides, now I can have another beer. Cheers for now."
""
""
""
""
"O: decent for the style, easy to drink. I would have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall; not really anything to go crazy over, just a solid, easy to drink beer that has it's time and place."
""
""

""
"Overall - Not a bad beer, as long as you don't mind the skunk."
""

"I brought a 500ml can of Lowenbrau Original home from a recent trip to Europe. The beer pours a clear pale golden hue, with one finger of foamy white head, which slightly laced on the glass. It smells of grain and saaz like hops. The taste is grain and malt with slight hops. The mouthfeeel was medium body with good carbonation. Overall this is a decent beer to session."

"T: With a bitter taste from beginning to end but the end is not very deep and ends semi dry."
"Unsophisticated and very drinkable Helles for an excellent price."
"O- Not bad at all but a bit lacking after the likes of Hofbrau and Weishtephaner. Nothing wrong at all with this brew and definitelty a lot better than the macros and easy to drink."
"Taste, more skunk, light body, fizzy, its all good, I knew what I was getting into. Wet hay properties. Lingering spritzy bitterness. Almost non existant hopping. Couldn't really tell the difference between this and the Canadian or US Lowenbrau. A decent choice on a hot day."
"The scent upon opening was skunky, (when will some brewers learn not to use clear or green glass for bottling!) Pours nice yellow medium head. Taste is neutral beery no bite kind of bleh. Will quench a thirst, but, so does water!"
"O- This is a fairly tasty, quite refreshing lager- no more, no less. Nice and light and very sessionable while not compensating much on taste is a fairly good combination in my opinion."
"O: Just a so so beer. Nothing really special here – I’ve had this beer a couple of times and every time it never really impresses me."
"Final Grade: 3.49, a B-."
"Overall: All-in-all a rather tasty lager considering its price - despite the dishrag. I find it better refrigerator cold as it preserves its ""crisp", and it does a nice job drenching my thirst on a warm summer's day."
"The beer poured out as a golden copper color, it had a thin fizzy white head. Not much lacing. The smell was a little on the lager skunk side. There was also some slight aromas of grass in there too. The taste was crisp and clean the grass was there but had some hops to balance it out. The mouthfeel wasn't too bad it had a good texture to it. Overall, I wasn't in love with the beer and it's one of my least favorite styles. I didn't mind this beer too much and would drink it again for sure."
"Dr: Average ABV, decent quality, and very drinkable. It shouldn't win any awards, but it's worth a try for any beer fanatic."
"O - My appreciation for this one isn't as high as it used to be. Pretty average stuff."
"An easy consumable lager, could have a more bitter bite to balance sweet and sour notes. A bit nostalgia, was more or less the first beer I choose to drink when I came to age ..."
"Overall, I wouldn't rave about this beer. It's good, but not enough character for my taste."
"O: Very impressive for a German beer."
"O- If this is not skunked, which is a big if, it's pretty enjoyable. Nothing spectacular. It's a simple and decent beer that is reasonably priced."
"O.K. Drinkability. This is a typical mass produced European light lager (Helles). While it isn't the best beer in that category it certainly isn't a bad beer."
"Cheers!"
"The mouth-feel is perhaps a bit light, but I have not had a beer in a long time so I don't really care. The carbonation is nice. The beer is a bit plain, but I don't really have any other options in Jordan. If I were back in Germany or the US I would get something different."
"Drinkability - perhaps the skunkiness was just due to the fact I bought this as a single out of the fridge at the liquor store. It is somewhat nice to drink. This was the first beer I had back when I was 16 years old and haven't had one since 1993 until I went back for a revisit. It actually is not a bad beer and some respectable flavorings. I'm glad I went back for a revisit."
"I still remember the common commercials for this when I was growing up. Ironically it seems hard to find now and I guess I was lucky to stumble upon some in an obscure little store. Poured a 3"" head which slowly dissipated to nothing. Clear straw yellow. Sweet corn with a slight zing, very much like American styles but with a longer finish. Basically American +1."
"Very yellow color with small carbonation. Virtually no head at all, just a thin lace. Normal grassy and herbal hop smell. Taste is just good, not too unique. Light bodied. Herbal hops and a little sweetness toward end. This beer is so ok, worth drinking. Not much wrong with it. Very drinkable."
"Overall this is a lighter tasting beer, but it is easily drinkable with a good balance of tastes. Worth a try, seems like a good summer beer."
"Great appearance and head with a not so great smell. At first its bitter and has some bite to it. I have noticed the colder it is the better. Surpassingly, even with the bitter initial taste it is a smooth beer and very drinkable. My friends and I can go through new case in one night."
"D: it's certainly not the worst macrobrew you could get, but why bother?"
"D- Get past the skunk and bitter lemon and you'll find bitter asprin chalky, nasties."
"Taste is pretty ok. nothing too bad about it but nothing really outstanding either. its pretty unoffensive and comes with a lot of grain taste to it. kind of like becks from the can. aftertaste is slightly dry/ bitter but it is nothing bad at all. overall a pretty drinkable beer and its nothing worth complaining of."
"From the 11.2 flo. oz. bottle no. L-24901-N. Sampled on November 5, 2010. When is the last time you had a Lowenbrau in the USA? If it has been awhile you might be in for a pleasant surprise. Instead of the tasteless corny beer of the 1980's and 1990's, it is now the original recipe imported from Germany. The pour is a carbonated yellow with about a half-inch of fizzy, longlasting head. For a green bottle the skunkiness is muted in favor of malts, thin yeast, and a slightly hopped background. The taste is tart but clean with barley malts and light hops to wrap around your throat. If you gave up on Lowenbrau years ago it might be worth another shot. Best beer around? Hardly. But drinkable and likeable."
"O: A simple, easy drinking and refreshig German Lager. One of the best Euro Lagers I've ever had"
"Not bad as far as a massed produced lager goes. Not outstanding though."
"Drinkability - I could drink a few of these beers, however, would not be a preference."
"D- Good beer, but on the light side. Doesn't pack much punch, but isn't too disappointing."
"Crystal clear and yellow with a fizzy, bright white cap that quickly fell. Slightly sour aroma, floral and grassy with a bit of malt. Light bitterness, sweet malts, lingering spicy and grassy notes in the flavour. Clean profile. Light bodied with above average carbonation. Not bad, but sort of uninspired. The aroma rubbed me the wrong way but it wasn't really bad. My suggestion is to grab some Skittles and make yourself some Skittlebrau."
"Drink - a nice lighter tasting mildly hoppy beer. Perfect for a hot summer day. I could easily drink a few of these."
"D - this beer is made for chugging, the tastes are subtle but fair, but the combo of thin, crisp, and refreshing make you forget where the last one went"
"Finishes very crisp and dry, but the mustiness threw me off a bit. Its not offensive though, and not a bad choice for the style."
"I wish our big name beers were as easy to swallow as this perhaps I'll keep dreaming"
"D - only restricted by price and availability, equally good, cheaper helles available in australia."
"Poured in a pilsener Bayern glass, seems like apple soda, bright golden color, no foam, lots of bubbles. Smell: Sweet grain and herbal hops. Taste: The same, sweet grain and herbal hops, but here the hops dominates most of the time. Mouthfeel: Crisp, sweet bitterness with dry finish, high carbonation and soft body. Drinkability: Easy to drink, have almost all the characteristics of a good beer, except the look."
"The entire character of the beer upped and left. I'm not sure if it was due to it being old or spoiled. But I don't care because, either way, I don't feel like it's worth going back to. There's plenty of other better German bottled beers out in Beerland."
"A decent enough Helles, and while the Euro-feel is strong in this one, I'm not grokking a lot of 'originality' here. Drinkable in quantity, I'm sure, but not as a singular pleasure."
"not a bad helles, but I think I'd rather go for a Weihenstephan or something"
"Drinkability: Pleasantly surprising, this one. Quite refreshing and nothing but ease to drink down."
"I remember enjoying this beer years ago, but that was in comparison to Molson Canadian and Budweiser. Lowenbrau really isn't too good a brau. I'd like to think ""lowen"" in German means ""average", but I'm sure that's not the case. I guess I'd order it if it was the best option but I'm not sure I'd want to be drinking somewhere where this was the best option..."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, spritzy, and grainy."
"If I ever return to Munich, I will look it up. Until then,goodbye Lowenbrau. Sure goona miss ya."
"Pours a crystal clear light yellow color with less than a finger of white foam for a head. Head receeds fairly quickly leaving a thin film of lace along the glassware. Aroma has a slight distinct green bottle beer smell which is minorly skunky but also has a bit of sweetness minorly reminescent of corn rather than grain. Once a little warmer than ideal, it has a very minor hop presence in the backend of the nose. Taste is light and refreshing and includes flavors of grain, biscuit, slightly skunky and minorly buttery notes. There is a lingering sweetness of grain left in the mouth. Modest amount of carbonated leaves the beer feeling quite light and quite drinkable."
"Taste and body are light, pale malt is present but that's about it. Lackluster but not offensive."
"D: This is a nice light lager that goes down easy. I could easy drink a six pack of these on a hot day."
"D - Smooth and easy going down. Could be good with a lot of food as it won't dominate any flavors. It's kind of a tofu of beers. Switzerland. Neutral ground."
"D- Very drinkable, good for a warm spring day."
"I drank this a lot 30 years ago and I used to enjoy it then. It was the exotic import. Now I don't believe I would look for it again."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle with no freshness bottle. Little or not head after pour into a pint glass. Smells like cooked cabbage and boiled meats. Taste is like cooked cabbage and herbs. Maybe some rosemary and tea leaves. No real head or carbonation. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth. Not bad jus not something I would reach for again."
"Easy to drink and pretty refreshing."
"Good beer. Easy drinking and a worthwhile beer."
"Overall, a pretty decent lager. Nothing really stands out, but nothing is offense. If you see it, give it a try."
"I could drink these all day. One of my favorite session beers (although I have a lot of session beers)."
"I would drink this again. It is a pleasant beer."
"Given the ABV this could be a ncie all-nighter. Very drinkable, but I don't see it taking the place of any of my mainstays right now. Not bad at all."
"Lowenbrau Original pours a clear light gold with a thin head that only lingers with the lively carbonation. The aroma is mild and grainy, maybe some bitterness and/or astringency. The flavor is crisp just enough bitterness and hop flavor to meld nicely with the slight light malty sweetness. There is a bit of that astringency, and the finish is dry with a bit of graininess. The bit of flavor sets this one apart from the domestic equivalent, but not quite enough to really stand out."
"This beer comes from the same city that made me fall in love with beer in the first place, it will always have a special place in my heart."
"It's a nice, simple, easy drinking light tasting beer and, at $2.15 for a 500ml can, I might just have to pick some up next summer if I need a refreshing session beer."
"Overall, yeah, its one of those."
"D: Fair enough, but I don't think I'll be buying it again, I'd be wary of the green bottle."
"Poured from a green 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Has a mild, somewhat skunky aroma. Taste is rather bland, slightly bitter. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a very ordinary beer, nothing special here."
"D: I can drink a lot of this. This is one of the more flavorful lagers I've had. Do yourself a favor and pour this in a glass, it makes that initial ""skunk"" disappear."
"Pours a light, pale golden. Moderate head, that quickly dissipates. Smells of a very subdued hops presence, with some hints of citrus. Taste is also subdued. There are some hops detectable on the back of the palate, as well as some residual tartness. Mothfeel is a bit on the thin side. Decent drinkability, especially it seems in warm weather. This is a slightly above average brew, with no really outstanding traits one way or the other."
"d- i guess it's drinkable, the munich helles isn't my favorite style but i've had better than this, it is refreshing though, and aside from the slightly skunky taste it goes down easy."
"This was definitely a good beer. Had a slightly better flavor than other beers of the same style, though not quite as drinkable in my opinion. This brew has a good overall balance to it. Nice sweet malt flavor up front and enough hops to finish it off."
"It's not a bad one to try."
"Drinkability - very nice and refreshing, but not hugely notable for me."
"Yellow colored beer with a rapidly fading fluffy head.Aroma is malty.Taste also is malty with some bread and hops.Overall a refreshing beer with no offensive flavors.Smooth drinking that goes down dangerously good.I would purchase again and recommend it!"
"Pours a lovely pale gold color with a good two inch head that fades slowly, leaving a fair amount of lacing. Main aromas are light sweet malt, bready/grassy aromas, and just enough nobel hops to keep the sweetness in check. Flavor profile resembles the aroma characteristics. Nothing earth shattering here, but all in all this is a well balanced Helles with a light crisp mouthfeel and above average drinkability. If it's hot as hell and there's nothing but Macros available; grab a Lowenbrau or two. Prost!"
"pours a light golden color with a nice white head, smell is pretty good, has a nice malt sweetness to it and a decent hop aroma as well. taste is average, doesn't have anything extraordinary to it but it is a solid munich helles, which is quickly becoming one of my favorite summer beers, lowenbrau, spaten, hofbrau are all becoming some of my go to summer beers. mouthfeel and drinkability are pretty good too"
"Finishes very crisp and dry, but the mustiness threw me off a bit. Its not offensive though, and not a bad choice for the style."
"After declining to review a bottle of this that was skunked as hell I managed to get my hands on a fresher one. The beer poured a light gold with a two-finger head. The smell was mostly sweet malt with just a bit of grassy hops. The taste starts off with some sweet malt that is quickly cut by the grassy hops that makes for a nice balance. The mouthfeel was a bit watery but with enough carbonation to make it crisp. A pretty drinkable little beer that's a good six-pack to grab if you happen to be going somewhere a bit more upscale than Macrobrew territory."
"Pours to a thick white head that falls to a thin layer and makes moderate lacing. Clear, pale yellow color. Aroma is sweet and has a bit of spicy noble hops in it. Flavor is rather bland (maybe this one is old?) with a faint graininess and weak hop bitterness. Thin and watery and not very inviting as a session beer."
"Still, this beer is more than on par for refreshment, and makes for a decent semisessionable beer."
"D- Very drinkable. A decent lager, overall. There's nothing off-putting in the taste and nothing extraordinary either."
"D- Extremely high. A good beer that you can drink a lot of and still feel pretty good. The 1L of Lowenbrau is a pleasant buzz. This beer is nice, drinkable, and good with some pretzels. Nothing special, but every once and a while I'll get a sixer and don't regret it."
"Why would a talented brewery with a clear sense of place and tradition compromise their reputation (and their flagship beer) by exporting such a diminished, inferior imitation? Unlike most canned, mass-produced lagers, Lowenbrau is drinkable but it would take the right conditions for it to be honestly enjoyable. Anyone craving an authentic tasting Munich Helles might as well invest in a homebrewing kit or a plane ticket."
"D - Light and easy drinking. Not too much more than a light lawnmower lager in my opinion."
"D: Quite drinkable but not my favorite German lager."
"Final Thoughts - If you are a fan of Stella Artois, consider giving this one a try. Decent lager with a similar flavor and feel."
"[Drinkability]: Pretty good session beer. Very drinkable. I would buy this beer again."
"Drinkabililty : an average beer in the style Munich Helles lager."
"The legendary Lowenbrau name was tarnished a bit in the 70's as corporate American brewers changed the 'recipe' for American tastes. This, however, is the real thing. This lager pours crystal-clear and foamy, and the taste has a subtly sour finish. A typically Munich-style lager, this one's not at all bad, but nor is it outstanding."
"Drinkability: This feels like a beer that could be drank after mowing the lawn, as a substitute for a bud. Its thin and easy to go down, not off putting or chewy. However, in my opinion, I feel that a beer should offer more than to quench thirst."
"Put this beer side-by-side with an American light adjunct lager, and you'll see how 6-row barley, adjuncts, and accountants designing recipes coarsened an otherwise fine product."
"Drinkability: Cheap and a decent representation of a heller. The slickness makes it harder to classify this as a session beer and the Lack of flavor makes it a very uninteresting one."
"D: Too much like the typical macro lager. Easily drinkable, but nothing memorable to discern it from the others."
"Nice and malty, pretty sweet and grassy, kind of citrusy as well. This is a very refreshing beer and proabably one of my favourite european lagers."
"D: Well this beer and style is built for drinkability and I think it pulls it off. Its not anywhere near heavy and it sits fine and easy. It is a bit dry but that just aids in the drinking of more of the beer. The flavors and aromas are light but I rarely expect crazy complexity from my Helles Lagers. They are meant to be simple, easy drinkers and this is a pretty good example of such a lager. Have and will continue to drink this beer."
"A really great German Lager. An easy to drink beer with some depth and flavor even though it is mass produced and shipped everywhere. Keep this in the fridge and serve very cold. I like to drink this when I am looking for a lighter beer to have with dinner. Works great with most foods and is easy to find at any store. Keep in mind that this beer is 5.2%, much better than the 4.somethings that we get in the US for mass produced beer."
"Pours a clear golden yellow with a white head with pretty good retention. Lazy bubbles slowly coasting their way up from the bottom. Smells skunky, with grainy, honeylike malts. If there are any hop aromas here, I'm just not smelling them. Taste is good, pretty straightforward sweet malts with zesty lemon hops. Finish is not quite crisp and lingers a bit sweet. Overall, this is a solid beer. There are definitely better ones but there are far more worse ones."
"From old notes: Pours a yellow gold with short lived white head. Smell: grassy, grainy, that's about it. Taste: balanced is the theme here, sweet malts with a crisp spicy hop bitterness. Mouthfeel: fairly light, smooth, finishes clean. Not amazing, but very refreshing."
"D: I could very easily drink a lot of this. This is one of the more flavorful lagers I've had. I will definitely be buying this again."
"Mouthfeel is pretty spot on. Just like I had at Bier Gardens in Germany. Could even be a little lighter at warmer temps just to really make it that much more drinkable."
"Overall an above average, but not particularly great beer."
""
"Feels very watery, but i guess it works for the clean refreshing nature of the beer. Quite drinkable."
"Overall - A very good pilsener for one sold at Wegmans. Good price, decent flavor, great sessioning. Will buy again if I want something light, cheap and tasty."
"You could do worse. And there's that neat umulat in the name. So there."
"A ok beer if it was the only thing avabile other than the US macro lager I would drink this."
"If you are looking for a lighter Helles Lager, than you can't go wrong with an original recipe Lowenbrau. I do remember the bad old days when Lowenbrau was just macro crap, being made by some large brewhouse in the US under contract. The brand has been revived. The beer pours a fairly straw pale color with a white, thin head. Just a tad bit of lacing, not much though. This is a fairly crisp beer with a slightly lemony, slightly vinous quality. There is a bit of graininess to the beer, and it has all the characteristics of the style. It is a little bit more substantial than most macro/adjunct lagers, and it does have a nicer spiciness to it, and less blandness than its close relatives. The nose has that wonderful hay like grassiness. This is a light bodied, lightish Helles Lager, and will satisfy those seeking out a representative beer of the style."
"An OK lager, not offensive, but pretty insipid."
"It's definitely no Augustiner or Hofbrau, but it's still pretty good for what it is. A dash more hops and color are really all it needs. If you're wanting a sweeter helles, this it probably the leader. Because it's a pretty subtle style, details matter. Take my score as a comparison to other helles beers moreso than a statement. It's good and it's stylistically solid, but you just can't have much room for error when compared to the other helles beers in Munich. I'd say this is the ""worst"" of the bunch, but it's still pretty solid."
"This is a delicate beer that borders on the uninspired. Still worth getting from time to time, its light taste and clean palate is a nice change from many bigger beers and styles."
"Drinkability - I wouldn't sit down and pound back too many of these in a row... a good tasting beer but not a one after another after another after another beer for me."
"Imagine my surpise to see this still on a menu somehwere. Had a bottle at Marino's Italian in Pacific Beach. Not bad. Sweet, hoppy flavor with a light mouthfeel. Probably doesn't travel well, given the slight skunkiness. Good enough that I had several."
"Poured gold/yellow from a 12 oz. bottle with a quarter- to half-inch of white, dishwater head--about what I expected from the style. Smell is a little weak, though there is some floral and a bit of citrus. Taste is enjoyable and somewhat sweet and includes lemon and a little pepper. The light flavors and body finish nicely, and if I didn't prefer a little more variety, I could probably drink a few of these in a sitting."
"Taste is light with a mild lemon taste on top of a lager malty taste. A great drinkability, with a bitterness that is lower than the average German pilsner."
"Pale straw colour with thin head that dissipated quickly. Very little aroma apart from a slight maltiness but then I seem to be challenged in the olfactory department. Flavour is malty with a slight grassiness and a bit doughy as well. Not overpowering but well balanced and very drinkable with a long bitter finish. A good thirst quenching beer for everyday use. There's a lot more interesting examples out there I'm sure but this is readily available and inexpensive."
"Overall, this would be a good beer for a hot day. Not a beer with a lot of complexity in any aspect, but definitely refreshing."
"D: One of the better mainstream German beers. A cut above Beck's and St. Pauli Girl."
"D - Blah. This isn't terrible, but it is very uninteresting. A below average beer for the style. I'll pass next time."
"One of my favorite mass produced euro-lagers. Basic beer that always seems to hit the spot. Aroma is slightly grassy but never skunky. Nice light golden pour, good white head, moderate lacing. Mouthfeel is fresh and crisp. Good malt backed flavor, touch of hops."
"D: I'm actually surprised this beer has an overall B- grade. This is just like most macrobrews - no character or taste. Pass."
"Good, solid beer. I was expecting it to be a bit thicker, but it turned out to be just fine. This is a beer I will probably look to at some point in the future."
"O- Very drinkable. Definitely a candidate for my refreshment beer on a hot summer day."
"D: A nice, drinkable beer that was pretty good. I could see this as a solid beer to have during the hot, summer months. A pretty good beer overall."
"Lowenbrau Original pours a pale yellow color with a white head from a green 11.2 ounce bottle. The aroma is grainy. The flavor is very mild, grainy at first, a bit malty and then some mild skunky type hops. Underwhelming, but not much different than any other macro lager. The last time I had a Lowenbrau it was a contract brew from Miller. This isn't really any better. I used to prefer the Swiss version, but I haven't seen one in years."
"Overall, a really decent lager that should be quite sessionable."
"Drinkability: This is a great all around beer."
"Poured from green 12 oz bottle a clear yellow color with a half inch of white head with steady bubble rise that reduced to a solid layer of foam and spotty lacing. Smells fresh and grassy with hints of malt. Tastes crisp and has nice balance of malt sweetness and a little spice. Light bodied and smooth drinking. I like this one, it is simply solid. Tonight is kinda special...let it be Lowenbrau."
"D: Safe, unoffending lawnmower beer but still much better then any American macro counterpart."
"If anything would have like a little more malty notes...but if I am panging for a lively beer without too much sweetness (for a thirst quencher) than this is a good choice."
"seems like it should be crisper. drank this thinking it was a pils. certainly tastes more like a weak pils than a helles. balance is way off for a helles. way too similar to warsteiner."
"D - A decently drinkable brew, if forgettable. I was really in the mood for something light when I bought these, and those other five went down quite easy. Helles lagers are what they are; perhaps if I'd had more this would score higher."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a medium yellow/golden color with a small fizzy white head. Grassy, yeasty, and a bit skunk smelling (probably a bad bottle). Flavor was mildly bitter, more malty grains. Light bodied, decent carbonation, fairly smooth. Decent beer."
"There's nothing to really get excited about here. It is drinkable however. Light-bodied and very light golden colored. Grassy malts, crisp, and a little bit of bitterness. Somewhat refreshing. There's not a lot to it but there's nothing foul about it and you could to a lot worse while mowing the lawn or sitting in the sun."
"Dark straw color. Lots of dense foam & lacing. Moderate carbonation, appropriate for style. Floral smell, with a whiff of hops. Some sulfur/skunk. Flavor is a nice balance of acidity from the carbonation, a slight bitter zing from the hops with lots of light grassy malt and light floral notes. Very, very dry which makes it crisp, refreshing and highly drinkeable. Definitely above average, though not exceptional."
"D Good, but others are better examples of both the helles and lager classes."
"Overall I really enjoyed this and could see myself knocking back a few on such a warm day as this. The price is very reasonable for an import and is makes this a high quality alternative when you just want a simple, easy lager but want better quality than BMC. I'll likely be working this in to the rotation in the future. Now if only the bottles weren't green..."
"A great lighter lager to drink on a hot summer day with light highlighting the rising bubbles. But a bit weak on the finish. Overall, it is easy to down two or three of these in succession on a lazy evening."
"I believe this used to be one of the better selling imports in the US not very long ago. With a number of better German lagers on the market today, Löwenbräu's hay-day in the US is long gone. It's a good plain Munich lager, if that isn't an oxymoron."
"I love it! My new favorite German lager, move over Beck's!"
"a great german lager. way better than the self proclaimed king of beers which is also a lager. this beer has a great taste, pleasing to the palette lol. i can down a six pack of this no problem. its not terribly strong either so it doesn't intrude. good with a nice steak"
"11.2oz green bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a.pale golden yellow color with a decent white head. The aroma is slightly skunked with some grainy malt and grassy hops. The taste is some malt up front with a dry finish that provides a quick bite from the hops. There are definitely some off-flavors in the taste that hurt the drinkability for me. The mouthfeel is thin bodied and fizzy from the high amount of carbonation. Overall, this is not a horrible beer by any means but I am not a huge fan of this beer."
"If I ever come by it again I'll try it just in case the one I had was skunked. Until I do though, my advice is to stay away."
"Won't blow you away, but won't turn you off either. Plain Jane across the board - clear straw colour, pretty much headless, mild aroma and middle of the road taste profile - but competently made. This is one you can safely offer your non-beer informed friends, and it stands up fairly well once the cold is off it."
"Light head and lacing. Clear, golden body. The flavor is both very enjoyable and very complex; faintly sweet for one moment, then with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Fairly high carbonation, with a tingly mouthfeel. Not my favorite German lager, but still quite good overall."
"A light gold body with some light carbonation and minimal lacing. A faint grassy hop smell and slight husk. A dry, sharp hop bite on the tip of the tongue that leads to a lightly rough going over the tongue, leaving my mouth a little dried out. Not much in hop flavoring or malts to speak of in the taste. Not too bad, and not that good either."
"Update: 2007-06-22: The label notes ""Imported from Munich, Germany""."
"First sip is pretty good....very minimal hop character but it blends nice with the grains. Little bubbles bounce of your tongue as you let this brew sit in your mouth. Very light and is a good session beer. I'd buy this again."
"D: Pretty easy to drink, although it's not really something I would drink regularly, I wouldn't mind having a few."
"Damn, this is a good little lager here!!! Its clean and crisp with a sharp hoppy finish that complements the malt up front very well... Enjoyed several of these while eating some brats off of the grill and enjoyed the hell out of them..."
"Appearance remenicent of golden fields of grain. Smell crisp malt clean with a hint of nobel hop. Taste sweet grainy maltiness with just enough hop to balance. Mouthfeel Mediem body mediem carbonation. Drinkability an everyday beer that combines a respectible amount of flavor with great drinkability."
"Overall, a fairly nice lager with a very decent price tag. Enjoyable in the summer, after a day of work and just before supper."
"MF&D - Crisp, light and refreshing. The combination of good carbonation and thin body make this an easy beer to session. Well worth the $5.99 I paid for the 6pk."
"D - This is an okay import. Nice on a warm spring day."
"if you can get this fresh, or somehow guarantee that it hasn't been left out in the light, go for it. out here in china, with the premium price you pay, it's usually not worth the gamble however."
"Trying to account for this beer being quite possibly not at its best, this is still a fairly average German lager. Better than Becks, but falls short of anything German starting with a W. I'd gladly drink one if offered, but this is not memorable enough to go back to. Decent value at $3.60 a bottle."
"IMO this has a little more hop pressence than a typical helles. Even though it may lean a little more toward a german pils, its still an enjoyable refreshing brew."
"D: The overall profile was pleasing and refreshing. It was surprisingly, especially considering its uninspiring appearance and smell. Not a bad complement to a spicy pizza or Mexican dinner."
"Alas I cannot find it near me anymore."
"Definitively a Helles, props to Lowenbrau for not succumbing to EPLness. Too bad they can't put it in a real bottle though... honestly."
"Wow, ok, maybe this was skunked, but it was horrible. Smelled pretty bad and tasted worse. I would rate this amongst the worst beers I have ever tried. My apologies for not having more to say, but I didn't finish this beer, just 2 swallows. I promise, I will try another one, in case this one was in fact skunked."
"Drinks easy, good beer to have few of when playing hold `em with your friends."
"I honestly think this is my first Löwenbrä ... A good friend of mine who grew up in the Midwest says this was her ""high school"" beer... and honestly.. it's better than my memories of brews in 9-12."
"This is a really decent session beer. I enjoyed this a bunch!"
"D--I half expected this to suck. Actually, I was pleasantly suprised to taste that it didn't. I could see myself drinking this again despite the extensive must do list."
"When I put my nose to the green bottle I didn't smell the skunk that I thought I might. So that was nice... Fresh batch. Appearance is moderate gold typical of the German lagers. Nice white head. Smells sweet-malty and kind of hoppy. As the aroma indicates, there's a nice rich malt flavor that provides some sweet flavor. And the hops provide a nice punch of bitterness. Nice consistancy. Not too thin or thick. Pretty drinkable but now I'm tasting a little bit of a bitter aftertaste. Decent Munich Lager. I'll bet it's better in a giant mug served by muscle-armed German broad at Oktoberfest."
"Not a bad beer in my opinion. Not the best Helles I've ever had, but I find it smooth and easy to drink."
"D- I can drink a few of things and get a good buzz off of them."
"Certainly not a good ""first try."" I can imagine an unskunked Löwenbräu Original being quite nice, but with the price and the bottle color, it's just not worth the risk of skunked shit. I haven't had too many foreign beers out of green bottles, but I'm already considering giving up on them. I think this was a waste of $6.49, and I will not buy it again unless I see it in better-protected containers (cans or fully-boxed bottles to block the light)."
"poured into a pint glass from 12oz bottle, pours a pale straw yellow color with a very small white head. smell is bland not a lot there just a little malt and grain. taste is light and crisp not a lot of flavor but very smooth and easy to drink. this beer is drinkable and would make a pretty good session beer."
"I guess I'll just have to take Dad's word for how good it was back in the day."
"This beer is really nothing to go out of your way for, but its not bad because you can get it in a 12 pack. very few beers are available in 12pks, but this is not a bad choice if you are picking from corona, bud, coors, heineken etc. The smell of it reminds you of the typical Dutch/German macro-brew. They probally look at this similar to the way Americans look at coors/bud. Overall i would drink this again, but it is not super. It golden with just a little bit of head. Decent pop to it, and minimal aftertaste."
"Lite bodied, this is a solid drinking helles brew, with a bit of a bark as it weighs in at 5.2% - except there are a couple Id pick up before this one (Bitburger)"
"D: This beer is certainly easy to drink and, it's not that it doesn't taste very well, the flavours are there but they don't stick around long enough in my opinion."
"all. And that version wasn't even made in Germany."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Light and fizzy on the palate, with a slightly dry finish that leaves the mouth watering. The brew is easy to drink, it makes a great ""anytime"" beer, and as I already mentioned it would be a great crossover brew. This isn't a brew I'd seek out, but I would consider buying it again because it is a brew that will appeal to the BMC drinker, if you're trying to convert then this is one possible route."
"Pours a medium amber colour. Has a creamy head but dissipates quickly. Initial taste is sharp with a bitter aftertaste. Is mildly pungent in odour. Bought this beer on a whim as it was on sale. Now I know why. Is drinkable but I wouldn't race out to buy it again."
"Pretty drinkable though."
"This is an extremely drinkable beer. A great compliment to lunch/dinner and fun (and easy on the stomach) to drink more than six of. Good for the drinker who values plainness, stability, and affordability. Note: it's also a good morning beer."
"This would best be enjoyed very, very cold, appropriate for a frozen mug. * I would not want to get drunk with this version of Lowenbrau. * That's not to say I'd pass up a chance to be in Munchen drinking it out of kegs again!"
"Overall it is a good, refreshing and well-balanced beer. Not top of the notch but quite enjoyable."
"Not much to say about this one other than its kind of bland. First one of these Ive had in probably a decade or more. It seems like I remember it being better than this. Not much better than an American macro-brew. Neither aroma nor taste is anything spectacular. Mouthfeel is basic pale lager territory. OK."
"Poured straw to golden with a good smattering of fluffy, cloud-like head that hung around for quite some time. Smell was not much to speak of, light malt and grain, maybe a spice of hops. Taste was okay, just smooth and agreeable, more on the sweeter side. A noticeable hop presence. Perfect antidote for a really hot day. Enjoyable, but for those seeking more flavor or pizzazz, you might look elsewhere."
"The wheaty taste does a decent job of counteracting the customary German/Bavarian bitterness. You could do a lot worse."
"One of my favourite beer. This beer pours a nice translucent golden colour with a bubbly white head that dissipates slowly. The aroma is flavourful with a floral tinge to it . The flavour has grassy and malty tones, and more importantly, has some bite to it which is something I like in a beer. This is a beer I would definitely recommend to friends"
"light, clean. very drinkable. Well carbonated, really is the only thing assisting the lighter flavor profile to be exposed to the palette."
"It really feels nice,this beer was very , this is not the first time i drink this beer , but the over time a did'nt pay attention to the beer,just drink it.I would buy this beer more often."
"pours a clear golden straw color with a white frothy two finger head that fades quicky to just cover the beer and a fair amount of lacing. grassy, herbal earthy smell. grainy malt taste with a herbal hop slightly bitter finish. mouthfeel light, grainy, crisp, good carbonation. try lowenbrau and steamed clams, it's the best."
"Drinkability - unpleasant, rough to drink with a straight face"
"Rather enjoyable lager. Easy to drink and there's not really any negatives. Worth having again (and I have...)."
"Good balanced beer, ideal for a hot summers day, not the best pilsner/helles/lager on earth, but certainly not the worst either. All in all a pleasant drink."
"I have a friend that went to Germany, and came back swearing by this beer. I don't know if its his favorite but i searched it out to try. Its not my favorite but is a good session beer. Its clean tasting and smooth/easy to drink. This beer is alot better than the macro lagers, definatly worth a try."
"pours golden yellow with a white head that tapers off into lacing. Smell is of hops and grain. Flavor is not bad but kind of bland and boring. Hops and malt can be tasted but nothing exciting or delicious. Given that its average on everything else it has average drinkibility. Its not hard to drink but if I would opt for many other beers over this one."
"Final Statement: Not bad at all. I really don't like lagers, but this isn't too bad. It's one of the cheapest imports which makes it all the more pleasing. Suitable for summer days and refreshment. Definately worth a shot if you like the style."
"solid beer.... pours a light golden color with a wispy 1/2"" head. Sweet Malt on the nose along with a little alcohol.Some lacing. pretty nice balance here...pleasant sticky mouthfeel goes nice with those tongue tingeling grassy hops...lots of hops for a light colored lager....and that 'REAL BEER' taste that seems to slowly be dissapearing on today's market. Becomes even more flavorful at about 45degrees..all kinds of interesting stuff happening at slightly warmer temps instead of going terrible like American Lagers... .very grassy finish with that great familiar bitter, Euro Pale kick. The faintest citrus..say ...aaaa..lemon-juice/lemon-ade.. I wish this was easier to find again. An extremely solid and flavorful lager with the stuff that you should taste instead of what you shouldn't. A good sessionable brew. I want 10 more! Lipsmakin goodness....and priced rt for the quality...7.99/six....at that price it dominates the market for quality and taste. If your a hellas or a light bodied lager that maintains a good mouthfeel fan...then Lowenbrau is for you. The fruit of Edelhell...the euro skunk of Heiny...and the good sticky qualities of Dortmunder GOld...this brew is nice for the price. I'm pretty sure all of it is imported now. Harder to find than it was 15 years ago... ...a personal favorite because of high score on mouthfeel and grassy hops for an easy drinking light-colored lager. Nice bottle too. I can't beleive some here have said it's equal or just above massprolag's....not true...it's an obvious cut above. Everyone should remember this is a German Brewed, whole hopped, hellas lager that gives you a beautiful grassy hop bitter, peppery bite....to the untrained palate this could come off as skunky ...I realize the green bottles skunk easier which brings me to ask...where are some of the reveiwers here buying their beer and do they drink anything other than Bud and Miller...because Lowenbrau is A STAPLE...no other accessible lager gives this blance of Hops, Mouthfeel, Bite, and sessionablity... Mom, this is what I want for Christmas...:)"
"Poured into an American pint glass from a 12 oz bottle. The beer is crystal clear and pale yellow. Slightly skunky hops are present with hints of citrus. The head was originally about 1/2"" with a hard pour and quickly boiled down to a mere covering of thin foam. Moderate carbonation. The taste is of hops, citrus, a decent amount of maltiness, and a creamy finish. The body is slightly thick, but leaves a residual oiliness in the mouth."
"Poured a nice rich head, smell was a hoppy whiff, taste was very enjoyable, nice hop/ malt balance, great drinkability on this one..good example of Munich style, well crafted can't miss with this one..recommended. This used to be brewed in the U>S, and was inferior to the ""new"" brew back in Germany where it belongs, Thank God for the meister braus!"
"As a common Euro lager, is very refreshing for those hot days."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Reminds me of a cross between Warsteiner and Heineken. Some elements of a euro lager and some elements of a german pilsner. This isn't my favourite, but it isn't bad either. Wasn't a favourite of most people at the dinner."
"¡Salud!"
"Drinkability-- if I hadn't been tempted by a few other beers to try at the time, this would have served well for allnight drinking-- nothing overly ""whooa yeah"" and yet very consistently delivering."
"Served in a pilsner glass, the beer pours a golden color with about an inch white head with good lacing. It smells like grain, grassy hops, malt and a bit of lemon. It tastes the same way, but it starts off with malty sweetness and finishes with a hop bitterness, although the aftertaste doesn't linger for too long. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing. The drinkability is good too, it goes down easy. Overall I think it's a decent beer. Not great, but good enough to drink here and there."
"D: Smooth, thats what makes it so popular. You can drink it like water. Just because its an import doesn't make it better."
"NOthing special, a regular GErman beer, better than most macros but with that honey alike smell, maybe the hops they use in Bavaria. Teh head is quite impressive, but the taste is a little incipit. The colour is somewhat greenish in some features but in general Golden."
"Seems a bit overcarbonated, but a decent drinkable lager, better than a lot of European lagers on the market."
"Lowenbrau Original was golden in color with a thick white head. The head had good retention and left some lacing behind. The aroma was lightly malty. The taste was a little sweet upfront, with good mix of malt and hop flavors, and had a fairly dry finish. The body was light to medium with medium carbonation. It's a decent lager and I'm glad to see that it is once again brewed in Germany rather than being contracted out to the US."
"Compared to other European lagers I have tasted recently, this is above average."
"D- Easy to drink overall Its pretty good and better then I expected."
" This is simply not very good. Very slightly darker than an American macro it is otherwise almost indistinguishable-- foamy head, lots of bubbles. The smell is more potent than a macro but not particularly appealing -- straw, very slight hops. Taste is most readily compared to a non-skunky Heineken . Despite a light body it isn't particularly easy on the palate or stomach."
"Dull yellow appearance almost no head, small bubbles across the top of beer nose is crisp with indication skunk and hops Light body  bright, smooth and refreshing taste - aftertaste is medium with a slight skunk quality Dull yellow appearance almost no head, small bubbles across the top of beer nose is crisp with indication skunk and hops Light body  bright, smooth and refreshing taste - aftertaste is medium with a slight skunk quality"
"M- balanced mouthfeel, with lots of carbination very nice"
"the after taste i can say lives you with the feeling for more, like a dry mouth."
"This beer reminds me a of a clean lager and crisp Pils.For the style, I think this beer is really on point. I must have a fresh sample because this beer is much better than I remember it in the past."
"Drinkability is good, Nothing of note to mark it down. But it does not wow you. MK"
"Pours out to a straw yellow color with a smaller head of white foam that dissipated quickly. Medium to medium low level of carbonation. Aromas were light, with traces of grassy grains and yeasty bread being noted. Taste was fair for the style; medium light malts, some floral hops, the typical German buttery note that is consistant with the style. Mouthfeel is fair, but rather uneventful. Drinkability is north of average. A good Helles Lager. Worth trying."
"Overall: Good balance and cleanness make it quite drinkable."
" it makes me happy that this (as of this review) is sitting at a solid 80. worth a try."
"Drinkability - excellente, very nice to drink on hot days."
"Tonight after work I just felt like a refreshing German lager, and so I picked up a six of the Lowenbrau, a beer I have not had in a very long time. I have always liked the classic light blue packaging, and the bottles are attractive enough, green with the blue and gold labelling. This is a respectable Munich brewer, after all, albeit one of the biggest and most commercial. The lion cap pops off and the beer pours a lightish honey hue with a snow-white cap of fine head that is extremely tight. The head has exceptional longevity, remaining full and creamy for the entire time I drank it. Very good rings of lacing too. As far as a good helles lager goes, this looks mighty tasty. Very grassy hops on the nose immediately, almost sourish. Dusty, with good malt backbone though, adding bready caramel notes. Maybe a little vanilla wafer, sourdough bread, and faint nuttiness. Not a lot going on, but nice balance. The taste is a little more malty than the aroma suggests. Sweet caramel malting, but with some nice pils-style hopping to add a little spice. Definetely not as sweet as some other Munich helles lagers. Like the aroma, the taste is just simply quenching and unoffensive. Lots of good biscuity malt with the hops a little dryness to the aftertaste. This went well with regular tortilla chips and Swiss cheese. The mouthfeel is fairly low in carbonation and easily drinkable. An amiable summer German quencher. Not overly exciting, but nothing I can pick holes in for its style. Solid."
"If it weren't for the skunk, it probably would not be so bad. There is still a nice malty sweetness and an overall refreshing feel to it. Unfortunately, it is not that drinkable because of the ever-lasting skunk background."
"You should too."
"I remember the U.S. version of Lowenbrau, but I don't remember which one of the Big Three brewed it (note: it was contract brewed by Miller). Therefore, it was with some interest that I popped the cap on Lowenbrau Original. That interest was short-lived once I ran it through its paces. There's really nothing here to get excited about, nostalgia or no nostalgia."
"The body has a mid feel is little carbonation. Overall this beer has a lot of mixed appeal with the fruity and skunkiness combo. I still don't understand the appeal of green bottles though."
"Straw yellow with tons of carbonation bubbles. The head is white and sticky. Nice lacing around the glass. Smells mildly hoppy with grain the back ground. Taste very clean. A sweet malty grain helps balance out the spicy hop. Nothing over the top here. Light bodied clean and easy to drink. At $5.99 a six pack I would defenitely pick up this beer again on a hot day. Pairs well with any grilled burger or sausage."
"Pours a very light yellow with a thin white head that dissipates quickly and leaves scant lacing. Smells slightly hoppy, but is dominated by malts and grain. Taste is light and equal parts malty sweetness in the beginning and hops in the finish. Nothing particularly special going on here, but nothing offensive either. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean, with good carbonation, adn drinkability is perfectly acceptable. A solid import lager that is a decent drink, but offers nothing beyond the ordinary."
"Pours a yellow in color, light carbonation, basically no head, a little bit of lacing afterwards. Scents of slight malt and sweet. The taste is watery and a little malty, not much of an aftertaste to talk about. Light body. Drinkable, but not by much. I remember I use to like this brew alot years ago."
"Drinkability: (Yawn!) If you're looking for a bland, relatively unobtrusive beer, there are better and cheaper options out there."
"I really was not impressed with this beer. Right from the open it had a ""rotten veggie"" smell to it. The beer poured very nice in the glass, bright golden color, a little more clear than I anticipated. However, it had a good long lasting head. Very watery, and a chalky aftertaste. I dont think I will try this one again for a while. I have had better german ""light"" beers."
"Löwenbräu!!"
"Cheers!"
"I'd like to impugn its freshness but I can't since it was bought at a store that is run-by and caters to recent German immigrants. A delicate style, no doubt, I'd definitely try a fresh half-liter in Munchen for a more fair experience."
"A bit of malt in aroma.Light yellow, with fizzy head that dissipitates, a big brewery beer. Fairly low in taste. Crisp and clean, so fortunately no aftertaste and boring. Grassy herbal leading to metallic and airline fuel,and low in malt. Thin mouthfeel."
"Taste is clean yet rather bland. Very easy to drink, nothing too offensive here aside from a slight lemony sourness, but the malts mellow it nicely. As far as European Lagers go, this one surprised me. It's just very easy to drink. A bit softer in the mouth than I like, but that's a common complaint for me in this style. All around, a decent lager, this could easily be a good session beer, especially once I get past the initial skunkiness."
"A fine choice for a session or lawnmower beer."
"I havent had this since I was a, uh, well, lets say a while. Pours pale yellow in color, crystal clear with a clean white head. The aroma kicks out with light floral hops, malt and some light skunk aroma. Flavor is smooth breadlike malty, lightly hoppy, with a crisp minerally finish. Light and easily drinkable. This a good quality, well made beer (unlike years ago)."
"beer with high content of hops, natural foams, intense yellow color like helles; high fermentation, smell like crushed and broiled hops; tatse well ballanced, round, little bitter, as it must be, good for most of american, german, and mexican food, try with chinese too; serve in a pilsner glass for to observe its greatness. 95% recommended"
"Notes: very solid brew, average, but still good"
"One of my favorite light, macro type lagers. Good for watching TV or drinking with the GF."
"Drinkable but not to die for"
"¡Salud!"
"Soft velvety head fading on a pale golden color body. Smell of grainy malts with light notes of caramel. Something fruity too, a little bit like pumpkin soup. Taste of malts, a little bit more caramel than grain, slightly syrupy. Hints of citrus, accentuated by the carbonation. A dry hoppiness gets chewy and stays on the palate. Something enjoyably fruity gets quickly overwhelmed by the graininess of the malts and the dry hoppiness. Mouthfeel is quite round overall, with the seltzer like carbonation that sweetens and balances the brew. Decent."
"An OK and very drinkable lager."
"D: very refreshing Helles lager, thirst-quenching as much as easy-drinking."
"Poured a medium straw color...smallish white cap...too much carbonation. Odors of skunky over-boiled hops and a whiff of malt. Started weak but peppery from the carbonation then the malting is detectable with a too-quick dry finish punctuated by the hop ""tinnyness"". If you like ""Beck's"" youll think this is about equal in character. Malt is a bit too thin for my tastes and a tad over rated as an import."
"If you are new to the beer game and you like Budwieser or Heineken. Try Lowenbrau. These aint great beers. But they taste different enough for you to be able to taste the difference. Baby steps in beer differences are good. You can apreciate the differences in taste so that you can make a decision in what you may or may not like. Some beers in the Top 100 are great beers. But for a newbie who's been drinking macro lagers. May not appreciate them as such. Whoa, I rambled off the track a little. Thats my 2 cents."
"On a side note, this was my grandfathers favorite beer when he was younger so it's a little sentimental to me. But I tried to be objective while reviewing it."
"Poured yellow with a creamy head, nothing special. I was hoping the skunk wouldn't knock me down but it did. My girlfriend thought a skunk had entered the room, and i don't blame her. The taste though lacked the skunk. The taste is very light and sweet. Light hops if any. The mouthfeel was a little watery. Overall though it is very drinkable and refreshing(as long as you don't smell it."
"Clear golden with a high rise head that used all the freeboard of the Paulander witbier 0.5 L. glass. Then settled almost as fast leaving the upper 1/3 empty and lightly laced. A much diminished head persisted most of the duration. Light aroma of grassy grain, bready yeast and maybe a little hops. Taste was little of the same especially the bread. Mouthfeel toward the top end of style. Enjoyable to drink. Good for a pils but a little wanting for Munich Helles."
"Glad to see this choice at the Breakfast Club in Charlotte, an all 80's club that even featured Mickey's Big Mouth. Better music than beer choices. A bit bitter for the style. Could not really tell an appearance since the place didn't even have pint glasses for our enjoyment. Typical Munich import that I still haven't aquired a great taste of."
"Flavour is crisp and grainy, with a dry finish, this lager is more about mouthfeel that flavour. Grassy hops make an appearance on the finish as well. Mouthfeel is very crisp and dry and quite refreshing especially after a long hard day at work. Lacks complexity and doesnt have a great shelf life but nevertheless a great weizen beer to say the least!"
"Exceptionally pale beer, almost no color at all. Many fine bubbles and a decent, frothy head, though. Aroma is sweetish, very grainy malt. Flavor, likewise, is mostly sweet, light malt, but a touch of bitterness comes through along with faint, floral noble hop flavor. Light bodied with moderate carbonation. A difficult style for American microbrew fans, because even good examples often seem bland. This example, though, is blander than most."
"Poured a misty yellow with a creamy head, but the strong, STRONG smell of skunk hit immediately. There was little else that I could find, other than a faint grassy smell. Shockingly enough, there was no skunk in the taste, just a very lush taste of ginger, grans, and grape/pear. Very delightful! It came inches within being too fizzy for my likes, but didn't quite hit it. This is easily a staple!"
"Why the green bottle? It already says ""imported"" in bold letters. Sheesh. Pours a light golden yellow with a small, ephemeral guaze-white head. The nose is sweet with honeyish bread malt, backed by a minor leafy hop spice. Taste starts with pleasant sweetish malts. Cookieish base stands out mid-palate along with light cardboard, as a dash of noble, spicy, and surprisingly-unskunked hops balances it out. Finish is clean with light bitterness and sweet grains. Not bad. Light bodied with lively carbonation and a slightly dry finish."
"Pour a light golden with a foamy white head that laces quite well for a lager. Smell was hoppy and faintly of raisins... not unpleasant. Taste was nice smooth malt with the hops dropping by in the middle and staying for a good amont of time, but not overstaying their welcome. Mouthfeel was very smooth and pleasantly carbonated. This is a great session beer, especially in the summer... looking forward to the summer..."
"Pours your typical straw golden ""beer"" color with a shorter-lived head than the bottled version. Aroma is latent of the hopping levels the bottle seems to have, however the aroma is crisp with good, bready malt qualities. A faint hop tinge keeps it from being too malty for a helles. I definitely like the bottled version better. The draft version is lacking the defined crispness that the bottle has. It seemed rather dull in carbonation; and where I had it on draft is great in their draft tower(s) maintenence. Maybe it was a lifeless, stale keg... victimized by the Trans-Atlantic voyage."
"Tastes just a little sweet, with fruity malt up front and a little bit of dryness in the back. Subdued bananas throughout. Very nice, clean finish, very nice, creamy body."
"Taste is quite average nothing to jump on wall, a tiny bit sweet, a shy fruity presence is there banana and something else I cannot put my hands on well kind of reminding me of pumpkin. There some touch of barley too. No great feel in mouth reminding me of juice not beer, but not that I dislike."
"Pale straw yellow, little head, no lace. Slightly grainy smell with a touch of spicyness in nose. Sweet taste with same grainyness as smell, full flavor, but not full bodied. Continued carbonation give a refreshing clean finish, very drinkable for the masses."
"It poured a pale yellow with little head and no lacing. The smell was reminiscent of the old beer but just not very interesting. The taste was bland with little to distinguish it from any macro brewed anywhere in the world. The distinctly ""German"" lager flavor that I used love seems lost in this beer."
" I liked Millers version of this brew better."
"Just as I was about to throw up my hands in disgust at all euro lagers as being toohomogenous, i tried this beer. Looks and smells like many euro lagers, with their grassy malts, lack of head, and clear straw color. This has a more malt backbone to it, gives it a little substance that many euro algers lack. It makes it a bigger beer than it's comeptition, and better all-around in my book"
"Pours a very light gold color with a very nice head. Smells very hoppy and skunky. Tastes like it smells but with a nice little bite on the finish. Feels dry in the mouth, with no real kick. And as far as drinkability goes, again its just average. This is another average ""green bottle"" beer but I can see it tasting very good freshly brewed."
"I would classify this beer as ""average"" all the way."
"Grassy aroma. Minimal head, with quickly fading lace. Deep golden color. Mildly sweet flavor. Overall nicely balanced mouthfeel as it has a slight hop taste along with a nice background of malt. Not overly bitter, but sufficiently enough to be pleasing. Heavier feel on the palate than a typical lager. Finishes with a slight pine aftertaste, which is very pleasant."
"The beer spills from the 355ml green bottle a cloudless light gold color with the head dinosauric in size, foamy in texture and the color a brilliant white, as it dissolves the lace forms a thin white veil upon the glass. Nose is the standard lager/pils clean and fresh with a sweet malt backing, start is lightly sweet, the malt adequate, and the top cadaverous. Finish is moderately acidic, the hops apropos to the style, quite dry aftertaste, just the average light in body and flavor lager/pils, cannot say it is not refreshing, cannot really call it bad, it is what it is."
"Overall: A nice Euro-lager this is. It's pretty average for the most part, but it's a good example for its style and one of the better mainstream German lager beers, beating out Beck's, Warsteiner, and St. Pauli Girl."
"Came in a pint glass. Looked like a yellow/light golden color with some nice carbonation in there. I wished it had a little more in there, but that's ok. Smell was pretty clean, but yet light. The most noticable was some spicy hops, but even that was quite light. Taste had some of that spicy hop to it blended in with some grainy-like aftertaste. I would of liked to see some slight honey flavors to blend in with the spicy hops that were in there. But overall not a bad beer for the summer time."
"A pleasant light brew, not a favorite but there are far worse brews."
"This is a great beer to wash a good summer meal down with. This one poured a nice golden color with a small white head that faded quickly. Grain was at the front of the smell but did not overpower the small but good hop scent. The flavor was just what I was looking for today, nice and crisp with no skunkiness and a great flavor that quenched my thirst. Recommended."
"straw colored. crystal clear with a thick white head that doesn't stick around too long. grassy eurohop aroma with light graininess. the skunkiness pretty subdued. sweet light malt character with some light hop betterness. crisp and refreshing but kinda watery. pretty drinkable it just doesn't have much to offer. i'd like to see more pronounced flavor."
"Bottle: Poured a golden colored beer with a standard head. Aroma is quite weak with only some malt coming out of my glass. The same applies for the taste, which is quite weak. I dont have a lot of experience with helles and this leaves me with the feeling of macro crap lager."
"Löwenbräu Original is a classic example of style... Long live Löwenbräu Original"
"Aroma has a slight but not overwhelming skunkiness to it. It seems to dissipate a bit after pouring. Clear golden color with a head that fades pretty quickly. Mouthfeel is creamy, yet not too dense. Slight twang of German hops fades to a light sweetness on the palate. Overall, not a bad brew. I think it would be refreshing on a hot summer's day."
"--Joey"
"A very nice beer. It is light and refreshing without being like macro beers. This is a great everyday brew."
"Small, white, foamy head dies to film. Leaves no lacing. Clear, clear, yellow-gold beer. Smell is elastic bands. Seriously. It's kind of like skunk, but really more like soft rubber. The front is sweet, corny. A little oily, not too thin. Finishes dry and quite nutty. Some alcohol in there too. Corny aftertaste. Refreshing. Not bad at all."
"I must first say, it was disappointing drinking this from a bottle after having it on draft. Why anyone would use green bottles... Pours a nice clear light golden with a thick white foamy head tht lasts well and sticks to the sides well. The aroma is sort of a mild skunkiness mixed with German hops. The taste starts light and turns to a sweet mellow maltiness with nice European hop finish that is a bit fuller than the start. It ends with a hint of skunkiness (probably due to the bottle)"
"Exits the bottle and into the glass with a firm, white rocky head that sat about 1 inch above the rim of the glass...impressive! Pale golden-yellow liquid with a clean and crisp delicate malty nose. Tasting gives notes of light to medium mouthfeel with a nice balance of malt to hop, not too heavy either way, just...nice. The hoppiness carries thru to the clean and refreshing finish. A nice German lager that doesn't offend in any way. Very drinkable, especially out in the sun on this warm late Winter day. A bargain too I might add, $8.99 for a fresh 12 pack."
"Not a bad beer but not inceredibly great either."
"All in all, a great lager, is nice and easy to drink, not quite as good as the oktoberfest lager but this is one amazing session beer, plus its a bargin"
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head. The aroma is average. It is of pale malts and lager yeast along with a slight green glass skunkiness. The taste is not that impressive. It is light with a slight maltiness. It goes down slow with a bit of a breadlike finish. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is not a favorite of mine. The bread taste lingers and doesn't go well with this style."
"Drinkability  Surprisingly fun to drink. It may seem a little cheesy at the grocery store, especially since its so widely distributed, but this one is worth a second look, especially if you enjoy the style."
"Brilliantly clear auric hue. Thick, fluffy, persistent porcelain white head leaves meandering, but steadfast lace. Gentle, doughy sweet malt with a toasty, dextrin edge dominates the aroma. Grassy, peppery hops are secondary. Trace sulfur adds slight savory twang. Stately, functional and clean aromawise. In flavor, the prevalent malt character is intially of simple, grainy, white bread like pilsner malt. Becomes progressively drier and parching on the palate, with dessicated cracker notes riding parallel with subtle hay hints that retain a vestige of Saaz derived bitter grassiness. Immaculately clean in flavor and well brewed. Lightly bodied and very well attenuated, but quite brisk and thirst quenching as a result. Finishes abrupt, with a snap of maltose like sweetness and husky grain. Quite an enjoyable, simple, well crafted Helles that seems more apt for a sultry summer afternoon, not a frigid plains winter night. Shy in malt backbone, but it really doesn't need one."
"Pours a golden yellow with a huge head that dissipated rather quickly.Its aroma sweet with malts and just hints of hops. It also had a slight hint of skunk. The taste was also sweet with a heavy dose of malts and still had the skightest bit of hops to offset the malt a little bit. It was a good beer. Much better than most American lagers."
"pretty much washes down without leaving any indication you ever drank it."
"This beer certainly isn't one to be heralded from the heavens, but it serves as a good thirst quencher. If choosing a German macro, I'd take this over Beck's any day"
"Regardless, it is a nice smooth beer and one that I wont turn down."
"The palate is full of flavour! Spice malt mingles wonderfully with some fruity hop flavours. Its a real treat to drink this beer, considering it is on par price wise with some other imports of far less quality and flavour. Get some today!"
"John"
"one of the best session beers you can get anywhere. especially for the price, lowenbrau original is what i classify as the standard for a lager thats tasty but never hard to drink. once again the germans show how its done when it comes to lagers. thank goodness for the reinheitgesbot."
"Came in a green 330ml bottle, with the turquiose and gold label, golden lion logo, and best before date stamped on. I have to admit, this is a fine looking lager, I'm impressed. Clear golden body, massive carbonation action, decent snow white head on the pour that actually increased as I let it sit for a bit (letting the beta German Breweries page download), which I have never seen before. Head lasts most of the way down the glass and leaves an intricate spiderweb of lacing. Nose is predominantly that of malt resembling sweet pastry, very faint floral hop in the background. Flavour is crisp and grainy, with a dry finish, this lager is more about mouthfeel that flavour. Grassy hops make an appearance on the finish as well. Mouthfeel is very crisp and dry. I must have gotten a great batch (compared to what has been reviewed before me), because I am pleasantly surprised with this lager, would definitely pick it up again. A mighty fine lager."
"A good beer. I was a bit surprised, to tell you the truth. I was expecting swill and I got something else. It proves that some of the mass-producers of beer can take at least a modicum of pride in their work."
"Nice healthy clear gold under a fizzy white head that disappeared disappointingly quickly. By half way down the glass, there was no film, no collar, no lace. No good. The nose is nice and malty, while the mouth is very prickly and medium-bodied. The taste is malt, malt, malt - as it should be. There's a touch of hops in the finish, just to keep the brew honest, but the aftertaste is just malt. When I lived in Munich 20 (ugh! Is it really already 20?) years ago?), this was my least favorite Munich brew. Apparently, it or my taste buds or both, haven't changed."
"A pretty nice beer, although I'd call it a pilsner. Some soapy flavor comes through, which I don't care for, but aside from that it's a refreshing, clean pale lager."
"Watery comes to mind. There was some slight maltiness and a hint of hops, but very unsatisfying and nowhere near the classic Lowenbrau of my youth."
"Light gold color, small head. A light bodied Euro-lager. Some flavor to it, but mostly a typical Euro-lager. Some malts, some hops, some flavor, but not much else. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nothing great, but OK."
"Light yellow color with a faint smell of hops. Medium mouthfeel, with a malty flavor with a slight hoppy aftertaste. Nice head that dissipated quickly, lacing a bit on the way down the glass. Easy enough to drink, but I find myself leaning toward ales more than lagers, so I might be a bit prejudiced. Seems to me this tastes better than the ones I had in my younger days. As far as the lagers I tried, not bad overall."
"Poured a very pale straw. Some skunk in the aroma (green bottle, so to be expected). Firm mouthfeel. Some apple and grape notes in the malt, with a bittersweet finish. Not bad, and better than the run of the mill macro lager, but can't hold its own against even an average German pils, such as Bittburger."
"I had this too wash down the taste of some bad beer. Had another, too actually enjoy. This has a similar taste too what I remember the Lowenbrau original being. But, I think this more hoppy. Poured a pale yellow, with a whoosh head that quickly settled down to a half finger. Left a thin, but steady, lace on the pilzner glass. Smelled a bit hoppy, not what I was expecting. The malt came through in the taste. Hops were evident on the back of the tongue. Crisp, very crisp mouthfeel. Sort of like a dry leaf. Better than most lagers in its class."
"Had this beer in a beer bar. It was priced the same as the micros and it was marked as (supposedly) the ""real"" Löwenbräu. Well, it looks like a Bud. no head. Straw yellow. Smells like a typical macro, too. Tastes like it was made from rice. At least it feels clean and crisp and you can easily throw one of these tasteless brews down."
"Drinkablilty: while i acknowledge that this isn't the best beer going, i enjoy it for what it is. i don't mind having this every now and then."
"Certainlly much better than when it was brewed in Canada."
"Perhaps one of my gateway lagers, I hold some high esteem for one of the only imports in colombia. The pour is light straw, carbonated with clearer-than-normal bubbles within, and a rather medium clean white head. Malty smell, some alcohol and astringency coming off (not bad tho). The taste is rather nice bodied, sweeter than normal combining a balanced bitterness as well. Medium body makes it above average. Plus you can drink quite a few."
"It had been quite awhile since I had one of these when I was in a local tavern I decidrd to get it.Poured a yellow/straw color with light head,somewhat of a sweet smell to it lightly metallic.Some mild bitterness and slight fruitiness but real light in flavor.Pretty easy to drink,better than alot of domestic lagers."
"Another green bottle, another beer that tastes like the other green bottle guys. Anything that says premium lager is becoming pretty suspiscious in my mind. This one is extra pale in appearance, but not as bitter in the taste. Seems pretty smooth. Nothing special about this beer. Summing up, skip it."
"I have a pretty bad memory for taste, but Im pretty sure I like this better now then I did a few years ago."
"A decent pale lager that is fairly middle of the road, but much better than American macro interpretations. Very clear light gold color with an adequate white head. Clean, crisp taste that provides a nice balance between the malt and hops. Just a bit of off nose from the bottling, but nothing of great concern on the sample. Dry finish and moderate body feel."
"Truly, the best pilsner I've ever tasted. With its light feel, I could drink this all night, yet it still packs a punch. This is the kind of beer that I would like to permanently stock my fridge with, because it tastes great and there's no time that I would be ""not in the mood"" for it as I could be with exceptionally rich beers like, say, Storm King."
"A good pale Lager from ""vom Fass"". Light in flavor but refreshing and low alcohol make this highly drinkable. It is a hoppy lager that has a nice malt finish. Great beer to drink with any food since it does not overpower. Not their best beer but much better than the U.S. equivalent."
"I wasn't sure what to expect with this beer. It seems to be pretty popular at the local store so I thought I would give it a try. As soon as I popped the cap a very strong skunky aroma seemed to fill the whole room. Once I poured it into the glass it seemed to lose a lot of that skunky smell. It was a decent looking beer. A thick white head that lasted for most of the brew. The beer itself was a very light golden-yellow. The aroma was crisp with a little bit of hop bitterness detectable. There was also a slight hint of sweet malts. Taste was sort of grainy up front followed by sweet malts toward the end. There wasn't much of an aftertaste. I felt this brew may have been overly carbonated, it felt a little sharp on the tongue. Not a bad brew but certainly nothing special."
"pours out a chill haze clear copper colour. thin fine head and wisps of lace. nice caramel malt aroma, floral hoppiness makes a nice compliment. just a touch of euro skunk...not a detriment. tasty bread and biscuit maltiness...toffee tints...all wrapped up in a ghostly bitter, crisp hop finish. medium bodied with a mouthfeel that is quite creamy smooth. lowenbrau makes for a tasty and satisfying euro lager. recommended."
"Lowenbrau original lager is a classic beer out of Munich, that has found it's way into my faceted mug this fine evening. It pours with a golden with a nice foaming head that leaves trickled lace around my mug. With the aroma of the typical European lager which is a bitter hop background wrapped with some fine malts. Nothing extradordinary but it's too simple not to love, I would definitely partake in a few of these if I found my way to an Oktoberfest. The taste is crisp and full that leaves a pleasant slightly spicy aftertaste on the palate. Classic lager that comes roaring with a crisp sharpness only to mellow out as the high carbonation tickles the back of the throat. Very drinkable and for 20 bucks a case a great beer to throw down for a session of suds."
"A big red stamp on the label indicates that this beer is Imported from Munich, Germany. Pours a clear pale light golden color with a creamy white head that dissipates into a good amount of sticky lace. Nose is very reminiscent of sour dough bread. Light to medium in body with a very clean and crisp mouthfeel. Taste is sweet bready malts up front followed by a good amount of bitter hops leaving a dry, crisp, and refreshing finish. A fairly simple yet enjoyable brew."
"This beer poured out crystal clear, bright and golden. The head was white and frothy. Nice balance between the grain and the hops. Perfect bitterness. The finish was dry. I'm getting a slight pleasant sourness from this beer. In my opinion, this is a very good session beer and an almost flawless German lager. The price was well worth it @ $18.00 a case."
"Pours a decidedly clear, pale straw color. Topped with a hefty cake of white foam that dissipates quickly with some lacing, especially at the top of the glass. Clean, grassy nose with only faint hits of skunkiness. (Admittedly, I may be looking for some.) Taste is better than expected, though certainly not great. Light bready taste with a reasonably dry finish. Nothing complex here, but drinkability is noteworthy. Mouthfeel is oilier than preferred."
"(12oz bottle)-- The appearance is a clear straw yellow color/golden with a thin white lace. Sprity carbonation. On the nose the aroma is fairly clean, light grassy herbs, and some faint grain. Mouthfeel is crisp, tingly and a little spritzy. On the palate the flavor consisted of hop bitterness, hints of grain, little grassy and mild sweetness as it warms. Tasty brew..."
"Not bad for a $20 a case import, but there is much better domestic micros out there for comparable price."
"Overall its not bad but nothing to write home about."
"This is the original German Lowenbrau, not the Miller knock-off. Pours pale straw, consistant with German pilsners. Not much head. Taste is a bit drier than most. Decent hoppiness. Malt is faint, but there. Aftertaste is dry with an alcohol twange. Overall, I liked it. I would buy it again if it was cheap."
"Shiny yellow straw color. Fizzy white head. Some off smells to start. Sour bread dough smell. Once over the smell, taste is crisp and refreshing. Bready malt presence, not grainy though. Hop kick is very refreshing. Dry finish, no aftertaste to mention. Easy to drink, light bodied. A good alternative beer to big boys. I had it with bachelors night dinner of leftover bbq chicken and mac and cheese."
"I'll drink it again if it's offered to me."
"I read a couple of reviews that this beer is not as good as it is in Europe. I really can't tell you this 'cause i didn't tasted it in America in Europe though it's a VERY well processed beer with nice appearance and well carbonated. Taste it to see for yourself"
"A well balanced dry brew with no after taste....the colour is exellent as a rich golden offering and the head slowly disapates to a slim white collar around the lip of the glass. The taste is quite good but leaves to quickly disapointing the consumer...which unfortunatly is me, resulting in a lower score."
"Standard yellow lager, green bottle syndrome overpowers the nose, a decent maltiness provides a tasty base (a sign of helles), little in the way of hops although the finish is nicely and subliminally dry. Appeasing mouthfeel with thick foamy head. Recommended for just about anybody, even macro-swillers, but try to get enclosed 12-packs - this green bottle thing really sucks."
"It poured a really pale yellow with a white head of a ½ inch.  The aroma was creamy, hoppy, and grassy, in other words, a typical European Style-Lager.  There is nothing wrong with being typical.  If you like the style you should have a Lowenbrau!  Overall, it is above average where it counts (taste and drinkability)."
"Another one of those ""evil twin"" beers. In Europe, it has a great taste. In America, it just does not make the crossing. I find that it tastes a little better than Bud, overprocessed"
"""Here's to good friends..."""
"When I tkink of Lowenbrau I think of the 70's. I still remember the advertising of this brew as being something alittle upperclass when out on the town.Back then it was. I guess id order this out at a nice dinner if all the has were macro & the green ""H" beer. This is a good classic german pilsner thats not bad with a meal. It has a good head and lace and the taste is not overpowering. ( good table manners )"
"This is one of the first beers I ever tried when I first got into this whole thing.  Nice and golden at the pour with a great head on it, the aroma was a sign of things to come for me in the way of European beers.  Very nice."
"Thick head, quickly settles to thin lace. A good lager, but nothing very complex and nothing really stands out. Probably not as good in bottle or can, but tasty from the pump."
"My only complaint is paying premium price for a totally average beer, even if all ""better"" beers should match or exceed Lowenbrau's quality.  To separate the good from the non-good, look no further."
"Light amber in color, with moderate head with large bubbles.  Smells somewhat hoppy and spicy.  Taste is fresh tasting with good hop bite. Finishes off sweet than it starts. A slightly above average brew."
"Notes: Not bad ... not bad at all. Surprise surprise, this brew has taken a turn for the better now being brewed in Canada under contract by Labatt. Decent use of hops to balance the malt ... enough to suffice any beer geek and not too much to turn the macro drinker away. Give it a try ..."
"Its OK, drinakble clean, slightly sweet at the start and then a crisp bitterness, fairly light on in body and flavour."
"Very good impression..."
"Nice pale gold, holds a small head. Nothing like I expected, not as hoppy. It was kinda dry on the finish. Served cold it is crisp with a hint of spice. Seems readily available up north, never saw it in the south."
