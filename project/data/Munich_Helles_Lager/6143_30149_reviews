review_text
"Poured into a Sierra Nevada shaker pint. Pours a light to medium golden amber with a quarter finger white head that dissipates to patches and wispy lacing. Aroma of sweet bready malt, grain, faint grassy hops. Flavor follows, with sweet bready malt, fairly grainy, moderate German style hop bitterness in the finish, which has a light biscuit malt character. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A fairly traditional helles lager with light flavor combining grains and light sweet malt. Nothing exciting, but a solid lager."

"O: This is decent represention of the style, but seemed like it could have used a little more in the way of hops to strike a balance with the malts."

"Light body and a clean, malty flavor with just a hint of hoppy spiciness. The beer is nice and sweet with low bitterness. The noble hops at mid-palate mix with the malt and infuse an apple-like flavor into the beer. Very pleasant and easy-drinking, but lacks any malt complexity. A beer to be enjoyed with a meal, not much more."
"O -- Got this off the shelf of a largely reputable, small-chain liquor store in the Chicago area. Can't tell by the dating code how old this is (have to look into it), but I'm just a little disappointed at how off this beer is."

"This is a good beer for the guy wanting to try something different. It's not far from Bud or Coors in style but amazingly better and tastier."

"O - A damn good lager. Plenty of taste, yet extremely refreshing. A great representation of the style. Based on the small amount of reviews here, doesn't seem to be a lot of this going around. But if you still see this stuff, any quality lager fan should grab this."

"Poured from a porcelain top bottle, this bright yellow brew clung briefly to the side of my glass. Refreshing and crisp it is pleasing to the taste and nose. The head as mentioned quickly dissipates but still not bad , better than most. I would gladly drink this again although I would not search it out."

"Drinkability: easy and quite appealing more than originally anticipated."
"The beer had a light feel to it. The beer was clean and smooth. Overall, not a bad beer, but certainly not the best representation of the style. I doubt that I will pick this one up again."
"This isnâ€™t a must try beer."
"D- Pretty high. Think it cost $3.50 and Cap n' Cork. I'd do it again, though I'd like to try it on tap to compare some of the flavors that may have to do with bottling and transport."
"The aroma is subtle, powdery, light minerals. the flavor is full for a lager. I'm not terribly familiar with munich helles lagers, but I'm quite impressed by the flavor. There's definitely a european...ness to this beer."
"I couldn't really feel the alcohol in this and even though the bottle was a pint serving, I could have had a few of these during the course of a drinking session. With some lighter bread or fruit, this would pair well with it and although it's not the best beer I've had lately, I don't think that anyone could be disappointed with this at all."
"D: Good drinkability, a summertime lager with a clean malty body and noble green hopping I come to expect per style. A good intro beer for friends into the world of craft and lagers/helles as it is not overbearing and fairly easy to handle, but with much better flavor and fulfillment then your typical American adjunct."
"D- Moderately high. I could down a few of these. Some good flavors in this one. No idea what the availability/price is, but I'd buy a few if I saw 'em."
"I'm not a big fan of the german lagers, but this one was excellent"
"not bad, its a lager, and it works for it was meant for, no complaints."
"Taste is similar, a very nice, solid helles character with some firm elements, but thin and simple compared to the best. It has grain, lightly raisiny alcohol, light apple, simple but firm tingly-zesty herbs, a nice spritzy-juicy hint of lemon. Carbonation is on the lower side. Feel is decent, firm but not great, not watery but on the thinner side, not lively and rather nondescript. Drinkability is pretty high."
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is grain and some grassy hops. The flavor is grain, wheat and grassy hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. There is nothing wrong with this beer, it is just not too exciting."
"A malty finish with a hint of aspirin from perhaps being a little too long in the bottle for my preference (over six months)."
"This German lager gets all the details right: light, fluffy head floating over straw to honey slightly clouded liquid gold. The head is fluff of microscopic bubbles that fade to light lacing, a smell of bread and yeast that yields to a malty sweetness, with just a hint of herb from the hops. The taste is classic and rich; certainly won't satisfy any palate looking for a hoppy shot, but this classic lager is rich and buttery with lots of flavor for bier that's gone through laggered fermentation. Helles: full beer rather than hefe, half. Rich, buttery mouthfeel. Very drinkable; repeatable. Lovely."
"Drinkable, but that's about it."
"A well-done lager from Bavaria. It would definitely kick more ass on tap and at the price of a bottle ($2.99), certainly worth your money."
"Slainte."
"A really tasty (inexpensive) lager. To be honest, I wasn't even going to write a review until I took a sip. A great deal and FFO Aying Jarhundert."
"d - Overall, I felt the beer was just a little lacking of taste, and wasn't that great. It's very easy to drink at 5% ABV and not bad at all, but nothing I would seek out again."
"This is not a beer I'd care to have again. There are tons of other lagers out there that better represent the style."
"Pours a three finger white head that fades quickly to a broken layer leaving some lace. Crystal clear pale amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Light hoppy nose. Flavor is malty balanced by the hops. Slight bitter finish. $4.99 for a 500ml flip top bottle from Smiley's Beverage Dover, NH. Best by Sep 2010."
"A very drinkable and satisfying lighter lager that won't make you feel bloated. Nicely balanced, and grounded, but it won't knock your socks off. Did you actually want your socks knocked off?"
"From the 500 ml. bottle with an expiration date of 10/10. Sampled on December 31, 2009. It pours a clean looking golden yellow with a short-lived fizzy white head and bubbly carbonation. The aroma clearly gives away its German origin with the expected malt, bready, and barley combination. The taste also had a strong note of malts but it was a little on the sour side. Fairly typical for its style but nothing exciting."
"Very easy-drinker. A balanced lager without the gassiness, or mediocrity. Better than expected."
"Drinkability - I have to disagree with most of the middle-range scores given to this beer thus far. I really enjoyed this offering and put it in my top ten or so MHLs I've had here stateside."
"Mouthfeel was smooth with minimal carbonation. I would gladly drink this one again."
"A good beer, but not a standout. A bit more crispness in body and a cleaner taste (without the corn-like sweetness) and the beer may be able to stand along side of the Warsteiners and Paulaners of famed German brewing."
"Appears a pale golden straw hue the glass is lined with chill haze, a bright white head forms nicely but dwindles rather quickly. Ample lacing is left evenly in my new Prima Pils glass. Aroma has a semi sweet toasted malt lightly toasted crackers or biscuit malt presence. Semi tart character going on with very light herbal hops in the background. Flavor has cereal notes with herbal hops a mineral character going on as well. A pretty bland and straight forward light German lager. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation nothing too exciting or overwhelming here, nice packaging with pretty average beer. Drinkability is pretty easy going a mellow, low flavor thirst quenching lager no complaints really does most things the style sets out to do."
"Very poor beer (unless I got a bad sample--swing-tops aren't to be trusted)."
"Very good beer! Delicious in fact! Got this bottle from Sam's in Chicago a couple of weeks ago. Poured with a nice foamy, frothy, white head and a little lace. Bright & clear yellow gold color. Aroma is mildly sweet, malty, a bit of hops, beery. Flavor has a lot more going on. Bigger interplay between sweetness and bitterness. Tasty. Good pale German lager body and carbonation. Clean balanced finish leaves me asking for another swallow. Excellent finish. Session beer"
"This is a decent easy drinking beer. I'd like it to have more crispness in the flavor and a touch more bitterness to balance out the sweetness."
"From notes. 500 mL swingtop bottle. Pours a clear gold with sticky white head, spotty but clingy lacing. Smell: light clean bready malts, slight grassy hops. Taste: soft pale malts, grassy noble hops, little bit of grain, drying grainy finish. Mouthfeel: light bodied, light carbonation, very smooth. Pretty good helles, worth a try."
"Nice little pop given off from the flip top. The beer pours easily compared to the other Moosbacher varieties. There is very little head that disipates quickly. The color is a clear golden. The smell is of sweet malt with a light pleasant bitter hops. The flavor is of malts up front with a nice amount of carbonation, and a hint of hops in the back end. Very good beer, high drinkability. Nothing too exceptional. Great well balanced beer if you want to have a light malty beer without all the hops."
"Don't ever buy this beer. You'd be paying for a shit American macro that just happened to be brewed in Germany."
"Overall. I certainly wouldn't turn one away."
"3.5/4/4.5/4/4.5"
"Bottle courtesy of Mike at Cole's. A drinkable though moderately astringent lager. Light yellow cpolour, littl head, a bit of lace at end. ARoma is interesting. A bit of less than average mouthfeel,grainy, a bit of hops, above average carbonation.Helles lager."
"""Use before 12/08"" notched on the side of the label. 16.9oz flip top bottle with stopper. Pours a golden yellow color with a thin white head that quickly fades away. The aroma features a pretty nice grainy maltiness with not much in the way of hops. The taste is sweet malt up front, with the spicy hops being a bit more noticeable than in the aroma. The taste is in now way overly complex or anything, but it is a solid lager. The drinkability is very nice, I could see myself enjoying a few bottles over a nice German meal. Overall, this is a pretty good lager that I wouldn't mind trying again. Definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability here is pretty good. I got this in a 4 pack and I will most assuredly be getting another. This would be a great summer beer."
"This is a pedestrian/mediocre Helles. Pretty bland. Easy enough to drink, but there are much better, crisper, tastier lagers out there."
"Pours a golden ginger ale color with little head to be found. Mild, malty aroma with little hops perceived. Low carbonation and lacing. Taste is malty with the slightest hops in the distant background and a thin mouthfeel. A bit on the sweet side, this brew would definitely benefit from a more pronounced hoppiness. All in all a decent lager, but nothing more than average and something I would not seek out."
"The beer pours a beautiful gold color with a 1/2"" white head that fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a crisp, clean pilsner malt scent. It's dry with little hop aroma. The taste is average. It has a very bland pilsner malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry with slight hop presence. There is very little malt character here. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an average Helles. It's nothing exciting. I won't be seeking this one out in the future."
"This is anything but big. It's even a bit meek in the helles lager style. But it has a certain charm to it."
"D: This drinks extraordinarily well. I will definitely be buying it again to enjoy with dinner."
"Moosbacher Lager pours a golden yellow from a half liter swingtop bottle. It poured with a one centimeter head that quickly fell to a thin layer. A bit of sweet malt on the nose, but very mild. Body is appropriately light, active carbonation. Nice flavor, malty but well balanced. There's some hops there, but primarily to even things out. A nice lager."
"Prosit. MK"
"From an imported flip-top 0.5L bottle--it poured very light yellow with just the barest haze and a bright white foamy head. Stark buttery hoppy aroma. Germanic and tight, this is a nice light lager. ItÂ’s smooth, with a light hoppy frosting over a mellow malt foundation. Soft to the palate. Quite good. (#2746, 3/14/2007)"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" bright white head above the clear light gold (yellow?) brew. Head falls gradually, with extra-sticky white lace. Aroma is minimal, light malts and hoppiness. Taste starts with sweet pale maltiness, and is balanced by crisp hoppiness soon after. Light fleeting tartness out of place in the center. Mouthfeel and drinkability are middle of the road. As my other experience with them, nothing bad, just nothing standout either."
"This beer has a light golden color with a slight head, moderate carbonation. The flavor for me was almost all honey and biscuit. Very drinkable, smooth. I did enjoy this beer but I might not buy it again, just because there are others that I have not gotten to."
"Moosbacher Lager is in the same general vicinity as its hefe weizen and dunkel weizen stablemates; perhaps not quite as tasty. It's a strictly middle-of-the-road Munich helles lager that I have no interest in drinking again once this bottle is kaput. Actually, if we're talking Autobahn, it's far right lane all the way. Feel free to pass at will."
"This brew pours a very clear, extremely pale yellow color. Modest white head. The brew really isnÂ’t much to look at. The smell, however is faint but pretty nice. Decent light pale malt aroma, backed by Saaz hops. The taste is a mix of malt and grain, with a good hop balance. The malt flavor really holds this beer together. Lightly sweet, with fairly low carbonation. The finish is clean, with a bit of malt and hops mixing together. Not outstanding, but drinkable and pretty good overall."
"Pours a transparent light golden color with a smallish white head. No lacing. Looks like some light apple juice. Smell is a bit spicy with some bready character, almost like crackers, underneath and a clean yeast flavor. Taste follows. Quite light in the malt dept. Clean upfront but then there's a nice little bitter bite towards the end. Only the slightest hints of metal and cardboard come through in the finish. They're not too off putting though. Nice and fairly clean, light with just enough flavor. Washed down my sub quite well while I watched the World Cup opener."
"0.5l flip top bottle. Use before 10 06 on label."
