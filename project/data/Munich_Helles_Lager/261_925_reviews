"Overall: Nice helles lager. Would have like more toasted than sweet notes."

"Summer of Lager is rather authentic tasting version of a Munich helles lager. Kudos to Cisco Brewers for making a summer beer that bucks the norm."

"Overall it's a fine beer, but doesn't really impress me, and comes off slightly disappointing than anything. Warmth really brings the honey and sweetness out more too. Maybe 3.78 isn't so bad after all."

"CAME BACK TO THIS AFTER HARD INDIAN SUMMER PADDLE. Liked it even more. Great with scallops, crabcakes, summer veggies over peppers. Hard to imagine a better treatment of this style. I wish it would come in cans!"

"I had this on a hazy summer day at The Pony Bar on Manhattan's Upper East Side. Don't expect a summer wheat or kolsch because this beer is clearly a helles lager made to represent the German style. The smell was a bit doughy, like yeast meeting malts. The color was a bright orange. The taste reminded me more of a pilsner but better. Malt grain, a touch of citrus and virtually no hops. Overall it was ok, just not my preferred style."
"Woodychandler comes through again with yet another canned beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, a bit of malts and grains. Taste is crisp, malty, a touch of lemon, some light hops, very refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a thirst quenching beer on a hot day."
"Have to say really liked this offering from Cisco as an alternative to wheat and kolschs that seem to rule the summer beer scene. Poured out of the can into a pilsner glass. The color is a dark golden with a fluffy head. Crisp flavor with slight fruit hints. Easy aroma that's good for day drinking. Good stuff."

"I got a spritz during the Crack, so it got a few minutes to CANtemplate what was going to happen next before I initiated the Glug. As any simpleton, like me, might have deduced, an inverted aggro Glug was going to be nothing but trouble, so even with a gentle Glug, I was still getting foaming. It all worked out, however, as I ended up with two dense, foamy fingers of bone-white head that resembled to top of a swirly vanilla ice cream cone. Color was a deep sunshine-yellow with NE-quality clarity. SRM = 4/5. Nose smelled like the interior of a malt room at a brewery! Mouthfeel was medium-to full, big for a lager and the taste was biscuit malt and maybe some Noble hops to lend a grassiness to it. Mmmm. This was very dry, especially on the finish and I found myself longing for some pretzels to go with it. Would this go in my cooler? Heck, yes!"

"O: I applaud Cisco for attempting to make a style that is not very popular with American brewers. But that said, this is not close to a traditional Helles lager that you would get at a beer hall or beer garden in Munich. Certainly tasty enough to have more than a few on a hot summer day at the beach though."

"F - Does the trick of a quality lager. Light, crisp, refreshing. Carbonation is felt very nicely."
""
"O/D-A nice lager but its quite expensive. Good move putting it in a 12 pack of cans. The older, large format bottles were far too pricey for a good, yet fairly simple Lager."
""

""
""
"O: Not your typical Munich Helles Lager, but worth a shot. A good summer beer."
""
""
"D: nice to have a little more balls on this munich hellles, but still needs a little refining imo. worth trying however and nice to see an American craft brewing this style."
""
"Summer of Lager offers nice grainy malt and citrus aroma on the nose. The taste is extremely well-balanced, with a citrus and herbal hop punch just strong enough to be thirst quenching over the well-composed grainy pilsner-esque malt base. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing, and the drinkability is good. A very good lager."

"O: A little early in the season, but this is a really good beer for the summer"
""
"Overall: It's a very flavorful and complex beer. While it is refreshing and easy to drink, this lager is way more complicated than the horde of ales that define the summer season. This is either good or bad, depending on what you're expecting from the brew. If you're tired of the typical summer ale and thirst for something different, it's a good thing. If you just want something simple, quenching and refreshing for the summer months, it's bad. Either way, no one who appreciates beer would have a hard time enjoying it all the same."

"Nice overall, pretty dry and refreshing without being overly thin."
"Quite frankly taste is not much better than your standard lager. If you're looking for something that lingers a bit on your pallet and presents a bit more robustly, this is your lager."
""
""
""
"Overall-- this is a very good canned lager. I like it. Better than its rating."
""
"Pours a golden straw color with a white head that dissipates slowly. Aroma is mostly cereal grains and a clean grassy aroma. A light citrusy note comes through on the end of the nose. This is all goes into a pretty nice flavor on the taste, with a clean grassy brightness that makes way to a lime zest like finish, all the while being anchored by a cereal grain like maltiness. Very solid lager here. Easy to pound these without thinking about it."
""
""
"O: Good stuff."
"Notes: this is a fine beer, balanced good looking (the old gold color is dark for the style). It has a pleasant taste and mouthfeell. My only issue is that the ABV is a bit high as this is such a sessionable beer and 5.6% is too high for this. Overall, a top notch lager."
""

"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a crisp, orange-gold color with a filmy white head. Aromas of toasted oats and butter blended along the nose. The beer's flavors are light and smooth, with a dry hopped bitterness at the end of the palate. Honey and toasted oats throughout, as well. The aftertaste is slgihtly resiny, with a roasted character. Smooth bodied finish, making this a tasty, very easy drinking brew."
"O: This beer is easy to drink and has a good balance between malts and hops, neither of which seems to stand out in particular."
""
"Overall a tasty beer with great lager characteristics."
""
""
"Overall a pretty exceptional Helles lager. Would buy again if given the chance."
"A nice Helles Lager, true to the style."
""
""
"O: Very enjoyable and quite easy to drink - very refreshing and one I would gladly have again."
"Pours a clear, light copper with a dense white head that settles to a nice cap. Aromas of grainy malt, faintly herbal hops, and a touch of buttered popcorn and sweet caramel. Taste consists of more lightly grainy malt, caramel, and herbal, grassy hops with just a touch of bitterness in the finish. Quite easy-drinking. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp, with a medium-thin body and good carbonation. Really nice Lager overall, perfect for...the Summer. They should name it that or something."
""
""
"Notes: Good and drinkable with a good dry finish with a wisp buttery texture. Cheers."
""
"O: I didn't care for the smell much, but it was a decent!"
""
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to pound down for a while when you’re looking for something simple."
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall a decent helles lager. I liked the nose, though the taste was a bit average. Nice for a summer day, would have again but wouldn't seek it out."
""
""
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light pale malt scent with a slight lemony zest and a dry lager yeast aroma. The taste is good. It has a light and fruity pale malt flavor with a tart finish. It is lemony and quite refreshing. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an excellent lager and a real summer time treat."
""
""
"O: Was quite enjoyable, perfect for the BBQ and sipping around the pool, especially in cans. At the time did not realize it was 6.25%, very nice for that abv."
"Mouthfeel is good- light body, good crisp carbonation. This is a very nice beer, but it can't stand up to the flavors of summer food (flavor was stomped out by a burger). For this style just get weihenstephaner."
""
"O- Overall, this is a fantastic summer beer. It is light bodied and highly drinkable, but has enough flavor to make a very nice session beer without getting bored. Did not know this was over 6% ABV, that surprised me! It is very drinkable! Recommended!"
"O: A pretty balanced German-style lager for the summer sippin' season. At a time when Kolsch, American pale wheat ales and pilsners dominate the summer landscape, I'm glad to see a sturdy, 6.25% ABV German lager make it's way into the fold."

"Ok, so I waited on this one a bit too long, it being mid-October when I finally got around to cracking it open. Pours into a shaker, a clear bronzed yellow with a slight chill haze, and a nice foamy white head that recedes to a thin layer leaving a bit of lace behind. I really like the aroma: honey and a touch of yeast funk, bready with a touch of hops. Crisp taste of grains and toasted bread, light floral hop bitterness for a dry finish and overall nice balance. Light mouthfeel, a tad metallic in the aftertaste, but definitely refreshing and drinkable overall."
" This one is just a classic lager!"
"O: A fairly easy drinking Lager with a slightly strange sour/musty character that I'm really not digging too much."
"Not too shabby, perhaps not rough but still pretty raw tasting. Worth a try though one was good enough for me."
"Sampled on July 17, 2011. It has a pale yellow pour which is a little cloudy and there is virtually no head or lacing. The aroma is moderately malty with a citrus zing backing it up. The overall weught of the body is around medium but there is a nice smooth feel to it. The taste tends to be on the bitter side with a light hopped balance. Likeable."
"overall, i was very pleased with this beer. not usually a huge fan of lagers, but this delivers tastes everyone can love, enough complexity to suit a beer geek such as myself, but still easily pounded by someone who enjoys swill. im definatly intrigued with what this brewery has to offer and hopefully i can find more of their beers."
"A good summer lager, and I am usually not a fan of this type of beer. It is refreshing and balanced."
"Deep golden in the light and on the verge of copper just looking at it on the table. A decent amount of light fluffy head at the start but dwindles down to just a thick ring around the edges. The aroma is earth and hay with a solid backbone of fresh milled grain. Flavor is light and tangy sweet, subtly toasted malt flavors and a earthy/grassy hop finish. A lot of carbonation on the back of your throat along with a slight metallic tingle right after you swallow. However, that gets covered up by the grassy hops. The finish is has a bitterness that creeps on you but is pleasant. Some lemon flavors are present right as finish begins. Smooth and light body with a strong hop/bitter finish."
"O - An overall decent offering. Clean flavors, easy to drink, and pretty tasty. Nothing that's going to knock your socks off, but well done."
"Overall a great beer if the weird grassiness was toned down. still pretty good stuff."
"A good summer beer perfect for thrist quenching."
"This is a winner for the style. Easy to drink and highly enjoyable. I'd prefer this over a macro."
"Clean-drinking, light-medium bodied (a definite helles lager trait, not pils) but strikes you with a delightful, uncommon dissonance."
"A decent stab at a lighter beer from a overhyped brewery that usually overstuffs its brews with fat Belgian traits whether they are appropriate or not. For a lager this is heavier, denser and maltier than I expected but it still felt buoyant. Not much aroma but decent flavors that are dominated by malt and a bit of bread. Not your average helles by any means."
"Fresh summer beer with little of the malt showing up on the taste. Mature hop bitterness in the swallow, lingers well. The body is quite light, naturally. Lots of spritz. A good beer for a hot day."
"Had a pint at Liberty St Tavern. I assumed this was a pilsner, based on the strong, spicy hop character. It's not overpowering, but provide a tasty balance to the mild toasty grains. The beer didn't have soft bready feel of a classic helles, but that doesn't really matter, this is a fine lager worth enjoying over the summer."
"This is an easy drinking, refreshing beer. Great for a hot summer day."
"Summer of Lager is a fantastic lager that comes in at just under 6 percent alcohol by volume and is full of flavor, while maintaining its balance and subtleties--as a good lager should. Definitely a must try for lagerheads or anyone wanting to try a solid interpretation of a German Munich Helles."
"My all-time favorite Cisco product! - I nice frothy white head greets you as you sip this golden colored brew with nice carbonation. Sweet bready-fruit aromas. Flavor is of sweet and tart grapefruit and biscuit malts. Wonderfully refreshing and delicious on a hot summer night!"
"More than happy with this beer, my first from Cisco. Not a textbook Helles, but still delicious, almost like a lighter Maibock."
"Grabbed a growler of this stuff last time I was on Island. At the ACBF after telling the Cisco rep that this was one of my favorites, he told me that this years was their best batch ever, lets see if they're right. Lager smell comes rushing out as soon as the growler is opened. Clear gold in color, with a finger of white heading. Husky, fresh grain and red grape skin become apparent in the nose. More fresh grains in the taste, with the malt showing a lot of character. The balance is quite nice between the malts and hops, though the malts come out on top, as they should. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and makes for a perfect Summer session lager. After having had this beer numerous times since I first reviewed it, I am certain that the original review was of a bad bottle. That being said, this is a brew that should be had fresh, so drink your bottle soon, or go to the brewery and enjoy."
"Everything in moderation here, good drinkable beer."
"D: Great beer to have at a barbecue, and definitely easy to have a few. Very tasty and refreshing."
"D-good for a summer day, not what I was expecting but glad I tried it"
"D - good. very refreshing. waited a while to have this one (picked up in July '09 and drank on 1/4/10) but it was still in good shape. would recommend getting after this soon after you pick it up."
"Overall, not too bad. the tartness of this one is a bit offsetting, and makes me take smaller sips than expected. I think this is probably a good brew for around the grill, or with hot weather fare. Not sure if I'd have this again. I don't hate it, but not unique or good enough for me to have this instead of something else."
"Drinkability: A very nice summer lager. Tastes very light in flavor like a wheat, but definitely a lager. Not for a hardcore lager lover, but great for a lighter wheatier taste."
"Drinkability: Not what I was expecting at all, as this tastes more like an ale rather than a lager; very unusual, but I rather enjoyed it"
"Notes from and tasted on: 03/12/08."
"D: I could drink this all day. A helluva lager."
"D - goes down smooth and easy."
"Pours a transparent light gold color, soapy-white head, and lots of sticky lacing. Crazy-active carbonation is putting on a show in the glass. Sort of a lemony/earthy quality to the nose on this beer, a little on the sour side. Taste is nice...a good, clean and moderately bitter hop presence. Maybe a tiny bit of green apple in the taste, too. Really good mouthfeel, bubbles almost feel ""cleansing", in a way. Goes down smooth. I like it. Not my favorite Cisco beer at all (and I'm a BIG fan!), but I'm glad I tried it, and it's worth checking out."
"Poured a hazy golden with a huge fluffy white head. Smells of lager yeast and wildflower honey as well as a hint of some Belgian yeast notes as well. The taste is quite interesting, with a lager yeast background but then strong notes of the wildflower honey as well. Floral, sweet, and slightly waxy. Some bitterneess at the end. Still picking up some Belgian notes of clove, banana, and candi sugar but it is only relatively faint. Mouthfeel is full and creamy. This was given to me by a bouncer after being confiscated at a concert, and it was quite a bit better than I thought it would be."
"Cheers!"
"drink on"
"Overall a very nice Munich Helles. Solid ABV and very drinkable. Not the ideal summer beer, but tasty nonetheless."
"Originally reviewed on June 2, 2006. 750 mL Bottle. Rich aroma as lemons and watermelons. Nice slightly tinged metallic floral hops. Tart and sweet aromaticity. Pour of elysian gold, with a rim of white. Flavor is heavily herbed, sweet golden malts, with sweet phenolics on the rested grains. Deliciate and lightly floral. Having trouble digging out the characters, but this is rich and nicely bodied for a generally lighter styled beer. Nice and clean, and exemplary for the style. Hints of lemon juice. White pepper cracked over. Wafts of epazote. Some light dryness, but hops really dont play too much. Great body. Light tinge of indiscriminate hops and a good fresh malt sweetness in the end. Corn syrup smack. Great."
"It seems more ale-ish than lager-ish. Maybe an alright summer beer, but if you're looking for a classic helles, this is not it."
"Drinkability: not bad, but a little too buttery for my tastes. Worth a look."
"Opened a 750ml bottle, no information on bottling or drink by dates. Poured a clear gold color with about 1 finger of head. Aroma was malt/yeast then a slight citrus note. I think I also picked up bananas and some other fruit. Starting to get a cold, so ability to smell could be broken at this time. Taste was a whack in the face with an orange. As I drank this moved to a more general citrus flavor, but it was far stronger than the aroma led me to expect. The mouthfeel didn't do a lot for me, in that I thought the carbonation was too much. The ""tingle"" interfered with the taste. Overall, I felt that this beer was too citrusy. Not bad, but not one I am going to seek out again."
"Drinkability - A little too sour for my liking. Doesn't make me dislike the beer, but doesn't make me want to drink that much of it. That's okay, as not every beer is meant to be enjoyed in quantity, although most lagers have better drinkability than this one."
"This pours a golden cloudy straw color with a huge foamy head. The smell is foral ,but very faint,just an average aroma. The taste is very crisp and refreshing.The flavors include fruit,some lemon,a slight hoppiness,with some malt.The m/f is light and well balanced.This is a nice beer for the summer,I only wish I had mine then."
"Ive been looking for this beer for a while and the fact that it came in 750s had somehow always eluded me, an helles in 750s? Aint that the way to go? Anyway, it is particularly beautiful to look at, the full carbonation is not as agressive as your average Cisco, but it obviously raises a mamooth of a white head with mountainous lacing and rockiness. The body is fully hazy, golden. Surprising sourdough and angel cake (first time I use this describor and coincidentally, I see my buddy Clark mentions it also) maltiness dancing up the nostrils along with strong lemony, grassy and floral saazy hops. Whereas the bready toasted malts are drier than youd expect despite slight honeyish hints, the hops kick in gracefully, unagressively. Medium bodied, rather crisp high carbonation. It doesnt get much more refreshing, could actually be world-class if it were not of the overly attenuative Cisco yeast strain that procures such high carbonation (though thats really okay here) and almost metallic (or more so battery alkalinity) dryness. Its too bad, because it is one of the rare strains I can think of that brings a natural acidity that I enjoy, it just gets a bit overdone most of the time. Drink it when youre in the mood for a tart, yeasty, sourdoughy lager and youre in for a treat."
"Good summer beer, goes well with some pizza."
"Hard to give good review numbers to this one. As a pseudo-wit it is very nice and pleasant to drink. I would not mind having a keg full of this around the house. On the other hand, it is not very lager-like at all, so there is some disappointment or suprise from that."
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light pale malt scent with a slight lemony zest and a dry lager yeast aroma. The taste is good. It has a light and fruity pale malt flavor with a tart finish. It is lemony and quite refreshing. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an excellent lager and a real summer time treat. It's the first beer I've had from these guys. I hope they're all this good."
"Carefully poured from a longstanding 750ml bottle, the Summer of Lager is a crystal-clear deep-gold with an orange-ish cast. It's frothy bright-white head holds exceptionally well, no doubt buoyed by the steadily streaming effervescent carbonation from below; and it leaves wide sheets of thin but solid lace about the glass. The nose is clean, bright and fresh just like summer, with notes of malt, cut-grass, and flowers. The body is medium with a dextrinous edge; and it's zesty and then creamy across the palate with a very fine-bubbled, natural (it's bottle-conditioned), effervescent carbonation. The flavor reveals a sweetish, slightly toasty and ""juicy"" malt (typical of Munich malt) that's laced with grassy, floral, and subtly spicy hops; and balanced by a low-key bitterness that's just enough to dry it in the finish leaving the palate refreshed and ready for another sip. It's rich without being satiating, and it's immensely drinkable. It's very well done, and the 6.25% alcohol is never noticeable! It's certainly worth trying, and probably one of Cisco's best beers!"
"Interesting raw beer here--and certainly the most un-lager-like lager I've had. However, they are clearly referring to their having ""lagered"" it over the winter bla bla bla.."
"A very refreshing beer to be enjoyed on the beach in the summer. Very drinkable and enjoyable, especially if you're into this style of lager. Since I'm not, this was a pleasant surprise."
"Generally an admirable American, craft ""light"" lager/pilsner, and nice to come across one that is not in the elevated-hop category."
"Initial reaction isn't that great. The more I drink, the more I like."
"The little yellow flower says it all, too bad it wasn't around in '69. A nice golden lager, with steady carbonation. A little hoppy with a very complex taste. Crisp would be an understatement. This is by far the best beer Cisco puts out in the summer, but I could not find it on tap on the island. I'll have to go back and continue my search...."
" Danke sehr VENOM for this wonderful sample."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a decent bone white head that sinks too quickly but does leave a nice lasting lace.  The aromas are all biscuity and toasted malt with just the barest hint of hops in the background.  Greaty toasty malt starts off the brew and pretty much carries it all the way through.  There is a decent hop presence that balances things very nicely without really showcasing the hops at all.  The toasty/biscuity malt of this brew gives it some good body but allows it to stay rather crisp and nicely refreshing as a summer beer should be.  This is one of the best summer brews that I have had, nicely complex without going to far, no lame lemony/wheat mix and very refreshing, all of these characteristics combine to make this brew very drinkable and very desireable."
