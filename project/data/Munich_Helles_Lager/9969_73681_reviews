"Update: I noticed that the on-tap reviews are coming in much higher than the bottles. I hope to review the on-tap version soon."

"this is a great representation of the style. Maybe one of the better Helles I have had outside of germany. don't care for much else they make but this one is very good"

"I'd certainly drink this one again. Pleasant and easy drinking."

"I guess if you're going to drink a blonde this is better than some, but I would drink it cold and fast. From the 12 oz bottle bought at H and H Beverages in Abilene."

"The mouth feel is excellent. Very crisp with medium carbonation and little evidence of bitterness or off flavors. This is an above average classic Munich Helles Lager. Rahr has brewed this one for years and it is a staple at my somewhat famous backyead BBQ's."

"Poured into a pint glass. Pours golden with a large, white head. A finger length of head is left after the head dissipates. A moderate amount of bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. The aroma is of bready and grainy and there is a mild floral scent. It's a pretty basic, but appealing scent. The taste follows the nose. The malts bring a nice bready and grainy flavor to the beer. There are some hops in the background which help balance the flavor of the beer. The body is light with adequate carbonation. The finish is crisp and clean. The drinkability is high. This is an excellent beer that I would drink again."

"Another solid brew from the Rahr's. This blonde lager has a gorgeous deep rich blonde color and a nice head when first pours, but it quickly dissipates. And like most of the Rahr brews has an incredibly smooth creamy texture. Has very crisp orange/lemon back notes."

"O: It isn't a bad beer; it's good, but it certainly isn't a beer that stands out. Would I drink it again? Yes. Would I go out of my way to get it? No."

"O: This is actually my first from Rahr. I am a bit biased in their favor because they are from Texas, however I do think this was a great beer. Not the best but a good one still."

"Poured out with a nice thick white and fluffy head and is very bubbly. Its body is a nice dark golden blonde and is pretty hazy with some mild carbonation. Its aroma is very citrusy; smells of orange, lemon and peach come through along with some wheat. This beer has some very good lacing! Its light and semi crisp on the tongue with an overall grainy flavor to it. There are some tart flavors when it hits the corners of your mouth and a slight malty aftertaste. Overall, this beer is very tasty, I look forwarding to drinking this one again."
