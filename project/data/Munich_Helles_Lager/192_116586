The nose comprises thick grass, mild greenery, and dry, flaky white bread. The taste brings in more of the same, the bread subduing the grass a bit, though not enough to take control of the situation (nor to actually achieve much of a character of its own, despite its best efforts). The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, not a bad little helles, really.

3.58,3.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, best before 9/21/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear pale straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light fruitiness, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light fruitiness, and yeast earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and light-moderate yeast ester flavors; with solid robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 5%. Overall this is a very solid Munich helles style. Well balanced pale malt, earthy hops, and light-moderate yeast ester flavors with solid robustness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering.","superspak","0"

Pale straw golden with a billowing pillow white head, fine speckled lacing left behind poured into a nonic pint glass not the best choice but I was pouring two bottles so it worked. Aroma has biscuit malts bread dough, hint of powdered yeast, slight citric grassy character, that's simple enough. Flavor is great clean refreshing bready malts, citric/grassy hop one, two combo. No fireworks just super pale, malts with flavor this is fancy white bread. Very enjoyable session beer don't expect much complexity just a malt driven lager with many positive attributes...I'm a fan of the light body pale color and tasty malt bill. I could use a tad more hops, but there are some nice herbal grassy characteristics going on. Overall, what a refreshing Summer Helles should definitely deliver...a thirst quenching characteristic lawnmower style beer.","WVbeergeek","May 26, 2014"

I expect to smell more breadiness and honey. Flavor works out a lot better. Way maltier than the smell would have you believe. There is a grainy character to it, but it isn't too overbearing.

This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, clean, not filling. but the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention, I think two would be my limit, i might get bored with it after that. What I like the most about this beer was the how true to style it was, it had most of the aspects that I expect from the style. What I like the least about this beer was the it was a little bland, I know this style doesn't have the most flavor, but this one seemed a little blander then some of the better Helles Lagers. I wouldn't buy this beer again, there's a few other sessionable lager that I would rather have, I don't know if I recommend it, but if you wanted an easy drinking beer I would say give it a shot. All in all i thought this was decent beer, there wasn't anything off or wrong with it and the it seemed to be pretty true to style so in my eyes this is a fairly solid example of the style.
