I'd guess it's got a degree or so more Plato to it, a touch more hops for flavor, and just a hint of additional bitterness to balance that as well - OR, is it the same beer and just slightly more fermented?

Not too much going on...a little sweet for what I like in a Helles. Pretty light bodied and easy to drink. I wish there was more depth to the maltiness and just a little more hop presence, but pretty good.

4.71,20.5,5,4,5,4.5,5,"Honestly until i came to Munich and had this beer, I was skeptical of the German Lager. Im an American and I love my overly hoppy IPAs. But after a few days in Munich drinking this beer, I realized that not all beer can be or should be filled to the top with hops. I have gotten a little annoyed with what I call ""hop race"" in America where all these beers are competing to be the happiest (im speaking generally). Anyways, I said all that to say that this beer is the perfect example of a German Lager and is almost perfect in every way. Its refreshing and I could drink it buy the liters. I tried the other big six breweries of Munich while there and this was my favorite. I love how its still independently owned and doesnt have to market itself. Everyone drinks this around Munich, but you wont find any advertisements. Sells itself.","MWilcox20","Nov 09, 2013"

I am also getting some malt, grain, and grassy and herbal aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet grain flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the flavors are a bit too sweet in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 06, 2013"

But for many others around the world who appreciate good beer, more moderate flavors are appealing. A quaffable, but very flavorful brew, one that can be enjoyed either in bulk or moderation is not a bad thing. I think sometimes many of us hold strong to our 'bigger is better/'more bang for the buck' attitudes and forget about the values of moderation, simplicity and subtleness.

A taste of limes and hint of minty herbs provide a very nice, clean and refreshing finish. An ever so faint fine vodka fuminess is noticeable. This is a world-class Lager and an excellent representation of the style.","BeerResearcher","Feb 03, 2005"

3.85,-1.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a pale straw color with a fluffy eggshell colored head. Doughy, hay-like, pale malt aromas, some German noble hops and a hint of musty yeast. Crisp and effervescent with a rich maltiness and a light astringency in the finish. Easy drinking and enjoyable. A slight bit heftier than your average helles.","crookedhalo","Oct 22, 2004"
2.92,-25.3,2.5,3,3,2.5,3,"Did not enjoy this beer any more than I would a Miller or Bud Light. Other than nice head retention, there were no appealing qualities in its looks. Received this as part of a Beer of the World's Mix pack and am not sure how long it may have been on the shelves. Tastes of sweet corn maltiness that got a little better as it lost some of its chill. Not recommended.","Backer2004","Oct 19, 2004"
4.32,10.5,4,4.5,4,4,5,"Great session beer. Poured into a pint glass it gave about a one inch head that dissapated fairly quickly. It has a clean, light golden color. It couldn't be any more drinkable. There is a light lemon undertone and simply tastes like a helles lager should.","swamiswamu","Jul 24, 2004"

3.82,-2.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Found this beer at the House of Gluntz here in Chicago. This place is, if I remember correctly (the original facility of) Chicago's first and oldest distributer (they have a great beer book by the way), dating back to 1888. They mostly have wine in the place, but when I asked for cold beer they pointed to a hidden little cooler that was busy chilling this here beer, a few awesome cheeses and a sprinkling of wine. Anyway, a cool part of local history. This here beer poured a simple buttery golden and sported a decent head and some lace-all retreated in a minute to a cup of yellow fizzy water. Aromas were decent for the style featuring fresh malty grain, as well as a lemony hop profile. the mouthfeel was nicely crisp, yet a trifle cloying. The beer does taste good, and is more complex than most for the style. Flavors run fairly deep as the generous grain notes give way to a fairly long hop component which rewards the taster with a cleansing bitter finish. This is a fine beer to start with, but it begs for a gear change after two.","moulefrite","Apr 22, 2004"
4.2,7.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Drinkability: I generally don't like light lagers of any kind. I can drink them and appreciate them, but I enjoy maltier, fuller-bodied brews. But this is a very nice beer. I see beer writers like Michael Jackson describe beers as ""soft"" and ""rounded," and I've always wondered what that means. I think this is a good example of both. It's a simple, yet sublime, beer.","Afterburner","Jan 11, 2004"

4.08,4.3,4,3.5,4,4,5,"Pale golden with a slight murk. Dense, uniform, pure white head leaves coating lace. Soft, doughy, underbaked cracker with sweetly herbal wafts of Hallertauer dominate the aroma. Hints of husky grain provide a dryish, rustic contrast. Flavorwise, it's a facsimile of the aroma. The dominant malt components are notes of sweet, white cracker, although subtle toasted notes abound. Mildly bittered, thus leaving a pleasant, gentle residual sweetness. Hop flavor is both grassy and herbal, with suggestions of mild, sweet basil. Lightly bodied overall, but gently dextrinous and smooth in mouthfeel. Becomes sweeter as it warms, with sugar cookie hints lingering agreeably. Finishes mostly clean, with a tinge of oxidation derived almond. A delicate, refined helles with superb drinkability. Potentially world class if found fresh. Is this on tap anywhere?","marc77","Mar 03, 2003"
3.85,-1.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"I tried this at the Augustiner Keller in Munchen. This is a refreshing helles with much character.

3.75,-4.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Maybe a bad bottle. Augustiner makes some excellent brews but this one was a bit off. Tart bitter not what one would expect from a Munich lager. The dates were fine and this was a beer actually drank and bought in Munich. Hoppy finish with little malt balance throughout the entire bottle, like I said must have been a bad bottle.","bierman2000","Oct 11, 2002"
3.85,-1.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This .5 L bottle poured a crisp-clear and quite a light yellow (paler than a golden-pils but deeper than many a mass-produced lager). Nice carbonation level provided a large white head starter, but quickly faded. Aroma was of sweet-beer but not pronounced. This beers very pale yellow color belies its actual taste: bold, malty goodness that is enjoyable, friendly to the tongue and drinkable. I imagine a beer like this must be brewed with some very fine home-grown Bavarian malts indeed. After drinking fair amounts of porters, stouts, dubbels, spiced beers and such, this is a beer original that will remind you of one single essence of beer: grain / barley malt.","Hobbz","Jun 13, 2002"

I could've stayed here a lot longer enjoying the friendly atomosphere, the people and the beer here. Edelstoff is actually an export version of the Helles. Golden, clear brew. Straw, grassy hop, biscuity aroma and flavor. Nice peppery hop, dry finish.","John","0"
