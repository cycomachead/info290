Why there aren't more American versions of Helles is beyond me.  This is not only an outstanding version of the style, but for $7.89 / six-pack it is also a great value.

Aroma was pretty ""lagery," sweet with bready malts, almost doughy, and some light floral hops. Taste of cereal grains, sweet, more of the bready malts from the aroma, light floral hops. A pretty basic lager. A bit bland and dull, no real crispness to it. Light body. I guess it was okay, if you like lagers, but I wasn't really digging it, and I wouldn't even call it a lawnmower beer.

The flavor has a more assertive grain flavor, light notes of dough with a strong citric bitterness. There is a lightly floral and grassy hop note accompanied by some tangy rye like grain in the finish. Really light, fluffy, and creamy feel with a medium syrupy body and crisp assertive carbonation.
