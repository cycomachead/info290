Generally fresh with biscuity german malt aromas and a touch of citrus lemon hop at the back end. Biscuity, malty flavors up front, and a spicy hop bite through the middle. Lemon hop bitterness from the middle to fhe finish. Finishes with a crisp, biscuity lemony hop bitterness.","IronLover","May 15, 2013"

No Glug, but more of a Blorp!, like emptying a CAN of food into a bowl or dish. I had a brief finger of bone-white head, but it quickly dissipated. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had the characteristic honey-like sweetness of good, adjunct-free lager. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was unmistakably lager with a light grassiness, thanks to the hops. Finish was mild, semi-sweet, very unobtrusive. Given its relatively low ABV and unimposing flavor, I CAN see why people would flock to this. It is certainly appropriate for the cooler and the CAN is a novelty, but I hope that it is not a coming trend.","woodychandler","May 04, 2013"

3.5,-4.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Transparent golden yellow with a thick creamy white head. The nose is lightly toasted grain with a touch of dough malt balanced by a fairly assertive citric hop in the back with a grassy, earthy grain lingering in the back. The flavor has a more assertive grain flavor, light notes of dough with a strong citric bitterness. There is a lightly floral and grassy hop note accompanied by some tangy rye like grain in the finish. Really light, fluffy, and creamy feel with a medium syrupy body and crisp assertive carbonation. The beer is balanced and smooth, light and crisp. Nice stuff, stronger on the grain side than I love but still very enjoyable.","cpetrone84","Nov 17, 2011"
