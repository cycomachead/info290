I am a bit disappointed that the beer was slightly skunky, considering that this is one of the most famous beers in the entire world. I can't imagine what this beer would taste like on tap, but is still good from the bottle. My only advice to the Hofbrauhaus is to import your beer in dark bottles - you should know better. Otherwise, I'm glad I tried it and I would drink it everyday if I didn't have to pay over $11 for an 11.2 ounce six pack.","Kelby777","Mar 20, 2015"

4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"500 ml bottle into lager glass, bottled on 3/26/2013. Pours crystal clear golden straw color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of light lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, straw, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of light lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, straw, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light lemon, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, straw, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester flavors; with a very clean flavor profile and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and clean mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Helles style. All around good balance and robustness of clean pale malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 28, 2014"

4.01,5.8,4.25,3.75,4,4,4.25,"Final Grade: 4.01 even, an impressive A-. The Germans are the masters of lagerdom, and Hofbräu Original is yet another testament to this fact. This is an outstanding Munich lager that could easily become a staple - if it became readily available locally, at least. Until then, I'll probably just stick with other imports, but as far as this style goes, I do believe I've finally found a new favourite to displace the venerable (and ubiquitous) Spaten. A wonderful continental lager that should appeal to not only BAs, but beer drinkers in general - grab one while it's available.","thehyperduck","Jun 20, 2014"

Dense to watery texture. Subtle spicy & grainy flavors in the middle. Funny & sparkling palate. Low hoppiness resolves in a long bitter/sweet finish. No flat, no fat, but clean bitter beer.

4.03,6.3,3.75,3.75,4.25,4,4,"Poured from the bottle into a flute. A lighten golden yellow brew with a massive white head, immediately making its presence known via a pleasant noble hop spice and sweet doughy malts on the nose, a touch of vinous fruit as well. Good head retention. Palate is dominated by clean pale malts (with a hint of pancake), only faintly sweet, with hints of lemon rind, licorice, hay, cinnamon, and strawberry candy. Clean and crisp, with an uber-smooth mouthfeel and soft carbonation. Damn near perfect helles lager except for a little skunk and metal in the dry spicy finish. Less sweet and more malty than other commercial examples with a complex array of German hop flavors that of course do not overwhelm what is essentially a malt showcase. Not hard to find and well worth it if you wish to experience a classic helles flavor.","CalgaryFMC","Mar 09, 2014"

Huge skunky aromas as soon as I pop the cap and pour into the glass. Luckily those dissipate rather quickly revealing a pleasant bready decocted pilsner malt aroma with a hint of floral earthy hop. The flavor is rich melanoid and pilsner malt with just enough earthy hop flavor to provide some balance. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick almost sweet mouthfeel. Decent Helles, I've have had better, but I could drink this.","johnnnniee","Jan 15, 2014"

Light sweet grain, doughy malt., a touch of floral and some fresh cut grass and wet hay. Crisp and light on the palate with just enough bubbles to tickle the tongue. Wet grassy flavor in the middle and drinks so easily and refreshing. The noble hops are so light they engage the palate effortlessly as the lightly sweet grain kisses the drink as a faint little bitter leaves you wanting more. Truly motivating. Simply outstanding.

Aroma is sweet with notes of bread and maybe green apple (there's a certain tart feeling to it). The taste is very malt forward, with the same flavors as the aroma and a nice hit of hop bitterness on the finish. There is slightest bit of carbonation and the mouthfeel is a little bit thin and both a really quite nice. A great German lager, simple and well made.","delta490","Apr 18, 2013"

Poured a clear pale golden color, produced a thick white head, excellent retention and left a nice amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is full of malted barley, fresh cut grass and floral hops. Light in body, this Helles is full of malted barley, fresh baked bread, and a hit of hops at the finish. Clean, crisp, refreshing and this is even better on Tap I have had the privilege of drinking this fresh at Hofbrauhaus in Munich, while i would say it was much better in person on tap- I enjoyed this bottled version very much.

The body is quite light, with a very light moderate carbonation, a nearly watery feel, and a crisp finish.

The malt is again very evident on the palate, with quite a bit of grainy character. Bittering hops are there to balance it quite well. Really refreshing.

In glass, has a great golden color and a huge head, which eventually settles down. Aroma has a nice smooth malt note. Taste is clean, while having an excellent malt and hop balance, and goes great with whatever German dish I'm having at the time (or is good just on it's own). I can't comment on the 12 oz. green glass bottles (the 500 mls are brown). I've read bad reviews for that serving, but can't comment on them as I just prefer having it on tap thru the restaurant.

The flavor is not over the top at any point, exceptional balance between malt and not too outragous amount of hops, but the hops are the dominant flavor. This beer is not trying to grab your attention; it's a classic case of less is more. This is one beer everyone should have on tap to understand the style and intention of the beer.

Thats not the case here; you will actually be wowed at the fact of how a simple beer can be so great. Mouthfeel is smooth and watery, refreshing and light.

Poured a crystal clear rich golden straw with a delectible 4 finger head that had the consistency of clingy marangue. Smelled of noble hop (possibly Tettnanger) a non-descript sweet, and perhaps some grain. Medium-light body. Tastes sweet with some hop character. The sweet is mildly grainy, but clear and clean of fruit, with a possible tiny hint of tannic. There is a small bit of metallic to the hop.

3.7,-2.4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"A bit more golden in color than the light. Another faint, off-white fizzy head. Lots of freshly mown hay, grass, and other grainy smells. Some hops fade in and out. Good crisp lager flavors. Definitly some more toasted qualities to it. Light snappy hop kick, warms at times. Freshly mown hay again, some slight herbals as well. Light bodied, not much to it, easy to drink, but very tasty. Refreshing crisp, traditional lager. I think this would be great with a nice grilled bratwurst and saurkraut.","StevieW","Sep 20, 2003"
4.35,14.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"It pours with a nice straw-colored liquid and thick frothy white head. The aroma is nice and yeasty, with some nice hops and malt undertones. The beer is nicely carbonated, which gives a nice bite to the taste, complementing the good grainy lager taste and mild hops bitterness. Very clean tasting, with a nice light mouthfeel. Very, very drinkable.","kaszeta","Sep 14, 2003"
3.46,-8.7,4,3,3.5,3,4,"Clean crisp lager with an extremely fresh taste. Nice medium golden color with a decent white head. Not much aroma, a bit of malt and a bit of hops.

3.6,-5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"A very good lager beer brewed on the original Munich recipe. The body is a beautiful clear gold with a small white head and plenty of lacing. The nose is all lager giving hints of malt and the balancing hops. Nicely flavored, this beer provides a delicately balanced flavor perfectly poised between its sweet and bitter sides. Very drinkable and thirst quenching, my drinking companion was downing these like water, though he did show signs of getting quite swacked.","AtLagerHeads","Jun 16, 2003"

3.54,-6.6,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Brilliantly clear dark straw hue. Fluffy, thick, well retained porcelain white head leaves lace. The aroma is comprised of a lemony, lightly grassy Tettanger hop nose, along with softly sweet, grainy malt with a tinge of husk. Bready, white cracker like sweetness upfront in flavor is followed by a combination of mild, non astringent grain husk and soft, almost airy hop bitterness. Subdued grassy, vegetal hop adds an earthy tone and couples with the grainy malt presence to lend an impression of rustic, hay like sweetness mid palate. Lightly bodied, but with supple dextrins faciltating a smooth, agreeably inobtrusive mouthfeel. Finishes with a tinge of honeyish must and underbaked dough, but otherwise clean and dry. Balanced, innocuous and quaffable in its current state-- Could be an outstanding helles if sampled at the source of found fresh. Soft and tasty.","marc77","Jun 02, 2003"
3.58,-5.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"I had this on tap at the Hofbrauhaus Newport served in a .5L mug. The color is a typical golden lager color with a finger of head and lots of lacing left on the glass. The smell is a little weak, just a faint hint of hops. The taste is a pretty good balance of piney sweetness and hops. The mouthfeel is fairly ok, and the drinkability is good. Pretty good for a run-of-the-mill lager.","SheepNutz","May 31, 2003"
3.8,0.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Noticeably more body on the front side of the taste, a more solid mouthfeel, as it should. Hop presence about the same, fairly detectable and in pretty good balance with the beer style. Definitely more personality in this beer, and I do perceive a taste in there that could be interpreted as skunkyish. I can see where that characteristic comes from now. Not offensive, I just noticed it. A very drinkable session beer.","brewdlyhooked13","May 29, 2003"

2.7,-28.8,3,3,2.5,3,2.5,"This is probably one of the worst examples of German beer I've had recently and the fact that it was a freebee from the store owner where I bought a case of good beers from didn't help any. It was probably old to begin with and so this may not be a fair review but then few have given it a decent rating here. Looks promising in trhe glass but the flavor is not of a good lager. Kind of flat tasting with little character. Almost reminds me of some basic American lagers in that respect. Slightly bitter and with an unpleasant aftertaste.","BierReise","May 16, 2003"

Nose is sweet malts and grains blended with some strong notes of herbal and perfumey hops. Light to medium in body with a very smooth texture. Taste starts off sweet with notes of malt and fresh grain as well as some biscuity flavors. This is followed by some astringent husk flavors and a good amount of bitter hops leading to a dry finish. An enjoyable lager and a nice choice for a hot day.","Morris729","Apr 25, 2003"
3.42,-9.8,3.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,"There's an interesting flowery element to a sweet, grainy nose. The front is sweetish, lagery. Apples in the middle give way to a lagery bitter finish. There's a little alcohol evident in the bitter, grainy aftertaste. This is ok, not better than that.","kbub6f","Mar 31, 2003"
3.2,-15.6,3,3,3,3,4,"It's a very drinkable and unexciting German pale lager. Pours pale of course, the head diminishes to nothing too quickly. Some hops and a little sweetness in the aroma. Mouthfeel is watery thin and crisp, with some hops coming through in a the flavor a little bit, as well as some skunkiness. The skunkiness was very small though, just a hint. Pretty refreshing qualities here, a solid lager that's good for the summer.","AudioGilz","Mar 11, 2003"

There is still a healthy complement of astringency, only this time the malt element is smooth and honeyed underneath. Not a delicately styled lager; it is wildly doughy and aromatic with massive, chewy suggestions of freshly cracked grain. No trace of dilution in this one.","putnam","Nov 11, 2002"

The klink of the liter sized mug against the tap of the oak barrel...music to my ears.

Very powerful hops aroma that I could smell from almost two feet away.  Light refreshing beer with a bitter hop bite.
