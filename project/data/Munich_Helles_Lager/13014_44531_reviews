"Expected more from Surly, not one of their"

"Perfect summery type beer,  good head, lite in color."

"O- a nice interpretation of the style"

"Sweet Corn bread. Very smooth, perfect yard work beer. Fantastic"
""

"It's OK.  Just not my favorite style."

"It's right on what I expect a Helles Lager to be."
""
""
"Clear golden body with an inch of white head. Aromas of fruity esters, corn, lager yeast. Light and fruity. Mild sweetness finishing with a dash of hop bitterness. Easy drinking. Solid."
""
"Good light pale ale. No happy after taste."
"I like it: perfect for grilling, or a late-night session when one just needs a little refreshment.  Is it superb?  No—but it is supremely drinkable, as promised, and light without sacrificing substance: truly lagerly without ever falling into heavy fruitiness."

""
""
""

"Not Surly's most unique beer, but a well-done sessionable drinker."

"Poured into a pokal a clear somewhat dull lighter golden with a nice thick white crown atop.All malts in the nose with a tinge of iron,just a faint leafy hop aroma is detected.Smooth and drinkable with toasted malts  standing out,went well with some pork shanks and kraut last night."
"Straw in color, and a decent off-white head; Nice nose of bready pilsner malt, faint grassy notes, something a bit floral too; taste follows the nose, with the bready biscuity taste even more pronounced.  This is a great summer brew, and a refreshing break from the intensely hopped ales I'm often pulled towards.  I don't have access to enough good helles or zwickels to be sure about how this holds up against the best in class, but this is miles better than the macro lagers."

"interesting.... like a typical American crap commercial brew, but with a twist. slight resin-y hops in the background, a fresher and cleaner build on the malts compared to, say, a coors, but still a little bit of piss-water taste. but that's not always bad, particularly on a warm summer day after mowing the lawn. just not NOW or TODAY after a Mastermind and a Zombie Dust, I suppose.... it kind of takes me back to my local bar/cantina late at night looking for some ugly hooch for a quick bed.....  I've heard great things about Surly. it's a shame this is my first go at one of their brews...."

"Another Surly first for me thanks to my main man Vdubb.  This stuff pours a slightly hazy straw topped by a finger or so of lightly off-white foam.  The nose comprises light grass, mild biscuit, light dried honey, mild flowers, and the faintest notion of hard water.  The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger contingent of both grass and flowers.  If I didn't know any better, I'd say this was an American take on a Czech pils, rather than a helles lager.  Whatever.  The body is fairly light, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel.  Overall, an enjoyable drink, no matter the style."

"The Surly Hell is ok....nothing spectacular in my humble opinion. The beer poured a clear golden with thin white head that is not leaving much of a lace. The scent is very faint if at all...maybe some bittering hops. The taste has biscuit with touches of grass and peat. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall this is a good session beer."
""
""
""
"O- This is a nice sessionable beer that is clean with good malt character. More full that a typical German Munich Helles but just as nice. However after drinking a 16 oz can of this I fell like had just eaten a meal."

"D: Very drinkable with some delicate flavors built around a base of Pilsner malts. I am no expert on this particular style but I found Surly Hells Lager to be utterly refreshing to drink. This beer is the reason why I need to check out more Lagers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: A masterfully executed brew and has single handedly rejuvenated my love for lagers. Great lagers seem to be few and hard between in the American craft seen, but this one is a must try."

"O - good easy drinking refreshing lager, but I prefer an authentic German Munich Helles, especially at this price point ($10.99 for 4 cans)."
"O - Super drinkable, I could drink this all the time."
"A very different Helles, missing lots of the bakery malt action, and almost comes off as a crisp Czech like pilsner with more yeast like punch."
""
""
""
"a very good lager from surly, pale and bright in color with a dish soap frothy looking head, but this may be best consumed right from the can. nose of german pilsener malts and light vegetal hops, more czech in aroma than german or american, but its tough to tell through the cereal heavy smell of it all. tough to pick out lager yeast too, as even in taste this is not as clean as more traditional versions. bready pils malt up front in taste, dense and hearty yet i find this impossibly easy to drink. hops just bitter, very little real flavor coming from them, but their contribution is critical. i almost get some oats or something slightly sweeter and fuller bodied here. the body on this is large and the carbonation gives it a pillowy mouthfeel not usually associated with this style. it really makes it for me, luxurious and creamy are not lager words, so props to surly for making that association for the first time for me. not their most epic work, but a darn good daily drink here."
""
"Hell pours a golden straw color with a small head. There is a slightly stale, and very sweet aroma; very crisp. The taste is on the lighter side, a nice sweetness, crisp light malt flavors; very refreshing. Nice feel, good carbonation, but lighter flavor. Overall its a very refreshing, and tasty beer, would be great for the summer."
""
"I know I'm in the minority when I say this, but this is my overall favorite Surly Beer. The taste is full, without being overpowering. The after taste has what they call a bread like flavor, and to me it goes well with anything from Pizza, to Steak, an absolute winner!! This is a Beer I could have everyday. If only Surly could bring the price down a buck or so."

"Whether or not this is a tribute to helles lager or a Dortmunder, it's very curious to see more ""definitive"" American breweries (known for fruity, intense hop profiles and the classic 2-row caramel malt flavor) brewing THESE kinds of lagers when they are switching up their game from brewing ales. I tend to prefer lagers that are a bit more balanced, with an emphasis on the classic toffee malt/spicy and grassy hop profile, but I suppose this is a good change of pace for the brewery. This isn't a style that always leads to great things, and in this case, nothing is wrong with it. I'd love to have it fresh on tap someday, however, as I feel many of nuances that seem lost in this can would be far more present."

"Pours a hazy straw gold capped by a bright white head, great retention. Plenty of grain and yeast on the nose. Bready lager yeast and herbal hops upfront, very light fruit accent. Finishes with bread crust and light honey notes. Light and crisp body, fairly smooth. Lively carbonation. Wonderful zwickel, very drinkable and a great pairing with almost anything."

"Clean and smooth, light apple and crackers, very mild grassy bitterness. Soft supple finish, clean and dry, well carbonated and not at all watery. This is a great Helles, very traditional and tasty when fresh, tailor made for warm weather in the Biergarten."

"A fine lager by the folks at Surly."
""
""

""
""
""
""
"O: A very drinkable that pairs well with pizza and is sure to please the average BMC drinker but give the craft beer guy something to work with. Not something i'd get regularly but solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Light in body and high carbonation this is a very refreshing lager, and quite damn tasty as well!"

"Overall – 4 – Great lager, better than the other AALs. Goes down like water"

"O - Very nice take on Munich Helles Lager. I enjoyed it on a 90 degree day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Superb drinkability, no doubt. I love a good helles lager, and one in a can, no less. This beer exhibits cosmos-level balance in the fact that it would be acceptable to BMC drinkers looking to turn to craft, while also being an excellent rendition of the style it represents, pleasing even people who have been in the game for while now. Far better than many of the other craft helles beers available in my area - why can't Surly extend their reach just a few states east?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A pleasant, very drinkable lager. I could easily have a few of these back to back. Not particuLarly complex or mysterious, just solid and consistent."
""
"O: Very much true to the style; I really enjoyed drinking this beer for it's light qualities and flavor. This is a great beer for summer because you can drink a large quantity and not feel bloated. I can definitely see myself drinking this beer during an all day tube float down the Quadalupe River in Austin."
""
"Very enjoyable lager.. I am starting to enjoy craft lagers and this is most certainly a very good one. Very refreshing and not off-putting at all."
""
""
""
"Pours a pale yellow into an Imperial pint with about an inch of soft white head, moderate lacing. Smells very bready and sweet, with a hint of spice and citrus hops. Taste is very clean, predominantly bready/crackers with subtle notes of spicy noble hops and citrus. Finishes dry, very little linger. Light mouthfeel, very clean with a fair amount of carbonation. Very drinkable. This is an excellent lager, although I tend to prefer ales. An excellent sessionable brew, very clean and easy drinking, plenty of flavor but light enough to have a few and not feel filled up."

"Pours a straw yellow color, slight bit of unfiltered haze. Golden liquid is topped by half an inch of white head. Smell has a slight, grainy sweetness with just enough hop presence. Grassy and a bit herbal. Taste is very similar to the aroma, no suprises, just a crisp refreshing beer. Mouthfeel is light, crisp, dry-ish finish. Very drinkable, would pair well with most meals, and still great on its own."
""
""
""
"My recommendation: A great beer for the style, extremely drinkable. Surly continues to do things and if you can get up north to Minnesota to get some, buy a bunch, or order from france44.com."

"The beer is medium bodied with carbonation that is of medium intensity and feels ""big"" on the tongue. This creates a fairly full mouthfeel with some foamy nuances. Closes semi-dry, with little residual stickiness on the palate."
""
"O: I'll likely never drink this again. But, it seems to be a decent example of a beer style I don't care for."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In some ways, the mouthfeel is simple and clean, but it really has some delicate and appropriate touches and nuances. There's a little floral non hopped aspect, like some kind of literal flower petal in there, mild pepper notes, etc. . . Its kind of like an episode of the Simpsons, it can work on different levels, be it the simple punch in the crotch laugh or something a little more high brow at the same time (example, Duffman proclaiming in court while being sued by Duff Brewery for intellectual property violations: ""Ever heard of 'Fair Use'? (hip thrust, OOOOHH Yeah)."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a really good lager. Well done by Surly!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear golden color with a medium white head. Scent is somewhat citrusy with a grainy aroma. Light hop aroma...very light. Probably the least appealing Surly beer I've tried (aroma-wise). Taste is a little bit better. Nice, light blend of hops, grain, malt, and lemon. Very light and easy-drinking. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Drinkability is high. Overall, this beer does not have a lot going on. I could see this one being very user friendly to BMC drinkers. It is very refreshing and decent for the style of beer it is. Not my favorite Surly beer."

"Almost like a pilsner, I think this is more of a wannabe oktoberfest. Poured with a rich white head and had a golden wheat colored body. Picked up from the mid-west, a standard pilsner style beer, not too much to write home about but not the shittiest beer I've ever had. Supposed to be a reminder of Germany, but I have had better."

"Thanks to fLax for this one!"
""
""
"O: Solid example of the style, though nothing exceptional. Fairly drinkable, and will satiate any lager craving."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer tastes somewhat like a pale lager but has a lot more flavors due to its unfiltered nature. It's relatively easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I don't think this beer stands out like several of Surly's other offerings. I'm glad I tried it, but I'd probably pass in the future."
"This poured out looking like liquid gold, it was very nice looking. It was a very clear looking yellowish gold color with a nice solid white head on top. The retention and lacing on this beer was quite nice and rather impressive for a beer of this style. The smell of of the beer is a little on the yeast side with some subtle hops aromas and malt sweetness. The taste of the beer is malty with a strong hop bitter finish, some lighter notes of grain and bread in there. Not overly grassy which I was happy about. The mouthfeel is clean and crisp, it's sharp feeling too, good carbonation and body. Overall this is a good brew, not my favorite style but it goes down really easy and could be enjoyed anytime."
"O: Very enjoyable and super easy to drink - I would recommend this beer to others. Good flavors and aromas, definitely sessionable."
""
"Overall - It's simplicity allows each flavor to really stand out and flourish and it's just so damned easy to drink. Just recently it was announced that this would be a year round offering, which is good because I will be having this quite often from now on."
"O) Nice Lager right here... Certainly enough flavor and body to separate itself from the run of the mill offerings. Glad to recommend..."
"Easy drinking lager with some actual flavor, excellent on a hot summer's day. Loses points for being expensive, if it were somehow cheaper I would be drinking it consistently."
"It is very easy to drink and the beer highlight of my recent visit to the Cities."
""
""
""

""
""

"Drinkability: I like it. It is a simple and refreshing lager that offers a nice and subtle complexity."
""
"O - A fine lager indeed. Well-worth seeking out."
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Really nice Zwickel. Really smooth and well balanced and finishes really clean."
""
""
"16 oz can poured into SA sensory glass. Appearance is straw colored with a faint amount of haze. Dense white head forms and retains well, considerable amount of lacing left behind. The nose starts with lemon and bread. The bready component features notes of wheat and yeast and gives a biscuit like quality to the aroma. Light herbal hops make a presence at the finish paired with mellow lager yeast. The taste starts with mellow malty sweetness, notes of lemon, grain, and corn. This is followed by huge bready dryness that off sets the mellow sweetness and provides a great balance. The finish features one last wave of lemon zest. Tons of delicate flavors here balanced terrifically. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. This is a terrific lager, definitely worth seeking out, even for the ale heads."
"this is a great summer beer, crisp, good body, flavorful."
""
""
"This beer has a decent taste, although to much of the light corn syrupy taste for me, other than that some goodness going on here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: I was expecting not to be impressed by this offering from Surly. Lagers and wheat beers in general don't usually keep my attention this long. Would pair amazingly with backyard BBQ fare. It's light enough to go down easy with a hamburger, and just complex enough to stand on it's own. Will be seeking this one out in the future, especially as a session beer."
""
""
"Hell yes! This bad boy's been on my wants for a very long time, huge thanks to Corbet. This one pours out a vibrant golden color with a large head. The aroma is light and grainy, with some hops and breadiness. Awww yeah. This hits the tongue with the perfect lager crispness, there's a perfectly balanced bit of sweet bready and grainy maltiness, along with a bit of slightly bitter, floral hops. The mouthfeel is light and briskly carbonated, and the drinkability is very good. Everything is in balance here. It's just a perfectly smooth, balanced, and delicious lager."
""
"This is a very good German-style lager. It tastes fresh and crisp, has a beautiful malt backbone, and only a flirtation with hops. I have nothing to complain about with this beer, it is up to the standards of having ""Surly"" on it's label."
""
""
"Very light and crisp, kind of like a wheat lager. Sweetness isnt too much. Its definitely sweet, but its crisp enough not to make it syrupy. Maybe its the style, but its so light and smooth, yet finishes clean with just a hint of grassy sweetness."
""
""
"O: I've had tons of lagers, and only lagers before I got to the US many years ago, and this is a top-notch one. Not as aggressive as a Czech, not quite like most Germans. Very refined and clean."
""
""
"O. These styles are very challenging for me because they don't distinguish between each other that much. Frankly, this drinks like a pilsner with a little extra yeast and a little less hop bite. It's mellow, grainy, and well-rounded. For a low ABV summer sipper, this is great."
""
""
"A big thank you goes out to cpolking for sending me this beer. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Pours a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sweet, malty. Taste is good, bready, malts, somewhat sweet, very refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a great summertime beer."
"A very good take on a very underrated style from Surly. Great summer beer."
"Overall --- when the weather warms up during the year, this is the style I look for and Surly did a great job with their take on it… I will be coming back for more and more! I am thankful to live in the Twin Cities, where this is a fairly accessible beer in the liquor stores out here. I may not be the biggest fan of Surly’s year-round line up, but they hit some real home-runs with their seasonals"
""
"O-One of the better Summer beers I've had and one of the better pale lagers I've had. Good job Surly."
""
""
"Anyway, it's quite simple and clean in its flavors but the finish is more sweet than it is dry. Light body and high carbonation works. Refreshing and a good summer beer on all counts. At the same time not the best summer beer... I would reach for a Pilsner first that I think Surly should totally brew!"
"Nothing memorable. No noticeable standout flavors or scents, a typical light Lager."
""
""
""
"Very easy drinking; wish I would have bought more of this one considering the hot streak we're having currently."
""
""
""
"O: decent beer, don't even know what Keller bier/ Zwickel bier is, but it's pretty good for a light colored lager. Not complex, but fine. Like your haircut is fine."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- wow, surly does no wrong! Hell is just as good as a prima pils to me. So drinkable that I don't know what to say other than I could drink these non stop! Surly is amazing"
""
"O: B+ (solely because it isn't a style that I really care for)."
"Drinks like a good outdoor summer beer. This might be a candidate for my Bonnaroo beer in a few weeks. Crisp, clean with subtle hops and mild malts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I liked this beer but it doesn't carry all of the traditional qualities of the style. I don't like the American hopping like in their other beers -- it just doesn't fit that well. All in all though, this is still a drinkable, enjoyable beer."
""
""
"O: Overall a pretty decent beer for the style, but I'm just not a big fan of lagers. I realize the Keller Bier/Zwickel Bier is a style of its own, but I am generalizing my thoughts here. Nice to drink out of a can though!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For maximum cheesiness, I drank this while watching Hellboy and frequently asked myself, ""What the hell is a Keller Bier / Zwickel Bier?"" Good times. This was good, but it wasn't particularly remarkable. If I could get this, I probably would drink it again - with food."

"O: A good lager that's refreshing and easy to drink. The style has personally never done much for me but, as always, Surly makes a valiant effort."
"O: Sorry folks, I'm just not a fan of lagers. This is definitely better than most, but that's not saying much - just take a look at the scores I gave it. If you like lagers, I'm sure you'll dig this...but I think there are significantly better beers on the market by this brewery."
"Beats the hell out of BMC for that nice easy drinking beer."
"O- Pretty good pilsner like beer. Went down very well with some pizza."
"O - This is a pretty good beer thats easy to drink the taste is smooth and refreshing that keeps me coming back for more overall worth picking up if you have the chance"
"Overall: This one is pretty drinkable, as the can conveys. I could see the sweetness, though, getting to be a bit too much after a can or two. I would enjoy this one more if the sweetness were turned down a notch, and if more hops were thrown in. Not a bad one, just not my style."
"Overall this is a nice and well made lager. Refreshing and very drinkable. Another very good Surly brew."
"Lightly toasted grains up front, tailed by spicy, peppery hop bitterness (light). Bready, cracker-y malt fills up the palate, with a sweetish honey edge. Doughy malts and slight mineral water bitterness into the finish. Finish is dry, with some snappy, peppery bitterness and lingering sweetbread malts. Moderate to light body, with a crisp, lively feel (but not seltzer-y). A very tasty, easy drinking lager."
"O- overall a pleasant beer, better suited for summer than October, but this paired nicely with an 80+ degree day. Worth buying if you're in surly's distribution area, but nothing special and not worth hunting for."
"Overall - I was amazed at how much I liked this. I usually don't like lagers, but I could drink this for hours."
"Pleasantly surprised, this is quite the lager. They don't get the credit or attention they deserve, but there is still nothing harder to do than brew a great lager. Surly has done that here with Hell, I for one would like to give them props for that. Nice work guys."
"D: Not my preferred Surly but it really shows their versatility. Nice lighter brew."
"Pretty light gold. Crystal clear. Lots of visible carbonation. Good sized and very persistent head. Smell is grassy hops and a little light malt. Taste is biscuity light malt. Pleasant sweetness. Herbal hops. Nicely balanced. Medium to full bodied. Well carbonated. Very easily drinkable. Very solid beer overall."
"O - I'm not that familiar with the style, but I really enjoyed this. Nice flavor, not overpowering in any way."
"Tasty stuff.Straw colour. Fresh, hopped light and tasty. Great drinkability, although so dainty that the carbonation, though not aggressive, is obtrusive.Moderate citrus.Thanks John for bringing back. Something that I can drink pint after pint of.Spot on."
"Overall: Hoping this sticks around the shelves for a while because I would make this a staple beer even at the around $11 per 4 pack of 16 oz. cans that it costs."
"The mouthfeel is light bodied, high carbonation and just works great. Overall, this is a nice, sessionable brew. I've had better, but this is something that works great for MNF, and I'll be finishing off the 4 pack next weekend for college football."
"Overall-First beer of the style so I'm not going to go crazy. However, this is definitely a top 5 session beer that I would drink If I could access it, but I can't. bummer."
"O - An enjoyable lager, to say the least. Very easy to drink and a great way to start the 2011 NFL season. This would be the beer to tail gate with, no doubt about it. Recommend."
"o - nice offering and very refreshing."
"D/O: This does not seem like a beer that should fatigue the palate, yet it does so in capable fashion. The taste is authentic, losing some refreshment to the boldness of the early flavors and even more to the harsh burn of acidity. In its defense, it would probably go down more easily in the presence of savory food."
"Pretty drinkable, but to be honest a bit of a let down. So far Surly's German iterations ( the few I've tried ) haven't wowed me. I would happily take St Geargen Brau or Bischof Keller bier over this any day. Was looking for a bit more fruittyness. I could drink this all day, but do not se it as a bencmark for the style by any any means."
"The lightness and finish lends drinkability; the soft hops and smooth fruits flavors make it tasty. I'd call this more of a helles that a zwickel/keller, and would love to see this in my Mass anytime."
"Nice session lager, very light and easy to drink yet it has enough flavor to keep you interested and coming back."
"This is a light bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is crisp on the finish which encourages you to continue with the consumption and the alcohol is fairly well integrated for 5% with a light warmth down the back of the throat. Overall this is a fantastic take on the style, very well done. This is not a style of beer I reach for often but if this was readily available for me, I would drink it quite frequently throughout the summer."
"Light and zesty. Cereal grains, fresh baked bread, flakey buttermilk biscuits, noble hops, earthy and herbal, with a slight floral quality in the finish. A nice flavor to this helles. However the body is a bit off. Lacking in cabonation leaves things watery, need more zip."
"Ahh, and the more I sip, the more Pils flavours shine on in. I love this brew!"
"Note: I don't have any qualms with beers being canned opposed to being bottled, but the design on the can is not alluring to me at all. TenFidy, an amazing beer from Oskar Blues, is canned, yet has a design that doesn't reek of FourLoko or another cheap energy drink/alcohol hybrid. Not that this has anything to do with the beer itself, it's just a note."
"Hell pours a slightly cloudy goldenrod color, lightening to straw in places when held directly to light. There's close to two fingers of white foam crowning the beer, and it shows moderate head retention and lacing. The nose is redolent of freshly baked white bread and crackers, with a hint of delicate spiciness from the Sterling hops. The flavor is a carbon copy of the nose, there's really not much too add. Everything comes across very crisp, and there's a nice balance between all the flavors. The body is firm for a sub 5% beer, and the carbonation has just a little bit of kick in it to keep things interesting. I really enjoyed my can of Hell, it's got a great combination of good flavor and being very easy drinking. I can see myself buying this in bulk to go along with Allagash White as my go to beers next summer."
"Enjoy!"
"O- A very solid beer. Other than the lackluster appearance, this is one of my favorite lagers. So drinkable. Flavorful, but not at all fatiguing."
"Cheers!"
"Taste is grainy, light and fresh. This reminds me more of a Helles Lager than a Zwickel...the yeast is just not there. Hops provide a nice bittering, clean finish and the beer is very drinkable but I am surprised that both of the German imports Ive sampled in this style were tastier than this. I think Surly is one of the best breweries in the country, but this one just does not really do it for me."
"O: This is my first Surly offering and I really liked this lager. It was very well balanced lager and I liked the traditional aspects about it. Good work Surly, now I'm ready for some more."
"O: A really enjoyable lager, but still a lager no less for those curious. Very glad to have tried this offering from Surly."
"For an American brewery trying to squirm out a Helles lager it is a better attempt than most but American brewers have a lot to learn if they want to make a quality Helles."
"O: A BMC drinkers cross over beer. Nothing sexy just easy drinking."
"Overall a solid beer. Nothing to get really excited about but it's well made."
"Found on tap at Bailey's Taproom. Body is a bright golden color, rather still and without much head. Crisp, slightly sweet malt on the nose, with a decidedly bready character. Palate is crisp with a slight tang, I'm never sure how to describe it, but it's a telltale marker of the Helles style. Notes of light fruit, bready malt, and mildly fruity hops are present as well. Body is light and airy, although some more carbonation would not be a bad addition. A decent beer for the start of an evening in late summer, that's for sure."
"D/O- Only real complaint is on appearance. Shot out of the gate like a lager thoroughbred- then fizzled and was lifeless. Tastes great though that if they were to lower the price to about 4 for $6.99 it may well be my go-to (read: have to trade for a couple cans) beer every summer."
"O: Vastly different from the last Keller Bier I had, with the other one being my preference. Not bad, but probably my least favorite beer from Surly thus far."
"O - Very smooth and light. Refreshing."
"A nice, flavorful lager that is hitting the spot after doing some yardwork in the summer heat!"
"(O) Pretty decent beer. Been a while since I've had a straight up lager beer. This is a great lager style, but it's not something I would go scouring the land for. It's like a fuller flavor, bigger bodied MGD, in my honest opinion, which isn't a bad thing as I feel this is how a lager should taste, or how MGD wants to taste like anyway."
"O: Nice on a hot day, but the gastric quality was a bit of a turnoff. I think I'll stick with Hefeweizens when I'm in the mood for a summer beer."
"Awesome can, pretty good brew."
"M / O. Drier than I would have guessed, this demands large sips. The finish is excellent, just bitter enough to fade out gently, leaving a cleansing, lemon-malt-sweet finish. I am rather surprised by the (relatively) low scores this has been getting - with a beer of this style, freshness is paramount. I'm happy to say this one passes with flying colors. Surly Hell is a true to-style winner. Wish we had it here."
"o: this is a marginally hoppier version of any bmc beer. i don't find this offensive, possibly because its a fresh can, but also perhaps because there is very little flavor. they've nailed the light lager style, which i hear is technically difficult to produce."
"The CPJ"
"O - Pretty good, one of the better Lagers I've had, but not a style I go nuts over."
"(D)- Definitely crisp and refreshing during this heat wave we are having, but this is definitely NOT Surly's best stuff."
"this beer is not fun it was hell to drink. the malts were heavy and syrupy seemed not very carbonated and flat. Yeast taste was very rough and gave me a headache. Not impressed with this beer surprised by the high ratings. Yokel was better than this a lot better from my memories and that is only other Zwickel I have had so far but that was a long time ago."
"O - overall a nice easy drinking summer type beer. Tastes very good and I'll have to try this again."
"O- Extremely drinkable. Simple and very well made. I would make,this a regular if I could."
"O: Such a drinkable, refreshing light beer; simple and yet something in the flavors that are quite complex"
"O: Goes down easily, tasty, not too filling, mild kick, nice representation of style. This is a fantastic, easy drinking beer. Perfect for a nice summer night."
"overall...well this might be the first surly offering that i'm underwhelmed by. especially for the price. if this came straight from deutschland i could understand, but this is down the road on I-94 a few hundred miles. anyways...it's a delicate style and probably not my favourite in the grand scheme of things. i suppose i could recommend this, but i won't ever revisit it. too many other summer quenchers at much more reasonable prices."
"Hard to say anything bad about this beer. Poured a lovely straw-yellow with a solid white head that dissipated quickly. The aroma is of German hops and sweet bread dough. Hell drinks light and refreshing while maintaining a viscous texture. It is really quite interesting. No bitterness at all. More of a sweet beer with just enough hops to keep things even keel. Perfect for drinking while grilling, which, incidentally, is what I was doing."
"Poured into my Bruery snifter. Golden yellow, clear pour with bubbles and a small white head. Smells nice (I am shockingly under qualified to review a Zwickel Beer). A light sweetness and mild hop profile combine with a mild breadiness. The taste follows the nose, with a fresh and clean flavor making this astonishingly drinkable. Mouthfeel is clean, relatively light and carries a very small lingering sweetness. This is such a nice drinker on a porch, with my wife, after work on a warm day. Go get 'em Surly!"
"Overall: A very solid take on a German style. Refreshing, easy to drink, and with enough flavor going on to keep things interesting."
"Overall: A very tasty lager that is well balanced and fairly light. Surly knocks it out of the park again."
"Lots of old-time bready sweetness on the palate mixed. The grain is surprisingly smooth as it goes down. The slightest kiss of hops at the end provides balance. I could (and did) drink this all night."
"O: A well put together beer for what it is. Nevertheless, not as complex as I wanted at the time, yet an enjoyable quaff after a hot day at the lake. "
"I realize this probably takes a lot of skill to produce this type of quality lager and the price in theory may be justified but I really think this could really become a go to beer for many if it was priced a little lower and marketed to the macro crowd. I could see this being Surly's Spotted Cow but only 100 times better...."
"It is hard to do justice in describing just how awesome this beer tastes and smells."
"One of Surly's more drinkable beers to be sure. Not that I don't love some of Surly's heftier offerings, but it's nice to see them brew an awesome beer that, while falling slightly outside of true session ABV range, could certainly be sessioned. Crisp, clean, tasty, refreshing, and awesome on a hot summer day."
"O- Not really a fan of light beers, but this is quite tasty and refreshing during the summer months. Another solid seasonal offering from Surly."
"Overall, its a style I drink very rarely but one that I feel Surly has done a solid job with. Grab a lawn chair, enjoy a couple of these, and call it a fine summer day."
"O- Im not a big fan of lagers, this is one of the better more refreshing lagers I’ve had, but its not a style I care about. Solid brew, on the lower scale of beers from surly IMO."
"I'm constantly wowed by Surly's beers, but this one didn't bowl me over. I know, it's a pale lager, but it's lacking the subtlety and complexity I've come to expect from their takes on milder styles. I might drink it again, I might not. Leaning towards not."
"I'm looking forward to trying this on tap somewhere soon, of the summer styles I've been trying lately I think Hell takes the cake."
"Overall - what this beer lacks in complexity it makes up in sheer drinkability. This is a great beer for drinking on a warm summer day or night. Not one to pass up as the style presents something new to many craft beer drinkers and, oh yeah, it's in a can."
"Pours a golden yellow with two fingers of white head. Smells of a bready/biscuity with a slight grassy hop aroma. Taste of bready malt, dry, grassy hops with a slight lemon citrus. Mouth is nicely carbonated-not too much like some lagers very light. This is a great beer for all seasons but would be best for these hot months."
"This is just a regular ol' Helles. It's well-brewed, like I said, but you could have told me it had come from any other competent brewer and I would have believed you."
"The beer pours a rich golden color with a finger of white foam. Head recedes leaving a thick coaster and some nice lacing. The nose is bready malt and mild citrus. Taste is malt forward with a nice citrus quality at play in the background. The body is light but not thin. A high level of carbonation suits this beer well. Overall this is another solid offering from Surly. Glad I got the opportunity."
"Thin to medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice."
"D - Very easy to drink, a very suitable summer beer."
"note: I rated this comparing it to what it is supposed to be not in comparison to other styles such as DIPA and Imperial Stouts etc.. For a lager beer it really hits on all cylinders."
"It is light on taste too, though. While it does the Keller Bier style with poise, it's just not really that tasty a style. For being as light as it is, there's still a bready feel in the mouth that gives you something to look forward to each sip. That - combined with the low abv of it and the ease on the palate - makes this a very drinkable beer. One I would repeat en masse without regret."
"Poured a hazy pale golden yellow with a finger of fluffy white head and left a little lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was quite light but nice consisting of malts, various grains, slight hop character, and some citrus notes peeking through. The flavor brought out the hops a tad bit more alongside the varoius grains, citrus accents, and a malt backing to balance out the zwickel. The brew was light in body with a good amount of tingly carbonation which had a grainy, citrusy, and slight hop bite finish. It drank very good and was very refreshing, I hope I can get my hands on more of these surly beers."
"It never ceases to amaze me at how full Surly fills their CANs. Following the Crack, the Glug has to take place rather quickly to avoid foam-over. I started with just better than a finger of foamy, bone-white head that quickly fell, leaving some lacing in its wake. Color was a slightly hazy golden-yellow. I was frankly disappointed as I hoping for opaque, filled with yeast-driven haze. Oh well. Nose was VERY bready up front with a a tang of Noble hops behind it. Mmmm. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a minty, grassy hoppiness on the tongue, initially, but giving 'way to a bready, biscuity maltiness. Finish was clean and crisp with a nice balancing act between to hops and malt. I was not blown away by the experience, but on the other hand, I have had so many p**s-poor lager-style beers out of a CAN that this was a welcome change. I'd leave some room in my cooler, but there are better Surlys to be had."
"SkÅL!"
" ~ When the folks at Surly created this beer they did so in a manner that allowed for true character to shine through. There's no place for error to hide with this beer. Which is fine, 'cause I don't think there's any error to discuss."
"D - Excellent clean dry finish leads to maximum chugability. This is an excellent summer time brew. Perfect for hot days playing horseshoes (from personal experience)."
"The crisp bitterness satisfying, as is the malt. I can't say this is something I'm after again, but I wanted to try it. It is leaps and bounds in front of macros."
"Big thanks to billab914 for this extra in a recent trade! Served from can into a Warsteiner mug. Pours a golden yellow orange with a one finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of malt, citrus, bread, and spices. The flavor was of malt, citrus, spices, and subtle hop. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a very nice brew. I am definitely glad I got the chance to try this one. It had a very nice refreshing flavor to it with great flavors. Went down very easily and quickly due to this fact. This is a definite must try without a doubt."
"Hell is top notch for drinkability. Incredibly flavorful & balanced. The American hops do wonders for the beer without over-shadowing the finer aspects. If possible, this would have regular visits in the old beer fridge. Recommended."
"I feel like Surly has a cult following and some will overrate their beers based on reputation, however, it is a reputation they fully deserve. This is NOT a 'typical' Surly beer, but it IS excellent."
"A great summer brew glad I got to experience it"
"this is light and easy in every way. zesty and grainy, but refreshing."
"Another very good beer from Surly - haven't had a sub-par one yet. If I had a regular supply, this would be staple in my fridge during the summer."
"The flavor is similarly mild, but unequivocally delicious. Lightly toasted pale & pilsen malts lay down a solid, dry base that's both crisp and refreshing. A tinge of grassy hops is saved for the finish with a light mineral presence. The body is perfectly balanced--not too thin--and nicely carbonated. Hell drinks incredibly smooth with a little bite on the end. An excellent lager from a can from the good folks at Surly, and a fun exercise in subtlety for the ""imperial"" age."
"Decent beer but not especially exciting in any particular attribute."
"Honestly, the only thing that keeping this one at 4 in the drinkability category is the style - this style practically defines the term for me. Thus, any bit of coarseness is a bit of a hit, even a minor one as in this one."
"A perfect summer lager with nice flavor and mouthfeel."
"D: The perfect summer session beer. Incredibly refreshing but gives you almost nothing to think about when drinking it. Goes down easy as hell though. I'll be needing more of this as the football season kicks into gear!"
"d - A pretty nice beer that is very easy to drink. Some nice fruit in the smell and taste, would try again."
"It did become a bit boring towards the end. if I weren't thinking about it, I wouldn't have noticed, though."
"D - Other than the overly bloaty carbonation I can't see anything that would be a big inhibitor. Wish this was available at the ballpark or something. A better session beer than Gossamer in my opinion."
"drinkability is good. the alcohol is hidden well, but it leans a little toward sweetness so it's not completely balanced. quite tasty!"
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, just a hint of acidity, goes down real easy. A nice lager with some different character. Thanks Russ and Jen!"
"Pours an unfiltered, cloudy-clear straw golden color with an airy white head that quickly fades to wispy ring with little lacing. Looks like any other lager, only slightly more hazy. Aroma is again very lager like, pale malts, breadiness, mild green fruit sweetness and very little hop presence. Flavor is slightly richer than your average lager with a slight yeast taste adding some snap to an otherwise unremarkable and light bready malt body. The finish is the most unique part, with the hops showing up at the last minute with some zesty lemon notes. Light bodied with full carbonation and a clean, dry finish. Is this the best Surly beer or keller? No. But in the context of other light lagers this is phenomenal."
"drinkability: good"
"in person trade with dirtylou, thanks dood!"
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with carbonation being moderate for the style. Drinkability is very good, it was a very easy drinking and flavorful beer. It has a very nice balance to it that aided in the drinkability. The lager crispness made this a nice refreshing choice after working on my kitchen renovation all day."
"This was a disappointing brew. It's very 1-sided. What you taste initially is what you get, nothing else emerges as you drink. Don't bother hunting this one, not worth you time."
"Pours a very clear yellowy orange color with a Niven creamy white head. Aroma has some lemony hops and some sweet bread. Nice balance. Taste is very clean and crisp. Similar to a helles lager but this has some more hops to it. Really beautiful flavors and great for the summer. The mouthfeel is medium bodied but light flavorwise on the finish. Drinkability is up there and love the cans."
"Can. Grabbed a fresh 4 pack the other day and time to re-visit this old friend after drinking plenty of it last year. Pours an absolute crystal clear golden color with a white as snow 2 finger head. The smell is very clean. Slight hops and balanced sweetness. The taste can only really be described as clean and crisp. A great summer time beer for anyone, including macro only drinkers. From Surly you expect a big hop bomb or something else extreme but this is just a straight up drinking beer. If you are looking for strong hops, then look somewhere else as this will not satisfy that craving. Light/medium mouthfeel."
"D. Excellent drinkability - this beer seems to disappear quickly. It's light enough to offer good sessionability with just enough complexity to keep my interest. Well crafted and worth seeking out."
"Thanks to Sean for this great beer to start the night...Pour is nothing special, looks like a lager...Aroma is light but refreshing, not any skunk. Taste is also lighter with light hops but totally easy to drink. No skunks at all. One of the best lagers I've had."
"This is a nice beer and very drinkable. Great hot weather beer for sure. I think I'd choose a pilsener first in most cases but I would be quite happy grabbing a can of this on a warm day as well. Good stuff."
"Thanks to Connor for getting Surly to NY for me. Poured into a pint glass the beer has a nice two-finger, fluffy white head which recedes to a thin film. Smell the lager yeast with a very sweet malt profile behind it. Clean tasting with strong yeasty bready flavors. It's very smooth and light bodied, very refreshing. This is a great and easy beer to drink, I'm glad they come in 16 oz cans."
"Beer is medium to light in body with minimal grainy bitterness. Very smooth in the mouth, minimal carbonation on the palate. Nice sweetness up front, finishes wet."
"A great and easy drinking summer brew from Surly."
"What can I say? this beer was a knockout in my opinion and I really wish this was a beer that we could get regularly here in Pennsylvania. If I had to come up with a one word description of this beer I would say, balance because this baby is perfect. The drinkability on this was extremely high and I know I could drink a few more right now! This was light and crisp and mildly hoppy which was a great combonation for for just about every beer drinker across the board. I really feel that this could be a great gateway beer for the BMC drinkers out there. If you get a chance to try this beer I'd highly recommend it and you should seek it out if you are into beer trading because you will not be disappointed"
"A slightly above average brew. Good to wash down a grilled kielbasa sandwich. Not the top offering from the brewery. Worth a try if you see it."
"Solid on style but not really my cup of tea. Semi-bland but would be great after cutting the grass on a hot afternoon."
"Serving type: Can"
"Supremely drinkable!"
"O: Very solid offering and not a typical Surly hop-bomb."
"D- Very drinkable, low ABV makes it a nice session beer. Very nice for the style."
"This is very disappointing coming from Surly. This is the second time I have had this beer, at a different location this time around, so no mistake in getting the order right. It reminded me of Japanese beer. Perhaps if it were chilled to ~34F it would be more palatable."
"drinkability is nice. good crisp and low abv. bitterness detracts a bit from drinkability."
"d-epic summer beer. best lager i've probably ever had in my life. as usual, i'm in debt to my friends in the cities..."
"D: Drinkability is off the charts. Awesomely crisp and very, very refreshing. Goes down sooo smooth and fast. Easily go through a 4-pack no problem and a low abv to boot. Fiendishly drinkable no doubt."
"Not really sure why this beer is so popular and so difficult to procure. There are many lagers that I would drink over this."
"D - Very drinkable brew, lighter than any of the other Surly brews. Nice refreshing taste. A well put crafted brew perfect summer sipper. I recommend this brew and will for sure have this again!!!"
"Thanks Shango42!"
"Anyways, this clear golden brew pours with a medium, white head. The aroma has toasted barley with light blackberries and creamy orange. The flavor starts out with a strong toast and cracker, but rich, yet mellow, herbal citrus hops. There are also hints of vanilla, cinnamon, cream soda, and lemon. I know this style is meant to be enjoyed cold, but this beer comes alive at cellar temperature. It's not a straight-up traditional Helles (like the label says) or Zwickel, but it's close to both and a damn fine lager. I want more and so should you."
"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet! Might as well start now. I poured this can up to the brim in a pint glass and there was still some left in the can. Bonus!! However, this means no head or lacing, but it's a nice golden color with yellow edges. (Takes a few sips while it's resting on the desk) Yum! Okay, the smell. Aroma is lightly fruity with a pale malt sweetness and only mild hops. Taste is great! Everything I expect out of light lager. Smooth, easy drinking, crisp, mild sweetness, just enough bitterness to back things up with no real hop flavor present, only light bitterness. Bready and grainy. This is how all American macro lagers should taste!! Feel is light, almost medium, low carbonation, and certainly quaffable. Session beer, bitches!"
"The overall character combined with lower ABV, a higher carbonation and light body lends to a clean palate and high drinkability."
"Very drinkable, perfect beer for a hot summer day."
"As pale lagers or KellerBiers go this is pretty much right on track for the style. Perhaps a bit more American then German as its sweetness isn't as deep and softly breaded as the German types that I've enjoyed. Solid none the less, and Surlys only true drinking Summer beer that needed to be released about a month earlier. Its been hot...and this quenches the Summer thirst well."
"Drinkability is excellent. Very refreshing and easy to drink."
"D: Incredibly drinkable and perfect for a hot summer MN day like today. The only problem with this beer's drinkability is that one might be too inclined to chug it down, but the truth is as great as it is cold if you let it warm ever so slightly the flavors become more pronounced. I feel like I've said this about another beer, but now, this is the best lager I've ever had. Once again, Surly is awesome."
"D: Quite easy to down a tasty can of this."
"Very good session beer."
"Pours a crystal clear yellow color with a finger of head. Aroma a nice light corn maltiness. Very clean and appetizing. The flavor follows suit, with a clean corn and biscuit maltiness dominating. None of the mustiness that I often find comes with this type of flavor profile. The body is medium and the carbonation is nice and soft. The drinkability is high in terms of volume but average in terms of desire simply because it is not an exciting style. Overall a very solid example of the style, and a blueprint session beer."
"D: Top notch... a little light in the aroma department but all around nice and refreshing... with warm days around the corner, this is a good choice for roof top drinking... the can is a plus."
"The beer is light bodied and highly carbonated. The carbonation adds to the crisp and sharp flavors and characteristics of the beer. There is also a nice dry finish that gives the beer an even more clean vibrant flavor. This is something I could enjoy several cans of; the low alcohol, light body and sharp/clean flavors make this very drinkable and enjoyable. Another good beer from Surly, I have yet to be disappointed by any of their offerings."
"Pours a nice straw color with a bit of unfiltered haze. A nice finger-and-a-half of white head with nice legs as it retreats. Smell has a pilsner, grainy sweetness with an ever-so-slight hop presence. A bit grassy with hints of herbal earth. Taste is very similar with a tiny amount of spice thrown in there. Mouthfeel is light with a nice crispness. Very drinkable; reminds me yet again why I need to always have more Surly."
"SEE YOU IN HELL!"
"Poured from the can into a tulip. Thanks Eric! Pours a brilliant yellow gold with a fluffy 1' head and a slight haze. Smells of fresh breads, some toastiness and lightly of hops. Nice crisp flavor- some bready yeast and a good amount of bitterness on the sides of my tongue. Slightly cloying bitter aftertaste lessens the drinkability score. But would be a great lawnmower beer on a nice summer day."
"Part of my Secret Santa 2009 haul from Scoobydank. This is the only beer I was missing in order to have tried everything Surly has put into cans thus far. Poured from a 16 ounce can into my nonic Imperial pint glass. Appears a mildly hazed bright golden yellow color with around a finger of fluffy white foam. Nose and flavors consist of toasted grain, bread, nice fruitiness (apple, pear, grape), a touch of sweetness, light caramel, grass. Medium bodied with adequate carbonation. Dry, clean, and pretty drinkable. Nicely done. Keller are one of the few lagers that I truly enjoy, and this one hits the mark."
"Pours rich golden with low cloudiness and a nondescript white head that displays fair retention and spots of lace. Aroma is primarily earthy hops with lots of straw and an easy malt sweetness. Tastes of straw with earthy hops that provide a pleasantly moderate amount of bittering, malt sweetness takes a background for a crisp finish with only the kiss of the hops. Light to medium in body with a good moderate carbonation--not too fizzy but plenty of bubbles. Overall a very pleasant pale lager on par with America's best examples."
"EDIT: After reading up on keller bier, a style I admittedly new very little about before drinking this beer, I raised the appearance from 3.0 to 3.5. This beer is traditionally cloudy."
"Overall, a very solid session offering from Surly. Definitely wouldn't hesitate to pick this up if were available to me."
"Drinkability: This beer is a great example of an all night, easy drinking, sessionable beer to me. It has good flavor, but nothing too robust or extreme. I can see myself tossing back a few of these in an evening, however I will have to move on to something else since this is my only one."
"Reviewed on 9/12/2009. Can. Pours a clear light orange with a small white head. Aroma of grainy malt. Flavor of sweet fruits, grainy malt, some bitter hops in the finish. Very solid, easy drinking. Palate is nice, not too sweet or too plain. Nice z/k/l!!"
"Mouthfeel is light crisp and refreshing. Great balance of lightness and simplicity with refinement and thought-provoking challenge. Another knockout from a great brewery. Cheers!"
"Pours a bright gold light copper color with a large fluffy white head. The head retention is moderate with some nice lacing. The beer smells of caramel, honey and nice citrusy orange hops. Good malt hop balance crisp and fresh smelling. This beer drinks really easy with a nice carbonation and great balance. Smooth on the tongue with a light hop bite. Caramel, light roasted malt, hind of honey and roasted nuts. Fairly dry finish with lingering bitterness from the hops. I really like the beer and could see myself drinking it often in the summer."
"Poured from a 16 oz. can into an oversized pilsner glass. Golden color, thick white head that dissipated into good lacing all the way down. Sweet aroma, with a bit of hoppy shaprness at the edges. This had a pleasant sweetess all the way through and finished very clean. I can imagine a good go-to beer on a hot summer day -- I'll have to save one until it warms up a bit here!"
"D- This brew was pretty easy to drink. The sweetness really threw me off guard."
"Very easy to drink."
"On the palate I get grain and fruit flavors and ample bitterness from hops and grain husk. It's light, clean, refreshing as hell (lmao) with a grainy, mildly bitter finish. Beyond a hint of initial sweetness up-front, this beer is quite dry and crisp. Another delicious canned offering from Surly; can this brewery do wrong? (The answer, FYI, is yes, they can, but not often)."
"D: Oh so easy to drink. Refreshing and perfect on a surprisingly temperate November afternoon. Low alcohol, definitely could have another. Gone too quickly. Thanks, Jim."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability gets high marks. With the low ABV and the light body, I could have quite a few of these. Overall, for what this is, this is a good beer. Very ""macro"" like, but with a fuller flavor. But, that being said, Surly makes much better offerings. Skal."
"Drinkability: I'm not a fan of the style or the flavor profile but its a session beer all the way."
"D - Easy drinking Helles that is well balanced and has a nice fruity aroma and flavor. I was expecting something a bit more extreme from Surly, but this was just a fine example of the style."
"D - Drinkability is pretty good for the Hell. Flavor is mild. Alcohol is low. It's very smooth. That's pretty much the trifecta of an easy drinking brew. The aroma could probably use a little work but that's really about it. I could easily see this beer find a niche in the concert / sporting event crowd. Given the current distribution, I probably wouldn't seek this one out again. If given the chance though, I'd probably never turn it down either."
"Overall this is a very clean lager that has a good amount of drinkability. Worth a shot."
"Lots of crisp light flavor but not watered down at all. Refreshing slightly creamy medium body with a nice amount of bready yeast and crisp light fruit. I'm picking up a lot of apple, first in the aroma and now in the flavor. There is a lot of sweet pilsner malt that is countered by a slight zest spiciness and an amazing crisp floral hop presence as well as a pleasant toasted biscuit malt character. This is an insanely drinkable, very flavorful session beer that I wish that I had constant access to."
"This is a very solid lager from Surly and extremely drinkable. Not sure it's my favorite style, but this is a very good example."
"Pours a clear straw yellow with a big three finger fluffy white head. A slow crawl down the sides of the glass leaves behind spotty spiderweb lacing. Smell is pretty mild; corn, honey, and some bready malts...nothing more, nothing less. After the first sip I realize the taste is exactly like the nose; corn, honey, and bready malts. The only difference is a slight floral hop flavor but it's very minimal. Pretty hefty medium body for a lager, I like. Good carbonation with a creamy feel. Drinkable for sure, but it should be, it's a 5.1% lager. I had two cans of this prior to my review and at first I really loved this beer. Now sitting down and reviewing it, I find that that love has faded, kinda like Dan-O's stone washed jeans. Nothing too crazy about this one. It's good, don't get me wrong...but A+ beer this is not."
"Hell is neither eternal punishment nor eternal reward. It's much, much closer to the latter and might even get there with a few well-chosen changes. In the end, Surly Purgatory is probably a more appropriate name. I applaud Todd and Omar for 'going small', and hope they continue to do so... as long as the beers that made them famous continue to be brewed. Thanks to feloniousmonk for setting one aside for me."
"D: Very sessionable, easy to drink, and palette is still fresh."
"The mouth was a tad wet and thin, but for the style that may be normal? Not sure. Very easy to drink though. The body was light with little carbonation play on the tongue. Flavor was pretty decent. Light citrus pop with hints of hop bitterness and a semi-sour finish. This is my first of this style. It reminds me of a Kolsch or something of the sort. This was refreshing. I'd have another."
"Overall, this is a drinkable beer as it is balanced and not overpowering in alcohol or flavor. However, that lack of intensity is also probably what keeps me from rating it a bit higher."
"Mouthfeel is strangely flat, despite the big white head."
"D: A really nice beer. Lagers get a bad name but they can be really good and this is a great beer. I would love to always have this in the fridge at the ready."
"D- Very drinkable, really this should be called surly session. I really liked this beer more than I thought I would, one of the best lagers I've had."
"Pours a clear golden body with a puffy white head that leaves decent lacing and is slow to fall. Aroma is of light grassy hops and clean malts. Light bodied mouthfeel with medium carbonation. A mild bitterness up front leads to a light sweet malt flavor at mid tongue and a slightly bitter finish. Not a bad beer, but I don't find myself wanting a second pint when I'm through with the first."
"This just isn't very good."
"Can shared via piscator34- pours straw golden with fluffy two finger head. Very soapy lacing. Nose- buttery sweetness, faint grassy hops. Taste- grass, mineral, sweet dough. Finish - drying aspirin like. Low to medium carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good but dryness of finish in mouthfeel gets old after awhile."
"A satisfying medium fullness here to the Lager flavors, with a light and crisp feel, Surly sure picked an easy drinking one to put in a 16 oz can. I think I'll go have another!"
"D: The fairly mild and overall non-offensive flavors of this beer, combined with the light mouthfeel make it a very easy drinker. I'm generally not a big lager fan, and this beer certainly didn't change my mind. That said, it was pretty good and very nice to have tried."
"Surly has yet to dissapoint."
"My first of a 4-pack received from Mothman (thanks Ben). This is clear golden colored, a surpise as I expected some cloudiness in the zwickel style. Big rocky head that had a dry-appearing surface. The beer smelled a little grainy and not too different from several popular lagers, maybe a little floral hops but mainly grain. Same with the taste, delicately sweet and malty, not exactly rich but just about right for a lager. This goes down like water, hard to imagine much better drinkability. Overall a well done lager, I'd have liked more haze or other evidence of the unfiltered production but tasty and made to the style in every other way."
"Overall a very drinkable and refreshing beer. Good for a summer afternoon."
"D: Great, like a standard Euro Lager really, which is good I suppose, but at the same time not."
"First off, let me thank tytoanderso for throwing way more than he needed to into the box of Surly beers this came in. I poured this straight in to a Guinness pint glass, and was not disappointed by the results. I got a clear golden colored beer, with a stunning white head that froths and sticks for quite some time. Smell is very doughy, like freshly baked bread and malt. Same thing comes through in the taste. Mainly bread, but some hint of fruit here and there. Feel is light, refreshing, and really drinkable. It is really cool to see Surly tackling a lighter style of beer like this, and putting their own spin on it. An excellent session beer that went well with pizza. Cheers"
"Drinkability: Who would have thought a light lager could pack this much flavor? Surly did."
"Overall, probably the best light beer I have ever had. It has so much flavor for such a light beer. Very drinkable. I will have not problem with my can. I highly recommend this if you don't like light lagers, because I don't and I love this one."
"The ultimate lawnmower beer - a very good beer. This is something that should be slipped to devoted macro drinkers to begin to shimmy them over to the dark side. And they would like it."
"I've never been able to tell the difference between a Helles and a Kellerbier... but I would call this a Helles if I had to pick... that said, if this was available locally, I would buy it again and again during the summer... and I would slap myself in the hand anytime I ever reached for PBR again."
"Overall a wonderful addition to their lineup. This is damn near a perfect summer brew, I could have drank ten of these without batting an eye, it was just that smooth. Go get this one."
"I get lemon and slight breadiness in the taste buds, though I'm not picking up as much of that bready malt as I thought I would. This is very refreshing, but I have to admit, isn't doing a whole lot for me. Carbonation is good and this is very quaffable, but I'm not floored like I have been with other Surly offerings. Perhaps this should have been paired with food? Happy for the opportunity but I won't be seeking any out any more down the line."
"This is an easy drinking lager from Surly, it could be a crossover beer for the non-Beer Advocate crowd, but still gives some interesting flavor for the more discerning palettes."
"D: Strong. Gimme more! I would order another and definitely buy another four pack or two. I do see what all the fuss was about. This is a beer to be tracked down and enjoyed on a warm day in the sun."
"Drinkability is out of this world."
"Very drinkable, highly recommended. Thanks to Arsenal04..."
"Personally, I'd like to see a solid german beer like this brewed with some german hops instead of american hops. And I'd like to see the malt featured even moreso over the hops."
"Poured into a pint glass, this beer left a one finger head that took a couple minutes to dissipate which left a thin, frothy layer on top. The beer is a darker-than-I thought-it-would-be yellow with orange hues. The can boasts ""fresh bread aroma"" and it's very apparent as the smell reminds me of driving past my hometown's bread factory. I also pick up what I believe to be lemon that is lurking in the backdrop. Interesting. Malts are very dominate after the first taste of this beer. What I find rather pleasant is that I detect some citrus flavors as well; the beer has a unique aftertaste that reminds me of a Saison. Very light feel to it that is easy to drink - even chug if I was thirsty. Overall, a solid beer that matched my expectations going in."
"Drinkability: HELL yeah! This is a damn tasty beer with a moderate ABV and a crisp clean taste that makes it very easy to do a session with. I had a few off the tap and they went down very easily."
"Total session beer. These would go down all night long without question. Great beer."
"D: This is an exceptional lager. I'm not super familiar with the style, but it is definitely one I want more of. This beer is the epitome of drinkability. This should be a summer seasonal for Surly. It would be in my fridge all summer long. A great companion on golf outings and fishing trips or just after a night mowing the lawn...which I should get around to."
"This beer pours a clear spun gold color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice sticky lacing. The aroma very bready, slightly spicy, and has a nice faint metallic thing going on that reminds me of a lot of good beers I drank while living in Germany. For a golden lager this beer has a very robust aroma. The taste is as bready as the aroma with a hop presence that is noticeable, but certainly plays second fiddle to the malt. The nice metallic taste from the aroma is present in the taste too. Again, like the aroma, the taste is larger than one would expect from a golden lager. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a very nice beer. It is sessionable, flavorful, and has good complexity in more taste and aroma. I would really like to see Surly making this into a year-round beer."
"Stellar drinkability, very rounded brew. It sucks that it will only be available for a week or two. I could drink this on the daily."
"D: This is yet another unique brew from Omar and the guys. It's excellent, and I wish they would have brewed more of it. Definitely a great session brew."
"Medium bodied and medium carbonation. This beer is well made and very drinkable."
"D-Highly drinkable. Tasty, an accessible example of the style, while still slightly pushing the boundary in typical Surly fashion."
"This is an exceptional summer lager, made in right here in good old MN. So fresh. So tasty. So nicely balanced. So damn good."
"went to my local store to buy a 4-pak of furious and what do i see helll in 4-paks on the shelf i did not think surly was canning this? of course i bought a 4-pak of a style that is not my favorite but this is surly ok..it pours a golden yellow with a really fresh head it smells of noble hops and sweet malts really smooth the taste is the same its a good version of the style bready and malty with a smooth hop bite..this is not a hop bomb but a good entry for 1st time surly drinkers..i wont buy this very often but will recommend trying because it is tops in its style."
"Very clear light gold body, small white head tops it off. Sweet pils malts dominate the nose, some grassy notes as well. Very sweet taste, bready and grassy. Bit of bitter hops rounds it out. Pretty lively on the tongue, wet and thin mouth. Quite a tasty brew, wish they would keep it around"
"D= very high. This is a surly beer for everyone. Really nothing special about it and sort of rediculous due to the hype that surrounded the release. I would prolly not buy it again if it came out regularly just because its so plain for the price. Still a good beer though."
"This August, Surly and Summit both released an unassuming German beer style and hit home runs with their Helles/Zwickel and Kolsch, respectively. I want to face them off against each other to see which is better. I really don't know who would win. While Surly did a fantastic job here, I have to commend Summit for standing up to Surly's challenge to the Minnesota craft beer scene."
"Great brew Surly, you fooled me into liking lagers again."
"Drinkability- Great! Nice easy drinking lager that does manage to not be totally lame and bland. Nice and malty with the slightest kiss of hops that I really enjoyed. It was very drinkable and could easily be sessioned for hours and hours. Without getting crucified for blasphemy, this would be an EXCELLENT beer for Sunday morning bloody beers. Tasty football beer that accompanied my potato pancakes wonderfully."
"Did it knock me over with flavor? No, but I didn't really expect it to. It was malty, balanced and refreshing. I am sad that is likely the only glass I will get but I'm glad I searched 5 places for it."
"The drinkability of this beer is high. It is a beer that I would consider ""lawnmower beer", meaning that it could be drank to quench thirst on a warm day or after a bit of vigorous activity. It is not a style of beer that I drink that often, but I will gladly recommend to fans of American lagers that are ready to try something different and more complex."
"Pours a wonderful golden hue with an almost orange touch to it. Looks brilliant with a nice head straight off. A nice fragrant bouquet of floral and fruity notes with a almost grassy overtone. Tastes wonderful. Peach and pear are predominant tones. A nice restrained bitterness from the hops and great flavor from the malted barley as well. Some sweet honeyed notes trickle in too. A nice mouthfeel, crisp and light but with a nice firmness to it. As others have noted before me it is ridiculously drinkable. You really could have this one all day and get in many pints before you even realized it. Wonderfully smooth and drinkable. A fantastic summer, or really anytime beer that is yet another hit from surly. I'll be sure to catch as much hell as I can before it's gone in not too long. Lovely."
"D/O: If Mild didn't, this should shut the Surly critics up pretty quickly. While it's not something I'd expect to see as a year-round, this is a knockout session lager. Proving once and for all that Omar, Todd and crew can produce solid beers from 100 IBU IPAs to century old German recipes."
"clean, yet fully flavored. You can hand this to a lager-lover and win them over, I think. Hey, it worked with me!"
