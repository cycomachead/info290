"Not much to look at or smell, but a fine Helles Lager in flavor.  Light, flavorful and highly recommend this German offering."

"This is an excellent and flawless lager, one of the best I had. They got it to perfection after brewing this for a few centuries. If you like lagers, this is a must try."

"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 1D). Bottle 50 cl - Batch L2013151K. AROMA: grainy sweet aroma with very faint hop notes. some DMS is present. no esters or diacetyl. APPEARANCE: medium yellow color and translucent. thin moussy white head with low retention. TASTE: sweet and clean malt flavour that lingers into the aftertaste. very low bitterness. PALATE: thin body with low carbonation. OVERALL: a watered down helles that lacks the bitterness to balance a little the sweet malt profile."

"O: This won't hit you in the face but instead makes you take a step back and contemplate it. What you'll find is a simple but pure & complex beer"
""
"Overall: I am typically not a lager fan. However, this beer is excellent. Easy drinking with a wonderful balance between grainy sweetness and hop bitterness."

"My mark out of one hundred would be 83."

"O: Excellent drinkability. I can imagine myself drink gallons of this beer. State of art German Lager"

"O) Refreshing, light beer with a great heritage"
""
""
"Overall: Pretty solid helles lager. Solid beer."
""
"This is a perfect example of a German lager, a benchmark for others. Really good."
""

"O - A good export; a solid pale lager with a little bit of an unexpected kick. Not as drinkable as HP's Muenchener Gold but certainly holds it own. I have heard (I think others echo this here) that it incomparably better vom Fass (from the tap); I will review further if I find results change once i get the chance."

"Additional note: I tasted this side by side with the standard ""hell"" and didn't find much difference. It's just slightly darker. And also a touch fuller in character, but not by much, and at the same time a little less malty... ? More balanced, shall we say? So... I'd guess it's got a degree or so more Plato to it, a touch more hops for flavor, and just a hint of additional bitterness to balance that as well - OR, is it the same beer and just slightly more fermented? No, probably not."

"There is a MASSIVE difference between tasting this beer from a wooden keg (2 places in Munich always offer this: the Augustiner Keller Biergarten and the Augustiner Braeustuben)!!! The wooden keg Edelstoff is indescribably outstanding, the bottle version is blah- and that's putting it mildly. Make the trip, try it from the wooden keg (as it was meant to be enjoyed) at the above mentioned locals and your taste buds will thank you for it. TRUST ME!"

"Clarion yellow color with a short, somewhat creamy head. Stringy lacing here and there. Delightful clean pils malt sweetness, lightly floral noble hops, and a bit of lemon in the nose. Flavor is crisp, sweet pale malt and some grapey fruit. Not too much going on...a little sweet for what I like in a Helles. Pretty light bodied and easy to drink. I wish there was more depth to the maltiness and just a little more hop presence, but pretty good. I'd love to try it in Germany some day, but I don't see myself buying this again in the states as it's way too damn expensive."

"Honestly until i came to Munich and had this beer, I was skeptical of the German Lager. Im an American and I love my overly hoppy IPAs. But after a few days in Munich drinking this beer, I realized that not all beer can be or should be filled to the top with hops. I have gotten a little annoyed with what I call ""hop race"" in America where all these beers are competing to be the happiest (im speaking generally). Anyways, I said all that to say that this beer is the perfect example of a German Lager and is almost perfect in every way. Its refreshing and I could drink it buy the liters. I tried the other big six breweries of Munich while there and this was my favorite. I love how its still independently owned and doesnt have to market itself. Everyone drinks this around Munich, but you wont find any advertisements. Sells itself."

"overall: decent brew I would call this breed standard, have one by all means."
"As far as Munich Helles goes, this is a very good example. As far as I'm concerned, I really enjoy this beer a lot. I remember enjoying it a lot more at the Bräustuben, but its really an issue of atmosphere and having some pork knuckle to eat with it. Highly recommend."

"o: A tasty brew! My first Helles Lager, but it seems like the perfect pilsener-style beer, although a bit sweeter perhaps with more substance. Highly sessionable, and very much appreciated in the current summer heat."
""
""
""
""
"Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
"Overall, .. this now is my #1 top - rated warmer-weather / light beer ... cheers / prosit !"
""
"I thought the augustiner lagerbier hell yesterday was an amazing lager, until I tried this one, and it blew me away! Much more sweet and bready in flavor than the original lagerbier helles. I'm very surprised this one has a lower rating. I could drink this one all day. Hands down the best lager I've ever had. An original recipe since 1328!"

"Enjoyed this bier again. Delicious. This is what beer should taste like."

"Pours a clear yellow with a foamy white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. There is initially a strong skunk aroma after the pour that dissipates somewhat over time. I am also getting some malt, grain, and grassy and herbal aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet grain flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the flavors are a bit too sweet in my opinion."
""
""
"This beer is regarded among many Bavarians as the greatest beer in the world. I for one cannot disagree. It tastes exactly as Helles should, with no exaggerated colors, aromas, flavors, etc... I admit that I'm biased toward German lagers as my style of choice, this one, to me, stands out as simple perfection."

"O- This was a nice German beer. While I'm not a huge fan of the style, I definitely enjoyed drinking this although I can't say that it couldn't have been proven upon. I liked this and I would drink it again as well as recommend it if you want a true German beer experience."

"O - My go to Bavarian lager, unfortunately they do not export the .5 liter bottles."
""
""

"I recommend this beer, and if it weren't so expensive here, I'd buy it more often."
"Overall: Decent, but not great in my opinion. Not sure how long this six pack had been sitting on the shelf, but I am glad I picked it up anyway."
""

""

"Very pale, clear, medium head which wasn't particulary well retained but some lacing hung around. Malty aroma, a bit in your face, notes of tangerie. Tasted Munich malts, had a balanced sweetness, finish slightly bittersweet, flavours were a bit coarse. Well carbonated, quite crisp, smooth enough, slightly thicker texture than Augustiner's Helles. Overall not bad at all, rated lower than the Helles by the Munich natives, which was more subtle."
""
""
""
"Why anyone would drink any of the BMC macro swill when this is available is a complete mystery to me. Very nice beer..."
""
""
""
""
"Such a clean beer, and it feels so smooth. This is a lesson in how smooth and clean a good German beer should be. Now if it just had a touch more sweetness, itd be world class."
""
"O-Germans knows business."
"O: A good choice. I could keep drinking this refreshing treat all Summer long."
"O - Just superb."
""
""
"Taste is clean and bready, with a little sweetness balanced by a hint of citrus hops. Overall, an enjoyable, well-constructed, and drinkable German lager."
"Overall: this is a decent helles lager, but there are some faults with the aroma."
"This is a nice, soft, well-rounded, German lager. Its aroma is malty, light, and fresh. The golden colored beer is slightly hazy, but capped with a bright head. The taste is clean, with a notable pale malt flavor. Fuller in body than expected, and very drinkable. An nice German beer."
""
""
"Of course Augustiner Bräu wants to sell you bottled beer, but Augustiner Edelstoff is designed to be drunk fresh, on tap, in Munich or nearby. A bottle of the stuff in America is a very different experience. That difference includes more hoppy than you will get from a crisp, fresh Helles."
""
""
""
"O - A very tasty Helles lager. Superb drinkability, very refreshing and thirst quenching."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
""
"There's a friendly dryness to this brew, with the tartness of fruit. I can imagine lemon pepper chicken and rice accompanying this one with style and finesse."
""
"Overall, a complex, yet refreshing beer that I could definitely have multiple of in a given sitting. A great session beer, and the wooden cask aging just puts it over the top!"
"O: Very enjoyable and certainly one to grab again the next time I'm by a store that carries it. Very easy to drink but with a real pleasant maltiness to it. Definitely sessionable."
"I was given a 6pk as a gift - never heard of it before - pours a golden yellow with a 1 finger head that fades to a consistent ring - spotty lacing slides down the glass with each sip - I was surprised by the clean, fresh aroma of this beer - i guess I've become used to german lagers having that diacetyl skunkiness - hence my surprise when I tasted the actual ""bright' of this Helles Lager - great balance all-around - very enjoyable - wondering if the secret is the brown bottle here - good stuff!"
""
"A nice, refreshing beer pairs perfectly with the 19th hole."
"Pale gold in color, one finger head that dissipated quickly, lots of bubbles in first pour, fading fast. 50 cl bottle picked up in Nuremburg. Light and airy in the mouth, with smooth, mellow taste. Noted some of the grassy tones mentioned in previous reviews. Not sure if I would rate it as high as some of the previous marks, but a good, fairly light weight pilsener."
"D - Pretty good! I was surprised, this isn't a style I've been impressed with before."
"Pours a straw yellow. Nice white head leaves quickly. Smell is very grassy. Slight skunkiness. Taste is full of cereal and sweet grains. Very subtle and subdued. Tasted like a German Lager should. Had a very crisp feeling on the tongue. Not great/not bad."
"I rated this against other Helles Lagers and find it to be an exceptional version. Very complex for such a light lager. (Others should take note.)"
" The flavor is crisp with malt taste and slight sweet edge w/ mild floral hop flavor and an accent of pepper with light bread dough w/ yeast adding to the lightly kilned malt flavor adding dry spice in the mostly clean and dry finish. Overall this is a very good lager, I could enjoy this frequently with no problem - a pretty great beer for the style which shows flaws easily."
""
""
"Pours crystal clear straw gold. Soapy white head and decent lace and retention. Aroma of bready malts, noble hops and clean lager yeast. In the taste, mildly sweet upfront, more bread. flowery, noble hop bitterness provides a delicate balance. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied, crisp and drying. Solid lager, nice dry hop and easy to drink."

"The last time I had an Augustiner was in Germany on-tap at a restaurant. Even though this one is in a bottle, it is very good, though expensive."

"It lacks the something special that most helles have, but in a different way I really like this one."
"O: Fantastic ""Go-to"" Helles Lager by one of the oldest brewing companies in the world! Love this one."
"If you're looking for a helles, definitely recommended."
"The aroma was light. Some small amount of smoked in it, with lots of grain and bready malts, though I have to admit, not much here to really pick up on. The flavor was a bit better. Lots of campfire like smokiness in it, with a subtle, yet easily definable bready malt base. Some sweetness, caramel maybe and a light peach flavor when cold that quickly gets burnt out by the smoked and roasted malts. Way too light of a feel, almost makes the flavor get lost as it comes across a bit watered down."
"O: Not the best Helles I've had, but certainly drinkable and good for a hot day."
"Lots of nice flavors going on and decently balanced. Drinks quite well in a very hot living room."
"This is just great brew. All the elements fit. An easy choice to have again."
"Overall not worth it for the price but it's is pretty good. Still like spaten better"
"very aromatic and tasty beer that is a perfect example of the beer that germany produces. perfect head with a good amount of residual yeast floating about to contribute to that delicious yeasty flavor that most americans would consider unpleasant and foreign, but to the expert, it is a godsent."
"Dr: While this wouldn't be an awful fest beer, it an't much of a normal beer. Normal ABV, easy drinking, and low quality. Leave it on the shelf, lads, and pick something better."
"Notes: Highly drinkable, quality product. Lemon is a nice touch."
"This beer poured out has a pale golden color, the head was a little fizzy and left just a touch of lacing. The smell of the beer has the traditional German aroma, there a light skunk and grass aromas. There also a little lemon on the nose. The taste is actually a little citrusy mixed with the grassy flavors. It's got a pretty refreshing mouthfeel actually and it's got a lighter body. Overall this beer was much better than I expected it to be."
"Flavor was sort of bland with a dry, papery saltine cracker taste, some grassy hop bitterness in the aftertaste, but fairly subtle. Feel was very light and a bit watery. Dry with little to no residual sweetness, left with a somewhat hollow impression. It was ok to pair with some food, but ultimately just a pedestrian lager that didn't hold interest for long."
"Poured a 2"" irregular off-white head which dissipated to barely a trace. Clear straw yellow in color. Smells of malt, grass, and has just a slight start of skunking. Taste could be any average BMC American beer and in a blind taste test I'm pretty confident I would have guessed it was one of those. Acceptable but I guess I expected more from the makers of Maximator."
"This is a very solid, quenching lager. Everything about this screams quality; you can tell it's well-made even if the flavor doesn't smack you over the head. Simple but elegant. I'd drink this anytime. Recommended."
"Cheers!"
"For me, this style should be subtle and delicate, and this beer nails that. I'm still not in love with the style, but this is a light tasting, easy drinking beer a cut above most macro brews."
"overall one of the biggest surprises out here in poland that i ran into. and also something that turned to be quite well made but poorly executed. pour as nice and golden with a healthy head. nose was sort of nothing out of the ordinary. i was expecting some sort of interesting notes of german yeast and grain but it was just very much euro pale smelling. palate was surprisingly smoother though. or at least it maintained that for a long period of time. the feel was the only solid thing that differentiated the beer from anything that was quite common around eastern europe. a bit of apple and straw husk. the bottle looks better than the beer actually seems to taste."
"Dainty little thing. Watery. ABV is really suspect. Carbonation is soft & lacking. Probably the lightest Helles I've ever had. Not crisp enough to drink in quantity. Too light to bother to import. :/"
"In general a good drinking even if I wasn't in the right conditions for taste a beer. So I promote Edelstoff but i wanna drink it another soon!!"
"Overall nice, lighter but good flavors, good malt and mash profile, fairly tasty and very drinkable."
"Drinkability - This is where this lager was at its best. I can't imagine how good this would be on tap but even from the bottle this is a terrific session bier."
"Overall very enjoyable. Goes great with a German meal."
"This beer is really similar to the Lagerbier Hell (almost same taste and aroma) but it has much more to say in my opinion. It has the great drinkability of a classic german lager but it also has the fullfilling mouthfeel that is peculiar with the ""great"" beers. A very fine Lager"
"Potent for what it is. Hugely enjoyable."
"A malt forward lager. Next to Lagerbier from the same brewery, this is less hoppy, not as dry, lively or balanced and all around bigger. Does cloy a bit, though."
"D: The beer is easy to drink and rather sessionable."
"This is a very good lager. Usually I don't like Exportbier because it's too sweet, but the Edelstoff is balanced and highly drinkable. Augustiner makes some great beer."
"thumbs-up"
"It would be easy to drink a few of these by themselves or with some good German cuisine."
"D - If all lagers tasted like this, I would be drinking them way more often!!! Amazing flavor without the dreaded skunky green bottle aroma associated with the major German beers. Great body and very clean mouthfeel. For a lager this is very flavorful. Highly sessionable!! Just sad this is the only one I have."
"drinkability; a very refreshing Helles, not the best I've ever had but still pleasant. The flavors blend really well, not overpowering, and this makes for a good session drink."
"Good aroma and raw ingredients. Most of the flavors can be uniquely distinguished. Good quality and a fine beer."
"Bottle may be good but nothing beats having a fresh glass poured from tap at the Augustiner Keller, right around the corner and down a few blocks from the Munich HauptBahnhof. Thirst quenching, delicious, sweet, maltly, clean aroma. No carbonation activity in my glass. Just abstract lacing down the glass. Like staring up at clouds and looking for hidden meanings. Like drinking cold gold for sure. Go there."
"Pours a golden yellow crystal clear color with a small 1 finger white head. Has a nice amount of carbonation stemming from the base of the glass. Really pretty lacing as each sip goes down. The aroma is sweet biscuity malts with a malt freshness coming through that is very European in nature. Has a crisp flavor profile. Really nice lemony bitterness followed by sweet malts like toast with butter. Great mouthfeel. Overall easy as hell drinking and smooth all the way through. Would love to get more of this. Not as good as the traditional helles by a little bit, but really good nonetheless."
"I've read that this beer is kind of hard to get here in the states, as there is only one distributer of it. This makes me all the happier to have been able to try it. It's tasty, kind of reminicent of Paulaner with more flavor. Recommended."
"Medium malty body with crisp carbonation."
"D: One of the more complex imported Helles I've had. I think it would be a sight to see/taste in Munich proper, but it's held up well. Overpriced though IMO a $18-20 a 6er."
"This was easy to drink, though I expected more flavor. I thought it was a bit thin and watery and there could have been more flavor."
"D: A great representation of the style. Flavor and balance along with a great feel. Pretty wure I could drink a lot."
"Very drinkable. Nice to drink a tasty low abv beer, not everything needs to be extreme if it's done well, and this is done well. If only this were on tap over here all summer instead of American macros."
"Give it a try!"
"Unfortunately, this beer pales in comparison to Augustiner's Lagerbier Hell, which is excellent where this one is pretty average. I drank two bottles trying to come up with anything that would distinguish it as a beer, and I got nothing. I'd rather not repeat the experience."
"Poured in a pils glass for a clear golden body and a small fizzy head. Dry, airy pils malt with some graininess and leafy, bitter hops. Easy to drink light bodied beer that has a little sweetness that is the backdrop of a strong pils malt presence along some dry, citric hops. Simple but refreshing."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink. Should get this instead of any light, American pilsner."
"Pours a golden hue with a bright white head, leaves 2-3 fingers worth of head space. Fine even lacing very nice look to it. Aroma has a light lemongrass/herbal hop note with light biscuit malts, slight metallic edge from the hard water. Flavor is great a fresh easy drinking helles lager right out of Munich. Light biscuit/crackers from the malts, herbal lively slghtly citric hops in the background refreshing as all hell. Very clean drinking experience this is an art form. Mouthfeel is light bodied carbonation is sturdy and natural never heavy on the palate no harshness to be had here. Drinkability is grab a sixer type of beer, at least a six. Great for the summer I'm glad fresh Edelstoff showed up at my local."
"Poured a silver foiled 12oz bottle into my Smokestack goblet. I have to say, I love the cap underneath the silver foil. It has a awesome little monk with a beer. It's pretty cool. Definitely will go into my collection of my favorites. This beer pours a fizzy straw with a massive 3 inch, foamy white head that leaves no lacing whatsoever. The aroma has a definite green bottle funk, which is odd, because its in a brown bottle. After the sulfur comes a little pilsner malts, and some grassy hops. The flavor is exactly the same. It really is a clean lager. No huge flavors, but at the same time no off flavors at all. The mouthfeel is light and crisp, finishing rather dryly. Overall, its a good lager. Nothing to right home about but great on a hot day."
"Overall, it was a good beer but it didn't stick out as something I would search for."
"D: a great Helles that is both refreshing and flavorful. Definitely worth trying if you are in to German lagers."
" D- This beer has a nice smooth beer but there is some nice depth of flavor for such a light beer. And it has a nice freshness to the crisp malt flavor."
"The drinkability is at high levels"
"D - goes down very easy."
"Taste: spritz of carbonation of front, then mostly flavorless. Light in body, Very drinkable, but not particularly memorable. Clean. Inoffensive. I'm liking this more as we go. However, Edelstoff doesn't really have anything to set apart for any other lager."
"D: This is a very good Helles lager. Many thanks to the better half for bringing this (along with a few other German brews) in her luggage from Munich. Despite its robust, somewhat raw graininess, this manages excellent drinkability."
"Taste is by all means a soft and neutral malty flavour with a metallic and bitter hoppy ending, not too strong either- the virtues of european delicate blends. medium bodied (surprisingly), although refreshing. a decent beer but nothing to go out of your way for."
"Mouthfeel is light, refreshing, and sparkling. The subdued sweetness really adds to the drinkablity of this brew, making it one of the finer ones I've tried. Is is better than the original Helles, no, but this is the Export, and yo should always keep the best for yourself!"
"D – A very chuggable beer. Especially suitable for das boot, if you’ve got one."
"No great flavour, typical of the style, it is refreshing and lightwieght in the mouthfeel. It does however have an after kick, the alcohol comes in towards the end and leaves a pleasant malty (for a Helles) reminder that you've had a beer."
"It's very refreshing, very light, smooth and sessionable, with a nicely sharp floral hop bite and some nice sweet cracker malts, a little bit of apple. I'll be buying it again!"
"Served from a 12 oz bottle. Pours with a nice big head, that has decent retention and leaves a good amount of lacing. Very nice medium golden appearance, indicative of the style. Good, restrained aroma with pleasant malt presence mixing with tart, slightly sour notes in the background. Taste is very smooth, and moderately subdued. Malt notes again mixing with an unexpected but not unwelcome tartness or sourness in the background. NIce smooth mouthfeel, with restrained carbonation. Extremely drinkable and pleasant. Overall, an excellent beer, and a great representative of the style."
"Dry and low-carbonated beer; neutral, a bit numb palate, distinguished!"
"Drinkability is unbelievable!"
"Drinkability: A person could drink many liters of this beer on a summer day. I wish I discovered this beer in the heat of July."
"D. This one is very drinkabel. I have never had it out of the bottle but out of the barrel it is fresh and goes down very easy. My favorite beer of this style in the world."
"D - Also very drinkable and easy to down. A bit filling from the extra malt I think but a nice beer to session."
"Fresh bottle. Pours clear straw yellow with a fizzy white head that doesn't hold together very well. Smell is lightly sweet and grainy with some faint floral notes. Tastes of pils malt and slightly grassy hops. Very slightly spicy, and fairly sweet overall. Light body with good carbonation. Not a bad helles, just not much character, really."
"Got this in a bottle from the Karstadt grocery store in Munich. The aroma is nice, with a slightly malt-honey accent. Flavor is good, clean, balance tilted towards malt but nice overall. The beer is an easy drinking beer as the style dictates, although I think that tending to usually drink American ales with their variety and aggressive flavors may have my taste buds a bit mis-calibrated."
"It has a grainy and distinctive yeast aroma. It came to my table in a tumbler looking picture perfect. There is a nice transparent golden color to this beer. The head and lace are both well formed. Grass and fruity hop like taste. The body has a bit of carbonation burn but is still easy to drink. A very refreshing beer altogether."
"OVERALL: Another great helles lager bier from Augustiner. In all fairness, I assume this is the same as their vollbier but with a little more pop for the export market. It has a slightly bolder grainy quality and a touch more bitterness in the aftertaste, but the similarities are obvious. The look wasn't quite up to the standards of the vollbier, but this was a top-notch lager from a top-notch brewery."
"Conclusion: Tasty, nicely fruity, but nothing special and (IMO) not quite worth the price for the six pack"
"The drinkability and mouthfeel of this beverage are amazing, it is crisp and very refreshing. Overall well balanced and an enjoying experience that easily welcomes another."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and poor lacing. Smells of slight hops, strong yeast cleanliness, pale malt, and some sweet malt. Fits the style of a Munich Helles Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. The carbonation is too high in my opinion. Tastes of strong yeast cleanliness, slight pale hop, and strong pale male. Overall, a decent lager, but nothing special really."
"Taste is a little maltier than expected, and quite a bit less bitter. Very light. Tastes like your standard, run of the mill lager, but much smoother and with very few offputting flavors at all. Very drinkable, if slightly dull."
"Not nearly as quaffable or smooth as I'd like in this style. Not a bad beer, but I'd imagine this beer, being a delicate style, is 10 times better at the source."
"D: Bavarian lagers are invariably solid, and this is no exception. It's just not worth paying $13+ for a six-pack. Why is this not classified as a Dortmunder/Export?"
"Drinkability: Session Session Session - I wish I could get a keg of this beer on tap. This is the ultimate Lager style beer! I highly recommend if you get your hands on it!"
"The aroma has a hay like grass, paper, latex, and corn malt. The appearance is pale gold with a small head. The flavor is like the aroma and has that euro lager incense taste. The palate is thin. Overall not something I would buy again. I am just not a fan of this despite being to style."
"This is a very good Munich Helles. I still prefer the Weihenstephaner, but this is another fine option."
"woe is me - if only the 6-pack didn't cost a dastardly $16!"
"Drinkability: Overall, the best helles I have tasted and I would love to have more of this beer. I sure can't wait to go back to Munich so I can stockpile the stuff. If you couldn't already tell, it's highly recommended."
"Absolutely, simply great."
"D - Easily drinkable and nicely balanced. This bottled version has held up to the trip across the Atlantic better than I would have expected, but I know from personal experience that it is better still on draught in Munich."
"D: This is a light, easy to drink, flavorful beer. Not exactly in line with the typical Munich helles lager, but very easy to like."
"D - Pretty good. Nothing to complain about, but not so appetizing."
"D: An easy-to-drink lager that doesn't have as much personality as it could -- and as it needs. Nothing really wrong with this brew, but it could have a bit bigger flavor."
"This is a highly quaffable helles lager. It hits all the bases for the style and then some. Wish this was available in Canada. This style is underrated because of its subtlety, deserves higher reviews."
"The taste is a firm, slightly oily bready malt with lots of herb, juniper, lemon. It's lightly sweet with a light, lingering bitter finish. There is a lot going on here, all harmoniously, and it's overall wonderful."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Crisp and dry initially, malty sweetness reveals itself slowly with a touch of floral hop flavor to back it up. The finish is drying again, and only faintly bitter. Simple and straightforward stuff, but clean and very drinkable. I'd love to try this on tap at the brewery."
"It's on the high side of light bodied and the carbonation is on the light side. The drinkability is top notch! Great brew, in my book."
"A nice ""sessionable""/easy-drinking Helles with a good balance to it within the style."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Finish on this one is dry, it works very nicely with the hop flavor-grassy/floral notes and bitterness one of the last components to taste leads to a dry finish. Body is medium and carbonation is delicate and does not get in the way of the brew's flavor. This is one beer that is easy to drink and I can easily be putting a few more of these back in one sitting. On the other hand I'm not sure that this beer is worth the $12.00 for the sixer. There have to be better ones out there that are cheaper....still glad I got to try it. A decent beer that is worth the time to try. Maybe I'll come back to it and maybe I won't...but I'll definitely be looking to other beers of the same style."
"A great Helles, going down clean and quenchingly, but begging for another draught. The quintessential German quaffing brew, perfect for downing in the company of friends, but at a cost of $2.99 a bottle, not quite fitting as the quintessential American session beer."
"Great drinkability, a damn fine helles, was even better (fresher) in Germany if memory serves me.."
"Recommended..."
"This beer is solely worth the trip to Muenchen, let alone any other beer. Augustiner will never let anyone down."
"Overall - A good, clean and very drinkable lager.... nothing groundbreaking but very drinkable... worth a try..."
"Bottle. Light gold color with a full wispy head that lasts well. Aroma shows fresh malt (butter, light grain, husk) with perhaps a touch of lemon from the hops. Smells pretty pure and clean. Flavor also shows purity, with no off flavors. Solid hop bitterness and really nicely balanced. It's a nice beer."
"It's OK, but especially at the price (by far the most expensive German beer at the store), this one is not worth it. Maybe on tap in Munich, but not in Riverside."
"D - easy to drink, but I probably won't get it again"
"Very easy to drink, a true session beer and well worth the $10.99 a six-pack. This is generally a great beer. No fills... great flavor. I'd love to try this on draft... is it available anywhere? Still, I am very happy I can buy this locally. Recommended."
"D: Overall drank like a sweetened festbier, though a tad to much so for multiples. More macro then micro."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Prickly and animated on the tip of the tongue, then becoming slick like the foam at the edge of a mellow wave down the Jersey shore. A textural pleasure, and an all-day drinker without a doubt. A little more punch on the palate would really have driven this score up a notch."
"D- This is a great session beer. This is the epitome of a great helles beer."
"M&D: mildly carbonated and refreshing enough on the texture - this is a very decent Helles with a healthy balance and lovely aftertaste."
"Looks a brilliant, clear gold with a white head. Smells of bland, sweet malts with a little yeast character. There's more malt and a little hop character in the flavor, making for a beer that's just a step above your average Euro pale lager. Not bad, just not very complex. Washes down Mexican quesadillas loaded with peppers quite nicely."
"Pours a clear straw gold. Some white head that does not stick around. Nice airy clean nose, with not a lot punching my senses really. Flavor has a good profile. Nice earthy and grainy qualities to it. No skunk. No metal. Smooth. Feel has a fair amount of carbonation in there. Liquid feel is fairly thick as well, but in a lager sense of it all. Definitely drinkable. Smooth and fairly well bodied."
"Drinkability: A very nice refreshing beer from one of Munich's best breweries"
"Thierry (13/10/2007)"
"To my mind this is an eminently drinkable beer. It is flavorful, yet dangerously easy to swallow. Very refreshing. It also made me think quite a good deal about what the average B.A. expects from a 'quality' brew. Most of us are looking for the extreme hop punch, a beer over the top in bitterness and A.B.V. But for many others around the world who appreciate good beer, more moderate flavors are appealing. A quaffable, but very flavorful brew, one that can be enjoyed either in bulk or moderation is not a bad thing. I think sometimes many of us hold strong to our 'bigger is better/'more bang for the buck' attitudes and forget about the values of moderation, simplicity and subtleness. Augustiner Edelstoff is a very fine beer, yet I feel that many BAs sadly would not share this opinion."
"Overall a very tasty helles. Good representation of the style."
"P.S.: I am not sure the style is described correctly, I would rather believe this to be an Export style .."
"Taste is a little malty with a whiff of hoppiness. I can taste some cinnamon, not something I ever tasted in a lager. The yeast produces a clean beer. Body is medium to thin. A rather disappointing beer, rather un-German, drinkability is good, but lacks in the malt and hop department."
"Just wish i could get this on tap locally! Will need to move to Munchen!"
"I'm betting it's going to be some delicious smelling drool."
"Zum Wohl!!"
"I had this on tap at the Augustiner Keller beer hall in Munich. The appearance was muted straw color, a little murky but mostly clear, with a massively thick head (I always see this head in the 1L beer mugs in Munich). The aroma was mostly malts, a little bit like fresh baked bread, just a hint of hops. The flavor is biscuity and bready malt, slightly sweet and very lightly bitter in the after-taste. Extremely drinkable and I would have ordered another except I wanted to try some other beers of Munich in my short stay."
"Definitely clean and drinkable, flavor lingers nicely, but never announce themselves."
"D - Yes, yes and yes. Great beer."
"Raw in your face noble hop aroma. Just amazing. Poured a tiny bright white head that disappeared when I looked away. Transparent pale golden beer holds a few lazily rising bubbles. The pale malts provide a lightly sweet base that balances out the earthy/grassy hop flavors. The hop flavors intensify in the finish as they are joined by a nice bitter bite. It has a solid and crisp mouthfeel. The hop flavor doesn't approach the strength of the aroma, but that could be a good thing. In the end this is one nice beer."
"PROST! Beertracker"
"D: Not sure about this one. I enjoyed its easy drinkability, but flavor was somewhat of a concern. Lagers are on the whole more subtle, but I found myself searching for the characteristics of this beer too hard. Still, refreshing and light, to say the least."
"(Edit: the imported bottle version is also wonderful. It's held up remarkably well, so definitely grab it, too.)"
"I havent tasted many helles lager beers before so unfortunately I cant compare this to many other of this style."
"D: Drinkable, but not the best Helles Ive had from a bottle here in the State. Im sure having this on tap in Germany (or here) would be much better."
"It is what it is. This is, from those who have ""tried them all"" in Munich, the ""Konig"" of the helles lagers. Great clarity in the glass, nice white foamy head that doesn't last long. A bit of hops in the nose and the taste is a very well balanced malt with delicate floral hops. The mouthfeel leaves a lot to be desired but it is oh so drinkable and smooth. Such a treat. Clearly a step down from ""out of the barrel"" in Munich, but worth buying."
"All and all, very drinkable. I preferred this one to the Helles actually."
"This poured out a bright golden color, with a bright white head and lacing that lasts longer than Dr. Cox's speeches on Scrubs. The nose had some fresh grain, a little hops, and some fruity apple type notes. The taste was super clean, some biscuit maltyness, and a sort of apple sauce/apple cider thing going on faint in the background. Drinks very refreshing and clean, with a crisp dry mouthfeel."
"Cheers!"
"D - Overall this is a good outdoor, hot summer day beer. Nothing particularly outstanding but definitely nothing wrong with this beer."
"Mouthfeel was mildly zesty and medium bodied. Easy to drink but not especially interesting."
"Drinkability: a light and easy to drink beer, but flavor profile is a bit milder than expected. Definitely a refreshing summer beer."
"Poured a pale yellow color with modest white head. Head rapidly fell to a very thin ring with no lacing. Smell is very light with slight summer fruit notes present. Taste shows a nice firm maltiness that is extraordinarily refreshing. KLeaves a very tantanlizing taste in the mouth. Really a nice example of the style."
"D - easily poundable, high drinkability"
"Drinkability in very good. went well with grilled chicken and brats with Mexican rice. MK"
"Pale golden color with an inch high head which dwindles to near nothingness and leaves scant lacing. Bready aroma with notes of sharp herbal acidity. Taste matches aroma. Body is light and weak and the flavors as well are quite light and weak. Plus they really aren't too enjoyable. A slight buttery breadiness holds the body while the hops, which are grassy, come into the finish. Lower carbonation smooths the beer out but really also bores any taste. I'm disappointed."
"This is the slightly stronger version of the AUGUSTINER HELL, a bit more estery but still smooth. This is also served at the OKTOBERFEST, there with 6% ABV, called ""Wies'n-EDEL""! I personally, when in Muenchen, prefer the HELL! Well done brewers!"
"I tasted this brew on tap at the Augustiner Grostgastatte, Munich recently. I did not take notes for a review, but it offered so much more than what I have written above. More bitter then the Helles, but very worthwhile. Maybe it's a beer that does not travel."
"Overall: Completely non-descript, a little weak in the flavor department. These guys can do better in the style; we know they can!"
"A very good German lager. Lightly flavored and textured. Aromas are crisp and light. Medium maltiness and a bit grainy, but not bad. Flavors of mint and Granny-smith apples spice the beer up a bit. Still light and clean on the palate. Finishes crisp and clean. It could have a bolder malt and hop profile, but not if it means less crispnenss. It's better than most German Lagers."
"Drinkability was just average. Better than some, but it didn't stand out."
"This beer pours a crystal clear pale gold with a two-finger rocky snow white head. It does look a touch washed out but thankfully that does not translate to the aroma or flavor. This is perfectly balanced in every way and gets significant yet pleasant contributions from the bready malt and the hops. A grassy quality dominates but there are some surprisingly nice gentle fruity elements, apples and pears, as well. The best part is how fresh and creamy it all comes across. The moderate carbonation and bitterness make for a dangerously easy drinking experience, but my preference would be that both could be a bit higher. Still, it is a heck of a beer."
"BB 01-06. Great presance with good and lasting head and full golden and cristal clear beer. Wonderfull nose also with lots of finest maltyness and great hops that are hard to define but perfume the beer great. Not much esters or yeastinfluence except for the alcohol but yeah great nose. As is taste that's full, litle sweet and very malty, good hops and litle alcoholic. Woww with this not too high carbonisation also a heaven like mouthfeel. Well what can you say a perfect sessionbeer IMO."
"Pours a clear gold with a one finger stark white head. The head does not linger for long and becomes a thin white layer on top of the beer. Aroma is crisp with hints of cracker bread and a touch of grassy spicyness. Taste is crisp clean and smooth. A bit of malty sweetness up front, followed nicely with some drying slightly bitter hops. By no means hoppy, but the hops crisp up this beer nicely. Mouthfeel is a bit heavier than I would have guessed. Nice tight carbonation keeps this from leadening the tongue. Drinkability is good. A very good session Helles on a hot day."
"A mildly sweet and mellow maltiness delicately balances with a drying and crisp hoppiness. A taste of limes and hint of minty herbs provide a very nice, clean and refreshing finish. An ever so faint fine vodka fuminess is noticeable. This is a world-class Lager and an excellent representation of the style."
"Final Thought: This is disappointing from a World Class Brewery, but I had to try it for the price and availability over here in Germany."
"Some hop in the aftertaste, even if it is still dominated by the maltiness."
"Pours a pale straw color with a fluffy eggshell colored head. Doughy, hay-like, pale malt aromas, some German noble hops and a hint of musty yeast. Crisp and effervescent with a rich maltiness and a light astringency in the finish. Easy drinking and enjoyable. A slight bit heftier than your average helles."
"Did not enjoy this beer any more than I would a Miller or Bud Light. Other than nice head retention, there were no appealing qualities in its looks. Received this as part of a Beer of the World's Mix pack and am not sure how long it may have been on the shelves. Tastes of sweet corn maltiness that got a little better as it lost some of its chill. Not recommended."
"Great session beer. Poured into a pint glass it gave about a one inch head that dissapated fairly quickly. It has a clean, light golden color. It couldn't be any more drinkable. There is a light lemon undertone and simply tastes like a helles lager should."
"Medium body with mild carbonation; smooth and clean. Easy summer beach beer, or something to start the day off with. Session beer all the way."
"John"
"Found this beer at the House of Gluntz here in Chicago. This place is, if I remember correctly (the original facility of) Chicago's first and oldest distributer (they have a great beer book by the way), dating back to 1888. They mostly have wine in the place, but when I asked for cold beer they pointed to a hidden little cooler that was busy chilling this here beer, a few awesome cheeses and a sprinkling of wine. Anyway, a cool part of local history. This here beer poured a simple buttery golden and sported a decent head and some lace-all retreated in a minute to a cup of yellow fizzy water. Aromas were decent for the style featuring fresh malty grain, as well as a lemony hop profile. the mouthfeel was nicely crisp, yet a trifle cloying. The beer does taste good, and is more complex than most for the style. Flavors run fairly deep as the generous grain notes give way to a fairly long hop component which rewards the taster with a cleansing bitter finish. This is a fine beer to start with, but it begs for a gear change after two."
"Drinkability: I generally don't like light lagers of any kind. I can drink them and appreciate them, but I enjoy maltier, fuller-bodied brews. But this is a very nice beer. I see beer writers like Michael Jackson describe beers as ""soft"" and ""rounded," and I've always wondered what that means. I think this is a good example of both. It's a simple, yet sublime, beer."
"Zum wohl!"
"This was a beer I havent seen before and decided to pick it up,ours an extremely pale yeloow with a light wispy head,aroma is softly malty with a light hop bitterness that lingers.A very clean refreshing tasting brew with some mild cracker maltiness although I thought it was a tad watery in the finish and body.A real easy drinker here it would be great on a hot summer day."
"Pale golden with a slight murk. Dense, uniform, pure white head leaves coating lace. Soft, doughy, underbaked cracker with sweetly herbal wafts of Hallertauer dominate the aroma. Hints of husky grain provide a dryish, rustic contrast. Flavorwise, it's a facsimile of the aroma. The dominant malt components are notes of sweet, white cracker, although subtle toasted notes abound. Mildly bittered, thus leaving a pleasant, gentle residual sweetness. Hop flavor is both grassy and herbal, with suggestions of mild, sweet basil. Lightly bodied overall, but gently dextrinous and smooth in mouthfeel. Becomes sweeter as it warms, with sugar cookie hints lingering agreeably. Finishes mostly clean, with a tinge of oxidation derived almond. A delicate, refined helles with superb drinkability. Potentially world class if found fresh. Is this on tap anywhere?"
"I tried this at the Augustiner Keller in Munchen. This is a refreshing helles with much character. The taste is clean with a notes of doughiness and mild hops, while the mouthfeel remains crisp all the while. This is an easy drinker and is suitable for all occasions."
"Maybe a bad bottle. Augustiner makes some excellent brews but this one was a bit off. Tart bitter not what one would expect from a Munich lager. The dates were fine and this was a beer actually drank and bought in Munich. Hoppy finish with little malt balance throughout the entire bottle, like I said must have been a bad bottle."
"This .5 L bottle poured a crisp-clear and quite a light yellow (paler than a golden-pils but deeper than many a mass-produced lager). Nice carbonation level provided a large white head starter, but quickly faded. Aroma was of sweet-beer but not pronounced. This beers very pale yellow color belies its actual taste: bold, malty goodness that is enjoyable, friendly to the tongue and drinkable. I imagine a beer like this must be brewed with some very fine home-grown Bavarian malts indeed. After drinking fair amounts of porters, stouts, dubbels, spiced beers and such, this is a beer original that will remind you of one single essence of beer: grain / barley malt."
"335"
"Another fresh local Munich brew served at Augustiner Grossgaststatte Bierhalle. I could've stayed here a lot longer enjoying the friendly atomosphere, the people and the beer here. Edelstoff is actually an export version of the Helles. Golden, clear brew. Straw, grassy hop, biscuity aroma and flavor. Nice peppery hop, dry finish."
