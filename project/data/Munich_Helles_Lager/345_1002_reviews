"Close to 10 years of cra ft beer geekdom living in both the philly suburbs and south central PA and I have yet to try this Victory offering...  Looking around for something new and unpretentious, this called out to me today from the shelves...  An average pour yields slightly less than a fingers worth of audibly fizzy crisp off-white colored froth that displays minimal to no retention...  It leaves behind a thin veil of splotchy lacing an thin collar...  The color is an exceedingly pale golden straw...  A light to moderate bit of average paced carbonation rises randomly throughout...  The nose is simple and clean...  Loaded with rich bready malts and cereal grains...  A light euro hop presence...  On the palate this one is a bit of a subdued version of the nose...  Perhaps you can mix in a touch of lemon zest as well...  The mouthful is on the fuller side of light bodied...  A bit thin...  A very limited bit of carbonation bite...  Goes down rather uneventfully...  A simple and somewhat enjoyable beer, but in the future I'd much rather opt for the Prima Pils, Stoudt's Gold or a Sly Fox offering to itch my Pennsylvania German lager itch..."

"12oz. bottle served in a pilsener glass.  Enjoy by 15 Jun 2015 printed on the label.  Pours a straw gold with no head, just a soapy, fizzy slick.  Copious tiny bubbles are seen effervescing in-solution.  Nose expresses cereal grains and a light, grassy quality.  Taste follows nose - fairly clean with a faint sour mash skunk towards the back.  Mouthfeel is light in body with a lively carbonation and a crisp finish.  Overall, simple, refreshing and quite drinkable."

"Tolerable but uninspired, it's like they weren't trying. I sense there's a reason this was removed from the variety pack."
"This is a decent lager, a statement that for me is often an oxymoron.  It meets the criteria for a Munich helles lager in most details, except for the presence of chill haze.   Not only does it meet criteria well, it also tastes pretty good.  I may have to buy some more of this."

"This new product is so average and tasteless."

"O: Admittedly, lagers are NOT my favorite style. In fact, they're one of my least favorite styles, BUT I can appreciate when someone hits the nail on the head and brews a good one; that's exactly what Victory has done here. There's nothing over the top here. There's no flavors that'd scare away a BMC drinker. This is a just a pure, clean, highly enjoyable lager. I look forward to bringing this with me to BBQs during the summer months."

"EBD 3/4/14. Clear light golden pour with a nice head and normal lacing. Laid back nose of what strikes me as Hallertau hops, very slight. Light medium body with light carbonation. This is a nice Helles that is to style. The taste is laid back, as is the nose, and light with the expected effervescence. A slight sweetness coupled with a bit of hop flavor and bitterness constitutes the flavor profile. Crisp and clean finish with a touch of lingering bitterness."
""
""
"O: The aroma may not have been up to snuff, but the actual taste of the beer was. And that's all I really care about. There's nothing like a good lager in the right mood, and this hit that 'right mood' extremely well."

"O: A pretty good stab at the Helles style. Not as honed as the best of them, but it's free of flaws and drinks nicely. Pretty good stuff, I could see a six pack disappearing quickly on a nice day."
""
""
"O-A boring, bland, nothing new lager. No reason to have other than the tick."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not a bad beer, but there are Munich Helles' that are much better. Not a bad flavor, and I'd drink this again, but probably wouldn't buy it. Decent beer, but there are many better Munich Helles', Spaten, Lowenbrau, Hofbrau, and others."

"Overall a step up from BMC and just enough flavor to impress a craft veteran like me this beer has it all. Give it a try."

"O: This beer is easy to drink and very well balanced. It is a good representation of the style. I could drink this all day long if I was sitting in a biergarten."
"O: Very enjoyable and easy to drink, reminds me of sitting in a biergarten enjoying a pleasant afternoon. The lighter body, low ABV (which is well hidden), and enjoyable flavors make this one I would definitely have again."
""
"Notes: Very drinkable all around good for anytime of year but even better for a warm day. Cheers."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is malty, slightly sweet. Taste is crisp, malts, some grains, refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent brew, probably best enjoyed in warmer weather."

"The flavor starts off sweet grains, slight spicy hops towards the end. Some biscuity, honey, lemony. Body is light, very crisp. Medium carbonation. Dry finish and aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The palate is better. Opening with a firm bitterness, lemony, dusty and snappy (though not quite as nice as in Summer Love) flavors follow. Grainy and doughy for the most part, with a touch of honey, the malt character is quite nice, and nicely complements the hops. Drying, grainy and bitter on the finish with a mild mineral character that actually tastes like it might be a combination of the earthy hops and the carbonic acid. I really like the hop profile of this beer. Light in body without being watery, this beer has a medium-high level of carbonation (appropriately enough) and a drying finish that's mildly hoppy and mildly grainy. Very nice, recommended."
"This beer has a golden color body with a small fizzy head that quickly disaptes ton a very,very thin lace around the edge. The smell has a lemony, malt aroma to it. The taste is well balanced with malt and some lemon hop flavor to it. It is well carbonated with a nice mouth feel, no after taste. Over all this is a nice easy drinking beer."
"Pale yellow in color with a slight chill haze. Poured with a short fizzy white foam that quickly dissipated leaving no cap or lacings. Toasted malt, biscuit, and light lemon hop aromas. Medium bodied with assertive, but not fizzy, refreshing carbonation. Toasted malt with biscuit flavors up front with a tangy, citrus lemon hop bite through the middle. Finishes crisp and dry with a biscuit malt aftertaste."
""
""
""
"Flavor is crisp and grainy -- picture-perfect for a lager. This one's rich and full-flavored, though, not at all watery. Maybe not to the same level as Victory's Prima Pils, but definitely a delicious and enjoyable lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Color is a light transparent gold, with a thin pale white head that fades quickly. The smell is mainly citrus with a bit of freshly baked bread. Nice, but I wish it were stronger. The taste is much like the smell - heavily citrus with a touch of bread. This has a stronger citrus taste than probably any other lager I've had. Very crisp, drinkable, and refreshing. Certainly a big step above most mainstream lagers."
""
"O - Good summer beer, but Victory has so many other better brews I would never get this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours golden with a long lasting, foamy, white head. Aroma is of grassy hops and biscuit malt. Body is light-medium and crisp. Light grassy hops and biscuit malt with hints of lemon combine on the palate. Finish is long and slightly bitter. Nice, easy drinking, tasty helles."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this one is very bland. I guess drinkable but not for the flavor."
"Served in a 0.3L German-style tumbler, Victory lager pours a crystal clear golden brown color with a nice cap of foamy white head that retains well, and leaves just a bit of soapy lacing. Aroma of light German malts, light floral hops, basic, no nonsense. Taste follows the aroma, pale malts, crackery grains, floral hops, crisp, clean, nothing complex or amazing, but it's a standard lager, so what more can you ask for? Light body, and goes down as smooth as anything. For the style, this is a very good beer. If you want something simple and extremely easy to drink, yet miles ahead of the macro market, look no further."

"The beer poured a clear pale yellow with a nice white head that produced a small white, foamy head. The beer gave off a nice grain aroma with a hint of citrus hops, I think. The taste of the beer was good, mostly grainy, but overall the beer was well balanced. The beer had a light, clean and crisp feel and it was extremely easy to drink. I had a couple without even noticing. Overall, a fine example of the style from one of the best breweries."
""
""
"Crystal clear corn hue in body with a white top that fades fast. Smells of floral notes, a dab of honey, and some hops. Tastes of floral, honey, some hop bitterness towards the finish. Light in body with light carbonation. Pleasant and easily quaffable. Nice."

"A rather nice lager - a light, slightly hoppy flavour puts this a cut above industrial fare. Refreshing; would be great on a hot day. Too bad it's a bit expensive over here for everyday drinking. Worth sampling."

"lagers usually bore my palate, and this one is really no different, except for the fact that it is so damn good. it is crisp as can be, has more than a watery body, and is not a corn beer. it pours light and thin, but has enough to it that it works with big food. it is really refreshing with that german style malting that leaves it flavorful and distinct. helles style i believe. wouldnt chose it over most other victory beers, but this one is proof that a golden lager made in the USA can still excite from time to time."

"O: easy drinking Munich Helles, decent for the style, good for me"
"O: Not that complex at all, but then it does hit all the style notes well. If six packs were cheaper, I'd buy this more."
"Pours a clear golden with a high white head. The smell robust yet crisp grain, with some herbal and floral notes. The taste is clean malt, crisp hops, sweet grainy notes, some mineral tang. It's sharply carbonated, slightly viscous. All in all an excellent Helles, easy to drink and very satisfying."
"Lighter body, higher carbonation, tingly and a little dry on the tongue. A solid, drinkable lager once again from Victory."
"A nice example of the style overall, just about what one could hope for."
"O: Incredibly easy drinking and a prime candidate for a gateway beer for your BMC drinking buddies. Highly sessionable and light on the palette."
"Taste is light and crisp with some biscuit grain and a fair amount of bright hops...both flavoring and bittering. I like this beer quite a bit, not necessarily a classic helles, but damn is it refreshing and tasty. I would have no problem finishing off a sixer of this in a day. Tasty, clean and interesting...just what I want in a nice lager. Excellent beer, I see a repeat purchase in my very near future."
"Light to medium body, slightly heavier than your average lager. Crisp, clean taste but some slight lingering of barley malts in the finish. Hops add the crispness and have a small bittering effect that balances out the barley. Definitely a twinge of citrus in the taste, adding a level of complexity that you don't find in a whole lot of lagers. Higher carbonation adds to the crispness. This is just a beer that is not overly complex, but they definitely paid attention to the details and brewed a solid lager with more flavor than most others you'll find out there. Definitely no off adjunct flavors, probably the best part of this beer. Great for a hot summer day that calls for a light and refreshing beer that tastes pretty damn good too."
"O: Really good lager. Too bad craft breweries don't put out more examples of these beers."
"As you may know I am generally not a fan of plain ol' lagers(the non-pilsener and non-Oktoberfest kind), so I did not expect much from this. That said, it is what it is. Not supposed to be extraordinary, just an everyday-type session brew. It's rather average at that, because I know there's better offerings in this style out there."
"A good easy drinking beer. A smooth sutle malt forward style that's sure to please."
"On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear light gold with a white head. Nose is fairly mild ,with a pleasant fresh grain and a light hop note. Mouth is snappy, bright, super fresh grain and a kiss of sweet malt. A touch grassy in its hop element. This was one I overlooked for awhile but it's just fantastic. Understated, extraordinarily well balanced. Of course criminally underrated. One of the best lagers I've ever had, up there with Victory's best pilsners. They are masters with this style."
"Overall a good example of a lawn mower beer."
"Pours a very clear goldenrod color that resembles a very watery American lager. The head is fluffy and white but disappears in a blink. Smells a bit more German than it appears with a little pepper and grain. The taste is so much betters than the look and scent. If I saw this beer in a glass not knowing what it was I would pass it by buy the flavor is on point. I get grainy breaded malts, herbal hop notes and that peppery feel that is necessary for the style. Carbonation is lower but very striking and the beer goes down easy buy it gets too sweet as it warms so it's a gulper. Overall a good representation but could be a little cheaper I'm my opinion for what it is."
"D - Clean and well balanced with a decent malt character. This is a drinkable Helles, but not as flavorful as some others that I have had."
"Overall: A pleasant, likable all-malt lager."
"A nice, old-school aspect to this beer. Light gold/caramel color with good head retention. Moderate bittering with a bit of fresh grain popping through in the middle. Finish is even, with the barest hint of honey sweetness. Could be a little smoother around the edges, but overall quite nicely done."
"this is definitely better on tap. Had both on a trip out to allentown. An intense pride for victory out there. And they are the best brewery by volume in my opinion so i'm all for it. Few do it like then quality wise. Mass production worldlyness isn't easy. And with that said... This is a great brew with an american yeast augmentation... Or accent. Look is good. Some subdued head but i can't tell if it was due to the humidity. Gold clear pour. Nice hay and bubble gummy esters. Export sweet nose. Palate is dry... But not pilsner. Nice balance. apple rind, bubble gum and hay. Dry nice balence and some porter grape hopping but with a brisk finish that has hints of biscuit."
"O: This is a very good brew, perfect for summer cookouts."
"Overall: Again, I am very impressed by this beer. I just hope I can find some fresher examples!"
"D - Fantastic representation of the style, especially for an American brewery. Plan on enjoying this again in the future."
"Overall, wonderful flavors but the delicacy and smoothness make this borderline too chuggable. Even when I'm looking to get trashed I want to savor a beer a bit. But still very delicious and a sure recommendation for someone who hates hops."
"O: This one was in dire need of a little something special to make it interesting. Meh..."
"This beer was a nice looking light copper color. The head was fizzy and white. Kind of faded off after a few minutes. The aromas here are oh hops and malt pretty much. There might be a little wooden aromas too but not much. The flavor is pretty hoppy, there is a little bit of a earthy tone in the aftertaste. The malts leave some dryness behind as well. The mouthfeel is quite drinkable. This beer is pretty good and deserves a try."
"Future edit in mind."
"Overall - this is a very well made, true to Munich style lager. Easy drinker, with pleasant light flavorings. Anyone and everyone can enjoy this brew whether your a BA or not."
"D: Not great. Packaged in a mized case with Hopdevil, Prima Pils, and Golden Monkey, I know which beer will be my last resort every time I visit the fridge."
"Victory V Lager is a cloudy, pale yellow beer with a small white head that quickly dissipates. It has a soft herbal aroma. It smells a little sweet and corny and very faint. It's light bodied and foamy with a dry finish that's kind of chalky. It has hardly any flavor. There may be a touch of lemon and mint or catnip. There is no bitterness. Sorry, Victory, I've peed better beer. This is an obvious attempt to make a Superbowl beer and they nailed it."
"Pours a clear golden-straw color with a short white head. Carbonation bubbles are apparent. Head does not stick around for all that long. The nose is a bit grainy with some pilsner malt and a bit of floral and herbal hops. The taste brings a bit more of the hop components of the nose along with some grain in the background. Light body with good carbonation and a dry finish. Drinks quite well; very quaffable. This is a nice session brew."
"Beer is thin and wet with a decent finish with a mild acidity that I kind of wish wasn't there. I think this is more like a Czech pils than a Helles. It has nearly nothing between the lead off sweetness and the finishing acidity. No middle ground flavors. It's definitely not bad and since it's a German lager not only would I have more of it I would drink a case one day."
"Very drinkable, though i could see some of the flavors sticking around too long for more than a few."
"I was given a few of these at a family dinner over the holidays. This brewery is local, but I've never had this before and was looking forward to it. I popped the cap and poured, and was instantly disappointed. Very little head, and a cheap beer color. The smell wasn't all that pleasing, and the taste was worse. easily the worst microbrew lager I've had. Thank God I didn't have to pay for it. I never will, not when I can buy Yuengling for less and not ever be wishing I didn't."
"Although I typically drink hoppier beers I'm always happy to see this beer in my fridge on a hot day."
"Notes: If it had more body and had a better look and smell I am sure my ratings would have been higher. This is a reasonable alternative to other lagers but I think that there are better ones out there in the craft beer world. Thanks again to Bruce for seeing to it that I was able to try this one tonight!"
"Overall this is another very good lager from Victory. Very smooth and I wish I had access to this more regularly. Very well worth a shot."
"Despite its flaws on appearance and smell I still enjoyed this beer. It still loses to the better German Brands and Stoudt's Gold Lager but I'd definitely session this one."
"excellent drinkability. id love to session this beer but its hard to find in sixers, picked this up as a single. worth a try if you can find it, but i wouldnt really go out of my way to drink it again."
"D: One of the better lagers I've had. Bravo, Victory."
"This is not nearly as good as Prima Pils but it's a very well done lager from Victory. They know how to do nice German lagers, that is for sure. My only complaints are that this is a bit uneven; head is very disappointing and the feel is off a bit, but where it really counts - flavor - this one delivers."
"I've moved on to other styles, but recently revisited my first. It poured golden and clear with little head and slight effervescence. Clean sweet aroma and crisp, clean malt flavor. On the watery side compared to other styles, but fine for a lager. Overall, very drinkable."
"A nice, easy drinking Helles Lager."
"Overall - I think this beer could use a tad bit more flavor and mouthfeel to be a truly great lager, but it's still pretty good. Good interpretation of the Munich Helles style."
"very easy drinking. refreshing."
"Served to me cold, with a full fluffy white head. Gold in color with sharp clarity. Smells pretty good. Bread, hay, and honey. Palate is quite sweet with a good honey and cracker malt flavor. Finishes with just a touch of grassy hop flavor. Overall, a strong option when in search of a refreshing mild flavored lager, without adjuncts."
"Okay carbonation. Very light bodied, watery. Very straightforwardly nice but kinda light on flavor almost to the point of blandness, though that makes it really easy to drink and to drink a lot of it. I think it is okay, but far from the class of say Weihenstephaner Original Premium even though that had to make a trip from overseas."
"Some times I tend to forget about lagers and more sessionable ""simple"" beers. This is probably the best lager I've ever had. Might be a new summer go to beer. If only BMC could make a lager with this much flavor."
"The beer's a lot better than I anticipated - ""lager", at least as far as US beers go, conjures up ill feelings. I seriously need to, in the future, match this up with the cream of the crop in this style (i.e. German). Great summer beer. Chicks will dig it, too."
"Overall Victory wins again I love these guys from my home state and this is a nice summertime beer for the heat we're having and a fine Helles."
"D - It's a very clean, full-flavored helles lager. That alone makes it more drinkable that most other beers. It's very fresh tasting and very good. It's awesome to have such good examples of German styles made a few hours away."
"Unfortunately when i poured this beer there was virtually no head to speak of. It is straw colored and pretty clear. The nose has some grain in it, and maybe a hint of spicy hops. The grainyness in the nose carries through to the taste with a minimal amount of diacetyl butteryness, a bit of an off flavor for a lager like this, but not unpleasant. There is good medium-light mouthfeel for this one. Good enjoyable, but not exceptional beer."
"D - light and drinkable, a bit malt-heavy for my taste but seems to suit the style pretty well. will make good work of the other 5 bottles from my Victory variety pack in this weather."
"This is certainly a drinkable beer and a nice try at a Helles lager, but, when paired alongside the superior Prima Pils, it falls flat."
"Cold from bottle to pint glass, this lager is a clear golden color with steady carbonation, a fair white cover and modest lacing. The aroma suggsts a slightly sour mash idea with a little leafy hop. The flavor brings a pretty watery apple cider malt with a mild hop bite. The taste isn't bad but it's kind of wimpy with carboard hints and maybe a touch of toffee. The constitution of this lager even reminds me at times of watermelon. The hop finish keeps it interesting, otherwise it's forgettable but fairly drinkable. It works."
"Overall, nothing here is overpowering. A well balanced and frighteningly easy beer to drink. Load up the cooler with a six pack of these."
"Victory Lager poured a bright golden color with almost no head. Even though it was a fresh bottle, it smelt a little skunked, and veery light. It tasted like a traditional lager but very light. The flavors were barley noticable. Overall I was dissapointed with this. The flavors needed to be much stronger, tasted like a watered down sam adams lager, but cost more money. Deffently not the best lager, or the best beer by victory."
"Pours a slightly hazed gold color with moderate poof of head that leaves quickly with little lacing. Scent is very mild, faint notes of grass, hay and flowers. Taste is clean with the touches of grass, hay, faint sweet malt and light bitterness with no off twang. Lighter side of medium bodied, adequate carbonation. A high quality lager that tops all macro offerings."
"I think if we're going to tank imports for lack of freshness (as reviewers here do), then surely we need to do that with the domestics--which have less of an excuse."
"D- I'll give Victory this, they've created one hell of a drinkable lager. Its got some decent flavor to it so doesn't seem like you're drinking colored water, but overall...its a basic lager. Nice alternative to a domestic, but its not something I'd drink on a regular basis"
"D- Very refreshing lager that is close to the style."
"D- this is drinkable beer for the dog days of Summer. pulled this out after I mowed the lawn and it did the trick!"
"D: It's over 90 Â°F/33 Â°C here today, so I could easily polish off a couple of these."
"Clean, bready malt aroma with a touch of hops. Flavour is mostly sweetly malty but nicely balanced with the hops. Good body with some prickly carbonation. A decent but not outstanding Helles lager."
"This is a wonderful beer. Quality with no pretense. Impossible not to find enjoyable. Another homerun for Victory."
"My first Victory branded beverage. I had high hopes and this one was pretty much average. I was hoping for Munich Helles style flavor but got ""basic"" out of it. The appearance was golden with a one finger head and a tiny bit of lacing. Smell was balanced as was the taste. Like I said above, Basic. Mouthfeel was right down the middle as was drinkability. Actually drinkability was pretty good and would be good for a rookie to try."
"Pours a very pale yellow with an ever so delicate head that fades fast and leaves some equally delicate lace. The aroma is slightly sweet and malty, herbal hops with a bit of floral perfume. The flavor is just as delicate and smooth with a bready malt base and a herbal, floral hop character. This beer is none too exciting, but very tasty with a nice noble hop character. The mouthfeel is very light and refreshing with a nice dry finish that begs for another sip. Obviously this is very drinkable, and would be a great beer for any friends still into the BMC beers. Not the best Victory beer, but another solid offering."
"I'll definately revisit."
"Bright and clear, with a light, foamy white cap that lasts just long enough to let loose a cloud of sweet-smelling corn. The thin body and fairly fizzy texture makes this very easy to down, and the low ABV makes it easy to follow one with another-- that is, if you're in the mood for an uninteresting lager that has the sour smack of an adjunct beer (as far as I know there are no adjuncts used here, but the taste is still there). This is a serviceable beer squarely aimed at the middle of the road, fine for slamming at the barbecue or getting mindlessly hammered on your front porch after work. Otherwise... eh. Pass it by. Better yet, go buy a six of Weihenstephan helles lager instead."
"This is a light, easy drinking beer - really simple and subtle flavors, but satisfying. It would be perfect for a backyard BBQ on a warm afternoon."
"D: This is one of the finest lagers available on US soil. I'm sure many of Victory's devout followers will be upset by the restrained hopping of this one, but I am very pleased that the brewers risked popularity in order to put out a more traditional product. Keep up the good work Victory!"
"D: A real nice lager, glad I got to try this legendary East Coast brew."
"I honestly did not know what to expect from this beer after reading so many negative reviews. I couldn't be more pleased however and can see downing many bottles of this in the future. It's not big, it's not hoppy, it's just good, dependable quality beer, what more can you ask than that?"
"drinkable for sure. nothing awful at all. actually good. but nothing special (did i say that already?). probably should've waited to try this in late april."
"Overall... A letdown.. I was expecting more of a solid base of malt and hops that never disappoints, like Sam Adams, but this one didn't do it for me..."
"Overall: I'll pass next time. I like this brewery and their offerings but this one is not memorable."
" D- This beer is sulfury and fizzy that covers most of the flavor and aroma except for the watery taste in the finish."
"D: Certainly drinkable on summer day or possibly as a session if you were into it."
"Taste: Kind of lemony. Moderate bitterness. Unimpressive but decent for the style."
"Overall I'd say this is worth skipping, better than BMC, but skip this and go to Prima Pils."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow color. 1/5 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of yeast, pale malt, grain, and hint of hops. Fits the style of a Munich Helles Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, pale malt, grain, slight hops, and a hint of citrus. Overall, a slightly better than average lager, but still weak in body for my taste. It does get much better as it has a chance to warm."
"D - A lager that is well made, but doesn't compare to some other Helles biers I have had, just better than average drinkability wise for me."
"Dr. Yes, but I'm not sure why."
"Out of a 12 ounce bottle and into my standard shaker glass. The lager appears a clear muted yellow color with about a finger of creamy bone white foam. Aromas and flavors are of caramel malt, grassy, earthy hops, fruity and semi-sweet with a pleasant bitterness, some toasted biscuits. Decent body for the style with ample carbonation as well. A good gateway beer."
"d- really great, this is my go to local beer, very drinkable, completely sessionable, i don't normally love munich helles lagers but i really enjoy this one, it doesn't pop as much as hopdevil or prima pils do, but it's great in it's own way."
"D: It may not compare to Prima Pils or the best Bavarian lagers, but it is a very respectable attempt at a helles. Check it out if you like German beers."
"D: Supremely drinkable. Refreshing, balanced, and clean. Overall a great beer."
"Notes: So easy to drink,really good session beer. I will use this as a gateway to better beer for my Corona drinking friends."
"Second beer of the night at the Kinsale. Served on tap in an imperial pint glass. Bright yellow color, with ample carbonation. Nice sized white head. Pretty standard looking lager though. Smell was a bit malty, but not much else. Taste was pretty spot on for a lager. Nice balance of flavor profiles. Mouthfeel was pretty crisp and dry. While the flavor didn't blow me away, the smoothness of this beer impressed me. Extremely easy beer to drink, a very good choice for a session beer. Why anyone would bother to order a macro lager over a quality craft lager like this is beyond me."
"Personally: A good ol' beer for anytime and most any occasion."
"Smooth! Refreshing and light. Grassy hoppiness. Has a strong yeast bite that is dry and very pilsner like. I am impressed with how complex it can be yet so simple. A great session lager in the old world style! Victory keeps making some of the best brews in the Eastern US. Cheers!"
"T- It's a very dry beer. Too dry, really. Crisp, with a slight bitterness and some wheaty overtones. Not that impressed."
"The thing that defines this beer is how NOT in your face it is. The body is a somewhat sweet, grainy, but restrained malt. This holds for a decent while before the very tame hop bitterness makes itself known in the finish. There's also some biscuity notes on the finish as well. It's definitely a beer I'd recommend for people who are looking for a easy drinking beer year-round....while not incredibly complex, it's definitely drinkable."
"This came as part of a mix case, I would not get it on its own. It is what it is, a fuller bodied BMC clone. Not bad by any means, but I just prefer beer that have more going on with them."
"::EDIT::I tasted it over the weekend and again tonight directly from the bottle and (for whatever reason) it is much more satisfying."
"I wanted a lighter beer to quench my thirst last night after a long day of traveling and this beer disappointed. I expected a beer similar to Prima Pils with less herby hoppiness and more body and malt. Instead, I got a piss-yellow, lager with little hop flavor, not much malt or body, and no head. The beer with thin and tasted like nothing I was expecting. Granted this is a step up from Yuengling Lager and the like, but it's not what I would expect from a Victory lager. Maybe this is what the style is supposed to be like, but I did not like it one bit. I was very disappointed and left wishing I had ordered the Stoudt's APA that my dinner companion had, in place of what I had gotten."
"Taste macro-ey and doesn't do much for me..."
"D) A decent brew, but just plain lager."
"Very easy to drink a few of these, this is one of the better lagers I've had."
"for a lighter looking beer, this was not all too bad.. very drinkable would indicate a great beer to share with friends.. overall i would probably get it again in a bar, but not to fill up my keg at home.."
"This brew is a bit of a tweener- a flavorful lager that would suit Joe-BMC just fine. Good to see that with all of the huge beers in Victory's portfolio, they can make a fine ""regular"" beer as well."
"Mouthfeel is light but slightly oily."
"In the end it's refreshing, and a half-upscale lager but i hope the next Victories have much more to offer (i'm sure they do)."
"Drinkability: I find this very refreshing and drinkable. And since it goes down so easily I could easily make an evening drinking this beer. This is a well brewed beer and a good example of what an helles lager can be."
"prior to trying the sixer, i had tried samples before. in smaller amounts, it seemed like it might be a decent helles. but upon trying full sevings, the fusel character comes out and the feel is thinner than expected. better than average, but had higher hopes for this one."
"I had this a multitude of times. It's best out of the bottle. Not recommended with food. It's flavor is too sweet and strong to be paired with food. If anything maybe pizza or a light lunch sandwich."
"Victory Lager could be a great session beer. A good tasting crisp and clean beer. It's easy to drink with a great balance of flavor, mouthfeel, and this beer tastes good to the end."
"Smells very light and sour. Some corn, slight citrus. Twangy. Very light and watery mouthfeel. Goes down very easily. Taste is of strong lemon in my mind. No hop bite. Slight malty flavor. Not bad for a thirst-quencher, but that's about it. I won't get it often, but it is refreshing."
"HV"
"Don't drink and review."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a clear golden color with white frothy heading. Heading dissolves very quickly. Slowly carbonation bubbles drift upward kind of trippy. Very earthy and nutty smell with a citrus ending. Taste is very dry with alot of carbonation kind of to much, almost unenjoyable. I would call this a light lager that is very carbonated. Leaves no lacing at all. A kind of let down for a highly rated brew."
"D - Not really interesting, but clean and quenching."
"D: Drinkability was ok, was on the fence for this one. Drinkable but with a shoulder shrug for excitement."
"D - Another solid Victory brew...I will be having this one over and over again"
"Pours a darker yellowish-golden color with a foamy white head that settles into a nice lace. Aroma is nothing special with subtle hints of floral hops. Flavor is a nice balance of hops , maltiness and a crisp golden flavor. Very smooth drinking enjoyable session beer."
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into a SA pint glass. It pours a bright yellow, lots of carbonation and a fluffy head. The head fades quickly. The smell is a bit grainy, nothing outstanding. The beer is crisp and smooth. A pleasant bitternes it the overiding flavor but it is very clean. The beer is light bodied and very sessionable. A nice change from the bigger beers I ususally drink."
"D: Oh yeah, this is a good one."
"D - Good beer. It's really light and crisp. I love Victory!"
"Though I admit I am not a big fan of Helles lagers, this one isn't a bad option, but it certainly isn't a Penn Gold either."
"Taste is an onlought of carbonation. Hints of sweet gum, fruit mainly banannas and a bitter edge. Light on the feel"
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, not much sticky lacing tough. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight spice. The taste is sweet, malty, slightly hoppy, with some spice. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a nice one."
"Pours a radiant clear yellow, with a small head and streamers of carbonation. The aroma is powerful - you can smell this beer coming. It is bready and sweet with a nice sting of hop bitterness. The flavor is a little less powerful, but still delicious - bready, lemony with that distinctive Victory Brewing hop bitterness on the finish. The mouthfeel is thin and pleasant. This is an eminently drinkable beer"
"D: very drinkable beer. I have started to drink more Helles lager, and I really enjoyed this one. great summer brew."
"Good effort by Victory."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, there are definitely several other beers in the style that I would choose first."
"Beer Its Not Just A Beverage It s Food!"
"D. Drinkability is very good. A nice beer to relax with and enjoy."
"Taste - pretty plain, but very drinkable. It's an excellent PLAIN lager, nothing special about it but it's the type of beer you could have a couple of to quench your thirst."
"D: Pretty good. Goes down easy."
"Drinkability: could do two in a night"
"I would recommend this to people on both sides of the BA fence."
"I've liked most Victory beers I've tried, it's a shame that they only market several (Hopdevil, Storm King, Prima Pils, Hop Wallop) widely in OH. I'd like to see this (along with Moonglow) on OH shelves."
"Smooth and light-bodied; refreshing and extremely drinkable."
"Drinkability: Decent lawnmower beer. You should drink this instead of PBR. It's smooth, refreshing and inoffensive. I don't normally drink lagers but I would drink this again if I could find it easier."
"The beer pours a pale yellow with not a whole lot of head or anything remotely interesting. The smell at first was grassy, or hay like, with some citrus aromas, a maybe a bit of veggie in there too. As the beer settles, the sweeter malts emerge and some of the less pleasing macro like aromas disappear. The taste improves as the beer settle too. It began with too much the lemony, vegetable, sweetish macro flavors and segued into a slightly better flavor with more complex malts emerging. The beer is moderately carbonated, very light bodied, a bit on the watery side, and not all that interesting. It gets a bit more husky as my palate gets used to it. This is certainly better than most macro lagers you'll find, but if has pretentions to be more, there just isn't that much here that would keep me coming back. It's quite drinkable if you are after a thirst quencher."
"Note: I really like this beer, it's just a good solid session lager or a damn good lawnmower beer. It's not overly complex and it's not subtle it's just a solid no fuss lager. And sometimes that just hits the spot."
"Nothing sticks out in the beer, which can be looked at as a good thing or a bad thing. I can't say that it is very memorable, but as a clean, crisp, balanced, and pleasant brew, this is something that I would not mind having again."
"good drinkability, very quenching and easy drinking. i find this beer very satisfying, it's one of my favorites for the style. i'm considering picking up a case for the summer."
"An average lager for a microbrewery, but very drinkable. Definitely would pair well with food."
"D: Highly drinkable. Have had better hellles from Germany - this is good."
"Drinkability - Not a style I have made a point of becoming familiar with, so my opinion is biased by my limited experience. I really liked this offering and could see a six-pack fitting into my refrig. Would be a good offering to pair with meat on the grill."
"Eh. Nothing special here. Very middle of the road for a lager. I guess you could say this is what a lager should taste like, but there's nothing distinguishable about it. Pours a light golden with good foam. It's very drinkable, yes, but because there's not too much to it. If I'm looking for a quick drink, I'd choose this over a Sprite, but that's about it."
"This style is so perfect for a hot summer day. I think this one would also make a good intro beer for someone trying to get into craft beer. It's balanced, not too strong, and refreshing. I've had better MHL than one one, but it's still a solid beer. Recommended."
"Overall this is not going to blow anyone's mind but is very drinkable and would make the perfect complement to grilled/barbequed foods as well as sharing many with friends during the game."
"I'll be honest, I don't necessarily care for this style of beer. I think it's, by nature, thinly constructed. I tried it because Victory is a solid brewery. That being said, this is an okay beer. I think it's as good as you can get with the style."
"Very good pale lager they got here. In a perfect world they would all taste at least this good."
"D: Easily drinkable and enjyable but not overly unique"
"Nice brew. I was expecting something a little bit lighter in body and taste but this was a pleasant surprise. Good flavor, body, and finish."
"I could sit and drink a six pack of this in the evening and be quite content. A very good beer and i recommend for everyone!"
"Pours a pale golden yellow with a small white head. In the aroma, a sweet maltiness. In the taste, a small sweet to dry maltiness and a very clean taste. A smooth, medium bodied mouthfeel and a small dry maltiness in the aftertaste. A very nice lager, yet nothing too exciting."
"D: Definitely a drinkable beer, but not for the taste. The light and almost tasteless nature of this beer makes it not just drinkable but poundable. I can slam these back all night long without missing a beat or feeling bloated at all."
"Drinkability: It's clearly not my favorite Victory beer, but it would however make a great substitute for any of your run of the mill macros out there. Not a victory for Victory with this one."
"A very light, easy-going, perilously drinkable lager that goes down smooth as water... even my girlfriend liked this one and she's not a huge fan of beers... appearance is about average for a lager, with a golden color and light carbonation present... smell is okay but rather bland compared to the other, more robust samples from this company... Taste was good... very light with faint citrus and fruit notes on the palate, though slightly watery... drinkability was really very good because it went down so smoothly without the faintest hint of any bitterness... This is definitely an awesome session beer and downing a sixer wouldn't be a problem... while more bland than most other Victory beers, this brew certainly scores for mouthfeel and drinkability... Recommended for a good, light, session beer..."
"Overall- Finally flt like reviewing this 1. I'm not a big Lager but this is very enjoyable. Light yet flavorful and a phenomonal golfing beer."
"On tap at Moan and Dove. This golden-yellow lager is extremely clear to see through, however, there is practically no head. The aroma is barely a hint of hops. Surprisingly, the taste was very developed even with the lack of apparent smells. It turned out to be a really sweet lager. An average carbonation allows it to be somewhat refreshing but a bit too watery. Overall, this drink was a little too crisp, a little too watery and lacked any powerful aroma. But it was decently sweet."
"Smell is pale, biscuity malt with some fruitiness and a little spiciness from the hops. Taste is similar, balanced malt and mild bitterness, finishes with some grassy hops. Mouthfeel is light, crisp, enjoyable beer and definately drinkable. Kind of the odd ball of the Victory Variety pack but it is worth drinking, or at least trying. Perhaps a good ""gateway to craft beer"" beer."
"I guess not everybody in the dugout can be the star of the game!"
"This is a solid helles."
"D- This is a pretty plain and simple example of a Munich Helles Lager. One that is easy to drink and enjoy for its simplicity. Not my favorite from the victory lineup-but none the less a pretty solid example of the style. As far as Munich Helles go-I strongly prefer Penn Gold but I would probably have this one again-besides its part of the Victory variety case and the other 3 offerings in there are very good beers."
"I thought I would give this beer a shot since the brewery is in the Philadelphia vicinity.It is pale yellow and the smell is average.Taste is unremarkable at first but has a nice fresh bread aftertaste.I would recommend this beer to my buddies,it's not great but it's definetly drinkable."
"Damn, this is just a nice German helles lager, something that surprisingly hard to find. It's a golden yellow without much head unfortunately, but everything else is good. The aroma is sweet and bready with the flavor opening up into a light fruity lager funk, lightly roasted grains, a touch of biscuit, and a smooth mouthfeel. This is a great lawnmower beer, but also so much more. I wish more bars around me would carry this."
"Overall, a great-tasting lager. This beer wins points from me not so much for having an outstandingly unique taste, but rather a perfect balance of a bunch of flavors. They're hard to pinpoint exactly just because they're blended so well. Definitely worth investigating for yourself."
"I believe that there really is no completely bad beer. Somewhere out there someone in enjoying Old Milwaukee and socializing. My percieved superior taste buds do not lessen that experience."
"A stronghold of the Victory brand, and a perfect opportunity to start converting macro drinkers. Next stop, a Maibock..."
"Bottom line: This is a good Lager...no bells or whistles, just a good solid Lager. I'd drink it again."
"Not my first Victory, but my first Victory purchased on tap in SC! Poured a clear light amber amber with a small white head and a very quick fade, almost no retention, and only a slight bit of a residual lace. Very light smell, somewhat grainy with bread tones and not alot of fullness to it. The taste was decent, with a crisp, clean, smooth feel, but just not alot of profile to it. Grainey bread like taste, small hop trying to break through but just doesnthave enough to get through all the way. Overall this is a decent session beer nothing spectacular, but nothing bad either. Could definatly see myself throwing this down on a 90+ day, but at night as a tv beer, nah."
"It has a clean, refreshing quality to it. Not bad, but nothing particularly special about it."
"Overall impression: Quality session lager, with just enough floral hop flavor to keep it interesting. Clean grain flavors - another nice offering from Victory."
"Cheers."
"This is a fine lager and taste nothing like im used to in the lager dept.Well done."
"This offering was somwhat of a let down. I am beginning to like the style, but this seems like a weak representation. Penn Gold is a better choice for a Helles Lager."
"Taste is very sweet, hardly any hop flavor at all. Lots of honey flavor in this. Pale sweet malt, hnts of caramel. Mouth is a bit cloying quite frankly. Sticky mouth and finish. The honey-like flavors are just too much. Not a good Helles IMO."
"As far as lagers go here in PA, this is one of the best; way better than any mass-produced American lager."
"Poured into pint glass,beer was light golden,straw color.Lots of carbination,white creamy head dissapated quickly. Has a bread-like aroma. no real hop presense.Grainey,bread taste,not much of a hop bitterness.It tasted thin, not much body.Would be a good beer served cold on a hot day,not a filling beer at all.Not what I'm used to from Victory."
"As critical as I'm being about this beer, it wasn't undrinkable. There just wasn't anything unique or exciting about it. You could have put it side by side with any other macro lager and I would have been hard pressed to tell the two apart. I actually put down a sixer of HopDevil and bought this instead. I won't be making that mistake again."
"Overall an authentic rendition of the style. Very drinkable."
"The beer pours a clear gold/yellow with a nice fluffy white head. I wrote down what I smelt and then had to look it up, DMS (a sweet corn smell), it was very pronounced and there was a slight metallic smell there too. It had a nice grainy malt taste, slightly sweet with hint of bitterness at the end of the sip. It had a light/medium body with a good level of carbonation making a very refreshing beer."
"The head is fizzy and soda like, quickly falling to a glass ring and surface lacing over a very light gold, bubbly body. The nose is of somewhat off-putting grain. Taste is very nice though, a clean, balanced grain/hop combination, very simple. Mouthfeel is spot on, with a thin body and high carbonation. A very easy drinker, but with some significant negatives and no complexity whatsoever."
"Drinkability was good to better. Sorry, a good solid above average quality brew but nothing to distinguish it's self. MK"
"This beer is probably one of the easiest drinking beers I've had in my life. 12 oz bottle. Pours out a pale yellow with a fizzy white head. Looks sort of like champagne. Has a very sweet fruity smell to it. Drinking it is like liquid gold. Not really light in flavor. There is tons of it, just all very pleasant and very little bitter flavor in it. Has a sweet floral hop. It is amazingly clean and crisp. A light tasting beer to enjoy in the summer. This is hands down the best example of a ""lawnmower beer"" I have ever tasted."
"D-This is a good drinking beer, goes down really smooth. Won't take much to finish off a sixer."
"Very drinkable."
"Very smooth bready taste with just a faint hop finish. This would be a good beer to introduce a macro drinker to craft beers with. There are some adjuct-ish characteristics present but I would bet they dont use any here. Smooth and very drinkable."
"Drinkability: High drinkability. This beer is well made and I highly recommend it."
"D - Easy. It is like water, so it drinks like water. This is a natural session beer, a compliment to nearly any meal. It tastes like a macro lager, but stripped of all unpleasantries."
"Went down very smoothly as it is very light. Aftertaste is that of an American Lager. It's very enjoyable!"
"resampled on 6/16/08 with a best by 7/15/08 bottle...scores updated slightly from 4/4/4.5/4.5/5"
"Sorry."
"Pale pale golden clear color- beer? This looks like champagne to me. Weird. Not much in the way of the nose... a hint of lemon and wheat, but it isn't terribly fragrant. Tastes like a hefe. A very filtered hefe. Wheat and lemon come through strong, maybe a hint of banana too. Taste is nice- but not so lageresque. Mouthfeel reminds me a bit of champagne, too... Very very drinkable, light and refreshing, goes down easy- a nice crisp brew."
"Solid stuff. Nothing striking about it but it does its job."
"It really excels in the drinkability category, I wish I would have bought more than one to sample, as I could easily drink several of these in a row, especially out on a hot summer day grilling. This will be my beer of choice to bring to a summer party, especially if there are lots of non-BAers around who might squawk at something other than a typical lager."
"Pours a light gold to pale straw color (clear), with a one finger head that dissipates rather quickly (no lace). Besides a slight hop aroma mingled with a touch of malt, I personally had a little trouble picking up any other aroma characteristics. The taste starting a little sweet for me, moved to a slight hoppy flavor and finished crisp with the faintest grain flavor. Overall mouth feel was a little thin almost watery to me. Bottom-line is that this is a decent Helles Lager. It won't knock you out with complexity, but it is enjoyable as a simple Lager. I will definitely be enjoying a few of these beside the grill this summer."
"Cheers!"
"all in all this is definately not worth the price. Bummer"
"This goes down with tremendous ease. A very nice lager - but what else would you expect from Victory?"
"Yeah, this lager could easily compete in Wisconsin . . . heck, it could even find itself in Germany and have a fighting chance against some German varieties. I love it, I love it, I love it."
"There is an easiness to drinking this that I cannot quite put my finger on, just wish something stood out a little more."
"Victory Lager. Indeed."
"This is a nice, standard issue but solid sort of lager. Would be excellent in the summer. One thing I love about Victory is the fact that they have so many beers that are just eye candy. This is a great example of what a lager should look like - perfect clarity, straw colored, lightly carbonated, and with a small head that sticks around for a while but eventually disappears. Would be nicer I guess if the head lasted longer, but I'm not gonna nitpick here. Smell is yeasty and grainy, with a light malt backbone and a grassy but sedate hop profile. Crisp taste first of all, which is good. Followed up by some bready malty tastes and a wee bit of hops. Could be a bit more rounded off in terms of having some nicer, more robust, sweet malts, for balance. All in all though, it's a really drinkable beer with a subtle character."
"This beer came a clear straw yellow with a hint of brown and a thick frothy head. Smelled of dry dirty corn and a musky citrus. Tasted very citrusy for a lager with a sweet corn and oats base. Very slight and simple. Mouth feel was light bodied with a medium to high carbonation. IÂ’d have to say that this would be an ideal transition beer for some one addicted to macros who is curious about Victory."
"Final Thought: An average Lager, disappointing coming from Victory."
"A decent beer overall, though it is paled in every category to the other beers available. It tasted like water after such monster brews as Storm King and Hop Devil, though I tried not to let that hinder the rating."
"Well this is a perfectly average beer. A beer to recommend to the Bud drinker in your circle of friends as an entre' to better things. Pours a transparent pale gold with a sparse short-lived head that left no lace whatsoever....sigh. Persisitent light carbonation insufficient to form the sparsest of rings of foam on a beer clean glass. The aroma was light and bready, some sweetness hints of corn and faint floral hops. Taste was balanced and refreshing. Short lived sweetness fading to a hoppy finish that is persistent but faint. Mouthfeel is light. This is an easy drinking beer though a tad too ""euro lager-ish"" for my tastes. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp. A refreshing and drinkable brew, perhaps a good brew to have around for the dog days of August when you are having many more than one."
"Victory Lager is what American macro lagers should taste like. This bottle contains a simple, straightforward, extremely well-crafted beer that is enjoyable solo and should match up well with all manner of foods. Along with Ayinger Jahrhundert Bier, it's my new favorite version of a style that I don't usually pay much attention to. Victory brews good beer!"
"Drinkability/notes Â– Probably a nice summer or all night session beer. Maybe a good cross over brew as has been noted, but maybe not enough going on to make converts."
"This was a disappointment for me. I guess I was expecting much more from this brewery. I was really excited to try it, but it did let me down. The main reason was the smell and taste. They were way too much like a lot of the Euro Lagers out there. The only thing, was that it had an ok look to it. Skunk abounded in this bottle for me. Not something I would offer to anyone I liked."
"Pours a pale gold, slightly hazy, with very little head or lace to speak of. Nice malt aroma comes through, a bit of honey and citrus and a subtle hop aroma. Again a nice malt flavor mixed with honey and citrus. A decent hop flavor and slight bitterness but not as sharp as their pils. Average carbonation and high drinkability. A decent brew and a good candidate for a crossover brew to entice the macro drinkers of the world."
"Overall, it's like they set out to brew a smooth lager to show how good it can be done, and maybe succeeded a little too much. It's what many macro-brews could achieve if they bothered with quality ingredients and methods, a smooth mildly malty beer with very little flavor, but certainly no BAD flavors. I'm glad I tried it for variety's sake, but will stick with Victory's other offerings in the future."
"This beer pours a pale straw color with a thick white head which leaves some nice lacing. Aroma is of sweet malt with some grassy and floral hops. Taste is dominated by sweet malt although some hops are present to balance the sweetness. This is medium to full-bodied and well carbonated- feels very nice in the mouth. Also extremely drinkable. This is pretty good stuff- no doubt. But it's also not all that exciting."
"12 oz. bottle, best by 8/7/05 - served chilled in a pilsner glass. Pours with a 1 finger white head with medium bubbles that don't leave much lacing. The body looks unfiltered - kinda like a witbier with a touch of yellow/gold tinges. Metal, spicy hops, malts and maybe diacetyl on the nose. Palate is the same, with a crisp, light body, but I'm also getting a hint of wet paper and even corn, even though there was none in the mash. Wish I hadn't forgotten about this bottle - I'm sure it's better when fresher."
"I know Victory laughs at the idea that their beers are not as good since they installed their new brewery, but in my opinion, they are not. I've never had so many bad beers from Victory as I'm getting now. This beer is in date, and it's shot. A damn shame."
"poured a clear amber color with notable white head. Smell is malty and a bit sweet, but in a pleasant way. Taste is crisp and sharp, able to note sweet malt present with a different texture than from corn syrup. Finish is crisp and malty. A good lager."
"A crystal clear yellow with a big puffy head, smells of saaz with a mild undercurrent of malts. Tastes about the same, crisp and refreshing,slight malts, slight hops, with a tiny tartness that comes out as the beer warms. A fine lawn mower beer, or relaxing summer day beer."
"This Victory lager poured a light golden yellow. Very little head and what head was there quickly disappeared. The scent was subtle. Light malt, mostly light wheat grains. The flavor was crisp and subtle. Light malts, not very powerful. Soft lager style wheat flavor. The mouthfeel was refreshing, and there was little aftertaste. Nice lager, but would like a little more power behind it."
"This poured with a huge, foamy, white head that quickly dissipated into wispiness. It was a very pale yellow, almost straw-like, in color. The mouthfeel was very light, but I got a nice maltiness on the nose. In fact, I even thought that nose reminded me of hay. There was a good malty sweetness both in the mouth and on the finish. The finish was surprisingly dry, reminding me that an American lager is far different from a Helles-style lager. Viva la difference!"
"Per Victory website: 4.8% ABV"
"Pours a straw yellow with a decent 1 inch head that dissipates quickly. Smell was all malt as the name suggests with no hop notes detected. taste seemed one sided, mostly malt with a hint of bread in the back, the mouthfeel was good, crisp and clean with a slight tingle but a little thin, not watery but thin. Not a bad beer just nothing special"
"Not a bad beer at all- definitely a 'quaffer'- some flaws, but they can easily be overlooked under the right circumstances."
"Pours a clear golden straw colour with a nice two finger white head. Aroma is a touch grassy with some bready and malt characteristics. Smell is very clean and crisp. Taste has some nice sweet malty notes with some citrus in the background. Not very complex and not very hoppy. Nicely carbonated and refreshing. Very drinkable on a hot day. This is not the most complex beers, but I dont think it is meant to be. Just a crisp clean lager for those days when they hit the spot. Such as 85 degrees with 84 % humidity."
"Nothing special, at Mondial 2005. Another mediocre malty lager. But of head, something people watching a hockey game would down without thinking, or tasting. Malty, significant carbonation. Light golden. I had this before the bolder beers, didn't help."
"Pours a pale yellow/golden color with little head, looks like budweiser. Smell is pretty different though, very grainy, with hints of biscuit and cracker and a light saaz hops aroma, definately get a ""raw lager"" vibe from the aroma. Taste is big on malt, with a bready/cracker malt flavor that continues into a light saaz hops spiciness that is quickly overtaken by a dry, crisp finish. Good mouthfeel and fairly high carbonation that makes this very refreshing. A very good and easy drinking lager thats more complex and tasty than i expected."
"Freshness date on the bottle is 3/1/05. The beer pours a crystal clear light golden color with a bright foamy white head that fades fast. The smell is a very clean grain smell, with some sweet malts coming through in the background. The taste too is clean and malty, and there is a just barely detectable hop bite. The mouthfeel is pleasantly crisp and the beer is medium to light bodied. This is a very simple straightfoward beer, but very well done. Great for a hot summer's day or to introduce macro drinkers too."
"Light aroma of lightly sweet pale malt (I tried, that's all I could find). Moderately thick, foamy, bright white colored head fades quickly to a patchy film. Perfectly transparent pale straw colored beer with a few streams of fine bubbles rising from around the bottom edges of the glass. Lightly sweet malt up front with a pinch of candied hop flavor underneath. The body is fairly light, and there is a healthy dose of carbonation towards the end. I read the style guide and everything seems to be in check, but I don't think there's much in this style that appeals to me."
"Enjoyed the Hop Devil so much I jumped at the chance to try this, but must say I was very disapointed. Poured a pale yellow gold with a 1/2"" white head of tight foam that had a little lacing going on. Nose was sweet, lite, nothing spectacular. Tasted very even, nicely balanced, with perhaps some very mild hoppiness and an excuse of some spice as it warmed. Very little body, finished a little watery. I would take a Yuengling over this."
"This is one of the lightest beers I've drank in a while and the lightest out of this Victory sampler pack. This beer poured a bright straw yellow with a nice finger and a half head and maintained good carbonation until the end. The head dissapeared quickly though and there was very little to no lacing. The smell was typical lager with just a little more hop than usual. Taste is of mild malts and very fresh tasting or maybe I should say just plain clean and organic tasting. Mouthfeel is very smooth. This beer is my least favorite that I have tried from Victory, but then again that's just my preference. Saying that it is still quite easy to drink and very true to the style."
"Poured into a ""traditional"" ale glass at room temp, it pours a pale gold color with 2 inches of frothy white head and lots of cascading bubbles. The head dissipates pretty quickly leaving some edge lacing and a slight layer of head on top. Aroma is of pale, bright malts and some citrus (lemon); aroma is very clean and basic. Sipping, it has a slightly sweet malty flavor with hints of grains and maybe some corn flavors in there also. The sweetness is a little lemony and decent. Carbonation is well balanced throughout along with some slight alcohol on the tongue upon swallowing. Nothing exciting about this one: a straight forward lager that is light and simple to drink."
"Had this on-tap also at CAH (Innsbrook) and it tasted a little soapy, not sure why, just a little detergent hit on the tongue."
"Overall-a nice crossover beer but as a lager its merely good, which is fine, it's just after having their Prima Pils I'm convinced Victory could have produced a much better beer to knock my socks off. Oh well, a fine lager in every respect, just dissapointing after Prima Pils."
"Whenever you are in the mood simple but high quality beer this is it."
"Refreshing, clean, good summer beer"
"Wish"
"This is just an incredibly tasty example of a Helles. Despite it being past its bottle date this beer tasted incredibly fresh and vibrant to me, I can't even imagine a fresh one being better."
"Drinkability: This is what a lager should taste like on a hot summer day."
"Clear yellow in color with a short white 1/4"" head that disappeared quicker than your can say Downingtown Pennsylvania. No lacing either. The aroma was very faint, as some malts are detectable. The flavor is not what most are used to with Victory brews, as the mild malt and soft bitterness don't overly excite your tongue. The mouthfeel was clean and crisp. No noticeable aftertaste. Drinkability is there, but flavor component is lacking to make this a more interesting brew. This is a perfect beer for the macro drinkers in the crowd and maybe it will spark interest in trying some of Victory's better offerings."
"I don't particularly like the way lagers look in general, but this is standard fare for the style: light, dissipated head that's persistent around the miniscus. Golden, well carbonated, and a touch cloudier than most. Smells malty, crisp, and smooth. From the description on the bottle, which touts German methodology and denounces adjuncts, I get the feeling that this is a return to a simple, basic style, without frills, and it does a damn good job at that. This is like a Budweiser that doesn't taste like shit. Plain but solid. A keg of this wouldn't get any strange looks at a fraternity party, but wouldn't draw the disdain given to macro shit brews. An interesting idea for a beer, and it overcame my usual tendency towards complexity, spice, and obscure tastes. I wouldn't drink it regularly, but I'm impressed."
"Pours a very pretty bright, haze-free gold. Head, unfortunately, was disappointing, even for the style. Smell is pretty good, Â“beeryÂ” and somewhat light and sweet. Taste is good. The malt profile here is dominant, which is unusual for the style, but I still find it doesnÂ’t override the subtle, spicy hops. Very drinkable and very refreshing, this is an excellent conversion beer because of itÂ’s light body and similarity in style to some macros, yet it is refreshing and a solid beer in itÂ’s own right."
"Draught @ Victory: The new All-Malt Lager is a pretty good beer. This was a clear golden yellow color. There was a bit of a white head. Fortunately, it wasnÂ’t fizzy. As expected, the aroma was a little light. It was pleasing, hoever, with hints of malt and hops. The taste wasnÂ’t too bad either. Definitely lighter in body, but a pleasing mix of malts and hops. The brewery probably refers to this as ""billpayer beer"" as it definitely appeals to the masses."
"Drinkability: I could drink this all day."
"Drinkability: Instead of bringing a case of Bud, bring a case of this and see if people will like it. I'm sure they will. A good beer to convert someone over."
"Drinkability: Easy drink, not consistent with the excellence of Victory, but I'd definitely have it again, if it was the best alternative around."
"14oz pils glass presentation. White 1/2"" head over a plae straw brew, and no lacing present. Light pale malt aroma, and the flavor expanded on this with the crisp malt character leading up to a hoppy finish. Mouthfeel and drinkability excellent."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light pale malt scent with a citrus hop aroma. The taste is average. It has a light, pale malt flavor with a bit of citrus hops in the aftertaste. It has little flavor or complexity; boring. The mouthfeel sucks. It is a low bodied beer with less than adequate carbonation. This is an average lager at best. It has little flavor and terrible mouthfeel. This is by far the worst offering from Victory, although I like the ""all malt"" concept."
"On tap at the drafting room. Clear and very light golden with a small amount of white head that left a creamy ring. Floral and fruit scents, little bit of white grapes. Very light tasting, clear and watery, lightly reminiscant of fruit. I want to say it is one dimensional, but I do catch alot of fruits and flowers in it... No body to speak of, but drinkable."
"victory really continues to disappoint me. with exception of the wonderfully tasty hopdevil, the other brews of theirs that i've sampled thusfar really seem to be below the standards that i had hoped for them. the all malt lager is easily the worst of the lot that i have had. it pours a macro looking crisp straw golden colour with no head. i was very disappointed here. the smell and taste: average to slightly below average. both are watery and malty with a touch of grass, sweetness and hops. any flavour is way in the back behind the watery characteristics that dominate here. there's nothing here, really. bland. boring. blah. the one thing i will give this brew is that it is crisp and refreshing on a hot summer day, a bit moreso than your standard macro would be/is. this one is better than those macros, but not by much. i expected more from you victory and you keep disappointing. convince me otherwise...please."
"Appearance is a slightly hazy deep yellow with a decent sized white head that goes quick. A bit of lacing remains throughout the life of the brew. Smells of malt and earthy hops with notes of spice and a few other things. This tastes of a wheat/grainy malt flavor with a slight sweetness. There is a small hop taste in there as well but I canÂ’t detect much else. Mouthfeel is decent with good carbonation. This is a beer that would be good to give to someone who is used to macros to try and convert them. A fairly tasty lager that I would probably get again."
"wasnÂ’t expecting this, but this is a pretty cloudy lager. Medium gold with a soapy white head that fades. Chalky malt aroma is followed up my more of the same (if thereÂ’s such a thing as a malty pale lager, this is it). The hops are reserved adding just enough spiciness and bitterness to balance the beer out. Nice lager."
"My first from Victory Brewing. ""Enjoy by date"" 08/15/04. Pours a very pale, golden color with very little head that does not stick around. There are trace amounts of lace that also disappear as quickly as they come. The aroma is very faint as well. Taste is slightly hoppy with ample carbonation. Pretty smooth drink, but not much there. Could be a good standby or session beer, but nothing to write home about. Decent enough and not bad."
"Drinkability: Drinkability is quite good, but flavors get quite surpressed if too cool. This would be a great stepping stone beer for macro lovers"
"Apperance proposes a dark golden yellow hue with sunset red hints, kind of hazy. Aroma contains nice cookie maltiness, a bit toasty as well, light noble hops and mostly bready. I must say IÂ’m not getting that much though. In mouth, its presence is very mild without too much going on and even a feeling approaching metal in the finish. Body is rather creamy and could use a bit more carbonation I believe. This is miles away from prima pils unfortunately and I really wanted to enjoy it as I felt it was a great day for an helles. Thanks Francis"
"It is what it is, and that's fresh and refreshing. The veritable malt character is nicely balanced by a crisp, reasonably well-defined hops presence. You don't have to concentrate on this flavor, because there's nothing complex about it, and maybe I see that as more of a strength than might others. Pleasant and quenching, it goes down damned smooth, and that plus the nice flavor adds up to a real good quaffability quotient. Yes, it is indeed a lawn mower beer, but one of the better ones, by far. This one will accompany often on my deck this summer."
"ng"
"Drinkability - Very drinkable over the long haul, and maybe a good gateway beer for some, but if you are looking for a good Victory offering, this is definitely not what you want. So much better out there from these guys."
"Pours a nearly transparent pale straw-yellow, with a small white head that disappears quickly, but continues to leave a gentle lacing. The aroma was fresh and malty (duh). Initially it hit me like most pale lagers do -- kinda' nothin', ""fuzzy"" carbonation, and very easy drinking -- but the fullness of the malt improves in the aftertaste -- making for a brew that is as easy drinking as any good session brew, but far more satisfying after it goes down. The mouthfeel leaves the palate nicely coated, and the lingering flavor is sweet malt with a bit of spiciness that reminded me of a subtle clove-like flavor. Pale lagers generally don't float my boat, but I wouldn't mind going sailing with this one."
"Apart from the bold German varieties, I am not a fan of lagers. Victory All Malt Lager has officially changed my stance. ItÂ’s easily my favorite pale lager, and ranks up there as a session beer of choice."
"Pours a fresh golden color, with abundant carbonation that slowly settles to a thin lacing. The smell is crisp and reminds slightly sweet. The first taste is refreshing. Very refreshing. Like, yummmm. It's not a craft brew. It's a beer. It could easily be slipped in Joe six pack's hand and he might not even notice the difference. The finish is clean, with the slightest pucker, and no filler aftertaste. The malt is well balanced, and does not sink or cloy. Hop character is subdued, and serves a supporting role. It's not in there to be the focus, it may not come through as strongly as one might like, and without it the beer would be too thin. Relax with this guy, and take it for what it is. Drink it right out of the bottle, kick those big dawgs up, and put on a smile. A solid beer, satisfying and enjoyable; not looking to win awards."
"Drinkability: Seems like a Muenchner Helles, Very smooth with a nose and a taste that are a bit too subdued. This beer would be a great session beer, just because of the mildness of it."
"sadly, the new helles style can't hold a candle to the older dortmunder style lager they used to make, which was much bigger in body and flavor. i guess this is meant for more mass appeal, but i wish the old lager wasn't sacraficed for this one."
"It pours a light strwa color. It also has a light, sweet note to it, and bery hop resonance. not so much a presence, but it is there, and it is a resonance. Pours a light straw color, but not muh to it. It is very fizzy, but that is it. Over-all, I feel it has a light, sweet, malty flavor to it. The hops are there, but it is an after thoguht. Over all it has a nice, light mouth-fell, and, IMOO, it could be a good conversion beer."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Notes: A good choice for initiating others into the world of great Microbrewed lagers."
"Pours a nice pale golden color with a lilting head that dissipates quickly. The carbonation is right on with this old standby. The smell is malty with a super slight ""skunky"" scent. The taste is great -- clean, clear but just bold enough to take this a few steps beyond the macro's. The mouthfeel is crisp but doesn't last too long. The drinkability is second to none --- some think this is a little bland but I think it's a perfect representation of a standard, simple, great tasting lager. This is Bud on steriods. I think you could server this to any macro drinker and they'd be pleasantly surprised. This will probably become one of my standard beers."
"A nice transiton beer. Pours out a yellow/caramel with a nice white head which dissappears quickly. tastes a bit bland, but it beleive this one is meant for refreshment, not of comlexity. The mouthfeel was quite fizzy but still good. Overally if youve got friends over and dont want ot stock up on BUD get this it will please both sides."
"Pale straw with a frothy white head. Leaves only the slightest trails of lace down the glass. Nose dominated by aspects of lemon zest, yeast and some sweetish malt. Tastes rather bready in the German pils style, with notes of the lemon zest, yeast and some grain. Mouthfeel is quite prickly and carbonated. This is one refreshing brew. It's easy to drink and serves well as a summer thirst quencher. Nice effort."
"The first two times I had this beer it was directly out of the bottle. The thing that comes to mind is ""alright."" It could definitely be better. It had a syrupy finish that detracted from the overall taste. The third time, in a glass, I was quite surprised at how light this beer looked. It reminded me of Coors Light. Very unexpected. All in all, not a bad beer. But not a good beer either."
"I have to say I wanted to like this brew but it just wasn't my cup of...well, beer."
"Bright deep golden. Medium body with a pleasant quality of lightly toasted malt. Crisp finish with slight afterburp of hops. No grapefruit, resiny hops here, but a spicy, floral aroma and flavor. Very refreshing."
"It's a shame this is old, because I expect the hops are wonderful. Unfortunately, they've all but disappeared. I'll have to try this again."
"Appearance: Appears a pale straw color gold with a nice sized white foaming head leaving speckled lacing without much consistency to the pattern. Aroma: Grainy and light in malt sweetness, there is just a touch of hop presence in the air, I mean I know the helles style lager is delicate but this is a beer marketed toward the masses not one I m proud to hoist from Victory at this point. Taste: Crisp refreshing grassy sweet texture from the imported malts and a good amount of bitterness here to obtain balance, overall disappointing in the flavor department whatever happened to my beloved export style lager, shame on you Bill and Ron your targeting a ""Bud/Miller/Coors"" crowd with this one what happened to ""we brew the type of beers that we like to drink""? Okay that was harsh considering this is a difficult style to make clean tasting balanced brew, I can also fathom how Victory needs a beer on the light side, but this one borders watery for me. Mouthfeel: Is thin carbonated water like texture, just no character. Drinkability: It's alright even good and refreshing but lacking the awesome flavor profile of the export style lager that anyone who purchased the Victory sampler found as a true jewel, in one word disappointing I was at least expecting a very flavorful Helles, oh well yeah I think I could drink a six pack of this without feeling anything. Light, crisp, refreshing lawnmower beer with no off tones, well constructed but lacking flavor."
"Was still in the all malt lager packaging but the case came with a flyer inside of it telling the about the change in recipe to the helles lager style. Pale yellow with a slim head disappears after a few sips with tiny bubbles rising to the top. Smells like husky grains and is somewhat grassy. Taste is a decent light sweet malt flavor a tinge of hops that are herbal tasting. Does quite well on the palate and is no way extreme in any which way. A very good take on a the german light lager style while not catering to anything specifically because it certainly has more flavor then any macro pale lager and as such is a very good substitute for them. Like a gateway drug of the beer world nothing great nothing bad just plain good is the new recipe. I expect to see Victory turn more peoples head then ever before. The new recipe is a victory for your taste not your pretensions."
"Didnâ€™t know a lager could bring such good sour, golden malt, and hop oil flavors. Combined well with the very soft mouthfeel. So, too much flavor for a lager? My American tastebuds have been dumbed down. Thanks I live close to Victory, so I think I had a very fresh bottle."
"Having gone to High School I consider Victory my home town brewery and support them when I can. I, however, do not have much good to say about the new All Malt Lager."
"Thanks to Francisweizen for the chance to try it."
"Smooth malty lager that is quite thirst quenching and low in ABV so this lends it to being highly drinkable. Light amber in color and very full bodied for a lager it is another excellent beer from Victory, with a hoppy finish and floral bouquet. Smooth mouthfeel and taste make this a great year round beer. Better on tap."
"Everybody around here loves yuengling so there alway scared to try any of Victory's beers. This is the one I always tell them to get. It's always available and it gives the macro something they can not only enjoy, but appreciate. Clear copper in color with a fluffy white head. Sweet maltiness in the aroma and slight hops. Taste is malty with a slight flavor of hops in the finish, not much bitterness from the hops. For what it is, it's a great beer. It's like they just did what every macro brewery does, only they did it much better."
"Thanks to PintofAle!"
"A slighty hazy golden body topped by a frothy white head. A lot hay and grass in the aroma. A soft malt opener, swept along with a gentle hop brush. As stated, superbly balanced. Light bodied but not thin. A fine session lager, a hell of a lawnmower beer. An excellent crossover beer for the B/M/C/H/C drinker willing to try something a little better."
"Pours a cloudy gold with a foamy fading white head and some trickles of lace. Floral hop and sweet malt aroma. Medium malt with caramel notes. Fruity, and citrusy lime-like hop bitterness. A slight alcohol fuminess weaves in and out. Very fluid and drinkable. Nice summer treat!"
"Poured a nice deep golden color with nice rocky head,a slight malty sweet aroma not much to speak of.taste was nice and fruity witha good malt backbone,very drinkable.A real nice lager not to wimpy but realy drinkable,I would seek it out again when i wanna drink something a little lighter but with some real substance."
"Nice warm weather beer."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a very tall foamy white head and a thick stream of bubbles racing up from the bottom center of the glass. Nose is herbal and grassy with some faint musty notes. Light to medium in body and quite crisp. Taste is lots of sweet malts and soft grains up front followed by some yeast and citrusy hops. A pretty nice lager and a nice brew for the summer. Thanks to francisweizen for the sample!"
"Musty (sneaker) malt nose. Yellow color in the glass with lots of bubbles.. quite carbonated. Sturdy white head that lasts and follows your lips. Taste is dominated by must malt with a slight sweetness in the finish. Medium mouth. This was a little dissappointing for a Victory product. Don't get me wrong it is not a bad beer.. just not the quality or complexity of their other selections."
"Prost!"
"Bought a case of this recently and I don't remember this beer being so light in color. it's a golden color with tinges of amber. Still very good, but doesn't seem as malty as the above draft version."
"PS: the new version is very similar to the old one, but now it tastes more like Miller High Life! Judge that one for yourself!!!"
"I found two different tastes with this one depending on whether it was consumed very cold or as it warms a bit. If consumed very cold, it hits with a strong malt flavor with a fairly strong bite on the tongue (not a bad bite, just not one you would expect with a very malty beer) and finishes off with more traditional lager flavor. As the beer warms, the malt taste lingers more and smooths out. Definitely an easier brew to drink as it is not really overpowering with malt as one might expect."
"Pours a clear golden oak color with a thick off-white head that fades rather quickly to a thin layer. Leaves a spotty lace. Alot of malt and some citrus hop on the nose. True to its name, this is one malty brew. Very little hop presence. Slightly above average mouthfeel and good carbonation for the style. A very drinkable beer. If it was more readily available to me I'd definitely keep this in my fridge. Would make a good beer to introduce a newbie to the world of good beer. Thanks go out to aaronh for introducing it to me."
"Drinkability: Not a beer that I cared for. I was too reminded of a macro beer. It's interesting to read the other reviews of this beer. Most seem to think that it is a very good example of this beer style. Given that this is the first beer of this style I've reviewed, I am probably not fully appreciating what this beer has to offer, but I just didn't care for it. One positive thing to take away from this is that I like hops (and lots of 'em) in my beer."
"Pours a very clear pale golden hue with lots of bubbling action and a small white head. The smell is that of a combination of grain and a light citrusy hop. The taste reveals more of the citrusy character with a hop bite on the nose and followed by earthy grain malt. This light bodied brew finishes crisp and clean and goes down super easy. Not highly complex, but tasty nonetheless. Thanks to Rotsaruch for sending me this brew! Cheers!"
"Simple, easy-drinking lager from Victory. Typical gold appearance with some thin lace atop. The smell of this lager was impressive though, as most lagers I have encountered don't have much complexity in their aromas. This had a malty aroma, reminding me of a malty German lager, but also had a fruity scent, much like apricots. Taste is malt dominated and smooth going down with little carbonation. Could possibly use some more hop flavor to balance things out more, but all in all another quality brew from Victory."
"This is a slightly sweet beer, and not nearly as hoppy as I expected from Victory. Still, it's well balanced and very drinkable. The Finish is a little sweeter than I expected and doughy."
"Rich clear gold, with a slightly off-white head. The flavour is actually somewhat tangy, with a slightly bitter hop finish. That had me wondering as well - I expected a hop-less beer given the All Malt title. Curious. Pleasant in the mouth and going down, I appreciated the less polished feel - this is what macro import lagers are missing."
"Crystal clear, light gold in color, with a very thin head which dissipates to nothing rather quickly. Ample and even carbonation. The aroma is clean, light, and dominated by a grainy-malt and a slight nose of German hops. Flavor itself starts off with a good hit of grain up front, followed by an exceedingly smooth and crisp malt body and a slightly lemony hop finish. Just a hint of yeast gives the aftertaste something of a sweet bread flavor. Very well-balanced and very clean, but strong enough to hold up against, say, a spicy pizza."
"Damned tasty beer with a great drinkability, I'm not usually big on lagers, but this one hit the nail on the head. I would drink a lot more of these if I could get them, thanks to NeroFiddled for a sample of a great lager!"
"I think the bottle that I tried was bad, so it's hard to give an objective review of this beer. Even if it were ok, I think I would have gone for Yuengling if I was in a mood for a lager."
"Beautiful golden color, with a nice white head that quickly dissipates, leaving no lace. A thin head is retained throughout. Nice floral scent, with hints of hay or grass. A crisp, clean taste, with a fuller mouthfeel than one might anticipate from this beer's appearance. Pretty drinkable, but if you're having many different beers in a drinking session, try this one first...it's pretty complex, but can cleanse the palate pretty well, paving the way for others. Victory continues to impress me with their range of great brews."
"This was a big change from all my previous Victory experiences-Mild hopping!  This is an excellent lager.  It pours a nice deep golden color with a thin white head which dissipates fairly quickly and leaves no lace.  The aroma is clean and fruity, with bread-like overtones.  The taste is malty and smooth, with enough hops to clean the palate.  The finish is very clean, with just a hint of a fruity aftertaste.  I do believe I could drink these frequently (read ""pound"").  While different than many of the Victory beers I have tried, it is truly excellent.  A great Dortmunder."
"I bet you this brew on tap is lovely, pretty good in the bottle to say the least. A raw lager, not like most at all â€¦ light yet flavourful. As others have noted this could be a great crossover beer if not just a brew for macro drinkers to enjoy."
"5KD approved."
"NO adjunct tastes what so ever, it's a no brainer what all malt does for beer. A solid, flavorful workhorse of a brew. The type of beer you could enjoy anytime for any occasion."
"This beer poured a light golden color and formed a nice, huge white head that left some nice lace.  A medium amount of carbonation present.  An aroma of hops, malt and a touch of floral.  The flavor was of hops, malt and a touch of citrus.  The finish had elements of the citrus and was a bit tart.  Not a bad lager."
"Pours a nice golden color, with a white head that dies off and leaves a nice ring of lace around the glass. On the nose is light toasted bread, and touch of hops. On the palate there is a slight tart / sourness that tastes like green apples...whatever it was it tasted good, and I liked it. This is a super refreshing brew. I really enjoyed this brew...good stuff!"
