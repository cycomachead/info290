"Overall - I found another Weltenburger outlet in Southern California! Mattern Sausage, in Orange, carries the stuff. This is good news as Weltenburger is not available at BevMo, Total Wine, of High Times. This is a very nice lager. The flavor is subdued yet complex. Absolutely chugable. My only issue with this beer is that I wish it were a bit more aggressive."
"A good German lager, tastes of husky grains and leafy hops.  Hay, some citrus, and a little bit of white bread.  Clean, tasty and thirst quenching.  4/5"
"This one was another really good beer from Weltenburg, definitely a brewery that seems to constantly deliver for me and this one was no exception. The beer was very smooth and really easy to drink, the palate being a particular highlight but the taste and smell were not back either. Very refreshing and with some good fruits and citrus coming through as well, this one was a great beer and one well worth picking up."

"This is unlike any helles I have ever had, and probably goes somewhere else for 5.6 abv.  The result though is really memorable, absolutely love it."

"O) Another excellent Helles.  If you see it, buy it and guzzle it down as soon as it is cold."

"I really love this beer but can't get over how different the taste is from the smell."

"I so wanna make some sort of Obama joke, but, alas, the spellings just don't mesh... Anyway, this stuff pours a mostly clear lemon-straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises barley, mild flowers, and a strong twinge of lemon rind that shocks from the start through to the middle, not unlike a bolt of pain from the sciatic nerve when that uppity ganglion group gets grumpy. The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger sense of lemon, but one that is simultaneously milder, softer, less rind-y. A vein of lightly-buttered biscuit pervades in a constant undertow, providing a nice semi-counterpunch to the lightly-fruity aspects. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly creamy feel. Overall, an enjoyable helles, something I could see drinking regularly with ease."

"Golden colour, clear, medium fading head, good lacing. Aroma was initially reminiscent of a Premium Lager but this gave way to malt and vanilla and later yeast and berries. Tasted toasted honey, orange, malt, hints of grain and wheat. Finish was sharp, wheaty and slightly bitter. Texture slightly thick, heavy carbonation resulted in a coarse edge. Overall this was more of an Export than a Helles as it had that slightly in your face character. Was impressed by the depth which was better than normal."

"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Munich Helles Lager."

"O - I really enjoyed this brew. I've had quite a few Munich Helles Lagers lately and this was the most enjoyable."

"O- An ok beer. i got this as a gift so i cant complain to much but not something i would spend money on."
"I may just be a weakling, but does anybody else think they oughtta make large drinking vessels with two handles instead of one?"
"Poured a luminous gold with two fingers of white fluffy head. Laces well on my oversized pilsner glass. Smell of yeasty malt and lemongrass. Not a lot on the nose. Smooth malty flavor with a bit of lemony citrus sweetness. Nice vague hop bitterness on the back of the tongue. Bubbly and light mouthfeel. Very drinkable. Extremely refreshing. Great pizza or pretzel beer. This would be a good stepping off point to get your BMC friends to try something new."
"O: Overall nice level of drinkability, not much to hold you back here making for an easy brainless downer. Helles is a style not often given the respect and craftmenship it deserves, and this fairs worthy to good by style. My gold standard for such continues to be Hacker Pschorrâ€™s Munich Gold."
"Overall: An impressive, polished lager with a great floral hop character. Perhaps that's what the ""baroque"" label refers to. Very nicely done."
"O - A Decent session beer"
"Medium bodied and fuller than expected with a nice balance of bready yeast, crisp light fruit, biscuit/pale malt, earthy hops, grass and straw. There is a nice crisp, floral hop bite up front that lingers throughout over the sweeter malt, apple and pear notes into a dry finish."
"O: Really easy to drink and really clean and pleasant."
"D- Not a bad helles but just not my cup of tea."
"Light orange with a dense, white head with excellent retention and nice lacing, this is what I'd expect from a good helles. Maybe just a touch of haze? The nose is decent. Surprisingly, there's a little sulfur up front, and the malt character is very rustic, with a raw, grainy bouquet. There's also a delicate hop character, light and with earthy aroma. Not the cleanest of lagers, there's a touch of yeast here, reminding me of a kellerbier. I'm initially disappointed, but this is really growing on me. And part of the reason for this the reason it tastes. Delicate and complex, this is a joy to drink. Light, earthy hop flavor with a little lemon as well, there's a firm bitterness that balances the malt flavors here. Rustic, a little bready and with a touch of cotton candy, this is top notch. Drying on the finish with a firm bitterness, a little earth and some bread. Excellent stuff, this."
"Draft at Gourmet Haus Staudt, half liter served in a Weltenburger stein. Clear golden body with an inch of froth, solid helles appearance. Clean and crackery pale malt and lager yeast aroma, not much to it but quite good for the style. Palate is great, lightly sweet up front with pils malt and crusty bread, honey-like in the mid palate with a bitter and dry finish. No frills, exceptionally clean and drinkable, this is great stuff."
"Drinkability: very quaffable. I bet on a warm day it's even better, but I'm still enjoying this one here quite a lot indeed. These kinds of beers are made for drinkin', brother!"
"Poured into s 1/2 liter stein a chill hazed lighter golden with a fluffy egg shell colored crown atop that left broken glogs of lace as it settled slowly.Germal malt aromas,iron,a tinge of cripy bread,and honey.Flavors are sweetish upfront with some honey,maybe some light vanilla pod?Drying crisp finish makes it highly drinkable along with the sturdy mouthfeel.This is traditional top of the line malt driven Bavarian helles,very nice."
"Nice beer. I love this style and so it had a leg up to start, but this is a good (and very fresh!) brew, the only flaw being perhaps that it lacks quite enough bite and bitterness."
"The body was nicely clean and round. Drinkability was terrific. I could easily spend a nice long day with this brew. Overall, a wonderful example of the style. A must try when you see it."
"Overall a decent lager but nothing ultra special here besides the taste."
"D -- Outstanding. I'm gonna remember this one every time I get a craving for a good Bavarian Helles."
"Whatever it is, it's a good Helles. It is very close to a Czech Pilsener, but does have less hops spice/aroma and more malt to it. it's cleaner and crispier than a German lager typical. Bright pour, huge head that settled nicely. Faint hops aroma overshadowed by the malt. A bit grainy...like corn. Very easy drinking. Served at about 50 degrees F, should have chilled it a bit more."
"Very easy to drink on this hot, humid night in Florida."
"pour is beautiful. thick cream white head about three fingers tall. tight white bubble with nice lace. yellow golden color with small particles throughout. the head smells of a bright honey and caramel. a bread with hints of apple and vanilla. extremely light. extremely delicious in the first minute it hits the air. the beer is straight malt style with a neutral bitterness. yet it still manages to have a very mild straw finish. a crisp mouth feel with apple fruit, very subtle sweet citrus, caramel, honey, and a mild earthy dry finish. i think i found my summer beer."
"While it's not my favorite example of this style, this one was quite good. However, if it's on the shelf next to Weihenstephaner Original, I'm grabbing that."
"D: A nice beer, a little more hop character would make a great brew. Nonetheless, a step up from the Urtyp Hell I had last week."
"Drinkability: very enjoyable all around beer. Nice flavors, scents and easily drinkable. This would be a great transition beer for BMC drinkers."
"The taste is also very nice, a solid, lively helles character with plenty of bread, honey, herbs, and lemon. It's lively and crisp. However, the feel is a little on the thin side, slightly watery."
"Pours a hazy, golden yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, a small dryness and a fruity, white grape-ish smell. In the taste, just like the aroma, dry fruitiness, with white grape being the the biggest flavor. A smooth and medium to small bodied mouthfeel and a dry lager like aftertaste. Nice fruitiness and quite smooth, nice lager."
"Drinkability is high, this is an awesome lager. Wow, I don't drink many lagers, but in the last few days I've had some of the best I've ever had...one local, and this one from Bavaria, pretty much the opposite side of the world. The only ding on drinkability is this isn't the cheapest, by the bottle, although it was honestly pretty much the same price as the draft keller bier I was referring to from Deschutes."
"4/4/4/4/4.5"
"Bottle pours a clear, straw yellow body with a small white head that leaves some speckled lacing. Aroma of spicy and grassy hops and toasted caramel. Light body has a zesty and tingly carbonation. Taste is dominated by a spicy hop bitterness. A spearamint tea note emerges midway through. Toasty and malty caramel is up to the task for balance. A solid German lager."
"This is a very enjoyable Helles, and quite sessionable if needed. Smooth, creamy, balanced, and refreshing. Recommended."
"Drinkability is high if you like german lagers, a good beer to be sure but not something to seek out unless German beer is really your thing."
"M&D: while it's clean and crisp on the mouthfeel, the carbonation also remains pretty restrained and not too lively; the superior texture plus little sign of alc. makes this stronger version of Helles a pleasant beer to quaff. I can't think of anything bad about this lager. But, if anything, it's the slight lack of character. Considering the nice balance and superbly clean flavour profile, however, really this is a very well-executed product."
"Poured into a stange, this beer is hazy blonde-straw with a big puffy white head that holds well. The smell is mostly comprised of lemon notes and grass, while the flavor brings out more of the same. Maybe a little too much puckering lemon actually. Subtle hop bitterness is towards the back, and the beer has a light body with a kiss of carbonation. Solid in every other aspect, but the sweetness makes this borderline sessionable."
"D: Very tasty helles lager, crisp, refreshing and a nice malt sweetness/hop bite balance with the malt taking precedence as typical of the style."
"D: I could drink this stuff all night, a very drinkable and delicious beer!"
"Pours a good of shade, slightly dull yellow. Hardly any bubbles , and very little to no head. Just a small ringof foam that holds on till about three-quarters through the half liter of beer. Very light grassy, pilsnery, crystal, malty goodness hits you with the first sip. Te finish s a tangy light hop finish. The palate is a little dry, tangy, but very refreshing. Great beer to be served in big mugs."
"It is very good, a ""sipper"" in helles form. It would be ideal, except that I don't think a good helles ought be a ""sipper""."
"D - Man, if they sold these in 6 or 4 packs... they would be expensive, but they would move a lot quicker off shelves. Always glad to find lagers that I like though, and will look for in the future."
"D. Pretty drinkable. Moderate abv and clean finish."
"Drinkability: superb session lager. Easy to quaff and somewhat refreshing. Find some of this and enjoy it."
"Pours a beutiful golden yellow color, with a fluffy white head that blossoms above the top of my brewery stein. Nice retention and lacing as well. The aroma opens bready, and finishes with a flowery hop character. The flavor explodes on the tounge a perfectly subtle balance of hops and malt, with an incredible stoney finsh. This is exactly what beer this color should taste like. Perfect after a long hot day and exactly what beer this color should taste like. With a nice creamy finish and delicous aftertaste I could drink this all night."
"A refreshing and very flavourful lager, really hit the spot"
"Overall - An excellent example of a Munich Helles... well worth a try..."
"This beer pours a hazy gold. Has the typical head that one would expect from a Helles, and it left tracing down the glass. The beer had a midly malty flavor, though not overpowering and not cloying. There was a hint of hops, but not much more. Overall, a fine example of a Munich helles. Try one and enjoy."
"With the exception of their doppelbock (Kloster Asam-Bock), I haven't been bowled over by Klosterbrauerei Weltenburg beer. Barock-Hell is yet another better than average offering that does nothing to excite my taste buds or make me want to give it another go round."
"Drinkability: quite drinkable , would definatly be a good session brew. There is a bit of a wierd vegie flavor in there to me , but it grew on me as i quaffed."
"Very subdued and mellow in all areas. Really a treat and well put together. Easily a sessionable product, it held my interest till the end and I was dissapointed to have to move on to something else."
"A rather placid German lager, though nothing offends any of the senses, there's little to recommend as well."
"16.9 ounce bottle. Code date 20.01.02 H."
" I would like to find another of these and try it and maybe review this one over."
"SlÃ inte!"
"Not quite a thrill a minute, but decent as German pilsnener-type lagers go. Pours a frothy head with big bubbles over a familiar German straw colord body. Low carbonation leaves a pleasing tickle. Somewhat doughy/biscuity malt action nicely counterbalanced by hops, unfortunately, its means neither is very noticeable. Goes down pretty nicely, at least. A touch of hop-bitter aftertaste remains on the tongue."
"Drinkability Â– This was a great Â“first FridayÂ” beer. Nothing ends the workweek quite like a good German lager."
"Overall, this proved to quite drinkable and enjoyable. One of this style that I'd be willing to come back to."
"Nice lager with an assertive Bite to it."
"Medium gold color. Small head. Aroma is malty and slightly sweet. A medium bodied helles. Malts are light and biscuty. Hops are floral and crisp. Overall it is kind of fruity, orange, lemon and apricots. Touches of ginger and raisins. Well balanced. Light and refreshing. Nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Pours with a big white head that settles into dense tufts of foam. The aroma is extremely malty and sweet (it almost smells like a sweet fruit juice). The taste is light and sweet. Not a great finish...slightly sticky and unsatisfying. Very easy beer to drink, though...and I could see myself enjoying a good number of these."
"Nothing exciting in the flavor department, just some sweet malts and a little bit of hops in the finish. It's pleasant to drink though and definitely would be a great session beer. The hops in the finish is what hit me as making it highly drinkable. It keeps just interesting enough to be happy."
"Wow, this beer pours a very, very light pale straw color, almost looks like it has a ""watered-down"" characteristic. The head is huge but soon settles to a Â¼Â” thin but perfectly white collar. Nose is of malt, sweet malt and not much else. Introduction is of a crisp sweet maltiness, low mouthfeel with some feint bitterness in the finish. There is not much else to say about this beer really, sort of non-descript, vaguely memorable, a very restrained beer, subtle, but somehow - this a really great drinking beer."
"A triumph of the gentle touch."
