3.25,5.9,3,3,3.5,3.5,3,"nice for an airport beer. poured goldenrod yellow and lively from a green bottle. smells like nice german bready malts and more of a hop kick than ive been able to enjoy in bosnia. flavor is big and balanced, a touch skunky likely from poor handling, but there is plenty of depth here with the pale malts in the lead. feel works well, lighter in body and good carbonation. easy drinking and i would have had sever if airport prices were more friendly. not a bad beer all in all.","StonedTrippin","Feb 02, 2012"

3.63,18.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"M & D: This is where this beer really shines. There is a foamy, smooth, almost sticky (soapy? but not in a bad way) mouthfeel that sticks to your mouth and goes well with a Bismarck herring sandwich! Very drinkable. Would love to try this again, but doubtful to find it outside of Austria.","fullsweep","May 29, 2010"

2,-34.9,2,2,1.5,3,2.5,"Had this recently in Vienna and reviewing from notes. Picked this one up in can form at a local sausage stand. Taste is weak with a hint of lemon zest. Not very good. Watery with little flavor. Some grain and lemon at the end. I steered clear of this one the rest of my trip. Like a Bud Light... Easy to drink, but why would you want to?","BucBasil","Feb 06, 2010"

2.88,-6.2,3,2.5,3,3,3,"D: An overly simplistic lager. This is a drinking beer that will come out almost intact from the way it went in. Not something that I would ever choose willingly.","sunrisesolara","Sep 30, 2009"
2.83,-7.8,3,2.5,3,2.5,3,"This beer pour a clear pale golden color. The head is small, and recedes within seconds leaving no lacing. The aroma is of cereal malt, a hint of noble hops, and a little skunk (it was bottled in green glass. The taste is like the aroma, but without the skunkiness. Still it is a rather dull taste. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with very low carbonation. So low that it really adds to the lifelessness of this beer. Overall, this beer is mediocre verging on bad. I will not drink this again.","KarlHungus","Feb 06, 2009"

1.54,-49.8,3,1.5,1,2,2,"Drinkability: A worthless brew not even worth trying in my opinion. Maybe it was because I had it from a can; maybe it was because I tried it on an airplane. Nevertheless, I was entirely turned off by this beer.","wahhmaster","Aug 11, 2008"
3.12,1.6,3,3.5,3,3,3,"Nearly everything about this beer is slight. It could, so far as I'm concerned, never offend, but it is not as crisp and cooling as I would expect from a helles. I think my ""taste"" rating is the one that is skewed, but I honestly would not categorize this as ""average," even if it is only slightly above.","TheMistler","Dec 18, 2007"
3.2,4.2,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Overall; better than a Euro lager, but not overly so. Considering the price, it was decent enough.","JohnfromDublin","Aug 07, 2007"
2.95,-3.9,2.5,2.5,3,3,3.5,"Color is a golden and plain, head is reminiscent of a rapidly balding man...starts thin, dissolves rapidly leaving splotches before disappearing entirely. Smell is abnormally sweet for a European lager and the aftertaste, though finishing clean, starts with sweeter, sugary flavors. Straw like aromas are also present. Taste is simple, unremarkable, though well balanced...designed to be a session quaffer, not something to appreciate. Vienna and Austria offers much better beers in its brewpubs and larger supermarkets, but sadly, this is sometimes the only beer available in clubs and trendy bars. But still, its better than Stella, BMC, and the ilk. I would compare its quality to that of a fresh Heineken.","allboutbierge","Oct 23, 2006"
2.83,-7.8,3,2.5,3,2.5,3,"Had a big, yellow can of this on an Austrian Air flight recently. A very average lager with nothing to make it stand out from the crowd. Slightly overcarbonated, and mild hints of adjuncts in the aroma (not so much in the flavour). Drinkable, and certainly not offensive, but not worth seeking out. Doesn't really strike me as an authentic Helles, by any means, although I'm not that experienced with the style.","crwills","Oct 17, 2006"
2.5,-18.6,2,2,2.5,3,3,"Poured in a yellow color and with a finger of quickly disappearing foam. The lacing was OK. The taste was of bread and citrus which is alright on a sunny day. It was rather sweet but not in an offensive way. I found it an average beer for its style but it should probably be served well chilled for best result.","JanM","Jul 02, 2006"
3.01,-2,4,3,2.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a bottle with a good head. The color was a crisp golden hue. It smelled a bit skunky. It was sharp on the front of you tongue and fizzed nicely in your mouth. The taste was reminiscent of rain. If it were to rain beer this is what it would taste like. Overall not great, but it's more drinkable than say Corona.","AChamberlain","Jun 28, 2006"
2.19,-28.7,3.5,2,2,3,2,"A not-too-good beer, that is more of a Euro lager than a Helles Bock.","bark","Sep 10, 2005"
2.18,-29,3,2.5,2,2,2,"Aroma herbal and hoppy, quite pleasant but faint. Start is sweetish, malty with corn, uninspiring. Body medium, unbalanced. Strong sour notes in the middle, even stronger in the finish. Bittersweet aftertaste.","ernie","Jun 01, 2004"
3.08,0.3,3,2.5,3.5,3,3,"Pours clear gold under a 1.5 finger white head that seems thin at first, but adds some contour as it fades fairly slowly, leaving just a touch of lace. A slightly skunky hops nose is framed by a bit of sweet malt. The mouth is standard light and prickly. A touch of sweet bready grain opens, chased quickly by strong metallic hoppy bitterness. There are shades of espresso, but it is not really dry. There's not much aftertaste - just a quick hint of spice and a bit of bitter at the back of the throat. It's OK, but hardly remarkable.","Globetrotter","May 22, 2004"
2.53,-17.6,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"A mediocre austrian lager, Ottakringer may well be the most common brew it those places where you only find the mediocre, like vienna's large clubs. Boring straw translucid, the smell is very slight, tipically macro, with some malt and some hops, but not really exciting. The taste is bitter, watery and rather disappointingly uneventful. thin flow.","Andreji","Jun 02, 2003"
2.63,-14.3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Ottakringer Helles: Imported in a friends carry on bag right from Austria, in a half liter can. Pours a pale yellow, with a bright white head, kind of soap foamy. Bit of skunk in the aroma, not too much else. The taste is what youd expect from a macro-euro lager: slight skunk taste, weak grainy adjunct taste. Extremely light bodied, and very easy to drink. Not a lot of taste, very clean aftertaste. Do not bother going to Viena to pick one up.","jackndan","Beers"
1.58,-48.5,2,1.5,1.5,2,1.5,"A really bad helles. This is as bad as they come. Real flat, bland, and even a bit sticky and rough. Really boring. I can't say too much about this one. I was expecting something just that bit better. It is very rare to find new beers to try in Sydney, and its really dissapointing when you try new beers that taste like this. Dissapointing.","rastaman","0"
