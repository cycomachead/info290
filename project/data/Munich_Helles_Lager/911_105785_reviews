"Nice easy drinking lager with character.   Bready malt notes and grassy hops blend into one great tasting beer.   Has a light skunkiness on the aroma but the taste is true gold.   I would call it light bodied.    Epitome of a sessionable lager.  Picking up some lemon zest on the finish.    Very enjoyable."

"O-This is a great lager. It drinks easily, packs a lot of flavor but doesn't overwhelm. I don't know enough about German beers to say if this is truly traditional, but a beer like this is what I think of when I think of good, light German lagers. I would happily drink more of this."

"A fantastic helles."

"With the touch of skunk, this beer unfortunately reminds me of a Heineken (which actually used to be one of my favorite lawn mowing beers).  There is no freshness date on the label.  I see these beers habitually being stored warm on a store shelf, with fluorescent light beating down on them.  As it is, this beer is good but not excellent, and I think freshness might be an issue here.  I paid 3-something for the bottle."

"OI: My favorite helles (currently) due to the malt and hop flavors. Can't wait to try at the brewery."

"My lone non-MF beer today, I just had to go for a nice traditional German helles.  This stuff pours a clear straw topped by a finger of off-white foam.  The nose comprises flowers, mild greens, and a hint of biscuit.  The taste brings in more of the same, the hops brighter now, and the biscuit and greens sweeter.  A tasty combination, to say the least.  The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp finish.  Overall, you gotta hand it to the Germans for continuing to produce solid, enjoyable, and--dare I say it?--refreshing beers like this one.  Good times."

"Probably the best Helles I've ever had, really quite pleasant."
"O 4 - very solid Munich helles lager - easily  among the best in the world. I'd drink this any time, any day."

"Clear straw color with a fizzy white head that dies down rather quickly. Grassy hops fill the aroma with soft bready pilsner malt notes. Clean lager taste. Light bodied and slightly sweet. So smooth and easy to drink. This is a benchmark Bavarian lager. Not sure if it's worth seeking out, but if you are a fan of Munich Helles you can do no wrong here. I could drink this all day long."

"What a great beer. German brewing as good as we can get without visiting Germany. If you see this reasonably priced delight jump on it."

"(O)- A really nice crisp and refreshing beer for summer. Great traditional beers like this get lost with all the big sours and barrel aged monsters coming out of everywhere."
""
"The good tap handle =good beer theory works. Sometimes."
"Leans to the malty side with a cross between grain and pale malts. Decent hop in the swallow. The aftertaste is brief and leaves a milky taste in my mouth. Quite rich for the style, low carbonation."

"Poured into a Schaumburger pilsner glass. Pours a light golden amber with a half finger white head with good retention due to active carbonation, moderate lacing. Aroma of bready with hints of biscuit malt, grassy hops and lemon. Flavor is slightly sweet bready and biscuit malt, grassy, slightly peppery hops, light citrus and a touch of wheat. A nice, lingering light lemon, hop and malt aftertaste to the finish. Light to medium bodied with good carbonation. A light, pleasant helles lager that hits all the right notes. Flavor is not intense, but appropriate for the style. A very nice beer for drinking with a meal for non intrusive malt and hops. Sessionable."

"Overall what I expected it to be, a great German Bavarian lager, light and drinkable with plenty of complex flavors, lighter complex flavors but still all there, nice hop profile, etc. I could drink beers like this all day and not feel a thing."

"Andech's Helles, whether on tap or in the bottle, is a sheer joy to drink. It's all sunshine and rainbows. Crisp, bright, delicious. Grab yourself a .5 liter and drink up, ladies!"

"Bright and clear, light gold with a fluffy white cap. Good head retention overall and lacing was spotty on the glass. Soft malty aroma with notes of floral and grassy hops, almost bready. Mild bitterness, floral and grassy with malt sweetness and slight mineral flavour. Sort of spicy in the finish, but this was mild in character and balanced by the malt and more pronounced bitterness at the end. Medium/light bodied, moderate to low carbonation, on the dry side, soft on the palate, decent texture. I quite enjoyed it."

"Overall: Awesome vollbier helles lager. Solid malts and Bavarian hop characterics. I could definitely enjoy more of these in the future"

"Goes down way too quick. So clean. Has everything a perfect helles should have, with a perfect soft but noticeable bitterness, and doesn't have any of what brings downs so many other inferior ones."
""
"Great, clean, fresh, smooth Munich Helles lager. It's what Budweiser wants to be. Eminently quaffable , you can sit Ina bier garden and drink mas after mas after mas of this beer. I've had it at Andechs and this reminds me of Munich. Repeatable beer."
"500ml bottle served in a pilsener glass. L3013 indicated on the back label. Pours a translucent gold with a fluffy, one inch, bright white head that eventually settles into a thin, consistent skim. Tiny bubbles are visible adhering to the sides of the glass and effervescing from the base to the underside of the cap. Nose is grassy and expresses a hint of sour mash and skunk. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of some light, fruity esters towards the back and a faint noble hops presence at the end. Mouthfeel is light and lively with a crisp finish. Overall, a good Helles; simple and refreshing. I'd love to try this fresh on-draft."

"Taste is sweet to start, touch of citrus in the middle, to a rounded bitter close. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean, smooth, and drinkability is nice and easy. Session-worthy."
""
""
"overall: Frankly a disappointment. I would not get this beer again as I would get most of their other, kind of a shame."
"O -- After remembering such good things about Andechs, and thoroughly enjoying the Hefeweizen, I'm just a little surprised at how lackluster the Helles is. The malts are good, but rather weak and carry a drier, crackery character that I find in some Bavarian Helles that don't prove to be my favorites."
""
""
"O: This beer is an excellent representation of the style and has lots of flavors of malts and hops. If you put a blindfold on me, I could picture myself drinking this in a Biergarten in Germany."
""
""
"Bready malt, lemon pith, quenching with a dry grassy finish. Very clean, Light bodied, crisp and well carbonated. It has a prototypical and flawless Helles blueprint. Very drinkable and worth trying if you like the style."
"The bee is clear and pale golden with a small white head. The aroma offers lightly toasted bread, German malts. Lightly sweet with a dry finish. Perfectly balanced with pleasant hop character. So smooth. I could drink this by the liter. Stellar."
""

"O - This is a very fine helles that I'd be glad to have at anytime. Yum."
""
"I got this at Bierkraft in Brooklyn while picking up a wet hop Blue Point bottle. This refreshing and tasty beer is very bright in the glass poured from the 500 ml bottle. Golden hay notes overlay the malt nose. Great balanced flavor with plenty of heft for a helles. Even better as it warms up. This is a very well made, extremely enjoyable beer."
