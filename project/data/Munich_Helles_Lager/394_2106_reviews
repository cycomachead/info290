"Watered down Miller lite?  I can't believe this was on the craft beer shelf."

"Got this at the beach last year at a local craft beer seller. Took a six pack on the beach. Good drinking beer. Had a light crisp hop flavor at first. The malt smell and taste is a little low for me. Light wheat color to it. Had a thin head to it. Alot better than my go to beer miller lite. So it a keeper."

"This is a darned fine beer, nice color and aroma and very drinkable. I found it had a nice hoppy aftertaste which I enjoyed. I thought it was slightly flat which detracted from the ""Feel"" score.  I'm not a huge fan of German style beers but this is one nicest I've tasted."

"Got this in a sixer exchange. Nice, but not memorable."

"Honey yellow in color with excellent clarity. Poured with a short, bright white foam that quickly reduced to a thin wispy cap. Fresh grain, biscuit malt, fresh grass, and light herbal aromas. Medium bodied with a delicate lager feel up front followed by sharp, tongue twisting tanginess through middle and a clean, crisp, dry finish. Bready, biscuity malt flavors throughout with herbal hop tanginess through the middle. Finishes with a biscuity malt aftertaste. An awesome, refreshing, easy-drinking, malty, German lager."

""

"Round and grainy. A very good example of the style. On the thin side as it should be but it has ample carbonation making this very spritzy. Grainy finish with a whiff of hop pepper. Short grassy aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a fantastic Helles that is easy to drink and a true representation of the style. There is a lot to be said for low alcohol but high taste solid drinkable beers, and this one falls squarely in that category. A fantastic Helles that should be rated as one of the best it the category."

"Yellow gold pale big aroma fresh lemony hops and bready malts. Crisp, refreshing, light mix of perfectly balanced malts and hops. This dissapeared in minutes. Great aftertaste. One helluva lager."
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow! This IS the best session beer. If there is one beer I could drink for the rest of my life STOUDTS GOLD would be it. Simply a great refreshing beer with an unparallel taste. Picked it up in Pittsburgh and can't wait to grab some more next time I'm back."
""
""
""
""
""
"This really has good characteristics. The grassiness is towards a pilsner but not quite. Easily one of my favorite sessionable lagers."

"Ovearll - Reach for this the next time you want a good, easy drinking brew when your watching a game, sitting outside, grilling, or just want a great pennsylvania lager! Enjoy! Cheers!"

"This is a nicely built, well crafted, easy-to-drink helles lager. I'm impressed with the depth this beer has considering it's one of the more simplistic styles. This is a very, nice refreshing lager that I wouldn't mind having again."
""
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours pale golden wit short-lived, white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of grassy noble hops and pale malt. Body is medium and crisp. Taste is of grain, grassy hops and pale malt. Finish is clean, well balanced. Nice session brew."
"Crisp and peppery-spicy. Honey and cracker malt flavors, but lacking a bit in some malt body and yeast color for a Munich helles. Some Champagne-like fruitiness and somewhat surprisingly-bold hop bitterness, and flavor to a slightly lesser extent. A lil bit more malt richness and body and I could see drinking this more often. 'Twas a fine palate cleanser and flavor compliment for the fish chowder and salty pretzel I had with it."
""
""
""
"O: When a Helles is done right, it's a beautiful thing to experience. This one is done right. Great balance, flavor is simple but vibrant and bright. Flawlessly brewed. This is the best American made Helles I've ever had, and it tastes pretty damn authentic. Between this beer and their pilsner, Stoudts brews some truly top-notch lagers."
""
"Poured a chill hazy yellowish golden with a foamy white head that settled into a thin bubbly lacing with a minimal amount of sticking. Aromas of honey grains and floral, spicy hops. Good carbonation and a crisp, dryish, creamy smooth medium bodied mouthfeel. Delicious tasting, honey spread over a grainy cracker, a cleansing spiciness from the hops, a subtle fruity flavor comes out in middle, and a grainy, spicy herbal finish. This is a really tasty and balanced Munich lager."

"12 ounce bottle into pilsener glass, no bottle dating. Pours fairly clear golden straw color with a nice 1-2 finger dense fluffy white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big pear, grape, apple, pepper, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and earthy spiciness. Damn nice aromas with good strength, balance, and complexity. Taste of cracker, bready grain, apple, pear, herbal, floral, grass, pepper, light clove, and earthy spiciness. Lightly tart earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of bread, light fruits, herbal, floral, grass, pepper, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Nice amount of flavors with good balance; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very excellent Helles lager! Nice amount of flavors with good balance; extremely smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering as expected."
"I would buy a six pack of this anytime."

"Poured into a pint glass. Pours clear golden with a tall white head. There's a moderate amount of tiny bubbles rising in the beer. The bear smells of grain with some floral hops. The beer is mildly sweet up front and then bready from the barley malt. It takes on a nice biscuit flavor. The floral hops provide some nice balance to this beer. The body is light with moderate carbonation. The finish is crisp, clean, and dry. The drinkability is very high. This is an excellent beer."

"A great lager, I could easily drink this all day. It is as if the beer is evaporating from the glass, each sip becoming a greedy pull, leaving you thirsty for more. A definite try if you've got Stoudt's in your area."
""
""
"Straw in color.  Fairly hearty for the style.  Nice dry finish."
""
"D: i would take a guess and say something was a little off with this bottle/an old bottle. purchased at a Wegman's in PA not far from the brewery makes this a little disappointing."

"Notes: Such a tasty lager great for anytime of year. Cheers."
"Overall, good beer. This would be a great beer on a warm summer night on the deck."

"This beer and Southampton Keller Pils will be competing for the spot of ""Go-to Summer Beer"" for me (if Berkshire Brewing Company's Czech Pilsner came in 12oz bottles, it would also be in the running). This beer is crisper, with a better mouthfeel all around, while Keller Pils delivers more bold flavors. I think the bottled on date will be the decider between the two."

"It’s bright gold, exceptionally clear, with a pearly white head that refuses to quit. The crystal-clarity makes lively carbonation a spectacle. The looping and endless stream of mini bubbles is downright mesmerizing. Smell is zesty with cut grass, and there’s honey in the aroma as well. Taste some mild honey up front followed by delicate bitterness from the hops. Mouthfeel is light-bodied, slick, crisp, fresh, and delicious. Outstanding and subtle. Lately I’ve been appreciating session beers more and more and actively sought this one out because I have been so impressed with this brewer. Give me more."

"Malty aroma has a strong yeasty overtone. It pours a clear solar yellow with a rather average white head. Crisp, malty flavor has a grassy overtone and a firm yeasty note. Smooth, crisp texture has just a little fizz, enough so that you know this is beer. Just OK, but pick up a bottle if you have a chance."
""

"Served from tap into a sampler shaker. Poured an opaque pale golden yellow with a one finger white head that subsided to a half finger slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, banana, and wheat. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, fruit, and wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. I really wish the flavor and aroma on this one would have been a little more complex. While I say this, the simplicity of this one is really what made it. All of the flavors and aromas on this one were really crisp and refreshing. A good easy drinking brew that you should take the chance to try yourself."
""
""
""
"Perhaps I don't understand this style and perhaps this taste and mouthfeel are normal for this style and hence the hight ratings by some however I have to say that this beer is not for me. Even without understanding the style I still would say that this brew is weak and watery tasting."

"Really nice helles. Crisp, refreshing, and mild. Nice every day brew."
"Serving type: bottle"

"This brew is an excellent example of a light style of beer, not to be confused with America's incessant deference to diet beer. Flavor, character, aroma and ceaseless drinkability is exemplified by this one! Top notch."

"This beer when poured into a pint glass, has a nice straw yellow body with a nice white creamy 1"" head that hangs around for a while. The smell is grains coming through in the smell. The taste is a little fruity with some grains coming through, The mouth feel is crisp and clean well carbonated with small bubbles. Overall this is a good drinkable lager."
""
"Overall, a good if just another bland and boring lager. Certainly miles better than the mass-produced BMC swills of the world, but those wanting more flavor and substance should look elsewhere. Victory's Prima Pils is a lot better than this."
"Appearance is gold and clear, nice. Smell is none eventfull, there is a slight fruity aroma. Mouthfeel is clean and sits well in the mouth. This brew feels good on the tongue. Taste smooth refreshing lager with no bit upfront or in the back. Nothing special, overall, quite uneventful but it is refreshing. Not the best we have had, not fridge worthy."
""
"Lighter medium body, decent carbonation, tingly and brisk on the palate. A refreshing lager with a pretty streamlined flavor - something I'd probably drink again."

"Cheers!"
"Overall: Do not judge a book by its cover, or a beer by its appearance. While this beer pours out looking horrible, and smelling average, the taste and overall refreshment factor makes it a very nice beer."
"O- Easy drinker, crisp, bit refreshing. Not as bad as I was expecting. Not my favorite style, but still not bad."
"Overall I liked this offering and kudos to being PA brewed. Light, toasty with a touch of hops and sweetness make a good brew."
"O: Easy drinking, could relax with this beer on a hot day for sure. Would be a good sessionable beer. Flavor is solid, despite being a lighter beer."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I have had this beer several times before and, as in the past, I found this one quite drinkable. One sip follows easily from the last and invites the next. I could have more than one of this and find it a nice beer for an evening including dinner and a good conversation with friends. My overall impression is that this is a first rate example of the style and once again Stoudt’s has displayed their mastery of German style beers."
"It's very drinkable and smooth, but also isn't all that remarkable. While the tasting notes surprised me for the style, they still do taste good."
"Morey's Bottom Line: If you're looking for something on the lighter side, Stoudts Gold might just be your beer. Perfect for summer days like this one (90 degrees)!"
"A good fall yard work beer I think."
"Helles lagers aren't my first thought for a refreshing beer but Stoudt's Gold is a great candidate to change my mind."
"Overall: I have been looking forward to sampling this for awhile and I am not the least bit disappointed. If not for price and availability, this would be my daily drinker!"
"Poured into a beer mug. It had a hazy yellow color with a nice size head. It smelled of honey, grain, malt. It tasted of slight wheat, honey, and a lemon citrus finish. It was a light beer, definitely refreshing. Overall all I have to say is yikes, BA members,your palate is really bad including the bros. there is nothing German about this beer, there is nothing ""Helles Lager"" stylish about this beer. Spicy hop Bitterness is no wheres to be found."
"This was a pretty good lager, good balanced flavor, but not really anything that made it stand out for me."
"O: A damn fine lager. Stoudt's is a brewery worth checking out."
"very solid brew. ONE OF THE BEST segue or summer beers your likely to come across,.. buy with confidence. best somewhat accessible helles east of the mississippi river? it may be."
"Very easy drinker, clean, simple and enjoyable."
"Very glad I got to try this. Perfect for the summer days, but I could definitely see myself grabbing one of these at any time of the year. A beer that could easily be a staple in my fridge (if it were available in my area)."
"A go to beer for me. Pours lager gold with a good head with a modest pour. The color is what a golden beer should be, a bar setter. Smells grainy but smell does not do this beer justice. Now the taste, by the way I like this very cold, exceptional as rated. I can't believe this is brewed in Penn tastes better than most Germans I've had. This thing is pure and delicious with sweet bread alittle pepper and some mild bavarian bitterness on the finish. Carbonated well and sessionable. I think it loses its sweetness as it warms but I usually don't allow that to happen. Simple and a great American tribute."
"Poured a beautiful golden color that was crystal clear and topped with an attractive white head. Mouth feel is good, very smooth. Aroma is not real prominent but nice. Taste is slightly sweet and of toasted malt. This is one easy-drinking beer and one I will definitely buy again and again. Drinkability is about as high as it gets. Excellent beer."
"I really liked this beer. Stoudt's being a new brewery to enter Louisiana recently, I was excited to try this. A very smooth beer with good carbonation. At times I felt like there was a slight butter taste to the beer. I could easily drink this beer all day. The rest of Stoudt's lineup will definitely be on my list when shopping around."
"Hands down one of my favorite lagers from the first bottle. I love this. Stoudt's nailed the style. In fact I don't know of a better American made version. Something I would highly recommend."
"The taste is great. A slight bready/ malt presence, with a mild hop taste. Crisp Clean, and highly drinkable. A really great example of what a lager can be. I"
"O: Easy drinking, crisp and refreshing summertime beer."
"O: This is a prime example of the style. If you need in-your-face hops and boldness all the way around, skip it. If you want a great craft lager, good choice."
"The palate is medium bodied, creamy and very delicious. More of those toasty malt and bright flavors, and a very smooth and slightly sweet finish. Supremely drinkable."
"O: This is a beer that I will drink over and over again"
"O: With all the impressive and unique beers that exist in the world of mircobrews today, the classic types are often ignored or sub par. Every brewery, it seems, has a pale ale or lager because it is part of the line up (it is tradition). My point? That Stoudt's Golden Lager shows how excellent the classic types can be. Sure, it is amazing to have a rare beer aged in oak for two years with chocolate or roasted Hawaiian coffee beans before being blended with other casks and then, finally, reaching the shelf in very limited quantities (yes, I used a bit of hyperbole). After all, I am one of those people trying to buy that interesting beer. However, it is nice to buy something that reminds you that beer does not have to be brewed in unique (and sometimes unnecessary) ways for it to be good. We are fortunate to live in a world of beer were we have both."
"O - This pretty much hits the nail on the head for the style. It's ""simple", but so well done as to not disappoint or leave me wanting. A finely crafted brew."
"Very German indeed. This brew is a clear yellow color Very fresh looking and not overly hoppy in anyway. The brew has the aromas of a pilsner which bums me out. The flavors of a tradional German pilsner are in there too. It's not a bad beer for those who like this style,"
"The CPJ"
"Drink - Not my favourite style of beer to drink but I still enjoyed it quite a bit. If you are a fan of the style, it's a must try."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a light, clear straw-yellow color with a good white head. Decent retention and the head eventually falls into a short cap. The nose is slightly fruity with a bit of grain. My guess after these two elements was that this was a kolsch. The taste brings a bit of bitterness and floral notes plus some grain and hints of fruit. Light boddy and good carbonation. This drinks really well."
"Beer is thin and wet and has an insanely smooth finish. I thoroughly enjoy the beer. The flavors fall away in the late palate but the lead off and midpalate are nicely sweet and mild, it's an adult soda pop."
"A good all purpose lager to have with football food like I did. Could easily drink a handful of these."
"D It sure went down easy. It's very smooth and drinkable, but practically flavourless."
"Overall this is a tasty brew - one that I could tangle with over an entire evening."
"D - An insanely drinkable top-notch lager that is loaded with character... Absolutely delightful and a lager that I would drink on a regular basis and is more than worthy of being in the beer fridge every now and again..."
"A delightful Munich Helles Lager. I can't believe I waited this long to try one. This won't be the last."
"Many 12oz bottles of this. Pours a clear light gold with a sparse white head. Cereal grains, light grassy hops in the nose. Flavor is dry and tight. Cereal like unsweetened Cheerios shines on this. Not as snappy as a pils but quite a balanced and refined offering. I'm a sucker for these light German style lagers when they're done right. This is good stuff and a great value."
"Good session beer."
"This is a good solid example of the style. While not my most favored style, I do prefer a good helles as apposed to other lagers."
"This reminded me a lot of all the great Helles beers I had in Munich and I guess that's exactly what Stoudt's was going for. Probably the best example of this style made in the US."
"D: It's super drinkable."
"Again a very clean and fresh palette. The German hops come through on the taste more so than in the nose. A light clean mouthfeel with noteable fizziness that goes down easy. A very enjoyable summer beer."
"Drinkability is excellent. This could be enjoyed over and over and is versatile with food or on its own. A great warm weather brew but could also be a year round staple."
"So many American brewers malign and mistreat German lagers - not Stoudts. They treat their lagers right; they brew them clean, wholesome, tasty and with an obvious (and rightful) sense of pride and integrity. Anybody who wishes to drink mainstream, commercial beer should be required to drink a bottle of this first to know what they are missing out on."
"Easy drinking, refreshing beer, but nothing spectacular."
"D: Drinkability is perfect. Stylistically speaking, this beer is phenomenal. I buy Gold Lager by the case in the summer."
"I never thought I'd find a beer classified as a lagger I'd really like, but this one comes as close as any I've tried and its actually quite drinkable. Taste is very very wheaty with a crisp finish, it pours clear gold with a white head. The beer smells strongly of honey. The effervesencts from the bubbles is just right, this beer is what a good summer beer should be, drinkable, light and having a nice appearance"
"Pours crystal clear pale golden with a bright white head. The head has superb staying power and leaves very nice lace. The aroma is sweet and clean with pale malt, honey and gentle grassy herbal hops. There is also a pleasant toasted/slightly buttery aroma. The flavor is very clean, smooth and well constructed. Much like the nose, it definitely has a bit of a toasty character. The hops are soft and herbal with a pleasant grassyness that accentuates the grain character of the malt. It is very well balanced and enjoyable. The mouthfeel is light with a definite smoothness to it and a slightly drying finish. Very drinkable and refreshing. This is a great American brewed Helles, and was also enjoyed by the non-beer geeks that I shared the growler with."
"Pale golden color topped by two fingers of white head that hung on for a long time. The head settles to a thick cap. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. The only thing limiting the appearance score is the very pale color. Even for a Helles it is pale. I was not so impressed with the aroma and flavor. Almost no hop presence. I want some Noble hops in my Helles. The malt gives a nice semi-dry bready element. Finishes dry, crisp, and clean. Nice body with lively carbonation. Good lager elements. Easy to drink but not really interesting after the first pint."
"D- I enjoyed it, very easy drinking beer with enough flavor to keep you going. Im enjoying basic styles more and more these days."
"Since my initial review of this beer, I have become much more familiar with lagers and this review more accurately reflects my feeling about this beer. A sixer of it can usually be found in my refrigerator."
"I liked this beer, something i could drink a lot of. Very similar to their pils in many ways, with the exception of the bready malt. A nice take on a German classic."
"Have had this plenty of times previously. Just got around to reviewing it. Pours a crystal clear gold color. Nice thin white head with good carbonation. No DMS or other off flavors present. Has a faint floral hop aroma. For whatever reason, I get a faint walnut, or nut, smell and taste. Extremely clean tasting beer. Dry tasting with just enough bitterness to tinge the tip of your tongue at the end of each taste. A very nice, light easy drinking beer."
"Overall-great Helles, Stoudt's nails it again. After drinking so many pale imitations it's great to see a faithful version by a microbrewery. Great work."
"D: Good-tasting brew, but I'll forget about this one pretty quick."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable and has a very nice balance and very strong hop finish, its a very nice combination of still having the light refreshing nature of a lager but with a sharp hop backbone, certainly refreshing, a nice example of a german style lager albeit with more hops then most i have tried,"
"Pours a clear, bright golden color, as the name implies. Nice head with mild retention and very little lacing. Has a slight musty , wet grass smell that is much better than it sounds. Tastes grainy, grassy, and floral with a touch of honey. Nice hop flavour in this one. Finishes with moderate bitterness with a slight metallic note. Medium body, with good cling. Good drinkability as with most German lagers. One of Stoudt's better brews IMO. Worth a try for sure."
"D - Considering the style and that it's well done, it's very drinkable. This is the best Helles lager I've had from a bottle. Weihenstephaner's on draught might beat it out, but from a bottle, this wins."
"Pours a cheerful golden clear with a dense but voluminous head. The aroma is negligible, but the flavor is grainy, pale malt with the subtle sting of hops. Perhaps a little bit bready and a little light caramel. The overall effect is crisp with a little kiss of honey Mouthfeel is light refreshing and carbonated."
"Overall while being fairly solid and well rounded it really does not stand out in the pack. Needed a little bit more follow through and a richer, deeper profile to really peak my interest."
"Overall: A worthy micro"
"D - Very, very drinkable Helles style. It is comparable to many of the popular German brews. Hard to go wrong with German styles from Pennsylvania!"
"Overall: One of the best examples of a German Helles Lager in the US period"
"Overall this was a solid beer that did everything right. A good selection to keep in the refrigerator in the summer."
"D - A drinkable helles which lacks some malt sweetness and is toaster than expected w/ a light flavor/body that is pretty easy to quaff. The beer is sessionable, but not my first choice in helles'"
"Overall: Stoudt's does lagering right, and Lew Bryson is right to celebrate this offering, with its spring/fall versatility and its by-the-six pack drainability..."
"On tap at Taco Mac Metropolis. The beer is crystal clear, light golden colored, about 1.5 fingers of foam, basically looks like a helles lager. Or a macro for that matter. It has the aroma of toasted grains and very light hops, and the flavors match the smell. Nice grainy/toasty aftertaste, muted in most ways but that's all right with this style. This is more or less a gateway beer, or the definition of session beer, not really as good as the helles lagers of Munich but not a bad transition point either."
"It is a very fizzy yellow beer, but it is also easy to drink once you let it get over the shock of being out of the fridge. Not bad at all!"
"I'm mystified by the hype ,,will try Victory's version next."
"Don't drink and review."
"From a brown 12 oz. bottle. Pours a bright golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smeels of malts and a tad sweet. Crisp and refreshing with a good balance of malt and hops. feels medium bodied in the mouth and goes down very smooth. Overall a fine beer."
"d- nice and drinkable, refreshing, could be easily sessioned, another solid offering from stoudts."
"Excellent lager, very crisp and refreshing on a hot summer night. I really am not a huge lager-head but this beer really exceeded all my expectations."
"very good, i was bummed out by the lack of head compared to what others wrote but the flavor is there. an excellant beer that packs in taste without overshadowing anything in any way. PA rules."
"D - I must admit I am impressed by this lager. This is not typically one of my favorite styles, but this beer makes me remember why I love beer."
"Light body with really good carbonation. Smooth, refreshing, clean, crisp and really easy to drink. A quality beer."
"Vibrantly clear light yellowish orange with a sturdy head for a lager. Faint aromas of husky grain and extra pale malt. Mellow flavor, mostly malt and notes of honey with the slightest dry hint of hops. Crisp and refreshing as it should be. Overall a pretty good stab at the lager style but lacking that bit of character that the best examples from Germany have. Still a very enjoyable and pleasantly drinkable brew."
"D: I'm a big fan of helles lagers, and this just might be the best American example of the style. I could definitely pound back a whole bunch of these in a session."
"Dr. This one goes down so easy and tastes so good getting there!"
"Drinkable for sure, but lacks a bit in the flavor dept. Nothing off or out of place though, just a forgettable lager."
"The beer poured into my pint glass showed a clear, straw color. The head was white and quick-dissipating. The aroma was malt-forward and had a sweet barley character. There was little evidence of hops in the aroma and the yeast was clean and inviting. The initial flavor impression was crisp. The malt flavor was light and the hop bitterness and flavor were low, but balanced. The flavor finishes sweet with a light, well carbonated mouthfeel. This light-bodied beer leaves an all around great impression making it an easy drinking lager."
"Drink is good. I could definetly have a few more of these."
"Amply carbonated, nicely balanced between prickliness and creaminess to the feel. Light to medium in body, this is a crisp, tasty and eminently quaffable brew."
"D= go for it. Other than the potential for over-gassing and bloating from the foamy head, there's nothing to stop you- seesion or with meals."
"D - A highly quaffable brew. If I had a lawn, this would be my lawnmower beer. I can't say it's something I'd drink all the time; it's pretty simple. But for the style, this is really good."
"This beer would be especially good on a hot summer day, or any time you want a plain but tasty beer."
"Fantastic and Pale yellow with a welcome frothy white head. Great lacing down the sides of the glass. Aromas of spicy hop and hints of raw sweetness from the malt in the nose. Crisp and snappy on the palate, thick malty and grainy flavour. Light-to-medium in body. Toasty malt goodness with some biscuit tones, good balance with the hops. Stellar use of the Munich malt. Incredible yet simple in flavor and aroma. Perhaps my favorite domestic Helles."
"Crystal clear golden yellow with a fluffy pure-white head. Fresh grainy sweet aroma, honey, and lightly balancing hops. Sweet crispy dry grain, leafy noble hop spiciness...very simple, but well done. Medium-light, crisp, clean, and effervescent. An easy-drinking, crisp lager and a good one to start with. I could drink a few..."
"7/4/7/4/12 (3.4/5)"
"Very drinkable for the style. Goes down smooth, it's flavorful and best of all, you could drink a couple and enjoy it without worrying about getting drunk. Very nice."
"What a great crispy Lager! I think I found a new seesion Lager. I don't see why not because it was a light beer that had plenty of flavor to it. You could actually drink a couple of these in a sitting. Another must try from Stoudt's."
"Pale yellow colored lager that has a slow fading head that stays at about a quarter of an incg.Aroma is malty.Taste is also malty with a splash of citrus.Overall very fresh and drinkable.I believe this is something that has to be tried at least once,or in my case a couple more times.A good lager!!"
"D: Very drinkable beer that is easily a session beer."
"D - I could have this at any time, so light and tastes great!"
"D: This beer didn't do much for me. It might be the style, but it seemed a little too simple for its own good."
"T: Medium body, active carbonation, very crisp, smooth. Strong malt body, sweet and biscuity, slight citrus flavor and hop presence in the finish. Grainy malt taste lingers in the finish. Big body and flavor for a lager, this is excellent."
"Enjoyed on-tap as a guest tap at The Mad Brewer. Good carbonation, hops. Light yellow colour with lace. Decent enough lager for the summer. Neutral aroma, average mouthfeel. A bit drying in the finish, it's still a nice one for Summer. Its the style, but not the best representation of the style."
"Drinkability? The ultimate. If these weren't $9/sixpack near me I'd drink them all spring summer and fall! I really have to make a trip out to PA to visit these guys."
"There is a spicy and slightly bitter aftertaste that is delicious. I could drink quite a few of these on a hot day and be a happy man."
" I tried to be fair in my review but overall i was not really impressed with this one."
"D: I'm still getting used to drinking anything I can see through but respect the style of beer and need to try this on tap before I can say for sure if I truly enjoyed it. Overall, I didn't get much out of this beer."
"Very nice effort."
"tastes just as it smells. very light finishing beer good for a session or too. I'm not too big on lagers in general, but this one is great for its style."
"This one is a very nice golden yellow with loads of tiny bubbles zipping to the serface. Huge fluffy white foamy head that lasts and lasts. Left some impressive lacing. Smells of earthy to sweet malts and floral/grassy hops with some honeyish smell as well. I get some nice sweet malt flavor with well done spicey hop attack the and a lasting dry malt aftertaste. Mouth feel is excellent and its a pretty upfront drinkable brew that is a very good example of the style IMO."
"Pours a nice transparent gold color, with a creamy white head which lasts for the duration. Nice bready aromas, some sweetness too. Sweet malt up front, a kiss of lemon, and an incredibly crisp and clean hop bite. Excellent mouthfeel, lively on the tongue, with a very brief lingering bitterness. An everyday-drinker if I've ever had one. Would compliment an endless array of meals. Really tasty!"
"Good balance of sweet malt and hops in the flavor. Finish is crisp and clean. Very easy to drink lager and an excellent example of the Helles - style lager."
"A thirst-quenching brew that is what an everyday beer should be. Near-perfect in every facet."
"Stoudt's is very much on my radar when it comes to traditional German brews. I'm going to have to seek out some of their other offerings."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a nice lighter beer to drink for a long time, but I would normally look for something more flavorful."
"Man, there just aren't enough good Helles lagers available. This one keeps a nice, short head for the duration with a bit of lacing. The aroma is a bit mild, with lager character and sweet bread. The flavor follows that with more bready and biscuity malts, tasting a touch creamy, and finishing with a pepper and spice hops bite. Not too much bitterness or sweetness, just a well-balanced flavorful beer."
"This style is certainly not in my wheelhouse but was a very pleasant change of pace from my usual IPA dominated rotation."
"Recommended..."
"""A nice beer to guzzle after mowing the lawn in August," this Munic-style Helles poured well and surprised our tasters with its crisp drinkability. No one there was a light beer fan, but this brew still did surprisingly well, as most people agreed that, for a light lager, this is about as good as one can get."
"Light bodied and very drinkable. I could be a big fan by the case."
"Not super familiar with this style, but this one is just fair."
"Poured into a pint glass. The beer was a crystal clear gold color with a short shite fluffy head that quickly disappeared. Smells of apple or grape and bread. Taste of earthy malt with some hops at the end. Mouthfeel is dry and crisp. Very easy to drink."
"This beer ranks up there with Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, Deschutes Mirror Pond, Victory Prima Pils, Bridgeport IPA, and Anchor Steam in the highly flavorful/balanced/sessionable/available beer category. By far the best Stoudt's beer I have tried. This is a beer that I would highly recommend picking up if you can get it."
"I have to give them a thumbs up if nothing else for pursuing many different styles, as opposed to some breweries that, while producing a solid beer, everything seems to taste quite the same (sorry Rogue brewery)."
"Seems like there is peach on the nose? Nuts on the end. It's smoky on the end for sure, like roasted leaves. A real earthy brew that you can tell is definitely a craft brew. You can tell care has been made with this one. Definitely worth trying. Very well crafted."
"Definitely a session beer."
"Excellent offering from Stoudt's. After having this and their pils, I'm really impressed with this brewer."
"Thanks to Myles at The Cork for recommending this gem. I think I'll pick up a case tomorrow."
"D: A very enjoyable beer served cold. It doesn't make you sit up and take notice but it quenches your thirst in a very satisfying way. I've served it at picnics to non-craft drinkers who seemed to enjoy it quitet a bit."
"Beer poured bright and clear. Remarkably clear, actually. Yellow in color. Almost no head. Faint malt on the nose, not much hop. Taste is very yeasty. With mild malt and hops on the back palate. I might have gotten a bad bottle. Very yeasty. Mouthfeel is light with moderate carbonation. Very tiny bubbles. Overall, I am disappointed. But it think I might have gotten a bad bottle. I will update this review upon further tastings."
"Pours extremely clear and very bright, with little head. The aroma is scratchy with earthy German style hops laid over a slightly sweet light malt note. On the palate, hop bitterness up front turns into a big, bready mid-palate, with the beer finishing up on an acidic hop note (nothing too forward, though). Mouthfeel is smooth overall, with a bit of hop roughness and well balanced carbonation. Overall, this is quite a nice helles... not as good as some of the best American ones (not to mention Germans), but good."
"Drinkability: Not bad for a soft, sweet lager."
"I can recall stopping at the brewery in 1997 and purchasing a case of six 26 ounce bottles of this brew unpasterized. What a joy to drink. I would very much like other brewers to attempt to brew this style of beer. It is an excellent everyday beer with subtle complexities."
"Drinkability is very good. A very nice easy drinking and tasty lager."
"Pours a clean golden color with a white head that does not last. Aromas of a European hp and a sweet malt. Tastes about the same with with a dry end. Not much of an aftertaste, but a good palate clensor. Easy to drink, good for a game. Light and refreshing."
"Brewing a session lager like this consistently and in large enough quantities to distribute takes serious brewing kung-fu. We talk so much on this site about beers that convert macro drinkers into craft drinkers, well Stoudt's helles is somewhat of the opposite--a beer to convert drinkers of quintuple IPAs, 157% ABV barleywines, beers brewed with plutonium, and so on to the lovely world of sessionable gold lagers."
"An easy and satisfying beer to enjoy."
"Very tasty. I enjoyed while repainting the kid's swing set. A nice outdoors in the summer, session beer."
"Very drinkable. Light and smooth in mouthfeel, the high carbonation dances. A great summer beer."
"D- A good drinkable summertime beer. Not very hoppy, but balanced."
"Drinkability: Great drinkability...smooth."
"This is a nice, easy drinking ""sessionable"" lager. Tasty, clean, crisp and refreshing."
"Overall, the taste was strong and interesting, but it all seems offset and jarring. Sourness bitterness and sweetness, like the 3 Stooges, try too hard to cram into the door frame that is the palate. Woo woo woo woop!"
"I was impressed with this brew. Great session brew. Solid choice for any occasion. Go Phillies!"
"Poured a pretty golden with a thick sudsy head that dropped to a half-inch and stayed. Aroma was not assertive: sweet malt and just a hint of hops. Taste was mild and easygoing but nicely balanced with just a hint of a bitter hop finish. A light refreshing brew, good for a session on a hot summer day. Also good to serve to friends who only know American macro -- the look and taste won't threaten them."
"One of the cleanest, most drinkable craft-brewed lagers I've tried. Great start into ""real beer"" for your ""macro"" drinking friends--if you can get them to try it. Beautiful golden color, nice foamy head that lasts for the first couple of sips and then falls to lace the glass all the way down. Substantial mouthfeel, with a soft malt (and just a touch of hops) in the nose. Taste is at once clean and fresh (it's great to live so close to the brewery) malt, very mild spice, touch of sweet--but not too sweet. A bit of buttery smoothness and fruity complexity, but only a bit. Very simple, well crafted, good tasting beer that rivals the best Munich imports for quality (and exceeds them in freshness)."
"Pours a decent head and leaves nice lacing. A pretty good beer here, a golden color with some spicey, creamy, and oaty malts followed with a little hop bitterness. Leaves very little aftertaste, is extremely clean, crisp, and smooth. Gives some bready notes, as well. Picked this out in dead winter, but will make this an all the time summer brew."
"The drinkability is very good, I love the style and done well makes a great drinking brew. Prosit, MK"
"Very crisp and bitter up front. Hops show themselves. Malty, grainy body. Good balance. Undeniably drinkable."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable lager that would serve well as a session beer."
"D: This is an excellent beer, one that I have been a fan of since I first visited the brewery in 1999."
"Pours a pale golden color with a nice big, foamy white head and a moderate amount of carbonation. Smell is hoppy bitter but with a touch of malt sweetness, as well. Taste is smooth and crisp, nicely balanced with a bit of hoppy biterness, grain and malt flavors. Easy drinking lager and very satisfying."
"Had this really cold, drank it quickly, looked for another. This would be a fantastic summer lawnmower beer, or any other time. This makes me actually appreciate yellow beers when they are done to standard. Good stuff! Another PA beverage to look for."
"Final Thought: This is a very well done Helles that comes as close as they brew in Bavaria... and this means a lot because I lived there for six months."
"Cheers!"
"This would be a fantastic beer to always have a few of in the fridge, great drinkin for when you just want a ""beer"""
"D: Everything about this beer makes me want to drink another one. I want to go get a case of it now...go out and get some of this if you like lagers."
"Drinkability: Really great flavor and complexity keeps one coming back. I could drink these all night and be in bliss. Liquid contentment. I'm very impressed."
"Drinkability: as good as you can get. A simple and refreshing brew that can be quaffed all day."
"Still, this is what it's supposed to be- a clean tasting, easy drinkin' beer."
"Taste is sweet, but perfectly so, not overdone, and nothing more is needed. It's well balanced, with a silky smooth finish. Very creamy and light in body. Crisp and clean. A very good lager with light carbonation. This is delicious and goes down so easy. Might make this my new session beer."
"Overall: A very good lager, drinkable all day."
"Overall- a Lager that gets my thumbs up. I don't like the metallic twang in the back end of this beer but otherwise its a respectable Lager!"
"poured a pale golden color with long-lasting white puffy head. Smell is mainly of sweetich hops. Taste is loaded with malt, delivering a nice crispiness combined with a citrus background. Finish is smooth, refreshing, and crisp. Slight sweetness with is very enjoyable. I am not a big fan of lagers but this a very good one."
"A well made Lager. Pours out to a bright golden yellow color with a well formed and bubbly 1/2 inch head, with some notes of lace in the glass. Medium level of carbonation. Aromas of sweet aromatic malts was nice, but very weak. Taste was solid; flavors of soda crackers, malt and grains was very satisfying. Some sourness toward the finish. Mouthfeel was medium to medium light bodied with some zesty-ness toward the finish. Drinkability is good. I've become kind of disillusioned with micro lagers, as some have become very redundant and boring, but this one is a nice change up i'd like to have on hand. Recommended."
"Notes: just average brew"
"Drinkability is not bad. A good change of pace from the norm lager."
"I like their Pils better; it's drier and hoppier, but this one is right on style, as far as I can tell. Drinking beers like this fresh also makes a big difference. For a Munich Helles, this is pretty damn good."
"I'm not usually impressed with Stoudt's brews, but this is an exception. Well done!"
"($1.99 / 12 oz.)"
"Drinkability- After the first, I wanted another. Would complement countless dishes."
"The flavour is a mash of grass, sweetness,some floral notes and general maltiness. Hop flavouring interacts wit hthe malt base quite nicely. Mouthfeel is full and thick. Spot on for this brew. This one is basic but has some flavour packed in and is worth a try. It'd work well to bridge the gap for macro drinkers as well."
"Despite being one of my least favorite styles, this is drinkable and even pleasant. Maybe not a lager I would choose over a bock, etc., but pleasant tasting for the style."
"12 oz. bottle. There is a freshness code, but I don't remember how to figure it out. No big deal. Clear golden liquid, white thick fluffy head. Tiny bubbles coming from the bottom of the glass. Head retention if fair, but a good amount of lace on the glass. Pale bready malt smell, also smells slightly grassy. Light malt flavor, with earthy flavored hops. Dry finish, with some bitterness. Very crisp and clean. Light body, high carbonation. Good balance in this one. Good hop finish. Solid beer."
"The Gold Lager poured pure golden in color with a big, frizzy, pure white, and remarkably consistent head. The odor is maize-like, can't say I'm thrilled about that. The mouthfeel is crisp and well balanced, carefully taken care of in that regard. Still it is corn-like with a toasted malt offering. It goes on to a tad more bitterness in the finish. Eh, its ok, wouldn't necessarily seek it out again."
"Medium bodied, smooth with a good zesty hop bite."
"Pours out a pale gold color with a nice head that took a while to settle down. Smell consisted of earthy tones and some floral/herbal profile, hops and malts mix in with each other, with a touch of honey. Taste was pretty good. It has a nice crispiness to it. A nice dose of malts hit the palate with some herbal hops underlying the malts and finishes a tad on the sweet side. It has a medium body to it, but I could drink these all night, just went down so easy and fast."
"Low carbonation makes for high drinkability. In this regard it almost seemed weak, yet seemed to hold up. Excellent flavor. Good beer to have just about anytime."
"Pours with a white two-fingered head that fades to clumps and leaves a lot lace. Light, clear amber color. Light carbonation and light bodied. Lightly hopped mixed with some malt. Not a lot bitterness, seems watery, some sweetness. Brewed by Frederick Brewing for Stoudt. $1.45 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, Ma."
"Stoudt's Gold Lager is a pleasant surprise and is more than solid in all respects. I haven't had too many good non-German Munich Helles Lagers, but this one is a winner."
"My friend brought over a six pack of this and raved about it. Cool label. Pours out golden yellow in color with a small white head. The smell is a subtle malt with sweetness coming through. Medium to low carbonation, but it feels just about right. Not a ton of flavor but very refreshing and easy to drink. I pick up some fruityness in the beginning and then a quick hop sharpness hits you. As fast as it comes, it leaves. Overall a solid lager that I will try again."
"Summary: When you buy a sampler case from a brewery, there is always that one beer that you feel like they are trying to get rid of by putting it in with other (better) beers. This is that lesser beer."
"Taste: a little spice on the front, some of that raw honeysuckle following to the finish."
"Slightly hazy deep golden color. Thin ivory white head. Soon there is just the slightest of a collar left. Nice earthy and herbal and sweet aroma. A little hay and hops mixed in too. The carbonation is nice and prickly. Body is a little better than medium. Taste is malty and a little sweet (like molasses) and accented nicely by German hoppiness. This is pretty good."
"Drinkability: I'm going to get a few more of these, not just cause its a PA brew, but because this is one tasty beer. Very nicely done. I'm going to be sad when this glass is empty."
"This light lager realizes its basic composition of malt and hops more obviously than some. It's very clean, refreshing, and as drinkable as any beer, without forgetting to be flavorful."
"Nice job Stoudt's"
"This brew pours a bright golden color with an orange tinge to it. Very thin white head and little lacing. The aroma is mostly hops with a touch of fruit and wheat. Crisp body with malt flavor at the forefront. The rest of the flavor was reminiscent of your standard bland Lager, as was the finish which was mildly hoppy. This is a drinkable beer but really not that special."
"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a lacey white head. The aroma is sweet and fruity. It has banana smells with light crystal malts. The taste is good. It has a slightly malty flavor with a real golden taste. It's clean and fruity. The mouthfeel is good. It's a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent lager, but not great. I think I'll have another."
"This lager poured a clear, golden color with white foam that settled but left some lace on the glass. The smell was subdued malt. The taste was dominated by floral hops, but with malt, bread and yeast present. The hop bitterness came through in finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium body and modest carbonation. The floral hops flavors lingered nicely as an aftertaste. This was a good, German style Helles lager."
"Well, after one sip, my initital thought was: this beer is like eating a bowl of cereal. Totally grainy taste. Medium yellow in color, with a slight head. Smell was fresh, but very reminiscent of a grain mill (I used to live on a farm, it was reminded me of the smell of grain). Taste is also reminiscent of refined grain, with some hop bitterness in the finish. Would not have again. pat"
"F"
"Poured a nice golden color with a light rocky head that left a little lacing,the aroma was very mild with some nice malty tones being dominat.Taste was nice and softly malty with a pretty good little hopsmack to finish.Real easy to drink a good summer brew."
"Exellent brew....wish I had more!"
"This is very nice a great tasting brew from Stoudts. It pour a clear golden color, topped of by a thick froth which fades away slowly, leaving a sticky web-like lave on the glass. The aroma is slightly sweet from the malt with mild hop undertones. The taste is also sweet and slightly bitter, finishing off with a mild pepper spiciness. This is a very well balanced brew, not too bitter, not too sweet. I will definitely seek this one out again."
"A very clear golden lager with a small white head and minimal lacing. Very nice full nose of malt. The taste is very even and clean; full of malt and grain, with enough bitttering hops to balance everything out. The feel is smooth and creamy with a strong crispness in the finish. This went down very well and it would have been easy to order up more. A very nice lager indeed."
"A real nice Helles...pours a somewhat cloudy gold with a bit of a reddish hue...nice maltiness emerges on the nose and invites you in....taste starts with the malt but then a real nice snappy hop presence closes the deal....this is sweet, and malty, but finishes crisp, and clean...I like Dortmunder Gold better but this is a nice Helles in the next tier..."
"A nice crisp drinking lager that has a great german feel to it. Well balanced with good malt backround and a very nice hop balance. Excellent session beer. This one could really be a great summer work brew, but it is a bit hard to come by in my area. Nothing amazing here, but a good one none the less."
"This beer pours a crystal clear burst of sunshine gold with a fluffy white head leaving a trickled lace. Aroma is full of delicate German hops are paired with a crisp sweet two pale malted barely. Taste is a crisp smooth sweet rolling malt profile that is mellowed by a nice bitterness. Very nicely done crisp lager can be compared to other great German lagers. Awesome summer beer one could easily go through a case of this brew. Mouthfeel contains a tingling sensation that runs through to the back of the throat with a lighter body this beer is one solid session brew. Drinkability can be explained as the most simplistic yet most amazing chalk full of goodness this beer is one that just keeps coming back to you."
"This beer poured a yellow gold color that had a slight cloud to it, you could still see the carbonation bubbles if you held it to the light. The head that it produced was a creamy/beige colored that was good in size foamy and creamy in nature, and it seemed to last for quite some time. It left a sheet with rings at the end lace behind a good portion of the way down the glass and then broke off into a patchy lace. The aromas that came from the glass were sweet and spicy like a peppercorn. I nosed fresh hops, sweet malts, citrus fruit, peppercorns, fresh grass and some caramel. The tastes were much like the aromas. Flavors of fresh floral hops, sweet malt, a light pepper, citrus lemons, kind of a watery presence, fresh grass, caramel and a tad alcohol. The aftertaste was a mix of hops and a fresh clean water feeling that balanced the hop right out. Medium bodied. Stoudts did a good job in balancing the hop bite with the sweet malt IMO, the two flavors complimented each other and did not overpower one another. It is a refreshing beer that is clean and crisp. Not a super beer but very good to drink."
"Sharp malty nose. Gold colored with lots of tiny bubbles. Nice fluffy white head. Smooth solid mouth especially for a lager. Quite an even handed malty earthy taste. Slight marshmello sweetness to the finish. A very good lager. The beer is solid and well crafted. A great lager for the fall months.. malty, smooth, and good lookin'... It won't knock your socks off.. but it will give ya a smile."
"This was a beer."
"12oz contract brewed at Frederick. I've had a few Stoudts beers but I realize now they have all been from 12 oz bottles and I've never tasted anything in the bigger bottles actually made at Stoudts. Nevertheless, I love their beers and think they are worthy of more attention. This beer is no exception, a crisp, malty, clean quenching lager that is a perfect American representation of a German style beer. Lovely head that wisps into clouds, appealing musty aroma, full rich maltiness right off the bat, then tempered by flavorsome (not too bitter) hops. This beer will do for any occasion and you might be able to get that Bud-light-swilling friend of yours to drink a few of these under the right circumstances. A flawless beer, ridiculously drinkable. I think I shall have another."
"As this bottle was brewed at the Lion Brewery in Wilkes Barre, PA.... this is obviously an older sample as their contract operations have been moved to the Frederick Brewery in Maryland. It pours a clear, deep golden body with a frothy white head that leaves some nice lace throughout the glass. The nose displays some lightly peppery/spicy hops over a gently sweet malt. The body is medium with a fine, median carbonation that leaves it crisp on the tongue before warming to become a touch creamy and smooth. The flavor delivers a rounded malt that obviously includes a good percentage of Munich malt. It's just lightly toasty and a tad sweet, but very well-balanced by lightly floral and gently herbal hop flavors and firm bitterness. It finishes dry but with a lingering maltiness. Quite nice, and highly drinkable. It's refreshing, but also offers enough character to make you want another. A good example of the Munich helles style at a very nice price. Well done, and certainly worth trying!"
"A lager that is more towards a Yuengling, except for color and taste. Where it is a lighter gold color and the taste is a bit more hoppy. It's an above average lager that is good after long day. The alcohol is not present and it is a beer that can go well with just most blander dishes. It is not one of the best lagers out there but it's better than any Macro made. A beer rookies leap to the big leagues, in a small way."
"I can smell a fruitiness - possibly peaches on the nose. Some lingering sweetness. A very unique and flavourful lager beer."
"Absolutely awesome sweet smell. Light gold color with rapidly disapating head. Appearance isnt the best but taste is excellent. Light and smooth with a light grace of hops with a shadowy background of light malts. Easy to drink in mass quanities. Well balanced mouthfeel not bitter or sweet and has a very silky quality on the palate."
"Rich golden color topped by a tight white head that fades to a layer of thin foam. A very light and loose lacing is left on the glass. Aroma is light, with a bready malt character accented by a touch of peppery hops. The taste is also very light and crisp, with just a touch of malt evident. The hop bitterness is a bit more prevalent than I expected. The beer has decent bitterness on the finish, but a slight metallic note detracts from the flavor. Mouthfeel is crisp and fresh, with decent carbonation. The drinkability is good, and would be better with a bit cleaner finish. A decent brew, but not the best Stoudt's has to offer."
"Pours pale golden color, huge white frothy head that clings to my glass. Spicy hop aroma, nice balanced bready flavor, crisp and clean, finishes dry. Light body, a little harsh mouthfeel, a great beer and very drinkable, I like this one."
"Well to honest, when they told me it was a lager, I was a bit hesitant. But I was presently surprised. It was a light gold color and formed a bubbly white head. Some carbonation was present. An aroma of malt and grain was present. A flavor of matl and grain with a bit of a tartness to it possibly brought on by the carbonation. A nice finish to it. All and all, a very nice beer for this style."
"This is definitely one you can give to people who have never had the nerve to try an ale. Golden yellow and a malty nose, smooth and very tasty."
"765 ml bottle purchased at the brewery. Bright gold body stopped by a fluffy white head, with enough carbonation it sounded like Rice Crispies when I poured. Nice lacing. Very classic looking. Fresh hay in nose, with a whiff of malt sweetness.  Strong malt body wonderfully balanced by hop zing. Excellent beer to serve to a mixed group of craft fans and Bud drinkers."
"Smells hoppy with a hint of spice and sweetness.  Rich malt flavor with a good hop bite.  Goes down exceptionaly smooth with a hint of spice. Good session beer  An outstanding lager."
"Clear gold color, creamy head with great looking lace. Very smooth, luxurious mouthfeel, but equally refreshing. Precisely balanced malt and hop character. Seems to me this brew blends well the traits of the various European lager/pils styles. Definitely a beer that could easily become a regular in my fridge."
"Notes: This one is a bit in the raw and lovely at that. There are lagers then there are great ones and this is one of the great ones. Seek this one out, I’d have to have it say it is a must try if you like Munich style lagers."
"Pours a nice clear golden color with a nice fluffy head with deep pockets. Aromas of saaz hops gives off a peppery smell and taste. There is a very good balance between the Munich-style malt and the saaz hops. Overall another good brew from Stoudt's and a very good Munich-style Helles lager."
