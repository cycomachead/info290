Some subtle noble hops, a dominant pale malt and a weird slimy film that lingered on my mouth and palate for a while. Definitely not attractive at all, did something go wrong?

Great appearance for this one, a light pale yellow with thin white head lots of lacing and an impressive carbonation. The steady upflow of bubbles kept me entertained for a long time. The aroma is faint and subtle slightly malty and a bit hoppy it had the common fragrance only toned down. Average mouthfeel. The taste is delivered nicely.

Mildly sweet aroma of black tea and purple grapes. Neutral malt flavor and undertones of grapes in the flavor. The flavors just vanish in the finish. The body is on the light side of moderately full, and there is a bit of fine carbonation to add to the mouthfeel. It's a bit fruity for a lager, but that's my only complaint.

3.58,-0.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"The beer pours a golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light, dry pale malt scent with a lager yeast finish. It has a bit of malt sweetness in there as well. The taste is decent also. It has a light pale malt feel to it, with a slightly sweet, yet dry lager yeast finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine Bavarian lager. It's not my favorite style, but this one stands out.","WesWes","Jul 01, 2004"
3.13,-13.3,4,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Say that name 5 times fast. Yikes. I do like the bottle presentation though, don't see much of these around now-a-days, so let's hope that the beer is as good as the bottle looks. Poured out a light gold/honey color with some carbonation visible, but that not that much. I was hoping for a little bit more actually. Smell consisted of malts, honey (which was very noticable), and some hops that blend in with some floral aromas. Taste was a little one sided I thought. Sweet malts long aride the palate for a while which gives into some hops undertones, but then the honey part takes over towards the middle and lasts into the aftertaste. I didn't like this because the malts are sweet already, the honey just makes it sweeter. It also felt a little watery in the aftertaste. I know this is a Helles, but the honey was a little bit too much. If they had some more hop bite to blend in, then that would make this brew great. But do try this beer at least once. Just needs some balancing.","necoadam","Jun 24, 2004"

2.87,-20.5,3,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,"This brew is a dark golden color with mild effervescence and a thin white head. Very little lacing. The aroma is fruity and lightly hoppy. Light-bodied and on the sweet side for the most part, with malt, fruit and hay flavors. The finish is rather weak but has some flavor to it. Pretty low on the Helles food chain but not terrible.","Dogbrick","Jun 01, 2004"
3.42,-5.3,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a clear pale gold under a one finger off-white head that settles quickly and leaves just a hint of lace. The nose is nice - full of fresh barley. The mouth is medium carbonated and medium bodied. There's a nice smooth barley malt taste, must like a Helles should have. There is very little hops here, though; just smooth malt. I detected no finish, per se, and only the mildest hint of bitterness in the aftertaste. This is not a great beer, but it is certainly perfectly good for drinking.","Globetrotter","Feb 14, 2004"
3.25,-10,3,3,3,3.5,4,"Tralucent dark straw. Thin, soapy porcelain head manages loose, tattered lace. Soft, grainy malt with hints of husk in aroma. Mellow, doughy underbaked bread. Sharp, grassy hop. Clean and tame aromawise. Bready pilsner malt sweetness upfront is quickly overrun by assertive, but rounded hop bitterness. Little noteable malt character, save a parching, brittle cracker tone. Mild grassy hop flavor with a lemony citric twang. Trace sulfur lends a mild savory, vegetal note. Very well attenuated and brisk in mouthfeel, but only a notch above thin. Quite thirst quenching. Finishes bone dry with quickly fading notes of fresh, sweet grass. A refreshing brew more like a uninspired German Pils than a Helles in overall character. Simple overall and quite lanky in malt backbone. Innocuous and very drinkable, just not terribly exciting.","marc77","Dec 28, 2003"

3.65,1.1,3,3,4,3.5,4,"The smell is a bit yeasty with hints of citrus and maybe something tarte? The taste is actually more than one dimensional. Soft and delicate in the beginning with a nice touch of bitterness in the end. Very clean and crisp. I pick up something a metallic. Not overpowering in anyway. I do believe this is my first stab at this style? Maybe not, I don't really know.","CharlesRiver","Dec 04, 2003"

4.1,13.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"It pours a dull brassy golden color with a pure white head that fades to a thin-rimmed coating. The mild aroma is of a distant bread shop and light hops. A slight caramel sweetness and very herbal flavor makes for a light bodied but flavorful malt. The hops provide a mild lemon and lime bitterness, and a slightly metallic bite. This is a highly drinkable Bavarian Lager - a perfect companion to beans and franks with German potato salad.","BeerResearcher","Oct 16, 2003"

3.36,-6.9,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Very pale yellow in color, not much of an aroma. Since I'd been in Germany for over a week, I've got to say that this is not the best lager I've had in the last two weeks. It's just not as crisp and clean tasting as some of the others available. I gave it a 3.5 for drinkability, because it is pretty harmless tasting, just not that mind-blowing a pilsner.","PatandDavid","Feb 23, 2003"
3.88,7.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Comes in a beautiful bottle. The color is a golden yellow and clear. The head that develops into a fine line of glass hugging very tight lace, and stays. Constant carbonation, easily seen and tasted. The smell is light, nothing overly spectacular. The flavor leans towards apples, a very good easy flavor. The flavor sticks with you without leaving that film in the mouth, you know the one that I am talking about. This thing is worth buying if you get the chance. Thank god for Xmas or I never would have gotten it.","schrist275","Dec 28, 2002"
3.9,8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Nice bottle.  Also expensive (for what it is).  At first a musty smell eminates as I pour the beer.  Faint yellow and clean looking, the smell subsided and a sweeter smell evolved.  Pretty much a solid brew.  Crisp and clean, faint grain and light malt flavors are upfront.  This is a very drinkable brew and you could put back a few if you had enough money.  I paid 2.99 for a 16 ounce bottle.  Not crazy, but not the best buy for your money.","AaronRed","Sep 13, 2002"
3.21,-11.1,3.5,2.5,3,4,4,"New import. Accidentally got 2 bottles since they had slightly different labels and I didn't look close enough to see they were the same. Don't know which one was fresher either. Both seemed slightly off. Quite expensive and turned out to be pretty run-of-the-mill. Clear golden yellow, good vibrant head, vague stale skunky aroma. A couple dark flecks of what looked like dead insect in one of the bottles. What the heck is that? The other one, which has a freshness date of 25.11.2002, was a bit skunkier. All in all, not much character, a standard Bavarian lager, smooth & rounded but lacking in taste - not unpleasant though. Slightly creamy, very bubbly. I'm sure this has been damaged by time and travel; surprising since this was a new arrival at the store. One bottle had noticeably less beer than the other before opening. Some very good qualities but just very little flavor. The Der Hirschbrau line of beers is brewed by Privatbrauerei Hoss. 4.7% abv.","Thrasher","Apr 30, 2002"
