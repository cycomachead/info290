Don't expect a summer wheat or kolsch because this beer is clearly a helles lager made to represent the German style. The smell was a bit doughy, like yeast meeting malts. The color was a bright orange. The taste reminded me more of a pilsner but better. Malt grain, a touch of citrus and virtually no hops. Overall it was ok, just not my preferred style.","WheelsPSU","Aug 28, 2013"

Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a thirst quenching beer on a hot day.","tone77","Aug 18, 2013"

As any simpleton, like me, might have deduced, an inverted aggro Glug was going to be nothing but trouble, so even with a gentle Glug, I was still getting foaming. It all worked out, however, as I ended up with two dense, foamy fingers of bone-white head that resembled to top of a swirly vanilla ice cream cone. Color was a deep sunshine-yellow with NE-quality clarity. SRM = 4/5. Nose smelled like the interior of a malt room at a brewery! Mouthfeel was medium-to full, big for a lager and the taste was biscuit malt and maybe some Noble hops to lend a grassiness to it. Mmmm. This was very dry, especially on the finish and I found myself longing for some pretzels to go with it. Would this go in my cooler? Heck, yes!","woodychandler","Aug 06, 2013"

This is either good or bad, depending on what you're expecting from the brew. If you're tired of the typical summer ale and thirst for something different, it's a good thing. If you just want something simple, quenching and refreshing for the summer months, it's bad. Either way, no one who appreciates beer would have a hard time enjoying it all the same.","VoodooBear","Jan 14, 2013"

3.72,1.9,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Ok, so I waited on this one a bit too long, it being mid-October when I finally got around to cracking it open. Pours into a shaker, a clear bronzed yellow with a slight chill haze, and a nice foamy white head that recedes to a thin layer leaving a bit of lace behind. I really like the aroma: honey and a touch of yeast funk, bready with a touch of hops. Crisp taste of grains and toasted bread, light floral hop bitterness for a dry finish and overall nice balance. Light mouthfeel, a tad metallic in the aftertaste, but definitely refreshing and drinkable overall.","Rifugium","Oct 21, 2011"

3.92,7.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Sampled on July 17, 2011. It has a pale yellow pour which is a little cloudy and there is virtually no head or lacing. The aroma is moderately malty with a citrus zing backing it up. The overall weught of the body is around medium but there is a nice smooth feel to it. The taste tends to be on the bitter side with a light hopped balance. Likeable.","puboflyons","Jul 17, 2011"

3.88,6.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Deep golden in the light and on the verge of copper just looking at it on the table. A decent amount of light fluffy head at the start but dwindles down to just a thick ring around the edges. The aroma is earth and hay with a solid backbone of fresh milled grain. Flavor is light and tangy sweet, subtly toasted malt flavors and a earthy/grassy hop finish. A lot of carbonation on the back of your throat along with a slight metallic tingle right after you swallow. However, that gets covered up by the grassy hops. The finish is has a bitterness that creeps on you but is pleasant. Some lemon flavors are present right as finish begins. Smooth and light body with a strong hop/bitter finish.","DrinkingDrake","Jul 04, 2011"

4.3,17.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Grabbed a growler of this stuff last time I was on Island. At the ACBF after telling the Cisco rep that this was one of my favorites, he told me that this years was their best batch ever, lets see if they're right. Lager smell comes rushing out as soon as the growler is opened. Clear gold in color, with a finger of white heading. Husky, fresh grain and red grape skin become apparent in the nose. More fresh grains in the taste, with the malt showing a lot of character. The balance is quite nice between the malts and hops, though the malts come out on top, as they should. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and makes for a perfect Summer session lager. After having had this beer numerous times since I first reviewed it, I am certain that the original review was of a bad bottle. That being said, this is a brew that should be had fresh, so drink your bottle soon, or go to the brewery and enjoy.","jamie2dope","Jun 23, 2010"

Maybe a tiny bit of green apple in the taste, too. Really good mouthfeel, bubbles almost feel "cleansing", in a way. Goes down smooth. I like it.

The taste is quite interesting, with a lager yeast background but then strong notes of the wildflower honey as well. Floral, sweet, and slightly waxy. Some bitterneess at the end. Still picking up some Belgian notes of clove, banana, and candi sugar but it is only relatively faint. Mouthfeel is full and creamy.

Pour of elysian gold, with a rim of white. Flavor is heavily herbed, sweet golden malts, with sweet phenolics on the rested grains. Deliciate and lightly floral. Having trouble digging out the characters, but this is rich and nicely bodied for a generally lighter styled beer. Nice and clean, and exemplary for the style. Hints of lemon juice. White pepper cracked over. Wafts of epazote. Some light dryness, but hops really dont play too much. Great body. Light tinge of indiscriminate hops and a good fresh malt sweetness in the end. Corn syrup smack. Great.","CharlesDarwin","Dec 09, 2006"

I think I also picked up bananas and some other fruit. Starting to get a cold, so ability to smell could be broken at this time. Taste was a whack in the face with an orange. As I drank this moved to a more general citrus flavor, but it was far stronger than the aroma led me to expect. The mouthfeel didn't do a lot for me, in that I thought the carbonation was too much. The "tingle" interfered with the taste. Overall, I felt that this beer was too citrusy. Not bad, but not one I am going to seek out again.","","Jul 05, 2006"

Anyway, it is particularly beautiful to look at, the full carbonation is not as agressive as your average Cisco, but it obviously raises a mamooth of a white head with mountainous lacing and rockiness. The body is fully hazy, golden. Surprising sourdough and angel cake (first time I use this describor and coincidentally, I see my buddy Clark mentions it also) maltiness dancing up the nostrils along with strong lemony, grassy and floral saazy hops. Whereas the bready toasted malts are drier than youd expect despite slight honeyish hints, the hops kick in gracefully, unagressively. Medium bodied, rather crisp high carbonation. It doesnt get much more refreshing, could actually be world-class if it were not of the overly attenuative Cisco yeast strain that procures such high carbonation (though thats really okay here) and almost metallic (or more so battery alkalinity) dryness. Its too bad, because it is one of the rare strains I can think of that brings a natural acidity that I enjoy, it just gets a bit overdone most of the time. Drink it when youre in the mood for a tart, yeasty, sourdoughy lager and youre in for a treat.","Rastacouere","Sep 11, 2005"

4.5,23.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Carefully poured from a longstanding 750ml bottle, the Summer of Lager is a crystal-clear deep-gold with an orange-ish cast. It's frothy bright-white head holds exceptionally well, no doubt buoyed by the steadily streaming effervescent carbonation from below; and it leaves wide sheets of thin but solid lace about the glass. The nose is clean, bright and fresh just like summer, with notes of malt, cut-grass, and flowers. The body is medium with a dextrinous edge; and it's zesty and then creamy across the palate with a very fine-bubbled, natural (it's bottle-conditioned), effervescent carbonation. The flavor reveals a sweetish, slightly toasty and "juicy" malt (typical of Munich malt) that's laced with grassy, floral, and subtly spicy hops; and balanced by a low-key bitterness that's just enough to dry it in the finish leaving the palate refreshed and ready for another sip. It's rich without being satiating, and it's immensely drinkable. It's very well done, and the 6.25% alcohol is never noticeable! It's certainly worth trying, and probably one of Cisco's best beers!","NeroFiddled","Dec 24, 2004"

The aromas are all biscuity and toasted malt with just the barest hint of hops in the background.  Greaty toasty malt starts off the brew and pretty much carries it all the way through.  There is a decent hop presence that balances things very nicely without really showcasing the hops at all.  The toasty/biscuity malt of this brew gives it some good body but allows it to stay rather crisp and nicely refreshing as a summer beer should be.  This is one of the best summer brews that I have had, nicely complex without going to far, no lame lemony/wheat mix and very refreshing, all of these characteristics combine to make this brew very drinkable and very desireable.","Murph","Aug 14, 2002"
