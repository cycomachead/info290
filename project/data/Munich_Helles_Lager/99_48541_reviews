"Overall not a bad little lager, though the subtleties were severely lacking it was still fairly decent"
"O- A decent helles lager, and one of Saranac's better beers. Easy to drink a few in a night."
"Off tap at the Ugly Duckling this beer was a pale golden color with one finger of off-white foam atop it. Lots of rising carbonation but the head retention was poor. The aroma was of crystal malt, some toasted malt, caramel malt and pilsner type hops. The flavors were above average for Saranac and, I thought, really quite good. I tasted grainy malts, mostly caramel and toasted with a slight note of corn followed by the crisp Czech hops. It was the use of the hops with finesse that impressed me with this one; it was a very refreshing beer and thus much more drinkable. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body medium and the carbonation average. For an inexpensive locally produced brew in central NY, look to this gem."
"D. I would put a couple back in the sun on the beach but not very many at home in the winter."
"Drinkability: Actually, it's one of the better brews oughta the 2010 Summer Box. Light, easy-drinking refreshment. When Saranac tends to take on somewhat bolder styles, the effort usually ends up a too-light, kinda-bland version of the style, but, when they aim for something light, they tend to hit the mark."
"Taste is similar, nice, crisp full grain character with light apple, grass, hint of herb. It is dryish with a grain aftertaste with a hint of lemon and herb."
"D- yeah, I could drink a few of these. Good for the summer. Nice and mild"
"Just another stop in the Leaving Falls Church uber-bender. It pours a clear pale straw topped by nearly two fingers of white froth. The nose comprises wheat, corn syrup, and flowers. The taste is similar, but sweeter and with a tinge of orange-y citrus in the background. The body is rather light, with a light carbonation and a fairly crisp finish. Wow, that was pretty short, but that's what I took away from this brew. It's good for a quick quaff, but nothing to sit and savor very much."
"The finish is dry and satisfying. All in all, a crisp and refreshing Lager and one I wouldn't hesitate to purchase again if I saw it available locally."
"feels good in my mouth, easily confused with seltzer (yes that overlaps with its lack of taste), however, does remain smooth and drinkable for sure, but as far as paying the ""craft brew"" premium for it...I don't think so."
"D: you might reach for another, just to make sure you didn't miss it the first time."
"I pulled a rabbit out of my hat with this surprise of a beer from my Saranac variety pack. My curiousity is instantly rewarded; can it happen again with another style?"
"Clear straw color with a small white lacing. Faint honey-like malt aroma with hints of grass. Honey undertones continue in the flavor, with doughy malt. Hops are light and lemony, and adequately clean up the finish. Creamy body, medium carbonation. Smooth, nice body, good condition. Clean enough for a helles. Actually quite authentic and tasty-- impressively so. I would drink this often if it were available here without the rest of their summer pack."
"D - I enjoyed it and would have had another."
"D: Easy to drink and refreshing this beer is a good representation of this classic style."
"Drinks easy, a okay not inspired take on the style. I could do a few before moving on, next..."
"Golden, with a pure white finger of foam that leaves fine sheets of lace on the glass. Fresh breadiness in the nose with hay and noble hops. A pretty trad take on the style, untoasted grain and soft fruity esters with a touch dry yeast and noble hops. Finishes squeaky clean. Light, crisp and ultimately easy drinking with no off flavors but no really great flavors either. A good thirst quencher."
"Overall a pretty fair example of the style. It is relatively easy to drink but not something I would normally or regularly choose."
"Overall: a fitting piece in this year's summer sampler... light yet flavorful enough to deserve a second thought, and good enough to be consumed with our without a hot dog..."
"D - Well like I stated before I really don't like lagers only amber lagers and this one was OK. I still have 3 left and they are not bad enough to drain but may be perfect on a hot summer day."
"Taste was just blase BMC likeish. Doesn't really taste like they put more than $2 worth of ingredients in a barrel size batch. The kind of beer for hydration ya know? No hops or malt to get in the way. Sure, its not my fave style, but there are examples I like. Not this one. Too expensive to be too drinkable."
"D: Drinkability is definitely the strong point here. While a bit sweet, a six pack is doable, on a hot summer day."
"Pulled out of the summer variety case. I think it's pretty cool that Saranac took on this classic lager style when so many craft brewers might just do a straight up pilsner. Like most Saranac beers, this lager doesn't have a great depth of flavor like a World-Class brew. But that said, they nailed the style and I really enjoy this beer. It has the trademark Helles toasty bread with a nice hint of spicy orange peel hops. I might say this is even on the hoppy end of the style. I wish more breweries made a good helles like Saranac has. This is a great summer beer."
"A decent brew and a nice tribute to the style from an American brewer yet not offerings the structure I hoped for."
"Drinkability: Easy-drinking with enough flavor to hold one's interest, and like the Pale Pale, I could see this being a good barbecue beer for sure."
"D - Well, I slammed this one down very easily. It's not great, but for a session beer if it were cheap I'd drink this over the BMC's any day."
"D: While none of the Saranac beers have had me raving, the German-style lagers are where they shine. This is a well made, tasty fresh Hellesbier, a style rarely made on this side of the pond."
"The feel of this beer is quite easy drinking. It goes down well and has a good amount of carbonation. Not a bad summer beer."
"An easy working beer. I haven't had a helles from any other brewery - but I generally like what's happening here. It's a more fruity/tart lager that's manageable. Would I keep it around? It's doubtful. I'd like to try another of this style."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a small head. Smell is mostly of malts. Taste is crisp, malts, slightly sweet,with a touch of bitterness. Feels light in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a decent but unremarkable beer."
"Comments: A good session beer for people who are bored with light beers. This beer fall short of the Munich Helles standard, but I prefer my Helles to be more like a Maibock than a standard American lager."
"One of the better Saranacs I've had. In retrospect, all of my preferred Saranacs are lagers--go figure."
"Notes: Overall it was a nice easy drinking and refreshing beer."
"Looked like a lager, smelled like a lager, tasted like a lager. Yep, it's a lager. Poured a clear yellow with a moderate head that quickly faded to a collar. The aroma was freshly scythed hay. The taste was sweet and undistinguished (i.e. lager). The feel was light bodied with sufficient carbonation. Drinkability was very good. Pretty decent example of style."
"Poured into my pilsner glass. Pours a clear bubbly light gold with a big white capper on top. Great retention; leaves some spotty lacing. Smells of grassy hops, sour lemon zest, and some grains. The mouth is crisp and bubbly, but still smooth. Flavors of mild bitter hops, fresh greens, and tart fruits on the finish. This is decent. A great refresher that went very well with my pizza. ""Saranac"" has done it again. I have yet to find one of their brews that I wouldn't have again."
"The mouthfeel was decent. It was drinkable but I wouldn't really recommend it. I was a little disappointed by this one."
"The color is a good medium golden. The aroma has some malt and honey. It's got a good carbonation level to it giving it a crisp mouth feel. There's a bit of malt sweetness upfront. Under it is some good earth flavors of straw. The hops in the end have a bit of a copper flavor to it. Some lemon left on the tongue. For a Helles, I'd say it's not sweet enough. It's more bitter than sweet. But forgetting that, a pretty good brew."
" Good session."
"Drinkability: nice crisp refreshing beer that hits the spot on a warm summer day. Easy to quaff a few of these."
"Poured out clear and brite. Color yellow (SRM4) with a full white head supported by high carbonation. Aroma has a moderate amount of DMS that dissipated but came back slightly when roused. Though DMS is to style, it was a bit too much (especially as sample warms) .Low hop aroma. Moderate spiciness to flavor with a clean malty finish that dries out at the end."
"for my first foray into this style i enjoyed it , wouldn't mind trying other beer of this style."
"Overall, this one went down easy, and was by far my favorite of the summer mix pack. Nothing earth shattering, but a nice clean refreshing summer beer for around the grill and such."
"It has a medium body, but is overcarbonated and somewhat abrasive. I can understand why Saranac packages these summer beers together. They are refreshing and very drinkable as a whole, but they fail to stand out individually."
"Overall a very drinkable & enjoyable beer. Enough flavor & character to be worth your while without overwhelming. They did right by releasing this in the summer, great for picnics or just sipping on your porch."
"If you like helles lagers, you must try this one."
"This is a nicely balanced, dry, easy-drinking lager."
"A nice beer for a hot day."
"D: Very good. I wouldn't mind having a sixer of these around for post-lawn mowing."
"The beer is fairly light bodied, very modestly carbonated, with a sweetish citrusy backbone, some herbal grassy notes, a bit of a spicey hop bite towards the finish, and a slight metallic taste in the mouth afterwards. The metallic flavors are not helping this beer, but it is offset a bit by the spice in the finish. This is a refreshing beer that goes down easy enough, but nothing to rave about either."
"Drinkability: Overall a decent Helles offering, not one of the best I've tried but still a good offering from Saranac. That metal taste still hurts this one overall, it's like drinking out of the high school water fountain. But it's decent for what it is."
"Pours a crystal clear golden color with a thick fluffy head that gives way to some okay lacing. You can see a great amount of carbonation activity through the glass. The smell is very weak with a hint of hops in it. The taste is the same it is slight hops but it is slightly watery. The mouthfeel is very harsh, it is totally overcarbonated. The drinkability is okay, the beer is watery and it has a harsh mouthfeel. You wouldn't drink alot of these."
"D) Not a standout. Decent beer. Good for a summer day."
"drinkability - Easy drinking beer, worth a try, came in the 12 days of Summer pack."
"Pours a pale clear golden yellow with a vibrant white head, forms tight with nice lacing following suit, sporadic chunky bits stuck to my glass. Aroma has herbal lemon peel mild citrus efforts with pale biscuit malt sweetness. Flavor is crisp assertive American brewed helles way better than your average corn and rice ridden macro any day. Flavor has some nice balanced hop bitterness and flavor to go with the moderate malt sweetness. Mouthfeel light bodied classic light beer, carbonation is spritzy and the finish is dry. Drinkability is quality a sipping beer I could quaff on after mowing the grass and never look back and drink through a sixer without blinking my eyes."
"For the price, I'll likely pick up the variety pack again. Can you blame me?"
"overall - Quaffable, but hardly great. probably the disappointment of the saranac summer pack."
"Pours a clear toasted straw color with a wispy white head that quickly settled into a light ring. The aroma is very faint, all I pick up is some slight sweet bready malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, just some slight bready malt. I can taste some of the munich malt but it is lost in the watery, grainy flavor. There is a slight grassy hop in the end. The feel is light and water with fizzy carbonation. This is merely a below average Helles lager. There is barely any munich malt presence and very little noble hops. The feel is too light as well."
"Drinkability: Enjoyable upfront but missing on the full picture. To watery to look for another one."
"Bottle. Pours a clear yellow with a small white head and lively carbonation. Aroma of sweet fruits and pale lager malts. Flavor of lots of bready/wheaty malt with some light sweetness in the finish. Again, a decent offering from Saranac although certainly on the boring side."
"nice golden color with a thin white head. little lacing. smell is not revealing much for me at the moment. maybe it's my allergies. taste takes off from the average beginning with a sour dough biscuit sense with malty sweetness held at bay by the crisp, high carbonation. which is good in that sense, but not great due to some hidden flavors the effervescence masks...makes this nonetheless very drinakable. fine alone, but would be a great beer with spicy foods."
"Easy to drink lager. Good representation of the style."
"D= very, and for most occasions or meals"
"Drink is very good for a session maybe a tad on the sweeter side for some."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a dry pilsner malt scent with low hops and just a touch of Munich malt. The taste is decent. It has a smooth, pilsner/Munich malt flavor along with a nice selection of hops. It has a bolder taste than the Czech variety. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an above average brew, but nothing I'd have again."
"A decent enough brew."
"I think if you could make a pillow into a beer, this would be it."
"D: One of Saranac's best offerings. It's too bad that there were only two bottles in the package."
"Pours a nice golden color.. moderate head to it and a good amount of lacing. Nice crisp, hoppy smell to it.. definitely a German sort of smell. Taste has a medium body and nice mouthfeel, again Saaz like hops sort of taste to it. Quite refreshing I must say, one of the better in their mixed 12 pack. Highly drinkable and pretty solid taste along with being very smooth.. good in my book."
"Saranac Helles is a clear pale golden beer with a thin white head that leaves some lacing. It has a fruity aroma that's faint and mellow. It's light, maybe medium-light bodied and pretty smooth with a dry finish. It is mellow and well balanced; a little funky, with notes of pretzels and grass. It's pretty uneventful."
"Saranac 12 beers of summer pack is at 3/3."
"Clear golden yellow color with a white head that left a few here and there spots of lacing. The aroma is strong noble hops, grassy and earthy. The taste is filled with malty sweetness leading up to a dry, bitter-sweet finish. Light/Medium bodied with a crisp, refreshing feel that is highly drinkable for those of us who love a good Barvarian-style beer."
"Overall- Very light but easily drinkable and eventually perks up."
"This is a wonderful drinking beer. Saranac did it right"
"Drinkability is very good. Light, crisp, flavorful, refreshing. A great beer for the summer! Also, a great beer to ease your friends off of macro/adjunct lagers."
"A nice example of the style. Anyone who says that Saranac only makes crappy examples of styles is dead wrong. This is spot-on and worth a shot. If you can't enjoy a good munich helles lager, I feel sorry for you."
"Final Thoughts - Fan of some of the larger European companies should give this one a go. Decent representation of the style. Great in a mix pack but I would not seek this one out for itself."
"Definitely a worthwhile beverage and something that could stand alone in a 6 pack."
