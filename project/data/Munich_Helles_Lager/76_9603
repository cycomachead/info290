The smell of the brew is grainy and a little grassy. The taste of the beer was earthy amd a little on the sweet side. The finish was crisp and bitter. The mouthfeel was drinkable, it was light to medium bodied. Overall this beer was pretty good, I would probably have it again.","Knapp85","Dec 24, 2011"

Nothing really stood out to me that left me wanting to seek more interpretations of this style. With that being said, it still is one up on any macro available to me and a great summer quaffer. I'll stick to their Hefe's though ;)","ludachris","Jun 30, 2010"

3.1,-14.8,3,3,3,3,3.5,"On tap. Pours clear yellow with a smallish white head that disappears quickly and leaves very little lacing. Very faint smell that hints at grain; not much going on here. Similarly unimpressive taste; light grain, and that's about it. Barely noticeable hop notes. Feel is light and fizzy. Unoffensive--I guess 'clean' is a nice way to put it. Bland and characterless, and kind of disappointing. Maybe this was an older keg?","philipquarles","Aug 15, 2009"
3.52,-3.3,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall its not a bad example of the Munich helles style, but I don't think its a particularly great one either. Its the sort of beer I could see as easy to drink lots of on a night out with friends because its straightforward and fairly quaffable. However for sitting at home and considering its virtues, its a poor choice considering the cast range of craft beer out there. A lawnmower beer down to the smell and taste of grass clippings.","bobsy","Mar 28, 2009"

It's sweet with some breadlike aroma. There is some fruitiness as well as a light German hop presence. The taste is good. This is a fantastic Helles. It's smooth with an excellent malt flavor. It goes down easy with a nice Munich malt sweetness and finishes clean with a dry German hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is great. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation.

No skunky smell like you can detect in some of those green bottle light-polluted beers like Beck's or St. Pauli girl. This one has a brown bottle. It tastes the same way it smells.

3.33,-8.5,3,2.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The beer pours a lightish yellow, or what some call straw color. The head dissipates pretty quickly, but there is some residuals on the side of the glass and minimal lacing. The smell is the low mark and it reminded me too much that I was in for a really crappy American macro. The taste, thankfully, is better than the smell. It is a light, fairly carbonated, lager, with some breadiness, some wheatiness, and spriteliness. There is a little bite at the end that tastes like some yeast popping through. Not much hop to this beer. Very refreshing, drinkable, light, with a smooth mouthfeel. You can't go wrong, but it isn't a brilliant beer by any stretch. L'Chaim.","albern","Jul 14, 2007"

The taste is light, light hop, light grain, light malt, doesn't have a pronounced helles taste. The feel is light and well carbonated, very slightly bitter in aftertaste. An average helles but still a fine beer and very drinkable, great for wanting to down a few.","Gmann","Jul 03, 2007"

Everytime I try a good hellas I wonder why so few good one's are avail from US breweries... THe closest thing to this made near me is Velas Hellas in Gatlinburg....which is about equally as good but a little more color. Edelhell is crisp and refreshing and fairly well done.

Pilsener malt and noble hops in the nose with a hint of munich malt. Solid pale malt sweetness upfront, with a subtle touch of busicuity malt flavor. The mild saaz and hallertau flavor in the aftertaste shows an impressive balance, and leaves the tounge pleasently dry. A gently crisp mouthfeel with medium carbonation and light-medium body. Finishes clean and refreshing. Not terribly complex, but it has a very agreeable malt/hop character; a tasty thirst quencher for sure.","PBRstreetgang","Oct 17, 2006"

Poured a light yellow, big head - left good lacing. Simple flavour, nothing all that paletable but easy to drink. Texture is alittle thick. Not exactly a favourable aroma, but again, nothing offensive. Its got a little more definition than most pale Euro lagers which I think places it a little above.

Pretty cool. Light, but nice. First impression is sweet and grainy. But there's also some light crackery like pilsner maltiness too. And there's a bit of a dry snap on the finish. A hoppy snap.

3.75,3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours out a vibrant clear medium gold, a tall white head that recedes after a short while, leaving small patches of lacing here and there. The nose, while not overly complex, is what it should be, mild grains, some biscuity malt and rounded off with floral, meadowy hops, nothing seems out of place. The flavour itself starts out with crisp dry grains, a bit of biscuit in the middle that joins up with some grassy hops that lead it to finish of sweet cut grass and a lingering moist grainy aftertaste, crisp, but only becoming dry well along the aftertaste. The mouthfeel for the most part is also crisp and dry, and very thirst-quenching. This would make a wonderful patio beer on hot summer days, a good way to class-up some barbecuing as well. A style and an effort that could very easily slip under the radar as it is not very robust or boisterous in its flavours, but everything is done well and is in the right place. A fine lager that I'll being buying more of while the weather still lasts.","IronDjinn","Aug 30, 2005"
3.78,3.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"500ml bottle with a picture of a traditional barmaid on the label. It felt right to pour it into a hefe glass, and it formed a perfect size of fluffy styrofoam-white head. A mixture of bubbles, and sometimes it appeared quite creamy, other times a little fizzy. The beer is very clear and straw-coloured: very very lightly colouring here--in some light it looks almost green. Lacing is large-bubbled but sticky, and the foam finally settled on the beer's surface and stayed quite consistent and dense. A very good appearance, and a thirsty man's dream. Grassy bits of malt in the aroma, with good breadiness and some floral hoppiness to fit the style. I think I prefer the more subdued hoppiness of helles to pilsner. Some creamy caramel notes, a little vanilla, and German hops which give some herbal and slightly bitter metallic aromas. Biscuity and like cereal; grainy. There is definitely a little fruitiness in this aroma as well, which was kind of pleasantly surprising. Mango or pear, mostly, green apples too, reminding me of some hefes. I found many German pale lagers actually had ale-like fruitiness when I was over there, and this reminds me a bit of some. A piquant aroma that is extremely appetising. A delight in the mouth too: instead of the expected bitterness we might expect from a beer this colour, thinking it will be similar to pilsner-style, I get more of the fruitiness along with lightly roasted maltiness. The breadiness is all up front, like sweet bread, cinnamon buns, or a little brown sugar. The hops are always there, but they play second fiddle to the other tastes, and the finish of this beer is supremely balanced by apple, honeyish malt, and a little metallic tang dryness. In the middle I sense a little of the alcohol. The aftertaste is definitely bitter, but not in the pilsner way--this is more balanced. Other flavours include a little pineapple, some tomato-juice tang(a little), and some malty sourness. Not overly complex, but fitting and worthy of its style. The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated for the style, quite foamy and velvety on the mouth--no real sparkling or crisp carbonation, which is nice. Medium-bodied and endlessly quaffable. A helles I would buy again(when summer returns.)","Cwrw","Aug 18, 2005"

3.83,5.2,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This beer poured a crystal clear golden color with a white head about an inch tall. The aroma is a little bit grassy with some malt and some hop aroma. The taste is sweet with light malt infused with some mild hop bitterness. Decent mouthfeel. High carbonation makes you pace yourself. Light/medium body. It's a good drinkable beer. It'd beer perfect for a night of playing cards.","Brian700","Jul 21, 2005"
4.5,23.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Aroma is a wonderful blend of creamy malt and spicy hops. The flavor and texture are superb- maltiness, hop flavors, bitterness, residuals, and alcohol are all in perfect balance to one another. You just can't ask for much more from a helles- it is easy to drink yet it has a definite personality and pulls no punches in terms of alcohol (5.5% AbV) or bitterness. Even after three or four in a row this beer loses nothing through repetition. It's one of my favorite session beers (when reasonably fresh).","TongoRad","Jul 13, 2005"
3.88,6.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This beer produced a two-finger creamy head on top of a highly carbonated clear brassy colored beer. Aromas of hops and grass were detected.

Simplistic smell. Herbs and grass, with a little bit of malt. Taste is primarily grassy hops. Reminds me of mowing the lawn. Tasty, but plain. Mouthfeel is clean, crisp, plain and dull.

Smells like a loaf of fresh bread, maybe a light rye and grassy hops. The first taste displays the delicate toasted malt that lends a subtle, light honey-like sweetness, hops are brisk, peppery and spicy. Some lemon hop notes are underlying. This is incredibly fresh. The texture is creamy smooth and somehow shifts to crisp and thirst quenching. I was impressed with this brew. I appreciated its simplicity and its outstanding drinkability. I will buy this again.","John","Aug 17, 2004"

Nose is malt, fresh, clean and crisp. Front is mostly malt and somewhat sweet, the top is reedy, the finish bitingly acidic, pleasantly hopped, with a dry somewhat bitter aftertaste. Quite quaffable, and one of the handful of Lagers/Pils, I can call Delectable","Gusler","Jul 29, 2004"

The taste is sharp and hoppy with a malty undertone. The malt does break out at times and give a range of sweet flavors in the finish. To me the taste is better with food as this beer is quite clarifying. The feel is pretty much a nice moderately dry and light beer. Definately a well made beer, but not one that would attract me to come back too often.","claytri","Jul 03, 2004"

4.31,18.4,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"German pilsners are so different than what Yanks are used to. There's no overwhelming hit of corn in the taste here. A slight burn from the bubbles, a mellow and lovely deliverance of that malt and hop promise in the nose, and then...nothing. Leaves the tastebuds clean (practically scoured). This would be a lovely way to cleanse the palate between cheese tastings, but dangerous as I could see myself unthinkingly downing 4 or 5 all in a rush. I would be less inclined to reach for the English ales and darker brews if more pilsners were this fine.","Hunter","May 30, 2004"

The liquid is completely clear, with ever-present bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Perfumy, floral hop aroma: soft and flowery sweetness. Taste is a mix of soft, mildly sweet pilsner maltiness and a grainy, vegetable-like earthiness. Finish is clean and moderately hoppy. Light bodied, soft, and extremely drinkable. Theres nothing extraordinary or remarkable about this beerit is, however, a solidly quaffable, refreshing brew.","Suds","Feb 22, 2004"

Sweet pale malt aroma with a big dose of bittering, grassy, herbal hops. Crisp, clean, and well carbonated in the mouth. Taste is mildly sweet from the light malts, but is well balanced by the bittering hops. The hops profile is a highlight here, wavering constantly between citrus and floral, but always staying clean and easy on the palate. Finishes with a dryness that is slightly bitter, but is fruity in a strange, nonsweet way. I could drink these all afternoon. A very refreshing Bavarian lager here that hits all the right notes for the style.","merlin48","Jan 31, 2004"

3.29,-9.6,4.5,3,3,3,4,"Pellucid auric hue. Steadfast, pitted porcelain white head leaves lace. Waft of herbal hops with a grassy twang contrasted by subtle hints of bready pilsner malt and sulfur in aroma. Tame, but not quite immaculate aromawise. Brusque, gentle snap of doughy malt initially in flavor yields to a transient carbonic acid bite. Softens mid palate, with a combination of underbaked cracker and herbaceous sweetness in the forefront. Well attenuated and prickly upfront, but mellows into a lanky, but passably dextrinous mouthfeel. Hints of vegetal, yeast derived DMS surface late, due to lack of noteable malt character. Finishes abrupt, with quickly fleeting simple notes of maltose and trace Vienna malt. Quite a refreshing brew, but certainly not outstanding. Innocuous and quaffable.","marc77","Nov 06, 2003"

Taste: Finishes very clean with there is a balance of hop bitterness and grainy sweetness but overall cleans the palate, a great bier to drink by the liter in my opinion. Helles does mean light but this bier has much more flavor than any American ""light/lite"" beer, Ein Prosit to that eh? Mouthfeel: Light to medium in body, but overall decent carbonation pretty thin though not as much texture as the Paulaner original Munich formula. Drinkability: Nice grass cutting brew, compelements many summer outdoor activities or if not in the mood for a big beer a nice change of pace in my opinion.","WVbeergeek","Nov 05, 2003"

Not a whole lot going on in the aroma department. A little bit of malt, but most notable was the fresh hay/grass smell, add some grain in there and that sums it up. The taste was fairly refreshing although not real flavorful. First impression is the little bit of malt that comes through followed by a very grainy taste.

No chocolate, coffee, berries, raisins, smoked wood, bananas, or fruit soaked in rum, nor overly flamed crème brulee. Just beerBeer! A nice white head rests atop the shiny gold body. The lace clings for a while then slides into obscurity. A real beer aroma of malt, hops, yeast, and alcohol are easy to identify. The herbal malt body is more substantial than it appears and reveals a slightly grainy and lightly sweet taste. The citrusy hop bitterness matches the smooth malt to perfection. A light fume of alcohol and trace of yeast flavors round out this very drinkable beer. Bring on the summer!","BeerResearcher","May 06, 2003"
