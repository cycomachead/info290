"If I didn't know anything about any of the beers this company made and a stranger asked for my recommendation,I'd tell them to try anything except the Helles. All of the beers they make are great except this one."

"The same goes for what should be a crisp, light-bodied beer; it weighs heavy with an off slickness on the tongue. It is somewhat crisp, but not enough to redeem this beer."

"Had this Moerlein offering at the Wilder, KY Mellow Mushroom for a Bengals game day lunch. Wanted something local to Cincinnati and glad i chose this. Came in a chilled pint glass. Reminded me alot of Stella Artois but with a smoother finish. Very tasty. Not bitter. Went very well with an all meat pizza. Was so impressed that i went out and purchased a six pack from Party Town in Erlanger KY."

"Medium-light body; lightly crisp carbonation; slightly dry finish."

"This being an Ohio beer, and me living in Ohio, I admit that I wanted to like it. But it really doesn't have much to like--or dislike for that matter. The nose and taste are dominated by sweet malt, but there's a considerable dryness to the finish. Flavors are muted here, but you'll smell and taste bread and caramel. The mouthfeel is thin and carbonation is relatively low. Overall, this is a step up from the macro lagers, but at $8.49-$8.99 for a six pack, it just doesn't have much to make it stand out from the others beers in that price range. While I didn't dislike this, I won't be buying this one again. Next time I'm looking for an Ohio beer I'll be sure to stick to Great Lakes, Thirsty Dog, or Columbus Brewing Company."

"It pours a clear straw color with a good amount of carbonation. 1 finger white head goes away quickly. Typical lager smell, maybe a little more robust then some. This beer has a lot of crispness to it. For what it is, this lager has a wonderful feel and finish. With its small ABV this beer could be drank all night long. Moerlein as a whole makes too many lagers, but most are quite good. It would be a good start for someone who only drinks Budweiser."
""
"Overall, for how light this was I enjoyed it. It represented the style fairly well. The blandness was the only bad part."
"While not Moerlein's best, this is still okay for giving to your BMC-drinking friends at tailgates or house parties. It's a good transition beer, as I said... or if you don't necessarily want to go all-out for your regular go-to beer, this might suit you."

"Overall: a very mild Helles lager that leaves you wanting a bit more malt flavor. Very easy to drink, but one is enough in a session."

"O: This beer tastes a bit cleaner compared to other Munich Helles Lagers and doesnâ€™t have quite as pronounced hop flavors."

"Original Lager pours a golden color, with lots of carbonation, and a nice size head, looks refreshing. There is a nice strong pale aroma, very dry, but strong. The taste is a bit watery and light at first, then finishes with a strong dry flavor on the palette. Easy to drink, and enjoyable. Overall this one took me by surprise, the first sip could be better, but the beer gets better the more you drink."

"Overall, a very drinkable beer, albeit lacking in intangibles."
"Overall I was a little disappointed with this beer. All the flavors were somewhat muted and it was really boring. Not sure I would seek out again."

""
"The flavor is sweet and yeasty. A bit of noble hops. Really not typical for the style."
""

"Much better than expected."

"Wow, I must have had much worse taste in college, or this new iteration of CM doesn't live up to what I remember. Either way, I'll finish this sixer for nostalgia's sake, but don't see myself seeking this out again. What bums me out most is that I picked up extras of this for a friend who grew up in the Cinci area and intended to surprise him with it; now, my concern is that the surprise will be at the decline of this beer, rather than the fact that I found it at all."
"O -- Overall I like this beer. It's not the perfect Helles, but the nostalgic flavor seems to have grabbed me. Sort of like going back in time, especially nice in the summertime."
"Bright, frosty gold-colored liquid topped with a thin, bubbly head. Smells of sweet grains, honey, and candied vegetables. Tastes similar to its odor; primarily honey and vegetables. Very different from the sweet vegetable flavor associated with adjunct lager, though. Has a nice, light body despite the complex flavor profile-I could drink several of these without getting tired of it or feeling full."
"D- Easy to drink and great to have a cooler full of it."
"Overall: A step up from the normal yellow fizzy beers. Not unique enough to grab my attention, but would drink again. This would be a good gateway beer for BMC drinkers."
"Drinkability - This, to me, is a step above the ""macros."" It still has some of the characteristics, however like the pronounced corn/grain aromas and taste. This would be nice in the Summer, but I would probably look elsewhere after a couple."
"This stuff has a decent flavor and I would take it over a lot of other sessionable beers if I had the offer. Perhaps it is the season that is making critical. If it were summer this stuff would hit the spot."
"This very much called to mind Bitburger. Poured golden, a bit washed-out. Flavor was clean and crisp, with a distinctive German hops note that, to me, always carries a slight note of grape. Just a bit thin and lacking however - not bad, but seemed like the grain bill could have been improved."
"If the beer avoided the diacetyl (oily) character, attenuated better, and had any herbal hop flavor or balanced bitterness, then a better assessment can be made. With that, there's too many distractions- not sure if this is an attempt at a Munich Helles or a Pre-Prohibition Pilsner, or anywhere in between- pretty non-descript."
"I am not too experienced with a Munich Helles, but I do like this beer. Nothing offsetting about it in the taste, though the nose is a little to vinous for my taste."
"Drinkability: Very very drinkable. I could easily have another of these. It went very well with a meal (refried bean burritos) and I could easily see myself drinking a few of these with some nuts on the side, popping them in while chatting and drinking the beer for quite awhile. But I have a sweet tooth - I think for some this could get old after a few, but if you balance it with something stronger or salty, then it will shine nicely."
"D: I could easily see going through a 6-pack of this on a hot day."
"My enjoyment of Lager House closely follows the progression of the finish. In this particular instance, I think a cooler temperature works in this beer's favor."
"Served in a pint glass; poured from a cellar temperature bottle. The beer has a golden hue with a bit orange mixed in. There is noticeable carbonation rising within the glass. There was a small white head, but is disappeared very quickly.Virtually no lacing to speak of. It has an average citrus hop aroma. It's pleasant, but unremarkable. It has a typical malty flavor; it's a bit bready and a bit buttery. There is a hop presence, but it is very small. It has a medium body and very little mouth coating. You can really feel the carbonation bubbles. To me, it feels sharp on my tongue. I don't like it all that much, I prefer a smoother lager. The beer is pretty middle-of-the-road when it comes to drinkablity. It goes down all right, but with every sip, I kind of wish I had opened a different bottle. There's nothing wrong with this beer, it's a perfectly well made craft brew, but it's average for the field. There are many other beers I prefer more than this one that I would rather drink, but I would refuse a bottle of the Lager House if it were offered to me."
"Saltine cracker, crisp, pretty dry in the end leaving a faint breadiness. A very mild bitter elelment, no hop flavor left that I can pick up. Aftertaste of honey minutes later. Crisp carbonation, then dry. This is fairly average, though fresh on draft it may be better."
"Christian Moerlein Lager House Original Golden Helles may not be the poster child for the style, but it has enough going for it to be a worthwhile purchase for those Cincinnatians looking to drink locally brewed beer. Assuming it wasn't brewed at Pennsylvania's Lion Brewery, as it has been in the past."
"Golden cast with a slight white head of fine foam that leaves some blobs of lace behind on the glass as it melts. The nose is grainy with floral hop notes and apple skin. Slight bready grain and mild steely hops make up the flavor profile on this one. Light bodied and crisp, finishes dry. A pretty run of the mill lager."
"D: This beer is solid overall as a go to that isn't too heavy."
"Overall, easy to drink-a couple of notches above a macrobrew"
"5.0 D: Pretty good beer. I usually hate the style, but this one is a winner."
"I like the idea that large brewers like Boston Beer Company try and make a local product but they should put more effort into it. Like most of what I have tasted from BBW, I don't think this is really not up to their normal standards."
"Drinkability: A fine, serviceable lager when it comes to light, easy drinking, but, for me, I'm left wanting just a skosh more in the flavor and aroma department. Next time I'd like to see a little more, Moerlein."
"All in all this was not bad, but I know there are better Helles out there. Maybe in Cincy at a bar I might try this again, but I am not running to the store to get more of this anytime soon."
"The lack of hop presence reminds me of a cheap adjunct lager. Definitely not up to par for the style. I thought maybe I had poured the wrong beer in my glass when I first tasted this as it tastes very BMC."
"D: Pretty good beer. I liked it better as I made my way through the pint. initially wasn't crazy, by the end I wanted another."
"Nikki"
"Mouthfeel is slightly watery and thin. Carbonation is good and refreshing. Decent summer lawn mower beer."
"Light body with medium high carbonation makes this easy to toss back, an important quality in a helles, but otherwise this fairly inoffensive lager misses the helles-mark pretty badly. Definitely not in Spaten territory. If you are looking for an inoffensive quencher at a reasonable price, this is fine. If you want all of the subtle and refreshing qualities of a fine German helles, keep looking."
"Christian Moerlein Lager House Original Golden Helles pours a golden yellow with a thin whtie head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is grainy. The flavor is a bit grainy, there is a touch of lemon like twang. Not bad, a reasonable substitute for macro lagers."
"Pours a clear amber with fast fading 2 finger white head, spotty lacing. Smell: light toastiness, grain, husk, maybe a little lemon, veggieness. Taste: biscuity, grassy, lemon, a little honey and husk. Generally subdued, I'm not getting that light spiciness I expected. Light bodied, active carbonation, semi sticky / semi dry finish. This one didn't really do it for me, though I liked their ofest."
"Very pale amber in color and a nice two finer head that sticks a bit. One column of bubbling. Very light tasted malt and some faint banana notes from the yeast. A little off-putting for a Munich Helles. But some grassy hops. Crisp yet yeasty fruit taste to this helles. Some toasted water crackers for malt, herbal, grassy hops, and some banana and bubblegum yeast. crisp,but a little too yeasty for my taste in a helles."
"This was the first 'legal' beer I had two years ago with an excellent steak dinner at the Precinct in Cincinnati. This week I tried another bottle at the Southgate House and decided it needed another review. This beer basically tastes like a slightly more flavorful BMC. It is a bit more golden than the others with only a little more taste and smell. The big advantage this has over the big guys is that it's local which raises it a couple notches in my book. While nothing special, I would recommend at least trying it when in the Cincinnati area if for nothing else than to support the local brewery."
"Pours gold in color with whatever head there is disappearing before I can walk away from the counter. Smell is malty, but not a very good malt. Not a lot of hops or spice in this at all. Very malty, highly carbonated. Tastes very BMC'ish. A little puckering, bittering in the end, but I'm not sure that's from any semblance of hopping. A little bit of a letdown from Moerlein."
"D - at 5.2 this is a damn fine session."
"Overall though it ws a decent effort, though I have to admit not very exciting. I would not mind trying it again thought I would doubt that i would pay for one."
"Drinkability: Hell yeah.... all day long."
"D: This is a very smooth brew. I'd consider is a summer beer."
"A smooth drinker which could use a bit more character overall, but still fulfills its intended purpose."
"D: Nice, easy and crowd pleaser for spring or summertime. Not my favorite style of beer, but it was good for it's style - I'd recommend it."
"D: Tasty enough and very sessionable. Wouldn't mind knocking a few more of these back after a long day in the sun. Their website lists this as 5.2% ABV"
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Body is medium with delicate carbonation. Finish is close to dry. This is an easy drinking beer that I do enjoy. I can definitely see myself picking this one up again when in the mood for malt rather than hops."
"Drinkability - not a great sessionable, but a good one. It would work for most any season except maybe winter. I imagine it would do well with a number of foods, too."
