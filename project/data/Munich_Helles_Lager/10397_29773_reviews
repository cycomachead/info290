"Got this in a random craft brew 12 pack. Nothing special."
"A nice tasting lager with a nice floral taste.  I love the pop off lids"

"O: A refreshing fresh, aromatic Helles. One of the best in US."

"A plain good beer, pretty traditional German Helles - perfectly clean."

"Overall - Average. Really light and easy to drink. Nothing special and the flavors are very light. Its fine for a summertime beer to pound away at but nothing id take over a lot of other summertime beers."

"Poured into a Sam Adams glass, developed a nice, bubbly white head with some retention and minimal lacing. Aroma had notes of yeast and grain. Appearance was a golden straw with some clouding. Tasted light with mild grain and grass notes, some hoppy bite on the back. Mouthfeel was light with a mild and clean aftertaste."

"O: Sly Fox Golden Lager is a stellar lager with just the right mix of pilsner and Munich graininess with noble hopping -- they have made an outstanding brew here."

"Overall: Just got home from the gym and this beer quenched my thirst. Just moved on to the second can. Next time through PA, there will be a it stop in Pottstown."

"Overall: A nice and clean sessionable lager. Not the most complex beer, but a good one. I have had better in the style, but would not turn this down."

"This is an awesome, basic beer when you just want a straight up beer. Highly drinkable. Also really dug the open top cans. Good job Sly Fox."

"Not a dud, but below par for SF."
"It has a sweet Pils malt aftertaste, and bitterness up front of Tettnanger, but if it were sold in Germany, it'd be on par with Oettinger, a REALLY cheap beer sold in Germany and usually seen in the hands of street people, and that's not good."
"O- This is a pretty good beer. I enjoy the straw flavor, which tastes fresh and rich. Unlike many other golden lagers of America, with their stale, pissy, flavors."

"Appears crystal clear golden straw with a magnificent white head, canned to perfection great suds to look at and embellish in. Aroma has fresh baked bread like notes herbal earthy grassy hops, flavor comes off crisp refreshing biscuit and pils malt with enough hops 18 IBUs to keep things interesting. Great summer beer my new staple for golfing and grass mowing, body is light finishes crisp perfect drinkable PA lager! Paired with Room 101 Namakubi Ecuador excellent spicy cigar with enough ligero to put hair on your chest!"

"Overall: A refreshing beverage for the summer, I enjoyed the lemon citrus notes along with the bready pilsner malts. Makes for a good canned option, and it uses a vintage pull tab design which makes for a smooth pour. Sly Fox Helles Golden Lager makes for a great warm weather, lighter craft option."

"Many thanks to woodychandler for providing this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can, and I am not really felling this cup/can design. Has a golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is mild, a bit of malts. Taste is crisp, malts, some hops, refreshing and easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good session beer."
""
"Light, golden yellow in color with excellent clarity. Poured with a thick white foam that reduced to a soapy and wispy cap. Generally fresh with biscuity german malt aromas and a touch of citrus lemon hop at the back end. Biscuity, malty flavors up front, and a spicy hop bite through the middle. Lemon hop bitterness from the middle to fhe finish. Finishes with a crisp, biscuity lemony hop bitterness."
"A modest craft example of a Helles Lager. Decent, if not better than decent. A sure-shot buy of the 'I-need-a-sixer-of-a-tasty-and-easy-craft-lager-in-can-format' ilk. No problem to polish off three or four in a single session. Haven't tried drinking from the can, yet; 'yet' being the operative word here."

"Overall another great beer from Sly Fox but I have had better reps of the style. Goes down easy though with session able qualities."

"I started the Crack and the whole top came off in my hand! Aaaaahhh! I CAN see into the CAN itself! This is not how The CANQuest operates and I am not sure that I like it. No Glug, but more of a Blorp!, like emptying a CAN of food into a bowl or dish. I had a brief finger of bone-white head, but it quickly dissipated. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had the characteristic honey-like sweetness of good, adjunct-free lager. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was unmistakably lager with a light grassiness, thanks to the hops. Finish was mild, semi-sweet, very unobtrusive. Given its relatively low ABV and unimposing flavor, I CAN see why people would flock to this. It is certainly appropriate for the cooler and the CAN is a novelty, but I hope that it is not a coming trend."

"O - Tastes like ""beer, beer"" with a belgian touch. not bad, but I'm digin the can design big time, I hope it catches on if everyone is going to start switching to canning."

"Great beer. Not sure if I like the price ($36). It's not that memorable of a beer and doesn't have a real signature taste. It's not a bad beer. It's just a good light German ale. It's a solid choice if you're a fan of Pilsners."
""
"Sly Fox does lagers as well as anyone. The can design puts it over the top. This will be a staple in my fridge."

"Transparent golden yellow with a thick creamy white head. The nose is lightly toasted grain with a touch of dough malt balanced by a fairly assertive citric hop in the back with a grassy, earthy grain lingering in the back. The flavor has a more assertive grain flavor, light notes of dough with a strong citric bitterness. There is a lightly floral and grassy hop note accompanied by some tangy rye like grain in the finish. Really light, fluffy, and creamy feel with a medium syrupy body and crisp assertive carbonation. The beer is balanced and smooth, light and crisp. Nice stuff, stronger on the grain side than I love but still very enjoyable."

"D - A simple and straightforward... Enjoyable and refreshing... Doesn't try to be anything more than what it actually is, a very drinkable lager... The 4.6% makes it even more drinkable... Any one seeking out a simple, straight forward, and well executed lager should give this Sly Fox offering a change..."
"Overall a tasty beer and good rendition of the style."
"Overall- Delicious and quenching. This 1 is a must to try if you visit the Brewpubs."
"Perfect session beer if you're in the mood for a fresh German style lager."
"Pours pale yellow with a fluffy head and lots of carbonation. Smell is grainy and bready with a kiss of hops. Flavor very light, grainy with a bit of noble hop. Mouthfeel is quite light. Great summer beer"
"i got hooked on this beer when i was working at the royal tavern in south philly and since it has become one of my favorite lagers. nice golden body, crisp taste, with very little aftertaste, which is fine by me. pretty good example of the style, except for maybe being a bit ""bolder"" than what you would normally find. great beer, awesome brewery."
"Overall a nice light drinking lager that I enjoyed. I have had better lagers, but Sly Fox did a nice job making this what it's meant to be."
"($5 / Pint)"
"Cheers!"
