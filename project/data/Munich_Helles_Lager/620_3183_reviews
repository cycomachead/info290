"I'm a little biased because this is one of my favorite beer styles. But I really like this beer. I will have this one again for sure. Beware... It's so drinkable, the alcohol sneaks up!"
"i feel like this could be better with a little more carbonation. a sweet lager, almost pils like, with a dry finish. very crisp, flavorful, and refreshing."

"Poured into a 1/2 liter stein a honey tinged light golden color with a fluffy one finger white head atop.Grainy withiron notes in the nose,light toast a faint sweetness as well.Quite dry on the palate with that toasted grain element coming thru,faint vanilla tinged sweetness with slightly detected sour bite in the finish.Not bad,not very complex but it's great while outside grilling on a kick ass autumn like today gearing up for uopefully another Tiger beat down of the Yankees tonight."
"O - A tasty ale with loads of pilsener style hop notes. Definitely flavorful a suitable for the style. Well worth the 4 pack that it came in."

"Overall, this beer is exceptionally easy to drink and should be drunk often. Possibly one of the best lagers that I have ever tried."

"Take the rating of this one with a grain of salt. I am sure it is a lot better when it is fresh, this bottle obviously is not fresh."
"Dry crisp clean finish. I haven't had many Helles Lagers so I don't know how this compares to others, but I didn't much enjoy this one and won't be seeking it out again."
"Light bodied with a little carbonation. Great drinkability! Classic German taste! All I can say is I loved this Lager!"
"D - Very drinkable and well made. The malt character is rich and intense with enough noble hops to keep it balanced. This is a really excellent example of the style and one that seems to have held up well despite the long trip from Germany."
"O: Being my first from this style it didn't impress me. Not really into lagers anyways. Definitely a easy drinking beer. Low ABV, no bitterness, and easy on the palate flavors make it an easy session beer."
"O: Delicous! If you dont drink Lagers then you can not identify but I agree with the Bros on this. Solid A Lager..no doubt"
"A middling effort all around"
"Pours a clear pale yellow, with a few dense fingers of head. Sticky lace and moderate retention. To style, I guess. Nose of slightly sweet grain, mild floral hops and not a ton else going on. Taste is similar, and tame. Some subtle noble hops, a dominant pale malt and a weird slimy film that lingered on my mouth and palate for a while. Definitely not attractive at all, did something go wrong? Decent mouthfeel when I got 'used' to that. Medium low carbonation, kinda drinkable I guess. Wasn't a big fan."
"I really have to stress that this was not a poor-tasting brew. It's quite flavorful and has most of the things I'm looking for in a Munich helles. However, the poor appearance and lifeless body reveal one of two things: that Neuschwansteiner doesn't ship well to Ontario (and hopefully tastes better in its native Southern Germany), or this beer is simply not among the brewery's best. Since I so enjoyed their bock and hefeweizen imports, I'm going to lean towards the latter."
"Neuschwansteiner is not your fairytale lager but it does have a happy ending, in that in the end I was very happy to have drunk it. All of the HirschBrau products I've had have been more than passable and, while they haven't exactly exhibited the quality or craftsmanship for which German breweries are renown, they have showcased just how agreeable and wholesome their styles tend to be and, indeed, this is both those things."
"Overall - tasty, but nothing special. A bit too much on the sweet side."
"D - I wouldn't seek this out but I enjoyed the bottle I had. Nice and refreshing and decently flavourful."
"Drink - Just an average beer.. its highly drinkable but nothing worth seeking out."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with low to medium carbonation. Drinkable, a decent lager but quite plain and unexciting."
"Pours a crystal clear pale gold colour with a big creamy white head the leaves some lacing. Picking up lots of sweet grain in the nose, as well as some grassy notes. The taste is a mixture of bready malt and noble hops; the sweet malt flavours assert themselves a little more and tend to dominate. The aftertaste is surprisingly crisp and clean. Light-bodied with a soft carbonation that lends a creamy mouthfeel. I found this to be a bit too sweet and lacking complexity, but not a bad beer overall."
"Feels light and crisp with soft carbonation. Leaves the mouth feeling lightly oiled between sips. Balanced and clean, this is a very easy drinking beer. I'd be happy to session on this if it were available on its own in Ontario instead of as part of 3-piece gift set."
"Easy drinker. Very good."
"Bought as part of a 3 bottle pack from the Control Board in Ontario. Pours a clear straw yellow with huge white head and some nice lacing. Smells of grassy hops with some grainy malts. Flavour has a mild bitterness, but some good sweetness. Very smooth mouthfeel. A really nice lager."
"Not really that good in my opinion. Nothing exciting in the flavor."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and smooth, but could definitely use more carbonation. This ties into the ""tightening up"" I mentioned earlier. It's very close to being great, but not quite there. I'd reccomend this to a German lager fan if you know it's fresh. It's a tasty beer that I would have again."
"A bit dead in the glass. Quenching and balanced, but no great shakes."
"All-in-all, a pretty good rendition of a sweetish, standard, refreshing Helles lager."
"D: This is a pleasant Helles lager, but it's a bit roughly grainy and slightly metallic. Still, this is a bright, perky brew that holds up pretty well and has a bit of character."
"It works great as a session beer and is the perfect substitute for the average macro-lagers."
"DA: Like I said, a tad boring and a little too sweet without enough complexity in the malt profile. It's still good though."
"The drink is light-medium in body with just the right amount of carbonation. Highly drinkable."
"Mouth of grains, cookies, some honey. Not complex, yet it's something about it that I really like, maybe the freshness and full body. Absolutely drinkable."
"D: This beer is mixed bag. Some of the elements are definitely well done, but the taste simply didn't have enough complexity to satisfy me."
"A very sessionable beer, but at $3 per bottle it won't qualify."
"Solid offering, and a good example of a german/bavarian lager"
"1081"
"overall straige across an average beer, drinkable but nothing to write home about."
"Picked this up at a local shop, the label says Neuschwansteiner Bavarian Lager, I went to their website to make sure this was the same beer and the labels matched so I'm sure that it is. Great appearance for this one, a light pale yellow with thin white head lots of lacing and an impressive carbonation. The steady upflow of bubbles kept me entertained for a long time. The aroma is faint and subtle slightly malty and a bit hoppy it had the common fragrance only toned down. Average mouthfeel. The taste is delivered nicely. Slightly malty and traces of hops with a grainy finish, this beer is extraordinarilly crisp and smooth. The mild flavor is quite enjoyable, great classic example for this style."
""
"I'm iffy on the style, but I can say for certain that the beer is mediocre and rather unimpressive. The lack of malt is irksome, as is the exceedingly light hops. Not one I'll get again."
"The taste is malty up front then becomes very wet like biting into a ripe fruit. Mild hop bitterness on the end. In the mouth it is thin and leaves a light touch on the tongue. Overall a very excellent Lager. Much more to it than the American Lagers I have tried."
"D-this would be very drinkable on tap or by the six pack but at 3.00 a bottle(1pt.0.9oz)I probably wont see this one again for a while"
"D: I could easily drink this all night. This a very drinkable beer, with great flavor and body. Very drinkable beer."
"Great beer and the swing-top gives the added bonus of reusable bottles for homebrew."
"It took a vigorous poor to produce the foamy, half inch thick, white head. Unfortunately it took longer to pour the straw colored beer then it did for the head to fade. Mildly sweet aroma of black tea and purple grapes. Neutral malt flavor and undertones of grapes in the flavor. The flavors just vanish in the finish. The body is on the light side of moderately full, and there is a bit of fine carbonation to add to the mouthfeel. It's a bit fruity for a lager, but that's my only complaint. Not that there is anything good to say about this beer either."
"I was not too impressed with this one... The appearance is rivaled by bud light, and there is almost more taste to a bud light also, Very little head that lasted a matter of seconds and subsided very quickly. The smell kind of reminds me of white grape juice."
"Full bodied. Slick on the tongue and palate. A decent beer overall. Not sure I would get this again, but I was pleased with this offering."
"The label looks a bit like made for American tourists visiting Germany (pardon my European view ...) ... the smell of ripe hops gives some promise, which unfortunately is not met by the content ... to me this tastes like a pretty bland Export and doesn't reflect any kind of ""350years family tradition"" (label PR) ... rather disappointing (for the price I paid for this) ..."
"Pours almost a clear straw gold - it's just slightly hazy. Nose is like slightly cooked grains. Flavor is slightly cereal sweet - just slightly. Even though this is a lager and lacks any huge punch in the flavor department, the flavor profile kicks ass. Just a nice smooth and even flavor. Feel is great. Nice and smooth with a good carbonation to it. Extremely drinkable. Sure it is a lager (hey...you know people don't have as much love for this style because it is not big and bodied), but it's pretty damn good."
""
"I enjoyed this more than the doppel. Usually this isn't my favorite style, but if aromatic enough, I'll go for it. This was extremely drinkable and I positively want more!"
"Drinkability: Great. Easily a quaffable beer that will get you through many a long nights. VERY refreshing Lager that renews my interest in different lagers"
"pours a bright golden with good clarity. half inch head dies almost immediatly. smells strongly of straw/cereal. taste is oddly nutty followed by a good crisp euro lager sweetness. light hopping with a touch of honey. crisp in the mouth and very refreshing. finishes a bit dry. very quenching. i dig."
"The drinkability as very good. Yes indeed I do enjoy a good Hellas and this one fits the bill just right, Prosit, MK"
"M&D: crisp-textured and refreshingly fizzy, the body is light but befitting for such a medium-flavoured malty lager. A quality product it is, but can be boring after more than half a pint, as happened to me (...but I guess it's simply because this is not one of my favourite beer style)."
""
"Poured a very clear golden color with a big head which faded quick and left some lace. Smells and tastes of grain, some honey and malt. Lots of carbonation. Highly drinkable due to the lightness of this brew. I'm just not impressed. I'm into big flavor, and this just doesn't cut it for me."
"Drinkability: While a bit unusual in its flavor profile, this beer is not that compelling to me"
"In my next bavarian trip, I might hunt this brewer out!"
"As mentioned, nice and creamy with just the right carbonation to avoid unwanted tangy sensations; The flavors are carried along in a gentle, lingering aftertaste that is pleasant and smooth."
"2 liter mock ceramic (glass, actually) swingtop siphon (""growler""), as ""Neuschwansteiner Das Echte", brewery filled, bought at Ole Simon, Sandnes, Norway. Pale golden colour, a faint haziness. Large to moderate head. Pleasant aroma of aromatic hops. Flavour is a typical standard helles: moderate malts, moderate hops, grainy notes, easy drinking, nothing unpleasant but nothing really remarkable either. Nice enough, but the siphon was more impressive than the beer."
"This is a pretty interesting beer, I don't know how it is for the style but its pretty drinkable stuff, not perfect but better than it looks."
"D: The strength of this brew -- very drinkable, not overly carbonated, pretty refreshing."
"Swing top bottle pours a slightly hazy golden with a fluffy white head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Bready malty aroma, cracker, honey and lemon flavors, light bodied with a thin and kind of watery mouthfeel. Finishes dry with some bitterness, very refreshing and drinkable."
"Neuschwansteiner Bavarian Lager comes impressively packaged. I like the swing-top and the beautiful label depicting facing swans in the foreground and Neuschwanstein Castle in the background. What's inside the bottle, however, leaves something to be desired. While I can't imagine a beer of this style ever flooring me, I think I have the right to expect one that won't bore me to tears."
"Taste is sweet, light, then a bit of sour but still manages a rather clean finish. goes down a bit watery. Not a beer I'll seek out again."
"The taste is pretty standard lager, though a bit watered down in my opinion. ABV % is low, and a non-factor, making this a really easy to drink brew. Carbonation is mild and lingers slightly on the pallette, but nothing too strong. Drinkability is high, as this is an easy to knock back brew. Unfortunately there's nothing too impressive going on here."
"Pours a clear, straw gold body beneath a 1/4"" head of bright white foam that holds well and leaves rings of craggy lace about the glass. The nose is clean and distinctly malty with just a suggestion of hops in the background. The mouth is medium bodied and crisp. Its wide, bready maltiness dominates the flavor (with some Munich malts); laced with some spicy, floral, and herbal hops; and balanced by a sturdy bitterness. It finishes drying with a residual touch of maltiness and some spicy hops. Very well done!"
"Pours a clear medium gold with a 1 1/2 finger head that had OK retension. Aroma of a nice pils malt with some honey and citrus notes. Taste is of a light pils. More malt than hops. Sweet honey really comes through. Light on the hops side but still noticeable. Medium carbonation. Crisp and refreshing. Very light and drinkable. A good lawnmower beer."
"BB 22-12-05. White head not that lasting, brightgolden beer. Nose is green, for helles very citrussy and good maltarome.fresh nose alltogether without offflavours. Taste is malts, litle alcohol and spicy, mostly a play between hops and malt giving you a peppery taste. Aftertaste shows good and heavy bitterness. This makes it enjoyable and IMO very drinkable."
"Drinkability: It might be a bit too sweet to be a session brew, but I liked it overall. It goes down smoothly and very quickly if you arent careful. If I felt the need, I could quaff this beer to no end. It comes in, gives a good impression, and leaves with little aftertaste."
"A very fuzzy, pale golden color with a nice off-white head. A very good dry taste upfront, but with a very light follow through. I was expecting a little more, but can't complain too much."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"This beer pours a tired pale gold color with a limp head and some average lacing. The aroma is of grainy malts and some subtle noble hops. The taste is quite yeasty with a bready malt character. Hops are low key and definitely defer to the malt flavor. There's a slight chalky fruitiness it the flavor, perhaps a yeast attribute. The mouthfeel is very delicate and light. This beer as a very approachable and likable Helles. Not rich and intense but light and refreshing."
"The malts are grainy, buttery and cereal like and provide notes of pear, banana and other various fruits. The hops are fairly well pronounced, flowery and grassy. Just a clean, nice tasting Helles."
"Pours a one-finger white head that fades slowly and leaves a little lace. Light carbonation, light to medium bodied. Color is a clear yellow, not cloudy even though the yeasty overtones would suggest otherwise. Starts yeasty and sweet, finishes smooth. $2.95 for a 500ml bottle at Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"A very drinkable lager, with neither outrageous pesonality nor any major drawbacks. The lack of real distinction to the positive or negative rendered this an average beer with intangibles raising its rating rather than detracting. Worth quaffing yourself."
"An interesting lager, but not distinctive. The maltiness seems to have a macro essence, and the euroskunk sulfur component is a turnoff. Still, a well rounded Helles lager that is worth a try."
"I had to get the baled bottle, and the bottle art drew me to it. The beer pours a clear bright gold with little carbonation. It had a small white lace that clung to the glass to the end. It has a sharp malt and citric aroma. The flavors are intriguing and changed throughout the glass. Initially it was a mixture of Orange and Malt. In the end the malt won out and there was a taste of hops in the finish. The beer had a very pleasant malt aftertaste. The feel was oily and deceptevly heavy, it is very filling. A very interesting find and one I'll have to return to."
"The beer pours a golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light, dry pale malt scent with a lager yeast finish. It has a bit of malt sweetness in there as well. The taste is decent also. It has a light pale malt feel to it, with a slightly sweet, yet dry lager yeast finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine Bavarian lager. It's not my favorite style, but this one stands out."
"Say that name 5 times fast. Yikes. I do like the bottle presentation though, don't see much of these around now-a-days, so let's hope that the beer is as good as the bottle looks. Poured out a light gold/honey color with some carbonation visible, but that not that much. I was hoping for a little bit more actually. Smell consisted of malts, honey (which was very noticable), and some hops that blend in with some floral aromas. Taste was a little one sided I thought. Sweet malts long aride the palate for a while which gives into some hops undertones, but then the honey part takes over towards the middle and lasts into the aftertaste. I didn't like this because the malts are sweet already, the honey just makes it sweeter. It also felt a little watery in the aftertaste. I know this is a Helles, but the honey was a little bit too much. If they had some more hop bite to blend in, then that would make this brew great. But do try this beer at least once. Just needs some balancing."
"Drinkability & Notes: Wow, quite impressive. You really dont come by lagers like this too often. Paired well with some mild Munster cheese and country ham."
"This brew is a dark golden color with mild effervescence and a thin white head. Very little lacing. The aroma is fruity and lightly hoppy. Light-bodied and on the sweet side for the most part, with malt, fruit and hay flavors. The finish is rather weak but has some flavor to it. Pretty low on the Helles food chain but not terrible."
"Pours a clear pale gold under a one finger off-white head that settles quickly and leaves just a hint of lace. The nose is nice - full of fresh barley. The mouth is medium carbonated and medium bodied. There's a nice smooth barley malt taste, must like a Helles should have. There is very little hops here, though; just smooth malt. I detected no finish, per se, and only the mildest hint of bitterness in the aftertaste. This is not a great beer, but it is certainly perfectly good for drinking."
"Tralucent dark straw. Thin, soapy porcelain head manages loose, tattered lace. Soft, grainy malt with hints of husk in aroma. Mellow, doughy underbaked bread. Sharp, grassy hop. Clean and tame aromawise. Bready pilsner malt sweetness upfront is quickly overrun by assertive, but rounded hop bitterness. Little noteable malt character, save a parching, brittle cracker tone. Mild grassy hop flavor with a lemony citric twang. Trace sulfur lends a mild savory, vegetal note. Very well attenuated and brisk in mouthfeel, but only a notch above thin. Quite thirst quenching. Finishes bone dry with quickly fading notes of fresh, sweet grass. A refreshing brew more like a uninspired German Pils than a Helles in overall character. Simple overall and quite lanky in malt backbone. Innocuous and very drinkable, just not terribly exciting."
"Very smooth, highly carbonated and a light body. Easy to drink and low in ABV, I could go through quite a few if it cost less."
"The smell is a bit yeasty with hints of citrus and maybe something tarte? The taste is actually more than one dimensional. Soft and delicate in the beginning with a nice touch of bitterness in the end. Very clean and crisp. I pick up something a metallic. Not overpowering in anyway. I do believe this is my first stab at this style? Maybe not, I don't really know."
"Zum wohl!"
"It pours a dull brassy golden color with a pure white head that fades to a thin-rimmed coating. The mild aroma is of a distant bread shop and light hops. A slight caramel sweetness and very herbal flavor makes for a light bodied but flavorful malt. The hops provide a mild lemon and lime bitterness, and a slightly metallic bite. This is a highly drinkable Bavarian Lager - a perfect companion to beans and franks with German potato salad."
"Drinkability  Sorry I couldnt be more constructive here, but this was a real disappointment."
"A pretty drinkable beer overall but not great."
"Very pale yellow in color, not much of an aroma. Since I'd been in Germany for over a week, I've got to say that this is not the best lager I've had in the last two weeks. It's just not as crisp and clean tasting as some of the others available. I gave it a 3.5 for drinkability, because it is pretty harmless tasting, just not that mind-blowing a pilsner."
"Comes in a beautiful bottle. The color is a golden yellow and clear. The head that develops into a fine line of glass hugging very tight lace, and stays. Constant carbonation, easily seen and tasted. The smell is light, nothing overly spectacular. The flavor leans towards apples, a very good easy flavor. The flavor sticks with you without leaving that film in the mouth, you know the one that I am talking about. This thing is worth buying if you get the chance. Thank god for Xmas or I never would have gotten it."
"Nice bottle.  Also expensive (for what it is).  At first a musty smell eminates as I pour the beer.  Faint yellow and clean looking, the smell subsided and a sweeter smell evolved.  Pretty much a solid brew.  Crisp and clean, faint grain and light malt flavors are upfront.  This is a very drinkable brew and you could put back a few if you had enough money.  I paid 2.99 for a 16 ounce bottle.  Not crazy, but not the best buy for your money."
"New import. Accidentally got 2 bottles since they had slightly different labels and I didn't look close enough to see they were the same. Don't know which one was fresher either. Both seemed slightly off. Quite expensive and turned out to be pretty run-of-the-mill. Clear golden yellow, good vibrant head, vague stale skunky aroma. A couple dark flecks of what looked like dead insect in one of the bottles. What the heck is that? The other one, which has a freshness date of 25.11.2002, was a bit skunkier. All in all, not much character, a standard Bavarian lager, smooth & rounded but lacking in taste - not unpleasant though. Slightly creamy, very bubbly. I'm sure this has been damaged by time and travel; surprising since this was a new arrival at the store. One bottle had noticeably less beer than the other before opening. Some very good qualities but just very little flavor. The Der Hirschbrau line of beers is brewed by Privatbrauerei Hoss. 4.7% abv."
"This is a great Helles lager. Light malt sweetness balanced light hop character. Nice head but disapates quickly. Very drinkable with a clean finish."
