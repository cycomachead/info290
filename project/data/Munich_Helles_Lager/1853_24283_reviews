"was looking for the 360 top can. couldn't find it but regardless found the beer. pours light yellow finger of pillowy head. smell is subtle yeast. and hops. sweet at first then the hoppy bite but not bitter. very clean and crisp. would buy again although the carbonation was very high and caused painful burps haha."

"A bit too sweet for my tastes."

"not good, dont liek at all"
"In lieu of putting their own spin on this beer, it's clear the brewer wanted to stay true to the style and they absolutely nailed it.  Why there aren't more American versions of Helles is beyond me.  This is not only an outstanding version of the style, but for $7.89 / six-pack it is also a great value.  Recommended to anyone looking for a clean lager with some character."
"Golden / bronze body. Clear with a small white cap. Aromas of pils malt, a hint of sweet, fruity notes. Grain and bread with distant floral notes and a clean feel. Easy to drink. Not too sweet. Light Saaz hop character. Solid."

"I had two of these over dinner the other night and they were so-so. That said I'd like to try it outside of the can."

"For those that get a chance, please try the new 360 top and drink it right from the can. That invention is fantastic as you really get the full effect of the nose with the entire lid off, but the convenience of a can! These are the PERFECT summer beer for whatever reason, beach, lawn, porch, whatever. Love them."
"This is a medium bodied brew with s modest amount of carbonation. It is crisp and easy drinking. It plays the part of the style well. If this was a style I got thirsty for, id reach for it again."

"O: Definitely showcases the German malts nicely, but at the expense of any noticeable contribution from the Czech pilsen hops."

"This golden lager is very light and easy to drink. I enjoy this beer very much. The German pips malt really stands out in the taste. And the hallertauer hops are the perfect choice to put a hint of bitterness in the after taste. I would recommend this beer for a tailgate or on the beach."

"O: For an American brewery, it's hard to do a better helles lager. Very sessionable great drinkability."

"330ml can. Footed flute glass @ Freiburg (LÂ´Hospitalet-Barcelona). Pale gold color, clear appearance.. White froth, close crown & fairly good retention. Spicy, floral, yeasty & grassy aromas. Malty & crisp upfront rounded by hints of apple & pear on the back. Light body. Moderate but lively carbonation. Pale malty texture & spicy touch. Clean bitterness arises in the middle & lingers into a bitter/sweet finish. Dried aftertaste. Easy to drink !!"

"Served in the soup top can. A delightful fruty and grassy aroma greets the nose as you open this beer its a delightful golden hue with a hint of amber. Taste is grass fruity hops and a hint of doughy malt on the back a little thin on mouthfeel but very refreshing. All in all my favorite session lager."
"Friendly. A lively tonic with bright and favorable aspects. Just what the doctor ordered."

"Very very very light and smooth beer. Very easy to drink, to drink fast, and to drink allot of. Slight slight bit of hops, no bitterness, light carbonation. Easy to drink, easy on the wallet, great with a burger and truffle fries. Looks like a standard lager, smells nice, good crisp clean mouthfeel, would definitely order again."

"This is a really good beer for the style and quite enjoyable."

"O- Overall, a good beer for a hot day. I wouldn't buy it all the time, but it is a nice change of pace from IPAs and Pale Ales."

"Nifty can. Light, sessionable and refreshing."

"Golden-straw color, clear, with a thin layer of bubbles on top. Plastic cup, so no real lacing going on. Aroma was pretty ""lagery," sweet with bready malts, almost doughy, and some light floral hops. Taste of cereal grains, sweet, more of the bready malts from the aroma, light floral hops. A pretty basic lager. A bit bland and dull, no real crispness to it. Light body. I guess it was okay, if you like lagers, but I wasn't really digging it, and I wouldn't even call it a lawnmower beer. But it was a free sample, so I couldn't turn it down."

"Mouthfeel is light, crisp and lemony, with high fizzy carbonation, a light body and a finish that's tart yet almost clean. An easy drinking beer that was alright, but not one I got excited about."

"O - This was very easy to drink...I think I have found a German style that I like...a nice balance throughout and a nice finish"

"Transparent golden yellow with a thick creamy white head. The nose is lightly toasted grain with a touch of dough malt balanced by a fairly assertive citric hop in the back with a grassy, earthy grain lingering in the back. The flavor has a more assertive grain flavor, light notes of dough with a strong citric bitterness. There is a lightly floral and grassy hop note accompanied by some tangy rye like grain in the finish. Really light, fluffy, and creamy feel with a medium syrupy body and crisp assertive carbonation. The beer is balanced and smooth, light and crisp. Nice stuff, stronger on the grain side than I love but still very enjoyable."

"They excel at German styles here at Sly Fox and this was no different. This was just a crisp, flavorful, and most of all EXREMELY drinkable take on the style, with my only complaint being that this was maybe a bit too dry and spicy in the finish. Other than that though, this was had a tremendous quaffable nature to it. Good stuff!"
"This is a crisp lager. It doesnt try to be more than it should, its exactly what a lager should taste like. Pours golden with a light head which quickly disperses. Smells of a nice mix of malts and hops. Very smooth drinker and easily could be described as a session beer."
"D- I liked it."
"This beer started out nicely. The appearance was a wonderful clear golden color every bubble being clearly expressed. But as it warmed slightly things seem to fall apart. What were generous toasted malts in the nose became sort of sweet cereal without being interesting. The taste was cloying with none of the charm of a great helles. I probably wouldn't order this again."
"D -= A good example of the style, a nice quaffable helles, but could use more malt in the tast IMO, like the clean drinkable aspects a lot, I could drink many of these in a session"
"D - Very crisp, clean and easy to drink. True to style Helles Lager. One of my favorites from Sly Fox and the true definition of a session beer. I could drink this all afternoon."
"Don't drink and review."
"D: This is how a Helles should be crisp and easy to drink summer or winter. Great session."
"This is a simple, to the point take on the style. It's not my favourite style in the world so I'd be apt to grab something else off of the beer list, but I enjoyed this one nonetheless which to me is a testament to a job well done by the brewer. If you like the style, you'll really dig this one, and even if you don't you should enjoy it as well."
"Overall a good and quaffable lager. I would have liked to have seen more of a hop flavor to match the aroma."
"Crystal clear gold with a fine, white head. Great retention and lacing. Clean malt aroma with plenty of floral hops - maybe just a bit of citrus as well. Light to moderate bitterness with a bit of malt. Slightly grainy character, almost like barley straight from the bag on brewing day. Sweet finish. Light body with crisp carbonation. Off-dry. This is a highly drinkable, top notch helles, especially for a brewpub. The brewer really knows his stuff."
"Finger licking good."
