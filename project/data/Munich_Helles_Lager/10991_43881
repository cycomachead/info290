The nose and taste are dominated by sweet malt, but there's a considerable dryness to the finish. Flavors are muted here, but you'll smell and taste bread and caramel. The mouthfeel is thin and carbonation is relatively low. Overall, this is a step up from the macro lagers, but at $8.49-$8.99 for a six pack, it just doesn't have much to make it stand out from the others beers in that price range. While I didn't dislike this, I won't be buying this one again. Next time I'm looking for an Ohio beer I'll be sure to stick to Great Lakes, Thirsty Dog, or Columbus Brewing Company.","DeFaz","Beers"

There is noticeable carbonation rising within the glass. There was a small white head, but is disappeared very quickly.Virtually no lacing to speak of. It has an average citrus hop aroma. It's pleasant, but unremarkable. It has a typical malty flavor; it's a bit bready and a bit buttery. There is a hop presence, but it is very small. It has a medium body and very little mouth coating. You can really feel the carbonation bubbles. To me, it feels sharp on my tongue. I don't like it all that much, I prefer a smoother lager. The beer is pretty middle-of-the-road when it comes to drinkablity. It goes down all right, but with every sip, I kind of wish I had opened a different bottle. There's nothing wrong with this beer, it's a perfectly well made craft brew, but it's average for the field.

3.31,-4.6,4,3,3,3.5,4,"Very pale amber in color and a nice two finer head that sticks a bit. One column of bubbling. Very light tasted malt and some faint banana notes from the yeast. A little off-putting for a Munich Helles. But some grassy hops. Crisp yet yeasty fruit taste to this helles. Some toasted water crackers for malt, herbal, grassy hops, and some banana and bubblegum yeast. crisp,but a little too yeasty for my taste in a helles.","scruffwhor","Oct 01, 2008"
3.23,-6.9,3.5,3,3,3,4,"This was the first 'legal' beer I had two years ago with an excellent steak dinner at the Precinct in Cincinnati. This week I tried another bottle at the Southgate House and decided it needed another review. This beer basically tastes like a slightly more flavorful BMC. It is a bit more golden than the others with only a little more taste and smell. The big advantage this has over the big guys is that it's local which raises it a couple notches in my book. While nothing special, I would recommend at least trying it when in the Cincinnati area if for nothing else than to support the local brewery.","ltjska04","Sep 21, 2008"
2.7,-22.2,3,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Pours gold in color with whatever head there is disappearing before I can walk away from the counter. Smell is malty, but not a very good malt. Not a lot of hops or spice in this at all. Very malty, highly carbonated. Tastes very BMC'ish. A little puckering, bittering in the end, but I'm not sure that's from any semblance of hopping. A little bit of a letdown from Moerlein.","FtownThrowDown","Aug 15, 2008"

4.08,17.6,4,3.5,4,4,5,"D: Tasty enough and very sessionable. Wouldn't mind knocking a few more of these back after a long day in the sun. Their website lists this as 5.2% ABV","pwoods","Beers"
3.68,6.1,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Body is medium with delicate carbonation. Finish is close to dry. This is an easy drinking beer that I do enjoy. I can definitely see myself picking this one up again when in the mood for malt rather than hops.","becktone","0"
