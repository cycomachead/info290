"Overall:  satisfying beer with a nice body."

"O-Top quality German lager...haven't seen this is my neck of the woods in ages and jumped at it even at 11 something a sixer...."
""

"A prime example of the style"

"500ml bottle. 09/14. Pours a pale gold colour with a frothy white head, which lasted well and left a suggestion of lacing. Gentle aroma of sweet malt and straw. Medium sweetness with a delicate, spicy, bitter finish. Medium body and a very smooth mouthfeel. Goes down very easily."

"Overall: Decent Munich Helles here but there are others in the style I would go to first. Good easy summer drinker worth a shot if you can pick up a single in a mix six."
""
""
""
""
"O - If the bottle didn't say ""helles"" I'd have sworn it was a slightly stronger version of a pilsner. Good body, but little taste. It's not bad at all- just doesn't live up to what I expect from something called helles."
""
"Those who feverishly tick as part of the one-and-done club may easily fail to appreciate the greatness of this brew. My opinion of this beer, as with so many, has evolved with each serving. To my mind, this one gets it right as a wonderful compromise between flavor and body. The grassy and herbal hop presence is undeniable yet not to the point of histrionics, while the malts provide firm nutritional and textural support and even approach oktoberfest levels yet without the likelihood of Maillard fatigue. Maybe a little more aromatics would be nice, at least as a first impression booster, but in the end they would be irrelevant and possibly even an unwelcome distraction. I will be rushing out soon to find another fresh 6 or 12-pack."

"Classic lager.  Crisp, flavorful, and pleasantly refreshing.  A very basic lager, this is truly the best of the Munich Oktoberfest six.  Very similar to Hofbrau and a little lighter in taste than a Paulaner.  Years of perfection have made this brew one of the best!"

"Poured a clear, medium-light gold. A fizzy head forms and most of it dissipates quickly, leaving only a little bit of lacing. The aroma is like sourdough bread with a little bit of noble hops. The flavor is more robust malty, bready, with some nice bitterness on the finish. It has a thinner body but a nice crisp finish. Probably a reason they've brewed this for a while."

"Good malt character, which is most important for the style. Nicely balanced."

"O: Probably damn good fresh. Will have to try it again at some point."

"O-A simple beer, but very well made. One of the better exports I've had."

"A beautiful, sweet-malty helles with a full body, and the taste never fades.  Rated to style."
"O: This beer has nice malty flavors that taste true to the style but seems like it could use a little more hops to balance things out."
""
""
""

"Nothing too exciting, and no distinct flavors stand out but very decent overall."
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Very drinkable albeit mild. Like all Helles, finely tuned to be drank in mass quantity with food, but otherwise nothing special. Went well with pizza and salad tonight, but I think I would tire of it by itself it I had it without food. Admittedly, I wonder if this beer would be more notable in flavor if it was before the best by date, but it's not that far gone so hard to say."

"My mark out of one hundred would be 87."
""
"Fixed brats and sauerkraut with very high hopes. Had one taste and switched out for a Fuller's. The Munich Gold bland all the way around. The appearance was not deep enough, very little smell to discern, and mouthfeel watery. Perhaps an old keg? Or perhaps too light for the dinner pairing. Will try a heavier German beer for pairing with this meal next time."
""
" The flavor has a nice gentle taste of pilsner malt with a light nutty quality and low bitterness in the taste with generally clean yeast tastte with mild diacetyl in the middle with grain and malt dominant with some mineral accents. Overall this is a quaffable lager with a nice drinkable quality I would buy this again pretty decent example of the style."

"Overall - Nice, more enjoyable than many lagers, but was not as good as the first time I had it. Wondering if the metal can had any impact on my drinking experiences. Another beer to be revisited,"
"Overall: Comes across as thoughtful and carefully crafted, even if it's designed to be a less-than-complex crowd pleaser. Perhaps a bit more light and sweet than is typical for the style, but altogether pleasant. I wouldn't mind another!"

"Taste is well-balanced and classic for the style. Grainy with cardboard notes and delicate bitter finish. Moderate carbonation and medium body. Definitely, a good beer."

"O: Good palate cleasner, refreshing and a good alternative to Augustiner."
"Overall - It starts off promising enough, but trails off quickly in the finish. It's a good Helles, but just not enough for me to consider it great, much less one of the top examples of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The best thing I can compare this to is a pilsner with an emphasis on balance. Same charms, but less hop-oriented and more well-rounded. A surprisingly delicious lager."
""
""
"O- a classic battle between hops and malt. i'm glad neither came out too dominant; this is really a beer to behold."
"It's a simple and good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this is a good helles, has good clean flavors with good feel."
""
""
"This beer has the flavor I taste on my mind's tongue when I reminisce about travels through Germany."

"It pours a light yellow straw color with a thick white foamy head. Smells slightly skunky with lemon and grass followed by some bready malt. Has a good flavor, better than most Euro lagers, with some funk, grass and lemon. Feels nice and refreshing with moderate carbonation and a dry finish. This beer is solid and I could drink way more, wish i had some,"
""
""
""
"Clear gold, large diminishing fizzy white head. Smells sweet - honey and plastic, like many Canadian shitty lagers. Taste is simple, and honey-sweet, but floral and grassy with no crappy adjunct flavours - pretty nice, really. Light, mildly syrupy body, decent carbonation and a quick finish - very summery and drinkable."
""
""
""
"OVERALL: An authentic helles lager from a respected German brewery. Agreeable flavor and light feel, perfect for drinking alone or pairing with a wide array of foods."

"Overall a great German beer with a smooth body and nice flavors pretty much on par for the style."
"A good example of how lagers can be a great style with a big body and quite bold flavour. This beer is refreshing and quite drinkable. Quite well done, worth a try. 4"

"Prost"
"I grabbed all of the Munich lagers I could find locally, which only amounted to this one, Spaten's and Lowenbrau - enough for a small comparative ranking. I really do like this beer and am bumping the score considerably to reflect that. It's not spectacular or attention-grabbing in any way - just a solidly-brewed, reliable all-malt German lager. In a pinch I might take Spaten over this (it's slightly cheaper) but from a realistic perspective, they're both great and well worth returning to."
""
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink, refreshing, and quite sessionable."
"From a variety pack. 11.2 oz bottle labeled Munich Gold, gotta be the same thing though. Pours very pale yellow, almost like an American lager but with a more substantial and lingering head. Reminds of the more ""mainstream"" European lagers, such as Harp. A fresh smell that I can't quite place me. The taste reminds me of a Czech lager, nothing to any extreme but all very crispy and clean. Although I can only seem to compare this to other beers, it is still able to carve a niche as a solid beer on its own, albeit not outstanding in most respects."

"Poured into a pokal a clear medium golden with a great blooming white head that settled slowly leaving two rings of broken lace behind,to me this is what golden lager should look like with great color and a large blooming head.Toasted bread and honey malts in the nose along with some mineral,flavors have a vanilla tinge to them with mild toastiness and more honey infused mils sweetness in the aftertaste.This is a damn well made helles lager,I wish I could get that Anno 1417 keller beer around here!"
"Overall â€“ Not a bad beer. Very easy to drink with some sweet and some more crisp characteristics. A good session brew."
""
""
""

"This beer pours out a straw golden colour, with a nice, thick, two finger head. Smells strongly of malted barley, a bit of hops, and fresh baked bread. Tastes light and sweet. Lots of breads and grains throughout, with a clean, slightly bitter finish. Medium bodied. A bit smooth. A very drinkable lager."
"Pours a crystal clear gold with a 1 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, grass, and some slight fruity aromas. Taste is of grain and grassy flavors up front with a slight sweet fruit flavor on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good lager but nothing that really stands out to me."

"O: Worthy of respect but nothing to get excited about."
""
"O/D - A weak effort for a bavarian lager. I was expecting a quality helles and i got a run of the mill lager. Not worth revisiting. Drinkable and barely passable"
"O: A decent lager, but it does not excite. It could use more hops and bitterness and a bit more crispness. It does look great and it is clean and drinkable."

"Pale clear golden colour, one finger of white head, some lace at the top of the glass. Smell is malt and biscuity, bready notes, sweet floral scents, mild grassy hop presence. Taste is full of biscuity malt, semi sweet notes, grassy and floral flavours present throughout, lightly hoppy with mild bitterness. Medium carbonation, medium body, creamy and delicate, nice feel. Fairly good, wont reach for this too often but its fairly clean and drinkable."
"O- Easy drinking. Not particularly distinct, but its score gets bumped up for how drinkable it is."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with decent flavours and aromas."
"Overall (3.5): suits the style and does it well. Malts in the smell but is balanced by hoppy and malty flavor. A typical lager, no defining characteristics except the thin film of white head."
"Overall, this is a highly drinkable pale lager with good flavours, and no real flaws."
"All in all, a good beer, but a forgettable beer. It lacks character."
"Nothing special to look at, but a decent pale lager nonetheless. Poured with a smallish white head that soon settled down to just a bit and no lace. Color is a clear, yellow gold with perfect bubble trails up the center. Aroma reminds me of German pilsner, malt, grass, grain, hop. Flavor's not as hoppy. Clean, balanced, with tang to balance the sweetness of the malt and just a bit of hop bitterness to round things out. Body is good and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor and short to medium long. Session beer."
"Extremely clean and complex malt flavors make this a great representation of a Munich Helles-which are pretty damn hard to find. But really, from Hacker-Pschorr, would you expect anything less? Good stuff."
"This bottle may be past its prime. I recall Hacker-Pschorr being better in recent memory."
"Gold in color with a nice appearance, Has a nice hoppy bite, very drinkable. Smell is average, but better than most euro beers. Not a bad beer, has a nice mouthfeel and an over all ok taste.We agree this is a good beer to have once or twice.. Could be fridge worth. We still like the home team."
"Out of the bottle, this brew poured a dark yellow-golden color color with a virginal-white thin cap of foam. The aroma is a sweet bread malty affair. The flavor is par for the course. The grain coats the mouth, somewhere a fruity ghost hovers. The beer exits with just a hint of sulfur on the palate. Could be a little cleaner, but not a bad beer."
"O: Light, fairly refreshing, but not all that clean. Not a bad drink though."
"Notes: well crafted German Lager, doesn't really stand out of the pack. At 5.5% abv not really a sessioner. Nothing wrong with this beer at all, easy to drink but I prefer several other Helles from Munich more."
"A good and rare lager that destroys the common macrobrews."
"From the 330 ml. bottle stamped 06/11-L15601Y. Sampled on August 20, 2011. The pour is straw yellow with golden hues and a nice enough lingering head. The aroma is bold with German malts with a more subtle biscuit and buttery note. The body is pretty creamy and about medium. The taste is very traditionally German with big malts, sugar sweetness, mildly grainy, and smoothly bitter. It fits in well on a hot summer day."
"O - This is a nice Munich Helles Lager. Not my favorite style, but I love trying beers from Germany,"
"O - Super average, nothing I wouldn't have again, but certainly nothing to go looking for either"
"Color is golden, very clear with a nice white head that disappear quickly. The aroma presents some wheat notes and malts. Timid aroma. Very light. On the taste, it is floral with a very light bitterness. This taste like a typical german lager. Fresh. Dry. Easy drinking beer. Refreshing. Watery. Light body with some carbonation. Nice but nothing more."
"Overall: A decent, easy-drinking Munich helles."
"Overall a tasty pils. Would have it again for sure."
"Nice German beer."
"On draft at the axe. Pours a very pale golden color with a small white head. Light malt aromas. Taste jumps out a bit more and has a great flavor. Decent German malts come through. Light sweetness to it. A good clean and slightly bitter finish. Very drinkable."
"O: This is yet another excellent beer from Germany and easily one of the best lagers I have had, if not the best."
"Drinkability: For the price and flavour point one of my standby session beers. It's not challenging or exciting but easy to drink, refreshing and tastes good. Takes me back to Germany so sentimental value is good too!"
"The lager pours out as a golden colored liquid with a fluffy white head on it that doesn't last very long. The lacing isn't really there either. The smell of the beer gives off the normal aromas of a lager, some grass, some wood, little bit of hops. The taste of this beer is average in my opinion, it has some bitterness to it and not a whole lot else. Mouthfeel was lighter bodied and fairl easy to drink. Overall, I wouldn't seek this one out again."
"O - expected little but was surprised - drank it at the right time - long day at work and hot - perfect time for a cold lager - reminiscent of the lager my dad drank when I first got into beer"
"Overall, Munich Gold is a solid German lager that has an even balance to it. I'd rather have one of these than the typical German pilsener; I believe this has a better taste & nose to it. A nice beer that goes good during any time of year."
"This beer is refreshing and goes down easy, but does not present anything memorable or notable."
"Nice beer. This style seems to be one of german pils ""light"". Quality ingredients though. I like it."
"D: everything was good up until the taste. something seems off here. too much metal."
"D: A solid Helles and excellent summer beer. Not a stand-out, but very refreshing and easy-drinking."
"Pure golden color with a lacy head. Toasted nut, bread dough, and clay aromas follow through on a round, supple entry to a dryish medium body with lemon soufflÃ© note. Finishes with a crisp, lingering well integrated fade. A pretty good helles. I would certainly drink it again."
"O: This really takes me back to Germany! Well done."
"Fairly typical Euro lager, but its dry and refreshing qualities will get me to try it again."
"Drinkability is OK. Nothing wrong with this beer, but it is a bit boring."
"Mouthfeel is light, crisp and clean making for a very refreshing lager. Beers like this remind me why I enjoy the various lager styles so much. Simple and straightforward but with a delicious refreshing taste."
"Mouthfeel is very easy going. The pinch from the hops is great on the tongue and is supported by a great sizzle of carbonation. Munich gold is a great easy drinking beer. You can really taste what american macro lagers are trying to do but fail at. Awesome brew and totally worth buying when you see it."
"I only wish our big name beers were brewed like the Germans brew theirs"
"Would buy it again."
"Drink - I really wasn't a big fan of this beer.. I found myself wishing I had bought something else instead."
"Pours typical yellow with a white head. Poor retention and minimal lacing. Great thin and sharp mouthfeel with advanced biting carbonation and a crisp refreshing finish."
"Overall Hacker-Pschorr Munchner Gold is a good beer that meets the requirements of the style. Recommended."
"Not a bad lager. The appearance and smell are nice, but the taste feels just a hint watery. The malts are very pleasant."
"D: Very run-of-the-mill Helles Lager. Nothing special but drinkable nonetheless."
"D - very drinkable."
"Note: i finished the whole 6 pack over a few days and had this exact impression every single time. Also kind of shocked to see that i have the LOWEST review of this beer. Maybe i got a bad 6pack?"
"Drinkable, interesting enough to be engaging."
"Overall this is a very impressive beer, not overly thick and sweet at the same time, which makes it drinkable in most circumstances. Would highly recommend."
"this beer pours a golden color with not much head>>>>it smells like a decent lager beer>>>>taste is ever so slightly bitter and slightly sweet>>>>feel a little watered down but still with good taste>>>>pretty drinkable prob. couldn't drink more than like 3 of these in a row>>>>just an average beer>>>not a bad session beer"
"D- This beer slides with no after taste at all. A great beer to have with dinner. This a very good Helles."
"Pours a clean, pale yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, saaz hops and a sweet biscuit maltiness. In the taste, sweet malt, small saaz hops, and a nice mixture of biscuit and earth. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry earthy hop in the aftertaste. Nice lager with a good balance of hop and malt."
"A wonderful hell. Appearance is a light golden. The smell and taste of bready malts. Not a strong hop flavor. Mouthfeel and drinkability are great. I really like this from Hacker Pschorr. A great example of this style with a bready flavor and low on hops."
"D - A fine example of a Helles"
"D- Could use a bit more kick but isn't lacking. Pretty good though. My favorite Hacker-Pschorr offering that's available to me. One of the best examples of grains and bready malt that I've encountered so far."
"A little bit different than many other German lagers, and certainly a drinkable one."
"D - Good stuff. Much better than your average Lager."
"D - a very classic sessionable lager, is definitely a ""purity law"" compliant brew with a little more dry, which I enjoy"
"I got a finger of bone-white head with decent retention. Color was a slightly hazy deep gold. Nose had the characteristic lager sweetness, unencumbered by adjuncts. It was heavenly in the face of all of the AALs I have been subjected to of late. Mouthfeel was medium with a grassy hop bite on the tongue. Finish was semi-dry with a little bit of lingering lager sweetness. Not bad, but here in Lancaster County, where lagers are a way of life, why go for an import? I'd stick with Stoudt's Gold, instead."
"D- lighter in body and flavor than other popular german brewer's versions of this style, but still with a great nose. would appeal to typical american palates more than something a little higher in hops. like when a huge labatt blue fan says ""oh hey, that somethinschlager, or that whositsteiner, now that's a damn good beer!"" and i like it too."
"Pours brilliant gold with a large cap of fluffy white head. Decent retention and no lacing. Grainy, doughy aroma with light Euro hops. Tastes much the same, bready and slightly sweet with very light hop bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied and finely carbonated with a soft, round mouthfeel. Balanced, simple, and clean. Refreshing and easy drinking."
"The beer pours clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is wheat with some grape notes. The flavor is wheaty, grassy hops and earthy hops. I don't get too much fruit in the flavor after getting the grapes in the aroma. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Dry crackery pilsner malt, some hint of apple from the yeast. Very clean and straightforward, crisp and snappy feel. Slight astringent bite. Quenching warm weather session beer. Simple and straightforward."
"Poured from a brown 335 ml bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell has a good bit of sweetness to it. Taste is crisp, a bit sweet, some malts. Feels light in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this makes for a good quality beer."
"Overall, pretty decent. Quite drinkable, and an excellent summertime brew. This was terrific around the grill. Enough character to make you want more, but mediocre enough where you can easily substitute another brew for this one. Worth a try. overall quality is good."
"Overall a classic German lager, what more could you really asks for."
"a decent helles, certainly not the best I've had. has a golden color, very malty taste and is a bit heavy on the mouth feel. Not much at all in terms of hops, and the malt is a bit smokier and upfront than most helles. Pretty drinkable, but not that crisp in the finish due to the lack of hops"
"Nice full bodied mouthfeel and very refreshing. One of the best lagers I've had in recent memory."
"Why doesn't mass produced beer from the new world taste like this?"
"D - Easy on body/feel, the sweetness knocks down the quaffability though."
"Bottle: Poured a clean gold color lager with a medium foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of grainy malt with clean notes of cereal is refreshing. Taste is also dominated by grainy cereal with dry finish. Body is about average with good carbonation. Not bad overall too a bit too grainy for my own taste. A bit one-dimensional and not that refreshing - I will stick with weizen."
"Pretty decent offering from one of my favorite German breweries. Very sessionable, easy drinker. Nothing spectacular, but just what I needed today."
"D: Nothing wrong with it, but many more are better. Kind of a let-down after tasting many of Hacker-Pschorr's other lager offerings."
"Golden yellow with thick head that dissipates to reveal lacing around the glass; Aroma and tatse of sweet grainy malts -- so clean. Perfect viscosity in the mouth, lets you know you are not drinking water but, overall, thin enough and dry enough to be sooo drinkable. Begs me to ask the question, where are the good American lagers? I need to seek them out."
"Pours a pale yellowish-orange colour. Started with a nice white head, but quickly went away. Smells of faint grassy hops and malt. Taste has a hint of hops, not too much bitterness. I expected a bit more hop presence. Not too much going on here. Very smooth though."
"12oz. bottle served at 51 degrees in a pilsener glass. 09/09 indicated on the bottle - guess I should have checked the date. Poured a translucent orange-gold with a frothy, two inch bright white head. Copious tiny bubbles effervesced in solution from the base of the glass to the bottom of the cap. Head eventually settles into a broken skim; one delicate band of lacing was formed during the tasting. Mild nose - cereal malts, a hint of sweetness as a result, and a suggestion of citrus and skunk. Taste consistent with nose - no surprises here. Mouthfeel is light and lively with a fairly clean finish. Simple and refreshing. If the bottle was past its prime, it's difficult to tell."
"This beer pours a clear golden yellow out of the bottle leaving a very small, white head that quickly fades. It smells very faintly of hops. It's a light smell, almost fruit like. This beer has a very smooth flavor, again with a faint hoppiness. The mouthfeel is just right for this style of beer, smooth and refreshing. This is a very drinkable beer."
"D- I really wish that our big breweries would brew beer on a regular basis that resembled this. It's a well balanced brew, which has a nice texture and is very easy to drink. The alcohol is very well hidden and as this style is meant to be, is like a mild Pilsner. I recommend this beer to anyone who doesn't want the strong flavors but wants something of substance."
"D: This is a decent Helles lager. Goes down easy but nothing about it really stands out."
""
"D: This beer has character for how mellow it is. Easy to drink, inexpensive, and very tasty. This is a session beer if I have ever experienced one. This beer ROCKS DUDE !!!!"
"Drinkability- It's a great beer to drink if you're into something different. But if you want to go cheaper, you can go with Beck's since it tastes similar to Beck's but I would really recommend this beer to a friend, and have done it!"
"These go down easy and are not filling. Drank twelve with ease and felt fine the next day. Simple, pure, good beer. Drink it."
"D - Very drinkable. Goes down real easy."
"EDIT def. not a hefe.. label reads 'lager'. will submit a petition to merge."
"A tasty malty lager with a stylistically accurate hop character. Properly attenuated for an easy drinking experience."
"Drinkability: I've drunk a lot of this stuff. Always comes at a good price and never lets you down. I suspect this is what Kokanee and a lot of other big names are trying (and failing) to be."
"Overall, a tasty session lager with above average hop flavour and bitterness, but I'm not sure how this beer differs from their regular Edelhell or the Oktoberfest Lager. All three beers are virtually identical IMO. As well, I expected a solid appearance from this brew, with better head retention and lots of lace. I didn't get it. Still a great lager and one of the best beers at TBS."
"Bottle from TBS- A sparkling deep gold, pours a frothy and sticky white cap. Biscuity nose has hay, lemon, some cookie dough. Sweet biscuit malt with lemon, grassy hops, somewhat fruity. Nice carbonation leaves beer with a creamy feel. A good session Helles for the summer."
"This beer is not intense tasting beer, but its easy to quaff and has good flavor all around."
"At first I was not impressed with this lager but as the glass emptied, I came to feel that another wouldn't be such a bad idea. This is a decent lager, a simple tried and true formula. While it's not an exciting or complex beer, it succeeds on many levels including a substantial mouthfeel on top of a nice, clean taste. Certainly drinkable ... go ahead, try one sometime."
"It's a slightly better Euro Pale Lager. Drinkable. It tastes good. But the aroma leaves me wanting. I'd love to try this fresh because, even though the label says this is good for another ten months, it tastes a bit stale."
"Overall, this is another great bier from Hacker-Pschorr and one that all must try. Do yourself a favor and pick up a few of these and enjoy. Prosit!"
"Another pleasant German helles to add to the list. It was easy to get a light, airy head out of this one. Quite bubbly in the glass; dark lemon in color with citrus and pepper in the aroma. Light, lemony taste; a bit of straw and malt sweetness that is cut by more pepper; fizzy body that fits right in on your front porch on a warm summer night. Not a stunner, but a clean, no-brainer lager that has earned a place in the regular weekday rotation."
"Overall, it's not quite at the pinnacle of the Muenchener Helles variety but it is solid, easy to find, highly drinkable, another winner form Munich."
"Drinkability here is awesome. This might be a bit to sharp to pair with some food, but it was great with salad and corn on the cob."
"Pours golden with fast disapearing white head. Average mouthfeel, malty aroma. Easy drinking, subtle grassy hops, subtle drop of lemon but looking for something more interesting, usually.Crisp and still refreshing. Lightly sweet in finish. Decent German. The Beer Store."
"this helles pours a near crystal clear bright gold with a slightly off-white 1 and 1/2 inch head that reduces to a film. Grassy hop aromas and a touch of bready malts emanate from this brew. Additionally, if I swirl the glass and bring the beer quickly to my nose, I get a pleasing aroma of jasmine rice which is quite unique and very inviting. Flavour is grassy up front with a bread backbone, a slight touch of alcohol and some very light caramel notes with a touch of grain and light fruit (I get a bit of grape - no, wait, I think it's the jasmine rice I detected before! cool! I could be crazy, but I don't think so.) on the finish. A nice, crisp breadiness lingers on for a good while. Mouthfeel is light and crisp with a subtle spicy, prickly character that cleans the palate an leaves a nice and dry sensation in my mouth. This is a pretty good helles lager that is highly drinkable and quite refreshing - an ideal summer lager. Nice and light (but not too light!) and more flavourful than your typical macro. I would definitely buy this again."
"Very nice...would have to watch it as a session beer given the high ABV...but very drinkable."
"Notes: Over all a nice refreshing beer. I know this Lager was a little bit on the old side and I thick that's why I got the small particles. However the flavor was bright and crisp with no off flavors."
"I might keep some in the fridge for after mowing the lawn."
"Overall I really like this juice!"
"Make no mistake - this beer tastes better in Germany. That said, it tastes pretty good here too. You're not likely to describe any beer belonging to the Munich Helles style as ""delicious"" but notwithstanding, they can be very gratifying. A crisp and clean maltiness is all I hoped for and I'm pleased to say that's exactly what I got. Hacker-Pschorr is a quality brewery to and through; I've yet to find any exceptions."
"The taste is a nice balance between a creamy smoothness, especially for a lager, with some bittering grassy hop notes in the finish, and enough tart pale malts underneath to make this beer easy to drink, refreshing. There are some bready grains and some grassy florals in the middle as well. The beer has a touch of citrusy tartness, but again the beer is well balanced on all fronts. This is a very nice, quality lager. The mouthfeel is very light as is the aftertaste. As expected, the body of the beer is quite light. L'Chaim."
"Good beer, but makes me scratch my head, as it wasn't quite the line-em-up-and-drain-em session beer I was kinda hoping for."
"I'll be visting this one over and over, until about the end of September, when it's time to start the trek back to the darker beers."
"An agreeably well-rounded German lager, malty and hoppy, both in measured degrees, and a suitably refreshing tipple for relaxing in some backyard afternoon sunshine. Prost!"
"d - a refreshing beer that is easy to drink but what little flavor profile it has isn't very impressive."
"D - Highly sessionable... Goes down very very easy... However, there is nothing memorable about it... Average and solid are not necessarily bad characteristics... This one exemplifies both of those..."
"light, almost thin, but quite smooth, with just a touch of astringency in the finish. crisp carbonation."
"[1BOT]"
"O) A fine beer, but a pretty bland style. On target, just not the target I'm interested in."
"D- again a very nice beer any Hacker-Pschorr has always been good to me always nice to try at least one."
"[Personal Recommendation]: Definately try this beer I'm sure you fall for it."
"MF&D - Crisp, clean on the palate and extrememly refreshing. I think I found my beer for this Summer."
"The taste is a nice, good helles character also, light but with a solid character of toasty grain and bread with herbs, hints of lemon, honey, and pine. The grain and bread tend to dominate a bit. It has nice malt and hop presence and though light the flavour holds up well and does not degrade. Nothing tastes off or metallic. It's a tad on the sweet side, but just barely and it's very pleasant and easy to drink, yet lacks the great feel of the likes of Weihenstephaner."
"Right in body and aftertaste too, with a good maltiness, still balanced by some bitterness."
"D- Decent. I am going to look for a fresher bottle and update my review. I suspect the age killed the hops."
"That one bit of smell almost had me convinced that this would be terrible, but the taste more than makes up for it. Would make an excellent summertime brew."
"All is in check on this one without a doubt. Still, this Helles leaves something to be desired. I would say that it lacks the roundedness and juicyness I love so much in other German Lagers of the sort."
"This would be an easy brew to session. If you're trying to get some macro drinking buddies to start looking at better brews, this might be the first brew you give them to prepare them for the better offerings available."
"just barely above average."
"A very refreshing Helles, I look forward to the summertime to start enjoying a few of these on a sunny patio. Would be a decent intro to the style for those looking to try."
"Pours a clear gold with big white head. Smells of honey and not much else, but to its credit, the aroma doesn't have the artificial/chemically notes that I find in many other European lagers. Tastes of honeyish and grainy malts that aren't terribly complex but, like the aroma, have an all-natural quality to them that sets this beer a cut above the rest. My one and only bone to pick with this beer is its price: no Helles lager is worth the nearly 10 bucks per six pack that I paid to try it. What I'd REALLY like is to have this beer on tap."
"Hacker-Pschorr Munich Gold is a tried-and-true, if less than exciting, Munich helles lager. I have little doubt that it's much better (and probably more exciting) when consumed in a Munchen biergarten. 'Since 1417' is nothing to sneeze at. No gesundheits here."
"This tastes a lot like their regular Eden-hell but with a smoother more rounded finish. The beer is no surprise ; gold in colour with a refreshing saaz nose. The taste is clean and fairly uncomplicated but with enough going on to place above mere patio fodder. Rounded finish with a bit of sweetness, this is a nice lager that scares no one but stands up to scutiny."
"Overall, a fine brew. Easy to drink and very clean flavors."
"D- I found this beer to be rather tasty, and easy to drink. It's definitely a session brew. It was surly worth the try, and I would drink it again if I was in the mood for it."
"This is just one solid well rounded, highly quaffable brew. Goes good with the holidays with all the shellfish. Pours a nice pillowy head, smells of slight honey, german hops and slight citris, lemony perhaps. Great tasting, goes down smoothly with a bit of twangy hops on the back end. Nice lacing down the glass, has a clean, crisp mouthfeel to it. It should be in everyone's fridge."
"Easy drinking, inoffensive, and a nice example to pair with traditional German fare."
"Pale straw gold color, big billowy head on top of this beer. Aroma....husky grain, lemon-like sweetness, grassy-sweet too. Yeah, it's sweet smelling with a bit of dry husk. Taste...simple, light, and straightforward. Mild malt sweetness and a bit of grassy hop and wood. The key here is balance in the flavor. Good biting crispness on the tongue, but otherwise it's smooth and refreshing."
"D: While I'm not a huge fan of the style, this was a nicely done beer. Very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Smooth and nicely effervescent, it drinks quite well. Unfortunately the overall flavor profile dictates my own drinkability rating, and I'd go elsewhere for the perfect Munich Helles. I could do without the ""gold""."
"D: I've had better and am not really enjoying this too much."
"pours a light golden with a one finger white head that fades quickly with a light lace on the glass. nose is weak with malt and slight hop aroma. taste of sweet malt slightly bready with some hops. its light not much body to it good beer for a hot day is the best i can say for it."
"This is a good warm weather beer. It is tasty, yet light. I will definitely be drinking more of this next summer. A good BBQ beer."
"Refreshing beer that would go well with a bowl of menudo or some barbacoa burritos."
"Smells and tastes of wheat, very bread-like. The translucent, yellow color is barely appetizing. Very thin body makes it easy to drink, not like a lawnmower but easy to have a few pints at a bar. Some citrus in the flavor and a very, very, very little amount of hop apparent in aftertaste. Not much impressive about it really, seems just like having a generic beer."
"Crystal clear med/pale yellow with about one inch of fluffy white head. Fair head retention. Not much of a detectable aroma for me. Maybe a bit of malt? Medium body with med/light carbonation. Nice taste, with a little more hops than malt, but a very nice balance and mouthfeel. A little alcohol warming as it was going down. All in all a good beer. Very drinkable."
"D: A really great beer overall. I would happily revisit this one."
"D : Another fine German beer that's easy to drink."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice lighter beer with a little bit of substance that it worth drinking for a long time."
"What can I say other than I could drink a stein-full of this tasty, unadulterated Munich helles lager."
"Taste is very malty and chewy, notes of munich and crystal malts make the beer very heavy. A nice bitterness, which is clean and balances the malt. Body is actually quite thin for it's malty taste. Yeast leaves little taste, just the bottom fermented tastes."
"D- The after taste makes it hard for me to want more of this beer. It is decent but not a great german beer."
"Nice beer here, but somehow I expected more. The beer begins with a medium straw color, abundance of carbon dioxide, but with light head retention and only a trace of retention. Aromas of pilsner malt set the tone, but may include some toasted Vienna malt as well. Light hints of corn, and cereal grains, but no harshness- only malty sweet notes. Flavors are more malty than the aroma suggests- impressive here. Again hints of corn (dms) hide in the sweetness. Strong pilsner flavors with a hint of maltiness found in Vienna lagers. Hops are light, maybe too light and provide an herbal flavor, but could use bolder grass flavors and bittering. No real astringency in the textures, but the beer weighs a little heavier on the toung than desired. Certainly a quality brew here, but the heavy sweetness, light hopping, and sulfide notes offers opportunity for improvement."
"D = Good refreshing, drinkable beer."
"to sum it up everthing about this beer is just smooth and great tasting. it puts many other beers to shame.."
"Pours a golden sunshine, not a lot of head after a hard pour. A few bubbles coming from the bottom of my glass. The aroma is a dry, grassy malt with maybe a hint of something limey. The first taste is a sweet malt, then quickly turns into something more dry. A little mineraly, but still sweet. The palate is a weet, dry, yet smooth palate. Great combination, making for a very easy to drink beer."
"Good, crisp, clear mouthfeel leads to an equally good level of drinkablity due to the relatively low ABV and wonderful, clean flavors... A certainly good representation of the style... Recommended..."
"D: Great drinkability and session festbier that finishes with a touch of soft citrusy lemons and grainy malt sweetness and perfect balance thoughout the course of the drink. A definite recommend."
"The beer poured a wonderful light gold with a white head. The aroma was of malt with a hint of hops. The taste was a sweet malt with a turn to bitter hop then a final bit of sweetness in the finish that was not overpowering. The feel was light and dry. A pretty decent golden lager, worth sampling again if you wanted this style."
"This beer pours a clear, pale golden color. The head is massive, fluffly, and bright white. The aroma is bready, with hints of minerals, and caramel. The taste is bready with a nice, but mild noble hop bit. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a what session beers are all about."
"The drinkability is just fine, I only wish it was a bit fresher, 07/07 date. Prosit MK"
"Drinkability is great - a true multi-seasonal beer."
"Nice darker gold color. Definitely darker and more robust than American macro ""lagers"". And brewed from much higher quality ingredients therefore giving this beer a pleasant sweet true beer smell. It smells like a German Lager should. The taste replicates the smell. It's slightly thick and chewy and sweet. But not too sweet. I think of a diluted Werther's Original hard candy when I taste this beer. It's quite good. Easy to drink and not too sweet to drink in any quantity."
"Delish!! A near perfect Helles Lager if there ever was one. Drinkable? You bet it is. Unwholly drinkable really. Yummy, yum, yum!"
"Opinion: This is a pretty darn good beer. I like the dominant malt balance and the cleanliness of the whole presentation including the hops. The finish gets a little more ""harsh"" on the palate as the beer warms, but this is a very subtle flaw. For the most part, this is a very drinkable and refreshing beer. I would definitely drink it again, but I don't know how much I will be seeking this beer out."
"drinkability - Very easy drinking beer, you could pound this, but I tried to enjoy it. Since this was from a limited edition gravity keg."
"A standard helles lager. I don't mean to poo-poo the style as it's delicate and hard to pull off. Refreshing, highly quaffable beer."
"D= exceptional"
"EDIT: It seems like they have actually simply renamed Edelhell to be Munich Gold in the US. Any who says that packaging and advertising can't make a difference! I could've sworn I enjoyed Edelhell more! After having some with a very recent bottling date, I'm now a little more confident in this beer. The nose is pretty amazing fresh. The baked bread scent reminds me of visiting a German brewery."
"To me this what BMC should taste like if they stopped using so many adjuncts and spent a little more on some decent hops."
"D: A little less than average for a Helles, would be a good summer beer, but there are better examples out there of this refreshing style, probably won't buy again."
"Mouthfeel is nice and crisp. Very drinkable: nothing complex about this. It's straightforward Lager refreshing, and sessionable."
"Not bad at all, but not much more than a run-of-the-mill/typical Helles lager. A decent choice for an easy refresher, but rather pedestrian."
"Solid golden color, crystal clear, with just a touch of white head on top. No lacing whatsoever. Nose is honey, pencil shavings, a touch of malt and hops as well. Taste is likewise. Honey, drying hops, a good hit of roasted malt as well. Body is medium, with crisp carbonation. This one's alright, but maybe not my favorite style."
"I just reviewed two beers back to back in hopes of discovering which was the better Munich Helles Lager. I reviewed the Hacker-Pschorr Munich Gold and Paulaner Original Munich. Too be honest, I could not find a difference between the two of them. Both were very solid and good beers, nothing spectacular. Honestly, there is such subtle differences between the two beers that I ended up rating them exactly the same. So I tried to discover which is better, and I'm sorry to report, there is not much a difference, but both are good solid beers..."
"Ran into the ""Gold"" label Hacker Helles at me favorite beeratorium. Pours a clear straw color with a rather small head that left no lacing or cap. The smell is typical helles, kind of biscuity, with a light hint of noble hops that produces a slight metallic scent. The taste is light, biscuity malt with the noble hop that sits on the tongue, nothing very distinct. The feel is full bodied with moderate carbonation, not crisp, finishes very balanced. An average Helles lager, not sure how this one is different from their other Helles lagers."
"Crystal clear golden. Moderate amounts of carbonation surface slowly through the body of the beer. The head is thin and off-white. Nice, solid aroma of biscuity and bready malts. A little yeast as well on the nose and a dash of hops. Nice malts on the palate. Bready and grainy and biscuity, but definitely not too sweet or grainy. Just right. A touch of dryness from the hops. The body of this beer is about medium. It's very easy to drink and quite a nice summer lager."
"NOTES: Overall a fine Helles lager. Just not great for me."
"M&D: crisp and clean mouthfeel with a moderately firm body, true to Germany's high standard of lager-making. This lager tastes way lighter than its abv. (5.5%) leads one to believe, making it all the more dangerously quaffable. Although this style is by no means my favourite in the world of lager, it's a quality brew that I feel so happy to have bumped into in an English brewpub that produces mostly conservative ales~~"
