"Good overall beer for my taste. Malty, smooth not hoppy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Easy drinking beer that works, whether you're mowing lawns in FL or mowing lawns during Vermont's short, but sweet summer."
""
"Overall: Nicely refreshing option."
"Sweet pilsner maltiness, light floral spicy hops. I didn't realize CC made a lager, I'm glad they do."
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful white-gold flaxen color; furious columnar effervescence in the center of the Sierra Nevada tulip-pint; nice, dusty-ash white ring of foam forms the head; decently robust dry-malt, strawberry-&-banana, orange-flower, and yeast-fruit bouquet arises from deep inhalation; fairly crisp, very smooth, well-bodied and mild flavors of a wheaty-sweetness—almost creamy—with prevalent notes of grass producing an almost acrid, nonetheless pleasant light bitterness that lingers alongside the residual agua-miel characteristics that melt away.  A definite thirst-quencher—along the lines of Ska's Mexican Logger—that would work quite well with hot foods or under hot suns.  Not the most complex of lagers—nor, like many a lager, does it warm particularly well—but it very much seems to achieve Cigar City's stated goals: an effective nod and effectively refreshing and consumable."
""
""
"OVERALL:  A pretty solid, crisp Helles Lager, reminds me more of a Pilsner due to the hop flavor.  Drinkable and quenching, just don't pour it into a pint glass and leave it out in the Florida sun."
"Maybe not as full-flavored as other examples, but goes down easy on a hot day."

"Poured from the can into a shaker pint at the FL condo. Clear yellow-gold body with a foamy white head. No lacing. Aroma is grain, grass, a bit of spice, and light malt. Taste is floral and grassy with a touch of noble hop spice. Some cereal sweetness to the backbone. Medium-light body, just barely creamy texture, above average carbonation, and a grassy bitter finish."
""
"A very good lager, and Florida needs some craft lagers, so it works. A little more meat on this one than others, frothy and bigger in body, lots more grain base than some imports in the same style. Real low key aroma, attributable for me to a general lack of hops, which is fine, this is a session ale, consumed best in multiples. Holds a nice head and it's bubbles too, and warms up pretty well, which is a nice feature in the Florida sun. I like it feeling a little more substantial, but in terms of flavor it's very in line with style norms. Definitely not the most adventurous beer from these guys, but it serves it's purpose very well."
"Overall: A near textbook Münchner Helles. Crisp, clean and easy drinking. Perfect for a hot day, or in my case, a -10C day! Very reminiscent of the fresh Helles lagers I had while I lived in Austria."
""
""
""
"Surprised!  Really enjoyed this beer."
""
""
""
"Pours  a 1 inch head that dissipates rather quickly, not much lace left over. Color is a golden yellow. Taste is remarkably smooth, very bready, with nice malt balance.  I would take this when i'm outside on a hot summer day over any domestic. A very nice lager overall"

"Poured from a can and into a pilsner glass. A light golden and straw color, modest head. Lacing showed some retention but faded towards the end. I believe the power of suggestion played tricks on my senses. The title hotter than hells had me believing that there were some spices. Lo and behold I thought I smelled hot pepper. However, I then noticed on the bottom of the can that it said no pepper just puns; in other words the beer's title is a reference to drinking refreshing lager in hot weather and not spice. Of course as soon as I noticed this, the pepper smell disappeared. Oh well, so much for my sense of smell. What I did notice however, was a nice floral aroma and malt sweetness. Similarly the taste contained these tones. In addition, there were some fruity elements, kind of like a sweetened lemon or hints of orange. Also there was a good bready and malty backbone. Nice feel; crisp, refreshing and light bodied. (definitely a summer drink and quite drinkable). I would have perhaps liked a tad higher carbonation but maybe this would ruin the taste. A nice beer that I enjoyed in the winter. Next time, I will seek it out in the summer when it is truly hotter than hell and make it a session beer."
"Grabbed a can at Astoria Bier and Cheese. I love a great lager and this delivers. It's a simple, but tasty style and Cigar City nails it. The malts are toasty and crisp with a sweet doughy bread and light caramel. There's a very subtle earthy hops note in the finish, but for the most part, this is a lovely example of pale malts. I'd like to try it side-by-side with Surly Hell and Weihenstephaner Original."

"I'm usually not a lager fan, but CCB has me sold on their take of a Munich Helles.  Smooth mouthfeel, complex for a lager with just the right amount of hop bite.  I can see myself 'tubing with a six-pack on the creek in the summer.  As is implied, this would be an excellent summer or beach beer."
""
""
""
"My rating: 4"
""
""
""
""
"Lightly carbonated, this is a highly drinkable summer time lager. Though it had zero head retention nor lacing. Perhaps I got a lemon. Refreshing drink however, I was just expecting a little more."

"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Thanks to the creator of the canquest, woodychandler, for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a cloudy, bright yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some sweetness to it. Taste is sweet, malty, very refreshing on a humid summer night. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall makes for a good session beer."
""
"Pours pale yellow with thin layer of head that retains minimally. The nose features light grassy notes along with toasted grain, light caramel, and some light notes of citrus. Taste leans towards the sweet side for the style. Sweet grainy flavors up front with some hints of citrus and a light touch of grassy hops. It's not until the finish that there is a slight dryness. Mouthfeel is light and well carbonated. Overall, this drinks nicely but perhaps a touch too sweet for an easy drinking lager."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour is straw yellow with a light haze and a small amount of tight white head. Nose is light grain, a bit of yeast, strong lemon notes. Taste is similar, a bit more grain bill to it, yeasty mid palate and lots of lemon in back. A bit of grassy herbal hops in the finish with virtually no bitterness. Body is light but a hint syrupy with moderate carb."
""
""
""
""
"o: yep, its a solid beer. refreshing, quenching, and satisfying. light and crisp. all the flavors are mellow and balanced. sweet & light. nice summer brew"
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden-yellow with a foamy white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, white grape juice, and grass aromas. Taste is much the same with grain, grass, and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
"Overall: A touch over okay overall. I love my helles lager and this one is a touch off. I wouldn't turn it down on a hot day but just okay in the end."

"Hmm. I will make the jokes around here, thanks, plus it is misleading. The loud Crack! revealed a brimful craft CAN, but IAW The Old Lady's wishes and the directions on the CAN, the Glug was as gentle as could be. I still managed to create a finger of fizzy, bone-white head with limited retention. Color was a pale lemon-yellow (SRM = 2) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled like German lager - a honey-like sweetness from the malts underlain by a grassiness from the hops. I prefer Czech-style lagers, but this will do. The CANQuest (TM) was built on a steady diet of AALs and I am very glad to have those days in the rear view mirror. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, more effervescent than I might have expected, and the taste was really sweet. In fact, it was too sweet for my taste. I would not have minded a pepper presence at all as opposed to this. Very honey-like, but I have some Blue Dog mead that will satisfy that craving when the time comes. Finish was likewise sweet and now I found myself looking forward to on of their many CANned IPAs to wash away the taste."

"It's a fine drinkable brew, but it comes off almost like a Euro lager than a Helles."

"Surprised this held up as well as it did. Solid offering on a fairly uncommon style. A hint of metallic character emerges late."
""
""
"Overall: I consider Cigar City to be the Surly of Minnesota, but this kinda sucks. Surly Hell or even Maui Bikini Blonde are much better Hells lagers. I'd rather have a Corona."

"It's funny how a beer can have very little complexity but truly taste really good. This is dead on the style with a smooth grain flavor, barley and bread, with a slight tinge of hops. This is light and so easy to drink that it can be easily deceptive. I don't expect a lot out of any lager but I find this to be one of my favorites as it has pronounced lager properties and easy lager drinkability."

"Pretty good beer. Poured at a good temperature with a nice size, foamy, off-white head that didn't last and no lace. Color is a slightly hazy yellow amber. Aroma is a bit faint, but has malt, hop,grain, spice. Flavor's like nose, carbonic tang in front, then malt, hop, hint of sweet. Body is good, carbonation a tad sharp. Finish is like flavor, a little short, and very drinkable."
""
" and slightly bitter. I could drink this brew a lot during summer time."
""
"Pours dirty gold/yellow, touches of white foam atop. Light lemon nose. Very faint. Bright chalky citrus flavor. Clean finish, light hop. Smooth. Slight helles flavor holds. Good Florida beer, good option for a trip to the beach"

"Jan 29 on can poured on Mar 6. Pours a light golden from the can into a pint glass. Not much head or retention. Smells of light fruit with a standard lager aroma. Light mouthfeel with low carbonation. Sweet light fruit and not much to get excited about. Par for the style and easy summer drinking. Just can’t get into the style all that much."

"O- CCBs super drinkable beer if you aren't a Jai Alai fan like me. just too delicate and mundane in my opinion, but if this is your style than definitely worth a try"

"O: This was a true ""wow beer"" in its style class. Bravo!"
""
""
""
"Picked this one up while on vacation in Daytona Beach. Poured from 12 oz. can into a NB globe glass. Pours cloudy, light yellow in color, thin white bubbly head. Smells outstanding, thick bready malts, banana, citrus fruit, bubblegum. The taste is light, nice balance of malt with some floral hops in there as well. Slightly fruity, hints of lemon. Mouthfeel is thin, bubbly, carbonated. Refreshing, perfect for summer. Overall a great hot weather beer, flavorful, satisfying, delicious. This brewery never disappoints."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On a side note, I think that Cigar City may need to re-name this beer. Being a beer geek, I never realized that the name makes people think the beer is spicy; but I've had people ask me if it's made with peppers. When you have to explain twice on the label that the beer doesn't have any hot peppers or spices in it, I think you have a problem."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Refreshing but not my cup of tea. I haven't had too many lagers but this is nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad brew, glad I tried it, But I will not have this one again."
""
""
""
"O- When you're dealing with a brewery as extreme as CCB, Helles lagers are the last thing you expect or want to find but this one does well as far as easy drinking summer beers go."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Better than average appearance for a lager. Nice lacing down the sides of the glass. You get your typical lager aroma, nothing to special. Taste is very pleasant, very smooth. This won't blow you away, but if you like lagers this is one to get and share around with those friends who only drink Budweiser."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I feel like I have been ruined on lagers because the budweisers of the world, but this was remarkably delicious. Restored my faith!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Mmm, graininess really shines like a Munich helles, very well done indeed. Hops are light and add just enough grassy hop dryness on the finish. Old world hallertau hops are definitely evident. Mouthfeel is a little richer than the imports and has less carbonation. Overall, a pretty nice take on the style and one of the more authentic versions brewed in America."

"Overall - A nice, enjoyable Munich Helles from Cigar City. Does well to rival many of the German offerings, some of which are considered the best lagers on the planet. Great summer beer, as recommended on the can! Helles means bright in German - this beer exudes brightness."
"O-A great beer on a hot day. Crisp, easy drinking and refreshing. That being said it doesn't over come the lawnmower status."
""
""
""
""
""
"O) The one thing I have locally is plenty of well crafted lagers, so this not being available here, is no big deal. Having said that, it's a nice beer, and the folks in Florida looking for a lager, should drink it up."

"The beer pours a straw yellow with a fizzy soap bubble head that goes away quickly and leaves a little scrim. The beer’s body is quite clear with just a slight haze to it and a steady stream of lazy bubbles working to the top of the glass. On the nose, the beer smells sweet and grassy, almost like a very dry strawberry smell with touches of bread. The malt is super sweet and fruity on the nose but the grassy hop backing gives a balance to the smell and makes this beer more inviting to the nose. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet with a finish of smooth grassy bitter hops. The flavors begin as sweet bready malt with a faint touch of fruity strawberry, this dries out slowly and becomes progressively bitterer grassy flavors with nuances of sweet malt and very slight green pepper notes. The finish is creamy sweet bread malts that linger nicely into the aftertaste and slowly dissipate onto the palate leaving grassy bitter to tingle on the tongue. In the can, the beer smells weak, with very little of its nuances escaping through the hole. It tastes less sweet when sipped from the can with none of the fruity malts, but a nice bitter grassy hop’s kiss. It tastes slightly more refreshing from the can, but not as complex or nuanced. In the mouth the beer feels slightly prickly in carbonation, which helps to balance out the sweetness of the beer. The beer also feels medium thick in body. The mouth is left clean but with a nice swath of saliva dribbling on the tongue. Overall, I like this beer. It is sweet, but balanced well with hops and carbonation, and it is refreshing and interesting on the palate. A great sessionable sipper from Cigar City."

""

"O- Great helles lager, very drinkable and very enjoyable."
""
""
"Good try, but could use some more work to really nail the style."
""
"O: A GREAT beach, summertime brew. Perfect for the Tampa shores."
""
""

"Medium straw color, with a thin head that disappears quickly and leaves little behind on the glass. Smell is melon with a touch of banana. Taste is mild malt with a touch of pepper and a bready aftertaste. Feel is light to medium heaviness, and a little fizzy at first, but the carbonation drops off a touch after a couple of minutes. Overall this is drinkable and refreshing. It's not particularly complex, just enough to be interesting. This is not one of my favorite styles, but this is done well and is quite good for a nice warm day."
""
"Overall: Having easy access to this one, I'll probably revisit from time to time, and this is a great summer beer for myself. I think it has enough going on in the taste where I'll discover more and more after each one."
""
""
""
"Nice yellow color. Very balanced taste. You can totally taste the cracker. Beer feels very light and refreshing. Another addition to one of my faves or ""go to"" beers. ABV is about 5% and smooth. Very tastey."
""
""
""
""
""

"o - extremely refreshing and super drinkable lager. has a nice soft fruity quality to it while still being very much a lager. would have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Soft in feel with a quickly exiting carbonation, leaving things a bit viscous on the finish. Overall intriguing given the funkiness but likely prefer a cleaner Continental variant of the style as for a regular quaff."
"I haven't really been disappointed by anything from Cigar City, and this is no exception, especially considering I really wasn't expecting much from it at all. Very clean and refreshing with some mild citrus and hop flavors, along with a clean lager profile. Certainly something nice to enjoy on a hot day."

"Poured from a can. Slightly acidic finish. Nice hops balance. I wish there was a little more maltiness. A little thin on the malt. Overall a GREAT can of beer. And considering I am only about 4 hours drive from there, it's pretty fresh (yeah its in a can but I get it closer than others..) I feel like that if there were a little more malt finish, the Helles style would be complete. It finishes a little thin for my idea of the style based on soem of the incredible import examples of the style. Maybe not a continental pilsner malt but a german or belgian one."
""
""
"O- A solid light lager but I wish it was boiled a bit longer to drive off the DMS"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cost: $8.99 for a six pack of cans."
"Enjoyed at the CC Tasting Room. Light yellow with a large retained head. Tasty, it yields both sweet and sour interplay. Like a dirty yeasty blonde flvour, with a chile pepper finish. Yet no spices were included? Good that CC is doing these beers. A good late day beer. OK drinkability."
""
"Overall - A great beer for camping trips or tailgating for sure. It`s very refreshing and goes down fast. Not sure how true to style it is, but it`s still a tasty beer worth trying."

"I can't imagine Helles being all that hot... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear straw topped by a finger or so of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises wheat, sweet flowers, and a kiss of grass. The taste brings in more of the same, though with a bit more of both the flowers and the grass. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, this is a nice little helles, nothing earth-shattering, but it's not meant to be. It's a pleasant session beer, perfect for those who need a lighter option when the weather turns all Floridian and whatnot."
""
"O - Really was looking forward to trying this one, sadly was disappointed. To be fair, I am far from a fan of pils. This is a big more complex with the bigger malts, but far from the more complex brews out there."

"The beer is transparent and pale yellow with a half inch of white head. A fine appearance. The aroma is subtle, with notes of bread, grain, a touch of yeast. Smells good. The taste is more aggressive. Light and bready. Refreshing and crisp with appropriate carbonation. A solid example of the style."
"Medium bodied but fuller than expected especially considering the appearance.  Light crisp hops followed by some earthy grass/straw character as well as some bready yeast and light fruit.  Some apple and pear provided sweetness that counters the earthy hop character.  Well balanced, light and very easy to drink."
""
""
""
"O: OK to good for a lager, just not my preference. I don't think I'll get again."
"O: I really enjoyed this beer and it reminded me of drinking a helles under the chestnut trees in a Munich biergarten."
""
""
""
""
""
"Hotter than Helles pours out a very bright golden yellowish color with a clear body, not any haze in the way. A nice bright white cap on top with some legs but no stick. Good retention. Bubbles. Smell is pretty pale malted up with some underlining spicy hop notes. I get some fruity scents, but that may be from the previous beer on tap. Taste is helles, than I get the fruity flavor as well, which kinda kills it for me. Rich German hop flavor and malt mixes well with a light enough body but I am unsure of the semi fruit flavor I am getting. Feel is on point, light and spritzy carb, a nice hop bite towards the end. I was hoping for more, perhaps I am spoiled by all the great German style offerings local to us in SEPA, but Hotter than Helles was a dud."
"Pale yellow in color with a deep haze. Poured with a foamy bright white head that reduced to a sticky dense cap. Biscuity sweet malt aroma with hints of floral hops and an earthy grass character. Aggressive, somewhat fizzy carbonation up front that turns buttery smooth through the middle. Biscuit malt and floral hop bitter flavors with a apple-like sweetness in the background. The hop flavors peak toward the end with a tangy twist of he taste buds. Finishes crisply with a slightly tart aftertaste."
""
"single finger clear straw colored body some lacing. Aroma is grassy, grainy and light malts. The body is much fuller than I was expecting with high carbonation. Very refreshing and highly drinkable. Flavor of bitter hops like noble hops but mildly so with a nice malt profile and grassy notes. For my tastes one of the best mouthfeels and flavors of a Helles I have had."
"O - This is a pretty tasty lager. I was glad to try a fairly rare Cigar City brew at Tap 42."
""
"A nice golden brew with a finger and a half head receded slowly. The smell is nice cereal grains with a touch of flora. Great bready, cracker-y taste with the slightest hint of hops, very refreshing, and extremely quaffable."
"Beer is light and wet, good finish, clean and crisp, the yeast shows up in the late forward palate, a little thicker mouthfeel than I expected and a good finish on the end. I'd have this again (I had it twice while in FL)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall I liked this one. I thought it was a very easy to drink lager, and is pretty light and refreshing. Nose is pretty nice, while the taste has more grains and wheat. Would have it again, could be a good spring/summer beer."
"O - Not a bad beer, good lager taste with some distinctive honey sweetness. Worth trying."
"O - overall this isn't a bad beer. i was expecting a little bit more from cigar city after trying their jai alai, but for a helles lager (which usually don't have much as far as flavor), this is damn delicious."
"It poured a bright cloudy thick yellow with a small head. wasn't much to the smell, maybe because I was in a bar. Tasted like a buttery beer. I couldn't get past that. It wasn't very good. It was fairly thick and creamy, and honestly felt, and tasted like a pilsner mixed with melted butter. I did not enjoy this and was very disappointed. I love the brewery and everything I have had by them until this one."
"This beer pours a bright golden straw color that has nice clarity. there is about a finger of white head resting on top. The head has good retention, and it leaves a nice bit of lace behind on the glass. The nose is of grainy malt sweetness. There is also some fruitiness, honey, spicy hops, and some earthy grassiness. The taste followed what the nose suggested. It started off with some grainy malt sweetness. There are some nice flavors of honey, fruit, and some earthiness. Also, there is an earthy spicy hop presence. The finish leaves some lingering earthiness, hop presence, and the sweet maltiness behind on the palate. This has a medium body and good carbonation. It goes down really easy, and it has a really smooth feel to it. There is some sweetness at first, and then a nice earthiness comes in and balances it out. Also, there is some spice and bitterness from the hops that is really nice. It has a nice refreshing quality to it. There is really good drinkability here. I could easily have a few pints of this in a night. It goes down really easy, has nice flavor, and is pretty refreshing. Overall, I think it is just a solid beer, and I recommend trying it out. I would buy this one again. I can see it being really nice on a hot summer day. I hope i run into it again."
"Lighter body, higher carbonation, clean and crisp on the tongue, really refreshing. A nice lager enhanced by a blast of citrus."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: As far as a helles bock is concerned, this is good, but for my tastes, it falls a bit short. the head retention and the aroma were way off, but the flavor and mouthfeel are on par. Good beer for a hot summer afternoon, or a tailgate party, but i prefer a bit more complexity."
""
""
""
"Overall, an ok version of the style. A little off."
""
""
""
""
"O-i'm enjoying this. its a very tasty lager that one could drink all night long. just for those who want to know, i am a lager fan though. i can't wait for this to come out in cans!"
""
""
""
""
"Despite the nose not giving up a whole lot, I thought that this was quite a solid take on a Helles, with a flavorful and well balanced crispness that was very accessible and inviting on the palate. This one is worth a look."

"Overall: Good beer overall. Worth a shot if you see it on draft."
"Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, full carbonation, medium light body. Super drinkable, cigar city please consider canning this guy."
"Mediim-bodied maybe leaning fuller, good effervescence with a nice tanginess on the tongue.Some white grape and corn notes throughout he aftertaste to keep the malt company. For a first or second lager ever, this is pretty good. Mind, I'm not a lager person."
