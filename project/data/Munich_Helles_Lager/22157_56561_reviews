"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and it's an above average example of the style, the malts were very bready and it had the signature spicy hops, but I think they were just a little light for the style. This beer had good drinkability, it was pretty smooth, clean, not filling, and the flavors did a decent job at holding my attention, I wouldn't have a problem drinking a few of these and it makes for a nice beer to enjoy on those hot summer afternoons. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel they were both pretty nice. What I liked the least about this beer was the balance, I feel like a little more spicy hops would help make this truer to style and balance out all those bready malts. I would order a pint or two of this at a bar, but I don't think I would get a six pack of it and I recommend to anyone who likes easy drinking Lagers. All in all I enjoyed this beer, it was a nice easy drinking lager, but Hofbräu Original is still my favorite of the style, i think it's more balanced than this beer and it does a better job at showcasing those spicy hop flavors. This made for a decent first impression for Rivertown and i'm interested in checking out more of their beers. Thanks a lot Adam."

"O - This style isn't gonna wow anyone, but hits the spot and is worth a try. Cheers!"

"While not as hoppy and dry as I'm used to for German-style lagers (e.g., pilsners), this was a nice break. Rivertown makes very solid attempts at traditional European styles, and the Helles is no exception... I'd rather have a pilsner, though. But a refreshing, malt-forward brew overall."
""
"Overall: Really delicious Helles Lager. Slightly sweet with a underlying noble hop bitterness/spiciness. Very clean, crisp and refreshing beer, however with a bit too high carbonation for my taste. True German-Pils malts are prominently displayed."

"Overall, it's much better than I expected. More ABV would be a nice addition, but I didn't hate this and that's praise coming from me."
"This is a pretty good helles. Unfortunately, the carbonation is so high that it really does interfere with the flavor delivery. What I do get is a nice grainy lager with a consistent flavor profile though. A bit metallic and tangy. But it's passable."

"Call it a kellerbier or a bohemian lager and I'm going to buy that much better than a helles, but even then the heightened taste and texture of corn and bitter prove too much for any lager beer."
""
"Mouthfeel: The body of the beer is well balanced and middle of the road but I can’t get past the carbonation it is just too much."

"I don't know how, but it feels like my mouth has turned to a smoldering ember after each drink. WTF?"
""
"Overall: Decent beer. It seems a little watered down but has a nice overall flavor. I had a really hard time pouring this beer, there was a lot of carbonation. I would like to try again."
"O: Very enjoyable beer. Reminiscent of hefe and pilsner characteristics. Easy to drink."
"O: Overall quite nice, something that is crisp and easy drinking. I would certainly choose this of the plethora of other lager options which flood our markets these days."
"O - not perfect, but it's a decent pale lager. Some funny stuff in the nose could be cleared up."
"12 ounce bottle, single bottle bought for $1.59. Served in a pilsener glass, the beer pours a slightly hazy light gold color with about a half inch white head. The head retention is good, but there isn't much lacing left on the glass. The aroma is a little light overall, the brew smells like bready malt, sweet malt and a bit of grassy hops. It mostly tastes like grain/bready malt, along with some light grassy hops and lemon peel. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's nice and crisp with good carbonation. It's also easy to drink. I think it's a solid overall brew, it's nice and enjoyable to drink, and definitely worth trying."
"This one pours a very light and moderately clear faint gold in color with a light white lacing around the glass. When it first poured it even resembled a chardonnay. It eventually gained a light cloudiness. It smells of pilsner malt with a light sweet malty finish. It's moderately grainy. Upon my first whiff I even thought I got some ever so light white grape. Interesting and light. It drinks very clean and light and has moderate carbonation. Overall this one is okay, and I like when American breweries cover this style, but this one doesn't separate itself from the others."
"A very pleasant Helles - crisp, bright malt body with a bit of toasted biscuit in the malt. A touch of grassyness with hints of lemon. Easygoing character makes for a good session candidate. I'd like to see this brewery get a bit wider distribution."
"What an excellent way to end a rather long work week during an especially hot summer. This is an ideal quaff - I finished this in no time and found myself reaching for another."
"On tap at Bodega in Columbus, $4.50 per pint. Clear pale golden color, about a cm of foam that sinks to a filmy layer. Bready aroma, neutral and a little grainy, very little impact from hops (appropriately). Nice flavor, nothing offputting at all. Just a solid and unassuming Helles Lager. Good carbonation and body, no real complaints with this beer."
"Quality helles lager in true Bavarian fashion (as opposed to a mediocre American imitation). I'll be seeking more offerings from this small, local brewery..."
"O- Overall a very easy drinking beer that was a touch boring but still solid."
"It's sweet. Almost too sweet for my taste. I can't drink more than a couple of bottles of this lager. It seriously needs a hops infusion. It may be OK for some traditional Bavarian foods, such as a pretzel with mustard, but it's just too sweet for my taste. I'll probably not get it again."
"Just enough creamy mouthfeel to let you know it is there, but not enough to keep one from gulping if they want. Easy on the chops, this is decidedly a session beer dream: incredibly easy to drain without thought, but enough to discuss in case any thought is given."
"D. It's damn hot in my house tonight and this is cool and refreshing. Perfect brew when it's hot outside."
"D: Due to the great taste and easy going body of this beer, this is definitely session worthy."
"D: clean lager and somehow refreshing. Not really hitting my spot as a Helles. Had one and switched to a wheat. Not very drinkable in 'mass'."
"this is very drinkable. i enjoyed this, very balanced, although could use a bit more dominating flavors. this would be a wonderful summer beer."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is light but not watery. The flavors and aromas are clean. The carbonation works well with the beers overall character. This is a nice throw back beer."
"D: Very clean and refreshing, would go well on a hot day. Paired great with my Shrimp & Asparagus Salad."
"Drinkability - a nicely done Helles. Ought to hold its own come warmer climes and should taste just as good if the Cincinnati heat gets to it a bit, though mine is steadily disappearing."
