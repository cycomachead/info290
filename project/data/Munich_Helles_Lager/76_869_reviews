"Overall a pretty good beer, with perhaps too much yeast taste."
"Overall this beer is quite interesting with it's dominant bready character."

"O: This lager is money, and, unfortunately, it’s such an enjoyable style that good breweries in the USA don’t usually make. Most beer drinkers would love one of these at one point or another."

"Half litre bottle, similar colour to apple juice, clear. Slight noble hop smell with a hint of yeast. Fairly sweet, just about balanced, a bit malty. Medium body, a bit of fiz. Overall a decent thirst quencher but you could tell it had been mass produced. Didn't quite match the flavour of other Helles that I've had from smaller breweries."

"Overall: Very drinkable beer. It's perfect for people who are use to Light American Lagers and want to slowly be introduced to more hand-crafted bolder bodied beers. Also, I've never been disappointed by Hacker-Pschorr. They make great beers."
"Not as complex as some of the others in this style."
"It is a decent one."
"The flavor is exceptionally clean, if a tad boring in the end. Grainy, lightly sweet malts, mild bitterness, and some herbal, grassy hops. The mouthfeel is light, soft and well-carbonated. Very good cold."
"Picked this up at Maruhn GetrankeMarkt, a great beer store outside of Darmstadt. Crystal clear straw yellow pour with quickly fading two finger head and minimal lacing. Pretty typical, albeit subdued, German pils/helles nose although not as grassy as most with just a touch of metal. Very nicely balanced. Perfect combination of bitterness with just enough sweet malts. Very clean and crisp, and it has that subtle metallic tinge to it that I love. The drinkability is over the top. I often find these helles beers to be too sweet for my taste, but this was a really nice change. I actually prefer this to the draft versions I've had at fests."
"I really enjoyed this one. It really changed my perception of lagers."
" Flavor is light, crisp. Apple, tart pear, citrus, biscuit, sour wildflower honey, sauerampfer, peppper, malt. the finish is really superb. Crisp, carbonated and tingling, my palate is left tingling with peppery sharpness that set your palate perfectly for the next sip. Following a rather unspetacular DAB pilsner, it really shows the difference between a Pils and Helles.My vote is for the Helles. Cheers."
"This brew is soft on the palate, and wetting as well. Moderately carbonated."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Munich Helles lager."
"Man, this is beer. I could down this by the liter. It's a perfect balance of light, nutty, biscuity malts with a dash of spicy hops. Very clean flavor and incredibly drinkable. It's a shame this beer, or style, isn't very common, or often this well made."
"D- Very drinkable lager, this and Augustiner are the best Munich has to offer."
"This was served from a 12oz bottle. A beautiful golden color to this beer and a frothy white head. It smelled good with some spice to it. Upon sipping, I noticed a good amount of hops in the beer. They continued to linger in the after taste as well. I had a couple of these while eating a grilled chicken sandwich and the beers complemented the chicken very well. A very smooth beer with just the right amount of character to it."
"Very good beer with a nice mouthful."
"D- Very simple up and down drinking helles, great in summer session at the biergarten, could drink all day without effort, but would like a little bit more character. Does the job and wouldnt pass on it"
"The spicy hops re-emerged in the taste, but malt still ran the show with bread and grains dominating my palate. The carbonation was a little low and the feel a bit thin and watery. I wanted to like this beer more, but in the end felt like it lacked that little something extra that separates memorable beers from the rest."
"immensely drinkable, and would go well with a giant brezel. no wonder this stuff sells by the liter in the beer gardens."
"Final Thought: This is a real nice helles which is hard to make right sometimes, this one is in the top quartile in my book."
"This is a very representative German lager in my opinion. It pours a nice clear golden color with a thin, pure white head. There is very little lacing. The aroma is one of grain and yeast with a hint of alcohol and malt. It has a nice lager flavor but stronger than most lagers brewed in the US. It has that distinctive German lager flavor that is very recognizable, and which I can only attribute to the German barley and malts. This has a lot of body for a lager and is crisp and clean. It is also very smooth with no real bite and goes down very easily and much too quickly."
"crystal clear golden topped with a fat white head that is retained rather well. clean munich malt aroma, with hints of light esters and european hops. crisply carbonated and refreshing, while retaining a sturdy medium body. clean and lightly sweet toasted grain flavor, balanced by an earthy noble hopiness. tastes slightly more fruity as it warms up, but this is pretty subtle. nice clean lager that is refreshing and easy to drink, yet still retains ample flavor. great summer beer."
"Came out with a three finger white contoured head over clear gold. Has a classic Helles mild malty nose wiht just a hint of metal and soap. The mouth is very (too) prickly and light. The taste is fresh and crisp, but lacks soul, as there is not a whole lot of maltiness or hoppiness or wheatiness or anything else. The finish brings out a bit of the hops, but by then it is too late. There's a certain sweetness here that does not go over well. Overall, this beer is quite unremarkable."
"Very attractive pale straw color that highlights the carbonation and the surprisingly solid white head. Musty, bready, veggie aromas -- not really great or appealing to me. Almost smells like any other pale lager, really. Surprisingly full for a lager like this -- medium-bodied. It worked well as a post-beach brew on a 95 degree Delaware day."
"($1.99 / 12 oz.)"
"Mom always said not to judge a book by its cover. Never has this rang true so much for me (at least in the beer world) as it did with this brew. It had a nice, delicate flavor and a great smooth, medium-bodied feel. Not at all what I expected from the appearance and the smell."
"The front is sweet and light. The middle is very light, with a slightly watery feel, but it gets more buttery as it warms. The finish is dry, and slightly metallic at cooler temps. Overall, this is a decent light beer."
"Very golden with a foamy white head that is thick and long lived. The nose is a pleasant hop with a strong malt undertone that is refreshing and inviting. The flavor is a nice dry beer with a hoppy flavor that is complex and unique. The aftertaste is mild and fading with a minimal to almost non-existent hop ghost."
"Crystal-clear medium golden color with a small white head and a few small bubbles rising lazily to the surface; fairly good lace. Spicy herbal aroma that carries a fairly sturdy malt note as well. Taste begins with a well-rounded sweet maltiness, this gives way to a tart finish with lots of spicy herbal hoppiness. Finish is dry with a lingering mild bitterness. Not great, in my opinion, but shares the quality and craftsmanship that defines German brewing."
"Crystal clear straw-golden brew forms a rocky white head atop medium sized bubbles. Head thins quickly but leaves a nice layer of ""colonies"" on top with delicate lace at the edges. Moderate carbonation. Aroma is of freshly cut grass, delicate malts, white wine, and just an inkling of alcohol (Similar to a Steinlager or Harp). Mouthfeel is crisp and bright. Starts with a delicate german noble hop spiciness, and fades into a mild sweet malt background, ending with an extremely clean and crisp sweetness and a fizzy bittering hop. Extremely well done lager, and very drinkable. No skunkiness, or any other off flavors appreciated (even upon warming)."
"A perfectly clear straw-colored pour with a finger's worth of bubbly white head that disappears quickly to minimal lacing. Smell is somewhat weak and decidedly uninspired, dominated by grains (but thankfully without skunkiness). Taste is also rather uninspired, though certainly not bad. Exceedingly smooth, malty taste with a sweet, bready finish. Mouthfeel is fine, and drinkability is quite good. This beer goes down smooth, but I'll trade quantity for quality any day, and that is where this one falls short."
"Brilliantly clear golden/straw color. Has a white head with large bubbles of carbonation, and a slight lace-work while sipped down. The aroma is of bread and grains with a slight sweet malt smell. The flavor is slightly sweet as well, with a bready, grainy flavor. It flows to a bit of a dry bitterness. It is a light-medium bodied beer with a semi-sweet finish. Overall, it is an easy drinking and smooth beer, with multiple flavor characteristics."
"Pours a crystal clear gold color, massive bright white head and oodles of fine lace, which desiccate to sticky clumps upon the glass. Nose is malt, fresh, clean and crisp. Front is mostly malt and somewhat sweet, the top is reedy, the finish bitingly acidic, pleasantly hopped, with a dry somewhat bitter aftertaste. Quite quaffable, and one of the handful of Lagers/Pils, I can call Delectable. Ranks #672 on my current 1000 beer master list."
"A stocky lager with a hefty pale maltiness that may lack a bit in character but lays down a solid clean flavour throughout. Hint of alcohol after a few sips, bitterness is more than enough to counter the maltiness with a flowery herbal flavour. Highly drinkable though a bit potent as well."
"Beautiful golden yellow color with a tiny whisp white head. Medium body with good hop balance. A citric aftertaste that quickly goes dry. Certainly a crisp and refreashing drink."
"Crystal clear light golden color and a ghost white head.  Retention isn't too bad.  Nice aroma of sweet and sour fruity malt, with a little hop presence.  Grainy malt flavor rules this brew, but hops aren't far behind, with a slight citrus character.  Sweet and lightly fruity.  Grain character dominates all around the palate, and stays in the aftertaste as well.  Satisfying, refreshing, great-tasting, and drinkable in that characteristic German way.  One of those beers that begs to be consumed in generous amounts."
"Prosit!"
"Crystal - clear light - golden hue, topped by a thin but well - retained head.  Sweet, grainy malt notes dominate the aroma, but a subtle herbal hop nose is discernible as well.  The flavor profile is comprised of light hop bitterness and non - descript malt sweetness.  Lightly bodied, w/ a slightly watery mouthfeel, but drinkability remains quite good.  The finish is mildly bitter and clean.  Although a decent helles, it seemed to lack a bit of malt backbone.  I could easily drink several of these, however."
"Taste is light and refreshing with slight and smooth hop bitterness ending with mild malt finish.  Body and mouthfeel is appropriate for the style. Drinkability is exceptional; somehow the sum of this beer is greater than its parts."
"after a long time of slammin bottles, we decided it was time for a keg of this beautiful lager. then.... a piece of heaven floated onto my friends deck as we put down pitchers of this excellent brew all night long. there is another keg awaiting, and i cannot wait until then. out of the keg, this beer is unbelievably smooth and delicious. word to the wise, when you find a great beer, get it in a keg. then you will have lived a happy life."
"My buds and I love this out of the bottle, so we ordered a keg of it from our local distributor ($$$$$$$). Unbelievably smooth from the tap, and excellent from the bottle as well. One of the best beers out there. I am going to go have one now. Ohhhhh mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm"
"Clear,  attractive color, mercifully subdued carbonation, long mouthfeel, almost medium-bodied, not a bright beer in malt taste, one with a long grainy taste thats slightly strange, maybe a little clovey...I'm not always in the mood, but this tastes good...not a quencher, though..."
"Notes: Another winner from Hacker-Pschorr in my opinion. This beer has a lot of mouthfeel and flavour for a deceptively light in appearance brew."
