It bears that same sort of grassiness that I didn't like about Guinness's Harp Lager and that same kind of bitterness I find prevalent in many domestic beers. Not to mention, I always categorized Leinenkugel for its flavors, be them lemon, orange, lemon berry, or simply just refreshing and rather intoxicating hops, but Hoppin' Helles overdoes it to the point where the flavor is more of a nuisance than a presence. Definitely the weakest of Leinenkugel's otherwise surprisingly good line of beers.","SteveJeremy","Beers"

You could definitely smell the hops in the beginning. My first sip was nice and hoppy, what i expected, but the more I drank the less impact the taste had on me. It has that nice citrus like bitterness that you expect from an IPA but it was over powering. This would a great IPA style to have with meals because it wouldn't over power the taste of your food. Overall, nice beer. I enjoyed drinking it, but honestly I don't see myself making a run to buy it specifically anytime soon.

It's not a terrible beer, just a little overblown in all respects. The hop acidity takes a slightly unpleasant turn particularly on the nose, and drinkability suffers a bit because of its size. A more subtle approach may actually have been better here. I actually have to respect Leinenkugel's (Miller) for trying something like this and not just laying down and becoming ""that shandy brewery"". However, what's really crazy is that I bought this from a 25 case close out stack . . . 3 weeks after the bottled on date. So I guess nobody really committed to it.

The taste brings in more of the same, the now-flowery hops barely standing out against a bland, slightly-bready backdrop. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.

3.8,19.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,"NOTES: Pleasant beer. Probably one of Leinenkugel's best. Clearly made to market to the ""hop"" niche - ""Hoppin' Helles"". Surprisingly hoppy in both the aroma and flavor though. Bright with resinous, citrusy, and grassy hops in the nose. Crystal clear deep gold body beneath a two-fingered head of rocky white froth that holds really well. Eventually over time, about a half a glass in, it completely settles but maintains an almost full surface coating. Good to very-good lacing. Medium-light body with a gently crisp carbonation. The flavor is balanced, displaying the hops foremost, but backing it with a solid amount of malt. Balancing, very firm bitterness. It finishes dry with some added herbal character. ""Helles"" is certainly not the style designation for this beer (resinous and citrusy hops and ""helles"" just don't go together), it's more of a pils, or even a pale ale - regardless of whether it's lagered or not. Regardless, it's well-done, and drinkable. If the malt were of a better quality this could be a great beer, but as it stands it seems to be simply lack-luster American 6-row.

My excitedly aggro pour created two fingers of puffy, bone white head that resembled to top of a vanilla ice cream cone. The nose was both grassy from the hops and biscuity from the malt and it put me in mind of some of my earliest beer drinking. Color was a gorgeous golden-yellow (SRM = 4) with NE-quality clarity. The unholy trio of Mammon, King Midas and Croesus were suddenly in front of me, clamoring for a sip, but that privilege was mine, all mine! Mouthfeel was soft and it makes me wonder about their water in Wisco. Their beers all have that same softness, which I really like. It makes for great ""drinkability"" and I wish that they would put more of the Leinie line in CANs. The taste was grassy, minty, definitely hoppy, but not confrontationally hopped.

However, Leinenkugal claims this brew to be of hoppy origin, hence the name which is a mistake. The mouth feel is fine and I don't mean FINE. It is what it is. If I could rate this as an American Adjunct, well then this would get some really nice marks, however Leinenkugal is claiming a hoppy complex ""specialty"" and this beer is far from.

The mouth-feel and finish is the high point of this beverage; with its above average thickness and a crisp but lingering finish. There is nothing special about the aroma: A blend of malt that confronts their attempt at making this particular helles heavier than usual on the hops. The overall taste is a slightly (and properly) bitter beer. I'm not sure what the brewery is really attempting here - it comes off as an intriguing experiment with the style tweak, but results in a pretty average experience for the consumer ( similar to mixing Orange Crush soda with Sunkist - oh...it sounds so bold, but at the end of the day it's still orange soda). Let me be clear - I enjoy most of the beers that Leinenkugels offers (Red, Oktoberfest, the Shandy series, et al), but this one is sub-par by comparison. The Hoppin Helles is a good afternoon beer, but when you consider that you can get similar tasting run of the mill domestics (such as Michelob ) for less money, I don't know why you would opt for this more expensive one.","The-Sud-Truth","Nov 11, 2013"

3.64,14.5,4,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Excited to see a light helles with more hops, but I understand it's brewed by Miller ultimately price per six a bit high 9.49 but it was on sale for 7.99. Pours light fizzy yellow but the difference here is the head along with some actual head retention, fine speckled lacing left behind. Aroma has a light citric hop nose with some cereal grains that can't rule out vegetal components of corn/rice. Pretty light on the nose let's see how it's tasting. Generic hop bitterness the label says 5 varieties but I truly can't hone in on one. Grassy herbal are some words with a hint of citrus but it's dumbed down, they are going for a light noble pils style. I can definitely tell you there are some noble hops in this brew. I'm all over it, as far as drinkability and accessibility goes. Mouthfeel is light as in helles light, a bit of fizzy un natural carbonation reminds you that your drinking a macro. Nothing to fault here hoppier than the norm easy to drink I could enjoy this watching a ball game. Not offensive at all, but at the same time there's many better lagers this will be reliable during this season.","WVbeergeek","Sep 14, 2013"

I do stay away from its flavored beers (with the exception of the Summer Shandy, which is good enough to swill), since I rarely like any brewery's flavored beers, and I especially like the original and the Sunset Wheat. But the Hoppin' Helles was pretty terrible. Maybe I had a bad six-pack, but the beer managed to blend together everything I dislike in palish beers. The Hoppin' Helles, first of all, has very little hops to it, but it somehow managed to capture the bitterness of hops but minus the tang that I like. To my tongue, it has a skunkiness of a Kolsch-style lager but without the complexity. And finally, it's rather bland like an American-style lager but somehow lacks the crispness and lightness that makes American lagers so drinkable. I forced the six-pack down and won't buy it again.","MDT187","0"
