"O) Solid Helles, not the best example but available from Majestic Wines for equivalent of £1.60 a bottle; well worth the money."

"Nice beer, crispy, fresh. In my country is a little expensive but sometimes i can find it in beer sales."
"All in all, I would say this is a pretty average lager, which came as a bit of a disappointment to me, as I had been expecting considerably more of a supposedly premium-class German lager."
""
""
"Great Munich Helles, can really taste the malt."
""
"Served in a Pilsner glass"
"Who knows how old this bottle was and how it was stored."
"Great German Helles lager.  Found this when I was exploring various Biergartens in Munich."

"This is a very ""beery"" beer, and one of the best of the style."
"This is an excellent beer. The smell is nice, the taste is nice, and it's one of those beers that I can drink all evening long without feeling the need to switch to a different type."

"Very light, smooth, and drinkable with plenty of cleanly sweet malt and just a little punctuating bitterness. It also has a sour quality, which isn't too appealing."
""

"I'll take a Hofbrau or Spaten over this any day."
"O: Would be great with some bread and cheese."

"11.2 oz bottle 04/15 poured in a pint glass.  Clear yellow, like most lagers.  Huge foam head buildup; took a while to go away.  Smells bready and of malt.  Tastes of chemicals and grain.  Something off-putting about it.  I got a lingering, bitter aftertaste.  I'm going to have to revisit.  It may be due to not having had a lager in quite some time."

"Pours a medium golden color with a slight white head Some lacing left along the glass as you finish. Good amount of carbonation. Smell is sweet, malty, and fresh. Taste is also malty but with a subtle hint of grapes. Medium bodied -- good session beer and a good alternative for someone that feels like getting a lager with a little kick to it but nothing crazy. Paired this with sausage and peppers on the bbq on a hot summer day and it was very enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Pours a pretty golden in color with a good half of a finger foamy white head that settles down to just along the sides of the glass. Some spotty lacing is seen when sipped. Perfect carbonation. The aroma is of bready malts for the most part. The taste has more going on even with a sweet bread taste followed by a slight dry finish. Clean and crisp and goes down easy. No bitter or harsh aftertaste at all. Lighter to medium bodied. Overall a great brew!"
"Final Thoughts: Not quite as great as I was hoping given the freshness and dark bottle. A good example of the style and worth a try if you are a fan of the style. Nothing special but far and above adjunct swill on the market. Would I drink it again? On a hot day."

"Pours a deep, clear gold with a creamy white head. The head has only the barest retention, slightly hanging on around the circumference of the glass and leaving no lacing. The aroma has nice bready malt with hints of earthy hops. The taste is similar, but with just a really good depth to it. It's not complicated, it's just good. The body is not too heavy but has a satisfying weight to it and a light hops bite on the finish. Always a good lager."

"Overall: Beer #3 from the Paulaner mix pack. A solid helles lager, nice balanced flavor and easy to drink. Worth a try if you want a traditional German lager."
"Overall, this is a delicious beer. The smell is nice, the taste is nice, and it is another one of those beers that I can drink all evening long without feeling the need to switch to a different type."

"Nothing exceptional leaps out at you with this beer, but it is tasty, wet, and soothing overall. There's a pleasant marriage with the light, biscuit-like graininess and rounded hop bitterness starting midway through the sip and on past the finish. Probably won't bowl you over in any manner, but most likely won't disappoint you either."

"O - Crisp Helles w/ a good taste, although a little too sweet for the style, IMO. Helles lager's are such a great style of lager in regards to flavor. There are certainly better examples of the style, but it's a decent interpretation of the style."

""

"Overall it is too watery and lacking in flavor, however, it is very pleasant to drink otherwise with no bad qualities. Better than most competitors in it's category."

"O- Likely my favorite of the German Helles, but as wrong as it feels to say, I'll still take Stoudt's Gold Lager."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A very clean, crisp, refreshing beer. I keep this one around for when I'm in the mood for something very light. Have received quite positive feedback from several non-craft beer drinkers so this seems to be a nice gateway beer."

"It's unbelievable to imagine that this is what Budweiser has been trying to make all this time. This is the quintessential bright lager. Nothing heavy, nothing complex. Just the basic, super fresh beer ingredients that leave a light taste in your mouth and you wanting more. This is definitely a beer I would give to my adjunct drinking friends."

"Pale straw yellow in color with perfect clarity. Poured with a short, dense white foam that reduced to a healthy white cap. Earthy grass and bready aromas with light herbal notes in the background. Delicate, creamy smooth feel up front, rich carbonation through the middle and a crisp , tangy finish. Bready malt flavor througbout with light, spicy, herbal hop tanginess through the middle to the end. Finishes crisp and clean with a bready malt aftertaste."

"Poured into a pint glass. Pours golden with a thick white head and plentiful streaming bubbles. The head dissipates slowly. The beer smells of barley malt and some grassiness from the noble hops. The taste follows the nose to the letter. I get those flavors of the malt, which are pretty bready. Those noble hops provide some nice mild grassiness on the back end to help balance the beer. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. The drinkability is very high. This is a very good beer and a solid example of this style."
""
"This is a decent, malty, sessionable beer. It has good flavor but little in the way of hop character. It was enjoyable once, but I'm not sure I'll pick it up again."

"Overall - A very good German lager. Buy some and share it with your friends."

"Very fresh nose with a pretty attractive foamy glossy ricky head. Herbally trace to the taste with an almost light tannic finish. To the eye ressembles ginger ale with a reasonable inner core. Solid summer beer. No pretentions but quality throughout. Very good for what it is."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly murky honey orange with a foamy 1/2 inch bone colored head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain and some grassy and hay aromas. Taste is of grain, grass/hay, and some herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good lager that is quite refreshing and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Great brew, a go to for a traditional, refreshing beer"
""
"A perfectly clear golden beer. It initially has a foamy head of about 2 fingers, but it quickly fades down to a thin covering. The aroma has a grainy, slightly spicy character to it as it enters the nose, like wheat and cloves, and one can also detect banana and European hops as well. The flavor is nice and balanced, with a sturdy malt foundation and just the right amount of hop bitterness. It is light bodied, but feels good coating the mouth and going down. The only negative I find is that there is a tiny bit of a metallic/oxidized off flavor in there sometimes. Overall, this is a staple everyday beer in my refrigerator."

"There is nothing special about this beer. It looks yellow-orangeish in color. It smells of dry malt, bread,wheat. it taste of about the same things.The mouthfeel is crisp, light to medium in body, not very filling which is a good thing for someone wanting to drink a step up from the BMCs. Overall, it's really just an average compare to lets say their Hefeweizen or Oktoberfest which are so much better made beers."

"Poured a very nice clean blonde color,the head a little lacking,however,the nice bread/malty aroma quickly entices all senses. A very mild yet complex odor and taste,just a wonder balance of malt and hops. Very easy to drink,no after taste,overall I love this beer, and many of their other formulas"
"Served from bottle into a shaker. Poured a pale golden yellow with a one finger pure white that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, grain, spices, rice, fruit, and subtle alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, grain, spices, floral, fruit, and very subtle alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. The aroma on this one was definitely not my favorite of this style. However, the flavor did a pretty good job of making up for this. The flavor was really nicely balanced, but wasn’t very complex unfortunately. Worth trying for sure as it is very easy to drink."

"Worthy brew, high drinkability yet tasty, I would buy more to stock my inventory as this beer could be able to match in any occasion."

"Poured into a standard pint glass. The beer is a light straw yellow. A foamy head sits on top and dissipates to an even layer, then a white ring. Smells of lemon grass and faint citrus. The beer tastes like it smells -- A lemony undertone with a crisp citrus finish. The mouthfeel is light, bright, and very drinkable. Overall, this would be a great beer to have at a pub while watching a game. Highly sessionable, very refreshing, and it just tastes really good."

"Overall: A very good representation of style. Not my favorite, but on sale for $3.99 impossible to pass up. Surprising I had not tried this Paulaner offering before; despite my lackluster interest in traditional German styles, this one is worth a second try for me."
"Just turned 21 recently and this was one of the first biers I graded. I had it on tap at the Alpine Village in Torrance, CA. This is still one of the best biers I have ever tried. Clean, solid taste, very smooth and tastes great. I recommend it to everyone."
"Overall not bad, fairly light but should be, nice lager flavors, no real off flavors, the finish gets a bit iffy though with the hops getting a bit to nagging bitter and not much clean or crisp like it started. Also not sure where the haze comes from but it should be fairly clear."
"D- Highly drinkable. Light and clean, with no bad aftertaste. This is a drinkable, refreshing beer."
"O- This is a boring beer. A very drinkable-don't-have-to-think-about-it boring, but still kind of boring."
"O- I like this one... I like a lot of beers but this is up my ally."
"The appearance and smell in the Paulaner Original are fine and what you'd expect. It's good tasting - no long, lingering finish, just grains, malt, a little lemony spice and clean feel on the palate. I can't say I'm not impressed; any beer that tastes just like it should taste works for me. I'd get this again... it's a good anytime beer."
"The Rest: Body is medium for a lager, this is far superior to the BMC lagers. Its slightly grainy without the off-putting adjunct taste with a nice hint of bitterness."
"Good brew overall. Easy to drink, clean taste."
"Overall it's tasty. Would have it again for sure."
"OVERALL: Everything about this beer was quite good, except for the flavor, which is where it really counts. There was nothing off about this one, but the flavor was simply too weak and watery to really be worth drinking. One of the weaker examples of the style. Skip this and reach for a Augustiner when in Munich."
"My brother likes this beer, he says he drank a lot of it in Germany and it was his favorite, so he gave me one to try. Thanks G. It pours golden and is capped with a billowing off-white head, lacing ensues; good look-ing for a lager. The brew is malty in a pale and honey-ish way, and besides that it offers some mineral notes, a herbal bitterness on the finish and a delicate floral aroma. Lively carbonation and refreshing overall; this is a very nice lager."
"O: This is a very good lager from a brewery that also produces one of the best Hefewaizen-beers out there. I would buy this lager again."
"Mouthfeel is crisp, light and dry. Very clean, with little aftertaste. This is a simple and enjoyably refreshing lager. Easy drinking session beer that I would buy again."
"IMO the Germans make the best beer in the world and this fine beer is one of the countries best."
"Clear yellow color with a tall, lasting, lumpy white head on top. Aromas of pale cereal malt, honey, and soft floral noble hops. Grassy/earthy hops and dusty grain greet the tongue...a hint of lemon, finishing with gentle sweetness. Decently crisp, light-bodied, and certainly pound-able. Solid helles..."
"I remember that dry character from the fresh beers in Munich, but it seems to suffer from export/Pasteurization -- becomes sort of harsh, close to astringent. Too bad."
"cheers"
"O=If this were still drinkability, it would get a 4.5. Overall though, its a very run of the mill and unimpressive lager. I'm not drinking lager haterade either, they have grown on me over the past year, but there are much finer German lagers out there than this. If you want a good Paulaner beer, stick with their Hefeweizen, it is delicious."
"RJT"
"O- Highly drinkable and simple but still a beer with some character, and no flaws. The perfect drink if you are looking for something refreshing"
"T: Some slightly stale-tasting grassy hops, pale malts and a pretty heavy metallic taste. The finish is pretty clean and the drinkability is pretty good on this one. Still, it's not one of the better German beers I've had."
"Very good, refreshing lager that I'd be happy to have again."
"Drinkability: This is a nice lager. I am not a huge fan of the style, but I could have several of these."
"Overall, a good, dependable product from Paulaner."
"Opinion: Well, I would have to say that this is a classic example of this style, so it is going to get high marks. There isn't a whole lot for me to say about it, but the subtlety of this beer speaks for the style well. That said, I would take an Augustiner Helles over this any day, but it still a good brew and one of the better malt accentuated beers available here is Texas at the time."
"From notes: Subtle bready notes in the nose. Pours a sparkling clear straw. The mostly lasting white creamy head is super sticky & stiff like meringue, and leaves behind light lace. The flavor is typical of a lager; well balanced but non-descript. Light acidity leads to a grainy finish. The light & creamy body is soft."
"Won't knock off Augustiner as my fave for the style, but nevertheless a solid brew from Paulaner."
"D- Delicious,clean,subtle and restrained. A welcome relief to the over-the-top hop bombs that are all the rage. Vivaldi vs. AC/DC. The epitome of a session beer."
"Nice beer for warm and hot day and party opener"
"Drinkability: very easy to drink this beer. If you are looking for a good lager this will hit the spot."
"I don't get much of a chance to try Helles lagers. This particular one pours a crystal clear light golden color with a quickly dissipating white cap of foam. Very clean. The aroma is subtle, as expected for the style. Barely toasted barley is detectable. Very crisp and clean on the palate. The malt is the highlight, but it gives way to touch of citrus which sticks with the palate after the beer is gone. Drinkable and balanced."
"My friend brought me 6 pack of 12oz bottles. I would not buy it myself. The beer has no color, no smell, no taste. I don't understand how people can drink this. I guess Coors Light would taste like that (if I tried it), but at least that one is cheap."
"drinkability; very drinkable, well balanced and pleasing. One of my favorites of the style. Never had this one in the states, perhaps the quality suffers a bit in transport."
"D- average, nothing special"
"M/D: Drinks smoothly, the taste isnt the best so the drink ability is effected. strong carbonation tingle"
"D- nice feel, pretty good taste, lower alcohol. drinkable."
"Drinkability: Well...this is very good in the drinkability department. While the each of the individual components of this beer are just above average, these things combined are more than the sum of their parts. This beer went really fast - refreshing and outstanding with a meal, and I could easily have another one or two so very sessionable as well. An outstanding drinkable beer. Thank goodness I got a six pack of this."
"What a classy frat party. Tee-hee. It pours a clear pale golden straw topped by a nice finger of thick white froth. The nose comprises flowers, very light lemon wedge, and light wheat. The taste holds notes of coriander, lemon wedge, lots o' grasses, wheat, and flowers. The body is light, with a light moderate carbonation and a refreshing feel. Overall, a nice helles, the quality probably due to the freshness, which I've never seen in a stateside German beer before."
"This was an incredibly fresh batch of this stuff. It appeared as pale as you'd expect this beer to be, but it rocked a nice finger or so of the head as well. The aromas were a bit off, they smelled quite strongly of hops that were getting close to being too old as well as a serious amount of pale malt aroma. The taste however was rather straight forward and real pleasant. The hops tasted rather fresh still on the palate and the malts were savory and crisp. On a side note, I was so happy, because I was later able to consume bratwurst which works so well with that fresh on the palate. The mouth feel was a bit syrupy, but then again this was old school from the keg who knows how the carbonation worked. It still tastes really fresh and went down so very smooth. It was one hell of a good beer."
"The mouthfeel is also very clean with a light touch of bubbles and slight hop bitterness. An easy drinker that is all around above average. This one goes down easy and has some nice mild flavor to it. I can sit and drink on this one all night."
"Very easy to drink, it is refreshing and can be enjoyed as a social beer. Very little complexity but tastes good for the flavor that it has. I would buy it again as a beer to share with friends who do not like very complex beer."
"D Good beer, would have another. 3.5 "
"pretty good. doesn't have great flavor but decent. the combo of that with it being light, crisp and refreshing makes it an easy beer to drink. a good sessionable beer."
"D: Very easy to drink and even easier to order a second before you are half way done your first."
"Since it is officially Oktoberfest in Munich now I figured on getting a slew of German beers to celebrate. This one is the first stop. Nice golden yellow with an egg shell head. Crackery, grain, clean and crisp with a little hop kick at the end. Pretty simple but so damn good. A nice place to start. I love the Paulaner lineup of brews."
"O: High drinkability. Paulaner quality. Great German Lager. Excellent session beer"
"Pours a pale golden yellow colour with about a finger of head. Nice retention. Smell is of floral hops with biscuity malt. The malt and hops both seem to come out more in the flavour than in the smell. Very well balanced lager. I had this right after the Paulaner Premium Pils and prefered this."
"Decently drinkable beer with some flaws, but it certainly isn't bad by any means. No reason to get overly excited, but give it a try if the price is right. I've had better and worse from the style, but definitely had better from Paulaner."
"Drinkable, but boring. Same as any other yellow beer. I prefer Weihenstephaner Original over this any day."
"This beer is definitely one that can be enjoyed by anybody. Probably a good introduction to better beer for the uninitiated. I can imagine making this a regular session beer."
"All in all, a very good lager."
"A good beer for a scorching hot day. This lager appears a light yellow color. Bubbles rise rapidly from the bottom of the pilsner glass. There is a pretty average sized head that fades rapidly, leaving a thin coating of lacing on the glass. The smell is pretty straight forward and simple. Pilsner malt and a slightly sweet flavor comprise the taste and the aroma. The feel is pretty thin, as expected. This beer is crisp, refreshing and very easy to drink. There are no off flavors or astringent notes that I detect. Overall, a plain, simple, decent tasting brew that goes down easy."
"Paulaner Lager has a refreshing appearance with shades of pale gold. The head wanes but leaves a consistent thin layer supported by carbonation streamers. The bouquet is similar to the smell of yeast bread. The taste is crisp, balanced with a little yeast and sweetness, and a slight hops floral jumps in the mouth. The texture is light and smooth. This lager is very drinkable and could be a designated hitter for the entire night."
"Drinkability: the flavor is good, and the beer is somewhat drinkable, but the lack of a decent mouthfeel really hurts this one for me. I'm thinking I'll have to try this beer again sometime down the road; perhaps there were bottling issues with this batch."
"More muted banana taste, pricklier feel, be it from the hops or the carbonation. Taste certainly exceeded appearance, some lemon came in. Light bodied, lightly hopped, little bitterness, but close to full flavored, a decent hot weather beer. Kind of pricey for what you get."
"Is this all you could ever want in a beer? The short is 'yes' (with an ""if..."") and the long answer is 'no' (with a ""but...""). Paulaner Münchner is a simple, if conventional, beer but it's emblematic of Germany's outstanding tradition of crafting clean, agreeable, insanely quaffable lagers - which is about all you could want from a typical beer."
"Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. This beer is a pounder. You can drink one right after another easily. I wish I had one of those Bierstiefel boot shaped mugs"
"D - This is a good lager. I couldn't believe that I had never tried/purchased it. I always assumed that I had tried all of Paulaner's regular lineup. This was worth buying."
"excellent beer to substitute for bad macro brews. all the companions are there but mild. the head is not as voluminous as a proper german lager. but the nice is a mild apple yeasty. a very balanced beer in body and palate with nice light fizz. palate of gentle hops and a soft sweet finish with a bit of earth."
"overall: hits the spot on a hot summer day a very refreshing beer no off flavors and grain notes to speak of. a good beer."
"A very easy drinking and sessionable lager with just a classic ""beer"" profile. I can see myself drinking a lot of this in the company of friends or at a party. Light and mild but tasty, just what you look for in this kind of beer. In all respects above average."
"This isn't a bad beer, just not that exciting. Much better on tap if you can find it. Fairly typical of this style of beer."
"D= session session session"
"Crisp, clean, nicely carbonated; a great quencher. Body is pretty light though there is plenty of flavor within, and drinkability is very high indeed."
"I was very impressed with this beer. I wasn't expecting too much out of it. It pours like a very traditional beer - it is a lovely shade of gold with foamy white head that laces the glass. By no means will this beer blow you away. There isn't a great deal of flavor, but the little flavor it has is pleasing. There is little aftertaste which makes this very easy to drink. I can imagine it would be easy to drink many of these beers in one sitting. This is a very good beer that shouldn't be overlooked."
"This is a world class brewery perhaps best known for its hefe weizen. This is a very satisfying helles, just not at the very top of the style."
"A fine helles for sessions...I think I like this better than the Hacker edelhell."
"Notes: What can really be said about a beer such as this? It's not flashy. It won't knock your socks off. But then again, that's not really the point with a beer of this sort. Paulaner Original is just plain old good beer, so I'm going to drink up."
"A bit on the watery/thin side, just a little lighter than appropriate. Carbonation seems spot on. The brew is damned drinkable."
"Easy drinking, can go well with food, or great on a summer day. Good simple beer. After 2, you'd want something more interesting, but you'd never knock this either. Decent."
"Conclusion: Is it crazy complex? Nope. Does it need to be? Nope. This beer would make for a nice daily drinker, perfect with German food or pizza."
"D: A very easy drinker that it the essence of what a lager should taste like. Nothing bad to say here. As clean a lager as they come. Spot on for the style."
"D - Very easy to drink. Light enough that it is easy to drink a lot of it."
"Notes: Somewhat like a lager (especially in the body) but more bready and more hops than the Macros. A little thin for a wheat beer, but good beer."
"D- Highly drinkable, refreshing. Not as good as other Paulaner options, especially the ones you can get in Germany...but a great beer none the less."
"Wouldn't be one of my first preferences (would generally prefer something with more flavour, even for a basic lager) but works well for the style and is enjoyable."
"Poured a straw yellow with good carbonation, lots of bubbles rising to the top, nice white head. Looks good. Nose is grains, light hops, some citrus. Taste is grains, light hops, floral and a bit of citrus, maybe light honey, hardly any booze. No bite, just easy drinking and very tasty. Wow. I could drink alot of this, not because of low ABV but because it is tasty and crisp."
"D- Goes down super smooth. Very very sessionable. Particularly in the wamer weather."
"Pours a crystal clear pale yellow with a medium white head that fades fast. Smells of fresh dough and a hint of sulfur. Taste is bready sweetness up front, with a very herbal earthy middle, and a bittersweet finish. Mouthfeel is slightly thin, medium carbonation. Drinkability is quite good, I suspect if American macro brewers did not create their beers to be so bland, they would taste similar to this."
"Look: Yellow nector color, apparently cloudy, very white and fat foamy head; Smell: Sweet malt and toffee essences; Taste: Sweet malt, slightly smoky and spice, create notes to bitter olives; Mouthfeel: Refreshing and bittersweet, medium body; Drinkability: Reminds me Birra Moretti, very easy to drink."
"Nice bubbly body head, rather fluffy; I consider average. The body was Golden wheat in color. It has a very smooth mouthfeel; you get a good tingle when it runs down the back of your tongue. Has a very sweet taste with a hint of bitterness. I really enjoyed this Beer. This Beer has given me a new sense of hope for Lagers. I never had a good lager but now that I found one and it has inspired me to not completely right them off."
"D: Overall, a very satisfying brew that goes well with an evening meal."
"D: Easy to have a few as it isn't too heavy and has the typical bitter aftertaste of a lager but there is nothing too special."
"Taste defines grainy, freshly crushed light malted barley is dominant. There is some light floral and grassy hop flavors to help balance things out a bit. This is one of the cleanest beers I have ever had, amazing job by the brewers to eliminate any off-flavors. This is a very good Helles lager and one I would love to try fresh from the source."
"Cheers"
"Overall - Definitely on the lower end of the flavour scale of European lagers, but still a quality Helles."
"Overall, this is a pretty solid lager. I think I may have gotten an older bottle based on other reviews, since I hardly noticed the hops in this one. I'll definitely try it again and see but this would be a great beer to drink while eating a pizza and watching a game."
"This was my first time drinking this particular beer and I am duly impressed. Another fine product that will always have a home in my fridge."
"D=very drinkable, could definitely enjoy quite a few of these on a poker night."
"Feel good in the mouth and is refreshing."
"D : Overall, its a really good beer of the style, one of the best I've had. Very refreshing and very memorable. The fruitiness is outstanding."
"d - even tho' it's a bit chilly here today, this beer downright tastes great. could (will???) drink several of these, esp on a nice warm day with burgers, hot dogs or even a pizza"
"Pours a clear golden yellow, nice rich colour, big and thick white head forms, slowly settles down to a thick ring around the glass, good layer, good lacing, great retention on this one. Smell is nice, really toasty and biscuity, caramel, honey, pretty intense aroma, tons of biscuit and toast character, some floral, really well done, very clean. Taste is similar, nice sweet malty character up front, honey and some caramel, big biscuity middle, burnt toast, floral, very clean and malty, popcorn, nice clean herbal bitter finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, very nice helles and very drinkable. I really dig this stuff."
"Overall - A nice Munich Helles Lager for a good price. A perfect option for something refreshing and sessionable, or perhaps a good beer to have BMC fans give a shot :)"
"I can't help but feel that the problem here is one of freshness with the long journey from Europe taking its toll on the quality of this beer."
"D: Another solid brew that has mass appeal and can be enjoyed by all. An enjoyable offering that goes well with pizza, football, and good friends. Recommended as safe option which is very approachable to a wide audience."
"I was not very impressed by this beer. Poured a nice golden color with a decent aroma. The major complaint I have with this beer was in its drinkability and mouthfeel. I had a whole 6 pack in 1 sitting and it just sat way too heavy for a beer of this style."
"This beer pours exactly like a nice pilsner,a pale see thru straw colour with nice carbonation that leaves a fast vanishing two finger head and a ring of lacing,the aroma is average with smells of malted barleyish coated hops,it has an average mouthfeel with a barleyish hop taste,definately not the best example of the style that ive tried and tastes more like a pilsner but in saying that could easily drink this as a nice session beer."
"Grainy and sweet on the nose with a bit of barnyard going on, which settles out with a bit of exposure. Nice sweet hop nose when agitated a bit. Taste follows and is somewhat simple sweet for the style, not offering a lot of body or depth to the malt structure. Rather crisp nonetheless and with a lingering light lemon finish. Light body limits this beer however."
"Typical appearance for the style; I'd have a pretty difficult time rating the appearance of any munich helles or pilsener a '5' since they all look more or less the same. Smell is wonderful - fresh, clean and crisp, with spicy noble hops making their presence known. Taste is fantastic - crisp and tart with just enough malt sweetness to balance. I love it! Ample carbonation suits this brew well. Highly drinkable, this beer always does it for me. A favorite to be sure, severely underrated in my opinion. Call me crazy, but to me this is comparable to Weihenstephaner original - only much easier to find."
"D - easy to drink, nice and refreshing, crisp and clean. Could easily drink a couple"
"The beer was light bodied with the classic taste of a German pilsner beer. Very drinkable session beer, that is very refreshing. Glad I have a sixer."
"Too watery!"
"This Helles is very traditional, a bit bland overall, but clean with no off flavors. I could drink it on a hot day for sure, but it's not exactly a session beer as I would get bored easily. Worth a try..."
"Not the most complex lager I've had, which is a good thing when you want something easy & refreshing to drink."
"A dark golden color with white foamy head. The taste and aroma were sweeter than I imagined, a bit more malty than hoppy. A medium-medium body. It was very smooth with just a bit of crispness. I'm definitely going back for more of these."
"Notes: A session brew with a solid drinkability."
"I was new to the Helles style lager when I tried this, and came away thinking this was a slightly above average beer. It felt thin on the tongue but still had a decent taste of hops. Was very drinkable, excellent for a hot summer day. One of the better pale lagers I have enjoyed."
"Light, crisp and refreshing feel plus good taste make this a very easy beer to drink."
"D: Great session beer, if not a terribly complex one. Not my favorite Paulaner beer, but a nice representation of the style. The low ABV makes this beer go down very easy."
"Quite a good beer really, possibly deserves to score higher, I just found it a little boring. Weihenstephaner makes a better, tastier helles lager."
"Overall: Very light easy drinking beer with a sutle malt sweetness. I could drink a few of these but I only bought one pint."
"this spring (so far)"
"D: give me a twelve pack of these and i would be glad to finish them any time."
"A great big 2 finger head over the pale gold body sure looks the part. A hoppy nose albeit seems to getting on a bit in freshness. Slight touch of lemon in the background with a niggling smell of Weet Bix (that would be a cereal aroma).Drinks light,creamy and smooth with a mild bitterness. A nice long finish with a pleasant aftertaste. I'd definitely drink it again."
"This helles is totally well balanced with not too much carbonation that it drowns out the taste. This leaves the palate very refreshed and ready to have some more. I wish I would've tried this beer sooner. God Bless Paulaner!"
"Drinkability: This is easily drinkable and I could easily see having a few in the heat of summer or with friends while sitting around chatting, etc."
"Nice smooth drinker, with good fizzy carbonation and some light cereal/barley/grapenut grain in the malt profile. Hops are crisp, slightly metallic, and a nicely spicy. This is one very well balanced beer, utterly true to the Helles Lager style, and soooo drinkable! Delicious!"
""
"drinkable enough."
"Light mouthfeel, goes down easy. Definitely one of my favorite Helles Biers from Munich, especially among the ""big brewers."""
"if you want to compare it to its brother Hacker Pschorr lager just not that everything about the hacker pschorr lager would be stronger and more flavorful"
"I like this one a lot, though I think I slightly prefer Spaten over this. Definitely will be having it again."
"I'm a big fan of the German Helle Lagers typically, but this fails on every front."
"Poured a pale straw colour with very little head that dissappeared almost instantaneously. Had very little lacing. Smelled like straw with a bit of a corn aroma. Taste and smell are pretty much the same. Has a slight bitter aftertaste that lingers. Very thin mouthfeel and quite watery with a fair bit of fizz. It is drinkable but not one of my favourites."
"This is a slightly better than average lager. No off flavors or scents, but it just needed a little something extra to make me want to go out of my way to have another."
"Drinkability : an average beer in the style Munich Helles lager."
"D - Certainly an easy-drinking beer though not as drinkable as some of the better examples of this style. I could take a second pint but that's about it."
"pretty good drinkability."
"Decent atmosphere, good flavor, light body. Not overwhelming on the alcohol gives this great drinkability. Good quaff."
"Foam is creamy,I would just appreciate it would last much more,carbonation too is easily lost giving a bad taste to the last sips."
"D- Balance taste with a crisp mouthfeel make this one pretty drinkable for me."
"Drinkability: Smooth and creamy, with enough flavor to make it interesting. Not my favorite style, but a classic example of this style."
"This beer has a very sweet and grainy aroma. It is a bit grassy but not as grassy as some other beers of this style. It has a straw gold color that has an almost ivory colored head and lace. The flavor is crisp and for the most part malty. There is very earth but mild spicy flavor. This is a very clean and light beer I would say that it is refreshing and versatile."
"At the time of consuming this beer, I was not ""wasted."" But I cannot honestly say I tasted this with a fresh palate. I will re-review this beer at a later time."
"Sweet grainy aroma, pretty subdued. Light golden pour, mild head with some minimal lacing and nice steady carbonation. Crisp with a touch of sourness to the mouthfeel, rather refreshing. Nice taste, lightly hopped to a light malt content. Sweet and grassy, it's tasty but I enjoyed the Harp I had prior to this much more."
"D- Great like beers in this style. Something about the light characteristics make is very drinkable"
"Easy drinking lager. Pretty representative of the style."
"A clean, light bodied beer paired with a good carbonation level that crisps things up and creates an easy drinking beer. Something that is meant to be enjoyed by the liter, this is surely the thing for the job."
"It is very drinkable and enjoyable , preferably served quite cold"
"A fine beer with many of the characteristics I look for in a lager. It had a nice light golden color while retaining a small head with light lacing down the glass. I like the nice maltiness in the smell. The taste is smooth, while being crisp and having a medium/light weight on the palate. The malt flavor is balanced nicely by the hops on the back end. I can drink a whole lot of these."
"D - I don't drink a lot of lagers, but I could drink several of these. Very nice."
"Taste is malty with hop finish making this beer unobjectionable but not remarkable. It would be nice to try this on tap really fresh."
"Pours a clear yellow, huge fluffy white head which fades fairly quickly. Clumps of sticky lacing. Smell: light malts, slight grassy/spicy hop, yeast, hint of banana. Taste: toasted malt, the yeast again, grassy hops in finish. Mouthfeel: soft carbonation, light bodied, finishes a bit dry. A solid, highly drinkable lager."
"d: a nice, simple german lager. won't hurt your brain thinking about this one. you pretty much get what you expect: a well made, easy to drink, unoffensive, fairly plain lager."
"M/D: This one is best cold, and I enjoyed it that way. A unique beer and a quite good one at that."
"I don't want to have children with it, but I liked it."
"4/4/4/4/4.5"
"This beer pours a clear golden color. The head is bright white, fluffy, and recedes very slowly into thick, chunky lacing. The aroma is of bready malt, mild noble hops, and a hint of metal. The taste is breadier than the aroma with only a trace of hops. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with nice, lively carbonation. Overall, this is a fine Helles that I would certainly drink again."
"Pours a crisp pale yellow with a nice white head that recedes quickly but leaves good lacing. Nose is slightly skunked malt and grain. Taste follows with good grain, slight skunk, a nice hop kiss, and some good grassy finish with slight apple. Nice and crisp. Mouthfeel is good, maybe slightly thick. Drinkability is very good here, as this is certainly a good choice for a summer slammer. Good lager."
"This is a good beer maybe not my favorite beer from Paulaner but nonetheless not bad at all. Taste some citrus in it and I feel the taste was very light which is good for summer."
"D: Way easy to drink. This would go with a variety of food and occasions any time of year. Very refreshing."
"Very bready aroma and taste...this is notthing fancy, but is a damn solid beer. Would pair well with all sorts of different foods and its really sessionable. This is a good example of a German lager."
"D. This is not a particularly heavy beer to me, but has wonderful flavors and smells. If you're with a drinking buddy this is a fine 'relax and chat' brew."
"Overall, I did not like this one. I was unimpressed with it because of the other great beers that Paulaner brews."
"A well done light beer, though maybe not the best."
"Well it was good and I would drink it if it was offered, but just not alot to remember, and it filled me up more than expected for the style"
"Crisp and refreshing with outstanding drinkability."
"D: Six pack worthy by all means making for a great summer drinking lager which was crisp and refreshing and the perfect session lager"
"On the palate is light bodied, crisp, clean refreshing lager that focuses towards the malt, but is nonetheless very light and refreshing in flavor. This is what a pale lager should be. Amazing!"
"The aroma is your typical yeasty lager, a bit of wheat aroma, a bit of grassy hop in there too. The taste is a tad bit lemony, grassy, a bit chewy, not all that crisp. There is a slight honey like sweetness, a touch of some sourish notes, but both are very subtle characteristics. I'm actually getting more grassy aromas as the beer settles. This is a very light bodied, refreshing beer. The finish and aftertaste are both quite mild. This is a very nice, traditional lager. L'Chaim."
"Not a bad beer, but probably the worst thing I've had from Paulaner to date."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Bottled in 01/08 clearly noted on label. Pours a pale golden yellow color with a lot of tiny little bubbles rising to the top to support a thin white head with sporadic lacing. The aroma is a soft and clean with grainy malt and a touch of grassy hops. The taste is very clean and refreshing and similar to the aroma with some grainy malt and a nice dry crispness from the hops. The mouthfeel is light bodied and very heavily carbonated. Overall, this is a classic over and Germany and I can see why. It is very drinkable, and would be great to enjoy in the warm outdoors while eating a bratwurst."
"This is easily my favorite beer. It has a nice full body, great odor and color, and tastes like heaven. This is what beer is supposed to taste like, so it's no surprise that this beer is the local favorite of Munich. It's a little diminished bought when bought in the States, but nothing can beat drinking a liter of this beer in the biergarten."
"Bottle pours a clear, golden body with a small vanilla head that falls into some delicate silky lacing. Aroma is somewhat restrained, featuring floral and spicy hops and some toasted grain. Light medium in body with a crisp carbonation. Taste is dominated by a spicy hop bitterness that is never out of check. Sweet toasty malt sweetness provides an ideal balance. Hints of golden apple fruitiness add interest. One of the most drinkable lagers in the world and a true classic."
"Clean and pure- tough to argue with a classic. The beer pours an inviting straw color with froathy, white head formation and very good retention while lacing periodically. Aromas of soft pilsner malts balance well against a complementary cereal grain flavor that doesn't seem to deter. Spicy, earthy Saaz hops are undeniable-- pungent and grassy. Flavors favor the malts, but balanced once again with the raw barley flavors and spicy hop notes even deep into the finish. Clean and light on the palate; nearly airy. Thirst quenching, refreshing, crisp in the finish and a smooth spicy hop lingering. This beer begs to be sessioned on these 90+ degree days."
"D = Good drinkability, very refreshing and light."
"It has a similar, rich taste and a full body. It has strong toasted grain and bread, light honey sweetness, lemony citrus, and hint of pine. A full sweetness is balanced with pleasant light bitterness to the end, with a finish of bread and hops. Full of subtle complexity and lasting flavours, it is a little oily, very smooth, and incredible drinkable. It's also very clean."
"Overall, something I'd go to when I need something cleansing and easy to drink."
"nice bite of carbonation, but too watery for what i would like. smooth and nice means you could continue on these, however. not my favorite style by any means, but a pretty decent lager for what it is."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable because of the crispness."
"Had at Molly's after my Pre-Employment screen ... fun times .. Nice Bitters ... has a good solid flavour ... not as crisp as one would think, more like an ale in someways ... on the house after that crap leight.... seems to be a middle of the road beer."
"O: No-nonsense Helles lager that tastes great."
"Infinitely more drinkable than your average American macro."
"Probably make a decent session beer at a local pub in Germany. It's taste is boring, but it's easy to drink. In most places, I'm sure you can find better though."
"Nice foam as I poured it into my pint glass. Pale golden . Sweet aroma, bready and nice. Starts with a sweet malt flavor and then there are some hops to keep it in balance, although there could be more hops. Nice aftertaste. Good as a session helles, especially on a summer day."
"D: This one is easy to drink since there is no strong taste or alcohol burn. Since its light and refreshing it can be drank easily."
"D- what lacks in other aspects certainly makes up for itself if D. crisp and bright and thirst quenching, but even with a hard pour i'm burpin every few minutes."
"""Brilliant old gold color. Sweet honeyed raisin nut bread dough aromas. A round entry leads to a tangly light to medium body with sweet lemon, tangerine, toast and golden raisin flavors. Finishes with a gentle, sweet citurs and mineral fade. Not too bad."
"Munich Helles is a brand that is certainly losing its favour even in its hometown. Paulaner is no exception. While this beer is miles ahead of most modern lagers, Paulaner many decades ago set the bar very high. It's current state shows that it is evolving into a Euro lager. Again, not a bad beer -just a disappointing one."
"Pours a crisp gold with a rapidly settling white head. Faint malt aroma, vary faint wood aroma. Drinks clean, with very little aftertaste. True to style - malt first, hops second. Medium carbonation. Excellent session beer. Not my favorite Helles, but it is readily obtainable, reasonably priced, and goes with most spring/summer fare."
"-Oelergud"
"D - Refreshing, but light even for a Munich Hells Lager, was hoping for more from this beer."
"Pours straw gold with a short white head, no real retention. The aroma is a bit too mild, but still nice and appropriate for the style with sulfur and pale grains. The flavor, however, and this is why this style is so different from the American macro, is full-flavored with sweet, pale grains, mild hops, minerals from hard water, and lager character. The Weihenstephaner is a little richer, but this is still a great beer."
"D- tasty and sessionable lager, solid offering for style"
"D - Very good, I could enjoy having a few of these with dinner, and could even comfortably make a night of it. Definitely worth a try."
"Excellent drinkability due to the light ABV and crisp flavor which was very refreshing and would prove to be quite a thirst-quencher on a hot, humid, Summer day... Nice stuff... Worth a shot..."
"Pours slightly light golden with decent quickly fading head. Smell is a nice mix of light hops, and malty sweetness. Taste is honey malt sweetness, light to medium bitter hoppiness. Slightly thin with a minimal malty yeast finish to it. Overall this is very drinkable. A very beery beer, and enjoyable although not really unique. Kind of Pilsner like, I thought, and I could drink this again."
"I wouldnt say a BAD beer, just one that is definetly not for my taste buds."
"This is a true lager, what beer is suppose to taste like. Any one that likes beer will like this. It is a good strong style, with nothing fancey. No fruit, no spice, just beer. If you want a beer exceptional drinkability you will love this. If your still drinking the likes of Bud and Coors this makes a great beginner beer into the world of real beer."
"This brew pours to a golden yellow color with a thick frothy white head that had a low retention and left just spotty lacing at the top of the glass. The aroma seems to have pronounced grain presence, sort of a grass like smell? The taste goes along with the aromas, a grainy flavor of grass seems to come out. Slight sweet feel. Finishes with a slight hop to it that goes well. Not one of my favorite brews but had it and though I would review it. Probably a lower grade for me than most, just because I don't think very highly of it. Not a brew I would actively track down."
"Pours a clear yellow/gold with tight 1 1/2"" head, Leaves a light lace on side of glass. More hop aroma and mouthfeel than typical American lager. Taste seems weak and watery at first but more pleasant with each sip. Hops are a little more predominate than malt. This is a good session beer."
"Clear golden appearance. Nice finger head that disappears somewhat quickly but leaves a good bit of lacing. Smells of banana and some other fruit I can't put my finger on. Almost smells TOO much like a weizen (maybe it's supposed to and I'm missing something?). Good flavor with banana gangbanging my tastebuds. Mild hoppy flavor in the background but mostly banana. Smooth light feel to it with a clean brisk palate. Great session beer that's easy to enjoy all afternoon. Not much of a celebratory beer but much better than an MBC as a grass cutting beer."
"Drinkability: A good lager. Easy to drink, it has some taste, but should appeal to a macro drinker. Less than 5% ABV, its sessionable as well. I wish there were more (and better) domestics available like this. As I stated previously, this is one of the fresher Oringinal Munchners I have seen, and its three months old."
"When you consider most of the beer drunk in the world is related to this style of beer you realise that this is a very good example of the style. One of the nicest lagers I have tried though not widely available."
"Golden light-headed lager with many tiny bubble fizzing to the top. No overpowering aromas jump out at you. Just hints of the basic ingredients consistant with the German Purity Law of 1516 can be detected. That's how a basic lager is supposed to be. That's all I'm looking for here. The taste is exactly what a lager is supposed to be as well. There's a hint of bitterness. Thin and moderately carbonated and very easy to drink. I like it. Good lager. Not as good as Sam Adams, but good."
"Appearance is a Golden, transparent lager with 20-30 very small carbonation bubbles rising from below. Poured into glass with very slight head which dissapeared within 30 seconds. Smell is hoppy, mildly alcohlic but dissappointingly average. I was not impressed with taste. To me it is a slight step above Miller Genuine Draft in terms of taste. Mouthfeel also very average, again reminds me of MGD. Because of its similarity to MGD its drikability is just average as well. I was dissapointed in this beer as it was recommended and I expected better from a Munich Brewer like Paulaner."
"Pours a very light color of gold and very clear. The soft looking white head grows past 1/4 inch, but then falls into a thin layer of head with no lacing. The breadiness is very nice in the smell. Aromatically soft and sweet breadiness. Very nice. The taste is crisp and clean with good breadiness, the taste has fresh bread and it's very nice. The mouthfeel is crisp and slightly harsh with carbonation, but not by much. Overall, this is a very good beer and I'm glad to get it without any off flavors."
"D: Not a style I'm very familiar with or very fond of but this beer isn't that bad, not that I thought it was going to be, it's just a nice servicable malty lager, nuff said."
"Bottled on 07/07. Pours a pale gold with a white head that hangs around for a while. Bittering hops and crackery malt make up for the smell with a bit of honey backing things up. Bittering hops are more present in the taste and call me crazy, but have a very green taste to the them. This is the freshest I've had this beer before. Hops up front and in the finish too atop crackery malt and mild grain taste. Honey and light pear juice are present too. Medium bodied for a helles with a perfect amount of carbonation. Drinkability is like givin birth on Labor day. Color me impressed?"
"I had this on-tap in a bistro in Salzburg, Austria. I learned much about beer on my trip to Europe, but the central lesson was that a lager can actually be a pleasurable experience, as opposed to America, where microbreweries are ale-heavy and the only lagers are along the lines of Budweiser and PBR. And this was the best lager that I had. Rich and bready, almost like a meal, yet with the smooth drinkability inherent to the lager style. Really something that has to be experienced abroad (akin to Heineken)."
"Poured into a stange, it looks like your typical yellow lager with a dismal head. This brew is a little sweeter than your typical helles lager, so those who prefer a hoppier lager may want to go for something else, as the hop flavor is minimal at best. It's a little light, making it a good choice for a warm day when you need something to wet your whistle."
"Overall: refreshing, elegant and pleasant beer. I was expecting a little bit more body, but I would like to have another one."
"After drinking both lagers back to back...this one wins out. It is a smooth drink that goes down lightly"
"I just reviewed two beers back to back in hopes of discovering which was the better Munich Helles Lager. I reviewed the Hacker-Pschorr Munich Gold and Paulaner Original Munich. Too be honest, I could not find a difference between the two of them. Both were very solid and good beers, nothing spectacular. Honestly, there is such subtle differences between the two beers that I ended up rating them exactly the same. So I tried to discover which is better, and I'm sorry to report, there is not much a difference, but both are good solid beers..."
"The beer is quite chilled right now, which causes it to be quite crisp, with a biting bitterness and a cracker-like malt character. At this temperature the beer is quite dry. As it warms up a bit a soft, though simple, malt sweetness becomes present as does a touch of butterscotch. The hop character opens up a bit more; it leans towards grassy notes with perhaps a hint of lemon zest. The perception of bitterness really is muted once the beer warms up as well, though it still provides a sharp backbone to the flavor profile. Somewhat light bodied, but still has a touch of structure and body to it. A decent beer, which is probably even better fresh."
"D- I would be able to enjoy this beer for the better part of the evening, but I wouldn't recommend eating a ton of food with this as it will do a good job filling your stomach up on its' own. Very flavorful and unique, I'd recommend this one to anyone looking for something slightly sweet and with a little umph!"
"I really like their weiss beer, so I decided to give this a try. Poured golden yellow, with pretty decent head that lasted a while. Not bad, but no real characteristic that stood out. Very drinkable, however. Very smooth and would make a good session beer."
"I had this on tap, 1L mass, in the Seehaus beer garden in Munich (Englischer garten). This was definitely the best location to enjoy the beer, in its own element as it were. The beer was pale yellow straw color, the real show (in terms of appearance) being the massive swirling poof of foam on top. The smell was light and malty, maybe you could imagine honey in the aroma (could be the color of the beer or surroundings that did that to me). The flavor was simple but delicate, malt with a nice carbonation tickle and a hint of hops bite on the back-end. Just about right for the syle I think. Incredibly drinkable in a beautiful beer garden by a lake, this is one to remember fondly."
"D: Very good, typical of a lager of this type, very refreshing and easy to drink, straightforward, what you see is what you get, but a great example of the Munich Helles Lager type."
"Pours a clear straw color with a rather large soapy white head that left some nice rocky lacing. The smell has a light noble hop aroma, peppery. The taste is very light but very refreshing. Again some light noble hop taste and a light dry cracker like malt. The feel is light and well carbonated, no offensive flavors on the palate. A very drinkable lager, very light tasting, but a great thirst quencher."
"A real nice pils with a hoppy nose, clean crisp finish but with a complexity that other lagers often seem to miss. A great summer beer that is more than patio fodder. I hope this shows up in BC since I got this in Winnipeg. The hops show up at just the right time to let you know that the brewer knows his business"
"Drinkability: Found this beer bland and disappointing. Thought I was drinking a light beer."
"Pours a fairly light and perfectly clear straw-yellow, with a good-sized pure white head that lasts reasonably well and leaves some lacing. Smell is clean and grassy, light hops with some grainy malts and a light sweetness as well. Nice, but not anything extraordinary. Taste is along the same lines: light noble hops and a well done malt profile, but nothing out of the ordinary. Mouthfeel is crisp, well carbonated, and refreshing, and drinkability is very good. A very nice lager, well made and easy to drink on a hot day."
"The taste was a nice, clean, smooth, balanced maltiness without a lot of bitterness. Dryer than anticipated based on the smell. A very crisp, easy-drinking beer. Actually, the drinkability is off the charts. I'm not going to seek this out if I'm in the mood for intellectual stimulation from my beverage. But it would sure be nice to have a few more of these around on a warm night watching a ballgame. And it would certainly pair well with a dinner salad on the deck. Not big enough to overpower a lighter meal."
"Crisp and easy drinking with decent balance and a little bitterness up front. Carbonation is a little high, as expected, but this finishes smooth and is an enjoyable session beer. The extra bubbles make me burp more than usual."
"Falls down in the smell category big time, but it's a very nice beer to drink and would make a great session beer. Wish I had bought some more of these."
"Good balance, crisp finish. An excellent beer. Refreshing, flavoursome, and moreish"
"Pours a faded gold with a foamy head that subsides eventually. Lives thick strings of lacing on the glass. Smells of bready malts, mild grain, earthy hops, and a very mild whiff of alcohol. Tastes of light honeyed bread, juicy light fruits, and tea hops. Body is solid and appropriately bubbly. Awesome drinkability. This bottle didn't last but about 5 minutes."
"12 oz. bottle- color of golden yellow , with a frothy white head - nose of hay , grass , mild floral hopps , malt , and slight skunk  taste of bubblegum , sweet malts, and light hopps - body smooth , crisp , and medium carbonation  aftertaste of grassy , and slight resin"
"A world classic that, to me, was better in the past. I don't know if it's my changing tastes, or if it just isn't made the same as it used to be (or a combination). Still in all, a decent lager that makes for an easy ""session"" choice."
"D - I dunno...I was disappointed...thankfully it was my last of the evening as I became the DD midway through the night."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, not very filling, good representation of style, this is a nice light and refreshing beer. I could stick with this beer for a while. I normally prefer something with a bigger kick, but it’s a very good choice if I want something lighter."
"D - Good. I could session this fo' sho'."
"Drinkabiliby - Very drinkable, but not very impressive. Hopefully, I just got a bad bottle. It's hard to believe Paulaner would consistantly release a beer this unimpressive. That said, it's a nice, easy drinking beer that would be good on a hot day."
"D - The beautiful taste of the munich malt holds a special place in my heart making this Munich Helles a favouite with me, however this offering is pretty crap, Very watery. Ive had this beer, drinking from the bottle in a Munich Nightclub which had more flavour. Will get some more bottle of it and re-review. I have had the Urtyp Version of this by the bottle and this was excellent, will need to do a direct comparison to find the true champion"
"Maybe I am warming up to this style, who knows. Paulaner is a great beer company and makes nothing except top of the line beers. This one pours a rich, deep, golden color with a craggy head. The head cools down quickly not leaving much lacing, either. Smells of some and tastes of some banana/orangy flavor with hallertau hops coming in nicely, balancing the brew. A classic representation of the style."
"Overall, I like Paulaner Original Münchner and will recommend it to my friends."
"Had this tonight; first time I ever saw this brand of brew. A nice, straw like appearance witha bright orange-yellow body; similar to Blue Moon. A nice, whaite head that is retained throughout the beer. If you feel like you want more head, give it a swish and up it comes. An interesting, malty smell with earthy tones. Tasted kind of sweet at first with an earthy aftertaste that is pleasant and lingers in your mouth. I liked that very much. A nice, thick mouthfeel makes this beer very drinkable. Highly recommended. It being served with a lemon is nice; the bitterness of the lemon offsets the earthy tones quite nicely producing a well-balanced beer."
"Beer was poured into a tumbler at 50 degrees. Very pale lager very normal. Beer was very clean and fresh tasting and while nothing really stands out about the brew, there is certainly nothing wrong with it. A great all year around beer and it was great with the steamed shrimp I cooked. I would purchase again."
"D - Pretty good. If I am in a non-doppelbock lager mood (not a frequent event, but it could happen), I might reach for one of these. The flavor is more pronounced that many non-bock lagers. Pretty nice."
"This is the ultimate Munich Helles to wash down some good Bavarian food or to be drank in fairly large quantities. However, for a sipping session brew, I prefer something with a little more flavor and body to it. However, true to the style, this Munich Helles is a damn good brew."
"Pours a light yellow color with little head. Crisp, clean grainy aroma. Taste of light malted grain with a slightly sweet flavor followed by a crisp finish with a bit of subtle hoppiness lingering on the palate. An enjoyable, tasty lager that's easy to drink."
"In the past couple months I have become increasingly fond of this style. Perhaps not coincidentally, I think I may have finally given up on my old standby brand of American Macro Lager that I would keep on hand just so I could drink it cold and fast. And so Munich Helles has stepped in as my present ""light"" beer of choice."
"Drinkability: Would be a nice keg beer for a summer party I imagine...Too bad the basic macro lagers can't spit out beers like this as their standards..."
"Near perfect mouthfeel which, when paired with the straight-forward nature of the taste, makes for an exceptionally drinkable beverage."
"Clear, pale, apple cider color. Thin and bubbly white head. Lace is sparse. I love the thick, bready aroma on this one. Slight nuances of sweet cookie dough and bread pudding. Really nice aroma for this style. Taste follows suit with great bready malt tones. Warm and biscuity. Rounded sweetness. Crisp and ever so slightly dry on the finish. Medium full body with an agreeable mouthfeel. This is a very solid Helles Lager."
"Bottle: Poured a golden yellow color lager with a nice medium foamy head with average retention. Aroma of floral malt is light but pleasant. Taste is quite light with some floral malt with some sweetness and a slightly dry finish with low hops. Well done beer with limited complexity but very refreshing."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- There isn't much to say about mouthfeel except it's pretty average... mellow, light, and subtly carbonated. It doesn't necessarily improve or diminish the beer's overall enjoyment. This is the first time I'm drinking this out of an appropriate glass, and it's a much more interesting beer. Effortless and thirst-quenching, I'd pair this with burgers or common German cuisine anytime and be quite content."
"Overall, a nicely crafted beer that does nothing wrong. It leans more toward a Helles than a Marzen. A bit more malt, noble hops, and color would put this more squarely into the Okto category and give H-P and Spaten a better run for their money."
"This is a good example of the style: well-balanced, but a bit spicy, too."
"Overall: A lovely crisp, clean and easy drinking premium Munich Helles that goes down all too easily. One of the better versions out there, this should more widely recognized for my money but it always seems to get overlooked. Dont make that mistake because this is a great Munich Helles, not to be missed!!"
"M&D: clean (not crisp) palate, light-bodied, with ideal carbonation for a lager, very refreshing and mildly-flavoured to quaff--BUT not as lively as draught... In a sense this is a very approachable Helles, but my palate tells me one bottle is more than enough... It simply fails to keep my interest or focus, as I simply prefer fuller, hoppy lagers like a true Pilsner. That said, this beer is well-crafted for sure."
"This beer is all about tasteful and subdued harmony. It is absoutely a top notch go of a Helles lager in my mind, with no flavor overbearing any other. This makes this beer extremely drinkable. It would be quite easy to get carried away with this one. At the price, this is a tough sell for me, but if I lived in Europe this would certainly be in my fridge a lot."
"I can't review it from draught because it is some years since I last tried it, but i am sure the scores would have been much higher."
"D - About as drinkable as beers get. If you're after a lager this would be a fine choice."
"Overall, a very nice session beer i could see all enjoying."
"Of all the German Munich Helles that are fairly easy to find (in a bottle here in the US), this one rivals Augustiner for my favorite--and is usually less expensive. It looks marvelous in the glass (bright, frothy yellow/amber) with a delicate hops smell as you raise the glass to your nose. The taste is mostly malt with a nicely balanced bitterness/fruitiness that makes it almost irresistable. Excellent drinkability. I think I'll have another."
"Very crisp and sharp, and ridiculously refreshing. It's not the most flavorful brew, but there is nothing at all offensive about this beer. Would definitely recommend, especially on a hot summer day like today."
"When poured it was medium light yellow in color with very little foam and some lace on the face of the glass. This was the high point as far as I was concerned. The flavor was lack luster the finish was so short that there was no flavor what so ever. I grade this beer as average, but I was feeling very generious. I will never purchase this brew again. What a dissapointment."
"Taste reveals a hefty and nutty malt presence, and sticky and oily hops that balance this beer out well. There's a slight unpleasant sharp acidic soapiness at first that mellows as the brew warms and comes into its own, but nonetheless is there. Mouthfeel is sparkly and warm, full bodied and not over-carbonated. A decent summer brew, but the taste leaves just a little something to be desired. Nonetheless, a thirst-quencher for this hot afternoon."
"D- like all well done german lagers this one is a very quaffable easy drinker. Very refreshing on a hot day. There are better examples of the style but this is certainly one of Paulander's finer offerings."
"Helles is a difficult style for me to judge because all but the best examples seem invariably bland. Still, I think Paulaner's is one of the mediocre versions."
"¡Salud!"
"Ours to a golden color with thin white head that dissipates quickly, and not much lacing. Aroma is mostly hops, offsewt slightly by malt sweetness. Has a fruity flavor, with an OK taste and finish. All and all, there was just nothing that really stood out for me with this beer."
"Smooth, mouthfeel, very nice and not overcarbonated, very nice lawnmower beer. Should be imbibed by the liter."
"Feels good in your mouth. Very drinkable beer."
"A sweeter lager with more malt than Paulaners lighter offerings, but doesnt really stand out. Golden color and sweet aroma, this is a beer t o enjoy on a warm summer afternoon. Not entirely refreshing, but better than mass market American lagers. Makes you want to have another and see if it really is a good session beer."
"Very good beer, although I was either not in the right mood when I sampled it or else this was a sub-par sixer. Great session beer if you have the cash for it; one of the all-time great quaffables."
"Goes down easy, but doesn't entertain much. It is very hot for May in Edmonton, but still the light flavour isn't enough. I won't be looking for it again."
"Crisp and refreshing, but nothing very exciting here."
"Overall a very drinkable beer with pleasant light malt, lager taste and a refreshing, clean finish. Not exactly exceptional, but a good beer for a hot day and at 4.90% ABV something to be consumed in mass quantities."
"Gold in colour with medium to high carbonation. Aromas of light malt, some German noble hop, and a slight touch of sulfur. Pretty much your standard pilsner light malt+hop combo as far as the flavor goes. It could have used a bit more bitterness and hop flavor, and perhaps it lacks a bit of snap on the finish. Overall this is an inoffensive, but well made German lager."
"D - Very good drinkability. Right on ""style"" wise. Nice session beer."
"Light body, low ABV, kinda fizzy in the mouthfeel all add up to a lager that easy for large consumption...refreshing to boot. Cheers !"
"(Note to self: save up the airfare, go to some World Cup games, savor Paulaner served up fresh in the fatherland....and praise the gods once and for all.)"
" A respectable version of the style. Well done. Well balanced and easy to drink. Could easily be a new staple in my fridge."
"This and Paulaner's other offerings make for terrific default beers for any BA's fridge."
"Overall...even at 6 months, it's not a bad drop."
"Taste is highly malt based, with nay a hint of hops. Mouthfeel is smooth with a minimal amount of carbonation. A drinkable and respectable beer, but nothing to write home about."
"Something more in the aftertaste, but not too much. A little watery."
"Pours a clear, pale gold with a very small, foamy, mostly diminishing head. Some decent lacing. It has a rather typical euro smell with light perfumey hops over moderate, lightly toasted grains. The taste is clean and crisp with a nicely dry finish, but its a bit on the bland side, even for the style. It has a medium-light body, watery texture and low carbonation. I was not impressed with this one at all. Its rather blah, and definitely not worth the money."
"Beer pours a light yellow with a nice bubbly white head. Lacing is light. The smell is on honey grain and light banana yeast. The taste is light, hints of melons, the grain is caramelized and delicious. A nice banana lemon lingers. Light bodied and smooth, great summer beer."
"Pours a pale blond with excellent clarity. A white three finger head is thick and retains very well. Some patchy lacing and highly carbonated. the only smells are faint noble hops and traces of light malt. A solid pale malt flavor, light german hops in the background and a clean finish. The light body and pleasent balance are smooth and drinkable, but too timid and mild to be a good Munich Helles."
"note: the bottle that i used to rate this i've had in my fridge for a while now. however, it tastes the same way that i remember."
"The palate features perhaps a bit too much hop bitterness, and throws off the delicate balance that I appreciate in this style. There are also creamy malt and lime peel present but not at the level that this bitterness would require. Still- it is a nice beer that stands up to multiple beer sessions."
"Drinkability... hell yeah, when they're free *LOL* Otherwise, not too bad."
"I'm thumping myself to think that I've never tried this before. If ever I'm in the mood for a good, smooth, utterly untroubling lager, this would be my choice."
"This one at first didn't sit well with me--a bit too sweet and malty. Half way through I began to enjoy the hints of fruit and spices. Very easy to drink-crisp, clean, and smooth. Nice head and solid carbonation. Would not pay big bucks, but worth the $3 a pint tonight."
"Pours a clear straw yellow with a thick, frothy white head...very appealing. Aroma is very light, hints of spicy saaz hops and light grainy, bready malt scecnt. Taste begins with a bready malt flavor followed by spicy, grassy saaz hops flavor...good but not great. Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth with high carbonation and drinkability is good. A solid helles but not as good as many american versions (specifically Edenton's Helles Angel and many others)."
"Overall - This is what a lager should taste like... an excellent, very drinkable beer... recommended..."
"I really enjoyed this beer. For what a lager is supposed to be this lived up to it in almost every way except the smell is a bit uninviting with sour being the leading power. Poured in a tulip duvel glass it had a nice head that quickly faded and little lacing. Taste is fairly bold for a lager wheat/yeast apparent and the finish completely wipes the palate clean with a lemon / slighty sour finish that makes the drinkability high. Every drink your starting fresh."
"Appearance is a pale transparent golden color. There is minimal foam and almost no lacing. Aroma is that of doughy bread and banana. Just-right carbonation compliments the initial taste which consists of roasted grain and some citrus in the finish. A nicely done dry lager that has plenty of good beer flavor and goes well with food."
"A functional lager, fine for a late afternoon summer day. Straw colour, a bit of head that sizzles then fizzles. Easy simple drink, a tad spice and grassiness from yeast and malts. A basic beer, and of course I have had more exciting product from this brewery."
"This is a pristine looking beer, perfect head on top of a straw yellow body, not to much aroma going on. The flavaor is very clean, nice body and a full mouth feel. I drink lagers rarely, having spent myself on thousands of cases of bud through high school and college, but when im in the mood for just a ""beer", this is the one for me, very consistent, tastes like what american lagers should strive for imo."
"Extremely smooth and drinkable --an excellent gateway beer to introduce to BMC drinkers."
"Pours a straw gold with a bubbly white head that diminishes quickly to almost nothing. Some sweet malts in the nose, and some faint spicy hops. Biscuity malt backed by a subtle spicy hop character, with the hops only making themselves known in the lingering finish. Delicate yet complex and has a lot of character. Nice mouthfeel and very drinkable. An excellent quaffing beer."
"I recommend this beer. It has excellent crossover potential, and it's a good representative of the style."
"Clear gold color, a lots of crbonation visible on the sides of the glass. Head rises and fades fast, leaving a ring of foam. Smell is grassy and pretty standard for a euro lager. Taste is also right on with the style. Brilliant grassy flavors, give way to a slight metallic twang, and a little hop presence. Mouthfeel is well carbonated, and alright. Drinkable, yet unimaginitive and somewhat boring."
"Bleh. Worked okay with dinner, but it's pretty dull on its own."
"Final Thought: Great mellow taste and the M&D on this make it a good choice whereever you may be..."
"Pours a very light golden color with a nice head and a faintly malty aroma. The flavor is complexly malty, but with a tiny hoppy bit on the finish that keeps things interesting. Flavor and mouthfeel are extremely light; it feels like you could drink this one all night almost like water. A nice example of the style, but for my money I prefer Weihenstephaner Original."
"This ""Hell"" poured a clear, golden color with white foam that settled, but clung to the 0.5 L glass a bit. The smell was malty with a touch of floral hops: mild but pleasing. The taste was malty with nice floral hops and good hop bitterness. There was a taste of biscuity malt as well in this well-balanced lager. The mouthfeel was smooth and crisp with medium-light body and good carbonation. The hoppiness lingered pleasantly on the tongue. This was a very good beer, one of the best helles lagers that I have had, and was very easy to quaff. Obviously this beer is very tasty fresh."
"Original Munchner is light golden wheat in color with an average head size. Aroma is of lightly toast malts, smell is full and inviting. Taste is also of lightly toasted malts. A complex taste and crisp enough mouthfeel further the respectability of this beer. Needless to say this is very drinkable, even compared to other lighter style German lagers."
"Comments: While I personally look to Spaten first when I want a good Helles, this is a fine representation of a subtle, easily overlooked style."
"I was surprised to discover that Original Munchner is my first Paulaner beer. While it doesn't rock my world, it is an acceptable, reasonably flavorful lager. Simple isn't always a bad thing."
"what can i say, a very good beer. a bit sweet to the taste, but after that, a very crisp finish that brings a smile to the face. nothing better than sitting at the paulaner beer garden and a beautiful german girl bring you a wonderful beer. viel glueck, prost"
"The beer pours a rich straw gold with a thin white head. It has a sour mash aroma. The taste is pretty basic, a sour malt base with a touch of hoppishness in the finish. The feel is light and little oily. This is a solid beer, but nothing that makes you go wow."
"Drinkability: A superb everyday lager...one of the best I have had in the recent past"
"This is a well balanced light flavored beer. Not packed with flavor, but refreshing and very drinkable."
"The huge white head has moderate lasting power. Sturdy malts shine through in the smell. Those same malts are dominate in the taste. This is about the crispest, cleanest beer I've ever drank. Just because a beer isn't big on flavvor doesn't mean it can't get high marks. This does everything it's supposed to do and then some. Perfectly drinkable."
"The mouthfeel is fairly light but not at all empty. The drinkability is very high. This is a quality easy drinking beer."
"Pours clear yellow with a moderate white head. Head dissipates pretty quickly, but leaves a little spotty lace behind. Smell is pretty mild, light malt. Taste is more complex than expected. Slightly sweet, malty. A little hop bitterness on the finish. Very smooth and easy to drink. Lightly carbonated. A great beer to have when you want something lighter... but still want flavor."
"Pours clear and golden. It doesn't appear that there are any dark malts. The smell and taste confirm this. Aroma as a whole is uninviting that seems very light on the hops. Maybe this seems a little underwhelming, since I'm used to big APA's and IPA's. Flavor has a classically pils malt character, that is only slightly bitter. Also has a very crisp finish. Not a lot of body or aftertaste, but it is also quite pleasant. This seems to be how a light lager should taste to me. It is quite easy to drink."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a grainy pale malt scent with a dry lager yeast finish. The taste is decent as well. It has a grainy pale malt feel. It goes down easy and finishes very dry and slightly musty. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good lager. It has good pale malt flavor and aroma, but not much else; a good drinker nonetheless."
"Mouthfeel: Light, but fresh and clean finish. A bit of bitter aftertaste. Although worth a few, this just didn’t inspire me very much."
"Drinkability  This is a good, basic, no frills lager."
"Overall Impression: A good EuroLager. Wife liked it, which means you can wean the macro drinkers with it. Nice session beer, but nothing Ill crave. Still, a solid well made beer."
"This beer got better as I drank it. A light yet robust full flavored beer from Paulaner. Excellent."
"It is well made- I just like other Paulaner offerings better. The 1/2 liter bottles are, of course, very user friendly."
" The head is a snow capped summit of wonderful thoughts of the last ski adventure. While the body a fine golden sweet wine color with bubbles dancing around enjoying a wonderful life, a truly unique chance of only knowing fine beer. Now don't get me started about the taste, but thats what a rating is about. When drinking from a tall mug you first get the smell which in itself would only leaving you wanting this fine aroma of only the best barley and hops on your palate. Like any wine connoisseur would tell you the smell alone will tell you if the nectar is as sweet as the flower. With this one the statement holds true. Paulaner has its own unique pils taste that cannot be matched by any other, like a fine beer that is sweet but not a sugar sweet taste. That makes you wonder if I were a brewmaster would beer connoisseurs taste a truly unique taste that would only leaving them comparing all other beers to mine. This is why paulaner has been around since the 1600's and is still going strong. So on your next outing try a paulaner original and discover this unrepeatable taste. ENJOY"
"Not bad, a decent brew but there's better out there."
"Drinkability - This is a quaffing beer to beat the summer heat; nothing to spend time lingering on with just enough flavor to keep it interesting"
"One of those beers where you think to yourself ""hmm - something different about this lager . . . wait, I know, it has flavor!"" Nicely crisp, yet full bodied. Pleasant interplay between some lightly roasted malt flavors and a slightly lemony hops profile. Tremendously drinkable - one just calls out for another. A beer that simply does its thing well."
"The beer came in a standard 500 ml bottle made with the typical Teutonic obsession about similar color scheme, label style, fonts, and overall look of the bottle to other beers from the same brewery. The beer poured very pale golden yellow in color with a short (3/4 inch) fizzy head that dissipated quickly. The beer left very little lacing on the Pilsner glass it occupied. The nose was malt dominated with honey, sourdough bread, and a bit of graininess. There was a touch of grassy hops. The taste was just as advertised by the aroma, with mostly a grainy, sweet character, and a light dose of fruitiness (bananas and apples mostly), and a lemony sourness. The hops showed up as a spicy finish with a peppery prickliness to them. The aftertaste was just a tad bit dry, urging you to gulp down the beer faster. This is a great summertime brew with enough character to keep from things getting boring."
"(Note: I had allergies while reviewing this)."
"Here is a lager. Aromas are suggestively fruity with notes of apricot, apple and plum along with a sour butter flavored sheet of moist breadiness. The bitter hop extracts are buttoned up and in deft service to the winy bouquet. A bitter, fruity tang resounds on the long, cool finish. This beer has the elusive combination of qualities that 99% of all other beers never achieve: ease of drinkability AND intellectually stimulating aesthetics."
"Super drinkable brew, tasty yet not overpowering. A great beer for any time or any meal."
"A decent Eurolager, but not something I would care to drink on a regular basis. The corn, skunk, and hay become bothersome, even after 1 bottle. There are much better brews out for the same price, and it just doesn't hold my interest."
"this is the kind of beer you should be given to teach you what a lager should taste like. if more people had this to try instead of other, more common beers, there would be a lot more people drinking beer."
"I will probably try the Paulaner Pils next to see how that compares to this one. Germany may have a fair share of pale lagers (in the Pils and Helles mold), but most of them are very well made and refreshing and this one is no exception."
"D&N: Goes down oh so smoothly, not a beer that will demand too much of the drinker, I would definitely recommend this one for anyone trying to bring one of the lost souls of the macro world into the good beer world. Nicely done."
"$1.99 for 16.9oz bottle"
"Zum wohl!"
"Drinkability: unsurpassed, where are my leiderhosen?"
"hmm...is this what heinken is supposed to taste like when it's not skunked? this beer is too expensive (i paid $7.85 for a sixxer) but will placate a wide variety of beer drinkers."
"Light gold color. Medium head. Aroma is lightly malty. Aroma is lightly malty. A crisp clean Euro-lager. Malts and hops are mild. Not a lot of flavor. Very drinkable beer, but nothing noteworthy. Mouthfeel is round. Finish is VERY clean. Aftertaste is very slightly bitter."
"The big, almost cream-colored head is foamy on top of the clear, yellow-gold beer. Some schpoonk on the nose, no big deal. Some corn too. Fresh fruit corn in the front leads to a sweet malt middle. Grains complement more corn in the dry yet sweetish (is that possible) finish. This is very good."
"Overall, not a bad beer. Actually, a pretty good one to have after an hour or so of being outside fixing a sprinkler system in 100ºF heat. I'd get this one again."
"I need to start out by saying that I am not a big aficionado of the 'lighter' lagers (e.g.: Pilseners). So, I basically found this to be a basic, lawnmower beer. It was clean & crisp. Nothing bad, but nothing to write home about."
"This was far from my favorite beer when I lived in Munich, but I must admit it tasted good with pork barbecue on a hot Moscow summer day."
"Overall: A great value at less than $8 for a 6-pack. Worth a try."
"The taste is smooth but flavorful, again the delicate malt flavors are highlighted with hop bitterness buried way in the back. A very enjoyable beer that is nearly perfect as a session beer."
"Drinkability/notes: A very pleasant and drinkable beer, which exudes quality and seems well met for hot summer weather."
"This brew pours a large head of fine to large sized white bubbles that mostly diminishes with time and a transparent softly carbonated light yellow orange body. It has a soft hop aroma with a hint of sweet honey. Initially, the flavor is smooth with lightly tingling mild hop notes and is very subtly spiced like the description says. Overall, it is a fine beer with a good palate."
"When poured into my glass, this beer had a medium sized white head with fine-small bubbles. There was fair lacing on the sides of my glass. This beer had fizzy carbonation along with a yellow colored body. It had a sweet taste to it along with a bitter taste that lingered throughout my rating of this beer but it was not an overpowering bitterness."
"The color that of the archetypal lager, a crystal clear gold, the head large and frothy, bright white in color and the lace a covering sheet. Nose is crisp and clean, all malt and somewhat sweet as is the start, top is light to middling in its feel to the palate. Finish has a crisp acidity, the hops modest and unassuming in their bite, very dry lingering aftertaste, a nice summer thirst quencher, and one I most always have on hand."
"This is a very good looking beer that has a huge 2 inch head that holds on for a little while and then settles into a thin residual head. The color is clear gold with a white head. Bubble streams are small and constant. When I opened the pint bottle there was a definite skunk aroma that eminated from the bottle. This carried through into the glass but lessened in a few minutes. The other aroma that began to come through was hops (Saaz?) The bottle was a pale bronze and I wonder if that lends to light passage similar to the green bottles so popular in Europe. There was a good sense of bready grains with a strong side sense of hops to balance the malt sweetness. This seems like a Pilsener style lager but is not advertised as such. Overall this is a better than macro beer, but not one of the best of the German lagers."
"12 oz bottle pours a clear golden color with a small white head that doesn't last. Bready and flowery aroma, starts sweet and bready with a hint of grains, light bodied, somewhat of a thin and watery mouthfeel, finishes smooth and crisp, a bit above average IMHO."
"pat"
"Color is a golden light yellow with a very foamy, white head that was three fingers high, very tall indeed. Has some big bubbles here and there but is mostly foamy and left small patches of white webby lace. Has a faint but definate aroma of spicy, floral hops and has a small hint of malt sweetness. Taste echoes the smell with a nice sweet malt and ha a very good dry hoppiness that is balanced in quite well. It has a light bodied feel, teetering on the medium side with smooth sweet lightness that finishes with a spicy hop dryness throughout. Good stuff, very drinkable, a perfect lager for some serious drinkin'."
"A very very drinkable lager..i rate this along with Ayinger's Jahrhundert bier as great lagers!!"
"Pours light yellow with a 3/4 inch head. Lacing is good. Smell is nice. Taste is light bodied, being nicely malty. German hops are present giving a nice somewhat bitter mouthfeel. This had almost a hint of skunk, but just enough to make it interesting. Finish is very smooth and crisp. This is a good beer, though lighter than a lot of German lagers."
"This was not a bad lager, but it had a lot of pilsner-like qualities considering it is not marketed as such. I am not a big fan of pilsners and Saaz hops."
"Started with a nice thick white head and was clear light yellow in color. Had a real inviting smell of toasted grain and clean hops. The taste followed suit with the smell nice malt backbone and typical dryness and hop presence of a good lager. The hops had a nice floral clean finish to them and wern't to heavy as in many lagers. Being predominantly an ale drinker I have a tough time distinguishing between pale lager flavors but this was straightforward, clean and good."
"This Munich is a brilliant golden color with a white head. The nose is full of spice, and bready malts. The flavor is also breading with a dry slightly hoppy finish. It is relatively light in body, smooth and refreshing. This would be a great summer brew; very easy drinking beer."
"Pours a crystal clear pale yellow stained-water color with a massive white head. Faint esters of wheat, fruit, and light hops make up the aroma that is quite nice. The taste mirrors the smell with black pepper flavored hops and a pronounced yeast background that makes for a lightly sticky light-bodied brew. Although Im reviewing this in the winter, today in Texas was quite warm as we top the hill of the roller-coaster temperatures that we encounter in the winter. So this beer went down quite well. Another very good brew from Paulaner. Prosit!"
"Super light straw color. Streaming columns of bubbles steadily make their way to the surface. Nearly pure white head. The light color is deceiving though, as Ive said before, the Germans are masters at packing flavor into light colored beer. This is another example. The aroma is of fresh bread, lightly toasted malt. The flavor screams purity, nary an adjunct to be found. The bready, malty flavor is accompanied by precise, dry finishing noble German hops. Carbonation is crisp, prickly and steady. The perfect accent for my pesto pasta."
"Well, I just recieved my official Paulaner half-liter mug, and man is this thing huge. I love it, to break it in I opted to select the Orginal Munich Formula, and being a big fan of the hefeweizen I had never tried the lager. I must say, this beer is great!!! It took three bottles to fill my mug, and it looks perfect the golden color and the huge thick frothy white head. That same great European lager fresh and sending nice scents of malt. Amazing, and then I took my first sip. A huge malty treat, refreshing smooth lemon grassy sweetness. An awesome beer that could take the throne as my all time favorite lager, that I've tasted."
"I feel that ""Original Munich"" is one of the better beers labeled as a ""lager"". Quite refreshing, pours a beautiful glass of beer (prominent, fluffy head - good retention. Nice lace from start to finish.) Taste leans slightly towards the malty, but overall, a pretty mild beer. Holds up well next to the best lagers and pilsners I've had."
"cheers!"
"Pours a pale straw color with a foamy white head that leaves some nice lacing. Aroma is of lightly toasted malts with some mild floral notes. Taste is of sweet malts with notes of citrus and a mild hop bitterness. It is dry, crisp, and refreshing in the mouth. A very drinkable brew."
"Aroma of cream horns and green leaf lettuce. A slim, sliding head over straw. A nice, sweet toasty spine with a few bitter sprinkles to balance. A smidgen too bubbly. Paulaner Original is no slouch, but kind of a bore. A good beer to have around when you get into those profound philosophical conversations with your cat and you don't want your beer mucking up your stream of consciousness."
"Here is a lager that just yellls, ""Drink me!"". Its not a powerhouse, yet its not too light in body. Pours out to the typical golden color of the style with a decent, yet light aroma of hops. Taste is somewhat sweet with a slight detection of nutmeg and cloves. A very drinkable beer that could lead to many more due to how easy it goes down."
"This is not my favorite style of beer, but I wasn't surprised when this case wound up kicked rather quickly."
"This is one of the better lagers to be found. If you like a good crisp full flavored lager, Original Munich Premium by Paulaner is what youll be looking forward to."
"Mmmm delicious. Very smooth German lager, malt flavor comes through nicely. A great beer to kick back with. Not quite there with Hacker-Pschorr, but nonetheless, very tasty and worth every penny. Would love to try on tap."
"A clean, easy drinking lager. Somewhat malty flavor. Low hopping allows for malt aroma to come through. Head was low and tight with a little lace on the glass. Pleasantly bitter finish. A nice, crisp, light and malt-oriented lager. I will definitely order this one on tap when available."
"Aroma has grainy/bready quality with just the slightist hint of hops.  Nice white head, clear and yellow-gold color.  Smooth lighter bodied beer, with plenty of carbonation.  Light malty flavor begins, but less grainy than the aroma.  Some dryness and hops at finish with some astringency (not appropriate for style).  This isn't quite as good as I had hoped, especially compared to some of this brewery's other offerings."
"Absolutely luscious!"
"This beer poured a straw color and formed an bubbly white head that didn't hold and formed little lace.  A strong aroma of bread/grain and slightly of hops.  A flavor of bread/grain and some hops.  The finish was astrigent.  Not the best that this fine company offers."
"Not bad, but not what I wouyld have guessed as 'the Original Munich Premium Lager.'  That is because it is a helles, or light lager.  It fits the style, but not neccesarily my taste."
"A very delicious beer, I will definitely have another one please!"
"Malty fresh nose with a very very pale yellow look.  This yellow is of course crystal clear. withn a thick creamy white head and lace.  The head is very airy...  Creamy malt feel and taste with a very clean finish.  The brew is very clean on the tongue.  The finish is ever so slightly bitter.  This brew has more malt flovor than its competitors but the brew should have slightly more bitterness to put it over the top.  The quality is there though and I really enjoy the feel of this lager.  I have not met a Paulaner I have not enjoyed."
"This is a fine everyday beer, with light malt background, aggressive hoppy hints, and persistent rapid bubbles reminiscent of a beady pilsner. Short-lived head, yellow golden color, not much aroma. Decent with spicier foods, generally delicate but substantial and interesting enough for sustained drinking. A basic flavor - what most people think of when they think of ""beer"" - without the US macro chemical nastiness. Some slight travel damage is inevitable; after all, this is a pretty sensitive brew, but tasty nonetheless."
"Very clear, pale straw color.  Pilsner glass gives a generous head, bubbles are big at the side.  Nose is sweet with a little nutmeg.  Nutty malts with spice, typical of the style but not leaning toward a wallpaper paste as in some.  A little lighter in mouthfeel and taste than a Hacker Pschorr Munchner.  Clean finish with little after taste.  Not a world beater but a good lager is always appreciated."
"hazy golden color, pours out a decent head that disappears quickly. very soft euro lager smell, some wheat characteristics....taste is light and very smooth.  hops bite on the tongue in the end.  it's a damn shame that some domestic mass macro brewer can't brew something similar to give us another option at affordable prices."
"Good malty German brew,finishes well with just enough hop spiceyness to it.Good with food,not to light but doesnt fill you up real quick either,thearomas are light, but the flavor is fuller with some substance to it,unlike to many American adjuct filled lagers."
"Persistent, thick enticing white head covers a crystal clear absolutely golden hued beer.  I've forgotten how attractive well lagered beers are.  Slightly toasty Vienna malt notes dominate the aroma, but a hint of Hallertauer hops round out the nose nicely.  Very clean yet very flavorful in overall flavor profile.  It's got significantly more body and malt flavor than a German pils, but with less emphasis on hops.  It finishes with a welcome and subtle hop bitterness on the tongue.  To me this defines the style. This is a very agreeable and drinkable brew.  If only American mass produced lagers were this good..."
"Golden in color with a crisp clean taste,terrific lager that is dangerously easy to drink. Great flowerly aroma with bubbly head."
"Golden in color, with a distinct malt accent. Spicey, flowery, camomile-like aroma.It has a surprizing degree of hoppy dryness in the finish.  This was a Großes ursprüngliches München ( Great original Munich! )"
"Notes: A very respected lager, and rather tasty."
