"O -- Well -- I wish I could find *some* sort of dating code on this beer, but there's not even an ink-jet number on the bottle.  I'm rather afraid that the local distro is passing off last year's batch, because this tastes nothing like a Helles ought to."

"Pours a light clear gold with a nice light stream of carbonation. The head is thinner, white, and leaves some nicer small sticky lacing. The aroma is almost non-existent, with very faint notes of bread and hops. The taste is more assertive, but still pretty mild. It's not bland but it doesn't have the depth of flavor other Helles Lagers have. It's not at all heavy, nor should it be and is light and crisp."
"O- well made Munich helles that is a great pick for spring"

"Very basic grainy taste. Its drinkable but doesn't stand out."

"Straightforward lager. Average all around. Could drink a few if offered."

"Overall:  Love how light and sessionable this beer is with the right amount of malt and hop flavor.  Makes me think of warm weather to come."
"I could easily have a few of these in a row."

"A good solid beer.  The pour was a golden color.  The aroma was of hops.  The taste was very crisp, light, and clean.  The hops came through but not overly powering.  This is definitely a good go to beer.  This would be great with Warner weather or backyard BBQ."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 1/16/2015. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, cracker, biscuit, herbal, straw, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and slight yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big lemon, cracker, biscuit, herbal, straw, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Fair amount herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, cracker, biscuit, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Damn nice balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and slight yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavors with minimal yeast ester notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.6%. Overall this is an excellent Munich helles style. All around great robustness and balance of pale malt and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. Maybe just slightly hoppier than I expected, but really well done all around. A very enjoyable offering."
"Overall: A very good take on a German style lager. Good crisp bready malt notes with a solid Noble hop balance."

"O: Perhaps slightly hoppier and less maltier than its German brethren.  Regardless, itâ€™s a solid Munich Helles and a welcome winter sight on retail shelves in Michigan.  Nice job, Southern Tier!"

"Sweet, cracker notes dominate along with breadiness."
"Thankfully, the booze was weak in this as I couldn't taste it and could barely feel it by the time I finished this off. I like my beers ""bright"" when it comes to the flavor and this felt a bit ""flat"" for me, even if the mouthfeel was certainly crisp enough. Sure, this would be a decent choice once the weather warms up but by itself, this reminded me too much of the Eurotrash Pilz. Not one of Southern Tier's better offerings."

"A fantastic spring lager. Bright, clean, easy drinking with some sweetness."

"Gold in color with amazing clarity. Tall, creamy white head. Great retention. Sweet, grainy Pils malt aroma. Sweet and malty flavor to match with a touch of noble hops to round it out. Incredibly clean and smooth. An excellent version of a style that I am really growing to love. Southern Tier absolutely nailed this one. Gimmicky name, awesome beer."
"A very refreshing well-balanced Helles. An excellent example of the style! A great choice for an easy-drinking lager!"

"Trying to chase the polar weather away by auditioning beers for a leading role on my deck this summer, and this one is a real contender. Crystal clear, light golden pour with 1"" foamy head that hung around for a minute or two and hung some lace on the glass the whole way down. Light hops smell maybe some bread. Perfect carbonation, and a crisp refreshing taste that you could  handle all day long. Hope I can get lots more of this as summer approaches."

"Tasted pretty plain for lager."
"What a perfectly balanced beer. Very refreshing and easy to enjoy."

"Crisp, fruity, citric, leafy hop flavor. In perfect balance with delicate bread grains. Perfect body and lively carbonation. Very refreshing. A treat to drink."
""
"Very light pleasant taste! I could drink this all summer if it ever gets here!"

"Im rating this on style and this is on par with german helles lagers"

"O-very clean, crisp, and malty beer. epic session beer"
"What starts light, arid and creamy will quickly finish with a bone-dry, crisp and clean taste and texture that highlights a firm hop balance with the vastly exit of any malt influence."

"Now, timing?  Mine was bottled a few weeks ago.  It's fricking cold.  I'd welcome it two months later when I'm actually starting to think about spring, let along summer..."
"Great spring/summer beer!  Refreshing."

"Hopefully these will be around for a while because I'd like to have some when it is warm outside, and right now it is skiing season in Western New York."

"O- A decent lager. I'd buy again when in the Helles mood."
""
"This would be an amazing beer to get someone into the craft movement, or just sip on a better beer then your typical old swig.  While it's not over the top, it does a great job at being light and bright like a Helles Lager should be, and stays true to itself."
