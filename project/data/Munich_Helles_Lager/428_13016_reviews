"Overall a real interesting helles that seems to be bigger on taste and certainly feel than expected.  All this in a slightly lighter package, really well done."

"O: A superb German lager and a wonderful, authentic representation of a classic and often underappreciated style."
""

"The beer poured a clear golden color that produced big, light, white head that was very well retained, which settled into a thin cap for the duration of the beer. The beer had a good aroma to it, sweet malt with a hint of lemon and spice. The taste of the beer was just as good, if not better, and exactly what I would think of for this style. Nice balance with just a slight edge to the malt and still with that hint of lemon. The beer had a light body to it. The beer was clean, crisp smooth and extremely easy to drink. I could drink this all of the time."
"I think freshness is definitely key for this beer, I've had some 'meh' bottles and I've had great ones, this particular one falls in the latter category. Nice straight up lager that's stellar all around, definitely sessionable, the 500ml size is nice but I'd love to see this in 6-packs."
""
"O: Wish I had another bottle. This is seriously good stuff. I'm a huge fan of the style and this is up there with Schlenkerla. I could drink endless amounts of this delicious lager!"
""

"O - Not a bad beer, but I am disappointed. One of the best rated beers of this style (which happens to be my favorite), but nothing makes me want to purchase again. I would gladly try again if found somewhere cheaper (paid $5.49 for this 500 ml bottle - not worth it at all), but in the end, there are many better (and cheaper) Helles lagers. It's worth a try for lager fans."

"This one is golden yellow in color with a thick collar which retains well. Honey and grass make the aroma, and both aromas are vibrant. The taste is clean with pleasant grassy notes, honey bread, and a subtle citric note. With a slight crispness and light-medium body which helps make this beer very refreshing, this is one of many candidates for the stereotypical helles lager."

"O: It seems like the brewer was trying to make the easiest-drinking beer on the planet – something that Bud, Miller, and Coors have been trying to do for years – and I think they just may have succeeded. From first sip to last, this was everything I wanted in an everyday beer: smooth, pleasing flavors that still don’t lack depth, as well as a creamy texture that doesn’t fill you up. It’s a shame I won’t be able to have it fresh unless I buy a ticket to Europe; still, I’ll be buying up whatever bottles I can while I have the chance. Prost!"

"Had the pleasure of trying this one tap during its short span at 775 Gastropub. It's a perfectly clean lager with a nice dose of malts and just enough hops to balance it out. It was very, very smooth - almost too smooth! A little more crispiness would have been cool, but I liked it for what it was just fine. Why did the glass have to be 14oz? I wanted so much more."
"Pale golden colour, medium head, clear. Initial red cabbage aroma faded, also detected some malt and citrus. Initially I tasted a burst of nut and mushroom which promised much but soon faded. It had a pleasant, balanced malty sweetness but it could have been more. Crisp texture, smooth on the palate, light to medium carbonation. Expected a lot after the first sip, eventhough it didn't quite deliver it was still not bad."
""
"Mouthfeel is great- light body, moderate to full carbonation. Exceptionally refreshing for a hot summer day."
"Overall quite nice, wish I could try this on cask, its quite tasty and drinkable, sessionable, and good for what I've come to expect of good german beers esp mahrs."
"Beer is medium-bodied with fairly active carbonation, though the beer isn't prickly on the palate. Resulting mouthfeel is crisp and tight across the palate, the sip is moved along quickly due to the carbonation. Finishes quite dry, with little residual sugar as there isn't any stickiness on the mouth afterwards."

"High C+"

"This was a crisp, beautiful beer. I had two of these and could have had several more."
""
""
"Medium carbonation and medium body are solid. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I think a lighter body would turn up the crisp factor. All in all, this is an excellent example of the style and is no doubt a fine beer. The malt character is just too one-dimensional, even for a Helles. I'll stick with Weltenberger Kloster Barock Hell, especially at half the price."
"This is a golden straw color with a sweet, floral honeyed aroma. Lucky bees! The taste has a hint of that honey-sweetness which lasts all the way through. There’s a fizzy effervescence that keeps it light."
""
"I have no idea how the bottled product stacks up to this (the ungespundetes imports tend to be so-so), but this was was up there with the best beers I've had anywhere."
""
"O -- Anyone who wants to learn what German beer can be all about and wants to know why many of us look for the best examples of the styles owes it to themselves to look into this beer. Imagine all this malt character in a 4.9 ABV beer. That's precision lager brewing."
"Another good one from Mahr's."
"Overall: More hoppy than expected; a rather fine example of the style"
"I do not often drink this style (or lagers at all), and I found this beer to be much better than expected. It was subtle and very drinkable."
"O - This is a very well-balanced lager. It doesn't hit you in the face; it just does what it does very, very well."
"O: At the end of the day, it comes down to the flavor of a beer and this flavor does not cut it."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink, and its low alcohol makes it very sessionable."
"Blindingly yellow with a sheet-white head that is loose and bubbly, just as you'd want in a beer like this. There's some odd sweetness in the aroma-- is it corn? It smells like it. Sharp bubbles hit first in the taste, followed by some sweetness that remains unidentifiable (more corn? molasses?), some easily identifiable malt and finally a bite from the hops that is bitter but refreshing. Worth seeking out to try for the first time, worth drinking now and then but not a must-have."
"Ordered a bottle at Tap and Table. Served with a tall Mahrs glass stein, the beer was a beautiful clear gold with a tall white head - we're off to a good start. There's the appropriate hint of sulfur in the aroma with light bread crust. This is a true German lager. It doesn't have the most unique or compelling flavor, but it's super drinkable and tasty. The subtle bread and grain flavors are complimented by a small spicy hop kick in the finish."
"Poured into Mason jar. Decent head lemon-grassy aroma. Head dwindles to nothing and not much lacing to see. Tastes very mellow and refreshing. Nice almost sweet malty medium light body that ends slightly grassy and dry finish. A good brew I will try more from Mahrs Bräu. Try one on; a very refreshing and drinkable brew."
"Mouthfeel is full and smooth and the sparkle is light all combines to make for high drinkability."
" D- This beer has a nice freshness in the malt flavors and a good support by the hops. Just a bit more carbonation could have really helped the finish."
"D: Mahrs still continues to amaze me. This may be one of their best offerings. Very easy to drink. I wish I had more than one."
"pour is a yellow gold with a rather small head. smell is like a pilsner. not so much on the bright malty side. smell of straw, apple, and some honey. the taste is earthy. some apple/honey sweet. but the beer seems to be carried by the bitterness. i know that between a helles and a german pilsner, the comparison is like splitting hairs but it seems as if this still has to much hops headlining for the style. the malt character is rather simple and subsidiary to the dry, earth, bitter of the pilsner hop."
"overall it mighty flavorful for such a small beer"
"This beer is a light copper color with a thick snow white head and lace. I hardly ever notice the aroma it seems until half way through. It has fruity hoppy smell with a little bit of malt. It is sort of buttery. You can taste the malts and yeast in this beers body but they are not overpowering. The hops in are mildly floral. The mouthfeel is fizzy but there is hardly any bite."
"Not a bad beer, probably not at its peak condition after traveling across the pond, but still quite quaffable."
"Moan and Dove had this bottled after a long hiatus from the bar. The drink poured with a clear gold appearance. The head quickly thinned away toward mostly lacing. The aromas were, in general, faint fruits, hops, malt and even some hints of vanilla. The taste was mostly bittersweet with sharp hops and doughy flavors. Great carbonation made this enjoyable until the end. Overall, wicked good."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, mild kick, excellent representation of style, this is nice lighter beer to drink for a long time."
"D: Really tasty beer. I would buy again."
"You dont come around a good German made Helles lager often and it really is a treat when you stumble on one like this.Poured into a .5 liter sten a light clear lemon yellow with a tight one finger fluffy white head that held great retention,lemon stood out most in the aroma with a little funky wet grain-like note.Slightly toasted malt flavors along with a passing mineral character melds into a lemony finish,nothing over complex but sturdy and solid.It went great with a lemon and roasemary whole roasted chicken I made tonight better than any white wine in my mind,just a solid helles lager here to be had."
"Overall: A very good example of a Helles. Nothing crazy, but nothing has to be. That's the beauty of a Helles."
"D: Easy to drink nice malty sweetness is very pleasing and makes this beer easily sessionable."
"Taste relies mostly on the malt, which gives the beer it's character. On top of that there is a clean bitterness, that is a bit spicy and herbal. Mouthfeel is dry and bitter on the tongue. Drinkability is good. Nothing too exciting, just an average lager."
"Hazy light golden. Slight bubbly white head. Very little retention. Aroma is grainy sweet with some dabs of hay-like hop aromas. Sweet grainy taste as well. With some bready and biscuity malt accents. Hops are light on the buds, maybe adding a little dryness. Pretty easy drinker. Light carbonation and medium-full body."
"this is a pristinely golden beer, with a small, foamy white head that endures. smell is bafflingly wonderful: pear, honey, lemongrass, cooling bread. taste is everything that the smell promises, if not more. pay attention to this one! the flavors are subtle and perfectly blended; it's all so silky smooth that you could swallow and miss it if you're not careful. as drinkable as it gets -- an honor."
"D: Pretty good. I like the change up this one threw me. Not exactly what I was expecting, but still very good. More like a German Macro Lager, if you will. Worth trying."
"edit: Just had a fresher sample. The mouthfeel seemed smoother, and there was a slight butterscotch type flavor. Honey taste was there, but not overly sweet. A subdued yet tasty lager."
"Light yellow with bubbly head. Lace left on the glass. Floral and malty aroma. Very drinkable thirst quencher though on bitter side and smoothly malted and carbonated, light bodied. Interesting for a lager.Thanks for the recommendation Putnam, purchased at Cloverleaf in Detroit."
"Rich gold and crystal clear, the beer was topped by a short, fine, bright white head that formed solid sheets of lace on the glass and showed great retention. Fresh grain aroma with a bit of toasty malt and delicate hopping. Light bitterness with a balanced malt sweetness. Some toastiness and fruit as well, with grassy hops lingering in the finish. Light bodied with moderate carbonation, off-dry and crisp. This is a great thirst quencher. Excellent balance helps make this a high-class lager."
"Not bad, but I'm not terribly impressed. They could have done so much more, done this beer so much better. Too bad."
"The pour left a bit to be desired. Lighter in body, very transparent, spotty head with little lacing. Aroma was hoppy with hay notes and some German/Belgian malt mix. Yeasty and clovey, slightly grassy and earthy. A bit of tobacco even. Taste was even more complex. Quite creamy. Soapy but not in a bad way. Malty but quite dry. Lighter in body but not watery in the least. Lemony but not acidic. Grassy but not raw. Smooth finish. Complexity with everything working perfectly. Three bottles of this went down without a problem. I still want more."
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a wonderfully malty scent that boasts of pale and Munich malts along with a spicey German hop aroma. It's sweet and creamy smelling. The taste is decent. It's a light beer with a mild malty feel and a sharp hop content. It goes down easy with some residual maltiness, but finishes bitter and grassy. It's got a fruity nature, but seems to be a little too hoppy. The malts in the aroma are not as pronounced in flavor. The mouthfeel is decent as well. This is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a pretty good brew, but I've had better. I was looking for something a little maltier, but it drinks well nonetheless."
"It's tough to tell how this one is really different from the Mahr's Bock Bier I had a couple nights ago. The main difference I think is that this is an overall lighter beer, though it shares many of the same qualities, starting with the appearance. This beer is a light orange to darkish straw yellow with a nice head, though it doesn't last long, and nice crisp clarity. Smell and taste are full of wet grains, sawdust, and a lightly sweet malt backbone. Tones of honey (I find this in almost all the Mahr's beers), and a nice crisp and spicy hop profile. I think the bock bier has a higher abv and therefore is a little spicier and sharp, while this beer is nothing but soft on the palate and uber drinkable. Can't go wrong with Mahr's."
"Pours a full finger of fluffy white head over a cloudy pee-colored liquid. Smells of noble hops and mild malty sweet. The malt smells clean and fresh. A little bit tin-ish. Yummy with a hint of tettnanger hops. Taste...rounded rough malt mixes well with the tettnanger hops (which I consider taste a bit dirty and edgy). Just a touch of caramel. The beer is honey-ish sweet...not wet, not dry, but right in between. Hop bitter is minimal, but there is a bit of a grassy edge. This beer is a quality product that is representative of the flavor and quality of beers I had fresh on tap while in German a while back. Md-light body and mid-range carbonation. Full bubbles formed on the flat of my tongue."
"This helles lager poured a crystal clear, light amber color with creamy, white foam that settles to a thin coat. The smell was light malt with a hint of hops. The taste was nice, clean malt with mild hoppiness to balance, and with a hint of sweetness overall. The mouthfeel was very smooth with medium body and moderate carbonation. The hoppiness came out in the finish. This was a very nice lager and is a great session beer (at least when the ""U" runs out)."
"A pretty good brew, right into the style. I had it a little warm, and it was pleasurable nonetheless."
"Enters the mouth strongly yeasty and an abruptly bitter feel. A hint of sweetness with some style wouldnt hurt here. Really carmalizing on the taste buds, kind of like eating a fresh baked yeast roll. Mouthfeel is bitter and raw. Drinkable if you are into a raw. Drinkable if you are into a raw yeasty bitter German style brew."
"Oddly, this is quite a different beer than I enjoyed on tap at Manhattan's ""d.b.a."" last year. Perhaps they were serving Mahr's Leicht? In contrast, this sample has a great deal more chew and presence on the palate."
"Presented with 3/4"" off-white head, over a deep golden brew. Light aroma of balanced hops and malt sweetness. Taste has a nice malt base, but stands out in my mind as crisp, citrusy, and lightly hoppy. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good. An enjoyable brew I would revisit."
"Pours a one-fingered white head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Light nearly clear amber color. Slight malty & hoppy nose. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Mild flavored some sweetness, hops in the background, nothing overpowering, makes a good session beer. $2.45 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, Ma."
"Cloudy golden-yellow color with a minimal white head. It does leave a nice amount of lacing. The aroma is biscuity and toasty...typical German profile. I get a bit of graininess and corn, but it has a solid malt backbone and the noble hop aroma. The flavor is nice, crisp and toasty...a very nice malty flavor throughout. Hop flavor is present, but it is in the back to the full malty flavor. Very clean and crisp....light bodied, and somewhat creamy in texture. A very drinkable beer."
"Drinability- Not a bad brew. This one would be a good beer to have with a meal that was on the saliter side. Also, probably a good summer brew."
"Half-liter bottle, bottled on 6-10-2003. Pours a pale straw pils color with a fair eggshell colored head. Modest malty nose with a hint of fresh hops. Very refreshing, smooth and clean tasting. Mild in its malt/hop balance, and softly mineral in the water content. Assumes a slightly citrus astringency in the malt, like it was oversparged. Just enough hops to provide a counterbalnce for the malt and provide a crisp finish. I like this Helles, I'd seek it out again. Very enjoyable."
"A very drinkable lager, perfect to pair up with the catfish sandwich."
"Had this on tap at Redbones...This beer was served slightly cloudy, but not opaque, a chamomile tea color. Nice light sweet smell. I was very pleasantly surprised with this one: it had the nice flowery hop characteristic that I enjoy so much, with some light sweet malt in the background. If you enjoy a solid german helles, with a flowery hop finish, then you will enjoy this beer. Not as refined a brew as the Burgerbrau version, but definitely very enjoyable. Prost! pat"
