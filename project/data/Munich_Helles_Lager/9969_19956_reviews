"Overall impression:  A refreshing sessionable lager.  This beer deserves more love.  Well crafted and enjoyable.  Rahr is such a good brewery that delivers every time I have something from them."

"Body is very light and drinkability is high. Pleasant, but more like a blonde ale if you ask me,"
""
""
"O: probably a perfect BBQ/summer beer, but a little too grainy for me to seek out again. if your only other options are the standard Bud-Miller-Coors offerings, drink this. it's better. but it doesn't stand out as a champion on its own."
""
""
"O: Light, crisp lager that is an easy substitute for any of the BMC lagers. Not too much to the taste, but a good thirst quencher for a hot day."

"Pours a really good looking golden hue.Nice carbonation,I had this a few years ago and it really didn't have as much carbonation as it does now.It could just be me but I love the level of carbonation.It smells malty with a hint of biscuits and grain.Taste of sweet malt and lots of grain but I think it really taste good.Not much in the way of hop or bitters but it's still a good sip.Mouth feel is very light but o so pleasant.Would love one of these sitting at my favorite fishing hole on a hot day.Overall I would say this beer would be a great beer to get some newbies to try.But I will also enjoy a few of these the next time I cookout with my friends.Enjoy my friends!"

"Overall, a good effort from Rahr & Sons and one I wouldn’t turn down if it was offered to me. It doesn’t blow you away, but it is quaffable and good as a session beer."
""
""
"This is a very simple beer. It’s too style, but leaves me wanting something a little more flavorful. The flavor is correct and it’s good, but it’s just not intense or forward enough for me. I’m glad I tried it though."

"A pale beer with a thin white head. Has a musky, skunky smell. A really dry beer with a papery, cardboard taste. Otherwise really plain. Aftertaste does not linger too long so it is not unbearable. Texas has a lot better blonde ales to offer such as Bombshell and Fireman's #4."
""
"Overall, an average, light bodied, easy drinking beer."
"Pours a clear golden color with a pillowy off white head. The smell is mostly biscuits and grain, it is slightly sweet and buttery. It tastes almost like buttered popcorn with a touch of caramel, it's also kind of metallic and grainy. This beer is smooth with a medium body and perfect carbonation. I thought this beer was simple, full flavored and enjoyable."
"Not the best Helles, but it's pretty good."
"Overall: This beer simply isn't worth the time to try and get. It is hard enough finding good beer down here. You might as well crack a budweiser and accept the hegemony of BMC. Or if you want something darker go for the Shiner Bock."
"Edit: As this beer warms it does gain more flavor. Unfortunately it is a weird sour flavor that isn't very appealing."
"Light lacing."
"Drinkability: A rather unusual Helles, with the sweet fruit and sour elements adding a less than optimal complexity; the flavor should be much cleaner"
"This Helles lager was, I'm afraid, not good at all. I really enjoy this style but found this to have some off-flavors that I'd normally pass over as a bad bottle or something, except in this case I can see that several other reviewers have had the same experience. This means either the off flavors were intentional (but why?) or they have known quality issues and sell the beer anyway..."
"The beer pours a very clear macro yellow with a white head. The aroma is hay, grass, bready malts and honey. The flavor is honey and bread with the aftertaste being some dirty, earthy hops. Light to medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not too good of a beer."
"Next to try the black lager. This beer is nice and I would drink it again."
"drinkability: felt good to drink but bite might not be for all. also could get tired of the bite if drank too often"
"d - goes down easy. there are other lagers i would prefer to drink but this one is okay."
"Pours a very light, clear dark yellow color body, with a big head, white, lasting. Vegetably aroma, grassy. I wish these smelled more enticing. Light taste, mostly clean aftertaste. Carbonated, grassy tasting. Not my style. Letting warm up a bit...a little better, but still not my first choice in almost any situation."
"Overall kind of bland. A no frills drink that would be good at a BBQ or party. I will probably avoid this for the most part though."
"Not horrible but not exactly great either. The tang in this could have used some more bitterness for balance and crispness. Maybe the hops had faded some in this? I'd be willing to investigate a fresher bottle."
"Yellow pour on tap with a decent white head. Hint of macro skunk in the aromas. Fortunately not present in the flavor, which consists of a bit of lemon, a touch of biscuity malt and bit of bitterness in the finish. Not bad but nothing to write home about. Light mouthfeel, appropriate for the style. An easy beer to drink , certainly an acceptable summer choice, but not anything I'd go too far out of my way to get."
"I was hoping for more here. I'm going to look these guys up again when I visit my brother and I'm sure things will taste much better."
"Nothing too memorable, and nothing I would reach for normally. But for a free beer, I could probably drink one."
"D: Very drinkable, I wish I had tried this brew before and will definitely be having again to support my local brewery. Well done."
"Verdict: This is the beer that the macros should be. If you're looking for something simple and drinkable that won't offend at your next BBQ, you'll do a lot better with a case of this than the normal Bud/Miller/Coors fare."
"Wouldn't ever have another."
"This is just a no frills lager, nothing special, not a great interpretationof the style."
"An all around good Munich Helles Lager that is as good as Weihenstephaner; if not better. Somewhat better than Spaten and Paulaner"
"Overall this seems like an attempt by Rahr's to attract macro drinkers to their brewery because it tastes a lot like I'm drinking a macro."
"D- Luckliy I was only given one of these beers. I certainly wouldn't want/order a second. Be good to have around for some of my other friends to drink but after having a Weihenstephaner, I realize this beer needs some work to help it be a good example of a Munich Helles."
"Pours a hazy golden pale yellow color, nice carbonation, nice three finger head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, slight yeast, some slight spice. The taste is sweet, malty, some yeast, slight spice. Medium body. Drinkable, not too bad of a brew."
"D - This is a pretty easy to drink beer would probably be better in warmer weather its not bad theres just better beers coming out of Texas than this one"
"Oh and here's a big shout out to my buddy brewdlyhooked13 for this gift beer - after the HOT day I had it really hit the spot - cheers!"
"D- This beer was pretty light in flavor with some off flavors and a bit more malt character would go a long way."
"Drinkability - I didn't care much for this. Just too sour like lemon rind, I was expecting more of a malty beer."
"Rahr & Sons Blonde Lager is a pretty good effort that doesn't stand out from the crowd. That's exactly how I felt about Ugly Pug Black Lager. That said, I wouldn't mind having a brewery like this set up shop in this Millstream-only state. Thanks mhewes."
"Clear, very light yellow with a horrendously strong skunk smell, some tart, sweet malt and somewhat sharp sourness in the taste. Really poorly done, and reminiscent in some ways to their oktoberfest in terms of sourness. Tastes a bit better than smell, but not by much. This is a poorly made beer and was bought fresh, just as their Oktoberfest was and both were undrinkable."
"Overall impression: Simple, drinkable beer. Nothing too exciting, but its a nice flavor and easy to make a session out of it."
" If I had to buy it again I would put the beer back on the shelf and buy coors or miller. This beer is very unimpressive."
"Poured a crystal clear light straw color from a 12 ounce bottle with a thin white head that dissipates quickly. Smell is clean with a hint of hops. The taste is very light, slight malt in the finish, no real hop bitterness. Body is medium-light. The beer goes down very easily, probably a good lawnmower beer for the summer time."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with no dating info into a pint glass. It was light honey color with a bunch of little yeast bits floating around. It was a good pour so it had a large head to whittled down to a broken film. Light carb and tiny bit of lacing. The aroma was so-so. Kinda funky, skunked smell at first then it faded to not much of anything. The taste was OK with a crisp finish. I'm not a huge fan of the style so it wouldn't get great marks to begin with but this is middle of the road for the style. As it warms, the flavor starts to get a weird tang to it so drink cold. If it had a better taste, it could almost sneak into session beer territory but just misses. Overall, it's an OK beer but with so many other good beers out there I don't see me buying another unless it was a choice between Macro and this. Also, I'd try it on-tap once to see what that does for it. (One and done)"
"I still need to learn more about the style before grading too hard. Overall refreshing."
"Light refreshing fairly easy to drink, but not the most thirst-quenching beverage."
"Much better than Rahr's Red - this one actually tastes like they know what they're doing. Lovely foamy head, perfect balance of bitterness and maltiness and a nice richness in the aftertaste. The aroma isn't all that great (reminds me of citrus and wet dog) but the flavor and balance combined with the light-ish body (but not watery) make this a beer I could easily see myself drinking 3-4 of while watching a movie."
"The yellow-gold body of Rahr's helles is just slightly cloudy beneath it's short but creamy head of bright white foam. The retention is average, and lacing is limited. In the nose it's gently yeasty over a firm maltiness that's just lightly grainy and subtly sweetish, and backed by floral and grassy hop notes. The flavor continues in the same vein, and it's nicely balanced between gently grainy and subtly husky malt and grassy and floral hops. It's delicately sweet, balanced by a firm bitterness, and it finishes honeyish with an edge of mineralish and grassy hops that linger shortly on the palate. Enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is rich and creamy but firmly carbonated. Special."
"Although I have lived in Texas for a few years, this is my first time to try this beer. I am pleasantly suprised by it as I was honestly just expecting another lager. This is a great session brew and would also go very well with a variety of types of food."
"This is a great beer for warmer weather. Very refreshing and easily drinkable."
"Drinkability: Easy drinker, had no problem putting a few of these back. I'd pick it if it was local."
"Last swigs: A refreshing Helles with hints of honey."
"D- A very good Helles. I drink this when I want to eat something spicy. This is my 6 of choice for summertime BBQ's. It should satisfy any level of beer drinker from the newbie to the snob."
"This is one I feel I should have reviewed by now and am liking more and more. I don't remember being wowed by this when I first tried it - maybe Fritz has tweaked the formula since then, but it's definitely grown in my esteem. I'm happy to have such a solid local alternative to BMC."
"A drinkable brew that would be great on a hot summer day - although it also went down quickly on a warm spring night."
"Pours out a straw color with a thin, white head and moderate carbonation. Smells grainy with a spicy hop presence. Flavors start off with sweetish malts, followed soon by a hop kick. Very grassy and floral. Palate washes clean just a little too quickly for my taste, however. Mouthfeel is a bit slick and lightbodied with moderate carbonation. Of the three year-rounds from Rahr, this is, by far, my favorite. Highly drinkable."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Opinion: It may have sounded like I was getting down on this beer, but it actually tastes pretty good. There are a couple things out of balance for my taste, but overall it is pretty palatable."
"Clear bright honey gold water with a small quickly disappearing white head. Huge bubbles in dozens of columns streaming up from the bottom of the pint glass. Wafts of mild grain can be detected but not much else in the nose. Taste is crispy malt with some corn flavors. Nothing unpleasant, refreshing finish. The mouthfeel is fine for the style, thin to medium, with a fuller feel midway through. This is an easy to drink style and this brew satisfies."
"12 ounce bottle."
"The color is a lightly hazed golden with a nice level of carbonation. Only a tiny patch of bubbles constitutes this blond lager's head. The aroma consists of a mild, clean grainy sweetness with a touch of herbal hop. The taste consists of a mildly bready malt body with grain flavors becoming a force towards the middle of a sip. The overall sweetness factor is a little high, but not out of control. A touch of German hops gives this more character. Stylistically speaking, this beer seems like it fits somewhere between a very good all-malt lager and a helles. Anyway, this is an excellent session choice."
"Id rate this as a session lager and one beer to provide for guests that usually partake from the usual macro brews. This is a good way to get people to start drinking locally."
"The mouthfeel is good. Drinkability is quite good. I'd recommend this one."
"Oh yeah this is a very drinkable beverage. I would quaff this beer very often if I could. This beer, I think, would work for beer geeks and neophytes. First of all, it is tasty with plenty of subtle complexities. IMO, this is a hard style to get right and Rahr nailed it. Texas should be proud. Thanks assurbanipaul, this beer kicked major ass. Recommended."
"Pours a clear golden color with a foamy white head that settles into a wispy lace. Nose is rather delicate with notes of sweet malt, fresh grain, and floral hops with some faint notes of lemon grass. Moderate in body with a good amount of active carbonation. Taste begins with a light grain sweetness followed by some dry cracker notes and finally some spicy hops towards the finish. A very nice session beer. In fact, its hard to think of many superior choices than this to help battle the Texas summer."
"There's one inch of dense, clean, white foam. Nice. Beer is very clear, pure gold, and sports some racy-fast carbonation. Some smooth, small shapes of lacing. The nose is nice, schpooncky Saaz, fruity, crackers, a little soap. Saazy, peppery front. Full, foamy middle, with a touch of corn and tangy fruit. Finish is quite bitter, some fantastic grains. Nice, nutty, fresh. The slight harshness of the finish tames with temperature. Overall, a really good helles. Love the grains!"
"Many thanks to HardTarget for sharing this uncommon beer."
"This beer pours a nice yellow color with a 2 finger head that stays nicely over the beer. The nose is pretty unpleasant. Lots of skunked business going on. I don't like it. The flavor is very grassey, with a rather big noble hop that fades quickly to more grassey flavors. The feel is the light side of moderate. Overall, the nose really offends. The flavor is much better than the nose. I would like this one in the summer. Not bad at all."
"Pours a medium gold color with a proud 1/2"" of creamy white head. Smell is of grassy and grainy malt, no trace of hops. Taste is very grassy, stands up with any euro lager, hops are in the background, light and floral, with some metallic flavors. Mouthfeel is full and well carbonated, and this would make a good sessioning beer. Thanks again to assurbanipaul."
"A nice Helles, which is a style hard to judge because even the best examples have subtle flavors. It's not an exciting or bold style, but when done well, like this Rahr beer, it's very pleasant and quite drinkable."
"This is a very nice session beer. It could stand more maltiness in the aroma and taste. Maybe a little too hoppy to be a traditional Helles but quite drinkable."
"The aroma is sweet and malty although not overpowering at any level. The real surprise here is the taste. This is a very flavorful beer...not too sweet but with enough malty goodness to blend effortlessly with the faint hops. This is one that could become a session beer for me."
"Overall Impression: A refreshing brew. It was in the neighborhood of an American Macro Lager in flavor, but enough taste to keep me interested. Enjoyed on tap at the Flying Saucer: Ft. Worth after a few palate wreckers, so my review is probably a bit off. Ill look forward to trying a more mature brew, but a promising start for a Texas brewery!"
"Edit, 12/28/2004: Resampled from bottle, ratings upgraded slightly. Better head retention, white and frothy, cleaner aroma but still mild. Very light and attractive sitting in a glass with very fine carbonation."
