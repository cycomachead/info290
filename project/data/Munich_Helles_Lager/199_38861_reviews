"Feels strange with a dry mealy aftertaste. Overall not a good experience. Might try on tap, but will likely avoid the bottles in the future."

""
""
"Bottle of long fin drank."
"I feel like I have had this before but I suppose it would have been a long time ago. Rather happy about Ballast Point switching over to a lot of canned offerings. Pale as it gets with Pils malts and lager yeast in the drivers seat."
""
""
""
"Tasted from a 12 ounce bottle on March 29, 2015."
"The Longfin was an easy drinking lager....would be great for warmer weather days.  It poured a clear golden with fizzywhite head that did not lace.  The scent and taste were mostly grains.  Mouthfeel was lighter in body with great carbonation.  Overall it was good."
""
""
""
""
"Fruity and spicy with a decent maltiness for a lager. Hops are there but way in the background. Will be great when the weather heats up."

"Bready, no real aroma, a decent representation of the style"

"A completely average lager. Not bad and I would drink it again gladly, but nothing memorable either."
""

"For a SoCal lager, Golden Road's 329 is much better. As for Ballast Point-- their Kölsch (""Pale Ale"") and their Witbier (""Wahoo"") are MUCH better if you're looking for something light and refreshing. This is the first beer of theirs that I didn't admire."

"04/27/13 At Beer Authority, NYC. Just a taste. Looking for something crisp & refreshing & this was not it. A bit too much linger & lacked crispness. Worth another look in a different mode."

"Overall- A lager that is bursting with flavor. One of my all time favorite lagers. Extremely easy drinking. HIghly agreeable to any beer drinker, even those who must have the macros."

"Great session beer with mass appeal.  Even the wife enjoyed it."

"O Well done lager, true to the style and a treat to drink. The only caveat is the price which is a little more than one would expect."

"Overall Ballast Point nailed this pretty well.  Would love to try one that is fresh."
"O: Had high hopes for Longfin but found it good though hardly great. I appreciate everything about this lager, including its low ABV. It all says ""quality"" but nothing was found truly exceptional. A good brew but stupid expensive. At $12/6, I've likely had my last B.P. Longfin."
""
""
"Light, crisp, above average carbonation. My rating gives the brewer the benefit of the doubt. Absent mishandling by either a retailer or distributor, this beer coulda been a contender."
""
""
"D:  This is a nice refreshing and crisp Helles with solid balance but it’s a bit of your typical standard fare.  Simple and straightforward albeit still better than the macros."

"Clear straw color covered with a bubbly pure-white head that has decent retention. Aromas of peppery, herbal hops, gently sweet Pils malt, and clean lager yeast. Cereal-like Pilsner malt sweetness in the flavor with some grassy noble hops to balance and a touch of honey. Body is a little better than light keeping things very drinkable. A good light lager for sure and a more than solid choice for hot weather drinking."

"Overall: A crisp, clean, refreshing beer for the Memorial Day Weekend."

"One day I will catch a fish like the one on this label. That will be the day I metamorphose into a different person, one capable of catching any fish, much less those worthy of a wall mount. Regardless, this stuff pours a clear brass-straw topped by a short finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises dry barley, light sweet corn, sweet flowers, a touch of grass, and a few sprinkles of powdered sugar. The taste brings in more of the same, some lovely helles-style goodness trickling through my GI tract. The body straddles the line between hefty light and light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a very solid and highly drinkable little lager, something we need more of 'round here."

"Overall: A good representation of the style and a great beer to drink during a hot San Diego summer day. This could be an excellent go-to for sessioning, and is also an excellent beer to introduce those not used to craft to."

"O: Refreshing, easy to drink, and enjoyable - this might be my new go to grilling beer. Will be great in the hot NC summer."
""

"O: Pretty decent. Very grain dominant in the flavor department. Smells spot on for Helles, though. Mouthfeel is slightly too full and it is somewhat undercarbonated. Poor by Ballast Point's standards."
""
""
"Again, like the nose Ballast Point put some thought into brewing this to emulate the German style beer. The sweet biscuit malts are formidable as are the herbs and mildly hopped finish. This is a good true-to-style lager."
""
""
"Overall an easy drinking lager with just enough flavor to put AALs to shame. Nice beer."
""
""
""
""
"Aroma is rather bothersome since it contains quite a bit of corn and adjunct aroma as does the malt base in the flavor however hops are a redeeming quality and the spice notes in the flavor add crispness and match the Helles Lager profile very well. Not my favorite lager style but this fits the bill."
""
"Overall: A decent take on a Euro style lager. Good bready and citrusy taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Picked up a single to try another one from Ballast Point, who recently entered the Minnesota market. Longfin is a solid easy drinking lager, nice and balanced flavor. Good one for a hot day or if you want something easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Very pale yellow with bone white foam. Decent lacing. Smells of crackers, yeast, lemon. Tastes lightly skunky, grain, yeast, lemon. Watery light body with moderate carbonation. Very simple beer, I've had better crafted lagers. I'll drink it, but I won't buy it again."
""
"Overall: Decent lager. Better than most macros but not by much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-nice lager wheat style brew easy to drink with enough taste"
""
"Very clean and smooth. Would be a good summer beer but I've have plenty of better lagers."
""
"o - very good lager and has a lot going on for the style. damn good lawnmower beer."
""
""
""
""
"Poured one and a half cans into a 1/2 liter stein,poured a light lemon tinged dull golden with a nice fluffy one finger bone white crown that left a nice full ring of lace as it settled into a frothy mass.Aromas are grainy with a tinge of iron and straw.Grassy and mild lemony notes on the palate with a dryer more crsip malt base,a decent toasted shot in the finish.Not anything earth shattering but not looking for that today,just lookin for an after work patio beer."
""
""
""
""
"O - very good example of the style. I'd pick this up again if the price is right. Easy to drink, good flavors, well done."

"T- So disappointed in this taste. It tastes like high end Budweiser, just as it smelled. Crisp, light, refreshing, sure. But boring. Not bad, just boring. I keep looking for anything to make it unique or special, but nothing. So luckily, tonight I’m taking home one of their new cans of the Longfin, hopefully I am proven wrong and my sample was just old. I promise to re-review this beer because I love the brewery so much. They definitely need another shot."

"Thanks to woodychandler for yet another canned beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a yellow color with a 1 inch head. Smell is mild, some malts, a touch of sweetness to it. Taste is light and mild, malts, a bit of hops at the finish, not exactly bursting with flavor. Feels light in the mouth and overall is a mediocre beer."

"Okay, Cuz, come wid it! The Crack revealed yet another brimful craft CAN and I hope that the big boys are paying attention because this is how to make the CANsumer feel like they have gotten their money's worth. An inverted Glug later and we were off and running. I briefly had a finger of fizzy, foamy, bone-white head that quickly dissipated into wisps, leaving just a skim across the top in its wake. Color was a pale, straw-yellow with NE-quality clarity and I once again want to mention the plight of Lincoln, NE's own Val MidWest who has been cited for public nudity while trespassing on private property. Ha! She may beat this one and I will stop there. Say, a fizzy yellow beer from San Diego (County), California ... Doesn't someone else from the area have some choice words to say about such things? Nose is good, with a pure lager scent driven by a honey-like sweetness with an underlying grassiness, undoubtedly from Saaz hops. I say ""pure"" because one of the drawbacks of The CANQuest (TM) has been my repeated exposure to AALs and once I realized what a lager was supposed to taste like and what Prohibition desensitized us into, I wept and CANtinue to weep. Mouthfeel was medium, not overly carbonated as I may have led people to believe with my ""fizzy"" comment. The taste was more grassy than malty, which straddles a fine line between a German and a Czech but as the site's description reads ""... a bit more subdued and in balance with malts", I will bow in deference. It was not as in-your-face as a Czech Pils, lending credence to the CAN's verbiage about being ""... solidly balanced", but as a self-avowed hophead, I would now like to challenge my Westie Cuz to make a Czech Pils in a CAN. Finish was, indeed, ""... clean with a hint of hops"" so kudos for truth in advertising. I think that by ""clean," they are referring to the qualities that adjuncts, especially corn, impart in a lager and this was definitely clean. That ""hint"" business puts me in mind of the old Schlitz slogan, ""Just a Kiss of the Hops"". What are we? Kissing cousins that I just get a peck on the cheek?!? I want a kiss like my Old Lady's, where she punches me in the mouth with her lips! All jagging aside, this was a solid iteration of the style and would definitely be cooler-worthy in my humble estimation."

"O: Aside from the feel, this is a remarkably average lager. Served its purpose, nonetheless. being thirst-quenching and refreshing on this first hot day of summer."
""
""
"O: not a bad lager at all... yeah, it does pack malt flavor similar to a Helles... dry enough, but maybe a bit to doughy to have more than 2-3 in one sitting"
""
"Pours a clear amber with a modest head in the big 22 oz glass. More of the club soda taste. Not as crisp as I'd like in a lighter lager, but not very malty either. Drinkable but even less interesting than many industrial lagers. A slight tanginess is about the best I can say for it, and it still has that kind of sweet nearly insipid taste. An earthy tough to the not very bitter hops. I would hope for a good San Diego style lager from somebody around here to counteract all the over-hyped IPAs. However,the closest I can come to a favorite local lager is Craftsman in Pasadena."

"D/O: Full of traditional qualities, this American pale lager does a credible job of measuring up to the German archetype. The constant craft beer drinker may be misled, dared to contemplate how this beer does not stand apart meaningfully from everyday adjunct lagers. In fact, the truth could not be farther away from such a thought. In a direct comparison, evidence of traditional ingredients and careful contemplation on the part of the brewer ooze from this product. It should not be mistaken for an aggressive, next-generation American craft pilsner such as Sam Adams Noble Pils or Green Flash Fizzy Yellow. This is for the old-school beer purists--and those that simply order 'a beer' when trying Beachwood BBQ for the first time."

"O: I’m seeing a lot of low scores from what I assume are non-fresh bottles shipped across the country. I think the cans will mitigate this issue because this is a solid, refreshing beer with a touch of hops and spice to make it worth enjoying. Buy it fresh and I don’t think you’ll be disappointed."
"Not bad, though I have had much better lagers. Several made at the Blind Pig Brewery itself. Nothing more than a slightly above average lager. Good for an intro into better examples of the style."
"Nothing bad, but on the boring and bland side for a brewery as good as ballast point."
""
"Overall - Lagers are light in nature, but this is ridiculous. Boring, relatively flavorless and utterly disappointing. Sorry Ballast Point, this beer sucks."
""
""

"O: A classic craft lager for the summertime. I don't now why I'm seeing bottles of this for the first time come wintertime, but I'll be looking for this in June."

"Pours a clear light yellow with a foamy white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and some grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with a grain flavor on the finish. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is pretty tasty and refreshing."
""
""

"Lighter medium body, decent carbonation, crisp on the tongue. Not a ton of exciting flavor going on here - not something I'd drink again."
"I heard this will be released in bottles soon if it hasn't already."
""
"O: Pretty simple light lager, but not really my favorite."
"Light gold color, quickly fading head. Smells like a cheap malt liquor like you'd find in a 40oz. Tastes like Miller Genuine Draft. My friend and I were really disappointed. Ending up making red beers from it since it was so awful. When I got home I ended up drain pouring it. Hate to give a beer from BP such a low mark but it really was awful. Pretty sure my growler was clean so I don't get it. Maybe I just have to stay away from this style."
"Overall: This is delicious and ridiculously drinkable. I want to take down an entire growler right now."
"Pours a light yellow with a pretty good white head. Smell is a little bit of grain and grassiness; not the best overall, but for its style pretty good. Pretty light flavor, not surpassing most others of the style as the nose did. Mouthfeel was light and crisp, and drinkability was nice. Overall, very nice for its style, but still lacking in too many departments to justify a higher score than this."
"D- Im sure the ABV is low and i finished my pint with ease, but I wont be going back for it anymore, not my style I guess."
"D - A very easy beer to drink, in ABV and flavor/body."
"Crisp medium body that is slightly spiced with some nice bready yeast, pilsner malt crisp light fruit and subtle hops. I'm shocked at the flavor and complexity of this beer after how awful it looked and bland it smelled. This is a pleasant surprise. Spice notes up front with clean crisp apple and pear notes followed by some slightly earthy straw notes. Slightly watered down with a subtle hoppy finish."
"Could have drank a lot more of this one"
"Md body and hangs on the tongue enough to keep the malt and sweet around a while. Nice, very drinkable."
"Light body with good carbonation and a mild ABV, this is a brew that takes the heat out of Summer. A good solid offering from Ballast Point that suits it's style well...recommended!"
"Overall: I am a big fan of Ballast Point brews, so as soon as I spied this new offering it didnt take me long to decide to try it. In fact throughout the whole 5 hours of the Mammoth Festival of Beers, despite the great array of brews on sale, I managed to sink a few of these. A great brew for the hot Summer. Enjoyable."
