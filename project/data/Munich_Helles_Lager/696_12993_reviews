"Had this on draft at sushi restaurant in West Hartford. A very satisfying, cleanly made golden lager. Carbonation level was great, held a nice head throughout most of it, and was a great pairing with the sushi. Could have been served colder, but that's not the beer's fault. Overall, among the better new england golden lagers on the market."
"O: I can drink a lot of this, too many. I have never had any other beers of this style but this particular one reminds me of a american light lager with flavor.... way more flavor and complexity especially given its clear and light appearance"
"While the body is light in color, it has some depth. As the spritzy carbonation fades, a sweet and rounded caramel sweetness emerges providing a slick and refreshing, gulpable brew. Lots of flavors for a fairly small beer!"
"On the palate, this Lager is almost exactly what I expected: crisp, clean, and easy-drinking. There's a touch of malty sweetness up front, which just a slightly dry finish on the back-side. A deliciously balanced brew! I now know why this Munich Style Lager is ranked so highly on beerAdvocate! Why did I not try this one sooner?"

"Very easy drinking, and low ABV. I highly recommend this one."
"Nicely done. A straightforward representation of the style that was the perfect compliment to a gorgeous August afternoon. I'm not sure I've ever seen this on tap in Boston, but I wouldn't hesitate to order it again given the chance."
"O - Nice lager. Has a good amount of flavor without being too complex or challenging. Seems like a really solid summer session beer."
"Cheers!"
"D - Very drinkable. Great beer all around. Great beer for the summer/outdoors."
"Pour yields a good white head of foam and some spotty lacing on the way down. The nose brings a nice subtle noble hoppiness plus light grain and a bit of bread. Excellent balance between all the components. The flavor is very nice as well with a good lightly-sweetened malt presence and a good level of hop flavor and bitterness to cut through the malt character. Light body and really crisp. Great dry finish and a high amount of carbonation. Really, really solid beer. Thomas Hooker seriously knows how to make lagers. Great way to say cheers."
"Drinkability: I've quite enjoyed this beer and found it quite drinkable. Each sip has followed quite easily from the last and it was quite easy to have a second one. I'll certainly be happy to have this beer again and am glad to have tried it when I had the chance."
"This beer is my new favorite. I got this beer at a beer tasting at the Thomas Hooker Brewery in Bloomfield Ct. The beer was really fresh with a nice golden appearance. This beer tastes great and is perfect for summer days. I'd recommend this beer to anyone who likes really light colored beers."
"D - Very drinkable. Great for outdoors."
"D: As the style was intended, this beer is highly drinkable. Nice flavor, and smooth. I could drink these one after another, all night long. These will be a staple in my fridge all summer long."
"D-Not bad, a decent simple, straight forward lager. Decent flavour overall. I like the fruitiness in the background, whether intended or not."
"Poured a nice carbonated golden hue into an American pint glass, with a finger of white head and decent lacing. The smell was decidedly malty, but I could also detect a bitter balancing hop presence. The taste was better than expected; certainly a heap of malt in this one, but also some caramel and toffee flavor mixed with some hop bitter dryness, and finishing on a dry note. Very nice carbonated, medium-bodied mouthfeel. Very good session beer."
"Aroma reminds me of freshly baked sweetbread, very nice. Taste is definetly malt oriented dominated by bready and slightly toasty malt flavors, with a faint grassy hop presence lurking in the background. Full mouthfeel, with slightly lower than average carbonation seems to enhance the malty flavors of this brew, without hampering the drinkability. One of my favorites from Hooker."
"Drinkability: excellent, a fantastic refreshing session beer."
"I don't know how it use to be before Conn. turned on Hooker for the direction they took, but it could work with a little tuning. I still drank it pretty fast. just eager to clear the fridge for some other stuff I suppose."
"D - Not bad, but a little too heavy on the butter flavor, unfortunately. Not overly crisp, either. The diacetyl really detracted from my overall enjoyment of this otherwise tasty style."
"Wasn't too impressed honestly, nothing really stuck out with this one besides the drinkability. Wouldn't go out of my way to find this, but would have it again if I came across it on-tap."
"Taste is smooth and citrusy, bready with a zing, good carbonation (especially considering), quite buttery."
"It's clear, light gold in the glass with a short white head. The aroma immediately hits me with spicy, grassy Euro hops, with bready malts in the background. The flavor is spot on for the style with a mix of biscuit and light toast paired evenly with gentle, but spicy hops. While this beer isn't drastically different from other helles lagers in terms of the flavors present, I believe it stands out because everything is so rich as a whole. This beer is drinkable, yet more aromatic and full-flavored than many of the best in this style."
"Drinkability: It's just a simple Golden Lager, but hell if it isn't highly drinkable. Overall, it was just a nice refreshing light beer that would make a nice choice for a summer Lager session beer. I thought it just came in those expensive swing top bottles, but it's nice to see that it now comes in a 22 oz. bomber bottle."
"D: A great semi-sweet malted lager that was crisp clean and left you waiting for the next sip."
"Hooker has had some nice offerings outside of their staple of fairly non-impressive variety pack brews. I should seek out an Old Marley Barleywine of there's still some to be had, just to see how they step outside the box."
"Body is on the light side with a creamy mouthfeel and light carbonation. 22 ounces disappears quickly."
"drinkability - Easy drinking summer beer, enjoyed this one"
"I am not typically a fan of lager beers. I tend to prefer ales and heavier beers, but I find myself drawn to this particular lager. First of all, it is very drinkable. No aftertaste. Not very heavy, but not too light either. Color is a dark, deep gold hue. Does not seem to hold much carbonation or form much head - would be nicer if it did - so I dinged it a bit for appearance. I can't explain the smell, but I like it. Taste is a bit bland, but very pleasant. In all, this is for me, a very solid lager and one I would choose over many other lagers. I think Thomas Hooker is an underrated brewery."
"This one pours a tinted gold hue with a pillowy two finger white head that slowly dies down to a solid layer. Little to no stickiness with bubbles racing to the top throughout the entire tasting. Smell is of big noble hops, pepper, butter, and some faint caramel malt. Probably the best smelling lager I've ever sampled. Clean buttery biscuit flavors up front with some pepper and spice emerging midway. Aftertaste is very weak and almost fades away to nothing, but a bit of a hop bite lingers. Mouthfeel is a creamy medium body with a good amount of carbonation. What a great lager. I really wish this was available in Central New York because this could easily become my staple summer beer. If you're someone who appreciates a solid lager, definitely get your hands on this one."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger plus foamy head, some sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, slightly hoppy, some spicyness, and some caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, slightly spicy, and some caramel thrown in. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is another awesome brew from Thomas Hooker, they do a Helles justice, recommended."
"I know that some of the swingtop bottles are off, so if you get a bad one, you'll know it from the non-enthuastic pop on the swingtop."
"Bought from Bierkraft. A great Helles. Almost perfection. Golden yellow with a foamy white head. Biscuity malt aromas. Drink more lagers. More maltiness and bread in the flavor, delicious. Crisp and smooth at the same time. Soft and luscious. Again, great lager. I feel this style is underappreciated, it's one of my favorites, great session beer."
"Head faded quickly with big bubbles of carb. Lacing fooled me, Ithought it clung pretty well at first then kinda disappeared as did the head to a small bead around the edges. Color was that of a golden/ orange with a murky haze with a ""thick "" look to the body. first couple nose hits were that of a dank basement and wet wood but towards the last couple fingers I stuck my nose right in the glass and it came back as a watered down rubbing alchohol- strange. Taste was immediately sweet and floral, citrus onthe front with an ever so mellow hop finish, slightly bitter, great balance between malts and hops. Mouthfeel was on the side of a cream ale,nice full body, and surprisingly smooth considering the amount of busy little bubbles that danced throughout the sitting. The first time I tasted this I knew I fouhd a winner so I went out and bought a case (12) of the 1.9 oz. flip top bottles (ouch ) $64 and change. Really hope that Curt and the boys at Troutbrook get away from the fancy (expensive ) bottling and release this in 12 oz. 6 packs. love everything about this except the price."
"Smooth, yet biting. Thinner body, good bubbles. Very easy drinking, enjoyable beer. Thanks, Shannon."
"A light yellow-orange brew with a slight head that fades quickly. Not much lacing going on. The aroma is vague, bread/wheat, suggests a light refreshing beer. The taste comes on with a lemon highlight and a murky hops, but I detect the sweaty socks syndrome. It has a peppery finish but there is a wheaty sweetness that grows on you as you get to the end. Friends seemed to like this quite a bit but I couldn't see the attraction. It's OK, reasonably refreshing but just not crispy enough for my tastes in this style. Hooker is excellent as a rule so it may be me more than the beer, just not my style."
"Munich Style Golden Lager is a delicious version of this often overlooked style. It's the best domestic Munich helles that I've had and is easily the equal of the (also exceptional) Ayinger Jahrhundert Bier. Thanks scthaden."
"A good beer. Nice taste profile and relatively light."
"Poured out of a 22oz standard bomber. Poured a slightly cloudy golden with an excellent fluffy white head, but no real lacing. Retention was decent. The aroma was quite light and slightly dusty. Sweet cream and lager yeast were predominant. The taste was better with tangy malt and a crisp typical lager flavor with some apple on the finish. The mouthfeel is creamy and delicious. Good matched body for the style- a little heft, but not enough to overwhelm. Pretty nice- I've really enjoyed all the German styles from this brewery."
"This was pretty good. A lager lover's lager. As I said it is what it is. By no means a taste bomb, but yet a nice, clean, interesting lager. Could be paired with a lot of food styles but they would all have to be simple, non-spicy fare or it would overwhelm it. A nice change of pace. I'd recommend it and drink it again...give it a shot."
"Note- not a big fan of the swingtop. This beer was bumped by another beer in the fridge and it opened up a bit. Give me the traditional cap anyday."
"Medium bodied, creamy, and easy to drink."
"D- It is pretty good for the style. Not one of my favorite styles but it is drinkable."
"A refreshing balance of flavor and lightness of body makes this a really nice choice for a multi-purpose beer. There's nothing in there that should put off one who loves Pabst and plenty to enjoy for those that dig more challenging brews. The price of a 500mL bottle makes this a once in awhile occasion... but if in six pack form under $10? Yes, yes, yes."
"A tremendous Helles with balanced flavor and texture. Troutbrook did a nice job bringing some exciting flavor aspects to a pretty mundane style. A nice session lager for springtime when the weather turns a bit warmer."
"Was able to pick this up on a recent trip to CT, actually surprised that it made it this long? The brew poured to a clear golden color with a slight white head that broke down quite quickly but did leave a little lacing at the top of the glass. The aroma seems to be very doughy with a mix of grassy notes. The taste is very smooth, malt characteristics stand out giving it a toasted flavor and ends with just a light hop flavor that rounds it out very well. At 5.3% ABV this is a nice session brew, would be fantastic during the warmer months I would think. Overall a good offering from Troutbrook."
"This one is a pretty regular offering at The Cambridge House in Granby, CT, which is where I have had it. I very much like Helles beers in general, and this one is quite good in the bottle. However, it excels on draft. The mouthfeel is much softer, which makes the drinkability excellent. The appearance, smell and taste are on style. If you like this in the bottle, seek it out on draft; it is worth it."
"This is a nice treat once in a while. I would,t drink many of these but find it very refreshing."
"The aroma is a rich grainy thing that smells a bit like bread and wheat husks, but with a faintly dusty note. The body is bright gold and holds a fluffy, but mildly bubbly, white head. Grain accented fore is hearty and yet still light on the tongue. Tastes like a baked wheat cake with notes of barley and oats. That flavor gives it a thicker feel than the liquid itself possesses. Very light, mostly floral, hops with a slightly salty finish."
"Drinkability: Not being a lager drinker, this is not one of my favorite styles; however, this is a very well made example of a Munich Helles"
"Pours a gorgeous gold in body, with a sticky bright white head and constant upward carbonation bubbles. Almost perfect. Aroma is a different story, with not much there, only some slight cereal notes. On the palate, clean and clear, with some nice fruit to the malts (sweet berries?) and a finish that's just shy of dry, but long and buzzy nonetheless. Mouthfeel features zippy carbonation and a good weight for the style -- substantial but not heavy. This is a very good, very drinkable brew... one of the better Hooker beers, I would say."
"Cheers!"
"Wow, not being a big fans of lagers did not know what to expect but was very impressed. heard the Munich Lager was unbelievable on tap and they were definetly right. There was not to much a presence on the hops to take away from the overall taste and smell. Poured a beautiful yellow-orange color, but with very little head. Would definetly get it on tap again, if of course you can find it on tap. Actually was sitting next to the brewer from Hooker at the time Paul, so that just made it special too for some reason."
"More bitter than the nose would indicate there is an herbal hop presence dominating until midsip when the beer has warmed sufficiently to allow a mild malt sweetness to creep into being. Mouthfeel is moderately smooth with decent carbonation levels, though it is a little thin."
"Balance is what this lager is all about. Hits the spot on a hot summer evening but would be damn tasty anytime."
"Great hot day drinking."
"D: This is the kind of beer that is drinkable because it’s got some flavor to it, but it isn’t over-powering. It’s not very filling at all and goes down quite easily. One of those beers that you “forget” you’re drinking. I think this beer can best be described as “how a micro does macro”. It was pretty good, but not out of the ordinary."
"The beer is a bit overcarbonated for the medium to medium-light body, resulting in too much foaming on the palate. While this does not make the beer terribly unpleasant to drink, it doesn't encourage further sipping, either. Overalll, nothing truly distinguishing about this lager. No aspect is that far from average, but without any particular strengths or aspects of the beer blending well (such as a solid maltiness mixed with a present, but ephemeral hop nuance) there's no reason to return to it."
"Drinkability was average. Decent;y made but very boring IMHO. I'll stick with the bigger brews from this phenomenal brewery."
"895"
"Vibrant pour, generating a tall eggshell colored head of loosely packed small and medium bubbles. The head is slow to settle, and leaves no lacing. Brassy gold with tons of jetting carbonation streams. The smell is clean and slightly husky with some grassy hops. The taste is sweet and husky also a bit grainy with a gentle spicy hop finish. Nice and well meshed, not dominant in any one area. Medium bodied and light on the tongue, with moderate carbonation. Refreshing and enjoyable, this was a nice beer, if just a touch sweet. Quite drinkable and an easy suggestion for new craft drinkers."
"N.B. Served way too cold on draft - not sure what effect this had."
"This is very drinkable stuff....I will buy this again...was a bargain at $3.29 for a bomber."
"Drinkability:Flavorful and easy to drink,would be even better in the summer as it would be quite refreshing."
"Poured from a 22oz. bomber, with wonderful golden color and nice head at the top. Light citrus aromas with a touch of flowers, with a little bit of malt coming through at the end. The taste comes in with the roasted malt at the start and then some lite hops comes in at the end. The feel is medium bodied with a nice crisp, clean finish. This is a really drinkable beer, particularly in sessions, with great malt flavor, but with enough hops to balance it out. This is a great starter beer for thos who drink prodominantly macro brews."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and chewy with a rush of carbonation that comes with each sip. Easy to drink and really quite refreshing. A tasty representation of the style and an easy candidate for a session brew. I'd sample this more often if it was readily available. Thanks to UnionMade for this one!"
"This pours a reddish gold color with a huge head.There is alot of carbonation in this beer.The smell is very floral and full of yeast.This is a very good taste with a full flavor of malt, some spices, and hops.The m/f is very well balanced between hops and malt.This is a very crisp,clean beer thats very refreshing and would go down great on a hot summer day."
"Overall just a wonderful beer. Full of flavor and way more complex than I would have imagined. I only wish that Troutbrook comes out with different styles of lagers."
"A highly enjoyable example of what an ""everyday"" lager should be."
"Clean tasting and easy to drink. This is the beer that could convert the masses from macro produced beers. Enjoy."
"This beer is very drinkable and very refreshing. Thomas Hooker continues to prove they are worthy of lots of respect from the beer world."
"definately smooth and creamy with a solid finish. goes great with a beautiful, crisp, new england fall day. i still haven't had anything by thomas hooker that i don't throughly enjoy!"
"Poured out an almost crystal clear golden yellow with a good sized white frothy head. Aroma is rich with grain and a nice light grassy hops. Some doughy malts were present as well. Flavor was similar with a big grain and biscuit malt. Light lemon with a faint crisp hoppiness. Light toastiness as well. Finishes on a lightly bitter grassy note. Crisp clean and solid body. Just about as drinkable as water. Very smooth going down and refreshing. Good stuff."
"I had this on tap at RedBones Wednesday night. Deep gold to amber color, mildly hazy with a thin tan head. Rich malty aroma of dates caramel much toffee. Taste has a lot of caramel, slight peanut brittle, almost chocolate. Nice rich mouth feel. This beer is the closest thing to a year-round Octoberfest that Ive seen. Nice every day beer. Great drinkability."
"Let the American Craft Lager Revolution begin!"
"Overall a very good lager. I like it."
"Prosit!"
"I might have given more 5s where I put 4.5s, but it's sort of against my principles. But it merits at least one. Hooker does damn fine work. Big ups to CT."
"Lots o' li'l bubbles that make this beer almost fizzy at first--but it mellows out to a very smooth and just slightly crisp but with hints of an ever-so-slight creamy finish. Poured a light brown-gold and with no head (but that was a result of the over carefule pour). Nose is crisp and clean with some strong grain tonesand herbs. Flavor is toast and bread and just a tad chewy. For some reason this beer makes me think of the mahogany and saw dust from the old work shop. Hops are very toned down, almost oldish, and provides some nice herbal and lemon hints."
"Drinkability and Notes  This is flavorful and easy to drink, particularly on a hot summer afternoon. This is one of the better Munich style lagers that I have had and yet another reason to drink local. Most imported light lagers, in my experience, have an oxidized/skunked component that this does not have because it did not have to be shipped across the ocean."
"D- We need more lagers like this in the NE, packed with flavor and so easy to drink."
"Thanks to danadeny for the acquistions!"
"This is by far the best lager I have ever had. If you think lagers lack diversity and character, try this one. It will tear down ever preconceived notion of what a lager is and can be."
"Overall...very very drinkable...easy to consume and enjoy! Another nice brew from Troutbrook!"
"thanks paul for enhancing my cinco de biere-o"
"Medium bodied, very smooth and easily drinkable, really drinkable, drinkable enough that I wish I bought more."
"This Munich Helles lager poured a slightly hazy, golden to pale amber color with tall, creamy, off-white foam that persisted and clung to the glass in clumps. The smell was hops and malt with a touch of biscuit and a light floral hop aroma. The taste was bready malt with a light sweetness. There was a touch of vinous Munich malt present. It had a mild hoppiness throughout with a bit of floral hops layered on. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium body and modest carbonation. The bready-malty flavor lingered a while in the aftertaste. This was a nice, smooth, easy drinking lager, and it invoked memories of Germany. Thanks to ErikTheRed for this bottle."
"Thanks to kmpitz2 for sharing this one. Pours an orange color with a small head that dies off quickly and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma has a clean caramel malt with some grassy hops. The flavor is much the same. Caramel malts with some grassy hops. Well balanced and smooth. Very clean finish. Good lager here."
"Thanks to Kev (kmpitz2) for sharing this one. 22oz. bomber poured into a snifter. It pours a slightly hazy medium orange color with one finger of head. There is a decent amount of lacing. The smell is light and malty, with some classic light lager grassiness. The taste is slightly sweet, and has some honey characteristics to it. A bit of hop bitterness on the finish. The body is smooth and thick. The drinkability is great. This is a nice pleasant lager."
"Thans to ppoirtas for this one. It pours a peachy orange color with a finger of head that falls to slightly coat the beer. The nose is caramel sweet and grassy. The flavor is not bad. The grassey/grainey tones are prevalent, but balanced with a caramel sweetness. The everpresent lager funk comes through as well. The feel is moderate, with enough carbonation to carry it through. Not bad at all for a lager. I find it refreshing."
"Largely clear with a beautiful golden hue that lays a foundation that allows tawny-coppery influences to shine. There is plenty of animation noticed in the liquid. The head was white in color; at the apex the foam was slightly over two fingers in height. Head retention was fair; it faded quickly to a thin, soapy cap. This small cap did last for a while. There was no subsequent lacing. The appearance is average, on the whole. Sure the color is lovely but I want more to look at, if the head retention was better and there was some lace the appearance would be much improved. Oh well. It gets better from here! The nose is soft but ample in maltiness. There are kisses of toffee. I can easily notice whispers of herbal flowers. Caramel biscuits. Toasty. There are very weak, nondescript, fruity notes. The potency is moderate in potency but I really like what it says. Ghost suggestion of spiciness. Clean. This must be from Munich, CT. The nose is dead-on for the style. It is perfectly articulate. I do wish the bouquet had more liveliness though. It is extremely inviting! The palate is fantastic. Addicting. Liquid cocaine. This beer needs to come in liter(s) bottle because 22-ounces is not enough. I am drinking this faster than I can take write things down. I really dont even want to review this beer anymore; it is so dam tasty. I mean screw it. Really. Shit. Ill keep righting. The malt profile is perfect in this beer, it is sweet but wide and it encompasses soft caramel flavors and some toffee. There are hints of toasty biscuit with a whisper of honey. Sugar cookie. Toasted bread. Clean at the finish yet the aftertaste has some spicy hoppy notes. Damn this is good. It is simple but it is also everything I want with the style. Lovely. The mouthfeel is relaxing, a touch fuller then medium in body. The carbonation is on the low side but it is very fitting. Drinkability is perfect. I wish I had many more bottles. Wow, this beer is great. Id love to session with this beer. The complexity is low but the end result cant be ignored. Thanks UnionMade this beer was awesome."
"Bomber bottle, pours light amber orange, mostly clear, some chill haze. White head, nice lacing going on. Nose is spicey and malt. Not real familiar with the style. Quite dry on the tongue, medium bodied. Notes of orange peel, pepper and some bready malt. Crisp, dry and refreshing. This brew is crying out for a nice salad and some cheese to mingle with. Another tasty concoction from Hooker."
"I guess I do not understand who would want a beer with heavy feel and light flavor. I would rather have the opposite. I am a malt man, but this needs more hops and less body to pull it off. This was a fine beer, but 22 oz. is enough for me."
"Pours a pretty copper-amber with a small and active off white head. Little ring of lace is all that's left. Smells mildly citrusy and honey sweet. Tastes a lot more malty than I would've thought. Solid bit of caramel with a distinguished backbone of lemon and grass. Moderately thin like a lager should be. Easily drinkable and downright tasty."
"Haven't had a bad Hooker yet, and this continues that trend!"
"Crisp, lively and superbly balanced. An unexpectedly delicious session brew, since this isn't one of my favorite styles. I'm a huge hophead and tend to prefer bigger beers like barleywines, so why am I drooling over a light summer lager? I guess the moral here is that even an unexciting style, if brewed properly, can be outstanding."
"Overall, this was a good representation of the style, very enjoyable."
"The smell was mediocre, consisting mostly of grains and light hops. It seems a little off. The taste is a bit better, being crisp and bright with a touch of honey. The mouthfeel is good and clean while the drinkability is very good."
"Thanks Paul."
"Reflection: This is my first beer from the Troutbrook brewing company and I thought it was excellent! I will be this one onto my friends and family."
"A very nice, crisp beer, perhaps a little more in line with a North American blonde ale than others in the style. Nice interplay of malt - barely to the sweet side with a touch of clover honey. Just the slightest hint of some orchard fruit - somewhat tart up front."
"This is a very good helles lager. Pours golden honey color with 4 finger head in my Lowenbrau 0.5L stange. The aromas are like crisp dry fall day in the woods. The taste is clean, bright malt with a slight nutty grain undertoe. Dry finishing beer that strikes a super balance between the sweet malt flavors and the noble hops. This is a beer that goes down well one after the other."
"This is really a soft, subtle session bier masterpiece. It's certainly no monster, and won't flood your palate with flavor, but for a normal strength beer, I'm having a hard time thinking of stuff I'd rather drink. It blows my mind that this is brewed in my home state. This is the kind of stuff better suited for sale in the tapered 500ml bottle with lots of german text. Very, very authentic, probably what it's like to go to Munich and drink helles bier from the source. I count myself lucky to have Paul Davis and the folks at Thomas Hooker making beer only 20 minutes away. One hell of a summer beer, and a different style for a change. If you're in Connecticut for the summer, do yourself a favor and buy a few bottles for you and your friends. Very Highly recommended."
"Taste/Mouthfeel/Drinkability: All at once, crisp sour apples and a touch of spice wrapped in sweet malt, followed by a very mild bitterness and then a sweet malty finish. Very carbonated, light to medium bodied but amazingly smooth and creamy. Taste was extremely fresh, clean and invigorating. Easily the best lager I've had to date. This is easily something worth stocking up on for frequent enjoyment. Must be nice to live in CT. Great, great stuff. Thanks again to UnionMade for the opportunity."
"Overall, the beer was pretty good... not as good as the beers of theirs I tried at the Connecticut River Brewfest, but good in its own right."
"Thanks to ErikTheRed for this lager."
"This bomber came to me courtesy of BeerAdvocate spritdeus via a trade. After poring, the beer revealed a clear golden colored body, and a two inch tall foamy off white head. The aroma was clean with honey like pilsner malt, and faint florally grassy hops. The taste was malt driven, with a sweet honeysuckle flavor and very mild hop bitterness. The mouthfeel was creamy and soothing with a medium thick body. This style is supposed to be difficult to pull off as there is no way to hide any off flavors. And Troutbook is clearly at the top of their game, as they have brewed a beer that does not possess any off flavors that would need hiding."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a big ol' 2"" slightly off-white head above the amber brew. Laces excellently, and aroma is mainly of pale malts, with an effervescent undertone. Taste is maltier than any other golden lager I've had, which is nice, and well-balanced. Mouthfeel and drinkability are excellent as well. Still wishing they could get these over the northern border, would make my daily brew choices that much harder."
"First sip, beer is average bodied and has average carbonation levels. The bubbles are very fine and prickly on my tongue. Flavor is toffee sweet up front with a bit of grainy corn presence in themiddle and actually has a bit of a soapy astringent finish. The glass was thoroughly rinsed so I dont think it was residue in the glass. The beer is very smooth and easy to drink. QUite refreshing on a warm Sept evening. Another great beer from Thomas Hooker!"
"Wyll-"
"Thanks to wyllder for the bomber. First, lager is not my first choice in brews, but with som elike this, I could move it up the scale. This offering poured avery light golden amber with a nice head that laced nicely down the glass. Smell was malt and grassy hops...a very nice blend. Taste was equally balanced between a lighytly sweet malt aroma and grassy hops flavors. Mouthfeel is medium, and not overly crisp, but that's fine with me. Easy on the drinkability scale...actually a sipper due to the heavier body...very nice."
"Drinkability: Damn, feels like this 22oz bomber went like a 12oz bottle. Picked up three bottles Saturday and killed them all. This is just so damn tasty. If you see this Hooker, do pick it up!"
"Draught: This one pours a clear, somewhat darker golden color. There was a bit of a white head to it, which lingered a little while. The aroma is very malty, but not overly sweet. Some hint of hops and floral notes in the background. The taste is very crisp and clean. Somewhat less than medium bodied. A good malt flavor, with some sweetness and a hint of hops. Makes you wonder why the big 3 can't make a lager this tasty."
"Thanks to fellow BA Venom, David and I were able to try this very tasty American version of a favorite style. I wanted to make it special, so out comes my Kloster Andechs pils glass. This beer opened gently, and poured into my glass and David's (Raderberger pils glass, if you gotta know) with no big fuss or overun. The color is clear copper, very nice hue. If you take a nice glance at your glass, you have tiny streams of carbonation rising through-out the glass. Head topped both glasses at first, but has since died down. While I was impressed with the color, I have to say that what impressed me most with this beer was it's spot on aroma...mostly malt, exactly what it should smell like. I was a bit surprised that it was so authentic. After imbibing this for a while, I have to admit, my initial taste impression was of bready doughiness. Good tasting, but pronounced. Now that the beer has been warming for a while, I have to say that the mouthfeel is very good, medium. I think it could be a touch more crisp for the style, but on the otherhand, it makes it slightly more of a session beer. I am still getting nice breadiness, with a bit of hop bite and some sweet corn in the end, but I have to hand it to the brewer, no metallic notes at all. Very nice, easy to drink...if I had this on tap, I don't think I would switch to anything else at the session. Thanks again Venom!"
"Served from a 22oz bottle, fresh from the brewery. Pours into my glass a scintillating burnished gold color, crystal clear with nice effervescence and a perfectly foamy white head. Aroma is very sweet and malty, with some light german hop notes and just a hint of green apple. Sipping yields a refreshing floral hop character up front that is delicately balanced to complement the massive chewy malt center. I don't know if it's partly the freshness of the beer, but what's stuck with me since my first samples of this beer is that it's a bit like chewing on a handful of fresh cracked malt. A bit sweet, very slightly caramelized, with a nice glimmer of spicy hop bitterness in the finish. A bit of apple noticeable in the initial flavor after a bit as well. Body is not quite medium, which combined with the taste make it immensely drinkable. Excellent beer, cheers to Paul and Troutrook for continuing to crank out some top quality beer."
"True to its name, this beer has a light golden hue, and is topped with a frothy white head that settles down quickly. Light aroma of sweet malt and corn. Flavor is also mostly sweet malt and corn, plus a bit of citrus and butterscotch. Very low hop presence, perhaps just a bit in the finish and aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel, with a fresh and crisp flavor."
