"Malty and a little cloying on the finish there. (I expected a stronger hop note?) Something about it was syrupy?"
"A great looking beer.  So smooth and easy to drink."

"Served in a willibecker at the lodge.  Pours a golden-orange hue with a slightly hazy clarity and a loose, bright white head.  Nose expresses light, fruity esters, a slightly grassy quality and a hint of sour mash.  Taste follows nose with the addition of a light biscuit malts, a hint of sweetness and a faint, lingering sour mash character towards the back.  Mouthfeel is light in body with a pleasant, even carbonation and a clean, mostly crisp finish.  Overall, a solid domestic Helles on par with those I've had in Germany; however, I'd like to see more of a clean finish."

"I had two glasses while dining at the Green Mountain Inn.  Went well with both meals, one light and one being a heavier meal.  Very refreshing and sessionable."

"Overall - I was hoping for some VT magic in this, but it's just another mediocre American lager."
"Tap: Poured a deep golden color Helles with a small foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of clean cereal notes with light floral aroma. Taste is also dominated by light floral aromas with some clean cereal notes a medium sweet finish. Body is about average for style with medium carbonation. Refreshing and well brewed for style."

"Overall - Solid lager, would definitely put these down and at 4.8% this is a craft that you can bring to a party."

"Rich malty and spicy aroma. Full complex taste on a light lager. It is amazing how much flavor can be piled on such a light frame. Crisp and refreshing with a dry finish. A great example of the Helles style."

"This beer was good enough to have a few of. I'm looking forward to trying more Trapp beers on future trips, and maybe even visiting the brewery."
"Had a pint at the Farm House in Burlington VT. Damn, it's hard to ask for much more from a helles. There's a crisp dry Brady malt character in the aroma with a little balance of spicy hops. There's mild lager fruit over the malt, but it's not sweet. Otherwise it's clean and super drinkable. Find this beer."
"O: Goes down easy, tasty, not filling, mild kick, a very good representation of the style."

"Overall really nice, great lagers, tons of cracked straw and toasty pils like malts, nice fruity lager, clean crisp finish with nice hops overall."
"Overall a top notch lager and a super drinkable treat."
"Taste is classic, full of quality malt, and mildly bitter. This is what the AAL's aspire to be....like a Bud made with care and quality ingredients. Crisply dry finish with vaguely lingering bitterness. A nice example of what is to me a none-too-interesting style. Not the hugest fan of this kind of beer but it's clearly done very well."
"This is my second Trapp beer tasted and I continue to be overwhelmed. I told my daughter to bring as much of this home from Vermont as she could and she was kind enought to do so. This beer comes in a big flippy bottle. This is as rich and luscious a Helles as I've ever had, which is plenty. A nice hazy gold in the glass; the bottle-poured head fluffed right up. Decent lacing followed the beer down all the way. Wonder-full malts with just the right hop balance create a great, smooth taste. The sweetness is in there but just enough. The conditioning is light which adds to the silky mouthfeel. This is a great beer!"
"Pours a deep golden color with a huge rich off white head that sticks around forever. Smells of grainy bready malts with rich melanoids mixed in. Earthy floral hops are more aggressive than I would have thought. Taste is sweet grainy toasty bready malts with hints of honey, burnt sugar and an earthy hop bitterness that threw me at first. Finish leaves a sweetness with an earthy hop bitterness. Medium body with crisp carbonation and a sweet almost sticky mouthfeel. Great Lager that I'm glad I tried on a whim."
"On tap. Pours a translucent straw color with a 1/2 inch of head. Good amount of lacing. Sweet toasted malt aroma. Very crisp and refreshing. Slightly buttery. Nice sweet malty flavor. Overall its nothing over the top but its a solid beer. Worth having again. Highly drinkable and very satisfying."
"Poured into a massive imperial pilsner glass, golden with a slight haze and a big foamy white head that has a decent retention. Smell is bready malts, sweet and somewhat sugary, some raw grains. Taste is sweet up front with a slightly bitter finish, sweet bread dough, pilsner malts, spicy hops. Medium bodied with a medium carbonation, clean finish. Helles is one of my favorite German styles and this does not disappoint. I think this is one of the best American takes on the style and I would gladly order this whenever I can. A very drinkable beer."
"Well done."
"This is a very tasty beer with great drinkablity."
"Very tough to get the spicy hop zip in a beer as gently malted and hopped as this. Well done."
"Off tap at the brewery this beer was a perfectly clear, golden color with one finger of frothy white head. The retention of the cap was average but the collar did last quite a while and the lacing was scattered and streaky. The aroma was nice and dry, crystal malt, Vienna malt, lager yeast, grains and a slight boozy note. The flavors were very dry and clearly grainy (most the Vienna/Crystal again) with hints of toasted malt and a little mustiness as it warmed up. Much like a Pilsner I found it to be crisp and refreshing. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body medium/light and the carbonation perfect."
"A great new local example that is more than appropriate for this setting."
"Tate is phenomenal, it's light ad crisp and super hoppy. It's very drinkable ad smooth. One of the best helles i've ha in a long time!"
