3.83,6.4,3.25,4,3.75,3.75,4,"First, I hate the name. If I'd noticed it, I would never have tried it. But I'm really glad I did. I don't buy lager much, and usually only drink it when I have to, but I'll be buying this again. It's an odd-looking color -murky orange - not really appetizing but the smell has an alluring floral character. Taste is rather complex for a lager. HIghly quaffable.","Qbdoo","Apr 01, 2014"

Unfortunately, when drinking this beer all I think about is how this isn't anything better than a Budweiser. It's a fine lager and does the job, but there are much better craft beers out there.","daveh88","Feb 07, 2014"

4,11.1,3.5,4,4,4.25,4,"Beer is medium in body, with carbonation of low intensity, leading to a full, smooth (4/5) and slightly foamy (1/5) mouthfeel that's good for the beer and the style. Closes dry, with light to medium-light stickiness lingering on the palate and lips.","falloutsnow","Jan 19, 2014"

4,11.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Finally getting a chance to enjoy a pint from the source. Good people. The beer pours a clear straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises fresh grass, light flowers, and dry, wheaty biscuit. The taste brings in more of the same, the hops shining brightly without coming across as something younger folks might deem ""hoppy"". The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a damn solid helles, one of the better American versions I've had. I look forward to seeing more of this around.","TMoney2591","0"
