"Overall - a good beer from this tasters pack, definitely the lone winner in my mind. A nice Canadian option of an under represented style."

"I had yet to encounter this one on tap in this city, so figured I'd take the plunge and enjoy a 20 oz. pint. This style is a bit of a rarity when it comes to what western Canadian micros usually tackle and as an unabashed Lowenbrau fan I was intrigued. A pleasant goldenrod brassy color with a few white bubbles, this brew smells like good old prairie pilsener malt with a moderate dose of noble hop green spiciness. Popcorn and cracker malts and a little toast buttress some sour green fruit (gooseberry?) and crabapple notes, some cooked corn DMS flavor, and a little green vegetation from the hops. Not particularly assertive in the latter regard, however. Is that diacetyl as well? This one is quite sweet and sour in the finish, with a fair degree of carbonation. The final assessment? This actually reminds me a bit of a kolsch or even certain Czech pilseners in terms of the malt flavor profile and the presence of subtle fruit flavors that yield a rather cidery character. Still falls within style guidelines I suppose. I prefer the European examples I have tried."

"Okanagan Spring 1516: This brew pours with a clear golden color. Not much in the aroma department. The flavor is a very pleasant layer of malts and a clean finish. Overall, I rate this as a decent beer, refreshing. I discount that the tasting was done on a ski trip to Canada. A day of skiing great powder does make any beer taste good. Having factored in the positive environment, the Okanagan 1516 still does shine."

"Bottle. Mild aroma offers a lightly herbal hop note over creamed corn like sweetness. Clear golden body is topped by a low, white, fine bubbled head that recedes to ring. Flavour is simple and sweet with some cornlike DMS. Light body is somewhat gassy with a texture that is a bit on the watery side. A mild butterscotch note of diacetyl appears as it warms."

"This starts out as a very average lager in terms of appearance and smell. Has a nice thin feel of a lager and a good crisp taste. Where the beer sets its self apart from most lagers is the nice smooth finish with little after taste. Its a great beer for a hot day and the quality ingredients of Reinheitsgebot make for a smooth delicious lager."

"Overall - An easy drinking Bavarian Lager by Okanagan Spring. Clean, crisp, a very simple brew that doesn't try to over-complicate flavour. Could easily be a session brew."

"D - Excellent beer for a hot day. This a lager done the right way, with an actual hop presence to it. As a side note, not so great after it warms up. Really good overall though."
"I guess I liked this one more then the average BA, for style I thought it was pretty good, I consider this a macro at this point but its miles ahead of the other mass produced brews"
""
"O- I find this to be a nice drinkable beer....is there better out there....yes there is. With that said, this is another good brew that is suitable more for warm weather, although I think I'd quite enjoy this throughout an evening, due to the lite body this has. This isn't the best offering by Okanagan Spring, but I still think this is worthy of trying out, and is definitely better than an everyday macro."
""
"Overall, this is a better-than-average lager. It's Bavarian inspiration is apparent and pleasing."
"O: Sub-par lager, probably a bit worse than Canadian macros. This really pissed me off (not the beers fault): the menu stated “This beer adheres to the Bavarian Beer Purity Law of 1516, which states that no beer is to be made with preservatives or chemicals.” The lack of Preservatives is fine, but being a chemist I was a little angered at the notion that there were no chemicals in this beer, since, by definition, water and every other molecule in this beer are chemicals.... I know I’m just being prissy, but still."
"Final Grade: 3.45, a decent B-."
"D: Not much to say about this one. Better then a macro but nothing special. It gets the job done. Wouldn't say no if I was offered it."
"Overall, this is a refreshing beer, would be good for in the summer. Would recommend this."
"Pours very pale straw yellow, almost pilsner-like in its lightness. White head, not lasting nor lacing. Aromas are grassy without any major hop. Body of the beer is light and fairly crisp with light flavours of cooked vegetables and malt. At times I felt like I could have been drinking a Bud. That is not a compliment."
"All-in-all not a bad beer. Nothing to write home about, but considering Okanagan Springs was purchased by Sleeman's and isn't really a true craft brewery anymore, this is pretty decent."
"D- Although this isn't the most flavorful beer, I'd reach for this before any macro beer any day. It's a refreshing lager and it has it's place. Let's be honest, sometimes you just feel like pounding a couple of beers back and this one does the trick nicely."
"Drinkability - goes down fairly well. Not a bad beer for a variety of occasions."
"Smooth stands out. Bright. Distinct hop flavour to it. Medium carbonation. Nice, easy drinking lager beer. Crisp and clean. Aroma smells a little bit like wet rain smell on your clothes. Golden in colour. Very little aroma. It is held to the Bavarian Beer Purity Law of 1516, which states that no beer is to be made with preservatives or chemicals."
"On tap at Player's Athletic Lager Co. in London, ON- A deep golden pour topped with a frothy white cap. Nice lace and retention. Nose of creamed corn, butter, burnt sugar, yuck. Tastes of sweet churned butter, corn, vegetal hops. Buttery finish. Whet the hell is this?"
"On tap at C'est's What Spring Festival. Light yellow body with noticeble white foam, and lace. Lagerish mouthfeel. Skunkish, and in the taste. Sourness in finsish and sugary.Grassy hops, fairly weak helles.Surprisingly drinkable at all for what it is."
"I'm not a huge helles fan, but I can appreciate a decent thirst quencher, and I think this is one. I liked okanagan's baltic porter too, so it looks like they do some good things out there."
"D: A decent drinker."
"German Munich Helles don't really travel all that well. Part of this is specific to the style itself, but much of it has to do with the fact that most commercial examples that make it over here are so ridden with preservatives that they really taste like a ghost of their unpasteurized self. It's good to know now that some Canadian brewers have started to fill the gap."
"A fairly pleasant, if a little tame, example of the style. I do now recall tiring of its one-dimensionality when sessioning it all those years ago, post-university, but overall it's a decent enough go-to, when you just want a well-made lager of Canadian provenance."
"Pours a good golden color with a foamy head. Some lacing as well. A bit light in the nose, snappy hops and a little maltiness. Taste follows with light flavors (light bready malt and a little bit o hops), would have appreciated a bit more pronounced flavors but that's OK. The balance is pretty decent, keeps it pretty drinkable. Another easy drinker."
"Overall, this is an easy-drinking lager that's a step above macros."
"Thinking this beer might make a nice introductory Helles Lager for my friends who still reside in Macro-lagerland"
"Had this beer for the first time on a run up to Canada. Was served on-tap and was a very popular beer at the bar. The color was pretty good, a nice amber. The smell and taste were also nice, what a straight beer should taste like in my opinion. Overall, a very nice beer to have while hanging out with some friends at the bar."
"This is a beer you will find everywhere in vancouver; restaurants, bars etc. It scares no one and also challenges no one. The beer pours yellow gold with a nice head. The nose is pretty well non-existent. The taste is fairly crisp lager with a slightly sweet finish. It has one hand in the Old World but still tastes a bit like Molson Canadian. Not bad but order the pale ale instead if Ok Springs is the only choice."
"As far as lagers go, this is a good one. Easy drinking and the flavour has a freshness to it. A bunch of these in a cooler on a hot summer day, and you wouldn't hear me complaining."
"Light all malt beer. Seems styled on a light Dortmunder recipe...pours a light yellow, small white rocky head. Light malty nose over citrus-cidery notes. Light bodied malty lager with some nice cider and herbal hop tones, crisp finish...light malt after taste...a nice light all malt lager but really not all that distinct.Still it is light years ahead of the corn and rice swill from Mol-Coor-batt's"
"Standard 341 ml brown bottle, name obviously referring to the German Purity Law of 1516 (back label panel explains this. Pours clear golden hue, lots of carbonation. Malty smell, with grass or hay and light hops aroma that is kind of flowery. Nice maltiness and slight hoppy finish. Crisp lager taste, light and smooth, goes down easy. Well balanced, nothing special but my favorite session beer."
"1516 is a typical, but healthy and attractive looking pale lager. Light browns and golden straw, light honey colours. The head is definitely better than average, however. It poured with a perfect amount of head, neither overdone nor underdone. Off-white, thick, but fairly ephemeral, as it dissipates to a thin layer, the lace leaving thin serpentine patches. On a sweltering day, the appearance screams ""drink me."" The aroma is grainy, lightly toasted, with subtle tart milkiness like so many German lagers. Hops are well balanced, with some delicate spiciness and grass. Again, very German aroma, fittingly enough. The taste is brisk, refreshing, and thirst quenching. Good caramel malt up front, with a definite hop burst on the finish, leaving the mouth with a balanced, not overly sweet or dry feel. The freshness of the toasted malt is superb in this beer, roasted to perfection, a true credit to barley. Light butterscotch and even subtle lemon in the taste. The mouthfeel is high carbonation, light to medium bodied, and invigoratingly quenching. The drinkability, being neither offensive, strong, or heavy, is very good: an ideal summer brew; not to indicate, however, that this has little taste--on the contrary it is very flavourful. This is one beer I buy quite consistently; if I go out to buy a ""six-pack"" for a hot summer day, this usually is the standard. A credit to its name, 1516 is a natural refreshing German-style lager."
"Thx"
"Enough of the personal essay, let's get down to business. This 1516 poured out of it's 341 ml brown bottle a refreshing clear golden hue, but the erruption of bubbles I mistook for a head fell back immediately. Has a crisp hay/malt smell to it, light flowery hops rounding it off. Flavour is the light average of a crisp lager, a decent balance and it goes down smooth. However not much else going on to make it stand out either. This is a decent enough lager, I'd buy it again for another patio/barbecuing session, especially in mixed company (macro drinkers, non-beer drinkers, and beer snobs alike) but I'd reserve it for hot weather refreshment, by no means would I make it a standard of mine. Still, I'd buy this hands down over any macro on the market."
