This is a great summer brew, and a refreshing break from the intensely hopped ales I'm often pulled towards.  I don't have access to enough good helles or zwickels to be sure about how this holds up against the best in class, but this is miles better than the macro lagers.","Taybeh","Oct 07, 2014"

The nose comprises light grass, mild biscuit, light dried honey, mild flowers, and the faintest notion of hard water.  The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger contingent of both grass and flowers.  If I didn't know any better, I'd say this was an American take on a Czech pils, rather than a helles lager.  Whatever.  The body is fairly light, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel.  Overall, an enjoyable drink, no matter the style.","TMoney2591","Aug 23, 2014"

I tend to prefer lagers that are a bit more balanced, with an emphasis on the classic toffee malt/spicy and grassy hop profile, but I suppose this is a good change of pace for the brewery. This isn't a style that always leads to great things, and in this case, nothing is wrong with it. I'd love to have it fresh on tap someday, however, as I feel many of nuances that seem lost in this can would be far more present.","magictacosinus","Dec 18, 2013"

The smell of of the beer is a little on the yeast side with some subtle hops aromas and malt sweetness. The taste of the beer is malty with a strong hop bitter finish, some lighter notes of grain and bread in there. Not overly grassy which I was happy about.

Dense white head forms and retains well, considerable amount of lacing left behind. The nose starts with lemon and bread. The bready component features notes of wheat and yeast and gives a biscuit like quality to the aroma. Light herbal hops make a presence at the finish paired with mellow lager yeast. The taste starts with mellow malty sweetness, notes of lemon, grain, and corn. This is followed by huge bready dryness that off sets the mellow sweetness and provides a great balance. The finish features one last wave of lemon zest. Tons of delicate flavors here balanced terrifically. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing.

4,4.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Note: I don't have any qualms with beers being canned opposed to being bottled, but the design on the can is not alluring to me at all. TenFidy, an amazing beer from Oskar Blues, is canned, yet has a design that doesn't reek of FourLoko or another cheap energy drink/alcohol hybrid. Not that this has anything to do with the beer itself, it's just a note.","jm1229","Aug 25, 2011"
4,4.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Hell pours a slightly cloudy goldenrod color, lightening to straw in places when held directly to light. There's close to two fingers of white foam crowning the beer, and it shows moderate head retention and lacing. The nose is redolent of freshly baked white bread and crackers, with a hint of delicate spiciness from the Sterling hops. The flavor is a carbon copy of the nose, there's really not much too add. Everything comes across very crisp, and there's a nice balance between all the flavors. The body is firm for a sub 5% beer, and the carbonation has just a little bit of kick in it to keep things interesting. I really enjoyed my can of Hell, it's got a great combination of good flavor and being very easy drinking. I can see myself buying this in bulk to go along with Allagash White as my go to beers next summer.","axeman9182","Aug 20, 2011"

3.92,2.6,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Found on tap at Bailey's Taproom. Body is a bright golden color, rather still and without much head. Crisp, slightly sweet malt on the nose, with a decidedly bready character. Palate is crisp with a slight tang, I'm never sure how to describe it, but it's a telltale marker of the Helles style. Notes of light fruit, bready malt, and mildly fruity hops are present as well. Body is light and airy, although some more carbonation would not be a bad addition. A decent beer for the start of an evening in late summer, that's for sure.","ElGordo","Aug 04, 2011"
3.82,0,3,3.5,4,4,4,"D/O- Only real complaint is on appearance. Shot out of the gate like a lager thoroughbred- then fizzled and was lifeless.

Perfect for drinking while grilling, which, incidentally, is what I was doing.","dnrobert24","Jul 09, 2011"

A light sweetness and mild hop profile combine with a mild breadiness. The taste follows the nose, with a fresh and clean flavor making this astonishingly drinkable.

For being as light as it is, there's still a bready feel in the mouth that gives you something to look forward to each sip.

The aroma was quite light but nice consisting of malts, various grains, slight hop character, and some citrus notes peeking through. The flavor brought out the hops a tad bit more alongside the varoius grains, citrus accents, and a malt backing to balance out the zwickel. The brew was light in body with a good amount of tingly carbonation which had a grainy, citrusy, and slight hop bite finish. It drank very good and was very refreshing, I hope I can get my hands on more of these surly beers.","Gobzilla","Beers"
3.67,-3.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"It never ceases to amaze me at how full Surly fills their CANs. Following the Crack, the Glug has to take place rather quickly to avoid foam-over. I started with just better than a finger of foamy, bone-white head that quickly fell, leaving some lacing in its wake. Color was a slightly hazy golden-yellow. I was frankly disappointed as I hoping for opaque, filled with yeast-driven haze. Oh well. Nose was VERY bready up front with a a tang of Noble hops behind it. Mmmm. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a minty, grassy hoppiness on the tongue, initially, but giving 'way to a bready, biscuity maltiness. Finish was clean and crisp with a nice balancing act between to hops and malt. I was not blown away by the experience, but on the other hand, I have had so many p**s-poor lager-style beers out of a CAN that this was a welcome change.

Looks like any other lager, only slightly more hazy. Aroma is again very lager like, pale malts, breadiness, mild green fruit sweetness and very little hop presence. Flavor is slightly richer than your average lager with a slight yeast taste adding some snap to an otherwise unremarkable and light bready malt body. The finish is the most unique part, with the hops showing up at the last minute with some zesty lemon notes. Light bodied with full carbonation and a clean, dry finish.

The taste can only really be described as clean and crisp. A great summer time beer for anyone, including macro only drinkers. From Surly you expect a big hop bomb or something else extreme but this is just a straight up drinking beer.

The flavor starts out with a strong toast and cracker, but rich, yet mellow, herbal citrus hops. There are also hints of vanilla, cinnamon, cream soda, and lemon. I know this style is meant to be enjoyed cold, but this beer comes alive at cellar temperature.

Aroma is lightly fruity with a pale malt sweetness and only mild hops. Taste is great! Everything I expect out of light lager. Smooth, easy drinking, crisp, mild sweetness, just enough bitterness to back things up with no real hop flavor present, only light bitterness. Bready and grainy.

4.25,11.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours rich golden with low cloudiness and a nondescript white head that displays fair retention and spots of lace. Aroma is primarily earthy hops with lots of straw and an easy malt sweetness. Tastes of straw with earthy hops that provide a pleasantly moderate amount of bittering, malt sweetness takes a background for a crisp finish with only the kiss of the hops. Light to medium in body with a good moderate carbonation--not too fizzy but plenty of bubbles. Overall a very pleasant pale lager on par with America's best examples.","vacax","Jan 05, 2010"

There is a lot of sweet pilsner malt that is countered by a slight zest spiciness and an amazing crisp floral hop presence as well as a pleasant toasted biscuit malt character.

The only difference is a slight floral hop flavor but it's very minimal. Pretty hefty medium body for a lager, I like. Good carbonation with a creamy feel. Drinkable for sure, but it should be, it's a 5.1% lager. I had two cans of this prior to my review and at first I really loved this beer. Now sitting down and reviewing it, I find that that love has faded, kinda like Dan-O's stone washed jeans. Nothing too crazy about this one.

Big rocky head that had a dry-appearing surface. The beer smelled a little grainy and not too different from several popular lagers, maybe a little floral hops but mainly grain. Same with the taste, delicately sweet and malty, not exactly rich but just about right for a lager. This goes down like water, hard to imagine much better drinkability. Overall a well done lager, I'd have liked more haze or other evidence of the unfiltered production but tasty and made to the style in every other way.","TurdFurgison","Sep 22, 2009"

Smell is very doughy, like freshly baked bread and malt. Same thing comes through in the taste. Mainly bread, but some hint of fruit here and there. Feel is light, refreshing, and really drinkable. It is really cool to see Surly tackling a lighter style of beer like this, and putting their own spin on it. An excellent session beer that went well with pizza. Cheers","jamie2dope","0"

The beer is a darker-than-I thought-it-would-be yellow with orange hues. The can boasts ""fresh bread aroma"" and it's very apparent as the smell reminds me of driving past my hometown's bread factory. I also pick up what I believe to be lemon that is lurking in the backdrop. Interesting. Malts are very dominate after the first taste of this beer. What I find rather pleasant is that I detect some citrus flavors as well; the beer has a unique aftertaste that reminds me of a Saison.

The aroma very bready, slightly spicy, and has a nice faint metallic thing going on that reminds me of a lot of good beers I drank while living in Germany. For a golden lager this beer has a very robust aroma. The taste is as bready as the aroma with a hop presence that is noticeable, but certainly plays second fiddle to the malt. The nice metallic taste from the aroma is present in the taste too. Again, like the aroma, the taste is larger than one would expect from a golden lager. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a very nice beer. It is sessionable, flavorful, and has good complexity in more taste and aroma.
