This is good news as Weltenburger is not available at BevMo, Total Wine, of High Times. This is a very nice lager. The flavor is subdued yet complex. Absolutely chugable. My only issue with this beer is that I wish it were a bit more aggressive.","T100Mark","Jan 19, 2015"

The beer was very smooth and really easy to drink, the palate being a particular highlight but the taste and smell were not back either. Very refreshing and with some good fruits and citrus coming through as well, this one was a great beer and one well worth picking up.","flyingpig","Nov 23, 2014"

Anyway, this stuff pours a mostly clear lemon-straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises barley, mild flowers, and a strong twinge of lemon rind that shocks from the start through to the middle, not unlike a bolt of pain from the sciatic nerve when that uppity ganglion group gets grumpy. The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger sense of lemon, but one that is simultaneously milder, softer, less rind-y. A vein of lightly-buttered biscuit pervades in a constant undertow, providing a nice semi-counterpunch to the lightly-fruity aspects. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly creamy feel. Overall, an enjoyable helles, something I could see drinking regularly with ease.","TMoney2591","Apr 03, 2013"

Aroma was initially reminiscent of a Premium Lager but this gave way to malt and vanilla and later yeast and berries. Tasted toasted honey, orange, malt, hints of grain and wheat. Finish was sharp, wheaty and slightly bitter. Texture slightly thick, heavy carbonation resulted in a coarse edge. Overall this was more of an Export than a Helles as it had that slightly in your face character. Was impressed by the depth which was better than normal.","jonb5","Jan 27, 2013"

Surprisingly, there's a little sulfur up front, and the malt character is very rustic, with a raw, grainy bouquet. There's also a delicate hop character, light and with earthy aroma. Not the cleanest of lagers, there's a touch of yeast here, reminding me of a kellerbier. I'm initially disappointed, but this is really growing on me. And part of the reason for this the reason it tastes. Delicate and complex, this is a joy to drink. Light, earthy hop flavor with a little lemon as well, there's a firm bitterness that balances the malt flavors here. Rustic, a little bready and with a touch of cotton candy, this is top notch. Drying on the finish with a firm bitterness, a little earth and some bread. Excellent stuff, this.","DefenCorps","Sep 10, 2010"
