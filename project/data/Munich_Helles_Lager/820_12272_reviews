"330 ml bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy pale straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of clean pale malt, earthy hops, and light yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and clean finish that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Munich Helles lager. All around good balance and robustness of clean pale malt and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: I picked this up thinking it was Augustiner Hell...alas, no. Still, it's a decent lager - and an overpriced one, too. Simply for that, I won't buy again; unless of course I somehow mistake it for Augustiner Hell again."

"It has been a couple years but as I recall this beer reminds me of Amstel Light, maybe a little more alcohol than Amstel. Not bad but I'm glad I didn't love it because this ain't no cheap beer. I think I paid $13 for a six pack. I guess my quest for a great Light beer will go on."

"I really enjoy this beer. It has a nice color, and pours easy with a half inch of head. Nice color with moderate carbonation. I prefer it over the original Weihenstephaner, Hofbrau, or Spaten. Dry, crisp, malty,and biscuity taste. It goes down smooth with a pleasant finish with no after taste. Great session lager"

"Pours a sparkling, clear yellow with a thin head and no lace. The aroma is lemony with a hint of bread. The flavor is lemony with vanilla, dough, and honey notes. It's mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Augustiner Brau Munchen Light Export Beer is a decent beer, recommended."

"Very pale yellow color with a foamy white head that is somewhat retained. Aroma is macro lager, the old hay/straw aroma with a hint of bread, some german malt/hop is present. Flavor is sweet with some maltiness and a bit of lagering flavor as well. Not terrible, but far from great."

"i actually began and ended the night with this one. a nice little light beer to get me in the mood. pours out a light amber with nice head of white that managed to leave some good lacing down the glass throughout the session. smooth and easy on the palate in every way with light grassy notes, malty balance that is just sweet enough, a light and easy going feel and smooth, clean finish that has just a hint of dryness to it.."
"Remarkably drinkable, this is a soft and smooth lager that I can't imagine anyone passing up - even those who love the more bitter and hoppy German lagers from the north."
"Mouthfeel is very nice, not too full bodied. Extremely drinkable."
"D - Absolutely. This is a very good drinking beer."
"Good lager smell with small particles of yeast floating throughout the bottle. Very healthy level of carbonation with a clean and smooth mouth feel. Nothing extraordinary here but an overall great refreshing German lager. Best served ice cold on a hot day."
"Taste is pretty nice. Bready sweetness but light. Crisp tasting and pretty good per style. I would drink this one again."
"D- Nothing special. Easy drink, but a weak lager, and not what I expected from it. Mostly carbonation and lack of any strong flavors."
"D-This could be a great session beer (or maybe is before it makes its trip across the Atlantic), but there is a slight sweetness that makes this beer stick around on the palate too long."
"D: Not bad in the since that there's nothing particularly off about this one; at the same time, there's nothing memorable about it either. Interesting to try a more-authentic German take on the light lager category, but not something I'd pick up again."
"Pours a clear, dark brown color with a clear amber color along the bottom of the glass. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of pale malt, sweet malt, yeast, dark citrus, and slight raisin. Fits the style of a Light Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, sweet malt, pale malt, slight hops, slight roasted malt, and a dark citrus. Overall, a surprisingly good light lager with lots of body and a good blend."
"D - This is a very nice German light lager."
"M/D - very drinkable and good tasting, a very refreshing, clean & crisp brew that would be nice on a hot summer day"
"Drinkability: Of course, its a light beer but its got a hidden 5+ almost 6% alcohol so its easy to session but it can catch us quick. Ive been drinking this stuff since i got back from Oktoberfest but its nothing like the Augustiner you get in germany. Still, nice beer with amazing flavors."
"sure tastes light and refreshing for 5.7% abv. too bad there's that much alcohol. if this were 4 or so % would be a great summer guzzler."
"This beer is better than Das Boot."
"Thanks to Max for hand-carrying this beer from Germany."
"Just great overall."
"Big thanks to Max for hand carrying this back from Europe!"
"Price: 1.89 for a12oz bottle Liquor Barn Hurstborne"
"Well, a new favorite. Very enjoyable German Lager. Though most are average, this is a standout. Citrus and herbal aromas abound from an almost sparkling carbonation, and through a bleached white 1/2"" head. The hops make a better than usual presence--noble in quality. Tastes moderately malty and not as grainy as expected. No real vegitol flavors detected at all. Instead, a lemony, grapefruity, orange peel like flavor abounds. Condensed with solid hop bittering makes for a very clean, crisp and smooth beer. The body is moderate to light, not to weigh too heavily on the mouth. This is a very good beer for the style."
"Give me a cold case of this an a warm summer day and I'm in heaven."
"Had a bottle of this this past weekend at the Sunset. No freshness date, so maybe I was taking a chance, but luckily the brown bottle was there to help. I have to say, this beer tasted mighty fresh. Clear light gold with a thin white head. Original impression of some sweet corn like notes in the aroma (not off-putting) later evolved into some more grape-skin like complexity, is that Munich Malt. Cool. Beer was light and darn easy to drink, a real session brew. Some sweetness, not over the top thank god, with some pleasant toast points in the finish."
"This brew has a light body which won't win you over in the mouthfeel department. Not much to say about flavor except that each drink ends with an astringent twang. Very steel like. Save your money for a beer that actually has some flavor."
"This is a beer I would go to if were going to have a few, but not a bunch, and was in the mood for a nice, quaffable lager. I could see it being a great pair with spicy Vietnamese or Thai food."
"The small, fizzy, white, bubbly head dies fast, leaving nothing but a glass full of dirty gold liquid. Just a little hazy. There is some tangy fruit in the nose, with some nice schpoonk. A little corn syrup. Fruity in the front. Roasty crackers. It gets quite malty in the middle, finishing crisply bitter with some corn. It's a tasty, light lager. Enough malt and some nice grainsiness."
"The aroma is a bit lemony, some pale malts, overall pretty light. Bright white head poured nice and thick, faded to a film eventually leaving a tiny bit of lace. Not much in the flavor department, maybe a little wheat with a splash of lemon. Very light body, clean finish. This would be very refreshing served nice and cold on a summer day, but otherwise just pick up a Busch and rub a lemon around the edge of the can."
