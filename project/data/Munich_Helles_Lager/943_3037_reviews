"O: Not a very good Helles lager -- off-flavors galore. I was able to choke it down but it was a bit of a struggle."

"It's a simple lager that shows visitors of the brewery that there's more to beer than just the banal taste that's marked on nascars or by talking frogs."

"O: This is one of the most uninspiring Helles I've tried in a long time."

"Light gold in appearance, very clear. The Smell lacks in any detectable aromas. The mouthfeel is crisp on the way in and then it is done. Taste is very uneventful and lacks any true charateristic, disappointing. Overall we have found this lacking in any real beer flavor."

"A golden brew with slight appearance of a head reduced to a thin cap in a flash. Smell brings a gentle hoppy presence - spicy hops. Good, not distinctive. Mild malt sweetness, almost perfectly balanced with mild hop bitterness. Gentle, mild, slight... These words above are the description of the overall. And the mouthfeel? Guess! Light. High drinkability due to the balanced ease with which the Velas Hellespont presents itself. Good."
"Prost!"
"Almost inch thick creamy like head. Tastes very similar to the German style beers that it is modeled after. Great lacing, looked like spider webs down the sides of the glass. Appearance was golden yellow. Didn't bother to smell it. Mouthfeel is how I believe a beer should be. Very drinkable, let's just say I had more than one. The bartender gave me a shot of Cherokee Red after I told him how bad it was when I tryed it, still tasted like shit."
"Overall, this is one hell of a balanced, clean, grainy, hop-appropriated Helles. Some stickiness to the very end; but like the Pils (which I recall has a lot in common with this) it is a pleasant aftertaste. Should it cleanse the palate totally? I don't know because I have never been to a Deuschland Biergarten drinking the Bavarian greats, but I like the un-American-light-lager-residual. This would go nicely in one of my Corny kegs!"
"Drinkability: Velas is a tidy, tasty, refreshing Helles that's quite drinkable."
"Drinks solidly as it is intended to."
"And that's why I'm a Lager Guy. Not because I have no palette and can't appreciate anything except fizzy, yellow beer. I enjoy my share of hops and sours and fruit and funk, but when you get right down to it, food is a nostalgic experience as opposed to a collector's or academic one. Eat what you like. Drink what you like. Lager-ists (lageristas?) appreciate the subtle nuance of form. We don't need big bold bombs going off in our mouths or extreme heat ABV to get us into bed. Bring us the graded shades of taste, and we'll supply the rest."
"The tartness in this beer is quite light, but it is distinct, this would certainly point to an infection of some sort (the over-carbonation could be a sign of this as well), and it certainly does take this beer out of style. As the beer warms up the honey notes in the nose start to take on a bit more fruitiness. Not bad, but certainly not what I was expecting or hoping for; in many ways it reminds me of a Berliner Weiss, it is not quite there though as the sourness would need to be a bit more gripping. Actually if this was labled as a Berliner Weiss I would have enjoyed it quite a bit more as it does have a nice, clean tartness to it."
"12oz bottle into a Lucifer tulip pours a crisp pale gold with a thin diminishing off-white head. Aroma is just a trace of sweet malts. The taste is a slight amount of sweet malts and and just a hint of hops. The beer is light and crisp, but a bit on the watery side. This is one textbook mediocrity."
"Before I buy another I'll have to taste it first. Here's to hoping something just 'went wrong'."
"Medium body & effervescence. A solid helles but not a standout."
"Overall not a bad little lager, though the subtleties were severely lacking it was still fairly decent. I would see no issue with throwing this down on a hot day, though I am sure there are much better lagers out there for sure. I am not really sure what to take away from this one as it is a hard style to really having any different in but I still feel even given that this is barely above average in any regard."
"D- I would say its about like a typical mainstream domestic lager beer, but slightly better than most. Its not my favorite style, I was impressed with the porter that Smoky Mountain Brewery made and took a bottle of this home as well just to try. I think its a good beer for those that don't stray far from the Miller Lite and Coors kind of beers."
"The taste was smooth and sweet. It almost tastes like a white grape juice, in my opinion. For a lighter beer I would say it was quite flavorful. I would take this over any main stream light beer any day."
"Overall it's a good beer and certainly better than any macro you could get a hold of but nothing special"
"Drinkability: A good summer-time beer. Although, the carbonation detracts from this beer."
"Drinkability is high as the beer feels light but is very flavorful."
"Had this on tap at the brewery in Pigeon Forge. The bartender told me this was comparable to Corona although I thought it had more flavor and was a bit fuller in body than a corona. Has a light golden color with a small white foamy head that was gone rather quickly. Has a faint aroma with a bit of citrus at the end. The taste was very light and sweet with a bit of malt and hops but nothing overpowering. This could definately be a session beer or one to drink on a hot day of doing yard work. But still it is just an average brew compared to the brewery's other offerings, but still a nice fizzy refreshment at the right time or to give to someone that might be scared off by a heartier brew."
"This is a beer that I feel the brewmaster intends to mimic a Corona for the macro crowd. It is much better than a Corona, but I do see tourists drink this with a lime, which is not required. It has a standard straw yellow look with low carbonation and thin head. A very mild aroma that hints at a very mild sweet grain nose. Taste has a smooth grain accent with the lightest touch of hops on finishing. Mouthfeel is thin and somewhat watery. Drinkability is big as it seems to quaff better with each successive pint. Not my first nor second choice from this brewpub, but a pretty nice option in warmer months. This beer has been watered down to appease the masses as it had much more character and taste when it was first brewed (Gold medal Helles at the GABF in '99)."
"This beer is very light in color. There is a small head. The smell is very slightly of hops. The taste is pretty bland with few flavors showing up. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth and a little bit oily. The drinkability is good. I could session this beer no problem. Not a bad beer, just plain."
"So far this is the worst that I have tried from Smokey Mountain Brewery. It could be a lawn mower beer. But, if that's what you want why not go to the local grocery and get the cheapest Macro in cans."
"F this brew! I hate it!!!"
"This one was fairly enjoyable, though not great, overall. Fix the appearance and smell a bit first (i.e. make them bolder) and they may be on to something here."
"Drinkability - while well crafted, the flavor is too lemony for my liking. Still, it disappeared awfully fast."
"Pours a very pale yellow with small white head that falls way to quick. Aroma is light some malt some grassy hops not much going on here. Taste is a little more maltier then their pilsner maybe a touch more hops also but overall just as soon have the Thunder Road not much diffrence between the two. Mouthfeel is light and drinkability is ok goes down quick and is refreshing. This brewery is making their stuff to appeal to Bud drinkers. None of their beers are very taste intensive made not to offend anyone I guess."
"Perhaps the least personality of the beers I've had from this brewery. Very mild, with some malt caramel flavors. Hopping was modest, but the overall flavor profile was fresh and clean. Nothing wrong with this beer, it just really does not distinguish itself in any way."
"Thanks to johnrobe for sending me this. The guy with the funny hat on the label is worth the price of admission. Billed as a ""light German style lager"" which doesn't really tell you much. Pours a gold color with a medium off-white head and mild effervescence. No lacing. Very light and sweet aroma of honey and even a little bubblegum. Very light-bodied with an unimposing hops flavor, with some malt and citrus as well. Finish is lightly sweet. Complexity is not a factor but this stuff is insanely easy to drink."
"The visage of Smoky Mtn.'s brewmaster, Marty Velas, appears on the label appropriately in traditional German garb. I guess if you're gonna put your name and face on the label, you're gonna make sure it's one tasty brew."
