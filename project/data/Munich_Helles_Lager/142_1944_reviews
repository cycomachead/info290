"F: A little thinner than I like, but still very good."
"Really good on tap, a little skunk in the bottle."
"One of the best chill out beers ever!"
""
""
""
""
"Bottle of spaten lager drank."
""
""
""
"The best Munich helles lager easily, and cheaply, found in these parts."
""
""
"Great summer easy drinking beer, not too sweet.Not too filling."
"I am sure on draft unpasteurized it would be even better."
"Enjoy"
""
"Really bright, clear, somewhat goldenish color. Smell is the weak point for this because it had a very small hint of skunkiness (green bottle). Tastes very refreshing, and is incredibly smooth and easy to drink. I could seriously drink this stuff like water."
"Not usually a seeker of German pale lagers, but when I have to drink one, it might as well be spaten, it's so light and clean, one could literally consume a dozen of these in an afternoon with little consequence. Blonde and bright, nice and fizzy, refreshing, and really clean in the finish. Enjoying the hops on it, more than others, and the yeast is an absolute classic, often found skunked out in the market because of the green glass, but when fresh, this really is an excellent lager, distinct from the others in its class I think, and pleasantly flavorful for what it is. Often the best beer available at non craft spots."

""
"O: a little light struck, but still a really nice beer;"
""
"Quite a nice lager without really doing much to stand out from the crowd, being from Germany is almost enough to elevate it above most lagers you're likely to try in the UK but it is by no means a classic. It had enough going for it to keep you interested and the crisp finish was particularly pleasing but it's not a beer I'd go out of my way to track down again."
"Smells like grass. Tastes like lemongrass. Fresh and crisp but couldn't get past the strange hop flavor integrated into the brew."
""
"Cheers!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Everything a lager should be."
"This beer feels light, but with great carbonation felt in your mouth, which leaves a really nice finish."

"O:  far from terrible, far from great ... it's not a beer I'll buy again because we import so much better from the region, but it's also a serviceable helles with an interesting hop mix of grass in the nose and black pepper on the tongue"

"Mmmmm. Lager. Now, if you want a good lager, this is it! Crisp, clean, and lovely. But, don't expect it to be an IPA."
""
""
""
"Smooth yet slightly bitter beer without too much bite. It's a good beginner beer to explore what Germany has to offer."
""
"Review according to BJCP2008 guidelines (style 1D). Bottle 50 cl - Batch 17.02.2104. AROMA: sweet malt aroma with a slight background DMS. low hop aroma. APPEARANCE: yellow clear with a thin white head with average retention. TASTE: sweet taste that lingers into the finish. low bitterness and low hop flavour. no esters. PALATE: médium-light body, medium-low carbonation. OVERALL: an average bulk munich helles and the original style created at Spaten brewery."

"500ml bottle. Pokal glass. Pale golden color, clear appearance. White froth, close but discrete crown leaves a thin lasting layer on top & some lacing on sides. Yeast, slight sulfur, floral, citric hints & biscuit touch to the nose. Malty upfront, light sweet & grainy flavor. High to medium body. Moderate to high carbonation. Oily to watery texture. Clean lemon zest-like bitterness & dried mouthfeel but maltiness –shown as a biscuit flavor- arises & balances a long gentle bitter finish. Lemon juice memories on the aftertaste."

"This beer is light, clean and refreshing all around. It has a strong carbonation that isn't allowed to get out of control even with a crispness that never stops biting; as such, it's fluffy in the mouth while biting. It has just a little dryness to balance the feel. It starts off grainy but ends clean."
"Pours a deep clear gold with a fizzy white head. The head doesn't last long but does leave a small amount of lacing. The aroma is mild, with light notes of cut grass and grain. The taste is similar with the addition of light hops earthiness. The mouthfeel is toward the lighter side with a nice bite from the hops on the finish. A very good lager."

"A very drinkable, enjoyable beer. Smells inviting, tastes fresh and has a number of different taste themes all working together. Finishes clean with no unpleasant aftertaste. It just seems right to me and I would be hard pressed to order something else if this was available."
""
""
""
"Sometimes you just want a beer and you'd be hard pressed to find a better example of great lager than this. Smooth and creamy with just the right amount of crisp hops to finish it off. It's a shame that no big name American beer even resembles something this good."
""
"O - I think it's unfortunate that the irrational craze for ales (especially over-the-top IPAs) over the last few years has left the traditional lager woefully underappreciated. And yet the truth is that a good lager is mighty difficult to brew, much more so than an ale. Well, this is damn good lager: Refreshing and crisp yet simultaneously hearty. Great stuff - you see how the Germans drink this stuff by the liter at their beer halls."

"This was very reminiscent of Heineken but skunkier. It's probably due to the duration of shipping. It's wasn't particularly great but I'll drink it if it's available. I wasn't too impressed though. I would like to try their other beers for sure."

"Edit** January 31, 2015. I've had this beer on a number of occasions since my last formal review, since it's one of my everyday great drinking beers. You want to sit down with a beer and not think about it but just enjoy it, this might beer the beer for you. Anyway, I' haven't noticed any sort of metallicness in probably the last ten times I've had this so, this score deserves a half point bump in the aroma department."
""
""
"Light golden color with a smallish white head that dissipates quickly. Rich bready pilsner malt with a hint of carmelization and some light fruity notes. DMS was quite evident upon first pour but seems to have mostly dissipated. Light floral hop aroma. The flavor is rich toasty sweet bready caramel maltiness with a hint of light sweet fruit. Light earthy spicy hop flavor with a light level of hop bitterness. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet rich malty mouthfeel. Nice flavorful malt forward beer. The DMS was a bit heavy at first, I'm glad that went away. I could drink many of these given half a chance."

"Overall This is of the highest quality lager in the world. I would put this up in there with the best of them. For this style is world class beer!!"

"The Verdict: Pretty good beer. Nothing fancy or complex, just a good solid German lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall just a good, enjoyable beer. Nothing world class but it's just solid and a brew I think almost any kind of palate would enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Middle of the road helles, nothing too remarkable here, but overall a decent helles. Appearance is lacking some color (pale golden ) and head (very spare). Aroma is malt, taste is mostly malt, hops barely make an appearance here. Much better to be found in germany."
""
""
""
""
"O - Again, one of my favorite beers overall. I realize that lager's get a bit of an unfair bummed rap around here, but you have to remember, there are plenty of excellent lagers out there. The fact that most crap American beers are lagers plays into this negative stereotype, which I think is wrong. This beer has a perfect amount of taste and refreshment. The ultimate (and my favorite) session beer, and one of my Top 5 overall. Highly recommended for any Lager fans, or anyone who likes to session with quality, tasty beer."
""
""
""
"The texture is silky smooth, with some prickly carbonation. Medium-bodied."
""
"This is a refreshing brew. Its smell stands out the most, just like a Lemon Drop. It tastes like a pilsner, but it has a hint of lemon. This is certainly not exciting, but it's definitely drinkable. I might get this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Certainly not the most exciting lager, but this seems like a good standard for an authentic helles. It's refreshing, drinkable, and not offensive - good cookout beer I imagine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a good beer and I would love to try it on draft. I won't buy it in bottles again. For the life of me, I can't understand that if the Germans were such purists, why they kept the usage of green bottles? The skunk detracts from the beer there is no question, but not terribly so. I'm going to give this beer high 3's out of 5."
""
"O: Green bottles mean I wouldn't buy this one again. However, I would seek it out on tap. An under-appreciated lager unfortunately scorned both by its bottle color and by who makes it."
"Brewed in Munich, this is another delicious Germany beer. Simple but delicious. I had this beer a lot when I was in Germany and thought it was delicious. Color is not the darkest I've seen in a beer, but was also not the lightest. Clean, full-bodied flavor."
"Very Very tasty brew. This beer to me exemplifies a German premium lager."
""
""
""
"It's an excellent beer. Rich, tasty, highly drinkable."
""
"Poured on tap in a shaker at The Pantry (minus the green food coloring offered due to St. Patty's). Crisp golden color like a mildly tarnished golden wedding band with a cap of thick white head that kept pretty good retention and a touch of lacing. Smelled a lot of biscuit mix, freshly kneaded in the kitchen from several feet away as well as a touch of some citrus. The citrus came out more pronounced in the taste and mouthfeel, almost like a bit of lime zest and/or rind along the back of a bready malt. The mouthfeel was pretty light and just a very small touch of carbonation and spritz. Pretty good for a lager overall."

"O: Here we see a high quality beer that encompasses everything I look for in a lager. It hits all the high notes you expect out of a quality lager--the very qualities that are absent from mainstream lagers popular in America today. I will stock up on these around the summer months, as something this refreshing can't be passed up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, this makes a good beer to drink when you just want to drink a few beers and not think about it."

"Overall: very good quality lager, I thought it must have been a light ale or a pilsener. AU$80 a case for 2 x 500mL - not bad value at all for such a good quality lager."
"Overall: Spaten Premium Lager is a decent beer to try. It's not my favorite style, but I could see myself getting an itch that this style could scratch on occasion. I don't think I would buy it the majority of the time, however. It's a good lighter choice for when you don't want to sacrifice taste like some other *cough*Americanmacrolagers*cough* light choices."

"i pretty much love all of Spaten's recipes. this pours nicely, laces in little spots and smells very pilsnerly. lager? smells hoppy, tastes very dr; finishes clean with a crisp taste. nice session beer, dry, a little bitter, very germany . . . . wish they would bring back the Club-Weisse...."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Pretty good stuff. Very clean, and nothing off-putting at all."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is very well balanced between the malt and hops and is also quite easy to drink."
"O - Munich Helles Lagers done right are some of my favorite lagers for summer. That being said, this Helles is done to near perfection. Pick up a six pack for yourself and enjoy a summer afternoon (or two or three)."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a Lager glass. Pours a dark yellow in color with a three finger head. Quite nice I guess though nothing special. Pretty much smells of any other lager, Including Adjuncts with some strong skunkiness coming through. Taste is realistically no better than a PBR, Except with some very slight fruitiness. The mouthfeel is pretty much the same as the taste. With no additional flavors coming through, However it is not harsh at all. Overall, It's a pretty average beer. Nothing worth buying in my opinion, I got the bottle for free so I cannot complain"
""
""
""
""

"Overall I thought this was an ok beer and a slightly above average example of a Munich Helles Lager, it had just about everything that I look for in the style, but the skunkyness prevented it from being as good as it could be. This beer had pretty good drinkability, it was smooth but the flavors couldn't quite hold my attention, but I could still drink two or three of these if in the mood. What I liked most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was true to style and just where it should be, no complaints there. What I liked least about this beer was the fact that it was a little skunky, I think that's from the green bottle, these older brewery's that still use green bottles need to get with the times. I might have this beer again if I was looking for a sessionable lager, but I would be more inclined to revisit this again on draft, it's got to go great with brats. This beer made for an Ok first impression for Spaten, and I would be interested to try more of their beers, but you can be sure that I will be a little leery if they are in the same green bottle, good brew, it just needs better packaging."

"Thin head on a clear straw body. A little lemon custard with pale malts but overall very light. Flavor is a touch bitter with more pale malts and grains but very simple. No off putting aftertaste. Light body and moderate to high carbonation. Overall drinkable but simple. Not bad not great."
""
""
""
"Got a case on clearance for $20 and was psyched to try this highly esteemed lager. Maybe it's the fact that I've been accustomed to Americanized lagers but I was astounded by the syrupy quality this beer has in aftertaste. It poured a golden color with a generous foamy head into my pilsner glass. In look and in taste it reminded me if yuengling premium, which im not above drinking but it is what it is. Decent beer but it didn't give me an exceptional vibe."
"Taste is definitely malty sweet but crisp and light. A perfect thirst quencher for hot summer days, and aside from the aroma, a solid lager."
""
""
""
"This is a decent, quaffable, smooth, decently flavored beer. It does have the typical characteristics of a euro lager, but the hop character and grain bill do a good job of overcoming it. It's worth a try."
"Overall, not a great beer, but for a mini-keg on a huge occasion, it works, especially at a nice price. But really, disappointing."
""
"Apparently a classic. Their Optimator doppelbock still floors me to this day, but this manages to hold on its own as an excellent product. Totally worth buying six packs to pair with pretty much any meal."
"Pours a clear light orange with a 1 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin broken rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, grape juice, and some slightly skunky aromas that disappear after the pour. Taste is of sweet malt/grain and some grape juice and fruity flavors. There is a slight hop bitterness that quickly fades after each sip. There is a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good and easy to drink lager that is pretty refreshing."
""
"In general, a good light German lager with a very clean taste,"
"O: A nice thirst quencher on a hot day, or as an accompaniment to a warm meal. A good example of a lager."
"Spaten premium pours nicely with a thick foamy head and in a ""bar clean"" class had good retention and lovely lacing. It is best served chilled at cellar temps, not ice cold. The nose is subtle but does have nice malt presence and subtle sourdough bread notes. The perfect golden-yellow is what you would expect from a Munich Helles and is nicely effervescent but not overly carbonated. For me it is moderately sweet on the front of the sip and leaves no off flavor aftertaste but finishes clean an d a bit wet. Overall an excellent example of an everyday German lager for everyday lager drinkers and a great value. Buy a 5 liter mini keg and enjoy while grilling some brats!"
""
"O: Not too bad, def lives up to the hype that i recall of good German beer from my college days."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: haven't had this in years, but pretty much as expected. Works best with food."
"overall, this brew is not very complicated. It's straight forward and easy to appreciate. Perfect all year round.,"
""
"D - a very nice german lager, the aroma is virtually perfect and the flavor profile is spot on as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a glass mug. Pours pale golden with a two-finger length white head. Plenty of lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is of lightly toasted barley malt and hops. There's a mild citrus aroma. There are flavor is sweet, bready, with notes of citrus and some hop bitterness. It's a very well balanced flavor and it's delicious. The mouthfeel is light. It's crisp with adequate carbonation. The finish is dry. It's very refreshing. This is an excellent lager and deserves top ratings for this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This beer pours a clear pale yellow with no head or lacing. It's aroma is lemony with a hint of dough. The flavor is mild lemon with a bit of malt sweetness and a hint of hoppiness. Very well balanced. It's mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Spaten Munchner Hell (Premium Lager) is a good beer, a perfect match for schnitzel and sauerkraut. Recommended!"
""
""
""
""
"Normally, I never go right down the middle on my reviews, but this is an exception. Its not that this beer is not good, it is that it is not really remarkable either. It pours a very average light see-through typical color of what you would expect from a lager. It has the carbonation, lace and head of a lager, and the aroma of barley and hops you'd expect from a better lager. The beer to me resembles a malt liquor in terms of the bitterness and dryness and it is evident on the tongue for a strong mouthfeel. Not a bad brew, not a great brew. I would drink Spaten if it was the only other option other than a cheap American adjunct lager."
""
""
""
""
""
"A good lager that was a pleasant surprise. Not a lager fan but this style seems to appeal to me. Would definitely grab it again or sip a few next octoberfest."
""
"Notes: Nice beer and a good example for the style. Goes down easy and is refreshing. Decent level of hops to contrast with the maltiness resulting in a well balanced, refreshing beer."
""
"overall: Very drinkable, light body beer that lingers slightly. Great beer for a hot afternoon"
""
"A good session beer and a definite step up from the usual lager."
""
""
"Really liked the clean,amber color,good bubbles,just sad head. The smell had a hint of skunk,however,still a sweet malty odor soon overwhelms the skunk,as does the taste. Very smooth ,very clean taste. There is more grain taste that hops,to me a great balance. Refreshing anytime."
"This beer is a great German Lager. For anyone who loves to drink classic american pilsner such as Budweiser will love this German creation. This beer is extremely smooth, the taste is neither bitter or sweet but perfectly balanced. The color of the beer is light golden, and has a malty aroma with a hint of lemon."
"Very transparent light straw color with an eggshell white foam head that lasts for quite some time but leaves minimal lacing. Aroma at first whiff reminds of apricots and tangerines, but resolves into a cracker malt with strong and complex herbal / floral hopping. Taste is somewhat pushed into sweetness but not unbearably so, finish is semi-sweet but lasts for a respectable amount of time, texture is lighter side of medium body, refreshing, and definitely worth sessioning!"
""
"This beer is a relatively average lager. It is and enjoyable and easy beer to drink. The color is a light golden. It comes in a green bottle with a neat label. The smell is wheaty or grassy. It has a very clean finish. The taste is very balanced...neither too sweet nor too bitter. There is a slight caramel flavor as well. This beer is similar to a heineken."
"Extra: Didn't particularly care for this beer. It was your average run of the mill beer. The taste was identical to that of Coors or Heineken."
"This beer was lighter yellow in color. To me it was just like a typically, standard beer. What you think of when you hear the word beer. It has an herbal, almost grassy taste and was pretty smooth. Not my favorite, but what I did like about this beer was that it has a super clean finish and did not leave a horrible after taste!"
"This beer comes in a neat green bottles with a cool unique logo. It has golden color light brown. This beer has just about no head. Another neat thing is the carbonation of this beer, it reminds me of champagne. Thus beer smells like clean cut grass. It has a sweet malt taste and a clean after taste. This beer goes down smooth and is a Classic German Lager."
"O: I've had the Optimator and the Marzen Oktoberfest, and I was a little disappointed at first, but then remembered it's a light lager, and should be judged as so... that being said, it's pretty good, and it's probably not nearly as fresh as the domestics, being in the middle of America."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad drink but probably needs to be icy cold and really fresh so you get a nice froth. Seems to be all about the perfume of the hops. Modestly bitter aftertaste. In the right mood this could be fine, but it is a little unusual."
""
"O: A fine beer that I will often revisit. Pairs excellently with German cuisine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Watchin' Jeopardy! and drinkin' German brews. Good times. This one pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of relatively short-lived white foam. The nose comprises grass, flowers, light wheat, and a very light twist of lemon. The taste takes a simpler tack, rocking just wheat and flowers, almost pilsner-like. The body is pretty light, with a very light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a decent helles lager, but lacking any kind of real character, any kind of discerning remarks, so to speak. It's nowhere near bad, just not something I would aim for, especially with other quality German choices around."

"This beer had great promise. I was told by the owner of the shop I bought it from that it's one of the best lagers on the market. But as soon as I smelled it i knew he was wrong. Maybe it was skunked, cause this thing smelled foul. Good color, loads of bubbles, look was great. Mouthfeel light. Taste was ok. Slightly more complex than a bud. Not buying this again, not asking that dude what he reccomends again."

"Overall - A nice light German easy drinker."
"A very clean and easy drinking beer. Exactly what one would expect of the style."
"Easy to drink and I could see myself drinking this sort of brew on a hot summers day in a Munich bier garden."
"O: It's not as good as the Spaten Dunkel, Oktoberfest, or Optimator, but a very nice pale lager. Definitely a step up from the cheaper European lagers like Beck's or Heineken. But, unless you're crazy about pale lagers, I'd recommend one of Spaten's darker beers instead, especially now in OCtober."
"Overall Drinkability - It's not a bad beer. Perhaps slightly better than average for the style."
"Overall: This is great stuff. I wish American lagers had this much flavor. Das bier ist gut."
"500 ml. botte. Clear yellow colour, big head that does'nt hold much, but leaves a ring on the surface. Smell of lemon, grain, slightly fruity. Fresh and crispy palate, taste is herbal, lemon. Not a omplex beer, but very drinkable and enjoyable. Good one."
"Final Grade: 3.79, a respectable B+."
"Lighter medium body, higher carbonation, bubbly and somewhat refreshing. Drinks okay, but not exactly thrilling in any specific department."
"average taste with a good feel to the mouth, clears nicely. Better that most american lagers, with exceptions of course. Overall not bad, but again falls short of american micro brews. Stay with the home team."
"Clear pale golden colour, one finger white dense head, not much lace but decent retention. Smell is malty and floral, grass, grainy with lemony citrus and a grainy presence. Taste is malty with lots of fruit going on, lemon, floral, citrus with a mild bitterness. Nice mouthfeel, medium crisp carbonation, medium body, good feel. Pretty good stuff, solid and more complex than competing brands at the LCBO, fairly easy drinking stuff here."
"D: An excellent Helles: it's to-style with a distinct taste and tremendous sessionability. Well worth trying."
"Very refreshing and enjoyable, but nothing I would really buy again."
"Prost!"
"D - Solidly drinkable brew. A good light but non-wimpy brew."
"Overall Impression- Not my favorite of the Helles Lagers, but still brings me back to Austrian/German festival days. Easy drinking, light, clean, and bottoms up! Prost!"
"O - A nice snappy lager. Easy to knock back a few and a great alternative if your looking to mix it up"
"O: Good, not outstanding. This is one you could drink all day at a barbeque or cookout, and goes quite well with my sister's fried chicken (she cooks it like my mom, may she rest in peace). Prost!"
"This is a classic-tasting and very well-balanced lager. What you see is what you get with this one: The lack of surprises or significant complexity in this one is compensated by smoothness and solid flavors throughout. It may not raise many eyebrows, but it really does everything that a good lager should."
"Overall – It's definitely better than most of the run of the mill euro-beers out there. But there are a few other beers in this category that I'd rather be drinking."
"O: The Germans know how to make good lagers, and this is an example as good as any. I can't complain about anything. Maybe it misses that extra thing to make it special, but I'll bet I could drink this on most occasions. As most German lagers it doesn't cost much either."
"The feel of this beer is pretty crisp and has the signature of a German pilsner. There is a bready aftertaste with some smooth feel as this goes down. A well made larger that would got well with some pulled pork."
"O: This beer is average at best it feels like every other green bottled euro beer to me and does nothing to set itself apart from the middle of the road."
"The CPJ"
"RJT"
"Overall I like this a bit better than the Hacker-Pschorr I just had. Much more cleaner and crisp with a nice hop flavor."
"Overall, a pretty boring German lager. Not much character to it, flavors are subdued to the point of being almost unnoticeable. Compared to the Paulaner pils I reviewed yesterday, this is a German Budweiser."
"This is yet another Euro Beer that proves that most American Beers are generations away from the fine quality enjoyable beers made in Germany, Belgium and England."
"I use this often as a celebration beer as an alternative to Pacifico, my regular daily beer. This beer was a pleasant surprise and is definitely a beer I would drink again."
"O: Pretty solid beer. Not the best in the world but you could derfinately do worse for a helles."
"O: good lager, I would buy it again for lawn mowing purposes."
"O: I think this beer is done very well though I'll probably re-consider the overall rating once I've tried more from this style."
"Overall: I thought I wouldn't feel so strongly about a relatively standard (plain?) style of beer, but this is perfect right now. I have been craving something to balance out the range of over-malty to uber-hoppy beers I have been drinking for the last six months. It also satisfies a nice balance between hoppy Czech (my usual favorite) and dry German pilsners. Spaten hits the spot!"
"O - Solid example of this style. Can be consumed in copious amounts without any problems. Have experienced this on tap on many occasions but the bottled product is just as good."
"Very light aftertaste, good bitterness, this is a great beer to have with food when you don't want a big beer to drown out the food flavor you are pairing it with. A decent palate cleanser as well, without being water or watered down."
"cheers"
"I was a huge fan of Spaten Hell when i started drinking good beer some 3/4 years ago. In tasting it again after quite a long time i was expecting a bit of a letdown. I'm instead very glad, this is one the best Hells out there"
"O- Pleasant beer that goes well alone or as an accompaniment to medium to high boldness foods. The lack of complexity does not make the beer any less pleasant."
"Very enjoyable. Crisp, smooth and a good amount of flavor for such a simple beer. I'll make sure to get some more of these on some hot summer days."
"Another German pilsner... So much of these out there. The beer is a hellish gold color with fluffy white head on it. The brew is light bodied and has flavors of some hops, malts and fresh cut grass. The grassy flavors aren't too strong in the this which is nice. I can drink this beer if I have too, I wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
"A tasty Oktoberfest-style lager, refreshing an easy to quaff in large quantities. Nothing exciting about the brew, but you can tell that this brew is crafted well for summer/festival consumption."
"Overall not a very flavorful beer. Tastes are lacking But the criteria for the style is good. For me its not very good, I like more complexity in my beers"
"The liquid is a pale golden, yellow with a soapy white head . Smells of hay and skunk with hints of lemon. When you take a sip there is a slightly bitter lemony hop bite with other grassy hop notes and a base of bready malt. It is light with lots of prickly carbonation and it has a dry finish. This is a good German lager, it's solid all the way around."
"Very, very drinkable. You could really enjoy a few pints of this with no problems whatsoever. Okay, I could."
"D: Shoooot. This is of the highest quality. I would put this up in there with the best of them. If this were a pils I'd say it wasn't hoppy enough but it's not. For this style an excellent beer!!"
"Smooth and easy drinking , this is a perfect hot weather cutting the grass beer."
"Clean, relatively light in body with a underlying taste of citric lemon, this brew can be quaffed endlessly without any challenge. Slightly off-dry in the mouth and totally refreshing, this brew satisfies without being over the top or over endowed. A great all around, year long lager that is authentic and genuinely Germanic and satisfies with ease."
"D: I am quickly becoming a huge fan on Munich beer! I suppose since they have been doing it since the beginning of time, they ought to know how to do it right."
"My girlfriend notes this doesn't taste good with pretzels and I would agree."
"Spaten premium pours a light golden color with a centimeter or so of white foam. Given the size and look of the foam, it left considerable lacing. The aroma is inviting with doughy bready notes. A light mouthfeel with some buoyant carbonation. Grainy malt along with some starchiness begins on the palate. As the beer moves back the mild hops balances the subtle beginning. This is a well rounded beer. A classic refreshing brew."
"Yeah, palatable enough once you get over that medicinal finish. But nothing special."
"the label says: MALT LIQUOR. good! i was feeling cheap. ;)"
"Drinkability: This is a well done, thirst quenching beer."
"D: Great easy drinking all around lager."
"D--Nothing is wrong with this beer--except maybe the green bottle. It just doesn't have anything special to differentiate itself from others in this style"
"D - I find that this is a very easy beer to drink...this glass is nearly finished by the end of my review. I wish it weren't bottled in green bottles to help combat some of that skunk...I would love to try this one on tap! I wish all beer finished as clean and crisp."
"Drinkability - This is an ok beer. I am coming to the conclusion that German Pilsners and Lagers don't do much for me. They are not bad, but just nothing I flip out over. They are a good change for me on occasion, but I don't want to make an evening out of this. Just not my preferred style."
"drinkability; I'm always thrown off at first but the taste grows on me and this beer is quite refreshing. I buy it often times."
"The flavors on this Helles are light, subtle, and clean. Very tasty and QUITE drinkable."
"I really wanted to like this beer, just like I've really wanted to like it in the past. I just don't find it to very interesting or tasty. I would drink it again, probably with the hope I'd finally stumble across that really good tasting Spaten lager."
"D- Light, crisp, refreshing. Very drinkable and unlikely to slow you down. All in all a good helles."
"D- the flavours are pleasant but nothing really jumps out, pretty rounded, the slightly dry finish just makes you want to have another sip. a very easy drinker and would be a very good session beer."
"D - This style has grown on me, and to me this is one of the better examples that I've had. Lot's of clean flavors with good balance."
"Overall, a delicious German beer of the Munich Helles Lager variety. I would probably take this over Warsteiner or Pilsener Urquell, it seems to have more character while still being quite pleasing to many peoples' tastes."
"I found this beer to be slightly above average but not much else. Don't get me wrong this eclipses anything for BMC but it isn't anything to go nuts for. A good beer but not great. I love Helles and maybe am spoiled by Penn Gold, but this wasn't exactly what I was expecting."
"Pours a nice straw color with some lively carbonation and a nice white head. Nose is aromatic with a bit of floral and herbal hops, though mostly light bread and grain. Taste is slightly bitter with some grain and straw. Feel brigs brisk carbonation leading to some pretty good drinkability."
"Drinkability: Went well with a meal (pottage and bread) but I think this would be better with pizza or a burger. Very drinkable."
"D: Great session beer. Balanced, fairly low in alcohol, with no off-flavors"
"This is a fine beer, with well-balanced, pleasant flavor that sits well on the palate. Those looking for pungency and strength may do better elsewhere, but you can't fault Spaten Premium for being a fine, easygoing brew. There's a place for that. I think Bud drinkers and aficionados alike can find something here. The difference between this and a typical macrobrew is the subtle additional flavors that come across - a little malt, a little lemon, some balanced hop flavor - all which combine to produce good Bavarian beer."
"Pours a light pale yellow color with a thin white head which gives way to not much lacing. The aroma is of bready malt and biscuits with hints of honey and a touch grassy hops. The taste has a biscuit and bread malt backbone with slight hints of honey and a little hop bite at the back end. The taste is crisp and refreshing. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and creamy. The drinkability is good, it is crisp refreshing and there is not much to make you dislike it but the flavors aren't over the top."
"Drinkability is 100%, definitely a session brew if you're into the lighter colored ones. Overall it's not something that particularly strikes my fancy but in and of itself it's not a bad brew, very neutral."
"Beer has an odd late bitterness at the back that lingers in what could, if I were more cynical, could be described as an aftertaste, but its not a swallow flavor its a late grainy/hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel is like water,seriously, its wet and thin and light, easy drinking for sure. The forward of the beer is mildly sweet and middle falls a little flat. It finishes well, except for that distracting bitterness. Its pretty good and I'd have it again. Its a good lawnmower beer."
"This is an excellent session brew for warm months or, really, anytime of the year."
"What I can say is that it poured well, with a foamy head. The aroma is clean, honey sweet and biscuity. It tasted very crisp and carbonated with a warming mouthfeel. The hops add a mild, bitter flavor. Certainly a drinkable beer."
"All in all, a rather middling brew; I'm not complaining, but there are so many better examples of the style. Decent showing."
"Decent to drink, but refreshing? Maybe. The flavor is nice for this style, but borders on being too skunky to take seriously."
"Tested on a rainy afternoon in may 2010. Poured in a FCBayern-Pilsener glass. Denotes a bright golden color, oil type, thin head of foam with acceptable duration and retention. In the smell, is a blend of floral and herbal hops. The taste have the same hops with some extra biscuity malt and olive oil. The mouthfeel is extra-crunchy, off of thirst, medium bitterness with a bittersweet finish, smooth body. In the drinkability, is the second ""most crisp"" beer i have taste (after Corona Extra), by far the best munich helles lager style."
"D- All around pretty good beer. Somewhat standard though. What you'd expect from a Munich Helles lager. Very easy to drink."
"Light bodied with high carbonation."
"The taste can pretty much be summarized by the word ""meh", but since BA reviews require more characters than that, I guess I'll extrapolate. It's malty, clean, sweet without any hops to balance the malt; it fades into nothing. There's no finish, not much in the way of nuance. It's in no way terrible, but it is poorly balanced and extremely boring. The sweetness seems to stick to the palate after a while, which makes this difficult to drink in any large quantities."
"Poured into a pint glass a very pale clear gold. An unusual color. A bright white fizzy 2 finger head. Some lacing. Mild lemony citrus smell. A near perfect mixture of sweet malts and bitter hops, a crisp earthy taste. Nice medium light body with good carbonation. So smooth going down. Good aftertaste. Refreshing and sessionable. This is definitely one of my favorite overall breweries. They can do no wrong."
"Overall: Underutilized and underrated, yet fairly easy to find. Definitely give this a try."
"This is a pretty unspectacular but competent lager. Nice clear pour with a brief head. Grassy and bready aroma with the same sort of flavour. A bit like a water cracker. Mouthfeel is sparkly and crisp and so drinkability is good. Sessionable but not exciting."
"One of those beers where a twelve pack disappears before you know it. Noble hop flavors and mild bitterness battle to a standstill with slightly sweet, grainy malts. Very clean with no off-flavors whatsoever. This probably is not my favorite Helles (Hofbrau gets that distinction), but it is a prime example of what the style is all about."
"So easy to drink. One of the best widely available lagers in my books."
"A classic German lager, the kind thst makes you yearn for a liter sized boot to drink it from. Simple, but well done."
"Spaten Munchner Hell poured a lighter amber color, with almost no head. There wasnt much of a smell to it either. It tasted very much like a typical lager, but a bit stronger, and smooth. It like lagers had an easy drinkability. Overall a better lager, easy to drink, a good beer."
"Great tasting Munich lager, just the right amount of smoothness to bitter beer taste. Very smooth, pours a golden type color and smells great. Smells of a wholesome beer, fine bubbles from the carbonation. A very good Munich style lager, and the price is very good for a delicious tasting beer."
"Descent, but not very compelling to me."
"overall: a very nice lager highly drinkable could drink 5 or 6 in a row. great summer beer."
"Crystal clear and light gold with a short white cap of fine and rocky bubbles. The head quickly settled to a collar, leaving behind streaky lace. Hoppy aroma, spicy with notes of sulfur and lemons, almost floral. Malt was quite mild. Light bitterness allowed delicate malt sweetness and spicy hops to cover the palate. Short finish of malt and hops. Crisp and dry, light bodied with average plus carbonation. I liked this quite a bit, even though I'm not partial to the sulfury hop notes. A slight bit more bitterness would have made it a little more refreshing, but it's a minor quibble."
"A near perfect Munich Helles. Enjoy!"
"Drinkability - not a great beer in general, in my opinion, not a whole lot of taste to it, but it would be easy to drink, so it gets higher repeat drinkability."
"Taste is very mellow and light, not yoo complex but super drinkable and crisp. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Decent beer for te price worth checking out."
"The head was semi-strong and lasting (with a good pour) and the taste was pretty good. Spaten is easy to drink, so its great for sporting events but if your looking for something unique, this doesn't quite fit the bill. Its an average Lager."
"D: A decent drinker but for the skunkiness. Would probably be a lot better on tap."
"Drinkability: Easy; everything's balanced and at generally modest intensities, making for a very drinkable beer."
"d - An ok lager but nothing special. Probably wouldn't seek out again."
"Serving type: bottle"
"I poured from a 12 once bottle into a nonic. It pours a fizzy clear yellow, with a 2 finger head that was quickly gone. There is lots of malty sweetness on the nose. The beer is sweet and has a hoppy bitterness with hay notes. It is balanced and has a bitter finish. The beer is light and well carbonated. IMO the flavor is more like a Euro lager."
"Great helles. If my understanding is correct, Spaten is the originator of the style, in reaction to encroaching Czech pilsners. That being the case, it explains why this example is relatively bitter compared to others that I have tried."
"If you like lagers you need to buy this beer! It's delicious!"
"Overall, I will drink this at least one more time. If it's the exact same, I'll pass on it in the future after that point."
"Pours light golden yellow with a bright white head. Bubbles like champagne. Head thins out, but hangs around to nearly the end with some light lacing. Smelled quite skunky! I couldn't smell much over it. Damn Green Bottles! Tastes kinda skunky too, but not so bad. Taste is a little thinner than I had hoped. Nicely balanced though. Crisp and light and a little sweet on the finish. Reminds me of a Stella or a Heine. Similar style and quality to me. Easy to drink."
"Appearance was a nice gold color. Smell was rather weak, which I was not expecting from this import, but the taste was much better. Very smooth beer to drink. Overall, very enjoyable beer. Not sure about the price as it was given to me at a family gathering, but a very good German beer."
"D - This is a great beer for dinner or a session beer to drink in quantity. This beer took the sting off from having such a poor selection of beers on the cruise. At least I felt like I was drinking a decent beer."
"Drinkability - This is one of the most drinkable lagers I've had in a long time. I suppose its not something you drink for the flavor, although it is pleasant, but it is solid on its own and I can see this going well with food."
"No fireworks, but a good benchmark. No nasty sourness or aftertaste shows what a good lager can be."
"Bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a rather pale gold with a disappearing froth of white fizz. Aroma is earthy and grainy with a hint of caramel and some mustiness. Definitely a bit more to this than the appearance would indicate. Soft malty flavor, mostly grainy, some light breadiness, mild grassiness. I'm liking the lack of a strong metallic character which a lot of German lagers have. This is very crisp and finishes dry. One of the better pale lagers around."
"Spaten or other Euro/German lagers or pilsners are good change of pace beers on a nice warm, day. Was perfect compliment to grilled Italian Sausage brats and asparagus."
"Sort of like a German session beer. It hits all of the highlights required of the style and goes down quickly with food."
"Good beer on a warm day"
"Well, lots of beers later I can say that this is not the case, but this is still a nicely drinkable brew and a refreshing example of the style. It's not over the top with the flavor by any means, but it makes a great thirst-quencher on a warm day."
"The flavor is that of traditional bready sweet malts with a slightly bitter edge at the end, leaving this beer tasting very crisp. Overall a very good standard beer, very traditional...mouth feel is less watery than it would appear."
"It's not easy to claim this beer as being anything other than an ordinary, conventional kind of lager but that doesn't mean it isn't owed some acknowledgments. For one, clean and appreciably malty beers like this are not commonplace in North America. I wish domestic macro brewers shared the same standards as their German counterparts."
"This goes down really easy -- very good with food -- no real bold in your face flavors, but thirst quenching and palate clearing. A really decent beer and worth trying."
"Drinkabilty- I actually enjoyed the drinkabilty of this way more then i remember trying it almost a year ago, very smooth with a nice long creamy sweet finish, easy to slam down, very nice flavor for a lager"
"Close to a full finger of pure white foam, delicate enough to dissipate with ease, lacing is thin but there, plain gold color, more yellow than orange, has hue depth in spite of transparency, lazy bubbles slowly rise within. Bready dough on the sweet side in the nose, touch of corn, more bite from something like white pepper than herbaceous grass, while the hops seem to provide direction and a pinch of white citrus, the sweetness of the malts some more dominant. Medium-bodied, has decent heft without giving up much of its ability to refresh. Hay, sweeter grains, corn, more floral here, teases out a small portion of apple, pear fruit and lemon peel. The carbonation is fine yet very active, few flavors soak in fully. The peppery spice remains as a subtle accent. Very solidly put together, easy to quaff and, if anything, suffers from comparison to much flashier brews."
"Poured this pale yellow beer into a pint glass. There was barely any head that when poured. The aroma of the beer is that of wheat and sweet grass. The taste of the beer follows suit with a tint of a maltyness to it. Overall a decent beer for the summer months."
"Poured from a green 12 oz. bottle. Has a very pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is skunky, not much else. Taste is crisp, slightly sweet, rather bland. Not a lot going on here. Feels light in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a fairly mediocre beer."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and the drinkability is great. These can be put down a few at a time. Flavorful but not very filling."
"I liked this beer, pretty good balance of malt and hops, didn't get any off flavors due to green bottle. Got this in a world market holiday gift pack. Poured straw yellow, fizzy head, faded pretty quick. Smelled a bit like BMC. Taste is very refreshing, pretty full flavor. Very easy to drink."
"An excellent, sessionable lager that never becomes boring. The helles style is very underrated."
"Drinkability rates high, this is a nice German lager, smooth and refreshing."
"Obviously a popular German Beer, probably third to Becks and St. Pauli Girl, at least in the US. Spaten is a great lager. It isn't too light or heavy, refreshing and very drinkable for a German Beer. It has a very quick head, and some lacing. What can I say, the beer sells it self."
"This beer is a flat out great lager. Light but still has the full body of a full flavored beer. Would be great for grilling or a bar-b-que."
"I could drink it, but truth be told, I think it's a little dull, and not because it's a lager, either. I kinda have to wonder about the freshness. It's possible that the relative dullness is due to it being not that fresh. Unfortunately, therein lies the problem with rating subtle, relatively light German lagers."
"Overall, I'm disappointed with this brew and in myself for buying a six-pack of it. It just does not have much to offer. Its light and refreshing but still very average."
"Pours estremely pale with frothy, white head. Good lacing. Extremely clear with champagne-like carbonation. Spicy, floral hop aroma with light malt character. Moderately hoppy flavor with a slightly dry finish. Fairly well balanced. A little bit of skunk. Crisp and clean."
"Pours a straw yellow in the glass with a white froth. Instantly I get a pronounced skunkiness along with a crisp graininess, some emon, some bread-like yeastiness, and subtle hardboiled egg whites. The beer has a decent mouthfeel, is crisp & dry, & has flavors of grains, skunk, and some green/leafy hops. Although there really isn't much there, the beer is crisp, very easy to drink, and really isn't that bad considering how much of this beer is made. One of the aspects that I most admire about large breweries is their consistency."
"A very good beer that almost certainly deserves to score higher due to a glass that wasn't as clean as it should have been. Very approachable, very easy to drink."
"the canned version was much sweeter than I remembered. The appearance was fine, if anything it was better than the bottle because of the way the pour looked. the smell was the same but a bit sweeter, and the taste was the same, but sweet: grains, bit of hops and sweetness. the feel was fine, but the drinkability really suffers because the added flavour."
"This beer was really easy to drink. A few swallows and the bottle was gone. A few of these with some pizza would be nice. My only complaint would be that I wish that I would have had a fresher sample. But otherwise this is a good basic solid beer."
"D - Very light in ABV and not feeling so very drinkable and enjoyable."
"I'm not really familiar with the style, and I had no idea what style this beer was when I ordered it, so all scores are judged against standard Euro lagers."
"Not the best Helles I've ever had, but certainly easy to find in the US, and a good example of the style. Smooth and easy to drink."
"This is one of the easiest german beers to get and it is as good as many of the harder to fine brands. Very good light color, a little lighter than a pilsner. Not too much aroma but a very interesting and unique flavor, which is a little fruitier than a traditional pilsner. Almost like a cross between a pils and a Kolsch. Inexpensive and easy to find, I would recommend this beer."
"Drinkability: Great German lager for a hot day or as a simple accompaniment to food or friends."
"D - good brew, I'll have to come back to this style when I study the european lagers."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability scored high in my book and this is definitely a refreshing beer I will keep around the house."
"When poured, the color was medium yellow, with a nice amount of white foam and some lace retention. The taste an smell had a light bite from the hops and a hint of citrus aroma. A nice pleasantly balanced Lager from the hops and citrus. This is a wonderful lager."
"pours a clear yellow pils like color with good lacing and head the smell is some noble hops and sweet malts..the taste is crisp and light with a small hop bite it finishes smooth overall a good helles or pils very refreshing and a decent taste its recommended but not one i would buy all that much worth a try"
"Spaten Premium Lager is well balanced refreshing, not very filling making it an easy drinker...sure worth a second, a third..."
"D: If you're sitting on a patio on a hot summer's day, this would be hard to give up. However, I can't say much about its complexity if you're actually interested in tasting the uniqueness of the beer's flavor."
"What is most striking about this beer is its drink-ability. It has a nice flavor, though not quite as much as I would like. due to its light texture and extreme drinkability it is definitely a great summer beer, ideal for relaxing after a long summer day in the sun."
"Taste: If it wasn't for the dryness, I could see this as an option for having multiple during a hot summer day. I wasn't really impressed with the flavor or smell of this beer and don't think I would ever buy it (my brother brought home a sixer)."
"This beer is a refreshing break on a hot summer day. It has a grassy and grainy taste with a malty pasture like aftertaste. There is a bit more bitterness than most beers in this category. It is a nice looking beer with clear golden body that is lined with small bubbles. The smell is pretty plain. The mouthfeel is thin but has some bite."
"D- Eight bucks a six pack this stuff goes down real smooth, it appears to me like a Bud or Coors (American domestic) but when I gulp it down I know it's much more than just that. I'm a dark heavy beer drinker but when I'm looking for something light, golden, and semi inexpensive ...I'll reach for this lager."
"The flavor is quite crisp, a touch on the tart side. There is a lemony slightly spicy crispness, but there is also some hop towards the finish, but some sweeter grainy malts underneath. The beer is interestingly balanced in that respect. Some hop, some spice, lemony tart crispness, some sweeter grains underneath. The mouthfeel is a bit oily, and it does add something to the body of the beer, making it more medium bodied than most beers of the style. The aftertaste is a bit of the tartness and hop lingering beyond. Not a bad beer, refreshing, easy to drink, not brilliant though."
"D - A pleasant enough lager, not much to be overly negative about apart from the flatness."
"D: Refreshing, very refreshing. The taste is very nice. This is what you should drink on a warm summer day. I had it with a pizza - it was very nice."
"That said, you could certainly buy a worse beer at the store, that's for sure."
"Notes: It has an easy drinking texture and a good simple and balanced flavor."
"A good light lager, great during the summer."
"Weird drinking this now a-days after turning snobbish. Looks like your usual decocted lager, got a bit of that golden hue to it. Smells very mild, a bit sweet. Tastes like a decocted beer, but maybe it's just mass-production that takes the melanoidins away. Actually has a sulfery yeast character like an American lager would, just way mellower. Hops are also very mild, but you could drink this with just about anything. I'd say Hofbrau does a much better helles."
"D: this is a good beer, simply put. It is an enjoyable and refreshing lager"
"A very drinkable, light beer. Another classic brewery and classic beer. Would be absolutely wonderful on a hot day (or really, any time)."
"This beer has a very special space in my heart with Warsteiner since they were the two beers that changed my appreciation and taste for other beers. Pours an excellent golden color into a Spaten mug. Awesome aroma of malty bread and some grain. Excellent carbonation and crispiness. The hops come in near the end with a very nice smooth, crisp dry finish that lingers for a little bit. I love this beer. A great session lager. I think I will go and buy some more right now."
"a well balanced premium lager/pils is neither extreme nor innovative but is always an art."
"Drinkability- very drinkable, enjoyed every minute of it, would drink it regularly"
"Conclusion: Nothing fancy or special here, but drinkable, refreshing, and great with some bratwurst and sauerkraut"
"The beer felt light and crisp, honestly, just like the style should. The beer was very easy to drink, the carbonation was just right and the beer was very refreshing. I could drink this beer all day long during the summer."
"...and it's quite cheap here in Sweden! How do they do it? :)"
"A clear golden yellow pour,with three fingers of creamy white head that left some spotty lacing. Aroma of pale malt,and slightly skunky floral,and citrus hops. Flavor is balanced, a good amount of pale malt for a Euro Lager,slightly dry with hints of lemon,and some faint hints of spice maybe pepper ? A slightly dry finish,crisp mouthfeel. I would call this quite drinkable,and a fun try but nothing very memoriable"
"No one single ingredient has to overpower the others to let you know it's there. The brewers present them all to us equally and you get the sense that they've worked hard to make sure it comes out that way. When properly poured into a clean glass you get a fluffy, lasting head crowning the rich golden liquid that holds just the right amount of gassiness. Well done Spaten!"
"D: There are better German lagers, but it's still an excellent example of the style. It's really easy to put down a bunch of these in a single sitting."
"This beer is purely average, but by European standards, that still means good."
"Overall: I would avoid getting this beer. Definitely not a good example of what Germany is capable of! The word ""premium"" on the bottle is a misleading representation of what you're about to drink. I'd rather drink a Pabst Blue Ribbon!"
"Of the Helles lagers I've had, this is by far the best, but I'm not quite ready to give it any 5's. Future tastings may change this."
"D: Very Very good lager. Sweet and fresh and enough hops. Extremely drinkable."
"This was actually pretty damn good. A very good session beer for sure, a six pack could be put down with no problem."
"Drinkability: Suffers from less than stellar palate, but is a beer that remains interesting throughout the experience. A good representation of the style, although a slightly more subdued bitterness might have worked better. Excellent price/quality relationship."
"I feel this beer has been somewhat under-rated because of its lack of excessiveness. It's a solid example of a well behaved brew playing its role as a daily staple."
"Pours a clearish yellow colored body, with an average whitish colored head. Has a malty fresh aroma. A nice clean taste, but has a watery palate. Some aroma of hops is present too. Has a crisp malty aftertaste. Somewhat refreshing."
"D- Very drinkable, but not much to come back for. Too one dimensional and straightforward for my taste."
"This tastes more like a Pilsner than a lager to me. Bitter if not stale. It is very easy to drink, but doesn't offer much. The initial taste wears off quickly, leaving a highly unimpressive beer."
"Drinkability: Aside from the souring skunkiness, it's a fine, enjoyable lager."
"D- Overall a pretty nice lager worth drinking again."
"D- Excellent, I could drink many of these."
"Pours a golden straw with mild head and decent lacing. Smells of grains, bitterness, and lemony freshness. Tastes crisp and grainy and bitter with some decent complexity, but the flavors just don't blend well in my opinion. If offered to me, I'll drink this, but I'm not going out of my way to get it."
"Notes - It's hard not to drink this fast. It's one of the best easily-found lagers out there. I'm not big on keg parties, but if I were to throw one, this might be the keg of choice."
"taste: i consider this a simple beer. brewed for the masses. if someone offered this or most any other kind of pilsner, i would take this. theres flavors of honey and lemon and grain, all the usual i guess. the lack of head isnt very exciting but it's what i was expecting. it's far from a disappointment but also far from the top of any list."
"D: This is good, if a bit run-of-the-mill. Quite drinkable, this would be easy to session."
"T&M - Smooth yet drying mouthfeel with a very clean taste. Taste of bread and mildly sweet malt with a low-moderate hop bitterness. Very nice and drinkable. No unpleasant aftertaste."
"Not a super beer, but a good reflection of this style."
"Get you some and enjoy with friends."
"Very drinkable. Especially after you've had many other beers in a holiday party environment. Don't get carried away though."
"This brew is refreshing, and flavorful for this style, in my opinion. Complex aroma. Overall, good atmosphere, nice finish. Solid quaff."
"Don't drink unless it's for an added review."
"5/3/4/2/8 (2.2/5)"
"I only wish it didn't have to be special ordered where I live..."
"Same notes again in the aftertaste, with strong maltness, biscuit, and some hop."
"D - No problems here. Could easily drink many of these."
"Crisp clean brew. Decent amount of carbonation. High drinkable quality, but I'd move on to more flavorful beers after this."
"The taste s zesty with bread and herbs with some toasted grain and lemon. It's somewhat soft and creamy, yet zesty, lightly sweet with a faint hop bite, and a crisp, almost tangy, faintly lemony-herbal finish. It's quite drinkable, but not nearly as good as some others."
"Drinkability - Not too bad here, rather easy to drink. Might become a go-to choice when I need a lager."
"D- Drinks real well with no offensive qualities"
"Great overall lager. Perfect to switch the bud drinkers over to."
"Mouth feel is nice and bubbly. This beer is very easy to drink and could be one of the better session beers. I really enjoyed this beer."
"I picked up a six pack of this classic German beer on a beer run today, I've been looking for it for awhile but its not sold at any of the area grocery stores I frequent. On opening and pouring into my trusty Schlafly Pale Ale pint glass I got the classic German lager smell. Color is a nice straw yellow, with a small head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving a ring with some lacing that lasted. Taste was hoppy bite up front, a little bitter but very pleasant. This beer is very crisp, dry, and cleanses the palate. Very refreshing. Overall this is one of the best German Lager's I've had and I can see drinking a lot more of this now that I know where to get it. My old standby for this type of beer was Becks, but this is a better beer. Time to work on the rest of that six pack..."
"This would be a good standy to keep in the fridge."
"Quite a refreshing brew. Drinkability is top notch; I could easily quaff this all night long and not tire of it."
"D - Probably one of the most enjoyable beers I've had in it's category. Easy to drink, smooth aftertaste, goes down really really easy."
"Overall, a very good beer and fun to drink without having to get blown away or too serious."
"The smell was of grain and bananas. The taste was clean and fluffy. It had a grain backbone with a crisp finish. It had a light mouth feel and was pretty thin. Overall a solid MH Lager and was nicely balanced."
"It's been a while since I've had the keg version, but it lacks the skunkiness and I'd probably give it a solid B."
"Pours a clear pale yellow with minimal head that reduces quite quickly. Nose is skunk and grain. Taste follows with some skunkiness as well as the standard lager graininess. A small bit of apple and straw. Mouthfeel is too thick and slightly undercarbonated. A good drinkability. Overall a decent lager, certainly better than your average american macro, but I think there are defenitely some better examples out there. A good choice for an easy drinking lager, but its usually sitting right next to a paulaner, which I find to be slightly better. Decent lager."
"D. A great ""Go To"" beer when you want really want to have a beer with Dinner."
"D- Pretty drinkable, I just wish the European brewers would get over having the ""traditional European look"" and ditch the green bottles for brown ones."
"ADD. - After drinking an entire sixer I realize that some of these were obviously light-struck, as at least a couple were very nice without the ""off"" skunky flavors."
"I had this on tap in a dive bar in Western Massachussetts. The beer looked like any other Munich Helles, pale yellow colored and maybe a little hazy with a really thick foam. The smell was a little cleaner than other examples, a very sweet malt base with only a little floral aroma from hops. It's tasty and satisfying without being extreme, to me it's what a macro lager should be. I'd say this is my least favorite Munich Helles from the big six in Munich (my favorite would be Augustiner, maybe closely folloed by Paulaner), but I'll probably get it again many times, especially if the other options are Miller or Bud products"
"Had to order one when I saw it on tap. Classic crystal clear yellow-gold. Nice head, smells of fresh grasses and grains. Light body as a Lager should have. Medium carbonation with a proper German fizz. Very European flavor. Bitter and malty with an earthy note and a strong yeast flavor. Crisp and sharp. Sort of herbaceous and rather well thought out; taut flavors. Not much depth and not very challenging but a good beer and no doubt the Germans would defend it to the depths of Dusseldorf."
"D - Excellent example of a helles. Being that I am not a fan of this style though, I didn't rate it high."
"A very nice summer beer in my opinion. Pours a pale yellow, almost like a Bud or some other cheap lager. Smells a lot better, sweet malt, hops and citrus. Tastes like the same combo, a very nice balance. Mouthfeel is on the averge side, quite carbonated. Overall a nice summer sipper, go get some."
"Smooth and light-medium bodied, the drink is crisp, refreshing, and extremely drinkable."
"Recommended as a good depiction of the style..."
"Pours a bright, pale sunshine yellow. A one finger, bright white, spongey head lastst for about five minutes. Eventually recedes to nothing. Good bubbling though. The aroma has very pale pilsner malts and some grassy hops. The taste is hinting at trees, and a fresh cut prairie grass next to a small stream. Dry malts and light, earthy hops. Very reshing palate and easy to drink. Great session beer that could easily be served by the liter."
"Very drinkable."
"D: Nice session brew. Goes down easily. I could drink several of these in one night."
"This is an easy beer to drink, very refreshing and one I return to now and again."
"The dark yellow color was different than what I'm use to. The aroma and taste have a bit of a sting to them indicitive of malt liquor, I found both to be a bit unpleasant. I probably won't try this again, sorry."
"Overall it was the classic Spaten I remember. Of course it pales to what I normally drink now, but back in the day this was as solid as they come. I am glad this can be gotten again as it is the a quintessential part of any good lineup."
"mouthfeel is a little lighter than i would like it, but pretty silky, which is nice. drinkability is very high, very clean beautiful high quality lager."
"I usually have this on tap at the Heidelberg in NYC. I have never been disappointed, they also have Spaten Octoberfest as well. I'm drinking one as I write this review, just poured from the bottle to the glass, It's not as good as on tap, but still enjoyable. Pretty darn good!"
"D: Great beer, grew up with it and love it dearly. Good representation of the style."
"Had at Moan and Dove. Very clear gold look with a thick head that thins eventually with little lacing. Sharp grassy hops with hints of spice were wonderfully permeating from the drink. The drinks bittersweetness was probably its best strength and ultimate balance. Great, refreshing carbonation. Overall, wicked good."
"D: The raisin undertones are very interesting and, combined with the velvety feel, make for a singular taste experience."
"D- one of the better helles/pils/golden lagers i've had, i could be a happy guy with a keg of this."
"Anyway, A plebian people-pleaser from the kind Teutons at Spaten!"
"D - easy drinking brew."
"Pours a brilliantly clear, light to medium straw color with a dense white head. Aromas of slight DMS, a little floral hop note, but overall very clean. On the palate, a smooth malty rich brew hits the mouth with light and sweet flavors of Pils grain, and a bit of hop flavor. The finish is not completely dry with a lingering malt sweetness and just a balancing hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium low with moderate carbonation. A very crisp and clean beer with just a touch of hop character."
"MF&D - Thin bodied, but plenty of carbonation to burn the tongue a little and give a nice aftertaste. Pairs great with most cuisine, a great session beer."
"This brew is light and crisp, as well as refreshing. It makes for a good session beer with not much thought involved. If your goal is to sit back, clear your mind in a shaded outdoors area , such as a biergarten, go ahead hand head to Spaten."
""
"Even in bottles this can be great. Just get a paper sealed 12-pack and check the date on the outside. Make sure it's the same year and make note that the first two digits are related to the day of the year. The closer to today's date the better...obviously."
"Overall, I think I just might want to go back for more of this. Spaten Premium Lager has struck a good balance between the malt and hops profiles and is very easy drinking. Worth sending down your soup cooler."
"D: Super drinkable. Litres and litres, all night, no problem. The word ""drinkability"" was made for beers like this."
"D I could drink many of these but I am not a big fan of Lagers."
"D - This is a pretty good German brew."
"D-refreshing and a little more flavor than your average Pils or Lager"
"Poured a pale straw hue with light head. The aroma was primarily light malt, faint hops, and although it's hard to describe, it smells of decent quality and modesty. The flavor is of a creamy malt and a very light hops. Again, this is simplicity incarnate, and the flavors are in a nice harmony. Easy and pleasant on the palate. This would be easy to pair, and is light-hearted, yet delicious."
"This beer was included in a 3 pack variety case I picked up from the local distributor. Not familiar with Spaten products I was willing to give it a try. I was expecting to it to taste similar to Heneken or Grolsch, however it came up a little short. Not enough flavor, but very smooth and drinkable. Nice for a hot summer day, or a good pizza beer. Not bad beer for the price."
"D - Very nice goes great with pizza, good any day."
"Poured golden yellow color with plenty of carb. and a small fizzy white head that reduced to a ring with no lacing. First sip and taste was that of classic German pils .vWhat I did like about this was that it didn't have the overwhelming skunk taste that accompanies many German beers, if i'm going to drink German beers the Munich styles are my first choice. Very clean, fresh and crisp with a small hop finish on the end."
"Nice offering from Bavaria. Poured this out of a 12oz green-glass bottle this past weekend. Poured a pale, golden color with a foamy white head atop. Head quickly dissipated. Smell was of the common Euro-pale lager, with a sweet tinge accompanied by an oakey afterthought. Taste was good, comforting, sweet malt dominated what little hops were discernable. A good, solid beer. Doesn't over dazzle you and doesn't let you down. Consistently good tasting beer."
"Everytime I try and brew a helles, I buy as many as I have access to in Boise.. this one is always available... the Spaten is damn near perfect and a fantastic beer for your friends who hate micros or imports... Pretty much spot on for the style .. even better on draft.. don't pretend that this is a pils... it is not."
"Not too bitter, a good blend of hops and malts. Nothing overpowering."
"D - I expected more from Spaten I remember the other beers to be better than this. Over all this is pretty much just an average beer not bad just ok"
"Typical taste. Light malt, big yeasty, doughiness. I hate it. Piss gold, white head, musty smell and taste and a bit undercarbonated. Call it a dortmunder/helles, but it still is boring, average, and I don't like anything about it. Paid 5.25 for it on tap and left half of it."
"D - Ok beer. I've had many lager's that we're better."
"D - Good drinkability because of the body and light flavors -- nothing harsh."
" Mouthfeel is thin and bubbly. Could drink more but would prefer something else."
"D: Its a drinkable helles, but there are far better ones out there. Tasted fresh enough but was a bit tasteless in the finish. Nevertheless, easily drinkable but i favour a few helles above this one."
"Had this beer at an irish pub in college station. Poured a nice golden color with a small foamy head. Great taste did not finish with any skunk flavor and had a wonderful mouthfeel. love this beer drink it all the time and would love to go to Germany and drink it with the GERMANS!!!!"
"M&D: the mouthfeel is o.k., not too fizzy, befitting the cleanliness just quite well; for a 5.2%abv. Helles Lager, this one comes surprisingly light in maltiness and clean for the palate, while the bitterness level doesn't come sufficient to live up to a Pils-style Lager. Despite being slightly mundane, this beer fares as a well-made, easy-drinking, meal-pairing beer, perhaps working well to wash down some overly-salty Bratwurst~~"
"Another beer that brings back memories of Germany. This beer was served in a German liter mug at a local German restaurant, Schnitzelhaus. It pours a rich cream soda color with a large head. The beer has a very citrus smell and tastes slightly acidic. It has a crisp flavor with a light hop finish. Although it's not a very complicated beer, I consider Spaten to be a tasty example of German lager."
"Good beer."
"It could have been the pour, or the keg this was coming from, but the complete lack of body carbonation, no head retention, and muted flavor sof everything dimmed the experience a bit. However, it's not a funky, imported-tasting brew, and was pretty serviceable, although it ranks low on my list of good Spaten beers."
"D= totally drinkable."
"Drinkability: Very easy drinking brew."
"d - it was a struggle to get through this, i almost poured it down the drain."
"Certainly drinkable enough to finish a boot without wishing I had ordered something else."
"Poured into a pint glass this has a straw color, transparent. Minimal white head that lasted only for a moment. This has an aroma of hops and smells almost a little skunky. My first taste was bitter with nice presence of strong hops. This beer reminded me of my time in Germany and seemed to be a very traditional example of a German brew. Nothing special, but a decent showing. This is a drinkable import, but there are better beers available for a better price here in the states."
"I like this beer but I am not extremely impressed with it. I have had much better and would not mind trying the other beers made by spaten. Good beer, but I would recomend a belgian white, I would recomend this beer with any food, I cannot specifically point out what food this beer would go with."
"I had the good fourtune of drinking this several times in the Spaten Haus which is the Breweries showcase pub and restaurant in Munich. Glad to see this beer travels so well to the States!"
"simple stuff, but well executed."
"Drinkabilty-At 5.2 I urge you to pick up a 12 and take them to a party people will not be dissapointed in closing this brand has impressed me yet again try this and Optimator if you can find them."
"D- Classic German lager.Malty semi-sweet very lightly hopped and well balanced.No off tastes. Very easy to drink more than a couple of these!"
"Last note, I would say its best to drink these not too long after you get them, the last one of my pack had skunked before I got to it(a couple of weeks time). besides that its a decent beer."
"O: Not that I'm surprised, but much better than an American lager. Considering I'm more of an ale fan, this has quite a nice flavor, and would be great for tailgating or a hot summer day."
"P.S. Try this in the gallon and a half keg and you get a lot more malt character. It's a little creamier too. Tastes a lot fresher and the setup reminds you of a traditional tap you would see in germany; except more modern."
"Pours a clear golden beer with a white head that falls away fast leaving nothing behind. Smell is slightly sweet and very bready. Taste is slightly bready and sweet with a crisp lager taste. Mouthfeel is slightly harsh is carbonation, crisp I guess is what you'd say. Overall, this hot spell is a nice pairing with this German lager. Very nice."
"Finish has a touch of malt sweetness."
"(A consistently average 1st review)"
"Pours a pale yellow color with almost no head. Aroma isn't too impressive with a slight skunk. Taste is somewhat smooth, even fruity and goes down very easily. There's some biscuit-like taste to it and it's definitely the opposite of what I expected it to be, due to the slight skunk in the aroma. I have to give this lager props for being very drinkable."
"Pours from the mini keg a clear golden color with thick and creamy head that refuses to die down. Smell is grains, some honey notes and little malt on this one. Taste is a little maltier with some hops coming through as well. Very crisp, clean and smooth in the mouth that makes this a very nice and drinkable beer. We had plenty of fun with this keg on labor day weekend."
"A golden yellow color with plenty of carb. and a small fizzy white head that reduced to a ring with no lacing. First sip and taste was that of classic German pils .vWhat I did like about this was that it didn't have the overwhelming skunk taste that accompanies many German beers, if i'm going to drink German beers the Munich styles are my first choice. Very clean, fresh and crisp with a small hop finish on the end. Very refreshing on a hot summers day."
" Spaten Premium Lager is a well-built lager that can hold its own with the rest of this worlds lagers."
"Pours a rather light straw color with an average white head that left some spot lacing on the glass. The smell is faint, slightly grainy with a touch of grassy hops. The brew has a biscuity malt, a bit metallic, and finishes with a balancing grassy hop. The feel is light almost watery, moderately carbonated, finishes pretty clean. This is a very light Munich Helles, not as complex as the others. However this is a very refreshing brew with no off flavors."
"Overall it is a very interesting and well-balanced beer. I am looking forward to taste another one."
"had this on-tap at the daily bar and grill in chicago (they were out of alpha king). this was a clear straw in color with a pure white head. some sweet bready malts and vegetal aromas in the nose. nice sweet malts upfront balanced by the crisp carbonation and underlying hops. this was well-suited for me given my sweaty balls on a warm august night and quite sessionable."
"Drinkability: Excellent example of the style; crisp and refreshing"
"Drinkability is above average. This is one beer where you can have more than one, and I plan on it."
"A good straightforward helles. A big step up from BMC if not quite as interesting as some of the American micro versions. Buy the completely enclosed twelve pack to protect the dreaded green bottles. A nice example of basic quality German beer in the US."
"Pours very clear and bright gold, with a fluffy, thick head that's perfectly white. The aroma is quite zesty with spicy German hops and some nice bread crust notes. Some sweet cooked grain notes make their way in as well. On the palate, big carbonation first off, along with some sharply bitter, almost gritty hop oils that are laid over an extremely smooth pale malt base that almost defines ""bready"". Mouthfeel is quite nice, as the beer hits both its smooth and rough notes, with the only off note being some carbonation that is perhaps overzealous. Overall, this is an excellent helles."
"For those looking for an above average thirst quencher, this is your beer. For those expecting the delicate, malty lager of yester year -avoid."
"Very drinkable."
"D: Very refreshing, immensely drinkable, easily available locally, and cheap - a good summer choice."
"Finally got my hands on a bottle I was sure would be skunk-free. It doesn't have the raw grains and lager yeast flavors of a Weihenstephaner for instance, but it had a decent hop to it. The malt stayed back and the spicy, but somewhat bland, hops dominated. Still, even if the hops weren't crisp, it's not a bad lager."
"D - This makes me thing of a super-flavorful macro lager. Like what Miller and Bud are trying to accomplish while failing miserably. I like this a lot as a simple session brew. This is something that I would buy a min-keg of."
"Balance is very good, although lacking in standout qualities. Finish is dry, but slightly thin and indistinct, although certainly not negative. Middle of the road Helles."
"Pours a nice golden yellow and a nice white head that left a nice sticky lacing around the Spaten tall glass. Aromas of a nice sweeter malt. The taste of a above average German lager. Sweet where it needs to be, and a bit dry. A small hop bitterness is in the aftertaste."
"Pour into a pilsner glass...moderate golden color with a very nice off white head. On the nose, a subtly pleasant grassy aroma that shouts summer. A refreshing opening with a slightly petrol texture. The hops comes through first with the malt lingering on the finish...a very nice balance. An extremely drinkable beer well worth the $9 for a six pack..."
"Drinkability- This would probably be a good beer if they packaged it right. They lose major points for poor packaging and getting it light-struck."
"D- Smooth, refreshing lager; alcohol taste is very unassuming; this would be a nice beer to drink on a summer day; I get the feeling that I could have quite a few servings without being overwhelmed"
"This was enjoyable, but given its price, I doubt I'll reach for it again. It's worth a try, but don't expect too much out of it."
"Spaten Helles pours up nicely with a light gold color topped a by a fine bubbled but thin head. The head gives up to quickly however, and settles an alarming speed back into the beer. The aroma evokes fresh citrus and mint thoughts. Mildly hopped, the dominate character is the subdued malt aroma. Hints of sulfur are to be found also. All in all a little too subdued for my tastes. However no flaws are detectable, the beer is just simply mild. When it comes to flavor Spaten delivers a slight yeast influenced sulfur quality paired with a mild hop bitterness. Malt quality seemed to be lacking in the flavor department. The mouth feel was thin and almost empty. A very drinkable beer, and in fact, in the Biergarten an absolute crowd pleaser. You cant knock this beers ability to refresh and still maintain its character. There are definitely better Helles in München but this beer gets the job done."
"D - As Im partial to the style, I think Spaten makes for a great session beer. Youre not going to find complexity here. Thats not always what you want. If you want something smooth, tasty, and crisp, Spaten is a good choice. Part of the appeal to me for this beer is that you can find it nearly anywhere. Even Safeway carries this beer, so I dont always have to go to a specialty store to find good beer."
"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not very filling, definitely not one of the better beers in the style. I could drink a few of these, it would only be if I had very little else to choose from."
"D: One of the most sessionable beers on the planet earth! This beer is not ""complex", but it's just plain good, for any time of the day or any season. It's refreshing, it has flavor, nothing is overpowering, just plain perfect for a ""plain"" beer."
"..Or Bohemia's offering Golden Pheasant. Spaten Premium is still a satisfying choice, but the beer with the bird on the label holds it's early lead. The South Pacific's offering is the next scheduled tasting here in the Golden Invitational."
"got a 6 pack of this for 6 bucks, not a bad deal. pours a golden color like most lagers, the smell of a slight skunkiness is apparent as soon as you open the bottle. Smell is more apparent as i pour it, has a bit of a hoppiness smell to it as well, no malt is present. Taste is crisp and light, but still full bodied, one of my favorite lagers, and a beer you can drink all day long, slight carbonation throughout the glass, but little head. Much better lager than heineken, or becks. and for around the same price you can't go wrong."
"EDIT: Or maybe not a few days. I polished it off over the course of the whole day while watching all the Rocky movies but the newest. THAT was a lazy day."
"D- simple and tasty session brew, not much use for this brew, but its not a bad brew at all"
"Mighty quaffable and pleasant to drink. An authentic Munich Helles Lager. Definitely a warmer weather session time brew."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pilsner glass. The beer poured a deep yellow, with no head or lacing. The aroma is light, consisting of a light skunkiness, a little hop sweetness, and a hint of malt. The taste is also very light. Mostly a sweet taste from the hops, and a little thickness created from the malt. Not really a whole lot in the taste that stands out. Light mouthfeel. Overall, I could see having this beer on a summer afternoon, to relax, but if flavor was the issue, I would be going elsewhere. Its not to say that this is a bad beer, but its always hard to enjoy a lager, such as this one, for its flavor. Its stubborn, but I am still trying to get more into lagers. I will try this one again in a few months, and see how my taste has changed."
"I am a very strong supporter of all Spaten works. They make great beer and this is their way of a balanced smooth light beer. The Premium evens out their line up as far as intensity goes, holding the reins of the Optimator. Safe bet as you'll ever get, the way to go for a great simple beer, that doesn't taste like a macro corn brew from the cheap bud and coors."
"Overall a very drinkable lager on draft. A good Madison Square Garden beer."
"A simple and refreshing beer - more malty than hoppy. Not sure if this wasn't an old example - it seemed to lack a certain ""pop"" in the flavor despite otherwise being a clean and attractive beer."
"Pale yellow beer with thin little head. Does last a while though. Smells more like today's mexican beers (i know a lot of the mexican beers were started by german brewers that traveled to mexico) more than a german. Nice tart kind of taste. Kind of creamy with hints of corn. Mouthfeel is smooth and easy going down. Drinkabililty is fair. Crisp refreshing."
"This beer came out a nice golden yellow thats was crystal clear and covered with a nice thick head that slowly tapered away into a thin head, simply put this beer looks really inviting.I can barely smell the hops in this one, but it does have a semi sweet aroma . It looks and smells better than it tastes, don't get me wrong it's not a bad beer, but it could use some work. When it first hits your tongue it feels slightly dull and a little dry, and its aftertaste has a bit of a dry kick to it as well. I can really taste the bitterness of this beer as it hits my throat."
"Has a nice dark golden yellow color. Pours with a nice thick head with tinny bubbles that lace the litre glass as they recede. Has a definite aroma of Vienna malt with a light hop aroma. Malty is how I would describe the taste and aroma of this great German brew."
"For a green bottled Euro this is very nice. Holds up well. Nice taste with a smooth, refreshing feel. Good choice for a ""session""."
"pours a very clear light gold with a half inch white head that fades quickly and leaves no lacing. smell is slightly fruity with a pine hop scent also. taste slightly fruity and nice hop finish. mouthfeel dry crisp light. nice easy beer to drink with a good hop bite."
"Excellent beer. What a lager should be."
"I could drink an awfully lot of this beer."
"Again, this is not a beer that will smack you and tell you how great it is. In fact, it is not great. But on a Sunday afternoon, watching the Eagles lay waste to a really lame Redskins squad, it went quite nicely with the wursts and salads. So while it is more or less pedestrian, it's also very drinkable, flowing like the proverbial water, though with a more fun result. I won't seek it out, but short of other options, I wouldn't say no if it was offered."
"I suppose this is a decent session beer and good for a European 'macro'. This would probably not be my 1st choice of imports, but I do like it better than some mass-marketed European macros and sure beats the hell out of the majority of American mass-marketed beer."
"The taste was somewhat heavier than expected with a flowing sweet quality to it that marked the 50 liter barrel for certain emptiness by the end of the night. As it was one 4 barrels, I got back to it when it was half way done for a half cup which confirmed how refreshing it was."
"D- a very drinkable beer, could go through quite a few of these, Im really starting to appreciate the bottom fermented beverages of the world alot more"
"D: Went down reasonbly smooth. It really wasn't something I could have more than two of, but if you do like strong smelling malted lagers (the smell overpowered me) then this would be very agreeable"
"Nice & light and refreshing. Good summer drink."
"INteresting while dirnking it. Had it while having a break on a rehearsal. THe taste is hoppy more like a Pils, but it does not tires like it. The foam is white and thick. Good taste, great beer among those that are shipped to Mexico and remains. Bubbly, not too much and veyr enjoyable."
"Gold color light , clear  frothy thick white head nose is grains, grassy , cereal, hopps , malts , and clean - taste of malts , grainy , grassy , sweet corn , hopps , and hint of orange peel  dry light sweet mouth feel  skunky , cereal , bitter , grass , sweet corn aftertaste , short"
"Pours a golden color with tons of carbonation and a thick creamy head that seems to grow from all the bubbles rising up to the surface. Some dimples in the top of the head. Leaves some scant lacing. Sweet malts, sweet breads, and some grassy and floral hops in the nose. Has as crackery sweet malt that kind of washes away a bit thin and ends with some dirty hops flavors and bitterness. Eh. Feels a but too full in the mouth and kills the crispness it would have otherwise had from the carbonation. Wouldn't be opposed to another one nor would I look forward to another one."
"Eric"
"D - Crisp and refreshing, malty but not overly sweet. Easy to drink."
"On the whole I was disappointed by this beer. It's a cut above American macro lagers but has none of the complexity and depth that characterize Spaten's other offerings."
"Very drinkable. I will find this one again."
"Drinkability: A nice refreshing easy drinking beer. Good on one of the last days of summer with temps in the mid 80's after I finished mowing the lawn."
"D: Quite drinkable. Better than most lagers."
"Spaten Premium was golden in color and very clear. It had a fairly large white head with good retention and some lacing. It had a light malt aroma. The taste was slightly sweet at first, but is followed by the hops to balance out nicely, leaving a slight hop aftertaste. This beer is medium bodied and tasty. It would be very easy to drink several in a sitting."
"This is a nice beer to have when you just want to relax. Not at all demanding on the taste buds, just very crisp and smooth. A well balanced beer. I am impressed."
"Spaten Premium Lager pours a light golden color with a white head from a green twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is very mild, and has just the slightest amount of skunk. Taste is surprisingly good. A really well done lager, balanced to a tee. Very highly drinkable. Would make an excellent session beer."
"This beer poured a nice yellowish-gold in color and had a good 1"" head that was retained relatively well. The aroma was of malt and hops. The taste was very light, dry and crisp and extremely smooth. I detected some hops but not an overwhelming amount. The mouthfeel was thin, but not in a bad way, and had a good amount of carbonation. This beer was extremely easy to drink and very refreshing."
"Had this one at a golf club in the bar. I wasn't expecting much selection but they did have this one on tap. Wow was I surprised at how much I enjoyed it! Looks very ordinary. Pale golden lager with a slight white head. The taste was exceptional. Slighly sweet, grainy malt nicely balanced with hops. Very drinkable! I could have stayed all night. This is a good one for a session."
"Poured on tap from one of Portland's great places to find German Bier, Gustav's. Served in a tradional spaten logo bier stein. Bright white head that last most of the stein. Light yellow in color. Medium to light bodied. Well balanced hop flavor. Typical lager scents on the nose. Full rounded body and superb balance between hops and a malty sweetness. A great munich Helles."
"Man, this beer man, this beer. It is so freakin' tastey. A brainless drink, but man, does it ever taste good."
"D: If I had to have only one beer for the rest of my life I could settle on this. Overall this is a very drinkable beer through and through. This is the first legitamate German Beer that I have tired and it is exactly what I expected and then some. Very pleased"
"This is certainly the best Munich Helles Lager that I've had (and I've tried a fair number). Better than the other in every respect: looks better, smell and taste is more balanced and/or ""refined."" Easy and nice to drink for practically any occasion. This will definitely be on my next shopping list."
"A pilsener through and through. I bought this thinking it was a helles, which is what I was in the mood for. Still, quite good."
"Prosit! MK"
"This is one of the finest beirs on the planet, a monumental achivement."
"Excellent taste, nice smell, very good appearance and drinkability. Good balance among malt, yeast and hops. It worth a try, for sure."
"Drank very easy, super impressed that this stood up so well from its swim across the pond. Brings bak memories of a gasthaus we frequented in Garmisch (Spaten joint that was walking distance from the campground & had stellar food) Great summer time session bier"
"A great quaffable pilsener. Very drinkable."
"D - wow, very unimpressed with this offering from what I consider to be a great brewery. Love Optimator and love their Oktoberfest, but this 'traditional' lager leaves a lot to be desired - particularly the presence of any hops. Not sure if this beer is trying to be more of a pils or helles, but either way pass this by."
" Not a terrible beer, and I can see trying it on tap, particularly if I can back to Munich anytime soon but in the bottle it's mostly weak and uninspiring"
"All in all , a pretty good lager."
"So, yes, I could see getting this again and having it with pizza. The better choice to BMC and won't scare off non-BAs."
"Opinion: I am disappointed in the green bottle that these beers come in. This is a pretty tasty beer, and one that I am sure is better in Germany ""vom fass"". It has a meaty enough presence that it holds it own as a top-notch beer, but it isn't in the best of shape by the time it makes it over the ""big water"". I would like to try this beer fresh and on tap."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, especially on a hot day. Not my first pick to buy but I won't turn one down when offered. I have been to Germany many times and drank alot of beer. Even made the Octoberfest once. I wish I had written down each beer I drank. If I could have held a pen."
"Bottle pours a pale golden color with a finger width white cap. The cap dissipated with a thin lacings on surface and on sides. There is a constant uprising shower of tiny bubbles even from my basic pilsner glass. Smell is citrus hops and cereal maltiness. Just like the style should. Taste is basic German pils, but not quite as bold as I would like. Flavors do blend well, just light. A little on the watery side with medium level of carbonation. This is very smooth going down and refreshing. As I usually say about this style.... great ""burger and hot day"" brew!"
"Finishes of clean and very thirst quenching. Put some brats and burgers on the grill. This brew makes me think of summer."
"Mouthfeel is nice and clean, like a light beer should be. It has a nice clean balanced flavor that isn't biased; it's usually a little light for my taste, but is just right when I'm in the mood for something that won't fill me up."
"Man, was I disappointed when I got this from Beer Poker - $2.50 for whatever bottle they pull out at the Flying Saucer. My buddy got Rogue Dead Guy and another 60 Minute IPA - nobody would trade me. It could have been disappointment in poker but my general impression was this one was not impressive. A Dinkle Acker of Prima Pils is more my style, this one's a bit bitter, more of a Euro Lager in appeance and smell. Easy enough to drink but I won't pick this one again (but will probably play Beer Poker again)."
"Heres a clear pale, golden colored liquid with two-fingers of brilliantly white soapy foam. Lots of carbonation (just look at the endless upward march of bubbles), nice lace: attractive beer. Theres sweet malt in the nose, along with some vegetal characteristics and a grassy, herbal hop smell. Its not a powerful aroma, but it is pleasing, and much more appealing than most euro-macro lagers. The taste is composed of a nice malt flavor (pilsner) thats well balanced. The high carbonation gives the beer a spritzy quality that I could have done without. The finish has a mild shot of hop bitterness, along with a lingering semi-sweetness. Medium-light body. This is certainly a lot better than some of its direct competitors. Easy to drink and enjoyable."
"In my opinion, Spaten Lager is a refreshing light lager, which definitely leans more to German Pils (although Spaten also makes a Pils) than to Műnchner Helles. It is quite drinkable and definitely sessionable a great beer for a Mass Krug in the Biergarten on a nice summer afternoon."
"Overall: Easy drinking. It has been a couple years since Ive touched a Spaten, Im glad Ive revisited it."
"D - Very drinkable. Would recommend."
"Poured a perfectly clear straw-yellow into a pilsener glass, white foamy one and a half finger head fell to light lacing pretty quickly. Smells crisp, sweet, definite balanced hop and malt aroma present as well. Tastes as crisp and clean as it smells, very refreshing beer. Hints of citrus, then the hops come in, finishes with the balanced malt, no bitterness or alcohol bite present whatsoever. A definite session beer, goes down nice and smooth despite moderate carbonation on the tongue, but the crisp finish is absolutely remarkable. Would purchase again, a fine example of a German Pilsener from a fine German brewer."
"Mouthfeel was rather nice however. While somewhat thin, it was very smooth and mellow. A definite easy session drink. But overall, an average beer."
"I have a hard time picking out distinct flavors in lagers, but this one is pretty good, and it's definitely easy to drink. I just don't find myself as satisfied drinking this lager as a lot of Spaten's other brews, which I think are some of the best from Germany. Fizzy carbonation and a totally clean finish."
"It goes well with any food, which is a plus, and you can drink it year round. It will take the chill away in the winter and cool you down in the summer. Try it and you will be hooked."
"Pale yellow color with nice volume of dense white head. Smells of light grains with a bit of hoppy spice. Taste shows a similar blend of lightly sweet malts touched with a bit of crispness. The mouthfeel seems a little off--by no means unpleasant but somewhat ill-defined. Still, this beer goes down easily and is a good example of a style that, in general, I find uninspiring."
"Overall this is a fine lager and good for when you're looking for something good to drink on a hot day or when you don't want a really heavy hitter."
"A boring German pilsner, but then, I find the style boring in general, so I guess I should try to compare this to other pilsners I've had. A pretty average and follow-the-guidelines style beer right down to the smallest detail. Obviously its better than most American pilsners, and mostly the same as other European pilsners. Whew, there is just not much to say one way or the other about this one."
"I am quite surprised with this beer. I didn't really expect much, and it turned out to be something worth drinking. It is a good beer if you can't decide what to drink because it hits the spot without any extreme stuff going on. A person used to cheap beer may even like this because it isn't overly flavorful, but does have more than the junk beers. I recommend that both seasoned beer drinkers and those stuck on American lite beers. Try it!"
"Pours a pale straw, crystal clear. Bubbly two finger head with good retention and decent lacing. The floral hop aroma is strong, with background sweet malt. The pale munich type flavor upfront is faint but balanced well with bold noble hops. Spicy whole hop aftertaste that comes on strong, then gracefully fades. Light body and actively carbonated for a smooth mouthfeel with a very mild hoppy finish. A quality pilsener with no skunk character and high drinkability."
"I found it amusing that the label indicates this is ""malt liquor."" It also tries to make up for its mediocrity by playing the reinheitsgebot card."
"Overall - A very good lager... very drinkable... recommended..."
"drinkability: pretty drinkable"
"Spaten Premium Lager is good, solid beer. If there was any justice in the world, this kind of balanced, should-appeal-to-all flavor profile would be embraced by BMC as the blueprint for their standard lagers. Maybe then I could get some degree of enjoyment out of those occasions when I'm forced to drink their products."
"Pours a clear golden color with a nice white head on tap into 16oz pint glass. Grassy aromas and hops are present. Taste has a lot of grain present, nice crisp hops and a slightly sweet finish. Pleasant lively carbonation abounds. A very crisp and refreshing beer, highly drinkable. A good session beer or refresher on a hot day."
"This is my standard reference beer by which I measure all the others. Not one thing about this beer is outstanding but nothing is flawed either. Very drinkable and dependable beer choice that isn't that hard to find. I was surprised that I had not reviewed this beer yet when I noticed the omission."
"Definitly would not turn away, and are drinkable. Just nothing groundbreaking here in this German Lager. Other great Spaten Brews available."
"However, reading the description of the style i think it fits very very well... its spicy (""often times a bit coarse on the palate""). Definitly herbal and citrus like... so i give some point to that, not my favorite style though."
"Pours golden clear with a fine, thick whitish head that fades slowly. Citrus (grapefruit?) and grassy nose. Taste is bitter, hoppy, watery, and yet somewhat plain. Still, theres something there, and a good bitter finish. Mouth is more watery than Id like, but its pretty drinkable. Overall, a good pilsner, though not as good as some other Spaten offerings."
"It's just an average lager and I can find some domestic beers that are quite better than this one."
"A terrific thirst quencher. Looks a solid straw in color and crystal clear. Forms a fairly dense head that lingers at about 1/4"". Smells lightly malty, vegetal, herbal, and hoppy. Tastes lightly sweet; on the side of light honey or powdered sugar. Hop balance is present in the flavor and bitterness. This brings out an herbal character. Through the body, light apple flavors rise and remain through the finish. The body is medium and carbonated. Coats the mouth nicely without being buttery. Finishes crisply and suddenly without drying. Only mild hop flavors persist in the aftertaste."
"A very drinkable and thirst drenching brew."
"Appearance is translucent gold, a white head that leaves some lace. Aroma is of grasses and herbs, barley and malt. There is promise here that is not fulfilled  roasted malts and fescue, along with pungent, bitter hops. May be to the taste of some, but I will pass."
"Nice bronze colored pour with a foamy white head that's quite large and holds up well. Moderate lacing but not too much. Aroma begins really grassy but not really herbal. Some sweet honey notes come into the picture as well. Taste has a remarkable balance between the sweet grainy flavors and the grassy hoppy bitterness. But with that being said, the flavors aren't really anything too great. Soft almost weak. Begins more grassy and grows sweeter the further I go. Finish is a sweetness more than a dryness which is odd to me for this style. Decent beer, solid, rounded mouthfeel. Well crafted but nothing amazing imo."
"The bubbles are very lively in this pilsner's pale to gold body. The good sized white head sticks around to the last sip. It smells nice with cut grass and hop aromas. It has enough of that saaz bite to satisfy me. This beer isn't particularly complex, however it is very refreshing and very easy to drink. I picked this stuff up for a party at which no one drank and I'm happy to be stuck with it."
"Overall, I'm giving this a 3 for drinkability. I like it just fine for what it is, but I find it not really worthy of the price I paid for it, and I probably won't purchase it again anytime soon. If I find it on-tap, I'll probably give it another try, however."
"Drinkabilty- I like it but Im unfamiliar with the style. Not bad but I would not seek another at this time. Need to try more than revisit this one."
"Certainly one of the least offensive beers one could try, but simple in scope and complexity. Not a bad brew to offers noobies before moving them on to stouts. This one would certainly hit the spot after a heavy day of labor in the sun."
"Bright, clear, golden yellow body with a large, thick, off-white head. Smells of clean, honeyish malt with a pungeant, sea-air hop bouquet. Lean honey biscuit malt flavors up front--lightly sweetened. Snappy hop bitterness flashes. Finishes clean with lingering honey and light bitterness. Not bad. Light to medium bodied with a refreshing feel."
"Very light color and a decent pure white head. The less-educated folks at my table assumed that I was drinking some sort of domestic megaswill. They were, fortunately, wrong. A noseful of hops with some malt. Good taste with a hit of hops early and nice amount of sweetness. Nice, light, and crisp with ample carbonation. A bit astringent, but it comes with the territory. I'm not a huge hops fan, so the drinkability is hurt a bit by having to work through the initial taste. Still a quality brew and a proper representative of this genre."
"This beer pours a nice golden color with a brilliant pure bright white head. It appears to be very bubbly and highly carbonated. It smells of smellls of hops and seems kind of grainy. The taste is impressive, the bitter hops are pronounced well at first, yet not too overwhelming at all. Tastes great. The mouthfeel is great as well, it doesnt quite seem to have that light-bodied feel to it that I expected. Above average pilsener by my standards."
"Final Thought: Germany has the most drinkable mainstream beers with Spaten and Warsteiner leading, and Krombacher and Konig-Pilsener while in Germany itself."
"This is one of those beers that I could (and have) drink an insane amount of. I have more than once, after all, knocked out one of those 5 litre mini-kegs of this stuff by myself in 2 hours or so. This stuff pours a golden straw colour with a white foamy head that subsides after a few minutes. The nose is quite mild with pleasantly noticeable amounts of both hops and malt, though malt does seem to dominate. The taste of the beer is quite malty with a pleasantly bitter hops ""kick"" on the finish. Lack of huge carbonation makes this easy to drink and have a smooth mouthfeel. There's a ton of Beck's fans out there, but in my opinion, in the way of German lagers, Spaten is König."
"Despite the fact that I am not a big lager fan, I enjoyed this one and will most likely purchase it again."
"Balance is the key to a brilliant pilsener, and Spaten's Premium Lager has it. Beyond it's typically crystal-clear golden body and bright-white head lies a perfectly balanced combination of grassy and mildly spicy hops amidst a grainy and mildly sweet malt. It's nose is bright and welcoming with the hops and malt taking turns in appearance, but also working together to deliver a more concise presentation. The flavor follows along the same lines; and it's ""rich"" and exciting without being overly bold. It's malt is nicely grainy, and softly sweet with suggestions of Munich malts; and it acts as the perfect, supple, blanket on which to lay its grassy and spicy hop flavors. It's components are distinct, but always kept in check. Even it's bitterness is solid and clearly present, but not aggressively bold. This is a southern German pilsner that's balanced with a gentle hand and formulated for drinkability - and it succeeds!"
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a pale golden clear liquid. Thick white fluffy head. A few bubbles streaming from the bottom of the glass. Good head retention and lace. Pale maly, big grassy notes. Light bready malt flavor, good amount of grassy/spicy hops. Maybe slightly oxidized. Light body, high carbonation. Pretty crisp and clean. Good use of hops in this one, give it that ""German"" flavor."
"Fairly bland, with bitterness a bit low for the style. Nice aroma, though."
"I was given this beer by mistake, and got to try it for free. I found it rather ordinary for a German lager. It poured a pale yellow with a small white head that disappeared way too quickly. The aroma was pleasantly grassy with some hints of the malt. The taste is bland with nothing really presenting itself strongly. There was a mediocre malt base with a very slight hop finish. It was thin but cleansing in the mouth. I found that it went down quickly but not nearly as satisfying as the Franziskaner that I ordered."
"Sampled from a refrigerator sized mini-keg. I think it was about 5L in size. Instructions are clearly marked, but freshness date is some random numerical code. Color is golden straw, head isn't too big due to the small size of the keg spigot; I couldn't get the beer to come out fast enough to create good head. Smell is grainy with some typical German maltiness. Taste is nicely balanced, with grain taste paired with light malts. Maybe just a bit of lemon flavor. This is crisp and very drinkable. Another German beer in a long line that I enjoy."
"Very decent pilsener on tap at Clark's Ale House #2. Blond yellow with Nice head, foam and retained lace, smooth and crisp. Unoffensive easy drink. Spot of citrus lemon, refreshing. Malts so somewhat sweet and leads to bitterness in aftertaste. Better with stronger carbonation, have it on tap."
"Pours very clear and pale, huge head off the get go, but the head settled down quickly, but hung around. Smell of floral hops, taste is crisp at first, with a slight malty finish. Thick mouthfeel for style, aggresive carbonation. A very nice to style beer."
"I had this beer out of a 1-gallon keg. It poured golden, but with little head (I think this had to do with the way the tap worked and I was doing this at an akward angle). The aroma was sweet floral hops. The taste was where it was at though. When this sweet lager hit my taste buds, I was in Heaven. This beer was sweet, but not soda sweet. It was just the right thickness and coated my mouth well. Drinkability is high. This is a beer I could drink a lot of and it's just the right strength for that too. All in all a great German lager."

"Pours with a golden color and moderate head. The taste is very malty, with some lovely floral overtones. It's a very well balanced lager that goes down quite smoothly and deserves multiple offerings. It does have a strong malt flavor, which isn't for everyone, but I was pleasantly surprised."
"A fairly good lager, not anything special but has good level of drinkability"
"Drinkability  This Helles Lager is a bit rough around the edges but good and very drinkable. Its a classic."
"Pours translucent straw pils colored with a nice white head. Grainy malt aroma and a nice kettle hop bitter aroma, too. Fresh and clean smelling. Light sweet grain taste and a fruitiness that combines with the hops to come across as lightly citric. Carbonation is ample and enhances the overall experience on the palate. In my exploits of sampling loads of beer, sometimes it's nice to revert back to a beer that it reminiscent of what I drank in my teenage years, though this is way better than some of the swill I drank back then..."
"Very drinkable! Excellent for the style. I could enjoy a few of these. In fact, I think I will."
"Crystal clear and golden. Carbonation evident in the number of bubbles. Head is thick, with a grassy straw aroma. Almost buttery scent. Hops dominate taste, but come with a although heavy feel on the palate, are easily accepted. Not overly bitter at all. Floral hops shine in this one. There is just enough malt pushing through to give it balance. Overall, very crisp and well balanced beer."
"This beer came to me as quite a surprise, as it might to anyone who expected a typical, somewhat bland lager. Unique and very refreshing, a great summer beer"
"drinkability: very very drinkable..too drinkable... goes down like carbonated water...but is this a good thing...the only thing holding back its drinkability is that that taste becomes boring fast and starts to build up its boringness"
"This is a fairly good representation of the style, which almost tends to be unexceptional by definition. Nevertheless there's some elegance about it- any misstep in production or design would be immediately noticeable- and a nice seamless quality. It has a pleasantly restrained nose, slightly favoring the spicyness of the hops. It finishes soft and slightly malty."
"Poured a light straw color and clear. White head, leaves alot of wispy lacing. bready nose. Floral/grainy hops. Mild malt notes in the center. Light bodied, crisp and pleasant. Prickly carbonation on the tongue late. Quality lager, very nice in summer. Good session brew."
"Had a mini-keg of this at a little party tonight. It poured a medium gold color with a very nice white head that settled after about 5 minutes and left nice lace down my glass. The smell was quite malty with a very bread like scent overall. The taste was very smoothe and was largley dominated by a thick maltiness. Slight grain and apple flavors were there as well and pretty much no hoppiness to it whatsoever. The mouthfeel was quite flat, I'm thinking the mini keg might have gone flat or it was not tapped right or something. All in all it was a good easy drinking beer that went very well with the pizza and bean dip."
"I hadnt had this beer in a while, as I usually leery of green bottles. But BiermanVa left a couple over at my casa after a cook out and well Im not gonna let it go to waste. Pours a nice clear golden hue with a fluffy almost pure white head. Smell was crisp with the typical German lager hoppiness, with a bit of the sweetness of the malt coming through as well. Taste was clean and crisp, a bit of slightly sweet maltiness at first which was washed away by the nice crisp drying noble hops.. A bit prickly on the tongue with the carbonation, but still nice.. Very drinkable, I can see being able to suck these down with abandon on a hot summer day. I would certainly pick up a few of them this summer, especially in the 5 liter keg which cant get light struck."
"I did like this beer, even if it was a bit neutral and unexciting. Having a fresh sample probably did wonders for this beer. This beer can be used to wash down some wursts and spaetzle with no problem. As an average everyday beer, Bitburger might be a slightly better choice."
"Spaten lies between the German macros (like Becks and St. Paulie) and the world class pils/lagers (like Paulaner, Urquell, Bitburger, etc). Clean, smooth, crisp. Leans more towards the malt as opposed to the hops (appropriately for the style). Just doesn't quite have the body and overall flavor of the best lagers. This would always do, but I rarely buy it because there are better beers to be had for a similar price."
"Pours a bright straw gold color, that is topped by a white thick head. A spicy, grainy, sweetish, and grassy aroma wafts from my glass. The taste is clean, lightly sweet with some accompanying grain notes. This beer finishes with a bit of sharp bitterness, which is nice. There is a hint of apple in the taste. Pretty straight forward, half way decent beer. Would definitely be good on a hot day."
"Appearance: Golden straw color with a nice sized fizzy white head leaves behind healthy amounts of lacing served in a Spaten half liter mug. Aroma: Sweet grainy lemongrass tones with lightly toasted malts packing a nice gentle punch and the grassy herbal European hops do the trick here. Taste: Very clean tasting no ""skunky"" effect the draft really improves the flavor of this beer, sweet with a nice bitterness in the finish, session brew. Mouthfeel: Light bodied fizzy carbonation, mass produced but well done German helles. Drinkability: Nice and easy effortless beer don't think about just enjoy, meant to be drank in number."
"This is in my opinion a brew that is criminally underrated, true to the style, refreshing and tasty too. This is a well-rounded brew that, unfortunately, lacks the WOW character that we North Americans seem to crave in our beer. I'll admit that the straw-yellow color, standard, fizzy head and moderate lacing do little for me. The smell is warm and sweet with some serious fruit notes to round it out. Some hops lurk in the background but largely serve to make the aroma more complex. The taste is fine. Fruity and sweet and just slightly bready, with a nice mineral-rich aftertaste. Mouthfeel is great for the style, with rather high carbonation and a smooth, relatively thin body. Drinkability is tops, and I could see this being a top-notch session beer."
"Very clean and crisp in the mouthfeel, and an extremely clean finish as the bitterness fell off the tongue immediately. Carbonation levels were just right. Extremely drinkable as a lighter bodied beer, but one could get bored of this over time."
"If what you want is a simple thirst quencher clearly made from quality ingredients, or just a nice beer to keep around for guests accustomed to macro lager, this is certainly worth considering. I think I'll pour another one now."
"Probably a classic but just not a lot going on here for the long haul. Meant to be drunk quickly and cold. Classic dark yellow appearance with a tight white head that quickly disappates. Smell is mildly bready malt with Hallertau hop. Taste is a mild bread like a challah style with the tart Hallertau backdrop. Finishes clean and easy."
"For beers of this type I am not a huge fan. But if Im going to drink one, this is it. In this new land of extreme and huge beers, this beer is a perfect example of what can be accomplished in a simple beer."
"Pale straw color, active carbonation, and a creamy white head. Not much boquet, although you can smell a little bread and grass. Tastes light and malty, with not much hops backing. A semi-dry finish makes this an above-average beer. Not that great compared to Optimator, though."
"Drinkablility: The standard bearer for ""yellow"" beers"
"The head was as white as a models teeth. Dissapeared quickly back into the clear golden liquid where it originated. Sweet malt and skunky hops make up the faint aroma. There's more carbonation than flavor in this beer. It tastes the same as it smells. Not a bad beer, just not a whole to it."
"Notes: A tad grainy for my tastes..."
"paid $5.99 for a 6er."
"Drinkability: If this DMS doesn't bother you, then it's rather drinkable. I'd probably drink it if someone bought it for me, but that's about it."
"Came out clear gold under a big slightly off-white contoured head that left excellent lace down the glass. The nose is mildly malty with, unfortunately, a touch of soap. The mouth is prickly and light, as it should be. The flavor features a good light malt followed by a nice hoppy bite in the finish. The aftertaste combines the light malty sweetness with a hoppy bitterness, making you long for the next sip. Good stuff."
"Pours out to a bright golden in the glass with a slight, very white head. Aroma is that of a light lemon and grass. The taste is very Euro-lager and is quite good. This could be an easy session beer to sit back with during a sporting event on the tube."
"I liked this beer. I gave it an average on appearance because I drank it straight from the bottle this night. I have had it before in a pub but cannot remember it or much else from that night. It has a slightly wheaty-malt aroma with good rich hops. The taste was very crisp and refreshing and mellows excellently as it warms up. It has a sweet and malty taste and feels great going down the throat. I found it very drinkable. It was easy to drink even at the end of a night of moderate partying."
"After the Oktoberfest and the Optimator, I was disappointed."
"Light gold color, small white foamy head. Aroma is grainy and sweet. A light bodied lager. Slightly hoppy and mildly malty. Nice flavor, somewhat fruity. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Light and refreshing"
"Being a big Optimator fan, I thought this would be a nice surprise....well, it was. It was less than great. The color, aroma and head all seemed to fit into the lager arena, but the taste left me wondering if they mistakenly bottled their weisse beer in the lager bottles? I mean, the flavors of wet grain and grass were there, and it just took me by surprise. Not much in the way of hops, and the malt is present in small doses. Ah well, one of these is STILL infinitely better than a case of anything made by A-B..."
"Very easy going down, and could make a good session brew. Not a lager fan, but this one seems right on, for flavor and drinkability."
"Served in a half liter Malles Munich Mug and had a bright golden color. It started out a little grainy, but the hops were evident towards the end. The mouthfeel was smooth for this light-bodied beer and it went down pretty easy. Smoothness leads to a great drinkability for this beer"
"John"
"On the palate it is decidedly firm, with a solid cold grip of baked grain and mineral. Easy malty sweetness reigns over the soft, bubbly mousse...the only structural check offered, as there is no acidity or burnt bitterness to speak of. Perhaps a little top heavy or ""soapy"" but a lovely little lager nonetheless."
"Poured medium head with fine-small bubbles that quickly dissolved. There was not much lacing with this brew. There was carbonation observed rising to the top. It had a fruity, citrusy aroma to it. It was a thin and watery brew. The body was a light yellow. This brew reminded me too much of American mass-produced beers. This was disappointing."
"Notes: One of the originals and some what underrated in my opinion, this brew has no problem pairing with a plate of knock and bratwurst with a tangy kraut and some German potato salad."
"My green bottle wasn't skunked, but I think there are tastier versions of this out there, slightly drier, hoppier, and with a bit more bite in the taste. Pat"
"This is one of the classic world beers. A helles is the highest measure of Bavarian brewing skills. Subtle and nuanced, any flaws are readily apparent. I would love to drink this fresh in Munich."
"This brew pours a medium head of fine to medium sized white bubbles and a transparent straw yellow lager colored body. It has a hoppy aroma with a fizzy initial, burp, taste and a hoppy slightly bitter acidic flavor that lingers well after it finishes. It left only a fair lacing. I expect better from Spaten the maker of one of my favorite Doppelbocks, but a s a lager, if you like them this one is just OK."
"I originally had Spaten a few months ago at a local beer bar. The other night, while browsing a 6-pack place, I noticed for the first time the dignified yet cool symbol of the shovel on the sixer of Spaten. I was sold. It poured a clear, bright gold color, with just a bit of lacing and noticeable carbonation. There was a nice sharp hop smell, with a lingering malt foundation. I also noticed a grassy, almost fruity odor, and thankfully no skunk. The taste was very crisp and mildly sweet, but the nice hop addition adds some nice citrus characteristics after the swallow. The mouthfeel was pretty average and lighter than expected. Easy drinking with a pleasing smell and taste, Spaten is a very reliable and honest import. This sixer went down very quickly...it had to be the shovel."
"My friend decided he did not want this bottle because it said ""malt liquor"" on the front and I was more than happy to relieve him of it(wink wink). Bah, another green bottle! Oh well. It poured a light, pale, yellow without too much head and not very much carbonation apparent. The smell had contrasting sesations; first there was a shap(hallertau??) hop aromoa which cut through the more malty honey/flowery smell. The taste was sweet and thin up front, buttery and full bodied malts dominated the middle, which receded back to the sweet taste and finished with a hoppy(little bit skunky) bitter aftertaste. Vey decent beer."
"Pours a clear golden color with a thin, yet lasting head. A smell that is somewhat skunky with some malts to be noted. The initial onslaught of rich and grainy hops are noted, followed with a creamy and grassy tasted. The clear green bottle leaves a bad impression on an average beer; not much to write home about."
"Drank this one in Venice, Italy. I'm wondering if this is the same beer as the Munchner Hell renamed for the export market? Clear, light golden with a light white head atop small to medium sized bubbles, with moderate to poor retention and nice lacing. Carbonation is moderate. Aroma is crisp and delicate with extremely clean ferment, freshly cut hay and distantly husky, sweet munich or carapils malt. Hops are minimal. Mouthfeel is brisk, wet, and crisp with a light to medium body and a sparkling character upon the tongue. Taste begins with some delicate earthy flavor hops up front, followed by husken pale malts, giving way to a well-balanced smooth, earthy bitterness with a lightly astringent husken character in the finish. A well-made delicate and pleasant brew."
"An easy-drinking eurolager that doesn't challenge, but is slightly above average for the style."
"I liked the nice gold color to it medium sized head wich left a good lace that stayed for quite awhile.Very grainy,sweet minerally aroma very malt accented.Pretty clean tasting a hint of hops in the finish,a little thin in the mouthfeel department though.A pretty good lager better than the American giants but not as good of its European partners."
"Dazzlingly clear straw gold color with a large white head, decent carbonation, and lots of sticky lace. Aroma carries a slightly sweet bready note as well as mild hops, completely free of lager skunk, probably due to the brown glass bottle. Taste begins with a moment of sweetness, followed by solid malt flavors, finishes with lingering mildly bitter citrus hops. The finish is clean and a bit dry. Mouth feel is quite smooth and full, good for the style; the soft carbonation imparts only the slightest tingle. This beer is another textbook example of German brewing quality."
"The smell: lagerfonk-o-rama! Some bready grains.The front is lagerfonk with nice grains. The middle is metallic, some malt, sweetish. The finish is nicely bitter, but a little metallic. The fonk and metal definitely tame as the beer warms. Overall, this is a decent beer."
"Poured yellowish-golden with a thin, inconsistent head. Turned off by the smell, as it almost had a skunky characteristic. Can't say the taste was anything special either. It had a bready texture with more of a floral finish. Fortunately, it was very smooth going down. I expected better things, as I am typically a big fan of the Spaten line."
"pours out a clear golden color with a fluffy one inch head which stuck quite nicely, leaving a nice lace down the glass. sweet malt and grain aromas, a bit of lemony hints with light hoppiness around the edges. light tastes of sweet grain, lemony malt...not really in the typical euro-lager fashion. more like a good quality american lager/pilsener rather than mimicking the euro style. rather light bodied. a hint of spiciness to the hops. clean and crisp finish. despite the green bottles, i neither smell nor taste any skunk. spaten premium comes off as a clean and non-descript easy drinking euro-lager. probably quite average in comparison to others within it's style, but easy drinking nonetheless."
"Very easily to drink could see this as a good summer BBQ beer if i had the cash!"
"The medium-light body has a light, but rounded maltiness and a crisp, but faint bitterness from the hops. VERY little hop flavor. Smooth and sweet--this is a beer I've used to convert several macro guys to better beer. My complaints with it are that it's slightly too foamy and that it leaves a slight sourness in the finish, which lingers unpleasantly. I've had this beer on draft at the Bavarian Grill, where they seem to take good care of their beers, and it's better there--firmer and less prone to souring on the finish. Someday I'll try it in Munich and have a definitive answer :)"
"Blinding gold, ultra translucent, small white head, poor retention, decent lace. Slightly hay-like, grassy, very quiet spiciness, the malt is solid but ultimately an unimpressive nose. Very tasty palate, grassy-hay, a murmur of peppery-spice, decent malt undertones, slightly crisp... refreshing. Simple and light pleasant mouthfeel, easy to drink and enjoyable. Id recommend it for a cross-over beer or for hot summer days. While this is not the best Helles lager, Spaten Premium is a decent and enjoyable beer."
"As I always beat on lagers and pilsners, I must own up to finding this one quite pleasant to quaff, as fair is fair and it deserves my praise. Bright gold color as it sets in the glass with a spacious frothy white head and as it dissipates, leaves a fine covering sheet of lace to cling mightily to the glass. Sweet tones first, then malt, with a light earthiness to end the nose. Malt start, with the top light and fresh, the finish smacking in its acidity, hops apropos to the style, dry as a desert bone aftertaste, and just plain refreshing."
"Pours a ultra clear very pale yellow with a 3-finger head that shrinks to a nice lumpy layer. The smell reveals an earthy grain with black pepper spicing. The taste is a lightly sweetened malt of earthy tones and the hops that are in the aromas are not apparent in the taste. Very, very mild hopping...perhaps under-hopped. It is a very pleasant taste despite the lack of bite. It is a light bodied brew with just a light sticky-sweet mouthfeel and drinkability is quite high for this one. Prosit!"
"Agreeable, yet remarkably average. But there is nothing here to criticize. If US macros were anything like this, I'd still drink them."
"Pours a pale yellow color with a thin white head. Slightly hoppy aroma. Taste is crisp and refreshing with notes of sweet malts and bitter hops. A pretty average beer but a definite step up from the macros."

"An average looking beer with a clear golden color and moderate, short-lived head.  The aroma was hops laden with just a hint of malt.  The flavor was slightly off (victim of the green bottle syndrome), but the high hop content and slight malt finish were refreshing.  The good carbonation and long-lasting flavor upped the mouthfeel.  An easily drinkable beer that would be better if fresher.  I anticipate more samplings of this style."
"This beer poured a light gold color and formed a nice white head that left some lace.  Some light carbonation present. The aroma was of hops and touch of lemon.  The flavor was of hops and a little lemon.  The finish was a bit astrigent and had a bit of citrus to it.  Not bad for a session beer, but there are better ones out there."
"Quite OK with me. Very pale yellow colour, small head and little lasting, sweetish maltiness, medium bitterness. Highly drinkable, fruity flavour, not too bad in the end."
"I think I'm buying greenies by the case from now on."
"Very light appearence with whiter than white head. Sweetish tasting but the malt profile is somewhat lacking in flavor. Goes down easy with a creamy mouthfeel. Finish is crisp with a little hop flavor and almost no bitterness. A good alternative to American macroswill."
"This was a good average lager. Not much head. Tasted very similat ro Stella Artois which I quite like. A very drinkable beer. Like a German Budweiser buy MUCH better."
"quality munich lager. goes down great, a bit light and very smooth. it is not up there with the hacker-pschorr, but it is a fine example of a good german brew"
"Clear yellow-gold color, 1/4 inch head in a Pilsner glass that's decently persistent.  Slightly nutty aroma.  Light-bodied, malt is unobtrusive but hops are well balanced and lend just a touch of crispness.  No annoying skunk.  Pleasant finish, a little honey sweetness.  I was looking for more grain or nut characteristics.  Not a ton of memories here but a very drinkable beer."
"Golden yellow in color, with highly carbonated fizzy white head. Bitter hop smell mixed with some malty sweetness, made smell like beer. Taste was somewhat malty and sweet, but the bitterness lingered to long, and was off. Too bitter to be balanced. Light to medium bodied. Easy to drink, but not a beer to really go back to for a while......."
"A very nice example of what a German brew is and should be. It is very refreshing and aromatic at the nose. From the very inital sip to the very last, it is extremely consistent and user-friendly. The head is light, yet still lightly omnipresent. The aroma of the earthy malt and hops are a fantastic match with all foods German, particularly with pork and sauerkraut. Well worth seeking out! Prost!"
"Gold in color, malty slightly sweet nose.  White head.Very smooth malty feel in the mouth.  Some hop nobility.  Not very good head retention.  Slightly above average for the style.  This was a dissapointment taste wise.  Not really alot there to comment on..."
"One of the basic fine German lagers.  Always available, reliable (unless it has been sitting to long in the store).  It has a nice golden color with white head.  Crips tasting, with lingering bitterness, but with enough smoothness for balance.  It a beer for everyday consupmtion.  Maybe this is the mass-produced version of German Bud, but at least it is good."
"Spaten Premium:  Very nice example of the classic German taste.  Pale golden beer with a pure white head.  The aroma reminded me of skunk, but the taste of the beer was anything but.  Sweet taste, with a pleasant sour follow through and a hoppy dry, absolutely clean finish.  Very nice and very drinkable."
"Above average for an American Beer, slightly below average for a German brew.  Moderatly malty with a slightly hoppy aftertaste. Goes down pretty smooth.  What middle-age, balding men from Germany drink after mowing THIER lawn."
"Light lager. Nice thicker than expected head. Not too intrusive but doesn't lack character. Could go well with a meal I suspect but I had it alone. Reminds me of wonderbread on the nose."
"On tap this is a fine refreshing lager. Bread like aroma, puffy off white head. Sturdy malt backbone balanced by a welcome spicy hop flavor. Good for washing down a meal or alone as a thirst quencher."
"Nice fluffy white head, frothy, initially head takes the larger part of the glass, then mostly diminished in a few seconds. Body is light white gold, or platinum in color, or as I say spaten-num. The aroma has very light malt & hop notes/ herbs & grain smell. Flavor is lightly sweet. Finish is moderately bitter. It has over the top carbonation. Overall a very drinkable brew, and surely a change of pace as far as lagers go."
"First surprize came, when I poured it into my glass.  Very white, like champagne, the head was thick and creamy. Most of the emphasis is on the malt.  A few raw barley notes.  Crisp bite at start, creamy aftertaste.  Don't enjoy many lagers, but this one is special.  Delicious!"
