"This is one of the best lagers I've ever had. It's so unique and tasty."
"If you are looking for a meaty smoke you'll have to go elsewhere, this is more of a good campfire smoke.  Not overpowering, but definitely present.  As with most decent beer, let it warm a bit if you are pulling it out of a typically cold fridge."
"The outstanding flavor profile is intense, a bit complex and very well balanced.  It begins with a mixture of flavors that slowly separate into a mild oak like smokiness over a subtle sweet biscuit.  In the middle, it becomes rather crisp and becomes dryer towards the finish.  A slightly bitter smokiness lingers."

"Lighter take, with less alcohol, on a helles lager."

"Excellent and I would drink this happily every day.  Clean, crisp, lightly sweet and full of enough flavor to keep you interested glass after glass."
""
""
"The best of both worlds - a lager with a wonderfully light and smoky flavor. This is the real deal."

"Perfect carbonation"

"You can tell that a lot of time and skill went into this brew. Funnily enough a slight tea flavour, not at all out of place real complement"
"O) Superb.  So much going on here and at 4.3% gives the lie to the theory that high ABV always means more flavour."

"I have had this beer several times now since my original review and I'm consistently impressed by it.  Each time I pop one open it's like having it for the first time.  A beer I could just drink endlessly.  I'm increasing my ratings for taste and overall for each as I really can't see this beer improving in those aspects."
"An interesting twist to the style.  The smokeless smokiness gives it a grunge, homemade vibe.  This is probably not their best offering but it does make me want to keep an eye out for their real smoked beers."

"Price Point - $5.69/16.9 oz bottle"

"Interesting taste of subtle smoke paired with lager-style freshness. It's unique to create a rather light lager beer with so much flavor. Compared to the original ""Aecht Schlenkerla"" this is the best solution because you will be able to enjoy a toned down smoke flavor with a not so heavy beer. It is unfortunate that it costs me $5.99/bottle here in San Francisco, whereas it costs $1 in Germany."

"Never had a smoked helles before, it was interesting, although with a few off notes. I guess Schlenkerla are really great at crafting dark liquid bacon, but this helles was a bit of a let down."

"O: Its amazing that this beer isn't talked about more. It has great balance, it's refreshing, crisp, packed with flavor, and 4.3% abv. Doesn't get much better."
""
"O: was hoping for a bit more out of this, considering how wonderfully flavorful some of their other beers are.... the low level of smoke flavor wasn't necessarily a bad thing.... come to think of it, the last time I had a bland Schlenkerla on tap (the Lent beer) it was at Brauhaus, hmmm..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Good Lager with just a touch of smoke, I think it could use more, but its quite refreshing."
""
"That said, this beer sucks. The smoke over powers the already soft flavor of the helles. This was a drain pour for me"
"Very interesting stuff. A clear, light Bavarian Helles with fine and firm head. The subtle smoke aroma makes this a unique beer. Much more drinkable than the Schlenkerla Rauchbier. Malty and satisfying finish, considering it’s relatively low alcohol level."
"Decent helles with an elegant smokey touch. But don’t expect bacon or any heavy ash smokness, and you will be fine."

"O- very nice."
"O - A solid Helles, and a good representation of the style. I still think there are better Helles', but this is absolutely worth a try. Crisp and clean with a mild fruity and hoppy taste, could be an excellent session beer. Highly recommended to lager fans."
"Pours a fairly clear medium golden color with a decent sized bubbly white head that slowly dissipates to a ring on top. Rich sweet caramelized pilsner malt dominates the aroma. Rich dried fruit, prunes and raisins come to mind. Non existent hop aroma. Lightly spicy and almost smokey component shows up in the aroma as well. The flavor is rich with lots of caramelized sugary maltiness and plenty of dark dried fruits. There is a hint of herbal hop flavor and a bit of sweet cardboard. Medium body with a fairly dry finish. Moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. Love the aroma here, but the flavor suggests this bottle my be less than fresh. One day I will make it over the ocean to try some great lagers the way they were meant to be drunk!"
""
""
"Overall: A traditional, well done Munich Helles in many ways, but with a watered-down character that keeps it from making a truly positive impression."
"overall one of the better lagers out there. recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am still not convinced of the smokey flavors but I do think this is a nice beer and good for pairing with BBQ or any smoked food. It is a refreshing thirst quencher and sessionable like any other Helles. This beer definitely gots its place in the world and I might come back to it."
""

""
""
"This is a fantastic beer. I love smoke side that this beer adds to already well made beer. If this was a bit more reasonably priced, I would drink it more. I can definitely see why this gets brought to Torst and Proletariat in NYC."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
""
"Overall (4.25): This is a nice beer, well-crafted and on point for the style. The little bit of smokiness towards the end gets washed away if you’re not careful, but if you pair it with food it gets more noticeable and offers a very nice, unique edge that definitely sets it apart from the field. Very nice, subtle, well-crafted, and refreshing."
""
"Overall, an odd but strangely tasty beer. I'd label this a gateway for getting into smoked beers, because while it doesn't actually use smoked malts, they boil it in the same kettles and use the same yeast as the other smoked beers, so the smoke element is very much there. However, it's not overpowering, and so very approachable."
""
""
""
"An extraordinary German lager that hits all the style marks in excellent fashion. Well-balanced combines with nice, low-key complexity throughout. I've always liked their smoked beers and was hoping their helles lager would provide similar satisfaction. I was not disappointed and would recommend this beer to anyone without hesitation."
""
""
""
""
"This beer is so fundamentally simple yet executed so admirably. Drinkability is insanely high - I couldn't get enough of this beer. You can bet that I'll be picking this one up from now on, every time I'm looking for something to sit back and relax with. Definitely one of the best lagers I've had to date, especially considering the helles style. It opened my eyes to what helles lagers could taste like."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A very nice Helles. Good flavor for low ABV. Wouldn't be a go-to for me but would enjoy it again."
""
""
"This is a world classic for me. An outstanding hell in its own right, with a lovely hint of smoke to complement it. Everything is done in perfect balance here. And having had it at the brewery, and at home in Australia - it travels very well (Pheonix beers are good importers)."
""
"O: A solid helles lager with a nice smokiness to it. The smoke is more of a supporting role than anything else (especially compared to their other beers) and keeps things interesting. Very easy to drink and easy to find. Worth a purchase"
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a great beer."
""
""
""
"A delightful lager, full of flavor and with a unique and subtle flavor twist. Wonderful!"
"Beer is medium to medium-light in body with moderate to moderate-low levels of carbonation. The resulting mouthfeel is generally smooth and passes gracefully along the palate, with a light fizziness and foaminess due to the carbonation. Closes quite dry, the feel being rather astringent, actually."
"Enjoyable. A lager with some gentle smoke to it."
""
""
""
"Edit: So apparently this beer is known for having a smoky flavor. I had no idea. Still, pretty nice brew."
"Smells vaguely of Caribbean lagers which was offputting. However tastes like a campfire and had fantastic mouthfeel. For something with such smoky qualities I was surprised not to see that on the label. (Although my translation skills are nonexistent or very close to it.) Greatly enjoyed this beer and although I don't look for lagers, would buy this beer again when in the mood. Great work peeps across the pond!"
"A very nice medium to light bodied Lager, very drinkable and a fine specimen of its category!"
""
"D- Didnt look appetizing at all after a few minutes. Aroma and taste left little to be desired. No smoke character as hoped for. Just a standard helles on the sweeter side of the malt spectrum, even for Franconia. Disappointed."
""
""
"Poured into a glass mug. Pours pale golden with a white head. I can see a few tiny streaming bubbles. The aroma is of smoky and pale roasted malts. The taste follows the nose. The good malt profile has the right balance of smokiness to make the taste. The body is light with moderate carbonation. The finish is crisp. The drinkability is very high. This is an excellent beer. I just wish the bottle caps weren't on so tight because this destroyed my bottle opener."
""
"Almost medium bodied with a tart, sharp carbonation up front. Dry, clean finish. Sadly, I've got nothing to recommend in this beer. That's disappointing considering how much I've liked the other four Schlenkerla brews I've had prior."
""
"O: When I bought this beer, I built up hopes of what it would taste like. After drinking two other of the brewery's smoke beers (both very good), this is a welcomed departure and a pleasant drinking experience. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
"Taste is Nice helles with grain, bread, herb, apple, lemon, mineral with light smokiness again coming on before the finish. It has aftertaste of light grain, herb, apple."
""
"It's nice to try a smoked lager, but eh, I don't see the appeal in buying more than one bottle ever. Whereas the brewery's smoked Marzen and Weizen are a little thicker and can stand up to the smoke, I think in some ways the smoke gets in the way of the lager properties. I usually go for a lager as a lighter, more refreshing option. The smoke kills that. I'm trying to be objective with my scores, because I appreciate the uniqueness."
""
"This beer pours a light bodied and very clear bright gold in color with a two finger bright white head. The nose is trademarked pale German malt with a touch of smoke. Hey oh! I've had all of Aecht Schlemkerlas other beers but didn't expect any smoke from their Helles for some reason. The touch of smoke is a nice surprise. The flavors are crisp and clean. It features typical pale Munich malt and again has that touch f smoked malt. It definitely makes this one unique. It drinks light in body and is very easy to sit down and drink. I like it a lot. For anyone who is a fan of German lagers this s a must try."
""
""
""
""
"Sampled in a Hobgoblin Tumbler..serious lol. This pours with a rich white head, very slightly hazy deep yellow liquid in the glass. Nose is of bready malt and the subtle hint of smokiness...very appealing to my sense of smell. The taste is superb, a complex blend of subtle smoke, malt and hops. Finishes long and hoppy with the smoke cutting thru. This is a fantastic and unique Helles, I doubt I've had better. A gem!"
""
""
""
"Half litre bottle, golden colour, clear, large head which soon disappeared. Aroma had notes of apple, Saaz hop and a hint of smoke. Tasted apple and a hint of smoke, had the spicy sweetness of Oktoberfest beers. Smooth texture, medium body, light carbonation. Overall a very refreshing beer, the smoke was understated but really gave it some depth that defied the 4.3abv."
""
""
""
"D - A balanced and drinkable Bavarian lager, but with a very subtle touch of smoke that takes it to another level of complexity. Really nice, up there with the best of Schlenkerla."
"500 ml bottle. Served in a pilsener glass, the beer pours a clear straw gold color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. The brew smells like grain/bready malt, apples, bananas, smoke, pears, and a bit of herbs. The taste is just like the aroma from what I can tell, I don't notice anything different between them. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick and smooth and easy enough to drink. I think it's a good overall beer, although I do prefer their smoked brews. But I'd buy this one again, I liked it."
""
""
""
"Overall, I found this a little disappointing, even though it's a decent beer overall. It's a reasonable example of a classic style, but there are slight fractures to it which don't really move it off-kilter enough to be interesting."
"500 ml bottle into pilsener glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly cloudy golden straw color with a nice 2 finger dense white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a thick cap that lingers. Some nice lacing on the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming up retaining a dense head. Aromas of big pepper, bread, light smoke, apple, pear, herbal spiciness, floral, and a light metallic off note. Some pretty nice and balanced aromas with decent strength. Taste of pear, pepper, apricot, apple, grass, biscuit, floral, cracker, toasted grain, and herbal spiciness. Fairly dry on the finish; with some lingering notes of pear, apricot, grass, toasted grain, earth, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a short bit. Very nice and well balanced flavors. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a slightly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel. Alcohol presence is essentially non existent as expected of 4.3%. Overall this is a really nice, smooth, and balanced Munich Helles lager. It probably wasn’t very fresh, but it was still very enjoyable."
"O- Nice lager with some smoke. Smoke not as prevelant as other Schlenkerla beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"I could easily drink a liter or more of this. Refreshing and flavorful. Well done."
"That off-flavor killed it for me. I really wanted to love this beer as much as their rauchbier. Don't get me wrong, I'd drink this again. I enjoy it enough to seek out every once in awhile. I mean, it's still just a helles lager. I love both big and little smoked malt qualities, and this one satisfies that thirst of mine, but it's not without its own big flaw. Have to give it a 3.5"
"Although the beer itself doesn't use any smoked malts, it's brewed using the same yeast and in the same equipment as their other smoked beers. Pretty interesting beer pours a pale light golden delicate biscuit malt character with a nice spritzy carbonation level. Nice fluffy white head leaves intricate banded lacing. Aroma has a subtle smoke character with hints of smoked meats and a light biscuit malt grain character. Flavor has an interesting smoked nuttiness to it adds great complexity to a light classic well executed German helles. Kind of a one note flavor but a very interesting and tasty one note, makes me wish I had another bottle or two. Mouthfeel is evenly carbonated with a light but not watery body. Overall impression this beer rates high with on my likeability skill, would I consider sharing this with other friends into beer? Absolutely a very interesting take on a German Helles a classic style that doesn't get a whole lotta love around these parts."

"Pours a clear golden color with a 2 inch puffy off-white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Thin foamy rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt and slight smoke aromas. Taste is of malt with a slight smoke flavor and some herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good lager that retains some of the traditional smoke aromas and flavors without being in your face."
"Quality helles lager here. If you enjoy a subtle twist on this traditional Munich style, then grab a bottle of this."
"Drinkability – Lagers typically go down easy. Since this is the best lager I’ve tried, it goes down that much easier. My local beer store sells this by the keg; this could be a dangerous drink for a big party."
""
""
""
"Pretty cool little number here: smooth, velvety lager with some restrained flavors & just a little twist there."
"Mouthfeel is very smooth, a little tingly, very light body and very drinkable. Unfortunately I've already finished the bottle : (. At such a low alcohol content and such high flavor content, you'll want to drink a lot of this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clean pale yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, lemon citrus and a small smoke presence. In the taste, a light lager with notes of lemon citrus and a nice smoke. A small smoke bite and a lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry smoke in the aftertaste. A bit thin and the smokiness is a bit faint."
""
"O: On the whole, this is an average and forgettable beer. Not very interesting."
""
"A truly unique and interesting beer. i could see myself drinking a lot of this if I lived in Bamberg."
""
"Poured a hazy gold with a soapy white head. Aromas of smoke, light, crisp malt, and some grassy hops. Taste is similar to the nose, slightly meaty smoke, crisp malt, honey, and toasted grain. Finish is long-lasing and bitter, and smacks nicely of smoke. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, very drinkable despite the advertised 6.5% ABV (BA says 4.3%, not sure which is correct). Overall a nice intro to Schlenkerla, but give me the Marzen or Urbock any day!"
"O - A solid beer with hint of the classic smoke. Very enjoyable."
""
""
"The Rest: Medium bodied; A pretty tasty Helles with some additional character from the smokiness."
"D - Piecewise, I'm not impressed, but all together this beer is pretty nice."
""
""
"This brew is a first for me and it pours a slightly hazy honey hue which leaves a two finger head that stays and a nice rim of lacing,the smell is honeydew,the slightest tinge of smoke but its there and cold meats,the mouthfeel is just over lightbodied,dry and thirst satisfying the taste has the honeydew and slight smoked malts along with a touch of rockmelon and a everpresent herbal hop grassiness without the bitterness and overall its no standout beer but a bloody great session beer and could see this as one of my session staple beers for the Summer cheers."
""
"O - While this is a decent Rauchbier this is like the Bud Light of Schlenkerla's lineup definitely a gateway to the bolder Rauchbiers out there so I think just about anyone could drink this worth picking up to try if you see it around"
""
"The beer had a light feel to it, exceptionally smooth and easy to drink. Overall, this is a simple beer that is exceptionally well done. This one will be in my beer fridge more often."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a nice beer. It goes well with my hamburger and fires. The flavor profile is simple but it does have that nice Aecht Shlenkarla smokey flavor. I would drink this again."
"Overall an interesting, unique, and enjoyable German lager. The aroma is a bit underwhelming, but the interesting balance of flavors makes up for it."
""
""
"Notes: Easy drinking with a nice, light smoke angle to set it apart. The more you drink it the more you'll appreciate the subtleties. As it says on the bottle its not made with smoke malt, so be warned its not a typical Schlenkerla brew."
""
""
""
""
"CHEERS!!"
"I do like this beer but I feel it falls somewhat short of the other offerings from this brewery. It is not a whole lot different than many other german lagers."
"D: im definitely a sucker for smoke, but i think all would agree this is a very well made beer. highly quaffable."
"More hay and grainy, bready malt as flavours, along with spicy hops and some just noticeable woody smoke. Finishes with an assertive bitterness that then settles down to reveal some caramel."
"500 mL bottle from K&L. Pours a clear light gold with a mountainous white head that lasts forever. Aroma is smokey - not like roasting a pig over a campfire, a la the other Schlenkerla beers - but definitely reminiscent thereof. Subtle notes of Christmas ham along with the more typical melanoidin character. Flavor isn't as smokey as the smell. Bigger emphasis on the base beer character, with Cheerios-esque malts and a lightly sweet, grainy finish. There is a vague note of woody smoke throughout but it's never at the fore. Lovely heft to the body, not too watery nor too sweet and fatiguing. Really hits the spot."
"It has a dark straw color with a nice white head and lace. The aroma is a little milder than their other beers. The smoke is the dominant flavor and scent but there are hay and citrus esters. The body is heavier than most traditional lagers. It has a light body but a rough finish due to the smokiness."
"Overall, a good beer not to heavy in smokiness so it's perfect for some looking to try his/her first smoke beer."
"O - Highly sessionable lager. Very suitable for a hot day out in the sun, but there are more affordable options available."
"Overall: Though not containing any smoked malts, the tanks holding this beer also are used to ferment all of the Aecht Schlenkerla Rauch line. Being a smoked beer fan, I find this a very fine lighter option, with a more delicate, but still prominent smoke flavor."
"Overall: Very good beer overall. The smoke enhances the flavor instead of dominating it. I would definitely recommend this one."
"O- A quite complex lager, with a rich amount of perfectly balanced flavours and an amazing drinkability. Maybe just a little less refreshing than other bavarian Helles"
"One of the more interesting helles lagers I’ve tried."
"I like this beer. Like everything I've had from Brauerei Heller Bamberg, it's well-crafted and solid. Nothing exciting or flashy here, but if you want a good, crisp beer look no further."
"O- very tasty and refreshing,just a touch of smoke with milod hops and sweet malts"
"This beer is great. Period."
"D: Very drinkable. Crisp, refreshing and fairly light with good malt character. Mils smokiness is really nice."
"D - Brauerei Heller-Trum Schlenkerla. Remember the name. Every beer I've had from them has been nothing shy of delicious. Add this one to the list of great beers they brew."
"Drinkability: A light, pleasant, flavorful beer, one of the more interesting hells I had the opportunity of sampling while in Germany. A definite standout."
"I thought this was pretty solid."
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of bready malt with some grassy hops. A nice, clean smelling German lager. The flavor is mainly bready and biscuit malt with some grassy hops mixed in. I also get a little bit of light grape notes but they are pretty faint. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Another good beer from a great brewery."
"Decent lager, but pales in comparison to the rauchs."
"Pours relatively thin yet well formed creamy white head that sets to a firm cloth atop of effervescent yellow body with good clarity. The nose is dominated by Pils malt sweetness while smoke is virtually nonexistent. Flavor is pils malt sweetness with woody smokiness and towards the dry finish mild spicy noble hops and hop bitterness show up. Light bodied with moderate carbonation and somewhat creamy sensation."
"Overall, the beer is simple, unassuming and very refreshing, but I have to admit I was expecting something better."
"D: Very good summer drinker. The smoke adds a perfect amount of punch to differentiate out from an ordinary lager."
"This is a very good lager that is kicked up a notch by that hint of smoke. I really enjoyed that, and the combination of the interesting taste with the light body and the low ABV make this a very drinkable beer. I'd definitely get it again. Recommended."
"love it! beautiful pale hazy yellow, with a white head. the smell is of honey almonds, and a bit of wet grass. the taste is dry, and lightly smokey. crisp, with the sweetness in the mid-pallet, which then fads nicely and ends with a pipe tobacco finish. this beer's the shit! this might be what happens to lagers when they die and go to heaven."
"M: The smoke makes the beer, a full flavor that doesn't scorch the earth. A beer that paired nicely with several of the cheeses throughout the night."
"Light body and smoke makes for a refreshing beer, not usually what I get in smoked beers."
"O - This beer has pretty good drinkability. It has a nice flavor and goes down easy. I think this would be a nice beer to have while sitting outside on a hot day. Overall, I enjoyed it, and I would pick it up again."
"Overall very good. Easy drinking but still with enough unique points of interest to make me want another some time."
"O- Very quaffable brew."
"t-despite lack of a Smokey scent it, it has a Smokey taste. Crisp and refreshing. Kind of a mix between bitberger and schlenkerla smokey."
"O: A fantastic lagerbier. The smoke is definitely toned down from the regular Marzen, but this is just as fantastic in its own right, a definite pick up."
"A nice light beer, but I was expecting more, more taste, more smoke, something to make the taste different from a pilsner."
"Overall not bad, but I prefer this breweries other offerings."
"O-Would've preferred this to be smokier, but it's a well made beer."
"On the whole, this beer packs a good deal of smoky flavor, and is well-balanced. It is a nice and pretty drinkable brew."
"Pours a light straw color with a thin white head and not too much lacing, even after a good swirl to raise the head back up. The nose brings a good amount of smoke along with mild lager characteristics lingering in the background. The smoke definitely overwhelms the lager, which which basically just means a lightly-smoked carbonated beverage. This creates problems for both the nose and the taste. The feel is redeemed is the Helles' crispness is still there and fits well with the smoke. Fairly good, but not my favorite of theirs."
"The palate, like the nose, features a pleasantly subdued smoke character that's very complementary to the crisp breadiness of the malt. Light in body, quite balanced in all respects and very clean, this is one of the most quaffable beers I can recall having in recent memory. The mouthfeel is soft, and there's little bitterness or bite to the finish, but it's a thoroughly enjoyable and flavorful beer, especially given the modest ABV."
"Swirled the yeast in at the end and it didn't have much effect; it blended almost imperceptibly with what was there before. Though it did help the head stand up quite a bit better."
"This is the perfect way to introduce people to smoked beer without scaring them. Its also the perfect beer for a Summer BBQ. Smoke flavor is great for food pairing and the beer is still mild enough to provide refreshment."
"Drinkability - very interesting style. I'd like it on occasion, perhaps as a segue to getting someone to try a rauchbier. Overall, good beer."
"Overall: Good stuff. The smoke character is pleasant and an interesting addition, but I think I prefer the style without it."
"D: would make for a good starter into the rauchbier style."
"D -- I'm a bit iffy on the drinkability of this beer from the bottle. I think the smokiness could become fatiguing after a while, it's just not as good as fresh draft. On the other hand, it does go down nicely -- and it's easy to session at 4.3."
"D - Very enjoyable and refreshing lager. I would definitely have many of these beers."
"This is a very light smooth beer with an interesting flavor."
"When you think about all of the flavor that is packed into this 4.3% ABV beer, it becomes apparent that this is an awesome session beer. Though it won't knock off Augustiner as my fave for the style, the Schlenkerla is still an excellent Helles."
"Nice easy drinker. I love their festenbier and this can hold me over until it's available each spring. "
"Dark gold in color with a thin white lace. Carbonation is fairly low. There's a lot of sediment in the glass. Aroma is light smoke with no malt or hop aroma noticeable. Flavor is delicious, on its on it's a well-made helles with a light, slightly bready malt flavor. Then there is the added layer of smokiness that melds perfectly with the malt flavor. The smokiness is present, but subdued compared to other rauchbiers. Drinkability is fantastic."
"Pours a clear, gold color. One inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, pale malt, smoke, hint of citrus, hint of hops, hint of yeast. Fits the style of a Munich Helles Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of slight sweet malt, slight pale malt, slight metallic (only initially, fades very quickly), slight hops, hint of wheat, and hint of yeast. Overall, good appearance, smell, mouth feel, body, and blend."
"D: This is a Helles, naturally it will be about as drinkable as can be. That being said, it is also the most drinkable smoke flavored beer I have ever had. 5 Stars!"
"Really an unusual beer that works through, not something I would drink pints of but it is a nicely crafted, full flavored lager."
"Nice beer and an interesting helles. Immenesely flavourable for 4.3% and highly recommended."
"Drinkability: a lack of too much sweetness helps here; this is a nice dry lager. Mouthfeel is good and flavor is good, so I'm going to go out on a limb and say the drinkability is good too."
"Easy to drink and a unique beer for the style. Glad I tried it."
"Nice balance with the smoked malts, but I'm not sure it's a great Helles underlying the whole affair. Still, probably the best entry into smoked beers for the uninitiated."
"I poured into my glass to two fingers of white head. It is a clear golden yellow. The aroma is sweet, bready malt with a hint of their famous smoke. The taste is sweet malt and crisp. There is a slight smoke finish. This is an easy drinking beer and the smoke just makes it better."
"D: I definitely want to try this beer again because its subtle smoky flavor is rather unique and makes both the smell and taste rather interesting. You would never expect the smoke from the appearance of this beer."
"Overall I wasn't expecting a whole lot after getting a whiff of this beer but the complexity added in the flavor profile more than made up for it. A very interesting and subtle beer that's well worth a shot."
"The mouthfeel is a standout in this beer, with a gentle carbonation and a sweet finish. Overall, the ""smoke yeast"" both took away from the cleaness of the lager, and didn't add enough of a twist to make it great."
"Overall, a very unique Helles lager, the smokiness adds a pleasant touch, definitely worth a try at least once, I would gladly drink again."
"Pours out a hazy golden color in appearance. Frothy head dissappears fast. Stagnant particles remain. The aroma is of slightly sweet smoke. The flavor is very roasty caramel with a slight smoke finish. A quite drinkable brew - I would get this again."
"At the South Philly Tap Room. Poured a cloudy yellow/straw with two fingers of white head, and good retention. Picked up smoke in the nose, but less so than in some of the other Schlenkerla styles. Tasted very smokey initially, then more malty, and then a nice hoppy/malty finish, with smoke/malt in the aftertaste. Nicely carbonated medium/thin feel. Very sessionable."
"D - This is definitely not the norm for a Helles lager, but if this is what they all tasted like, I would be drinking them alot more often. Great flavor and aroma. The smoked malts add a unique twist to the flavor while not being overpowering. Full flavor without being too heavy, and retaining that crisp lager mouthfeel."
"I didn't get to watch the pour but it was served to me in a weizen glass. Nice golden, straw colored body with lots of carbonation contributing to the two-finger, off-white, foamy head. My nose is picking up smoke only. It's more than the predominant smell here. The taste is a different story. Contrary to what I remember about the Marzen, the smokiness sits back a little and though, while ever present, lets the malts do more talking. There's a fine carbonation to this beer with medium body, it's excellent. I wish I weren't on a budget, because I'd order another. I enjoyed this beer with snails and venison."
"i had this both from bottle and on tap and it s always superb. if you get a chance a definite must."
"D: A great beer for grilling; this is a nice, slightly smokey lager"
"D - Very enjoyable. I prefer this to most lagers."
"Very dry, but it does coat the tongue a bit. Overall, a really interesting mix of flavors that imho comes out just right."
"Soft carbonation could be slightly higher, but there is little to quibble with here. Nice balance of sweet/bitter/dry without high alcohol makes this extremely drinkable. Even many of those who try to avoid the harshness of some smoked beers need to give this a try."
"O: A refreshing and light beer with plenty of flavor to keep you wanting more. I'd like a little more hops on the finish, but you can definitely drink a couple of these without blinking."
"Slightly sour from the skunkiness. Mostly malty with a mild hop spot in the swallow. Creamy finish. Good body for the style. Not the best light malted lager, but it holds its own."
"D- A pretty drinkable brew. I thought this was a smoked beer but from what I understand, it is not. At almost $5 for the bottle, I probably won't buy again."
"A fine Bavarian lager to usher in the Spring and it's warming weather..."
"A really delightful beer - this would be a good brew for those who are put off by a rauchbier (many seem to be) but are intrigued by the idea of a smoked beer."
"lately i've been all about lagers, but this one just doesn't do it for me. there's nothing wrong with it, but at the same time, i can't pick out anything about it that i love."
"Beautiful, intriguing beer."
"Medium-bodied, decent amount of carbonation (I'm glad this one wasn't too carbonated as it would have overpowered the woody, smokey flavor). Very much a session beer at 4.3%, and the woody flavor in conjunction with its solid Munich helles lager attributes make this one a pleasure to consume in scalable quantities."
"D - I love the complexity of the lager and the smoke compliments in every way and really addss to the Helles - Excellent drinkability!"
"Prosit!"
"taste is of corn, malt, a little sweet in back, a little smoke, and well hidden hops, ends dry and a little bitter."
"D- Would make a great session beer if it was significantly cheaper."
"i was ecstatic when i saw this at the store. i'm really glad it lived up to my expectations."
"Poured a 500ml Bottle in pint glass at room temp - Clear, pilsener-golden beer with a small, white head. Faint smoked aromas and some sweet malt in the flavour. Good smokey notes that are very exciting. Fresh and easy to drink. Great pilsner beer and great flavor!"
"pours a light golden color with hardly any foam at all, it looks pretty boring really. smell is ok, some light hops and sweet malt flavor are pretty prevalent. taste is pretty similar, has a nice sweet malt flavor as its base, with a light hop flavor to it, mouthfeel and drinkability are decent, its a nice helles, but i really think there are betters out"
"D- a very drinkable brew, a nice session beer w/ lots of flavor"
"drinkability is great - a beer @ only 4.3% and this flavorful - forget about it!!"
"D: Smooth and drinkable, at this low abv it goes down easy...Overall this is a great helles lager. Very nice!"
"A helles for smoked salmon lovers?"
"Poured into a weisse glass. Has a big beautiful white head and clear very light straw color. Great lacing. Nice clean yeasty aroma. And a great light but flavorful taste. I enjoyed this alot. Was not expecting to like it as much as I did. I could drink this all day if it was not so expensive. A wonderful helles style brew."
"Overall the beer was smooth and kind fo bland. The smokey aftertaste was unnecessary and abbreviated my pleasure of this beer. Sorry Schlenkerla. Not interested."
"D-I would drink this all the time if it came in 12 packs. The price is kind of high too for a 16 ounce. But I will get this again."
"The taste is quite smooth, slightly lemony, with that undefined fruitiness emerging in the taste as well. The real definitive element in the beer is the smoked flavors. This is really good. A smoked lager, that's a first. The beer is very light, moderately refreshing, with just a touch of dry tartness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is pretty undefined and light. This is a must try for its uniqueness. L'Chaim."
"Drinkability: This is a very refreshing and nicely drinkable beer that I enjoyed a great deal. I could easily have several in an evening and I won't hesitate to have this one again and I certainly will look for it in the future. Even thought the malts in this one are not smoked it is amazing just how much smoke this beer picks up just from being brewed in the same brewery on the same equipment. This smoky character definitely sets it apart from the field of Helles lagers and does so in a good way, to my tastes."
"D - Great. Would really love to try this with some smoked seafood. Like smoked fish, muscles, cheeses... A nice treat."
"Bright, clean, light golden body with a big, fluffy, frothy, off-white head. Biscuity malt aroma with light touches of honey and grain. Big funky, Euro wall of hops. Light smokiness. Slightly soapy, toasted biscuit malt up front. Snappy Euro-hop bitterness provides some nice funk and herbal goodness. Subtle smokiness beneath it all lends that Schlenkerla signature. I wouldn't mind more smoke though... Light honey sweetness lingers in the finish. Moderate body with a crisp, lively mouthfeel. A nice session lager, with a hint of smoke makes for a good beer!"
"Overall- Wasn't too impressed with the corn smell but drank easy with a crisp smokiness."
"Poured a golden color with a foamy white head dissipating to a thin cap and lasting lacing. Smells of smoke with some hops. Tastes of smoke malt and hops in a nice combination. Mouthfeel is creamy smoth and carbonated. Drinkability is great I could drink these all night, although I like the smoked ham on wheat taste of their ""Original Schlenkerla Smokebeer - Wheat"" a little better, this has a nice clean finish that would be easy to drink in quantity."
"D - A good beer - probably the closest I've come to being wowed by a helles. Smoke was much less than I was expecting. I think this would be overwhelmed by ribs, but something like pulled chicken could make a pretty good pairing. I would drink this again."
"Interesting find on tap at The Other Side Cafe in Boston. Pours pale golden with off-white head. Aroma has some fruit and a perfumy quality, along with smoke. On the palate the perfume quality is present and the beer is overall very crisp and refreshing. Good accompaniment to the pub fare."
"D - I really don't remember this much smoke when I had it on tap but it is still a refreshing, interesting beer."
"Overall a very nice smoked lager. Quite tasty and very accurate to the style. Excellent."
"Served in a standard pint. Poured a bright, translucent yellow with a half inch foamy, bright white head that eventually dissipates into a solid skim. Some strands of delicate lacing exposed during the session. Nose was very mild - some cereal grains. Taste not at all consistent with nose - smokey, jerky, some sweetness at the back (corn syrup?). Reminds me of a rauchbier. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a consistent background carbonation from sip to swallow. Drinkability is decent - not what I expected. Good complexity, but not as refreshing as I anticipated."
"And with that said, unless you go to Bamberg to sample the wares, there's not a lot of other examples to try in the U.S."
"The pour is light yellow with brilliant clarity. The thin, white head doesn't hang around too long, receding to a ring. On the nose, there's a light smoky character, with a touch of butter and a crisp, biscuit/cracker character. Clean. On the palate, it opens crisp and mildly bitter with a firm earthy hop bite and a touch of lemon. Mild smoky character, woody in nature. Dry and bitter on the finish. The body's light, and the crisp, refreshing finish and great carbonation make for a truly drinkable beer"
"Pours a clear yellow color with one inch of white head that had good retention. The head eventually settles to a thin cap. Moderate amount of lacin is left on the glass. I can smell some sweet malt with noticable noble hops. A touch of smoke is also detected. A different flavor than the typical Helles. A little smoke up front before the sweet malt takes over. The hops are a little weak but noticable in the finish. Cereal grains in the aftertaste. Bitterness is low. Light body with abundant carbonation that stops short of being harsh. Low ABV and the unusual flavor component makes this one an interesting drinker."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are spot on."
"Thanks"
"D- This beer is the definition of a session beer for me, very tasty and extremely drinkable."
"This was a lovely surprise, this beer is just packed with flavor, but it isn't a big, bulky brew just light and flavorful. They ave succeed in creating a whopper of a low abv beer that I would stack up against many big beers. If you want a reprieve from your everyday Bavarian Helles this is the way to go."
"The body is light and crisp, it flows nicely across the tongue. The only reason drinkability suffers is that the smoke gets tiresome. I could have 1 a day, but probably not 2. Overall, a very good beer, try it when you get the chance."
"D-One or two of these would be all I'd need mainly because the smoke becomes the dominating flavor after a while. It would seem like a good, easy beer on a hot summer day."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a really nice simple beer that is worth drinking for a long time."
"drinkability is good. the smoke is pretty subtle, allowing the munich helles part of the beer to show well, but the smoke ends up a bit too light to be fully appreciated. the overall chracter is quite nice, but ends up a bit less than it could be. still a solid beer on tap."
"Pours a brilliantly clear pale gold in color with about a finger of white head that quickly settles to just a thin cap. Aroma is quite nice, slightly grainy but generally clean pils malt and a low slightly spicy noble hop aroma. Taste is pretty darn good as well. A bit grainy at first but that gives way to a good pil-malt character. A low-medium hop bitterness with low noble hop flavor. Good mouthfeel with medium-light body and medium carbonation. Drinkability is quite good. This is a great example of a helles lager. Its perfect for a warm summer's day and was very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: This is the least smoky of the Scherlenkerla offerings and only has a touch of smoke on the aftertaste. A decent lager, I could have two but would no desire for a third."
"Overall - A nice mellow quaffable lager which doesn't overdo the smokiness... recommended.."
"A decent example of the style from the land that bore it. I can't say that it's the best I've had but it has more hop character than some other examples I've had. Decent."
"Very drinkable. If you like smoke. But it has the drinkability of a Helles and the right amount of smoke only increases its drinkability."
"very smooth, with tiny trace of astringency. crisp, sometimes creamy carbonation."
"An interesting Helles Lager indeed. It is nowhere near the smoke character of their other beers but it is there in a subtle way which makes it slightly more complex. If it were cheaper I would gladly drink again."
"MF&D - a cool refreshing beer that actually has some body and meaning to it. the carbonation is sizable and makes up much of the caracter, along with the smoke"
"This beer pours a clear bright golden yellow with a thin but substantial white head that leave wispy lacing behind. The nose is dominated by smoke but not quite like a Marzen, slightly more muted but still HIGHLY present, pale malts can be detected in the nose as well. Taste is a surprise as the smokey flavoring is more of an after thought. Taste is heavier on biscuity malts - too biscuity. Smokiness is in the finish. This was a lighter bodied beer, decent carbonation, not filling at all. The taste lessens the drinkability on this beer. I was really disappointed with the overbiscuity, smoked flavor. It wasn't well balanced for me."
"Taste is smokey with bready malt. The smoked malt is adding a subtle smoke flavour. Without any band-aids or rubbery notes, this is quite unique. The smoke reminds me most of a fresh timber fire, crisping wood. There are some biscuity and amber-malty notes that contributet to the body of the beer. The smoke makes this beer a really unique lager beer, which I wouldn't drink all night, but a couple a night will do."
"Had this on tap at the El Bait Shop in Des Moines. Poured a nice golden lager color. I am not a big fan of smoked beer so I was surprised to find that the smkoked aroma was very subtle. Mostly biscuity aroma. Same in the taste with hints of caramel. The smokey taste always lingers all the way to the end. I rather enjoyed this beer. The smokiness didn't overpower the beer. Good beer."
"A half-liter bottle poured into my Great Lakes dimpled mug. Appears a clear golden straw color with about two fingers of pillowy bone white foam. No lacing to speak of. A great looking pour! Nose and flavor are of a rather mild smokiness, obviously the least smoked of all the Schlenkerla's, and it really works here. The beer picks up a very subtle smokiness from the wood tanks. Notes of lightly toasted bread and malts, as well as grassy hops are also noticeable. medium bodied and a bit oily with ample carbonation. The perfect beer to introduce you to the Schlenkerla line."
"pour is golden with a nice head, white, tight and some lace. the nose is a bit of apple but predominately smokiness. not overpowering though. some honey, some fruit. the palate isn't as dry but not earth but smoke. very mild earth. very light actually all around. would like to see more malt character equivalent with the smoke. a stylistically particular beer as a helles. so not a beer for the regular lager man. would recommend with rips though."
"Smoke smell, silky smooth taste and feel, and drinkability are awesome. Ii can't imagine how to improve this, but it's possible it may happen."
"Really great beer! I wish I could afford to stock my fridge with this stuff for the summer."
"Looks like something I'm not going to like. I'm a fan of the Aecht smoke beers, and bought this on a lark. Clear golden lager pour with a short lived white head. Not much at all in the smell - nothing offensive, nothing delicious, just clean. Taste is similar. A bit bready, nothing as forward as a witte or a weizen. Nice carbonation and a solid mouthfeel. Drinkability is a no brainer. This is lawn mower beer. A great summer beverage. Cold, crisp, and clean. Thoroughly enjoyable."
"Altogether this is some good clean fun. A light beer with lovely flavor. I suggest rauch fans try it to taste a less forceful employment of this versatile malt. I could see this level of smoke in plenty of beers. Would be nice in a simcoe IPA or APA for sure!"
"Overall, I do not recommend this one. I would try it again from the bottle, but I am not looking forward to it."
"Very drinkable. A great example of this style of beer."
"Overall a stellar beer and should be the standard by which all others (in this style) are judged - just by the malt & hop profile alone, (the smokiness is an added bonus). I've yet to be disappointed by any Bamberg breweries offerings. Now if I could just get Mahrs Brewing closer to my area."
"Pours a clear golden yellow color with a medium sized white head that leaves some soapy sticking. Corn flakey fresh grain, quality rich sweet malt, lemon skin and a little bit of metal in the nose. Crisp in flavor great balance achieved here, i love the earthy, herbal hop character. Superb water quality, excellent malt choice, with the subtlest hints of smokiness. A larger than light body with perfect carbonation. The only flaw i catch is the semi-sticky malt flavor lingers and coats a little too much on the mouth and leaves what to me tastes like a copper/metal flavor on the tongue. Either way this is a light, flavorful, sessionable German helles lager."
"A nice overall beer, one I would recommend as a departure from the American Lagers."
"Light-bodied, well-carbonated, completely inoffensive and quaffable."
"Notes: Loved it and the Brauerei Heller-Trum / Schlenkerla again demonstrates their mastery of the styles that they brew. Highly recommended."
"Purchased at Whole Foods Market NYC. Poured into a Pilsner glass - golden yellow. Nice solid head which dissapates rather quickly. Good lacing and lasting carbonation. Have to agree with previous reviewers in the doughy odor to it. Heavy malt taste initially, mouthfeel is unremarkable. Finishes with a smoked flavor, slightly bitter, not bad. A fairly drinkable beer, would probably make an excellent acoompanying beer for brats or smoked sausages."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Pours a hazy golden straw color with a small pure white head. The aroma is of a bready/doughy malt and a nice spicy hop. The taste is of the doughy munich malt and spicy nobel hops. More of a hop profile than your typical munich helles. There is also a tin like flavor as well. The feel is moderate, nice malty chewiness, fizzy carbonation; finishes sweet and spicy. An easy drinking brew, the spicy hops neutralize the munich malt so this brew doesn't have the typical munich helles flavor. Worth a go."
"D - I didn't know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised with my findings. A great brew at a reasonable price. Will have again."
"5/4/7/4/13 (3.3/5)"
"Drinkability: As I generally don't care for the style, it is hard to get excited about this; it does drink nicely, however, and the smoke adds an interesting dimension"
"Pours a very pale golden yellow color with a lot of visible carbonation and a thin white head. Aroma is dominated by a smokey woodsy maltiness with very slight golden fuit notes. Golden pilsner altiness with a subtle hop character and a very smokey, characoal wood chip flavor. Dry finish."
"As helles lagers go, this was was so-so. The lager character was there, with noticeable honey and lemon somewhat mellowed by a light smoke flavor. But really, the smoke was so distant as to be difficult to detect. So in the end the smokiness was not a factor in either aroma or taste. That leaves the helles part, and I'd say that was pretty distant, too, when compared to something like a Weihenstephan helles. The Schlenkerla was dull yellow in color, with a thin body, light carbonation and a bite that was rather toothless. I love Schlenkerla's rauchbiers, but this particular beer could be a pass."
"Pours a straw golden color with medium white head and some spots of lacing down the glass. Smell is just excellent. More of a smoked presence than from the bottle, that's for sure. It is just as prominent as anything else in the nose. Taste carries on in that fashion. For such a light brew, there is a lot going on. Biscuity, cereal like malt. Faint fruit and earthy, grassy hops. A touch of honey. Nice light mouth with a crisp snap in the finish. Just an all around excellent and memorable beer. One of my favorites of any style."
"D: This beer is pretty much awesome all around, and I would have no problem spending a day drinking nothing but this. Outstanding."
"D - A no brainer as far as a beer that I would like to have a couple of. I will seek out again."
"I look forward to drinking this again!"
"Notes from 9/2/06"
"Good cigar brew."
"This was my first Helles Lager and I like the style. Very light and crisp. Well worth trying."
"D- after the initial shock of experiencing this unique taste, i found this beer to be thoroughly delicious as well as refreshing on this presidential election morning, and most interesting breakfast i've had in a long while. they say it only picks up smoke flavor from being brewed in the same vessels as the rauchbiers. no doubt that fact characterizes its friendly drinkable nature. i heard someone say BBQ."
"Drinkability: Well, that really was a breath of fresh air! Schlenkerla lite, I dare say. Overall, highly drinkable and a very good way to casually introduce yourself to Schlenkerla's wares."
"Not the best light beer I've had and not my favorite beer from Schlenkerla. It you like crispy pale Lagers with a touch of smoke added to it, then I could see this as some kind of session beer. For me, one of these was good enough."
"D- This beer has a great balance of light smoke noble hops and yeasty malt notes. I never though smoke in a helles would work but this beer really has all the flavors working together."
"D - The best helles I've had, though it's obvious this has some rauchbier tendencies; not really sure how to classify this guy. All in all, a very good brew with much more character than the average helles."
"Overall I would have to give this one an average. Definitly not the best thing I have ever had by a long shot, but nowhere near the worst. I would try it again if nothing else were around, but not at the 2.99 I paid for it."
"MF&D - Needless to say this was not my cup of tea, or beer in this case. I guess its a good representation of the Schlenkerla style, but being a Hells lager I didn't expect such a smokey smell/taste."
"Poured a slightly hazy pale yellow. There was a very slight head that quickly dissipated and no lace. There's nothing on the label except the name that indicates the smokey quality of the beer. And I'd forgotten that about the name. Not bad though. Balanced considering the smoke. Of course a smokey finish. Slight smoke in the nose. Be fun to cook with."
"D: Remarkably drinkable, this came very close to a '5' for me. Light 'sessionable' ABV (only 4.3%), nice aroma, intriguing flavor. One I'll definitely seek out again."
"D: Awesome beer. Would love to have a keg of this at home. Tons of flavor without the hammer."
"D - Can drink them all afternoon"
"Surprising whiff of a light smoked peat, crisp with some lingering summer spices. Yep, the dash of smoke moves into the quaff gingerly, and nicely. A very nice treat that drinks easily in the summer heat - a good session brew with the 4.3% and only a bit over $3 for a 500ml bottle."
"Very nice on the palate with a pretty god feel and a nice tingle of carbonation. Nice balance of the hops made this a pretty pleasing beer."
"Drinkability - Great example of the style! Getting better and better as it warms. So easily drinkable it would make a great paring with any kind of smoked food."
"Drinkability: This was quite an interesting beer. I'm usually not a lager fan but this one was pretty intriguing. The smokiness added a lot to the beer. More complex than your normal lager. I could see drinking this with some bbq on a summer day."
"D: Again could have scored higher if it were not for that soapy kind of taste near the end. This beer is quite refreshing for a slightly smoked beer and the mouthfeel will always bring me back for more."
"had this at chef paul's served in it's own glassware and i couldn't stop drinking it. appearance is your typical helles lager, very light straw in color with perfect clarity and a nice creamy white head and lacing that coats throughout. aroma is nice-some sweet doughy/bready malts, light grassy and spicy hops, and just a hint of light smoke providing an interesting twist. taste is nicely balanced with the sweet malts finishing clean with a light, smooth bitterness. creamy, frothy mouthfeel that feels a bit bigger than it's abv would suggest. very drinkable and a really nice session beer-interesting and with a low abv."
"I recommend this beer strongly to any lover of Helles Lagers or Rauchbiers. It's not a true rauchbier of course, but has just enough to satisfy for this style."
"Pours very pale gold with a frothy white head. Aroma of yeast, smoke, and spice. Light, highly carbonated body. Initial taste is crisp and clean, pilsner like hops...lagerlike. Finish is nicely (and not overwhlelmingly) smoked which definitely elevates this otherwise unexciting beer. Not my favorite of the Aecht Schlenkerla line, but a clean, crisp, refreshing beer."
"Drinkability is slightly above average -- at 4.30, you can put away a bunch of these. But the novelty of the smoke gets a little old. Also a little nagging, since they're not going all out like a rauchbier."
"Pours very pale golden, like straw with very little head. I was motivated to try this beer by recent threads on BA about how this beer had picked up some of the smoke characteristics from being made in the same brewery as the Rauchbiers though merely incidental contact with the smoke. Sure enough, there is indeed smoke in the nose and taste. It is relatively subtle, but definitely there and part of the overall flavor profile. Beside that the beer is a light but pleasant Helles with moderate bitterness and is quite clean and a bit of a sweet light malt tang. Smooth and crisp and the smoke really blends beautifully. In this case, you get less of the smoked meat and more subtle woodsmoke (alder?) scent. Nice."
"This was on tap at the Moan and Dove. Settled with a clear gold appearance and an excellent, frosty head that thinned out. The smells were rich in grassy and toasty hops. While in the flavor category, it had a sour-bitter citrus balance going on wrapped around the grainy and dry, toasty texture. In the mouthfeel department, the beer was light and smooth, probably thanks to the smokiness. Overall, pretty good."
"This is very drinkable, feels light. Medium carbonation gives a prickly mouthfeel."
"Poured into a .5 liter stein a dull lemon yellow with a bit of chill haze a very thin wispy head atop,lighter aromas I picked up faint smoke and toasted grain with light iron/mineral.Taste is sweeter than expected some defienent honey malt and a touch of spice with the smoke coming thru but not overbearing not much hop presence.A light to medium mouthfeel and a low ABV makes it very drinkable but its a little dull on the palate and a little sweeter than expected."
"D: Good summer drinker and not overpowering on the smoke but was hoping for a bit more of that bacon background Ive come to love from AS beers."
"good drinkability, easy, but keeps yuou interested... this one provides a unique take on a helles the light sweet maltiness, smoke and hops create a nice range of flavors."
"This beer pours a clear golden color. The head is one inch in height, frothy and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of biscuity malt, with a soft spicy hop presence. The taste is like the aroma, but with a very slight hint of smoke. The mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a great helles. I will certainly drink this again."
"Otherwise, a decent stab at the style..."
"This beer is crystal clear and golden in the glass with a nice fluffy cap of white foam. Pale malts and graininess emanate into the nose, perhaps a slight smokiness as well. The beer is light to medium bodied. The taste is similar to the aroma with bready malts and very little indication of bitterness or hops. The finish has a very slight hint of smoke. Subtlety is key here and that should be appreciated."
"Drinkability: Complex taste, but still nicely drinkable."
"D: Drinkability is very good especially within style."
"M: light in body. refreshing crispness and spot on carbonation make this a very drinkable offering. Also highly sessionable."
"This is a crystal clear clean golden lager with a white head, you can see why it's a helles. Theres a good sweet malt aroma and cleansing mouthfeel. This beer has an amazing interplay of malt smoke and hops. You start out with a light smoke that returns in the aftertaste with an amazing dance of smoke and hopppy bitternes that inataly clenses but after half the glass just keeps going. I wish i could have this with some lightly smoke salmon or sushi."
"Bottle: Poured clear golden yellow color lager with a medium white foamy head with average retention and limited lacing. Aroma of floral malt with some sweetness also noticeable. Taste is a mix between some floral malt with some sweet notes but I could not distinguish any some at all. Body is quite full and slightly oily with some medium carbonation. Interesting but not really smokey."
"Pours golden and extremely clear. Nice white two finger head that does not linger. Nose is subtle with hints of yeast, spice and fruit. The taste is bright and sharp, with apple and pear flavors. Clean spicy finish, that leaves a bit of a funky taste on the roof of the mouth. A great beer for a hot summer day or a cold rainy night like this while waiting for dinner."
"Overall, pretty good, but a little on the boring side honestly. It may be a good beer to introduce new advocates into the world of smoke, seeing as how it is MUCH more tame than their other beers. Its definitely worth a try, but I wouldn't lose any sleep searching for it."
"Easy to drink for a smoky beer. Still, if I wanted a smoky beer, I would choose something else from this brewery. This is pretty much a run-of-the-mill Munich Helles Lager with this brewery's Rauchbier characteristic."
"Drinks very easy, I was really impressed at how low the abv was, but this didn't show any thinness & still packed flavor. One I could easily pound through a football double-header or drink one or 2 & just enjoy its subtleties"
"D: Overall, an insanely drinkable beer. With only 4.3% abv, a light (but not ultra-light) body, and enough hops to keep the palate interested, this would make a great session beer. Fans of German lagers, especially the Helles style, will definitely appreciate this one. Very well done."
"Highly recommended."
"A good summer beer on a hot day. When foolish people open their cans of Budweiser swill, this would be a tasty, respectable alternative. Very light, but with some nice smoky flavor. Perfect for late summer as airy taste and smell fit with the season, but the underlying smoke lingers as if to remind the palate and the person that cool autumn will soon be on its way."
"Clear straw hued body has a small and fleeting white head. Aroma has some subtle smokiness but mostly sweetish malt and spicy hop. Crisp medium body supports a light body and medium carbonation. Clean feel. Taste has some sweet gariny malt that is expertly balanced by a clean spicy hoppiness. The smoked malt is present but not obtrusive, most noticeable as an aftertaste. Very sessionable. The brewery's most accessible smoked bier that I've sampled. This one doesn't come across like liquid smoke."
"Colored golden like a typical lager, and the head dissipates quickly. The smell is crisp and slightly smoky. This would be a great ""gateway beer"" into rauchbier like the Schlenkerla Marzen. Personally, I think the smokiness is so slight that it teases rather than fulfills. But then again, this isn't labeled a ""rauchbier"". Still very interesting."
"D: A very good beer. Good nose and flavor and an outstanding mouthfeel. What a light lager can taste like. Supremely drinkable."
"Aecht Schlenkerla Helles Laberbier pours a golden color with a tinge of orange and a minimal white head from a brown half liter bottle. A little bit of malt and perhaps a bit of smoke are noticeable in the nose. This is a very pleasant tasting lager with a strong tinge of smoke that is more noticeable at some points than others. Very drinkable."
"Prosit und Zum Wohl, MK"
"D: During the first several sips, the smokiness is overwhelming. However, as you sip it further, it seems to start to blend more with the beer. That said, this is my first beer from Bamberg (the inventors of ""smoke beer""), so I think this is very good for a ""smoke flavored helles"". Not something I would normally drink, but I think this would be a great beer for any beer geek to try, as it's very interesting."
"Pours a two-finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving traces of lace. Almost clear pale amber color. Smoky nose. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is smoky sausage, way more than ""a hint of smokiness"". Clean finish. $3.30 for a 500ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Oddly (at least to me) is that this beer really does look lager-like. it is golden with nice amounts of head. Aroma is very smokey. Mouthfeel is actually fairly pleasant. Recommended."
"It poured like your average Euro lager, fairly clear gold, with a thin white head that dissipated quickly. It smelled of light toasted grains, apple, and grassy hops, but the whole thing was enhanced by the smoky Schlenkerla flavor that I now love. Tastes pretty good -- it would be a typical decent German lager, but for the hints of smoke which make it an intriguing take on the Helles style. I was surprised to read on the website that there is actually no smoked malt in this beer, but it's fermented in the same vessels in which they make their Marzenbiers, which gives it that smoky infusion. Yum. It's decently crisp, and for an extra-tasty 4.3% lager, I'd say an excellent session beer. Man, I've got to make it out to Bamberg sooner than later."
"$3,08 at Green's on Buford Hwy, Atlanta, Ga. USA. Quite possibly the best German lager I have had in a very long time, perhaps ever. Poured up very average looking with a golden straw colour and snow white head. Foamy top faded away in about 45 seconds. Smell was a little grassy and smelled like 1000's of other German lagers. So far, pretty average, but average ends here. Taste was actually a bit sweet and reminded me a little bit of honey. Very little bit, but honey none the less. An illusion, I'm sure, as I see no mention of honey anywhere on the bottle. Finish was mildly bitter. Drink was very gentle, smooth, and pleasant all the way through. Mouthfeel was very smooth with just the right level of CO2. A very impressive lager, indeed. I wish I had a case."
"At 4.3% I think this is a fantastic session beer. I raise my glass to taking a chance on a label I've never heard or read about before. What a home run!"
"The Schlenkerla malty flavor and smoke combination has got to be one of the most addicting flavor combinations out there in my opinion. Whenever I open any of their beers, it's tough to make it last five minutes. Awesome brew..."
"Although no mention of Rauch (smoke) is made on the label, I suppose the Schenkerla beers are a product of a Bamberg Rauchbierbrauerei, thus a smoke character could have been expected. As with the other Schenkerla beers this Helles was quite good, and highly recommended if you enjoy the more delicate smoky flavors of German Rauchmalz."
"PROST! Beertracker"
"Pours a clear yellow/goldish, thin white head, nice lacing, and good retention. Smell is sweet, smokey, some apples, caramel, quite nice, right touch of smoke. Taste is caramel, smokey notes, apples, very smooth, nice flavours. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, very smooth and refreshing. I liked this, thought the smoke character was perfect and gave it that extra complexity, great change during this tasting. Thanks Harry!"
"The body is fairly thin, as expected, though I thought it would be a little more crisp. A little more cleaner than I expected as well, given the smoke. Good overall. I probably won't drink it again, but at least it has helped me to gain a little more appreciation for rauchbier, which is one of the few German styles I have yet to truly adore."
"A light lager that is pretty (bright, white, rocky head of foam) with spicy, hoppy aroma and a hint of smoke. A very nicely balanced helles lager, so light in fact, that you can taste the minerals (sort of salty?) with a bit more hop bite in the finish than expected. The unusual phenolics (from smoke I'm told) add a funky dimension to this beer that I can enjoy. Love the smoked beers and this one is pretty darn good, too."
"Pours an apple golden, head would form somewhat. A little cloudy. Aroma of a peaty cider. Plenty of fireplace like peat, with notes of apple and pear. The smoke takes over the in the taste department, setting it apart from other Munich Helles, giving it much more character. Really distinctive peat smoke. A lot of ripe apple in the taste. A bold malt bill too. Distinct (especially within its style) and quite filling, drinks heavier than a standard German lager. Happy to try!"
"Good lager and great fall back if you don't know what you want, but prefer something that is highly dirnkable."
"Its hard not to like this beer. Its a tasty, super-drinkable lager that I could consume all day long."
"I've been looking for this offering for quite some time now and I'm glad that I finally found a bottle. It's a great addition to the Aecht Schlekerla series of beers and is easily the equal of my other favorites of the Munich Helles Lager style, the versions from Brauereien Aying and Weihenstephaner. Helles Lagerbier is a light, smoky treat and should be on the 'must try' list of all who consider themselves connoisseurs of smoked beer."
"Another quality brew from these guys."
"Perhaps it is just because it is not my style, but I found this one to be very unimpressive, and the only Aecht Schlenkerla I will not buy a second one..."
"Found this one at the always worth a visit DeCicco martket in Pelham, NY. Squat German style bottle, w/o freshness indication (seems the Germans are slow to embrace this consumer friendly innovation) this one pour, clear, dull, yellowy, with an initially loose white fluffy head, evolving into a thick loose film and leaving pleanty of scattered drying lacing. Nose here is softly of grass and a hint of smoke. Pleanty of crisp, dry and snappy hops cary the freight here, also more hints of smoke, lime and then the expected bone dry spicy hop finish. Nice, refreshing lager, bring on the smoked meats, creamy cheese and bread."
"This lagerbier poured a clear, golden color with white foam that persisted a while then dissipated almost completely, though clinging a bit on the glass. There was a good stream of carbonation from the bottom of the glass. The smell was lightly malty with a touch of sweetness. There was perhaps the faintest touch of smoke, but perhaps it was my imagination? The taste was nicely mildly malty with a slight ""lager tanginess"". The hoppiness was very mild but well balanced with the malt. As with the aroma, there was perhaps the faintest touch of smoke in the flavor. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium body and modest carbonation. There was a mildly hoppy finish. This was a very nice, mild helles lager."
"Drinkability... a little better than average. Would have given it more, but the bitterness was a wee bit too prominent."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" bright white head over the clear light golden brew. Head fades down relatively quickly to white film, with prevalent sticky lace. Aroma is light sweetness with the ever-present Schlenkerla smokiness, although a bit controlled here. Taste is excellently balanced, with the maltiness countered by the moderate hoppiness, and wisps of smoke throughout it all. Mouthfeel and drinkability are excellent. This one's got the best of both worlds, some smokiness, but still easily approachable. This is the Schlenkerla to start someone new with."
"Ya' know the thing about lagers is they go down so easily and one this good is hard to savor. Tasty with just enough complexity to make it interesting. Very nicely done. This would be very good with grilled food."
"Recommended."
"I love this beer. I had this for the first time at a tasting with my beer rep at the bar I used to work for. Drinking this beer made me nervous at first seeing as Rauchbier is a once in a while indulgence for me. What a surprise though - poured into a willybacher this beer was a pale straw color with superior clarity (which for some reason I did not expect being as this is a Schlenkerla brew) with a rocky head. The aroma is of spicy hops, sweet bready malt and of course smoke -but much less smoke aroma than I get from the Schlenkerla Rauchbiers. Because this is not listed as a rauchbeir on the label I was torn as to what I should think about the smoke aroma. The mouthfeel is light clean and dry with a light carbonation. The first sip is outstanding - well-balanced malt, very crisp and dry, hops don't come in until the finish and are coupled with a very subtle, very flavorful and oddly refreshing smoke tinge. Who really brewed this? Clearly not Heller-Trum whos other beers are sooo very smokey and intensely robust. The smokiness is so subdued and complimentary to the rest of the beer's flavor profile, that I can hardly believe it's not an added synthetic flavor. Each sip and the smokiness becomes less and less pronounced as my palate grows accustomed. I ended up ordering a case of this and drank half of it myself. Recently I caught up with the local guy who works for the importer and he tells me the brewery uses absolutely NO smoked malt. Apparently they just pass unsmoked malt through the same gristmill as the smoked malt and this adds enough smokey starches to the brew. He also mentioned they use the same yeast strain as the authentic Rauchbier and so these yeast may be passing on smoke flavors from batches past. Either way this is an incredible Helles and very worth your attention, and the attention of your next cheeseburger."
"This would be an incredible session beer if it weren't $4 a bottle."
"This was fairly drinkable but I don't know if I could drink these all day or night. A nicer beer to enjoy but no thirst quencher. Very unique, definitely recommended."
"It's interesting that reviewers say they love it and then give it a 3.5. I think it has to do with the uniqueness of the style and our non-German taste buds. You love rauchbier or you don't. I'm completely floored. This is the best of both worlds when it comes to an awesome Europils/Helles and a rauchbier. Heaven sent. There is something magical about this beer, infusing one with the spirit of old Bamberg. Schlenkerla is an experience beyond the beer. Try it!"
"Thanks for picking this up Eric (Frozensoul), I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
"Taste is smoky, of course and a rich grassy malt. Noble hop finish with a faint fruitiness. Mouth is crisp, if a bit thinnish. This is just so heavenly good. One of the better beers I've had all year. Yummy!"
"Looks liek a normal helles. Golden, crisp looking yellow with one column of bubbles making its way to the top. But it doesn't smell like your normal helles. It's smoked. But smoked cyrstal and pale malts. Very lioght smokey aroma mixed with grass and pilsnert malts. Tastes like a distant smokehouse. Light mlating with an equally light smoke flavor. Very unique. One of a kind."
"Edit: Found some more of this finally. Still love it. I could drink this all day, and plan on buying a case to keep around."
"This one's a keeper and worth seeking out. Wonderful."
"Best beer I have had in a while. I quote crusher ""this beer rocks"""
"-Perfect. I could drink these all night. If you are looking for a gentle introduction to the obsession that is rauchbiers - this is it."
"Picked up a single bottle from Sam's Blue Light in Durham. I was told there that although this beer contains no smoked malt, it is made in/on the same equipment with which Aecht makes their rauchbiers, and in turn, picks up some of that characteristic."
"A nice gateway beer to rauchbiers or when you might want a bit of a complement to smokey foods without being overpowering."
"Smoked ham flavor with a mildly hopped drying sensation towards the end. A unique twist on the style."
"Very nice summer beer. Easy to drink and full of flavor."
"A unique offering, a terrific treat."
"One very solid, straight up goodalicious, Helles Lager!"
"Light in body and quite easy drinking. A nice drinker. Thanks cuz."
"A wonderfully drinkable Lager/Rauchbier. Pours out to a bright gold color with a small head of white foam. The head calms quickly to a thin layer of bubbles over the surface of the beer, and leaves minimal amounts of lace on the interior of the glass. Aromas of smoke and malt dance into the nose, with some fresh herbal characters mixed into the background. Taste is great; smoke and wood notes combine with full maltiness and grain and a touch of hoppy bite. Some grassy elements as well. Very nice. Mouthfeel is rich, yet not overpowering or thick. Drinkability? It's got it. By far, the lager style of this brew adds highly to the ability to have more than one. If it weren't so expensive, i'd keep them on hand at all times. Highly Recommended drinking."
"Clear pale yellow. Decent amounts of carbonation surface quickly. Thin, bubbly whitish head. Minimal lace. Biscuity and bready malts on the nose reminiscent of fine dortmunders. Faded smokiness and light caramel accent. Fairly crisp mouthfeel with that prickly kind of carbonation. Light to medium in body. Decent all around taste. Biscuity and grain malts form a subdued backbone. Campfire smoke accents...way in the distance. Sweet center. Very slight hop dryness. Good taster. Goes down with no problem."
"Drinkability & Notes  I can see this beer being perfect for a summer bbq, good smoke character, but still easy drinking. Its hard to call this beer refreshing, but I guess it falls closer to that than savory. It seems like this is a fresh sample, but I still like my smoked beers dark and meaty."
"Drinkabilty - I forced myself to try to finish this bottle, it did not happen."
"16.9 ounce bottle."
"Pours a beautiful straw yellow with nice carbonation rising to the top and a nice white head that doesnt retain that well. The aroma is excellent, with typical helles scents of biscuit and spicy hops, along with a subtle smokiness (after all they pretty much only brew smoked beer at schlenkerla) that adds another level of complexity to this beer. The flavor is similar to the aroma with normal helles characteristics; biscuit, grainy malt, spicy noble hops, subtle smokiness (resembles bacon), and a slight sweetness (likely residual sugars). The mouthfeel is light and moderately carbonated, with a clean finish and excellent drinkability. This was an excellent beer, seems the perfect marriage of styles (rauchbier and helles lager)...the subtle smokiness is perfect."
"Ultimately you just have to judge this beer for what it is- a 'one-of'. It is truly neither a smoked beer nor a helles, but on its own merits is quite well made and damned enjoyable. After my sixth one (no, not in a row) it became very clear to me that I had found a new favorite thing that I simply must revisit from time to time- it rewards contemplation for sure, but is even better as a quaffer and leaves you thirsting for more when it is gone."
"Pours as a crystal clear yellow color with a suitable foamy white head. The aroma is centered on a subtle smoke character. The smoke doesnt jump out of the glass, like other Schlenkerla beers, but it is omni-present, and very appealing. In addition to the smoke, theres a bit of grain and a light malt character. I couldnt get any hop aroma through the smoke. The taste, like the smell, is pinned to the smokiness. Theres also a soft and round malt quality. Finishes with just a touch of bitterness for balance. The beer is semi-dry, with a soft, lingering finish. With the smoke providing a flourish of flavor, and not being overbearing, this brew would be a great accompaniment to lots of food. I wish I had some horseradish cheese."
"Drinkability: I did not expect the smoky tones with this beer when I picked it up compared to other beers produced here, but it was a pleasant surprise. Nice overall character - worth seeking out."
"500 mL German bottle. The guy at Wine Warehouse told me they brew this as a regular Helles lager, but because they use the same equipment to package the beer, some of the smoky qualities of their rauchbiers inadvertently end up in this beer. Not sure if it's true, but it would make sense. Anyway, it pours into the pilsner glass a clear yellow/gold with a 1 finger head that reduces to a thick and creamy layer of foam that sticks quite well. The aroma consists of toasty, pale malts with a faint smokiness and a mild dose of spicy hops. It is initially quite crisp with a medium body, but the carbonation evens out and the flavor follows what the scent hinted at. It's pretty tasty and the faint smoke adds an interesting twist to this German lager."
"Substantive creamy head. Medium body, with cream and grain, smokey and hops in finish as well as metallic. Drinkable, but I thought the smoke was more than I would want next time. suitable carbonation. Surprisingly decent find , Court Liquor, near the New Jersey ocean."
"Another offering from the Schlenkerla line, and surprise surprise, another stubby bottle adorned with a label in Fraktur German. After the beer was poured, the body looked clear, pale, and well carbonated. The head was one finger thick, and left scant lacing. The smell was only faintly smoky, and would have been hard to place if I did not know the origin. The taste was more pronounced in terms of smoked flavor, although the pale sweet Pilsner malt and the hint of lemon in the taste were more the primary tastes here. Unlike other beers from this brewery, the hops were also clearly evident. Like all the other offerings from this brewery, there was a beer made true to the style under the smoked malt here. This would have been a good pale lager even if it wasnt faintly smoky."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is light bodied. The beer has nice a nice crisp carbonation. This is just an outstanding beer treat. This is definately a proverbial session beer. The beer is easy to consume. I wish that I had more."
"Overall, I wasn't as impressed by this offering from Heller-Trum as I am with their rauchbier Ur-Bock or Marzen. I think it had to do mainly with the way the hops bitterness clashed with the smokey taste. Rather than working together, it was like two weasels fighting in a burlap bag. Still, it's good and worth a try."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are downright huge. This floats into your mouth and the bottle's gone before you know it. This could be a nice introduction to the general properties of Rauchbier before going balls to the wall with this brewery's other (much more intense) offerings."
"An excellent pairing with smoked meats."
"Served from a bottle with no freshness date. Poured into a pilsner glass. Pours a clear straw color with a white lacy head. Smoked smell is evident, smells like bacon, but does not dominate the smell of the beer. Also has the sweet malt smell. Taste like someone took a nice helles lager and put a couple slices of bacon in it. Very interesting. Would go great with some smoked tenderloin. Has pretty good mouthfeel. This beer isnt for everyone but I like it and will look for it again."
"The mouth is light with crisp carbonation. This is one hell of a session beer as it perfectly balances flavor with low alcohol and damn near perfect drinkability. I am buying more next week. This would be a great one to sip in front of a camp fire."
"The taste of this beer is considerably more complex. First off on the palate is smokiness, but that soon gives way to a typical helles bitterness, then a bready malt note, and finally a slightly hoppy, bitter, pin-prick finish. Through all this, this beer slips over the tongue unsubstantially with great smoothness. The smoke flavor doesn't get in the way at all; this beer remains highly drinkable, albeit with a smokey twist that increases its element of interest and/or mystery. Very interesting beer."
"Drinkability  If you dont like the Rauchbier style I would stay away from this one, even though the smoke here is quite subdued. If you like or even dont mind some good smoke in your Helles Lager then be sure to pick up a few bottles of this."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Light to medium in the mouth, and effortless to drink. What a great alternative for this summer."
"drinkable through the roof and like jcalbi said, an awesome session brew. anyone who finds this on tap would benefit karmically from letting me know where they found it."
"The smell is essentially malty, with light roasted notes, a bit like roasted corn. Sweet with some burnt caramel. The taste gets quite enjoyable: a good lager, showing a round and smooth maltiness, combined with interesting notes of smoke. Some sweet fruitiness too, citrus, some orange peel, hints of lemon, with a light dry hoppy grapefruity finish. Well balanced, a more than decent brew by Schlenkerla."
"Drinkability: Although very rich, I could see myself drinking several of these in a row."
"Nobbad, quite enjoyed it. Lightly smoked, bacon flavour, dry-ish, slightly herbal hops finish, a bit salty aswell. Not as heavily smoky as there other beers, which on one hand makes it easier to drink, but on the other hand its less flavourfull and less complex. I think i prefer the Marzen a lot more.(Draught- GBBF 03')"
