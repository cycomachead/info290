"Overall: 3.8 Not bad, but nothing extremely special"

"Overall it is clear that lagers are not a strong point for 3F's. They should stick to what they are good at IPAs, PAs, you get the idea."
""
"O - An illustration of what a traditional brew would look like if done by 3 Floyds. Honestly, this kind of lager is not my go to drink, so while I thought it was well done, I probably would not opt for it again."

"O- Good for the german lager style. Not my go-to style, so I may be under-rating this beer."

" The style is d efinitely not my favorite, but I think this was a nicely done Helles."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is right on the scent with strong bread and cracker flavor. Ultra crisp on the tongue it is a fine example of the German style lager that have existed for so long."

"O: Maybe because i was in the mood for a lager but i really enjoyed this. Wish it came in 6 packs because the drinkability is ridiculously high on the beer. Very clean and crisp. / 87"

""
""
"O: 3.5 this is a refreshing beer for a hot day, but not one I would seek out."
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with non-prickly medium-low levels of carbonation. The carbonatoin creates an initially fizzy, then smooth and cremay overall mouthfeel. Finishes dry, with just a little stickiness remaining on the lips."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours hazy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger fluffy bright white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, grass, orange, cracker, bready grain, floral, pepper, and herbal hops. Damn nice aromas with good strength and balance of hop/malt notes. Taste of lemon, pear, pepper, orange zest, apple, cracker, bready grain, grass, floral, and herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of citrus, light fruit, pepper, cracker, bready grain, grass, floral, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice flavor balance with good complexity; very hoppy but still has nice malt balance; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent helles lager! Great flavor balance with good complexity; extremely smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering as expected."

"German lagers aren't my thing but I've learned to appreciate the use of Noble hops. Overall, it's an easy drinker. It's crisp and refreshing, making it ideal for a warm day. It's also relatively low (by today's standards) in alcohol so you can sit back and enjoy several and not end up in jail."

"Overall - Decent, a rather safe and solid beer, nothing off the wall that FFF is famous for. Its balanced, light, low alcohol and easy to enjoy. Right on par for the style. Worth a drink for the style."
"O - Citrusy and fruity, lager not my favorite style. I liked this one."
""
""
""
"I don't understand why this beer is still brewed when Zombie Dust is vastly superior in every regard and only marginally stronger. Though I suppose if you want a FFF beer that tastes like nothing, Gorch hits the jackpot."
""
""
""
""
"O - Very good example of a Helles lager here. Also pretty ""normal"" for the ""it's not normal"" brewery. I would put this up to a Surly Hell any day. Perfect beer for a summer day. I thought this beer was a perfect balance of sweetness, hops, and malt. Very drinkable and will do it again if i can find another bottle."

"Gorch Fock is a somewhat unusual release from Three Floyds. It actually is…pretty normal. It’s very consistent with the style and doesn’t have anything out of the ordinary going on at all. Nevertheless, it’s very good stuff. Definitely worth checking out."
""
""
""
"Overall: Three Floyds with a deft hand. This is awe."
""
""
"Overall: Ok, won't get again."
"very easy drinking, great light complexity. very easy drinking."
""
"Pours a moderately dark yellow with a nice white head. Smell is doughy, sweet malt with traces of hops. Fairly simple but well executed. Taste is quite as clean. Mouthfeel is light to medium with good carbonation and nice body. Good drinkability but not my favorte Three Floyds beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: The Helles Lager isn't a very interesting style, but for what this beer is, it's great. Certainly kills any BMC beer out there and would be a great beer to get a friend into the world of craft."

"A very good helles lager. Well balanced with good noble hops. Nice and complete on the feel with good depth, but lacking some on flavors."

""

"A good helles, not world class by any means"
""
"O- A very enjoyable beer. I could see this being very awesome on a hot summer day. Very unique for a three floyds beer, definitely their least ""weird""/most normal beer. It's good to see they didn't try to overload this one with hops like they do for many of their selections. I would definitely buy this again if it weren't for the hefty price."
""
"Feels crisp, and loaded with cereal grains. Slight skunk flavor, but not as much as I would have thought for its age. So crisp and clean. Almost feels like a slightly heavy Kolsch. Reminds of a more crisp and clean Warsteiner Premium Verum."
""
""
""
""
"A very good helles lager, one of the better I've had, which isn't a whole lot admittedly. Crisp and highly drinkable."
""
""
""
"M. Lighter side of medium body, well carbonated, crisp yet smooth finish. Very nice mouthfeel."

"O- I wasnt sure on what to think of this beer because I wasn't too familiar with the style but Damn its good. Its super drinkable and has a great taste that's totally new for me. I really wish Floyds was cheaper because their/this beer is amazing, as always."

"The aroma was light. Some small amount of smoked in it, with lots of grain and bready malts, though I have to admit, not much here to really pick up on. The flavor was a bit better. Lots of campfire like smokiness in it, with a subtle, yet easily definable bready malt base. Some sweetness, caramel maybe and a light peach flavor when cold that quickly gets burnt out by the smoked and roasted malts"

"Overall, good beer again. Not the best in its class, but a solid beer that I would be proud to call my own. It must be hard to try and recreate such a style that has been brewed by genius brewmasters in Europe for centuries. All in all, I don't think I would buy this beer again, though if I were at a bar and this were available, it would be something I would consider getting with friends."
"if i could buy this in six-packs i would keep more of this in the house during the summer."
"Light body with some good carbonation that is nice for this style. Very clean and easy to drink beer, with some decent flavor though I would have like a little more floral hopping on the nose and taste."
"O: Thought this was a pretty solid lager. And you don't often find a well made Helles from a US brewery."
"O: Nice overall; I feel it could use a bit more in the hops department."
"I did not know Three Floyds could brew such a subtle, clean beer. They really showed their craftmenship with this beer."
"O - Light style of beer and just not what i like. Its good for its style but i just prefer things that are more complex."
"Beer is medium in body, leads off with a little pilsner sweetness, bigger body than expected but still has a dry finish, nice little session lager here. Sweet, mildly bitter, probably about 25 IBU on the backend there. Nice, I'd have this beer again."
"Overall: Three Floyds claims that this beer is as traditional as they'll ever get. Not a bad choice for those seeking a crisp and refreshing lager with low alcohol, while still maintaining a taste and complexity that can't be matched by the macros."
"Crisp, tender, medium bodied, with a wholesome, smooth, easy going texture and carbontation that's lightly bready sweet and just dry and crisp enough to add some welcome depth. Leaves the mouth with a light biscuity fluffy dryness and crisp grainy texture. And definately leaves you wanting more. Very drinkable stuff. As most Helles lagers are; and this 3F creation is no different and fitting within the scope of most 3F brews that hit the mark for style."
"Another solid offering from 3F showing they can hold back and make a great light style as well though it's nothing special. It's been a couple years since I first had this and I was pleasantly surprised."
"Lighter bodied, ample carbonation. Easy drinking, pretty much spot on."
"Crisp, light finish that drinks very easily. A superb beer that is a nice change of pace for 3Floyds."
"Overall-- a shockingly traditional tale on a beer from the FFF gang... It works thanks to the extra bitterness. All in all, this is fairly drinkable. It's a style I don't go for much, and this beer hasn't persuaded me to start buying or drinking more of them-- but it is enjoyable nonetheless."
"I've constantly missed out on the bottled version of this (or, rather, I've always gone with a different bottle until it disappeared from shelves), so it was nice to see it on tap when I made my long-awaited return to the Firkin. It pours a clear straw topped by a finger of sturdy white foam. The nose comprises green apple skin, honey, and light pineapple. I honestly didn't see that much fruit coming... The taste holds notes of sourdough, orange rind, lemon zest, honey, and bitter greens. The body straddles the border between heavy light and light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a creamy feel. Overall, a nice brew, but one that doesn't really excite me too much. Still a pleasant drink, though..."
"O - Good example of a helles lager."
"Seems a bit higher than 4.5%."
"o - overall, this is a style that is new to me, so i can't give great commentary on how this beer stacks up for the style, but what i can say is that i enjoyed it. very german lagery with a touch of pilsner."
"When reviewing beers, I always try to judge them by the style and not by how much I like that particular style. I don't buy a lot of Helles Lager (I prefer American-style IPAs, porters, and stouts), but a Helles Lager is what this is and it would be unfair to bash it simply because I'm not a huge fan of Helles Lagers. That said, I will simply say that this was a really good Helles Lager and I probably won't buy it again for a long, long time."
"O: Very nice, especially on a nice summer night like tonight. I would recommend this, and purchase it again, but the price was a little too much for the style. A very good introductory craft brew for beginners."
"This beer pours a light straw color with a loose head. It smells grassy and clean. The taste is pleasant and refreshing and the mouthfeel accentuates these qualities. The finish is fast and clean. This beer is an easy drinker. Not one of my top lagers, but it is not bad."
"O - A summer release for sure as it probably wouldn't be as enjoyable on days other than 100 degree ones. But it was crisp and refreshing, but nothing overpowering. For a lager, it was more well rounded than most, but some more subtle flavors needed to be present to make this more addicting."
"Overall- This is Three Floyds!?!? I have had a recent lager renaissance, and this one just seems dull in comparison to most. A relatively “simple”, traditional style, but I feel they missed the mark on this one. I don’t think there should be any diacetyl in this style. Their patented citrus hop twist would have been welcomed by me. Well, they all can’t be winners."
"Overall -- Slightly better than average for the style, but I'm just not thrilled. Where's the interesting FFF slant on the classic style? Easily my least favorite FFF seasonal, not because it is a lager, but because it is so uninspired."
"O: I find Gorch Fock to be a pleasant, sessionable beer that, while not typical of style, falls well within its parameters. A really well-made lager that I highly recommend. "
"O: A spirited attempt at a non-traditional style; the results of which I thoroughly enjoyed. While it might not take the prize from Weihenstephaner (which I wasn’t expecting in the least), it definitely gives the Midwest an excellent example of this often overlooked European style. And if you can produce a good Helles, it says loads about your brewery, in my opinion. Just another reason why the boys in Munster should be proud."
"Pours a clear, gold color. Two inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of citrus hops, slight grain, slight wheat, sweet malt, and slight pale malt. Fits the style of a Munich Helles Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with a high carbonation level. Tastes of slight citrus hops, sweet malt, pale malt, hint of grain, hint of earthy malt, and slight alcohol. Overall, good appearance, body, and blend."
"O- the price was a bit high for this. that being said, its still a fantastic summer time beer and a great example of a daintier german style beer. id love to have this available in a sixer for a more modest price."
"O- I am interested in trying this again. I wonder if I had an older bottle because after talking with other BAs and enthusiasts and they all enjoyed it. I typically enjoy drinking the style and this one smelled correctly."
" Overall Like I said before I don't know if this is a old bottle. But It was just ok nothing special.Wasnt terrible but i would not be seeking this one out again."
"I'm a little let down though - bought this - 8 bucks for a 22oz - expecting something special from three floyds - nothin' special."
"D: One of my least favorite Three Floyds. I have had better in this style; just didn't work for me. Not awful, but no need to seek this out."
"Honestly, I was a bit disappointed with this one. It's good but I've grown to expect more from FFF."
"D- I poured the rest of this down the drain. For $9.99 a bottle I would expect something way better."
"I love FFF's but this isn't the one to go out of your way for by any stretch."
"Drinkablity is so-so, with the super bone dry finish being too much, as well as overboard on carbonation. The slight sticky mouth feel also takes away a bit, but no real off flavors, and drinks well at 4.5%. Not my favorite of the Three Floyds beers."
"Pours a nice semi hazy orange to gold color with a fizze 1 finger head and plenty of carbonation. Pretty good looking pour. Smells of sweet malts with biscuits and hops. Not overpowering but smells pretty good. Taste is delicious. This held up pretty well. Nice sweet malt finish with doughs and herbal notes up front. Mouthfeel is semi thin with lots of carbonation. Drinkability is solid. I really enjoyed this brew and would love to grab some fresh this spring if it is released still?"
"Another winner from fff. A delicious lager that has a very clean finish. I can really only define this as how a macro lager shoud taste. A malty backbone compliments a hoppy finish. Overall real tASFY beer that ahpuld peobably become a year round brew"
"Pours a moderately dark yellow with a nice white head. Smell is doughy, sweet malt with traces of hops. Fairly simple but well executed. Taste is quite as clean. Mouthfeel is light to medium with good carbonation and nice body. Good drinkability but not my favorte Three Floyds beer."
"Torn envelope reveals what I already suspected. Time to cross this one off my wants. This might just be one of the best I've had of the style. Thanks Jamnes."
"D- This was a light and refreshing beer. The fact that this came from FFF makes me impressed with Floyds as a whole. They know what they are doing with styles and when they want to make something that follows the guide lines then they do a damn good job of doing it."
"the highest rated part. could easily down a few bombers of this in a night. low alochol and lightbodied makes it go down fast and smooth."
"Overall: Not exactly the type of beer FFF is know for, but I've never known these guys to faulter, no matter what they do!"
"Very drinkable and would be perfect for a nice warm day like today sitting out in the back yard."
"Gorch Fock is a pretty drinkable, traditional Munich Helles Lager that I am glad I got to try once. I could use a little bit more spicy hops though. Also, I have to say that I will never buy this beer again, because at ten bucks a bomber there are better, cheaper options."
"This is a great beer to enjoy cold in warm weather."
"D - Highly drinkable, very sessionable. This is probably one of the best lagers I've had in a long time. It's a hard style to make a good beer in, but FFF has done a great job on this one."
"I found this to be a very engaging beer. Pour was light copper with moderate head. Very smooth up front, with toasted grain and honey sweetness, quickly ramping down on a slighty tart glide to a finishing moderate bitterness. The beer is bigger than the classic style, but close enough within the bounds to be a legitimate classification. Drinkability was very good."
"A tasty lightish lager that shines in it's hop fragrance but turns into a sweeter grainy taste otherwise. Breadiness returns in the aftertaste."
"D - I like to envision the eponymous author sailing the eponymous ship in Valhalla when I drink this brew; it makes it even better."
"Drinkability is the only thing aggressive about this beer. I know a number of people are disappointed in this one, but I have to say, I am supremely impressed by 3F. This is a wholly serviceable Helles, and I certainly applaud them for making such a beautiful summertime thirst quencher."
"Not bad, but nothing special which is odd for 3 Floyds. Poured with a smallish, cream colored, short lived head and no lace. Color is an almost clear amber. Aroma is malt, cereal, fresh beer, fresh cut grass. Color is malt, grain, slighlty bitter, more sweet. Body is a touch on the heavy side, ok carbonation. Finish is like flavor. Wouldn't pay this much money again for a beer like this."
"This ones a pounder for sure. I think a one liter mug is in order."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a pilsner glass, the beer pours a somewhat cloudy gold color with a couple inch frothy white head. Head retention is good, lacing is decent. Aroma is mostly bready malt and floral hops, but I also pick up a little bit of a citrusy aroma. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some spicy hops. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's crisp, refreshing, and is well carbonated. The soft carbonation helps make this an easy brew to drink. It would be pretty nice to drink on a hot day. I think this is a decent overall brew, I liked it."
"This is a reasonably drinkable beer that I can see enjoying occasionally, but nothing that particularly stands out. It is also not quite warm enough outside, yet, which may improve the overall experience."
"Found a bottle of this out in Hudson over the weekend. Pours a nice deep golden yellow with a nice white head. Smells of sweetness with slight fruit notes. Taste is very smooth, slight sweet with a subtle bitterness at the end. Very solid overall. Also come with a sweet label!"
"Had on tap 1.5 years later and not so great."
"poured from a 22 oz bomber ..pours a pils yellow with a quick dissa pating head that leaves a white ring and very little lacing..the smell is floral crisp hops with german malts and a bready smell..the taste is sweet and floral and crisp with a nice malt finish..i taste the hops in this one and the malts its nicely balanced flavorful and drinkable its medium bodied crisp and clean a good pils/lager/helles.as always 3fff adds a little extra to the style and this one is no exception would like to see these in sixers i could put a few of these away in the summer time"
"Mouthfeel is light and carbonation is above average. Drinkability is pretty good, it's light crisp, refreshing and also pretty good tasting. It's not something I would buy very often, but it's a good representation of the style."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent sessionable lighter lager that is worth pounding down for a long time."
"D: Not a bad beer but think it is not my style."
"D - This is extremely drinkable, but I'm not sure I want another. Rather boring overall. However, this style is not known for being overly complex."
"I was on a 3 Floyds kick and decided to give this on a try as well. After Alpha King and Gumball Head, I was hoping for another homerun. Instead, what I got was a beer that felt very ordinary in comparison. It poured out a nice golden color and the nose was okay but nothing overly inticing. The first drink was slighty disappointing, seemingly just another import lager. However, as I continued to drink this seeminginly boring lager, caramel and buttery flavors emerged and its dry almost spicy finish made each drink more enjoyable. While not a great invidual beer, I could see this being a spectacular session beer."
"Well done version of a Helles, with a crisp yet easy feel and enough spicy hops to help balance a lot of that big sweetness. Nothing really abnormal here (per the usual M.O. of FFF), just a flavorful and nice drinking Lager."
"Cloudy muddled mess of a beer. Deep golden body with a murkiness that I've not seen in a helles lager before. Nice waft sof warm bready and biscuity malt aromas arise from the beer right after the pour. Also some sweet adjunct like smellls. Solid flavor of gentle bready maltiness. Overall sweetness is held in check and I don't get any adjunct like flavors. Hops merely balance. Maybe add just a bit of a ghostly pepper note. Slight fruitiness is noted. Body is round and hefty...medium to medium-full. Moderately carbonated and easy to drink. Solid, flavorful beer."
"not quite as badass as i have come to expect from most of FFF's brews, though that can't be said to count against it"
"Overall a great session beer from the boys at 3 floyds. I could definatley sit back with a sixer of this beer."
"Drink: Highly drinkable. Could happily session with this beer."
"This beer could be a staple in my fridge, however, I'm taken back by the price for a 22 ounce bomber bottle at $9.50 from my supplier which makes it awfully pricey for what you get here."
"D - Smooth, flavorful and easy to drink. A nice summer beer."
"D: A really, really good Helles lager that gives Weihenstephaner Original a run for its money. An unsung member of the FFF family."
"Pours a medium/deep gold with a moderate sized head that quickly diminishes and leaves little if any lacing. Smells of straw and hops, but it is subtle. Very good taste of slightly spicy hoppiness and citrus notes. Good mouthfeel with rounded yet full presence. This is a very drinkable beer, especially in warmer, sumer weather. Though I consider the brewery a local one, I am not necessarily the biggest Three Floyd's fan. This, however, is a very solid brew that I heartily recommend."
"D - Very drinkable. Great for the style and pretty solid overall."
"No head of which to speak. Color was a hazy golden-yellow. Nose smelled of Saaz hops. Lager? OK, but more like a German Pils. Mouthfeel was medium with a Saaz-hops flavor on the tongue. Finish was mild, banana-ish, Saaz-y, a little Hefeweizen. An interesting mix of a number of styles."
"Rotation: not available here. If it was, I could see getting this once maybe twice a season. Maybe more if in 6 packs. Would try on tap for sure."
"Then I tasted it and realized it was a Helles. An immensely flavorful Helles, but not particularly innovative. Still gorgeously brewed: big botanicals start things off with nodes of grass and pollen, moving into a dry hop middle and ending on sour hops and light flowers. Really nice, well done."
"D: An easy drinker that could easily be sessionable. However, the lack of hop character from a 3F brew is a bit disappointing. I wouldn't consider it 100% true to the style, but it does add a bit more flavor than the average Munich lager."
"D- Easy to drink just not my favorite from three Floyds."
"I poured this into a pilsiner glass. The color is a classic golden, however more cloudy than I expected. The head was fluffy and white and reduced rather quickly. The nose is bready and slightly skunky. The taste is light and refreshing, almost has what I would consider Kolsch characteristics. It is well balanced good cereal malt with a nice hop balance. The mouthfeel is crisp but not thin. This beer is quite drinkable. Again, I feel I paid too much for this beer, at $10.99 for a bomber, I could do a lot better with comparable imports. I guess Three Floyds has got my number since I buy every bottle they put out, but most of them only once. Cmon guys, I understand big prices for your big beers, but 22oz of Lager, that's a little steep."
"Served in a pint glass. Had a clear pale golden color with a medium sized white head. Smells slightly of a German Yeast Strain and sulfur. Taste was very sweet, bread-like character with a hint of fresh grain in the finish. Bitterness levels match up to balance the beer. Decent mouthfeel, carbonation levels are nice and low. Quite drinkable, low alcohol content makes this a good session beer. One of the best Helles style lagers I've had."
"I'm not sure why I didn't try this one sooner, perhaps it's the $8.50 price tag for a Helles lager? It's actually as good or better than many authentic German versions. Great beer, though it would be way more appealing if it was available in six packs at a decent price. It would probably be my main session beer then."
"Drinkability: A pleasant, surprisingly authentic helles. Pass the knockwurst and hot German potato salad, please!"
"Overall, not the best example, but OK drinking. Don't break your back to get this, but check it out if available."
"A bit bland looking, but otherwise, this is a great session lager in my opinion. It's a interesting stretch from Three Floyds. It shows more restraint and modesty then most of their beers. It reminded me a lot of Prima Pils from Victory and there is nothing wrong with that. The grassy hops flavor added to both the smell and the flavor. This is a summer beer, perfect for a picnic."
"Pours a hazey and very light beige mixed with light amber, and hay yellow. Not much head or foam period. Rich pilsner malt of mild toastiness in the aroma. Great grassy hop aroma gives the scent an earthy aire. Flavors of toasted malt overall, but also piney, grassy, and some faint unwashed strawberry from Jewel come through. Great malty, earthy, and semi-dry mouthfeel make this helles super sessionable."
"D- Very drinkable. If this was available in Texas during the summer, I could kill a few of these on a hot summer day."
"D: Could definitely enjoy a few, as with most any brew from FFF."
"Definitely drinkable."
"Very drinkable."
"The aroma is typical for the style with corn like malt and grassy malt. The appearance is golden with a large head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is average for the style. Overall this is pretty typical of the style. I know it's a quality beer but I would pass on this."
"Mouthfeel was slick and somewhat prickly. Medium bodied."
"D: Good brew, could definitely drink a case of this in a sitting, it's definitely not one of those beers you can only have a couple of."
"Drinkability: I could definitely knock back a few more of these. Citrus and melon assert themselves more as the session continues. This is the perfect fit for a warm winter day in San Luis Obispo."
"D: Very drinkable. I'd be content with another bottle or two."
"Poured a clear yellow with no head. Slight aroma of sweet melon with some light spice. Light bodied on the taste with a touch of honey sweetness on the nose. Crisp & clean with a nice hop bitterness. Very easy drinking."
"D: It's light but not good enough to want to drink."
"D- This is a great fall lager. I am really impressed with this. Too bad it wasn't cheaper."
"Overall, good, but too bland to warrant another try."
"D: It is a tasty brew that is easy on the tongue and light on the ABV. It would make for a great session beer."
"D= Like the big boys say, this beer tastes great and is less filling. Not my favorite style due to its muted flavors and aromas, but I can certainly appreciate the craftsmanship here. This beer would pair very well with food, and at 4.5% abv, its certainly sessionable."
"Okay, so it's not as left-of-center, style-wise, as something like Gumballhead. And not your typical Three Floyds offering in any way. It's not overloaded with hops and/or alcohol, but very much like most other Three Floyds stuff in that it's a quality product, expertly conceived and lovingly crafted. The name and label, as with all 3F stuff, is just awesome icing on a tasty cake."
"D: Superbly drinkable. Don't mistake this for a 'bland' lager; this has a wonderful complexity. Excellent for sipping, outstanding 'session' potential. Well done version of the style. Would love to have this available; I'd get it again without question."
"Pours a slightly hazed pale golden with a small white. Aroma is medium sweet with some grass, light fruit and bread. Flavor is bread, fruit, light grass and light citrus. Light body, very clean texture. Something a little out of the normal for three floyds but altogether a good beer."
"The body is light to moderate. A bit full for style. Overall, if I were to judge this I would say that it fermented to high with too much finishing hops and too much malt. As a consumer though, this is definitely pushing the style to more of an America character with more body and flavor."
"Pours a orange-ish/ copper color with a small white head. In the aroma, a grainy, small sweet malt. In the taste, a small sweet maltiness, and fresh. A smooth and medium mouthfeel, with a small semi dry to clean aftertaste. Very fresh, cleanand nice, with just a touch of fruit."
"D-A lager from FFF...and they do it up the FFF way with a bit more hops and character than is usual....and of course it works! A good beer overall, when added together, the sum is greater than the parts! Wish I would have bought more of this..."
"Prost!"
"Really a dead ringer for the style and a damn tasty lager, though I don't know if it's so good that I would pay another 9 bucks for a bomber. Never-the-less, really well done."
"The descriptor for the aroma is nearly identical to the flavor. Cereal grains show through more however with a slight sweetness that really shines through on the finish. Lightly hopped to match the malt and give a hint of bitterness on the end. An unbelievably easy drinking helles bock showing good carbonation with a creamy middle."
"D - Nice drinkable Helles from FFF that's sweet, but not overbearing. Very nice sutble flavors in this brew all work together quite well."
"Prost prost Kameraden Prost Prost. MK"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" white head over the slightly cloudy bright golden brew. Head quickly recedes to a thin layer of bubbles, with little to no lacing. Aroma is balanced, with biscuity character. Taste is lightly sweet upfront, balanced in the middle, with a crisp, clean close. Mouthfeel and drinkability are superb. Could drink many of these, nice to see FFF does something besides the in-your-face brews we always hear about."
"pours a nice golden yellow (straw-like) color, although with very little head, almost no lacing, and a lot of lasting carbonation. Nice scent, a very clean and malty aroma, although it is a very weak scent. Excellent taste, very clean and refreshing, very malty with just a little hint of peppery spiciness. Nice feel, quite smooth, with just a little roughness from the overcarbonation. A good beer, a nice Helles, but not 3F's best."
"Overall a tasty and easy drinking lager. The sweetness was a bit annoying, but not too overpowering."
"I've had the pleasure of drinking many helles lagers in Munich so I was hoping that 3F would keep to the style with this. In my opinion they did an excellent job of not getting all hoppy on it, this was a very good helles lager."
"Pours a somewhat foggy light golden hue with a one finger white head that quickly dies down to a whispy layer of foam. Lots of bubbles racing to the top of the glass with virtually no lacing left on the sides. Smell begins with faint grains, lemon, and honey. You really have to dig your nose deep just to get these aromas, so unfortunately this is about it. Taste starts off with a buttery biscuit like malt with a hint of lemon. Toasted grains some noble hops midway on the tongue. Aftertaste is moist with honey, fresh cut grass, a pinch of pepper. Light, smooth, and creamy in the mouth with a steady but subtle carbonation. Not a bad beer, but nothing I'd seek out again."
"Thanks again, 3F's, for another fine interpretation of a beer style."
"D: Why would i want another? I doubt that this style is as poor as this beer is - I'm going to have to look for another"
"By the way, if I'm the marketing director I start selling ""Gorch Fock Yourself"" T-shirts."
"Pours a crystal clear light golden color with a smallish white head that leaves quickly. Aroma is mild malts some spicy and floral hops and a little diacetyl in there too. Taste is sweet and bready malts. Body is medium with a sharp carbonation tickle on the tongue. Not a bad brew, not my favorite as I think its a bit sweet."
"D: Oh yeah! At 4.5%, this tasty bad boy will be enjoyable for quite a time."
"Bottle courtesy of iconoklaztor: Poured a clear golden yellow color lager with a medium foamy head with limited retention and no lacing. Aroma of sweet lightly floral malt with limited hops presence which I the biggest surprise coming from a brewery renowned for hopping every beer to the maximum level. Taste is also dominated by some sweet and lightly floral notes with a minimal amount of crisp hops at the end. Full body with average carbonation. Good take on the style form a brewery not usually known for sticking to style."
"Glad I picked one of these up. If they were more readily available here, I could easily see drinking more."
"D - I must say, I'm surprised that FFF pulled in the reins so hard on one of their beers to keep in in-style at under 5% ABV instead of pushing the envelope like they normally do. This is highly drinkable and very well balanced."
"The mouthfeel is very crisp and light in body. The flavors meld wonderfully over the palate. Subtlety is a beautiful thing. I could drink this beer all day. This 22oz. bottle will go down within the next 5 minutes, I reckon."
"A light golden to straw color, with a small white head forming, but it quickly dissolve away. There is strong visibility of carbonation. A slight grassy scent at first, followed by a strong bready, cracked grain aroma. That bready fragrance, is strong at the first taste. It quickly blends itself with mild bitterness of citrus and grassy flavors. A watery feel at first, carbonation does become prevalent halfway across the palate. It has the classic feel of a very good lager crisp, with a dry finish. A surprise from FFF, this beer sticks to the style very well, though a little thinner of a feel than expected. It is still a very good beer, would be good some steamed seafood."
"D: Nice flavor overall with good balance. This beer is anything but thrilling but makes for a decent beverage."
"Very drinkable - pretty light with good flavor, smooth, nice dry and clean finish. I want another!"
"Definitely the best example of this style. Very impressive and from an American brewer!!"
"Taste is strong of pine, grass, pilsner funk. No noticable alcohol, no surprise at 4.5%. Feels a little thin but leaves a nice hoppy aftertaste that sticks around a while. Lagers aren't my choice of beer but this one seems pretty well done."
"D- Keeping the style in mind this is a really good beer. I wouldn't usually buy this beer but for a time where it calls for a nice lager this would be the one I would seek out. Probably the best lighter lager I have had so IMO Three Floyds are staying strong with another good offering for a great session beer."
"Overall: Three Floyd's is in my opinion the best brewery in the US and possibly the world. This beer, sadly, let me down. Thank god I have a Dark Lord to get my hopes back up! I would say try it for the experience but don't get your hopes up!"
"Gorch Fock is one of the best Munich helles lagers that I've ever had. It proves the point (that didn't need proving) that Three Floyds is anything but a 'dump in a massive amount of hops and see what happens' kind of brewery. These guys are craftsmen, dammit. Forgetting the German origins of this beer for a moment, they're also one of the best brewers of 'American style' beer on the planet. Maybe *the* best."
"What a change of pace for Three Floyds here. I really like this one, but as other reviewers point out it's a bit pricy. Very accessible and highly sessionable if the price wasn't so steep."
"i was very surprised at how mediocre this was considering i worship 3Fs. it's probably the first of their offerings that didn't blow me away or was at least an interesting and tasty interpretion of a beer style. i could sum this up quickly by saying that it's a standard helles lager, but i'll go on...this poured a pale gold with a chill haze and a minimal white head that diminished very quickly. some nice bready malt aromas and maybe a hint of grassy hops in the nose. some sweet malts balanced out by the underlying hops and carbonation. mouthfeel is fine. drinkable at this abv. i'm wondering why they bottled such a run of the mill beer when i've had much better offerings at the pub...admiral lord nelson, for example. also, this is way overpriced at $7 a bomber. you could get a sixer of spaten for that, which is not much different and a bit better."
"Here's to you MJ.{toast/touch glass}"
"D- This beer has a nice smooth flavor and with a slightly stronger taste of hops than malt. The flavor and aroma are both very light and there isn’t much depth to either of them and I don’t get that fresh malt and hops flavor that I like to see in lagers."
"Slightly lacking in vitality although the thickness seems about right. The taste is excellent however and my recent fling with German beer leaves me finding this a very welcome interpretation of the style. Think Gumballhead goes to Bavaria."
"D: Pretty refreshing. Not my favorite style of beer, but for what it is, it's pretty darn good."
"Drinkability - this is decent beer, but not inspiring, so to me it is not sessionable."
"On tap at Three Floyds Brewpub, and served in a pint glass. This beer poured a clear, golden color with a small, beige head. The aroma was made up of bread, very light pine, and some lemony citrus notes. The flavor was also very mild and included light bready yeast and citrus. The mouthfeel was light and had a small dose of carbonation. A solid representation of the style. Worth a try."
"Poured a hazy yellow, with a nice white head on top. Smell was of faint floral, spice and a little yeast. Taste was crisp, dry and of spicy hop. Very drinkable, I had no problem sitting back with this one while waiting for food, it was rather ""light"" compared to most of the other offerings by 3 Floyds, and for that I enjoyed it, sessionable I'd say."
"Enters the mouth mellow nutty rich. Well balanced even nutty richness on the palate that yeilds to a bold boppy bitter finish. Bitter feel stays on mouth maybe a little to much."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp. Easy drinking and quite refreshing. A good change of pace from all the huge beers I was sampling earlier in the day. I look forward to some more interesting brews from the ever expanding Floyds. (Plus it's hard to resist telling your buddies to Gorch Fock off) :-)"
"The light body and firm carbonation combine to make a really nice warm weather refresher."
