3.88,6.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"330 ml bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy pale straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of clean pale malt, earthy hops, and light yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and clean finish that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Munich Helles lager. All around good balance and robustness of clean pale malt and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 21, 2014"

Smells of pale malt, sweet malt, yeast, dark citrus, and slight raisin. Fits the style of a Light Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, sweet malt, pale malt, slight hops, slight roasted malt, and a dark citrus. Overall, a surprisingly good light lager with lots of body and a good blend.","Tone","Feb 18, 2009"

4.07,12.1,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Well, a new favorite. Very enjoyable German Lager. Though most are average, this is a standout. Citrus and herbal aromas abound from an almost sparkling carbonation, and through a bleached white 1/2" head. The hops make a better than usual presence--noble in quality. Tastes moderately malty and not as grainy as expected. No real vegitol flavors detected at all. Instead, a lemony, grapefruity, orange peel like flavor abounds. Condensed with solid hop bittering makes for a very clean, crisp and smooth beer. The body is moderate to light, not to weigh too heavily on the mouth. This is a very good beer for the style.","BEERchitect","Sep 12, 2005"

3.76,3.6,4,3,4,4,4,"Had a bottle of this this past weekend at the Sunset. No freshness date, so maybe I was taking a chance, but luckily the brown bottle was there to help. I have to say, this beer tasted mighty fresh. Clear light gold with a thin white head. Original impression of some sweet corn like notes in the aroma (not off-putting) later evolved into some more grape-skin like complexity, is that Munich Malt. Cool. Beer was light and darn easy to drink, a real session brew. Some sweetness, not over the top thank god, with some pleasant toast points in the finish.","PatandDavid","May 01, 2004"

There is some tangy fruit in the nose, with some nice schpoonk. A little corn syrup. Fruity in the front. Roasty crackers. It gets quite malty in the middle, finishing crisply bitter with some corn. It's a tasty, light lager. Enough malt and some nice grainsiness.","kbub6f","Beers"
2.98,-17.9,3,2.5,3,3,3.5,"The aroma is a bit lemony, some pale malts, overall pretty light. Bright white head poured nice and thick, faded to a film eventually leaving a tiny bit of lace. Not much in the flavor department, maybe a little wheat with a splash of lemon. Very light body, clean finish. This would be very refreshing served nice and cold on a summer day, but otherwise just pick up a Busch and rub a lemon around the edge of the can.","HappyHourHero","0"
