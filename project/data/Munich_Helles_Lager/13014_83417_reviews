"Lots of heat with this one. And it is good too."

"Overall, my wife, who is a miller lite fan, and tells me she is really trying to like ""my"" beers, loved this one. I ordered her a 8oz Hell.  She ordered a 12oz Firey Hell with the meal."

"Overall, this is a nicely approachable chili pepper beer.  From the very first sippable pull of the liquid into your mouth the spicy oiliness becomes apparent.  By the end of the sip you can find some relatively decent heat packed into the flavor.  This is particularly true of the aftertaste, which tends to linger, even after it is long gone from the palate.  The pepper, which seems commercially comparable to a smoky habanero (even though it isn’t), builds nicely upon the basic base Munich helles malt profile.  It actually improves the base, rather than muddying it or obscuring it.  You keep that bittered, crisp grain profile, which deviates from many hotter chili beers that try to meet the heat with more of a sweeter, cream ale style grain profile, or a hoppier wash.  Don’t expect a beer like Crime or Punishment to kick you to the curb; take in the milder heat, enjoying it for what it is.  This is German, and Minnesotan, and well-done.  Good on you, Surly."
"O-thought this was very good not a big pepper fan but i liked this one its worth a try fir sure"
"I like the base beer a lot.  In many of the pepper beers I've had (by other brewers), the pepper (and usually its heat) overwhelms the base beer instead of harmonizing with it.  Here, the pepper is nicely integrated, it is quite strong but it isn't too fiery nor is it overwhelming.  I don't like it as much as Hell on its own, but it is interesting and it is well-made."

"Overall, I like this better than hell. I thought the peppers and oak barrels made this beer a bit more complex. I'd drink more of this if it's around."

"I had it on tap last night at the Blue Nile. I had very little to no nose of the pepper infusion. I had a minor intial taste of pepper. The heat was subtle in the front but it had a more pronounced heat in the finish that lingered a few minutes. It was a very good beer, however if I had more than the small portion in the flight, I'm unsure how long it would take to finish. It probably didnt help that I had heat with the food prior."

"Hands down one of the best beers for pairing with pizza. A great option for food pairing."

"from Acadia's flier: blah blah (about Hell)...and then...""Cask conditioned and aged on Hickory wood and Puya chiles for a slow burn on the back of the tongue. 4.5% aBV, 12 degrees Plato, 20 IBU."
""
"Overall: The spice whacks the tongue but this is pretty good if you like extreme flavors. A nice kick to the base Hell beer. Would easily stand up to a spicy Mexican dish."

"Definitely a fest novelty that I would not particularly want to purchase in 4-pack cans but will try whenever it makes an appearance."
