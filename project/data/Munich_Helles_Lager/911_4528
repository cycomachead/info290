4.28,10.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Thanks to Thirstybird for bringing this one back from Germany. 500ml bottle served at 48 degrees in a pilsener glass. 12 09 12 indicated on the back label. Pours a translucent gold with a loose, two inch, off-white head that sizzles and pops as it slowly recedes. Tiny bubbles effervesce from the base of the glass to the underside of the cap. Nose expresses cereal grains and a light grassiness - fairly clean. Taste consistent with nose - very clean and refreshing with a light, lingering German yeast character at the back without the skunk. There's also just a kiss of noble hops to keep it from coming off as overly sweet. Mouthfeel is light and lively with a fairly clean finish. Overall - wow. I'm not too familiar with the style but this beer really hits the spot. Light and refreshing with a great balance. Really easy drinking and although not really a session beer per se, I could see myself having a few of these in a sitting.","Jwale73","Dec 11, 2011"

And this was proof to me that there's something to it besides economic success for grain growers in 16th Century Germany. 500 ml bottle hand-carried just a day ago from Germany by C,N & E (Thanks!!). Part of a multi-pack souvenir selection. They got to go to the Andechs Monastery, but this was the next best thing for those of us that didn't go to Oktoberfest. The bottle had a May 2012 freshness date. Yeah, that fresh. Deep gold in the glass with a nice frothy lemon-tinged head. Taste was rich, slick malt with a hint of fruity hops and a nice, rounded lager flavor that ended with just a touch of bitterness. Exactly the kind of beer you'd expect from a legendary German brewery. That said, there was a hint of residual oxidation (cardboard-like) flavor that surprised me because the bottles are so fresh. A common ""off flavor"" in bottled Germans, it's almost unheard-of in kegged beers. But the bottom line was that this one was fantastic; rich mouthfeel (much more so than their regular lager) and my favorite from this multi-pack. Made me wish I could taste it on tap myself someday.","tugdriver7","May 25, 2011"

4.03,4.4,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Taste is very malty with some wort notes. There is a small sweetness which makes the beer mild. The hops are nicely balanced and balance the heavy malts. Drinkability is good. The yeast is clean and produces only minor sulfur.","Absumaster","Jan 15, 2007"
3.66,-5.2,4,3,3.5,4,4.5,"Poured out a bright straw yellow clear color crowned by a big bubbly bone white head. The nose has mild straw, hopping, and malt. The taste is like a light Belgian, something like watered down mollasses, light malt, some Belgian candi, and mild hopping. Well balanced, easy drinking, and uncomplicated. Not a terribly complex beer. Finishes with a bitter crisp bite. Very refreshing, nicely carbonated mouthfeel, and extremely drinkable.","dherling","Jan 04, 2007"
3.96,2.6,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"This Helles Lager poured a clear, golden color with tall, creamy, bright white foam that persisted and clinged to the glass, leaving lace. There was good carbonation from the bottom of the glass. The smell was mildly hoppy with some floral hops notes. The taste was dry malt with some biscuity malt flavor, and balance with a good, moderate hoppiness. The mouthfeel was smooth and crisp with medium body and good carbonation. The hops came through in the finish and lingered, fading to leave a nice maltiness in the aftertaste. This was a very nice, easy to drink German lager. As with all Helles Lagers, you really have to drink them fresh to fully appreciate them.","UncleJimbo","Nov 17, 2006"

This is easily the best strong pale lager I've encountered for a long while (apart from its Czech counterparts which I still prefer). A fine and solid product, yet it could be even better (to me) if only the overall malt sweetness softens a little bit.","wl0307","Sep 06, 2006"

4.07,5.4,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Poured a short dense white head that fades slowly leaving a few whisps of lace. Clear golden-wheat colored beer is full of tiny rising bubbles. Spicy hops and crisp sweet malt aromas. Lightly sweet pale malt with and earthy bite of hops come together into a tea like flavor. Crisp, with a light fizz in the mouthfeel, and nice sharp bite in the end. A biting, juicy, pils-esque beer. A rereshing beer that isn't just for hot days.","HappyHourHero","Dec 28, 2005"

Good nose overal without too much yeastinfluence and very clean without paper or any off tastes found. Litle fine hops also reminding me of perle and halletau. Great taste also being just slight stronger then most helles. Overwelming malts with sweet caracter and further just alcohol, fine hops and cleanest taste. Fine carbonisation makes mouthfeel good.

Soft mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, moderate but decent hops well balanced with the pale malts. I am rarely ""swept away"" by a helles (nor by any other type of pale lagers, for that matter), not by this one either - but the Andechser Spezial is a well made and very drinkable helles, as far as helles go.

The taste is very very grainy with a deep bitter and thick hoppiness. The mouthfeel is a bit more complex than in the Andechser Hell, but it's still not amazing. A veil of citrus, but it's mostly grainy and dry, and not really interesting. I got bored after two sips. Even considering the style is not one of my favorite, I can't find anything exceptional in this watery beer.

The aroma was nice and hoppy, with sweet malt to balance. The mouth was mildly carbonated and slightly cloying. The taste is what it should be: nice smooth sweet malt, chased by a mild but distinct hoppy bitterness. The aftertaste is pure Goldilocks: not too bitter, not too sweet.

Crisp clean Lager nose with the malt dominate, but also present an underlying musty aroma. As you sample, the semi-sweet front is the precedent to the middling top and the bitingly carbonated finish that combined with the purposeful hop spiciness makes this a Top Notch lager. Dry as a bone aftertaste, and quite a pleasure to quaff and that is high praise from this loyal Ale fan.","Gusler","Beers"
