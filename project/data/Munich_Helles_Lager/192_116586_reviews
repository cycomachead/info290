"I'm going to proclaim this a good Helles, minor mouthfeel issues notwithstanding. This is supposed to be a low hop flavor style. Great German malt flavor. The overall ""Okay"" designation provided here is a mystery."
"Solid lager across the board, simple, complex, the hop bite is present but not overbearing, and thoroughly drinkable. Wish it was seventy degrees warmer."

"I think I got a bad one.  It did not taste right."

"Taste brings some lemon and a balancing pils malt light bready character.  Pleasant finish, slightly sweet. Simple style done fairly well though still just an old school all malt lager with a slightly more complex mouthfeel.  Easy and unobtrusive."
""
"Good lager."
""
""
""
"very unoriginal.  Leaves a pungent taste on the tongue similar to a Budweiser.  Not recommended at all, but on that note, this beer could have been way worse!"

"O - Aftertaste throws me for a loop.  A decent helles lager.  Fairly true to style.  Light.  3.25/5"

"Hay colored and crystal clear. A bit light on flavor, and ABV for the style, but not a bad overall experience. Mildly refreshing. Not all that different from living the High Life. Wish it had a bit more head."
""
""
"Overall (3.3) : This beer started off promising and kind of did a landslide from there. I would say that this is like an advanced, slightly craftier Miller High Life. Except for the fact that High Life is perfectly good on its own, so why bother? Summer Helles is probably better than some beers in the Lager category, but you may as well pick up a macro because you aren't gaining much here."
"Overall:  a highly drinkable lager.  Maybe a little sweet, but I could probably knock back quite a few of these.  I'd definitely have this again."

"O: Well done lager by New Belgium. Got this one at Krogers in Frankenmuth, MI in May, drank in New Hamburg, ON, Aug 19th, 2014."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Its a refreshing lager, duh. A little lacking on the spicey/noble hop character. Got a nice cereal malt character though. It is what it is. I've had better summer lagers (Gansett, Victory) and the german varieties are definitely superior. Youd be hard pressed to strongly detest this beer though."
""
""
""
" The taste has a mildly toasted malt character with gentle sweetness and light spice from the yeast with a floral flavor from the hops with a slight yeast flavor continuing into the finish with some mineral accents. I consider this a pretty decent lager in the sense it fits the style - not great but certainly worth a try, it is drinkable and good for summer drinking."
""
"2.8/5: Boring lager is boring"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"It smells (tinny lemongrass) and looks (clear and pale) like the lagers flowing in a Paulaner or Augustiner Bräuhaus in downtown Munich, but most importantly, it tastes almost as good."

"Pours a clear, seethru golden body with minimal head and lace streak down glass. Aroma is pils malt and grain and not much else but isn't bad. Beer is light bodied, not watery but close, crisp with a touch of fruit sweetness and hoppy bitterness but mostly I get a grainy maltiness to the beer. An easy to drink light German beer but that isn't bad but there are much better versions of this beer out there."
""
""
""
"O- easy drinking summer bee, not on the level of the German originals, but very drinkable"
""
""

"At the beach so I been drinking adjunct lager for the most part of the day ( budweiser).. but had to have a six pack of craft.. the pour is clear with slight lace.. the smell is slight grass with a biscuit.. the taste is smooth slight sweet barley.. biscuit.. overall really not much different then the bud I been drinking all week just without the adjunct taste when it warms.. its slighty better then the bud but really the crazy price I payed here at the beach (9.99).. I rather just buy some more bud."
""
"It's summer, so why the hell not have a new NB seasonal? This one pours a clear straw topped by a half-finger or so of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises thick grass, mild greenery, and dry, flaky white bread. The taste brings in more of the same, the bread subduing the grass a bit, though not enough to take control of the situation (nor to actually achieve much of a character of its own, despite its best efforts). The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, not a bad little helles, really. I could see drinking more, though it wouldn't likely be the first bottle I reach for in such a situation."
""

"Overall, I say this was a pretty good beer that I would have again."
""

""
""
""
""

"Good for summer, absolutely. Better than Rolle Bolle or even Skinny Dip? I'm not so sure."
""
""
""
""
""
"Say what you will about the style, this beer gets it right in every aspect."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's enjoyable. But so are so many beers which are much cheaper and more available. Nothing special here besides smoothness in my opinion, and the lacing around the beer glass makes it seem like it's more of a $10 6 pack than it tastes. Much deeper flavor than something like a Bud but not that far off."
"Overall, this is an outstanding version of a Munich Helles lager. Moderately malt-forward but very well-balanced. DMS is a normal byproduct of brewing with Pilsner malts and acceptable in the style, but a little overboard on the nose here. Otherwise, a great beer when rated to style and a very drinkable summer beer."

"Started brightly, but faded quicker than a summer sunset. If they could get those interesting characteristics from the smell to come through in the taste, I'd be sold."

"O: NB Summer Helles is a pretty good summer beer -- it misses a little on the crispness of the hopping and is one-dimensional in the malt department. Still, all in all, this is a pretty solid helles and nothing wrong with it at all -- I just wish it brought a bit more malt flavor and crispness."

"This beer has very little taste and is practically carbonated water, although it's perfect on a hot Summer day because it's so refreshing and easy to drink. The problem is that it's barely beer. The macros have more flavor."
"Thanks LInda."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle from Trader Joe's. Crisp and clean, moderate carbonation, and a little grassy/floral aroma from the hops. The finish reminded me a little bit of a pilsner, but the hops don't linger as long. Would buy it again. I think this is the first Helles I tried so I don't have much to compare with."

"This is just an awesome beer, and a fantastic example of the style. It takes some exceptional skill to brew a beer so delicate without any obvious flaws. I've been buying 6 packs of this throughout the summer and just keep going back to it. HIGHLY recommended."

"Light color with a head that quickly dissipated in my standard pint glass.  Pleasant smell with just a hint of citrus. Light, crisp taste that hit the spot on a hot day. Good amount of carbonation.  Overall, not as memorable as I had hoped, but I'm still looking forward to finishing off the six pack.  Picked up my pack on sale for $7.99."

"Very pale color. Dense white head dissipates quickly. Light malt and fruit on the nose. Tastes of nice malt and pear. Little, if any, hops/bitterness. Light mouth feel. Not the most flavorful brew, but very refreshing and really hit the spot on a hot day."
""
""
"O: Pretty mediocre example of the style. Hop presence is diminished, even considering the lack of hoppiness in helles. Grainy, even for the style. Simply not enough flavor to justify purchasing again."

"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Best by date of 10/19/14. 5% ABV"
""
""
"The Verdict: It’s OK. Slightly above average maybe, thanks to the lemon zest, but not much more than that. Rather bland and lightweight. Those who prefer something on the light side may actually prefer it."
""
"This is exactly what I was looking for. The look is unimportant, is corny new Belgium yeast. This is a light, crisp, watery lager with just the right amount of corn and sweet malt. Hops are a bit flat and medicinal, otherwise this is great."

"A very well done Helles Lager. Crisp, easy drinking tasty beer."
"O-Excellent summer beer. Lacks the depth and complexity of some in this style but a great drinker for the summer."

"I had this beer right after finishing a triathlon, and it was ~perfect~. Simple, light, refreshing, with delicate and subtle flavors (bready, grassy, a touch of citrus sweetness). As others have noted, this is a straightforward malt driven lager--nothing too fancy--but, IMHO, very well-executed. Drinks smooth. Perfect for relaxing on a hot summer day."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, best before 9/21/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear pale straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light fruitiness, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light fruitiness, and yeast earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and light-moderate yeast ester flavors; with solid robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 5%. Overall this is a very solid Munich helles style. Well balanced pale malt, earthy hops, and light-moderate yeast ester flavors with solid robustness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."

"Appears fizzy and yellow, but it's all grain and it's lighter than most typical German Helles lagers out there. Pale straw golden with a billowing pillow white head, fine speckled lacing left behind poured into a nonic pint glass not the best choice but I was pouring two bottles so it worked. Aroma has biscuit malts bread dough, hint of powdered yeast, slight citric grassy character, that's simple enough. Flavor is great clean refreshing bready malts, citric/grassy hop one, two combo. No fireworks just super pale, malts with flavor this is fancy white bread. Very enjoyable session beer don't expect much complexity just a malt driven lager with many positive attributes...I'm a fan of the light body pale color and tasty malt bill. I could use a tad more hops, but there are some nice herbal grassy characteristics going on. Overall, what a refreshing Summer Helles should definitely deliver...a thirst quenching characteristic lawnmower style beer."

"Overall- A decent refreshing beer for a hot summer day, but nothing to go out of your way for."

"It's an excellent beer."
""
"I'm always hoping for more lighter brews that provide some flavor. This one is more subtle and adds a different twist to the summer beer lineup. While this isn't one of my favorites, it's yet another utterly clean and well-engineered beer from New Belgium. From the 12 oz bottle purchased at Trader Joes."
""
"Enjoyable. Nice for a warm day."
""
""
""
"Overall New Belgium is 0/3 in my book. I was expecting this to be like a hofbrau or weinhenstephaner. Why copy a Heineken, as a seasonal to boot. Heine's available year around and for cheaper. The best thing about this is the brown bottle, pretty much guaranteed a non skunked Heineken."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty solid light summer pale lager. Good grainy malt notes with a nice bitter backing of hops."
""
""

"Non-review rant: NB used to make some really interesting summer beers. In the late 90s, they had their nicely-hopped, low alcohol actual Belgian-styled Porch Swing Single. Then there was their delicious Loft, with wheat and coriander and kaffir leaf. The recipe was tweaked into Skinny Dip, which was still good. But the last 5 years they have declined very sharply in interest."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I didn't think the malts held this up enough. It felt too sharp and carbonated at times. Watery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall it is quite a tasty beer, although I wish it had just a little more character. My initial thought was that NB finally managed to brew a beer Bud would be proud of. On second thought though I think it is a good summer brew, and might bring in some people who would normally pass on the Micro market."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not a great lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Refreshing? Yes. Complex? Not so much. It would be a nice session beer for the summer but the complexities just are not there. Very little from the hops."
""
""
""
""
""

"just not a very interesting beer here, and nothing like the helles beers of europe. this is impossibly light in both color and flavor, definitely taking on a watered down vibe, but being refreshing enough and certainly sessionable enough if you can keep from getting bored by it. pale pale yellow in color, but holds a decent inch of white fluff on top as the bubbles run to the surface. the nose is a little sweet, and then full of pilsener and pale malts, but ithe malty nose doesnt carry to the flavor, where the front end of this is almost entirely tasteless. more excitement in the finish, as the grains are pretty fresh tasting and some simple but well timed hops enter the equation. its very drinkable stuff, but rather devoid of flavor, and falls into that low medium level so many of these new belgium seasonals have fallen to. zero body and a lot of bubbles is nice for warm weather, but i need my beer to taste like beer, and this barely gets there for me."

"O: Refreshing and easy to drink with a light flavor and body which makes it great for the hot summer weather. Matches well with the turkey hot dogs and baked beans I'm having for dinner tonight."
"Overall - NB knocked this one out of the park. Its so easy to knock these back! Great brew, a solid offering any time of the year as far as I can see, but perfect for a hot summer day."
"overall: pick this beer up and enjoy it already."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A basic, well-made refreshing helles. An enjoyable ""session"" brew!"
"The summer Helles from New Belgium is a great offering. The beer poured a pure clear yellow with white head that is lacing down the entire glass. The scent carries mostly graining hops. The taste is close to a pilsner...light and crisp with grass and grain flare. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall this is a nice summer session ale."
""
""
""
"O - This lager is easy-drinking and refreshing when cold - but that's about it. Not that I was expecting this beer, as new as it, is, to be all that good. After all, which American craft beer brewer has the guts to attempt brewing a decent helles? One of the most difficult styles to get right. Nice try, NB, but I have to say this one is a dud. I suppose I'm still looking for that ""holy grail"" - a great, domestically brewed American helles that mimics the great helles lagers of SW Germany."
"Overall an OK beer, something for a hot day."
""
"The taste follows suit with an odd lemon-y aspect that is out of place here and the malt is nearly as light as an adjunct lager. It does have a smooth mouthfeel with a crisp snap at the end. Overall Im pretty disappointed in this one as it tastes closer to an AAL than a good, traditional German Helles. This feels rushed and just not a well thought out beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It sure is smooth and tasty enough for me to enjoy. I like."
""
""
""
""
"My beer guru have me a couple of these to try but did not give it a ringing endorsement. I can see why. Nothing special here but secondly not bad either. Not much to look at and no smell of note. But tasty beer although not that interesting, overall I enjoyed it, glad he gave me two. Good beer for a quantity over quality night, but certainly not a beer I would go out of my way to have."
""
""
"Flat and doughy, for a lager, this is quite lackluster, rather fresh yet still has a DMS tinge. The other New Belgium summer seasonals have been much more consistent come on guys I know you can do better."
""
""
""
"Summer Helles pours a clear golden color, with a small but lacing head. There is a stench similar to smelly garbage and skunks. The taste is light, has strong soap flavors, but just hints of a nice crisp malt flavor. Light, watery, and borderline offensive. Overall it has hints of a nice flavor, but a lot of garbage mixed it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent offering from New Begium just in time for the summer. This brew is overall is spectacular, but certainly pretty good and very sessionable. What I wasn't overly wow'ed with were it's appearance (standard golden beer color) and its taste (just slightly better than your run-of-the-mill lager.) I did find its strong, yeasty smell very appealing (reminding me of the good ol'big, fat yeast roll) and it was one of the smoothest beers I've had in a while. So, not the best I've had from New Belgium, but certainly good enough to go out and partake of some more."
"Pours out a pale gold with a light haze. A good deal of bubbles in the body. Thin, white head. Smell is too grainy for me to be calling it a helles lager. I expect to smell more breadiness and honey. Flavor works out a lot better. Way maltier than the smell would have you believe. There is a grainy character to it, but it isn't too overbearing. I only knock it for the slight NB house taste, which throws me off. Mouthfeel is prickly, spritzy, and light-bodied. Overall, I like this, but it's not the best lager out there."
""
"Respect."
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and a nice example of the style, it had most of the aspects that I look for in the style, but I think a little less sweetness and a little bit more hop flavor would help this beer out and make it stand out a little. This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, clean, not filling. but the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention, I think two would be my limit, i might get bored with it after that. What I like the most about this beer was the how true to style it was, it had most of the aspects that I expect from the style. What I like the least about this beer was the it was a little bland, I know this style doesn't have the most flavor, but this one seemed a little blander then some of the better Helles Lagers. I wouldn't buy this beer again, there's a few other sessionable lager that I would rather have, I don't know if I recommend it, but if you wanted an easy drinking beer I would say give it a shot. All in all i thought this was decent beer, there wasn't anything off or wrong with it and the it seemed to be pretty true to style so in my eyes this is a fairly solid example of the style. Thanks for another solid easy drinking beer New Belgium."

"Pours a clear light yellow with a foamy white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, hay, and grass aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and grass flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is fairly refreshing and easy to drink."

"O -- Overall, this beer could benefit with some bigger malted barley character. It's certainly light and refreshing, but it's not comparable to the better imports."
""
""
""
""

"Taste is similar, with sweet malts coming in prior to a touch of dry hops. Simply a solid helles lager, and an enjoyable light brew for warm weather."
