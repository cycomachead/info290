A hint of something else for sure but unfortunately my palate hasn't developed enough to call it out with confidence. The aroma chases the taste onto my tongue. The bitterness is perfectly balanced with the hops and roasted malt. The finish is dry but a bit disrupted by something and my guess is that it's age. Alas, here in Singapore freshness is often something to be desired. The bottling date puts it 11 months ago, but I'm going to go ahead and call it a solid Marzen! Prost!","Gusmotel","Oct 25, 2013"

Crisp and clear with no haze whatsoever. Smells sweet and a bit fruity, notes of raisin overpowered by caramel and syrup smells. Smooth and not as sweet as expected. Full mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation. Moderate upfront sweetness that hints at brown sugar and molassas. Easy to drink, light. Excellent for the style.

Nose was rich and malty, very caramel-like in its intensity. The head was so long-lasting that I was in no hurry to disrupt it, so I allowed it to fall on its own, leaving some nice lacing in its wake. Mouthfeel was medium and it had a rich malty sweetness on the tongue that might have been to much for me on most nights, but it was tasting pretty daggum good tonight. Finish remained very sweet with just a hint of hops at the extreme finish and I know that I would generally shun something like this, but half the glass was empty just while I typed!

The taste is a bit of roasted malt more than sweetness, syrupy, not much hops in the taste or on the backend. Malts become more dominant as the beer warms up, with sweetness coming to forefront. Nice carbonation, fairly smooth mouthfeel. A farily decent interpretation of the style.","jdense","Dec 23, 2009"

Inviting. This beer had kind of a strange flavor arc -- the malts, hops, and yeast all emerge at different times and have very different characteristics. The sweet malts are the first to emerge, and they remain, mildly intot the finish.

Mouthfeel was light, low viscosity compared to other Marzens.

The color was a nice redish brown, with a head that settled fairly quickly. The taste was nutty, sweet, and slightly sour. Hints of caramel and spice came through, and possibly grapefruit as well. Would have this again, as it was easy to drink and very enjoyable.","alysmith4","Nov 13, 2006"

4.07,12.1,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"The aroma is malty, sweet and sour candy-like. The taste is well balanced and the body is solid. A sweet malted caramel greats you while a mild hop comes through to crisp the rear. Mouthfeel is very smooth and drinkable. The 5.7% is a nice touch for this autumn centered brew.

It was ""the middle sampler", a beer in a sampler at a microbrew, that seemed average, unoffensive and taking up space on the way to the beers I love. Plus is again, freshness. Second beer from GB (this was dated 5/9/06) that tasted real fresh, very few bottled beers get the ""it's like a fresh microbrew pour"" so bonus points there.","Ricochet","Sep 17, 2006"
3.45,-5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"On tap at the Washington DC restaurant. Amber-red color with a thin off-white head. No lacing noted. Reserved aromas of toasted malt, caramel, hay and some background noble hop spiceiness. Thin, somewhat watery palate but refreshing and clean. Flavors much like the aroma; toasty malts, sweet caramels and some faint, but crisp hops. Nothing astray here, just a bit of a middle-of-the-road lightweight Marzen.","macster","Aug 26, 2006"

By the time I got about half way done there was no head at all and I was drinking flat beer. I liked the color, very full red/amber look. Begins with a mildly dry taste and explodes into an overly sweet finish with little bittnerness.

The smell of sweet malt dominates the nose, citrus crisp and fresh, quite pleasant. Start is malt and lightly sweet on the palate, the top middling in mouth feel, the finish perkily acidic, purposeful in its hop presence, dry and lingering aftertaste, a good beer not overpowering in any category, one that would make a fine session beer.","Gusler","Jan 13, 2003"

Their pamphlets state that Mr. Gordon acquired his brewing skills at the Weihenstehpan school in Bavaria in the late 1970's. I don't know what's happened between now and then, but I could leave a bottle of Weihenstephaner Dunkel-weiss (or any other Weihenstephaner beer) in my car's back windshield for a month and it would still taste better than the best Gordon Biersch beers.

I was really dissapointed after going out of my way to find the place.
