Flavor reveals specialty malt fruitiness initially, which is countered by bready, nutty malt in the lightly dry finish. Very sessionable beer. The fruitiness is a bit more than I'd prefer in the style.","barczar","Aug 20, 2014"

Light, yet full; despite the low amount of head, the carbonation is enjoyable.

I absolutely love anything that New Glarus produces but in this case Two Brothers Atom Smasher takes the win. Staghorn is extremely smooth with a barley flavour. Nice hopp flavour as as you open your mouth after you finish swallowing the amber colored brew. Well rounded mellow smooth taste. I'd deffinately grab another 6er if I'm up in Wisconsin within the next month or so... Or even next years Oktoberfest.","BigC60548","Sep 03, 2013"

I'm usually looking for a little more malty finish in an Oktoberfest, it was briefly there but not as pronounced as I look for in this style. Overall this is a very drinkable offering from an outstanding brewery. If you get a chance to pick up a sixpack or better yet, if you get a chance to have this on tap– I wouldn't pass it by. It'll be well worth the cost.","JParlow","Aug 14, 2013"

Its not too sweet, a little bready and just a hint of caramel. It exclaims the bounty of a fall harvest-- keeping the grain center stage. The finish has just a hint of bitterness.

The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a solid O-Fest, not the best I've had but far from the worst.

It pours a golden orange color with a nice frothy ecru head. The smell is fairly vacant for most of the Oktoberfests that I'm used to. There is obviously the distinct smell of malts and in this instance there is a slight citrus smell from what seems to be hops. On the trail end there is a hint of orange zest in addition to the hoppy aroma. The taste is exactly as it smells with the hoppiness causing a slight bittering on the back of the tongue. I've gotta say maybe it's that I've heard such good things about this one, or maybe it's because this is more of the traditional German style that is not my preference. This is not the best Oktoberfest available and that in itself is a disappointment.

Well crafted brew.","oakbluff","Jun 14, 2009"
3.67,-7.1,2.5,3,4,4,4,"Almost no head, at least nothing that stayed around from any amount of time. Lacing from swirling doesn't last either. Smell is lager yeast at best, maybe some malts there too, but barely there, my friend smelled a fart in the glass, not mine either. Taste is actually not bad, sweet, but not overly, light crisp body, balanced mouth, medium carbonation. For a style I don't generally go for, this isn't a bad example. Cheers to Taturbo for the brew.","ballewblake","Apr 17, 2009"

4.3,8.9,4,4,4,5,5,"A strong pour gets an inch and a half of rocky tan head that fades in minutes leaving only slight dots of lace. Body is a deep mahogany amber in color. Nose has tones of rustic spices, limestone and some sweet malt to balance the minerals. Minerals and malt are the first things to show through as you start to drink. Then a nice crisp feel really makes this beer standout on the middle of the palate. A crisp dry almost green apple likefel comes about on the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel reminds me of a good German Pilsner, refreshing yet rich and rustic. I could dring these all night and year round. I wish I'd bought a case or two.","SPLITGRIN","Mar 11, 2009"

Smells of caramely malts and slight citrus hops. Very crisp refreshing brew, starts with a nice sweet malty backbone with tinge of hops to round it out, very balanced beer that's very easy to drink(which is pretty much NG's standard when it comes to the 6packs).

Heavily toasted malts with a lot of straight, unmilled grain aromas. With just a touch of herbal hoppiness in the aroma. Very bready and grainy. This is close to what the ld school German octoberfest tasted like. Heavy toasted malts, and in this case, grassy/minty hops balancing things out a bit.

Aroma of husky, grainy malts, not much in the way of caramel like so many other American OFests, but I like that. Nice and traditional. Clean flavor of toasty malts, sufficiently sweet, slightly hoppy, a little herbal, and a little floral. Light carbonation, yet crisp. A very nice OFest, and even though the ABV is over 6%, is drinkable as hell and could see myself putting back a few of these on a nice Autumn evening. Probably the best American OFest I've tried.","KeefD","Nov 02, 2008"

Nice hoppy finish. Very fresh tasting beer with medium/full body. Very drinkable. Could tell it had a higher ABV after a couple of drinks due to a little alcohol warming.

Some bits of stickiness here and there on the sides, but not much to speak of. Scent consists of toasted grains, mild caramel and crystal malts, and a some metallic notes. An interesting pepper and spice with an earthy hop tickle the nose as well. Pretty tame smell overall though. Taste begins with some roasted nuts and pale malts with a bready characteristic. Midway some sweet caramel and honey with a light dry pepper flavor in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light to medium with a strong carbonation sting and a crisp body. Drinkable?

Honey, vanilla, floral notes come together like a mountain meadow in fall. This beer just screams autumn and the outdoors to me. The taste is not at all a letdown. The malt is predominant--with robust caramel--and a delightful tinge of hoppiness is a lovely counter. Sweetness and bitterness combine ohh so well with this beer. It really has an extraordinary balance and flavor profile for an oktoberfest, well for any medium-bodied beer for that matter. Body is crisp and medium with a favorable creaminess to it. Some cooked apples come through eventually. A cracker this one.","Duffman","Sep 18, 2008"

It reminds me a lot of Hacker-Pschorr's O'fest beer for being a little big, but very smooth. There's a slight mineral note with the bread loaf aroma, which I suppose is appropriate for a German style lager.

Luckily received it in a BIF or I never would have even known about it. Poured a nice bright amber with a good hint of orange. The ample carbonation led to the formation of a nice thick white head of lace about two inches tall. Good retention left behind some nice concentric rings of side glass lace and a nice frothy film on top. The aroma was very crisp, fresh with a nice grassy tone, some bready malts lingering in the back. The flavor followed right along, coming through with a big backbone of bread like malts with a very nice grassy kind of twang to it. Some nice little nuances of spice hiding in the back and a good little dry hoppy like finish to it. Nice light to medium body and ample carbonation gave a great smooth feel and this one was defiantly a winner. I was thrilled to have gotten the opportunity to try this one. This was the best of all the Oktoberfest I had this year. It had such a nice balance of flavor and session ability that it was unmatched. The great little bursts of flavor and extra little pop that seemed to be in it just pulled it apart from the crowd. A really great brew and absolutely perfect for the season. Will be looking for this next year.","mikesgroove","Nov 03, 2007"

The body is a dark orange amber and holds a diminishing off white head. The first sip offers a somewhat dry toasted malt flavor with a bit of sweetness toward the swallow.

4.14,4.8,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"D - Overall a pretty good Oktoberfest, probably the best I've had this year. Might seem a bit thin and bland if you drink it too cold.","umustdrink","Oct 08, 2007"
3.62,-8.4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a dark copper red with thin head that laces down the glass. Smell is biscuity, sweet malt, and a touch of citruis hop. Has the malty flavor of a marzen, but subtle compared to other o'fest brews. Higher level of hops compared to the traditional German Marzens. Mouthfeel is good carbonation is where it should be, leaves a pleasent malt aftertaste that is not overpowering but reminds you of what you just drank. Overall enjoyable, I think it could be a little better, but only because New Glarus has put out outstanding brews before. A keeper for sure.","Homerbag","Oct 06, 2007"

4.18,5.8,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a beautiful, crystal clear, amber color. Head retains well. Smell is slightly floral, biscuity, and a hint of a lager-like smell (light DMS?). Pretty balanced between the malt and the hops; seems to have a higher level of hop flavor and bitterness. I seem to remember a rich smell of fresh malt, similar to that at the brewery or when I'm homebrewing, this doesn't seem to have it as much. Carbonation is medium and it's medium bodied; sits pretty good on the tongue. Pretty damn good beer, better than my numbers may reflect, but doesn't seem to have the huge malty aroma jumping out at me like the previous batch.","badbeer","Sep 28, 2007"
3.52,-10.9,3,3.5,4,3,3,"This beer pours a clear bronze color with red hues. The head is small, and recedes quickly into no lacing. The aroma is of caramel, biscuits, and grass. The taste is like the aroma, but with some nice nutty flavors appearing in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is quite thin for an Oktoberfest, while the carbonation is nice. Overall, this is another overhyped, disappointment from New Glarus. It isn't bad by any means, but I don't think its so good that I would search for it.","KarlHungus","Sep 23, 2007"

3.75,-5.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a rusty copper color with a nice finger worth of fluffy white foam. Aroma is spicy, some apple, salty water?, fresh earthy hops, and little roasted malts. Taste is much like the aroma but more fruity and malty, and some bread and yeast flavors. Mouthfeel and carbonation are both medium. Easy to drink but I guess its not my favorite style of beer.","seaoflament","Sep 18, 2007"

The malts are just huge but this never seems unbalanced. Each sip finishes with a nice dose of herbal/floral German hops. The palate dries just enough to want another sip of the sweet, malty brew. Perfectly drinkable. My favorite American Oktoberfest hands down.","DaPeculierDane","Sep 07, 2007"

The taste was malty and rich with a light Munich malt flavor. There were notes of fruit and caramel, and the hops came out in the finish. The mouthfeel was dry with medium body and good carbonation. The finish and aftertaste were malty and hoppy. This was a good take on a märzen.","UncleJimbo","Mar 12, 2006"

Aroma is nutty malts, with hoppiness present, but not dominant. Flavor is as the nose indicated, nutty grains and sedate hops balancing each other, just what I would expect from an Octoberfest. Mouthfeel is soft over the tongue, and the only thing that may detract from the drinkability is the sweetness starts to become prominent. Definitely an enjoyable brew that could be revisited.","ppoitras","Jan 12, 2006"

This is a really rich beer with a nice thickness to the body. Flavor begins with a nutty caramel maltiness and that's the main flavor, it holds throughout. Toasty bready and yeasty flavors coming in underneath. Lighter fruits and spices from hops come as I go further. Finish is drier but leaves me with a bit of the caramel flavor and makes me want to drink more. This is really a great Octoberfest and one everybody should try to get.","granger10","Oct 07, 2005"

In short, it's about as good as I remember with the exception of a mild tinniness that I could do without. From the beginning... a beautiful beer, a sort of deep amber that fits the time of year. Bisque-colored head that lasted a good long while. The nose to me is extremely floral and the taste is not partcularly hoppy, sweet but not too much so. Slightly tinny aftertaste that I hope does not taint the rest of the 3 cases I bought. All in all, it's good to be home.","cdfree","Oct 16, 2004"

4.03,2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Picked up this cervid-inspired beer at Chicone's during a recent five state border run. Pours a ruddy, leathery, fall-oak-leaf brown, with brassy highlights. Has a soft, medium-sized dark-white head. Smells of brown sugar, biscuits, caramelized carrots, and spicy hops. Taste starts off with spiced carrot cake, mild sweetness that turns nutty and biscuity as the hops come in and attack the side of the mouth. Hops are fresh, spicy, and adequately balance the malt. Finish has some tangy hop bitterness and a good dose of unsweetened cookie malt. Medium bodied lager with lots of malt AND that's not too cloying, but the carbonation seems a touch high. A very nice O-fest, but I didn't expect anything less from New Glarus.","alexgash","Oct 06, 2004"

The roasted, dryness lingers on the front of the tongue and roof of mouth. The mouthfeel is a little uneventful. Overall, a great Octoberfest for all!","ALESwhatCURESya","Sep 30, 2004"

Wonderful toasted aroma on this, touch of caramel and light floral dried hops, very crisply toasted with a hint of ripe fruity-like sweetness reminescent of a sour bread dough. Really becomes a sniffer as it warms. Taste is a nice toasty, lightly sweet mix of maltyness, very solid through and through. Sweetness is strong but subdued in its presense over an amazing and great little toastyness, some thinner caramel sits in the back with some light herbal/floral dried hops setting up the finish to end with a nice mellow crispness and light lingering sweetness. Medium body feel, lightly creamy aspect and a lovely finish. A very nice O'fest beer that goes down with ease. A new favorite to keep around, top notch and a cut above alot of the mish-mashy O'fest brews that every brewery seems to make. This one is done right. Great job New Glarus!
