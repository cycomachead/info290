4.39,17.4,4.25,4,4.5,4.75,4.5,"BBD 12/4/14.  Clear amber pour with a beautiful dark ruby cast.  Normal head and retention, excellent lacing.  Light nose of biscuit with caramel hints over a faint pear like citric note.  Almost medium body with a distinct creamy texture.  Heavier than most Oktoberfests, which is a plus.  Above average carbonation with a nice effervescence throughout.  The wonderful flavor profile is intense, complex and well balanced.  It begins with a burst of biscuit against a caramel backbone that effervesces into a mild bitterness in the middle.  The bitterness is herbal in nature (with a bit of rind), gives the tongue a nice tart pucker, then releases into pear notes.  The finish is clean and leaves you with a mild bitterness over a faint biscuit sweetness that is somewhat dry. One of best!","tillmac62","Nov 18, 2014"

More going on with the taste as it is full of flavor with some sweetness in the mix as well with some spice, nuts with a ever so slight hop finish. Very tasty and smooth brew overall. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. It could compete with some good German Oktoberfest brews! PROST!","BeerWithMike","Oct 06, 2014"

The smell has a strong malty caramel smell and a tangy orange hop smell. The beer taste is similar to the smell. Although, the sweetness is a bit sweeter. The tangy orange hop taste works well because of the huge contrast between the two tastes. The mouthfeel is medium bodied but on the lighter side. The finish is smooth with very little carbonation. Overall, a pretty good Oktoberfest and one worth getting when available.","HattedClassic","Sep 30, 2014"

Bought this as a single bottle... going back for a 6 pack tomorrow.","cambabeer","Sep 24, 2014"
4.05,8.3,,,,,,"This poured a lovely orange with yellow hues in it and good clarity. Had a fat head that fell slowly and left lace. Simply gorgeous in the glass. Reminds me of a pretty girl with a stature if you will. Nose is tempting with a hefty hit of toasted bread crust first that gives way to some light but luscious caramel. A faint bit of herbal on the nose a small hint that the very kernel of this grain might just be a bit nutty. Tastes just like that. Smooth, malty, a grainy little edge and a light little herbal. Sweet too. Rounds out at the back palate with a faint bitter. Drying, dry and lingers with a bit of malty sweetness. Lovely, clean and very good. Medium mouthfeel that is thin meaning not thick or heavy. Perfect!","utopiajane","Sep 24, 2014"

As for the palate, it's all about rich malt character: buttery pie crust, pumpernickel, wheat toast, hints of apricot, marshmallow, and jammy stone fruit. Hops are faint, slightly peppering the back end of the profile for a  more clean, balanced finish (though the beer as a whole is nowhere near dry). A little on the sweet side for me, but that's its only flaw - everything else spells great drinking.","BarryMFBurton","Sep 20, 2014"

What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was pretty nice, true to style and I liked how clean it was. What I liked the least about this beer was the alcohol, I think it should be toned down just a little to make this even more true to style. I would buy this again next year, I'm not sure I would get a whole six pack. but I'm sure I would revisit it again and it's priced well. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the style, All in all I thought this was a pretty solid example of an Oktoberfest, it's not my favorite of the style, but it's still pretty above average.

2.6,-30.5,3,3,2.5,3,2,"Pours a cranberry red fused with a touch of amber. A quick living greyish white head that leaves rather quickly leaving behind a sampling of it around the edges. A sweet and spicy aroma, malt forward 110% of the way. Bready, caramel, nutty and cloves, cloves, and a little more cloves. Flavor is strong on the clove, the nuttiness, caramel and bread is definitely right there with it too though. A crisp medium to full body to this. Overall, meh. Not too familiar with the style but I do believe Great Divide's Hoss is a similar style, but with rye malt included, and I prefer that to this for sure. Glad I only bought a single of this...though not even sure I care to finish this one bottle of it.","denver10","Sep 02, 2012"

There's a hint of earthy hops in there if you sniff at it hard enough. Overall the nose is nice but unrepresentative of the style. The taste is a bit closer to that of a traditional Oktoberfest, with plenty of toast on the front and mid-palates. A strong brown sugar flavor makes it a bit sweeter than most Oktoberfests, but the extra richness doesn't turn me off; it just makes me sip it a bit slower. A low hopiness on the finish adds an additional layer. Overall, it's fun to sip but is not even remotely sessionable.","droomyster","Sep 18, 2010"

You experience that caramel, bready sweetness you expect from a Marzen, but it finishes surprisingly crisp with no syrupy aftertaste or mouthfeel you might expect. Each sip is like experiencing this beer anew. Drinkability is through the roof and i could easily drink more than a six pack if i wanted to take it to the limit. I highly recommend this beer.

When first sniffed after the pour there is a large malty smell to the beer that reminds of citrus. There is a distinct aroma from the german hops as well. The taste is quite pleasant on the tastebuds. The beer is dead on for the style an in my opinion as good of a version as you're going to find in America on the store shelves. Those german hop varieties so through slightly in the taste but don't leave any bitterness in the beer which is highly desirable for myself. The yeast flavoring on the back is quite interesting it has slight and very short lived hints of banana and cotton candy. Neither of which are strong enough to detract from the rich malty flavor of the beer itself. The feel is quite smooth and an appropriate viscosity. This is a highly drinkable, highly refreshing beer.

Again, it's a little bit over done with the malts. It has a dry, caramel/toffee flavor that goes down easy with some prickly carbonation. There are some light bready notes in there as well.

It has a familiar Marzen sweet malt aroma, and a little sourness that I can't identify. The taste was dissappointing. To me, the hops and malts are clashing. It's like there is a good Marzen in there, but it is being subdued by a harsh metallic bite. Maybe the high carbonation contributes to this.

Aromatics offer up roasted malt and caramel tones with a touch of alcohol and mild herbal hop flow. A very bready texture of house lager yeast noted as well. Flavor is rich with cereal grains and caramel amber malt flavors, subtle nuttiness with a punctual noble hop bitterness adds to the incredible balance this version of the style has. Probably without a doubt one of my favorites of the season along with Great Lakes O fest. Texture is smooth with crisp even carbonation, definitely grab a whole sixer of this brew light to medium bodied it won't let you down. Drinkability like I said to enjoy this grab at least a half liter mug and enjoy it two at a time, so far I know Left Hand can pull off some good lagers, Pole Star and their collaboration Terrapin.","WVbeergeek","Nov 02, 2008"

It poured up a lovely orange bronze colour with a slight chill haze. Nose was quite sweet with a bit of maple syrup. Other toasted cereal smells were also present. Flavour was similar to its German couterparts, except there was an easily detectable hop bitterness toward the finish which I do not care for in this style.

On first sip you get the upfront sweet maltiness that really dominates this brew. It almost steps into the scotch ale catagory on some points.

Aroma is comprised of sweet caramel and toffee, heavy roasted malt notes, light spiciness/hoppiness also mixed in. Taste is roasty malt, caramel, toffee, yeast/bread notes, sweet finish with a dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel is slick and smooth, medium bodied, low carbonation, goes down nice and easy. Drinkability is great, well balanced O'fest, nice malt complexity and heartier substance expected of the style, would purchase again.","danielocean03","Sep 08, 2007"

3.65,-2.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Man are the Oktoberfest's comming out early this year. Good to see this new arrival popping up this week. Aromas give a medium malty, bready, caramelly rich nose; with hints of barley flavors and grains mixed in. The appearance is a brightly hued color of copper, golden, and amber--quite nice. Very clear with a continuous layer of foam, but little lacing. Flavors give a medium character of deep, rich barley malts with light caramel, bread, and hints of nuttiness. However flavors of grains soon make their way in, above the moderate bready flavors. The feel is a little light / thin, not allowing the rich maltiness to last deep into the aftertaste. Instead, a mild grain husk flavor gains intensity and follows deep into the lingering. Good beer, I just demand more from a good Oktoberfest.","BEERchitect","Aug 17, 2007"

Smell was also authentic, which is to say quite malty with a touch of spice. Taste was a little too sweet and underattenuated to be a good fest bier. Oddly earthy hop bitterness kept lingering on, and felt out of place for the style. Was this only 6% ABV, as it became too much of a tedium to drink rapidly. Is this a bold interpretation of the style, or is it good intentions gone wrong? Hard to say for sure.","rajendra82","Sep 29, 2006"
