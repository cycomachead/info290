3.8,12.8,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Dundee Oktoberfest -brewed by Genesee Brewing Co. / Dundee Brewing Co. This brew has an ABV of 5.50% When Dundee Oktoberfest pours out, it is a nice light brown color ,with a nice white head.  The smell is rich sweetness and spices. You also pick up on some grains and malts in the smell. There is a lot going on in the taste of this brew.  You pick up on the spices and malts. Dundee Oktoberfest has a smooth taste, there is nothing overpowering in this brew. I though there would be more to this brew but it is ok. I was hoping for more flavor in this brew.  More spices and flavors.  For what it worth this is mild Oktoberfest, but it is good tasting. The mouthfeel is nice and clean, with no bad aftertaste. The mouthfeel is is and clean and refreshing. This is a good drinking brew. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out 5.  I would get this brew again.","nicholas2121","Oct 26, 2014"

The taste has a gentle toasted grain flavor which is pretty standard for the style. overall the fest is pretty standard, by the numbers...good but not exceptional.

Anyway, this stuff pours a clear auburn-bronze topped by a finger of cream foam. The nose comprises sourdough, toffee, and a kiss of greens. The taste holds notes of very sweet caramel, light candied orange peel, dry bran, and brown grass. It's a strange dichotomy on my tongue between the sweet and the dry/grainy that luckily moves in shifts, rather than just sitting poorly on the tongue. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly slick feel. Overall, a decent O-Fest, but nothing to get anywhere near excited about.","TMoney2591","Nov 23, 2012"

Smells of sweet pale and caramel malts, lightly roasted malts, biscuit, and a touch of grain. Drink is medium carbonated. Tastes of caramel malt, a little biscuit, and a slight hint of red grape. Somewhat sweet aftertaste lingers for a few minutes after, not cloying but pleasant. Overall a good rendition of the Oktoberfest style, but all in all not one to write home about.

3.37,0,3,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,"This beer makes a decent supermarket choice; certainly not a bad deal at $6.99/sixer. Could've used a better balance between the malts & yeast, and definitely better carbonation, but otherwise an acceptable take on the Oktoberfest.","Natural510","Sep 27, 2008"
3.5,3.9,4,1.5,4,4,4.5,"D - Good stuff. I just wish it had some sort of scent. I'm a big fan of sniffing...I often nose a beer for five minutes before I even drink the damn thing, and this one ruins that part of the beer-xperience for me. All around, this is a good beer despite it's one major flaw. This is one I wouldn't mind sessioning on a cold late autumn day...I'm thinking huddled around a bonfire with friends sort of sessioning here.","pmcadamis","Sep 24, 2008"

3.35,-0.6,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"d. This is a good offering from Dundee. I will say any self respecting brewer that can't make a good O-fest is pretty unexcusable. This is a good O-fest. Solid and affordable. Cheers.","Stinkypuss","Sep 17, 2008"

3.41,1.2,1.5,3,3.5,3,4.5,"Pours a clear, straight copper underneath a three finger head after avery hard pour. The head recedes to nothing and no bubbling.... I don't get it. Good color and thats it. The aroma is just straight forward sweet malt anda soft grassy hop. The taste is nice toasted mlats ixed with a shetrock dry grass and adjunct. The taste leaves pretty quick, but it is has undeniable octoberfest beer flavors, just cheapened a bit. Still pretty drinkable though.","scruffwhor","Sep 12, 2008"

2.83,-16,3,2.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a light toasted amber with a thin head. Some faint corn-like aromas. Tastes exactly like Coors Light with a little vienna malt in it in my opinion. Light and drinkable, definitely does not live up to the slogan ""Be full bodied"" though. Disappointing because I had enjoyed all of Dundee's new line of beers a lot.","wiseguy142","Sep 01, 2008"
3.6,6.8,3,3,4,3,4,"As with ALL the high falls brews (in exception to the very very tasty porter), if they used more higher quality ingredients to create their beers they would be much more impressive. High falls continues to release OKAY but mostly lackluster beers. I know they are capable of so much more! I also understand they are in a weird position of a kinda macro brewer that has been trying to look like a microbrewer.","kbnooshay","Beers"
