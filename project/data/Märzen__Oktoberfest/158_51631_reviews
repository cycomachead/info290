"Seems flat and low in carbonation for the style.  Bottled on Dec 11, tasted on April 4th  -  not too long but maybe enough so the beer is not what it could be.  Unlike other ryes, not much going on here."
""
""
""
"Pours darker than expected with a rich and vibrant dark amber body under light foam. Smells and tastes true to style without being quite as rich and luscious as some examples. The maltiness is less than expected, the hops more, especially the bitterness. Overall this works well as an American example of the style, and the rye is a very well done component. As usual, Great Divide delivers a bold interpretation with. Professional."
""
""
""
"Overall: Good representative of the style that is apparently available yearround, which is welcomed by me."

"Very refreshing, I really like this one. I think it is very underrated."
""
""
"Very nice refreshing citrusy aroma from the beer.  The taste like other reviewers have said has a bit of a caramel and strong rye taste to it.  A bit sweet.  My only complaint is the finish is a little flat.  I think this would be a great summer beer."
""
""
"The reason I really like this beer is its great balance of all things good (malt, rye notes, hops, and various mild background flavors), but not dominated  by any one thing.  Then, the ""drinkability"" puts the icing on the cake, with its smoothness and subdued bitterness and a really nice clean finish."

"Tastes watered down. Dissapointed in beer"

"Mouthfeel is medium overall and yet feels watery with mild carbonation, a medium body and a nice malty semi-dry finish that trails with a nice combo of sweetness and spices. This hides the ABV completely and was easy to drink, I really like this version of a Märzen/Oktoberfest and will definitely have it again."

"Pours a light copper-amber color. Very small white head with poor retention. No lacing. Aroma is very malt-forward. Sweet caramel. An unexpected amount of fruitiness (easy there, no I didn't read the label right away). Bready malts, and a bit of spice as well. The taste features, sweet, very lightly roasted malts, led by caramel. A good amount of bread malts as well, and some grain. A little bit of bitterness. Some very lightly roasted nuts that were a very nice addition to the caramel. Very very well balanced, with a good deal of sweetness that doesn't go overboard. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. A bit sticky, with makes it a little harder to gulp down. Overall this one was a pleasant surprise, after having a few letdowns from Great Divide."

"What an unusual twist on a Marzen.  I didn't know how much I'd like this, even though Marzens are one of my favorite styles.  But man, I really dug this one.  It's sweet, but the rye flavor makes it just a little different than most biscuity or malty Oktoberfests.  This one, despite being in my comfort zone stylistically, definitely opened my eyes to a new flavor.  I'll definitely get this again."

"I don't get the cherry or dark fruit in the flavor that the label mentions. Maybe a little in the aroma. Does pour a red-orange with very good flavor imparted by the rye as advertised. Very carmely with a crisp bite at the end. The yeast and rye together are very nice in the smell and taste. I get a little of the same malt/grain taste that the Denver Pale Ale has. This was bottled in Oct. of '13, but still very good. Will look for fresh this fall. Well done. Overall 3.75 conservatively. Great Divide continues to produce a solid lineup."

"Pours golden brown with 1 finger of white head. More malty sweetness in the nose and flavor than I'm used to in a lager. Rye, caramel, and subtle lager bitterness. This is a really impressive lighter beer. I don't normally seek out lagers, but this will be the exception."
""
"This is an attractive and easy drinking beer. Although this is billed as a lager, it lacks the acidity and sourness associated with lagers, perhaps because of the rye. So far, the best beer I’ve had from Great Divide."
""
""
"Pours a deep clear golden with some amber hues. Thin head and light lacing. Nose is malty with notes of spicy rye and neutral lager yeast. Some earthy grain notes as well. Flavor is subtle with rye malts coming forward and no hop character to speak of. A slight spiciness towards the end. Mouthfeel is light and moderately carbonated. Overall, decent flavors, well balanced, and easy drinking."
""

""

"My initial, aggro pour created two fingers of dense, tawny head with moderate retention that created some great lacing as it fell. Color was a filament-bright deep-copper (SRM = > 13, < 17). Beautiful! Nose had a rich, malty scent, but I was not getting the fruitiness the label mentioned, at least, not on the nose. Mouthfeel was soft, slightly bubbly and now I did get a distinct cherry flavor on the tongue. Wild! The rye manifested itself on the dry finish, giving it an earthy balance to offset the malts. This was MUCH better than I anticipated and probably one of the best beers of the style that I have encountered. Great lacing formed as I drank through it. I would definitely be interested in having this beer again."

"O: It's hard to go wrong with this brewery, and it's hard to go wrong with this beer. The rye adds a nice dimension without overpowering it. There's little wow factor here, but I'll be damned if I don't say I'm craving another one of these."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very nice. Nice hoppy lager that is quenchable. No problem taking big, satisfying swallows. A bit thin."
""
""
""
"Overall it's fine and the caramel/chocolate light finish seems unique, but the beer lacks some thick backbone, and the rye angle doesn't seem as obvious on the palate as much as the nose."
"O- I could do some damage to this beer during Oktoberfest. Everything about it is welcoming and not too overpowering. It just screams session beer! It went down like a Gatorade on a hot day. I wouldn't buy this very often, but if it were offered, I would definitely partake."

"Kind of weak for this normally heady brewery - the malt just too understated to take all that seriously. Not bad, but more summer lawn-mowing season friendly, than autumn leaf raking and pumpkin planning appropriate."
"O: An excellent Octoberfest/rye ale. Recommended."
"Overall: A very solid spin on the Marzen style. Good caramel malt taste and a nice twist from the rye and fruit undertones."

""
"Minimal carbonation after the pour. The carbonation bubbles almost entirely disappate shortly thereafter. Beautiful copper red color and brilliant clarity. I smell the bready aroma of light malt and get a bit of the spicey rye notes. The mouthfeel is moderate and tickles the taste buds on the way down. The flavor is definitely typical of an Octoberfest with the clean,crisp flavor and malty, almost nutty flavor. The nice twist would be that nice spicey rye note."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall - easy drinking nice malt flavor."
""
""
""
""
"In the end, I was a bit disappointed with this beer. The fruity cherry notes were not really great for me, although having a good lager mouthfeel and flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The rye is a good idea in terms of flavor, however, it makes a rich style even richer and I really slowed by drinking down as I went through the drink. Maybe not all bad, but for style a bit of a drawback."

"Comes in a fun red plaid package with a lumberjack on it. ABV is 6.2 and summary mentions rich malt, cherry and dark fruit, and earth and spice due to the rye. Poured into a goblet it is a really nice orange color, very little head despite an un-careful pour, and there's just sort of a broken-down bubble-film floating at the very surface now. You can really, really smell the fruit right off the bat; definitely the cherries and maybe a little berry in there. Taste is also very cherry, and might I say, holy crap it is good. There's that sweetness that I notice a lot of GD's stuff has, and then on the back end there's a little bitterness and malt for a second or two (maybe that spice the label mentioned, but I don't really get that), and then it breaks clean off. Really nice. The mouthfeel is oily and smacky, and the carbonation, though low, is right there I feel for a marzen. I had this a few years ago at a restaurant and didn't like it, but I'm wondering if I got a bad bottle because this stuff's kickass. Nicely done!"
"Clean larger aromas dominated by malt; deep gold color with light haze, med off-white head; vienna / munich sweetness dominates flavor without being cloying, nice malt complexity. Low to no noble hop flavors but appropriate clean bitterness provides good balance. Mouthfeel is med-full, creamy and makes this beer a joy to drink. Overall a very nice malt-centric Octoberfest/ Marzen style lager, with (unfortunately) little to no noticeable rye character."
""
""
"it says lager on the front, so i'm hesitant, but the pour looks good, nice deep yellow copper, foamy head dies down after a bit. not much lacing, but others have mentioned it? the rye and malt bring this out of the lager league, smooth feel, hops are mild, and a pleasant sweetness makes it very drinkable out of the gate. interesting, it's leaving a lip smacking sweetness on my lips. i think a couple of these would have me heading back to my favored styles, but for something that says lager, it's quite nice. i think it'd go well with a burger and fries."

"The beer was a deep orange color with a light, white head that dissipated quickly, but left a ring. The beer gave off a nice light rye and malty aroma with a hint of yeast/bready-ness to it. The taste of the beer was good; a nice light rye flavor with little to no hops to note, but it was not overly sweet. The beer had a moderate feel to it; the beer was smooth and very easy to drink. Overall, a good beer."
""
""
"O: I've only had two other marzens, and this was better than both - the kind of beer to turn you onto a style (if its typical of the style) - great drinkability, wonderful flavor and aroma profile - another slam-dunk from Great Divide."

"Pours up apricot color with a one finger off white head. Retention is poor, but there is quite a bit of spotty lacing. The nose is primarily fragrant pine and is the best part of this offering. Taste is spicy rye that is a bit understated with a mild dry finish. Mouthfeel is a little thin,but with adequate carbonation. Not my favorite ever. It sort of reminds me of a few Belgians I've had and didn't care for."
"O-This beer has a nice color to it but...I am not wowed by much else here. The fruity flavors are not assertive, the malts are not assertive, the rye comes across as oxidized and dull. Methinks Great Divide should go back to the well on this one."

"O: Definitely a different take on the marzen style. I prefer those that stick to the roots of the style and explore the depths of malt character. This is more of a rye beer than a marzen to me. The flavor is a bit harsh and doesn't blend particularly well with the malt and cherry."
""
"O- A good brew but nothing spectacular. No real complex flavors or aromas here. I would drink it again but I wouldn't seek it out."
""
"O: Really good Marzen. Smells wonderful and tastes like sweet malt and rye."
""

"O - Overall a good beer. Bold and heavy enough to where you only need one, two at most, for a filling experience."

"On tap at Great Divide. Pours reddish-orange. Slight rye spice and some bread crust. Touch of fruit."
""
"Maybe not a fan favorite, but one of my favorite ryes for sure. Good nearly year round."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not my favorite. Is it a Rye Lager or an Octoberfest? seems to be confused. Much better Marzens out there."
"Overall, an interesting take on an Oktoberfest but not really interesting enough to keep me coming back. A little on the sweet side and this really hinders drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Maybe it's because I enjoy rye in beer so much, but this is better than most Oktoberfests IMO. However, I'm generally not a fan of the style so my review is only worth so much."

"Hoss pours a clean amber/orange, with light carbonation, and little head retention. The aroma is smooth, pristine malt and bread. Smells like the typical german oktoberfest. It's smooth, malty, and very well balanced. The medium body is cut through just slightly by a moderate carbonation, and the malt profile is rich, but not sweet, it's very clean and drinkable. This is one of the best US made oktoberfests I've had. I don't notice the rye much at all, but nonetheless this is a fantastic, well crafted beer."
""
"The body pours a clear amber with some visible carbonation. The head rises about a finger and subsides rather quickly to a thin layer of powdered sugar. Little to no lacing. The nose is of sweet toasted toffee and caramel with a hearty dose of rye. Sweet cherry notes are prominent with a mild, musty, earthy undercurrent. On the palate, cherry notes come to the forefront with sweet toffee/caramel quickly in tow. Mild, earthy hops and rye poke through before a small burst of cherry and caramel in the finish. There is a nice balance between the sweet fruit/caramel notes and earthy hops. A light medium feel, easy drinking with low carbonation. This is a very solid lager that I have overlooked for too long. Good for any time of the year."

"poured into a dimpled mug, beer had an amazing reddish hue. The aroma was pleasingly malty sweet with subtly notes of caramel and fresh (don't know how else to describe it, like when you walk into your veggie garden) Had a medium body that didn't linger on the tongue. Thank goodness, as the flavor was off putting. Started of malty, and sweet, but ended with a tange of brown bread, which I found unappealing. (That might have more to do with the hot dogs baked in beans served with the brown bread that I hated as a kid, than it did with the actually bread) I was very excited when I found this beer, (Mar-zen, and Rye usually peak my intrest) but was extremely disappointed!"
""
""
"Overall, I cannot believe this surprise. For starters, it's a sneaky Oktoberfest, since it's labeled as a Rye Lager. But on BA, it's a marzen, and the best one I've tried this year."
"O- a very good drinkable beer. how representative of the style is it...I'm not sure, but I would definitely drink a few of these."
"This is a very refreshing beer. Great for a session."
""
"O: The rye is not as present as I had hoped for in this beer - I was expecting a little more rye spiciness. The beer is easy to drink because of the lighter rye flavor and well hidden alcohol."
""
"Smells of cherries and psuedo-nutmeg spice over a caramel malt with extra earthy hopping and a touch of breaded yeastiness. Tastes somewhat drier than the nose had me expecting, but still semi-sweet with caramel malt and plenty of toasted bread alongside a light herbal hopping garnish on the finish. The cherries from the aroma are very much subdued upon the palate in the actual flavor, but that's okay, because the caramel malt gains some nuttiness to compensate that wasn't as perceptible in the aroma. If only these aspects carried fully back and forth from nose and palate to present a complete spectrum, this would have been absolutely amazing. As it is, it settles for merely being better than average."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled 12/21/2011. Pours lightly hazy orange amber color with a small 1 finger off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Decent spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of apple, caramel, grape, biscuit, toast, rye, herbal, grass, and light earth. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance. Taste of big biscuit, caramel, rye, nuttiness, apple, toffee, toast, grape, grass, and light herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of caramel, biscuit, toast, rye, light fruits, nuttiness, and herbal on the finish for a bit. Great balance and complexity of flavors; with no cloying at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a great Oktoberfest style! Great flavor body and complexity; very smooth to drink. Really enjoyed this."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good. Nothing to go crazy about but a nice brew to pick up once in a while. Did I mention that the finish is oily as hell?"
""
""
""
"Overall, this is solid fare, presenting a varied and finely tuned selection of flavors that balance each other nicely. The sugars are especially lovely in here, coming in a wide variety of flavors, and all of them blending well with the rye. Worth trying."
""
""
"This was a very tasty beer. I really enjoyed the mix of flavors and balance in this."
"O-Possibly the best Marzen style beer I've had. The rye is a nice addition to a style I do not usually care for."

"Mouthfeel is great- medium body, low carbonation. This is a great marzen. One of the better american ones that I've had."
"The pour is a light amber color with an off-white head. Smells sweet with plenty of cereal and malt notes. A definite rye aroma, some yeast, a little bit of earthy hop character, and a light fruitiness. The rye is very pronounced on the palate. Sweet bread with a bit of toast flavor, some floral and spicy hops, and just a touch of yeast. There is a mild bitterness on the finish."
""
""
""
""
"O: I would say another great beer by the great divide. Easy to drink, flavorful and has a cool label. Very nice Marzen Lager, Hoss is the boss!"
""
"O: Nice beer easy to drink. Quite good for the style."
"The body was crisp and clean, and the Rye flavor lingered for a few moments. Drinkability was very good, I could easily have a few of these at a sitting. Overall, a very nice brew, worth looking for."
"O: Not a bad brew, but a bit lacking in terms of rye character. I wouldn't seek this one out, but I'd happily drink it again."
""
""
""
""
"O- Pretty enjoyable overall, more of an aroma would be nice but the rye flavor is well integrated"
""
""
"D/O: This is a decent American-brewed amber lager that compares favorably to Karl Strauss's own. The brewer has taken some care here to develop tactile qualities of substance, and they overlap into the flavor. Unfortunately for the rye, crispness and spice fight a losing battle against qualities of fruit, caramel, and an overall heaviness that is on the high side for the style."
""
"Overall this is a tasty, but (in my opinion) misleading brew. Tastes like a good Marzen, and within that framework this is a pretty solid representation of the style. Still needs more rye. It's like a very less skillful Surlyfest. I can't say I'd buy a sixer of this, but I would never refuse one. Recommended to any fan of Amber lagers or Marzens. Cheers!"
""
"O: This is a very tasty beer makes me understand why Reinheitsgebot forbid the use of rye in Germany. A very flavorful, spicy and crisp beer."
""
"Overall: Decent beer overall. Not exceptional, but pretty good for a light beer."
"Hoss Rye Lager pours a deep burnt orange/auburn, falling just short of having full clarity. There's a finger or so of white foam capping the beer. It fades pretty quickly, and lacing is fairly spotty. The nose is pretty dull and lifeless, but what is there is nice. There are some bready and toffee aromas, and the delicate spiciness of rye creeps in a little bit in the background. The flavor has a little more vivacity to it, with biscuit and caramel maltiness coming together for a lingering opening. Earthy, lightly peppery rye comes in for the close, but seems to die out before the beer hits the back of my palate. The mouthfeel is definitely not ""crisp"". The body's a little bit chewy, and the carbonation lacking, and leaves the beer giving a syrupy impression. I think a rye marzen could be a pretty interesting beer, but Hoss Rye Lager just suffers on the execution end."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a darker amber reddish color. Had a very thin (less than 1 finger) bubbly white head. Head lasted a while, and clung nicely to the sides. Smell had a touch of sugar, a tad of hops, with a strong wheat/grain profile as well. Taste was extremely well balanced. A small bit of sweet, a little hint of peppery spice, with a mellow banana bread almost. Felt good in the mouth. Coated very well, but the carbonation seemed to be all over the place. At times it was subtle, other times it was up front. Overall a good representation. Not quite sessionable, but not overpowering either."
""
""
"another easy drinking beer, hoss rye lager is an interesting spin on the marzen style. orange amber in color with a short-lived whitish head. carbonation is mild for a lager. hoss delivers welcoming notes of rye alongside caramel malts in the nose. down the hatch you get more maltiness, but not in a syrupy sweet way. clean, dry finish and a medium full body round out the brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'd love to try this rascal on tap."
"O - - a good beer for the style. I like the rye component. Good, but not worth buying again"
""
""
""
""

"O: Incredible beer. Unique and so damn good."
""
""
"This is a good brew with an evenly balanced nut-rye flavor. It goes down easy and doesn't overpower the pallet."
""
""
""
""
""
"Another find at the World of Beers in Altamonte Springs, FL this brew appears golden amber with a solid haze and a modest but stubborn white film on top. Lacing is pretty decent. The aroma brings a pleasant apple caramel malt with an interesting cereal grain that overall makes me want to get a taste. The taste gives me a very interesting tropical fruit over yeasty caramel. And yes, I get many grainy overtones like rye, rice and also a slightly sugary corn malt. It’s medium-light bodied with a very fine but titillating carbonation. Some smokey hints. Very nice."

"Grade: B"
""
"D - Good. I think this is a great malty lager. I'll drink it again, but the style isn't one I seek out."
""
""
"O: A decidedly underwhelming beer from Great Divide, a brewery that's usually pretty consistent."
""
"I suppose the flavors in this with the Belgian hint are actually better than average for this style. Wishing it had more carbonation or better mouthfeel. On tap at Cueva in San Diego."
""
"Deep amber color with some ruby tint. Gorgeous foamy khaki head with very nice retention. Dark rye, oak, wood, hops, and creamy malt. Pleasantly earthy and floral. Rye bread, spices, smooth malts and yeast in the beginning of the taste. A fresh, well rounded medium sized body with moderate carbonation. Crisp mouthfeel with a mildly dry yet refreshing finish. Incredibly easy and comfortable to drink."
""
"Overall: not a bad beer, but the flavor, while interesting, doesn't largely appeal to me."
""
""
""
"A very clear amber beer with two fingers of white head that settle slowly. Lacing is very good. Rye pops out in the aroma, nicely spicy, on top of a very bready malt base. Flavor follows the nose; chewy, bready malt, combined with prominent rye, puts me in mind of pumpernickel. Very well-rounded and refreshing, delicious lager overall, with a nice floral hop note in the finish. Dry and crisp, medium bodied, with medium high carbonation. Quite good and was a welcome antidote to a steady succession of highly hopped west coast ales. Another winner from Great Divide, an underrated brewery making consistently fine, highly drinkable beers."
""
""
""
""
"O- Above average with good parts. No real weakness to this beer."
""
""
" Overall, very drinkable reminded me more of a bock than what's listed on the site or on the label style wise. Decent just like their scotch ale that I've had, but I haven't found a Great Divide that would make me seek it out."
""
""
"Pours an amber color with a transient light cream foam and excellent clarity; no lace. Smells of honey, munich malts and some tea like character. Nice nose. Flavor follows with some sweet honey malts and a little bit of tea like character from hops/malts. Body is a little heavy (expected from addition of Rye) with light carb and a semi dry finish. Nice beer, would drink on a pint special."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden amber with a finger cap of barely off-white head. Great lacing and minimal beading. The nose is big on the rye - earthy spice and nice, toasty malt to balance. Doesn't come across as a Marzen one bit. Taste: there's the Marzen... I wish the rye was highlighted a bit more on the tongue. Still a perfectly drinkable brew. Feel is a bit boring - thin and brief. Overall, not what I was expecting but still decent I suppose."
""
""
""
"O - Overall it's not a bad drink. It doesn't thrill and the bitterness might be a turn off for some without the joyful hop aroma that should accompany it. It makes me wonder if the bitterness is from the rye or from the hops. I haven't much experience with rye brews some I'm, perplexed."
""
""
"O: The taste problems make this one a pass for me, sucks since I am a big Great Divide fan."
""
"O: Im a fan of this stuff. It's not a style which I frequent however I'm going to be paying more attention to it. This is a fine beer."
""
""
""
""
"A ruby red/light brown fused appearance with a very small white head. Smooth aroma of rye fused malt. Maybe a little cherry in there but maybe that's just me looking for it because I saw that ingredient mentioned on the bottle. Starts off sweet from the heavy malt base and some cherries. Slowly but surely a little hops kick inn towards the end and the rye asserts itself in the finish. A heavy body to this, kinda syrupy mouthfeel to this with very little carbonation. Overall, this one seemed to grow on me. While I do find it to be a little too much on the sweet side for me the 2nd half of this beer seems to counter that sweet aspect well enough that I found myself enjoying it overall. The taste that sits with you after a sip is a nice combo of the malt, the spicy rye, and a little hops and I enjoyed that. This beer is definitely a sipper, definitely the antithesis to a session beer, imo. I probably won't be running back to the store to pick up more of this right away but it is a beer I will drink again."

"A nice solid average Marzen. A good winter Lager."
"Reviewed on: 03-17-2011 21:58:26"
""
""
""
""
"Overall? I'm not entirely sold. The beer seems unbalanced. Fruit, rye, and yeast seem to compete over an average malt base, and they rarely all seem complementary at the same time. It's not a bad beer by any stretch. I just don't think it has a defining characteristic or drinking experience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a bright reddish amber. Aromas of toasted malts and rye bread. In the taste, spicy rye, caramel, toffee, toasted malt and some complimentary spicy hop notes. Peppery, biting, with a good malt foundation. Alittle diacetyl is noted, given the lager yeast, not too out of place. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a crisp carbonation. Overall, a pretty decent offering from Great Divide. Having had few rye marzens, I consider this a success."
""
"O: All in all, this is a decent brew. I've have many better in the style, but it's still a good drinker. If I was craving a good Oktoberfest though, this would not be what I grab by any means."
""
"Not bad, would recommend"
"This is a more bold version of your standard marzen style beers. The rye adds a spicy finish and the dark fruit offers a nice change of pace. The syrupy finish and the sweet caramel notes aren't overbearing, but do wear on me."
""

"A decent beer, and though I don't think it was old to the point of being ruined, I would like to try it a bit more fresh."
"O - On an absolute scale, this is a damn fine beer, and a nice twist on the marzen style. However, like others in the style, I don't feel too inclined to drink this one in quantity because of the bitterness level, along with the spiciness."
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Interesting take on a Marzen. The appearance is nothing special, but the rye shines out and works with everything else in the beer. Nice and I would probably try again if offered."
""
"Not quite as malty/heavy as most Marzens, but drinkable and enjoyable. Nothing to write home about but I'm glad for having tried it."
"O: This was okay, and I would like to try this again next year early just so that I can give it a fair shake. However, the bottle I just tried didn't do much for me."
""
""
"Overall: A Märzen with a spicy twist, this is another winner for Great Divide"
""
"I don't know that I agree with its current classification as a Marzen, nor do I think would the brewery."
"Pours a dark copper color with a thin off white head. Average lacing on the side of my snifter glass. Very clear in appearance, despite the darker color. The nose is very nice- malt, caramel, toffee, bread, and some rye. Very pleasant- especially as it warms. Taste is the same profile as the nose, with some burned toast added to the mix. Very tasty, with caramel, toast, and rye out front on the taste. Feel is medium- w/ little carbonation. Very clean and refined feel. Overall, a totally solid brew for the style. I would drink this again. Cheers."
"Poured into a Pilsner glass, amber body with a scant head that leaves wet lacing. Smell is sweet with a clean grain aroma. The taste follows through with a nice breadiness on the tail end. This is a great-drinking Marzen with a nice twist adding the rye. I will definitely seek this one out more."

"Great Divide Hoss Rye Lager: This one is worth a try! The color has a tinge of red and a fair amount of carbonation. The head is off-white, about a finger thick and multidimensional. The head does fade, letting the beautiful beer color shine through, but is does lace the glass nicely. Aroma is subtle and yeasty, and as you near the bottom of the glass, a scent of iron filings comes through. The flavor is well balanced, the malt and bitter nicely cancel each other out. The finish is very dry, and it is only in the aftertaste that you get the rye. Very easy drinking beer that goes well with food."

"Overall, a nice take on the rye lager. I wouldn't turn this one down if offered, but a bit too much on the sweet-cherry side for my liking."

"O - This award-winning beer can only be classified as a lager on technicality- I'm sure it used lager yeast (which results in the light body), but the complex malt character and hop support place is firmly in the ale category based on what I expect to find in an ale. A very interesting recipe."

"OVERALL: This is a rare miss for Great Divide in my opinion. Which is too bad, because I had high hopes for a rye lager."
"Taste is slightly bitter, but very refreshing. A little more spice than typical for most Marzens I have tasted. I think that is why I enjoy it. Typical lager crispness. Very light bodied."
"Appearance is a dark amber color, perfectly clear, with a big white head on top. The scent is a great balance of spicy rye malt and sweet fruit. Bread notes come through most in the taste, with a spicy rye and a slight hop bitterness keeping things interesting. This is not my favorite style by any means, but this was a very enjoyable beer."
"Pours a dark, rich copper color with small tan head that dissipates quickly. I could smell the rye malt before i even brought the glass up to my nose. The smell is dominated by the sweet malt with herbal and spicy notes as well. The taste is sweet without being overly so. As it warms the beer does begin to thin out and that would be the only real drawback to this beer. Overall it is very solid beer and a welcome change of pace to other Oktoberfest beers."
"o-decent balanced lager. nothing too exceptional about it but it is drinkable and can compliment different meals."
"Gave it a vigourous pour and received a good layer of foam that slowly died down atop a ruby-amber colored beer. Muted malty aroma on the nose, and the hints of cherry and dark fruits that the description on the label promises. Mellow taste. It’s sweet around the edges but not overpoweringly so. More like dark cherry, perhaps some cherrywood, or whiskey-soaked cherry, if I was pressed to pin it down. The rye gives it an edge, but I’d be hard pressed to describe just what, exactly. Like a sweeter, less hoppy ryePA, I suppose. Different from what I’d expect from a marzen but that’s not a bad thing. Another winner from the Great Divide."
"A pretty good beer with a different take on the Octoberfest style."
"D - I'm usually not partial to the addition of rye, but GD has made this one work nicely."
"Overall: seemed like this was apopular one when I was trying it at the brewery. Not very complex and focused on the fruitiness as oppose to the beer quality."
"The mouthfeel is a little on the heavier side for the style with carbonation being a little below average. Overall it was a pretty solid and tasty beer. I really liked that it had some uniqueness to it that set it apart from other beers of the style. The cherry and rich malty notes were very good as well in it. Overall a very solid beer."
"pours a mellow 5:00 sun color, with tiny happy bubbles. smells like a rye beer, possibly overwhelmingly so... but taste is smooth and fair, even, understatedly robust. makes me want a bigger sip. second impression is more steadfast, lingering yet thin somehow in the mouthfeel. a paradox in many ways this rye lager is worth a thirsty quaff!"
"6pak of this from Total Wine & More for $8.99."
"O: This is a nice take on the Marzen style which tends to be rather unremarkable at times. The hint of rye does help Hoss establish itself from its counterparts. Very easy drinking and goes nicely with the impending fall weather."
"O: This is an awesome German-style lager; seriously, one of the best I’ve had from an American brewery. Great nose, excellent taste profile (gotta love that rye), and a full-bodied feel make this a very memorable drink. Great Divide just jumped, as far as my internal ratings go; keep it up, guys!"
"Light, crisp, slightly grainy. Very easy to drink."
"Overall: Solid beer, definitely a good change of pace for me since I drink a lot of ales. Great Divide always makes good beers and this is no exception. They Rye gives it a bit of uniqueness you won't find as well. Worth trying."
"Not a bad beer. I see this pairing well with certain foods."
"I'm not getting a whole lot of rye flavor but I like this one."
"OK so this is not the most exciting lager I have ever drunk, it is still good. And if you’re buying I would not turn this down. At 6.2 % ABV it definitely is a session beer. I would have liked more hops but the lable does state that this is intended to be a lager in the German Marzen style so it may be exactly what it is supposed to be. A very well balanced and highly drinkable brew. I did consider that this sample might be too old or have been mishandled, if so I will edit this review."
"I was drawn to this beer specifically by the label. I found that it got my attention so I figured I'd try it. The beer poured out as a reddish amber color. The head was an off white and had a pretty good retention to it. The lacing wasn't a that great. The smell of the beer had a little bit of a rye aroma to it, mostly smelled like a typical lager. The taste of the beer is pretty good, it had a good malt backbone with the rye kicking in with just a touch of spice to it. The mouthfeel is drinkable and feels like it could be a casual drinking beer. Overall I liked it quite a bit and would probably drink it again."
"The brew pours out as a copper-colored body, subtly hazy, medium, soft tan colored head with lots of lacing. The scent is toasty malt, sweet candy, some cherry, touch of spice with some of that rye grain as well. The taste is a well-put together marzen. Sweet caramel malt front, rye grain, fairly spicy, some cherry influence, bready, toasty, maybe a touch of lemon zest, just a bit of grass. Medium bodied and very creamy. It deviates slightly from the classic marzen style, but it is well-done regardless."
"Drake"
"O: Overall fairly nice, the rye gives it a smoothness and a nice flavor. Malty, and tasty, the smell is a little lack luster, but overall quite enjoyable."
"This brew pours out a nice orange-amber color, with decent head retention and lacing. The aroma is zesty and fairly generically ""beery," the taste is much better. It boasts a full mailtiness, along with a nice amount of zest from the rye. Very easy-drinking and quite delicious. The mouthfeel is nice, but the drinkability is the real star of the show. This drinks quite easily for the slightly elevated ABV."
"Wonderful layered flavor and very easy drinking. Light fuzz inhibits taste slightly but it’s an otherwise great lager I could drink quite a few of as I’m rather partial to all the flavors in here."
"O: Overall has a spicy quality, one you expect from in a rye, but also offers a good smooth drinkability, crisp like a lager and easily drinkable in numbers."
"Pours a nice red burnt orange with a nice beige head. Aroma of spicey earthy hops, some sweet lightly toasted malt, yeasty notes. Taste is sweet eathy spiciness with some light toasted rye and grains, yeasty. Palate is nice medium body with good carbonation. Finish is sweet eathy spicy with light toasted rye grains undertones some breadiness and some hops ending to add some balance, has a slightly nutty ending. Overall a very nice brew. Very enjoyable"
"Overall - Great for the style of beer that it is. Easy enough to drink, and different with the rye flavor. The malt aftertaste is a little sour at the end but overall, a nice change of style beer."
"Hoss pours out a clear golden orange color with a creamy finely bubbled head. The aroma is true to the Märzen style, so you get a pleasant whiff of toasted malts, dark fruits, and a very light spiced rye. Hoss tastes of strong sweet caramel notes with earthy spiced rye underlying it all. There’s also a little hop bitterness on the swallow that fades gradually. The drink of the beer is creamy and enjoyable and you likely wouldn’t guess it’s a 6.2% ABV beer. Nice to have a year-round Märzen."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer overall. I like the blend. The Rye is done well so that it accents the beer rather than running the show. There is still obviously enough to taste, and I am glad that they told me it was there as I might have mistaken its presence for earthy hops or something else at first. Either way, I will finish what I have, and will not fear a lager from Great Divide as they seem to know how to brew one."
"Beer pours a clear reddish amber color with a tall frothy head that dissipated fairly quickly but left a nice bit of lacing on the glass. Aromas are caramel, red fruit, cherries, and bread. Flavor has a nice malty sweetness with just enough hops to keep it from being cloying. Low carbonation but seems pretty true to style (at least from the other Marzens I have had), overall a nice American interpretation of the German style."
"O: This is a really nice Marzen. 4"
"It was Friday night after a hockey game and I stopped by a friends house to part take in a couple of beverages. The first was Great Divide's Hoss Rye Lager. The appearance was good...a nice copper clear color with good carbonation and thin white head. The smell had subtle hints of cherry and rye. The taste was very good even as the temperature warmed. Certainly could pick up the cherry at the front, but then came off the pallete clean like most rye lagers/ales will. This beer was very smooth and enjoyable. I would have preferred a bit more hop."
"Pours a crystal clear light amber color with a 1/2 inch bone colored head that fades to a fizzy film on the top of the beer. Thin rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smells of malt/biscuit and spicy rye notes. Taste is of toasty malt/biscuit flavors with a spicy rye taste that is very enjoyable. This beer has high carbonation with a nice crisp and clean moutfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with nice rye flavors from Great Divide. I am glad I got to try this one as it is not distributed to CA."
"Bottled on April 20, 2011. Copper orange in color with very good clarity. Started with a fizzy off-white cap that quickly dissipated. Sweet caramel, bready, and toasted malt aromas....clean and fresh smelling. Body is on the heavier side, rich and malty with light carbonation. Sweet caramel malt and toasted malt flavors from beginning to end. Tangy carbonation in the middle transitions to a light floral hoppy bitterness to the finish. Finishes crisp and dry. Although this is not my preferred style, I thoroughly enjoyed this Marzen. Very malty. Fairly simple. But excellent."
"O: Pretty good beer overall. A solid beer that would be a great change up from more traditional marzens. The rye adds an extra layer of depth with earthy flavors. Another good six pack beer to have in the fridge, and a great beer to go for when nothing else is sounding great. Would really be a great fall, cooler weather beer."
"D/O- I could just keep drinking this for days...very refreshing. I can't believe I've been passing this one up all this time. I believe a BMC fan would enjoy this lager."
"says it was bottled in mid August (nearly 10 months ago). Perhaps that explains the lackluster head..."
"O: Actually I thought this was a pretty fine beer. Definitely need to explore more beers in this style so I can compare. But would definitely buy again. On clearance for $1.79/12oz. bottle. Don't know what a six pack goes for, but Great Divide is usually pretty expensive. Going back tomorrow to see if the other 3 bottles are there."
"O- Give this to a a macro drinker to offer them a little different flavor than a Budweiser, but skip it yourself for something much better."
"O: The beer is easy to drink because it isn’t very filling, the rye doesn’t make it overly spicy and there are no traces from alcohol in the taste."
"A pretty dynamic Marzen with nice balance between the various flavor profiles; however, overall the flavors are somewhat reserved."
"Again, this is very easy to drink and I am looking forward to finding this in the fall when it's more in season. Nicely done GD."
"O: Not offensive, but definitely nothing I'd consider drinking again. A tough struggle for me to make it through all 12 ounces. Reminds me way too much of Sackets Harbor War of 1812 ale."
"Pours an amber color with very little head. Smells of rye, grain, and, well, brewing beer (if you've ever experienced it before). Taste is pretty mellow - no real bite to it, and again, a rye taste. Very nice, refreshing lager. Did not know it was considered an Oktoberfest beer...I was under the impression it was simply a rye lager. Very distinctive taste, not your ordinary run-of-the-mill lager. Nice alternative to the mass produced swill."
"Overall a decent beer and one of the better americn oktoberfest beers ive had, but thats not saying much. Looking forward to more great divide beers while on location in denver, but may not be looking this one up again."
"This beer pours a clear bronze color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes slowly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of spicy rye, spicy hops, and hints of caramel. It is strong and very appealing. The taste is maltier than the aroma with more caramel and toffee. There is still some spicy hops and rye, but it is more in the background. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a very good beer that I will certainly drink again."
"D: Very high, this is a quality beer, and I'd love to have it in the late summer on a hot day!"
"D - Very drinkable. The balance of flavors here is really great and there it far from feels empty. To me, this is a really solid octoberfest beer."
"O - This is a nice rye lager/oktoberfest. Some areas could use a boost but all in all it paired nicely with the Easter sunday ham."
"D - quite easy drinking with the low abv."
"This is a great example of a what a rye beer can be; it uses rye as a subtle enhancement to a great tasting amber beer."
"I love Oktoberfest beers as much as the next guy, but I never would have thought in a thousand years I would be rating one as highly (nor enjoying one as much) as I am now. Hoss evidently tells us two things about märzens: one) despite centuries of the finest German craftsmanship, there was still room for improvements; and, two) the only thing more impressive than Great Divide's quality and consistency is their ingenuity."
"O: Good beer, with a distinct rye flavor for the style. The crispness works well with these flavors."
"O= A nice Ofest for the spring. Not much rye is present in it but it is there is ya search hard enough. Check it out if ya want. I may not visit this one again however."
"all in all, I'm not crazy about the flavor profile - a touch fruity and less malty and rye-y than I was hoping, but it's solid and I could easily convince myself to drink this one regularly."
"Unusual, and quite delicious!"
"Mostly clear, orange in colour, with a thin cap of very fine beige bubbles. A bit of sticky lace, decent head retention. Mild aroma, mostly malty with notes of toasted bread, toast, hint of caramel, and faint fruitiness. The rye may be adding a bit of complexity to the nose, but it's subtle. Bitterness was apparent from the start, becoming more pronounced in the finish with a lingering lemony hop flavour. More of the same malt character as in the aroma, but a little more earthy. Same fruitiness too. Nice texture, medium bodied with average carbonation, some dryness. Overall, I liked the way it came together. Very drinkable and tasty."
"D - Easy to drink and very sessionable."
"from the bottle to a pint glass. Pours a light amber with a foamy head. Nice lacing, dissipation is prolonged. Nose of malts and maybe some caramel. Taste is strong for a marzen, the malts are heavy and the alcohol is slightly present. Notes of caramel and light fruit with a sweet hop finish. Very drinkable"
"Pours a clean orange-ish to yellow in color with an off white head. In the aroma, dry rye and standard lager like smells. In the taste, dry rye, small apple like fruitiness, and hints of being a lager. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry rye like aftertaste. Bigger body than expected, nice rye presence, and almost felt like an ale."
"A nice introduction to the rye adjunct for me, I'd been looking forward to trying this one for some time. A solid brew, quaffable and a good introduction beer to rye and oktoberfest style in general especially since this one is year round."
"I'd make a Gunsmoke or Bonanza joke here, but I can't remember which one had Hoss as a character, and I don't really feel like looking it up. Regardless, this stuff pours a clear copper topped by a half-finger of cream-white foam. The nose comprises caramel, light mandarin orange, rye bread, light honey, and a touch of toffee. The taste spotlights the (now stronger) orange and caramel, with some light pinches of black pepper in the background. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a pretty decent brew, nothing mind-blowing, but a nice little quaff."
"D- Very high. I didn't ask for this the bartender just handed this to me. But I did order several more the rest of the night. A rye beer anyone can enjoy"
"D - Should be enjoyed by most anyone, very drinkable with good but not strong flavors, a good choice for rye virgins 4"
"Drinkability - All in all this beer isn't bad. Pretty solid really. Worth a try if nothing else catches your eye. It's fairly easy to drink, but not quite sessionable. This beer seems like a Fall seasonal to me."
"I would recommend this, it is really just a smooth drink, nothing exceptional"
"Overall, not a shabby rendition of a classic style with some welcome tweeks. I could see myself sitting outside on a fall day munching on a hot dog or burger with a few of these, some friends, and a good conversation. The rye isn't overwhelming yet adds to the aroma, body, and mouthfeel. Worth a try if you enjoy the Oktoberfest style."
"D: Despite the ABV, you could almost session this. It's that good."
"Although according to the bottle sticker, this brew is marketed as a rye lager, I can definitely see where the discrepancy between that of an Oktoberfest/Marzen comes into play. Pours a dark amber hue with slight carbonation and a medium-bodied head. The rye notes are dominant in both the aroma and overall flavor. Grainy, amber taste inherent with viscous malts along with bread and butter nuances dominate the palate. A solid offering from Great Divide."
"D - pretty drinkable. another fine brew from great divide."
"Pours a cloudy red amber with the scent of wheats and some spices. Has a rather robust taste to it that is slighty bitter and leaves a kind of chalky after taste. Not bad in my opinion, but I can also see where someone might not like it. Good for once in a while, but not going to be an everyday kind of beer."
"You can tell this brew gives a nod to the marzen style, and given the fact that I love marzens and rye beers, I expected to like this more. But the other spices mixed in make this brew lose its focus a bit. Not bad though."
"A word of warning: don't let this beer warm, or you're in for an unpleasant surprise. Drink it cold to avoid the unpleasant intricacies that come out as it warms, or your rating will fall as mine did."
"D: I really enjoyed this one, it is a good blend of Munich and rye malt."
"Poured a light gold body with decent head on top of it w/ a slightly citric hop and grainy yet semi-sweet caramel malt aroma. Taste is less dry than typical for style, but still I will say beer is dryish, spicy, minor hop bitterness but grapefruit seems to sneak in there. Light-bodied and crisp the beer goes down smooth w/ not much complexity at all; an easy to drink marzen that is a little tweak of the general style and while I enjoyed this beer I can't say one of my faves."
"On tap at the Great Divide tasting room. Amber with reddish tinge, a bit of lace. A good mouthfeel. Served cold and since room was cold it did not warm up too much. Carbonation is right there. A spicy rye edge, some fruitiness with the spice.Neutral aroma."
"D:Nice crisp taste along with a crisp flavor on the end. Super easy drinking beer"
"This is a nice, easy drinking beer that has a good amount of flavor. Despite my disappointment with the taste, I do think that this is a beer that I would try again, and it would be a nice one to drink while watching a game or having a meal."
"Reasonably drinkable because it isnt overly heavy. Pretty straightforward solid Marzen/Oktoberfest beer."
"I like the lighter Festbiers and this is surely that, but this is more of a Rye Beer than anything else in my view, even as a lager. Light in color with light use of Munich malts and a strong hoppiness give this beer a smooth feel and drink."
"Drink - The beer was quite drinkable, but it didn't really stand out as anything special. I'm happy that I gave it a shot but would not seek it out again."
"D: Drinkable ,yes a good beer but there are many better in this style still a good overall beer."
"D- a decent beer and anything from great divide is good to drink in my book."
"Sort of a limp orangish amber color, with almost no visible carbonation, fairly decent head. Smell is of hazelnuts and a spicy rye note. Some clean floral hops in there, too. Nicely filled out aroma. Taste is quite good, malty but balanced. Bready and creamy, super mellow finish. Slight tinny flavor, nothing too distracting. Unique tastes, but hey, its is GD-- this ain't a Miller's. Big bodied beer, big and heavy and mellow. Not something I'd session with, a nice treat of a beer."
"Draught @ Mikro: This one poured a clear amber color. There was about a finger of an off-white head, that left some lacing. Decent enough aroma. Some caramel malt, some graininess and a hint of the rye. The taste is also good. It is neutral, being neither bitter or sweet. Some grain and rye flavors. Very smooth and easy to drink."
"Amber with some haze. Produces a small fine head with good retention. Moderate amount of small carbonation bubbles. Bready/spicy aroma with a with a fair amount of caramel sweetness. Medium body leaning toward the heavy side. Some alcohol up front. Carbonation is on the soft side making for a good balance with the body. Spicy middle, where the rye is evident, and rich finish. Bitterness has legs. A definite colder weather beer. A bit heavy for temps above 80."
"overall well made beer"
"D - Great blend of complex flavors make this an easy drink to guzzle down; I definitely enjoyed the beer and would have a few more; I would make this a staple Oktoberfest beer in my fridge"
"The flavor is rich and full of toasted grains. Its very rich but not over bearing. The grain character is very smooth but sharp at the same time. The rye is also blended very well. It can be a very powerful flavor and Great Divide did a good job just letting it impart a tartness in the aftertaste."
"D: Prety good."
"D: Very nice. This beer is going down very quickly. At 6.2% it's a tad bit strong for an Octoberfest/Marzen, but you wouldn't know it from the quaffability factor."
"Pretty nice Marzen. Worth trying for sure, especially if you love rye in beer."
"D. Drinkable. Not a bad take on the Octoberfest style. Better than a lot of other Ofests that I have had. Nothing mind blowing, but a good easy drinking beer."
"this beer pours a nice orangish red color with an off white head that recedes to lacing very quickly. the lager yeast are deffinitely doing there thing in the nose, the taste brings a lot of malty sweetness, with a definite biscuity taste at the end with a bit of spice to round it out. the medium body and over all good taste make this a pretty drinkable marzen."
"Overall - This is a decent, but not mind-blowing Marzen IMO. Definitely worth a shot if you're a fan of the style though."
"One of the better Octoberfest/Marzen beers that I've had."
"Out of a bottle this ""Rye Lager"" was a hazy, copper color with one finger of orange/khaki head. The retention was only as a thing collar and the lacing was not much to speak of either. Scattered spots at best. The aroma was strong with the ways of the grain, rye, wheat and some wet grass. Behind that was a more traditional caramel malt backbone. The flavors were a good, balanced blend of a Marzen/Rye beer with lots of grain presence, strong notes of caramel and rye, some butterscotch, hints of kettle corn, a little earth and very little hops presence. A festival beer, for sure; very quaffable. The body was medium, the carbonation light and the mouthfeel a little watery. A great food beer. One could easily throw these back with a schnitzel or two. The dry, grainy finish was a bit much for me, on it's own, however."
"This is an excellent example of the marzen style. The flavors are very complex and well balanced. The rye added an interesting touch. Unique and tasty!"
"Overall: Hoss is a nice little spin on the Marzen style and I liked it. I'll seek out more rye inclusive brews as a result."
"D- Highly drinkable. This is very refreshing, great taste. I'm not real fond of this style, but the flavors in here are better than most other oktoberfests I've tried. Would love to make this a session beer. Don't know if I'd go for a case but I'd love to pick up a six pack somewhere. Since I live east of the Mississippi that will probably be hard for me to find. So far so good from Great Divide. Already have my mind set on buying a case of Old Ruffian come mid december. This Haas will prost to Hoss any day."
"Overall: Meh. Interesting brew, but not what I was expecting from the style or from the rye emphasis on the label. Not an all together bad effort, but either making the rye malt pop or changing this style classification and tinkering a bit would help this one go from good to great."
"A nice change of pace and quite drinkable, although the combination of spice and bitterness on the finish became a little much after a while."
"Overall, this is a fine craft lager that, while it doesn't remind me of Marzens, is quite drinkable. Somewhat sadly, I only pick up the rye notes in the scent. There's nothing wrong here, and I could definitely pick this one up again if I'm in the mood for a hoppy, maltier-than-average lager."
"Medium bodied, higher carbonation, some dryness in the feel. Pretty solid drinking for the style, and the 6.2% isn't detectable at all really. Not exactly a thrilling beer, but solid for the season."
"D-Quite drinkably, characteristic of typical Marzen brews, with the additional fun of having some rye characteristics added into the profile."
"The bottle I got foamed like everything when I opened it - so have a towel handy! Aside from that, it pours a nice, appetizing brownish copper with a fairly thick, if not persistent, light tan head. Aroma is fruity and rye-ish, not strong but still appealing. Flavor is like a good rye bread with a fruity undertone, mainly apple and pear, with a hint of hops. Texture is smooth and fizzy, leaving a subtle tingle and a hint of rye."
"Not my style of beer, but there is no denying that this stuff is done right."
"D: a well-made maerzen, but not a particularly well-made rye beer."
"Clear amber-orange brew gives a half inch of thick creamy beige head. Smell is faint but somewhat malty and a bit of spice. On the tongue it leads with a thin sugary apricot sweetness, the quite separate from that there's some rye spice and hop. It's pretty disjointed, a giant rift running through the middle of it... sweetness way over here, spice and hop waaaay over there, nothing in the middle. As it warms the sweet side develops a bit of warm vanilla. The feel is on the light side of moderate, reasonably creamy with soft carbonation. I disagree with the label claim of ""crisp"". Despite it's flaws, it is highly drinkable. Alcohol is hidden well. Finishes with a little lingering sweetness and a bit of metallic twang."
"Overall: A great clean malty beer that's crisp and well-balanced. Glad this is in full production now."
"D An easy drinking beer, would have another. 3.5    "
"D: This was a nice rye beer with crisp scent and taste, and solid body. It was easy to drink, too. Despite it being a lager rather than an ale, I think it would be interesting to have this side by side with Founder's Red's Rye and Bear Republic Hop Rod."
"the place i had it at coined it as a rye lager. pour is a beautiful amber clear with a nice sufficent head of sticky lace. the nose is toasty malt and apple. actually a nice marzen quality to it. with a wonderful feel of great carbonation that doesn't come off as hash palated or husky in nature. smooth and malty but backed with a crisping quality. a fantastic session beer if you can get your hands on it."
"D-Interesting take on a Marzen and quite an enjoyable beer. I could go for a sixer of this every fall no problem."
"Drinkability: Good session brew."
"The 6.20% ABV is a bit stronger that I would have liked it to be but I could see myself having a few in one setting. The mouthfeel to this leads to a good consistency and once again, Great Divide has a beer on their hands that I've enjoyed. This could be the most middle-of-the-road beer that I'll have until the darker offerings hit the shelves..."
"D: This is easy to drink ""Oktoberfest"". It reminds me more of a Rye Beer with that much rye present. I enjoy rye beers so I enjoyed this a lot."
"O - Had this in the middle of an epic tasting, and it just fell way short in the midst of many superlative beers. Not bad so much as just ""meh"" in every category."
"The body bangs out at a solid depth, dry finish with a clean aftertaste. Any more booze and the mouthfeel would be weak, but as it stands, this is session-ready and good for almost any occasion."
"Drinkability - fairly intriguing lager. Complex enough in taste to keep it interesting, and not bad tasting either."
"D: This is great American Marzen. All the classic flavors are there, and the Rye compliments it nicely. Another solid offering from Great Divide."
"Very, very tasty oktoberfest here. I highly approve of this effort. Spot on!"
"Drinkability: If it was available in my area I'd love to grab a six pack as it's a fantastic Autumn time beer."
"D: This is super drinkable, not as light in body as many other marzen's but still a killer flavor that is constant with the Great Divide brew."
"Pretty tasty."
"D- ABV is slightly high to make this a session, and I can see the coating getting annoying after awhile, but its crispness, wonderful rye flavor, and spiciness make this beer a pleasure to drink. Big fan! Go out and get this."
"drinkability is high, a refreshing and flavorful lager."
"Notes: This beer drinks wonderfully and has some nice complexity but there is nothing about this beer that makes me think Marzen/Oktoberfest."
"The taste however is a bit off. Really sharp rye and hop flavor up front with the sweetness right behind. Definitely not a session beer. The flavor combo is interesting but takes a toll on drinkability."
"D: It's supremely sessionable. Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience."
"It's pretty much a toss-up this fall in the house between 6-packs of Hoss and 6-packs of Bob's '47 from Boulevard as an everyday beer."
"Verdict: Hoss is a great little beer. Easy drinking and full of character, I could easily mistake this for an authentic German brew. Good to see a tasty Märzen that's available outside of fall."
"D - Quite drinkable. Great rye beer, the only downside was the smell, which was just a little too strong."
"pretty well carbonated, pretty thick, tasty beer. very enjoyable as the nights get a bit cooler."
"O: Started off slow, but by the end I was really enjoying it. Solid selection from Great Divide."
"Notes: This bottle says it was bottled September 3, 2009. So either the labeller is off or this beer is more than a year old."
"The body was medium, and very smooth. The carbonation added no more than a tickle, and the finish was dry. This is a good easy to drink beer with excellent balance and bold flavor."
"D: This ""rye lager"" posing as a ""marzen"" was just a little off-base for me and I'd be reluctant to try it again. A weird balance of flavors, or lack of balance, and an ABV with odd, residual flavors hindered the drinkability and my overall enjoyment of the brew. Back to the drawing board on this one I say."
"This beer is weird as hell. Others i had it with found it strange too."
"I really enjoyed this. More than 3 of these would be fatiguing, but I really like the toasty grain and earthy flavor. I would buy it again. Recommended."
"Solid Marzen/Oktoberfest, wouldn't say it's up there with my favorites in the style, but a solid brew overall."
"Slainte."
"I really enjoy this beer. Great divide is really expressing themselves and stretching themselves beyond their usual boundaries of extremely strong syrupy beers and have created a great rye lager here. Search it out..."
"Pours a clear dark reddish amber with a medium creamy tan head that fades fast. Leaves a bit of lacing as it dies down. Smell is primarily sweet malt. Taste is hearty rich malt up front, with a pear flavored middle, and a toasty, earthy finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, low carbonation. Quite drinkable. Not your average Marzen, this is a very good beer that I would get again."
"Pours a clear copper with a small off-white head. Has fascinating aromas that remind me of strawberry shortcake; the fruitiness is completely unexpected! The flavor profile, on the other hand, is not fruity in the least. It's almost completely comprised of austere malts: very bready, toasty, biscuity and woody flavors, with a very slight caramel sweetness. One of the breadiest beers I've tasted. A very tasty marzen that would happily buy again."
"Had this on tap first at the Bavarian lodge in lisle. The beer has a great coppery red hue with a caramel foamy head that fades to decent lacing. Being a rye beer I sometimes find them off putting. However this beer has a very smooth and creamy taste with a good balance of hops and malts. The smell is rather tasty as well. I am becoming a fast fan of great divide beers. This one is really worth checking out"
"D - this is a very solid beer. Perfect for sessioning throughout the night. I'll have to seek this one out again."
"As for drinkability, the cold glass of beer literally vanished before me. I'm now staring at an empty glass forcing myself to wait a minute before I go grab another, lest I set a pace that will have me passed out by 8pm."
"Not for me, though. You? Please, enjoy."
"Overall, a rather drinkable beer. While the bottle proclaims itself ""crisp", I'd go more for smooth. This is the last of a six that I've consumed over the better part of a year, so while it is enjoyable, there are other, better lagers out there."
"Marzens are probably my favorite style of beer and I love this. Great Divide is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries. Recommended."
"Will seek this one out again."
"I was about to grab another 6 of GDBC Claymore but decided to try this. Glad i did."
"This beer really reminds me of Great Lakes Conway's Irish Ale. The bottle mentions it being a rye lager and marzen style. Whatever you want to call it, it's unique. Nice change of pace."
"Edit: I've since had it again and still get the peanut butter and dried strawberry notes, but no one else that was drinking it did, so take it for what its worth."
"Drinkability: A great session lager with an interesting flavor. I wish I'd have thought of it."
"D-I'd prefer a little more carbonation than what I got, especially for this style. That being said, this is a pretty original brew, but not one I'd buy again. I'm glad for the experimentation, but not the biggest fan of this one."
"D: Pretty good and tasty crisp beer. This will be a definite summer/fall pick for me."
"A bit hoppier than average for the marzen style, and the rye does seem to lend a touch of sharpness. Nice bright color with firm body. Moderate roasted carmel malt sweetness, promptly followed by hops bittering with the rye note ending sharp. Not a distinctive beer, but certainly worthwhile."
"Fairly good example of the style but fails to stand-up to its German counterparts. The body is a little light for a Marzen but the head was a nice not-too-thin cap. Aroma is primarily biscuit-like malt with a nominal caramel character and ever-so-slight spice/earthy quality given from the hops. Flavors here are pretty standard for a Marzen with an emphasis on the malt; however, the mouthfeel is a bit too thin lacking the lingering bread notes a Marzen usually carries. The added rye probably lends to this as this one finishes noticeably dry. A very refreshing beer with enough hop character to balance out the malt focus, which makes for a solid summer brew."
"Drinkability: Mainly tastes like a slightly too sweet Marzen, with just a tinge of rye. Good malt taste but could have used more rye and/or hops."
"Notes: Enjoyable. I am really interested in trying more rye beers; the only other one I have sampled to date has been Saranacs Rye Pilsner, which I also enjoyed. I was hoping to try this with some corn beef and cabbage as rye bread is great with that meal."
"Great Divide Hoss is a crystal clear amber lager with a dense, creamy, off-white head that thins out and leaves thick sheets of lacing on the glass. It has a spicy aroma with notes of rye, citrus, grass and maybe corinder. It's medium bodied, smooth and creamy with a crisp, dry finish that leaves the mouth a little chalky. It's pretty sweet and quite spicy. There are notes of resin, citrus, cherry, pretzels and fruitcake. The aftertaste is spicy. It's a little sweet for my taste. It wasn't a great choice for lawn mowing, but it's rich, tasty and enjoyable."
"drinkability isn't too good. it's too sweet to have more than three for me."
"Not bad, mostly sweet malt, but enjoyable. A decent American version."
"bottled 0n 050710..it poured a bright copper/orange color with a 1 finger creamy head that cleared out fast..smell was average and non-descript.rye, malt, citrus. and spice all so very light..taste was better some rye mixed with baked bread .a portion of hops..some sweet malt in the finish..mouth feel is light medium it got some good flavors going for it its smooth and creamy but has a kick to it also..overall i liked this brew..but i would have liked more rye in it..like reds rye from founders..still i recommend and i will buy some more singles..i liked this one"
"D- rich and bold and a pleasure to drink, I was dubious about the use of rye in beer. I've had one other rye beer I didn't care for but this is a definite repeat."
"D-This beer is very drinkable in a sessioning sense but it just was not my favorite Great Divide effort."
"Heavy side of light bodied, moderate carbonation. Clings to the mouth well. Drinks very well, wouldn't turn it down."
"Very drinkable. Nice beer"
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle (bottled on 3/4/10) into a Sam Adams perfect pint. Pours a crystal clear copper with good carbonation and a thin head. Has some bread, biscuit, and toast in the aroma. Some nice caramal malt starts things out, then turns to biscuit before finishing with a slight rye spiciness. Has a good full mouthfeel that flows nicely and finishes with good bitterness. Overall a nicely balanced brew."
"This is definitely drinkable, maybe sweet for me, but better for others."
"D - This beer had some high points and some low points...the caramel and fruit flavors were nice but that was about it...I wanted some spiciness from the rye to shine through...I wouldn't classify this as a rye beer like they do"
"D-The beer is drinkable and well balanced but is somewhat one dimensional in the flavor profile for a rye ""accented"" beer."
"20oz pour at the Brick Store Pub. I'm a big fan of rye, so we'll see how this plays out. Pours a coppery amber with a moderate head that fades to a thin ring. Smells very malty with only a touch of spicy rye at the finish. Tastes creamy and very malty with a rich sweetness and firmness and once again only a touch of spicy rye. I suppose I see the point of adding the rye to try to balance the malty sweetness, but I'm not entirely sure it works. The deeper more savory rye notes are lost under the malt, and only a bit of spiciness survives to balance. Still, its tasty enough as a Marzen, and has a nice creaminess to it with the rye spice at the end."
"D: I enjoyed this beer but it was not what I was looking for. I wish they turned the rye up a little bit more."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a dimpled mug. Pours a deep ruby red with undertones of bronze. Beer has obviously been filtered as it's quite clear. Head is about a half an inch thick and slightly tan and fizzy. No real legs or head retention. Aroma is somewhat malty and earthy, most likely due to the rye. Initial sip gives off a lot of malt character with the rye lingering in the finish. Relatively crisp and dry, surprisingly refreshing. Light mouthfeel with lingering rye, though it can be a little bit syrupy. Some caramel notes are present in the background. As you acclimate to the beer the hops come through with notes of citrus and fruit - lots of cherry. The rye makes this taste almost like it's been oak aged. Overall a pretty good beer that's good on a warm summer night."
"D- Really refreshing beer with a little zing over the standard lager because the of the rye used."
"Drinkability: fantastic marzen lager. loved it"
"Very good brew. The fishing's not great tonight, but it's twilight, the loons are calling, & soon I'll be firing up the Merc to take me to the cabin. This is the way to live!"
"Overall Opinion: Pretty good rye beer, and it's always nice to find a unique craft lager. Not something I'd want to have more than a couple bottles of in a sitting."
"D: After one sip, I immediately know that it tastes like an oktoberfest. I think this brew is fairly characteristic of its style, aside from the rye base that comes through in the aroma. It's also nice to see a brewer produce one year round."
"Brown color, maybe reddish brown with a light brown head. LIght malty aroma and a light malty flavor. Good as a Marzen, try it if you like it."
"D - Very easy drinking. Very refreshing. Well hidden abv would sneak up on you. Not filling. Flavors are a well integrated."
"Light bodied, well carbonated and a very crisp texture all add up to one VERY sessionable brew. Cheers GD, and thanks for making this one a year-round."
"I don't have a lot of experience with this style, so I can't comment on it's general quality. It is a very tasty brew. Refreshing and complex at the same time. A nice beer."
"Simple and effective. Complex and Tasty. Loving this one."
"With it's blend of festive autumn spiciness from the rye and a solidly smooth drinkibility, I thought that this was a perfect fall quaff when I had this last year. I'm glad to see that Great Divide has seen fit to release a fresh batch this spring, as I could easily drink this year round. Good stuff!"
"Awesome sessionable brew from Great Divide. Pours clear light copper/caramel with tan head. Smells quite malty, with notes of fresh bread, caramel, and a slightly floral quality. Flavor is again very malty, bread-like, slightly sweet caramel, with earthy hops lingering in the background. Body is light to medium with carbonation on the higher side. Exceptionally drinkable brew given the low ABV and restrained hops. One of my all-time favorite sessionable beers."
"D: This interesting beer is one of which I will consume more. I do not think I would have too many in one sitting, though, as the rye spice could overpower the palate."
"Beer poured a metallic red with a nice white head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose is crisp euro hops. Taste is crisp hops, hints of dark fruit and rye. Mouthfeel is crisp and lively on the palate, very refreshing. Drinkability is good, this is very easy drinking. This does not fit the traditional marzen style but is a good beer nonetheless."
"D: Flavorful and interesting. Nice malty character with and ineresting spiciness."
"Nice creamy head of close to two fingers, orange tinted off-white color, close to the froth of an orange julius, average retention, covers the surface for some time, a few streaks of lacing here and there. Deep and vibrant metallic red to coppery orange colored liquid, clear with excellent reflective brilliance, quite pretty. Pastry flakes, milk chocolate, honey coated orange citrus, more of a warm butter than toast covering, the rye waits until the penultimate moment to move forward into the spotlight. Medium-bodied, however, lounges squarely on the palate and unpacks a picnic basket of caramel, milk chocolate, molasses, honey, graham cracker, croissant and ripely sweet oranges. The carbonation is like tiny explosions, precise and prickly yet with no staying power. As a flavor the rye has a clear delivery but doesn't add much texturally, the hoppy side of the equation slacking. The sweetness never comes close to cloying and for a more or less one-sided beer it's, err, decently balanced. Drinkability highest when coldest."
"The body is carbonated well; moderate depth. The rye makes itself known in the flavor a bit, but does not overpower this beer at all. There's some nice toffee sweetness in there balancing out the rye perfectly. I like this take one the Marzen style. I like that it is out at this time of year too. Not bad at all."
"Value: Great for what you get."
"D: I would empty a few of these in my gullet but had I a choice, I might go for something else a bit less aggressive on the carbonation front."
"Drink: Very drinkable, tasty with a snack, refreshing alone."
"The rye is quite present. A very dry brew. Smooth mouthfeel, yet it is slightly astringent. Mostly malty with a short finish and a touch of hop."
"Another great beer from Great Divide. Incredibly balanced and well crafted, everything I've had from this brewery has been phenomenal and this is no exception...exceptional."
"Pours from the tap a very nice copper color with a very nice off-white head. Smells earthy, with some caramel malt and some light rye. Nice sweet malt flavors, along with toast and a hint of rye spiciness. Nicely carbonated and an easy beer to drink."
"A nice change of pace,a rye marzen lager in mid spring.Poured into a .5 liter stein a brilliant amber/bronze with a clingy one finger head that settles into a creamy mass.Lighter aromas of caramel malt,dark fruit,with toast,and iron.Lighter mouthfeel but not watery,flavors of caramel and dark fruit mainly,the rye gives off a tang in the finish.Not a bad beer,maybe expected a little more, but its decent."
"A very nice Marzen, and the addition of the rye makes it slightly different than any other one out there. Nice balance and great flavor."
"D - A tasty attractive brew. Could definitely have a few and would definitely buy again"
"Overall, quite drinkable. Nothing off or offensive. Decent beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium. Drinkability is high."
"The carbonation comes on a bit strong, and combines with the rye doesn't really make a good first impression. But, it grows on you as the carbonation settles. Eventually you get nice toasty base malts and spicy hops. Along with all that carbonation comes a medium body and partly gritty, partly smooth feel. In all, pretty good, rye adds some distinction."
"D - Really drinkable flavorful marzen. A solid representation of the style. I would definitely pick this up again anytime I wanted to have a marzen."
"Pours a copper gold with a thin white head. Good retention and very nice laceing. Aroma is of bready malts, and dark fruits. Body is medium with a good amount of carbonation. Taste is of malted rye with hints of sweet fruit. A very pleasent surprise."
"Great Divide Hoss Rye Lager was a hazy light copper in color with a half inch beige head that reduced to a collar. The aroma was on the mild side, but definitely malty. The taste was bread, malt and some pepper spice. The mouth feel was medium bodied with decent carbonation. Drinkability was good combining a moderate ABV and reasonably good taste. I'm not a big fan of märzens, Great Lakes Oktoberfest being the exception, but I enjoyed Hoss despite the fact that it has no real outstanding characteristics."
"drinkability is good - its just not a beer i will swirl and sniff between every sip"
"I really enjoyed this stuff when it came out in the fall, and was thrilled to see it return as a year rounder. Pours a deep copper color with a nice off-white head that retains OK. The aroma starts off with a big caramelized malt smell, followed by a hay like scent similar to an alt beer, then some dark fruits (cherry and fig), a rye spiciness and some mineraly hops. The taste is where this beer really shines: classic caramel maltiness upfront, followed by some doughy malt flavors, spicy rye flavors, mineraly hops and a touch of cherry. This is a really superbly balanced beer, a little sweet but with a drying finish. The mouthfeel is full and smooth but not overbearing, and drinkability is excellent. This is probably one of my top marzens, along with Ayinger's, and I'm quite glad it's a year round offering now."
"F: FInishes dry as expected, but it has more of that sweet malt taste on the finish (not sweet itself though). Lingering is a spicy earthy tannic dry rye taste. It really starts to bombard the tongue on the finish. It does have a crisp finish though, and doesn't last too long, aside from the lingering rye bitterness. Not bad, drinkable, adds a kick. Just seems like having a harsh rye added to what should be a very crisp refreshing and smooth beer such as a lager, is counter-intuitive, but to each his own."
"The beer is heavier than most marzens, not saying much but still this is noticeably thicker than water. I think the addition of rye to a marzen is a genius pairing of grains, even if it isn't in strict accordance with reinheitsgebot purity law."
"Hoss is The Boss. If the marzen/Oktoberfest style was anywhere close to being one of my favorites, the scores would be even higher than they already are. Great Divide can do almost no wrong in my eyes."
"Carbonation keeps the malts from weighing things down. Beautiful balance. A bit hoppier than a traditional marzen, but not so much to disrespect the original. One of the best American interpretations I've had. Great beer for spring or fall grilling or crisp afternoons on the patio."
"This is a great beer with just the right flavor balance, easy on the palate, and extremely smooth & refreshing."
"Well done!!"
"D: Very drinkable, the spicy rye doesn't overpower you, and everything is in balance here. It is a very pleasent experience from start to finish. A great twist on a classic style."
"The beer pours an amber/orange color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of pale and Munich malts. The addition of rye is subtle, but does add a dry spiciness to the aroma. The taste is good as well. It has all the sweet maltiness of a true Marzen, while also having a dry spiciness that does add a bit of flair to this traditional style. It goes down easy and finishes dry with some bready/peppery character. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a pretty good beer. I wouldn't buy it often, but it's definitely something I'll look for as a regular seasonal."
"This is an interesting interpretation of an Oktoberfest. I definitely like the addition of the rye that, with the rest of the malt, really adds a complex grain dimension to this beer. A nice beer, that I would be happy to drink a few of; I could see this pairing quite well with food too."
"Pours a luminous amber with meringue-like head that is appropriately thick and creamy textured. Gorgeous. Nose has a zesty light citrus and grainy aroma. On the palate it comes across like a slightly less sweet Marzen, with the rye grain giving a little hearty flavor of its own. Finish is slightly sweet."
"D: When am I supposed to drink this? It's really light, so I think warmer weather, but then the rye darkness factor makes it not a summer beer. So is it a winter beer? Nope, too light to warm my soul. So I'm left wondering with this brew, its unique, but I don't think I'd have another."
"single from Whole Foods, Fair Lakes, VA"
"Overall, a very drinkable beer. Won't go out of my way to get more, but would drink again."
"3.5 D: A little too bready for my tastes, but worth a full glass."
"Moutfeel is light and has a smooth amount of carbonation."
"D: A good beer. Different, yet still approachable. Can't say I will be making this my go-to beer anytime soon, but I enjoyed it."
"Easy drinking brew."
"this is a fantastic ""Session"" beer great flavor and very drinkable."
"One of my favorite beers, and sadly like Hop Rod Rye - It's not distributed in VT!"
"A fantastic beer that I will be revisiting. Also great with food, I am currently enjoying a Pepper smoked turkey sandwich with swiss and humus on whole wheat and could not think of a better match(except perhaps rye)."
"Drinkability: this beer is extremely easy to drink and it goes down fast. Refreshing and you can drink this all night long."
"D - I really enjoyed this lager - a nod to Marzen w/ a roggen twist. The rye and german yeast makes for a quaffable session brew"
"Very creamy feeling in the mouth for a lager and the rye spiciness comes through quite a bit more than the nose would indicate. Slightly sweet caramel malts and a bit of floral hop bittering balances things out nicely. This is a fun and unique take on the marzen style and it works pretty well. It would be nice if GD would send some of this down to Tx along with a few of the other new six-pack offerings they have brewed lately. Good beer."
"Drinkability: An average beer, a good attempt at the style, and pretty much on par with Great Divide's other ""regular"" offerings. At a reasonable 6.2%, it's fairly drinkable, and I could easily put down a pint or two of this, though there are both other rye beers and other Marzens I believe I would prefer. Nonetheless, worth trying."
"Reviewed on 11/16/2009. Bottle. Pours a clear orange with a thick white head. Aroma of sweet malt. Flavor of sweet caramel malt, some toasted malt, perhaps some spices (I don't really get any rye notes). Kinda bland but certainly drinkable. Decent for an oktoberfest."
"Overall- So smooth and delicious. Hopefully I can find 6ers of this."
"12oz bottle at Raleigh Times consumed on 12/10/09 and reviewed from notes. The beer poured a crisp orange with decent diminishing khaki head. Aroma was caramel malts, rye and mild hops. The taste was an interesting balance of rye, caramel, and sweet malts with a touch of cherry flavor. The beer is light, crisp and slightly dry with decent carbonation. This is an enjoyable lager, one I likely would have again."
"Softly carbonated up front with a medium body that has a nice balance of roasted malt sweetness, earthy bitterness and sweet dark fruit. Very clean and crisp with a slightly dry finish. Toasted caramel malt with prominent rye flavor which is balance by a slight earthy tartness. Hints of sour dark cherry add to the sweetness and balances this beer out pretty nicely. The alcohol is well masked and none of the flavors are overpowering making this beer pretty quaffable. Decent ""session"" beer if you can call it that at 6.2%."
"An interesting marzen that highlights the funky rye malts to good effect."
"Appears a pale amber orange tinted hue with a bright white head. I let this one warm a bit before cracking it and I think it's a good idea. Speckled lacing all around the edges of my chalice. Aroma has sweet honey drizzled biscuit and honey malt layers going on with spicy rye additions bringing out an earthy herbal character. Flavor is fantastic sweet with malts and rye more of that honey simple syrup flavor with a fruity apple and caramel drizzled tone. But the hops and the rye malt balance things out with a grassy, spicy herbal tea accent. Mouthfeel is a bit stickier with residual malts especially with the higher alcohol and the rye additions carbonation is pleasant and smooth the entire bottle. Definitely a medium body with the rye giving it a bit more girth than your average marzen. Drinkability is solid from the first sip to the last drops, a beer that strikes gold coming from such a known ale brewer to dabble with their twist on a great German style, I enjoy it and look forward to more next year."
"D - A good beer for cool weekends. Not something I would return to. Just not my style of beer, but not a bad beer."
"Clear copper body. Thin off white head. Sporadic rings of lace left on the glass walls as I drink. Nice malty aroma highlighted by vienna malt like toasted notes. Solid flavor. Nice maltiness. A mix of breadiness and toasted malts. Rye adds just a titch of spiciness which adds a little complexity to the flavor profile. Some dark fruits are noticeable. Very subtle dryness lingering. This isn't the thickest or richest marzen I've had, but it's very enjoyable. It's good all around."
"The nose is great, bready with spicy rye apparent, there's also some caramel sweetness and a prominent leafy hop character. Sweetness is complex, I also get some brown sugar. The palate opens with a surprisingly strong hop character, quite herbal and earthy with a little mineral-like character. Bitterness is low, and this allows the malt to shine, with a great caramel and burnt sugar character, along with the spicy rye character which especially dominates the mid-palate and towards the finish. Drying on the finish, this medium-light bodied beer has a moderate level of carbonation and a great mouthfeel, providing a little heft while remaining light. Enjoyable, I'd absolutely drink this again."
"D: Pretty one-dimensional, yet tasty and quite quaffable. A great session beer."
"Overall it was a nice ""Octoberfest"" type beer. Nice maltiness but still finished crisp enough to drink easily."
" D- This beer is soft and clean with little flavor but no off flavors."
"Drinks pretty easy, but not interesting enough to get all jacked up about. Hopefully I will get to try this a bit fresher next year"
"In a sea of oktoberfest available stateside, Hoss stands seperate from the pack with something different."
"Pours a bright orangy amber color, full frothy offwhite head with minimal retention and lacing. Smell is of bready and sweet malts, slight roasted nut charachter, lager twang. Taste is of your basic marzen lager (sweet malts) with slight hints of fruits and a faint earthyness to it (probably from the rye). Body is medium, slightly slick and oily feeling, which i did not like for the style, minmal carbonation as well. A good Octoberfest style lager, which trumps its American counterparts, but does not stand up to the clean and earthy European counterparts."
"D - Overall, a very nice American interpretation. Having tried Surlyfest last year, I'm really pleased with this trend of rye Marzens. Worth seeking out."
"Light to medium body with fairly high carbonation to keep this crisp and refreshing. Finishes dry but with a spicy and alcoholic aftertaste."
"Overall, this is an awesome session beer. It would be a great choice for warmer weather."
"d - great beer."
"orange/copper color, very slight chill haze. very nice, thick light tan head is lasting. bready, light caramel malts and some earthy hops in the nose. taste is clean, lightly sweet bready caramelly malts. some spiciness and hop bitterness bring perfect balance. finishes almost dry. nicely carbonated-frothy and lively. finishes crisp and clean with some lingering bitterness/spiciness. light/medium in body. drinkable, enough going on to stay interesting."
"Drinkability is very good. A bit high in the abv department for a Marzen, but a very tasty beer. I could drink a lot of this."
"D- Overall, I was excited to see another new rye beer on the market. This one isnt too bad. Worth a shot."
"D- Easy to drink, nice and light with a little different taste than a traditional marzen. I could have another of these, but I would prefer to change beers if I could."
"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a reddish gold with a finger of white head. Bready malt aroma with a little noble hops. Medium bodied with a solid malt base. Bit of spice from the rye. Sweet malt on the start, crisp hop bite in the finish. Easy drinking, nothing earth shattering."
"This one is very easy to quaff, and this is a unique take on the oktoberfest style. This is a good lager, but it is simply too sweet for me to drink a couple in one session"
"Pours an amazingly clear copper color with a tight and clingy egg-shell colored head. Some nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is quite faint, not picking up much. Perhaps some caramel malt with a light sourness. The taste is of a caramel malt backbone with no buttery flavor (woohoo), a light rye sour/spice which plays well with the malt, light metal notes in the end. American marzen style, do not see much german characteristics in this one. The feel is light to moderate, with an airy carbonation, finishes well balanced and clean. Dang, this is a pretty good marzen. The caramel malt with the touch of rye work really well. The beer drinks extraordinarily well and goes down easy. A must try if you like the style."
"D: A good not great brew and probably my lowest rated from GD. You have to really love rye to like this beer a lot. The value of this brew is far below other marzens, but it's worth a try."
"D - This is a unique twist on the marzen/oktoberfest style. Quite good and quite drinkable."
"Pours a clear, dull copper colored brew with good bubbling and a rocky to start, but quick receding off-white head. The The aroma makes me think of spicy caramel thanks to the rye and some mild hopping. The taste has all the trappings of a pretty good oktoberfest, but the rye seems to stick out a bit too much formy taste. I taste some good toasted white bread with some mild American hops. Bt the rye had a spicyness that doesn't jibe well with me. ot a bad beer by any means, and still a good session brew to boot. But style wise, I think this oneis a little off to get a great rating."
"Mouthfeel is light and crisp with just a touch of full bodied feel upfront, falling away to all carbonation and becoming increasingly thin."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a crisp bite of carbonation."
"The aroma was grainy and gave off a slight clove and banana. Taking a sip you are hit with a slight rye flavor that is spicy. Then you are hit with the cherry in the background. In the mouth it has medium body and a good crisp finish. Overall this isn't my favorite style but this one is a solid effort."
"D: Very drinkable, keeps me wanting more. Alcohol is hidden well."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, nice representation of style, this is a very good O-fest to session with for the duration of the evening."
"D: I will get this again. Tasty, it really is a good compliment for the fall weather. Another tasty from GDBC"
"For an unusual style of Oktoberfest lager this beer is very tasty and consequently very drinkable. It wants to dissapear from my glass at a rate that doens't allow any proper warming. Warming however brings out and melds the flavours in an enticing way."
"Overall a nice beer, but sort of akward for the style. Style parameters should be larger, so i dont care so much, im just saying that if your expecting a german style marzen, this one is a little different. The rye adds something to the beer for sure, making it interesting, but as a whole, im not terribly enthralled by it. An Ok beer."
"Quite a nice little O-fest that drinks down easy while keeping just enough body and flavor to maintain a crafty edge of enjoyment."
"Overall, I was very impressed with this beer as it turned out to pack a lot of flavor. I could easily drink a few of these in a sitting. For the style, this one has to be a favorite!"
"I wish Great Divide would have made this more flavorful. It's not bad but I won't buy it again."
"Very drinkable and enjoyable. Good beer."
"A rye Oktoberfest? Why not?"
"Drinkability: A satisfying beer to be enjoying on an early October evening. The welcome addition of rye adds a nice bit of pep to this Märzen-style lager. ""Want some rye?? 'COURSE ya do!"" --Return to Zork."
"Solid."
"D Very good and the point of this beer. It is made, in my opinion, to be ultimately very drinkable. This particular Oktoberfest, as suggested, just is not very inspirational to me. 4.5"
"12oz. Pours a deep copper with a nice fluffy off-white head. Good head retention and sticky lacing - very nice appeal. Sweet aromas of malty caramel are noticeable with a slight floral hop scent as well. Spicy is right up front on the palate with a hefty dose of bready malt, very reminiscent of fresh baked rye bread. Finishes spicy and somewhat bitter along with being fairly dry. Overall, nice change of pace with the added spiciness from the rye. Not a bad example of the style."
"overall a nice oktoberfest with a twist."
"Bottle at the Great Divide tap room. This was a clear amber beer with a soapy head. The smell was good and sweet almost, intriguing. The beer was a nice lager with a bit of sweetness and a hint of the rye. For some reason I was not expecting to like this beer but I did, I may need to pick up a sixer."
"Overall a great interpretation of the style that is different from the rest. The spicy rye adds another element to this beer and for me makes it a standout in it's class. Another very good beer from Great Divide. Well done."
"D- A good American take on the style. Maybe a bit sweet for my tastes, but something nice on a fall night."
"A really nice beer that should have been an obvious combination before now."
"Drinkability: Wow. This is a very good marzen and is also in my top four of the style. I love how I can taste the advertised rye. I really like the way the bitterness and the maltiness come together. You can taste them separate, but they also blend. One of my favorites from a good brewery, this is kind of the opposite end of the spectrum from Brooklyn's version. Both excellent--a marzen that leaves me wanting more."
"D- very drinkable brew. i only picked up a single but if I had a six pack it certainly wouldn't sit in the fridge long before magically disappearing"
"D - A very interesting and enjoyable brew... The cherry really adds to the character of this fine brew... The rye is understated and takes a backseat but still adds to the overall depth and complexity... My biggest complaint is that it seems to stray pretty fair from the style guidelines of a traditional Marzen... None the less I could enjoy this year round and may invest in a case so that I'm able to do so... The most artistic lager to come down the pike in a really long time..."
"Drinkability- I could go through a 6 pack of this in a day pretty easily."
" Nice Job Great Divide"
"D - Well balanced and great malt flavors. Nice offering from GD. Lt to med mf and a good Oktoberfest."
"Overall, decent but pretty subdued. The first time I had this, I remember much more of a rye presence."
"medium bodied with pretty good drinkability.one of the better marzen lagers i've had."
"Overall this had everything in place to be really good, just not in the right amounts. I'd hoped for more spiciness and caramel/bready malt flavors but even as it is it's worth a shot if you like the style."
"It clear amber with some red hues and nice streams of carbonation and a half a finger of off-white head that remains atop the glass as its drank. The aroma is caramel malty with spicy notes and earthy hops. Flavor is malt forward with biscuit, caramel and rye. Has some earthy hops and some light unripe cherry flavor that became more present as it warmed up (maybe due to the rye?) Its medium bodied and slightly crisp and finishes with a easy dryness. Overall it was mostly bready malty goodness with some interesting spicy notes and found it to be very enjoyable all-around."
"Drinkability: Pretty high - aside from the nose, this beer is pretty solid with a nice toasty flavor. It's listed as an Oktoberfest but it doesn't really strike me as being quite as malty and sweet as that style. I would definitely sit through a couple of these and enjoy the accompanying buzz."
"Overall, very drinkable and refreshing, and would be a good pairing with roasted, or BBQ'd chicken"
"Smells like honey and light floral hops. A prickly rye spice bolsters toasted october-malts for a more aggressive flavor than betrayed by the aroma. Good stuff."
"Drinkability: Pretty darn high. I've had better rye beers, but this isn't a style you can just get tons of year-round. I'll be enjoying much more of the Hoss throughout this season. Light, flavorful and highly drinkable."
"Cheers!"
"Clear, light copper body, creamy white head. The aroma is caramel, malt sweetness, and noble hops. On the palate the rye pairs nicely with the caramel malt to create a deep, satisfying malt flavor. Spicy, grassy noble hops provide bitterness to the finish. Hoss is a the kind of style reinterpretation that GD is so good at. This may be Great Divide's first lager, but I truly hope they try more of them. They have proven themselves with Extreme beers and Belgian styles, now its time for some GD session beer."
"I am not normally a fan of Marzen's they are usually too sweet but this one tastes a little cleaner / more balanced to me. It is still a malt over hop taste, which is in line w/ the style, but it is low key enough that I could session this beer. Maybe this has something to do w/ the Rye but like others have said the rye flavor is very subdued and difficult to detect. This is a flavorful beer but it is subtle and a warming temp is needed to bring out these flavors, if you drink this too cold it could seem bland. The alcohol is well integrated. All in all I think this is a winner and will definitely be part of my late summer early fall rotation!"
"This is basically a big octoberfest beer which is no bad thing."
"Medium bodied lager with just enough carbonation to make it a very smooth drinker. My favorite American Marzen. I will be without a a doubt be picking up a few of these."
"This is pretty drinkable I must say, I will definitely seek out a qualified sixer of this"
"Overall impression: A nice late summer offering - glad to see Great Divide expanding their offerings with some new and interesting beers."
"D: Hoss is a well balanced beer that I thoroughly enjoyed. Next time I'm in the tap room, I'll order it again."
"EDIT: Honestly, I don't think time has been kind to this one. while I used to really get a kick out of it, lately it's been a bit boring for me. Not bad...but just not great."
"Pours a pale golden brown with a thin beige head. Nose has mellow grains, faint grassy hops and a subtle rye aroma. Taste is also on the lighter side for a Marzen. Drinks well, but could use a bit more depth. I didn't find much of a rye presence. Light body is well carbonated."
