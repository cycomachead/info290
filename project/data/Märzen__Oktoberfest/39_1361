Aromas are faint but worth the effort to pull out.  Taste is malt forward with some of that honey and a floral presence up front.  Sweetness from the malt barely kept in check by the hops floral and spicy in there own right.  Finish brings sweet malty notes and some of that raisin and fig from the nose.  Light yet chewy body costs the palet on the finish.  Overall, this is the best oktoberfest beer I've had yet.

4.3,7.8,,,,,,"Clear light amber pour with a hint of garnet.  Massive head with excellent lacing and retention.  The nose is sweet biscuit malt with a little caramel over a faint, almost citric, spiciness.  Nice light medium body with a slick smooth texture that approaches creamy.  Slightly above normal carbonation with a good bit of effervescence on the finish.  The flavor profile is quite nice, a bit complex, and very well balanced.  The sweet malt flavors are there, but not to the extent that they are overpowering.  It begins with sweet biscuit, flows to a caramel note and then the effervescence cleans the palate and allows the complexity to escape.  The middle presents a multitude of subtle flavors - citric, dark fruit, light bitterness and spicy hops.  The smooth finish leaves you with a blend of the aforementioned flavors.","tillmac62","Sep 11, 2014"

4.5,12.8,,,,,,"Pours a pretty golden-amber in color with a good 3-finger foamy head that settles down to a good 2mm layer on top of the brew and more on the sides. A decent amount of lacing was seen with each sip that sticks to the side of the glass. Perfect carbonation. The aroma is mostly of sweet caramel malts for the most part. The taste even has more going on with the sweet caramel malt with some bread (yeast) with very mild hop finish with a hint of spice in the mix as well. VERY easy to drink and smooth. Medium bodied. One of the best 'Marzen / Oktoberfest' brews I have tasted as I am usually not a huge fan of this brew style. A exception here for sure! PROSIT!","BeerWithMike","Aug 25, 2014"

A Classic Marzen aroma, of sweet caramel malt. The taste, light bready, toasted malt with a nice hop finish. All in all, a nice full body, and the right balance of sweet and bitterness. Very enjoyable. A true Oktoberfest, that is best served in a stein, under a beer garden tent, with your friends. Prost!","Myboymi","Aug 24, 2014"

3.93,-1.5,3.75,3.75,4,4,4,"Had a 1 pint tall bottle that I purchased perhaps a month ago, I kept it ice cold and ready for when an amber malt craving struck. Poured a color reminiscent of dark honey, like a yellow to orange sunset with a creamy head that broke quite quickly. Aroma was marvelously fruity and spicy, with ample aromatic malt character. Taste was a layered blend of caramel and cherry fruit, floral vanilla, a darker malt note like faint molasses, and herbal hops that recall black tea. Semi-chewy body but not that much residual sweetness, just enough to balance some spice that replaces the sweet malts and fruit for the finish. The whole flavor palette integrates as you drink and yet the individual components become more salient as well. I love beers that actually reveal more of themselves as you proceed. A prime example of how complex and aromatic a well-crafted lager can be. Malt-forward but with enough fruit and spice from yeast and hops to provide balance and nuance. I am a bit of a Luddite when it comes to beer, pro-Reinheitsgebot when it comes to non-Belgian offerings and this sort of brew gives me strength.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 28, 2013"

The lace on the side of the glass extends throughout the drink itself. A little lighter orange amber color than other Oktoberfest but seems to have a little more pronounced mouth feel. Like all other Oktoberfest's you really start to enjoy the depth and quality of the malt as it approaches 50°.

This beer has ok drinkability, it's fairly smooth, but the flavors didn't do a good job at holding my attention and one would be enough for me, this isn't the kind of beer that I would drink multiples of since I think the yeast and sweetness would really start to wear on me. What I like the most about this beer is the appearance, it looked good and pretty true to style. What I liked least about this beer was the yeast and the sweetness, they seemed to dominate this beer and over power the classic Marzen flavors that are suppose to shine through. I wouldn't buy this beer again, there's many other German Marzens that I prefer more, All in all I thought this was a nice beer, but it didn't impress me since it wasn't what I was looking for in a traditional German Marzen, it just wasn't what I was expecting from the style. It's not a bad beer, but it's not a great example of the style. So far it's my least favorite German made Marzen.","StoutHunter","Aug 13, 2013"

4.85,21.6,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Poured from a bottle into a Sam Adams glass. Nice head with some lacing. Color is golden amber. The smell is a mix of the malty grains and floral hops. But the real reason we drink is the taste. This is the bench mark of all Oktoberfest beers. Fresh clean taste of the roasted malts leaving it slightly sweet. There is a light hop finish. This is a very drinkable beer, but hard to have just one. Great with a soft pretzel or bratwurst with kraut.","cruzbay","Oct 28, 2012"

Where Paulaners keeps their price-point down, and the taste is certainly one of my favorites, Ayinger seems to capture the essence of Oktoberfest. It's my favorite but I'm not sure I can afford more than two or three 500ml bottles a season.","jibjib513","Oct 25, 2012"

The appearance was darker brown but clear with a beautiful head, Smell was of sweet roasted malts and bread, very pleasant. Taste was sweet and roasted not much hops but very very smooth. Mouthfeel is medium to light, you can drink several to many at a time if you are in the mood (and at an octoberfest event you should be in the mood). Fresh on tap was memorable and look forward to it every fall.","adjunctjonez","Apr 02, 2012"

3.72,-6.8,3,3.5,4,3,4,"The Okatoberfest Märzen, with its beautiful brown color and malt aroma, is one of my favorite German style beers. There is little head and little head retention, but the head is certainly thicker than that of a pilsner or lager. There is perhaps a hint of a hops aroma. The taste is more malt sweetness than it is hops. The flavor is quite balanced with a leaning toward sweet. The mouth feel consists of little alcohol heat and little carbonation. The finish is quite smooth due to the balance between the malt sweetness and hop bitterness.","davidthesnoozy","Jan 29, 2012"

Some spotty lacing on the glass as well. Aromas of big bready malts, caramel, herbal spiciness, toasted malt, and light apricot fruitiness. Classic Oktoberfest aromas, very nice stuff. Taste of caramel, toffee, biscuit, herbal spiciness, toasted malt, and light fruitiness. No bitterness present; with lingering notes of caramel, toasted malt, biscuit, and herbal spices on the finish for a bit. Great flavor balance and maltiness; with absolutely no cloying sweetness. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with hardly any noticed at all. Extremely drinkable and smooth as expected for the style.

The flavor was of sweet matl, wheat, grain, biscuit, subtle fruit, floral, and spices. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. My impression of this one was the aroma was lacking, but the flavor had potential. There were a lot of flavors I had never picked up on before going on in this one which was a nice change-up from the normal brews from this style.

The head initially stacks up fast while you pour, but it settles into a two inch layer with great endurance. The beer's nose is heavy with toasted grains and rich malt sweetness, and some light spicing throughout. Flavors have a rich, honey and sugary sweet malt profile, with light toasted cereal flavors in the background. The flavors are very light and crisp, with a smooth and round body. Great cling slong the glass while you drink. The aftertaste is light, but a slight sweetness does linger behind. This is a very clean brew. The finish is quick and slick. Very easy to drink, and very tasty while avoiding the overpowering and cloying sweetness that some Marzens carry. Impressive.","GarthDanielson","Oct 08, 2011"

The flavor is is full of toffee, caramel and biscuit malts. There are some nice floral hop notes in the flavor as well which really add to the flavor profile. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very easy to drink and one of the best German-brewed märzens out there.","Mora2000","Oct 05, 2011"

Not like green apples, just regular, sweet apple juice. The taste was somewhat sweet as well, but also biscuity. It had very much a taste of both bread and still some of that apple juice that dominated the smell. It sounds like a terrible combination. But actually, it was fairly appealing to me. Biscuity and sweet. Delicious.","ElCommodoro","Oct 02, 2011"

This is probably the only one that I've had so far that I will drink again. When you drink a brew like this one, you understand why there is an entire tradition that surrounds the Marzen style. I could drink this one for days. If you rate to style, rating should be higher.

The aromas are more subdued than those of comparable quality oktoberfests, such as Spaten, but every bit as complex and seductive. I smell a lot of toastiness and earthiness at first, and then pick up delicious notes of spicy apple sauce and sliced peaches. The taste is very toasty and bready up front, with lots of earthiness and pie crust on the mid-palate, with hints of autumn spices and fruits adding yet another layer on the finish.

3.53,-11.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Damn, this bottle has to have the loveliest cap of all time! Regardless, it pours a clear copper topped by a finger of off-tan foam. The nose comprises buttery caramel, light grass, light rye bread, cabbage, light mandarin orange, and a decent amount of straight, bready yeast. The taste brings in more of the same, though the caramel is slightly sweeter, the rye bread is toastier, and some black pepper and cinnamon find their ways in as well. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally smooth feel. Overall, a mostly solid O-Fest, but one that doesn't really stand out from the crowd in any appreciable manner. It rises above the light cabbage character, but it doesn't soar. Still not bad, though, especially for the price...","TMoney2591","Sep 18, 2011"

I will admit that i am a bit new to the style, but having came from a love of IPA's, maybe that has skewed my pallet.

There is a very mild grainy bitterness on the tongue after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel.

There’s no hop profile to speak of, consistent with the style, but the hops there provide a nice spice and balance to the malty flavor of the beer. It’s refreshing, in a way, starting out crisp with a some caramel on a subdued, sweet finish that I think of as characteristically marzen. The flavors hold up as it warms. Really, a terrific beer.

The taste was great, it felt like a true Octoberfest and I'd gladly have this over American versions. It was malty and had a unique biscuit flavor. A little sweet, but the finish was very smooth...very easy drinking beer. I'm hoping to grab a few for the fridge before they vanish for the season.

Cleanly malty with the typical bread crust, biscuit, and barley husk character of Munich-type malts. Light on the caramel character, which in my mind is the better way to brew this style. Hops run about even with the malt lending plenty of spiciness to balance. It manages to capture the dry yet malty palate that separates the best of the style.

3.99,0,3.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Toward the lighter end of the style's color spectrum - straddling amber-copper, this pours with a head at the start, but it had a previous engagement apparently, disappearing quick. Straight-forward, sweet malt aroma, in-line style-wise, clean with some surprising noble hop presence - real distant - a bit floral and oxidized. As it warms up, alcohol becomes more apparent. The flavor boasts some roasted nut and caramel aspects - strange for the style, so I've read. The malt profile is clean and has a light-moderate toasted angle to it, however, it finishes with a thin vegetable essence. A lively-enough level of carbonation washes much of that away in the end. Not too shabby, this Ayinger - I'd certainly try drinking it with some German cuisine when I can. Some of those perceived off-flavors, though, while not ruining this, will surely steer me toward other examples of the style 4 out of 5 times.","Bouleboubier","Nov 25, 2010"

The next thing I notice is the aroma, which I can smell from where I'm sitting - my glass is about an arm's length away. Next we have the head, which is rocky, with inconsistent large and small bubbles. As it fades, the head retention is strange. It looks like fat suspended in broth - lets hope it doesn't taste like that. Aroma reminds me a little bit of a farm, kind of like damp straw. Damp leaves maybe. Color is amber moving to gold, a little bit darker than a pumpkin. Taste is light, with a slightly salt water mineral finish. Mouthfeel isn't sticky, more along the lines of creamy. Lager yeast is the name of the game here, as it dominates everything, from the nose of the beer into the first taste. I expected this to have more malt characteristics, honestly, and they are there, to be sure, though not as sweet as I would like. Instead hops are the focus, with some grassy dandelion hops lending a small amount of bitterness to the whole thing. I find this beer strangely drinkable. It's not like anything I've had before - and that's always surprising. Distinctive.","eclaycamp","Oct 23, 2010"

Lighter-bodied with plenty of fizzy carbonation to keep it swirling actively from start to finish. Its inherent sweetness helps it gain some traction, Honey, sweet butter, maple syrup, orange peel, root beer and chocolate bits pretty up things first. Challah bread, croissant flakes and buttermilk up next. Keeps that golden raisin, date aspect but blends in fresher apple, pear, apricot flavors too. As with the nose, it is not like there's no hops at all, they just seem to fill in cracks rather than stand center stage.

Slightly biscuity and with a slight bitter finish. The taste is leaving me somewhat underwhelmed.

Bready malts follow with a clove or allspice undertone.also has a touch of that German lager yeasty aroma. The flavor is clean and crisp with focused bready malty flavors. There is also a semi spicy flavor that flows nicely. The mouthfeel and drinkability are spot on with classic oktoberfests.

This beer has perfect clarity to it with an off white frothy head with many different sized bubbles. The head dissipates fairly quickly, and I thought there was some lacing but most of it just kind of crawls very slowly to the bottom of the glass. The smell is good, not very strong. Smell of roasted, or more like toasted malts. It has a kind of clean smell if that makes sense. The taste is good. The taste is mostly comprised of caramelized roasted malts. It certainly one of the sweetest tasting Oktoberfest style beers I've ever had. Almost like a toasted sweet breaddy taste or grain. The beer really comes out with a clean crisp taste to it. The mouthfeel was pretty good, left a little bit of a dry feeling, but very light bodied. It's an incredibly drinkable beer. I think this would be more of an early fall or even late summer beer.

3.97,-0.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"As good a Märzen as I've ever tried. I'm trying this against Spaten's version, and the Ayinger is the clear winner. The beer pours a relatively light amber-golden color with a smallish white head and pretty good retention. The beer smells of peaches, apples and concord grapes. It's very pleasant, even if that description makes it sound oversweet. It's a light but rich malty character that transmits to the flavor quite well. The beer is has a delicate and complex malt character that has fruit and caramel notes. The Germans really know how to tease out delicate malt flavors. The finish is mildly bitter and cuts out much of the lingering sweetness. It's a very drinkable beer, and I'd be quite happy spending a day drinking this beer out of enormous steins.","popery","Oct 03, 2009"

The aroma is sweet and doughy; touch of caramel to go with the munich malt. Some light grassy hops to round out the flavor. The taste is quite neutral, the caramel seems to offset the doughy malt characteristics, leaving a somewhat bland yet enjoyable flavor. Any hop presence is minimal. Nice moderate body with tingly carbonation, sweet overall but balanced. A nice marzen style German Oktoberfest. The caramel flavors play nicely with the malt.

A little different than the styles I have normally had, but some nice stuff here. Medium body with a fine-medium carbonation that is quite likeable, goes down real easy.

This one is a classic. Deep amber in color, the off-white head lasts a few bubbly minutes before fading and leaving a somewhat sticky ring around the glass. Caramel, graham crackers and toast are all over the aroma, with hints of apples. The body is very smooth, broken up by a constant churn of teeny-weeny bubbles that fizz from the bottom of the glass in huge columns. It's like drinking a glass of staccato. The taste has more caramel and crackers with a hint of carrots (surprise!), but mostly this just tastes *good*. Ayinger can't do wrong.","gfreed","Sep 15, 2009"

The flavor starts out with a warm, creamy dose of carame andl bread goodness, which dries out with a crisp finish. a slight memory of the malt lingers on. This beer is delicious, and perhaps a tad on the less malty side than some of it's german counterparts (excluding the largest -selling ones, e.g. Warsteiner, which are less malty).

The only downfall is the lack of carbonation, and the finish doesn't dry as much as it did on previous batches... and this is as fresh as I've had it before so I think I need to let it condition a bit more in the bottle and maybe that will solve all the issues, or they just released it a bit too early this year.","jlindros","Jul 19, 2009"

Pleasing color, though - a clear cider gold. Smells sweet - bread, apple, and plum. Taste is less pronounced than Paulaner, but very similar - sweet, fruitlike malt tempered by a dash of noble hops. Nothing unpleasant, but flavors lack the clarity of the Pauly Okto. Mouthfeel is this beer's strongpoint: not thick, not thin, just right - Goldilocks would approve.

Wet, mid-bodied mouthfeel and mild malt sweetness makes it an extremely drinkable session brew. Starts with delicately spicy hops but fades into a subtle grainy Munich/Crystal malt sweetness. Hops are used very delicately, adding to the initial complexity but lending to an extremely drinkable brew without risking taste-bud fatigue. Mild to moderate pleasant well-balanced bitterness.

A nice slow fade left behind more then an adequate layer of lace across the top and some very nice side glass lace when it was done. Smell was very nice, quite light and refreshing with a good amount of grain backing and a nice light earthy sort of hop tone. Definitely some spices mixed in as there was just that little extra kick to it. The flavor was pretty much on point with the aroma. A tight mix of grain and earthy flavors mixed in with a good amount of spice, maybe cinnamon or nutmeg, something fairly nice and had a good overall fall feel to it. Very nice light body with a huge amount of carbonation made it go down super smooth and kept it from feeling too filling. Overall this was definitely a quality selection and I am glad I picked it up. Superb drinkability and just a great overall profile. I really enjoyed this and will have to pick up some more if I can. One of my favorites of the season.","mikesgroove","Oct 19, 2007"

The exception to the rule is their mighty ""Celebrator"" which I find to be one of the finest beers ever made, but that is a different entry. which leads me to their Oktober Fest-Marzen. There is nothing special here. It is a less than interesting octoberfest. Yet, it is fairly refreshing and only slightly sweet with mild bitterness. Carbonation is low with virtually no head and has an almost oily finish to the mouth. For that reason alone it is very drinkable, but also lacks any zing. However, it does have a decent fruity malty aroma and appropriate deep golden color for the style. Once again they did what was expected to make this beer properly and that is about it.

The hops left just enough fruity bitterness in the aftertaste to encourage me to lift the glass again and again. I was glad it came in a .5L bottle. It disappeared very quickly.

The aroma is just as good with a big caramel malt and toasted bread character followed by an earthy, grassy and floral noble hops character, very authentic and it almost jumps out of the glass. The flavor is more subdued than the nose would let on, with notes of caramel, toasted bread, minerals, grassy and floral hops and a slightly musty hay character. Mouthfeel is rich and full but not overwhelming and drinkability is pretty good. An excellent marzen; authentic, balanced and delicious this is a great example of the style.","silver0rlead","Oct 28, 2005"

Mouthfeel is lively with plenty of carbonation, but not over board. Almost ale-like in the finish.

Tastes watery malty sweet with noticable tettnanger hop flavor and mild hop bitter. Carb is gentle and mixes well with the sugar sweet. This is a really nice tasting beer. Honey, then burnt (from the tett hops) hang around. Munich malt flavor is very minimal. As the beer warms the toasty and a phenolic come out...not quite cherry sour. The taste hangs like dried twigs.

Begins initially sweet, toasted malt dusting the palate followed by dry wheat notes and a touch of hops in the finish.

Dormant August grasses, fritters and honey sensations linger on the finish. This is a foursquare, progressive-styled Maerzen : tightly integrated, clean and clear. I'd like to see it age about 6 months to a year however. It is a waste of lager art to drink these too young, as they taste like malty, hoppy extremes of their cognate, light lagers.

This year's release from the folks at Ayinger has some hops. I'm venturing to guess there's some Hallertauer Hersbrucker in there. The hops meld quite nicely with the astringent huskiness of the malt to produce an Oktoberfest that is thirst-quenching and delicious. Very malty, however, not overly malty sweet, there's a residual flowery esteriness. Proof positive that there's hops. It's exquisitely balanced and wickedly drinkable. Each sip warrants another. Objectively, this year's batch has to be one of the finer Oktoberfests I've ever tried.

It's medium bodied with a very fine, moderate carbonation that gives it a light caress on the tognue before warming to become more creamy and smooth. The flavor offers a somewhat caramelized, bready maltiness and a mild fruitiness. Hop flavors take a backseat, and it's well-balanced to emphasis its maltiness with a restrained bitterness that's just enough to keep the beer from becoming sweet. It finishes semi-dry with a short flash of alcohol and some delicate, spicy hops that leave it crisp and refreshing. Quite enjoyable.

Finish has some subtle malty mixes of sweet and toast things meshing over some light earthyness and crisp wood. Feel is a close to medium body with some lightness coming in through the midway point and into the finish which ends lightly creamy and crispened.

Loads of stick throughout. But, in the mouth the beer fights to be refreshing while at the same time trying to be a more serious brew. Perhaps this is intended as it is a fall brew and Fall itself is fighting in the same way? The flavors are very much caramel malt with just a wee bit of hopping that adds some twang to the finish. This is a decent brew yet maybe a tad out of balance. I also find a slightly annoying hairspray and beeswax flavor that keeps chiming in as I sample.

A bit milder in aroma versus Paulaner or Spatens Octoberfests overall.  Very smooth mouthfeel w/ an ample body.  Malt sweetness and a light toastiness dominate, but a clean hop bitterness and Hallertauer flavor nudge their way into the flavor profile.  Finishes w/ a caramel malt sweetness and a very mild hop bitterness.  Although an enjoyable Marzen, it's not quite as rich or complex as other widely available imports.  That being said, I'll take it over most microbrewed versions.","marc77","Apr 10, 2002"

3.54,-11.3,2,3,4,4,3.5,"Notes: Oktoberfest in the raw, seems a little rushed from years before. Flavours are not well blended and out of whack with a need to mellow out some more. Perhaps the yeast strain is getting a little stir crazy also? Enough of the babble, this is a decent brew and might beer hard to get used to. Some may like it some may not.","Jason","Sep 15, 2001"
