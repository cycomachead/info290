3.9,7.7,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce can into dimpled mug, best before 1/3/2015. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep orange/copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavor with no overly estery notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and moderately creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice oktoberfest style. All around good robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/bready malt and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 05, 2015"

The aroma is of sweet caramel malts for the most part. More going on with the taste with some toffee, yeast with a hint of nuts. Perfect carbonation and medium bodied. Lots of good flavor and goes down pretty easy. Just a very slight hoppy aftertaste that doesn't last for a few seconds. Overall, a good Oktoberfest brew.","BeerWithMike","Sep 04, 2014"

3.67,1.4,4.25,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Nice to see Summit back in Ohio, this is an Oktoberfest, poured into a 1/2 liter krug, there's a perfectly filtered copper body with a bright light beige head that fills the more than a 1/3rd of the glass. Fine banded lacing with each sip as it slowly dwindles down. Aroma has a nice pleasant cereal grain complexity built into it light herbal hops, almost cider like notes with caramelized sugars evident. Flavor is a bready full on sweetness with malts working overtime, herbal highlights bring a bit of balance but this beer has more than enough residual malts to become borderline cloying, most Oktoberfest beers I enjoy have big malt but manage to still finish crisp and refreshing, the finish here seems a bit unrefined compared to good American versions or the German standbys. Mouthfeel is medium bodied carbonation tickles the back of the throat putting just a bit too much of that element out there, overall I'm glad to have another version to try from Summit still very enjoyable.","WVbeergeek","Oct 18, 2013"

What I liked least about this beer was the the bland aroma and the prickly carbonation, if those things were fixed it would be right around above average. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's not hard to find a much better Marzen, I don't really recommend it.

While it's got the maltiness of an Oktoberfest down to a T, it's lacking a crisp hop profile that balances and rounds out the beer, the one aspect which makes the otherwise fuller-bodied beer drinkable in mass quantities. That's certainly not to say that this beer, standing alone, isn't good. In fact, it would be a wonderful transition beer during the cooler fall nights.","BeerFMAndy","Aug 04, 2012"

It's surprising to see the ABV above 7%, although there's evidence of it when there's some time between swallows. Close enough to the traditional representatives of the style to qualify, but definitely a crisper, malt-booze take on it. I see future enjoyment of this around a late-nite October bonfire with friends and cigars. Probably won't seek it out, but will buy a sixer when I see it just to have for the right time.","BuckeyeSlim","Mar 19, 2012"

Pretty tasty though, toasted malts and a bit bready, nice hops in grassy tones, good bitterness, sweet.

There is a very slight bitterness, but not enough to discredit much. I found the taste to linger on the tongue for some time. It has a good body that is thick and has light to average carbonation.

The smell was malty and mildly spicy, but marred by a slight vegetable odor. The taste was very authentic with a toasty, malty, crisp taste , that made this easy to drink. There was a little more hop flavor present than typical, and they served like a nice counterpoint to the malt. The body was thick enough to provide a sustained sweetness. Not much aftertaste to speak of. Although this is made in one of the styles I don't go out of my way to sample very often, I enjoyed it pretty well.","rajendra82","Oct 26, 2008"

The taste is much sweeter than the aroma suggests with a massive caramel malt sweetness that dominates throughout. There is a bit of toasted bread character, but less than the aroma. The mouthfeel is fairly full-bodied for the style with very little carbonation - slick and a bit sticky.

The flavor is very malty, spicy and sweet initially, followed by a solid balance of hop bitterness, and finally the toasted grain spicyness reappears at the swallow. The carbonation is moderate and the beer has a medium body, giving a good drinkability. Overall this is a very good Oktoberfest. The malt aroma and flavor are both very prevalent and well done. I enjoy the toasted spicy flavor from what seems to be a large portion of toasted grains, like Vienna or Munich.

3.45,-4.7,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"That initial taste of metal drops this score a notch, even though it did not linger. Summit Oktoberfest is worth trying, but it isn't something I'd make a special trip to purchase.","frazbri","Aug 26, 2005"
3.58,-1.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"overall- very similar to a bock with the big malt flavor. I would taste a little more spicey/hop presence to balance it out. the 7.7% is very well hidden and overall i think its a pretty good beer. nothing spectacular, but better then average.","Gritsak","Jul 01, 2005"
4.35,20.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Crystal clear pumpkin orange color, with very minimum head on the pour. Smell is vaguely grassy, definitely sweet and crisp, also has some noticable alcohol in the nose. Taste is very crisp and full, sweet malts, with a grassy, alcohol laced background really make this a full and unique tribute to the style. Nice mouthfeel, to boot. A good start to the Oktoberfest season.","TastyTaste","Dec 10, 2004"
4.01,10.8,4,3,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Beautiful deep amber to copper color. Tawny head with strong lace. Mild aroma with toffee and malt notes. Balanced taste with just the right hoppiness and strong malt flavors. Aftertaste of roasted malt, chocolate, and just a bit of pineapple. Feels great on the tongue with a lively carbonation. I could drink a liter stein of this lager!","joedon","Dec 08, 2004"
4,10.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours nice with a fairly creamy head and a nutty, balanced aroma. Smooth mouthfeel and crisp finish made me grab another! Not in the same class as German standards like Spaten or Hacker-Pschorr, but a solid effort from Summit.","BarrelBrother","Nov 18, 2004"

3.32,-8.3,3,3.5,3,3,4,"This is a passable Oktoberfest from Summit. Bright copper-orange color with a miniscule light tan head. Thin lacing as well. Sweet caramel aroma. Light-bodied with a sweet character, containing malt, caramel and some fruit flavors. Kind of thin on all fronts though. The finish is the only place I could detect any hops. All in all this beer doesnt strive for much in the category but I couldnt find too much to complain about.","Dogbrick","Oct 06, 2004"
4.13,14.1,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Im think'n alittle Wow factor here! My first of the Summit line. The beer poured a good-looking clear copper/bronze color with a nice off-white, cream froth head that maintained well. Carbonation was medium while ring lace was left on the glass, very nice. The aroma is caramel sweet with notes of malted biscuit. The taste starts out sweet with caramel, brown sugar and ends with a spicy hop and alcohol favor. The alcohol is a nice touch as it warms you as the coolness of fall sets in. This is a well balanced, complex for an october, while not being to heavy on body brew. Perhaps one of the best Octobers ive had to date. Drinkability I kicked up for its smoothness at 7.7 abv. While easy to drink, careful, that Wow packs a punch! Good stuff!","chilidog","Oct 04, 2004"
4.02,11,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"This is a medium copper color, makes a light head, not too much lacing to speak of. Smell of caramel & has the likeness of a fresh baked oatmeal cookie. Flavor is rich and sweet, more of that nutmeg, cinnamon, pumpkin goodness that is fresh out of the oven this time of year. Mouthfeel is very smooth, a bit sticky and syrupy on the finish. I could definitely drink more than one, but sadly... I only have one. Oh well... for 7.7% I can't tell at all, this is a really sneaky beer. Good stuff!","kmcnair","Sep 20, 2004"
4.05,11.9,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Picked up a sixer on my recent trip back to the homeland (the autumnally beautiful MN). Pours a clear golden copper with pumpkin edges and a smallish, off-white head. Smells of mildly sweet, caramelly malt (brown sugar carrots). Slight, spicy hop presence. Taste starts off with the brown sugar carrot malt, followed by tangy whiskey flavors. Notes of alcohol and burning leaves lead into some surprisingly bitter hops. The good dose of hops is needed to balance out the hefty, mostly sweet, malt flavors. Lingering bitterness and sweet, buttery zuchinni bread. This is a great tasting Octoberfest and one that has some balls too (without being cough-syrupy sweet like the Kaiser). Good job Summit!","alexgash","Mar 11, 2004"

4.2,16,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Taste: Initial sweetness, with moderate alcohol burn. Very clean throughout, but this obviously leans toward the heavy side of Oktoberfest. Finish has doppelbock leanings, with lingering residual sweetness, and hops only come through in the very end. High abv causes the drinkability to suffer (for an o'fest), but this is definitely one tasty beer.","rabidawg","Dec 29, 2003"

Musky malt sweetness at the front with an underlying crispness, pleasant as noses go with the front quite sweet, almost cloying, top is middling in feel to the palate. The acidity is pesky and the hops pronounced with a bone dry aftertaste last lingers on with a slight bitterness and a fine representative to the style, even if it is a bit sweet but I like it nonetheless.","Gusler","Oct 30, 2003"

3.9,7.7,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"A clear, deep amber/copper body is punctuated by the creamy vanilla head that rests above it. It appears with an almost reddish cast while resting on the bar, but it's clearly more of a straightforward amber with golden highlights when held to the light. The nose displays a grainy, very toasty maltiness and some grassy/floral hops. The body is medium; and its fine carbonation leaves it crisp in the mouth. The rich, distinctly toasted Vienna malt is slightly sweet but well-balanced by a solid bitterness and some limited grassy/piney hop flavor; and it finishes dry with a lingering note of malt, then hops, and finally bitterness and a splash of alcohol. An enjoyable beer with a bit of a bite to it!","NeroFiddled","Oct 17, 2003"

Up front, crisp and sweet, malt dominated, some toasty flavoring off the bat. A spicy twinge in the body seems to overpower at first, but blends in rather nicely, a wonderful malty-caramel taste sets in nicely. Somewhat dry and woody throughout, the ABV is masked, yet a decent belly warmer; be careful, this O-Fest will slap you in the face if you don't pay respect, a clear winner from Summit.","GeoffRizzo","Oct 16, 2003"

It has a decent malt flavor, not as malty as I usually expect an Oktoberfest to be.  It also has a spicy hop flavor, and it finishes with malt sweetness.  Overall there is a decent balance of malt and hop flavor, but there is not quiet the fullness I would expect from an Oktoberfest.","BeerBuilder","Sep 22, 2002"

I think Summitt is one of the top 25 or so breweries in the U.S. and I have come to anticipate their seasonal releases. This is one of their better ones and once again it is a very enjoyable beer..","ZAP","Sep 09, 2002"
