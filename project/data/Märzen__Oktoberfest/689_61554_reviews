"I Pop!ped the cap and once gain, instituted a heavy-handed pour. The result was two fingers of rocky, foamy, tawny head with moderate retention. Color was Deep Amber/Light Copper to Copper (SRM = > 13, "

"The initial taste is ok, but the after taste is a bit off and the beer is a lot flatter than I would like."

"12 ounce bottle into dimpled mug, best before 1/13/2015. Pours hazy deep orange/copper color with a 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Slight spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, brown sugar, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light oak, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and light oak notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, brown sugar, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light oak, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light earthy herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, brown sugar, light nuttiness, light oak, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malts, earthy hop, and light oak flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavors as well with minimal esters present. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Oktoberfest style. All around good robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and light oak flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"This is a solid O'fest, which I will admit is not my favorite beer style. Love the addition of the oak. Really impressive flavor for the slightly higher ABV which is undetected. Try it if you see it!"

"Pretty good."

"Great offering, love the Oak"

" The taste is very nice with malt presence up front with mild grain taste with subtle yeast which has a light mineral edge leading into a caramel flavor from the malt and slight herbal hop character with semi-dry finish which has a light spice quality with mild alcohol taste. The Atom Smasher is interesting and very decent lager with nice drinkability and light malt sweetness w/out much wood character but it does contribute a slight lactic malt quality."

"Pours a pretty deep copper-amber in color with a thin off-white head. Some spotty lacing was seen when sipped, but not much and didn't stick. The aroma smelled 'soapy' for some reason and some caramel malts as well. Pretty much was the same for the taste with a hint of wood. After about 3 more good sips, I poured it out. Medium bodied and perfect carbonation...for the drain. LOL! Overall, the worst Oktoberfest brew I have had this season. Maybe I had a bad bottle? BUT the back of the label said ""BEST BY: 01/08/15""."

"This offering is eminently drinkable at a 7.7 abv."

"Overall, this beer did not live up to the claim on the bottle that it was a full bodied lager in the Marzen tradition.  It also lacked the promised complexity that was supposed to come from being aged in French oak foundries.  This beer came across more like a summer ale than an Oktoberfest."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lacked some depth that I expect from an Oktoberfest. True to the claim on the bottle, it is a unique twist on an Oktoberfest but unlike the claim on the bottle it is not ""unmatched"" by other imported Oktoberfest lagers."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The sweetness needs to be toned down a bit. If it had a bit more of the spice that's there and needs a bit of a hop note which I found completely absent"
""
""
""
"Overall it's not a bad beer by any means, just a bit one dimensional, still easy to drink"
"9/1....pours shiny copper, small foam layer. Mostly clear. Woodsy, oaky nose. Slight whisky note. Taste is a mixed up blend of malt, oak, whisky, vanilla. Smooth, creamy. Slight medicinal boozy flavor. Interesting for sure, but not all there. Points for creativity."

"This isn't too bad.  It's and okay Oktoberfest, and the oak aging definitely helps make it more interesting, but it's still just okay."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a different approach, a bit high abv% wise per style, deeper speciality grain influence and oaky alcohol makes this a bit heavier to consume then your typical lighter drinking fair. The carbonation is also a bit zealous and over-active. Not a bad beer, some interesting attributes from the oaky alcohol, a bit outside the box."
""
"O- This beer has a nice smooth malt flavor but I would really like to see a bit more sweetess just to add character to the malt and cut some of the pungency of the hops."

"Overall - A good flavorful fall beer, oak flavors are interesting and fit well with the other flavors. A good fall beer, and worth a try."

""

"Taste-Cracker malt,pale malt, subtle oakiness and warming alcohol in the finish. A nice, balanced mix of flavors. A good match for roasted chicken."

"O - nice changeup on a classic style with the oak foudre aging and the amped up abv. I'll usually pick up a bottle or 2 of this from my local brewery for Oktoberfest just for its uniqueness."
""

"Not something I would order again, but fans of lite beers might like it."

"O) Not a bad American style Oktoberfest. Very tasty beer I can't wait to have on tap!"

"Overall - Decent, could use more aroma."

"Overall, this is a splendid beer! I want to try it on draught."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall -A nice version of a marzen, I think the oak adds a nice touch. This is very drinkable for almost 8%. I bought this in a mix-a-six but I'm definitely thinking about picking up a full 6 pack before it's out of season."

"This is a nice Oktoberfest. Has a lactose quality similar to a Sweet Stout. Very smooth and malty."

"Have had this beer in previous years out of a bottle and did not like it at all. Went to the brewery today and tried some fresh and had a different experience. This years batch was released 3 or 4 days ago so it doesn't get much fresher. Very nice brew. Not overwhelmed by the oak (which was my previous experience). Very complex yet well balanced. An interesting interpretation of the Marzen style."

"O: Enjoyable beer, no doubt. I kinda wish I'd tried it a little fresher (September-mid October) as carbonation seemed a little underwhelming, but the flavors and feel were all good. Have tried a few from Two Brothers and generally like what I've had; I'd seek out this beer again!"

"O - I love this beer. I really do. However, I am going to rate it as it's labeled and branded. If you're looking for a typical Oktoberfest, you will not enjoy this. If you're looking for something that reminds you of pumpkins, red leaves, and cool nights full of stars in the sky... You got it."
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty decent spin on the style. Nice caramel malt taste with a interesting mix of oak and spice."
""
""

"O- this is a unique marzen an imperial one at that the wood nuances are splendid i only bought a single but will buy a few more to further enjoy this one"
""
""
"It's a bit strong for the style but still any easy drinker. I like."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: While the oak is a good idea, this is simply too sweet and boozy to be a really good Marzen."
""
"This is an interesting take on the style. It's definitely unique. I've never had a lager aged on oak before. Not overly exciting, but it's worth experiencing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: Two Brothers knocks another one out of the park."
""
""
""
"Carmel malt entry. Medium mouthfeel. A bit of oak. Tastes more like an ale than lager - has a sweetness that suggests ale yeast. Full flavors that suggest marzen, but the oak conditioning gives a unique spin. Nice beer. Different than an Octoberfest - but dances with the style. Flavorful, satisfying, unique....I like it."
""
"O: A great Oktoberfest with one of the best mouthfeels of it's style"

"The pour is a slightly cloudy amber color with a thin white head. A bit of oak and grass to it. Not really much aroma to it overall, maybe a little bit of malty sweetness. A very faint grass flavor with a little bread. A little bit of lemon zest and tartness. Really an odd beer. Light bodied with medium carbonation."
"Pours a pretty dul yellowish brown. Not much on the nose except for some fruit (apple?). Taste there isn't much going on here except for a sourness at the end that probably shouldn't be here (umm Oktoberfest beer?). Mouthfeel is pretty normal, not too thin tough. Hate to give bad reviews but this is overall a pretty avg beer and not something I would seek out again. Just like the previous review, I am having trouble figuring out how long this was in oak, cause it sure isn't there in the taste."
""
"O- My first two bros beer. Not a big fan of this one sorry. Much better oktoberfest beers out there. The oak on this one is lost IMO. Would like to try more of there offerings."

"I have to admit I’m a little let down by this one. Atom Smasher is like a community play — a lot of flavors competing for top billing, but none of them filling the role they were given with much skill."
"Not sure if this counts as an Oktoberfest beer cause if it does it definitely doesn't taste like a traditional Oktoberfest beer to me. But, I love brewers that experiment and make a beer that is their own. Use a style as a base and make a good beer off of that foundation. This has a much more fruity taste and smell to it then any other representation of the style I've had. But it's pleasant and easy to drink. I recommend it if you like different beer and aren't just going for that traditional taste of the style."
"Toasted sour bread with grapes make up teh taste. No oak or somewhat typical Oktoberfest flaors at all. I hop this is just a bad batch, if not this is the sourest interpretation of an Oktoberfest/Marzen I've ever had. I don't care for this beer at all and would bever recommend it."
"I think this is a better offering than some reviews I've read, and there may be a bad batch out there judging from some of the comments. Mine was in perfectly good shape and I know someone who might really enjoy one of these."
"O: This beer is alright. A little let down, but also have had better okto's."
"Trying the Atom Smasher tonight....and yikes....after the first sip....can't say I am a fan. The appearance is blah...the color is a hazy tan/light brown. There is virtually no head, after swirling the glass you get a white head that dissapates quickly. The smell is bread, sour dough, almost sour mash smell. The taste is very tart almost like drinking liquid sour dough bread. The mouthfeel is tough...high ABV masked by bready tart soury mash taste. Overall this is not a good beer....I'm wondering/hoping this is a bad bottle..or batch. Typically Two Brothers is a solid brewery this one in my mind missed the mark."
"Pours a medium copper color with a thin head that recedes quickly. Some spotty lacing. The nose brings forward plenty of bread and a light bit of caramel. Faint hops. The flavor is okay, having too much of a grain character with slight tannins and a mild tartness. Light body with bread crust and modest carbonation. Decent enough, but not something I would revisit."
"Oak is well integrated, there's a caramel apple flavor that's big, with a very mild bitterness in the dry, woody aftertaste. A light toasty malt sweetness comes through also, along with a general breadiness. Easy and light carbonation, still a traditional Oktoberfest in my mind, with a unique twist. The oak character is noticeable, but doesn't dominate. Enjoyed trying this, and I hope to see more oak-aged beers from 2 Bros. in the future."
"O -- The 7.7 is well hidden in both flavor and body. Overall impressions are pretty lackluster. I had some high hopes for this from the small local, but it's nothing really special. As pointed out above, the winy character of this beer isn't true Oktoberfest in style and just a little distracting. If this was labeled an Amber Ale the characters wouldn't be off."
"Overall: Not a traditional Oktoberfest, but interesting. I just wish the aromas and flavors played out a bit stronger."
"This was good, but I remembered last year's to be better than this. It just wasn't fully working for me and I'm glad I had it off tap rather than paying for a 6 pack"
"O: Not my favorite of the style. It was pretty average across the board."
"Overall: I'm admittedly not a huge fan of Oktoberfests, but I found this one to be enjoyable.. a solid beer to enjoy during the fall months."
"O-Great Marzen, interesting that I got the oak from the smell and it's interesting for a Marzen to utilize oak, but i will say i enjoyed the brew. One of the best american versions of a marzen i've had as of late."
"This was an interesting Oktoberfest to have on tap. Certainly unique in terms of flavor. Would like to try more of this, either on tap or bottle form."
"Overall, this is a decent marzen beer. The oak adds an interesting component that keeps me interested. Worth a try for sure."
"O: One of my favorite marzens now. I can see me buying quite a few more six packs this season."
"O ~ my first fall beer of the long awaited for season, not a bad start... something to try although i don't know if i'll buy another 6er with so many others to try. The nice thing though, is it came in 12 oz, 6 packs this year compared to last years 375...i think though, I'm gonna try this one out again soon and rethink my review..."
"D- Very drinkable because of its balance and mouthfeel"
"Two Brothers Atom Smasher Oktoberfest Style Lager is not as bad as the final score will indicate. That said, it isn't a smashing success and won't be a repeat purchase. Too bad the oak didn't add more to the positive side of the ledger."
"This one pours a muddy, dirty pumpkin with the cloudiness of a Belgian. It has a great deal of sediment. It smells sweet, funky, and has some good spice to it. It tastes really good. It's very fruit and has some interesting spice to it. It almost has some spicy orange to it. It's not a typical Oktoberfest that's for sure. It drinks very smoothly and has a good, soft mouthfeel. This beer is very tasty and drinks well. I'm really liking it."
"Nice light feel, with light carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable with above average flavor. I read somewhere that this beer was aged in oak barrels, but I could not taste it in the beer at all."
"Having just done a beer tasting featuring some of the best examples of the Oktoberfest style, I have to say that I don't think I'd be trying this one again. It's not bad, I just believe that there are so many better examples of the Märzen style out there."
"22oz bottle into an over sized Paulaner stein, wow this glass is huge."
""
""
""
""
"D- I think I could have a couple of these but probably something I wouldn't seek out."
"Overall- I really wanted to like this, being from a local brewery, but it is not really doing anything for me. Standard fair for an octoberfest."
"T/D: Good, didn't knock my socks off, but it was still a good beer. I'm usually impressed with the Two Brothers products, and though this wasn't my favorite, it still was pretty good and did not disappoint."
"mouthfeel is somewhat syrupy. i'd be more apt to buy this if it were available in a six pack. the tannic finish helps round out the syrupy sweetness of the beer. i'm not real into marzens, but this is a good beer."
"A very good Oktoberfest beer."
"Appears a slightly clouded deep caramel amber with a big billowing cream colored head. Fine speckled lacing scattered in my liter Paulaner krug. Aroma has some nutty caramel sweetness, tart cider like notes in the background. Alot of bread dough malt driven tones without much herbal hops to balance things out. Flavor super sweet almost sugary, lacks the balance that a nice toasted bread malty herbal hopped Ofest has I get it this isn't a straight up marzen this is a boozed up maltier version. Of all the Two Brothers beers I've tasted this is my least favorite. Mouthfeel becomes cloying especially once you're half way done, not my style of beer. I've had imperial Ofests that worked with higher alcohol the unbalanced malt/hop ratio is killing me. Carbonation is a bit much almost too heavy tickles the back of my throat and nares. Drinkability overall is really limited I wouldn't even suggest a bomber, I've been there and done that no need to revisit."
"This drinks pretty light and alchohol was not detectable. A good fall beer, but nothing out of the ordinary."
"Drinkability- Good, not great. I don't think I would drink several of these while hanging out in my leiderhosen, but at the same time I would have another one."
"D: I was pretty damn happy this beer. I've been in the mood for malty and this really delivered. Some of its minor defects were that it was a little sweet on the finish and it didn't look polished. Otherwise this was rock solid and I'd drink it again."
"Medium body, decent carbonation. Alcohol is well hidden. The oak does not show very much. Somewhat disappointing."
"Sweetness overload!"
"D: this is not my idea of a drinkable brew. The sweetness is nearly cloying and it doesn't feature what an Oktoberfest should be. The oak aging of this beer is virtually undetectable...I'm starting to question Two Bros use of the oak foudres. In theory, it sounds like a solid idea, but at the end of the day, it doesn't translate to a better beer."
"D- i wish that two brothers new oak foudres would impart a little more flavor on their beers. this is something i could probably have another of this fall, but i cant see myself drinking it too often."
"D: A decent Oktoberfest with the oak aging giving it a little character. Lighter body lends to easy drinking. Enjoyable, but not something I will necessary seek out again."
"Mouthfeel is sticky and the carbonation is way too low. I'm not happy about this aspect, as I think better carb would have brought some pep into what is coming off as a dead beer. Distracting and certainly under the necessary feel of Octoberfest beers. While this was a unique angle and started off with some nice added depth, I feel this beer fell short. It's drinkable but too flat and sticky to be enjoyable. Please carb this next year, get those carbon and oxygen atoms to smash and make bubbles. Probably worth a try for the die hard Marzen fan, but not worth another try for me."
"Delicious, I'll have another!"
"The 7% never really comes out in any negative way. It is well done for being one of the highest percents. I think I might just go purchase one, 7$ is cheap!, and surprise my buddy this weekend with it."
"d: one is enough, fix the carbonation and this opinion might change"
"Got this bottle on a whim from my local Binny's. It pours a clear dark orange with a thin quickly receding white head. The smell is very nice. Aside from the malt which there is strong smell of there is the smell of orange zest, pepper and what I believe to be an almost woodsy mesquite aroma. The taste is pretty damn good too. As far as I'm concerned it's the best Oktoberfest I've had this season. Now I say that with the caveat that my preference is to the sweeter more American Oktoberfests. Having said that the flavor is sweet malts on the front with hints of smokiness. The aftertaste isn't much with the distinct bittering and hints of cinnamon. It is smooth and highly drinkable. A definite recommendation if you have the opportunity."
"""Turn out your pockets. I see atoms!"" Good times with old Father Burns. This brew pours a slightly hazed dark amber topped by a finger or so of cream-coloured foam. The nose comprises orange zest, mandarin orange syrup (yes, just the syrup), rye bread, hot cinnamon (Dentyne-style, Homes), and a touch o' white flowers it may be the acid, but I can taste the colours...). The taste is pretty similar, with the citrus and sweet bready malts double-teaming my 'buds quite nicely. The body is a light medium, with a light carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a very nice O-Fest, one of the better I've had thus far this season."
"An interesting interpretation, if not near style. Overall a good beer, just don't expect to drink a few liters and be able to find your way home....without considerable help."
"drinkability is so so - i split the bomber and that was plenty for me this fall - sour flavors and no carbonation - the search continues for a great oktoberfest"
"Drinkability - This beer drinks great. Nice to see Two Brothers put a lager in the foundres. My only quip would be the carbonation. Even with that, it's a solid Oktoberfest."
