"Pours a light copper orange body with a thin head.  Smells of caramel and grain.  Clean yeast aroma.  Tastes grainy up front, later bready and malty honey.  Faint toast and apricot.  Moderate body with lively carbonation.  This is tasty and solid but not up to par with German versions."

"Finishes with a touch of sweetness. Bring on the oompah!"
""
"Overall-  Very solid.  I like a bit more carmel and malt in my octoberfest."
"solid oaktoberfest... had it fresh on draft this year.. it was great.. not Great LAkes though"

"The beer is more bitter than the smell (and most Octoberfests for that matter) indicate.  Less smooth and far more dry.  I don't detect any buttery oak notes.  The aftertaste is bitter.  Good body/carbonation."

"Pours a bright orange, nice and clear with thin white head which leaves tons of lacing.  The nose has all of the familiar malty notes I would expect in an oktoberfest with the addition of of some toasted oak which adds a nice dimension. Some slightly sweet malty notes are present along with that bone dry lager yeast character.  Taste is absent of any sweetness as all the malt is influenced strongly by the oak character.  The oak lends a very dry notes to the toasted malt character.  There is not a whole lot of character here although it is very easy to drink.  Mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated.  Overall, an interesting take on the style but a little lack in the flavor."
""
"Crisp, clean and refreshing. Tastes like a King's Hawaiian dinner roll. Very good."
""
"I like this octoberfest beer.....its lighter and crisper than some of the more maltier/sweeter versions.  The beer was clear golden with thin head that is leaving a mild lace.  The body is lighter than most but good carbonation.  Overall very drinkable."

"Some might consider this a bit on the hoppy side for the style, but that's expected (and most welcomed) from Firestone Walker's lagers. Delicious. Where's my Maßkrug?!"

"One of the most impressive things here for me is the cleanliness of the lager yeast in the aroma and flavor. It provides a nice base for the other things to shine but I don't think the malts are utilized enough here flavor-wise. Seems a bit too hoppy for a Marzen to me as well. A solid brew but doesn't hit some of the style's primary points."

"Solid. Not exactly true to style, but a nice take nonetheless. Insanely drinkable and almost refreshing. Novel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A relatively hoppy Marzen but still nicely balanced and drinkable."
""
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation, a grainy or malty dominance in the taste and aftertaste which leads to a slightly bitter finish that is very grainy and almost like yeast or bread dough linger. An above average Märzen / Oktoberfest that was smooth and easy to drink."
""

"One of the better brews thus far from Firestone.  I am becoming more and more a fan of them.  This beer is very hearty and has the right amount of punch.  Does not taste like the traditional Octoberfest brews, but it is pretty woody.  The beer is not bad, but I do not know how it is considered Octoberfest.  It does have an aroma of malts and barley, a small amount of head and lace and the right amount of zesty appeal on the tongue.  Relatively smooth and all expectations exceeded."
""

"Overall, the most under-whelming Oktoberfest beer I've ever had."

"(3.75) O:  nice oaky influences, subtle yet enjoyable and appreciable. Fresh noble hop flowers, very drinkable, not compromising the main principal associated with style, clean flavor, crisp off the tongue begging for more. Abv% is kept within guidelines for multiples, nice noble influence and bonus of oak aging. If you are expecting a parabola or sucaba, then you may be dissappointed, the flavor is not as big or bold, nor is suppose to be, the drink is kept more traditional with an oaky twist."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very well done. Flavor is screaming while also tamed and crisp."
"Mouthfeel is a little sticky. Overall, I like this. Best marzen I've had in a long time (but it's the only marzen I've had in a long time)."

"Of coarse FW hits the style perfectly.  An excellent lager, and one that I want to keep coming back to.  Another reason why they are probably my favorite brewery.  They do the big bruiser styles well, but the simpler styles like this and Pivo are amazing as well."

"Overall - A pretty ho-hum oktoberfest, and a disappointment from Firestone-Walker. It's a bad sign when your Marzen is more hoppy than your ""hoppy pilsner"". Wouldn't buy again, and with the price I paid for the sixer it's a definite one and done."

"Pours a nice clean/clear golden color, nice carbonation, nice creamy one-finger head, which leaves some nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, and sweet. The taste is malty, with some nice hop bitterness thrown in. Medium body, nice slightly dry finish. Overall a very nice brew, nice to see a different Firestone Walker around here."
""

""

""

"O 3.75 - definitely unique by aging it on oak. It's very inviting and very easy to drink."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a crystal clear deep golden color with a huge bubbly off white head that persists forever. A bit of sulfur dripped off this at first pour, but slowly dissipated as I waited for the head to recede. Earthy mineral water, rich bready pilsner malt and a hint of spicy floral hop. The flavor is clean rich bready light caramel malts with barely a touch of spice. Medium body moderate to high level of carbonation. Tastes better than it smells, I could drink these but pales in comparison to some of the imports."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I didn't get the feel of a Marzen bier with this one. It has the flavor and profile of a west coast IPA, albeit a mild one. That's not to say that this beer isn't enjoyable, it certainly is. Refreshing and tasty, smooth and clean tasting, crisp and mildly bitter to end. Very good beer, but it doesn't have the profile of an Oktoberfest beer. Would recommend to those who like their IPA' s on the mild side."

"D:  Firestone-Walker Oaktoberfest offers some very crisp and refreshing drinkability.  I love how they kept to style while adding their own little touches.  It really comes through in the final product which is a nice brew."

"Overall one of the better Oktoberfest beers I had this year but the price may keep me away from a repeat purchase."

"T: Graham cracker. Light hop spicing and low applewood notes and grape musk. Essence of cinnamon. Very nicely balanced between full-flavored toastiness and a fainter malt sweetness, barely noticeable caramel. A little too Pils forward for my liking in a Marzen with just a touch of sulfuric minerality, but a good tasting beer nevertheless. Really much closer to a Dortmunder (3.75/5)"

"Overall - Oktoberfest being my favorite style, I have to say this one is bit of a let-down, especially for the price paid (a little over $10 for six). It's thinner, and more bitter than I would want for this style; I personally prefer a more malty, thick, and potent brew in my Oktoberfest. That being said, the beer is still very drinkable and far from providing a bad experience. Just over-priced (in my area, anyway) and under-malted."

""

""
""
"A solid, well-balanced märzen beer that packs malt and hop flavors in an easy drinking package."
""
"O- nice, on par with Victory Festbier but not as good as Ayinger Oktober Fest-Marzen.  I was expecting a little bit more from this beer base on hype I had heard and how much I like other firestone walker beers.  Still very drinkable and a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O -- Pretty surprised and impressed by this one.  I'd heard it was hopped more heavily than a traditional Oktoberfest, but the hops compliment the malts very nicely. Since this is closer to a Wies'n Fest I don't miss the big melanoidin Bavarian Amber Märzen carries, but I wish there was a little more.  To the plus side, it's not a roasty or nutty beer at all, relying on good malt and hop combo to make up a pretty good brew."

"o: a really solid beer.  its nothing mind-blowing, but i think that speaks more to the style than the beer itself.  this is super smooth to drink and quite tasty. definitely something good to kick off fall"
"A basic Oktoberfest with a slight oak twist, still quite tasty."
""
""
"O-  decent marzen, the oak is subtle but there,"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste / Palate: The flavor has nice malty sweetness up front with well balanced hops finishing it off. The malt offers notes of light caramel and toffee with a touch light nuttiness. The hops balance the malt sweetness with spicy and earthy herbal bitterness and dryness. The palate feels right on. It’s smooth, nicely carbonated and very drinkable."
"12oz. bottle served in a tumbler.  07/17/14 printed on the label. Pours a golden orange with a translucent clarity and a loose, one inch, bright white head.  Nose is fairly nondescript - light malts and a hint of skunk.  Taste consistent with nose - not overly malty for a Marzen.  There's also a slight toasty quality, a bit of grassiness and noble hops bittering towards the finish.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a mild, even carbonation.  While I can't say that I particularly enjoy the big caramel notes associated with the style, this is a bit lacking.  I was anticipating that the oak would help attenuate the caramel malts and add an additional dimension; however, this is a bit too dull for my liking."
""
"O - Not a very good Marzen. Over hopped and too light in body and taste. Closer to a pilsner. Wouldn't buy again."
""
""
""
"Tastes of caramel, nut, light chocolate, and earthy hops.  Bit more complex for this style than I am used to, but very good.  Glad I picked up a six."
""
"Serving type: bottle"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very light bodied marzen, maybe not what I look for but a solid enjoyable brew."
""
"Lots of toasted biscuit and sweet malts to absorb in the flavor and it ends clean and crisp. But is this anything special?  Nope."
""
"Pours with a 2 finger head and is golden orange/yellow.  Beer is clear.  Some head remains.  Could have a cold but I do not get much on the nose. Bread, earth (oak?) with a spice (cannot put my finger on which one)  kicking on the back end and more bread.  Mouthfeel is good.  Overall a good beer."
""
"Overall a bit disappointed although not really since I didn't have much expectations anyways. American breweries just don't know how to make a good Oktoberfest. they always seem to think it needs lots of candy sweetness and reddish malts, and bitter herbal grassy hops. The good German breweries are nice lagered characters with light malts that speak for themselves, don't need all the extra things added into it. To be fair though, this isn't nearly as bad as most American O-fests which are loaded with caramel and Munich malts and super sweet. But, tt's barely enjoyable actually even if this wasn't supposed to be an Oktoberfest. 3.5"

"Bottle."
"This looks, smells, and tastes closer to a Pilsner...WTF Firestone?!"
"Overall - A very good beer, but nothing really outstanding. It's taste is light and subtle; clean and crisp. It misses the mark a little for me due to what I perceive as an overly drying finish, which I believe affects it's drinkability in a negative way. Some folks may enjoy that aspect, of course, and hell, maybe it's more ""traditional"" as festbiers go."
""
""
"I somehow missed this one last year, so let's rectify that early this year.  It pours a cleark brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam.  The nose comprises light sweetgrass, light white bread, and a touch of dried honey.  The taste holds notes of mildly sweet biscuit, grass, very light honey, and the softest touch possible of hard water.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, a nice, seemingly traditional O-Fest, one that's decidedly easy to drink a few of in a single sitting."

""

""
""
""

"The Verdict: Not bad. Hoppier than expected, though I shouldn’t be too surprised coming from Firestone. As it warms the hop bite subsides and the marzen character begins to appear. Fresh and refreshing, especially for the style."
""
""
""
"Well made. Case worthy"
""
"Overall, this is solid, but is lacking the toasted malts associated with Oktoberfest styles."
""
""

"O: Quaff city. This is an awesome Octoberfest. Delicious all the way around and so easy to drink. Give me liter mugs of this all day."
""
""
""
"Pours a lovely amber. True gold no orange. Looks like a maibock. Fat head of cream colored foam that lasts and leaves lace. Nose is malty and has a the beginings of honey on it but stops short of any real honey scent. In fact it is the lightest oktoberfest I have ever seen. Light in color light in scent. It has a bit of hop herbal on it. Fresh grass. It’s cool like ti has the dew on it. Taste is light and smooth. Not really toasty bread but again more like a maibock. Light sweet malt that is the sweetness of the grain and only verges on a light honey. Dry white bread rather than crusty dark bread.  Dry crisp malt that’s round and gives a medium mouthfeel. A bit of fresh herbal hops come up to accent this one and offer balance. It finishes dry crisp, impeccably smooth and you cannot help but wonder how they managed to expose only the inherent sweetness of the grain so expertly. The hops leave a touch of bitter to linger and some grain to echo on the back palate. Unique and superb in texture; and in style and presentation to the palate.  The oak becomes mor eprominent as ti warms and it is quite dry."
"Beautiful amber orange in color with perfect clarity, Poured with a fizzy white foam that quickly reduced to a soapy cap. Light toasted and caramel malt, fresh earthy herbal hop and grassy aromas. Medium bodied with a full, slightly oily feel through the middle followed by a tangy, crisp hop bite near the end. Bready and toasted malt flavors up front and through the middle followed by crisp herbal hops from the middle to the end. Finished crisp and dry with a lingering herbal hop bitterness. Marzens aren’t a tongue twisting, taste bud numbing style. I’ve heard and read of a lot of disappointment with this particular beer almost as if Firestone Walker was going to reinvent the style. Well they didn’t. They made areally good marzen."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours bright amber with fluffy two finger eggshell white head. Lots of caramel malts and crisp floral noble hops in the nose. Light and crisp on the palate with sweet caramel malts cut by bright earthy and floral hops. Very clean lager yeast finish. This definitely fills the Oktoberfest void left by Great Lakes when I moved to the west coast."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  Not a great offering by Firestone.  Honestly though, I'm not much of a fan of the style, so this one may knock the socks off of the Oktoberfest lovers out there."

"O: kind of reminds me of a couple of Victory's veteran hoppy offerings, namely Hop Wallop and Prima Pils - I was convinced HW was all German ingredients after the first few times having it - this isn't far off from that, which I wasn't anticipating... seeing this for what it is, I could session the schnitzel out of it - very nice!"
"A pretty decent Oktoberfest. I have to say I thought it was going to be a tad better, but still decent."
"Plenty of carbonation here, too. Combined with the hops, this beer is all kinds of zingy."

""
""

"Just enough bitterness to sharpen up the flabby malt. Definitely the best Märzen-style brew I have had, maybe ever. Who knew that a dose of oak was the missing ingredient to make an Oktoberfest really drinkable?"
""
"The body was nicely full, without being heavy, and had a slightly sticky finish. Drinkability was excellent, I could see grabbing a liter or three of this beer. Overall, an excellent take on the style, a must try if you see it."
""
""
"Poured into a Fremont Brewing pint glass. Pours a light to medium golden amber with a half finger white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of biscuit malt and a touch of grassy hops. Flavor is caramel and biscuit malt with a nice touch of vanilla from the oak, light grassy hops. Medium bodied with great carbonation. A nice marzen style lager with good malt balance and surprisingly rich tasting for the ABV. Nicely done."

"one of the better versions ive had this fall, but I wanted it to be oaky, like its name misleadingly suggests. pours a pumpkin orange color into a 10 oz. globe with a robust white head that settles slowly. clear liquid, lots of bubbles, great nose. freshly fallen leaves, vanilla sweetness, caramel malt, german yeast, and a hint of wood. the flavor is a little less interesting than the nose, where everything is subtle, even the german malts. very little residual sugar though, which I love, and a fast finish, even for a lager. vanilla is light. I really wish this was oaked, or more so if it is, because I don't taste it and I think it would lend itself well to a good oaking. still a great beer though. light and drinkable, I could pound on these. firestones regular beers are as good as their whales. bomb stuff here."
"Pours a clear light orange with a foamy bone head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, and fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and grain flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is a solid American take on the style in my opinion."

"On-tap and the Library Ale House, Santa Monica, CA, back in September 2012. The beer appeared a darker amber color that was clear with a nice one-finger head that was pretty light. The beer gave off a very nice, robust malty aroma with hints of biscuit. The taste was as expected from a marzen, a big malt flavor, perhaps toasted and no bitterness to note. The beer had a lighter moderate feel, but the carbonation seemed to be right. The beer was very easy to drink, it was clean and refreshing. Overall, a fine beer and one that I will hope to get next fall."
""
""
"Overall: a tasty and easy drinking oktoberfest. The flavor profile is good, but not mind-bending. This is that sit down, shut up and enjoy the beer type of brew. Great session beer."
""
""
"M: Appropriately light and drinkable, but at times it seems like the beer is a lot bigger than its ABV."
""
"Drink- I'm pretty thankful I didnt go for the 1/2 pint or a tulip size pour. For me it wasn't bad. Just not my cup of tea I guess."
""
""
""
""
"O - I expected a little more out of this beer. Firestone Walker normally goes a lot bigger on their flavors and this beer was a little bland for my taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice medium-dark orange color. Not a whole lot on the nose but there's a slight biscuity/malty aroma. Taste follows suit but notes of oak and vanilla also come through. Finish is dry, leaving the drinker reaching for another quick sip. It's not the most remarkable beer from this stellar brewery, but a good take on the style nonetheless."

"The aroma was rather light and muted, some decent malts, and a ton of bready like flavors, but overall just a touch too light for me. Crisp, clean feel, which was nice and adequately carbonated, but again, just a touch too light to really be effective. Smooth flavor started with a light hint of caramel and a touch of earthy grains. This quickly floated away though and the only thing left was a nice touch of biscuit like flavor that linger for a moment."
"Overall a pretty good beer, it's simple and drinkable. I enjoyed my glass, a nice change of pace."
"Overall a great fall session seasonal. I would really like to see it in six packs."
"Bottle shared at the September iteration of the Santa Cruz tasting series. Pours a clear copper color with a sticky white head. Aroma is malty and spicy, toasted cereal. Authentic German malty flavor, toasty grains and a nice mineral quality to it. Clean on the palate. Nothing too exciting but well made."
"O: Not so remarkable, but plenty enjoyable/drinkable. The use of Paulaner yeast (learned after finishing most of the glass) is most apparent in the finish; there is a notable brassy/mineral quality in the finish. Light enough in strength to enjoy several pours of without too many ill effects."
"Overall, Decent Oktoberfest. Really somewhere between 1/2 Lager and 1/2 Ale."
"D: The flavors weren't overly impressive, but this was a pretty easy to drink beer."
"D: Oaktoberfest is a pretty run-of-the-mill Märzen. Decent, but not worth seeking out again."
"Pours a clear amber color with minimal head. Very faint aroma of malts; tough to identify anything in particular. The flavor is pretty mild as well; some woody malts, and light hints of spice. There's a mild bitterness in the aftertaste. Medium bodied with some light, tingly carbonation. Pretty drinkable, low-ish ABV, but I wasn't too inspired by this: maybe it was a bad keg, but there was so little flavor, and what was there just wasn't inspiring."
"Poured into a ceramic mug at the festival so I couldnt judge the appearance properly, but I did see this beer in pitchers and it looked pretty nice. A good medium brown beer tapped from a large barrel. Sweet malts with a good side of spice. Low bitternes and not much oak (especially for a beer named oaktoberfest) but there were some good earthy/wood characterists. Probably my favorite Oktoberfest beer to date. Had this on tap as well but it really shined from the cask. Mouthfeel and subsequently drinkability were enhanced greatly, super smooth, delectable. Firestone Walker's offerings almost never disappoint me."
"Firestone Walker Brewing Company--Pasa Robles, CA--Oaktoberfest Marzen. 5.00% ABV. 24 IBU's. Thin white head. Clear bright amber color. Mild toasted caramel delicate Noble Hallertau hop front. Crisp tangy caramel malty Marzen body. Light Oak hint. Clean crisp end. (4.0 / 5.0). 5 oz. Taster @ Fremont Oktoberfest 9/24/2010."
"Enjoyed on tap at Papago. Poured medium golden color with thin white head. Nose was very clean with a whiff of malt. Palate had the malt focus as well, with a sweet oak sort of dryness in the background. Overall though it was still somewhat light bodied and easy drinking."
"I really enjoyed this one. Nicely balanced between being the hops and malts. Worth seeking out."
"Drinkability: This was a damn good märzen/Vienna lager (it's actually a mix of the two styles). This was perfect for the festival. I would happily order it again."
"Excellent, even if it really isn't ""to style"". I wish this beer was sold at Oktoberfest."
"On tap at Woodstocks Pizza in Isla Vista. Pretty random find, but they do sell the FW private label beers as well. Orange-gold color with a creamy head. The aroma has a lot of toasted malts, with just a touch of noble hop spice. The flavor has plenty of rich, toasty malt flavors with almost perfect hop balance. Medium-light on the palate. This is quite reminiscent of the oktoberfests that they actually serve in Munich, which are much more drinkable than the darker marzens that get shipped over here. Make no mistake though; this is a more complex and flavorful beer than the versions that the major Munich breweries are making. I'm a bit confused on the oak part. My roommate says he tasted oak, but I didn't pick out anything definitive, and Firestone's website doesn't say anything about oak in the production process. Regardless, this is another awesome Firestone beer, and one that I can see anyone loving."
"Poured golden with a small white head. Nose was slightly hoppy and grainy. On the taste I was really missing the oak but it did have a nice balance of malt and hops.Mouthfeel was rather dry and crisp. Overall it was pretty good eventhough its not my style. Expected more oak."
"I was pleasantly surprised to find this on tap at San Diego Brewing Company. Pours a vibrant gold/orange. The small head has decent retention and lacing. My nose is greeted by an earthy and slightly piney hop aroma. Sweet bread, nutmeg, very grainy. I spent a few minutes trying to pinpoint the dominant characteristic in the malt profile of Oaktoberfest and decided it was grain. The beer smells very grainy. The beer is reminiscent of a pumpkin ale, but I don't think there is any pumpkin flavor in it. Aromas of nutmeg, clove, some vanilla, and possibly allspice give it pumpkin ale characteristics. These are not primary characteristics of the aroma but were detectable nonetheless. The mild bitterness up front is quick to introduce caramel and grainy malt flavors. The taste is of oak, nutmeg, and vanilla, and a faint hop bitterness concludes the show. The carbonation is good."
"Easy to put away a glass of this one, but not the best I've had of this style."
"Nice brew. A good solid refreshing marzen beer. Was expecting a little more oak profile but like it the way it is."
"D- Oktoberfests are meant to be very drinkble beers. Alchohol seemed low enough (guessing about 5% or 6%), that anybody could have this for a night of seasonal celebration."
"D: I enjoyed this one from Firestone, though I didn't find it to have a great drinkability, I was really sipping on this beer more than just drinking it. Still it's an interesting brew, definitely worth a try."
"Nice offering from Firestone, expected a marzen from the name but plesantly surprised with this American twist on a Vienna, also cool was that a dollar from each of the pints drank today went to a charity for MS, would love to drink again but do not know how likely that is with its limited availability and all, recommended"
