"One of the best Octoberfests I've had."
"Best Fest bier in the world. Hands down."
""
""
""
"I love all things authentic, so knowing this is a quite authentic Oktoberfest beer earns some automatic points for me. I have come to really love the taste, and the mouthfeel is great as well. It would be nice it the aroma was a little stronger, but overall this is a great beer, and definitely one of the best oktoberfest beers I have tried."
"Overall : ill pass on it next time. It's not bad but whatever, it's okay."
"500ml bottle. 04/15. Pours a bright, golden amber colour with a frothy, off white head which reduced to a collar and left a trace of lacing. Pleasantly malty aroma with a hint of grassy hops. Mildly sweet with a touch of bitterness in the finish. Smooth, medium bodied and quite easy to drink. Decent enough but didn't leave me craving more."

"M: Super drinkable.  Medium body.  Delicious."

"One of the better Octoberfest beers I have had."
""
"50 cl bottle (bb 05/15) into a lager glass. Clear deep amber body, big white foamy head, good retention, little lacing. Sweet smell of toasted caramel malt. Taste begins with sweet caramel malt, followed by a toasted taste, ending dry with a slight floral hop bitterness to balance out the taste. The aftertaste has toasted malt and floral hop. Medium-light body, medium carbonation. Overall a very smooth and drinkable beer with nice flavor, I could easily have a couple more of these."
""
""
""
""
"pours a bright clear copper color, with fluffy bone-white head.  decent head retention.   aroma is grainy, a bit nutty.   same with taste, decent balance, just a bit sweet.  bready, no real hop flavor.   thin to medium body, higher carbonation."

"BBD 05/15 (Original Oktoberfest version).  Clear medium amber pour with just a touch of ruby.  Exceptional head, lacing and retention.  Light nose of biscuit with a touch of caramel and an almost imperceptible noble hop note.  Almost medium bodied with a nice almost creamy texture.  Above normal carbonation with a very good amount of effervescence on the finish.  The exceptional flavor profile is superbly balanced, complex and very flavorful (intensity).  It begins with an effervescent explosion of malt - mostly biscuit over a light caramel sweetness.  In the middle, a light hop bitterness and noble hop flavor predominate.  In the somewhat crisp finish as the bitterness fades, comes the final effervescent burst of lingering hop flavor.  This one just edged Ayinger out as my favorite import."

"delicious malts. Very drinkable"
"O: Very drinkable, but a little sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice darker amber in color with a good 2-finger foamy off-white head that last while before settling down to a good 3mm head. Lots of sticky lacing is seen when sipped that sticks to the sides of the 'Texas Boot'. The aroma is of roasted malts, some spice, with a slight metallic/mineral aroma as well. The taste has even a bit more going on with some bready yeast and some caramel malts in the mix as well. Crisp and clean and goes down pretty easy and you don't taste the metallic / mineral aroma. Medium bodied with good carbonation as there are some large bubbles rising up  from the bottom and sides of the boot. Overall, a very good Oktoberfest brew."

"Pretty good. Definite traditional octofest.  A little thin on body but hard to beat how everything comes together.  Very smooth.  An alcohol bite in the end along with German twang. Gets better as I work down the das boot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a beautiful amber with a short-lasting fizzy white head. No lacing at all. The aroma is mild, bready and lightly sweet. The taste is equally mild and similar in profile with a little earthy hops on the finish. The body is a little thinner, heading towards watery but not quite there. A decent amount of carbonation throughout. Not my favorite German Marzen."
""
""
""
""
"My first ever 5!!!"
"A much lighter and MUCH sweeter version of the Marzen style than I am used to. A little watery on the mouthfeel for the style as well. Overall, a decent beer, but so far my least-favourite Oktoberfest yet."
"Delicious"
""
""
"O: A very nice representation of the style, very easy to drink and quite enjoyable. I could easily have a few of these in an afternoon/evening."
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was a solid example of a traditional Oktoberfest beer, it had most of the aspects that I look for in the style and everything seemed to be pretty inline with the style.  This beer had decent drinkability, it was smooth, fairly clean, crisp, not too filling and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention and I think two would be my limit, any more than that and the apple cider aspect might start to wear on me.  What I like the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was good and it was just what I expect from the style.  What I like the least about this beer was the apple cider aspect in the taste and aroma, I think I would like this beer a little more if it didn't have that.  I might buy this beer again when looking for a traditional Oktoberfest, but it's not something I'm going to keep my fridge stocked up and I would say it's worth a try, but I don't think it's a great example of the style.  All in all I thought this was a solid beer, but it was just slightly rough around the edges and I think if it was cleaned up just it little it would be a pretty good example of the style.  This wasn't my favorite Oktoberfest, but it's not a bad one and this beer made a decent first impression of this brewery and I would be interested in trying more of there beer.  Solid job guys, keep up the consistent work."
""
"3.34/5: Pretty good, but I expected more from Ze Fatherland"
""
""
""
"An amber colored octoberfest beer. Good balance of bitter and malt, malt toast and sweetness come through, but well balanced with the hops which keep this from being a malt forward beer.  A medium light body makes this beer very drinkable."
""
"O- I am normally a double baltic porter or stout man, so if my wife had not brought this back from Germany... I might have never tried it. Once again, the wonderful world of beer has impressed me, and I have found another style to add to my growing list of ""MUST DO AGAIN"" beers. I think it was a well put together beer from a well reputed brewer. Next time... I'll have to enjoy more than one!"
""
"pleasantly surprised. a delicious, light Oktoberfest....pretty refreshing on a hot day"
""
""
""
"Deep damn amber, deeper than most without finding a new adjective. Just a bit of white head. Nice looker. Soft on the nose (compared to GL Oktober for example). Shined though on the taste... such a sophisticated balance. Mouthfeel was v. appropriate to style. Such a balance and enjoyability I may have not experienced in Oktoberfest... opening some eyes as we speak."

"Really tasty oktoberfest. Pours a medium brown with very little to speak of in terms of head or lacing along the glass. Smell is sweet, malty -- hints of raisin. Taste is also sweet -- raisin, slight caramel, slight chocolate, almost syrupy. All in all - pretty delicious. Great session beer for the fall."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Its a good Oktoberfest, but more yeasty and grassy than I would like."

"250mL / Tulip Glass / Schmankerl Stube, Hagerstown, MD"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I've been waiting to have this again for a while and I'm glad I had it on tap. Such a great example of the style. Perfectly executed."
""
"Less than medium body, light effervescence, drying finish, fruit and malt take over the aftertaste. Good and mellow."
""
"It poured a clear deep amber with a full white head. The aroma was malt and malt only with caramel malt as the dominant aroma. The taste followed suit with a perfect sweet malt that was fully committed to the nutty caramel malt profile with little to no hop presence. It’s was a fully malt embraced beer that makes me want to be in the big tents in Munich hoisting a stein. Hacker-Pschorr is excellent Oktoberfest that is a signature of the season."
""
""
"Poured in a SA Lager glass. Thick head with great retention and lacing with each sip. This marzen style lager is spot on. great Munich Malt up front flavor and lower hop bitterness in the aftertaste. I make a point to pick up a rack or two of this each year and look forward to it above most Octoberfests. One of my favorite beers period. This is my top non-weisn style of the season and yes I have had Ayinger!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very good Oktoberfest from one of Munich’s breweries, but it’s not my favorite, which is Paulaner. That being said, I’d still drink this beer all day and love doing it!"

""
""
""
""
""
"O- Marzen-Octoberfest is a favorite lager style of mine. This is a good example why."
"Overall: Solid Oktoberfest beer. Not the best of the bunch, but still worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer makes you wish every fest was Oktoberfest. Sweet yet full-bodied. Amber colored yet wheat like. Light yet satisfying. Goes great with food (like brats at my next tailgate next Saturday) or by itself. And it's fun to try in different glasses--from steins to a weizen glass--to compare. Life is good. Prost!"
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Clean and smooth, lightly toasted bready grains, maybe sunflower seeds, and a very mild hint of bitterness in the aftertaste that is barely there. Easily drinkable. Simple and classic, a traditional example to judge others against I suppose."
""
""
""
"Fantasic drink. Autumn in a glass."
""
""
""
""
"I wait all year for this beer and the 5 other Oktoberfest beers arrive in my local store. I only acknowledge the 6 beers from Munich as true Oktoberfest beers the others are someone’s interpretation of a fest beer. This one is great, every aspect is pleasing, as a matter of fact the only way it could be better would be having served in the Hacker & Pschorr tent in Munich."
"This Beer was absent from the Pacific Northwest for a year. Finally found it at my favorite store (Malt & Vine). Previously available in bomber sized bottles, now in a 6-pack of 11.2 oz bottles. I'm not complaining. This is the perfect beer, in my humble opinion. Certainly the best of the Oktoberfests I have tried and probably the best beer, apologies to Sierra Nevada Pale Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Ein Prosit!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"H-P's Oktoberfest is one of those rare beers that you can enjoy glass after glass of. One of my go-to 'fests and a top pick among the many Marzens that flood the shelves each fall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - When it comes to the style, this is highly recommended."
"Summary - Delicious and somewhat malty. One of the best Oktoberfests I've had."
""
""
""
"This is probably my favorite Oktoberfest beer out of Germany. Terrific clarity, light body, sweet and malty aroma and taste. A bit ""bready"" taste with a very smooth finish. This is the beer other Oktoberfests need to be compared to. Well done."
""
""
""
""
"One of the best out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Towards the end of Hacker-Pschorr's simple and understated Oktoberfest, the metallic flavor and mouthfeel go away, really increasing it's enjoyment but, regardless, this beer is brewed for sheer drinkability; something it truly excels at."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Tastes like a well-crafted beer which I can appreciate. Not my favorite, however, drinks like a smoothed out nut brown ale."
""
""
"Cleaner and skunkier than most Oktoberfests. It's aiiiiggghhtt."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was damn good, I'm glad i got a 24 pack of these, should last me about a week. Quite cheap too but I bought it wholesale. I recommend this beer for sure."
""
""
""
"O - One of the better Oktoberfest beers available at this time of year"
"Once again got a chance to return to this seasonal favorite. It poured with a 2 inch head that remained for well over 10 minutes. The lace on the side of the glass lasted the entire glass! The appearance was a beautiful dark amber. Allow this spirit to get to 50° and you'll really enjoy the malty goodness at the end. By far one of my top 20 beers and it's even better on tap if you can find it!"

"This is better than most of the German Oktoberfests I've tried. I prefer more body and sweetness, but I would drink this again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a good beer realy drinkable I can put theese back all night but I was just hopeing for a lil more going on"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: very drinkable. could have a few of these since they are not overly sweet or strong."
""
"Comes out of the tap a dark golden amber with a fairly good fine-bubbled pale amber-tan head. Malty aroma has an overtone of cloves and a firm apple note, almost like a cider. Flavor has a malty core with firm notes of cloves and apple and hints of caramel and horehound. Texture is crisp, smooth and fairly fizzy, very refreshing. All around a good, if not remarkable, beer. Prost!"
""
""
""
"O: VERY drinkable oktoberfest marzen."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a good Marzen representative of the style"
""
""
""
"Amber colour, fairly large thick head, clear. Aroma was Munich malts was also slightly grassy. Tasted Munich malt and cranberry, finish was long and wheaty, fairly sweet but balanced. Body was slightly thick, smooth texture, moderate carbonation. Understated, not complex or as in your face as other Munich Oktoberfest beers but very drinkable."
""
"O - Overall pretty standard for the style. Good crisp lager characteristics with a hint of hops. Nice."
""
""
"Overall I can't think of anything better after a hard day at work. These guys make some great dunkel and lager beers so I expected the same quality. Great brew."
""
""
""
""
"O - Dry finish balances well with the caramel-like melanoidin and mild hops."
"Poured from a 330 mL bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a translucent red amber with a decent white head. Smells of caramel and dark roasted malt, but with the normal ""import smell."" Tastes of some dark roast malt with caramel taste overtone. Beer is perfectly carbonated for its light body and finishes crisp. Overall, a very good beer."
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: Most likely my favorite Oktoberfest."
""
""
"O - Looks great, smells great, tastes great. The quintessential marzen style oktoberfest."
"O- A lot of complexity for a lager. I enjoyed the malt forward quality as a nice change of pace from the hoppy beers I usually drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!!!"
"Tasty; goes down all too easily. Crisp and refreshing, with the hops adding a pleasant spicy twang to the flavour. A quality brew - I could imagine sinking more than a few of these at a German fest. Well worth trying."
""
""
"I almost imagine the standards for good brewing being discussed over a few pints from this ancient brewery. This beer opened my eyes to the genius of German styles. Don't start here, end here."
""
""
""
""
"O: Wow, great beer. One of my favorite versions of my favorite style. ""One"" could drink many of these in succession, and right now I am the ""one""."
""
""
"O: Excellent drinkability. Excellent Oktoberfest specimens. Hacker-Pschorr quality. Prost!"
""
"From a bottle poured into a pint glass, this is a translucent caramel brown color. Smell is sweet grains and caramel. Taste is mellow and sweet, mostly brown sugar and bread. Almost no hop profile. Light bodied and easy to drink, this is a very enjoyable version of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"First time I've had this style and it's decent but not necessarily great to me as I'm not familiar with the style. The appearance is a nice brownish-yellow. The smell is a sweet yeasty bready nose. The tongue leans toward a yeasty sweetness, not overwhelmingly sweet but a mellow sweet. I'm liking this as the sipping continues. Mouthfeel is a thin/medium, not very watery. Overall this is decent and will have again. Certainly sessionalbe with the low abv."
""
""
""
""
""
"An absolute must try!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bready malt up front. Lots of toasted malts, sweet caramel, biscuit, honey. Slight grassy-herbal towards the finish. Body is medium, crisp, nice carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Orangish ambler in color with perfect clarity. Poured with a thick off-white foam that slowly reduced to a wispy cap. Earthy grain and toasted malt aromas with sweet caramel malt aromas beneath. Velvety smooth delicate feel with lazy tight carbonation. Grainy, caramel malt flavor up front followed by sweet toasted malt thru the middle to the end. After a tangy hop bite near the end, finishes semi-dry with a toasted, bready aftertaste. A fabulous marzen."
""
""
"Toasted malts quickly give way to cookie dough, bready malts, and slight fruitiness. Some spicy, peppery hop bitterness hides in the background. Lingering caramel/cookie malt and leafy, spicy hop bitterness. Moderate body, with a slick feel. Nice balance."
"Overall this is one that I'll look for again."
""
""
""
"Great with pretzels and mustard, brats and burgers -- would probably cut through a spicy pepperoni pizza. Perfect beer for a late summer evening in SE Virginia, with the Weber fired up."
""
""
""
""
"o: i think this just replaced paulaner marzen as my favorite oktoberfestbier. cant remember if i have tried this before but i will definitely buy it again. recommended."
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a pleasant medium amber with a nice white head that holds and laces throughout the consumption. The aroma is of sweet malt, with a hint of fruit on the edges. The taste is straight up sweet malt from start to finish. Not much variety, but done very well. The feel is medium and a bit wet as expected. This is a great example of an Oktoberfest, if I could get it fresher it could go higher in rating."
""
"Overall, one of the better Oktoberfests out there. One I could easily drink several liters of."
""
"A prototypical Oktoberfest lager - big and malty, easy to gulp or sip (who am I kidding?), a nod given to actual balance, and a smidge of extra booze to sneakily keep the party going. Prost, prost indeed."
""
""
"Lighter side, solid easy drinking. A Marzen for the masses kind of thing. Pretty true to the German style though."
""
""
""
""
"330 ml bottle into pint glass, bottled 7/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear orange amber color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some good spotty lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of caramel, biscuit, toast, toffee, nuttiness, apple, molasses, and light herbal hops. Very nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, toffee, apple, nuttiness, molasses, and light herbal hops. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, bread, toffee, apple, and nuttiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice flavor balance with good complexity. No cloying sweetness at all; quite clean on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly slick and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. No alcohol warming noticed at all on the taste or finish. Overall this is a damn nice Oktoberfest. Very well balanced and very smooth to drink. I really have no complaints, very well done."
""
""
""
"Overall - What's that Sir-Mix-a-Lot song? I like big butts and I cannot lie? Yeah, the back end on this beauty makes this beer. Beautiful, complex, assertive finish. Probably my favorite Octoberfest brew to date."
""
""
"I really enjoyed the lingering malt flavor in the finish. I'm guessing it's Vienna malt based on the style - but can't quite pinpoint it.."
"The taste is crisp and bready. Lightly sweet, with herbal hops and a flavor reminiscent of apple. Caramel hides in the background. The dry, grainy malt really shines in this beer, complimented by a medium-light body and a lightly dry finish."
""
"Overall – Mostly a pretty good Octoberfest. It has a decent roasted and bready flavor and is quite easy drinking and refreshing. Not a bad choice."
""
"D: pretty classic example. heavy on the malt, great autumn beer. not any direct complaints (sans appearance), but there are some american samples that i prefer."
"O- There are only a few better than this example of the style."
""
""
""
"A sessionable beer that is the best Oktoberfest I've tried this year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Great Oktoberfest Beer, very drinkable"
""
""
""
"The beer is copper hued with an inch of thick, creamy head. The aroma offers malt, fairly sweet, a bit fruity. A nice drinkable seasonal brew. A bit of grain with a balance of fruity lager and a light bitterness in the finish. Light to medium in body with solid carbonation. Hooray beer!"
"A very quality German Oktoberfest for the season. Will suit you just fine cold or warmed up a little bit. One o'those beers that carry over from the dog days of summer right up to the snowy front stoop of wintry days."
""
""
"i know this a commercial beer but now when i go out to the brew pubs there is one type of non-american style beer i like. my son says next i'm going to try some summer-lemony beers. doesn't sound too a-peeling (pun intended)."
""
""
"Prost!"
""

"Read the EXCELLENT subsequent reviews of this beer..I can do not better then what has already been written."

"O: Year round oktoberfest?? fucking great. summer days feeling that marzen style is awesome. They are part of setting the style standard. Worth the try and to me worth a case a week."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. I think this is my favorite Oktoberfest."
""
"Overall: Slightly above average beer overall. There are far better Oktoberfest beers available."
""
""
"This one just doesn't do it for me. The flavor is overly bitter in my opinion for the style and the aftertaste is off-putting."
""
""
""
"This beer pours a beautiful, bold, deep gold color with one inch head and mild lacing. It's aroma is of bread crust, spices, and a hint of caramel. The flavor is a complex mix of ginger, bread crust, cinnamon, and caramel. There is a nice blend of sweet malt and hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is light-medium. Hacker-Pschorr Oktoberfest Marzen is a good beer, a good example of the style. Smooth and very drinkable. Highly recommended."
"This is a great beer that is beautiful in its simplicity, like a Japanese rock garden."
""
""
""
"Hacker-Pschorr Original Oktoberfest is a crystal clear amber lager with a thin white head that quickly fades to a film. It has a sweet, malty aroma, like bread and caramel. It's pretty light bodied, smooth and a little flat. The finish is a little watery and metallic. It has a faint taste of slightly sweet malt and a little melanoid. There's a touch of leafy bitterness at the finish. The aftertaste is grainy and bready. It's a beer. I don't know if I'd drink more than one of these, but I finished my pint with no problem."
""
"Medium carbonation on a medium-thin body, just the slightest stickiness and creaminess but generally pretty clean and refreshing. Light lingering bitterness in the finish. Very nice take on the style."
""
"An outstanding beer of its style and by far my favourite beer when I was at Oktoberfest in 2010. Drinkability is huge, which, let's face it, is the whole point of an Oktoberfest beer."

"Poured from a 330 ml bottle into a pint glass, best before 6/12. This pours an amber color with a short lived white head. The smells are full of malts, some toffee, nutty smells. The feel is medium to light. The taste is similar as it smells, fully of malts goodness."
""
"Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is oktoberfest at its best. Almost perfect for style. PS I was told Spaten is year round, so minus points for Spaten for screwing Oktobefest up."
""
""
"D - Overall very enjoyable. Sad I now have to wait a whole year to try it again!"
""
"Overall: one of the best Oktoberfests on the market. This is one that was recommended to me. Glad I caught it before the season was over. Can't wait for more next year. Would be heaven on draft."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I'd say this is like the average Oktoberfest.. nothing special about it."
"Dark orange-amber, a fluffy head, nice lacing. Smell is mostly just grain and sweetness, but the taste is much better--light malts, floral hops, exquisite balance and a dry, clean end with some lingering toasted flavor. Juicy in the mouth with good carbonation, this is a German lager done very right."

"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a smooth texture and a crisp finish. Overall, Hacker-Pschorr makes some of my favorite Bavarian beers but the Oktoberfest just doesn't stand out. It's a good beer but not my favorite for the style."
"O - This is my favorite oktoberfest to date. Now if I could just keep my wife out of them."
"Overall it was a fine marzen. But it probably does not rate as high with me as it does with other people."
"Like It? I Do"
"This bottle's drinking much better than the tap version I had previously. A pleasantly sweet Oktoberfest with just a touch of earthy hops in the finish. Whole grain bready malts, with some light toastiness. Medium body, perfect carbonation and finishes clean. Drinks easy. I'd absolutely get this again."
"Cheers!"
"Overall- It started out average, but the complete lack of any kind of malt character on the tongue ruins it a bit. The mouth feel doesn't help matters by being so watery either. I'm not opposed to saying there was something wrong with this bottle, but what I had, this ain't the O'fest you should bother with."
"O- It makes sense that these guys would know how to rock a killer marzen, and they definetly do."
"Sampled from a 330 ml. bottle on October 29, 2011. It pours a handsome light to medium amber witha head that is not as foamy as some and disappears quickly. The aroma has an abundance of sweet German malts and a yeast background. The body is about medium and smooth. Like the aroma, the malts take over the flavor with a pleasant sweetness but also a higher than expected bitterness. This brewery knows its Oktobefest styling."
"O: This is one of the Octoberfests that define the style for me. I'll continue to pop lots of these every season."
"O- Nice ""crisp"" Marzen, but still has a nice amount of flavor and complexity. Excellent session beer."
"Food match: You'll want something that coats the palate while drinking this brew, like an assortment of dips (Hommus and Baba ghanoush are always winners) and bread. Or you could mix it up with a Tapas or Meze platter."
"O: Top-notch Octoberfest/Marzen. Perfect fall evening libation sitting next to the fireplace. I’ll be back for more."
"Light with low-medium carbonation. A little more carbonation would really whip the camel's ass. Feels a little chewy. Came in an ""Oktoberfest pack"" with the aforementioned mug and pint bottles of Lowenbrau, Paulaner and Spaten oktoberfests, all Helles-style Oktoberfests rather than marzen-style. This is miles ahead of the other three, not that any of them were so bad, and a beer I can't get enough of right now. Lovely."
"O: Solid Octoberfest/Marzen. Probably one of my favorite in a style that I usually don't care much for."
"Medium bodied and fuller than expected for the style(read German example) with a nice balance of zesty spice and sweet malt.  Still it's very easy to put down.  Lots of sweet caramel, toffee and biscuit with hints of pepper, clove, nutmeg and brown sugar.  Complex and much better than I anticipated.  Sessionable as well.  "
"O: This was a good beer, but just a little too mild compared to the Sprecher, which I liked better."
"the best of the german oktoberfests in my opinion. pours a perfectly clear copper color with a picturesque white head. smells earthy and malty. big rich malt character on the palate with a big enough body to stand up to the season, but not so big as to limit drinkability. notes of caramel sweetness are present in the crisp finish. perfect with some grilled chicken and roasted squash."
"edit- I'm surprised to see this ranked as high as it is. I didn't find many flaws, but found this a bit bland. I'll likely revisit this in the future to see if I was off when tasting."
"It was a decent Oktoberfest, but not my favorite of the season. Sorry grandaddy, other labels hae passed you up."
"O - For me, this is one of those beers where you mourn seeing the bottom of the glass. I loved it and could really seeing kicking back a few liter-sized glass mugs of it in Munich! If only I had a big, chewy pretzel to go with it..."
"A highly drinkable, enjoyable Oktoberfest. Not overly complex, built for simple everyday drinking."
"Hacker Pschorr's Oktoberfest pours a golden clear in color with a very thin white head. The smell is common to most Marzens...malty with hints of sweetness. The taste is very similar to the nose....mostly malt flavor with slight sweetness. The mouthfeel is good...light bodied with a medium carbonation. Overall a decent oktoberfest. The flavor is very clean, refreshing, and simple."
"A very fine German Marzen. Better than most I've had - it certainly made the journey across the ocean in great shape."
"M, D- Light/medium, drinkable, proper CO2."
"Overall: An excellent Märzen! I never though I could finish a liter and wish I had more...guess I was wrong. This makes me glad that Americans really don't know when Oktoberfest ends ;)"
"12oz brown bottle purchased at Market Basket in Somersworth. Pours a crystal-clear amber with a good half-inch of off-white head. Caramel and toffee dominate with just enough herbal hops to balance the aroma. Caramel and toffee dominate the flavor too, with honey-like notes as well, and just enough herbal earthy hops to balance. On the heavier side of medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Fairly quaffable, though the robust complex flavors make this a bit more of a sipper than it might otherwise be, and after a couple of bottles I'd be done."
"Overall the maltiness and mild sweetness of this brew works so wonderfully together. No wonder they call it the original. This just so happens to be the first Oktoberfest I ever tasted many years ago and in my opinion still is one of the best."
"Barely decent & very disappointing. Just had another Octoberfest from an unmarked keg at a party, & it was very good. This is dull."
"o - decent beer, wouldn't seek it out but would go ""ooh, that's nice!"" if I saw it on a beer list."
"Overall a great Märzen that does not disappoint."
"Light to medium bodied with slightly below average carbonation. There is a slightly sweet aftertaste from the caramel malt. Overall I am glad I gave this Oktoberfest a try. A very nice beer."
"o - enjoyable and goes down easy. may be the best example of the style i have had yet this year. a very well built beer. recommended."
"A lovely example of the style with it's rich malt yet it finishes cleanly and rests lightly on the palate."
"Overall pleasant, though unremarkable."
"If this was available in six packs for a decent price I would rip through it. Really puts Little Creatures' version to shame, and cements my thoughts on that effort."
"I thought the beer was well-balanced. It has its own character that stands on its own. I think it's one of many good examples of this style. I particularly like Ayinger, but I think this one is pretty dang good."
"Somehow this O-Fest has eluded me for years. Not no more... It pours a clear tawny-amber topped by a finger of dusty cream foam. The nose comprises white bread, light caramel, light grass, and a very light touch of Belgian candi sugar. The taste follows this fairly closely, but the caramel is more pronounced, and a decent amount of mandarin orange finds its way in as well, providing a nice fruitiness to compliment the enhanced malt. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally smooth feel. Overall, a very solid O-Fest, one definitely worthy of that Bavarian flag emblazoned around the label."
"O- As for many german lagers, the overall grade is higher than the average. The beer is perfectly balanced, refreshing and extremely drinkable, and thanks to it's subtle complexity you never get tired of it"
"Overall: A very good Marzen. Pretty much everything you would expect from the style."
"O: I have had this beer for the last three years. I only realized recently that I had never reviewed it. September and fall are one of the best times of the year to be a beer drinker. Hacker-Pschorr's Oktoberfest delivers a beautiful color matched by nice mellow and balanced flavors. If you enjoy Oktoberfest and fall seasonal beers, try this."
"D- I really felt like i chewed this beer rather than drank it but it still retained its great lager cleanliness. Liquid doughy bread with a subtle toffee sweetness. Superb. This is far darker than the beer in the Hacker Festzelt at Oktoberfest though, wonder whats going on there??"
"Overall: An easy-drinking German brew, sure, though I found it to be a bit bland."
"Medium body, slightly higher carbonation, chewy and bubbly on the tongue. Drinks pretty nice, although it felt a little flat - I've definitely had some better Marzens."
"O- Yeah, at first I was into it, but the finish was offputting and at the end of it, I couldn't think of this as a great marzen. Kinda underwhelmed by it."
"O - A pretty nice oktoberfest. The flavor is very clean, refreshing, and simple."
"Overall, a very classy Oktoberfest."
"oktoberfest session during sunday football, into my mug pours an amber hue, big foamy ofrf white head, tons of retention. Malt, noble hop, and alchohol in the nose. Taste is similar, bends to the sweet side. YUM. drinkable and enjoyable, best Marzen I had today."
"Overall-Nothing to complain about just not perfect. Maybe a little more sweetness would help."
"O) This is always a solid choice when weighing out your Oktoberfest options. For me, it brings back fond memories of visiting Munich for Oktoberfest. I was in the Hacker Pschorr tent with a giant pretzel around my neck, singing Country Roads with my new drinking buddies from Italy and Austria. Good times..."
"Overall this is a pretty average Oktoberfest bier. I'm sure it's better fresh on tap in Munich."
"Overall- I really enjoyed the beer. Was exactly what I was looking for, for a traditional German Oktoberfest. Cheers!"
"Even though the appearance and smell had me leery, this is a very good beer, although the sweetness might catch up to me after a while. As a Yank, I probably wouldn't be able to have several of these while partying in a Bavarian beer hall."
"Firm enough carbonation and good mouthfeel. Really drinkable. Smooth, tasty, the whole nine yards. This is what the fall is all about."
"Overall pretty standard for a good German marzen. nice toasty malts, crisp lager flavors, no bad lager flavors, hint of hops on the finish. Nicely done."
"Pours a crystal clear dark amber/copper with a 2 inch puffy odd-white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Small spots of lace dot the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, and some citrus aromas. Taste is of sweet malt/grains, caramel, grape juice, and some citrus zest on the finish. A mild bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good marzen but nothing too special."
"D-Pretty easy drinking but I wish this had a little bit more of a malt backbone to it. The search for my ideal German Oktoberfest continues..."
"It's probably the least Oktoberfest Marzen I've had to date. Less malty, thin body and weak head and lacing hurts the credentials of this brew. it's decent, but you can do a lot better. Many great German Oktoberfest brews out there, this one is a little less."
"Overall, better than other german oktoberfests I've has thus far and it's pretty good."
"very good example of a style I tend to overlook. I figured I'd try an ""authentic"" German Oktoberfest this year. Definitely a step or two above most American examples."
"O - This is the nice Fest beer, Better than most American renditions I have sampled."
"O - I always look forward to this one. I like the Ayinger Oktoberest a bit more, but this is one of my favorites in the style."
"Hacker-Pschorr's Oktoberfest-Marzen is a very clear darker-amber colored beer, small white head which doesn't last too long. Nice amount of Vienna malt on the nose, fairly toasty and pretty sweet. Very rich scent. Ooh, here we go. Just a full on smattering of Vienna malts, nice and toasty, quite bready, a bit of caramel, nice and clean lagered taste. Hops are minimal but play a nice balance with their bitterness. Very nice and smooth mouth, pretty creamy and soft on the tongue."
"Just the right amount of smooth toasted maltiness for this style and a creamy, well-balanced palate. There's a nice subtle hoppy assertiveness and a hint of allspice on the finish. Silky-smooth and wonderfully drinkable. Recommended. Mehr, bitte!"
"Light acidity, with moderate carbonation. Just a classic example of the style."
"Decent color, but a little thin looking. Very full flavor with a tiny hint of sweetness. The aftertaste is hoppier but doesn't linger long. I could see drinking a good bit of it, and it's a solid beer but it doesn't do much do distinguish itself in my mind from other specimens I've had."
"Had on tap at the platt in franlin square at the umternational talkbass annual get together. Showed up in a mug, nice ruby chestnut color. Malty festive smell. Not the best smelling octoberfest, but not the worst. Great body and nice flavor, grape dominant. A little heavy, but very enjoyable. Overall very good."
"This one pours out as an amber color with a head that comes and goes leaving a decent lacing down the glass. The smell of the beer has a light sweetness to it along with some autumn aromas. The taste is decent, it's got some earthy spice flavors with a tiny bit of sweetness from the malts. The mouthfeel was medium or at least close to medium. Overall it's not a bad beer, I've had better though."
"A nice coppery color with a creamy white head that fades fast but leaves nice walls of lace. Teh smell is of caramels, honey, cereal, and some earthy, herbal, peppery notes. The taste follows the nose with rich caramel dominating. Notes of earthy hops, herbal and peppery hints, and some fruity qualities like apricot, peach, and a touch of lemon. A bit on the watery side, but nice rich caramel swirls balance things out. A nice balance between sweet caramel and peppery hops. Overall, easy to drink and enjoyable."
"A good beer definitely worth trying. A bit too malty for me but I'm just not in the Oktoberfest mood this time of year. Not one I would go looking for but if a friend had it in the fridge I definitely wouldn't say no."
"Taste, mild, smooth. No bitterness hopping evident, as to style pretty much. Bready at times despite the high clarity. Mild spice lingers at the back of the mouth. Caramel with light bread. Toasted bread. Slight metallic aftertaste."
"Poured bronzed amber with some carbonation, and a nice finger of white head that retains fairly well. Smooth malts hit your nose, with a touch of spice. Biscuity taste with caramel malts accompanying, nutty, earthy, with a tad of spice and a hint of hop bitterness. Medium body, smooth and very drinkable."
"D: Easy drinking Oktoberfest."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into dimpled mug. Pours a deep, clear copper with a dense, frothy, beige head that reduces to a thin cap of bubbles. The aroma is bready malt with caramel and fruity hops rounding out the nose. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium-bodied with a slick almost creamy mouthfeel that concludes in a clean, lightly dry finish. The flavor is of toasted bread, caramel and lightly fruity hops."
"D: Another top German tick, and it's on the list with good reason. I liked this one quite a lot and will make sure to pick some up each year."
"Happy to try it."
"First had this beer on Tap at Shoeless Joe's in Rosemont. An exceptionally smooth high quality beer poured in a 20 ounce glass. This time picked up two bottles and poured them into a 12 ounce beer glass. A thick head that takes a while to dissipate. It is a smooth drink that is excellent as a session beer."
"D: Very good beer...would love to go to Oktoberfest and drink many of these"
"D - Pretty simple. There really wasn't anything special about this beer. Pretty average run-of-the-mill wheat beer."
"D - Pretty drinkable brew, a lighter bodied brew over some of the octoberfest's I have had. A brew that I could drink more than one of. I recommend trying this brew if you like the style"
"12 oz bottle. Pours a dark amber with a big, off white, short lived head. Lively carbonation. The best quality of the beer is its nice aroma of caramel malts, perfume hops and some dough. The flavor is similar to aroma, but much weaker. Finish is short and unremarkable. The body is medium and crisp. OK Octoberfest but there are much better choices."
"D: Doesn't say, ""party in a glass," like a good o-fest should. All the elements are there, but it feels a bit stretched and less than robust. Letting it warm just a little brings out more flavor, but the beer also becomes rough and less drinkable. While there is nothing truly offensive about it, this one is just not going to get me dancin' the polka."
"Artful look: Huge, billowy, cottony and milk-foamy porcelain-hued head - blankets of lacing - in stark contrast to the deep, dark reddish-brown color below. The aroma is like no other O-Fest in the lot - fresh, clean spearmint/wintergreen mixed with some faintly toasty, crystal-sweet malt. Makes me think of alpine winter - snow-capped mountains, skiers in colorful wool hats, twinkling X-mas lights. The flavor is equally bizarre: toasted malt sweetness - nearly nougaty - with those refreshing minty/herbaceous qualities, a vaguely licorice (Mike N Ike) tone, finishing with powdered bubblegum first, developing quick into a malt liquor spice in the way after. The drinking is lovely smooth, ending dry. Quite a lot going on here - unique, to say the least."
"Not a bad beer at all, lots of flavor, but a little too sweet for repeated pints. As a stand-alone beer it makes a pretty decent example of the style, though."
"D: quite drinkable - almost the definition of sessionable: light enough to drink a few of, but a rich flavor profile makes it highly enjoyable."
"Beers are pure in style only in the eyes of their reviewers - unless they were brewed by Germans in which case they were likely copied to the letter out of the style rulebook. This Oktoberfest provides the basic, fundamental guidelines for the style and does well to showcase a proud tradition in German brewing heritage. Anybody looking to replicate or familiarize themselves with the style are advised to start here."
"Drinkable enough. however, at a recent beer tasting I hosted, the consensus put this one in at last among five other Oktoberfest styles (including Spaten, Ayinger, Great Lakes, Harpoon and Avery's Kaiser)."
"Poured into a pilsner glass. Color is a moderate brown-bronze with a good white head. Nose is toasted malt with some caramel and toffee plus a slight nutty character. Taste is toasted bread with a bit of caramel. Slightly sweet with just a touch of bitterness. Light-to-medium body with nice carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good and this is one of my more-preferred German marzens."
"D - This is the best Fest beer I have had for straight drinkability."
"Another pleasant Oktoberfest from Munich. Traditonal and pleasing."
"Have always been a fan of Hacker-Pschorr beers and this is no exception. Definitely the best of the big 4 Oktoberfest offerings. Must point out here that this is by far the one with the most strong and robust flavour - a couple of the others tend to be slightly weak-flavoured lagers."
"Good representation of the style. Must have if you like Oktoberfests or malty, yet light, beers."
"drinkability - really well done Marzen, I will seek this out next season"
"This is a tough category (Oktoberfest beers) and one that I really like, so it is average for the category but compared to beers generally this one ranks pretty high."
"drinkability: very pleasant to drink, all of the elements come together well, and for the style, it is mellow and consistent, making it quite drinkable. If it had a slightly higher abv, it would be exceptional."
"I can't believe I've never reviewed this beer. OK, into the malestorm. Pours copper-brown with a dense off-white head that leaves beautiful lacing. I really can't figure out how this could look better. The smell is slightly sour, slightly carmelly, with a touch of flowers and a slight metallic whiff. Taste is pleasantly mildly sour, balanced by an immediate slightly sweet maltiness. There is a slight sharpness to the finish that balances the rest out well. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and delightfully soft. Drinkability is just fantastic. This isn't so much a beer as a day-long project. Definitely my favorite Oktoberfest. Prost, baby, prost!"
"Drink- Could easily put back a few of these in a session. Good beer."
"*from notes"
"The mouth is moderately full. Good carbonation. Refreshingly wet. Excellent bounty of sweet malts and fresh bread. This beer nails the Festbier flavor dead on. Hints of caramel, toffee, and just a wisp of bitterness. I could drink this all day, or month for that matter. This'll be the one I stock my fridge with every autumn from here on out. Great beer."
"This is what a great oktoberfest beer should be. Balanced, smooth, easy to drink. It has a slight sweet aftertaste but not too sweet. The carmel is balanced by the hops. Get it fresh and serve around 45 degrees. At this temp the flavor is amazing. The malt comes forward. My personal favorite fest beer. I've found the german styles of these beers to be a bit lighter and easier to session vs. most of the craft brewed versions. I love them all but this one seems hit the mark. Bullseye. Enjoy!"
"D: A nice, traditional Oktoberfest; just about all you could ask for on a brisk late September evening"
"D: Very drinkable. Simple in flavor, compared to the Ayinger that has a similar ABV, but this goes down much easier."
"D: Not a bad ABV.. Pretty drinkable.... Very interesting Oktoberfest, not what I was expecting... I have to say not as good as I was expecting. Never the less it is a Germany Oktoberfest Marzen so it is worth a try."
"This is a very drinkable Marzen, and not nearly as filling as some of the others I have had. I could see having a couple liters of this along with some schnitzel or sausages and kraut. Not the most exciting of the style, but a good go to beer if you want a German brewed example."
"This is a very well balanced brew. It is full of flavor, but light in body."
"This truly a classic. I poured it into my mass krug and enjoyed it. The beer is a clear brown color with a thick off white head that stays with the beer. Just the right amount of carbonation. It smells like roasted munich malt and hallertau hops off the bat. It smells great. Next, I take a sip and it has a nice roasted flavor with bready notes and a drying hop backblast. I picture it like a thick crusty bread in a glass. The mouthfeel is sharp and drying yet thirstquenching all at the same time. It is very well balanced. Drinkability is simply phenominal. I wish I was in Munchen right now guzzling mass after mass of beer!"
" Obviously an authentic classic of the style which is very nice on it's own, with limited complexity but enjoyable to make it through a session."
"Just a plain, good Octoberfest. A great example of the style, and great for fall drinking."
"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable, great fall beer."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and I would definitely have another one of these because it is a good representation of the style."
"Here's a fiestbier to stick with!"
"To be honest I found this brew to have a slightly different taste that the others of this style I've had lately. It is somewhat sweeter than others that was almost candy like with very little noticeable hops. It has a medium-copper color with almost no carbonation producing an insignificant ring of fizz. It's very drinkable, it just isn't too sophisticated."
"D- A very good take on the style that is also quite memorable and reasonably priced."
"Beer is light in body with a mild caramel and a nice malt lead off. Mildly sweet and finishes clean with a nice silky mouth-feel and some great drinkability. This is probably the best Oktoberfest I've had so far, I generally like the beers Hacker makes, check out their hefe sometime. I am glad I have a 6 pack of this now."
"D - Low ABV not tiring, good session."
"Has a great drinkability."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and more than solid Marzen that shows how to focus on caramel without being cloying. US brewers - take note."
"3 12 oz bottles poured into a Paulaner dimpled liter mug, the way it should be hehe. Dark copper in color with a measly head. Caramel and toffee on the smell. Caramel, butter, honey with a touch of smokiness, no real bitterness. Awesome mouthfeel. Coats the mouth, carbonation seems just right. This is my 4th Oktoberfest this year and deffinately my favorite. The others being Sam Adams, Paulaner and Ayinger."
"D_Very. Perfect example of an Oktoberfest."
"Has little carbonation which I think adds to the smoothness of the beer. It has a nice smell of almost brown sugar with some grains and noble hops as well. The taste its very smooth with that brown sugar like malt and the nice sharp Noble hops in the back that really rounds out the beer as a whole. Probably one of the best Oktoberfests I've had this year. Its similar to the Samuel Adams Octoberfest but with just a bit more hops. Tastes a bit grainy but the sweetness and the hops really balance it all out very nicely."
"Little over a finger of cream white foam, more froth than density, gone quickly with close to nothing left across the surface, lacing slides off the glass sides as if greased. Remarkably clear, as if buffed into a high polish, the color of an older copper penny, more zinc at the glass bottom, there's a few loosely gathered bubbles inside. Dry, crisp nose of clove, ginger root, rye bread, barley, dried orange peels, offers more green leafiness than malty sweetness, pinch of apricot, apple, peach fruit, extremely understated and saying that may be an understatement. Light to medium-bodied, equally dry here with an energetic spring to its step, bready with baking spices, just not indulgently sweet. Orange and lemon citrus close to giving a mineral water feel, metallic at times. The carbonation has a good, tighter weave, keeps it off the tongue. Honey and molasses accents help it a good deal, substitute for clear malt flavors. Light apple, apricot, red cherry fruit. A very refreshing beer that, if you don't mind some sourness, is easily poundable."
"Drinkability: Certainly. Not bad for the session scale either tipping out at 5.8% and definitely one you can hammer out. This is a good example of the style."
"D: Usually I'm not a big fan of Oktoberfest beers, but this one is quite drinkable, I must say."
"Extremely drinkable, like a good märzen should be be. Unlike Ayinger, no alcohol or metallic taste detectable. Try this!"
"Pours a nice deep copper hue with a fat, creamy head that sticks to the sides of the glass. Clean malty sweet aroma...light bread and caramel with a dash of earthy/floral hops and a hint of tea. Rich, toasty German malt flavor. Spicy hops, honey, and the occasional metallic note. Biscuity all the way through. Nice smooth, medium-plus mouthfeel. Quality stuff!"
"This is a pretty good beer that I would probably try again."
"Drink-ability = A+, very smooth, would go great with a bratwurst"
"Drinkability: I found this to be one of the more drinkable O-fest beers I've tried and I enjoyed sipping it right to the end as each sip followed naturally from the earlier one. I'll certainly be having this one again."
"This beer might just be too excellant for its own good and purpose. Best enjoyed sober, which is not often the case at Oktoberfest..."
"D-very, there is no taste that is bad or annoying, i could have a lot of this."
"Has an initial grab of toasted malt with mild sweetness and is finished off by a substantial (for the style) amount of dried grass hops. Mouthfeel is a touch thin and is pretty high on carbonation. Pretty drinkable, a six-pack of this has disappeared pretty quick from my fridge. I still think Paulaner is my favorite German marzen, though this and Spaten are mighty tasty as well."
"Bought a few bottles to try out before buying a case.. Pours rust color not a heavy beer at all.. Quick disappearing head that leaves slight film on glass. Beer is rather light with nice taste not as much caramel flavor as Sam Adams but really good flavor.. Will buy this for sure next year along with Sams.. Still waiting for Victory Festbier"
"D- similar to paulaner in my opinion. this one bounces back and forth from dry to sweet and back again. not so heavy body and flavor helps this one be a thirst quencher even at nearly 6% abv."
"D: multiple liters could easily be drank. flavor are just enough to taste good and not be overwhelming to make for easy drinking."
"d 4.5-5 doesn't blow my socks off in any one area, but it's pleasant all around and is the only oktoberfest of the year so far that i'd really want to quaff in the giant mugs, despite the 5.8%."
"D: A very easy going beer, but flavor is not full enough to make it the top leader in the style."
"This darker amber Oktoberfest pours and smells great. It goes down quite smoothly and leaves a mild after taste. A very good beer for the price and a good way to kick off October."
"D - Moderate drinkability. A little bit cloying and sweet, a hair strong. ABV is manageable."
"a bready apple as it should be. bright but aged quality. mature malt. the proper look of absolutely clear and like amber jewlery. nose of spple and pollen... a tad floral and brisk on the palate that works against the breadiness and makes this a lean but complex marzen."
"It poured a copper color with a nice white head. It has a very strong malt smell and flavor. It was a lot sweeter than I was expecting. There was a little bit of the alcohol coming through at the end. It had a nice creamy mouthfeel. One I would drink again if they were to make it again."
"Taste profile has both maltiness and a bit of toastiness present. The malt doesn't seem to be carmelized as I'd expect, but the toastiness is very welcome. Finish is pretty uneventful....very mild hoppiness and a little sweetness left over. Very drinkable brew and another reason why I love Oktoberfest beers."
"body is medium light for the style, and not as creamy as some, but with the soft carbonation I believe it adds to the impressive drinkability. There are few O-fests I want a second, third, fourth...bottle of in one sitting. This is one of them."
"This beer pours out a clear, light, amber, with just a slight white head. It smells crisp with a little yeast scent coming through. The main flavor I taste in this beer is malt, and also some faint coriander and citrus, very refreshing. This beer is very smooth and goes down easy, and excellent session beer."
"D - Could do a few of these around a table with or without food."
"The body was full and solid, perhaps slightly sticky. Drinkability was excellent, I would happily pour large mugs of this to wash down some sausage and cheese."
"D: Very drinkable Oktoberfest. It is not cloying at all and the beer really rolls around the tongue nicely. Wonderful balance with the focus on the Malt profile. All around a very good beer, they hit the mark on this one"
"Another German Masterpiece. Pours to an amber color with a decent one-finger head that is a little thick. Aroma is very hoppy, with a bit of caramel, marzipan seems to be there in the background. Very smooth caramel flavor with a slight alcoholic-ness. There is a nutty character in the background. Mouthfeel is a little heavy, it coats the inside of the mouth. It is quite decent really."
"D: Excellent. Exactly the type of beer I imagine consuming several times while celebrating the occasion. Would go back to this reliable standby any time."
"Drinkability: The crisp start with a smooth creamy end makes this one brew I keep coming back to. The 5.8% ABV is not very noticeable, and I'm dismayed I have only two left in the fridge."
"I know I'm a young'un, and I haven't even tried plenty of STYLES of beer, but right now I could drink this and only this the rest of my life and be very happy."
"A warmth, depth, and richness just exude from this beer, very, very drinkable indeed."
"Pleasant beer. Rather easy to drink and quite enjoyable."
"D - I really enjoyed this and went back for a few when I was at Walt Disney World for the day. I enjoyed having this, and although I do like Sam Adams, this might be my choice for my Oktoberfest beer from now on."
"Drinkability: Not a bad Oktoberfest. Has a good taste to it, and a nice appearance in the glass. The only real con to this brew would be the thin, slightly watery body. Aside from that, this is a top notch Oktoberfest that I wouldn't turn down if offered."
"A classic rep of the style all around... Between this and Paulaner, the Oktoberfest style is well represented..."
"Slightly warming at the end but melds well with the rest of the experience. Perfect for fall weahter, just puts me in that doom and gloom mindset. This is my imported Oktoberfest of choice."
"Very drinkable classic representation of the style."
"Pours a clear dark brown with glints of red on the edges, with a small white head. Smells of burnt toast with apple butter, a big maltiness with earthen aromas. Tastes is big on the toasty malts, rounded out with minerally finish. One of the better marzens that I've tried."
"Haven't had this one for a while, but I'm glad I bought it again. This is even better than I remember. Very nice overall. Fans of the style will enjoy this."
"Very good Oktoberfestbier, I could imagine myself drinking a couple more of those (unfortunately I brought only 1 bottle with me from Germany)."
"Not my favorite style, but this one of the better ones I've tried. As with many German beers I think this is another one that's best left to the Germans. The American versions haven't really inspired me so far."
"High quality oktoberfest thats super easy to drink."
"Overall this is a great version of an Oktoberfest beer, That I could kill several pints of easily. I will gladly buy this one again."
"d- good drinkability, i could have a few of these, the tartness was unexpected but i didn't hate it."
"D - Highly quaffable. Nice flavor without any heaviness."
"D - For the style this is about as good as it gets. I could have a few of these in a sitting on a fall night."
"D - Very drinkable. Not cloyingly sweet by any means and just has a great Marzen taste."
"(D)- A fine oktoberfest, however it is rather sweet. Good malts, but overly sweetened. I also think that this particular bottle was not 100% fresh or ok, I remember this being much better than this; will re-review when I get a fresher one."
"Drinkability? I could drink this nonstop 'til dark matter is depicted mathematically."
"Mouthfeel is fine but fails to leap out at me. I do think the light body brings the beer together more, as it is insanely drinkable. I could have many mugs of this, which is why the Germans made this beer for this time of year. The mug had a short life, and washed down the pub grub very easily."
"For an Oktoberfest, this isn't bad, in fact its one of the few I call drinkable. Color is dark clear with a white head. Smell is sweet like apple bread. Taste is spicy and grainy. Mouthfeel is kind of light. Drinkability howerver I'd say is quite good as I'm in the middle of my second one tonight."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a dark, clear copper with a very respectable white head. The aroma is grainy and reminds me a bit of a sweet bread. The flavor is balanced between a malty/bready sweetness rounded out by a pleasant bitterness. The beer is well rounded, sessionable, and one of my favorite O-Fest brews."
"Smooth mouthfeel and highly drinkable, very good octoberfest indeed!"
"The mouthfeel and drinkability are pleasing. In all, this beer depicts the style and is thirst quenching."
"D: A delicious, authentic German Oktoberfest. Great balance with a polished flavor profile. Drinkability is quite high as a result. Very good."
"Overall it is a solid Oktoberfest, and like all examples of the style it has it's strengths and weaknesses."
"I could, have, and will continue drinking this all night long. Next thing I truly want to see is an imperial oktoberfest!!"
"An ok beer. It has a very nice spicy taste to it that you come to expect from Oktoberfests. The real difference here is the drinkability...which is off the charts. It's not very beery like i would have expected. The Oktoberfest spices are there, but it's sweeter and not so ""beery"". The malty hop tastes don't really show up. A very strange taste. The color is the usual orange/brown and the smell is subtle spices but lacks the usual beer smells. Great drink, ok beer."
"The taste is ok, just sweet throughout. This okt fest is the budligt of marzens, sadly, nothing special here. Moutfeel bad but you can crush it."
"Drink this is a very drinkable beer I am getting more as long as it is around."
"D - A very well refined brew this is. I absolutely love every part of it. And since its a favorite style, It's a home-run for my taste buds! Complex enough to pick it apart and try to figure out what your tasting, but drinkable enough to be a session brew. This is a MUST try in the style. I'll have another, please!"
"I probably could and probably will say this about any authentic Oktoberfest. Not much variation within this category. All have been good and pretty drinkable, which makes sense given what it was made for originally. This is no different."
"Deep amber in color closely bordering brown. Smells a little fruity with a slight molasses and nutty aroma. Maybe a little like pumpernickel. Taste has a small malt sweetness to it but not overwhelming. There is some spicy hop flavor in the middle. The finish is nutty and toasted grain. Mouthfeel is a bit lighter then I thought it would be. But that is ok. I will definitely go back to this."
"Drinkability is high, very light and refreshing."
"D = Drinks okay, but not so much that I want to keep drinking to much."
"This is probably my least favorite oktoberfest I have tried this year. It is tasty but perhaps a little too malty for my palette. However, I did see that this beer was bottled a year ago. This rating may not be a valid evaluation of what this beer should be. I am disappointed that a small liquor store in Clarksville, Indiana that is known for carrying a wide range of quality products would sale this. I am also disappointed in myself for not seeing the freshness before purchasing."
"Just enough carbonation to keep this from being a chugger. I found it to be on the filling side, but maybe it's just the huge hoagie I plowed beforehand."
"bought a mixed six pack of marzens and this one is just ok its not bad it pours a little darker then the rest the smell is burnt malts and hops some bready malts a little funky its ok ....maybe i had to many of the style lately but it still ok and recommended for fall but not one i will buy in 6 pak of"
"Overall- this is one unique oktoberfest. maybe i'm just use to the american style of them. if you haven't tried this one i say give it a try."
"Pours a clear, reddish amber with zero head. Smells of toasted malt. Taste is malty, a hint of saltiness, and diaycetal. Finish is slightly vinegary and bitter. Mouthfeel is average, low carbonation. Pretty drinkable, though there are better examples out there."
"D- high. Of course it's high, this beer is served in massive tankards, it needs to be quaffable, and it is."
"Smooth feel with a slightly dry finish."
"I could drink this all day, and not just in the fall. It begins with an inviting dark amber appearance with a decent head that sticks around for the ride to the bottom of the glass. The smell is loaded with caramel; a tad hoppy but nicely fruity. The hops aren't evident in the taste until the very end: the malt carries a soft sweetness and then there's the bite (also from the carbonation) from the hops that settles into a fruit basket that has endless amounts of orange and cherries. If only there were vitamin C in this, you could have it for breakfast. Easily one of the better Oktoberfests I've had."
"Definitely a fine example of the style, recommended."
"This is probably my favorite Oktoberfest beer ever! i can't wait for it to come out every year then I drink the hell out of it. Gives off aromas of bavarian hops and carmal malts. This is how Oktoberfest beers should taste the barley and hops are very well balanced that take you to a crisp dry finish."
"D -- Oh yeah. While not great on an end-of-summer day, you know this will be the type of beer to reach for when the days start to shorten into fall and winter."
"Just a note, I got my bottle in Europe which I'm not sure if it makes a difference for this octoberfest, but it certainly does for Paulaner's. Very good beer."
"This is probably my first Marzen/Octoberfest beer and its decent, nothing special to go out of the way to get it again. I will probably get me one and save it for when thanksgiving comes around. I would love to pair this with pumpkin pie."
"This is Biergarten in a glass"
"Pours a very nice auburn with darker hues and cloudier areas towards the center. Foamy head settles quickly. Not much aroma to pick out.. a slight pale malt character if you smell it directly from the bottle but theres not much from the glass. Flavors are a mild, typical marzen with a pale malt backbone and a very slight hop presence in the end finishing it. Slightly butterscotch-ish/caramel-like character . These qualities are all fairly moderate-to-light though, and you have to look a bit for them. The mouth is on the lighter side of full-bodied with carbonation that isn't too assertive. Very drinkable, you could easily have several of these without being weighed down or such. Could probably go well with many foods, also."
"Pours a clear, amber/orange color. 1/3 inch head of a pale tan color. Decent retention and poor lacing. Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, and yeast. Fits the style of a Marzen / Oktoberfest. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, yeast cleanliness, slight grass, and hints of roasted malt in the finish. Overall, a smooth a drinkable beer. The sweetness level is not too high either. It does seem to rely too heavily on the yeast and lacks hop."
"Poured into a dimpled mug, this marzen appears a clear deep copper color with about an inch of lingering off white foam. Smells and tastes of medium toasted bready grains, sweet malt, nice caramelized flavor, a tad fruity, mostly apples. A notch better than medium bodied and amply carbonated. Worth your time."
"Drinkabilty- if anything its one downside to me is its still a bit overally sweet at points thought its overall enjoyable, this is definitely one i look forward to trying again next fall, as it seem to have a nice rich flavor and beautiful mouthfeel, 3.5"
"Poured into pint glasss, golden amber color with a light head. Smells of strong malt and some caramel. Initially slightly bitter taste, hops very apparent then balanced by a mellow malty with a lingering hoppy finish. Very smooth and drinkable, one of the more pleasant of this type that I've had. Definitely one to keep around."
"D - Very drinkable for such a thick, rich beer. The malt character is excellent, especially in the aroma. The flavor is a bit weaker, but still nice."
"Drinkability: A good Oktoberfest, but not my favorite (that would probably be Paulaner)."
"D-Not very impressive but a session beer indeed."
"Pours a auburn ruby red with frothy head and lacing. A mellow, sweet malt smell with touches of hops. Thin-bodied and passing smoothly over the tongue, caramel malt along with other sweetness pass over and there are minor hops notes that balance the beer and allow it to finish with a little prick on the back of the tongue. A rather simple but enjoyable beer and it is nice to have an Oktoberfest outside of October."
"D: What appears as a weak flat beer is in fact a think overly malsted Oktobefests, too much sugar and groggy malts. A weak Marzen I won't try again."
"(2.7/5)"
"D: A nice drink by itself but comes off overbearing sweet at times thus limiting multiples in true octoberfest style."
"M/D - I find this one to be very drinkable, definitely something i'll search out in the future. One of the better versions of this style i have had."
"Drinkability: Awesome. This is quite a drinkable beer. It is very millktoast, but is well crafted. I will revisit."
"Smells malty, cereal. Doughy, yeasty. Pours beatiful reddish brown with a thick creamy head. Cloudy with normal carbonation. Tastes fabulous, light and sweet with a strong bready, woody, yeasty taste. Superb example of what a marzen should be. Easily the best I've ever had."
"Drinkablity: This is a very tasty Oktoberfest. This will remain one of my favorite easily assessable examples of the style."
"Apparently this IS the beer sold in North America. After having this, I hope the stuff they kept for Germany is better. Gold pour, big white head, lots of malt and mustiness in the aroma. Good, clean taste of sweet malt and sugary caramel. Decent, but these marzens keep getting weaker and weaker."
"M&D: surprisingly soft as well as refreshing on the carbonation, while the body is really light but holds well until the very end. Based on my limited experience with Märzen bier, I find this one a particularly drinkable example which is not too sweet and preserves a subtle but important element of hops and hop bitterness. Very decent overall."
"Overall: I was extremely pleased on how the beer tasted I was a pleasure to drink. Enjoyed this beer very much"
"A fantastic traditional Marzen! I loved the huge malt flavor while still being light enough to drink multiples of. I'm not the biggest bock like beers, but this is great."
"Pours a clear amber-orange-brown with dense two finger offwhite head which fades to a thin layer in a few minutes but leaves lacing all the way down the glass. Smell: toasted grain, munich malts, caramel sweetness, hints of grassy/herbal hops. Taste: malts upfront, toasted, toffee, slight caramel flavor, biscuity, also present are grassy, herbal, tea-like hops. Mouthfeel: crisp upfront with a smooth middle and slightly dry, clean finish. Extraordinarily drinkable. Great ofest, one of my favorites."
"Probably my favorite import O-Fest, this packs some tasty flavors with a crisp body and HUGE drinkibility. Great for the style and one that I look forward to every fall."
"Drinkability: is very high..this is a great Ofest beer"
"There's a reason (or two) why Hacker-Pschorr's Octoberfest is so popular, and it's not due to a slick marketing campaign. This is, simply, one of the standard-bearers for the Octoberfest/Marzen style. Period."
"A moderate malty nut aroma, toasted and a little sour. Appearance is nice, golden brown with an average off-white head with quickly diminished almost completely, small bubbles. A slightly sweet, slightly bitter taste that has something I don't like. Average palate, a little watery."
"Pretty good Oktoberfest but much different than many of the others. It was very tasty and I would recommend it."
"D= A very good traditional example of the style and one I would surely drink again!"
"Jk"
"This is a super drinkable Oktoberfest! Put one of these in my hand and you are a true friend, indeed. Nipping at Paulaner's heels. Both are great."
"Overall, one of the better Oktoberfests I've had. Highly recommended."
"Lone sixer left on the shelves, marked down priced to sell. I felt bad for the little sixer and what I went there for was gone so I picked up figuring what the heck one last Oktoberfest for the season. Sweet bready light aroma with some loose change metallic scent. Wonderful initial pour medium bronze with a HUGE head that ultimately settles to very thin, some lacing remains on the rim. Easy on the gullet and rather drinkable, aftertaste is mellow. Flavor is grainy, grassy and dang there's that metallic hint. Almost like a nickel was dropped in the glass. It's an alright marzen, would be much better without the metallic hints, according to the bottle it's only about 5 months old so it should still be fresh, just think it's got a touch of the euro-transferitis."
"Note - The 2009 is every bit as good as the 2009 if not better... So so tasty..."
"Carbonation cuts into the chewiness of this one, and makes it very drinkable. Good stuff all around. Hadn't tried this in ages. So glad I bought a 6 pack."
"It was great. It had xceptional drinkability. I could sit back and sip on this and enjoy it all night or pound it down in a frat boy like drinking fest."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden brown/amber color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some sticky lacing. The nose is malty, with some spices. The taste is sweet, malty, with some spice. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a nice brew."
"D: A good session beer. Very balanced beer, a great Oktoberfest."
"pours a med. copper color w/ a thick white head which dissipates quickly leaving a moderate lace in my pilsn glass ; smell is nutty caramel w/ some hints of raison and baking bread ; taste is a well balanced blend of toasty cereal grains and some grassy hop bitterness w/ more caramels and nuts midway, a faint metallic note in the finish ; dry and light bodied w/ decent co2 ; an excellent drinker, one of the finest 'fests around..."
"Served at Hessen Haus, Des Moines"
"In the glass this is a bright, super clear red copper with a thin head and a bit of lace. The smell is all caramel malts with a bit of toast and grain and just a touch of spicy noble hop. The taste is smooth maltiness, fairly full but not sweet and not too dry either enough hop bitterness and aroma in the taste to keep the malt from being the only thing going on, great balance. Great smoothness and surprising complexity in this lager it's not too heavy nor too light and the carbonation is at a low enough level to keep things lively without making anything taste too harsh. A great drinking highly sessionable oktoberfest this is a beer that you can pull out the liter mug for very good stuff."
"Whadda beer!! Pours a semi-dark amber color with a somewhat nice frothy head (doesnt last too long) Even carbonation throughout (figure that one out). Aroma is sweet malty/toffee heaven goodness. Taste is sweet but not over powering, taste of malt/toffee with a little hop (a little). At first, I thought this beer was a medium body, but it was too easy to drink, but yet, I needed more of it. Very easy to drink. Great beer!!"
"Very drinkable, the bolder flavor profile doesn't detract from drinking this at all and I could easily see drinking a liter stein (or more) of this! Much better than the Spaten I tried."
"Notes: Picked this up on a whim and it was not much of a surprise that it was an outstanding beer.Very drinkable."
"Palate is well balanced, rather grainy, spice, slight bitterness rounds it out to make it a very easy drinker, in contrast to other german lagers I've had. Superb feel. Highly recommended."
"D: Not one of my all time favorite Octoberfests but this one is definetley worth checking out. Easy to drink, not too heavy for what it's worth. A good example how why Germany crafts such good Marzens. If you find this one in your package store, grab it."
"BEERFLY THIS AS JPH's"
"I enjoy it more than the few Oktoberfests that I've had, but I'm still not a convert. I imagine it is better in the brewery's tent in Munich with a few thousand friendly revelers. At home, it's a bit boring, ultimately. I strongly prefer it to the Sam Adams entry that I last reviewed in this style."
"Nice beer to drink one after another and another. I feel it fits perfectly in the style. Fun beer."
"The taste is light caramelly bread, mineral, and leaves with a hint of alcoholic warmth and a light leraf-caramel-bread finish. It is mostly lightly sweet with a lively zestiness and only a very light leafy-mineral bitterness near the end to somewhat balance the overall sweetness and help keep it interesting. One drawback to me is that although the flavours and overall character are nice, it seems to ride on a somewhat thin, minerally body. It is very drinkable, though."
"Went on an Octoberfest binge the last time at the store and picked up a few of the German originals such as this one. I was pretty disappointed to be honest. Had barely any taste or good flavor to it, didn't look too appealing in the glass, and was just boring/bland overall. I wish it made more of an impression on me but it was just lackluster."
"Finding this one in my little town came as a surprise! It's a Munich original Oktoberfest so it probably deserves 5's across the board wouldn't you say? Nah, it's good but not as good as there other beers, which I really enjoy. I was amazed that there was zero head retention or lacing. I should research my style, maybe it's suppose to be that way? Long story short, it tastes good."
"This poured a clear dark copper with a bit of off-white head. It smelled like earthy barley malt, blended with some molasses and caramel malts, and a bit of copper hops. It tasted like a wide variety of malts including nutty, caramel, and roasted barley, as well as a bit of copper hops. It was watery with some carbonation, and had a brief bitter aftertaste. Overall this had a very clean and tasty flavor. It was quite refreshing and easy to drink. Very nice!"
"mouthfeel is bitter, saaz hops? easy drinking, light with a great amount of flavor"
"D: Great example of the style. Moderate strength makes this a good session brew."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, not too heavy and is a great Oktoberfest beer."
"Ich bin ein Oktoberfestian."
"D: I expected more. Perhaps after my tour of the Octoberfest, it is not that amazing or versatile."
"A lager bite, with a bit of biscuit hints and toasty notes come through on the nose, it's pretty mellow, like most Oktoberfest beers, a sweetness eventually creep out as well. The colour is a dark amber, and a small head that dissipates rather quickly. It looks pretty though. Initially I tasted a great sweet flavour followed by a bit of biscuit flavours; as expected, the lager bit is at the end, but it's pretty subtle. The mouth feel is quite crisp and dry from the carbonation, but less watery than I expected from an O-fest beer. This is the most drinkable Ofest I had yet, and probably my favourite!"
"Pours with a reddish/copper color. Not much in the way of head retention but possibly a detergent ""clean"" glass is the culprit. Malt dominated taste (do I detect Munich?) with a pleasant lager, dry finish. A well-rounded example of the style, if only the weather was more fall like..."
"D: This one wins my BotO. This is insanely drinkable"
"D- a good choice, a great fest beer, though still not my top"
"This and Paulaner are my favorites so far, in an admittedly limited sample size of mostly German Marzens."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: As I've already mentioned it feels a bit light on the palate, sure the body is medium but there is just a watery type quality to it that cheapens it for me. I would like a bit more body here, but I guess this'll suffice. This is one that I look forward to drinking the rest of, nice O-fest in my opinion. As far as my opinion goes this is one of the better imported O-fests I've drank. GLBC and Moerlein O-fests are great, and this is right up there with them. Give it a shot, you'll not be disappointed."
"D: Very drinkable beer."
"D: Super drinkable. I love this time of year and beers like this are one reason. Just make sure to get them in season."
"A very good German Oktoberfest biere, and one which might get overlooked as a nice, sessionable fall lager. I look forward to having this one again in the crisp, cool days heading through the fall season."
"D - it doesn't get much better than this."
"M + D: Fairly crisp, lighter body... refreshing and smooth finish. An easy drinker, perhaps not extraordinary, but solid."
"D: Pleasant enough, but nothing special."
"D- I could put these down all night. I love this ofest and its the first one that I have felt this way about. I will seek this out again and its readily available."
"D: One of the best marzen's from the German collection -- of the darker variation which I enjoy better than the lighter version (see Spaten and Hofbrau)."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Curiously fruity compared to other examples of the style I've had, but it works. This isn't an estery Belgian or anything; rather, it's got a clean, malty flavor up front with a bit of date and raisin to support it. The texture is pleasingly light and crisp, and the finish is perfectly dry. Lots of flavor on display here for the moderate ABV, and drinkability is through the roof."
"Of the 5 beers I had at the fest I would have said I liked this one the least. Wouldn't have another."
" German wine and German song! :|"
"Nice creamy mouthfeel and the balance make this a very easy to drink beer. What I expect in an Octoberfest."
"Not one of the best O-fest's I've had, but drinkable."
"Overall, Hacker-Pschorr Oktoberfest is a really solid brew. After having two supbar domestic O-Fests earlier in the day, this brew really stands out as one of the better examples of the style."
"12oz. bottle served in my SA Sensory pint. 05/08 printed on the label. Poured a translucent copper with a quarter inch loose, off-white head the quickly dissipated; remnants coalesced around the shoulders and also coagulated in the center of the glass. Nose was caramel, malt, grains and a toasted/nutty aroma. Taste consistent with nose, with the caramel coming forth a little bolder. Some slight hops bittering detectable towards the back. Mouthfeel is between light and medium with a balanced level of carbonation throughout the mouth. Nice marzen. Not my favorite style, but this is a solid example of what an Oktoberfest beer should be. Prost!"
"Light to medium body, with a fair amount of carbonation. Very easy to drink. Very enjoyable. This just screams Oktoberfest to me. Very good."
"nice oktoberfest."
"D- This is another good O-fest beer. Very drinkable and good. Nothing particularly special but I was happy to finally try an O-fest made in Germany."
"The body of this was a little heavy, it had the carbonation to make up for it in the mouthfeel but I could not see myself drinking a lot of this. While this tasted slightly better than my usual Spaten Oktoberfest, if given a choice between the two I would choose Spaten for it's lighter body."
"Not my first choice for a Marzen, but I did enjoy it."
"D - Not bad for a Oktoberfest, but not awesome."
"D. Drinkability is sky high. Smooth, crisp and clean. This beer is easy to drink. It tastes great with a lot of flavor. Next time I will definitely drink more than one."
"Transparent, lager-y look, and smell. Slight spice in the nose, nothing crazy. Sort of bored by this. Weird background taste, sweet up front. Not my favorite Marzen around, and I enjoy the style in general."
"D - This is a very nice o-fest. A nice sweet flavor with a good balance of hops."
"D- 5.8% is a touch high, but, what the hell, it's oktoberfest. Drink up!"
"This is a tasty, quaffable brew but nowhere near as remarkable as their Hefe Weisse."
"Drinkability: I'm glad I got to try this, as I bought a 12-pack in excitement for the upcoming fall, and I'm glad I did. I had it out of the bottle and it seems to be less tasty, oddly, in the glass. Maybe, again, it's the glass, I'm not sure. But you really can't go wrong with a brew from the masters, especially one I've yet to see in Richmond (I think) until now, even though it's seemingly pretty popular."
"I like the hops in this beer. Easier for me to drink than the heavier, malty Oktoberfests."
"MF&D - Crisp and easy drinking. An enjoyable session beer."
"D. For 3 bucks on tap you can't really beat it. Its pretty good stuff too, one of the better O-fests Ive come accross."
"Pours deep orange with a light, sticky off white head that quickly blends back into the beer but retains an obvious viscosity. No visible lacing. The color is maybe a little darker and a little less vibrant than I like my Oktoberfests but still very good. The aroma is like mellow, unsweetened cornbread. Medium mouthfeel. I like it heavy and Munich saturated and this is a little less extreme. The taste is, like most other aspects of the beer, malty and moderate. Well balanced Munich, Pils, and Vienna.. well maybe unbalanced towards the Pils side. It's like a Pils painted Oktoberfest colors. Interesting hop profile working with the sweetness- just enough bitterness to create a little play between the two. My only issue is that I like my Oktoberfests thick and malty like you're swimming in a mash tun filled with Munich malt in Bamberg and this takes it a little easy. Unfortunately, Oktoberfests are like my heroin- I had a Sam Adams Oktoberfest a couple years ago and it blew my mind. Now it sort of tastes like a lot of the rest and I can't recreate that experience so it looks like I'm doomed to chase the Oktoberfest dragon for eternity."
"I'm not very impressed. Oktoberfest's aren't really my favorite style, and this doesn't have alot going for it. I would much prefer a true marzen or vienna-style lager over this, and I recall Ayinger having a very solid offering in this cateogry. Then again, maybe it needs to be drunk in mass quantities in order to bolster it's appeal:)"
"Somewhat cloudy dark orange body with golden highlights supports two fingers of the slightest tan head that disappears in a flash; no lacing, either. The nose has a hazelnut and caramel malt aroma that is nice but should be stronger. Delicious taste, full of caramel and a hint of chocolate, with a fine nutty finish. Smooth and good, I was concerned that the beer would be too soda-like after the foamy pour, but the carbonation was more restrained while never flat. Eminently drinkable, this is a Marzen I would consider somewhat inferior to Samuel Adams's version. However, this is still solid, delicious, and a fine representative of the style. Certainly worth a try."
"Mouthfeel is full and rich without being too thick. Almost metallic finish."
"D: High...this beer is very refreshing and light enough to drink many of these. I think it makes a great session beer"
"I didn't like it as much as the Paulaner Oktoberfest though. It was very similar.. great malt taste, very smooth, not too heavy but it had some spices and hops that I didn't care for. Left a slight awkward aftertaste from the hops. Easy to drink and I could of had another. I recommend it, but try the Paulaner too."
"I can see why, and how, thousands of people drink thousands of liters of this beer every year in Bavaria. A true mark of a few hundred years of ""German Engineering""."
"Recommended"
"Coppery orange amber with a nice creamy head with good lace.Caramel and a fresh pumpernickel bread aroma is nice.Tasty toffee and roasted malt lead to a faint herbal bitter dark chocolate finish.Medium bodied and highly drinkable.This is a fine beer any time of the year."
"Drinkability is spot on. While it is a bit pricy, it doesn't compare to how rewarding this is. One of the best beers I've ever had, hands down!"
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Small head on a dark amber body. Smells and tastes were sweet, and subtle, caramel being the most noticeable. Even the hop bitterness was subtle. Nothing overpowering in this, just everything nicely balanced, and the feel very smooth. Not typically a fan of Oktober's, but this is a good beer."
"Drinkability: I really liked everything abouit this beer and will look forward to the next one."
"Pours a beautiful orange-red color with a white head, fairly carbonated. This was bottled 6 months ago but held up fairly well. Smells a little pilsnery, crisp clean mineral water and noble hops. The flavor shines though, I think I must love vienna malt grain (is that what's in here) silky smooth, some vanilla, bready... awesome. I figure the hop presence has been subdued to just a minerally flavor and feel because of the time it took from bottling to pouring. But I just love oktoberfest beers. Suggested. Prior to drinking this paulaner oktoberfest was my favorite and abita amber is noteworthy. This is just a tad to minerally but I love the malts in this brew."
"pours a crisp clean amber from a 12oz bottle to my Rogue dead guy ale pint glass. smells munich malty with some other malts going on. nice faint hop smell too . smells very balanced. like caramel apples. taste is nice sweet malt, very malty sweet grain followed my a mellow hop bitter that lets the flavor stay a bit longer. very nice Oktoberfest, possibly one of the best. perfect mouthfeel and drinkability. excellent...reminds me of Christmas time... my favorite time of year!"
"D-Excellant. I really like this Ocktoberfest Marzen. This will definately go on the favorite list. Boy will I look for this on Tap next fall."
"The definition of a true German Oktoberfest, I raise my stein and cheer! Enjoyed this one chilled in my favorite Warsteiner mug. Poured a crystal clear copper/amber with a beautiful white head and a fine lacing. Smell like a Marzen should, foward caramel malts with subdued but pleasent spicy hops. Taste is well balanced without the malt madness of some other Americanized Marzens. Crisp with complex flavor dominated by caramel malts and a touch of floral and spicy hoppiness. Makes me wish I could afford tickets to Germany!!"
"Malty and with a very clean profile for a beer where the malts are dominant. A pretty impressive example of brewing."
"This is only the 2nd time I've had this brew.. I am happy I was still able to find it in town."
"overall, this is a good brew but i dont think ill get it again"
"Drinkability- It is a great beer to knock back and have a great time with."
"D- Pretty easy to drink. I am just not sure I could have more thank 23oz. That taffy got to me after a while. An interesting one to try though."
"I guess I could have a couple"
"You would do yourself a favor to have this beer anytime of the year, but especially in September to get into the Oktoberfest spirit. Ein Prosit!"
"12 oz. glass bottle- color of light amber, with a thick white colored head - nose of sweet malts, blueberries, slight earthiness, and bananas taste of sweet maltyness, and fruity- body is medium, and with medium to high carbonation  aftertaste of sweet malts, some fruit, and lingering"
"Drinkability - A very nice celebratory Octoberfest offering. Holds up nicely in my pantheon of Octoberfests. Near the top. I will be looking for this one next year as well."
"I like it, but only one or two at a sitting (not a bad thing, I guess). But I'll have something better next September at my annual party."
"Overall: I need to go to Germany I think. I have been trying this style for the better part of a decade now every year and I still just don't get it, and by it I mean why people like this style so much. I am not sure if I just need a more fresh sample or what, but almost every one I have had of any brand has disappointed me. Typically the body is too thin, and overall its too cloyingly sweet. Boo."
"Definitely not the best Ofest of the year, but I will seek out again next year."
"D: Actually, one of the highlights of this beer. Everything else about it is above average but not outstanding or overpowering, which makes it all the easier to drink a bunch of these."
"This is about a typical Octoberfest as you'll find. It starts as an amber with some head, practically no lacing, some retention but not much. The smell is subdued and that's too bad given the beers other fine qualities. In the smell I'm getting some sweet malts, some caramel, some lager smells, and others which are too subdued to make them out, perhaps a whiff of tobacco. The taste is all malt, moderate carbonation, moderate dryness. You'll get hints of caramel, cherry, and bready yeasts. The mouthfeel is light and watery, the consistency is on the light to medium bodied side, more light than anything. The aftertaste is mild. This is a nice caramel malty Octoberfest if there ever was one. If you like the style, you can't go wrong here. It brings me back to Munich in late September."
"D: Delicious & easy to drink. An excellent session beer."
"Opinion: This is a really good beer and has a wonderfully malty balance the whole way through. A lot of Oktoberfest beers fall short of this all out onslaught on the palate with Munich malt. This beer has malt in spades and I would certainly drink this beer again."
"This is one heck of a session beer. The abv is a bit high for that title, but damn this beer is easy to drink and tasty. It's a nice amber-red with a bit of head and lacing. The aroma and taste are a simple, but delicious mix of mellow roasted malt and caramel with a touch of hops. The carbonation is a bit light, but that doesn't take away from anything and allows for great drinkability. Yummy."
"this was a solid but not fabulous o-fest. copper/amber in color with beatiful clarity and a minimal creamy white diminishing head. subtle aromas of caramel malts and nutty notes in the nose along with a hint of alcohol and vegetal hops. taste is dominated by the malt character as per style with the hops playing a background role. the sweet malt dries out quickly on the finish. creamy mouthfeel and very drinkable."
"This beer pours a clear bronze color with amber hues. The head is large, fluffy and white. It recedes into nice thick lacing. The aroma is of biscuity malt with a mild floral hint. The taste is of like the aroma. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a very nice Oktoberfest. It is lighter than most American versions I have had, but it is makes up for it with its exceptional sessionability."
"This beer is pretty drinkable. Paired with the right food, this beer would sing. If you see it, try it."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. This beer was a nice amber color much as one would expect an Octoberfest beer to be. The head was decent but nothing to get crazy over, it was tan. The smell was sweet and yeasty. The tase iof this beer was also a little sweet but vety good and it was a tad spicy. I liked it and will buy again."
"This beer pours out a nice deep amber color with a medium off white head. I love the smell. I detect carmel, malt, and a yeast presence. Somewhat earthy but in a good way. It tastes like a delicious Märzen beer that would be enjoyed under an Oktoberfest tent only cold because it was in my fridge as opposed to being scooped from a trough by a Popeye-forearmed fräulein. The taste and smell almost have a Werther Original butterscotch hard candy element. Not too heavy and not too thin. Just about right. Perfect carbonation. Very good beer."
"Mouthfeel is a bit sticky and cloying, and the texture just isn't there for me. Still, drinkable for a Marzen and would go down just fine by the half-gallon, thanks."
"D: It is a creamy silky smooth brew with a low ABV and sweet profile that make it easy to consume long into the night."
"This beer ranks in the upper end of oktoberfest beers that I've had this year. Good flavors, good smell, good over all."
"D: Very good. Goes down pretty quickly."
"Overall, I was nicely surprised by this brew. Very drinkable. Well balanced and quite enjoyable."
"D'ability - aside from the carbonation, a nice run of the mill malty brew. The heavy carbonation really drops its drinkability for me."
"Very easy to drink. Could down these all day. Nice example of the style."
"Thierry (13/10/2007)."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, not too filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, I could drink a few of them, but there are other O-fests that I would choose first."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- For this true session beer, the mouthfeel was excellent... alive and modest. The bar was packed tonight... but rather than belly up to the bar itself I elected to cozy up to a small round table, beer in hand, and listen to a band play German folk songs. Time went quickly, and moments later I was driving home with my new favorite glass."
"Not a bad oktoberfest, but not my favorite either. I'm not wild about the husky sort of grain flavor, and that affects the drinkability for me. I would choose other oktoberfests if I had the choice, but wouldn't pass one up if I didn't."
"Drinkability - one of the better OFests I've had and will likely grab more."
"This has a good amber color. Pretty good lacing. The smell seemed a bit weak to me. Thought I should have smelled a bit more malt. Taste was good. Tradition Oktoberfest. Sweet, and malty, but with very good balance in the finish. Mouthfeel seems right for an Oktoberfest. Drinkability is very good. Overall this is a good Oktoberfest, one that I will look for every year, when it comes available."
"D: A great marzen to drink, tradtional and different from the many pale marzens on the market today, this one and Paulaner are on the top of my list for world-class marzens, top 2 definitely."
"Overall- I feel this is a great example of the style. It's easy to drink a number of these in a sitting. I picked up a case and it's been one of my ""go-to"" beers of the early fall."
"Pours orange amber from the bottle, with white head, thick at first, but dissipates over the course of the glass. This beer is all about malt smell and aroma. Excellent. It is sweet up front with a crisp finish. Its sweetness might feel cloying after multiple bottles, though. I love it, but one seems like enough."
"An excellent choice for watching FC Bayern Munich get a win in Munich during the Fest."
"Pours an orange-ish / copper color with an off -white head. Aromas that are fruity and just a tad bit earthy. In the taste, a smooth small dry fruitiness and a bit earthy again. A smooth malty mouthfeel, with a dry fruity aftertaste. A bit more fruit than expected in an Oktoberfest, but a nice dy end as well."
"Hacker-Pschorr Oktoberfest-Marzen pours an orange color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is toasted malt with caramel being noticeable. The flavor is much the same, toasted malt and caramel notes standing out the most. This is a pretty good beer, but just seemed a bit lacking in comparison to some of the other Oktoberfest beers I've tried."
"Drinkability: Very nice tasting beer and has the German edge over the American counterparts with a slightly stronger hops flavor. I liked this one a lot."
"Fantastic, this beer IS the reason I love fall."
"Comes out of the bottle a good dark, but trasnsparent brown, excellent head that stays the whole time. Smell like malty and puts me in the mood for fall and a trip back to Germany. The taste is as good as it gets. Good malty taste with the right amount of carbonation that makes this go down very good and sometimes too fast. This is a very good beer for the ultimate session. I am sure this is better closer to Germany, but I will make do. I know there are better Octoberfests out there, but this should be the standard to which they are compared."
"Just superb. Would love to be able to drink the draft version of this all the time."
"D- Very very drinkable as you would hope from a ""fest"" beer."
"D- Definitely one of the top Oktoberfest biers in my book. These brews are brewed to be consumed in generous quantities (hence the lower ABV), and this one takes the boat"
"I had this on tap at CK Diggs in Rochester MI. The beer was crystal clear and dark orange colored, thin head of foam. The aroma was predominantly malty, toasty and sweet. The flavor was toasted malts and some caramel. A little bitterness in the after-taste is the only hint of the hops. Very easy to drink, an extremely tasty malt-bomb."
"Pours a crystal clear burnt orange color with an off white head that was pretty substantial for a couple minutes before it settled into a thin foamy cap. The smell is classic light toasted malt. The taste starts with sharp malt flavor, not sweet, but sharp and toasty, which fades into a sweetness at the end. The mouthfeel is good, light, carbonated to the right level."
"By far the best Octoberfest I have had, perfect for the season and eminently drinkable."
"A clear copper color with no head to speak of and no lacing present on this pour from a new local restaurant (Sophie's in Watertown, CT). I have to assume that this was unfortunately a flat batch which I tried to consider in my grading. None the less, it had a modest aroma that nicely combined a mild maltiness with a sharper grassy quality. This beer felt a bit dead, but there was a fine carbonation present to give it some life and it worked well with the spicey wheat and malt notes that came through. Very easy to drink but again, this one was probably just flat so it seemed a bit watery. Had some decent touches in the flavor so I would like to try it again under better circumstances."
"I decided on the eve of the German Beerfest here is Boston that I would compare the top two Oktoberfest beers, in my mind: Hacker-Pschorr Original Oktoberfest and Paulaner Oktoberfest-Marzen. I tried the H-P version first. It has a clear, amber color with a small head. The aroma is very sweet, malty, and carmelized smell. It tastes very full-bodied and rich. The mouthfeel is very nice and smooth with the drinkibility to last alll day....what it was brewed to do. The Paulaner version is very similar in appearance, with a slightly larger head, and also in aroma, but a slightly stronger smell. The taste is much the same, along with the mouthfeel and drinkibility. As far as I can see, you can't go wrong with either one!!!"
"Another very nice, authentic Märzen. This is among the better ones."
"Drinkability is above average. Not my favorite Marzen / Oktoberfest beer, but it's fairly tasty, and light enough to be sessionable."
"Quite the tasty Marzen. Makes my eagerness for my passport to arrive in the mail, to come sooner, so I can get to Oktoberfest."
"One of the best Maerzens out there. Pours a clean, bright, deep amber with a sticky longlasting head. A very malty aroma floats from the glass. This a a big-malty Bavarian beer -as a sweet malty taste dominates throughout. Yet, this a very smooth lager with no cloying in the aftertaste. The finish is surprisingly dry and smooth. If you are looking for a classic Munich Lager, then this is it."
"A good session brew - can see why Hacker Pschorr is one of only six brewers that are allowed to serve at Munichs Oktoberfest. Hacker Pschorr is my favorite Oktoberfest to date."
"Overall, this is a tasty brew if you like the Oktoberfest style. Goes great with football by the way. Highly drinkable."
"Drinkability - Excellent. I could take these down all day long. One of the better Oktoberfests out there imho. Great indeed. Very refreshing and clean."
"This was poured into a pint glass. The head was a nice carbonated fluff, but that left as quickly as it rose. The color is a deep amber with a clear, clean body. The aroma is sweet caramel and slight toffee/roasted barley. The taste is big malty sweet. The caramel and roasted tones show through completely. There is a little hop bitterness in the back, but this is a malt brew. The body is full and smooth, a great lager quality. This is one that I could have on hand through the fall season. I think this is a good example of Marzen, IMO."
"One of the best Oktoberfests I've tried. Tends to the sweet, malty side a bit more than others. An excellent beer!"
"Super drinkable, this is a great end of summer session brew. To me it's one of the benchmarks for the style."
"The first of my Oktoberfest beers for the year, expect alot more of these reviews as I fullt intend to try everyone that I can find this year. Poured a deep amber color which actually suprised me a bit, thought it would be lighter. No real head after the initial two inch pour foam. Nice side glass lace and ample carbonation coming up. Smell wa alot of grain, nothing really special just alot of cereal grains. Taste was light, lots of malts, with great carbonation made for a nice profile, very drinkable as most Mazen are. Could have drank this one all night. So overall I would have to say this was a damn fine Oktoberfest anda decent way to start my fall season. I look forward to alot more ofthem in the coming months."
"Pours a clear copper color with an average tan head, plenty of carbonation bubbles racing to the top. The smell is bready, noble hops, very similar to their Munchen Helles. The taste is of caramel malt, doughy munich malt, and noble hops. Could use a touch more caramel/toasted malt to balance out the sweety doughy malt. Tastes too similar to their helles. The feel is moderately bodied, well carbonated yet smooth. A good German Oktoberfest offering, always enjoyable."
"D - A very drinkable amber fest that is a great representation of the style."
"Another fine O-fest. I wonder which will be my favorite this season?"
"This is a nice beer, and managed to age fairly well, not that i would recommend cellaring it or anything. A very approachable and somewhat sessionable style. Malt complexity gets in the way of it cleanliness, but the other characteristics of this brew make for a refreshing lager. Will have to find a few fresh bottles this fall to take head to head with NGs staghorn, which has been a favorite of mine since stumbling across it. Still an enjoyable brew after sitting on my cupboard for far too long, one that ill enjoy again someday as well."
"A very drinkable brew and an Oktoberfest must. Great to pair with BBQ of any kind, but obviously brats or steaks would make the best mathc."
"This is my first Oktoberfest brew, so bear with me. Had this on-tap at Cloverleaf. It poured a nice, amber color with a minimal amount of head with ok retention that slowed to a decent lacing, but was gone by the finish. The smell was nice and malty. The taste again was malty with a nice, sweet honey mix and aftertaste. The mouthfeel was full-bodied and pretty solid. The beer, overall, was nice and drinkable. Smooth, easy-going, good mouthfeel, and great taste made for a very enjoyable brew."
"I drank it on one of our hottest days this June and it came off as very drinkable, very refreshing."
"The best thing about this beer is the nose... it is very inviting to me. I'll be searching this one out next year for sure. One of the best ""major"" Oktoberfests I've tried."
"I gave this 3.5 across the board. It poured the amber/copper color with white head, about a fingers worth. Smelled of caramel. Tasted like a toasty latte without the coffee... How much sense does that make? It had some sweet to it and some bitter. I liked it though, I just can't explain it fully. I will drink this again, kind of surprised that it's affiliated in any way to Heinekin. It's really good compared to the green skunk heiny."
"D: Not as high as most O-fests, and this is actually one of my favorite beer styles. Too much of a stange off flavor going on that just doesn't do it for me. I remember having this on tap having the same tastes as well. Not a horrible beer by any means, but there are a lot better O-Fests brews out there."
"Drinkability: Nice, but a little rich."
"This Oktoberfest pours brilliant copper into my pint glass, much like the color of copper piping. The thin white head diminished into a thin skim after a few sips. The aroma of the beer is rather sweet and malty with some bready notes and hints of spicyness from toasted grain. The taste is sweet, yet there is a solid hop bitterness that provides good balance, very well done. The carbonation is moderate, medium bodied, and quite smooth. Overall I enjoyed this Oktoberfest very much. For the style I feel this beer is perfectly balanced. I also enjoyed its smoothness, a solid example of the style, highly recommended."
"The drinkability is good, a solid Marzen. Too long and far in between, Thank you and Prosit, MK"
"On tap at Chaucers Pub in London, Ontario. Pours deep gold, with a 2 finger white foam. Awesome retention. This head lasts and lasts. Mild grass/hay with subtle malts. Very mildly hopped and slightly perfumey. Tastes are right in line with the aroma. Soft malt spine with mild grassy/hoppy flavours and a spalsh of rose petals. Very soft and subtle, very sessionable, very drinkable. Once you can learn to appreciate the subtlities in this one, it all opens up. Thanks for getting this one in Milos!"
"12 oz. bottle, with 07.06 on the label - brewed in Munich. It pours a caramel/bronze with high carbonation and two fingers of biege head. The aroma smells toasted with caramel and pale malts - mild but good. It tastes lightly sweet with the same malt profile and spicy/grassy/skunky/piney hops that leave a mild bitterness. The body is medium to light, smooth and almost creamy, with medium to high carbonation that settles too quickly. A good session beer that I drank way too fast - always good to have an authentic märzen."
"Found this mid-November at Woolich Arms in Guelph. Floral aroma. Good Creamy middle plus mouthfeel, white head followed by abundant lace..toasty. Distinct bitterness comes through at end of subtle malting. A very good lager.Easy drinking is the key to this."
"Pours a light shade of orange-brown, with a hazed clarity. Creamy, off-white head of two and a half fingers holds very well leaving sticky patches of lacing. Dextrinous nose, full of Munich malts, wheat, and noble hops. The taste begins sweet with pale malt, wheat and toasty Munich malts, then ends with a faint Pilsener sharpness. Drying aftertaste presents a mild but balanced hallertau hop flavor and bitterness. Mouthfeel is dextrinous from specialty grain and wheat, but not cloying or residual. Soft carbonation and medium body are rather creamy and inviting. Finishes with traces of wheat and munich malt and a lingering hallertau acidity. A true-to-form Marzen with remarable drinkabiltiy."
"I could drink a lot of this so I will rate it high on the drinkability scale."
"Very easy drinkabailty. Nice and refreshing. Good session beer."
"My first choice for a new Oktoberfest brew this year- poured golden into the mug with an enticing aroma; almost berry-like with some malt in the background. The berry-malt was the first to hit my tongue followed by a pleasant dry hop finish. Very well balanced flavors with a clean refreshing finish; so clean that the higher alcohol content just sneaks up with no real warning- worthy of any Oktoberfest celebration."
"Light amber color with great clarity. The head is a nice 1/2 inch but drops quickly. Appears to be weak on carbonation. The aroma has some light caramel notes but mostly a strong flavor like corn or unfermented malt which detracts some. The taste is free of this DMS flavor though, and is pleasantly toasty/bready with a light bitterness. The alcohol isn't noticible, good for almost 6% ABV. Overall this beer was very drinkable The only thing that I didn't like was the aroma, but regardless I could still have a few of these..."
"The 2007 version is apparantly 6%. It seemed even closer to the export style (well-attenuated, less malty & dry)."
"Drinkability-- I need only say that this keg was tapped and gone in record time for any of our six fests in 3 years. Uninitiated first-time guests who showed up carrying packs of Bud or Bud Light abandoned their bring-along's and jumped on the keg, instead-- and also left their bring-along's for the trash."
"Pours a clear, dark amber with an initially frothy head that melts to a ring pretty quickly. Aromas are very worty, kind of like the smell you get when you walk into a brewery. On the palate, big carbonation, less rich in the flavor department. Bracing bitterness up front, then softening to something a little bit sweeter, but still a bit watery and metallic, not soft like some other examples of the style. Still not as snappy and bitter as many American Oktoberfests (see this year's Brooklyn Oktoberfest). Overall, a very good, flavorful Oktoberfest that is rich compared to many, but not as ""Marzen style"" as other examples, and not as much as I like."
"Hacker-pschorr Original Oktoberfest was amber in color with an off-white head. The head had decent retention and left a little lacing behind. The aroma was a good mix of malts. The taste was malty, but not sweet. Good balance of malt and hops with a fairly dry finish. It was medium in body and carbonation. Drinkability was very good. This is a very good oktoberfest."
"certainly not the worst."
"D: Overall, to have one of these again would be feasible, but not for flavor. Tasted a bit too bland for my tastes, even for a straight-up malty Marzen."
"Poured caramel into glass, bright and clear, with think creamy off white head. Semll promised sweet toffee and malt. Taste, less sweet than others (and smell), bready and malty with signature german ending (a little dry nutty, fruity). Good body and quite drinkable."
"The beer was incredibly drinkable and easy going down... until I noticed the whiskey thing (I have negative flavor-associations with whiskey), but that's a personal issue and I wouldn't take off points from it, plus no other reviewers seemed to have mentioned it, so it could just be this particular batch. Hopefully I can get past that issue, because before I noticed it, I found this to be one of the best of the Octoberfest beers that I had sampled."
"Overall a very drinkable Oktoberfest. Clean and crisp. A nice alternative to its to sweet counterparts."
"It's quite possible it's because of this particular bottle's age, but it is an OK but not at all exciting version of the style. It will do, but I'll go after others first. I'd love to try it fresh and see how it does."
"A very tastey beer,a little on the filling side,could only drink a couple of these.An Octoberfest worth a try."
"All is very mild and clean fermented, without leaving any signature of the yeast. In the end the husky taste is back, but does not disturb me. Mouthfeel is a little too sweet and drinkability is good."
"It's a pleasant, fairly tasty example of a classic style. It's like a worn, comfy sofa that you know will deliver the good feeling, despite its lack of flash or panache. It goes down smooth and easy, and it's a breeze to imagine draining a krug or two of this. I might not think to request it, but I'd never say no if offered."
"Served in a creme colored ceramc mug. When I got it from the waitress there was no head and no lacing. Not a sign that there ever was a head! Smell was of hops and that was all. Taste was very bland, some lemon. I could taste less than I could smell. Overly carbonated with no taste. I hope it was just a bad pour and I believe it had some to do with the pour."
"Pours a very nice gold/amber. Nice white head, with good retention and lacing. Smell is of fruit, carmel,and malt. Body is medium and carbonated.Taste is smooth,and sweet at the start, with a little hops in th finish.Good balance. I recommemnd this beer."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle which had a bottled date of June 2006. It poured a typical oktoberfest color, dark orange/gold. Nice head that lasted. Lacing left along the glass as it emptied. It had a malty, honey smell (again typical). Medium bodied. Highly drinkable with a very smooth flavor, which makes it stand out from a lot of other oktoberfest. One of my favorites."
"Drinkability - this is good, and very sessionable. A little less fizzy would be nice, but this is good beer nonetheless."
"This is not a true Oktoberfest marzen as it is too light in taste, color and body....to be truthful, this is a heavier maltier version of H-S edelhell...a sort of golden Munich lager...and although it is a good lager it is still not an Oktoberfest marzen in character."
"Slainte!"
"Hacker-Pschorr Octoberfest produces a traditional Octoberfest batch with it's rich cherry amber color and fruity malty aroma. The head dissipates in a smooth quiet manner. A flower smoked malt mouthfeel is smooth and everlasting. This is a very drinkable selection that can leave you requiring a few more before the night is over."
"Nice golden orange color with a decent head that lingers, at least for a while. Smells and tastes well balanced, nothing overwhelming here, and all leading to the smoothest finish I've found yet for this style. Very drinkable and ranks as the best Oktoberfest I've tried."
"D: There's nothing about this beer to impair drinkability, except the 5.8% ABV will catch up with you."
"Ahhhh, my favorite time of the year... Why? Marzen beer of course. The Hacker-Pschorr is one of my absolute favorite Marzens. Well make that my favorite with the Paulaner coming in a close second. It is the perfect Marzen... Malty as can be!!! The hops are there, but barely noticable. It has a really nice body and it is very easy to drink. It may have a bit much alcohol for a session beer, but it makes a damn fine fall session beer IMHO."
"D - I could see myself drinking a few of these provided there weren't any Paulaners around... Not a bad showing for this style, however. I think the Americans may be edging out the Germans for this year's best Oktoberfests, Paulaner notwithstanding."
"This beer is from one of the original Munich breweries, so one would think it would be as authentic as any of the style. I had posted on the beer forum that American Octoberfests are now better than their German counterparts, and, for me, this is exhibit A. The color is the most pleasant thing about this beer. It pours a beautiful clear coppery amber color. There is a small white head that vanishes quickly and no lacing on the glass. One notices a slight grassy smell that is echoed in the taste, along with a mild caramel flavor. The mouthfeel is watery and thin. I suppose that, if one is to drink liter mugs, something along the line of this is preferable to a richer beer, but I prefer a smaller serving of something I would actually enjoy. This is a bit of a disappointment."
"It's wonderfully smooth and the flavors hang on without being overwhelming, making this a great oktoberfest ""session"" and a great brew to have at an Oktoberfest party. Every autumn I stack up on this. One of the best (if not the best) of the style!"
"Drinkability is just better than average. This is a good beer but not a great beer. It is just too sweet."
"Orange brown, copper color. Lots of malt aromas in the nose; toffee, honey smoked malts, oranges, buttery, tea. The taste is sharp and full of spice. Full flavored hops, floral, herbal. Toasted barley malt, buttery toffee. Yeasty grain tones in the finish. Medium body with a terrific mouth feel that coats nicely and with a little carbonation to accompany. All around very excellent beer with a lot of depth and character combined with an excellent balance. I will be looking foreward to the next!"
"good drinkability, easy finish a couple glasses before you know it,"
"Drinkability: recommended in the spirit of Oktoberfest...if it was available year round, i'd recommend it as an everyday libation."
"D- a nice drinking beer, If I were in germany right now, I would be drinking it out of a 2 liter stien, dancing, being gregarious, and most likely drunk, this is the first oktoberfest I've had besides sam adams, and this one totally blows it out of the water, from now on I will be looking forward to this time year alot more"
"Upon further review, I will say this is an above average Marzen. Very kindly priced, too. Smell, slightly metallic..no lacing on glass, but most marzens don't. Nice caramel and burnt orange taste in the flavor. Very drinkable and a medium to light bodied brew. A good one."
"overall, a very solid Octoberfest, very easy to drink and would be enjoyable in a party setting. Definitely one i look forward to every autumn."
"Pours a clear copper color with a creamy off white head which it retains quite well. Aroma is mostly carmel like malts with a faint roastiness. The taste is carmel like malt, the roastiness is evident in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium with lots of carbonation. This is very drinkable, I could easily down several of these. This is my favorite Marzen so far this year."
"The body is light but not watery. The flavor is noticeable but questionable if that is a good thing or bad. Overall, pass."
"Nice clear gold color when poured. Not much of a head remained but had enough traces of thin lacing. Almost near perfect mouthfeel. Might be a touch too carbonated which takes away from its creamy texture. Nice slight hop and heavy malt aroma. Finish is dry and bitter. I find these to be very drinkable. Sweet light malt taste. Overall very good."
"Cheers!"
"Not the absolute best O-fest out there, but one of them. If there was a line-up of the best offerings, it would be in the top 5 I'd guess."
"D: A very drinkable Oktoberfest , true to the style. The finish is on the sweeter side of the ones iv'e tried after the hops. A great beer that goes down super easy throughout the night. Love the images of fall and october this beer brings to my mind."
"Wish I could have this in Munich -- I'm sure it's much better there."
"Drinks okay, too much out of style to reccomend as an oktoberfest,more like a amber to me. Still worth a try."
"This beer is great for what it is, a German Oktoberfest pasteurized and sold in America. Perfection would be Munchen in September."
"I got this on-top in a ceramic mug I purchased at the festival for $15 (ouch). The beer was excellent, particulary with a Bavarian Bratwurst. I couldn't see it very well in my opaque mug, but the smell was fresh, as many German beers are. Touted as the original Oktoberfest, it was my favorite of the three Hacker-Pschorr beers I sampled at the festival."
"Overall: Not as impressive as the earlier HP Munich Edelhell, but not a bad effort. However, I think that there are many better Oktoberfests out there though (like Spaten and Paulaner) for the same money, so I dont think that I would pick this one up again. Not bad but nothing special."
"I guess its an 'as-expected' Oktoberfest. One of my favorite German styles of beer. Easy to drink with lots of character. A rich caramel color with firm and solid head retention and soft carbonation. Smells very nice with bready / toasty richness and a medium caramel / malt aroma. Tastes much the same with a viscosity that confirms the bready / yeasty characters. Sweetness is consistant and firm along with a light estery / fruity flavor that was not present in the nose. Hopped for a good balance that still weighs on the malt side. Medium and full in the mouth with a growing bread and caramel flavor and feel. Finishes with more bready / yeasty than sweet, with an increasingly bitter-bitey feel late. Great with a hearty German dinner."
"This is very enjoyable for an Oktoberfest. I think it's a good example of the style. However, even though I can enjoy the style, Marzen/Oktobfest usually tends to be bit sweet for my individual taste."
"VERY DRINKABLE (i only give a 4.5 for drinkability in this category when its very)"
"(B'ham UK, while in Tampa FL May 2006)"
"Well crafted beer. It is no surprise this beer is around ""since 1417."" Very drinkable and makes me want to move to Munich (well, maybe not move, but definitely start booking my tickets for Oktoberfest)."
"I want to enjoy this beer, but the lack of any hop character at all turns me off."
"2005 edition: Fiery red/cooper with a nice dishwasher water coloured head of foam. Aromas are all German malts, with only a *slight* twinge of hop activity in the background. The taste is malty as all hell, bean-like and over the top with malt for an o-fest, but nice and good. The hops shiver in the background barely noticed. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, drinkability is good. This is a solid o-fest choice. Hat's off."
"D- Not terrible or tough to consume, but with so many other great beers, this will not be on my list again."
"Verdict- Excellent brew."
"A good pint, though the flat beginning and lingering aftertaste make the next sip necessary to clean up the palate some. Good lunch complement, after a few I'd move to something with big hops to freshen the palate."
"D - Since it's one of the better Oktoberfest's I've had, it's very easily drinkable for me. I thought it had a very refreshing quality to it."
"Beer is medium-light to medium in body, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a slightly foamy (1/3) and smooth (2/3) mouthfeel that manages to come across as pleasantly crisp. Closes dry with substantial stickiness coating the palate and lips."
"Overall: An excellent Oktoberfest beer."
"Hmmm....don't want to review a bad bottle, and after reading other reviews I think I might be drinking one that's too old, but this honestly does not have an expired taste to it. I dunno."
"I really enjoyed this beer. Great appearance. Clear pure amber color, nice head that dissipated quckly but covered the glass and left some lacing. Good smell. Very good taste. Nicely balanced, light but with good flavor with no unpleasant aftertaste. Drinkability is exceptional, very flavorful, leaves you wanting more than one!!! This is a good beer to accompany food, to slowly enjoy or as a session beer. Easily the best of the four Marzens I have tried."
"Pint at Zeno's. This beer has an amber color with a medium sized head and nice lacing. Smell is lots of sweet malt. Taste is dominated by sweet malt with some caramel complexities. There is also just a bit of hops which add some bitterness. Mouthfeel is great- smooth and creamy. Definitely drinkable and a very nice oktoberfest."
"Hacker-Pschorr Oktoberfest is a classic straight from Oktoberfest in Germany. It pours a deep mahogany and smells sweet with a subtle spiciness. The taste, however, is pure honey. The sweetness dominates, and even the subtle floral flavor of the hops makes one think of the clover in clover honey. Theres a mild presence of bitter, earthy tannins (like those in red wine and black tea) that helps to balance the sweetness. Altogether, a great example of what this style should be."
"Pours a lovely amber color, minimal head and lacing. Aroma is lakcing, but a slight hint of carmel/crystal malts. Taste is malty with a slight hint of hops in the background. Mouthfeel is okay, a touch thin though. This is a quaffable beer though, so I have to give it props for that."
"This beer has major game, as it should, and easily fits in the list of Oktoberfests one should consider to be standards for measuring all other beers in the style. Drink it (with great ease) and be merry."
"Nice and easy to drink. A solid example of the style, just not extraordinary. No problems drinking a few of these."
"The taste was a balance of roasted malts and mild hops. This is a great beer that gets even better as it warms up a couple degrees."
"Drinkability: Very refreshing and easy to drink"
"This one pours a transparent copper color with very little head retention. The nose is malty, very commonplace for any marzen. The taste is good. I'm impressed with its excellently balanced flavor, not too sweet or syrupy. There is plenty of flavor without going overboard and it finishes dry and clean. Not that its thin or anything, the mouthfeel is a little more subtle than other oktoberfests I've tried. The drinkability is great. This is quite a nice beer to look forward to on a fall afternoon."
"On tap at Schnitzels in Bellefonte, PA with a huge plate of kickass German food. Pours a medium copper with a small, white, foamy head that quickly diminishes to a very thin film, and leaves only a light, stringy lacing. The aroma is malt-dominant, of course, with sweet caramel, molasses and doughy bread aromas, but theres a nice mild hop aroma as well which adds an herbal and floral complexity to it. The taste follows suit by being nicely balanced. Too often, beers of this style become all about the malt with the hops staying too hidden, but this beer allows the hop presence to be known just enough to create the balance. A small, spicy zing leads you into to a wonderful, full, toasted, bready malty flavor and the finish introduces some light floral hops to take the edge off the sweet caramel and molasses. Theres a light citrus in there too that comes out late in the finish. Probably one of the best oktoberfests Ive had this year. A wonderful fall beer."
"Nicely balanced for the style."
"Overall: One of the OGs of Oktoberfests. Solid example of the style that makes you feel like you are in Munich. A definate Fall-time pick up every year (and not a bad choice year-round either)."
"I have very pleasant memories of ol' HP from my Munich travels a few years back so I have very high hopes for this bevo. Light copper color with a tinge of blonde. Smells caramel sweet but also adds a decent nutty maltiness to counterbalance. Tastes crisp with surprising hoopiness and a bitter aftertaste. I wish the mouthfeel was a little dryer but it's still not bad. This one grows on you and I could easily see downing several on a brisk fall day. A full bore but slightly different interpretation of Oktoberfest by one of its past masters, give this one a try."
"I couldn't put this beer to bed so to speak. It somehow kept re-appearing in my weizen glass fresh and poured to perfection. It has a nice kick at 5.8%. I could see this as a great BBQ type brew. Enjoy and buy alot."
"Brew pours to a light amber color with a nice fluffy off white head that has fair retention and leaves a fair amount of lacing around the sides of the glass. The aromas are of malt with some spice like smells. Has strong flavors of malt that seem to have slight toasted notes along with a sweet molasses like flavor and a slight nuttiness. This is one of my favorite October brews, always look for it at the end of August through October."
"I had plenty of this in Munich and Im glad it travels so well to the states. Very easy to pair with German food. This one is a keeper!"
"Smells like sweet toasted malts and some grassy hops. First tastes: Wow, I have been saving my Octoberfests until now to drink and this one is great. Slight hint of toffee taste. I could drink it all day. Very well balanced, hardly an aftertaste and I will definitely have to have it again."
"Amber is the color best to describe this brew. There is a light off white head that has exploded in my glass. The head fades into a nice lace and slowly leaves by the end of the brew. Aroma is malt, caramel and a slight nut aroma coming from somewhere. Taste is sweet malt, caramel a bready feel with the bitterness of hops coming in just a bit in the end. Mouthfeel is smooth and drinkability is great. One of my favorites of the style."
" IMHO this beer sets the standard for the Marzen style. In a recent side by side Oktofest tasting w/ friends, this beer was the favorite of all involved."
"Drank it nice and chilled, like I like a lager. I will definitely buy this beer again."
"Pours from the bottle an orangish-amber with a foam white one finger head that settles down into thick lacing. Medium carbonation, a few bubbles, but not overly fizzy. I smell bready malts & hints of toffee/vanilla. Malts and hops work together nicely in the flavor department. They tend to complement each other rather than trying to overpower each other. Nice medium mouthfeel, just a lingering hint of bitterness on the swallow. Very well done!!!"
"This one definitely changes my perception about the style. A real winner!"
"BB 22-05-06. Good presentation with amberbrown clear beer and lasting head. nose is overwelmingly malty with the sweet munich caracter. Litle green hops and a slight papernote. Taste is very malty, litle cardboard, litle sweet and strong. Clean light bitter aftertaste. Well balanced brew though maybe litle overdone is munichmalts but with fine and not too highly dosed carbonisation an enjyable mouthfeel. Drinkability is like the other Munich oktoberfests, just runs down fine."
"Very sessionable"
"Flavor is sweet carmel, sugar, with a very light bittering finish. I expected better"
"Feel is moderately build from its Vienna malt in thickness and bready-like richness. Solid medium body with a chewy slick center and smooth character. Cuts right down and is seemingly way to easy to drink."
"This is a very drinkable beer--refreshing despite the lack of bitter bite, and I love how it feels going down. Had this in my room on the first cool day of autumn (today) and would have gladly had another if I'd had time."
"Overall a fine example of the style. I'll say it again - CLEAN. The flavors are very fresh and balanced, and they never build-up on the tongue - clean (OK, enough already). One of my favorite O'fests for sure."
"12 ounce bottle. This beer pours out a clear brownish color with a half inch head. The aroma is toasted malt and caramel. Toasted malt flavor. The malt is a little nutty too. Not as fruity as other Oktoberfests. Spicy hops provide the balance. Mouthfeel is medium. Good drinkability. This is a very tasty Oktoberfest, but beware that it is not uncommon to get a less than fresh bottle."
"These are a bit too sticky sweet for me to session, so drinkability suffers a bit, but all in all a good Oktoborfest I'd drink again."
"Very drinkable... I'm not sure why, but I like this more than the Paulaner.... maybe because its not so sweet.... anyway... nice example of the style."
"The palate, on the other hand, is far from mild. Melaniodin characteristics are at the forefront and the finish is all toasty malt. Though the malt characteristics dominate there are enough hops (flavor and bitterness) present to keep things from getting cloying. This is a quality beer."
"Drinkability and Overall: An excellent Oktoberfest. One of my personal favorites, along with Penn Brewery's. This one is phenomenally drinkable, and one I could (and would love to) sit and drink all day and all night. An excellent choice for this time of year."
"Mouthfeel is decent. A little fizzy and medium bodied lager."
"Golden, apple juice-ish color with a thin, fizzy head that's in a hurry to get somewhere, leaving only a small slick of bubbles behind. Smells sweet and bready with a hint of sour yeastiness. Tastes bready upfront, followed by a touch of sharp hop bitterness and some buttery diacetyl. Great toasted malt finish. Mouthfeel is thick with some sparkling carbonation. Very solid beer, extremely easy to drink."
"Overall impression: Great Oktoberfest - this one makes me look forward to autumn!"
"Pours a clear golden amber, tight white head forms, sticks around and laces real well on the glass. Smell is bready and malty, some citrus hops, little bit of roast, and a toasted bread finish. Crisp and clean citrus and malt up front, bready middle, some light toast, and some citrus in the finish. Smooth and crisp, medium body and medium carbonation. Very easy drinking and refreshing beer but with enough complexity to please."
"Overall: Nice Oktoberfest, one of the best I've tried so far this year."
"This brewer for me has remained true over time."
"Had this along with some other Oktos over the last couple of weeks. This is supposed to be the ""original"" Oktoberfest? Nice light malt/bread aroma accompanying a gold/amber color. I'm a malty kind of guy and this one really packs a good, solid malt flavor with some subtle trailing hops. Of the German Oktos I have tried this year, this one is I think the best one by far. Prosit!!"
"This is my second Oktoberfest and I have to say there isn't too much to this style. Goes well with food. The other day I enjoyed some Indian curry and it went well. After this tasting and write up I tried a hot dog with some chili. The malty bitterness goes well. This brew lacks the carbonation present in the Spaten."
"Hacker-Pschorr pours a clean copper color and foams to a tight bubbled head that lasts for the duration of the brew. The smell presents a sweet caramel nose offset by a slight hop bitterness. The taste matches thte smell well, the abundant flavor is a sweet caramel malt flvor with a hint of sourness. The hops are earthy and just enough bitterness to balance the sweet character. The mouthfeel of this fall offerieng is clean and smooth, but not over-heavy. This is a very drinkable beer, but too good to be a session beer."
"Prosit!"
"Has a good dark color for a modern German Okto. A little bit lighter in malt character, but it more than makes up for it in a nice hoppy nose. There are some melanoidins in the bigger malt bill, and a little sourness. Also note a bit of hard water which helps bring out the hops."
"A clean amber beer with orange highlights. Has a nice foamy off white head. The aroma has a strong grainy and biscuit character. The taste starts with a nice light carmel malt sweetness and slowly fades with an easy hop finish. An easy drinking O'fest but I was put of by the strong grain aroma."
"--Joey"
"The bottom of the bottle came much too quickly. Although I've had better versions, Hacker-Pschorr Oktoberfest-Marzen is quality beer that I'll be sure to look for again. Next year I'll drink it in season since I'm sure that it's even better in autumn when it's super fresh."
"D--quite easy to drink especially for a seasonal. It is a session beer and thats exactly what it is trying to be."
"H-P Original Oktoberfest is amber-orange in color. Not hazy like the Ayinger O-Fest I had earlier tonight. Head is adequate and lightly creamy. Aroma is typical of what you'd espect from an marzen: malty with a touch of caramel. Taste is nicely balanced with minimal graininess. Primarily toasted malted sweetness is noticed with just a bit of hops for balance and crispness. Of course like every other Bavarian brew this is an easy-drinker and recommended for sessions."
"This beer poured a nice golden amber with a white head that quickly disappeared. The smell was sweet and malty with a trace presence of hops. It had decent crispness and a slight sweetness, this was a very easy drinking beer. This was not as strong as I expected, but still a pretty decent brew."
"Nice easy drinking."
"Drinkability: Good for a session, or in a large stein. The balance is good particularly at the finish, which helps the palate."
"Crystal clear orange/amber color, with minial head. Looks like many a fest beers. Smel is sweet with carmel malts and floral hops. Taste has a big malt flavor, slightly grassy, yet also sweet at the same time. After having this o-fest and spaten's offering back-to-back, this is the one I prefer greatly. Not the best fest beer, but is above average."
"A very clean and crisp, yet tasty and distinctive beer."
"This has to be the beer Boston Brewing Company has been trying to reduplicate since it began with little success ... Sam's Octoberfest is a degenerate off-shoot of this simple beauty."
"This beer pours a golden amber color with a small head that fals to barely ring the beer. The nose is nice caramel sweetness with the marzen character I have learned to enjoy. The flavor is much more of that marzen bready character, with a hint of caramel. The feel is a bit thin as well. Drinkability is not as bad as the Tabernash, but its a close second. I don't really like this one either very much."
"Hands down good oktoberfest, I prefer it over the Paulaner."
"I had an Octoberfest tasting last night, and this was the winner. A little more flavor than the Paulaner, IMO (and much better than the Spaten). I've never had a bad beer from this brewery, but this is the first one that stood out. The usual characteristics, amber in color, smooth body, carmel flavors. Still somewhat thin, but a very good brew overall."
"This beer was orange amber colored. The nose was of toasted malts yet there is a hint of sweetness. Taste was slightly sweet, perhaps caramel, yet finished slightly bitter yet cleansing. Overall I thought this was very drinkable, one to be picked up for future Ocktoberfest's. Our gang also gave this one a thumbs up!"
"Overall this is a good beer, not terrific, but it is one of the better oktoberfest brews out there, definately worth a try."
"Overall Impression: Its like there is an Oomph Pa band in my mouth, and all the good and bad that go with that analogy. The cymbals are a bit loud, and the tuba player called in sick. Im pretty disappointed, I love Oktoberfests, and Hacker-Pschorr is a respected brewer, this one just didnt click. Im going to give a moderate review in hopes I got a bad bottle somehow. Ill revisit, probably next season."
"Multi-dimensional in flavors--the profile starts with malt (very dry), but quickly switches to hop bitterness. Unlike a pale ale, the hop is more like a spice. Nice body for a lager with a above average carbonation. This is a nice lager with a clean aftertaste that fades fairly quickly."
"* I paired this beer up with some gruyere cheese (as suggested on BA) from Switzerland and the pairing was AMAZING. The flavors of the cheese and maltiness of this beer blended perfectly."
"ng"
"Nice amber hue with an offwhite head that consists of tiny tight bubbles that dissapates quickly and leaves very little lacing. Doesn't seem to be much hop aroma.Clear ,medium bodied with smooth mouthfeel.Softly carbonated and easy drinking.So far my favorite of this style. All in all a very pleasant brew."
"Drinkability? Not impressed here. Not my taste."
"Flavorful but not assertively so. A quintessential Oktoberfest in my book."
"Poured virtually flat from the tap, this stuff looked like it was squeezed form a blood orange, with a cool reddish-amber color. Has that telltale German malt smell (my girlfriend thought it smelled like a ""ham, honey and tomato sandwich",) tastes like caramel birch beer with a teaspoon of C&H brown sugar. Despite its near-flatness its still got some carbonation in there, has a strange but good tingly mouthfeel, goes down a bit watery and finishes a tad sour and dry. Definitely interesting, worth a try but not one of my favorites."
"Straight out of the growler, this Oktoberfest pours a crystal-clear copper color with a suitable white head that receded slowly and left a thin, sticky lace. The smell is mostly malts (but only lightly roasted) with a sneaky lemon background. The taste is relatively flat--some nuttiness but not much to balance the light plum sweetness. Hops are distant. The finish is dull and has a slightly rubbery tone. The mouthfeel, however, is smooth and the amount of carbonation is right on."
"Tried this at the Goose Island O-Fest Beer Academy. To cut to the chase/finish, before the rest of my review, this beer was the clear winner in my book. The beer pours a very pretty crystal clear orange color, and gives off a very strong, very nice toasted malt scent. The toasted malt scent continues into a rich, toasted malt, fairly think and sweet taste that's got just enough hops to balance the richness of the beer. Absolutely delicious and quite easy to drink."
"Not bad, but not great"
"Very satisfying, Marzen here.. a hint of doppelbock characteristics adds a heaviness, that is flavorful, but hurts drinkability. Bottle label is, most likely, the most attractive of the Munich, festbiers."
"I've been please with all samples from this brewery. This one continues that trend."
"12 ounce bottle, with no freshness dating to be found, pours typical light coppery amber. Malty nose. slim white head, dissolving to tiny bubbles, just a wee bit of lacing. Medium bodied, moderate depth of malt flavor. Not the most exciting style, IMHO, but usually tasty and highly drinkable. This one is a respectable sessioner"
"Rich reddish amber color, without a lasting head to speak of. Malty sweet smell. Mostly sweet and malty taste with a hint of floral hops and a light soda like mouthfeel. After taste is slightly hoppy and slightly sour, with a hint of something astringent. Over all its really decent and highly drinkable. One of my favorite oktoberfests, I buy this almost every year."
"This oktoberfest poured a clear, amber color with tall, creamy, yellow-tinted foam that settled but left some lace. The smell was malty with notes of cocoa and caramel and some sweetness. The taste was richly malty with light sweetness. There were hints of caramel and cocoa with a nice hoppy sharpness in the finish. There was also a bit off Munich malt flavor in the background. The mouthfeel was smooth with a crisp finish. The body was medium with medium carbonation. This was a very nice and enjoyable oktoberfest bier."
"Big soda style, orangish cream colored head becomes creamy as is continues to hold like a champ. Swarming clouds of bubbles rise through the orange tinged golden beer. Broken rings of lace as the beer disappears. Well rounded malty aroma with a bit of caramel. The aroma carries over into the flavor which is just on the sweet side. Medium body, light and smooth on the mouth."
"Clear lighter copper color with a head that starts like frothy milk but dissipates fairly quickly. Big but scant looping laces. Nice caramel nose, mostly on the malt side. Mouthfeel is relativley full for style, medium and slightly sticky in impression. Lower carbonation. Flavor is fine if slightly unidimensional, aspects of the aroma are emphasized again, slightest toastiness, speck of spiciness throughout. Sits comfortably as representative of style, but lately, fresher American examples on tap are motivating me more. I was surprised I haven't reviewed this beer before, I've picked up six packs of this for years and years."
"I won't mince words here. We've had an Oktoberfest Party with beer competiton for the last 8 years with over 25 judges (male & female) comparing Oktoberfest brews from everywhere in the world and this one is the reigning champ. We bring in new challengers every year, but this brew still captures most of the praise at our annual Oktoberfest. I could drink this beer everyday and so could most of my friends. An all time favorite in our large circle of friends!!"
"what a beautiful beer this is while it's being poured into the glass, excellent copper color that's clear and brilliant. nice dense tan head. mild aromas of malt and hops just a balanced and clean aroma. great malty mouthfeel, hints of being thick and syrupy but i could definetly knock back a few liters of this any day."
"Finally picked this beer up after passing it a number of times over the years and was glad that I finally did it. The beer had a wonderful malty aroma that went down very smooth with a mild taste with not much of a strong aftertaste. If there is hops in this brew I could not taste them. Beer was a dark copper that gave way to a nice head. Would definately drink this beer again and the best Octoberfest I have had this season."
"just what I've been looking for."
"Very nice,crystal clear coppery color.Little or no head but a decent carbonation level. Nice aroma-somewhat toasted malt. Slightly grainy. Malty flavor up front. Vey slight hop bitterness. Nice malty mouthfeel as well. An extremely drinkable beer-would reccomend this to any macro drinker as a good ""training wheel beer"". Vey well balanced overall indeed."
"This is a good beer that is easy to drink, but a little too strong in the finish. But not a bad beer to drink anytime of the year."
"I had one of these while jamming with a friend of my Dad's, and this beer was perfect for the occasion. A great German Oktoberfest brew that holds true to the style. Highly recommended."
"A very drinkable brew, I could easily see me drinking a large mug of this at Oktoberfest."
"Overall a classic Oktoberfrest. If you find it...buy it over Paulaner!"
"D&N: Not the best Marzen out there, but a beer I'd definitely recommend someone try."
"The beer is simple flavor-wise, but what is here is quite enjoyable and is very easy to drink. It may not be too memorable by some, but I will remember this as being a good, easy to drink amber lager whether it be early Fall or late-Spring."
"The Oktoberfest is on tap year round at a local eatery. Sometimes it can get really aged and lose a lot of flavor, not to mention carbonation, but when they have tapped a new keg, it's really good. It pours a cloudy amber with a large head. The smell is maltiness with a hops background. The taste is smoky malt with a kicker of hoppiness. Just a slight bitterness at the end. It has a clean, moderately thick feel in the mouth. When fresh it is hard to stop at one."
"John"
"Pours a deep amber with reddish tints. Little head with no retention and minor lace. Aroma is caramel malt, some bread or yeast hints with minor hop bitterings. Flavor is smooth malt with minor bitter hint. Somehat one dimensional but very tasty. Very smooth in the mouth, just made to drink out a litr stein. I find that the caramel taste stays fairly true even as the beer warms up some."
"After tasting this beer, I figure that this is what an oktoberfest should be. Amber-orange in appearence with a beautiful head. Sweet caramel with very subtle hops, but the sweetness dominates. After finishing a pint it only leaves you thirsty for more. This is definately an authentic oktoberfest."
"The beer pours an amber color with a spotty lace head. The aroma is sweet from the mixture of pale and crystal malts. The taste is sweet, but not overpowering. This is a darker version of a lager beer. It is medium bodied and very drinkable. This isn't one of my favorite Octoberfests, but it's pretty decent."
"Mouthfeel is crisp yet uninspired. A good medium body. An ending tangyness to the mouthfeel is not good but not a beer buster either. It drinks easy. A fine Oktoberfest. It is just not my favorite. It is definately worth trying one."
"Pours to a clear copper color with a tan head. The aroma is sweet and malty, bready with hints of grain. The flaovr is malty and somewhat bready and toffee-like. It is also a tad bit astringent. It is a medium bodied beer that has a drying finish. Not a bad Oktoberfest."
"One pint bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a light amber color with two fingers of head. There is nice lacing present. The smell is sweet and malty with caramel and toffee. The taste is also fairly sweet with a good hops finish. The mouthfeel and drinkability are both above average. A darn solid brew."
"A light coppery amber with a short-lived white head, that left a thin lace coating. The nose is strong bready malt accompanied by the presence of noble hops. The taste was a little disappointing compared with the others in the field, a simple malt profile and hardly any finish at all. A bit strong at 5.8 which minimizes drinkability."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle with a side-saddle fraulein (sp?) atop a big black horse on the label, it's a very eye-pleasing copper with a white head that's initially thick and leaves a layer on top of the beer. Toffee sweetness and a bit of nuttiness dominate the smell. At first, it almost seems too sweet but things end up balancing nicely after a few sips. This stuff is really easy to drink. Good thing it's brewed year-round."
"A great Oktoberfest from a great Munchen brewery. Well-balanced and full of taste, this certainly stands up with the best of the season. Hopefully, I'll have this one again next year!!!"
"A pretty good Oktoberfest."
"Mouthfeel: True to style and nicely done -- medium creaminess while still ""thin"" in the perfect way."
"An excellent example of the style, and one I seem to like better than their seasonal Marzen. Has a rather luscious and creamy texture, golden ruby in color with a nice think foamy head atop. Nice malty aroma with some caramel and nuts in the nose as well. Flavor has a great malt base, with a touch of sweetness and that nuttiness again. Smooth and easy to drink. Light enough that you could drink many, and flavorful enough that you would want to."
"Amber colored as described on the label. This is one of the darker Octoerfests from Germany. Starts with the emphasis on the light caramel malt flavors with big malt nose. Balanced between malt and hops in the middle followed with a lightly dry finish. A bit light bodied for the style. A very drinkable lager beer with a little bit of strength to it. Probably my favorite German Octoberfest."
"Overall, a solid octoberfest."
"Drinkability: An average Oktoberfest. Would be willing to try again next year for comparison."
"This is a very nice O'fest beer."
"A medium-sized, cream-colored, dense-but-coarse (?) head sits on top the dark amber/reddish clear beer. Vanilla and peanuts are strange complements in the tangy, malty nose. The taste starts tangy, moves through malty with chocolate highlights and settles on a zingy, almost rye-like, nutty finish. This is a very flavorful beer. Tasty, but really needs to warm to show its full, sweet body."
"Poured a beautiful clear copper under a small off-white head that fizzled quickly and left no discernible lace. The nose was very malty, with a touch of nuts and caramel. There is lots of carbonation here to offset a fairly heavy mouth. The tongue detects sweet malt and a touch of caramel, followed by a very nice hoppy bite that just gets more insistent as the brew warms. The aftertaste is a lovely combination of sweet malt and hoppy tones. I sure could see myself downing a few Mass of this elixir. Yum!"
"I must have had an old bottle last year, cuz this year The Hacker Pschorr Ofest is very solid. Nice clear copper color. Minimal off white head. Aroma of toasted malt is dominant and pleasing. The body of the beer is damn near full. Chewy. Thick. Flavor is dominated by a vienna like toastiness and underlying biscuit. Toffee tones in the background add to the subtle complexity. This is a good one ladies and gents."
"Clear orange-copper color, nice white foamy head that leaves a nice lacing in my glass. Aroma of caramel and roasted nuts, sweet bready and malty caramel flavors, light to medium body with a roasted and sweet finish, this is a very good Oktoberfest, I think I will have another."
"Probably the benchmark Oktoberfest beer as far as I am concerned. A fall staple without a doubt. Highly drinkable and highly enjoyable!"
"Appearance: Copper amber hue with a nice two finger sized cream off white colored head, and a perfectly even pattern of specks scattered equidistantly. Aroma: Caramel malts toasted to perfection wow this is my go to German Oktoberfest bier, simply kicks ass some light German hops going on in there but perfect blend. Taste: A creamy edge of caramel toasted malts so good but the bitter streak running through it is perfect the German lager stands out from the rest that I have tried really good stuff here I must say, after trying all of these back to back amazing Ofests I'm about to call it my favorite style for awhile. Mouthfeel: Clean crisp refreshing lighter body not as much texture as some but still very good and smooth. Drinkability: Just as good as any classic representations I like the extra bitterness compared to some other malt monsters of this style, not overly hopped just more prevalent than others I have tasted."
"Amber-orange brew with a tannish head, which pours very large but settles, becoming thin and scattered. Aroma of sourdough bread malt and spicy hops with a grainy undertone. The taste is mainly of malts, but hops provide a good crisp and spicy backbone. Starts off with lots of bready and grainy malt and a good hop bite. Just a little caramel is noticeable. Finishes very crisp with some bitterness, but not without a little sweetness to balance things out. Very crisp and refreshing. Not as big-bodied as some other märzens, but still very good in its own way. This is second only to Paulaner's among my favorite Oktoberfestbiers."
"Poured a light red color that lacked a head. Nose of malt and spice. Taste is very subtle and low in carbonation. Bready malts show but no flavor really come out and shows itself to me. Slight hoppiness towards the end along with some spice. This one was alright but lacked didn't have the characteristics that would make it a good oktoberfest."
"Medium-copper in color with a white head that stitched a patchwork quilt of lace on the sides of the glass. Good dose of malt and caramel in the nose. Brief hints of spicy hops noted as well. Also, a bit of ""pumpkin"" scent escapes from the glass. Flavor is a nice mix of ""pumpkin pie", mixed with a strong dose of malt sweetness. Not to be outdone, there is also a good balacing by the bittering from the hops. Finished with a very slight bitter aftertaste. Kept me reaching for more. Fairly smooth. Medium-bodied. Very drinkable. An Oktoberfest I could easily come back to year after year."
"Update  I am re-reviewing again with a 2005 vintage. This seems to get better every year. The Appearance was much improved. The beer itself is a wonderful, clear, bright orange and the head was medium with good retention and left cool-looking pits. Awesome!"
"pours a brownish orange colour with a decent enough head. The smell is of caramel with a little spice. The taste is nice and very malty with roasted grain and caramel notes with a little dry spice to balance the sweetness.on the finish. Mouth feel is nice with a nice light bite of carbonation. Drinkability is high. A very nice Oktoberfest beer."
"Pours a clear copper, with a small off-white head that quickly diminshes, but leaves good lace all the way down. Aroma is all malt, mostly caramel and some toasted malts. Flavor is fairly sweet, some toasted/maybe a bit smokey flavors, and some slight chocolate sneaking in at the end. Medium body, medium carbonation."
"Nice lace to this. creamy. to say the least I so dug this beer. I could keep drinking it all through the year. Very much a malty taste to it. has little spice, but more malt then anything else. has a tatse of tea to it, but still very bread like. I like the feel to this ock-fest and I recomedn it."
"The beer pours a perspicuous burnished copper color, the head mountainous in size, spumescent in texture, the color a beauteous light tan and as it disjoins the lace forms a concealing sheet upon the glass. The aroma of sweet malted grain greets you first, then a bit of molasses, crisp and clean, a treat for the eyes and the nose, start is quite sweet, thickly malt with the top middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is lenient in its acidity, the hops pleasantly mild in their spiciness, dry and lingering aftertaste, quite a quaffable brew tis true."
"Beautiful appearance ...coppery amber with a nice head that dissipates in a very nice lace. Nice malty aroma. Taste has a nice strong up front presence with a bit of bite in the end. Mouthfeel is substantial with a hint of alcohol presence. Nice drinkability if you like to sip your brew. Malty presence a bit more pronounced upon warming. Different from other Oktoberfests I've sampled..but definitely worth a try."
"Highly drinkable."
"Pours a nice amber color with a light head definent high carbonation on this one,aroma is very malty and slightly sweet.Taste is bread-like with some light sweetness with a somewhat dry finish.Has a slight burnt tinge to it,a real nice fest beer to drink alot of.Nice to see in mid August."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin."
"Deep gold color, large head, kind of creamy. Spicy malty aroma. A medium bodied marzen. Malty and slightly spicy. Touch of smoke/toast. Nice flavored marzen. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is crisp and a little dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nice beer."
"This beer pours a nice amber color with a large creamy head that leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. The aroma is of roasted malts and sweet also. The taste is fairly smooth and I has hints of caramel with sweetness and some light spices as well. Solid taste. Very well representative of the style. Not a bad beer."
"Pours a nice 1"" head that dissipates fairly quickly. Smells a little fruity and sweet. Clear orange color. Roasted malt, with good hop finish; malt is also there. Very drinkable. If you compare this to American lagers..well...Nice balanced profile. Good session beer. To my recollection this is a top Oktoberfest."
"IMHO, one of the very best representations of the true Oktoberfest beers. Deep Gold/Amber with orange hues in color with a sweet off-white lasting head and sticky, clingy lace. Lightly caramel sweet aroma with a hint of citrus. Slightly citrus, lightly tea-like and a touch of metallic hop bitterness. Rounded malt and hop balance. Honey and fresh fruit notes. Really velvety smooth. Rich, Bold, Tasty! Wow!"
"This is a beer that I have looked forward to every Fall since the first time I tried it at the Wichita Beer Festival. It is not an outstanding brew by any means, but it is better than a lot of the other widely available Oktoberfest beers that I have had. I would consider this a good Fall session beer."
"This was another beer that Ive had for over two years. I could not find a fresh example locally to compare it to. If that opportunity ever presents itself, I will re-evaluate this review accordingly."
"Pours bright orange amber in color with a thin and bubbly white head that quickly fades into a ring around the sides of the glass. Nose is sweet lightly toasted malts and grains with a bit of caramel. The same toasted malts and grains come through in the flavor up front with a bit of an herbal, tea-like quality. Finish is crisp with some mild spicy hops and a touch of sweet caramel. One of the better Oktoberfests on the market today."
"Amber color, with a lacey, tannish head. Highly aromatic : spicy, cloves, cinnamon, herbal. Malty, but not overmuch. Some sweetness, but, again, just enough. Delicate hop, solid body, slight sharpness and a coppery edge in the mouthfeel. Very delicious."
"Bright copper-penny amber, topped by a healthy foamy off-white head. A big whiff of fresh bread accompanies the bottle opening, and then the pour. Then the aroma is much more caramel. Like a proper Octoberfest, the taste is overtly malty, but there is a nice hop zip around the edges. Not syrupy in taste or texture. A bit lighter than many Octoberfests, this could make an exceptional cross-over beer. My Bud drinking father-in-law loves it, and my sister-in-law who doesn't drink beer tasted one and liked it."
"I find this one hard to describe. It is just cleaner and crisper in taste with a truly mastered blend of malt and hops. This is the best seasonal Oktoberfest I have had this year. Find it - buy it and drink it. Cherish it. The nose and taste combine to give you a true calgon moment. you can just feel the stress of the day evaporate with the first swallow. I enjoy this one so much I prefer it in a snifter style glass instead of a pilsner style. This really allow for the head to collect and the bouquet to collect so you really savor every attribute of this fine beer."
"Dark amber as was expected with this style. Head was good and decent lacing ringed the glass. This brew was not very aromatic, but then what lagers are? Taste was a little hoppier than I expected or have experienced from this type of brew. Still the nice slightly sweet malty base made this a very drinkable brew. Could easily quaff a few if in the mood."
"Poured a clear deep amber with a nice foamy head. Sweet malt nose, couldn't pick up much else. Smooth with a rich malt taste and a slightly creamy finish. Nice carbonation across the tongue. Body seems a tad bit light. This a great beer to pair with German food such as bratwurst, or a hearty roast."
"Pours a nice light copper/ light orange color with amedium head that unfortunately faded quickly. Left some lace. The first sip was pure sweetness, like candy corn. Great malt, almost cereal like mouthfeel, with a well balanced, slightly hopped finish. One of the best Fest's this year."
"Hacker Pschorr Original Oktoberfest is a real treat to drink."
"clear, dark amber in color. little head and lace. nose of toasted malts. tastes doughy...light roasted malts with a crisp finish. medium mouthfeel. a traditional rendition of the german o-fest. it's certainly a fine beer and one that's tasty and easy drinking."
"Presentation: Packaged in a 330 ml (11.2 ounce) brown glass long neck bottle, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
"Pours a great looking clear copper color with a nice, creamy, dark tan head that shrinks to a thin film.  Sweet caramel malts as well as a subtle toasty quality in the aroma.  Smooth and sweet carmale malt opens the beer up.  Much sweeter and stronger caramel qualities than most of the others of the style I've tried.  Very smooth and almost creamy and not cloying or sticky, a big plus considering the increased caramel flavors.  Excellent bier and it is definitely duking it out with the Brooklyn Ofest as far as my favorite so far this year."
"This Oktoberfest poured an auburn-orange with a compact, dense off-white head.  Solid head retention.  The nose had a wonderful mixture of spice (apples & cinnamon), sweet malt, and some hops.  I was happy to see that the nose matched the flavors flawlessly.  This Oktoberfest has qualities that make it unique and able to standout from a crowded pack.  Overall it is very tasty and very drinkable!"
"Had the draft version at the Oktoberfest in Munich and it is much different than the bottle version we get here in the states. First off it is much lighter in color - closer to a Helles color. The creamy head piles up high and lasts forever. Smells a little cleaner - meaning less maltier than the bottle version. Taste is much cleaner also with less of the caramel flavors, but is a little sweeter and softer. Much easier to drink since I was able to drink about 5 liters in a session while hungover from the night before. It makes you feel real good. Suggest eating  a big ass soft pretzle with it."
"Dark copper hue, w/ brilliant clarity from the lagering.  Ivory white head leaves sparse lace.  Soft, lightly toasty Munich and toffeeish malt nose, w/ a hint of caramelized fruit melanoidins in aroma. Trace herbal hop nose.  Nutty sweetness upfront in flavor, followed a smooth, drying wave of toasty Munich.  Sweetness derived from caramel malt reemerges mid palate, and is partially offset by hop bitterness, lending a balanced, crisp nature to this brew.  Moderate bodied, w/ a agreeably smooth mouthfeel that helps facilitate excellent drinkability.  Finishes lightly sweet w/ Munich malt briefly lingering.  Although a touch shy in depth of malt profile, the pleasant sweetness and overall balance makes this a very quaffable oktoberfest.  Enjoyable."
"Clear, copper in color with an off-white head that drops shortly but leaves a good collar and some very nice lace. The aroma is of Vienna malt: lightly sweet, toasty, and rich! There are some minimal background hops. The body is light-medium with a moderate carbonation and a smooth & creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is of a fresh, ""juicy", Vienna malt with a gentle toasty quality, a light caramel note, and a present-but-not-imposing alcohol. Extremely well balanced with a light hop flavor, and an underlying bitterness for support. The finish is semi-dry with a gently lingering toasted malt note. Absolutely brilliant! Easily one of the best Oktoberfest beers available. In my book, in the top 3 with Paulaner and Spaten!"
"Beautiful, sweet and slightly spicy aroma.  Hint of alcohol in the taste.  Wonderful biscuit malt taste throughout the beer.  Unlike other beers in the style, the sweetness is genuine and not overpowering.  Dark, golden color  with a stable, substantial head.  Terrifically drinkable!  This is still the best Oktoberfest Ive had."
"Now here's an elite Octoberfest....dark gold in color with a puffy white head..nose is outstanding featuring caramel and biscuits...body is about perfect for this style...smooth texture too....the taste has to be the best in the style...a nice mellow caramel taste along with some breadiness....noble hops impart a nice balance...very drinkable...very tasty...very outstanding...."
"This is one of the top Oktoberfest beers in my book, I get this by the case only though they have switched to sturdy 12oz long neck bottles. I guess for better shipping?"
"Medium-light bodied, gently carbonated.  Works nicely in the mouth.  A person could suck down a whole lot of these."
"MIld hop bitterness with full malt flavor. Crystal clear amber color with a thin white head. A caramel taste that brings you back for more. Although I think this beer is a bit thin on body its still a must try."
"Deep dark orange, borders on red.  Small, tight head, film remains to end.  Clean carmelized malt aroma with some spicy hops.  Flavor starts sweet, very malty, clean and rich.  Turns oily, slick, slighty spicy and lasts forever.  Reminds me of a Dobblebock.  I finished this Okt twice as fast as all my others and will be going back to get a lot more."
"Hacker-Pschorr Original O-Fest, nice orange color, with very little head, and a tiny bit of lace down the sides.  Clean aroma, very pleasant.  The taste is of nicely balanced malt flavors in the traditional O-fest flavor, with a spicy flavor of hops rounding out the beer very nicely.  Very nice."
"H-P's year-round offering. Average looking, for an O'fest -- orangey/brown, with a rocky off-white head that vanishes (poof, it's gone). Aroma has subtle malty aspects (caramel, buttered cinnamon bread). The taste is also dominated by maltiness, but it's subtle, not syrupy-sweet. In fact, it's rather pleasant in its subtlety. Some mild hop flavors, mostly floral. And although I don't know what the abv is, I can tell you it's pretty low, making for an imminently drinkable festive session beer."
"Amber in color with minimal head and decent carbonation.  The aroma is slightly caramel, mostly malt.  The taste is a sweet malt with a slightly spicy/alcohol aftertaste.  It is a bit thin for mouthfeel but very highly drinkable.  One of the better Oktoberfests, although it is not my favorite style."
"Not a very distinctive Oktoberfest given its Munich roots.  The body is a very nice dark amber color, but the slim whitish head disappeared too quickly.  The aroma is a caramel malt mixture, but my bottle had a rather funky soapy odor on top.  The taste has the necessary maltiness, but barely and the body seems a bit weak.  Overall, I expected much more from this brewery."
"Pours a deep bright amber almost orange color, with a foamy off-white head with decent retention. On the nose there is the aroma of toasted malts & touch of caramel. On the palate it is medium bodied, toasted malts, caramel flavors, slight graininess, slight hop bitterness, and slightly metallic flavor which went away after it warmed up a bit. Overall this was a very good Oktoberfest brew..."
"It pours with a white head...nothing special here, over gently carbonated clear medium amber liquid. Nose is quite malty, quite sweet smelling. Taste is medium-bodied mouthfeel with a surge of malt, then fading into a blandish finish...pretty one-dimensional beer here, although good for quaffing in mass quantities...sort of the lawnmower beer of Oktoberfests. Not putting it down, I just feel there are more out there that offer more flavor."
" ;)"
"Bright nearly glowing orangish-copper hue. Faint off white head, oily resiny, bubbles bust through, head didn't last, some tiny remants laced the glass. Very rich, malty, and  sweet inviting smell. Rich, warm sweet malty taste, lots of positive tastes on the finish. Hints of cinnamon, nutmeg and other sweets.  I wish it was a little cooler, maybe I would enjoy it a bit more. This one seemd a touch thin, overall very good. Available year round, I worry about it's freshness. Couldn't locate a freshness date on it."
"German's make some damn good brew.  This speciman has a deep amber colour with a heay, thick, creamy head that retains well and keeps a full cover.  Nice caramel lamt scent with a shade of minerals. Subtle, but full caramel malt with smooth nolble hops, perhaps, great balance.  Full figured, light-medium body, hella smooth and rich.  This brew drank super slick and smooth.  Slips down the hatch, good for the whole night and into the next morning.  Cheers!"
"i dont' know if something was up with this on draught, but it tasted really funny. it had a somewhat strong taste of vinegar in it. the quality oktoberfest was hidden in the back, and it was still a decent brew, but it was just not the same beer i was so accustomed to. i can't imagine how it was so much different especially that it was not as good on draught"
"Clear, light amber in color.  Large loosely packed bubbles. Clean tasting, with a pleasant malt taste. Less bitter than some other similar beers. Quite drinkable.  I sampled this on Draught. Very nice!"
"Notes: This is Hacker-Pschorr's year round Oktoberfest offerning, not to be confused with their seasonal Oktoberfest-Märzen. It's a perfect Oktoberfest, brewed with enjoyment and a session of drinking in mind -- not strong and very drinkable."
"87"
"My bottle was well past its prime (I didn't see the date on the lower right corner of the label until I got home.  I should know better than to shop at places that will let a beer rot on the shelf until it sells), so I wasn't expecting much.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well this beer had held up.  Nice, solid maltyness, with just enough hops and sweetness at the finish.  A very pleasant marzen."
"I had this on draught recently and was severely disappointed. It was thin and had a metallic taste that made it unpleasant. The trip over must of skunked the keg."
"Spaten may be the Ur-Marzen, but I think I may prefer Hacker-Pschorr's version.  A bigger malt flavor gives it the nod."
