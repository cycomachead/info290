We are typically always on top of what we want to order from our beer spots, almost always before we even get there, but we were being so indecisive, so decided to go with this proposed offering, however widely available it is.  Again, we were not disappointed.  This is your quintessential southern German Oktoberfestbier.  The flavoring was beautifully balanced to a crisp malty push, although we did find a lacking of even the mildest hops, making for a highly sippable and enjoyable beverage to relax with.  This beer fits well with the change in the season to colder weather, and should satisfy the palate of any novice or expert alike.","TheBrewo","Sep 29, 2014"

A full flavored brew with a smooth medium body, good carbonation on the palate. Finishes with toasted grains and some moderate caramel malt comes thru as it warms up balanced with some light hops bitterness, ending has a lingering nutty flavor.

But I still find it to be overly sweet, which takes away from being able to drink more than one at a time - a quality I feel is necessary for the style. It's ABV of 6.5% also keeps it from being sessionable. I'll pass on this and go with others for Oktoberfests in the future.","barnzy78","Sep 23, 2014"

4.12,1.5,4.25,4,4,4.5,4.25,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and I thought it was a great example of a Marzen, instead of taking the bolder approach that most American brewery's do Great Lakes went very traditional with this one and they did a good job at showing what this style is all about, it might be hard to pick this one out among a few German examples of the style.  This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, fairly clean, not filling at all and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I could drink more than a few of these especially if I was at a local Oktoberfest.  What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel and just how true to style it was, it embodied what a good Marzen is all about.  What I like the least about this beer was nothing, there wasn't not a single thing that I disliked or that I thought was out of place.  I would buy this beer again, so far it's the only American made Marzen that I've had this season that I would go back and get a six pack of and I would recommend this to anyone who likes the style or just sessionable malty beers in general.  All in all I was impressed with this brew, Great Lakes took the path that not a lot of American brewery's take and in the end I think it really payed off from them and it resulted in one tasty brew.  So far it's up there as one of the better beers I've had from this brewery and so far it's my favorite American made Marzen.  Great job guys this, this was a very nice beer, keep up the hard work.","StoutHunter","Sep 21, 2014"

It represents the style so perfectly I had to give it a five. Great Lakes never seems to disappoint and I very much appreciate their attention to detail when brewing a certain style especially old world ones. Don't pass this one up. I'll be purchasing this annually.","jeneric84","Sep 21, 2014"

Medium body with a creamy texture.  Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish.  Excellent flavor profile that is balanced and complex.  It begins with a toasted biscuit character which flows into caramel over a subtle note of sweetness. The middle is slightly bitter with a very nice touch of spice. The finish is clean, slightly sweet,  and a noble hop flavor lingers while the spice tickles the tongue.  Great Lakes has nailed it, again.","tillmac62","Sep 15, 2014"

Great molasses/maple/biscuit flavor, exactly how you'd want it.  I feel like sometimes these kinds of beers get a little syrupy to hit this kind of flavor, but there's none of that here.  The color here is a mix between orange and amber, darker than most, which is nice.  Soft mouthfeel, good amount of head.  Really good stuff.","MarkQ617","Sep 13, 2014"

Sweet malty nose. A bit of depth a drizzle of honey. Noble hops give the faint scent of fresh hay.    Sweet biscuit.  Taste is simply lovely. Smooth, crisp , sweet malt.  Tantalizing with a faint bi t of honey. Small hop bit ion the back end.  Perfect dryness and a light graham cracker.

I have not been a fan of Great Lakes in the past because I felt like they put too much malt in their supposedly hoppier beers. On the contrary this beer is designed to be a maltier beer. Classical Marzen in that respect. This is a very nice representation of the style. I am not sure it is worth the 100 rating that BA gives it but it is a tasty brew. I look forward to trying more of this style this fall and comparing them to this one, which apparently is seen as one of, if not the best Oktoberfest beer produced in the US.","humuloner22","Aug 20, 2014"

The aroma is pretty weak, with some mild malt notes. The taste has some nice biscuit notes, a little caramel sweetness and a hint of earthiness. The body has a nice weight to it and there's a little bit of carbonation on the finish. This is a very good lager, but when compared to it's German cousins, it just comes up a little short for me.","delta490","Aug 16, 2014"

Strong caramel notes with a side of honey, but also has a slight hoppy twist at the end of it, which is pretty good. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and with very little carbonation.

The malt provides flavors of bread, caramel, toffee, and grass, and the hops add just enough bitterness to balance the sweetness from the malt. This is medium bodied with active carbonation that makes it crisp. Overall, this isn't an overly powerful beer, but it is nicely balanced and is complex.","DeFaz","Sep 11, 2013"

Sweet roasted caramel. The taste is quite good as well. The malt is sweet but has a nice round edge of earthyness. This is one of the best Oktoberfest beers you can find. It's as drinkable with maximum flavor as you can get. Add to that the great price at 8.99 a sixer and you got a winning fall release. My only complaint is its far to early to have this out sitting on the shelves. Mid August would do just fine.

4.66,14.8,5,4,5,5,4.5,"Among the cacophony of Johann Schrammel blaring in the background and the merry yells of the festival crowds, she crosses your sight. She’s a voluptuous beauty who’s had her share of brezen, weisswurts, and obatzda, but she perfectly fills out her dirndl in full. Among all these Marzens, what is it about this one that has you hiding the bulge in your lederhosen? Her dark copper color helps her stand out from the rest as she pours into your glass with the thickness you expected. As soon as you bring her to your lips, she surrounds you with a warm comfort, both familiar and unfamiliar at the same time; her aroma matches evenly with her sweet taste. She is ready for fun and her hearty laugh makes you smile with each sip. After unraveling the strings on her dirndl blouse and voraciously dropping to her knees, you are overwhelmed with her lascivious mouthfeel but also a looming sorrow: this tryst will last but a few days. Alas, Octoberfest wasn’t meant to last all year, so grab her by her thick curves and dive in head first. You might as well: she’s been patiently waiting for you all year with a tankard in one hand and a motel key in the other. As the bacchanalia comes to a close, she quietly slips away into the Munich night; the memories of the copious merriment she leaves behind can only find their match in grandeur in the moist spot she left behind on the bed you shared.","JuniperJesus","Sep 29, 2012"

A strong hint of sweet fruit, chocolate, malt -- really nice. The taste is also sweet -- hints of raisin or dark chocolate. Hoppy. Very clean, crisp taste. Perfect for a Marzen. I find with Oktoberfests, carbonation is the X factor in making a brew a hit or a miss. The carbonation in this one is really pretty perfect -- just a really pleasant, solid beer.

Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense off white head with great retention; that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some decent spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of caramel, pear, biscuit, toast, herbal, floral, and light earthy spiciness. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of biscuit, toast, caramel, pear, herbal, floral, grass, and earthy spiciness. Lingering notes of caramel, biscuit, pear, herbal, and grass on the finish for a bit. Very nice flavor balance and robustness; fairly clean finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy and fairly crisp mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden with pretty much zero warming noticed after the finish. Extremely smooth and easy to drink. Overall this is a highly excellent Oktoberfest. Great flavor balance and very smooth to drink. An easy winner.","superspak","Aug 25, 2012"

4.13,1.7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"O- overall an incredible oktoberfest, and the best I've had in the style in a long time.

The smell is the usual Oktoberfest of caramel, grains, and fruits. The taste starts out with a nice mix of caramel, fruits (apples and pears), grass, and sweet breads with hints of hops that stay from the first sip til the end of the drink. A very well balanced and very smooth, crisp, clean easy to drink beer with a dry finish to it. Overall this is the best Oktoberfest beer I have tasted and highly recommended for anyone that wants a great Oktoberfest beer from one of the best breweries around.","DannyDan","Oct 18, 2011"

It smells like bread and pretzels. There's a medicinal or minty note to it. There's a fruity whiff to it, kind of like apples. It's medium bodied and quite smooth with a sharp, lively finish. It leaves the palate pretty clean. The flavor hovers between sweet and dry, with malt taking the center stage. It's a little resiny, melanoidal, fruity and medicinal. The flavors come together pretty well and nothing seems out of balance. This is one of the most sessionable Oktoberfests I can recall drinking.","yesyouam","Oct 16, 2011"
3.62,-10.8,4.5,2.5,4,3.5,4,"Its October and I am trying Great Lakes Oktoberfest and it is...OK. No question it is a Marzen style beer. The appearance is a rich clear amber with thick white head that is lacing nicely. There is not much smell other than typical...sweet malt, grain. The taste is ok...not sure if I like the sweetness or not. There is a nice malt base that helps to keep the beer grounded. The ABV initially is a bit much, but after a few swigs one begins to settle in. 6.5% is a bit much for a Marzen so the mouthfeel is downgraded slightly. Overall its decent....better than most.","WoodBrew","Oct 15, 2011"

3.89,-4.2,3,4,4,3.5,4,"Great Lakes Oktoberfest pours a crystal clear burnt orange, lightening in spots to straight orange when held up to light. There's about two fingers of ivory foam topping the beer, but it fades quickly and without a trace. The nose has prominent notes of toasted bread and nuts, with some caramel and a lightly herbal/spicy hop presence in the mix as well. Those four fill out the flavor profile as well. The hops are a bit more subdued, the caramel a bit elevated, and bitterness is barely there, but the general idea from the aroma is the same. The mouthfeel is just a little bit too crisp, which I'm chalking up to a body that's a touch on the light side. I'd like the beer to be a bit more rounded and full.

This was one of best Oktoberfests I've had the pleasure of drinking. I do not believe my palate has changed that much in a year. Perhaps the beer last year was past it's prime.

Smooth, delicate and mellow feel with assertive carbonation d and a light, biting tanginess at the finish.

It gave aromas of light caramel malts, light bready malts, a light hop bitterness, and a nice touch of honey. It had a great nose for an Oktoberfest. The flavors mimicked the aromas and it was very appealing for the style. It was a little bolder than the every day Marzen. It was really apparent how fresh the keg was, having just arrived a few days earlier. The flavors were sharp and on point. It drank very light and was ultimately smooth.

The nose gives the first indication that this example is going to be stylistically excellent. Hints of rich malt and a touch of German noble hops come through. Flavors coming through on the palate are equally splendid. Munich malty goodness is prevalent, rendering one with the feeling of walking through a beer garden in Munich. The finish is medium-dry, allowing for a high level of drinkability. An extremely well-crafted German seasonal. My favorite overall domestic Oktoberfest.","CuriousMonk","Jan 14, 2011"

The retention was so-so, the lacing quite thin, to my surprise. The aroma was of sweet malt, caramel malt and some lights spices including hints of vanilla. The flavors were a combination of toasted malt, dry grains, some chewy, bread-like malts and a bit of biscuits. The hops did follow through in the end but had trouble keeping up with the array of malts. Still, given that this is a malt-heavy style of beer I had to admire the emphasis and depth of the malts on display. The mouthfeel was slick, the body medium and the carbonation medium/low.","thekevlarkid","Jan 04, 2011"

Laces with authority. Bit of a light cheesy quality to the extensively toasted grain aroma. Not overly malty and certainly no significant hop notes to smell, either, though some fruitiness shows through in the scent as well. The Munich malt does shape the profile of the flavor, which, as I mentioned before, isn't heavily malty, but does display some biscuit / spice wafer qualities, that mysterious grassy cheesiness, and finishes with an apple sweetness and tiny medicinal burst in the very end. Carbonation is above-average, thinning its medium body a bit. A thin-syrupy, malty ""tang"" lingers in the back and sides of the mouth. Pretty good all-around.","Bouleboubier","Nov 27, 2010"

Some breadiness from malt and some very sight orange. On inhale of beer in throat, pick up a big hint of jello (maybe cherry). Same thing on actual flavor. Some breadiness, some lagery sweetness, but still predominantly jello, coud be something in the growler perhaps.

The aroma is a sort of swampy-skunk bread with earthy peanut malt. A bit odd to say the least, perhaps a little scary. Fortunately it translates into a perfectly fine Oktoberfest burst of malty flavor. Over the malt I get leafy hop and a hint of bready toffee that provides a classic German idea that is medium bodied, crisp and easy drinking.

Hops are very low keyed if detectable at all. Low hops even compared to most of the German standards. The body is a little larger than what is typical. Looking at the ABV I am not surprised.

It's definitely malty, bready, with generous amounts of Munich malts, but the sweetness becomes a bit cloying for me. OFests are good when they're sweet, but normally they dry out on the finish, which this doesn't. Bitterness is light and somewhat floral. Mouthfeel is medium, but there's a huge lack of carbonation.

The maple comes through in the taste, along with toffee, walnut, green apple, and a sort of woody bitterness. Not what I've come to expect from an Oktoberfest necessarily, but not all that bad either.

The aroma is woodsy and leafy, but with a good toasted malt character, kind of like toasted artisanal bread. It starts out with a good toffee malt flavor that is slightly sweet. The finish has a bit of a kick; it almost feels like there is a slight alcohol burn, but since this is only a 6.5% ABV beverage, I'm guessing it's some finishing hops that cause this sensation. The beer has a full body; each sip feels like a real mouth full of beer. It leaves behind a good amount of coating on both my lips and in my mouth. The carbonation is felt, but it isn't too prominent. It's a very drinkable beer.

Strong burst of cocoa, milk chocolate powder and caramel to the nose, honeyed graham crackers, malty to the exclusion of most hoppiness, no citrus or grass notes, touch of pepperiness. Medium-bodied, somewhat sluggish mouth presence, the carbonation is round and not that refreshing. That said, good depth to the honey, caramel, cocoa flavors without pushing the sweetness too far. Here you get more orange citrus bite as well as a grainy edge, even some poor minerally earth. Smattering of peach, pear, apple fruit, not a player.

The pour produced a respectable lager head and a good quality lager smell. The crystal-clear orange color was lighter than I would have expected for the style, and similarly the taste, while pleasant, was also more like an amber lager than an oktoberfest beer. Somewhat malty, flavor with suggestions of toasted bread and a slight sour note. For the style I would have expected more malt, more body, and maybe a little less hops at the end. That said, this is a pleasant beer with substantial character, and I look forward to savoring my remaining bottles.","neobassman","Sep 01, 2009"

The bread comes out strong at the beginning of each taste. Then midway a yeasty tanginess, then finishing with mild bitterness of eath and grass, but nothing overwhelming. A watery feel at the start, but it gradually becomes fuller in body as it rolls across the palate. A bit of crispness from the carbonation at the end.

4.18,3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Found on-on tap at (of all places) Cheapside's. The bottle proved to be a world-class brew, so I had high hopes for the tap. The golden-copper-orange brew came out with a very froathy, withstanding head retention thats tough to fight through. The aromas are somewhat light, but are very yeasty, bready, malty, with just a touch of refreshing hops. Tastes very malty without the caramel or toffee sweetness. Malts are so rich that the hops, esters, and alcohol take a really far back seat. This is undoubtedly the most malty-textured Oktoberfest that I have had. Very rich textued, creamy, and soft. Finishes malty and firm. Could this beer be too malty?","BEERchitect","Sep 15, 2007"
4.21,3.7,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured into a mug a nice amber that shows orange when held to light. The beer is topped by a nice frothy off-white head that slowly diminishes to a ring but still leaves great lacing on the glass. Aroma shows some sweet malts and citrus hops, but is not that strong. The taste is a nice blend of sweet caramel and sweet fruits against a decent citrus hop backbone that stays where it belongs for the style; in the background. The beer is rather light bodied with low carbonation. This is without question one of the best I've had of the style.","atsprings","Sep 13, 2007"

4.18,3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"This review is from notes taken from my recent visit to the Great Lakes brewpub this past Saturday (9/1/07). Served in a big mug (around 3 beers worth, I guess), the beer poured a nice amber color with about an inch off-white head. It smelled sweet, like caramel and toasted malt, along with some toffee and some spicyness as well. Taste was pretty similar to the aroma. Mouthfeel was light/medium, and very smooth. Drinkability was very good as well, it's very, very easy to drink on tap. I reviewed this beer from the bottle a couple weeks ago, and I think it's better on tap. It's much smoother and it tastes better as well in my opinion. If you get a chance to go up to GLBC and try this on tap, you should.","bluejacket74","Sep 07, 2007"

It has a very smooth, malt flavor that is light with just the right amount of sweetness. It goes down easy and finishes a bit dry with some earthy character. The mouthfeel is excellent.

Toasted pale and munich malt in the nose, with faint hallertau notes. Rich munich flavor upfront, follwed by toasted amber malt and a well-placed hallertau flavor. Dextrins and noble hop bitterness make-up the slightly drying aftertaste, and I like that there is more hop flavor than bitterness, and more biscuity malt taste than sweetness. The lighter carbonation and moderate body allow a creamy mouthfeel that is a good medium of crisp to slick. The finish is a touch residual, with plenty of german hop character to match. This has a superb drinkability, and is balanced through and through.","PBRstreetgang","Sep 11, 2006"
4.35,7.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured a nice caramel color with a small frothy head with good sustain. A gentle malty smell set the tone for a big malt flavor, yet without the sometimes cloying sweetness that can result in brews like this. A subtle nutty flavor added some depth to the taste. The body was medium-light and creamy with moderate carbonation. A great offering from a consistently outstanding brewery. Go find some for yourself.","klewis","Sep 07, 2006"
3.9,-3.9,4,4,3.5,4,4.5,"On tap and poured into my new and now beloved liter stein at the 2006 Great Lakes Oktoberfest. The place was packed (two and a half hour wait when we walked in at 9pm!), but we did manage grab a table in the pub for a few hours before heading across town for a late bite. Back to the beer, I was immediately struck by the color, clarity, and impressive head. Indeed this brew is quite the looker. Pours a crystal clear coppered, orange leaning, amber with minimal carbonation, and a thick, voluminous light brown head. Retention is top notch. Aroma is stylistically correct but a touch light to my preferences. Notes of caramel syrup, Vienna/German malts, and that very autumn, almost pumpkin like smell associated with Marzens were all present but on the faint side. Flavor was caramel and toast, very German and autumnal but again a bit light. Subtle amounts of raisins, a very light fruitiness, and a brushing of hops finishes off the job. Body is medium, lightly carbonated, and rich with out any muddling or lack of cleanliness. Drinability is through the roof. Very nice example of an Oktoberfest. Would drink again if given the opportunity.","DaPeculierDane","Sep 05, 2006"
