"Poured from bottle. Amber color with a thin white head. Herbal hop and spice notes on the nose with a bubblegum aroma that won’t fade. Malty, toasted overtones, with hints of corn and herbs. Finishes bright and dry."

""
"O: not all that bad for an American version of this... I could drink a few of them... but, for being one of the better domestic takes, what are they missing? the water? the process (decoction)? proprietary yeast? freshness of ingredients?"
""
"Would I buy it again? No."

"BBD 1/12/15.  Clear amber pour with a very nice dark ruby cast. Slightly above normal head volume, average retention and superior lacing.  Light nose of biscuit with caramel notes over a light herbal/floral hop aroma.  Medium bodied with a nice slick texture.  Above normal carbonation with a good bit of effervescence in the middle and on the finish.  The flavor profile is reasonably intense, somewhat complex and well balanced.  It begins with toasty biscuit malt then flows into a mild caramel sweetness.  The middle is slightly bitter with a nutty/spicy note.  The finish is a bit crisp and leaves you with a lingering toasted grainy note.  A good Oktoberfest."

"O- ok but not one of my favs.  worth a try but not worth a purchase of a sixer."

"Nice dark amber taste with slight hop. Definitely one of the better oktoberfest fall beers. A little more unique than Sam Adams Octoberfest."

"Pours a deep aged copper with a short-lasting hear. Ever so slight lacing. The aroma is mild but moderately complex, with nice caramel malt, a little fruit, and a bit of earth. Unfortunately once the head burns away, so does the aroma, leaving almost nothing. The taste is adequate, but not terribly interesting. It lacks both the robust malt or the counter-balancing hops. There's a decent weight to the body but a bit too much carbonation. Somewhere between OK and good."

"Ok brew. Definitely my least favorite of all of the Flying Dog brews. Maybe I am not the biggest Marzen fan, but here goes....Pours dark gold, beautifully clear. Head is good and lacing is nice. Aroma is malty and so is the taste, malt sweetness and slightly crisp with only a slight aftertaste"
"Solid marzen. Coppery in color and in taste even. No odd notes. Medium body. Not quite session-y, but I'd have a few if you're buying."
""
"01/02/13 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Good solid beer. Balanced. Thirst quenching. A tad heavy for a session, but works well into a mix."
"O:  Lots of Belgian flavors here, from the esters to the ripe bananas, but on all on a nice light even scale."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours copper red with a nice head. Smells of dark roasted malt with some fruitiness. Tastes of dark roasted malt but with a watery aftertaste. Beer is very carbonated, light bodied, drinkable. Overall a slightly above average beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A good option for an oktoberfest choice, very medium bodied, drinkable, and with a pleasant bready kick on the finish."
""
"Overall: This is another excellent, excellent American version of an Oktoberfest-style beer! Beautifully crafted, beautifully balanced, beautifully flavored. This is one of my favorite American Oktoberfest beers! Simply delicious!!"

"Serving Type - 12 oz bottle"

"A reasonable stab at a märzen, though it doesn't hold a candle to an authentic German brew. Looks OK, while the aroma and flavour are pleasant in a fairly non-descript sort of way. Mostly malt and little else. Body is alright. I reckon bottle conditioning would have added depth. Drinkable enough but hardly outstanding. Worth sampling, though no need to go out of your way to find it."
"The light and toasty body makes for a pleasant Oktoberfest quaff - even though ""There is saurkraut in my lederhosen."""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: not a bad marzen, could maybe do it again but there so much better out there. Doesn't hurt to try it at least once. Salud!"
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a copper color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some malts are present. Taste is malty, biscuits, some sweetness,a touch of caramel at the finish, very easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"Served in a 16 oz pint glass at the Pourhouse, Westmont, NJ"

"Overall, a decent example of the style."

"O: Yes it's pretty good, but this is not true to the style. The bottle clearly says ""ale"" Oktoberfests are lagers. Points taken away for that. Aside from me being so picky, this is a pretty good beer."

"Flying Dog Dogtoberfest pours a polished amber, lightening a bit around the edges. I feel as though clarity could be just a little bit better though for a German style lager. Maybe two fingers of cream colored head crowns the beer and manages to stick around for a minute or two. Lacing is a bit spotty though. The nose has some nice malt aromas, though I think it could stand to have a bit less caramel and more bread/biscuit character. The flavor profile delivers on that, it's much more biscuity, with just a little bit of caramel. Unfortunately the malt aspect passes altogether too quickly, making room for a soft bitterness and an earthy, lightly spicy hoppy finish. The body does a marvelous job of staying light and crisp despite the malt presence in the beer, and the carbonation adds just a bit of life to the beer. Great mouthfeel all around. It's not quite perfect, But Flying Dog's rendition of a marzen is one of the better beers from them that I've had."

"Only indication of bottling date is a stamp of 362A12 on the bottom of the label."

"O - caramel heavy, not a bad beer for the style, I wouldn't seek this out lest I'm truly in the mood for a marzen"
""
""
"O- Nice marzen, not bad."
"Overall - Good beer, though not sure it necessarily fits in well as an Okto/Marzen brew; it's certainly not your standard fare for the style. In the very least, it's an enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
"O- a solid example of the style that's worth trying but nothing really sets it apart from its other American counterparts."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: pretty different from a standard marzen. The sourness that I seem to get from this genre is more of a tart or sweetness in this one. Not a very exciting or repeatable beer."
"D - A nice mal character and enough hops to keep it in style, it may be just a touch too sweet, but it is very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer wasn't much to look at, but it had a great aroma and taste. Solid mouthfeel too."
""
""
""
""

""

"Pours a clear dark orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, toast, and caramel. Taste is much the same with a slight fruity flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good peer that is pretty tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Very solid Marzen."
""
""
"Tasting the beer, the beer reminds me more of an ale, rather than a Festbier. Yet the roasted malt which is pretty much the front, is kept in check by some earthy hop. The middle is of a strong caramel, tofee character and makes this beer a sweet one. The finish is a combination of the above and makes this beer a very drinkable, medium bodied brew. I am just not so sure of the style, but I guess it not that important as long we can enjoy it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall its light tasty and easy drinking. Good for an Oktoberfestival but not so much the Oktobefest beer connoisseur. Not as true to the style as it could be."
""
""
"This beer has a fairly strong caramely finish, certainly too sweet for the style. This is probably because they are using ale yeasts and lower attenuation fermentations. Poured with very little head even though I got a little aggressive at the end as I saw weak head formation. Since this style doesn't mormally pour with a big head I wasn't too concerned. First couple sips were pretty good but the overly sweet malt characteristic started to poke through as the temp warmed up. We drank this beer with a few other domestic O'fests and we rated it last...Lakefront, Brooklyn and Schlafly's were all significantly better - and all of those are lagers. I usually like FlyingDog's beers (except for the IPA's) but this is one I can't recommend."
""
""
""
""
"When i poured thsi beer into a pint glass, it has nice rich amber colored body to it with no head. The smell is nice and malty. The taste has a nice rich malt flavor and as it warms up i get a hint of roastyness to it, and on the back of the tongue a little bit of hops but not much though. The mouthfeel is really good and overall a good o-fest/marzen beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"EDIT: I'm liking this more as it warms up. The malt flavors and pretty layered and complex actually. Still not what I want in an Octofest though."
""
""
""
"O-this isn't a good Oktoberfest. It doesn't have much flavor. It might be easy to drink, but it's not something I want to be drinking all night."
""
"The feel is good, as this beer is appropriately light, perhaps medium edging that way, which a uniform smoothness throughout riding off a steady crispness."
"Great character, but it's nothing outstanding in overall quality. Just a fun craft take. I'll remember to turn to this when the faithfuls aren't cutting it or are boring me. I'd have to recommend this one."
""
"Poured a dark amber reddish color small tan colored head. Smells of toasted and roasted malts. Taste slightly sweet caramel, lots of malt flavors, slight bitterness, medium body. Overall tasty Oktoberfest beer, very easy to drink, good buy if fresh and local."
"O: This one's pretty good. I feel it's not the easiest chugger, which is vital in a beer like this, but it features enough of a different character to be worthwhile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a clear standard amber with a flash head that doesn't leave any lacing behind. Smells of floral hopping over toasted white bread and caramel. Tastes more of very light herbal and grassy hopping under a standard and simple caramel and vienna malt. Medium body and carbonation levels. This one is decidedly an average marzen at best."

"Pours a burnt orange color, minimal head, retention and lacing. Scent is sweet caramel and bready up front, a splash of herbs and spice. Taste begins with a sharp astringent note, mellows into a bready and quite sweet beer, light herbal and spice on the end. Medium bodied, lightly oily in texture. Overall, a little sweet and ""off"" when compared to others in the style that I enjoy."

"SOLID, NOT MUST HAVE!"
"O: This is a Märzen, a bit edgier than others. The label states a quote from Hunter S. Thopmson; ""Good people drink good beer""."
"A vigorous pour into a proper mug produces a prodigious head of off white slightly soapy suds with good retention and clumps of lace on the sides. A deep, rich amber and visible carbonation trails stir the imagination of crisp malty refreshment. The nose has lots of malt and mild caramel sweetness. A healthy dose of roasted grains and toasted whole grain goodness implies more than a few malts in the mix. Some hop aromatics give an herbal sharpness. A faint note of butterscotch. Taste is solid. Quite malty with facets of butterscotch and caramelish toffee. Some toasted bread and a firm hops give a decidedly American finish that is crisp, dry, and clean. Toast and breadcrusty malt lingering lightly with a mildly peppery hops signature. Feel is crisp and refreshing with a spot on carbonation for the style making this highly drinkable. Overall a solid take on a popular style. Worth your money and time."
"O-Another run of the mill Oktoberfest. Really nothing that stands out here."
"Overall a very impressive brew for this style, a perfect blending of flavors with a nice mild hop finish."
"A tired (Best before 04.07.12) and somewhat oxidized beer. I’m not impressed."
"O: everything about this beer is fairly forgettable except the label."
"The beer exits the yellow-labeled bottle a stately dark copper color with a bit of foam above it. The foam left a vestige of lacing down the glass. A nice looking brew. The aroma is swimming in deep malt. Some husk mixes with a bit of earthy hops. Richly roasted malt on the palate. The sweet grain sloshes around the palate leaving much to be enjoyed. The dash of bitterness at the end goes a long ways toward balancing the beer. Overall a nicely traditional rendition of the style."
"Overall - I'm not really a fan of this beer."
"Really hearty beer for the season and style"
"Poured a dark copper with a very thin head. It has a bready nose with distinct hints of caramel. The taste is malty, but it lacks the hearty malt flavor of the style. This offering had a crisp and clean finish, but it was a bit thin and left me wanting for something with a bigger punch."
" ~ This isn't my favorite Oktoberfest and it's likely I won't pick it up again. Would I recommend this beer to a friend? Probably not."
"Pours a clear mahogany body a tan head of rich foam that lasts a long time. Smells primarily toasty, with a bit of rotting leaves and cardboard dust thrown in the mix. Vienna malts dominate the flavor profile. Toastiness galore and some toffee or caramel-like sweetness, with a hop profile that is similar to the best German oktoberfests I've tried - earthy and a bit tea-like, even herbaceous as it warms. The body feels a bit lighter than I expected from this style, but overall this is really well-made and an excellent value, especially in comparison to the German O'Fests."
"* also of note the ABV seems to have been increased since this beer was first listed. It is listed as 5.6% on the bottle this year."
"O: A very good choice for the style as a baseline of what O-fest should taste like. I'd certainly take this anytime."
"Overall, a solid example of the style, but a little sweet."
"Overall: A pretty good version of a Marzen from Flying Dog. Full flavored and well balanced."
"Kind of a lackluster beer for me, not my favorite style, but even with that said, still just not anything to write home about."
"Surprisingly not bad. Compared to other octoberfests I've had this one did actually shine, still not as good as Sam though. Pour a dark amber color with a bit of retaining cream colored head, and a little bit of a breads scent. Medium bodied mouth feel with some nice roasted malt taste and a hint of raisins and grapes. Needs a little bit of a balance to the sweetness but im glad to of found another american octoberfest I liked"
"D: good ofest offering from flying dog. decent complexity between sweet malts and very light roasted aspects."
"It is easy drinking, but not something I'll run back for."
"O: great Marzen with some beautiful flavors that mix well."
"D = the drinkablilty is fairly good, probably not an Oktoberfest that I'll seek out, but not bad."
"Very strange. This is not what I expected from this beer. This is just too harsh to be pleasantly drinkable. Needs some more sweetness to balance."
"Sampled from a bottle with no freshness date. Copper orange in color with yellow hues on the edge of the glass and a bit hazy. Poured with a soapy off white foam that rdeuced to a thick cap. Toasted bready grain aromas with light caramel malt and with a light herbal hop aroma beneath . Smooth, wet, mellow feel. Toasted grain and hint of caramel malt and bread flavors up front with and herbal hop tanginess in the middle to the finish. Finishes a bit dry with a lingering light herbal/pine hoppiness. More hop character than most marzens I've tried."
"The Rest: Meh. An OK marzen with some weirdness on the back end that ruins it for me."
"O: Decent beer, but not very complex a tad too thick for this style for my liking."
"A good malty dog, possible a bit sweet."
"I'd say this has the weakest taste profile of the three. It's light and watery at first with some bitterness on the back end. It'd be easy to slam down a few, if you didn't get bored along the way. It's just an average brew."
"The best thing about this beer is the label and quote by Hunter S. Thompson, stating ""Good people drink good beer."" Pour a nice copper reddish hue with average lacing and carbonation. Some roasted malt backbone and with a little lemon zest. Medium body but missing some toasty sweetness."
"While Oktoberfest's are not my favorite beer, I know a good one when I have one, and this is a very well brewed example of the style. Not my cup of tea, but try it."
"Overall I could enjoy this no problem, it's not a favorite but sure isn't hard to swallow either. I would prefer more malt than the hop bent on this for the style but that's just me. Cheers!"
"Overall - Actually one of the better Marzens I've had. Good taste, pleasant mouthfeel. Good job by Flying Dog"
"Overall: Not too bad for an American Oktoberfest. This is a smooth beer that is perfect for the cooler nights that are starting to creep in here in the North East (and the recent freaking earthquake and upcoming hurricane!!) The 5.6 ABV is respectable. Cheers!!"
"This is a great Oktoberfest offering from Flying Dog. I may have mentioned - I work right down the road from Flying Dog’s brewery in Frederick, so yeah I’m a little partial. This is a great beer regardless."
"This poured out as a nice looking light brown color with a fizzy tan color heads on top. The head doesn't give off much lacing here but the aroma had plenty of autumn spice to it. The taste of the beer is a malty and slightly sweet upfront then it fades into a warming spice aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium I think, it's carbonated well. Overall it's a pretty decent Oktoberfest in my opinion."
"o- This was the first octoberfest i had this year. I was fairly impressed by it. It is definetly a beer I can recommend to friends. It is not hard to drink either so, I could drink more then one if tempted too. Flying Dog has a great line of beers. I am glad i tried this one. ""Good people drink good beer"""
"No head on this beer, Has a rusty color with slight lacing. Even with the low ABV on this beer it still somehow leaves a strong alcohol taste on your tongue. The one thing i did like about this beer was how easy it goes down the ole hatch. Overall it is not my favorite beer by any means and i probably wont get it again. Just based on personal prefferance."
"Overall - an OK beer I suppose. Not one of the better Marzen's that I've tried however. Whoever Flying Dog claims learned how to make this style while in German, needs to go back for a remedial course."
"Nice sweetness/bitterness balance. It is a very unidimensional but easy-drinking brew."
"Code 344FX10. Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured red-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, spices, and lemon zest. The flavor was of sweet malt, lemon zest, nutmeg, and slight spices. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. Not my favorite of the style at all. The lemon zest was a nice addition to this one though. With it being 'aged' for so long this one really wasn't that bad if I'm honest. Worth trying once, but that is about it."
"Coppery amber with a creamy blonde head that leaves little blobs of lace on the glass. The aroma is malty and sweet with a touch of herbal hoppiness. Sweet biscuit malt with a touch of citric hop notes in the finish. Medium light bodied with smooth, lush carbonation. A decent brew from Flying Dog."
"O - A little bit one dimensional but a solid brew."
"Taste has a strong malt backbone, more spiciness than the usual Oktoberfest beer, carbonation is right on, the breadiness of this beer is a bit too high, the hop presence seems a bit stale."
"Pretty octoberfest beer. Deep amber color, almost brown. Smell is the most striking part of this beer and it seems as if a lot of time was taken in this part of the beer. Sweetness, almost cloyingly so, and caramel are abundant in the aroma. They go together well and create an excellent entrance for a taste that is similar. Its sweet at first, followed by a caramel that is almost too much and takes a little away from the overall experience. Finishes dry in the back of the mouth, but caramelly and sweet all the way including the aftertaste. Mouthfeel isn't perfect and feels a little too carbonated. Drinkability is cut a little short by the sweetness, but overall this is a good beer."
"The beer had a caramel malt aroma, some barley, and a mix of citrus and earthy hops. It had a slightly dark amber-orange color, which was mostly clearer, with an average-sized, foamy white head. The flavor was mostly sweet and malty, with a touch of bitterness from the hops. Average wetness and body, with moderate carbonation and a somewhat full mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: Enough interest to keep sipping, not enough to seek it out again."
"The aroma is very malty. I get a lot of toffee and iced tea notes, as well as a little bit of grassyness. The flavor is more of the same with lots of toffee, caramel and grass. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Overall I am impressed with this beer. I was not expecting much from this beer but it was damn good. I like that it has all the stereotypical flavors of an Oktoberfest beer but it had a bit of bitterness to balance out the sweetness."
"D: Party in a glass. A damn fine version. Not overly complex, but very robust with a great depth to its malty richness. Great balance in a rich and hefty way. A rather beefy but very drinkable Oktoberfest."
"Pours a nice amber with a nice tan head. Aroma of caramel malt, some yeast. Taste is same as aroma. Palate is medium body with moderate carbonation. Finish is sweet malty caramel some breadiness. Overall a descent drinkable and sessionable octoberfest"
"The beer pours a copper amber hue, with a frothy white head. The aroma is very interesting. The aroma smells noble and yet fruity at the same time. The taste is of biscuits or bread at first, turning more into a caramel taste. I dont notice the hops at all in this beer. The mouthfeel is a medium light feel, and I would say this is a drinkable beer."
"D - Not bad, but certainly not the best Oktoberfest I've had. Glad to try it but I won't seek it out again."
"D: Quite drinkable in that there's nothing really offensive about it and it goes down easy, but I'm reaching for something better after one of these."
"Poured into a pilsner glass. Color is a rusty amber with a good head and nice ringy lacing on the way down. Nose is caramel, toast, and some floral hops. Taste is mostly malt without too much depth. Good medium body. A nice Fall beer."
"I was quite pleasantly surprised by this one; a real authentic tasting Marzen from one of the bigger US breweries is a very welcome thing. Cheap ($8 a 6 pack here) and a superb buy. I'll be on the lookout for more next year!"
"Easy drinkable."
"A solid Octoberfest and very underated. I found this beer to be more in line with traditional Marzens than an American interpretation. Wish i could find more of it."
"Drink- I think in my opinion there is a war in this bottle being waged between hops and the malt. I think thats where the taste comes from. Its been a long time since I had a malt as a kid and that seems to be where I am coming back too. I could probably do 2 or 3 in a session of these. Not too shabby Flying Dog."
"drinkability- this beer has a decent balance to it and decently sweet dry balance, overall its not for some reason mind blowing but its certainly and inoffensive example of the style, a bit to heavy and dull for me to i think sitting around drinking it all nite long but not bad example of the marzen style which to be fair i think at this point of the year im now finally burnt out on a bit so maybe give this one another look in beginning of next season"
"Drinkability: Very easy drinking."
"Drinkability: Overall, this is more of your hops vs. malt type of Octoberfest which is rare to be seen, yet Flying Dog is able to pull it off with a good amount of balance between the two. The earthy hop notes balance nicely into the malty backbone making this a smooth, refreshing, yet drinkable beer. At 5.3% ABV, it's a good session beer and can be easily drank in quantity. I'd be more than happy to sit on the patio on a cool fall night and drink this one!"
"overall: I really like Flying Dog beers but this one I cant stand! my first disappointing Flying Dog Beer is this!"
"D - Flying dog continues to impress me and this is a great rep of the style. Will have it again."
"Overall, the darkest, strongest tasting oktoberfest I have had yet, and also one of the most alcoholic. It's not a drink all night sort of beer, but it's quite enjoyable nonetheless."
"Drinkability - Nice complexity and good taste, albeit slightly more bitter than I'd normally like. Nice brew."
"Clean and clear aroma with hints of nuts, floral and somewhat buttery. Appearance is a nice clear amber with minimal head. A slightly bitter taste with medium sweet undertones and a slightly bitter after taste. Body is medium and an average amount of carbonation. Atypical Marzen done well."
"Taste-Big dose of sweet-toasted malt, caramel, and a subtle, herbal hop bite that keeps things from getting to cloying."
"Flying Dog Dogtoberfest is a nice little surprise. For a brewery better known for their ales, this is a very solid Octoberfest beer. It's a clear polish bronze with eggshell foam. The smell and taste is rich, bready malty and herbal hops that complement each other well. Unlike other Marzens that can be either too thin or overly malty, this is a very nice balance and just sweet enough. Carbonation is good and the beer has a nice aftertaste."
"a beer I could have a few of, but after this one, not really sure I would. Might have to try again to see if I can get a bottle with better carbonation. taste is ok, and it being light bodied, I could easily have 3-4. I have had much better Oktoberfest beers however."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and is quite sessionable."
"Notes: This is one of the better dark Oktoberfest beers I have had this year. I can see this pairing very well with traditional Oktoberfest food. I know I am craving a big pretzel with mustard right now."
"Fairly decent for the style... Not bad at all... I would probably grab another if offered..."
"Drinkability: A farily average O-fest, but still good overall and worth a drink."
"D: This is a good interpretation of an American style Marzen. Nice flavor and very drinkable."
"Smooth, refreshing and uncommonly drinkable. Spot on for a Marzen: full bodied, rich and toasty. Prost!"
"One of the few beers I like to try out of the bottle this time of year. Immediately poured with a nice head but it unfortunately dissipated quickly leaving little lace. Pretty light with the mouth feel. Biggest disappointment was an average finish. Not a good this year as in past -- but better than most."
"Due to being at a guest's house, I drank this from the bottle; not as hearty as other Marzen's I've tried, but very drinkable; not harsh...I was expecting a bit more zing (read: flavor). Good for drinking with food, but a bit lacking in flavor for my tastebuds."
"Sampled on September 25, 2010. The pour is a nice amber color with decent clarity and in the tall glass, a good four inch head that slowly diminishes. Malts greet the nose on the first whiff with both bitter and sweet sensations. The taste tended to be on the yeasty side with a pleasing bitter maltiness thrown in for good measure. This was very drinkable and had some nice character."
"D= I like this one a lot. While it might not be to a tee the style guidelines it is very very tasty. Worth checking out for sure."
"D: Good stuff. Easy to drink. A flavorful, moderate session brew for the fall months. I'll most likely have this again."
"D - Nothing special here. It's not hard to drink though and it tastes fine."
"Drinkability is up only due to the low abv."
"I love octoberfest beers and I love Flying Dog, I think they are one of the best Micro's around. Their version of the octoberfest is not anything impressive but it is pretty tasty. You may drink one and not like it, but give it a second try. It has a great taste and has great drinkability for those fall football days."
"Had a bottle for $3.50 at Liberty St Tavern. I've been meaning to try this for a while, but wasn't terribly impressed. While most O-fest are wonderfully balanced, I found the sweetness to border on cloying. I wouldn't order another, this beer needs to be dried out. There was a fruity caramel taste that was just over the top in what would have otherwise been a decent beer."
"D: Hits mid-range for the style -- not really one to go looking for."
"pours a dark amber color with very little head that leaves a beige ring,, smell is kinda stale with malts and biscuits,,taste is better is lots of malts some sweet caramel mixed with spices like nutmeg cinnamon..vienna malts..mouth feel is medium with low carbonation and an earthy taste. not my favorite 4 the style and will be a one and done 4 me..its just average drinkable with an average taste ..i will say to try however"
"Pours a beuatiful amber with a big foamy/fluffy head which slowly recedes to what looks like congealed butter... quite a different look. Smells strongly of brown sugar/caramel, pumpkin spice and yeast with matching taste profile. I find it quite tasty. The mouthfeel, is a light carbonation on a medium bodied beer. This beer gets tastier as its temperature climbs."
"Perhaps the seasonal spice of these beers tend to get lost in a sort of 'mud' on the toungue, but in this case, whatever distinctive taste Flying Dog may have been looking for did come through in this brew."
"Overall it is middle of the road, probably lacks a bit too much punch to be a second return."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium with ample carbonation. Probably the best part of this beer. Overall, this was drinkable and enjoyable. The lack of head, poor expression in the nose, and few off-flavors kept this one from scoring higher. However, it's not bad for a marzen/Octoberfest and would be a decent choice for tailgating or enjoying the brisk autumn weather."
"Overall maybe a bit better than average marzen, but nothing spectacular. Maybe a bit too much bitter earthy lemon hop for my taste, but that's splitting hairs."
"I can tell that it would be a really drinkable beer but with the low carbonation it kind of detracts from it."
"d 3 the big caramel i missed in SA from years back is here in spades. this and hacker were my favorites of the season after a bottle or two of each. the syrupy quality of this beer, though, and a slight yeasty off flavor of some sort, wear on me until i can't stand it anymore."
"little surprised with this one"
"D: The first one tastes nice but I'm not sure how many I would want. The mouthfeel is really what kills this beer in my mind."
"Paired very well with my expensive and elite kraft mac n' cheese."
"Out of the bottle, pours an orange copper, clear brew with a good foamy head. Toasted malt abound, caramel for sure, and a touch of grape--or something reminiscent of white wine. Feels smooth with a medium, well-balanced body, crisp and well carbonated. The toasted character of the malt is most distinctive, but it leaves room for the sweetness of the caramel, a touch of bitter wheat. A little simplistic, but a well-crafted beer with enough body to stay interesting and very drinkable."
"D. A relatively good beer from Flying Dog and one that I would be happy to drink a few of."
"Small carbonation, very soda-esque. Not digging it. I could drink a few of these, but I particularly want to."
" I had a fresh batch of this brew and I liked it very much. This was also at a 5.6% ABV."
"drinkability: has the style of the Märzen down right, without trying to imitate to the point of over-embellishing the harvest characteristics; very enjoyable."
"nice for the style. would have again"
"It poured a copper color with a nice white head. It has a very strong malt smell and flavor. It was a lot sweeter than I was expecting. There was a little bit of the alcohol coming through at the end. It had a nice creamy mouthfeel. One I would drink again if they were to make it again."
"""Ein Bier, das genug für Hunde gut ist, mögen uns."" Meaning, a beer good enough for dogs like us. Certainly one of the more tame brews from Flying Dog--sometimes staying true to style goes a long way."
"D: Filling and a long lingering taste"
"Was always a little turned off of Flying Dog because of artwork and labels and ideas but they can really brew."
"M/D - Very drinkable Oktoberfest from Flying Dog. Medium bodied but very smooth on the tongue with no real aftertaste, I can taste some pine but it goes away rather quick. Sweet caramel malt taste mixed with spices. A brew that I can enjoy again. Really surprised that it was still in the cooler at my local MGM. It was only a single but I'm glad I grabbed it anyway. Will look for it next fall! A great brew to try and share!"
"Too big and rich for an Oktoberfest/Marzen, which is supposed to be a very sessionable style. However, I haven't marked it down too much, as it is still a very tasty, drinkable beer. I'd take this over the 6% helles lagers that call themselves Oktoberfests."
"D: This is more of a summer beer than an Oktoberfest. Doesn't really hold up to many of the expectations of the style. Is this a Marzen for those who don't like Marzens?"
"A medium amber color poured in the glass, with a light tan head a quarter inch high. The head dissolves away slowly, leaving a thin layer on top. A bread and biscuit fragrance comes out at the front, with touches of pine, grass, and earth, that stays with the nose for awhile. The malt comes out at the front of each taste with the bread flavor, a touch caramel as well. Then a mild bitterness comes in halfway with grass and grapefruit, that lingers on the back of the palate. A strong Octoberfest, bringing that beautiful color, the bemalty, but biting aroma, then add the classic flavor and feel, you have an excellent fall beer."
"The body is medium and has some nice sizzle from the carbonation. Not stellar but a very drinkable brew. The finish is sweet has a nice caramel note to it but I find myself yawning after 1/4 of it. I say pass, there are better versions of this style."
"A smooth, full beer with lots of malt character. Plenty of bitterness playing in here. I couldn't drink a lot of this simply due to the way it all fits together. Not bad."
"Notes: Not one of my favorite Oktoberfests, but nothing really wrong with it. It is just a little different in ways that I would rather it stay similar to other O-fests."
"A nice amber color pour with a small sized off white head that had a good hangtime then faded to leave a slight lace behind.The aroma was malty with a slight hint of caramel and possibly some faint hops in there as well.The flavor was much better then i thought it might be.Nice malty side that comes off as being mildly sweet at times with a shade of caramel and a decent hop presence coming on towards the end. Medium body with a crisp clean mouthfeel . Quite sessionable and a pretty good offering ."
"Drinkability: Not my sort of Oktoberfest beer, a bit too sweet. The sweetness is slightly sickly and hinders the drinkability a bit."
"Pours a dark clear reddish amber with a fairly thick and persistent off-white head. Aroma is malty and has an undertone of caramel and a hint of yeast. Flavor is richly malty, a little hoppy, slightly yeasty, slightly bitter with a touch of caramel and a whisper of sweetness. Texture is fairly smooth and a little fizzy."
"D: Not a horrible beer, not undrinkable, just a bit average."
"This beer poured out a clean and crisp caramel brown color with a nice frothy white head. the aroma had the distinct lager smell mixed in with hints of caramel and sweet syrup. the taste came in with a nice toasty malt profile and a bit of sulfury/lagery taste followed up by a pleasent caramely sweetnes. the beer finished a little warm with delicate toasty/biscut malts haning on the tongue. it is no wonder this beer has won itself a gold for the last two years at GABF, great example of the style!"
"Overall a decent marzen. A bit too spicy for my tastes. I'm glad we are almost through with the fall seasonals. I think I'm about done with this style for a bit."
"M - A little flat, but it doesn't ruin my overall enjoyment of the beer."
"T- Nice European-style Oktoberfest. It has a nice spiciness to it and a beautiful crispness as well. Excellent Oktoberfest."
"This is one of the darkest looking oktoberfests i have seen, even for american versions. It is much more like an amber ale than and oktoberfest. Its got great weight and full flavored but its not an oktoberfest so I have to rate it accordingly. I would maybe go half a point higher on each criteria if it werent labeled oktoberfest. Overall though, a good brew but i wouldnt reccommend if your looking for a traditional oktoberfest."
"D-Quite drinkable, easily deserving of sessionable fest status."
"A decent little O-Fest here, if not a bit too sticky sweet in the taste and feel at times. I didn't have much of a problem finishing the bottle off but I'm not so sure if I would want to go to this again and again though."
"Overall, a nice fest. Well worth seeking out."
"Snappy, crisp malty body with a slightly dry, almost sour twang to the finish. Hints of pumpkin pulp and graham cracker thrown in the mix as well, while the hops add a healthy dose of bitterness to the backside of the palate. Great carbonation level, while the medium-thin mouthfeel makes for a smooth, refreshing sip. Wow, who would've thought the first Oktoberfest to truly impress me (and I've tried half a dozen or so) would be from Flying Dog? Not I, but I'm glad it is so."
"I'd had always thought that I enjoyed the Spaten Ofest the most out of the category. But this beer really took me for a ride and made me wonder about that. As opposed to the malty sweetness and faint hopiness that accompanies so many other October beers, this one brings to the table a great complexity. There is some grape musk yeastiness in the nose. And bitterness and ale like fruitiness on the tongue. The mouthfeel is just right- thick but leaving you wanting another drink- it's dryer than the style usually is, but that works really well for this beer. And the beer on the whole is one that is as easily swilled out of a stein, or sipped from a pint while analyzing its finer qualities. Delicious."
"Despite the final score, this is actually a good pick for the season. Dogtoberfest sets the bar for the other three beers here in the American Oktoberfest Invitational, which will resume tonmorrow with another beer."
"Drinkability - 3.5/5.0 - Good beer, especially for October/cooler temps"
"D - Good. This is tasty and it goes down quickly."
"Highly carbonated in the mouthfeel. Good drinkability. I prefer the more standard O-fests, but this was an interesting twist."
"I do like to have some sweeter beer like this one on hand, cuz its a natural in my typical spicy/sweet chicken thigh marinade concoction"
"D - Very drinkable, does not fill you up and makes you want more. Good taste and enjoyable all around."
"D: Very Drinkable. Perfect to session with."
"D: Easy going Marzen, would easily buy another case of this..."
"Cheers!!"
"A good beer, but I don't know if I love it. I'd like to have it again because it has some neat things going for it but doesn't really pull the whole package together for me"
"Probably one of the worst Flying Dog products I have had. Way too sweet and just pretty unremarkable overall. Also, heavy on the earthy notes, which I don't like in Octoberfest beers at all. Not really worth the time unless you are a fan of the style."
"In my Oktoberfest tasting, I still think I liked Victory's Festbier a little bit better, but this is a close second."
"Again, at first this is nothing impressive--but it warms up as time goes on...just as a nice Marzen should. Unfortunately, I got a slight metallic taste that would not go away."
"D - As with most fest beers this one is made for going down real easy."
"D: Good American Oktoberfest beer with a twist of caramel."
"This brew is very drinkable, it is a tad bit sweet for me - with the large caramel presence. The brew is good, I just dont get the Oktoberfest vibe from it that I would expect. Good for a change up brew for this style."
"Overall a pretty nice beer to celebrate fall with."
"Tasty and attractive. Pours a deep copper with a slightly tan fluffy head that falls fairly quickly. The aroma is like a sharp dark honey, sweet but with a malt sting. The flavor is bready and toasted, with a sharp bitterness that manifests high in the mouth. There is a bit of floral hop character, but the star if the show is the spicy malt burn. The mouthfeel is solid and has a sharp carbonation that stings the tongue."
"Bottled poured into tulip great looking ruby brownish color aroma is malty up front but I detect some hops. Malt up front hoppy finish, not a lot per se but for an octoberfest a bit much. Decent body great carb a little creamy - again hoppiness is not what I look for in octoberfest - detracts from drinkability of your traditional octoberfest/"
"A nice, light Octoberfest/Marzen beer. Might get swamped by highly spiced foods, but would compliment more mellow dishes quite nicely. All in all, not the best domestic Octoberfest I've tasted, but quite enjoyable and refreshing."
"simple and straightforward o-fest here. a bit too sweet and fruity for me, but tasty enough."
"D - Goes down nice and smooth."
"D - High. This brew could convert some macro drinkers IMO."
"Dogtoberfest is a decent take on the style."
"D) High. On the sweet side but overall balanced. A pleasant drink with 5.3% ABV."
"D: Definitely an American version of Marzen, could have a few more of these in an evening"
"Pours a dark orange with a touch of red, two finger white head fades to a thin cap, lacing for the first inch or so. Smell: Crisp with munich malts and maybe some toffee, toasted, light spicy noble hops. Taste: Caramel, rye (but light on the rye) bread, munich malt flavors, toasty, spicy hop, (semi) sweet iced tea, as it warms I get a sweet pale malt backdrop which strays into corny territory (weird). Soft but active carbonation, light-to-medium bodied. This was a nice surprise, matches up pretty well against top German ofests. Drank alongside a Hacker Pschorr, close but not quite there."
"My favorite Flying Dog beer to date. Typically I feel like Flying Dog attempts to go for over the top bold tastes and fails, but in this case the strong and solid flavor of the Dogtoberfest was pretty good."
"This is an excellent oktoberfest/marzen. The appearance is a nice golden color(on the darker side). The aroma is very dry and cereally malt nose. Toasty cheerios malt is the predominant aroma. The taste is crisp but sweet. Wonderful malt flavor. Not too heavy despite all the malt. A good marzen and an enjoyable drinking beer."
"This beer poured very clear (almost bright) deep amber (SRM13) with a thick, persistent medium bubbled head buoyed by moderate carbonation. Low hop aroma. Dominant caramel/toffee aroma. Flavor is all malty caramel/toffee with a very full silky smooth mouthfeel. Deep, long lasting malt flavor finishes very clean."
"Drinkability: not so high but i can enjoy 3 or 4 of these"
"D: This is a hard beer to judge. On its own, this is a nice beer. But to me, it missed the mark in the style department by a mile. So what we have is a nice tasting beer that doesn't taste like a Märzen should to me. I guess I'll have to split the difference on this one."
"D: This is decent, but the malt and hops are both a little too one-dimensional. The malt is somewhat flat and sweet, while the hops add a blunt bitterness given the malt profile without much of a defining flavor. A solid beer, but it doesn't quite measure up to many other American marzens."
"Also: After tasting a glass, I then drank it with roasted chicken (their website suggested roasted poultry), baby portabella mushrooms and tomatos. It was a great pairing and highly recommended. It brought out the maltiness and more of the spice of the beer."
"More malty than some of the other Okts I've had, but I'm not complaining - I like it this way."
"Drinkability: Nice, flavorful, and easy to drink. It is certainly a German lager, but I am not sure it is a Marzen, almost more like a lower bitterness Vienna or a lower abv Bock. I am not too much of a stickler for style, so I like it."
"Final thoughts: Another interesting Oktoberfest Marzen, nice toasted malts, slight malt spice flavor, crisp lager taste. The only real bad taste is that syrupy extract flavor. I seem to find that flavor in most American Marzen/Oktoberfest/Autumnfest type beers. Perhaps it's a product of the yeast, or perhaps we just don't get the best malts here as they do in Germany. This really makes me crave an Ayinger Oktoberfest. I can't wait until that hits the shelves."
"Overall, this is a good american-made fest bier that does the style proud. I recommend this bier, pick up a few of these for you and the boys. Prosit!"
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a shaker pint. It pours a clear orange with a 2 finger white head. The aroma is sweet and malty. The flavors are sweet, and full with a dry finish. The beer is medium to full bodied, a bit light on carbonation and easily drinkable. A solid Marzen that went well with my Brats tonight."
"D: could drink a few, a good complement to psychology reading"
"D: Very drinkable, I could drink 4 easily."
"Rotation: one and done as better ones out there. Not even sure if this would make the cut if down to this or usual swill at store or on-tap."
"Definitely a smooth and drinkable beer. This style is obviously meant to be drunk in liters and this beer is right in line with that."
"Overall- i had to try this one out of a mixed 6 pack i got the other day of all oktoberfest brews. the lady at the store who's michigan's first woman cicerone knows her stuff and said this one isn't to shabby and she's right. the only thing i'm curious is she said the great lakes one isn't to impressive and i'm a fan of the lakes. i shall find out tomorrow. MUST NOTE!! this is prolly the best brew i've had from flying dog. their gonzo porter isn't to shabby also."
"Pours transparent amber with a two finger off white head with great retention. Good Lacing. Smell is faint, but has slight hop scent. The taste is well balanced, but just not very strong. I guess that's pretty much the style, as I've never really found an extreme flavored octoberfest. This example is nicely drinkable, just not a wow'er."
"Its October again, time to drink a lot of great Oktoberfest beers. This beer was served from a bottle into a pint glass. Appearance is brown to copper hue, slightly lighter than I was expecting, carbonation was weak and steady started out with a thick head that fell away quickly. Beer is clear....very very clear. Not much in the way of aroma. I can smell some malt, but not much, no hop character at all. The taste is good. Not the best Oktoberfest I've had but this beer is quite drinkable. I think I'm coming around on Flying Dog brews more than I was before. After drinking two of these beers, there is a growing unpleasant aftertaste, but it fades quickly."
"D- Very drinkable. Lots of flavor for a 5.3% ABV beverage. Perfect for the fall... I would find this less sessionable in the summer and winter. Definitely would purchase again!"
"An okay Marzen, but nothing spectacular. There are other beers of the same style I would prefer."
"D-Not being a session drinker, I could still have a few of these no problem. Would like to find this on tap sometime."
"Poured copper/brown into an American pint glass. The head was white and full at first, but deflated immediately. The smell was caramel, toffee, biscuit, and honey, with a slight hop-bitter presence. The taste was not as pronounced as the nose, and the mouth was dare I say too light for a maerzen. That being said, you could probably slam down a handful of these."
"D- Overall, not a bad Oktoberfest but there are many better ones outthere that would keep me from purchasing again."
"D - A decent offering from Flying Dog. It's not as good as Spaten or great lakes but a good attempt."
"In a nutshell I would refer to this beer as a poor American substitute for real Marzen Oktoberfest."
"Pours a pretty copper color with a tight off-white head that disipated fairly quickly. The aroma is of a toasted bready malt, some caramel and nut. The taste is of a toasted malt, some earthy resin hop flavor, a bit nutty with a light honey/caramel sweetness. The feel is of a solid malt body, almost chewy, tingly carbonation, finishes with a light earthy bitterness. A nice malty marzen with a noticable hop presence. Perhaps on the hoppy side for a marzen. Is this the best I have had, no, but it is solid."
"Dark yellow, light amber color with a medium body head into a 4 oz tasting glass. A nice, spring water and floral scent with a touch of citrus. Taste is medium bodied for a marzen, but crisp on the back end with good carbonation and a mild ABV. Smooth and drinkable. A bit light, but otherwise drinkable."
"Poured a copper color with a one finger head. The smell was of malt, caramel, and some earthy hops. The taste was very rich, it was of malt and a surprising amount of hops, with some bread presence. The mouthfeel was slightly carbonated. The overall drinkability is above average, it is a very smooth and flavorful beer."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a dimpled mug. Appears a clear amber color with about an inch of off white foam. Aroma and flavor are of sweet malt, apples, slightly metallic, grassy bitter hops, fruity ans somewhat sweet, caramel, some bread. This marzen is medium in body and adequately carbonated for the style. Worth a try."
"I'm not fond of Flying Dog other than the names and logos, but this was pretty good."
"Poured from a bottle with a clear amber color and a reasonable slightly off white head. There are hints of metal along with caramel in the aroma that translate well into the taste. Taste is more roasted, caramel with hints of metal and some faint hints of malt. Finishes well and clean."
"D - A tasty enough beer that I could drink more of. Not my first pick but one that would go through regular rotation."
"D-Enjoyable, but not my first choice for this style. The complex esters are nice, but the body and drink experience would benefit from a little more fizz."
"Dogtoberfest is a somewhat disappointing Oktoberfest. It has no standout appeal and is easily lost in the crowd of nice Oktoberfest seasonals. Beefing it up all around would dramatically improve it. As it is, it's just above average. Not a bad beer by any means though."
"M&D: softly-carbonated, med-bodied, rather fruity like an ale or an amber Vienna Lager and unlike any Oktoberfest Lagerbier I've tried, but all in all a very decent offering. Can't make up my judgement as to its true identity (an ale or a lager?) but this is quite irrelevant while happily sipping this fruity-malt liquor."
"Overall decent brew but carbonation kills the drink ability for me. Not in a hurry to buy this beer again."
"D: A tasty blend of malts that are very well balanced. The hopping and carbonation provide further balance to make this a very drinkable and sessionable beer."
"I would drink a few of these, I might even pour one just to look at; gorgeous!"
"This is a respectable Octoberfest, but not stellar. The beer pours a nice clear amber color with a very caramelly and metallic nose. There wasn't much lacing to the beer and the carbonation is quite low. The taste was fairly uniform, nothing sophisticated. It was very caramelly but not loaded with malts either. It was rather thin, but the caramel is the most pronounced part. Behind that is a touch of a metallic tinge, some grape skin, some roasted notes, and a herbal hop bite in the finish. This is a nice beer, but nothing that will challenge the palate. There is a bit too much aftertaste, while the mouthfeel has a lingering herbal hop bite."
"Prefer a bit more maltiness in octoberfests."
"Pours a beautiful amber/orange with a small 1 finger mostly white head. Smells of adjuncts with a slight alcohol note bleeding thru. First sip is tangy with toasted caramel malts leading the way. Not much hop presence here but the malts seem just strong enough for my enjoyment. Very clean tasting and quite enjoyable."
"d: I could drink a gallon. Not a great beer, but very quaffable and that is really the name of the game."
"Dark copper to red color, head very thick at first, dissipates swiftly, soft cloudiness to it, dark even to the rims. Orange peel, toasted biscuits, light apricot and peach fruit, suggestion of ginger root, not the most expressive beer you'll sniff on. Light to medium-bodied, picks up weight as it moves forward through the palate. There's a sort of dulling bitterness to it, not crisp, which flattens the orange citrus, baking spice and herbal aspects. Breadiness fares a little better. Good plus level of carbonation. Caramelized sweet onions. Malts lead the hops until the finish. Not all that."
"Dry and crisp, there is a little hop bitterness in the swallow. The malt is light and the body is thin (with a correspondingly high amount of CO2). Short aftertaste."
"First sniff is a woody, spicey, mahogany malt. Pours a deep orange- gotta love marzen- slash bronze hue with a fluffy white head. Very impressive marzen here, a slightly different take. A ton of woody, bready malt. Some haylike malt there, super malty. Not too much sweetness but there is some caramel sweetness there. As the beer starts to really warm and I get down past half-glass, the sweetness comes out. Lots of honey and caramel. Pretty complex for an American brew. Very smooth, just the right thickness, carbonation tickles my gums, really satisfying mouthfeel. This is a really, really good marzen- I'm surprised that it has as low of a rating as it does. Check it out this fall if you're looking for a good American take on marzen. Just fabulous."
"I'd have no problem getting this occasionally when in the mood for this style."
"Taste: Caramel malts with a light hoppiness. I agree with Jason Alstrom, it does have a kind of grape skin flavor going on as well."
"D: Very nice mixture of the malts, really sweet, but not too sweet. A nice marzen that is pretty drinkable."
"Clear reddened copper under a thick, creamy looking head. Toasted malt aroma with fruity yeast and faint sweet dough. Toasted grains, light sweetness, caramel, and bread. Enough noble hops to balance. Properly clean though not as complex as it could be. Feels medium and smooth. Perfectly good drinking here."
"Medium body, with moderate carbonation. Overall, not a bad beer, though I generally prefer a more prominent toasted element in an Oktoberfest. Worth having again, but might not be at the top of my list."
"D: More flavor would make me want to gulp it down quicker, but it's fairly drinkable as is. A decent beer, but I think there are probably some other marzens available in my market that don't cost as much as this one and taste even better."
"Simple marzen, drinkable. Medium mouthfeel, lighter yellow with small amount of foam. A slight amount of toasted bread. Decent malt and the bit of toasting. Good with pizza. Suitable carbonation. Decent sweetness, not too sweet. A bit drying.About what I expected from this brewery."
"Out of the bottle this beer looked fantastic, just like an Oktoberfest should, bright orange/copper with great clarity. The head was a toasted cream color and three fingers thick and it displayed pretty good retention and some like cling-to-the-glass lacing. The aroma was also nice, caramel malt and doughy malt with some spiciness and floral hops. The flavors were drier than the aroma, assorted grains and some bitterness mixed with a slightly herbal character. Not quite as rich or sweet as I was expecting but the finish was crisp. Medium body, good carbonation for the style and likely sessionable."
"D - Just average. Wouldn't need to buy this one again."
"Not too bad, but not that great. I've had better marzens and was a little disappointed with this offering."
"This is a nice Marzen. The color is a bit darker than most -- a dark amber. The head is slight and tan, and leaves little lacing. A pleasant but mild nose leads into a very nice sweet malt on the palate. The finish is rather neutral. This beer is very drinkable, and would make a superb autumn session beer. Nice mouthfeel with texture but not too thick. I think I'll suck down another one."
"Pours a hazy orange with a thin tan head. Smell is of slightly oxidized malt with a hint of sulfur. Taste is better, malt dominated with a hint of sourness. A small amount of bitterness in the finish rounds things out. Mouthfeel is smooth, good carbonation. Quite drinkable, I could go for this again, though there are better Oktoberfests out there."
"This poured a clear, dark copper with tan head. It smelled like sweet yeast and light nutty malt, with a bit of copper hops. It tasted like a blend of watery nutty malt and sweet barley and copper hops. It was watery with moderate carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this had pretty good flavor, but it wasn't very clean. The body was OK, but the beer in general was just not very impressive. This would only be really drinkable after you've already had a better beer or two."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Lightly carbonated beer with a medium-light body. The beer is smooth, however I'd really like to see a creamy body on an Oktoberfest...it'd be a nice bonus, a full bodied, rich, creamy feel to a nice big malty beer. This is a beer I'd drink again, however its not my first chioce for an Oktoberfest, but behind Avery Kaiser, GLBC, Moerlein, and possibly Hacker-Pschorr this is my next pick. So many of the Oktoberfests out there are really shit, this one is not...its just that there are a few I'd rather drink over this one. On the other hand, there are many more that I'd rather not drink and would choose this one out of just about all imported Oktoberfests and many of the micro brewed ones. This one, for me, with the O-fests I've sampled thus far is in my top ten."
"It's a little thin / watery, but overall, I really liked it."
"Pours a clear golden amber color with a decent white head that fades fast. Smells of a sweet, almost sour malts. At first taste its good, a solid lager that is crisp and goes down well. Not too much in the flavor category... no hop taste and some barely spiced malts. The aftertaste is a little off, A little bitter. Goes down decent though.. I wouldn't consider it an octoberfest beer."
"It's pretty good. I could drink a couple of these at a sitting."
"D - Everyone I have shared this with have said this is the better octoberfest... I disagree. It is, however, a good beer."
"Not the best Oktoberfest I've enjoyed this season but certainly an enjoyable one."
"d: Thanks to joepais for throwing this in with my growling at the moon box. Pretty solid effort."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D - OK. I had expected more from Flying Dog. It is alright and I was expecting great."
"Compared to where some of the mass produce o-fest beers from Germany are going this one held its own. Not a bad pick for the style."
"Drinkability: Overall, this was an ok Octoberfest beer. Has a different taste then the average Marzen, but it's not as good as some of them either. This isn't bad, but there is definately better out there."
"D: Not my top choice of Marzen, but worth a try. A little too sweet for me to have more then 1 or 2 in a sitting."
"Pretty drinkable marzen, overall. Better than some of the more commercial o-fests I've had, though not up to par with some of the more respectable brews of the style."
"The brew went down well. I had it for a fall picnic with the family, It defiantly got me in the mood for fall"
"Pours a clear copper color with a medium white head that leaves good lacing. The smell isn't too strong ,but there is bread yeast,roasted malt,and some hop scents. The taste has more hops than other Oktoberfests along with roasted malt,dark fruit,and bread yeast. The m/f is light and somewhat thin. Not bad,but you can find better."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass longneck bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Pours a nice copper color, kind of light, with a bit of initial head, but no lacing at all. Nice scent, almost all malty, not as strong as it could be. Good taste, a very nice malty flavor with a very nice bit of hoppiness at the end, a nice full bodied beer. Goes down fine, just a bit too much carbonation perhaps. A good oktoberfest, but not the best, nor the best Flying Dog beer."
"drinkability - A lot of flavor in this one. Did enjoy this one, not sure where to rate this one compared to the last one I had, but it is just as good, but more flavor."
"Truth be told, I had higher expectations for this marzen, being a fan of Flying Dog beers, and maybe that wasn't fair. I can't help but feel a little let down, still. It's worth a shot for the time of year we're in, but I likely wouldn't get it again."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer. I'm a fan of the sweeter Oktoberfests that aren't as heavy on hoppy and toasty flavors, so this one was right up my alley. Worth a shot for this time of year."
"This fall seasonal pours a clear amber hue, with a small and shrinking head. Little lacing going on here. Smell is weak, what is there is sweet toasty malts. Taste is a bit more present. The sweet malt aspect here has more of a buttery biscuit aspect. The hops aren't very notable until the very end. Mouthfeel is fairly clean and refreshing despite the heavy malt aspects. All in all a decent Marzen, and quite drinkable."
""
"Solid and complex, but hardly an exemplary oktoberfest."
"All in all the beer is solid, but the thinness on the mouthfeel really ruins the beer. Maybe bump the beer up to 6% and it'll be better?"
"A better beer than the scores on here, not a great beer or anything but one you can have a few of and really enjoy. A seasonal without the off-putting taste most ""seasonal"" brews offer (I don't dig most fall/Oktoberfest beers)."
"I like this beer. I noticed some other, less favorable reviews, and I can see where this oktoberfest might fall short when compared to others. But on the whole, this is a totally drinkable beer. Quite sessionable to boot. A fine Fall drinker."
"Verdict: While the fundamentals of this beer seem strong, it's just too thin to really inspire me. If they really cranked up the malt on this beer, closer to what you'd expect in a Märzen, I think this beer would be a real winner. However, with the body as thin as it is this beer is simply an average Oktoberfest offering."
"Fairly refreshing in character and drinkable as well, but for the style, this beer proves too hoppy. More caramel malt flavor should be detectable, but the hops truly take over this one. Certainly an American characteristic, not to mention characteristic for this brewery, but damaging for a beer of this type."
"MF/D: Light/med. in body, finishes silky smooth, but leaves a distinct, unwelcomed aftertaste. A little sour maybe"
"I usually like FDs offerings, but this one does not do it for me at all. Too watery, not enough sweet maltyness and the metallic hoppy flavors make this one barely drinkable. I will not buy this beer again."
"On the whole, rather good. It is not a standout Okoberfest, but is certainly a good enough representative of the style as to merit purchase and a return pass. I find it typical of Flying Dog for the most part, which is good, occasionally great (Gonzo comes to mind first and foremost), occasionally disappointing, but usually steady. This typifies the steadiness of Flying Dog that I'd recommend without reservation."
"Notes:It was not the worst Oktoberfest by any stretch,just not something I will seek any time soon."
"This is a very tasty brew, and worthy of a session any day. I was pleasantly surprised."
"Pours reddish brown in color. What little head there is that forms on the pour is gone by the time I sit down. Smell is malty and somewhat floral. Taste is more of the caramel malt, but I'm also getting a sweet, brown sugar flavor as well. Not bad. Decent mouthfeel that is very easy drinking and smooth."
"Though not a bad beer, this is pretty low on my list of Oktoberfests."
"An OK beer. Copper color with a modest white head. Decent aroma of caramel and flowers. The taste was a little disappointing. Some caramel and a little bit of hops at the end. I thought it was thin in the mouth. Drink this on a hot day, after you've mowed the lawn."
"Just noticed this was my 300th review, not too exciting. Ill have to make 301 good."
"D - An alright beer. I remember this being better, but c'est la vie. It did the job last night with friends, but it's hardly a brew to ponder over as I've attempted to do with a glass at the moment."
"D: Drinkable, not my favorite Octoberfest but one of the better examples I've had."
"Drinkability- Overall a decent brew. Fairly to style. Would have again if offered, but proabably would not seek out."
"D: Had a 12oz draft pour and that was enough. The spiciness cuts it down quite a bit. It wasn't bad but I will not be seeking this out again."
"D- A decent brew, not my favorite by any means. Worth a try though."
"I was a bit disappointed by this brew. I haven't had too many Oktoberfests yet, but if you had blindfolded me and told me this was Flying Dog's new version of their pale ale, I would've believed it. Good taste, great mouthfeel, very light and smooth, but not very impressive or memorable."
"M -- Medium body, soft to slightly syrupy mouthfeel. Some alcohol warming."
"Drinkability is low. I was able to finish this but had no desire to go find more of these. I'd much rather drink other Oktoberfest beers or almost any of Flying Dog's other offerings."
"Recommended..."
"D: Drinkability was ok, nothing great and was expecting more."
"1/2"" cream colored head with short retention but good lacing. Crystal clear amber/copper color. Sweet caramel apple, toffee with some floral, grassy hops in the aroma. Sweet, gritty malt with lots of caramel and toffee and some spicy hops in the finish. A little too sweet. Medium body with a round mouthfeel and somewhere between low and mid carbonation. Decent drinkability."
"D= probably very drinkable (which I've proven!) but for some beer-fans it might be too sweet for quantity-consumption."
"this beer poured a yellowish orange with some rocky bubbles, but little head. the taste is spicy and malty and lacking in hop character. the taste is a bit like toasted bread and clove. the body is medium, but borders on sticky, which is odd to me. overall a pretty decent beer that i was glad to try, but probably wouldn't seek out."
"The aroma was citrusy of oranges and spice. I tasted a maltiness and a little bitter. In the mouth it was a little spicy but overall it was just an average for me."
"D-eh"
"Copper pour, little head, and a touch of lacing. Smell is honey, malt, graininess, yeast. Taste is a bit of tart maltiness, with a thinnish body to go along. Nothing bad, but not spectacular either. A very average beer and fitting of the oktoberfest style."
"D: Smooth and well balanced. It has a low ABV that makes it an easy session brew."
"D- Smell is delightful, but a little disappointing in the taste department, takes a bit of time for taste to come through. Not a classic oktoberfest,i dont feel its a straight quaffer, it has too much hoppy floralness in the finish. I almost feel im willing the malt taste to come through after the smell. Nevertheless, still an interesting brew."
"12 oz. glass bottle- color of amber, with a thick off white colored head - nose of medium sweet malts, light hops, bananas, and light floral fruit  taste of candy sweet, light hops, and malty- body is light , smooth, and with medium to low carbonation  aftertaste of light, sweet malts, and gummy"
"Taste is light caramel and has some nutty flavors. The malt is lightly roasted and gives some malt bitterness. German counterparts usualy have some more maltiness. The yeast is a bottom fermenting strain and leaves no real tastes other than a clean and slightly mineral taste. Body is somewhat sticky."
"My last Octoberfest beer of the year and probably one of the better ones, I am holding on to my Avery Kaiser for a while, highly recommended marzen from one of my favorite breweries, Flying Dog"
"Overall, this is a decent Marzen with one major shortcoming in the flavor. With a little more malty sweetness up front this has the potential to be an excellent brew. I hope they'll fiddle with the recipe for next fall."
"Pours a crystal-clear rusty bronze hue. Frothy two finger head; very pale biege color with terrific retention that leaves heavy patterns of lacing. Toasted malt aroma with faint minty hops in the background and a curious dark fruit note. Sweet crystal malt upfront makes up the basis of the flavor profile. It has a sweet light caramel taste, with mild toasted tones like Vienna and perhaps some faint buscuity Victory malt. The hop flavor and bitterness in the aftertaste are just barely perceivable, but achive an acceptable balance. An odd fig/date taste appears with the slightly residual sweetness, but dissapears quickly enough to not become distracting. A light-ish body and medium carbonation present a true to style mouthfeel that is creamy and crisp, and lends to a tremendous drinkability. The finish is soft and malty but dries thoroughly. One of the best american adaptations of Marzen-bier I have tried."
"I love flying dog brews, but this one seems to be intentionaly aimed at the masses. Would do better as a summer brew,"
"Nothing too special about this beer. Clean copper in color with little to no head and ditto the lacing. Sweet malts and yeast are prevalent with no hop presence either in the smell or on the palate. This isn't a bad beer by any means and worth a try ,but like most american efforts on the style , it comes up short. Forgettable but not regrettable."
"beer should be, friendly, malty, and easy drinking."
"Worth a shot if for nothing else than to experience the wonderfully sweet aroma."
"Pours a copper orange with an off white head that fades quickly. The smell is sweet and malty, nice and inviting, no hops that I can detect. The taste follows right along with a strong malt character, starts sweet and ends with somewhat of a bite. The aftertaste is subtle, a little doughy. The mouthfeel is good, nice flavors, decent balance. This is an easy drinker, a great beer for all fall occasions. Worth checking out."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. A nice reddish brown color with a thin foamy head. Head didn't last long, but left a thin ring around the top with occasional clings to the side of the glass. Smell was slightly sour grain. Taste was bitter at first, but as it warmed up it reminded me of almost stale wheat bread. It was slightly sweet, which went well with the grain. Felt ok in the mouth. A little dry, didn't coat as well as I like. Easy to drink, slightly sharp in the mouth which detracted."
"Drinkability: Great. This beer is a wonderful way to celebrate the arrival of autumn."
"D: Drinkable, I suppose, but I think I'm already bored with it. Not one of Flying Dog's better efforts & a far cry from the German Octoberfests that are readily available."
"Drinkability- A decently drinkable beer, nothing truly distinguishing about it, a good way to rehydrate."
"In the midst of sampling a dozen Octoberfests, enter Flying Dog and their butt-ugly labels...a copper-brown body with a frothy, half-uinch head that flattens rather swiftly to an uneven cloud....low-end lager that exhibits lightly-toasted senses...softly fizzy, medium dry body--appropriate in its style...slightly pedestrian in flavor....subtle but serviceable (an extra hint of yeast?)...a basic marzen, less sweet than I'd like...likeable but not laudable...."
"Definately worth a try"
"Meduim bodied with a good smoothness. Decent O-fest,a kind of middle of the road beer."
"Drinkability: Very smooth and goes down easy. However, the sweetness does limit this one for me. I think I can only have about 1 or 2 before I feel like I'm going to become hyperglycemic. Ultimately it is a pretty solid O-fest to try."
"M/D: Medium body, carbonation pretty spot on. Drinkability is pretty nice on this one as although the beer doesn't seem to offer a whole lot, it doesn't have any drawbacks."
"D- It was an easy drinker. I could have more than one in a single sitting."
"Edit #2: I keep wanting to give this a chance, If it was an IPA, I'd have no problem with the hops but as it is, it'll get no further breaks from me. IMHO for the style, the hops are just simply over the top."
"It would be easy to finish a pint or a liter of this one. Haven't seen it on tap locally though. Sampled during ""Oktoberfest"" at Back Door Lounge, Utica, IL."
"Drinkability: A decent offering, but with so many other great o-fest beers out there, I don't plan on coming back to it."
"Left me hoping to find a few more like it before the season ends!"
"D: Probably the best American Oktoberfest I have ever had, a very good beer."
"Very drinkable."
"As for the mouthfeel, its smooth but a bit matted with moderate carbonation. Overall, another quality selection from Flying Dog. Not nearly their best by any stretch of the imagination, but certainly worth another try next fall."
"d-a beer that i prob. will not have again, not impressed"
"d - easily drinkable and good. i liked it and one of the best when it comes to style that i've had in a while."
"Drinkability - this is a decent beer, but not a great one."
"D- Drinkability is good since the brew is light. Not strong on alcohol, so it would be a good session beer. A little too weak and bitter for me though."
"Poured into my pint glass, a crystal clear, copper Oktoberfest! The head was almost non-existent, and leaves just a ring of fine bubbles around the wall of the pint glass. Toasted malt aroma, no hop aroma. Toasted malty flavor, with a hint of caramel. No hop flavor. Beer finished a bit dry for style I think, but overall is nice."
"Interesting taste, if it wasnt labeled an octoberfest i'd have a hard time figuring that out. Worth a taste if you like the brewery."
"This Oktoberfest is a brilliantly clear, golden copper color, very striking. The head is thin, white and quickly diminished. The aroma is moderately malty, that of toasted grains, with a low caramel sweetness, little if any hop aroma. The flavor is intensely malty, that of toasted grains, some bready character and a low residual sweetness. The bitterness is medium-low and there is just a hint of hop flavor on a slightly dry finish. The body is medium, maybe medium-full and carbonation moderate. Overall a very, very good Oktoberfest, I appreciate the intense malt flavor and striking appearance the most, but cant find a fault with this brew! Highly recommend."
"Overall - A very good example of an Oktoberfest beer... well worth a try.."
"Orangish copper colored brew, tiny white head that disappears quickly. Somewhat of a caramel malt scent. Taste is mainly comprised of the malty oktober taste, backed by some bit of hops. Fairly thinly bodied. Overall, not the worst beer, but as far as fest beer goes, there are many beers that should be tried before this one. It's ""all fur coat and no trousers, it is..."""
"Eh...another mediocre oktoberfest from a brewery that does mostly ales. It's too bad that this style is so often used as a seasonal marketing gimmick from brewers that don't really know what they're doing with lager styles. Better as it warms, a decent beer overall."
"Pours a tawny amber in color, like a darkened glass of iced tea. A nice collar of 1/8 inch head that disappears as fast as it arose. Faint caramel in the nose, some bready malt, and little else. Caramel takes on a bit more of a toffee note on the tongue and is fairly mild. The highlight is the quick tingle of carbonation and hops that dominate the middle through the end, with a nice residual aftertaste. The malt profile is a bit bland compared to most, but I do enjoy the crispness of it. Drinkability is excellent, being a session beer, but purists might want to avoid it. I've never been a fan of this brewery and this marzen indicates why. I'd rather see five failures somehow redeemed but a couple of great brews, but Flying Dog is consistently mediocre in every regard. This is one of the better ones, IMO."
"Nice copper color and foamy head to this one, but the rest of it was fairly average. The aroma is mostly malty, grains, sweet caramel. But taste seemed off-balance to me. I expected more maltiness, and while it's there, it fades quickly to leave a bitter hoppiness. Not bad, just probably not one I'd pick out for an Oktoberfest example."
"Okay, so this is above the pack, but not enough to make it far enough above the pack. I'd probably get this if served at an Octoberfest, but usually , this year, it's SA or Becks, not much else."
"Overall, this is a drinkable beer. It isn't the best Octoberfest I have had but it is far from the worst. I kinda enjoyed it."
"Thin yellowish cap tops this clear, reddish beer. Malty aroma, quite toasty, with mild floral hopping. Malty, toasty flavour as well, and the bitterness cut through the middle of the sweetness. Light hop notes throughout. Medium/light body with average carbonation, decent mouthfeel. A hint of warmth? A little better than average, nice toastiness, but it didn't come together for me the way the best marzens do."
"Nice Marzen!! reminds me of SAs version looks the same. Clear amber with a good head. Nice white head. Malty nose. Sweet with a touch of hops at the end very good. I could drink this all night and listen to ummpaaa music. Ugly ass flying dog art on the bottle needs to be changed."
"D- Easy on the mouth, very drinkable"
"12oz brown bottle from Ron's in Farmington. Pours translucent red-amber body with a good inch of off-white head. Smells malty sweet with some roastiness, though the aroma is somewhat muted. Tastes sweet and roasty, with caramel and biscuit malts playing a big role. Very tasty, and one sip definitely invites another. Medium to full bodied with a fair bit of carbonation. I'm really impressed with this one - a new favorite for the style!"
"Overall, oktoberfests are not one of my favorite styles and this is a pretty subpar version. The flavors are a mish-mash and not appealing to me."
"Drinks pretty easy, but off style & not as good as last years offering by a mile IMO"
"This is my second beer from Flying dog and I am looking forward to their other offerings."
"Very good beer!"
"Pours an attractive copper color and a nice slightly off-white head. Aroma is of a sweet maltiness. Taste is also very malty, but not overly done. Balanced with a faint nuttiness. Lacing is good. Mouthfeel is pretty good; not too thick or thin and level of carbonation is excellent. Drinkability is pretty high. Actually, I could drink the hell out of this. Another style that I have really grown to appreciate."
"Pours a rich golden amber,with a fluffy white head. Very good retention,and lacing. Smell is of sweet dark fruit,carmels,and malts. This is medium bodied beer,that is lightly carbionated. Taste is of fruit,and honey. This beer is light and refreshing."
"Poured clear amber with a short cap of whitish head. The aroma picked up sweet toasted caramel, but focused more on the sweetness than the malty backing. There were some herbal notes, some bread, and a grass accent. The flavor also had a sweet, toasty caramel backbone with bready malts in there too. The herbal and leafy hop accents worked well. Some peppery spices appear right at the very end, and serve to make this even more refreshing. Light-medium bodied with a bitter bite on the edges and a medium-length refreshing finish."
"I find that Flying Dog's beer always have a bit of their own taste and this is no exception. Good - not my favorite, but good/great as part of the style."
"Of all the seasonals that I have tasted this season this is far and beyond the best one. Poured into a pint glass it had a great color and a nice head. Excellent beer for watching football and just relaxing with friends. Flying Dog has really outdone itself with this beer. Not too expensive either I paid 7.99 for a six pack"
"This beer pours a deep amber, downright dark garnet, with a solid-enough head that barely laces the top of the brew. Aroma is malty, some caramel and biscuity goodness. Taste is very solid, clean and malty, not overly sweet, but not much from the hops, though there is a slight dry finish that helps to balance slightly. Overall I was impressed, I wasnt expecting much but this proved to be a solid and very drinkable attempt at the style."
"Overall Impression: Solid beer. Total package is balance, flavorful, but moderate. Nice malty beer that has me looking forward to Fall weather."
"Pours out a light orange tinted amber with abundant excited bubbles and a sturdy head that leaves tons of lace on the glass. There's a good maltiness in the nose, but it is awfully faint. It's hard to get much out of this, but there is an underlying grainy character that I'm just not that fond of. Taste is a bit light as well, and takes on a somewhat watery thinness towards the finish (I found this also to be the case with their wheat beer). There's some nice caramelized malt flavors, but the maltiness doesn't come out as much as I'd like. This sort of reminds me of a maibock more than anything else. Hops are rather punchy, but kind of muddy things up with a dull and lingering bitterness. A bit of graininess is found in the flavor as well. Mouthfeel is a Tad thin yet still sticky. Carbonation is solid. Decent beer overall. I'd take it over some Oktoberfests I've had in the past, but I wouldn't go out of my way to drink it again."
"D: Very good. Went down pretty easily but was by no means flavorless."
" Overall all I can really say is wow. I was looking forward to this years release and I am glad that I did. Now I do figure there will be at least several if not dozens more in the style I will try over the next month of two, however this bar has been set pretty high. This was really at the top of everything I was looking for at the time. Just really great and you must get your hands on it. Now to relax with another as that was damn good."
"Drinkability: Way to sweet for my tastebuds; a drain pour"
"Final Note: this is a good beer at a reasonable price, go out and get some if it's available in your neck of the woods. Recommended."
"Solid interpretation of the style."
"This said, not the most exciting oktoberfest, but a good one."
"Drinkability: The runt of the Oktoberfest litter."
"I just couldn't get into this one. There's nothing really wrong with it and it just ends up being your run of the mill Oktoberfest brew. Not bad, but simply not memorable."
"D- a solid unflawed marzan, however nothing particuarly exciting"
"All things considered this is a very drinkable brew. Not very complex, but for the style not bad at all. This is a good choice as a session beer this fall. Just enough flavor to keep you interested without it being too overbearing. Decent example of a domestic Oktoberfest."
"Overall, a disappointing octoberfest. Very plain and uninspired, you can do alot better."
"D--This is a very good oktoberfest, normally not a big fan of this type beer normally, but this is worth a try"
"Drinkability- This domestic Octoberfest is full flavored and well worth seeking out... I'll be keeping this on hand for the Fall season alongside the tried-and-true, delicious original Hacker-Pschorr Oktoberfest. Well done, thank yous all around to the Flying Dog team."
"D- Not really that impressive overall. It just seemed like it was lacking a little something, but I can't put my finger on it."
"Would definitely get again."
"Mouthfeel is interesting and seems to straddle between lager and ale characteristics. Smooth and highly drinkable. This is slightly better than average and could be a decent fall session beer."
"Overall impression: Nice and drinkable - actually one of Flying Dog's better beers, even if it isn't exactly true to style."
"I bought this expecting a lager, but it doesn't say that anywhere on the packaging. I wonder if it is...? An alright beer, but of course there are a lot better."
"12oz bottle given to me by a friend in a mixed 6pack. All I needed was one bottle to review this as it's an easy beer to figure out. Malt aroma on top of more malt. Malty goodness; yum. Beautiful dark amber with a luscious head and lace. Malty taste with bittering hops to balance. I believe this to be an ale and not a true marzen lager because of a fruity aroma and taste. There are many octoberfest ales in the US(Harpoon for example). None-the-less, this is a wonderful brew."
"D- this wasn't bad. pretty drinkable at all temperatures."
"12 oz. bottle with some code - it pours a crystal-clear reddish amber with high carbonation and a two finger, light tan head that leaves moderate lacing. The aroma is almost nonexistent but the flavor consists of toasted, lightly roasted malts, caramel, molasses?, some green hops, and a light fruitiness. It has a tingly, drying, light to medium body with equal finish. Not horrible, but not really worth seeking out."
"This beer poured a reddish/amber color which was quite clear. The smell is sweet and malty. The taste is malty and slightly sour. There is a touch of bitterness that helps offset the sweetness. The mouthfeel is full. This is a mild, smooth beer that makes a very drinkable brew."
"Overall an ok beer, but nothing I would go out of my way to get ahold of."
"Has one of the most artistic bottle labels, funny and yest true to the style. This beer poutred with a thick white head that had a mixture of small and large bubbles. It's reddish brown color invites you to the glass, average hop aroma much like a Spaten. Taste clean and crisp with a hoppy finish, light on the tongue and mouthfeel. Very true to the Ocktoberfest style."
"Definitly not the best in style. Obviously goes well with a german meal. Lack of strength is the biggest drawback in flavor. Average offering that you would do better to pass up in favor of others on the shelf."
"Drinkability: Could drink several of these. Makes me look forward to October."
"Drinkability: A fine Oktoberfest offering, avoids the let down of many of the other Flying Dog beers for me."
"Tried this at a Flying Dog beer tasting at the local package store. Poured to a bright copper color, with medium off-white head and okay lacing. Malty-sweet aroma, with not much else in the nose. Taste was very mild; drinkable, but not real flavorful. Finish was nice and smooth. Not great, but a decent Autumn Fest beer."
"The drinkability is quite good, one of then better O'fests I had this year. I will try it again next year for sure. Prosit und Zum Wohl, MK"
"Pours a two finger cream head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving traces of lace. Nice deep amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Slight malty nose. Starts smooth and balanced, some sweetness, slight hoppy finish. $1.25 for a 12oz bottle from Smiley's Beverage Dover, NH."
"A good call? Definitely. Essential? Hardly."
"I found this an enjoyable if not remarkable Marzen. It was tasty and refreshing with mild sweetness and med body. It was a little light for my taste for an Octoberfest, but good none the less. I find the flying dog styles a little hit and miss sometimes, but this was more of the hit variety. Nice amber color, enduring head retention and appropriate mouthfeel rounded out a good Marzen."
"D - One of the more unique Octoberfest selections I've tried this year. I'd definitely pick up a sixer next year and enjoy them over the fall season...I'm curious how this one will change over a few weeks."
"Overall a very drinkable Oktoberfest. The taste was seemingly authentic and a very solid session beer. One of the best domestic versions I have had."
"the hops are much more prevelent in the flavor, actually competing with, as opposed to merely balancing, the malts. little bit of a tang, actually. slightly metallic finish, however. it's got some nearly fruity flavors, but stays within the realm of malt character"
"Drinkability: easy drinking. Not a bad brew but this needs a bit more heft."
"The mouth is medium bodied, on the drier side of the style, and finishes with a subtle hop characteristic. Could easy donwn a couple steins of this at a festival. It didn't rock my socks, but it's certaintly a solid Octoberfest offering."
"Drinkability: ehhh, i had one and didn't want one afterward"
"Overall this is the best Octoberfest I've had this year and a very sessionable beer."
"cup. Not a bad beer for the first few sips. Very hard to finish the whole beer."
"Pours a bright clean amber orange hue. Tanish off white head. It sticks around for a while. Good lacing of the pint glass. Sweet raisin fruit like malt smell. Tangy malt wafting to my nose. Faint citrus hop scent. Smells like a true Mezen Oktoberfest. Smooth malt with a sweet caramel flavor. Nice medium body mild hop after taste very malted flavor. Nice sweet presentation of this beer. Strong caramel malt tones with the faint hop finish make this a true to style brew. Nice Oktoberfest offering Very tasty beer. Smooth and drinkable. Good mouth feel not to thick with a nice medium body and perfect carbonation. This was my first brew from Flying Dog and is scores well with me. Great seasonal offering. They hit this style right on the nose. Great beer. I look forward to trying another one of there offerings."
"This beer is a darker shade of orange with a quickly dissaparing head. The semll is somewhat sweet with a underlying spice scent. The taste is actually fairly bitter for the style. There is some hints of pumkin. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth. I could drink this beer again. Overall, a average beer of the style."
"Sweet maltiness comes to the nose after pouring this mahogany hued brew. A head about an inch quickly settles to a thin sheet floating atop of the body. The mouthfeel is a bit thin for this style, but actually makes this very drinkable. Not too sweet and it has a nice balance of malt that compliments the light hop appearance."
"It takes a lot for me to enjoy Octoberfest beers, but this still came below average for the style."
"This is one O/M with some oomph, or maybe oom-pa is more like it. Very light sweetness slides into nutty tastes and quickly darkens to deep malt/ caramel sweetness. There is an undersatated fruitiness in the forefront of this beer. Malt flavor continues to fill out as hop bitterness comes on strong in the finish. This can definately stand up to heavy food, which is important to me in this style. However, slight heaviness of this beer hurts drinkability, which is also important for this style. I wish the overall taste was brighter, but this is a special O-fest."
"A very good Marzen, well worth a try. It was quite refreshing and I must say it went well as a stand alone, or with spicy food."
"I'm not an Oktoberfest aficionado by any means, but even I can recognize that there are much better versions of the style than this one. Still though, it's an okay little seasonal that isn't too challenging and could be consumed by the liter mugful while munching on some bratwurst and sauerkraut."
"D: I could drink a lot of these, but it doesn't taste like an Oktoberfest to me. It's far fruitier and is more like a summer refresher with a stronger backbone. That's no reason to hate or dismiss the beer, of course, but it's not a ""taste of fall"" at all."
"Appearance has a caramel amber body with a large off white head, very nice look to it leaves behind fine lacing all the way through. Aroma contains some copper penny metallic tones with a nice caramel malt sweetness balanced with some herbal hop presence, nice smell. Taste slight bitterness apparent from the noble gassy hop tones leaves light caramel malt sweetness in there as well nice oktoberfest definitely has a good bit of flavor. Mouthfeel medium to light bodied goes down smooth with even smooth carbonation. Drinkability a decent offering from Flying Dog never wowed by their beers but this one is solid, and I'll probably have this one again in the future."
"D: Decent taste, not very filling, easy to drink, however, if Im going to pound an O-fest there are several others that I would choose first."
"Poured a copperish amber with very little head that diminshed quickly. Left no lacing rather just a fog of condensation on the glass. Aroma is well balanced, with both caramel malt and piney hop character. Flavor is strong of caraemel malt, with an aftertaste that leaves a slight hop bitterness. Overall, a fine version of an octoberfest lager, but far from the best."
"It's better than average by a step, worse than great by a few steps, and good, or not. I hate to be so ambivalent, but this beer inspires that reaction in me. Sure it, drinks well enough, which is good, or not. So I'll have another, or not."
"A clean orange/copper beer. Has a small creamy off white head. Has a sweet malty aroma with hints of caramel and apples. The flavor starts with that sweet malt note and slides into a dry snappy finish. With a little tabacco bitterness on the roof of you mouth that gives this beer a robust finish."
"Not an outstanding beer, but not bad at all (except for disappointing head). Easily quaffable."
"Purchased: 58 Degrees, Tucson AZ"
"drinkability: meh"
"Cheers!"
"Deep copper-amber with a wispy tan head that dissipates after the first sip. Smells of malts, caramel and biscuits. Lots of sweet malt in the taste with a grain-like flavor and a hint of citrus fruit somewhere in the middle. Somewhat dry and hoppy into the finish. Thin mouthfeel but well balanced and easily drinkable."
"Thin off white head with minimal lacing on top of a murky copper bronze body. The nose is bready, with some slight spice, not a lot here. The taste delivers tangerine, aluminum, hops, spice, and slight citrus. Has a nice clean finish, with a crisp mouthfeel."
"Overall- A nice tasty Oktoberfest. A big surprise!!!"
"Nice deep amber color, slighlty cloudy. Little head to start. This is one of the best Oktoberfest's I've had yet. Very well balanced and extremely drinkable. Was developing the opinion I just didn't find this style appealing as a whole, this is a very solid brew. Please sir, may I have another one."
"Flavor is nice and round up front but descends into an oversweet aftertaste that isn't helped by a watery texture with grittiness in the mouth once the sip is finished. If it fulfilled its promise it would be an excellent fest bier but instead falls into a sea of mediocre Marzen."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle with another spectacular Ralph Steadman drawn label, always entertaining. Typical Marzen coppery colored amber, crystal clear with a frothy white finger of foamy head that slowly fades away to a whitish light ring of lace. Aroma is malty, sweet dark dried fruit, roasty grain and caramel. Taste is lighter than the smells lets on, a little watery in comparison to other O'fests I've sampled. Mainly characterized by a giant malty backbone with undertones of sweet toffee/caramel and the roasty malt aftertaste. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied with moderate carbonation, leads the light, smooth characteristics of this beer. Smooth and silky, goes down with the faintest drying roasty malt aftertaste. Drinkability is great, just a hair over 5% abv, and an appreciative yet not overbearing complexity make this a superb session brew. Overall, another great beer from the folks at Flying Dog, but not the best Oktoberfest there is. Would purchase again, definitely worth a try."
"D - A nice Oktoberfest, a little on the sweet side for the style."
"The body is light and somewhat wispy. Really not much going on but very easy to drink and a light finish."
"D: I could session this one, easy. Like many good Marzens, it's easy to drink quickly and plentifully. One of the most easy-drinking, enjoyable beers I've tried. Even my generally anti-beer fiancee loved it for its great fruit notes and mild, but present, hop bitterness."
"The body is thin, but it has a nice crisp carbonation and a clean finish with a lingering caramel sweetness. Drinkability is good, but this is definitely not one of the better Oktoberfests I've tried."
"Cheers!"
"Dogtoberfest pours a medium amber color with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Not much aroma, what aroma there is I'd call malty. Flavor starts off with some citrusy hop flavor with a backbone of wet cardboard malt. I don't think there really is a better way to describe it. Unfortunate, as I think Flying Dog makes some really good beers. This isn't one of them, it's not a drain pour, but I wouldn't buy it again."
"Dark amber color with an average off-white head. Smells like toasy malts. The taste is malty for sure, caramel and roasted flavors, and a slightly herbal hop finish. The mouthfeel is great, a nice heavy medium with the right amout of carbonation. Overall, I'd say this is above average, but everyone and thier brother makes oktoberfest, so I'll probably have to wait for next year to drink more."
"A slightly above average brew that I could definitely enjoy again, but there are so many more to try!"
"By far one of the better, more well crafted brews by Flying Dog."
"Overall, a very sessionable oktoberfest, nothing great, but not bad at all."
"12oz brown bottle with no apparant freshness date but a code of 34606FX on the lable. Pours a medium amber with a 1 1/2 finger head, OK longevity and good lace. Good caramel malt aromas mixed with a hint of smoke and some mild dried fruit smells. Good malt flvors up front followed by a fair amount of hop flavor and bitterness - which quickly fades. Seems a bit watery in the finish. Crisp and refreshing. A decent Ofest but nothing to write home about."
"This brew is not a bad one. You can find many more worse beers. Maybe not the top of the line Octoberfest, but a decent one. Not much head and not much smell are the downfalls but, has a light body, somewhat crisp and clear, with some caramel notes. Easy to drink, as it has a fairly low ABV. Not a bad brew and I will drink it again."
"Terribly unfulfilling."
"Very well done! A very nice, slightly American (the yeasty sulphur) version of the classic Vienna lager style that can hold its own against the beers of Munich - particularly as they seem to be dumbing them down a little bit more each year. Kudos to the dog!"
"A thick rich mouthfeel leaves a long satisfying finish. Very good oktoberfest."
"Overall, not a very good octoberfest. There are much better choices out there."
"Overall: I was expecting better, but even still this is worth a try."
"Still, glimmering copper. Maintains a dull, lifeless appearance with an off-white head that disappears at a rapid rate. Roasted malts, and chestnuts graze the nose; more roasty/nutty aromas appear towards the middle. Medium bodied. A bit dry upfront, grainy and some dark roasted malts. Toasted wheat bread, burnt biscuits and some mild notes of chocolate in the body. Lacks the full and rich flavorings that most O-fests offer, this is passable, barely."
"Overall: Let down by the Mouthfeel, more than the staid taste profile. This has an unrefined feel to it, something is not quite right with this, whilst the annoying aspects are large in nature it feels like only a minor tweak would rescue this one and improve it no end. Rather disappointing, far from a Dog of brew, but not one that I would get again. Shame I was hoping for more."
"Enjoyable brew.."
"Poured a 12 ounce bottle last night. Light khaki color head (good amount too) that stuck around awhile. Pretty good lacing. A light copper color with reddish tones. The smell is not that great, reminds me of Dawn dishwashing detergent unfortunately. Mild hoppiness suggests some bitterness but there is a bland aftertaste. A little more sweet (from the malts) than I expected for an Octoberfest. With time, the beer becomes smoother, losing its crispness though, and gets more mellow. Slightly average beer for the style but drinkable nonetheless."
"This is a really nice fall refresher. Should go well with most ""tailgate"" foods."
"While not bad to throw back with pizza, by itself, there are too many better Octoberfest examples out there. I recommend passing on this one. From Flying Dog, stick with Doggie Style Pale Ale."
"Good label."
"The beer pours a medium amber with a half inch white head which quickly disappears. Aroma is bready and sweet malt. Balanced Malt/hop flavor. Bitterness pleasantly tickle the tongue on the finish. Not as malty as most Octoberfests but I find this very refreshing. Not too heavy but body is adequate. Drinkablity is good. This is the best Flying Dog I've had in a long time. Good effort."
"Tunes: Monolake - Zero Gravity"
"Pours a nice enough amber color into my trusty pint glass. Aroma is that of slightly nutty and roasted malts. The taste kinda gets to me. It starts out slightly catty and hoppy, but as it warms, it gets slightly sour. I don't like sour Octoberfests. Mouthfeel and drinkablity are average, except that drinkablity suffers due to the sour taste."
"12 ounce bottle. Dogtoberfest pours out a dark amber color with a large head. Much lacing remains on my glass as I drink. The aroma is very weak. I detect a little caramel and some grain, and nothing else. Flavor is light on the mouth with sweet malt and a fruitiness most often found in ales. The flavor is very clean. The finish is nice and dry, but this is the only aspect of the flavor that I enjoy. It could use some more toasted malt, and a little more hop flavor. Not a bad Oktoberfest, just not very interesting."
"Watery, lacking in flavor, and not deserving of a try. Not a 'terrible' Marzen, but one to pass on."
"Poured a medium copper color with moderate tannish head that quickly fell to a thin ring. Smell is sweet of malt . Caramel also noted. Taste is initially very dry, but then the malty sweetness kicks in, the the dryness seems to again take over. Not quite what I was expecting. A bit too dry for my liking. At the finish, the dryness takes over from the malt for a hoppy ending. This is a drinkable beer, but I've enjoyed better Oktoberfests."
"Pours a medium amber color with a thin white head. Leaves a nice lacing down the glass. The aroma is not strong. What's there is very malty with a bread-like quality to it. The taste is not challenging to the palate. Malty and bready and slightly nutty. Very smooth. Decent mouthfeel. Extremely drinkable because there are no off tastes...there just aren't very many ""on"" tastes either. This is a crossover Oktoberfest that won't challenge your palate, though there is nothing wrong with it. I don't think I'd buy it for myself, but I'd drink a boatload of it if brought to a party."
"D-This beer has a nice smooth light toast in the malt and a good hop balance. Very nice for drinking lots of and not getting palate fatigue."
"Pours nice amber color. Average head that dissipates quickly leaving thin cover. The aroma is very pleasant. Hops playing with sweet notes make for a nice seasonal, autumn smell. The taste disappointed me. Not enough flavor. The sweet caramel notes are there, but they are overpowered by bitterness. And it's not a nice hoppy, bitterness I look for in IPAs. It's harsh bitterness that sticks in the back of the mouth. Not my favorite Oktoberfest beer, but still quite decent."
"Mouth feel is light, nicely carbonated and goes down smooth."
"Pours a one finger light tan head over a crystal clear orange red-rust liquid. Smells malty sweet. Toasted grains and munich malt. Tastes sweet with chalky malt (maybe vienna) a little bit of dirty hop floral and a mild alcohol sting. The ending is wet sweet. It has a nice toasted grain character throughout. Pleasant, well balanced tasty. A little bit of sour becomes more prevalent near the bottom of the glass perhaps some phrnols from the toasted grain or maybe tannins. Md body and moderate carbonation."
"Might be a little sweet for the style, but it's a damn tasty beer. This brewery has a tendency to go overboard from time to time, but this is a good beer. I'd do this anytime. Recommended."
"A pretty good beer. The malt profile is quite true to style. the toasty, bready, light yeast anc caramel tones are modestly present in the nose and more so in the flavor. The hops throws it out of style. Overly agressive in the bittering and grassy flavors. Although I like it, it's just too much. However, it's what I expect from Flying Dog. A bit too dry and rusty in the finish. A nice beer for the season, but don't look at it as a traditional Oktoberfest"
"Body is medium, kinda chewy, and prickly with carbonation. A modest effort, not my favorite."
"cheers..."
"Really wanted to like this more, but it's rather one dimentional."
"It's not a bad O-fest, just not great. Hops character seems a bit off to me, and the nose leaves much to be desired. Body is best, enjoy it as much as you can."
"Overall a very well balanced and drinkable brew. Maybe a little hoppier than is normal for an Oktoberfest but that seems standard for the American micro versions of this style."
"This has been my favorite oktoberfest to date! I recommend it highly!"
"ng"
"The finish cleans out fairly well. A beer with planty of flavor, just shy of stepping up to the top tier of marzen beers."
"Overall a tasty brew."
"Ive been generally satisfied with this companys brews, but this one seems just a bit off the mark. Dogtoberfest pours as an amber-copper color with a clear, slight white head. Its certainly got a malty nose, but it doesnt have the bready-deepness that a good Oktoberfest provides. Taste is caramel and toast, with a touch of graininess. Moderate sweetness. Theres a bit more hops that I would expect, and they tip the balance (but not too much). Mouthfeel is soft and a little thin. Id call this a mid-tier Oktoberfest."
"Bender: A session brew, one of the better FD products. A decent enough Ofest."
"Pours a deep copper with a nice fluffy headthat took quite awhile to come down,big caramel notes in the aroma with some pizza dough scent so far so good on this one.Well the flavor of this doesnt quite match the aromas somewhat dull in comparison some lightly sweet caramel and and some lingering spice but pretty bland.Well like alot of Flying Dog brews this one left me wanting a little more,nice appearance and aroma but flat on flavor and drinkability."
"Not a bad brew by any means, they've got a good foundation of how to get a octoberfest out in the market, they just gotta fix some blending issues."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle with a reddish/amber color. The aroma is a malty caramel with some scent of burnt sugar. The flavor on this beer took me by surprise in a bad way. The first thing that came to mind to describe the flavor is rotting fruit. Perhaps an apricot flavor, but that is a stretch. It really does have a pungent and sweet taste of spoiled or over-ripened fruits. The beer has pretty much no hop flavor whatsoever. Overall it is not a great beer and I will not be drinking it ever again."
"Nice copper brew with a nice off white head that stays around for a while lots of bubbles rising too leaves a nice coating of lace, good looking beer. Aroma sweet malt heavy caramel coming thru light hops and spiceness if you search. Taste big on caramel not much on bready flavors, carbonation aids mouthfeel nice burst of sweet caramel malt followed by a let down finish lightly watery with a very light hop spice finish. First half taste is nice but finish just dies out for some reason. Mouthfeel good but finish is light. Drinkability is ok easy drinking but not the best oktoberfest around worth trying but don't think I would try again unless recipe changes. Flying Dog has a couple of really good beers the rest just seem mediocre, I had been wanted to try this finally found some."
"The beer dispenses from the 12-ounce brown bottle a luminous deep copper color with a monumental semi-creamy light tan head, that erodes ever so slowly leaving a fine velum like sheet of lace upon the glass. Nose is sweet malt, crisp and clean to the senses with the start sweet and nicely malt laden, the top is middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is stern in its acidity and the hops personable in their spiciness, the aftertaste quite dry and long lasting, a drinkable beer."
"One of the better efforts I've had recently from Flying Dog, and a very respectable festbier."
"On draught at Lazy Chameleon. Dark copper color with a thin white head. Decent lacing too. Mildly malty aroma and a bit of roastiness. The body is kind of weak, with sweet malt and a little nuttiness and hops on the back end. The finish is mostly sweet with a light hops bitterness here and there. As with most of Flying Dogs beers, the elements are all there but the execution falls short."
"The beer pours a nice amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a malty scent that boast of pale and crystal malts along with a fruity yeast finish. The taste is good as well. It has a malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes slightly bitter, dry and fruity. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good Festbier. It 's not the best I've had, but it's definately not the worst; a good drinker."
"Not the kind of beer to drink by the pitcher."
"This has quite a bit of body, and at least for my own preferences, it's a little heavy and not easy to quaff more than one. Overall a little sticky. Is this really a lager or an ale? The website claims that it's a lager, but its has somewhat ale-ish characteristics. Still a good brew, but it just finishes a little heavy for me."
"Seems an awful lot like Pete's Wicked Oktoberfest."
"This was another beer I had a chance to sample at Falling Rock recently. It poured a deep amber to copper, with a great off-white head and light lace. Light candy nose, not as much malt up front as I expected. Malty/ candy taste in the front, mild hops in the middle with a light mouth feel and medium drinkability. Not a bad beer, but a little light on the malt for this style."
"Pours a clear amber/copper liquid with a thick off-white fluffy head. The head disappeared too quickly, but there was a fair amount of lace left on the glass. Some bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Carmel smell, along with a touch of earth. Stronger malt character compared to some of the other O'fests I have sampled this year. Nice carmel malt flavor, with very little bitterness. Malt seems pretty deep and juicy. Light body with moderate carbonation. Overall, maybe a little rough, not as smooth as others, but more malt character. Pretty easy to drink. A good seasonal."
"Clear, deep amber-copper color, nice white foamy head that leaves a nice lace in the glass. Has a light nutty and malty caramel aromas, sweet, chocolate and caramel flavors, clean tasting, medium body, a little thin and semi-watery mouthfeel, this is a decent oktoberfest."
"Aroma strong in biscuit malt, kind of candy-cornish. Small yellowish cream colored head never amounted to much, but suprisingly left some solid patches of lace the beer level lowered. Transparent orange hued beer with a few slowly rising streams of bubbles. The flavor is all malt and fairly sweet, not a whole lot going on . Slightly slick feel to this fairly light-bodied beer. It's an easy drinking beer, but there's nothing interesting going on."
"Taste: sad, soggy cardboard. Meets the tongue meekly, shows some flavor, but it's not what we want in a marzen, there is malt, yes, but the body is too dull, insipid, even, leaving the flavor a very flat thing, just a dull thud in the mouth. Lordy, not even 1/3 through, and I wonder what I'm going to do with the rest of this 6-pack...there's a lot missing here, a richer feel should really be taking place on the palate, but this one is a dullard, folks. I'm hatin' it, but I so didn't want to...Unpleasant, and utterly disappointing...sorry, this is a big, fat loser!"
"This beer pours a beautiful reddish amber color with minimal head that leaves quickly. The nose is sweet and a bit caramely. I'm not usually a big fan of O-fest beers, but this one is rather nice. The flavor is not big and offensive, but well balanced. The beer is just nicely thick, but this sticks with the rest of the beer. The drinkability is wonderful. Overall a very nice offering."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Pours a nicely luminescent orange/brown with a small stark white head. Fresh aroma of roasted malt and caramel. Roasted malt dominates the palate, with a slightly unpleasant peppery astringent character lingering in the back of the mouth. Body is a touch too thin for a marzen. Like most Flying Dog beers, passable, but not spectacular."
"This is a very good beer that is easily drinkable. Not quite up to par with the Germans but still bery very good to drink."
"This is a sweet, malty beer with a pronounced hop presence for an octoberfest. I think it is a good choice for a sunny autumn day."
"Pours a dark amber color with a medium head that dies off quickly. Strong aroma of sweetness, caramel malts. Reminds me of cooking sweet malts. Malty flavor with a strong caramel character. Sweet and somewhat grainy flavor. Hints of a taste similar to a nut brown. This is a very good beer and quite a good representation of the Oktoberfest style. Highly recommended if you like a strong caramel and malt character. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer."
"This is fairly enjoyable, even if completely standard."
"Poured an attractive, glowing copper/amber color, but much lighter in color than customary for the style. Aroma was distinctively sweet in a candy-shop sort of way. While the flavor was pleasant, with sweetish caramel malt, it was too one-dimensional to be of much interest. The mouthfeel was also rather thin. Verdict: Oktoberfest Lite."
