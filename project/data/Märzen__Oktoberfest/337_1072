4,10.2,,,,,,"Overall:  So as far as the MÃ¤rzen style goes, this features an ale yeast so its a bit creamier than most Oktoberfest and less of a crisp finish.  Besides that, this is still very tasty and enjoyable in the same price point at Sam Adams Oktoberfest.  This has more of a cloying finish than most Oktoberfests, so in my opinion this is just begging to be paired with a nice hearty fall meal.  Makes me want to smoke a brisket.","Tuck_leepulin","Aug 28, 2014"

Looks like a golden amber autumn leaf, and smells as bittersweet as hooking up with a hot girl and not remembering it because you had too much to drink at Oktoberfest. It really just tastes like what beer should taste like, with perfect balance, and is by far one of the smoothest beers I have ever had. Each drink makes you want another, and against all of the other American Oktoberfest beers, this one is head and shoulders above. A must try!","Isrealite","Dec 14, 2013"

The aroma is of bread with some herbal and earthy notes from the hops. There's not much in the way of sweetness in the aroma. You definitely get the full flavor of Munich malts here with some mild hop bitterness in the background. I pick up those earthy and herbal hop flavors, but like these are mild and allow the malt profile to come through more. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The beer is crisp and smooth, permitting high drinkability. This is a very good beer.","acevenom","Sep 17, 2012"

The nose is pretty muted, not a lot going on. At most you pick up what seems to be some cinnamon or nutmeg. Maybe a little bit of malt and caramel. The taste is definitely on the malty side with hints of vanilla and caramel. The mouthfeel is very thin and alkaline like. There isn't a lingering aftertaste which is nice. This goes down real clean. Overall, while not one of my favorites, this wouldn't be a bad session beer this time of year on a cool, cloudy day.

Then it went downhill with some strange sweet syrupy tastes, diacetyl, and other weird flavors. About halfway through the beer, and all the initial strange flavors blend into the taste buds, its starting to slightly taste more like a traditional Oktoberfest, but not really.

After sipping for a while, I think the light hops actually make this a pretty balanced beer, and I'm liking the effect.

The balance is considerably sweeter than other German versions, which balance toward the dry slightly. Maybe the yeast slighlty under-attenuated, but I seriously think that it was just the grain-bill. There is likely two-row and crystal malts (Maybe cara-munich) to make up for the lightness of the base malts. I am a bigger fan of using almost entirely Munich malt for the grain bill...but that is personal preference. I will probably drink this beer again, but I won't be expecting the exact style that is printed on the bottle. It is a pretty good session beer, regardless of the intended style.","SkeeterHawk","Aug 19, 2009"

There are way too may estercy flavors in this beer, and according to any brewing book, those are off limits in a O-Fest.

4.13,13.8,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This bottle-conditioned Oktoberfest pours a slightly hazy amber body with gold and orange highlights beneath a full head of creamy off-white foam. Its head retention is good, and it slowly drops to a wide, creamy collar and cottony surface covering. Sticky splashes of lace left about the glass add to its appearance. Some delicate tart fruit in the nose is reminiscent of plums and dried apricot, and they're carried over into the flavor wrapped in sweet, lightly doughy and just slightly toasted malt. The hop bitterness is restrained, allowing the sweetness of the malt to dominate the flavor profile without becoming cloying; and a swash of spicy hops comes through clearly, also helping to dry things out. A medium-light body (and fine-bubbled, moderate carbonation) also helps to keep its yeasty fruit and malty sweetness in check; and it finishes semi-dry with some lingering maltiness at the back of the throat. This is a really unique beer! It's certainly not a traditional German-style Oktoberfest/Marzen, but more of a Munich-malt based Belgian-style beer. Interesting, satisfying, and refreshing. This would certainly make a good table beer at a Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner! Well-done!","NeroFiddled","Sep 09, 2003"
