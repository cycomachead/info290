review_text
"O: This is a stellar beer; I'd put this head & shoulders above Sam Adams or Great Lakes, my two usual Marzen."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle pour was clear orange-brown with minimal head. Aroma was toasted malts with notes of bread and caramel. Lots of malt flavors with a late sweetness and a mild hop bitterness. Soft carbonation with a medium body."
""
"Found this at a place in SF. Whenever they have it, I gotta order it. Not too many quality märzens out there, but this is definitely one."
""
""
"Paulaner Octoberfest my gold standard for Octoberfest beers."
""
""
""
"Paulaner Oktoberfest was one of my first expeditions outside the macro brew box.  To this day (15 years later) it remains one of my favorite beers. Malty, yeasty, and smooth as the day is long."
""
""
""
"From the first taste to the last, a very good beer.  Smells good tastes good poured or right from the bottle.  Well worth it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Boo this beer is bad"
""
""
""

""
""
"O: very nice, but I prefer Hacker-Pschorr;"
""
""
""
"Overall nice well balanced Märzen ... very malty, a touch sweet"

"Not a big fan of this Oktoberfest. I've had much better!"

"O: Excellent and smooth, so much so I think of Munich Lagers. Got on wishbeer.com, drank in cnx Nov 15, 2014."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, one of the better German Marzens available in the U.S. One of the standards of the style."
""
""
"Ein mal beir bitte!"
""
"Excellent beer! Very rich and original taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor, aroma, mouth feel. This one hits all the important high points for me. Rich, chocolate nose. A combination of sweet and bitter overtones beautifully balanced. Rich caramel flavors. Lovely carbonation--it is enough to notice without distracting from flavor and aroma. An almost perfect cool-weather brew."

"9/17...pours medium amber, hearty white foam, clings all over. Peppery malt nose. Smooth all malt flavor, firm carbonation, strong hop bite. Just a hint of sweetness. Balanced, smooth, delicious. One of the better Marzens I've encountered"
""
""
""
""
""
"Smooth and full of flavor. Like the finish."
""
""
""
""
"Super tasty. Low head minus an aggressive pour. It has a good light brown red color, and light grainy taste. It goes surprisingly well with any good spicy beef and potato dish."
"Pours a deep clear amber with a short-lasting white head. The aroma is malt forward with nice aromas of dark fruit (raisins) and hints of earthy hops. The taste takes this and amplifies it, adding a nice bready quality. The body is lighter but not watery and has a little bit of carbonation. A very good Marzen."
""
""
""
"After Pop!ping the cap, I began a very aggressive pour and sat back as it transitioned from a pseudo-cascade into three-plus fingers of dense, tawny head with very good retention. Color was darker than I expected, Deep-Amber/Light-Copper to Copper (SRM = > 13, "
""
"overall: decent Marzen. I assume this is their Export version and their Weisn is the version sold in Munich."
""
""
"O- Definitely one of the better Marzens I've had. The beer isn't overly sweet and actually has a substantial amount of bitterness that I find lacking in other examples of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pretty deep amber in color with a thin beige head. Light to moderate lacing is seen that sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of caramel, toasted malts and yeast and is very pleasant. The taste is even better with a bit of spicy hops in the mix as well. Just this side of medium bodied but perfect carbonation. No bitter or harsh aftertaste and a tasty example of this style of brew. One of the best ones out there! PROST!"
"Overall- For me Marzens walk a fine line of sweetness and this hits the nail on the head. Not too sweet with the perfect amount of hop spice to counterbalance the caramel/toasted malts.  A great fall beer and one that will be my go-to oktoberfest-marzen."
""

"Overall: Maybe this style of beer is my favorite. It's traditional refreshing and not really anything bad about it. I could crush a sixer of this with no problems. It's not adventurous yet isn't infected either just a good wholesome brew to watch Football or any sport for that matter. This brew is worthy!"

"Overall the sum is greater than that of the parts.  It doesn't look particularly beautiful or smell enticing but it's a very smooth, balanced, malty beer that fits in between a Helles and a Dunkel, as I think it should.  There is nothing particularly interesting about the flavors either, but also nothing offensive.  In some respects I think a good, drinkable beer should not be over the top - this one won't knock your socks off but when you finish your glass you'll most likely be wanting more.  That's probably a good mark of a festbier."

"Love this time of the year when the sweet Marzens of Octoberfest appear. Very easy drinking, smooth and a great reason to fill up "" Ein Mass"" and sit under some linden trees in a bier garden. prosit!"
""
""
""
"Not bad with it's deep color, average head and ok lacing. Malty sweet nose. Taste with a touch of spice biterness and bready malts. Pretty balanced, and a decent beer"
""
""
""
""
"O: Easy to drink and sessionable, definitely a nice example of the style and a beer that I could easily have over and over again - kind of reminds me of time spent at Oktoberfest in Munich in 2000."

"Good beer, very professionally brewed, crystal clear, polished amber color, but nothing to make it stand out."
"Enjoyable."
""
""
"Overall - Really enjoyable amber festbier; this is the slightly sweet, amber, toasty malt-bomb style that one typically thinks of when they think ""Oktoberfest""."
""
""
"Execellent example of an Octoberfest beer.  Amber glow and sweet slightly malty aroma and smooth mouthfeel.  Traditional slight finish, a good fridge beer when you want something light with a little body to it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium to dark coppery amber with a thin off-white head that retains a constant film and leaves light lacing. Aroma of bready malt with light biscuit, light grassy hops and caramel. Flavor is bready caramel malt with hints of biscuit, slight dark dried fruit and a mild, grassy hop finish. Medium bodied. Classic marzen style with a deft balance between dryness in the malt and a light sweetness overall. Flavorful caramel and biscuit malt. Enjoyable."

"Final Thoughts: Although it was past the best before date, Paulaner Oktoberfest Märzen still delivered very good flavor. I've only had a handful of beers made in this style but I think this one is at the top of my list. Would I drink it again? Yes, can't wait to find it in season in a few months."

"O - What a great lager! I'd only had Sam Adams Oktoberfest before this and I thought it was pretty darned good and looked forward to it every Autumn. This was just such an incredibly better Oktoberfest beer. Paulaner Oktoberfest is available at my bottleshop year round and it's going to be a trial to make myself wait until Autumn to buy it."

"Beutifully clear reddish gold color, nose is boozy and malty, with a light herbal finish. Initially malty and sweet, ending somewhat dry and lightly hoppy. Medium bodied and carbonated. Very easy drinking and simple; lacks the depth of flavors that would make it world class, but still enjoyable and tasty."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is crisp and easy drinking. Overall a solid marzen but the diacetyl admittedly gets to me in no time. Worth it to try as a yearly fix but not something I would drink regularly."

"The mouthfeel is crisp and light with little to weigh it down. So, I say ""Trinkst du, Paulaner! Jawohl!"
""
""

"Paulaner certainly makes an enjoyable Oktoberfest. One that's rich, flavorful, and incredibly easy to put away. I haven't picked this up often in the past but will come next September. Thanks for opening my eyes, Matt!"

"O: more than anything, i think this style (not this brew) is VERY underwhelming ... it doesn't do any one thing all that well and isn't having that sum-is-greater-than-the-parts quality. disappointing coming from Paulaner, but again, the framework of the style appears to be limiting"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: More evidence that if you're going to drink a lager, especially an Oktoberfest, you should really go with a German lager. Paulaner's Oktoberfest balanced noble hops floral and mintyness with toasted bread and molasses malt character."

"Overall it just feels run of the mill and quite ordinary, but not horrible by any means."
""
"330 ml bottle into dimpled mug, best before 5/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear orange copper color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of caramel, pear, apple, toast, bread, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of malt and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, apple, pear, toast, herbal, bread, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, toast, bread, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice and clean balance of malt and yeast ester flavors; with nice robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Oktoberfest style. All around clean and well balanced malt and yeast flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

""
"Not a bad example of the style, just not great in my book either."
"Came up a clear, pale, golden yellow with goodly white head.Head lasted a fair time, moderately good lacing on glass. Scent was a bit biscuity/floral. Tasted sweet, no discernable bitters, tastes better as it warms!"
""
""
""
"Overall: A very nice Oktoberfest. It has a full taste, but still easy enough to drink casually."
""
""
""
""
""
"Served in a wheat beer glass."
"Clean toasted grains, slight apple esters, dry toast in the aftertaste. Slight papery note, not sure if oxidation or intentional. Light feel, smooth and dry with a slight bitterness in the finish and light honey graham lingering afterwards. Mild and drinkable, maybe a little too mild."
""
"Fortunate to have tried a half liter bottle brought back from Munich. All aspects consistent with other reviews, dominant characteristics of malt and breadd.I actually prefer the darker Oktoberfests but this one is very drinkable. Definitely going to look for this locally."
""
""
""
""
""
"Perfect balanced beer, although quite malty. Straight forward but still satisfying."

"O - Almost feels like drinking liquid bread.  Alcohol is quite noticeable.  I enjoyed this beer, but, if I were to use this beer as the standard for Octoberfest Marzens, I must say that I prefer Samuel Adams', Victory's, and Ayinger's take on the style.  Nevertheless, I find this beer more pleasing than Weihenstephaner's Oktoberfestbier and other 'blonde' fest beers.  Wouldn't mind having this one again, but not in my top 3 of Octoberfest beers."
"It's great to have found another German beer that I really enjoy, especially for those into malt in a crisp lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very nice experience. I only got two in a mix six, but would definitely drink a six of this sitting in my back yard relaxing. A great Octoberfest beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Consistently enjoyable beer that helps put you in the mood for Oktoberfest. Easy to drink, just the right amount of sweetness, and nice malty flavors. Mouthfeel may be just a tad thin but certainly no problem. Never a disappointment. There may be better choices but you'll not be disappointed with this beer."
""
""
""
""
"O - a favorite and a must get for the season"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A rather enjoyable and tasty Oktoberfest with a nice sweet and decently roasted taste. Paulaner is a classic brewery for a reason; they make good stuff."
""
""

"O - A great beer. I had been growing tired of the American attempts and finally found this one on the shelf. Can't wait to try some more now that the authentic German beers are popping up for Octoberfest season."

"I am not quite sure how to describe this one. I like it. It has a slightly sweet taste to it with a pleasant aftertaste. It has a really nice mouthfeel and good carbonation. It is not a standout brew, but not one I would send back. I have a case and plan to enjoy them all."
""
""
"This is the benchmark marzen in my opinion. The appearance is a beautiful copper color as one would expect. Smell is of roasted malts with caramel notes. The taste separates this brew in that it is a perfectly balanced marzen, not overly malty like most. Just has the malt hits the palate, the hop bitterness kicks in and equalizes it. The mouthfeel is nice and soft making for one special oktoberfest brew."
""
"Definitely a great beer! If you find it, buy it. Lots of it."
""
""
"Overall this is a fantastic beer. I""m glad to know they brew this year round so it will never be a stranger in my fridge. Das Bier ist gut."
""
""
""
""
"Well malted, simple and easy drinking."
""
""
"I can't find the ingredient list. Whole Foods told me it had 4 ingredients without sugar. I don't know how to find the exact whereabouts for said ingredients. Help I am looking for an organic beer without sugar. Basic ingredients, nice flavor and no sugar or side additives. This beer gave a nice buzz, taste good but want to know ingredient list."

""
""
"This beer is enjoyable. Forgive my lack of a qualitative review of the four senses for this beer, but I am new to being able to describe a beer with a detailed level of description. I will say that having long out grown the introductory light beers that most Americans are experienced with, that this beer is on my list of brews I would not mind picking up again at the store. The after taste is bready and pleasurable. A joy to drink."

"O- a perfectly solid tasting oktoberfest lager; I wouldnt change a single thing about this brew as it is definitely not one to disappoint for lager lovers. This has now become my favorite oktoberfest beer which trumped my once beloved #1 sam adams oktoberfest. Just what you would expect to experience with an exceptional clean cut lager. Best served cold (35 degrees) in a tulip glass."

"Good Märzen but I would almost have to reach for their Wiesn instead when Oktoberfest rolls around."
""
""
""
"O – A refreshing German Marzen. Lighter than most Americans, but with a bit more flavor than a number of Germans. I especially appreciate that it lacks the American trend of over-hopping every style, but still has enough present to prevent any sense of sweetness. I'd include this in a six-pack mixer during Oktoberfest season."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In all, it's drinkable, but nothing outstanding - another Ofest in a crowded market of them."
""
""
""
""
""
"This will have to be a beer I revisit for a re-review I think, because I know I've had some really good Paulaner beers in the past. This example just didn't do it for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not really a standout for me, but delivers what I'm looking for in a marzen and is pretty good backup option."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A woody, almost paper-like taste begins to emerge as the beer warms (anyone who has ever played a woodwind instrument will know what I mean). This woody flavor is curious, if not off-putting, and further reinforces my impression that the flavor profile is a little too chaotic to reign in the ample flavors that exist. The carbonation feels a shade high as well. The boldness of this Oktoberfest is laudable, but it could use some refinement."
""
""
"Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a nice red amber with a small white head. Smells of some darker roasted grain with very slight chocolate, but very weak. Tastes of some dark roasted grain but not many specific tastes jump out. Carbonation is great and finishes very well. Overall, an average beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I would have been more satisfied with a bolder, fuller bodied beer. A decent Oktoberfest, not fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
"Although they originated the style, I tend to think most of the German Marzens that I have sampled are inferior to their American cousins. This one does not match the top U.S. Oktoberfests, but it comes closer than any German Marzen I have tasted so far."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, dark, burnt orange with a medium, creamy light tan head. Aromas of freshly milled grain. Taste begins initially with a huge light caramel sweetness. Following that is a grainy, bready middle, and a flowery, perfumy finish. Nice balance between the sweetness and bitterness. Mouthfeel is good. Overall a very good Marzen that I would purchase again."
"Paulaner's Oktoberfest pours a brilliently clear copper, with a decent amount of orange highlights. Roughly a finger of soapy white foam comes together atop the beer, leaving a little bit each of head retention and lacing in its wake. The nose is definitely a bit dull. I know this style isn't necessarily supposed to have the most bombastic aroma, but it really is barely there. There are some light toasted bready notes, as well as just a hint of herbal noble hops. The flavor profile, while following the nose step for step, is easily more potent. A deceptively deep maltiness leads off, very biscuity in nature. The hops are again playing a secondary note, with an earthy, herbal quality present against the dominant malty character. The mouthfeel is fairly full bodied, with just a little bit of carbonation cutting through. Paulaner Oktoberfest is a really nice well, and holds up better than some of the other German imports I've had."
"It is a fine beer on its own if you like the amber side. Extremely well crafted and pure. It is one of the original beers that qualified for the actual Oktoberfest. Tested by time and true, a flavor of history that is so damn enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: Very clean and refreshing. Great fruitiness. Fall is here!"
""
"O- A good Oktoberfest beer, clean, crisp and enjoyable."
"This beer is smooth, medium to full bodied, medium carbonation, and easy to drink. I am overall impressed with this beer, but would have been happy to see more maltiness and maybe some nuttiness to it."
""
""
""
"Big doses of lager yeast with a dense grainy malt background. Very good looking beer as well. A solid pick for Das Boot!"
"O- By no means is this my favorite Oktoberfest, but I never have a problem polishing off two-three pints of this in one sitting. A great/classic example of an Oktoberfest. Definitely worth a try. Prost."
""
""
""
""
""

"The beer pours a very light amber, bordering on dehydrated piss coloring with a lovely finger width head of soapy white bubbles that stick around. The color actually reminds me of changing leaf colors which is a nice nod to the season. Lacing is light and cloudy, with just a few dots and lines edging up the glass. The body is clear and full of a torrent of bubbles that are racing to the surface. The beer smells surprisingly spicy with yeast that has an almost spicy hot tingling in the nose. Touches of bread and sweet toasted malts are clearly present, with a nice side showing of earthy hops reminiscent of decaying leaves. The beer tastes sweet and caramelly with a big rush of decaying leaves in the middle of the taste which wonderfully offsets the sweet malt. The beer begins as sweet toasted caramel malts before it opens into the hops earthy-leafy flavor in the middle of the taste. The sweet malts transition back in at the end of the taste and into the aftertaste, along with the spicy yeast notes and a touch of bready malt. Mouthfeel is clean and just a smidge to thick for the style, leaving the tongue clean but for a touch of saliva, and the rest of the mouth slightly dry with sweet lingering. Overall, I have to say that this is my favorite of the German Märzens I have sampled. It is much more complex in flavoring than the others, with some wonderful yeast spices. Unfortunately, this also makes the beer a little too thick to continuously slug back, though I don’t really see that as a huge problem as I could still drink quite a few of these in the course of a day. Good beer, worth a try and a retry. Prosit!"
"This was truly a wondrous surprise, it's not my favourite style, but at Oktoberfest you have to drink something ! However, you can see the beauty in those glasses. Appearance almost a 5 - clear, lovely foamy head, but of course the Marzen style has little hop aroma so no extra marks for smell. The taste was delightfully balanced, good depth of malt but not overpowering in the slightest. Overall, another total gem from 'Phil and Ted's World Tour of Bavaria'. Do not underestimate the experience of tasting the beer at source."
"Overall, this is a solid authentic representative of this style. As should be coming from the source and origin of the style. Drink up!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent drinkability. A perfect German session Lager. Paulaner quality. Prost!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- good Oktoberfest. Wish the skunk aroma wasn't there but still is a very tasty beer."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a tawny brown with about an inch and half foamy head. Nice bubbles coming off the bottom of the drink. Clear as crystal. Weak retention and lacing. Smells of spice and floral hops. Some citrus also. Nice malt sweetness pulling through. Taste of slight spices. Good balance of malt and hops with low bitterness at the finish. A little watery, but smooth nonetheless. A pretty good marzen"

"Some aspects of this beer suggest that Paulaner's Oktoberfest Märzen may be one of the best Märzens out there. I suppose I'll have to travel to Munich before I can say for sure."

"O - Such an easy drinking beer with a delicious malty profile."
""
""
""
""
"O: Got a twelve pack of these, I would be very surprised if I didn't knock back at least 6 tonight. I'd like to freeze it in the winter so I could skate on it and melt it in the spring time and drink it."
"O- A pretty good Oktoberfest beer with a little more sweetness than I typically like for the style. Highly drinkable."
""
"Overall, a fairly malt forward beer that has good malt character and a decent amount if hops to keep it in check. Very drinkable brew."
""
""
""
""
""

"Crystal clear copper colored liquid topped with a good sized frothy white head. Lightly sweet, doughy aroma...fresh grain and floral hops. Fresh, grainy sweetness, nuts, and earth. There's some kind of dry, dusty blandness that follows each sip and drags the good qualities down with it. Nice, firm, medium body. Not the greatest - could use some more rich, toasty malt to counteract the cleanliness."
""
""
""
""
"O: I really liked this one but there are better marzen's out there. However, I found this to be really refreshing and a good drink nonetheless."
"Unfortunately, Paulaner's rendition of this seasonal style is not the biscuity, bready, softly balanced, moderately ABV-enhanced standard-bearer that I was expecting, but adequate enough in what it does offer, once those awkward umami moments (say that 10 times quickly, or after finishing this can) have passed. And nice of the manufacturers in the Bavarian Land to allow we foreigners to experience the same overindulgences they do, as not so subtly suggested by this crazily (but apt) bloated serving size. Prost, I guess."

""
""

"D: pretty solid oktoberfest, no frills, true to the grain."
""
""
""
"O:  A solid Munich Marzen that has the spicy hop profile to back the toasted caramel and toffee malt base.  Not overly complex but great flavors that provide a delicious October brew.  The dose of hops may be a tad too much for the style but I liked it due to the fact that I love hops. Be sure to add this to your Marzen line up to try. Cheers! "

"Overall - This is a total honey bomb, with a greater emphasis on malts than hops. I don't know that I could session this, but it's certainly good for a try here and there. Would I buy it again? IDK... so many god beers, so little time (and money)."
"mouthfeel is light, but deceivingly so due to the dark tint of the beer. overall, it's a 'standard'. something you can go to and always know it'll be decent. good ol' germany. decent beer, bratwursts, and beautiful long-leggged blondes. what the heck else do you need to be happy?"
""
"O-a bit too adjunct tasting for me. This really isn't how I like my German oktoberfests. It doesn't have a good taste and it isn't something I could drink all might long."
"Fresh bottle. Pours a clear copper amber with a solid dose of white foam that laces nicely. Bready, toasty, caramel - pretty standard Oktoberfest profile. Clean with a mild floral bitterness. A touch of grape-like fruitiness. Dry with above average carbonation. A nice example of the style. Worth picking up a bottle or two this time of year."
"Not my favorite, but I can definitely see what this beer has going for it."
""
""
""
"Taste is sweet, with a hint of roastiness. Drinks quite smoothly, with a slight citrus tang at the finish. Superb, rich in flavor, and an ideal Oktoberfest. A winner!"
""
""
"O: very drinkable session beer. Relatively high ABV is well hidden."
""
"O: By the standards of the style, it's outright fantastic. Both wonderfully malty and smooth at the same time, this one is a joy to chug. One of the best marzens I've had not from Schlenkerla (which is a whole other beast entirely...)"

"Pretty nice, balanced Octoberfest."
""
""
""
"O - Malt-driven to a T, Paulaner's Oktoberfest-Märzen is tasty and masterfully brewed, but it departs the style solely in that I don't find it as drinkable as other German oktos of the same ilk. Very good indeed, I quite enjoy it, I just wouldn't choose a liter of it."

"Poured into a glass mug. Pours clear amber with a tall, off-white head that dissipates slowly. There are lots of tiny streaming bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Some lacing is left behind as the head dissipates. There are aromas of bready malt and grassy and floral hops. The taste follows the nose. It's very bready. The hop bitterness is not strong, but it does lend some nice balance to the flavor. The body is light with adequate carbonation. The finish is smooth and dry. The drinkability is high. Overall, this is an excellent example of this style. Definitely give it a try."
""
"M. Medium bodied, lighter side of medium carbonation levels."
"O: a great example of traditional octoberfest. This one will always be on my top list. It has everything you could want in a beer"

"Overall, this is just a really good marzen, and very sessionable. I'm surprised it doesn't get better ratings. There's nothing wrong with this, and I'll choose it over the other boring, predictable seasonals any day."
""
"D - It's got clean flavors, is balanced relatively well, and is easy drinking, but it is a little boring and definitely simple. I could go either way on this one."
"Aaaand since that's not enough characters, I'll just let everybody know that I love my dog."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is solid- medium light body supported by ample but not excessive carbonation. I like this style a lot but must wait until late August to get a really good sampling."
""
""

"The body is light to medium. It coats the mouth a little but itsn't drying. Classifies as refreshing."

"A very sessionable beer with great balance and full flavor. Not the best Octoberfest out there, but a traditional flavor nailed. Very enjoyable."

"Trader Joe's was selling big, huge aluminum barrels of this stuff. I exaggerate, but the cans on display were more-than-generous; more apt to be footstools or pieces of a makeshift barrier than a beer serving size. Still,　splitting one of these azure monoliths with a friend didn't seem too greedy. Orange and frothy, this looks like a festival beer - good for celebrating outdoors where heady rays of sunshine and noise from adjacent crowds make good complements to the otherwise simple notes of honey paired with the crispness of pilsner malt and sharp carbonation. Unengaging, the Pauler Marzen is best left to being a session beer, or served with powerful dishes, or to slake undiscriminating thirsts. It deserves a glass boot more than a chaise."

"This is one of my favorite beers. It is amber and smells wonderful. The malts sing out and make me wish I was in Bavaria drinking a ""mass"" in a ""prosit for Gemutlichkeit"". I forgot to add this review when I had this in the fall. Germans love it, and you will too..it is worth the wait for 8-9 more months..Oktoberfest 2012. Malt flavor is tops, but it is not sweet. It goes down so smoothly that you wish it was sold by the liter here."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Completely drinkable. A simple brew with much history behind it. I consider this a great party beer. You can knock thee down without being worn out by too much sugar or hops. I can't knock it but I also won't buy it often just because Marzens aren't my favorite style."

"Given my general taste for German beers, I was disappointed with Paulaner for this beer, nothing at all similar to any of the best Oktoberfest beers I've had. In general I would prefer a heavier, less wimpy German beer for the most German of all holidays."
""
""
""
""
"O-Very drinkable,but it must be cold in the glass!"
"O: Normally I would down a beer for these light characteristics, but I understand that a Oktoberfest is supposed to be smooth, crisp, and easy to drink. This beer hits all these qualities and I could imagine a large group of people drinking this all day at a festival. This beer is nice for what it promises and yeah I could drink a pack of this on a hot day."
"D: Very drinkable Oktoberfest beer.... Just what a Oktoberfest beer should be... good malt flavor with a good ABV for the style. Worth looking for."
"Pours a nice dark bronze / copper with nice lasting tan head. Aroma of toasted barley, sweet malt, bready, yeast and some slight fruity notes. Taste is same as aroma. Palate is a nice medium body with a nice smooth mouth feel and good carbonation. Finish is toasted barley and sweet biscuit malt with some yeast and light fruity notes and mild sweet bitter ending. Overall a very good drinkable and flavorful brew. A nice autumn brew."
"O- Not true marzen. It's good, not great. 1L is an awful lot for this beer."
"O - Overall a decent beer, not great but not bad either."
"An old favorite. A lacquered tan color complemented by a light, crisp aroma. Slightly malty with a clean, sharp finish—it’s everything I want in a marzen. Not sure if it’s brewed year round or the bottles that are available are old but on tap it’s fantastic."
"Not bad. I know it's regarded highly in the marzen world, but I don't think it's as good as Ayinger."
"Taste: See Overall on top"
"Light tan to eggshell white colored head, crests at about a half a finger, minimal retention and evaporates down to the surface quickly, little stickiness to the lacing as well. Clear amber orange to brown in color, lightens to a yellowish orange at the glass bottom, only a trace of bubbles visible. While there’s a decent core of malted milk balls, caramel and molasses to the nose there’s also a surprising amount of herbaceous notes and raw grains, at times gives it as much of a pretzel dough as bread character, offers more lemon zest than mix of peach, apple, pear fruit scents. Medium-bodied, zesty and refreshing mouth feel with that herbal side paired with pepper and flowers, the lemon contributes to forestalling the arrival of the caramel, molasses, honey aspects. White raisin and fig supplement the peach, apple fruit here and helps sweeten the back half. Carbonation is somewhat weak, more tiny prickle than a real contributing presence. Still, overall its freshness is appealing and it hits the “sweet spot” frequently enough to stay balanced and approachable."
"Note - glass supplied is large enough and heavy enough to warm beer quickly(!)."
"-Overall 3.5: Certainly one of, if not the best Oktoberfest beer available in the US. This is worth picking up, either in cans or bottles. I've had both and both are excellent session beers and are also excellent with food, particularly my favorite German dish: Saurbraten. Only available for a limited time, so buy 'em if you find 'em!"
"Overall- Probably one of the Oktoberfest's you could skip without worry."
"Overall: a decent Oktoberfest. Very sessionable. A perfect ""watching the leaves fall"" kinda brew."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavours and aromas. Solid Oktoberfest beer!"
"O: This is a solid, enjoyable beer. Anyone looking for a great example of the Marzen style would do well to start here."
"O=Great example of the style, and up there with the best of Marzens. Definitely worth a look!"
"A solid Oktoberfest, and one of the classics to use as a starting point for those unfamiliar with the style."
"Pours light red/amber with no head leftover. Aroma of spices, slight cinnamon bun, maple. Tastes of spice, slight apple skin, dried dark fruits, malt sweetness and some vague gingerbread. Light carbonation and light body. Some great balanced sweetness here. A fall beer through and through"
"D: An exceptionally well-balanced, easy-drinking Maerzen. A bit shallow, maybe, but perfect to knock back by the Mass. Prost!"
"O: Everything about this seemed just slightly above average, and then the odd flavor kind of threw me. I liked the Brooklyn Oktoberfest better."
"A decent lager but the flavour profile gives away that it isn't really an Oktoberfest."
"I just had to have the giant mug and can when I saw it, a novelty for sure but I love my new mug I'll never have a reason to use, maybe I'll start reviewing 40's just so I can use the mug"
"Nice one finger of off-white head that left plenty of lacing. appearance is a golden amber with medium carbonation that left small traces of bubbles. The taste is mostly malt with a hint of bitterness. A very smooth drinkable Marzen beer that in my opinion is much better that the American versions."
"RJT"
"D: Quite drinkable, goes great with popcorn."
"Cheers!!"
"Overall: A very tasty Oktoberfest, drinkable, and somewhat light. True to style, and most excellent with the season."
"The beer pours a medium amber color with a white head. The aroma is full of toffee and biscuit malt, with a little bit of grass from the hops. The flavor is very malty. I get quite a bit of toffee, with some lighter malts mixed in as well. There is a little bit of grape character to the flavor and a little bit of grass in there as well. Thin to medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"a bit average Märzen, lacks a bit of character and distinction, there are more inspired Märzens around"
"2009 Overall Impression: Well, it's drinkable, but just a little sad for a beer that used to carry a good, malt character to it. I might have a couple to confirm if I was missing something in the first one. Just a bit thin this year."
"Overall this is a simple, surprisingly flavorful and quality Oktoberfest style. I would never choose to drink a traditional Marzen anytime other than with food because the flavors aren't distinct/enjoyable enough more often than not, but this makes a perfect accompnayment to any meel when you don't want the beer to shine too strong over the meal pairing."
"Overall- Much different than any other Oktoberfest that I have had but I rather enjoyed it alot. Cheers!"
"Poured a brilliant orange/amber color, with a smallish beige colored head. A little spicy on the nose, with a bit of caramel, some cereal and rye bread. On the palate, this one is sweet, crisp and medium bodied, with some caramel, toasted malt and cereal."
"The body is light and the carbonation is good. Overall not bad, but somehow it seems to be the American brewers are doing this style better these days."
"Had this and the rest of the Paulaner line up at a recent Oktoberfest in DE. Like it alot."
"O- Very tasty oktoberfest."
"If you aren't a big Oktoberfest person this is the beer that will turn you on."
"The flavor and finish were all very nice but it was hard to get over the smell."
"Frothy white head lasts several minutes and sits upon a amber-yellow brew. A little bit drier than I expected--I thought there'd be more sweetness from the malt as I've found in other Märzens. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the beer hangs together quite well and is probably more drinkable as a result of the drier taste and crisp finish."
"O- This might not be my favorite in the style, but it's still the standard by which I judge others in the style. It's a good, standard example of the style."
"This pours a nice amber color with an okay white head. The smell is a grainy bready smell. Feel is medium to light. The taste is pretty somewhat light, yet good, I get the bready malts with a little toffee at the end. Overall a nice oktoberfest."
"One of many O-Fests finally getting sampled this year. Took me long enough... It pours a mostly clear rusted copper topped by a finger of light dusty-cream foam. The nose comprises mild caramel, wheat, light rye bread, orange zest, and coriander. The taste brings in more of the same, with a more pronounced caramel flavor and an addition of a few cashews. This nuttiness and maltiness really helps this brew pop a bit. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly smooth feel. Overall, this is probably my favorite of the European O-Fests available 'round here. Not bad at all."
"A refreshing beer and about as good as a Marzen (that’s not deliciously smoked) can get."
"Overall, this beer is just OK. While it may be true to style, it is not dynamic. It is meant more for drinking out of a large stein in the open air than sipping in the living room. That said, the former scenario sounds like a great time."
"D-Very drinkable. The flavor is good and it is not too filling. It would be great to spend and entire day at Oktoberfest drinking this."
"Sampled from a bottle - best by May 2012. Nutmeg brown in color with an orange hue and perfect clarity. Poured with a modest frothy white head that reduced to a wispy cap and a few sticky lacings on the glass. Crisp, sweet, bready malt aroma with a hint of nuts and an earthy undertone. Bready malt flavor up front, tangy, lemon citrus in the middle and smooth, wet, mellow finish. Smooth, clean and mellow. An easy drinking, satisfying autumn lager. After trying a hand full of oktoberfests this season, this one is pretty damn good."
"Overall: Good beer overall. Definitely worth a shot."
"Overall: A pretty decent take on a Marzen. Tasty and pretty easy drinking."
"O - very tasty and at the same time easy to drink beer."
"Wasn't overly impressed with this Oktoberfest, though I'm a big fan of Paulaner's other brews. Pours a medium brown with almost no head. Smell is sweet and malty, and the taste is smooth -- but for a marzen, it just seemed a little flat to me. Wanted it to have just a bit more of a kick to it. That said, its taste is very well balanced and this would be a great session beer for the fall/winter. Glad I got a six pack of it -- just not sure if I'd buy it again."
"O: Finally a good Oktoberfestbier from Munich - after the likes from Hofbräu, Löwenbräu and Spaten I was beginning to loose faith. This one from Paulaner doesn't contain all of those (more or less) unpleasant flavours I've encountered with the others. It's drinkable and smooth, with a nice fruity, herbal and spicy touch, and does the job quite well for me."
"this poured a very good and dark orange color with a malty head. Classic aromas of grains, a lot of cereal, some oranges and copper tones as well. Medium/full bodied with a lot of malty tones and some oranges on the palate. Very good with the feel being what was best on the beer"
"O: very drinkable and would have never known this is 6%. Quite yummy! Definitely want to comp pare to a bottle and going to order another one!"
"Half litre bottle. No real head retention, pale colour, very clear. Smelled hints of hay. This beer was on the sweet side but well balanced. It was crisp, refreshing and went down very well. Wasn't complex but thats not the point of this one. Without doubt the most drinkable Oktoberfest beer i've had"
"Overall Drinkability - Not a very good beer; not good for its style either."
"I liked this, but I probably won't buy it again. There are others I found that are more pleasing to my tastebuds and to my wallet."
"O: Overall a decent representation of the style, easy to drink and perfect for the season, I could easily drink a few of these in a setting."
"Easy to drink is what I'd say overall."
"Pours a clear copper orange with a 2 inch off-white head that settles to a thin cap. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is very biscuit-like with some caramel and citrus aromas. Taste is exactly like the smell with biscuit, caramel, and some citrus zest on the finish. There is really no bitterness but there is a weird astringency on the tongue after each sip. A good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good Oktoberfest beer but I am not a fan of the astringent aftertaste I am getting from this bottle."
"O: A good Oktoberfest, very straightforward. I seem to like those offerings in the style that branch out a bit from this. It doesn't excite me in any one regard, but is so solid in all I bump it's overall rating up to 4.0."
"This is a damn fine Oktoberfest. Smooth and nutty upfront, with raisiny malts. Finishes up with some noble-tasting hops that sneak in behind the big mask of malt. While that sounds big, nothing here is overpowering at all. Mouthfeel is light, crisp, and the tastes are moderate enough to drink this in large quantities throughout the fall. Which, by the way, hasn't begun yet; good for me."
"overall nice, not the best of the style but decent, nice malts, some good hops on the finish, could have used a bit more of a clean dry finish, and the beginning it starts slightly watery which was a bit of a throw off, but overall it was nice."
"O – A very drinkable beer with plenty of flavor. A year-round brew that one can drink multiples of."
"O- Excellant O-Fest beer and worth seeking out. Having just reviewed SA O-Fest this blows it out of the water. The Sam Adams tastes weak and watery in comparison."
"Final Thoughts: Very nice. I would drink this anytime."
"The carbonation level could be a bit higher and help things come together otherwise still a terrific beer."
"Overall: Good, but something missing for my tastes. Anxious to try more Oktoberfests as the season goes on."
"O - A classic example of the style, totally reminds me of fall and something I look forward to getting again soon."
"O- I am not a huge Marzen fan, but this one is better than most of the American takes on the style that I've had."
"I could see gulping down huge glass steins of this beer all day long while eating giant pretzels, roasted sausages and schnitzel until it comes out of my ears. You'll want to keep me away from the sauerkraut and sauerbraten, if you know what's good for you."
"This brew pours out as a nice looking amber color. The head was a light tan color that leaves a little bit of lacing. The smell of the beer had some really nice autumn aromas to it. There was the smell of dried leafs, some cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg. The taste of the beer wasn't overly spiced at all. It was rather mellow tasting. The malts were the biggest part of the flavor. There wasn't much in way of hops. The mouthfeel was smooth and drinkable. Overall this was a pretty nice Märzen."
"0 - I have only tried a few offerings from Paulaner, but I have yet to be disappointed. This is a good representation of the style."
"O: An okay Oktoberfest, but not the greatest."
"O - Recommended and well worth a try"
"Based on drinking this, I will be trying other Paulaner offerings."
"This beer is a poster child for the style, and it does very well as such. I do believe it has been surpassed by exceptional variations such as NG's Staghorn."
"Great session beer, you drink one and crave another."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into dimple glass. This beer is my top 5 rated oktoberfest beers. Clear and deep golden pour with a nice creamy and laceing white head. The nose is sweet, malty. It starts with a mild mouthfeel and a sweetish, biscuit-liked flavour The aroma has mainly a malty character completed by light spicy, herbal/hay and bottom fermented yeast notes. The clean finish is tiny spicy, citric and a bit dry which remain in a herbal liked aftertaste. In spite of its relatively higher ABV, it's easy drinkable. Mild and rounded."
"D-Awesome. I cannot wait to try this at oktoberfest in Munich. Could drink liters upon liters of this brew"
"Summary: This is a great beer. I gave it 8.4/10, or a B. Something about this beer screams ""fresh ingredients"". It tastes very natural. While the beer doesn't particularly jump out at me, it goes down well and is filling like an Octoberfest beer should be. Goes great with chicken, sauerkraut, and bratwurst."
"Overall, what we liked best about this brew was how well the taste made up for a fairly weak and faint aroma. The sipping was clean, for the most part, and easy. The inclusion of the ultra malty flour sensation in both the aroma and the taste conjured up curious thoughts from the drinker."
"PAULANER Oktoberfest Marzen--Longneck Advancing Frau Bar Maid Legions Logo--2010 11.2 oz. Bottle. 5.80% ABV. 20 IBU's? (2.0 / 5.0) No lace fizzy thin head. Clear dark thin amber color. German Fest stanky mild hop front. Mild sweet mild caramel malty medium bodied Fest flavor. Easy smooth mild Noble hop end. Stanky by design? or just travels poorly? Dumped 3rd Bottle. Tired of pretending this is a good true to style Fest. Sampled 12/25/2010. 6-Pack purchased for $8.99 @ The Ballard Market, Seattle on 9/14/2010."
"D -- This is a very approachable beer for any drinker, and well suited for the extended session."
"D: This isa nice Marzen. A classic and great session beer for early fall. Hot days followed by cool nights."
"D: smooth, full of flavor and low achohol. This would be a good session beer."
"A nice Ocktoberfest lager light bodied smooth taste. When held up to the light the color is a clear amber. Malty on the front lightly toasted caramel flavor, mild hop profile. The nose is pretty subtle, mostly the malts come through. Very drinkable, moderate carbonation on pour about two fingers or so, light after settling. I definitely would drink this for a session beer during Oktoberfest."
"12 oz bottle. Pours reddish in color with a small, white head. Aroma is of caramel malt and some cherry. Medium, smooth body. Flavor was caramel malt and cherry, balanced by earthy hops. Finish becomes earthy and dry. Not my favorite, but still very nice Oktoberfest."
"Overall: I have been saving this beer for review, but I realized I was running out of time. Last year, Paulaner was my second favorite German Marzen lager; however, this year it was my favorite. It delivers exactly what I am looking for in a Marzen lager: smooth, sweet malty deliciousness."
"Pours a light amber with an off-white head. Not too much lacing or retention in this pour. Sweet malt aroma, also a bit of apple. Very well put together taste. Nice clean sweet malt to start. Light hints of apple again in the middle and ends with a mild burst of grainy hops. Nothing in the flavor profile truly stands out, but mixes together perfectly. Clean, crisp and very refreshing for the style. Drinkability is great."
"Taste is clean, almost too clean with very little flavor. Gingerbread and a hoppy sweet snap in the middle. Actually, it's blander than I'm describing. Smooth mouthfeel with a little Euro slickness."
"D: A very good Märzen. I wouldn't hesitate to drink it again."
"A deep amber, nearly mahogany color with an average, uninspired/-ing off-white head, the pour yields a wonderfully clean, softly-rich, simple malt aroma featuring subtle touches of bubblegum, phenols, and coppery-metallic qualities. The flavors are spot-on, uniquely Marzen - firm, light and smooth malt backbone with some spicy, gingerbread notes. Flows through almost flat but awesomely satisfying - neat drinkability. A delicate warm rush of alcohol chases on the end, keeping the palate fresh and alert. A go-to."
"This will probably be one of my last Oktoberfests of the year - I love fall beer selections and make a point try try a few new ones each year. This poured out of a chilled bottle into a pint glass a nice light rust color with almost no head or retention. My overall impressions is a classic Oktoberfest with a bit of a livelier feel than most. There is a floral, caramely taste that I like, but is not quite right for the style in my mind. It finishes with a bitter, then nice and bready aftertaste. Quite refreshing and drinkable, though not terribly memorable."
"d: Clean and very drinkable."
"D - Drinkable, enjoyable, well-made beer. However, I personally find it a little one-dimensional with its slightly harsh hops and muted malt flavors."
"I'll have to try this on tap."
"D: Good Oktoberfest style, really like the hop characters in the taste and nose that balance it out. I would definitely pick this one up next year for the Oktoberfest celebrations!"
"Ein prosit!!!"
"Very good Oktoberfest, but still can't beat Hacker-Pschorr."
"D - Easy to drink and nice and cooling on a summer's day."
"Chilled bottle poured into a glass"
"drinkability: very drinkable, comes off as lighter yet still pleasant to drink; but it is lacking in abv and could stand to have a bit more harvest notes."
"The mug's gone before I know it. Looks great, tastes very good, which is what's most important."
"Pours a moderate orange-brown with a white head. A bit of lacing on the way down my pilsner glass. The nose brings some light hops as well as caramel and bread. The flavor is a bit more plain with some light bready notes and a bit of caramel and toffee. Feel is nice with good carbonation. Hearty. Drinks quite well and is one of the classics, for me at least."
"D: Drinking this beer is a breeze; it goes down very smoothly, which makes it very sessionable."
"This is a very enjoyable Oktoberfest -- Prost!"
"**Got another bottle for Christmas, brought up the scores for taste and drinkability. Really great flavors for an Oktoberfest, probably my favorite of the style."
"D: Very high. I see myself going back to the bottleshop for another 6pack of these."
"Pours a clean yellow to orange-ish color with a white head. In the aroma, earthy with hints of fruitiness. In the taste, earthy, dry hops, and ends with a fruitiness. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry to clean small fruit in the aftertaste. Nice balance and earth, but a bit too fruity."
"D=Very Very Very smooooth,this is one of your oktoberfest marzens that you can just chill out and enjoy....after halfway through the 1st one i was already for my 2nd.Cheers to all!!!"
"Another quality Oktoberfest brew, great for any Oktoberfest or for any time of the year, for that matter."
"Very drinkable and nice flavor. Will buy again as it is easy on the mouth."
"Mouthfeel is light and smooth with a nice even carbonation. Like the scent and taste the feel is a little lackluster. I can see drinking this as a good session beer but it's not one I would buy regularly. For oktoberfests it's satisfying but not great."
"Excellent session beer. Very drinkable. I think I've found my new favorite Oktoberfest beer."
"Actually I find this boring, could have been any macro brew."
"Overall- Very drinkable and excellent example of the style. Bigger hop presence than I would have anticipated, but it really helps reinforce the drinkability and crisp finish. Lighter bodied and thirst quenching, but still retains a nice malt complexity and firm backing hops! All I need is a 1 L mug..."
"D: Overall, quite good. But Staghorn is better."
"Really enjoyed this beer during Oktoberfest. The color, smell and taste are great. The appearance looks average.The mouthfeel is light and goes down easy. It is not hard to drink. I would definitely find myself drinking this beer not just during Oktoberfest."
"Poussin very clear, orange honey colored with a 2 finger hard that recedes quickly. Pretty standard color, wish the retention lasted longer. No lacing. Aroma is bready malts, a little caramel and lager yeast. Has a nice crisp lager bite to it and also has some bready characteristics on the finish. Nice clean finish and ample carbonation. Really begs for roasted chicken dishes, even roasted pork. There is also a really nice clean quality to this that makes this very drinkable and perfect this time of year. Great package too with the glass included!"
"D- is good. The taste and the way it feels in your mouth really seem to go together, i could drink a few of these."
"this beer pleases me..it's good to be the king."
"Taste, a little bland, but enough heft to not be watery like a lot of the octo's from this side of the pond. Creamy. In the middle in terms of dryness. Hops and alcohol remain pretty undetectable. Wanted more to say about this, but it became pretty unremarkable. A little pricey, unless you're really into this style, I can't see this being anywhere near a customary purchase."
"D - Very drinkable...I can attest after 5 liters of this at Oktoberfest!"
"Honey gold in colour and crystal clear. Has a well retained fluffy white head. Greets your nose with aromas of lightly toasted bread, honey, and floral hops. Tastes of biscuit malt, honey, and lemon with a hint of caramel. Pretty good beer, but doesn't really match my expectations going in either. It's only a shade darker than most of the pale lager styles, and there's really only the slightest hint of caramelized and toasty notes to differentiate it in terms of flavour and aroma. Am I missing something here? It's a light bodied beer with medium carbonation. Goes down nice and easy, doesn't fill you - you'd almost think it was made for drinking in large quantities."
"D: Definitely want another."
""
"The taste follows with nice toasted, bready malt.  A kiss of sweetness from caramel malt.  Lingering toast and noble hop earthy bitterness.  Mild pleasant fruitiness emerges mid way through the pint.  "
""
"Pretty high. It's smooth, very easy drinking beer."
"Drinkability - Aftertaste isn't too jaunting to disuade, decent brew with hints of complexity, but nothing that slaps you in the face. Good enough taste to bring me back."
"Drinkability: This is drinkable enough. It would be easy to have a second, and I'd be happy to have this one again. But that being said I found it a bit lightly favored for the style and thought both the color and the malt presence should have been more definite. There are others I'd choose in preference to this one."
"Pours a hazy orange color with an average white head that recedes to a foam on top of the beer. Smells of a sweet malt, a little bready, a little bit of fruitiness in there too. The taste is not as potent as other marzens, but its still a full taste, it has a sweet bready or toasty malt, with a little bit of citrus hop. Very crisp and clean taste. Mouthfeel was light and carbonated, but smooth. Overall, an enjoyable beer,but not the best marzen I will ever taste. I will probably buy this again once I have tried all the other marzens I can get my hands on."
"Drinkability is quite high and I can see why this is brewed for mass consumption."
"Not overly expensive, tastes great and would go well with a hearty fall dinner, football game on TV, or just hanging out with your buddies. In fact I think as long as they aren't ""lite beer"" people, anyone would like this one."
"A good example, but I could use a more balanced malt profile."
"Drinkability: I'd have another, but there are better offerings."
"Drinkability is nice - above average flavors and mouthfeel keep you engaged, but not yearning for more."
"D= For me the drinkability was very good went down really smooth and very easy to drink. really decent beer here."
"D= Overall a decent brew. I've had better and I've had worse. A little more flavor and a little mroe weight and this would be much better but still worth a try from a legendary brewery."
"Drinkability> Good."
"D: Easy drinking, nothing offensive. A classic Oktoberfest."
"The beer tastes great, it is definitively a full flavoured beer. Decent hop balance. However, I wish there was a bit more depth and character to the beer. The overall feel of the beer is that the alcohol is not well masked, it goes down a little rough; but it is still an above average Oktoberfestbier."
"D_Delicious easy drinking. Perfect example of the Okto style."
"This has quickly become one of my favorite beers. I can't stop thinking about it. Rich amber goodness is my friend. It's hearty and has a high alcohol content, but that doesn't stop it from going down better than any beer. I have put off writing anything about this beer, because I like it so much that I really don't want to try to isolate all the flavors. Paulaner Oktoberfest is more of an experiential brew for me. One day I shall make a pilgrimage to Munich."
"Taste: Very easily drinkable as far as taste goes. Slightly spicy, with sweet malts and some bitter fall fruit flavors noted in the scent. Quite carbonated. The whole experience has a nice autumnal vibe to it."
"Had this beer the other day as its just starting to come around for the season. I've also had their regular original helles lager style beer that actually smells similar to this but this has a bit more maltier richer smell I guess because of its marzen style. It tastes like their helles lager but with a maltier taste like I said before that gives it a richer body in my opinion. That richer body really gives this beer the higher ranks. Some Noble hops at the end but not as much as their original lager. All around a good Octoberfest beer that I would recommend if you wanted a good solid import German beer."
"Seems like a thick beer despite the color, very smooth with carbonation that's just present."
"This isn't a knock out beer but it is still very solid, and a good example of the style. While I have tried better märzen/Oktoberfest beers, this one still holds a special place."
"Drinkable: has a light consistency and not overly sweet or bitter. Could easily drink a few."
"Malts are quiet, it's true. I know that hops forward is not to style for an Oktoberfest but this is still a pleasant drinker when it's this fresh and belies it's 6% ABV (according to the label.)"
"very drinkable, could easily have a few of these in a sitting. fits the style well and pairs nicely with a cool fall evening. would certainly buy this again."
"If one is about superior taste go for the Hacker-Pschorr Oktoberfest-Märzen. Paulaner, although nearly as good, is just a little too light and lacks the malty chewyness and spice of better Märzen. Still a great drink and the best for parties."
"Overall, this has been the best oktoberfest of the season I've had so far and would reccomed it to someone to try it if you want a good fall beer to have"
"D- Not a beer you should pound. Its a darker thinker style fall beer. Beginner beer drinkers and or people who prefer lighter style beers probably wouldn't enjoy this too much."
"Based on my limited experience, this beer is on the lighter side for a Märzen, but it is still highly drinkable, enabling a nice buzz."
"Once again, Paulaner does it. This is a fine marzen...good amount of malt, toastiness, a little hoppiness and just tasty. I haven't had a bad beer yet from them."
"I don't know why but this has always been my favorite time of year. Maybe it's that the weather gets cooler. Maybe it's that all the good holidays (Halloween, Thanksgiving) are coming up. Or maybe it's all the Oktoberfest beers! This has been a favorite of mine for a few years now. Dark copper color in my Paulaner dimpled liter mug. Caramel, toffee, lots of malty goodness with little bitterness. Tastes different to me than years before. Can't seem to put my finger on it, hmm maybe it's just me. A superb O-fest IMO."
"I have to say I like this one, it is a light, spicy marzen, I can't help but enjoy the taste even if this style isn't in general one of my faves. It pours transparreant copper gold with thick white head quickly fading. It smells of spices, and tastes mush the same way with alot of wheat. It feels pretty smooth and is low on the carbanation. If you are in the mood for a marzen this one is drinkable."
"D - Easy drinking. Smooth flavors, well integrated. Somewhat sweet at times. Not filling. ABV manageable for sure."
"Pours a dark orange with many densely packed small carbonation trailers. A tall head soon becomes but lace. Smell seems more fruity than malty. Taste is sort of wine-like as well, raisin-like and alcoholic, but not too bad. Other than that, a decent Oktoberfest backbone, an ultra-smooth finish, and drinkability like no other style this time of year. A solid brew."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability - medium bodied with light carbonation and a subtly creamy feel. A very refreshing lager that could certainly be consumed in large quantities without much difficulty. An excellent benchmark for the style."
"D: A really nice Oktoberfest. Not my favorite, but still quite good. The lighter body and flavor make this extraordinarily drinkable. A 12 oz bottle is not enough. I could go through a stein very quickly."
"The mouthfeel is smooth and sweet. Overall a good transition-of-the-seasons selection. A good malty Oktoberfest offering. The alcohol is there somewhat on the finish, but not excessively so."
"Good malt to hop ratio"
"Drinkability- easy to drink in the aspect its just like a nice hopped lager with touch malt but in aspect of what id be looking to session as an octoberfest its bit of a let down, again not bad beer but just off on what i like in the style"
"Loved this one. Great drinkability. Not too sweet, nothing over the top. Balance, strength of flavor, pleasant and distinctive flavors, good body. A really good one."
"Very drinkable. Thin enough to enjoy a few of these back to back."
"M/D: medium carbonation, smooth and very easy to drink, wished they offered it in a liter mass krug"
"D: A really great example of the style and very drinkable."
"This is a very good beer."
"Overall a very good beer."
"overall: a very good beer but not my fav in this style so far this years winner goes to Spaten"
"Exceptionaly drinkable."
"I drank this beer without any previous research at a friend's house. It was very nice and malty with good brown toast flavor and just a hint of herbal bitterness. The finish was dry and clean, characteristic of a well made lager with a bit of warming alcohol. I enjoyed this and would recommend this to anyone wanting a medium-strength malty lager."
"Pours straw yellow with an inch of foamy white head. Clean aromas of bread grains and grassy hops. I'm not a huge fan of the Marzen style, but this is definitely a traditional example. Slightly maltier than a heller lager. Mildly sweet grainy malt with a grassy hop finish. Very simple. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. I could drink a few bottles of this on a hot day."
"Drinkability: tasty and certainly drinkable. I bet this is great when consumed in Munich, especially out-of-doors. Here, it's good, but mostly middle-of-the-road."
"Just the sheer balance and cleanliness of this lager is amazing. If we had to come up with a benchmark brand for every style, this would be our pick for O-fest beers."
"D- I don't get this beer. Funky, herbal and just not that good tasting."
"The body was the typical medium and smooth of the style. Drinkability is very nice, but is probably better closer to the source. Overall, a nice, classic version of the style."
"D - Easy drinking ... I like this one."
"Relatively drinkable. Not my cup of tea, however."
"From a bottle with the freshness date in the lower right corner marked 05/09-L13891s. Sampled post-season on March 15, 2010. It pours a fetching amber color with fine clarity but little head. Delicate carbonation bubbles flow upward for several minutes before the brew simmers down and stagnates. There is an alluring German malty character to this beer with barley, grains, and sugary sweetness in the mix. The mouthfeel is of decent medium texture. the flavor has a malty cleanliness about it and it is quite easy to drink this one. Thumbs up!"
"D: This style in general is a very drinkable style, this beer in particular is at the higher end. Very good display of munich malt, that is simple and classic. Nice complexity without throwing the palate around. Very good example of the style"
"Nice strong malt flavor, that is exactly what I am looking for in this style. Nice creamy head that fades quickly, but produces a wonderful crisp aroma. I could drink this all afternoon sitting on the porch watching the leaves change! Hooray for Fall!"
"-D- This was a great session beer. so nice and smooth. I know I'll be adding it into my fall rotation for sure this year."
"A nice amber color pour with a two finger short lasting foamy off white head . Medium carbonaiton , no apparent lacing left . Aroma is on the light side , toasty with slight grainy and caramel hints . Flavor is of taoasted malt grain giving way to a light caramel sweetness , slightly earthy ,some spicy hop flashes here and there , slight hop finish , light body , crisp clean mouthfeel , very sessionable and reasonably good"
"Mouthfeel- Medium body, low carbonation"
"Surprisingly hop forward for the style with a strong malt character that is again slightly roasty. It's also a bit nutty with hints of spicy cinnamon and brown sugar. This is nicely balanced by the slightly earthy hops that linger throughout. Pretty drinkable but kind of bland."
"Perhaps I am missing something here, but to me, like all Oktoberfests I have tried, this beer just seems like a stronger Helles Lager. A good beer, but not a great one for me."
"Two bottles pour a bright light brown beer into my giant Beer mug with room left to support a 4 inch light tan head. Weak head retention and minimal lacing. This beer smells of caramel, roasted nuts, hints of nutmeg and peppermint. Nice crisp beer, very nicely balanced beer, good malty sweetness with a nice bitter hop bite. Very crisp and drinkable, this is a very nice lager I will definitely have more of this for session drinking!"
"Poured into a glass mug it produces a small head that leaves ample lacing. The appearance is light amber and clear. The aroma is of spicy and floral hops. The taste is of sweet malt with moderate hop bitterness. The feel is medium bodied with a clean finish. This is a very enjoyable ale."
"Clear coppery amber with a fluffy cream colored head that lasts awhile and leaves splotchy lace behind on the glass. The nose is toasted grain and sassafras with mild wintergreen and floral hop notes. Mild tootsie roll sweetness with an herbal hop quality. Finished dry with mild metallic irony flavors. Medium bodied and creamy. A nice O-fest."
"Poured from a bottle with a copper color w/ a quick-dissipating, 1/2"" head. It has a sweet, malty toast smell w/ a real hops spice smell in the background. It has the same taste. It is well-balanced w/ a malty sweetness on the front end and the hops bitterness on the backend. Overall, this is a good solid marzen that I will look for again."
"Overall - Although this beer suffers from being transported thousands of kilometres, it is still one of the more enjoyable lagers available in Australia."
"A great representation of the style. Easy to drink, plenty of flavor, but not overwhelming. Great availability make this an outstanding fall choice."
"D- I really just did not enjoy this beer. I don't typically drink a lot of Marzens and Octoberfest lagers, but I have had a few that I like...this is not one of them."
"D- I could drink this all night and wouldn't complain. It would make for a boring beer night however."
"Drinkability: A very tasty brew indeed, in fact it is one of the better Oktoberfests I've had. The sweet taste is very pronounced, and the presentation is unbelievable."
"Drinkability is good to me, like most octoberfest offerrings. It really is my favorite style of beer when the weather gets cool. A nice crisp night and a great octoberfest. this one definitely applies. The style in general is drinkable so I rate it very drinkable with not too much dryness or sweetness."
"Prost!"
"Pours a crystal clear amber with a quickly disappearing head. The big malty nose is exceptionally clean if only a tad too sweet. A slightly acidic touch complements the bounding nutty taste, and I find myself thinking of the great SS Nut Brown. There's a very pleasant flavor to this one, better than your average Oktoberfest. I would call this comfort beer, and I can imagine myself draining mugs of it all day in Munich."
"D: Light in body with an interesting and pleasant flavor. Definitely a highly drinkable and enjoyable marzen."
"D: This is a very drinkable, and surprisingly light on the gut beer. I could see this being a regular session staple through the winter."
"D: Very easy to drink!!, in my very personal review, it might be the german version of ""corona extra""."
"I poured this yummy beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was an nice Oktoberfest amber color as it should be. The beer however did not have a very good head and it quickly dissipated. The taste of this beer was a nice caramel tasted slightly taste that I just really like. This is one beer I will continue to buy."
"Drinkability? All day long if I could get it this fresh."
"Very drinkable and among the top three of German Oktoberfest beers that I try to have every year. Highly recomended if you like rich toasted malt flavors and subtle spicy hops."
"This is my favorite oktoberfest this season. I had this about ten years ago, and I wish I had tried it again sooner"
"As with most beer from Paulaner, this one is solidly okay. It's got a decent puffy head that releases a nice cloud of fruit and grain, but the taste is just a bit too sweet for my liking. I tend to prefer Oktoberfests that are drier and have more body. The alcohol is nicely subdued, which makes it rather drinkable. But for this style there are many better beers. If you want German, try Hacker-Pschorr; if you want American, try Victory."
"Drinkability - Pretty good, the beer is not as heavy as I would think and the fruit flavors crisp up the beer to make it surprisingly refreshing"
"D - A very solid, authentic, drinkable marzen. Not meant to be the most complex beer, but rather this is the one you can drink loads of, without it becoming a hassle to drink."
"Notes: This is a very tasty and extremely drinkable Oktoberfest. The only thing I could ask for would be a little more head retention. This is one of the better Oktoberfest beers that I have had. Very well done!!!"
"Drinkability: A sub-par offering for Oktoberfest, I like my Marzen beers more malt based and minus the residual hop to malt battle that can sometimes destroy a good Marzen. This beer is way too bitter on the tongue yet the smooth caramel and toffee flavors makes up for this. Not bad but not great either."
"Next autumn, I'll have to try other imports or just stick to American octoberfests that I know are more fresh."
"deep amber body, finger and a half semi rocky head, fairly quick dissipation. Malts dominate the nose, nice balance of breadiness and sweetness, very little hop smell. Big sweet malt domination of the tastebuds, a bit of hop bitterness on the backend. Smooth mouthfeel with minimal carbonation. Pretty drinkable. Certainly one of the benchmarks for the style. Actually, I prefer the draft version, but it is October, and living in the beer wasteland known as The Big, you got to do what you got to do."
"D: A decent beer."
"Drinkability is very enjoyable as a preffered Ofest brew if available."
"3-3.5 my first time with paulaner o'fest, but i would be willing to bet it was better and fuller once upon a time. is this only a problem with the american export version?"
"D - A good beer - I could have a couple - but it might be a bit heavier than I usually want in a Marzen."
"MF&D - a light body that is coupled with ample carbonation to make a pseudo-medium. the main problem with the drinkablility is that the taste is off from the style. the brew is still good in its own right, but not something I would actively seek out."
"Drinkability of this from a Masskrug is hard to match"
"Appearance was decent at first but once it fizzled it was gone. Looked like a flat beer. Very malty with little or no hop character which is common in this style but something is wrong here. Very average Oktoberfest beer, maybe this was on the shelf too long. Caramel, toffee and maple syrup to go with the nutty backbone. Flavors are there but it's watery, syrupy and needs bigger carbonation to match the heavy feel."
"D: A great take on the Marzen style...great time of year..this brew doesn't last long around me..."
"Out of a 12 ounce bottle and into my dimpled mug. Appears a hazed muted amber color with about two fingers of creamy off white foam. The foam lingers for a bit before settling to a thin ring. Flavors and aromas consist of fruits such as green apples and pears, nice amount of caramelized malt, toasted buttered brown bread, earthy and sweet. Falls somewhere between medium and full bodied with ample carbonation and a smooth clean finish."
"An absolute fantastic representation of the style and blows away any American offering I have had. This is one of the pioneers that has been around for hundreds of years. Worth the price tag and blows the competition away. So glad I finally got my hands on some! This has inspired me to seek out other German Märzen offerings, because so far from what I have tried the micros from America don't even compare."
"Overall a great Oktoberfest, one of the stalwarts in the category."
"It is very drinkable. I can't recall any marzen that I have liked better. I would definitely recommend this one."
"d- drinkability on this big guy is great, it's one of the best oktoberfests i've had, and i will definately be having some more very soon!"
"and very drinkable"
"This brew is drinkable; very much so. This is one of the best takes on this style that I have tried. Paulaner is a stud brewery."
"On draft at RFD served in a pint glass. No head, at all, ver low carbonation, but I have a theory that RFD is running low on CO2, all the beer there lately have had no heads. Beer is completely clear, and orange in color. High malt in flavor, full body. Weak aroma, practically nothing, definetly nothing specific to pick out. Kind of smells like generic beer. There are no hops in the aroma or in the flavor, shouldn't expect any so that's OK. Drinkability is fine, just not a very special beer."
"If I was only at Oktoberfest...."
"Superb in its complexity, this is most definitely one of the better examples of the style in its homeland of Munich. Its smoothness and rich mouthfeel only serve to enrich its depth of flavor. Highly recommended."
"D: A good clean sweet taste that you can have more than once. Definitely something you should try a second time to taste the evolution."
"D: Not bad, not great."
"Medium caramel/amber color.. poured into a pint glass translucent with nearly no head. The smell is sweet caramels and sugars. Taste is very light with only a slight caramel flavor and twinge of unpleasant alcohol aftertastes. Highly carbonated and fairly drinkable, but the flavors aren't really that pleasant and I've had several oktoberfests I've found a lot more enjoyable."
"Very smooth almost oily mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. This beer is very sessionable. Very good representation of the style."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. It pours a light copper with a 2 finger white head. The aroma is bready and sweet. The flavor is sweet, bready and a bit spicy. The spiciness lingers a bit. The body is medium and average carbonation. A very good fest beer that goes down very smooth."
"Drinkability - This is my second time having this. The first time I was not impressed (not sure why). This time around it is much better. The combination of a lighter bodied brew with decent carbonation and a good, clean sweet taste makes this a marzen I could have a few of at once. Quite drinkable. Need to do a side by side of this and SA Octoberfest (I am so partial to the SA...so it would be interesting)"
"Taste is pleasantly creamy caramel with a touch of toasty malts. Some hops are there for a bit of balance, especially on the finish. They're there more for bitterness than flavor. Drinkability is pretty ridiculous on this beer as a six-pack could disappear pretty quick if you're not careful. A superb session beer, and one of the best O-fests I have had."
"poured into pint glass an attractive golden amber with very little head. no retention or lacing to speak of. smells pretty clean, mainly of malts. taste is lightly roasted carmel malts balanced with some grassy hop bitterness up front. creamy malty-ness in the middle. has a nice crispness on the finish accompanied by slight bitterness of yeast/hop that cleans up quickly. medium bodied with light carbonation...mouthfeel is good and creamy. a refreshing brew and highly drinkable."
"Very easy to drink and highly enjoyable. This really does seem to bring a lot of the good things of this style to the table."
"Overall a pleasant experience, but not something to crave."
"Pours a nice copper gold. Nice aroma of malts, bread and nuts. What a great Oktoberfest. Great caramel malty flavor. Yet this still has a nice crisp bite. Its not too heavy and over malty as some oktobers can be. Hits the mouth with a nice warm malt feel and then a little bite at the end. Great!. Very drinkible for this style. It will now be one of mt favorites for this style."
"Long live autumn beers."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a decent beer but there are several other O-Fest beers that would choose first."
"im trying alot of marzens now its that time of the year this one pours a very nice amber color with a nice head i smell noble hops and nice caramel malts..the taste is some crisp noble hops and some caramel malts that blend very nicely i like this marzen its one of the better of the many that are out there this one is crisp sweet and smooth"
"Drinkability is marvelous, the perfect beer for a fall day, I could drink this non stop until Buddhism adopts a new discipline called Mar Zen."
"super smooth sweetness on the front finishing with that distinctive, crisp, grassy note of noble hops. straightfoward, but never boring - this guy boasts some great malt profiles- with bready -toasty malts and just general goodness. like any good oktoberfest marzen, i could drink ALOT of this all at the same time. like i'm gettin ready to do..."
"In all, a great representation of the style."
"D: This is a nice Märzen beer. I will buy it again! Very refreshing."
"Drinkability: This is my prototypical Marzen, but I used to enjoy it more than I do now. Sometimes having an expanding palate sucks as it destroys old favorites. Even if no longer a favorite of mine, it is still very good nonetheless. Prost!"
"D - This beer is the essence of the Oktoberfest style. A great beer, and perfect for the fall season."
"This is one of my favorite beer styles. I wait all year for the fall and winter beers to come out. (Even though some are available all year.) Welcome!"
"This is very drinkable."
"D: This is a decent Octoberfest that does down smooth and is very sessionable. It's not my favorite interpreation of the style, but still enjoyable."
"A dark amber brew with a finger of white head. Oh, so pretty. The aroma is nice and sweet with caramel malts. The flavor has more prominent caramel and possible a hint of citrus, although it had a bit of a sting in the aftertaste, but not enough to put me off on this beer. It's number three or two for my Marzen picks."
"drinkability- did not enjoy this beer, perhaps it was the specific bottle, but i felt it was very lacking in flavor and aroma, and almost felt like tea."
"The taste is very bready, slightly sweet, with hints of hops and that sharpness at the end. Very light-bodied, I could easily have a dozen of these. It is not surprising that this is a better-known festbeir. It is remarkably quaffable and subtle."
"Drinkability - Easily downed. I would have another."
"D: I would buy this beer again. It was pretty easy to drink and tasted very good. The beer was very mild in taste."
"great had about 6 at octoberfest last year and felt great"
"what a shame that this is now mostly an export-only style for the germans."
"Poured a bright amber color into a pint glass. Nice looking brew. Smelled biscuity and malty. Quite a nice aroma. The taste was sweet and malty with a medium/light flavor. Mouthfeel was also right down the middle, not too heavy, not too light. I felt like a german woman with a bustier should be serving this to me. Drinkability was easy. I'd be able to drink a few of these no problem."
"This seems to be one of the quintessential Oktoberfest beers, and with good reason. It has a sweet malt profile that finishes clean and is very easy to drink. This bottle was pretty old (produced on 06/08!), so I may be inclined to take another stab at this one with a fresher bottle. Not too bad for how old it is though!"
"I can see why this is supposedly the number one Oktoberfest beer in the world. Very enjoyable and easy to drink."
"Poured a copper/ amber color with a small white head. It smelled slightly fruity with a hint of a metallic smell. The taste was surprising, with an initial maltiness followed by a strong peachy, plum-like taste. One of the more unique beers that I've had for this style. Very smooth and refreshing. It's a good one but I'll put my efforts to trying other beers before having this one again."
"Pours a golden brown colored body, with a yellow/white head. Somewhat lasting. Small bubbles. Very malty aroma. Weakish aroma. Chemically watery refreshing taste, clean aftertaste. Malty taste. Not too strong a flavor. Not my style."
"A lovely Christmas gift it was, a mini-keg of Oktoberfest. Perhaps a bit off-season, but enjoyable nonetheless! A dark honey with sun-yellow light pour to a light beige 2-finger head with small golden bubbles. The fluffy head shrinks down soon leaving nice lace throughout. The aroma is of a sweet malt with citrus-lemon hop. The flavor is a nutty malt with hints of cashew and lemon edging. A good, basic, drinkable beer without much complexity."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style German Oktoberfest."
"On-tap at a responsible beer bar that takes care of its lines. Very important for European lagers. Bottled versions of this style are easily corrupted."
"Has a pretty good relaxing flavor and is quite easy to drink. Not a bad beer."
"Not my taste in beers, but either way this is a good beer."
"Good. Atosphere is pretty decent. Good hearty flavor, but light in feel. Great drinkability. Really good quaff."
"Bottle pour into Stella glass. Pours a medium dark amber with white head that diminished relatively quick. Sweet aroma with grainy and caramel notes. Smooth, flavorful. Nice beer, enjoyed each sip. Just a bit overpriced, but it is an import for me. OE"
"Overall a pretty decent beer. Better than most pumpkin flavored beer's I have had."
"Nothing special, especially considering the metallic taste. I had this back in Nov. so it should have been in date, something was off though."
"Drinkability is very good and I'm glad I took a chance on the 12 pack and it was only a buck a bottle."
"D - very good beer, the none seasonal aspect hurts in my opinion, but still good"

"This beer was a very strong malty beer, easily the best Oktoberfest I have had to date."
"M/D - not a bad beer at all, easily consumed, just nothing too special about it."
"Drinkability. Alright. Not spectacular. More of a staple beer than something fantastic. Not worth seeking out."
"Easy to throw back but not a session beer...if that makes sense."
"Drinkablity: This is another good Oktoberfest. It seemed to depart from what I am used to in the style because of the dryness an a pronounced, yet subtle, hop presence."
"D: Good."
"Poured this copperish red beer into a pint glass. The foam that appeared with it presented itself nicely and then decipated to a lingerance. The aroma off the beer is one you expect with a seasonal beer like this. While the taste was of the seasonal expectation it also went back to the english stylization that paulaners are known for."
"I enjoyed this beer on tap during a week in Telluride. Great amber color, small head. Toasty malt aroma with some nuts and pepper hops. Malty monster, with a crisp finish. Never had a sour one, but also never tried it out of a bottle. I'll get this again when I go back."
"Pours marzen amber, smells very malty. Weak, watery palate. Some malty caramel taste but overly very weak. Disappointing. There are some far better oktoberfest/marzens out there to taste. This unfortunately falls short -- I'd recommend Hacker-Pschorr over this Paulaner brew."
"Overall: This is also another good Oktoberfest. The finish is nice, making you quench for more."
"A decent marzen but nothing too special."
"This was decent, with some good flavors but I like the hop profiles in my O-Fests to take a back seat and compliment the primary flavors instead of the other way around. Still, I liked the sharpness in the body and the drinkibility was good. There are just probably a couple of imports that I would go to first before this though."
"D/O: One of the better German Festbiers I've had this year, both on draft and in the bottle. I think the bready sweetness would border on cloying if I tried to drink this all day under a tent, but I'd raise a few litres of this every Fall to celebrate the season."
"m&d: excellent mouthfeel, just a simple beer that delivers."
"Aroma is caramel malt, and a bit stale. This beer tastes old and a bit skunked, but beyond that stale flavor I don't find much of interest. Would like to try one that is confirmed fresh. If it is nota vast improvement I will continue to avoid this brew."
"A little watery, but smooth nonetheless. A pretty good marzen, but I've had better."
"Bottle. Smooth amber beer with a good finish. Decent, but I'd love to get a fresher try with it on tap. Light spices and biscuit flavors. Some light fruit, and a medium mouthfeel. Easygoing and well-crafted. A typical marzen; light spices and full flavored."
"Ive really taking a liking to Marzen style beers and this one is no exception. Poured into a pint glass with a wonderful clear medium amber color. it had a hefty 2 in head with good lacing. Semi-sweet aroma of baked bread. A nice crisp clean tasting beer but still very flavorful. A strong malt taste with only a hint of hop to give the beer balance. I could drink this almost anytime."
"I bought a sixer of this at the Davis Co-op when it arrived in town. Pours a nice clear brown with short, fleeting head that recedes to just a white ring around the top. Green apple and mild sweet malt odor. Some corn-like odor, reminds be oddly of MGD, which is weird. Taste is a mild, slightly sweet maltiness. Spicy hops mingle with the sweetness and create a mild apple-like flavor that lingers a long time. Alcohol becomes obvious, but complements the flavor. Medium bodied. Drinks well, and appropriate for the season."
"From a 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass, appearance is an amber copper color with a thin white head that dissipated very quickly. Smells faintly of sweet hops and a touch of caramel. Taste is slightly sweet with a slight bit of grain and subtle hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth with very light carbonation. This is a decent brew, I could easily drink a few of these, but would much rather have something else."
"Drinkability is moderate to high. Certainly sessionable, but not incredibly interesting."
"The beer is great, but I was expecting a classic Oktoberfest taste profile. A good Okotberfest should feature a big malt foundation, but it should also be tempered by a decent dose of noble hobs to balance things out. As stated earlier, this would be a great Bock."
"It's a good drinkable Marzen. I think there is room for improvement. Yet there are some very nice qualities that need to be kept. I could sit back and drink a few of these in a sitting."
"When I think Oktoberfest, I think Paulaner. A true classic."
"I could have two or so and then I would go looking for something else."
"The taste is similar, plummy and bready, with caramel, stewed dried fruit, unpasteurised apple juice, a light leafy-piney bitterness that just dominates the finish, which has elements of leaves, pine, fruit, bread, and grain. It's very smooth, a bit lively if somewhatflat in feel, and very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Pretty light mouthfeel. Definitely feels more like a lager than some of the American beers in this style. Finishes slightly sticky. Overall, not a bad beer at all."
"I could easily drink a few of these in one sitting. No problem."
"D - I really do not like marzen style beers. THits all BJCP guidelines, and if I judged, would probably be a contestant for best in show.."
"Drinkability is good, this is damn tasty. As much as I love the full taste, several liters of this may be a challenge. But that's not how I drink beer, and for my pick this is a good one. Really much better in this bottle size for whatever reason. It tastes particularly fresh and full of life after the flacid Baron Oktoberfest I just had...in fact, I had to go back and dial down some of those scores in contrast!"
"D - Very easy drinkin'... Light and smooth... Simple, in a very good way... I could and will, enjoy a few of these..."
"Well done!"
"This one pours a pretty golden dark amber, not too much head. Aroma is malty and slightly spicy, not strong but promising. Flavor is crisp and malty and has a nice nutty undertone. Texture is fairly smooth and somewhat tingly. Not a great beer, but definitely worth a try."
"This beer defines fall to me. From the bottle, to the presentation in the glass, to the taste. Solid."
"this is a great oktoberfest. it is a nice coppery color. a light head. the aroma is nice roasty malt. The flavor is a great cereally malty flavor with a hint of a bitter hop. the mouthfeel is medium with a great drinkability factor. i could sit and put down a case. i love oktoberfests!!!"
"Overall this was enjoyable. Would recommend."
"I find this a bit more interesting than many of the sweet sticky Octoberfest beers that are out today."
"Pretty drinkable, a solid O-fest."
"D - OK, but not great. I have had a lot of Oktoberfest beers I would rather have."
"D: An excellent combination of mouthfeel and taste made this beer and excellent drinking beer. Definitely a very nice example of an Oktoberfest."
"4.5 D: Of all the Oktoberfest's I've had, this and Penn Brewery's are my favorites. This is very good and drinkable."
"D: I could drink this all day long, a very pleasent and easy to drink beer."
"Pours a crystal clear copper orange with medium white head, falling somewhat quickly. Fairly low carbonation. Good clean smell of lightly sweet caramel and a hint of nuttiness. Light toasted malt and some grain. Taste is basically the same. Not overly sweet and pretty solid. A refreshing touch of hops leave a lightly crisp finish. Just a tad watered down, a little thin to me. Still, it's pretty smooth. Overall, it's a good drinkable brew. I could have a few of these with no problem."
"Drinkability: Very high on this category. Crisp, great taste and goes down great. Probably the best of the style so far."
" Yes, very drinkable, even sessionable."
"Ah, I love the original Oktoberfests. I wish I'd had this earlier in the season because these put everything in perspective. The aroma and flavor are a smooth caramel flavor that finish with light roasted flavors and a hint of hops. The flavor is fairly clean and there's nothing remotely off. Basically it's tasty and very drinkable. I'd drink a stein-full anytime."
"The taste is quite crisp, but not overly so, there is lots of caramel malts, some spices and herbal hop bite, but not overly so, there is more carbonation in this Marzen than you will find in most others. The beer is definitely tilted towards the crisp rather than the creamy end of the continuum, but there is a tad bit of creaminess on the tongue, for it isn't entirely crispy either. There is a slightly husky graininess, there is a herbal, tea like hop character, and the finish is a bit biting, but much milder than some other Octoberfests you will find. The key principle in this beer is balance. The parts are well balanced and more so than most other Marzens you will find, and that makes this one a cut above the pack. L'Chaim."
"A dark, copper body with hints of ruby and auburn; great tan head and good retention with minor lacings. A light malt smell with just a hint of any spices or hops. A smooth, almost creamy medium-bodied beer that has a not overpowering sweet malt taste of caramel and mixes it with some spices in the background. Passes over pleasantly and has a little kick on the backend. Hops lead to a floral, semi-earthy taste but do not overpower the beer, only give it a dry backbite. A great Oktoberfest to be had at any time."
"Good flavor, light body, and low ABV makes this go down quickly and often."
"D: Really enjoyed this, sweet and easy to drink and extremely smooth going down. Warm, sweet, and toasty, perfect for the chilly fall evening."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Color perfect Marzen style copper with a head the quickly dissipates to rim lacing. The nose is nice on this beer, malts, clove, and gentle spiciness. The taste sweet malt followed by interesting cloves spiciness, and a black tea finish. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, slightly viscous. A good offering and would be a quick drinkable festival beer."
"It is a beer that I'd be happy to drink in a 1 litre mug any day!"
"The best of the German Octoberfests that I tried. This is also the only one I would probably even buy again (compared to Hacker-Pschorr and Hofbrau). Definitely has a nice European taste to it and some of the falls pices can be detected. I thought it could improve a lot in the body as it was way too thin for my liking. I still like the American versions better but this was a solid o-fest."
"D - Paulaner has been my favorite Oktoberfest to date. This was very easy to take down and allows for easy drinking with its 5.8% abv. Definitely recommended."
"Pours clear medium to dark amber with thin off-white head that quickly thins to barely a film. Malty aroma that is pleasantly musty with maybe a little spice. Good sweet to bready malty IF with a relatively long lived caramel and malt aftertaste that is nicely balanced with a light hop bitterness. Medium to fulll bodied with crisp carbonated finish. Overall a good beer, of which I tend to buy at least one six pack each October (or late September)."
"Overall: Simply stated, it's phenomenal. One of my favorite Oktoberfest brews. Highly recommended to all."
"D- absolutely! smooth and refreshing, marzen are growing on me."
"D: Not bad, I have enjoyed this one for the past couple of years."
"Notes: I am finding that I am not a big fan of any Oktoberfest/Marzen but this is as good as any that I have sampled. I will not seek this beer out but it is a good example of the style."
"D: This is very very drinkable and I'm liking this significantly. Easily quaffable"
"A solid Oktoberfest beer. You won't be wowed but still enjoyable"
"Good, crisp carbonation keeps this complex lager light on the mouth. Nice taste, fairly easy drinking."
"Poured from brown bottle to a cold mug an orange/amber color with a minimal cream colored head. Smell left me wanting. Was very weak, I expected alot more here but what it has is melow roasted malt aroma. Tasted watery for the style, with sweet roast malts and some hop flavor, but rather bland for an Oktoberfest in my opinion. Drinks smooth and would be good for a session and is a fine beer but is not what I had hoped."
"On the light side of medium-bodied with great carbonation and feel, Paulaner's Oktoberfest is exceptionally drinkable, if lacking the malt-load to crack the top echelon of the style."
"Definitely one of the best Octoberfests out there. I really enjoyed the Spaten version, this one is really close or better. Might be picking up a mini-keg of this soon."
"D: Extremely high. This is one helluva good beer, and one that I would enjoy for lengthyy periods of time. A very good Oktoberfest offering."
"MF&D - A very good example of Oktoberfest Beer. Boy do I love the fall!"
"D - This is a very drinkable beer. I'm going to pour another one now."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkabilty: Overall too light and too much carbonation in my opinion. Feels too much like water and along with the overall weak flavor-when compared to others-it just seems a bit weak. Nice aftertaste here, but as far as the whole experience and the body (flavor included) this beer seems to me to be lacking. I'm just not a fan. Great to try, and a good offering but in my opinion it is lacking it leaves something to be desired. Glad to try it, but I'll be picking up many of the other O-fests (and those are the ones I've already tried, not to mention the drive to pick up O-fests I""ve not tried) before I pick this one up again."
"D: Excellent. The second one tastes better than the first, and the third even better. Great ABV. Wonderful sessionable beer for a crisp fall day."
"D: Very drinkable beer."
"A decent festbier that I find a bit too carbonated(initially) and a bit too cloaking in style, but is nonetheless a nice Oktoberfest Brew!"
"This is an old standard. Nothing outstanding, mind-blowing,revolutionary, or ""extreme double whatever"" here. Just enjoy for what it is-a damn fine bier!. Prost!"
"Very drinkable. A nice mild unoffensive Oktoberfest, especially for an Ameican consumer. My guess is Germans and real Oktoberfest fans don't like this stuff, but I think it's fine."
"D: I could drink this one all night. The more you drink, the better it tastes."
"D - Very sweet and goes down very easily."
"D: Very drinkable, like most Oktoberfests."
"Good body and carbonation. Ever so drinkable. This is just so clean, and delicious. This seems to be near the top for me."
"M&D--I love both. Not too many bubbles to get in the way of that mulled cider warming feel. Just awesome for the onset of Autumn. Seems almost a crime not to have some mustard and sausage to accompany it."
"I really enjoyed this. I am not a huge fan of the style, but this one is well-made for sure."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Crisp and smooth, very malty. Grainy sweetness, toasted bread and nuts, a bit of dark fruit. Faintly mineral/metallic. Great mouthfeel; medium-light in body and carbonation, not so heavy or fizzy that it's difficult to drink a liter. The finish is moderately drying and only faintly hoppy. This is pretty straight-forward stuff, but very enjoyable for what it is."
"overall it is a pretty good oktoberfest and of course an original."
"D - Highly sessionable as are most of the style, but there was something about the toasted/roasted quality and the slight metallic flavor that dropped this half a point."
"D: I enjoyed aspects of it, but not my favorite of the big six."
" ~ This is a good beer. No doubt about it."
"D - Solid brew. More substantial than refreshing, and malty rather than hoppy."
"D: One of my favorite Oktoberfests from my early days of good beer appreciation. Great session beer that I'm glad I returned to."
"A bit dryer than expected, with a tasty but not overly strong malt body and medium hop balance. Carbonation is about right for the style. Easy to drink with a smooth finish and clean aftertaste. Maybe a little yeasty but this is avery solid German marzen."
"Mouthfeel is rich enough for this style and drinkability is good. A few pitchers of this with friends would be nice."
"Pours a nice copper color with moderate carbonation. A nice malty tone with elements of biscuit and bread like flavor. This beer is extremely smooth. Mouth feel is spicy with a touch of hops at the finish. This is a solid Oktoberfest that provides an excellent example of the German brewing tradition."
"Beautiful dark amber color with a creamy off-white head. Aromas of caramel, toffee and nuts. Soft medium bodied mouth feel delivers more mellow toffee and nuts flavor with a kind of crystal malty sweetness just barely balanced by soft hopping in the back ground. Smooth off-dry finish calls for more until this morning I have a headache."
"A beer worth sharing with friends. Another plus for this beer is that it comes in a mini/baby keg."
"Side-by-side with the Sam Adams Oktoberfest and this beer made it no contest, and I really like the Sam Adams version. I mean, it just absolutely blew it away in mouthfeel, smell, flavor, malt, everything. It was a suprise to say the least, so I'll be doing it with the Spaten offering too. Hey, what can I say! It's that time of the year!"
"Pours a really nice dark copper with slight head, low retention, with medium lacing. I definitely enjoy the color on this one for being as all-out Oktoberfesty as I want. Great aroma as well. Grainy, sort of a ""dough in"" smell with sweetness. Light but super malty, not too strong in any particular malt, smells of fall and freshly raked leaves. I think I get a little alcohol in the taste (5.8%.. oh). Noticeable hop bitterness and flavor blends well with the malt. A little floral/rosy as it warms up. Having had this I want to go back and try out the Hacker-Pschorr once more to really try to nail what IMO the best Oktoberfest is. The alcohol and hops make it a little less drinkable than other ones I've had but I enjoy it a lot."
"all 4's"
"D: An excellent raking leaves weather beer."
"This was definately worth a try"
"Slightly bitter aftertaste."
"This is a pretty solid example of a German Oktoberfest beer."
"The body is light overall. A crisp finish, but lacks the depth for an O-fest. Carbonation is light but good. Overall this to me is not a very good example of an Oktoberfest. Where is the Vienna and Munich? Some off brewing notes, skunk, minerally, yeasty notes."
"Pours a very nice looking clear deep amber with a nice fluffy white head. Aroma is very malty and rich with some light straw. Taste follows with very good lagery grain and nice rich malty flavor with going overboard. A very smooth drink with a slight bit of caramel hints. Mouthfeel is just a bit on the thick side. Drinkability is very good here, especially considering the rich maltiness in the flavor. Overall a very nice oktoberfest brew, and one I will be sure to revisit. Quite tastey, and very drinkable. Perfect for the season."
"D: Again I will say it. The key for these beers is to get them fresh. This is a nice fresh bottle and it is enjoyable. In a month or two they will loose quite a bit. Check the bottle dates."
"D: Very easy to drink with no characteristics that would fatigue the palate."
"This is a pretty good Oktoberfest. It really gets me into the mood for the season. Something I would recommend."
"D- A very good, very drinkable beer."
"D- A good beer and easy to drink."
"D: An enjoyable Oktoberfest beer for the season. I like the Weihenstephaner Festbier version a little better for its sharpness, but this stands up pretty well for the style."
"D: Finish and rich taste makes it a really nice beer to keep drinking without ABV putting on the hurt."
"Drinkability: Honestly I could drink this all day, very smooth and VERY drinkable, I'll definitely be picking up another sixer sometime soon."
"I like German beers (especially Paulaner's Salvator), but this was not something I would go after all too often, even during the autumn season. I was hoping to love this beer, but instead, I found it a little above average."
"Tastes rich and malty with a creamy presence and smooth finish. fairly crisp in the mouth with a light carbonation. for an Oktoberfest this one is a classic and remains so."
"Date on the bottle says 04/08 but, whether this is a best buy date or a bottled date I don't know. The guy selling it said they just got a shipment in so I hope it is a bottled on date. This beer pours a deep caramel brown with a slight off white head that left no lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is toffee, raisins and a bit or roasted malts. The taste is much the same with caramel really dominating the flavor profile for me. The mouthfeel is a bit thin for me, also a tad astringent at the tail. While no the best O'Fest (I'm thinking about you Ayinger O'Fest) I've had, its still a great beer to imbibe on a nice cool evening."
"D - I think its still to hot out to be enjoying Octoberfest quite yet but I'm a little disappointed with this one after liking the other beers from Paulaner"
"A solid Marzen. Mouthfeel was decent, if a bit thin."
"This was a pure treat and something to delve more into in the future. Prime example of great German beer and the Oktoberfest Marzen style."
"D - No complaints."
"M + D: Assertive carbonation, crisp, with a fairly nice finish-lingering flavour. Could be a touch lighter to be a fantastic session brew, but worth the try and a potential staple of the season."
"Clear golden/ orange color with thin tan head. Smellled malty and slightly citrusy. Smokey aroma in mouth then moves to spices and caramel flavor. Very smooth and easy to drink. The malt flavor caught up with me at the end and started to overpower but I still enjoyed the beer a lot. I'll look for it once more during the Oktoberfest season. Try it.."
"Recommended..."
"The thin head goes fast to leave a thin ring of foam. Has a clear, dark, amber-brown body. Aroma is of average strength, but nice and very malty. Taste is good but unexciting, but I might be drinking it too cold. Mildly sweet and malty, with a bite of hoppy bitterness in the finish. Also some tiny bit of spice and toast. Also a bit light on the carbonation, but otherwise solid mouthfeel. Overall it's drinkable, and enjoyable, and good, but nothing special."
"D-This is one of my favorite oktoberfest brews and ill have more and more as the time nears."
"This is a lighter Oktoberfest that is more thirst quenching and refreshing than others."
"D-Nice beer with decent flavor, could see having several of these as starter beers."
"this is a beer i can enjoy on any day any time."
"d: Excellent example of what an Oktoberfest/Marzen should be. Great beer. Its not my favorite style, but this is one of the best representations I have had. Great session beer too."
"A good staple in beer drinking."
"Recommended!"
"The aroma was bready malts and lemon. I tasted the grain like malt and hints of caramel. It was very crisp and clean for a malt dominated brew. Overall it was a excellent Octoberfest."
"D: The slightly bitter and dry aftertaste makes you want to come back quickly for another sip. The low carbonation assists in making it easy to drink. It goes down much more smoothly than most Oktoberfests I have had."
"M/D: Dry and light. Crisp finish. Easy to drink."
"Drinkability - easy drinking, sessionable"
"D - Would be great anyday."
"Truly one of the classic Oktoberfests."
"This beer is absurdly easy to drink. It's smooth and tasty, light but flavorful."
"Drinkability is good but after a few I would want to switch to something else. Not too bad of an Oktoberfest."
"Drinkability is good. This is a very nice Marzen. I'll have to look for this one this fall. But this bottle from 07 has held up well."
"Pours amber with a nice clarity with a healthy head that fades to a ring. Smell is very malty with a hint of lager yeast tang. Lots of caramel aromas. Taste is similar- very malty, but not overly sweet. There is a fresh graininess that keeps everything in balance. Smooth and slightly grainy mouthfeel. This is pretty drinkable and pretty tasty, but its a bit utilitarian."
"Especially @ 19.99 - a great find!"
"Drinkability- It is a great beer that it wonderful to drink."
"Pours a reddish-orange color with a thin white head that drops quickly leaving a thin ring. Light, pleasant malt aroma. Taste is malty with a faint nuttiness. There's a very light bitterness at the end. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with moderate carbonation. Classic example of the style."
"One and one-half fingers of off-white froth top an orange-brown body, impressive on the whole. The nose emits plenty of malt and fruit. I like the taste--an admixture of toffee, mild spice, and fruit, primarily grapes and apples. Smooth with a modest bite of bitterness, this is easy to enjoy and return to. Delicious."
"There is a good malty flavor under the oxidation, but The hop character might be a tad too much for the style."
"Here it is February and I'm still getting to some Oktoberfests, but it's always a good time for one of my favorite goto styles when I'm feeling a bit undecided. Pours a pale amber into a pint glass. The slight head fades quickly off an aggressive pour. If you blink you'll miss it. Smells of caramel, malts and faint esters. There's not a lot going on in the taste department, but it works just fine in this beer. Not everything has to be complex. It has a certain openness to it that is surrounded by a thin veil of hops. Very drinkable and satisfying. I see myself in Germany drinking a few of these while enjoying the company of a beautiful blond fraulein."
"D-I'm not blown away, but it's a nice classic brew that's a decent value. It is refreshing, and I expect it would pair with great versatility."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. pours a deep amber with medium head. Smell is light malty, nothing stands out, but it's still pleasant. Medium bitterness, slightly sweet, feel is smooth, but nothing really stands out. Not too bad, but nothing I'd go out of the way for."
"A really tasty and well done example of the style, not too big in alcohol, feel or caramel flavors."
"Medium body with a rich German malt flavor. There is a little bit of noble hop bitterness. Nice Oktoberfest. Very drinkable, a great beer with spicy food."
"This one was fairly clear and a deep amber colour, topped by a beige cap. The head retention was decent and it showed some good stickage with clumpy lacing clinging to the glass. The aroma was very malty - sweet caramel and grain dominating. Low bitterness, sweet and malty flavour with a very mild hop presence. There was a bit of caramel and toasted malt too. Medium bodied with carbonation just on the low side and a decent texture overall. Maybe just a little slick on the palate. Pretty decent and very malty, it just seemed like it lacked a bit of something to hold it all together."
"Drinkability: One of my 2 favorite styles of beer. I have to give this on high marks. A staple for my beer fridge mainly due to my love of Marzens and its availability at my local beer store."
"This is actually my first oktoberfest beer; I bought it from a Netherlands seller. This beer pours out with a more than 3 finger thick head that quickly reduces to a one finger creamy head with nice clinging action and finally to a thin layer of foam covering the golden see-through liquid below. Nice bubbling action in the tall slender Erdinger glass enhances the appearance of this beer. Smell was not really strong but I am picking up malts and light hints of fresh fruits and citrus. The taste starts off with slight sour note on the palates with a pleasing malt profile, subtle fruitiness and citrus also show up soon after. The taste was slightly bland though refreshing, like the Kristallweizens though I prefer this one slightly to the Kristals but of course not as much as the Hefeweizens of course. The finish was a little dry with a nice malty after taste where the wheat becomes more pronounced before a typically grapy, citrus conclusion; I am getting malt aromas on the nose as well throughout the after taste. The mouthfeel is between light to medium bodied with a slightly creamy, more of watery kind of texture and good carbonation. Goes down smooth and slightly dry."
"12 oz. glass bottle- color of clear amber, with a off white head - nose of light fruit, light nuttiness, and malty  taste of light fruit, light nuttiness, and roasted malt - body is light to medium, and with medium carbonation  aftertaste of sweet, caramel, and nutty"
"Drinkability: easily drinkable and tasty. A six-pack is not enough so shop for more. Hoist the tankards, it's Oktoberfest."
"Drinkable but not a stand out."
"Pours a clear orange/gold. Flavor is slightly sweet, but smooth. At first there seemed to be almost a perfume touch. Goes down very smooth, which ups the drinkability. Feel is thick with character and a good level of carbonation too. Good to try, but not spectacular enough to warrant a repeat performance I say."
"Not a bad beer from Paulaner overall, glad to see a light and flavorful marzen on the market, I would recommend this and would also drink it again, pretty impressed for a beer style that I am not usually very into"
"If you like this style--or even if you don't--you deserve to give this one a try."
"D - very drinkable, with no overpowering but present flavors and a decent alcohol content i could drink several of these and be pretty satisfied."
"Most notably, the aftertaste is distinctly that of Pepto Bismal. Sounds strange, but I challenge anyone whose tasted both to tell me otherwise. Still, despite the medicinal afertaste, this was a very drinkable beer. Good for its intended purpose...which is being served in large portions without being a ""crap beer"". Probably ideal to be served out of a traditional Oktoberfest boot."
"Smooth and a bit heavier due to lower relative carbonation. Not as clean of a finish as expected; rather heavy and a bit syrupy. Very nice overall, decently balanced and a good accompaniment to food."
"Edit: 10/17/2009 Had some on tap and found it much better than in bottles, like a bready, nutty explosion of munich in my mouth, prob. my fav of the season"
"Flavor follows suit... dead-on Oktoberfest with moderately chewy amber malts and just a hint of leafy hops. Leans a bit more towards malt than Spaten's offering, yet is fairly similar in other regards. Classic example of the style, adequately malty mouthfeel without being thick. Highly drinkable."
"This beer is a good standarf for the style. It was brewer 06/07. I would love to try it fresh from the brewery in germany."
"Bottom line: It's a Paulaner Oktoberfest, what are you doing reading these reviews? Just drink one already! =P"
"Last O-fest in the fridge for this year. Very fizzy when poured into the glass -- reddish-orange hue with lots of bubbles. Smell is all malts. Sweet, caramel and nutty. Taste mirrors the aroma -- all malts, caramel, nuts and sweet twang that I can't place. Very nice. Easy drinking and very enjoyable. Glad this now available year-'round."
"D: Very drinkable & quite tasty. One of the better Octoberfests."
"Fresh malt and soft, unobtrusive aroma in a willibecker...nice one-inch head on an orange body...basically, the picture I imagine when ordering an Octoberfest... soft palate with a classic crispness...a slightly nutty malt taste...substantial body and a strong presence...a bit sweet too...the sweetness and strength are plusses....versatile and accessible, but with enough character not to be derivative..."
"Clear amber orange in color, topped off by the perfect sized head. thin rings of lacing stick to the glass. Aroma suggests of bready malts, pumpkins, husk, and a bit of spicy hops. More of the same in the taste, with a faint fume of alcohol. Stable mouthfeel. It's very easy to sit back and drink this, without any monster flavors interrupting while having enough to have you going back for more."
"This year's review of the Oktoberfest seemed slightly better. The smell was very raisin, prune, molasses. Taste is good caramel malt. Better than I remebered."
"Grab this stuff if you can find it! I got it locally for US$32 per case but didn't even check the place across town that usually has lower prices."
"The taste was very malty with just the right amount of hop bite at the end and was a great example of an Octorberfest bier and went excellently with the cuisine."
"Beautiful Amber colors. Of the 5 different O-fests I've tried this year...I think this one is my favorite. (6, if you include Sam Adams that I had a couple years ago.) This was very smooth, crisp and clean, and a tad thin, which I personally liked. It was caramel-malty, typical of the style, but not TOO caramel-ly-sweet. Just enough to make it nice, and finish very clean. I recommend this one over many O-fests. Wish I had more, but maybe next year! I'm sure this one would be great with all the delicious German grub, but I drank it by it's lonesome. Very nice O-fest. (If you want to know the other 4?...they are: Spaten, Stegmaier (From PA), Victory Fest Bier, and Harpoon. I think Paulaner takes the cake over these.) Cheers and SAAALUTE my BA friends!"
"Drinkability is very, very high. A great quaffer!"
"D - This is a very tasty Oktoberfest. Paulaner is a traditional brewery at THE Oktoberfest (Munich) and it's plain to see why they've maintained that place. They're no slouches when it comes to the Marzen style. Another fine beer from a fine brewery."
"D: Easy beer to drink. I could drink it all night long."
"d - a very drinkable beer overall, very balanced...as people have mentioned before oktoberfests are meant to be session beers and this would do very well for an afternoon or evening of drinking, i look forward to getting this beer again"
"d - this is the best oktoberfest-marzen i've had to date. looks like it'll become a fall staple in my fridge."
"Overall - A decent enough example of an Oktoberfest beer... well worth a try.."
"Decent octoberfest. On sale at bevmo."
"have one in your hand constantly and served cold would probably be the best. I had actually expected this to be better then it was, but it merely turned out to be average. It was not terrible by any means, just again I expected a tad bit more. If it is there you could do worse."
"Though maybe the 5-point assessment brings this beer down in my mind a little, it is still one of the top Märzens of the season. I look forward to having more next year... if I don't buy more THIS year."
"Taste is predominantly malt with light straw and some biscuit notes. Bitterness is medium and the beer shows some hoppiness. The beer has something unfresh, a funny aftertaste and a sharp bitterness, combined with an unexpected warming alcoholic sensation. Aftertaste is also dry. A somewhat unbalanced beer at first, but after 0,5 liters of this stuff I have gotten used to it and drinkability isn't too bad after all."
"Mouthfeel holds up and overall this beer is extremely drinkable. I think this beer would be a great way to get a macro drinker to start looking for more in a beer without overwhelming him/her."
"Pours a beautiful amber. Makes me think Autumn is right around the corner. Really don't have much experience with German brewed Marzen/Oktoberfests, but I enjoyed this much more then any domestic Okotoberfests that I have ever had.Nice malt, and some sweet character give a pretty good balance. In the finish I tasted a very small hint of spice. Wonderful beer. Everything an Oktoberfest should be. Having had a small tasting of Okotoberfests with friends, this one stood out."
"a nice bright copper color with a one finger off white head that fades to a ring on the glass with some spotty lacing. smells are of a floral and herb mix. taste is toasty and bready malt, and slightly sweet. mouthfeel is light and carbonation is crisp and very good. i think paulaner makes a good octoberfest but it's not my favorite style of beer but still very drinkable."
"Very tasty, smooth and easy to drink. The standard for the style."
"Dark golden orange. Nice thick off-white head. Smells malty and sweet. I found that the Paulaner beers that I've had have all had a syrupy sweetness to them. I've had the double bock and I thought the same thing. Tastes good. Nice maltyness and german beer flavor with just a little bit too much sweetness. Not overpowering but it's noticed. A little thick to be superdrinkable. Good beer overall."
"This beer poured a nice amber color with an off white 2-finger head, with a slight hoppy scent to it. This beer had a hop flavor to it, but was also very sweet. A little bit more sweeter than most oktoberfests i have had. Very enjoyable. I could drink this beer agian."
"It became clear to me after having this brew why Paulaner is among the big 3 of German brewers to define the Oktoberfest-Marzen style with this more than appropriate and highly regarded fall offering."
"Excellent brew... so how could it NOT be drinkable? No problem at all making a session of this!"
"Drinkability: Just wasn't impressed. Didn't match the style in my opinion and I've tasted better Pilsners / Lagers. Think Paulaner is overated."
"Drinkability- This beer is nice. Very easy to drink and drink a lot of."
"Paulaner Oktoberfest Marzen was amber in color with good clarity. It had an off-white head with good retention and left some lacing behind. The aroma was sweet malt. The taste was sweet, toasty malt upfront with a dry finish. It was medium in body with good carbonation. Drinkability was very good. This was a well balanced and quite tasty Oktoberfest."
"Still a can't go wrong choice if serving up a plate of brat's and sauerkrat!"
"A clear copper color with two fingers of head (vigorous pour) that faded to a thin, persistent wisp, leaving chunks, then lines, of sticky lace. Smells like rich toasted malts -- mostly caramel cake with hints of plum, roasted chestnut, vanilla, and burnt toffee. Tastes equally rich, with a perfectly placed hop bitterness to keep it from being a dessert beer. The one thing that bothers me a bit about the beer is its sticky mouthfeel -- I'm pretty sure the style is supposed to be crisper than this (I mean, it's a malty lager, but it's still a lager, no?). Regardless, very sessionable, even at 5.8%, and you can tell that it's textbook Marzen -- definitely the best Oktoberfest beer that I've ever had. Hooray for Paulaner!"
"M- Smooth, very well carbonated, only the off taste in the finish puts this beer down a rung or two."
"Copper/ruby read color, more than ample head. Smell suggests exactly what this is, which is as good a representation of the style I know of. Sweet, velvety malt, and I know this is probably the power of suggstion, but I swear I smell pumpkin in here. Tastes like a meal, Euro-hops dance energetically on the back of the tongue, creating a fine counterpart to the malt. Mouthfeel coats, then washes away clean. A damn fine beer."
"Poured a clean, pretty, copper color, frothy head disappeared fairly quickly. Notes of vanilla in the nose. Delicious sweet, malty flavor hint of vanilla. Mouthfeel a little bit underwhelming, maybe little thin but certainly not bad. A highly drinkable and delicious brew, there are a few higher rated Marzen beers but this is one of the better examples of the style. Makes me want to go to Munich in Oktober."
"I had this on tap at the Ginger Man in Greenwich CT. It was dark orange colored and clear, with a thin white layer of foam. The smell was dominated by malts, it seems to me that the best Oktoberfests are almost malt bombs, lots of sweet malt with very little bitterness. Anyway this one was nice and had a really thick body which lent a hand in adding physical presence. Very good for the style."
"D: Very wall balanced and easy to drink."
"The taste is nothing extraordinary, but it certainly is very much worth trying. Strong malt taste. Medium to low carbonation with very little bite. It has a strong taste of spice. It is not the best Oktoberfest beer I have had (personally I really like the Great Lakes Brewing Co.), but it is really pretty good. I would recommend it. I would give it a 3.8 out of 5."
"great drinkability- will be trying more of this style- just afraid after this most others won't stand up to this one"
"D- This is very drinkable by any standard. I'm happy to kick a few of these back as fall begins."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into a Warsteiner glass half liter mug. Poured to a copper amberish color with a nice foamy head. Smell light bread yeasty aroma with light hop aroma. Taste smooth crisp malt driven beer with low IBU's . Mouth feel is light. A perfect session beer for Octoberfest."
"A classic example of the style and one of the best in my opinion."
"pours a reddish brown amber color with not much head, smells like roased barley(obviously) but a little more than other oktoberfests i've had, has some other sweet sugary, caramel scents as well. tastes good, rich and full, goes down easy, with alot of flavor. moutfeel is decent too, drinkability is high, good tasting, not overpowering."
"Scott"
"Finished very clean, making me want more. As a fan of Marzens, I have had some that were overly ""malty", and tough to finish. This is easy to drink."
"D-I am personally not an Oktoberfest beer fan, but this one is wonderfully crafted and easy to drink. Nice change of pace from my normal choosing."
"Pours a crystal clear copper color with a nice and rocky head that took its time to dissipate. The smell is of caramel malt and nobel hops. The taste is of bready caramel malts. A nice big malt presence followed by nobel hops. The feel is moderate and crisp, well balanced. This is one of the better Oktoberfests available. More of a malter presence than than the Hacker-Pschorr and Hoffbrau offerings."
"D: Up there with the best lagers I have ever had in any category, definitely one of the best Oktoberfests made, great that its made year round. Drinking a couple liters of this while listening to an oompa band and celebrating my German heritage would not be a problem."
"Very easy to drink, great flavor. A top notch Oktoberfest."
"I decided on the eve of the German Beerfest here is Boston that I would compare the top two Oktoberfest beers, in my mind: Hacker-Pschorr Original Oktoberfest and Paulaner Oktoberfest-Marzen. I tried the H-P version first. It has a clear, amber color with a small head. The aroma is very sweet, malty, and carmelized smell. It tastes very full-bodied and rich. The mouthfeel is very nice and smooth with the drinkibility to last alll day....what it was brewed to do. The Paulaner version is very similar in appearance, with a slightly larger head, and also in aroma, but a slightly stronger smell. The taste is much the same, along with the mouthfeel and drinkibility. As far as I can see, you can't go wrong with either one!!!"
"D - A solid easy drinking Oktoberfest."
"I kept hoping or anticipating a crisper finish. The beer was quite drinkable but no US Light Lager :)"
"Drinkability: A very nice Oktoberfest but my favorite is still the Allgäuer Oktoberfest"
"M/D: this is a good beer, and one of my fav for this style. very easy to drink, but provides you with more flavor and robustness than a weaker beer."
"Pours a golden amber with a thin white head that faded fairly quickly but did leave some bit of lacing. Nice sort of tasty malt aroma which carries over in the flavor where the malt is balanced by a nice hop finish. As the beer warmed I got a hint of alcohol. This was a very nice beer and I look forward to tasting it from a bottle this season."
"Drinkability- Great seasonal brew (I know its brewed year round but Im not the biggest fan of big malt in the spring and summer). Tastes almost exactly how I expect an Oktoberfest beer to taste and is o-so refreshing."
"Otherwise this is still one of the better Oktoberfest beers out there."
"Drinkability- Very, I could enjoy this every oktoberfest. Strangely enough, no oktoberfests in my area have this anywhere to be seen. I lucked out and found a 6pk and I love it. Rich and creamy. A real pleasure to drink."
"D - Drinkable without a doubt. Not a sessioner at 5.8% but a few wouldn't go down too badly."
"Definitely a session type of beer simply because you can drink it all day long without getting bored or tired of it and from the 3L can it's as fresh tasting as draft."
" There is a beautifully sweet, well-crafted butternut flavor up front, along with roasted nuts and that signature marzen caramel sweetness usually found in the style. There is very low bitterness, but the beer never becomes overly sweet or unbearable. The flavor remains interesting and complex throughout the brew, making it one of my favorite Oktoberfests to date. It is a bit on the heavy side, but even so, I could have a few of these in a sitting. Excellent job by Paulaner. Now THIS is how to do an Oktoberfest."
"Drinks good, this was better in Germany, but not one of my favorites for this style"
"This pours up brilliantly clear! But the off white head disappates quickly, leaving a few small bubbles around the sides of the glass. Hints of ruby highlights accent the amber color. It smells of caramel and a bit of roasted malt. The taste is almost all caramel malt. It is slightly sweet. It reminds me of maple syrup, but fizzy. It leaves a circle of sweetness on my lips. I prefer the classic Oktoberfest over the homebrewed or brewpub version, which is a much bigger beer."
"drinkability - Highly. Great session beer even though its almost 6% abv."
"Drinkability: I could put a few of these down, but the lack of balance kind of turns me off. Seek other Oktoberfest beers before picking this one up. That said, I may have another look at this one later..."
"This lager is fantastically easy to drink! A fine brew."
"Drinkability: While I love Paulaners beers, this one seems a bit sub par compared to their other styles. I would rather drink Salvator, but I feel it is nevertheless a good Marzen. It takes well with greasy foods, washing down the palate. I had this beer with a plate of Weißwurst and Kässpätzle"
"Drinkability - Really easy to drink."
"Well, the head evaporates right away, leaving practically no lacing, so marks off for that. This beer's flavor is fairly straightforward -- Horrors! Do we have a macrobrew in sheep's clothing?"
"Pours a beautiful copper/orange color. This looks like one good beer in a clear pint glass. The head, that does not last for long, appears to be orange in color as well. The smell is nice, and not too overpowering... nothing special though. The taste is not a ""dark"" as I had anticipated, but it is a good beer. I can see myself drinking a few of these on a nice fall day. Good beer for my first Oktoberfest - any other absolute ""must try"" suggestions?"
"Overall, I was a little dissapointed with this Marzen. I really like this brewery, but feel this beer is lacking in depth and character. I also found it too sweet."
"Taste is better than the aroma. Quite a bit of doughy sweet malt here, with substantial hop kick in the finish. Carbonation is disappointingly quite low, but a low of creamy smooth body is revealed. Pretty decent, and quite drinkable. Refreshing, not too heavy, and decent taste - I could drink a few in a pinch."
"Pours a nice amber color that resembles a glass of iced tea and is capped by a very loose bubbly head that dissipates quickly to the thinest of collars. The nose is dominated by caramel and sweet, warm bread. Almost a hint of something slightly tea-like (green tea?). First sip brings a crisp tingle to the tongue followed by a huge, caramel, biscuity, sweet middle. The hops are somewhat absent at mid-point, but they come through with a fairly long, dry, crispy finish. Body is just thinner than medium and spot-on for the style. The sweetness may get a bit much for me over an average session, but I can't complain as this pint disappears. Plus, I sampling in 100 degree Georgia heat, so this might be better on the palate in cooler Fall temps."
"Poured a golden amber with a head that dissipated quickly. Pretty smooth and drinkable, but not my preferred style of beer. I would much rather drink their Hefeweizen which is excellent. It kind of grows on you as you drink it, however. No real strong characteristic"
"Drinkability: Good. This beer is quite refreshing but becomes fairly heavy after a couple."
"D - Excellent. I could drink stein after stein of this. A classic example of the style made extra drinkable by it's higher than average carbonation for the style."
"This beer isn't perfect however, with it's unimpressive and muted smell and a thick mouthfeel that can grow a little tiresome over an entire exclusive evening with this drink. This is a beer that you want to sip, relish, and move away from."
"D- an ok beer that I would have again, but there are better selections out there."
"Drinkability- Very nice brew. And this coming from a hop-head!!!!"
"I still wouldn't want to drink this beer all the time, but it sure made for a nice change from the usual hop monsters and other extreme beers I so enjoy. Excellent beer..."
"D: I think 9 months is showing its effect on head & mouthfeel, but the malt & hop flavours are still in relatively good balance & evidence. Hope the shop where I got this can acquire it sooner next time."
"Soak your brauts in some other crap, this beer is for drinking!"
"D: Pretty good Oktoberfest beer, good malty flavor.Fairly easy drinking however."
"I took a 5 liter mini keg of Paulaner Oktoberfest Marzen Amber on a camping trip. It poured a nice reddish, dark copper color with a white head. Very malty nose. Excellent malty flavor, really a fine drinker. Recommended, and I might add that the mini keg had the coolest graphic ever, three fat german guys (presumably at Oktoberfest) chugging mass krugs of Paulaner Oktoberfest, no doubt."
"Pours a burnt orange amber with golden hues and a decent white head that fades quickly. The smell is sweet and malty, with some yeast and doughy characters. Taste is very similar with some spices thrown in, and a doughy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is smooth and medium/light, with a good balance bringing in decent carbonation. This is a sessionable beer, not very strong in taste for an oktoberfest, but has that malt driven flavor. A good beer worth giving a try, I was happy with this brew. Cheers!"
"This Oktoberfest pours a brilliantly clear light copper into my glass, very striking. The white head was thin and diminished quickly to a rim around the top. The aroma of the beer high on the toasted grains (lots of Munich), there is also medium-low sweetness and a low spicy hop aroma evident. The taste of the beer is very malty, high toasted grain flavor with a little residual sweetness. The hop bitterness is low, but enough to provide a wonderful balance for the style. The carbonation is medium. The beer has a medium-light body with a very nice smoothness. Overall I really enjoyed this beer. The taste and aroma of toasted malts is wonderful, as is the smoothness of the beer. The drinkability of this beer is quite high and I will certainly buy this Fest again, hopefully someday in Munich."
"This is just a great Oktoberfest...I know some may say that this is ""mass"" produced beer, but hey, sometimes they mass produce something the right way. Pours a medium mohagany. Smells of maple sugar, malt, and polka music. Taste is sweet, with some caramel elements. Carbonation is middle of the road. Could drink this all day long, and sometimes I do. This just tastes like the fall to me...football, brats, and cool weather. Great with smoked cheeses and sausage. It's everything I like about beer."
"A must for the summer season, since it is oh so drinkable. However, I had one left in the fridge from a recent purchase and thought, why not? This pours a copper color with appropriate carbonation for an Oktoberfest beer. Somewhat light nose, some yeast, some malt. The taste is refresingly light with hints of sweet-ish hops and malt. Goes down nice and smooth. Almost like a summer pale. I'm a fan of all things Paulaner. This brew is easily a session beer."
"Drinkability/Conclusions - This is probably my favorite oktoberfest so far. Worth seeking out this time of year. Another fine brew from paulaner."
"Drinkability: This brew is certainly drinkable with its light mouthfeel and it's too thick."
"D - Highly drinkable. A nice balance of malt and hops. Low-to-medium ABV makes it easy to drink multiples of this beer."
"A pleaseant enough beer, but why are all the main Munich brewers numbing down their Marzen beers? It couldn't be anything to do with cost and time could it? Surely not!"
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The appearance is a nice dark copper, with no head, and little to no lacing visible. Can't detect too much aroma on this one, aside from a slightly sweet smell. The taste is much the same, slightly sweet, but not overkill. An okay beer to session, but when it comes to flavor, this one is just a little lacking. Just not enough there. Maybe I just got a bad batch."
"I guess these guys have been brewing this beer for awhile. Well, they got a number of things right. It pours a nice-looking brownish orange color; just right for the season! Robust smell with the distinct odor of aged apples. Taste is crisp, nutty, and round. Mouthfeel is full, and is followed by a hearty finish."
"I love this brew. :)"
"Tastes solid. A meaty, malt-fest of a beer with a tingle of hop bitterness. Some mild, bitter chocolate is in there with a dash of black cherry and raisin. Has a well rounded, lovely finish and is definately a tasty version of the style."
"D - A very nice flavorful octoberfest. It just tastes very good."
"Honey-nut color with medium cotton white head. Head almost vanished in a matter of seconds. The smell is of toasted barley and honey. Tastes of toasted honey, sweet not bitter at all. Very very smooth on the way down the throat, and has a very high drinkability. This is one of the best well rounded beers I've had."
"D - good seasonal beer. I think this should be enjoyed every year."
"M&D - super smooth and drinkable, a great o'fest, one of the best if you ask me"
"The traditional Oktoberfest. Light flavor, good body, very easy to consume."
"The drinkability is very good, this is a great drinking brew. Light on hops but the delicate yet big malt flavor is awesome. Prosit und Zum Wohl, MK"
"I really like this style but this was not my favorite of them. It has a traditonal taste to it but not quite as malty or as much punch in the taste as like a Sam Adams Octoberfest. A bit thin in the mouthfeel but definately an above average beer."
"Maybe one of the drier versions of the Oktoberfest. Good overall beer. No bad qualities about it. I recommend this one."
"Pours a dark amber with brown highlights, a big-bubbled head that fades to a ring, and sticky lacing on the glass. The nose is nicely expressive while maintaining a cleanliness characteristic of the style. Aromas of spice, vienna malts, and raw grain. Rich, sweet, chewy malts are the centerpiece of the taste here, but they're expertly balanced with dusky, earthy hops that are perfectly bitter. Mouthfeel is thick, robust, and hugely malty, with medium carbonation that doesn't need to be any bigger. This is one excellent Marzen; kind of prototypical of the style. Great."
"This ale pours a very clear and deep amber color. The head is a bit flat for my liking and leaves minimal lacing. The carbonation is just right and stays consistent from start to finish. Heavy malt aroma and flavor take center stage with a light caramel flavor in the wings. The finish is smooth and soothing. Dare I say this might be the best Oktoberfest Ive had this year? Yes. Other than the flat and short lived head, I find no faults worth mentioning. Another fine brew from Paulaner."
"This beer pours a dark gold color with a moderate head. The smell is pleasant, mostly like malts with the wheat especially potent. Big malts in the taste as well. There is a hint of sweetness, which almost gives it a vanilla-like flavor. Extremely smoothe going down, and well-balanced: it seems there is not much in a way of range in the taste, but the depth of the mono-lithic taste is great. A lovely beer."
"Poured into a glass, appearance is that of beatiful orange color that we all love in our fall beers, leaves a nice head that leaves some lacing. Smells is of fruit; apples that have just fallen from the tree. Taste is tangy tarty bread that is very fresh and has a bitterness as well. In my opinion one of the best oktoberfest brews around."
"[ serving type: bottle ]"
"Pours a nice amber hue with a light fluffy head. Smell is caramel like, malty. Fairly active carbonation bites at the tongue. Big time malt flavor with a nice caramel undertone. Sweetness is kept nicely in check by a generous hoppiness. Very nice brew and easy to toss back a few of these."
"The mouthfeel is rather interesting due to the high carbonation. It is fairly creamy and yet the carbonation tingles the tongue. This is a very drinkable beer that I will certainly have again."
"The pour was caramel in color, crisp and bright with thick creamy off-white head. The aroma was caramel. The taste was malty, bready, with some toffee. Fine, drinkable beer. Possibly the favorite of the three, but it was really really close."
"Drinkability is great. This beer is nicely balanced throughout and an excellent choice for a bulk Marzen purchase."
"Pours a deep caramel color with creamy light tan head that fades away to a film pretty quickly, but clings to the glass all the way down. Smells of molasses and chocolate malt, very pleasant. Tastes very chocolatey and malty, very slight hop flavor. Some bitterness, just enough to balance it out. I've had porters that didn't have as much flavor as this. Mouthfeel is very thick, heavy and creamy with just a little bit of carbonation. All in all, it's a very drinkable beer, I wish I could afford to get it more often."
"Very creamy and warm mouthfeel, yet refreshing and crisp as a Märzen should be. This is as close as I'll get to Munich this year, but it's not a bad spot to settle."
"A well crafted Marzen in terms of aunthetically-flavored ingredients and balance. A refreshing change of pace as 'newer' takes on the style can be too sweet, too heavy, and artificial tasting."
"Copper-brown color, with a decent white head. Aroma is deliciously bready. Flavor is just right for a Marzen; extremely malty, with almost no hint of hops. Actually a little bit sweet. Highly drinkable beer; I look forward to this coming out every fall."
"Overall a VERY drinkable German Oktoberfest. Not overly sweet."
"Pours a crisp copper brown color with a thick, rocky head of tan. Leaves the glassware heavily laced. Nose is of sweet malt, as expected. Palate is light molasses and roasted malts. Only a slight hop balance. Mouthfeel ... predominantly sweet, of course. Medium-bodied and a surprisingly dry finish. Very drinkable for an Oktoberfest beer ... not among my favorites. If you like malt-dominant beers, you can't do much better."
"As far as bottled Oktoberfests go, I don't think it gets better than this."
"Orange translucent body with almost no head. Smells sweet and malty, but not overly strong. Tastes sweet and malty, slightly floral maybe? Carbonated but not overly so. On the lighter side of medium bodied, I'd say. I was surprised that it wasn't slightly heavier or more tasty, but it was very good. Deffinitely one of the better Oktoberfest beers I have had..."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable, very smooth."
"Doesn't seem like a beer I would drink a lot of,it just did really do any thing for me,it was kinda just there."
"Mouthfeel was somewhat creamy and smooth."
"Very drinkable and decent. Not an everyday lager but I can understand why Germans toast to this every year in Munich during Oktoberfest."
"Not the most drinkable oktoberfest, but more so than others. Worth a try."
"Poured into my Smithwicks pint leaving a thin, quickly dissipating head leaving some nice lacing. As I sit here I cant help but smell an incense type smoke emitting from the glass. (im not smoking . . . anything) looks a deep copper with very little carbonation. the taste is of strong malt and hops, yeasty. Feels very silky to the tongue. Definitly drinkable."
"Very nice copper color with a thin white head. Nice malty, bready smell with a slight toasted note. Taste is also very bready. Nice balance with a slightly bitter finish. Also some fruit flavors in the finish. Nice medium body with a good carbonation level. A nice beer, I bet it would taste great in a beer hall in Germany."
"Drinkability - this is very good beer, and very sessionable."
"D - Exceedingly drinkable, I could quaff liters of this."
"Overall, it's a decent, though flawed (at least by the time it reaches American stores) O-fest. But, it's not the best Bavaria has to offer, IMO. If it were sitting next to a Hacker-Pschorr, for example, I wouldn't be grabbing this one. Still, if I were in the mood for a Bavarian Oktoberfest and this were it, or if offered, I'd certainly drink it."
"Finally, finally, finally, I was able to find a fresh bottle of Oktoberfest-Bier in Minnesota after seeing nothing but one year old (and even two year old!) bottles on the shelves of local stores. As it turns out, I'm not sure why I was looking forward to giving this beer a go. There are much better versions around, many of them from little heralded American craft brewers."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- From the instant this beer meets the lips, it's a certain victory. Fantastically effervescent, it rides into the mouth and over the tongue with confident grace... all the while alive and outspoken. What a prime example of this style to enjoy with bratwurst and sauerkraut... bring on the music and dancing, it's that special time of year."
"D- This beer has a nice light malt flavor that comes through more as it warms but I would like a bit more. The hops flavor is pure noble bitterness which is not that interesting and could have more depth. This is a drinkable beer but I don't think I could drink 1 or 2 liter in on sitting."
"Drinkability/Notes: Paulaner Oktoberfest is a big, malty somewhat fruity sweet Festbier. Very easy on the palate with a relatively low abv makes this an easy drinker. Definitely sessionable in every sense. A nice fall lager that I will seek again. This is a style that I'm starting to like more and more. Seek and enjoy. Recommended."
"Musings: A highly drinkable Marzen - as long as the dating is right. Keep an eye on it and you'll have a smooth drinker awaiting you."
"The color of sunshine amaretto with some mediocre bubbling. A thin head and a thin film too boot. A nice lagery amber though I must admit. The aroma is an almost overwhelming sweet malt. Lots of Hawaiian sweet bread. PLenty fo the amber malt in the mouth too. Makes me think of a happy tasting lager. A little bit of clean and a lot of ale liuke fruityness. Refreshing yet flavorful."
"D: For my first Oktoberfest of the season, I was let down. This is definately on the lighter...or more subtle part of the scale...and doesn't have any components that stand out to make it a great beer. Visually appealing yes, but the flavor and consistency are ho hum."
" Taste is big on malt. No single flavor lingers for long, caramel, slight butterscotch, spice. Finishes clean. Mouthfeel is light I think, but the fullness of flavor makes it seem thicker. Hugely drinkable, I wish this stuff could be had fresh all year."
"D - Highly drinkable, probably more so than any Oktoberfest I've had thus far. One of the most satisfying beers of this style that I've enjoyed this year."
"Notes: This is a brew that may rejuvinate your enthusiasm for the Oktoberfest/Marzen style."
"The body is fairly full. Carbonation is sharp and stings the tongue. Crisp but not so clean in the finish, due to the metallic flavor. I could drink quite a few of these nonetheless, but there are other examples I've had this year that I would prefer for an Oktoberfest session."
"Poured a foamy, yellowish white head that fades briskly to a thick coating leaving a short wall of lace around the glass. Pungeant candied hops and some lightly sweet malt in the aroma. It almost smells like they soaked noble hops in gasoline, it's intense. The flavor mimics the aroma, but is very light, almost airy. The hops dominate the malt, but it's all very subdued. Finishes with a sprinkle of table sugar mixed with pale malt. Don't get me wrong, this is no hoppy IPA, but for some reason the hops reallz stand out. The malt profile is a bit timid for the style, which is probably why the hops pop. A delicate drinkable brew."
"Mouth: Just like it smells, but grainier. Hops are more present than in the smell, making the flavor a bit more floral. Apple cider-like. Mouthfeel is a nice medium bodied carbonation that goes down smoothly."
"D: Pretty damn tasty O'fest. A solid offering from Paulaner. Balance of malts was right on. Good smooth, creamy finish."
"I don't know what's going on with the reviews of this year's Paulaner Oktoberfest. My box was marked 07-07, 2006 and the brew was definately not amber or chestnut in color. Maybe it's that US import mess? The one I had was straw yellow on the pale side. It poured with lots of bubbles and not so much foam. The smell was rich with bread, herbs and fruits mixing. The first taste was sweet, spicy and bitter with bread and citrus there as well. Last year I prefereed Weltemburger's Oktoberfest but this year I'm leaning more towards Paulaner."
"A nice Marzen and quite drinkable, but just not as good as in my memories. Perhaps this is due to local brewers making good renditions of this style that are both somewhat more flavorful and quite a bit fresher."
"Pours a nice amber with orange hue. One finger plus head,with decent retention,and a nice lace. Smell is sweet and malty. Body is medium with some carbonation. Taste has a smooth honey quality, with spice,and a bit of hops to balance it. Very tastey!"
"Drinkability: Flavorful, yet not overwhelming. I love to sit back with some of these as the air starts to turn cool."
"Pours a pretty orange-amber color with golden highlights, topped by a finger of tan head that sticks around for a little while. Nice aroma of sweet caramel malt, a touch of roastiness, and a whiff of raisin. Palate is very pleasant - sweet caramel malt, light fruit, and just a touch of astringency. Medium body is smooth and a touch creamy, ideal for a marzen. I could see myself hoisting a few liters of this in Munich some year."
"Malty yet well balanced. A ruddy pour with little head that stays around in a pint glass. Warning: very drinkable to the point of becoming addictive. When it comes to a Oktoberfest celebration this is a excellent choice. The slightly higher alcohol at approx. 6% abv is well hidden."
"This beer poured a nice bright copper brown orange color. Nice white head lasts for a while. There was some mild lacing of the pint glass. It has a very malty, nutty, sweet smell. Just like whole grain oat bread with some brown sugar on top. Great smell really reminded me of what a great season autumn really is. The great color really makes for a beautiful presentation. Nice aromas of mild hops and some fruitiness. First taste was refreshing and clean. Nice mouthfeel with good malt sweetness upfront and a crisp hop finish. Well balanced and drinkable beer. There are some nice hints of caramel and some slight hints of faded yeast. Great start and finish to this one. The well rounded flavor of this beer makes it a winner in my book. I enjoy a good Oktoberfest and this one hits the nail on the head for style and presentation. Those German guys really know how to make a great brew. I enjoyed it to the last drop and then I got another. Certainly give this one a try."
"Pours a dark chestnut orange with a fluffy slightly tanned head and some lively carbonation. Leaves some lacing as I drink. Pretty perfect as far as oktoberfests go, but the head eventually just fades out almost completely. Big aromas of nuts and bread up front with an herbal tea-like hop scent mingling along. Malty. Chewy nutty malt flavors are dominant here with a noble hop kick that all finishes kind of dry. Flavors seem to wash away a little thin here and there, but other than that, this tastes great. Mouthfeel is softly carbonated but with sufficient bite. Still has a creaminess to it. Could be a bit more full as it gets kind of watery. I could see sessioning this."
"This beer gives me exactly what I expect from a märzen because it excels at presenting what makes this style great."
"D- I believe they put this next to the definition of what Marzen is supposed to be like. Does the job excedingly well."
"Next time in the bottle but I definetly woud drink it again."
"This is the first real ""craft"" brew that I ever tried when I first got into better beer. I don't know why it has taken me so long to review it. Pours a clear copper color with a fluffy white head that quickly transforms into a thin white lace. Delicious malty aroma with a touch of hops. Taste is sweet toasted grain finished by a balancing hop bitterness. Overall, this is without a doubt one of if not the best Oktoberfests.."
"Notes: Can't go wrong with this one, on its own or with food. Went great with the cheeseburger I had with it."
"The head was creamy white with a thin collar. The color was an autumn foliage mix of amber, red and orange. The smell was of a crisp unrefined wheat with hints of apple and pear. Mouthfeel was smooth, light, airy with no harty aftertaste. I though the taste was amazing, full of sweet notes with hints of maple and almonds. Just a great beer to unwind with during a cool fall evening"
"Pours amber/orange in color with a fair white head. The smell is very malty and earthy. Taste is sweet and malty, with a slight tart hoppiness. Mouthfeel is medium, with medium low carbonation. There is something about this beer that is more than the sum of it's parts. Maybe it's the changing season, or maybe it's just really good beer."
"Cheers!"
"D: A great Oktoberfest. Malty, but not too sweet with some great, lingering flavors. I'm not a huge fan of the style, but find this quite enjoyable."
"This past weekend I picked up my 50l, kegged on 7/14/06. Wonderfully smooth, honey on the nose, tongue and in the glass with a slight hint of alcohol and nice lace. Smooth going down, too. Frothy head just like I had in Germany. Overall, this is one excellent brew and it just keeps getting better and better. Prost!"
"Wow! This is really fantastic. Pours a deep mahogany with very little head but decent lacing. My bottle says it was brewed on 2/04...oops. It really has held up beautifully though. The aroma is of raisins, caramel and brown sugar. Flavor is a molasses malt profile initially, more raisins, and toffee with a nice mild hoppy bite on the finish to keep it crisp. Everything is so clean and drinkable, yet very complex. The mouthfeel is substantial enough to feel slick on the palate, yet it is also very clean, crisp, and refreshing. I will be buying more of this. Highly Reccomended."
"This is exceptional Oktoberfest, at least this year."
"To quote the Wolfhouse Bros.of Beerfest, ""I want to freeze it, skate on it all winter, thaw it out and drink it."" I am usually a big fan of Oktoberfest beers and man why have I not been able to get this stuff around here until now? It pours a gorgeous copper color with perfect head and lacing. The smell is a tad low key but nice with carmelized maltiness and very mild spice detectable. The taste is smooth, satisfying and just downright delicious. Medium malted, sweet honey taste with a little graininess that finishes with a perfect hop balance to round out the beer. Mouthfeel is quite good, but drinkability is outstanding. This beer is more than appropriate for the giant mugs of Bavaria. If only autumn were six months long. Prost!!"
"Drinkability: I want to drink this continuously forever."
"D - Marvelously drinkable, even more so if you like a little sweetness in your beer."
"I'll definitely enjoy this beer again."
"Poured the 1pt .9 oz bottle into a glass stein and immediately the crystal clear amber color jumped out at me, beautiful. Produced a nice head but left no lacing at all. Smells of apples and malts wafted up from the drink and was rather pleasant. I'm not a big amber or marzen fan but this one is down right tasty. Just a hint of a phenolic twinge in there that I didn't agree with but other than that the tastes of mild hop bitterness up front with a smooth grainy malt finish was very nice. Overall a very drinkable Oktoberfest beer and I'd have another for sure if offered."
"Drinkability: At the oktoberfest, this would be the first tent i would head to.an extremely quaffable brew. extremely moreish, could drink for the whole autumn season"
"Quaffed a few at the Troll Tavern in Helen, GA. Came to the table in a pint beer stein. Lovely dark amber color with a thin quarter inch head. Aroma is mostly caramel and malt as an Oktoberfest should be. Taste is malty and sweet with just the right amount of hop bitterness. Medium body with the mouthfeel a little on the thin side. Great beer to have just to sit back and savor."
"Poured a nice orange/amber with a moderate sized head, about half of which stays around with nice lacing. The aroma is of malts and spices, enticing but not outstanding. This is a great tasting beer with a nice combination of sweetness and just the right hint of bitter. Very clean and crisp. The mouthfeel is pleasant and well balanced. This is very drinkable, you will definitely want at least 1 more and would make a great session beer."
"The appearance of this beer didn't impress me. There was a lot of carbonation, bubbles, and head in the beginning, but it quickly dissipated. The smell reminded me of grape bubblegum for some reason and maybe a bit of bananas. Sure IS tasty though, very fruity with a stinging hops aftertaste. The drinkability is where this beer shines through, very ""well-balanced"". I sure could go for another pint about now!"
"The best Oktoberfest I have had. Its a style that I have not had a lot of but to me this beer is great. I will definitely be picking up more of this beer this season."
"The beer tastes great. Malty, toasty, caramel. I like. The delicious noble hops are just along for the ride, and the delicious malt flavor is the driver. The mouthfeel is perfect. Enough to stop on the tounge and give you a good idea of what the beer is about, but it disappears and begs you to take another sip..."
"Good stuff, but don't get the 5L mini-keg unless you plan on finishing it in one sitting, as mine went flat the next day (could have been user error though)."
"12-ounce bottle, ""Produced on: 05.06," so this is a fresh bottle; 5.8% ABV. Crystalline orange-amber with a healthy head of just off-white froth. Utterly clean aroma with soft, round, bready notes and a subtly astringent noble hop character that leaves just a slight afterthought of sulfur. Very nice head retention for a lager. Chewy bread and softly sweet caramel malts come through at the beginning of the taste and are followed up by muted, clean and grassy hops. There is also a noticeable mineral presence in the finish that lingers through as an aftertaste. Lightly silky-smooth mouthfeel; refreshing and satisfying. Easily one of the most drinkable Märzens I'll try this year, I'm sure."
"Looking forward to trying the H-P and the Hofbrau (new to Litchfield County, CT!!) next week. I love this time of year!!"
"D - Good. Easy sessionable beer."
"An excellent session beer. Seriously, open your mind a bit and try it with a squeeze of lime."
"I'm getting ready to go to Oktoberfest for my first time in late September. I think this will defenitely be my beer of choice for Oktoberfests. It is no doubt a classic, and sould be as it's a very tasty brew."
"I love August. That's when the Octoberfest/Oktoberfest beers (and, yes, the pumpkin ales) start arriving in the local store. While I haven't (yet) been to Munich for Oktoberfest, this Paulaner offering is exactly what I imagine it would taste like. This one was particularly fresh and sat a gorgeous dark amber in the glass, capped with a 1/4 inch delicate foam head. The nose was all carmel and malt; and I noted that it was rich and slightly sweet in the mouth. The taste is also quite carmel/malt, but I noted a very nice hops bitterness--even a mild tartness--in the aftertaste. Talk about complexity... it's like the taste changes from sip to swallow. Excellent! In terms of overall impression, this import easily beats even the most well-made micros of similar style. Those Germans know their Oktoberfest beer."
"Pours amber, almost orange colored. Head dissapates quickly. All I can smell is a caramel like malt odor. Taste is also malts and caramel, maybe some slight hop bitterness. Medium bodied. This stuff is great, I could easily drink 3-4 or more of these. The maltiness has enough complexity to keep this interesting, but its mild enough to easily session this beer."
"Das Oktobervest Maerzen bier schmekt zehr gut! Ich will noch ein mal. TSCHUESS!"
"D - Very easy drinker. Good stuff."
"I'm not sure which German harvest or pagan God this Oktoberfest commemorates or for how long it lasts or what else occurs besides the imbibing of spirits but it sure is a sweet bit of carmel. Frothy and dark as a wet cave it leaves a mein kampf mustachio on your lip and the feeling that you too can overthrow Poland at some point in your storied life and seize Chopin's heart from its tomb in the pillar at Holy Cross Church in Krakowskie."
"This is my fourth different Paulaner, and with the possible exception of Heffeweiss, Im just not that impressed with their line. Like the others, this poured with a thick foamy head, which dissipated almost immeidately, and left little lacing. The body was thin, the taste okay, but the finish watery. I rated it just under 3, and I was being kind at that."
"body is a golden amber color with a hint of red. What little head it did have was white and receded quickly leaving a small amount of lacing. Scent is faint and of fruit and spice. Taste is sweet and malty with a slight bitterness at the end. A good brew even during the hot summer days. I could have quite a few of these with no problem."
"Good carbonation and a medium body lend a smooth yet crisp mouthfeel while the moderate 6% ABV make it quite easy to consume, a pleasant offering to it's style. A good German beer that probably tastes great fresh from the brewery...cheers!"
"Pours a lively copper colour with decent head that reduces to thin lacing. I didn't even have to stick my nose into it to smell it, the aroma filled the room insted. Reminded me of biscuits with butter and molasses from my farm days, very rich smell. The taste bore through the smell, molasses and biscuits with a hint of spice and a balacing amout of hop bitterness. Simply awesome and captivating it holds your attention and slowly recedes to a lingering finish with only slightest hint of alcohol at the end. Definately has re-sold me on the style as it's been 10 years since I last had an Oktoberfest and it wasn't nearly as good as this."
"¡Salud!"
"A drinkable Oktober, it was free, but I wish it had been fresher."
"D: A pleasing & drinkable beer. Not spectacular, but seems a definite winner for the big festivals and session-drinking it's intended for. Prost!"
"Overall this is a nice beer, but not a standout beer. Good stuff."
"Taste is quite similar to the nose, and quite similar to how I thought it would taste given its appearance. But not quite flavoursome enough. There is a good non-overpowering toffee sort of flavour, but otherwise mostly just a refreshing beer taste. Certainly not unpleasant but I wish there could be more to it than that. Having said that though, this is extremely drinkable."
"Surprised to see that I had never reviewed this beer. A frequent sampling at my local German Pub -- Marrikas. A staple malty, lager with big bready and fruity notes and evidence of nice maturity and age. The beer, appearing a hazy rust color and good retention throws up good fruity esters in the aroma. Aromas and flavors of ripe-to-bruised fruits of figs, dates, and prunes. Maybe an orange, apple, and pear thrown in. The fruit flavors begin to overtake the bready and yeasty flavors that are present. Light alcohols show sweetness throughout. Medium to heavy body for the style. Finishes sweet and fruity. Never dry. A good middle-of-the-road beer when you want good flavors, but not and intense beer."
"Had an interesting aroma with alcohol smell. Pours with a really nice, big head. A really good, sweet, malty, clean taste with a subtle hint of hops at the finish. Good mouthfeel. A very drinkable beer that's not too strong, simple, tasty and just hoppy enough to leave you wanting more."
"D - Very drinkable. A nice offering from Paulaner, was shocked to see this in the state liquor store, definitely had to pick it up though."
"Poured a copper color with a white head that quickly fell and laced the top. A constant stream of carbonation bubbles rose to the top of the glass. The smell was almost of toffee and a hint of hops. The taste was a little weak compared to the aroma. The mouthfeel and drinkability were just a little above average."
" Quite enjoyable. A true seasonal classic."
"Drinkabilty: yeah... maybe another bottle in the fall."
"beer is very drinkable enjoyable year round."
"Verdict- Top notch, very drinkable."
"2005 bottle left over from an Octoberfest party. The beer poured a bright redish amber color with a thick off white head. Nice and fluffy. The aroma is a mix of toasted malts and floral hops with the malts winning out. The taste is more of what you get from the aroma, some good toasty malts and caramel with a bite of hop bitterness but mainly you get the malts. This beer is a bit thick but I find it very drinkable and a good representation of the style."
"I got it from a local brazillian market for $4.50 (yes expensive but what can I do I live in Brazil...). But as another user said above, what a buy. Truly great drinkability, malty and full-bodied. In what concerns oktoberfest beer, I found this to be a very good one: smooth taste, good looks and very, very drinkable. Definetely worth a try."
"2005 Edition: This one is usually a favorite of mine. Dark reddish amber with a nice cap of pure white. Aromas of heavy German malts and light floral German hops. I find it hard to describe these beers as anything but malty as they are so one dimensional usually. This one taste like an o-fest should with some dying hop character. Aftertaste is a bit funky. Mouthfeel is medium , drinkability is good. I find this one more one dimensional and less drinkable every year though. I prefer the Hacker o-fest amongst other choice. This one is too pricey too, considering what it is!"
"Pretty good. I'll have to try other Oktoberfestbiers to see how they stack up to this one."
"Mouthfeel was a bit thick for my liking and anfter one big wiesse glass of this, I was feeling kinda full. Maybe I'm just a lightweight."
"This beer pours a very deep copper color with a thick foamy head that leaves quickly and doesn't give off any lacing.The smell is kind of adjunctly sweet with some spices. The taste is a little light. It is spicy and reminded me of some stirfry I made last weekend. It also has a toasted finish to it that rounds it out with some slight hops. The mouthfeel is good. It isn't light and it doesn't leave anyting on the tounge. By the way, WOW, this stuff is drinkable. It was a good intro into the style for me."
"Overall a good beer, nothing outstanding"
"I suspect I may have graded this even higher did I not drink it right before a Celebrator Doppelbock!"
"Cheers"
"D = good drinkability. I could easily drink a few pints of this."
"D - Great drinkability. Very close to a 5. I can imagine, one of these days, sitting in a huge O-fest tent hammering mugs of this. Highly quaffable. Excellent session."
"Poured a deep amber color with modest tannish head. Smell is strong of malt with with great toasty notes and some dark fruitiness. Taste is mainly roasted malt wuth some date and prune tastes also present. Nice full creamy mouthfeel. Finish is malty with minimum hop character. A very good beer on a cold winter night."
"A solid true Octoberfest beer. Very rich and very malty, almost like a mellow spaten optimator. One of the best Octoberfest beers out there."
"Extremely drinkable. Hard to find in NC, but whenever I see it I buy it. Have I mentioned that this is one of my favorite beers?"
"A classic Oktoberfest and one of my all-time favorite beers. If you've never tried it, run--don't walk--out and get some! Schnell!!"
"D: Eminently drinkable, this is like a well-made piece of lightly spiced bread in liquid form."
"(Or preferably, have someone else go buy it for you.)"
"Poured a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. Nice white head, impressive amount too, relatively good retention. Lacing was okay at best. Nice amber/auburn color with a frothy head. Sweet malty aroma, almost like apples or even apple cider (subtle fruity and floral character to it). The sweet aroma leads one to believe that the beer will also be sweet. In this case though, the beer may be sweet, but not overly so, like some other Oktoberfests that I've tried. It balances well with next to no hoppy bitterness. Any hops in this beer are very well hidden. Crisp and clean mouthfeel without much of an overbearing aftertaste. Nice and smooth going down and should be considered one of the better Oktoberfests on the market this year."
"Drinkability: I'm highly disappointed with this, especially after the Hefeweizen being so damn good. I guess from Paulaner I expected a lot more. There are many domestics that are better for my money at this point."
"Mouthfeel is about medium with some prickly carbonation on the tongue, which is somewhat refreshing and keeps the sweetness from getting out of hand on the palate. This is a good Oktoberfest to introduce people to the style, and darn good even if you're experienced. Yum"
"Opinion: This is a really clean and refreshing beer. I am eating it with pizza now, and it compliments the flavor nicely. This is one of those tasty brews that you can drink all year...not just in the fall. I highly recommend trying this one."
"Recent edit for Sept. 2006: This beer is better than ever. There's a new slight toastiness I'm picking up that I really enjoy. I'm noticing that the head retention is much better, too. I think this my favorite overall beer, honestly. It doesn't really have the depth of some other items, but in terms of sheer drinkability and good flavor...this is IT for me."
"nice. hats off to paulaner. a seriously drinkable brew and one i would be more than happy to try again. almost the ""opposite end of the oktoberfest spectrum"" from hofbrau, but easily the end i would prefer."
"The body is very full, and is quite good, and makes the drinkability quite nice."
"A very nice looking marzen with an orangish copper body with a nice frothy white head that retains well. Aroma is very malty with notes of toasted bread, caramel, minerals, and some noble hops. The flavor is subtle yet complex with notes of toasted bread, caramel, minerals, grassy and spicy noble hops round out the taste. The mouthfeel is full and a little bit chewy but spot on for a marzen. This is a really solid marzen, in fact one of the best i've had, this is enjoyable for a style i dont personally like very much and that says something."
"D = Good session beer. But not every session if you know what I mean."
"12 oz., bottled on 07/05 - served chilled in a pilsner glass. Pours a burnt honey color with a half inch of head that leaves bits of lace. Soft and malty in the nose with hops and caramel/molasses. Floral/spicy hops contribute a mild bitterness to the palate and the malts are semi-rich. It is pleasant and simple, with a medium to light body and a good amount of carbonation. Pretty easy drinking."
"drimkability is very high, definitley a fantastic fall session beer, this is one that i will probably pick up every autumn, if for no other reason than to provide a measuring stick by which to judge all the other octoberfests i buy."
"Notes - This particular bottle wasn't as good as previous ones I've had. However, it was still a pleasant brew."
"Light amber with a two finger white head that fades after a minute or two, leaving a film on the beer's surface. Gently rising carbonation. The aroma is fairly strong full of a malty sweetness and a bready element. This is the classic Oktoberfest aroma. The taste begins with a strong malty sweetness riding on top of a breadiness that keeps the sweetness from being cloying. The mouthfeel seems a bit watery and light. This is a solid and classic example of the style, but perhaps they're resting on their laurels? I know there's a better tasting Oktoberfest made right down the road from me."
"16.9 oz. bottle: This one pours a fairly clear shade of a lighter copper color. There was a small white head to it. The aroma is somewhat malty, with some floral and spicy notes. The taste is a slightly lighter medium bodied beer, with some sweet maltiness with a somewhat dry, slightly bitter finish. A decent Oktoberfest."
"Copper colored with a thin off-white head. Honeyish sweet malt aroma, with a background minerally hop zing. The nose is bright biscuit malt flavors with subtle citrus zest mid palate. Full mouthfeel, and the classic German malt flavors are complemented, but not overpowered by the hops. The finish is snappy and clean with a faint bready aftertaste. Great malt flavors, and enough hops to make it complex and well balanced. Probably my favorite Oktoberfest I've tried."
"overall- one of the best oktoberfests ive had. very well balance with no annoying aftertaste like some others ive had. definitely try this one out if you are a fan of oktobers, if not it might change your opinion."
"Taste is malty and sweet, lots of caramel malt, a bit of grassy hop for background balance. A sweet aftertaste sticks for a minute. Body somewhat light, mouthfeel ok but somewhat lacking in thickness at the finish. Drinkability is fine. It's ok but not great overall."
"Pours a deep amber/copper colour. Virtually no carbonation with a thin cream head that struggles to hold form all the way down. Very toasty in the nose, smells of roasted caramel, if y'all will let me say that. Malty sweetness in taste. Sweet caramel up front is followed by a hoppy crispness to finish it off. Alcohol is prevelent, but in no way overbearing. A very drinkable beer, I could definately sit down at a table and drink this allday long in the halls of Munich. Overall a very enjoyable brew. This is one where you savour every last delicious drop."
"Pours a very clean medium-copper color with cream colored head. Good retention with some slight lacing. I detect roasted malts and not much else. The bitterness is upfront with a bit of warming sensation following. Very much like an amber ale, only smoother. There is a bit of a peppery aftertaste that lingers and is enjoyable. Overall, a very enjoyable beer and an excellent example of the style. I can easily have a few of these in a single sitting."
"Thin mouthfeel, but the lack of stomach fill just makes me want to drink more."
"A nice amber. One that I'd love to try again."
" Having said that, I was not impressed by this beer. I actually think that I might like American microbrews take on the Oktoberfest better than the German original. The beer felt light-bodied and the taste was, well, delicate. This is not the Fluessiges Brot that I expect from a German beer. Not a bad beer by any means, but it failed to stand out from the crowd. Especially when it would have bought me a 4-pack of Sprecher."
"Flavor was sweet carmel with just a hint of bitternes at the end."
"Nose is very sweet malted, must have lots of munich in it and dry hersbruck like hops. Not much influence of yeast nose except the formed alcohol. Aftertaste is only bitterness and good. Yeah this is still good even if the brewery became Heiniken. Let's hope it stays like this in time cause this is a brew i always liked. Been at the fest itself so many times and always liked this one as one of the best. Fine but not to high carbonisation makes mouthfeel good and balanced. Drinkability is that that I had 8 of those MF's at the Oktoberfest in a row once."
"It took me a year to appreciate the subtleties of beers like this one... last year's Oktoberfest was a bit of a bust. Looking forward to getting a 1.5 liter mug of this and some wurst!.. and trying some of those Britishers again."
"Cheers"
"This is one of the bockiest marzens I've ever had, and also one of the best. Refreshing and very easily drank."
"I bought this one in a 5 liter keg for a party and found it to be a very enjoyable beer especially since the mini keg only costed $18. It was very rich in malty flavors and some breadish notes and a little dry spice. It was very clean and smooth and easy to drink a little sweeter than most oktoberfests that I have tried."
"500 ml bottle. Pours out copper colored with a small head. Malty bread aroma with some caramel. The flavor starts off as sweet caramel with toasted malts. German hops come in, but can't quite balance the sweet flavor. Mouthfeel is full. Pretty good drinkability. I like the big malt flavor in this beer, but it is just a little too sweet. Still, this version is quite good."
" I imagine that this would pair with sauerkraut and wurst just about as well as anything out there. OR, as aforementioned, putting a few back would alone would be fine also."
"Very enjoyable Oktoberfest. A simple pleasure for the season. Fully satisfying. Try some."
"Bottle obtained from Liquor Mart and consumed later that same evening. Pours a two finger tan/dark yellow head over a crystal clear light rust-orange lqiuid. Smells mild. Some toasted grains and the hopp aroma is orange peels? Whatever. Also a tangy melon smell. Tastes smooth sweet and sharply carbonated. Aftertastes starts with toasted grains and a hint of caramel. Nice flat Munich malt character that starts chalky and finishes sourish. Also, a hint of smoke. Interesting. The bottle was stamped 11.04 32443K."
"Smell is exactly what it should smell like--a very malty Oktoberfest. Tastewise-there is sweetness and caramel and tones of apple too. In fact a little too sour on the finish. This beer is not as good as I remember it being in past years. Maybe the recent thread about Hacker has influenced my judgement but I dont think so. Its just not as good this year."
"Despite this not being my favorite Oktoberfest bier I've ever tasted, it is a good example of the style. Not a bad place to start if you're looking for a solid Marzen. Extremely drinkable... I can feel the cold winds of October a-comin =P"
"Typical Oktoberfest color, a reddish-gold. Nice thick head that fades pretty quickly and doesn't leave very good lacing. Smells and tastes very sweet, like molasses or artificial grape flavoring. There's some dustiness to the flavor, which also features a slightly bitter and toasted finish. Mouthfeel is nice and thick. Overall, Paulaner's Oktoberfest is just too sweet, and I couldn't have more than one."
"Mouthfeel is decent. Nice chewy breadiness with a good amount of carbonation highlighting some sweets and sours."
"Had three different Okt brews this weekend (with Victory and Lancaster) this one outshone the rest on all categories."
"It's very smooth and pleasant going down. I can't wait to get my hands on more!"
"Rich and tangy a hearty brew for the fall season, but Very drinkable for one or two(ish)."
"Overall: I think this is my favorite O-fest I've tried this year, just a well-balanced stab at it."
"Taste is pure bliss, with a wonderful blend of spicy, noble hops and toasty, grainy, caramel maltiness. The body lightens a bit for the finish as the bittering spicy hops come to life. Very tasty, with a clean and dry finish. By far, the most drinkable of the Oktoberfest biers I've sampled this September. I would gladly keep a couple of cases of this Bavarian around for pleasure."
"Drinkability, is fantastic!!!...very good example of the style...and ....shit for that matter...just a good brew in general...put me down for 5 or 6!!!"
"D: It's like water! No... better than water!"
"Very drinkable, though not weak. Great full taste. Love this stuff!!"
"This Märzen poured a clear, light copper color with off-white foam that settled. The smell was malty, biscuity, with a touch of yeast. The taste was malty with notes of Munich malt and a very mild hoppiness. The mouthfeel was dry and smooth with medium body and good carbonation. The malty flavors lingered in the aftertaste nicely. This was a very easy to drink and enjoyable beer!"
"I wouldn't want more than one of these, but it went very well with the marinted lake trout that I had for dinner."
"drinkability: moderate"
"This is their best year so far and the keg is the only way to go."
"Served in a one liter stein at my favorite local German haunt. A light coppery beer with a full white head the leaves it lace all the way down. A full complex malt smell smacks my face as I get foam on my nose from smelling too close. The taste is of caramel and toffee with higher weight sugars that mix well with the German spicecy hops to produce a taste that is pure fall, the cleaness of this beer is a beauty in its own right. After one liter I order a second and hand my keys off to my lovely DD."
"pours a medium amber with a two-finger head that has a little staying power. very clear, no haze. laces the glass well. smell the caramelly malt and taste it as well. i believe i am partial to this style. i haven't ran into a marzen that i have not liked. finishes just dry enough to keep you coming back for more. great beer."
"Yellowish-orange in color. The head is medium thickness, off-white and has a hint of a pinkish hue. Medium carbonation, easy drinking. Flavor was a bit outside of what i had expected based on other Octoberfest's I've tried. Was nutty/caramel tasting, and the flavor was a bit forward for my liking. Has a very minor alcohol finish, and actually a bit more of that may have helped to disipate some of that forward nuttiness. I would probably give this one another try if I come accross it on tap. But I don't see myself purchasing another one of these in a bottle."
"Pours a nutty medium brown colour with a nice bubbly off white head. The smell is malty with notes of nuts, caramel, and bread. Taste is predominately the malt taste, however it never becomes sweet and is extremely well balanced. Mouthfeel is nice with a light carbonation that gives the beer a sort of lush creaminess. Drinkability is off the charts. A great all-day beer that goes well with a large variety of foods. Perfect for a fall day grill out and football"
"Second beer in a octoberfest tasting, medium copper in color, small white head and lightly carbonated. Nose has a slight malt aroma. Flavor contains some grassiness and some sweet malt. Beer finishes with a hint of sweetness and more of the same sweetness. Was nicer than Beck's Oktoberfest which was first beer tasted."
"All this with a date of 08 04 on the label."
"This beer might also make a good intro into import brews for any fan of Sam Adams Lager. Has many of the positives of SA, with few of the negatives. Overall, a nice beer that I will be having again as soon as possible."
"A not too frumpy, easy drinker."
"Smooth, creamy, very drinkable. My favorite Oktoberfest so far."
"Pours a crystal clear copper color with a smallish, rocky head. Smells of bread, biscuits and caramel...sweeter than I expected. Tastes very light and refreshing, with predominantly caramelly-sweet flavors, but also very crisp and clean with a smooth hop bitterness. Finish is slightly dry. Light mouthfeel, medium carbonation. A good session beer."
"As Ben said ""my stomach knows a good beer"" and with a name like Strehlmann I am sure it does."
"According to Paulaner's website, their Oktoberfest is only available between July and October. This accounts for how cheap it was to fill this growler. It pours a nice amber color with some orangy highlights and a thin off-white head that dissipated pretty quickly. Grainy/husky Vienna malt aroma typical of a good Oktoberfest with a light hoppiness. Very clean smelling and inviting. I know it is really not that fresh, but it doesn't come across that way in the taste. A nice husky and grainy malt profile with just the right amount of bitterness in the finish to keep it very drinkable. I'm looking forward to trying this one fresh this coming Oktoberfest season. No complaints, and the price was definitely right."
"Highly enjoyable, standardized Oktoberfest. Well maintained flavors and aroma, suitable for drinking year-round."
"Expecting something of exceptional quality, I stumbled into quite a fair ale. Not much in any category, but there is quality in how they did that. Musty aroma. Some initial head but nothing to look at. Suitable Above average carbonation, some malts and some bitterness and astringency in finish, with dry bitter aftertaste that's best part."
"Mouthfeel - Medium bodied and very smooth and thirst quenching. This makes an excellent session brew any time of the year."
"Drinkability: A highly quaffable Oktoberfest...definitely recomended"
"A lovely marzen that pours out with the characteristic orange/light brown body. This one seems a little lighter and more translucent than others I have had. A nice resilent off-white head is apparent and sticks around to chill with me for a bit. The aromas I love from oktoberfests are all here, slight toastiness, gentle caramelly malts and nuttiness. One smell Im glad that isnt present is skunk, because this fest-bier comes in a lovely brown bottle. This beer is a really smooth drinker, nice slick mouthfeel. The flavor is mostly biscuity and caramelly malts with a crisp noble hop in the finish. This beer is a really nice marzen, I think it could stand to be a little fuller in the mouth though."
"I can drink this all night."
"Very, very drinkable. Pairs great with other staples of Oktoberfest food, such as sausages and sauerkraut. Also goes well with beef dishes. World-class all the way around."
"The beer is just so drinkable, and definitely a treat every autumn (although you can now find it year-round, and, depending upon your point of view, can be disturbing). My only gripe with the bottle version I had is that it was slightly undercarbonated, yet I definitely won't let that deter me from future samplings."
"Pours a clear amber color with an off white head leaving a nice lace. Malty sweet red licorice smell with spicy hops. Medium bodied with nice carbonation. Malty, grainy sweet taste with a sweet n' spicy euro hop finish. A smooth, easy drinking brew. Probably much better fresh than it is in a bottle."
"Drinkability: Quite high, should have got out my stein from Germany and quaffed a few, but I didn't want to have to clean the dang thing out (stupid flip top lid)."
"Deep auburn color with a nice fluffy head. A very malty taste and slightly spicy as well. But for the most part, the malt dominates. Not the most drinkable beer, but very versatile. I could have it in either the summer or winter and be satisfied. Great representation of an Oktoberfest beer that I would love to try again for a second opinion."
"This is a nice beer very drinkable. I wish I had more than one."
"D: very versatile, heavy enough for a cold evening, equally welcome at the summer BBQ"
"I look forward to this brew every fall and have never been disappointed."
"The mouthfeel was decent, a little on the sharp side but still full. The drinkability is pretty high, without much sign of alcohol in the taste."
"Pours dark gold, not much head and minimal lacing,but very nicely carbonated.Appearence is a bit hazy.Good malt upfront in both the aroma and taste with a dry finish and slightly bitter aftertaste.Very drinkable.So far this year I think I prefer Hacker-Pschorr's Oktoberfest, but this is pretty good."
"a reddish-copper beer meets the glass and creates a foamy white head that doesn't last for a horribly long time. smell hits me while i'm pouring it, and it's all heady malts. the taste walks closely to the nose, with some nice caramel, and an earthy overall sweetness. posesses a tangy-zing flavour. mouthfeel is smooth, supports the flavours nicely. there is a lingering aftertaste which is sweet and nice. good easy-drinking beer that is not complicated and has good balance throughout, recommended."
"I got excited when I saw this one in the store because in my book Paulaner is synonomous with quality. This Oktoberfest certainly isn't bad but for me it is a middle-of-the-road beer not quite up to some of Paulaner's other brews. It has a nice golden-brown color and a somewhat thin but decent head. The taste is smooth and a little malty with some floral overtones and some bitterness. The carbonation is okay and it goes down well enough. The bitterness does make it a bit tough to down several."
"nice rich copper color with a pretty good tan head. smells very malty and sweet. the taste easily predicted by the smell. lots toasted caramel nuttiness up front. a bit bready. faint fruitiness and hoppiness towards the back, not bad at all. rich ,creamy, smooth mouthfeel, goes down real easy. solid oktoberfest. well balanced, and well crafted."
"Very similar to the Spaten Ofest, but I think I like this one marginally better."
"As an aside, I'd love to find the label art of this beer in print form for framing."
"Pale golden pour with an orange tint seemed a bit light for a fest bier. The body was topped by a short lived off-white head that left some decent lacing as it departed. The aroma was richly malty with earthy, bready notes wafting through. The taste was as advertised, with bready, caramel malt, and sweet esters giving just a hint of bananas. The aftertaste was grainy with a touch of herbal hops. A bit closer to a macro offering than I prefer, but a very appropriate session drink for the season."
"This is a fantastic session beer, and the mini-keg is a fun addition."
"Not bad by any means, but could have been better. Had on tap at 'bones. Medium amber, it came topped with a white head. Clean aroma, maybe a faint whiff of brown bread. Taste was sweet and smooth, mostly bready and lagerish. Nothing really jumped out at me, and to be honest, I think maybe it was too smooth, so it actually seemed a bit blah, like it didn't want to offend or shock. Would try it again though, especially if I was in D-Land."
"Eh. It's okay."
"The beer has always been a favorite of mine, and in hindsight, I have to say this may be my benchmark for a fine Oktoberfest. It comes from the bottle bright amber to copper with a light creamy head, and a surprising sheet of lace. A small stream of champagne bubbles renews the head after a time. The nose is all malt with hints of candy and figs. The taste is sweet malt up front, and more of the candy overtones mid drink with a creamy light finish and mouth feel. Very drinkable, and a great candidate for a session beer."
"A really nice oktoberfest"
"Clear plastic pint cup presentation. Pleasing 1/2"" creamy beige head over the deep copper brew. Aroma is deeply of grains, with a complementary hops aroma vying for attention. Taste is of medium grains upfront, quickly balanced by the hop character. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both great, and it goes down like all Oktoberfests should, easy. An excellent brew."
"Overall this beer didn't strike me down as hugely malty - its noble hopping kept the package very festive and drinkable. With most Oktoberfests, the mouthfeel was creamy rich. Welcoming for morning, afternoon, and evening drinking sessions."
"Pours a pretty, brilliantly clear, copper color that is topped by a light amber white head that is fairly thick. The aroma is light with notes of caramel, fresh baked bread, and bready malt notes. Actually the aroma is quite nice, though subtle at first it really comes to life the more you get into it. The taste of this beer is smooth, somewhat creamy, a little bit sweet, and has a finish that is a bit hoppy. The toasty bready flavors are here as well and really add a nice touch to this beer. A fairly simple beer that has a nice touch of Munich/ Vienna malt complexity and just a hint of hoppiness."
"Zum wohl!"
"Definitely one of the better German Oktoberfests for my money!"
"Pours a two finger white head that goes quickly and leaves some lace. Nice clear, amber color, starts malty, finishes smooth and hoppy/malty. Nose is sweet and malty. Good carbonation and medium bodied. 12oz bottle for $3.75 from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA. The ABV is 5.8%."
"This beer has a very nice appearance. Pours a deep amber with a frothy white head. Smell is dissapointing, mostly grain with some unpleasant undercurrants. This unpleasant undercurrant is repeated in the taste but is hardly noticable in the taste. Otherwise tastes clean, malty sweet with floral hops reminds me of honey. Decent carbonation and a firm body makes a decent mouthfeel. Beer is very drinkable abd I could have a session of these but is not something I'd drink all the time because of the rank smell."
"Drinkability is good but not great. Had this beer with several other oktoberfests and it fared quite well but have had better."
"crystal clear amber with pumpkin orange hues. big-bubbled snow white head lasts for a little while. very clean on the nose with hints of sweetened grains and noble hops. actively carbonated, yet still seems mellow and full. strikes a perfect balance between crispness and creaminess, just heavanly. big toffee/carmael sweet grain flavor balanced by clean european hops. strikingly balanced for the how big and malty this beer is. defines drinkability. the quintisential O-fest in my book."
"Very nice Oktoberfest. Pours a nice amber with a tiny white head. The smell is of toasted grain and toffee caramel sweetness. The taste in the beginning has a nice array of toasted grain and caramel sweetness, a light floral hop is detected and brings this beer together, hints of spices and herbs in the rear. Medium bodied and goes down smooth."
"I have hoped more from this one, it was a slight disappointment."
"pours a light brown with a decent head in a lovely 0.5 liter stange. fairly malty aroma, but the best part of the beer was the crisp, firm well balanced quaffability of the beer. Carbonation was spot on. The balance of malt and noble hops was a pleasure. I wish it were less expensive because I would have a few mighty sessions with this most enjoyable, flavorfula and easy drinking beer. Makes me yearn for the biergartens of Munchen"
"12 ounce bottle, with ""produced on"" dating info on label. Pours a light, coppery, brownish almond, slim white head, tiny bubbles and just a smidgen of lacing. Not much of a nose, deep malty notes, hint of a metalic note. Fruity, malty and pleasant stuff, not my fav style, but cannot deny that this are good everyday drinkin' suds"
"Very enjoyable and tasty Oktoberfest beer."
"What else can one say? This is Paulaner's best-selling beer in the US, and deservedly so."
"Excellent execution by the brewers. A bewitching, natural shade of amber / burnt orange. Caramel, malty aroma. Straightforward but dead on. Sweeter than it is bready, this is a smoother, more user friendly octoberfest than some others. It lacks any negative astringency or aggressive graininess. There's some in the finish, but this is largely a creamy, sweet, malty brew with exceedingly good balance. Crisp and remarkably drinkable."
"Great head, dense, fine, lasting perfectly on a dark orange color body. The smell shows very light hints of butter and toffee, nicely caramelized with some notes reminiscent of a barn (or maybe that's just the place where I'm having this beer).The taste is thicker than expected with some chocolate bitterness and with almost smoky hints of toast. Light liquorish hints of red fruits. Hops are noticeable. The mouthfeel isn't weak, but isn't overpowering either. just adequate. This beer has some character. Interesting."
"--Joey"
"This Oktoberfest pours a nice dark amber almost brown in color, with a nice thick head that leaves some impressive lacing. It smells of a nice malty character that makes you think of Oktoberfest, even though I have never been. I can only imagine what it is like with thousands of people drinking this stuff. I like to close my eyes and think about it when I smell and taste this. It has a nice malty taste which has a sweet nutty taste that I bet goes really well with bratwurst or sourkraut, or any other german foods that I can't think of right now. The mouthfeel is almost a chewy thick coating to it. Very complex and very satisfying. I could drink gallons of this like I am sure I would if I were in Germany during Oktoberfest. I know it is just now September, but Damn I love this time of year. Maybe it's because I am drinking it at work, but I am really digging this beer."
"clear brillant dark copper witha nice farily thick off white head. sweet and almost chewy cracked grain aromas mostly of vienna malt I think. very clean and balanced though there is a cloying residual sweetness that seems to build up in the finish. still very drinkable as it should be. I good go for a few liters of this anytime."
"This Oktoberfest beer from Munich pours a nice copper colour into the glass. The head is abouth an inch thick and long lasting. The smell is malty, very malty with some hint of alcohol too. The taste is also malty and bready with some hints of hops in the aftertaste. Some hints of alcohol in the aftertaste too. This is a nice beer that i will drink more of this Fall."
"Deep mohagany color with a foamy white head. Not much in the way of lacing though. Smell is really caramelly sweet with a cherry flavor underneath. Taste begins with more caramel sweetness and caramel dominates my palate throughout. There's a nutty flavor underneath which is accompanied by a smoky kick. Hops linger in the back and are spicy. There's nothing extremely phenomenol about this beer but it is a solid oktoberfest all around. I think this is the way oktoberfests were meant to taste."
"This beer goes down good on a hot summers day. All the qualities of a good pilsener but with the complexity of an ale. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer."
"Drinkability: Typical example of the style"
"My first Marzen style beer, I definently want to try some more of this style in the future."
"Extremely smooth with great malt characteristics that glide along the tongue. Slightly sweet with the barest hint of hops in the finish."
"It is what it is, and that's a classic representation of the style. The solid malt character tells you all you need to know about this beer. The understated sweetness allows the flavor of the grain to stand out. After this one, a second is certainly possible, but one might fill the bill just as well, as all that malt can certainly fill one's gullet. So it may not be one of my all-time favorites, but it's good and capable, and that's not so bad, really."
"Sampled 2/6/04"
"It's straight forward, not alot of complexity. Just that deep maltiness, light nuttiness and that light stickiness in th mouth you would expect from an Oktoberfest. This beer knows what it is and just sticks with it. Amazingly drinkable and statisfying. Not the greatest Marzen but a damn good one."
"Nice drinkable brew, I think Hop Monsters have deadened my sense of taste."
"Seems to be a decent beer, but I certainly wouldn't drink more than one in any single session. Perhaps the reason for that is my Ameicanized taste."
"The crisp, citrus-like hop presence was a surprise for this brew, but altogether the beer was not very challenging to the tastebuds. It was quite simple, and perhaps a bit boring. This is probably a good beer to chug while standing in the crowds in München, as it is crisp and very drinkable. It ends up being a decent amber beer, but I could probably get a domestic micro-amber for much less than the price of this."
"Amber Whiskey Color with a beautiful spongey head. I'm a sucker for rich malty aromas, and this has a great one. Medium-bodied malt flavor nothing too grand, but this is extraordinarily drinkable. Pretty average mouthfeel. Overall this is the best Oktoberfest beer I've tried."
"Not bad, but not what I had expected from the world's most widely-consumed Oktoberfest beer."
"I would call this a quite average Oktoberfest. Maybe my taste buds are getting saturated tonight. I would certainly rather drink Ayinger for this seasonal."
"Clear, medium amber color with a cream-colored bubbly head that dissipated pretty quickly to a thin film. Smell was sweet malt. Taste was initially slightly sweet, but not too sweet. Malty with roasted grain and a little carmel flavor. Followed by a nice, grassy hop flavor with just the barest touch of bitterness. Clean finish with almost no aftertaste. Medium body. Very nice overall. Would be really easy to throw back a number of these!"
"It pours a clear copper color. It has a malty aroma with some hop character. The smooth body has some light toasted maltiness. It finishes with some noble hops. It has a little too much hop character for a Marzen, but the toasty malt character is easy drinking and tasty."
"I have grown more accustomed to the marzen style. This version seemed a bit bready smelling which is nice but had a strong Eurograin presence. I suspect the sweetness is the caramel hopping. The finish is slightly biscuity and dry. Not a bad beer but not quite the quality of Hacker-Pschorr Ocktoberfest."
"This beer poured a slightly foggy dark amber color, and smelled fairly sweet, with just a hint of clover honey. Smooth body with just a brief tingling feeling left on the tongue. As for the taste, it is sweet and malty, almost cidery. After the initial flavor dies down, a thick, hoppy aftertaste follows, leaving tones of alcohol on the taste-buds. This was the first Marzen beer I've tasted, but if it's any indication of the style, I'll be sure to try many more next Fall."
"Reddish copper body with a small, off-white head. Smells of cookie dough malt, tobacco and slight fruitiness. Taste: starts off with cookie dough malts, apple cider, toast, and light hops. Finish is slightly bitter with lingering medicinal malts and alcohol. Medium body. I'm not a big Marzen fan, but I really liked this one. Nice work Paulaner."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thin white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It is creamy with a bit of sweet malts. The taste is good. Again, it's malty with a creamy finish. It is slightly bitter, but highly enjoyable. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great fest beer. It is highly drinkable; one of the best I've had."
"Drinkability  After drinking the Skagit River Oktoberfest (that almost made me barf) this was a pleasure. I would have liked to have seen a little more refinement in the grain but otherwise this was a hit."
"Tatses like a good O-fest should with lots of toasted nut flavor and just a hint of sweetness. Mildly hopped. Mouthfeel and body are dead middle of the road. I could drink this all night long."
"Bright, clear ruby red, with a thin sheet-like head, stringy carbonation. A big malty and toasty aroma. Sweet malts noted on top, caramel like and very creamy. Noble hops extremely noticeable in the body, seem to overpower the initial malt-based body. Some delicate spicy offerings, yet a crisp, clean palate. A definite quaffable marzen, has great character, also serves as a good session brew. One to search for in the early fall."
"Good stuff, only down point is it didn't stand up to food to well, but thats fine, happy to drink it one its own."
"Mouthfeel: I noticed a lot of carbonation. Decent mouthfeel. Just a little on the watery side."
"Appearance: Amber copper tone with a nice sized off white head doesn't last all that long but does leave behind some pleasantly strewn lacing around my glass. Aroma: Robust caramel roasts with slightly toasted nuts even seems a bit spicy not bad. Taste: Finishes very clean but the toasted malt character gives it a great flavor doesn't overdo anything very reserved but hella drinkable. Mouthfeel: A bit thin the only thing I can say I'm disappointed about here just seems watery I even recall the original Munich formula having more body but hey sturdy carbonation excellent O-fest. Drinkability: By far one of the better Ofests outta of Germany I enjoyed it from beginning to end, gonna buy a case next year."
"Paulaner was the first beer garden I vistited during last year's fest where I could find a seat. I'll always remember they were the first to bring me a liter."
"Thanks to aaronh for this sample...otherwise, would have missed this one. Amongst the best of the Munich Oktoberfests, a decent beer and one I'd have again."
"Good, though not really my style. Still it's excellent with food, Brats especially, and very drinkable."
"Poured a maple/bronze colour with an almost non-existant head. Lovely malt/sweet/spice smell which was also reflected in the taste as it is sweet and spicy as well. Almost reminicent of maple syrup (in after taste, not potency of sugar or consistency, of course). Very lightweight mouthfeel with almost negligible amounts of carbonation. I don't see how anyone could dis-like this, it's brilliant! Easily one of my favourites!"
"Overall it is just too sweet and I did not think it feels very good."
"On draught at Spagio in Grandview. This beer is copper-colored with a medium light beige head. Minimal lacing. The aroma is lightly malty with some caramel as well. Medium-bodied, and not overly sweet like some Marzens tend to be, which I appreciated. Good malt flavor that was not too thick or syrupy. As a matter of fact it was very drinkable and complemented my food well. Maybe not the best example of the style, but I'd get it again."
"12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a light copper color with half a finger of head. There is only a tiny bit of lacing. The smell is malty and grassy with a bit of hops. The taste is fairly grassy with a little bit of caramel. The mouthfeel is fairly good, and so is the drinkability. A pretty good Oktoberfest."
"Overall Impression: Clean well made beer. I get an earthy taste in a good way, and malt malt malt. A classic Oktoberfest."
"The beer came out only slightly darker than gold under a good thick off-white head with lots of lace and excellent retention. Plenty of malt filled the nose, while the mouth was prickly, with a body just slightly on the light side of medium. There was lots and lots of malt in the opening taste, chased by a bit of hops that left a nice bitter aftertaste. On the initial taste, I noted just a hint of sourness, but this disappeared as I got further into the experience. A good drinking beer, I'd happily have another."
"Once poured many, many agitated bubbles rise to create a frothy yet soapy head. A nice dark golden colour that is very transparent. The nose is similar to Paulaners Weiss bier with caramel apricot notes. Roasted scents are released as it warms. This one coats the tongue with malt. Nice bier, yet not my favorite of the Paulaner line."
"Taste: Rich roasted malt and grains that glides to caramel then to hops. Nice an chewy, with a good punch of carbonation. Finishes very clean with a slight hop and spice to it. Wonderfully balanced and increadibly easy to drink. One of my favorites of the season."
"This beer was a solid amber color, had a strong fragrant sweet malt aroma, strong carmelly malty taste that seemed to lose these features quickly.Seemed to me a perfect beer if you are a smoker, you get quick initial bursts of flavor, then you enjoy your smoke."
"This beer came in a 12oz bottle. Poured a very interesting amber color with a decent head that didn't stick around too long. The aroma was very sweet and promising with caramel malts being the forerunner. The flavor was not as I expected from the smell. The caramel malt is the strongest part of the flavor, but there is a certain bitterness that I did not like with this one. The bitter bite makes me give it low marks for drinkability and mouthfeel."
"John"
"This Oktoberfest brew as expected pours a deep orange amber color. Theres a small light tan head that doesnt last very long. The aroma is of nice sweet malts, caramel notes with bready grains. Some mild hops are also on the nose. The start is smooth with a creamy mouthfeel and a decent amount of carbonation. The malt adds a foundation to this brew that holds everything together from start to finish. The carbonation picks up a bit towards the middle when a little yeasty breadiness comes through. Theres a nice crispness to this brew. Some slightly bitter hops come are apparent in the fairly short finish, but the aftertaste doesnt last very long. Malts are still noticeable through the finish and into the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium, but seems to feel a little thicker into the finish. Very drinkable brew."
"If only it was October year round, I wouldn't have to wade through disappointing Hefe Weizens to get to a beer like this. Very nice rust colored brown, head goes away quickly. Flavors are very hard to discern. Tastes like smokey oranges, for lack of a better term. Paulaner is definetly at the top of it's craft."
"I don't know what I can add about this classic, but I can say that I like it. Well constructed, easy to drink, tasteful with a clean finish. Sweet and spicy malt flavors come through primarily with a touch of hops for dryness. Nothing sloppy about this beer. Good show!"
"A clear sparkling bronze brew with good head retention and lace. An initial sweet carmel malt that ends with a hint ot toastiness. Enough hop bitterness and some length to make this fest quite balanced and hence drinkable. Can see this as having some session possiblities. My third Fest so far and the best of the three."
"Another Oktoberfest. Soon it will be time for the winter seasonals. Anyway, pours a orange/red amber with a taut white head. Smells of caramel malts and some leafy hops. Not as sweet smelling as other Marzens. Taste is mild with caramel malts, with a mellow sweet undertone and hops on the finish. Not as sweet as other Octoberfest beers and pretty tasty."
"This is the gold standard of Oktoberfest beers."
"and as I said very drinkable all the way."
"Ouch! I remember this being much better (and much more substantial). Nice, reddish hue, but head disappears quickly, little lace. Stunningly thin mouthfeel, quite watery. I remebered this beer being creamier and maltier. Maybe Paulaner is being ""dumbed down"" as some have suggested. I was so disappointed, I couldn't drink two. Reminded me of a Yuengling lager, in a way. Some mild hoppiness and bite, but almost too little to notice. Where is the malt?! Not really bad, but just too thin and mild. I hope I can find a better Octoberfest before the season is over."
"I was eager to try this beer on tap and it did not disappoint at all. Nice deep caramel color with a nice creamy tan head that left some nice lacing in the mug. Aroma is subtle and mostly sweet. A nice caramel sweetness and light toasted malts dominate the taste. The toasty/roasty notes come out more as the beer warms up and really make for an enjoyable Oktoberfest beer. A light to medium body provides for a high drinkability and helps when quaffing a liter at a time : )."
"Medium body and carbonation with a smooth, clean malty aftertaste. Nicely balanced, highly drinkable beer that I perceive to be the benchmark for the style amongst those available in the U.S."
"One of the sweeter and hoppier märzens I've had. I'm starting to notice a phantom alcoholic flavor and more and more toasted malt as I reach the bottom of the glass. The carbonation makes its presence known in a very good way. A very sweet and very solid Oktoberfest. I wish that parade of beer maids would march out of the label and into my living room."
"Not sure how long I would enjoy the acrid kind of aftertaste, but it's an easy sixer to take care of, and more enjoyable than the Hofbrau Octoberfest."
"Terriffic example of the style. Only slightly chilled, the beer produces a thin, verys table dull-white head. Nice lace, and a beautiful, clear, dark, copperish-amber color. Aroma is almost aall toasted malts. Taste is sweet and malty with a lot of bread-like doughiness. Clean, slightly chewy, and all-around wonderful."
"Still, the brew to beat in the Octoberfest/Marzen/Vienna Lager genre is Great Lakes Elliot Ness."
"pours a lovely orange with good clarity and a nice lace. smells nice and malty, sweet and a little doughy. the taste is of malt, caramel and a nice light hop touch. sweet and bread like, wonderful. perfect carbonation and a smooth texture round out a great beer. oh so drinkable, lovely beer."
"Perhaps one of the best brews I've tasted thus far this fall, but there are plenty more to go."
"Beer has a nice toasted bread and malt aroma. Taste is equally yummy. Definite toasted malt sweetness , You also get a bit of caramel and a nice subdued hop/pine taste. Clear use of quality ingredients. Beer is smooth and carbonation seems to be perfectly calibrated for the style. Easy to drink and went great with the thuringer and kraut I had. Another beer I was lucky enough to sample at the Munich Oktoberfest and one that travels well to the states."
"The taste is a wonderfully tasty mix of slightly toasty malt sweetness, light tea-like astringency and a flowery and bitter hop prescence all blending towards a deliciously balanced and lingering finish. As of now, my top German O-fest...reccomended."
"This version was served through the jockey box at Ludwigs Oktoberfest street party. Poured a very attractive copper amber orange with a thinning white head. This is one of my favorite fest beers that Ive tried. Its sweet, malty and very smooth. There are some definite spicy notes, almost peppery - with a bit of citrus tang. Lagered perfectly. Beautiful melding of the malt and hops into a very smooth and a very drinkable product, and at the same time retains some of its spicy and distinctive character. Excellent."
"Pours pure clear amber, with a large tan head that mostly diminishes and leaves little lace. Aroma of caramel and toasted grains. Flavor starts sweet with caramel, some hints of toasted bread, and a bit of smoke squeezing in at the end. Medium body, super easy to drink - a truly great fest beer."
"Notes: Definitely a top-notch Festbier. A must try for fans of the style."
"Ive been enjoying Paulaner OFests for the past 10 years, and this year (2003), for the first time, I seem to notice a difference. Less sweet, hoppier and a bit more alcohol kick. It pours a deep dark amber and holds a thin beige head. A sweet caramel sweet malt and hop aroma lasts for a while, then fades. The malty body is creamy and sweet, with toffee and honey flavors. The hops have a lime-like bitterness and mild spiciness. Slightly astringent and some noticeable alcohol, which lasts throughout. The slick, creamy, oily liquidity is representative of Oktoberfest beers. This years Paulaner seems to be a bit more intense than pervious years versions. Bring on fall!"
"Dark gold color, large head (foamy) malty aroma. A medium bodied marzen. Mild malts, slightly sweet. Some hoppyness. Mild flavor. Smooth and mild taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. It a nice Oktoberfest -Marzen. Nice but nothing special."
"A deep copper color that produced a sizable head which shrunk to nothing very quickly. Aroma is a malty nutty one with a sweetness and a slight roasty aroma as well. Mouthfeel is smooth with ample carbonation. Flavor is malty and sweet with a dryness at the finish. There is no retention here at all. Nothing. Dissapointing for Paulaner."
"A small, creamy/tan, noisy, foamy head sits on a clear, dark, amber/brown body. Sweet toffee and chocolate in the nose. Tangy toffee at first. Not as sweet as I expected. Then chocolate and malty caramel. Finish is disappearing when cold, but the toffee and chocolate are still there. This is a fine beer. It's dark tasting, but light bodied until it warms. That's when it really matures: it sweetens and gets breadier. Much better. Fantastic."
"I have always considered this a really good example of a ""fest"" beer and jump on it when its out.Pours a nice deep copper color with a pretty nice medium head,aroma is slightly malty and toasted but faint.The taste is on the sweeter side with some doughy flavors with a light hoppiness to keep it from getting to sweet.Real nice beer look for it if you like th style."
"Nice coppery appearance with a decent head that dissipated slowly. Light malty-hoppy aroma with an interesting taste. Initially it felt light, but then the hops kicked in to give it a nice crispness that lasted well and left a pleasing aftertaste. Mouthfeel likewise was initially light, then more robust.. a bit like a mild explosion. Easy and pleasing to drink, especially the aftertaste."
"I tried the Paulaner Oktoberfest Marzen yesterday on the recommendation of my local package store owner while staring at the case of many Oktoberfest beers to choose from. I think I made the right choice. The Paulaner is a nice dark amber/brown, minimal white head, nose of very sweet malt and autumn fruit with a hint of pumpkin pie. Body is hearty and chock full of sweet malt flavor, with a pronounced hop presence following that backs off quickly. Lingering flavors of pumpkin spice, raisins, and other unidentifiable spice make this a very worthy Oktoberfest beer. Highly drinkable, this is a good amber to savor a few pints of..."

"My first Octoberfest beer of the season. A decent beer which has piqued my curiosity about the style."
"Poured a glowing transparent bronze with gold at the edges. Had a soft head of even thin foam, patchy lace, but nice bits of stain. Smelled of malt with a moderate sweetness, brought to a better level with an addition of small amounts of both caramel and grainy types of roasted notes. Tasted of barely sweet amber malt, an easy middle of moderate roastiness, and a good bit of quality bitterness at the end made of a beautiful blend of toast and lemon flavors. Finish was surprisingly short given the strong bitter near the end. Very fresh and appetizing, it had a fair mouthfeel for this session styled beer, though such a concern is mostly an afterthought with a beer like this - which is a good thing. You expect a balanced but full 'o-fest' from such a good brewery, and you get it - a definite leader in the category."
"Notes: Look and smell superior to the overall taste package. Would have preferred a slightly punchier malt presence, but an enjoyable drink nonetheless."
"Another Paulaner winner! This is another of their products tyhat scores highly and consistently in every category. The red amber body carries a cream colored head, but it does not leave quite as much lace as the head would predict. Nonetheless it is able and willing to please. The nose is of malt, mostly caramelly and with slight toasted hints. The flavor is deliciously built on the nice carmel malt base and has distinct crispness added to the full and smooth body. Definitely drinkable!"
"I love the label, and the web site is hilarious, but this is not my favorite from this brewery. Copper colored, and topped with an off-white head. Fruity smell, of sweet pear and honey. Flavor is sweet, consisting of light malt and honey. Mouthfeel is watery, but there is a tingle on the tip of the tongue. Dry finish with an offputting metallic aftertaste."
"This beer poured a head with large bubbles. The body was clear and the hue was amber. There was good lacing on the sides of my glass with this beer. A mild aftertaste was observed with this beer.I enjoyed this brew due to its very sweet aroma and I found it to be smooth tasting which is very much to my liking unlike those brews that taste like strong coffee.This is a brew that I would enjoy drinking all night at a bar or party."
"This one has been dubbed the #1 oktoberfest in the world, cant say too much to back that up because the only other one ive had is sam adams. It was in a nice 1 gallon keg can. A pretty dark syrup-colored beer, i liked the taste. Fairly spicy, with a nice level of maltyness to it. Something i will have again."
"This was the Fire Sale beer at the Flying Saucer. I have to say this was the best Fire Sale in a long time. The draught Octoberfest poured a clear rich amber with a pretty good head. The head left a lot of lace on the side of the glass. I had just finished a Young's Oatmeal Stout, but the maltiness in the aroma and particularly in the taste was well formed enough to stand up to the Young's. The flavor was excellent. The only thing I mark this beer down for was it mouthfeel. I tought it had a very light mouthfeel and certainly no creaminess. This is a good beer bordering on a very good beer. I would recommend anyone trying this draught beer when they have a chance."
"I liked the label. It said it all, with those women marching down the street. It poured a nice darker yellow color. The taste was pure malt, but not a bad taste. It was rather refreshing to have a overwhelming malt taste like this, and not be repulsed like drinking a malt liquier. I enjoyed this beer."
"Color is clear amber with golden yellow tones around the edge and bottom, some white head that left patchy lace, but flatened out quickly. Smell is faint roasty malt with a hint of spicy dry hop. Flavor is good, but man, there was no real punch, I give it the benefit of the doubt, but it seemed very empty in the malt, it wasn't very easy to swallow for some reason. It has a sweetish malt that seemed a little pushed or something, maybe under cooked? Not sure what it was, but it sure bothered me. The feel too, was empty and watery, it has a drying quality but seemed to light to me. It was OK, I so wanted more from this, it was a letdown."
"This is my first Marzen so I did not know what to expect..if they are all like this I like em!"
"This was my first time with this beer, and I will probably steer clear of it from now on. It's not offensive, just not great."
"Very nice aroma! Mild and non-offensive. It poured a nice frothy head with a mixture of medium and fine bubbles like I expect for a good German brew. it's body was a very pretty dark brown/amber color very clear in it's consistency. The head soon died off though leaving a nice lacing around the rim of my glass. It tasted a little of carbonation with a slight after taste, but all in all a very mild smooth brew. One I could sit and drink all night long."
"A well balanced Fest beer. Maltier than most which I enjoy and very smooth and refreshing. The amber colro along with th smell of hops in the nose is an excellent coupling with the malty finish and the alcohol is low enough to be hughly drinkable I think around 5.8% So grab a pretzel and a wurst and enjoy this delicious Oktoberfest beer."
"I recall a print ad where a cartoon duck embraces a bottle to declare ""we go great together"". This probably matches any meal well. Quite nice."
"very pleasant all-in-all, doubtless a very drinkable one- year round even."
"This marzen amber poured an orange amber color with no head or lace. That was the bad side of it. The smell of roasted malts was very inviting to the next step of tasting. The taste was of roasted malts and a slight bitterness that was well balanced to make this beer complete. A little bitter but smooth on the finish that made this beer pleasant enough to drink again and again and again!"
"Pours a clear and bright orange amber color with a bubbly white head. Nose is fresh grass and grains with some floral hops in the background. Sweet malts and lightly toasted grains are present in the taste with hints of caramel and a nice balance of bitter hops. Very nice full feel in the mouth with a crisp finish. This is one of the best Oktoberfests on the market."
"Clear brown in color with an off white head. One of the best Oktoberfests that I have ever had. The smell is sweet and malty, as it should be. The taste is much the same, sweet and malty. Crisp, clean and refreshing. The ending is dry with a hint of caramel. This is a beer that I could have many of and would really like to sample this on tap at Oktoberfest."
"Nice clear brown-amber color, decent white head, malty caremel aroma, sweet malty caremel roasty flavor, medium body, some musty flavors, a good Oktoberfest, I think its the only one avalible year round."
"Pours with an amber color. Smells of malt and caramel. The taste delivers much of what the aroma forecasts. For some reason I think of walnut flavor and aroma when I drink this. This would fit in well for drinking a few pints at Oktoberfest. Sweet, light and easily drinkable. I think for this style the rating would be more like a 4.5. Although there are Vienna style lagers or other Oktoberfests that are close. This might be a good bridge beer for some who are only used to pilsners."
"Poured a clear amber with a nice head that retreated to about 1/4 inch after a couple of minutes. Subtle toasted malt aroma with a hint of caramel. Sweet middle followed a mild malt finish. Dryness prevalent in the finish. Body seemed a bit watery for an Oktoberfest, but overall a fine brew."
"Not too bad from the mini-keg, I'd get this again for sure when it comes around again next September."
"Bottle labelled as an ""ale"" ?  Strange to me, must be a regulatory thing and not accurate.  Also, found 07/03 on the label.  Assuming that is a best before date."
"Fantastic achievement."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce brown glass Euro longneck bottle. Served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Pours a nice clear brown, the head is beige in color, vast in size, oodles of lace that last till the end of the glass. Aroma of the malt and the brewers art are in the nose, clean and fresh. Start is sweet, the middle light, the finish is fastidiously hopped, temperately acidic, the aftertaste dry and pleasant. A beer I look forward to every fall, as with several other ""Oktoberfest Marzen's."
"Pours with a nice white head on a copper body.  The aroma is fabulous, with sweet floral smells and a hint of spices reminiscent of nutmeg.  The head leaves a light lace on the glass.  The flavor is very rewarding.  Sweetness balanced wonderfully by hop bitterness.   This is my favorite O'fest by far.  It feels good from the time you take the first sip to till you finish the last drink, which could be sevral hours and several beers down the road.  Definitely need a case of this next year.  Finally an Oktoberfest beer that I don't feel the need to compromise flavor or aroma for drinkability."
"this one goes in my personal top ten.  best o-fest.  clear dark amber....medium head and minimal lace. aroma to die for... munich malts....hints of spice...yum...hints of floral hop....tastes absolutely delicious, smooth velvety mouthfeel.  oh baby what a beer.  i'm not a huge fan of the marzen-oktoberfest style but this brew transcends all styles and should be respected as a classic."
"Great looking rich copper color. Foamy, rich, light tan head. Great rich bready smell, sweet toffee aromas also bounce around. Very very inviting pleasing smell. Taste is very balanced, yummy sweet carmel malt, everything that is expected. Nice hop bubbles yeild a super bitter bite in the middle, especially on bigger sips. Medium bodied, very drinkable. Great with hearty fall meals or as a treat alone. Very good for the style, a really good beer."
"Nice color, sandy-looking head. Aroma is sweet malt and the flavor is nice malty, caramelly and sweet. Mouthfeel has surprising body to it. There are some esters to the flavor or maybe I'm picking up something else."
"Copper red/orange body topped with a one-inch solid off-white head. But it does disipate too quickly. Malt sweetness dominates nose, but there is a touch of herbal hoppiness. There is a good earthiness to the taste. Wonderful caramel snap as it first hits the tongue. While malt is the dominate aspect, it has a depth of taste beyond being simply sweet. While the hops are secondary, they achieve a good balance. Overall, goes down easily but memorably.Year after year, one of my favorite imports."
"Copper color with thin head. Delectable aroma with hints of cedar and smoke. Malts are fine, substantial, and a little bit raw which is part of the appeal. Hops don't give much dryness or kick in the finish, but what they offer is true perfection in terms of spiciness. Said spiciness is the true draw of a marzen, in my book. This has it in spades. While the malts are sweet and sticky, this beer is actually quite light to drink and could be offered to more trepidatious, less experienced beer tasters. Be absolutely certain to let it warm up. You are doing yourself an injustice if you drink it too cool. This is the quintessential Oktoberfest beer for me. Maybe not the highest marks but it is the most utilitarian."
"Paulaner Oktoberfest Märzen Amber draft is drinkable in the extreme. This is one fine beer! dieses ist ein feines Bier!"
"Clear, deep amber with an orange cast, topped by a cream colored head that holds well and leaves some decent lace. The aroma is of lightly toasted Vienna malts. The body is medium with a standard carbonation level. The flavor is richly toasty backed by a brisk bitterness. It has a bready quality that is not unlike the almost burnt crust. As it warms in the mouth some dark toffee notes are revealed, only to be quickly ushered away by a spicy hop flavor. There is an underlying fruitiness that includes some apple, grape, and plum. The finish is dry with a lightly lingering spicy hop. Very well balanced, alternating between a lightly sweet malt and a crisp bitterness. Refreshing and highly drinkable."
"All in all, this O-Fest is tops in my book!"
"My favorite Fest so far this year. Great color, orange, amber with hints of red. Good head, fades, but laces well. Sweet smell in the aroma and taste, caramel, almost candy. Slight hops noted in the finish, as well as a big malt taste. Truely a great example of the style, obviously, they've been doing this for a long time. My bartender was puzzled, because I kept with the same beer for more than two."
"A consistently great example of the Marzen style."
"Amber-orange color with a nice white head that stays around for several minutes, then almost disappears. Sweet caramel and toasty biscuit malt aroma with spicy hops. As for the taste, very sweet caramel malt flavors are balanced well by the hops and the carbonation. Toasted biscuity malt in the background and in the aftertaste. Spicy and crisp hop bitterness is present, especially in the back, which is very nice. Tastes almost like a mini-doppelbock. Great mouthfeel from the carbonation. Excellent märzen! I can't wait to have another. The only thing it needs is better head retention."
"This is an Octoberfest that could surely improve my impression of the style. Lovely amber color with a dense, creamy head. Roasted malt, nutty and a surprisingly fruity aroma and flavor. Fresh tasting with vibrant but appropriate carbonation. I was wishing for a liter sized mug of this, my favorite so far, of the O'fest offerings. Prosit!"
"I'm confused that it says ""Ale"" on the bottle...It doesn't taste like an ale to me, but who knows.."
"A treat that can be quaffed as easily as it can be savored.  Break out the big-ass 3L mugs.  It is that time of year."
"Known as the #1 oktoberfest and I can see why. Beautiful amber color and off white head that leaves a nice lace. An explosion of taste as this beers enters the mouth. Sweet caramel with a nice hop bite."
"This beer is a clear copper color.  A thin beige head sits on top of it.  It has a nice malty nose.  Pretty clean taste.  About medium to full in body .  Toasted malt seems to be the dominant taste.  Husky grains are apparant as well.  One aspect is a bit disappointing on the pallate.  A slight off-flavor. A bad bitterness coupled with a slightly soapy aftertaste.  It isn't overbearing, but definitely there.  This is the second german octoberfest I've been a bit disappointed in this year."
"Pours a clear amber color with a decent tanish head that sinks a little too quickly.  Smell has a nice toasty, slightly husky malt aroma to it with some nice noble hop aroma as well.  great toasty malt flavors are almost perfectly balanced by the excellent low level bitterness provided by the hops.  The brew has just enough body and is rather smooth and very drinkable.  This is probably my favorite so far for this years Marzens."
"Tis the season for Oktoberfest brews and this is my first of 2002.  Pours with a golden orange color and a frothy head that leaves but a lace on the glass.  The aroma of bready German malts also has a hint of candy sugar.  The smooth body supports a lightly sweet bready flavor with a bold, sharp hop profile creating a very nice balance.  Very tasty."
"I will start right out and admit that this is one of my all-time favorite beers.  It is a gorgeous pour with a nice amber color topped with a creamy head,  The aroma is malt dominated with a warm caramel aroma lingering above the hop spiciness.  The tast is why I love this beer, a full explosive malt flavor dominated with rich caramel and subtle hops spiciness lingering in the mouth. When the first hints of fall are in the air, I could come back to this rich and flavorfull beer again and again.  Now if only I could sample the Paulaner Oktoberfest in Germany!"
"a good oktober, but i remember it being much better last year out of the pint bottle. a nice amber pour. moves on to a slightly bitter brew that is smooth and a good drinker. not the best oktober i have had, but it is a fine brew"
"Amber in color with moderate white head that lingers.  The aroma was spiced malt with some bread/yeast thrown in.  The taste however was spices, then malt, then more spices, with a dry finish.  It was smooth and creamy.  My first experience with a Marzen and I am excited for more."
"Aside from carbonation, flavors skip right past the foretaste into the mid-range, where the body shoots down the pipe and ester/phenols pan out sideways to let what little hops there are settle smartly in the middle, with a mild tartness.  Tartness lingers."
"Big head, amber to blonde colour.  Sweet malt aroma. Sweet start, with a slightly bitter hop bite on the finish. generally smooth, quite a bit of character, but it could lose a tad bit of sweetness, thats my only problem, but its kind of nit picking."
"This beer poured a reddish gold color and formed a white head that left some lace.  An aroma of malt and caramel.  The taste was of malt and caramel.  The finish was light with a little bit of tangy aspect.  A good beer."
"What can I say!  This brew smells and feels so damn good, I want to bathe in it...err...anyway, it tastes solid too.  I can only fantisize about this draught.  Do this, and do it again.  Cheers!"
"Pours a clear amber/caramel color with a 1 1/2 finger off-white head.  The smell is that of malty caramel and tastes also includes what the smell reveals along with mild hops with mellow carbonation.  Very well balanced.  This has a light-bodied but slightly creamy mouthfeel.Very drinkable.  Prosit!"
"Amber in color, this märzen has a creamy head and a big malt nose with light notes of toffee. Good toasted malt flavor with a smooth dry hop aftertaste. Medium-bodied and a little light for the style, but still very enjoyable."
"Pours a nice copper color with a decent sized creamy head. On the nose there are nice sweet aromas of toffee and caramel. On the palate the toffee and caramel can be tasted, light toasted bread, and rounds out well with the hops / adds a little spiciness to it. Overall this was a very enjoyable Ofestvery flavorful! Thanks againBierman9 & Artied2 for the trade!"
"A good beer, and a good representation of a Marzen."
"Very sweet/malty/spice nose. Deep amber in color. Sweet toasted malt flavor. A great representation of the style. Very smooth mouthfeel. I am not the biggest fan of this style... but this brew wins you over with almost nutty sweetness. On revision in 2003 I sensed a metalic nature to the finish. Still a nice solid marsen and I enjoy this style much more since my original review. The only change decreases the taste from a 4.5 to a 4."
"Bronze hue w/ excellent clarity.  The fluffy white head settles into a dense layer that's a bit thinner than other German brews.  Rich, toasty Munich malt and toffee aroma. Trace herbal hop nose.  Medium bodied w/ a very smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel.  Complex malt flavors abound in this brew.  Crystal malt sweetness, toasted Munich malt, and that oh so lovely decocted caramelized fruit note make for a tasty experience. The insubstantial hop bitterness serves only to prevent overbearing sweetness and does that well.  Finishes with a semi - dry honey - like sweetness. This widely available and fine brew is quite comparable to Spatens Octoberfest and definitely worth a try.  Think of it as a Salvator ""light."""
"All in all a great Oktoberfest beer.  Dark amber in color, malty smooth and slightly bitter taste.  Very easy to drink.  I've had it in bottles and in those little 2 1/2 gallon kegs and the little kegs were slightly better, maybe a little fresher when we tried one."
"62"
"The amber standard for a nice full and malty  Oktoberfest, I've never been let down by Paulaner...it defines the style though a few others are just as good in my mind...definite sense of toast rather than sweet malts, true to the style..."
"Very pleasing malty aroma.  Full somewhat creamy head that thins then becomes lacey. Bright and clear, with amber color.  Nice malt characteristics throughout, with slight roast and caramel taste.  Hops noted in its little dryness and taste slightly in finish, but never more than the malt.  Medium mouth feel with a grainy quality.  I've always considered this one of the better Oktoberfest beers."
"Ok, I like the flavor of this one and the blance was perfect but my overall impression is that the flavor intensity was low. It seems to me if they took the total flavor profile and cranked it up a notch or two it would kick ass. Now the one I had was a little old so I reserve the right to change my mind after I try a fresh one. When I do I will edit my review appropriately."
"Nicely  balanced beer.  Sweet"
"Pleasant, but a little on the sweet side."
