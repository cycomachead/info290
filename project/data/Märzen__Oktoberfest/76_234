3.89,-1.3,4,4.25,3.5,4.25,4,"500ml bottle. 04/15. Pours a bright, golden amber colour with a frothy, off white head which reduced to a collar and left a trace of lacing. Pleasantly malty aroma with a hint of grassy hops. Mildly sweet with a touch of bitterness in the finish. Smooth, medium bodied and quite easy to drink. Decent enough but didn't leave me craving more.","magpieken","Jan 04, 2015"

Taste begins with sweet caramel malt, followed by a toasted taste, ending dry with a slight floral hop bitterness to balance out the taste. The aftertaste has toasted malt and floral hop. Medium-light body, medium carbonation. Overall a very smooth and drinkable beer with nice flavor, I could easily have a couple more of these.","JTuomi","Oct 31, 2014"

4.34,10.2,4.75,3.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,"BBD 05/15 (Original Oktoberfest version).  Clear medium amber pour with just a touch of ruby.  Exceptional head, lacing and retention.  Light nose of biscuit with a touch of caramel and an almost imperceptible noble hop note.  Almost medium bodied with a nice almost creamy texture.  Above normal carbonation with a very good amount of effervescence on the finish.  The exceptional flavor profile is superbly balanced, complex and very flavorful (intensity).  It begins with an effervescent explosion of malt - mostly biscuit over a light caramel sweetness.  In the middle, a light hop bitterness and noble hop flavor predominate.  In the somewhat crisp finish as the bitterness fades, comes the final effervescent burst of lingering hop flavor.  This one just edged Ayinger out as my favorite import.","tillmac62","Oct 08, 2014"

Lots of sticky lacing is seen when sipped that sticks to the sides of the 'Texas Boot'. The aroma is of roasted malts, some spice, with a slight metallic/mineral aroma as well. The taste has even a bit more going on with some bready yeast and some caramel malts in the mix as well. Crisp and clean and goes down pretty easy and you don't taste the metallic / mineral aroma. Medium bodied with good carbonation as there are some large bubbles rising up  from the bottom and sides of the boot. Overall, a very good Oktoberfest brew.","BeerWithMike","Sep 27, 2014"

3.5,-11.2,,,,,,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was a solid example of a traditional Oktoberfest beer, it had most of the aspects that I look for in the style and everything seemed to be pretty inline with the style.  This beer had decent drinkability, it was smooth, fairly clean, crisp, not too filling and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention and I think two would be my limit, any more than that and the apple cider aspect might start to wear on me.  What I like the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was good and it was just what I expect from the style.  What I like the least about this beer was the apple cider aspect in the taste and aroma, I think I would like this beer a little more if it didn't have that.  I might buy this beer again when looking for a traditional Oktoberfest, but it's not something I'm going to keep my fridge stocked up and I would say it's worth a try, but I don't think it's a great example of the style.  All in all I thought this was a solid beer, but it was just slightly rough around the edges and I think if it was cleaned up just it little it would be a pretty good example of the style.  This wasn't my favorite Oktoberfest, but it's not a bad one and this beer made a decent first impression of this brewery and I would be interested in trying more of there beer.  Solid job guys, keep up the consistent work.","StoutHunter","Aug 30, 2014"

Caramel and toffee dominate the flavor too, with honey-like notes as well, and just enough herbal earthy hops to balance. On the heavier side of medium-bodied with moderate carbonation.

3.88,-1.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Somehow this O-Fest has eluded me for years. Not no more... It pours a clear tawny-amber topped by a finger of dusty cream foam. The nose comprises white bread, light caramel, light grass, and a very light touch of Belgian candi sugar. The taste follows this fairly closely, but the caramel is more pronounced, and a decent amount of mandarin orange finds its way in as well, providing a nice fruitiness to compliment the enhanced malt. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally smooth feel.

The best quality of the beer is its nice aroma of caramel malts, perfume hops and some dough. The flavor is similar to aroma, but much weaker. Finish is short and unremarkable. The body is medium and crisp. OK Octoberfest but there are much better choices.","mikeg67","Dec 08, 2010"

Letting it warm just a little brings out more flavor, but the beer also becomes rough and less drinkable. While there is nothing truly offensive about it, this one is just not going to get me dancin' the polka.","SickGnar","Nov 28, 2010"
3.98,1,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Artful look: Huge, billowy, cottony and milk-foamy porcelain-hued head - blankets of lacing - in stark contrast to the deep, dark reddish-brown color below. The aroma is like no other O-Fest in the lot - fresh, clean spearmint/wintergreen mixed with some faintly toasty, crystal-sweet malt. Makes me think of alpine winter - snow-capped mountains, skiers in colorful wool hats, twinkling X-mas lights. The flavor is equally bizarre: toasted malt sweetness - nearly nougaty - with those refreshing minty/herbaceous qualities, a vaguely licorice (Mike N Ike) tone, finishing with powdered bubblegum first, developing quick into a malt liquor spice in the way after. The drinking is lovely smooth, ending dry. Quite a lot going on here - unique, to say the least.","Bouleboubier","Nov 25, 2010"

I really can't figure out how this could look better. The smell is slightly sour, slightly carmelly, with a touch of flowers and a slight metallic whiff. Taste is pleasantly mildly sour, balanced by an immediate slightly sweet maltiness. There is a slight sharpness to the finish that balances the rest out well.

Get it fresh and serve around 45 degrees. At this temp the flavor is amazing. The malt comes forward. My personal favorite fest beer. I've found the german styles of these beers to be a bit lighter and easier to session vs. most of the craft brewed versions. I love them all but this one seems hit the mark. Bullseye.

Just the right amount of carbonation. It smells like roasted munich malt and hallertau hops off the bat. It smells great. Next, I take a sip and it has a nice roasted flavor with bready notes and a drying hop backblast. I picture it like a thick crusty bread in a glass. The mouthfeel is sharp and drying yet thirstquenching all at the same time. It is very well balanced. Drinkability is simply phenominal.

Probably one of the best Oktoberfests I've had this year. Its similar to the Samuel Adams Octoberfest but with just a bit more hops.

Remarkably clear, as if buffed into a high polish, the color of an older copper penny, more zinc at the glass bottom, there's a few loosely gathered bubbles inside. Dry, crisp nose of clove, ginger root, rye bread, barley, dried orange peels, offers more green leafiness than malty sweetness, pinch of apricot, apple, peach fruit, extremely understated and saying that may be an understatement. Light to medium-bodied, equally dry here with an energetic spring to its step, bready with baking spices, just not indulgently sweet. Orange and lemon citrus close to giving a mineral water feel, metallic at times. The carbonation has a good, tighter weave, keeps it off the tongue. Honey and molasses accents help it a good deal, substitute for clear malt flavors. Light apple, apricot, red cherry fruit. A very refreshing beer that, if you don't mind some sourness, is easily poundable.","farrago","Sep 24, 2010"

Flavors are a mild, typical marzen with a pale malt backbone and a very slight hop presence in the end finishing it. Slightly butterscotch-ish/caramel-like character . These qualities are all fairly moderate-to-light though, and you have to look a bit for them. The mouth is on the lighter side of full-bodied with carbonation that isn't too assertive.

Fits the style of a Marzen / Oktoberfest. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, yeast cleanliness, slight grass, and hints of roasted malt in the finish. Overall, a smooth a drinkable beer. The sweetness level is not too high either.

Initially I tasted a great sweet flavour followed by a bit of biscuit flavours; as expected, the lager bit is at the end, but it's pretty subtle.

The color is maybe a little darker and a little less vibrant than I like my Oktoberfests but still very good. The aroma is like mellow, unsweetened cornbread. Medium mouthfeel. I like it heavy and Munich saturated and this is a little less extreme. The taste is, like most other aspects of the beer, malty and moderate. Well balanced Munich, Pils, and Vienna.. well maybe unbalanced towards the Pils side. It's like a Pils painted Oktoberfest colors. Interesting hop profile working with the sweetness- just enough bitterness to create a little play between the two. My only issue is that I like my Oktoberfests thick and malty like you're swimming in a mash tun filled with Munich malt in Bamberg and this takes it a little easy. Unfortunately, Oktoberfests are like my heroin- I had a Sam Adams Oktoberfest a couple years ago and it blew my mind.

The nose has a hazelnut and caramel malt aroma that is nice but should be stronger. Delicious taste, full of caramel and a hint of chocolate, with a fine nutty finish. Smooth and good, I was concerned that the beer would be too soda-like after the foamy pour, but the carbonation was more restrained while never flat. Eminently drinkable, this is a Marzen I would consider somewhat inferior to Samuel Adams's version. However, this is still solid, delicious, and a fine representative of the style.

The flavor shines though, I think I must love vienna malt grain (is that what's in here) silky smooth, some vanilla, bready... awesome. I figure the hop presence has been subdued to just a minerally flavor and feel because of the time it took from bottling to pouring. But I just love oktoberfest beers. Suggested.

None the less, it had a modest aroma that nicely combined a mild maltiness with a sharper grassy quality. This beer felt a bit dead, but there was a fine carbonation present to give it some life and it worked well with the spicey wheat and malt notes that came through. Very easy to drink but again, this one was probably just flat so it seemed a bit watery.

The mouthfeel is very nice and smooth with the drinkibility to last alll day....what it was brewed to do. The Paulaner version is very similar in appearance, with a slightly larger head, and also in aroma, but a slightly stronger smell.

It pours a beautiful clear coppery amber color. There is a small white head that vanishes quickly and no lacing on the glass. One notices a slight grassy smell that is echoed in the taste, along with a mild caramel flavor. The mouthfeel is watery and thin. I suppose that, if one is to drink liter mugs, something along the line of this is preferable to a richer beer, but I prefer a smaller serving of something I would actually enjoy.

Tastes much the same with a viscosity that confirms the bready / yeasty characters. Sweetness is consistant and firm along with a light estery / fruity flavor that was not present in the nose. Hopped for a good balance that still weighs on the malt side. Medium and full in the mouth with a growing bread and caramel flavor and feel.

Pours a medium copper with a small, white, foamy head that quickly diminishes to a very thin film, and leaves only a light, stringy lacing. The aroma is malt-dominant, of course, with sweet caramel, molasses and doughy bread aromas, but theres a nice mild hop aroma as well which adds an herbal and floral complexity to it. The taste follows suit by being nicely balanced. Too often, beers of this style become all about the malt with the hops staying too hidden, but this beer allows the hop presence to be known just enough to create the balance. A small, spicy zing leads you into to a wonderful, full, toasted, bready malty flavor and the finish introduces some light floral hops to take the edge off the sweet caramel and molasses. Theres a light citrus in there too that comes out late in the finish. Probably one of the best oktoberfests Ive had this year. A wonderful fall beer.","ski271","Oct 25, 2005"

The hops are earthy and just enough bitterness to balance the sweet character. The mouthfeel of this fall offerieng is clean and smooth, but not over-heavy.

The aroma of sweet malted grain greets you first, then a bit of molasses, crisp and clean, a treat for the eyes and the nose, start is quite sweet, thickly malt with the top middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is lenient in its acidity, the hops pleasantly mild in their spiciness, dry and lingering aftertaste, quite a quaffable brew tis true.","Gusler","Sep 17, 2003"

4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours bright orange amber in color with a thin and bubbly white head that quickly fades into a ring around the sides of the glass. Nose is sweet lightly toasted malts and grains with a bit of caramel. The same toasted malts and grains come through in the flavor up front with a bit of an herbal, tea-like quality. Finish is crisp with some mild spicy hops and a touch of sweet caramel. One of the better Oktoberfests on the market today.","Morris729","Jan 21, 2003"
4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Amber color, with a lacey, tannish head. Highly aromatic : spicy, cloves, cinnamon, herbal. Malty, but not overmuch. Some sweetness, but, again, just enough. Delicate hop, solid body, slight sharpness and a coppery edge in the mouthfeel. Very delicious.","feloniousmonk","Jan 19, 2003"
4.2,6.6,4,4,4,4,5,"Bright copper-penny amber, topped by a healthy foamy off-white head. A big whiff of fresh bread accompanies the bottle opening, and then the pour. Then the aroma is much more caramel. Like a proper Octoberfest, the taste is overtly malty, but there is a nice hop zip around the edges. Not syrupy in taste or texture. A bit lighter than many Octoberfests, this could make an exceptional cross-over beer. My Bud drinking father-in-law loves it, and my sister-in-law who doesn't drink beer tasted one and liked it.","RonfromJersey","Dec 21, 2002"
4.5,14.2,4,4,5,4,4.5,"I find this one hard to describe. It is just cleaner and crisper in taste with a truly mastered blend of malt and hops. This is the best seasonal Oktoberfest I have had this year. Find it - buy it and drink it. Cherish it. The nose and taste combine to give you a true calgon moment. you can just feel the stress of the day evaporate with the first swallow. I enjoy this one so much I prefer it in a snifter style glass instead of a pilsner style. This really allow for the head to collect and the bouquet to collect so you really savor every attribute of this fine beer.","AtrumAnimus","Dec 17, 2002"
3.86,-2,4,3,4,4,4.5,"Dark amber as was expected with this style. Head was good and decent lacing ringed the glass. This brew was not very aromatic, but then what lagers are? Taste was a little hoppier than I expected or have experienced from this type of brew. Still the nice slightly sweet malty base made this a very drinkable brew. Could easily quaff a few if in the mood.","Mark","Dec 01, 2002"

Smooth and sweet carmale malt opens the beer up.  Much sweeter and stronger caramel qualities than most of the others of the style I've tried.  Very smooth and almost creamy and not cloying or sticky, a big plus considering the increased caramel flavors.  Excellent bier and it is definitely duking it out with the Brooklyn Ofest as far as my favorite so far this year.","Murph","Oct 08, 2002"
3.95,0.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"This Oktoberfest poured an auburn-orange with a compact, dense off-white head.  Solid head retention.  The nose had a wonderful mixture of spice (apples & cinnamon), sweet malt, and some hops.  I was happy to see that the nose matched the flavors flawlessly.  This Oktoberfest has qualities that make it unique and able to standout from a crowded pack.  Overall it is very tasty and very drinkable!","bditty187","Oct 06, 2002"
4.4,11.7,4,4,4.5,4,5,"Had the draft version at the Oktoberfest in Munich and it is much different than the bottle version we get here in the states. First off it is much lighter in color - closer to a Helles color. The creamy head piles up high and lasts forever. Smells a little cleaner - meaning less maltier than the bottle version. Taste is much cleaner also with less of the caramel flavors, but is a little sweeter and softer. Much easier to drink since I was able to drink about 5 liters in a session while hungover from the night before. It makes you feel real good. Suggest eating  a big ass soft pretzle with it.","Longstaff","Oct 01, 2002"
3.81,-3.3,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Dark copper hue, w/ brilliant clarity from the lagering.  Ivory white head leaves sparse lace.  Soft, lightly toasty Munich and toffeeish malt nose, w/ a hint of caramelized fruit melanoidins in aroma. Trace herbal hop nose.  Nutty sweetness upfront in flavor, followed a smooth, drying wave of toasty Munich.  Sweetness derived from caramel malt reemerges mid palate, and is partially offset by hop bitterness, lending a balanced, crisp nature to this brew.  Moderate bodied, w/ a agreeably smooth mouthfeel that helps facilitate excellent drinkability.  Finishes lightly sweet w/ Munich malt briefly lingering.  Although a touch shy in depth of malt profile, the pleasant sweetness and overall balance makes this a very quaffable oktoberfest.  Enjoyable.","marc77","Sep 28, 2002"
4.52,14.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Clear, copper in color with an off-white head that drops shortly but leaves a good collar and some very nice lace. The aroma is of Vienna malt: lightly sweet, toasty, and rich! There are some minimal background hops. The body is light-medium with a moderate carbonation and a smooth & creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is of a fresh, "juicy", Vienna malt with a gentle toasty quality, a light caramel note, and a present-but-not-imposing alcohol. Extremely well balanced with a light hop flavor, and an underlying bitterness for support. The finish is semi-dry with a gently lingering toasted malt note. Absolutely brilliant! Easily one of the best Oktoberfest beers available. In my book, in the top 3 with Paulaner and Spaten!","NeroFiddled","Sep 26, 2002"

Aroma has subtle malty aspects (caramel, buttered cinnamon bread). The taste is also dominated by maltiness, but it's subtle, not syrupy-sweet. In fact, it's rather pleasant in its subtlety. Some mild hop flavors, mostly floral. And although I don't know what the abv is, I can tell you it's pretty low, making for an imminently drinkable festive session beer.","mophie","Sep 10, 2002"
