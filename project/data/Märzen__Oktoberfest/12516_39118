4.1,7.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into dimpled mug, 2014 release. Pours fairly hazy deep orange/copper color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, brown sugar, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/bready malt and light earthy hop flavors; with no cloying sweetness after the finish. Very clean malt flavors with minimal yeast esters present. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Oktoberfest style. All around great robustness, balance, and complexity of clean dark/bready malt and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 16, 2014"

It's ultra-rich maltiness and all its notions of walnut cake and nutty pastry that accompany it, are irresistible, especially when placed inside such a quaffable, easy-to-chug-back lager frame. After the iconic German brands, this is an obvious one to recommend. In fact, it's a new personal favourite.","biegaman","Oct 22, 2014"

The flavor profile is laid back, as a marzen should be. It has a very nice balance of caramel malt sweetness and flavor with just a hint of hop bitterness. The carbonation yields a crisp finish identical to the flavor profile. Thirsty Dog is becoming one of my favorite breweries.

Big sweetness and big syrupy body, some nobel hops, but not as pronouced, fairly reserved and could of been fresher. The abv% of 6.0 seems a bit higher then the norm, not unexpected from the heavy handed malt body. Still some toastiness, just a bigger, fuller american version, somewhat tasty by itself. I rated this per my expectations vs an true german style counterpart, some may like a fuller version in much less quantity to which i would say give it a try, not a bad tasting beer, just an offshoot american bastardization.","beerthulhu","Nov 04, 2013"

Some will be opposed to the sweet flavors, but keep in mind that this is a Marzen, and the malt needs to shine over the hops (and it does). What we got is really nice complexity, with bread, fruit and raisin flavors. The alcohol is expertly and dangerously concealed, and the mouthfeel is spot on, with medium carbonation and thickness and an impressively clean finish given the sweetness in the taste. There are a lot of Oktoberfest/Marzen beers out this time of year that don't impress. This is one of those beers that manages to be both well thought out and nicely executed.","DeFaz","Sep 06, 2013"

4.03,5.5,3.5,3,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall I thought this was a damn good American version of a Marzen. This beer was all about the malts and had just the right amount of toast to it along with a nice nutty flavor. This beer was really drinkable, just how it should be, I would have no problem polishing off a six pack of this on a nice fall night, one of the most drinkable Marzens I have ever had, this beer doesn't last long in my glass. What I liked most about this beer was the flavor and the drinkability, it was all about the malts and they imparted a really good flavor that made me keep wanting to take another drink. What I liked least about this beer was the aroma and the carbonation, the aroma was a little weak and wasn't too interesting, and the carbonation would have better suited this beer if it was bumped up to medium. I am kinda bummed that I found out about this beer at the end of the Oktoberfest season, had I known about this beer earlier it would have been in my fridge for all of September and October, I will make sure not to forget about this beer next year. I highly recommend trying this beer when looking for a good Marzen, it's a great American version of what a Marzen is all about. This beer is up there with their Tripel as one of my favorite beer from Thirsty Dog, I have only tried three of their beers but so far I have been happy with every single one of them so there's no doubt that I will be trying more of their beers. Thirsty Dog did a great job at making a sessionable and tasty Marzen that I find to be better then Samuel Adams Oktoberfest, it takes a lot to knock that beer out of the top of my favorite Oktoberfests but this beer brought the heat and I enjoyed drinking every drop of it, this is my new favorite Marzen.","StoutHunter","Nov 01, 2011"
3.97,3.9,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours brownish orange with a half-finger of fizzy head. Smells malty with some subtle caramel. The initial taste is malty sweetness, but that is backed by a bitter hop finish. This beer has a good hearty flavor that should be enjoyed by a fire on crisp fall days.","57md","Oct 26, 2011"
3.7,-3.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall not bad, typical American Oktoberfest with reddish caramel malts and syrupy flavors, a bit of a decent lager flavor and just a hint of hops that could use more of.","jlindros","Oct 25, 2011"

3.27,-14.4,2.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"o - pretty enjoyable, but kinda lacking for the style. if it weren't for the lager yeast, i'd say this is like drinking a carmel apple. not sure i would buy it again, but if you're looking for a malt bomb, don't pass this up.","divineaudio","Oct 05, 2011"

3.15,-17.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Hmmm. I've had this on tap before and thought it better than this. Too sweet for my tastes; I'd prefer the more tried-and-true Brooklyn I just finished reviewing (and dissing for its ordinariness) as a more classic example of the style.","TheHoppiest","Sep 13, 2011"
3.11,-18.6,4,3,3,3.5,3,"O- As far as Oktoberfest beers there are much better options. A little boozy for the style and the flavor is a little too earthy and medicinal. I wish more biscuit or nutty qualities were present in this beer.","Hoptometrist","Sep 13, 2011"
3.5,-8.4,4,4,3,4,3.5,"O: Good beer for this time of year. Style-wise, I was hoping more malts would shine through, it seems a little meek. I was looking forward to more caramel/toffee/toasted nuts flavor. Its pretty easy to drink and sessionable though.","sdsurfer217","Sep 12, 2011"
4.27,11.8,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Just a fantastic octoberfest in the flavor department. Bursnting with juicy melted caramel, and toffee. Butterscotch flavors very malty and cereal ridden. Full of fresh baked sweet breads with just enough hop to balance and keep things from being cloying. Thick, creamy, with good carbonation. Just delicious.","mcallister","Sep 06, 2011"
4.05,6,4,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall I welcome the style and they did a very good job representing it. If I could get it cheaper than 3 dollars a bottle (18 dollar sixer) I could enjoy it more. Damn Thirsty Dog is pricey here.","DrDemento456","Aug 23, 2011"

3.97,3.9,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Standard Oktoberfest pour. Copper/amber is appearance with pearl white head. Loses points for lack of head and retention. Aroma full of malts... caramel, grains, toffee and actually a decent amount of coffee, which I found very unusual. Nice smell though. Taste follows the nose. Good amount of caramel malts, bready flavor, toffee and yes, the coffee flavor carries over. A little bit of grassy hops finishes out the beer.","uustal","Nov 10, 2010"
3.63,-5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured into a pokal a deep bronze with a half finger white head,the color was quite deep for the style.Aromas of caramel,sweet dough,and light splash of herbal/spicy hop,pretty standard palate with caramel and toasted grain the main components,light herb in the finish.Not a bad O-fest lager but pretty mainstream compared to alot of better ones out there.","oberon","Nov 10, 2010"
3.77,-1.3,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with a light, crisp body and an almost watery feel. Quite drinkable and easy to put down; a very good Octoberfest that is sweeter than most, but to me was a good aspect of this beer.","CHickman","Nov 06, 2010"

3.47,-9.2,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pretty copper. Still. Nothing-head. Smells of toasty unidentifiable malts... maybe German, maybe not... almost a pumpkin note, buttery toasty-bread sweetgrain here, very small amount of bittering hop... taste follows... an easy, no-frills no surprises Ofest. Finish is lingering toasty malt (good), a little dry bitters and a hint of red apple esters. Mouthfeel is dry-crisp-fizzy and fine, is actually a lot drier than expected... interesting. Finish is much more fruity than it ""should"" be and reminds me, bizarrely, of Lost Abbey Lost & Found. Drinks okay. Would drink if this were local, but it's not German and seems like it uses an odd yeast. Worth a shot if you like the style.","kkipple","Oct 27, 2010"
3.85,0.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured an apple juice type color with no head to speak of. There was also no carbonation at all rising. Aroma was malty, slightly sour, with trace hints of wheat/grains. Taste was mellow, started off malty and grainy, just like it smelled, but not in a bad way. A bit of bitterness formed after lingering in the mouth. It felt good in the mouth, there was carbonation on the toungue despite none being evident in the beer, and it coated well. Good to drink, it was well balanced a fairly solid oktoberfest.","mountdew1","Oct 25, 2010"
3.38,-11.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Overall: Decent beer. Bitterness is a little too high for this style. With all of the other good Oktoberfests on the market, it would be hard for me to choose this one.","rlshep","Oct 07, 2010"
3.65,-4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a crystal clear copper amber hue with a bright off white head, forms thick lacing around the glass as it dwindles. Aroma caramel malts, earthy/spicy hops will imbibe and report back sensations. A spicy hop background upfront caramel malts/nutty tones as well, this is solid maybe a touch of diacetyl (butter). Have no fear it doesn't hurt the flavor profile it's not offensive for me, but I'm not sensitive to that flavor. Only offense for me is overall sweetness it hits the super malty profile without hitting me with enough herbal spicy qualities to balance things out. Mouthfeel is creamy assertively carbonated, not thin not heavy or cloying. Drinkability overall is alright a bottle wasn't bad but this style is meant to be drank by the liter and this version doesn't justify that portion size.","WVbeergeek","Oct 04, 2010"
3.8,-0.5,4,4,3.5,4,4,"A straightforward interpretation of the style. Caramel malt-forward, some moderate grain notes. Finish was a rather pungent quinine bitterness that was out of place in the style. I've noted others complaining of butterscotch notes, but my bottles have none, so perhaps a bit of quality control at the brewery? The label art with the dogs howling at the moon was an amusing touch.","Brent","Oct 04, 2010"
3.98,4.2,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Picked up a single at Abe's Cold Beer. I wasn't sure what to expect, but this turned out to be a very tasty lager. It was a little too toasty for the style (though I won't short it for that) with smooth mellow bread and hint of caramel. The only knock is a mild touch of diacetyl in the aroma. Still, I'd be happy to have a stein full of this Oktoberfest any time.","tempest","Oct 04, 2010"
1.39,-63.6,2.5,1,1.5,2,1,"There was almost certainly some sort of diacetyl problem going on here, but it was so far gone that the brewery should have caught this.

4.12,7.9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"On to the beer.. pours a pretty, light amber with carb-o-plenty. A thick head soon turns into a lacy ring, typical of this style. Smells phenomenal, yeasty and sweet and toasty. Taste starts with more of a bitter tip than other marzens, which I like, all the while balanced very well with toasted malt. Finishes bitter, and sorta sticky, but not too bad. Feel is nicely carbed and dense. Just a fine-drinking marzen, and a great representative of the style. Excellent.","sixerofelixir","Sep 08, 2010"

Should this be possible in an Oktoberfest lager? Taste is rather carmely followed by a fruitiness. Very little hop flavor or bitterness. Medium body and low carbonation. Overall, I am not sure about the fruitiness in this beer. It is not bad, but does not seem to fit the style. It also seems to cut back on the drinkability. Overall, not bad, but does not seem to fit. There are several others rthat are better.","Bierguy5","Sep 25, 2004"
