3.9,8,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 2/8/2013. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of caramel, pear, apple, bread, toast, toffee, floral, light citrus, and herbal hops. Very nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity. Taste of caramel, toast, bread, pear, apple, toffee, floral, light pepper, and herbal hops. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, toast, toffee, bread, floral, and herbal hops on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of malty flavors that are fairly robust; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and moderately creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Oktoberfest. Nice balance of fairly robust malty flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering; and nice example of the style as well.","superspak","Dec 01, 2012"

Good mix, didn't weight you down and the carbonation didn't pull the beer from your tongue. Taste was dominated by the toasty caramel malts. There was a touch of orange peel, and a hint of bitterness to round the taste out, but nothing getting in the way of the reserved and simply drinkable taste. Pretty above average in every way.

It even looks like a maibock, in color - a light yellowy-amber with a faint haze. Looks pretty flat, as far as carbonation. There's some maltiness to the aroma, but there's also some uncharacteristic hoppiness and spiciness as well. As far as the nature of the spiciness, it's a toss-up between whether or not it's derived from the yeast (which could be lending the fruity notes, too) or from the specialty grain. The malt in the flavor, once again, having a rye bent to it, and body is of moderate concentration. The apparent deficit of CO2, in the form of visual foam and bubbles, as previously noted, can be detected as well in the smooth, yet surprisingly watery feel. Ya, boring.

3.85,6.6,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a 12oz bottle with no freshness date. It was colored a dark honey color and poured a thin but nice head.It was fairly light bodied and had a spicy flavor to it, which I quite enjoyed. Along with the spice flavor, malt was there and subtle. A very drinkable Oktoberfest selection.","AChamberlain","Sep 27, 2006"
3.36,-6.9,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,4,"One of the better American "oktoberfest's" beers I have had yet...but not great. I would recommend this beer to others and I plan on looking for other Stoudt beers!","Magpie14","Sep 27, 2006"
2.3,-36.3,3,3,2,3,1.5,"This was a disappointment. Looked good with a light amber color, very modest head, but good carbonation. Initial impression was okay, just something I wouldn't want another of. After that it was all downhill, taste was dismal and left an alltogether unpleasant aftertaste.","techdiver","Sep 24, 2006"
3.93,8.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"This Oktoberfest is a great example of the style. Of the ones I've tried this year, this one hits closest to the mark of what I consider a great Marzen Oktoberfest. Plenty of body, good mouthfeel, and higher-than-average drinkability. Just the right amount of maltiness, and the hops are there, although not too present (right on style, IMO). And the aftertaste is nice and refreshing. Definitely the best Oktoberfest I've had this year.","afdempse","Sep 17, 2006"
3,-16.9,3,3,3,3,3,"Drinkability: Light and simple. So, you know, that's cool, if that's your thing. Me, I'll stick to other examples of the style or, better yet, Stoudt's other beers.","ChainGangGuy","Sep 11, 2006"
4.26,18,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"12 oz bottle, pours a gorgeous crystal clear copper with a nice white head that sticks around for a long while. Nose is caramel, grainy malt, and a slight vegetal note, nothing too impressive. The taste on the other hand is excellent, a nice full doughy malt, slightly nutty, with a nice gentle touch of hops to finish things out. So smooth and creamy, so delicious, so easy to drink. This is a suberb Oktoberfest, seek this one out if you can find it.","cubedbee","Sep 05, 2006"

Taste was the same. Tasted good but no distinguishing characteristics to set this beer apart from another. Mouthfeel was crisp and lively. Good carbonation. Overall this is an average beer. The only conisistent thought going through my head while I was drinking this was that it is fresh. Not impressed but not a bad beer. Would rather try another Oktoberfest than this one.","jtell","Oct 19, 2005"
3.49,-3.3,4.5,3,3.5,3,4,"Translucent copper color with lacy white foam. The head is thick with a soapy, porous texture. Some malt aromas can be detected, but faint and not much else. Alcohol and malt flavors are up-front with a dry malt, medium-bodied aftertaste. Some bitterness in the aftertaste but flavorful. Overall, this was an enjoyable Oktoberfest beer from a very good brewery; definitely worth a try.","jaluria","Sep 28, 2005"
3.22,-10.8,4,4.5,2.5,4,2.5,"Drinkability: This one has the potential to be a solid Oktoberfest beer, but unfourtunatly, it doesn't shine through like it should.

3.58,-0.8,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"One of the better O'fests I have tried so far this year. Poured a (dare I say?) orange hed brown. No head and it appears almost flat. But I still really liked the color of this beer. Nose is quite pleasanlty of just slightly toasted malts.Taste is simple and straightforward. Not lots of anything. Just some pleasant toasted grains. Hops just barely register. This is how I see an Oktoberfest tasting in Germany. Easily drinkable with some good friends as you sit around the table and chat. Unfortunately, my only negative about this beer is that it is fairly flat in the mouth.","MuddyFeet","Sep 16, 2005"
4.01,11.1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Drinkability is where this beer really shines. It's smooth and cool but hearty. It doesn't make you feel loaded down at all. I could definitely stand another. Will buy it again, may have people over for an evening of different brewery's Oktoberfests around mid-October, and this will definitely make an appearance.","veggiemafia","Sep 13, 2005"

3.7,2.5,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"12 oz Oktoberfest bottle as shown on the brewery website, purchased as a single at the Vintage Cellar. My first Festbier of the season. Pours a clear and glowing copper amber body with a khaki head that rises one finger. Good retention before falling into profuse patchy and sticky lace. Munich malt aroma has notes of molasses, maple syrup, and toffee. Spicy floral hops back up the sweet maltiness. Mouthfeel has a light medium body with appropriate medium carbonation. Taste is dominated by the same maltiness noted in the aroma. Munichesque notes of toffee, molasses, caramel, and a definite hint of maple syrup. Restrained, but adequate, presence of floral and spicy German hops. Very tasty, but heavyhanded with the sweet Munich malts. Just a bit too sweet for good drinkability.","merlin48","Beers"
4.47,23.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"As an aside, I believe this brew, in particular, needs a new listing as "Oktoberfest" if for no other reason than the fact that Stoudt's has brought the brewing of this Bier completely in house (not to be confused with its contract brewed bastard of a counterpart, Stoudt's Fest). In addition, Stoudt's will not be offering the Oktoberfest all year 'round, as they did with the Fest. The Oktoberfest, as it was explained to me, will only be available during the appropriate fall months.","goindownsouth","0"
