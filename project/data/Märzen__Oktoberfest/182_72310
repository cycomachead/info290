3.75,13,,,,,,"The Oktoberfest, however, falls short; but at least they've opted to go for more of a Vienna-style than just a malty-sweet golden "Festbier". The appearance is good, and the aroma is OK, but the flavor is lacking. There's some caramel to it, but overall the malt fails to display any depth of character. Some lively spicy hops bring it around a bit, and there is a touch of toasty sweet bread to it as well as a light fruitiness, but it still seems a bit threadbare overall.","NeroFiddled","Nov 17, 2014"

The taste is malty, with a slight hint of sweet fruit.  Pretty standard stuff.  Not much kick to this, but enjoyable nonetheless and can be purchased as a six pack for just about $7.  Fair alternative to some more pricier oktoberfests, but you get what you pay for.","oldirtycaffrey","Oct 21, 2014"

AROMA: bright, punchy (almost medicinal? band aid?) malts that do not distinguish themselves positively...PALATE: thinning, mouth-quenching consistency; surprisingly active at the teeth, denoting some hop presence...TASTE: doughy bread malts mesh with bittering hops to produce an ESB of sorts; a flattened profile as the glass drains--toasted cereal lacks the malt punch or sweetness that elevates better marzens...

Or 2 bombers of brauerei aying marzen for exactly the same. I respect folks buying their weekend sixer of yuengling rather than buying any AB/ Bud/ Bud light, but the truth is.. There are too many damn good beer makers personally known myself for me to call this my favorite brewer. While my appreciation is there, my Wallot will not always be. This experience actually made me appreciate what Great Lakes sends down my way and trust me, Ive bought enough GLBC o-fest to take care of my marzen fix for fall 2012.

The mouthfeel was terrific though as it flowed smoothly down, no weird aftertaste and just the right amount of carbonation. A good representation of the Marzen style and hopefully they continue next year as this was a decent entry.

A sharp, bitter hop character from middle to end. Bitter flavor tapers quickly allowing the sweet maltiness to shine through again at the finish.
