Light nose of biscuit with caramel notes over a light herbal/floral hop aroma.  Medium bodied with a nice slick texture.  Above normal carbonation with a good bit of effervescence in the middle and on the finish.  The flavor profile is reasonably intense, somewhat complex and well balanced.  It begins with toasty biscuit malt then flows into a mild caramel sweetness.  The middle is slightly bitter with a nutty/spicy note.  The finish is a bit crisp and leaves you with a lingering toasted grainy note.  A good Oktoberfest.","tillmac62","Nov 25, 2014"

Unfortunately once the head burns away, so does the aroma, leaving almost nothing. The taste is adequate, but not terribly interesting. It lacks both the robust malt or the counter-balancing hops. There's a decent weight to the body but a bit too much carbonation. Somewhere between OK and good.","delta490","Sep 15, 2014"

3.9,9.9,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Flying Dog Dogtoberfest pours a polished amber, lightening a bit around the edges. I feel as though clarity could be just a little bit better though for a German style lager. Maybe two fingers of cream colored head crowns the beer and manages to stick around for a minute or two. Lacing is a bit spotty though. The nose has some nice malt aromas, though I think it could stand to have a bit less caramel and more bread/biscuit character. The flavor profile delivers on that, it's much more biscuity, with just a little bit of caramel. Unfortunately the malt aspect passes altogether too quickly, making room for a soft bitterness and an earthy, lightly spicy hoppy finish. The body does a marvelous job of staying light and crisp despite the malt presence in the beer, and the carbonation adds just a bit of life to the beer. Great mouthfeel all around. It's not quite perfect, But Flying Dog's rendition of a marzen is one of the better beers from them that I've had.","axeman9182","Dec 15, 2012"

The middle is of a strong caramel, tofee character and makes this beer a sweet one. The finish is a combination of the above and makes this beer a very drinkable, medium bodied brew.

Poured with very little head even though I got a little aggressive at the end as I saw weak head formation. Since this style doesn't mormally pour with a big head I wasn't too concerned. First couple sips were pretty good but the overly sweet malt characteristic started to poke through as the temp warmed up. We drank this beer with a few other domestic O'fests and we rated it last...Lakefront, Brooklyn and Schlafly's were all significantly better - and all of those are lagers. I usually like FlyingDog's beers (except for the IPA's) but this is one I can't recommend.","crenegar","Sep 17, 2012"

A healthy dose of roasted grains and toasted whole grain goodness implies more than a few malts in the mix. Some hop aromatics give an herbal sharpness. A faint note of butterscotch. Taste is solid. Quite malty with facets of butterscotch and caramelish toffee. Some toasted bread and a firm hops give a decidedly American finish that is crisp, dry, and clean.

Its sweet at first, followed by a caramel that is almost too much and takes a little away from the overall experience.

As opposed to the malty sweetness and faint hopiness that accompanies so many other October beers, this one brings to the table a great complexity. There is some grape musk yeastiness in the nose. And bitterness and ale like fruitiness on the tongue. The mouthfeel is just right- thick but leaving you wanting another drink- it's dryer than the style usually is, but that works really well for this beer.

Not much in the way of aroma. I can smell some malt, but not much, no hop character at all. The taste is good. Not the best Oktoberfest I've had but this beer is quite drinkable.

The taste is of a toasted malt, some earthy resin hop flavor, a bit nutty with a light honey/caramel sweetness. The feel is of a solid malt body, almost chewy, tingly carbonation, finishes with a light earthy bitterness. A nice malty marzen with a noticable hop presence. Perhaps on the hoppy side for a marzen.

It was rather thin, but the caramel is the most pronounced part. Behind that is a touch of a metallic tinge, some grape skin, some roasted notes, and a herbal hop bite in the finish.

Orange peel, toasted biscuits, light apricot and peach fruit, suggestion of ginger root, not the most expressive beer you'll sniff on. Light to medium-bodied, picks up weight as it moves forward through the palate. There's a sort of dulling bitterness to it, not crisp, which flattens the orange citrus, baking spice and herbal aspects. Breadiness fares a little better. Good plus level of carbonation.

As the beer starts to really warm and I get down past half-glass, the sweetness comes out. Lots of honey and caramel. Pretty complex for an American brew. Very smooth, just the right thickness, carbonation tickles my gums, really satisfying mouthfeel. This is a really, really good marzen- I'm surprised that it has as low of a rating as it does.

It has a sweet light caramel taste, with mild toasted tones like Vienna and perhaps some faint buscuity Victory malt. The hop flavor and bitterness in the aftertaste are just barely perceivable, but achive an acceptable balance. An odd fig/date taste appears with the slightly residual sweetness, but dissapears quickly enough to not become distracting.

The highlight is the quick tingle of carbonation and hops that dominate the middle through the end, with a nice residual aftertaste. The malt profile is a bit bland compared to most, but I do enjoy the crispness of it. Drinkability is excellent, being a session beer, but purists might want to avoid it. I've never been a fan of this brewery and this marzen indicates why.

Taste is a bit light as well, and takes on a somewhat watery thinness towards the finish (I found this also to be the case with their wheat beer). There's some nice caramelized malt flavors, but the maltiness doesn't come out as much as I'd like. This sort of reminds me of a maibock more than anything else. Hops are rather punchy, but kind of muddy things up with a dull and lingering bitterness. A bit of graininess is found in the flavor as well. Mouthfeel is a Tad thin yet still sticky.

Typical Marzen coppery colored amber, crystal clear with a frothy white finger of foamy head that slowly fades away to a whitish light ring of lace. Aroma is malty, sweet dark dried fruit, roasty grain and caramel. Taste is lighter than the smells lets on, a little watery in comparison to other O'fests I've sampled. Mainly characterized by a giant malty backbone with undertones of sweet toffee/caramel and the roasty malt aftertaste. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied with moderate carbonation, leads the light, smooth characteristics of this beer. Smooth and silky, goes down with the faintest drying roasty malt aftertaste. Drinkability is great, just a hair over 5% abv, and an appreciative yet not overbearing complexity make this a superb session brew.

3.25,-8.5,3,3,3,3.5,4,"Pours a medium amber color with a thin white head. Leaves a nice lacing down the glass. The aroma is not strong. What's there is very malty with a bread-like quality to it. The taste is not challenging to the palate. Malty and bready and slightly nutty. Very smooth. Decent mouthfeel. Extremely drinkable because there are no off tastes...there just aren't very many ""on"" tastes either. This is a crossover Oktoberfest that won't challenge your palate, though there is nothing wrong with it. I don't think I'd buy it for myself, but I'd drink a boatload of it if brought to a party.","Hagbard","Oct 23, 2005"

3.4,-4.2,4,4,3,3,3.5,"Pours nice amber color. Average head that dissipates quickly leaving thin cover. The aroma is very pleasant. Hops playing with sweet notes make for a nice seasonal, autumn smell. The taste disappointed me. Not enough flavor. The sweet caramel notes are there, but they are overpowered by bitterness. And it's not a nice hoppy, bitterness I look for in IPAs. It's harsh bitterness that sticks in the back of the mouth. Not my favorite Oktoberfest beer, but still quite decent.","ikats","Oct 11, 2005"

3.65,2.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a one finger light tan head over a crystal clear orange red-rust liquid. Smells malty sweet. Toasted grains and munich malt. Tastes sweet with chalky malt (maybe vienna) a little bit of dirty hop floral and a mild alcohol sting. The ending is wet sweet. It has a nice toasted grain character throughout. Pleasant, well balanced tasty. A little bit of sour becomes more prevalent near the bottom of the glass perhaps some phrnols from the toasted grain or maybe tannins. Md body and moderate carbonation.","mentor","Sep 26, 2005"

3.55,0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"A pretty good beer. The malt profile is quite true to style. the toasty, bready, light yeast anc caramel tones are modestly present in the nose and more so in the flavor. The hops throws it out of style. Overly agressive in the bittering and grassy flavors. Although I like it, it's just too much. However, it's what I expect from Flying Dog. A bit too dry and rusty in the finish. A nice beer for the season, but don't look at it as a traditional Oktoberfest","BEERchitect","Sep 20, 2005"

3.45,-2.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Ive been generally satisfied with this companys brews, but this one seems just a bit off the mark. Dogtoberfest pours as an amber-copper color with a clear, slight white head. Its certainly got a malty nose, but it doesnt have the bready-deepness that a good Oktoberfest provides. Taste is caramel and toast, with a touch of graininess. Moderate sweetness. Theres a bit more hops that I would expect, and they tip the balance (but not too much). Mouthfeel is soft and a little thin. Id call this a mid-tier Oktoberfest.","Suds","Jan 03, 2005"

2.68,-24.5,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,2,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle with a reddish/amber color. The aroma is a malty caramel with some scent of burnt sugar. The flavor on this beer took me by surprise in a bad way. The first thing that came to mind to describe the flavor is rotting fruit. Perhaps an apricot flavor, but that is a stretch. It really does have a pungent and sweet taste of spoiled or over-ripened fruits. The beer has pretty much no hop flavor whatsoever. Overall it is not a great beer and I will not be drinking it ever again.","BrewMaster","Nov 08, 2004"
3.33,-6.2,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Nice copper brew with a nice off white head that stays around for a while lots of bubbles rising too leaves a nice coating of lace, good looking beer. Aroma sweet malt heavy caramel coming thru light hops and spiceness if you search. Taste big on caramel not much on bready flavors, carbonation aids mouthfeel nice burst of sweet caramel malt followed by a let down finish lightly watery with a very light hop spice finish. First half taste is nice but finish just dies out for some reason. Mouthfeel good but finish is light. Drinkability is ok easy drinking but not the best oktoberfest around worth trying but don't think I would try again unless recipe changes. Flying Dog has a couple of really good beers the rest just seem mediocre, I had been wanted to try this finally found some.","mntlover","Nov 07, 2004"
3.13,-11.8,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"The beer dispenses from the 12-ounce brown bottle a luminous deep copper color with a monumental semi-creamy light tan head, that erodes ever so slowly leaving a fine velum like sheet of lace upon the glass. Nose is sweet malt, crisp and clean to the senses with the start sweet and nicely malt laden, the top is middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is stern in its acidity and the hops personable in their spiciness, the aftertaste quite dry and long lasting, a drinkable beer.","Gusler","Oct 30, 2004"

The body is kind of weak, with sweet malt and a little nuttiness and hops on the back end. The finish is mostly sweet with a light hops bitterness here and there. As with most of Flying Dogs beers, the elements are all there but the execution falls short.","Dogbrick","Oct 18, 2004"

It has a malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes slightly bitter, dry and fruity. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good Festbier.

Nice carmel malt flavor, with very little bitterness. Malt seems pretty deep and juicy. Light body with moderate carbonation. Overall, maybe a little rough, not as smooth as others, but more malt character. Pretty easy to drink. A good seasonal.","Bierguy5","Sep 29, 2004"

Lordy, not even 1/3 through, and I wonder what I'm going to do with the rest of this 6-pack...there's a lot missing here, a richer feel should really be taking place on the palate, but this one is a dullard, folks.
