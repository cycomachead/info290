"Bready aromas with a little hops. Pours brilliant orange gold under a very finely bubbled 1” white foam cap. Bread and malt seasoned with kettle sugars and traces of malt spice season the palate. Medium body and medium carbonation."

"Overall, not bad.  It's a bit on the sweeter side than many, but it has a robust enough hoppiness to counteract that."

"O- Nothing too special, it's a lighter Oktoberfest with decent flavours. Not a lot of complexity but for what it is, it's not terrible. [3.25]"

"Nice appearance. Golden brown and orange. Decent amount of flavor for an Oktoberfest. I’m not a big fan of Oktoberfests, but this one is decent."

"Taste is mealy and gross. Limp feel with some papery wet cardboard and flaccid waterlogged grains. Telltale off flavor of DMS, cooked vegetables. Aftertaste of some toasted malt, but it doesn't redeem the harsh unpleasantness of this beer. Waste of time, avoid this drainpour..."

"O. An enjoyable American marzen; nothing spectacular, but dry enough with some good hop/malt balance to warrant praise."
""
"Taste- Sweet malt with a bite of earthy spicy hops to balance it out. A light nuttiness with a good amount of bread and cracker. Finishes dry with a light spice and earthy note."

"Whaddaya mean Oktoberfest season is over!? This one pours a clear amber topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises lightly buttery biscuit, orange zest, and sweet flowers. The taste holds notes of orange zest, caramel, light toast, and a bit of grass. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly dry finish. Overall, a pretty nice little O-Fest, nothing crazy, but an eminently drinkable autumnal brew."

"Oktoberfest pours a dark brown clear color with hints of orange. There is a profound malty backbone aroma, that had hints of a brown sugar. The taste was well carbonated, and had a strong malty taste. Easy to drink, liked the carbonation, would grab another. Overall I found this a very good Marzen, full taste and very enjoyable."
"A very nice and very drinkable Oktoberfest, quafable even! The balanced mild flavoring would make this a great beer to pair with many foods."

"Pours a deep clear orange amber with a one and half off-white head which reduces to a thin foam film. A bit of lacing is present. Caramel malt, some mild grassy hops, bread dough, and mild apple on the nose. Opens with a solid caramel malt presence and fruit notes including mild apple and a bit of pear. Dries up on the finish with more caramel and toffee and grassy hops. On the heavier side of light bodied, slick with a touch of syrup. Adequate carbonation. Very enjoyable marzen."

"O - Oktoberfest is another damn deliciously malty lager from Capital. Toasted Vienna malt and understated, balancing hops give the beer a tasty, classic flavor that could go down by the liter. The aroma gets lost from the poor head retention, but this one makes up for it in flavor."

"D/O: This is a traditional, full-flavored marzen that does not look to step outside familiar terrain. Its mid-range abv and malt-centered flavors are palate-friendly, promising to play nicely alongside savory foods, or in them as an ingredient."
"overall a lackluster attempt at a popular lager style by a brewery that i thought has a solid reputation for brewing solid lager beers. i'm surprised that this is %5.5 ABV. drinks much lighter than that. wouldn't revisit this. good thing i have only one bottle."
"Okay, so I like this beer (and most offerings from Capital) BUT do you ever think that most Capital beers taste about the same? I realize I am not a top notch beer taste tester but it seems like this was almost the same beer as their Summerfest and it wasn't much different than their Winter Skal which I had right after finishing an Oktoberfest. I guess if I really had to discriminate, this one was a little bit heavier and spicier than the Summerfest."
"Overall, I have had this beer on-top, from growlers and from the bottle. It is a great session beer and I although the components in and of themselves are not incredible, the beer as a whole is very good."
"Overall - Drinkable and light, but not otherwise especially distinctive. I'd much rather something a little more flavorful than this for the descending gloom of a Wisconsin autumn."
"O: This is an okay beer. Nothing spectacular but worth trying."
"O=There are better ones out there...way above Leinie's, but just below Point's in terms of flavor."
"Drinkability: It is nothing spectacular, but I suppose I would guzzle it if the polka was loud enough."
"Notes: Slightly thin and moderate in body. This beer is solid, and quite drinkable. However, it's not quite what I look for in the style. Decent, and at least worth a try."
"Fairly standard oktoberfest here, clean and simple. Pours a translucent amber/orange with a 1 finger head. Toasted malt aroma, yeasty, a small amount of apple. Taste is bready, toasty, malt forward, caramel and yeast, finishes clean. Mouth feel is fairly average, smooth medium body with zesty carbonation."
"O) A pretty solid Marzen offering. It's worth an Autumn tasting."
"Its Fanatsy Draft and the Oktober Fest beers are in full force. The capital brewery oktoberfest is is a good beer!!!! The appearance is a rich copper/amber. Very thin head...if any that is not lacing. The smell has some sweet maltiness to it, the tast definitely has a sweetness. The mouthfeel is very smoot and easily could be sessioned. Certainly worth a try for all those Okto fans."
"This is a fairly average Oktoberfest, a bit disappointing considering the brewery it's coming from. With a number of other German breweries to choose from, this one doesn't really stand out over any and distinguish itself."
"Reviewed on: 08-31-2009 18:06:54"
"Bitter and harsh feeling at times with too much of yeasty presence as well, this O-Fest really left me disappointed. Especially considering the brewery that made it. Now I did like the body on this, as it at least kept things crisp and smooth but the profiles here just needed some cleaning up. Not sure if I just got an off bottle or what. I'd be willing to give this another go sometime down the road."
"It drinks fine, the alcohol doesn't make itself known. The problem is that there really isn't enough flavor to cause me to pick it up again."
"D: This was a nice one to try among the many Marzens this season, but nothing that I would get in larger quantities than a single brew."
"Taste is some light biscuit malt and a very mild amount of caramel and toffee. Pretty plain. There are some light earthy and floral characteristics in the background. Light creamy character. The feel is a bit light with moderate carbonation. This is a nice and simple beer without any flaws, though I wouldn't go out of my way to try it again."
"Thanks to florida9 for this one. I poured from a bottle to sa perfect pint glass, clear copper pour with a sticky 2 inch white head. Lots of bready malt on the nose. The flavor is bready, and sweet with a lingering bitterness. Full in body and well carbonated. A typical marzen, very enjoyable."
"Overall, after trying the wheat beer from Capitol Brewery (didn't like it), I'm very impressed and would drink again. Might even stop by the brewery (at UW now, the brewery is a short drive away!)"
"D: Not a classic, but a tasty rendition of an Oktoberfest."
"This bier is a medium copper color and is crystal clear. It has very little carbonation and the head vanishes quickly. The aroma and taste are nicely malted, sweet, and uncomplicated. They have a great flavor indicative to the style without a bunch of other notes thrown, just straight yummy goodness. Very smooth with the right amount of flavor lingering. A MUST repeat."
"D: This beer is easy to drink but I'm wondering if I got a leaky bottle because it seems extremely low in carbonation and the slick mouthfeel is almost as if it's going flat. I like the beer and it's drinkable, just not sure this is what it's supposed to be but I'm willing to try it again."
"D: Pretty much a standard Oktoberfest. Nothing spectacular, but a decent drinking beer. If you like the style, you'll like this beer."
"pours a clear copper color with a quick dissipating head a beige collar and lacing ..smell is malts grain spices and hops a little caramel and some roasted flavors ..taste is much the same its malts both sweet and roasted with some hops some spice in there...mouth feel is lighter then most OF but it had flavor..not the best OF but it held its own it was drinkable but alas forgettable also with lots of OF to choose from ..try it though"
"D: This beer is very drinkable, I think it is a nice example of the style, best Oktoberfest I have had this year."
"d 3.5 had the hacker o'fest earlier today, and i think i will probably ultimately prefer that one to capital's offering. yet is this one worth trying? absolutely, particularly if you want a hoppy take on the style."
"Drinkability: One of the better Marzens out there, although style wise it leans a little closer to a bitter Vienna. More than solid Autumn brew."
"One of the best domestic O'fests and up there with the best German styles for my money."
"Pours a clear, amber color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of slight roasted malt, sweet malt, hops, and yeast. Fits the style of a Marzen/Oktoberfest. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, yeast, and sweet malt. Overall, a decent oktoberfest with a good blend."
"toastycaramel flavors up front and a tasteful hop prickle at the finish. good carbonation tailed with this bitterness to provide some texture to a very quaffable and slick brew. the hop flavor contribution is very nice: balanced yet assertive, and tasty overall"
"D: Good. I would be interested in another and maybe a sixer if nothing else could be had."
"The mouthfeel definitely felt a tad thin and watery. I felt the flavors were well done, but the overall texture of the beer leaned towards watery, which was a bit of a turn off."
"Overall it is another solid Oktoberfest Beer, somewhere in the middle of the pack."
"The body is closer to moderate than light. Would like more depth here but still good. Carbonation is light but helps with the sweetness into the finish. Overall a limited O-fest. I know my preferences are usually more of Munich style O-fest so I will try not to skew this to badly. Very nice yeast character though."
"Still, very good beer. Highly drinkable and worth buying more."
"The beer is medium bodied with medium carbonaton and a creamy and smooth mouthfeel."
"D: The low alcohol is a big redeeming factor. There are other O-fests that I'd take first, but it were the only thing left in the fridge I wouldn't be disappointed."
"The palate opens with plenty of sweetness, more than I care for. Bready and sweet with sugar, brown sugar and fruit character (plums and raisins). The finish is a semi-dry, with a mild bitterness . Hop character is a bit lower than it need be, and the malt sweetness is overdone. Medium in body with high carbonation and a sweetish finish that's not the best. While I have no problems drinking this, I hoped for more from this brewery."
"I've been on a Oktoberfest kick since there's an ass load of them coming out right now so here's another. It pours an amber orange color. Fairly clear with a decent inch of off white head. A smattering of lace is left behind. The nose is malty with a hint of spice. Maybe a touch of hops if you sniff real hard. I'm starting to realize American Oktoberfest beers don't have a huge boquet on them. The flavor is pleasant. Malt and caramel with some hop bite and mild sweet fruit that hangs in there at the end. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Yet another decent offering from Capital. Not exactly a head turner but, a easily drinkable session beer for the masses."
"glad i rereviewed this beer since it taste so much better fresh"
"It has a light malty, well balanced flavor. Nothing less should be expected from a Capital lager. The mouth feel was a little watery for me but still good. A well done oktoberfest that is easy to drink."
"Enjoyable, would definitely get this again."
"D - This is a pretty solid Oktoberfest. Very easy drinking and sessionable."
"D - The beer is pretty smooth and rather easy to drink. I could have a few in a sitting."
"D- Would make a great session beer."
"Man, I thought these guys could do no wrong with the lagers, but this baby is sub-par. The aroma reminds me more of a strong Euro lager for the unpleasant lager tang smell. The flavor is a bit better and at least finishes with a pleasant, subtle hop bitter, but for the most part the malts come on too strong and hot. The end result is unpleasant and I hope whatever's going on with this beer gets fixed."
"Beer pours a light amber color with virtually no head. It really doesn't give off that much aromas. Really have to get a good sniff to notice some caramel and hints of fruits. I taste caramel and breads initially, but after a few sips I notice plenty of spices. This would not be described as a full-flavored octo, which makes it fairly drinkable. Mouthfeel is relatively thin."
"HV"
"Because of the low carbonation i would probably be able to drink a few of these in a sitting."
"D- This beer has some nice malt flavors with a few off notes like the twang hint and the nougat that both start to grow as the beer warms a bit."
"A decent Oktoberfest a bit different than normal."
"Crystal clear amber in color with average off white head that didn't last long. Nice citrusy aroma. Flavor was more malty than hoppy with a slight alcohol warming as it went down. Great tasting beer. Medium/heavy body with average carbonation. Very drinkable."
"D - I like a little more stank on my beers, but this is a serviceable average O-Fest that I can imagine is very popular for the casual beer drinker. I might introduce my Bud Light loving dad and brother to this easy going brew. Nothing about this one is bad...it's just underpowered and a bit boring, to be honest."
"but it does make it a little more assertive. Good- get some if you can."
"Spicy raw cut of hops and resinous vine in the aroma, quaff is a bit on the thin side without a major flavor player and the body also is a bit weak. Seems to be a decent octo brew, just in need of a stronger hop finish. Good for a couple to try, but I'll stick with the local Missouri Octos in the future."
"This is my first beer report, I love this site, and I will continue to contribute my opinions on many great beers."
"A great session beer!"
"Easy enough drinking but overall a boring example of an Oktoberfest."
"Very drinkable and refreshing. It went well with my dinner of brats and asparagus."
"Capital Oktoberfest poured a light amber, very orange looking color. Small head. Smell was strong of hops, and bit of malt. Taste was sweet caramel and malt upfront followed by a mild hop bite. It became sweeter as it warmed. Mouthfeel was ok, bit light for what I like in a O-fest. Drinkability is very good, easy to drink a few. Overall a pretty good O-fest from a great brewery."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable Oktoberfest; not the best out there, but still a decent oktoberfest. I normally don't like Capital brews, but this may be the best one I've tried yet."
"Aroma is a bit too delicate, but this could be just mer; I like more ""in your face"" aromas. It still shows toasted malts, which open to a relatively light beer, predominantly malty but with some intervening hops. Clean, reasonably tasty, but nothing special."
"This is a good (not great) domestic oktoberfest, grab some this fall."
"Very smooth and easy to drink. I'm buying more of this when I can."
"A solid offering, I enjoyed it."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Poured a medium foamy head on an amber body. Smelled very sweet, with caramel and perhaps honey dominating. Taste was along the same lines, with the caramel being fairly light, and a very, very nice sweetness as the end. Hoppiness kept to a minimum. This is typically not one of my favorite styles, and in fact, Oktober's generally are a bit depressing, as it usually mean summer's over. But I've had a few of this style and this is by far the best I've had."
"D- definitely a great drinker. very tasty"
"It's a good new-world brew, but I prefer the malt & hops in the fatherland."
"D- A very smooth and easy drinking example. It's on the mellow side of the Octoberfest style, but it is incredibly drinkable and would be perfect pint after pint."
"Note: I got the best deal ever on this stuff from a major retailer that recently started carrying alcohol. When I hit the checkout, it rang up as $.27 per 6-pack due to a misship (they had ordered a different variety, but received the seasonal stuff, and they were trying to get rid of it). I figured I'd help them out, and I went back and grabbed the last two off the shelf."
"A good looking amber (almost red) fest beer. The carbonation is fine and a good amount of foam is generated with the pour; as the head falls, just a few little bits of foam stick to the sides. A few sips in and all that remains of the once voluminous head is a fine collar of bubbles. There's lots of malt and a nutty character in the aroma. As time goes on I notice a slight vegetal note which is a bit unappealing. However, this is pleasant tasting light bodied beer with light caramel flavors accented by some nuttiness and a slightly sweet, but crisp finish.The mouthfeel is smooth and enhances the drinkability of this beer."
"Good head and a deep amber with only a few bubbles.The aroma is a sweet, inviing malty grain. The taste is even more sweet. Grainy, very light and offsetting hops. Just great, sessionable, malt bomb. Wodl have given drinkability a ""5", but it was just a little too sweet to be exceptional."
"D - I could celebrate with this, interesting, but not too heady, and bracing, but not so much that I couldn't drink a few of them."
"I've had four different Octoberfest beers this fall and haven't really been blown away by any of them. This is a decent beer, but nothing too special to distinguish it."
"12 oz bottle. This one is deep copper in color with a light island of head and a full ring around the top. Clarity is fantastic and there are just a small number of bubbles in the beer. This is a solid looker. The aroma is toasty with a dough sweetness that is accented with honey sweetness. I could use a little less of the sweetnes and more boldness in the toasted and dough character. The first sip brings mild toast with some caramel sweetness. This fades to a very mild spicy hop finish that just hints at bitter on the side of my tongue. The brew is moderate with a moderate carbonation. It has good body and more carbonation than I expected from the weak head off the pour. Overall impressions of this one are positive. This is a brew I could easily sit and consume all night. Very solid."
"Pours into a pint glass to a nice white head and red-orange color. Great clarity. Aroma is not as malty as some and not very pronounced, especially when it is still cold. Good complexity to the flavors with a hint of alcohol. You really have to let this one warm up a bit for the full flavor to develop, if you can resist. The best part is the lingering malt flavor in your mouth drawing you back for another swallow. Pretty average flavor if not for the finish. A lot of carbonation deters from the mouthfeel and drinkability for me. A lot of the taste is lost when you drink a second, but it gives a good warming feel from the alcohol so it might be better saved for the falling temperatures to come."
"drinkability is great. oktoberfests can be filling and rich, but this one sneaks in under the radar with bold flavors and a rather simple profile to allow for high drinkability and loads of character. cheers!"
"Aroma of malt, grassy, toasty. Poured out a hue of orange with an amber overtone. Head was large with moderate lenght lending to lacing on the glass. Flavors of malt sweetness, toasty, grassy character also present. Some biscuitness apparent in finish. Mouthfeel is somewhat high carbonation, with moderate body. This helps to accentuate the biscuitiness in the finish. Overall this is an enjoyable beer. Not overwhelming in any aspect. One of the better Oktoberfest beers out there."
"Would welcome the opportunity to drink these at a 'fest' activity but sadly not available in our area."
"Drinkability: A very enjoyable Oktoberfest, one of the better examples."
"Gotta admit, I dont like the Oktoberfest genre but this particular entry is fairly tasty. Not something Id drink all the time but I could absolutely see myself getting a six-er or two every fall."
"Overall, one of the more disappointing Oktoberfest, on top of which is a style that I'm not a fan to start with."
"The beer poured out orange-amber with a fair amount of foam. The smell hinted at the malt profile, and the brew delivered a big dollop of malty munich to the tongue. This one felt smooth in the mouth, and was quite drinkable. This is an easy drinking festbeer."
"Drinkability: A nice rendition of the style, though a little lighter than I'd expect from a Capital beer. Easy drinking on hotter days, though without the warmer notes and depth that people might expect to find. A good, solid beer."
"Sweet aroma. Fruit (grape dominates) and caramel malt. Orange with little head. Malty fore followed by a grape heavy middle and finish. Fruit smoothness lingers int he aftertaste. This beer has a fantastic aftertaste. It tastes better 5 seconds after you swallow than it does in your mouth"
"This is one of my favorite oktoberfests, and I'd recommend it to anybody."
"Drinkability is decent on this beer, but I'm used to so much better from Capital. As mentioned before, it's not bad, it's just not impressive and maybe a bit on the light side for me when I think of an Octoberfest style."
"This beer has an almost fiery color to it. Lighter than I'd expect. Aroma of spices and sweet breads. Taste doesn't have the sweetness I was looking for. Lots of malts but they're rather dry. Hops don't really seem to play a factor in this beer. A bit heavy for an Oktoberfest. However, this beer was well attenuated and had a nice smoothness to it despite the thickness. A decent offering from Capital but definitely not their best."
"Its easy to drink but it might not be a good idea to drink too much."
"Reddish-amber, almost no head or lacing. Smells appley and malty, much less musty than other Oktoberfests I've had. Tastes similar to the smell, though mustier, and the mustiness in this case is particularly unpleasant. Not much bitterness. Mouthfeel is crisp and dry. Like the rest of Capital's beers (with the notable exception of their bocks), solid but unspectacular."
"12 ounce bottle. This beer has a clear brown color with a half inch head. The aroma is malty with just a little fruit. Light caramel flavor with lots of fruit, especially apple. The fruit flavor is a little over done. Very little hop flavor. Finish is dry. Medium to heavy mouthfeel. This beer is alright, but there is too much fruit flavor and not enough toasty malt."
"all in all, this oktoberfest pushes the boundaries, definately a bit more fruit dominated than some others. I enjoyed it and will probably grab some more in the coming weeks"
"This pours with a nice Oktoberfesty copper color. Theres a good maltiness here, but also a nice snootful of German hops that doesnt appear in most ""authentic"" Oktoberfests. While German Oktos are going lighter, this one is well-tuned to the American craft beer drinker."
"Very smooth in the mouth, and creamy. Carbonation is light, but still coming in. Obviously this was drunk as zwickel, so it would be difficult to drink much of it, although I had my fair share. Easily consumed, and enjoyably consumed at that. A unique experience not soon to be forgotten. I will make it a point to review this year's Oktoberfest just to see how it compares to this tasting."
"Taste starts off with sweet bread and caramel malts. Light nutty toastiness follows through the palate and then the spicy hops come in. Finish is mildly bitter with lingering doughy sweetness. Medium-bodied, coats mouth nicely. One of the better Oktoberfests Ive had this fall (but I like Autumnal Fire heaps more)."
"This is an excellent flavor. I really love the was it brings autumn to the tongue. It has a bready, fruity flavor that is festive and exciting."
"Capital Oktoberfest is a decent, drinkable version of the style, but doesn't leave a lasting impression. It isn't a beer that I'm interested in drinking a second time."
"Out of all the Oktoberfest beers I've had, this beer was the tops. It had a lot more flavor than Hofbrau Oktoberfest. I really appreciated the extra flavor, and complex character. It is balanced towards maltiness, and it had a beautiful pumpkiny orange color. Too bad it's a seasonal."
"Clear amber-brown color with a small off-white foamy head that fades with a speckled lace. Smell is a roasty sweet malt with a touch of earthy hops. Taste is a mild roasted malt with some sweetness and slight hop showing up near the finish along with a nice balance of sweetness. Pretty tasty and a good quaffer."
"The nice copper color and full head made for a nice looking beer, and the aroma was malty, bready with a bit of spice. The taste of biscuity malt was nice with toasty note to it, but the hop bitterness seemed to overpower it. I think the hops kind of trampled the malt. The beer is still quite good, and seems to improve as it goes. Mouthfeel is good, and carbonation is spot on."
"This Ofest pours a nice clear orange with a thick slightly off white head. The head does stay awhile and leaves decent lacing to the end of the glass. The aroma, a bit faint is, toasted malt with a slight hint of caramel. The taste has a bit more power than the aroma but is a dead match. There is sweetness with the malt flavor present. Nice body, easy to drink, just nothing overpowering. A good beer."
"A slightly hazy, but distinctly orange body is topped by a full head of frothy off-white foam that holds very well and leaves rings of cragged, sticky lace. The delicate nose offers some nice, subtly sweet toasted malt. It's full and dextrinous in the mouth with a fine, median carbonation that's crisp on the tongue. The flavor delivers a solid hop punch of bitterness amidst its lightly caramelish and toasted malt; and some background floral and spicy hops appear in the dry finish. A nicely done festbier that delivers a bit of hops as well as malt!"
"This bottle came in a tour sample pack of which you only get one of each. What I had was half of this in a glass, the other half shared. It poured a nice clear, darker than others, amber. The head was full, fluffy and laceable. The aroma I can't say stood-out. The taste was a carmel malt balanced by a hint of bitter hop. The mouth was left crisp. Given this 6 oz. sample, I'll pick this beer up again if and when I see it. A good Octoberfest offering."
"Brown bottle. No Fresh date."
"This is an amber colored beer with a small and quick to depart white head. The aroma is malty, slightly toasted. The taste of this is a well balanced caramel and grainy taste. Neither are quick to dominate. Hop bitterness is also present, but well balanced as well. This is not a bad beer at all."
"Had this tapped for me at the Wisconsin State Fair. Very Dark amber,with full head.Carmelly thicker first taste, left a carmel sweet taste on the tongue.2nd and 3rd sips a roasted malt and molasses taste sneaks in, not boldly but distinctly. Left a cotton candy taste in my mouth when I was done"
"Here it is in August and the Oktoberfest has already hit the shelves, along with four others that were on the same shelf. Out the those, this was the only one I haven't had. A little early if ya ask me, but oh well, here we go - Clear ambery-brownish color with a small off-white foamy head that fades, little spots of lace. Smell is a roasty sweet malt with a touch of herbal like hops and earthyness coming through. Taste is subdued roasted malts with some sweetness and slight tang coming through mostly, a touch of herbal qualities show up near the finish along with a balancing sweetness. Feel is a bit lighter then expected, even while drinking it in 85 degree heat, it is however, very smooth and easy for good drinkin'."
"Capital seems to have dropped the ball on this one. Either that or I had a bad bottle. Amber in color with an off-white head that retreats quickly. Light aroma consisted of some sweet malt and a touch of caramel. Mouthfeel teeters between thin and medium-bodied. Taste is extremely bland for an Oktoberfest. Everything about the caramel, biscuit and malt flavors are muted and watered down. Very disappointing."
"Overall a nice domestic Oktoberfest, but I still prefer the real thing from Germany."
"Off-white head, gone quickly. Amber/caramel color. Aroma:vegetal, herbal,spicy, earthy, pumpkins. Rich maltiness, nice sweet overtones, some tingly hops. A satisfactory Oktoberfest, very smooth and easy-drinking."
"Clear orange-copper color, nice white foamy head. Aroma of light caremel and flowers, sweet, balanced malts and clean tasting, light body, a little thin semi-watery mouthfeel, still a very good Oktoberfest."
"Now we're getting somewhere. Part of the Capital ""Summer Sampler", this is a really good seasonal. Dark amber with decent lace. Nice honey and nutty aroma. Tastes kind of like a Marzen with a malt flavor and light caramel finish. I will look for this one next summer."
"A pretty solid Oktoberfest all around."
"re-rate 9/6/05-Same cloudy appearance..almost a sour candy apple type finish...one of their worst products and one of the worst o-fests I've had...average is being kind"
"Clear bright orange color, good creamy head of 1/4 inch.  Toasty aroma, a little brown sugar.  Nice match for style, nice dominant caramel malt flavor with a hoppy clove bite peppered in.  Good elements of toast.  A little better mouthfeel than some.  Very drinkable, open a couple and pour 'em in a big ass stein and quaff in honor of the harvest.  A good kick off for Fest season for me (I'm not counting the bomber of Lagunitas)..."
"This clear reddish brown brew throws out a nice long lasting thin off white head.  Nice bready, yeasty, malty aroma.  Nice biscuit tones on the tongue as well as toasted malt.  Very clean tasting.  Very little to no caramel malt sweetness is noted.  Some slight hop bitterness is apparant.  Medium bodied and very drinkable.  I'm in anticipation of some nice 50 degree autumn days to enjoy these fine O-fest beers.    Another solid lager from Capital."
"Amber with hints of orange.  Complex malt aroma.  Mixed hop and malt flavor that is on the light side for style.  Finish is rather dry and long.  Overall good but not great."
