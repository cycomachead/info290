It stands out because of it's malt-forward character and because it's a pretty solid buy (six tallboys for around $9-$10). The sweetness is there but it's far from overpowering. I paired this with pupusas, plantains and rice & beans and it was perfect; I love pairing Latin American food with German-style lagers. I'd have this again for sure - next time probably in season (found it on sale among fall remainders).","illpass78","Mar 07, 2014"

Smells of caramel and candy sugar with hints of prune and raisin and a touch of carmelization. Little to no hop aroma. The flavor is sweet with brown sugar countered by a light burnt sugary taste. Light dried fruits and a hint of earth. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. I was quite impressed with this beer, although I went in with low expectations. It's a touch on the sweet side for my tastes, but its got a wonderful melanoid flavor and aroma as well as the dried fruits. Color me pleasantly surprised.","johnnnniee","Oct 23, 2013"

3.4,-6.3,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a deep, candied orange, close to amber. The beer pours with an aggressive head of yellowing bubbles that form a creamy canopy over the beer about two fingers high. The head lasts for quite some time, but when it dissipates, splotches of fluffy foam are left behind. In body the beer is clean yet dark, with a steady stream of carbonation from the bottom of the glass. A dark haze is present in the beer, but the other side of the glass is visible. On the nose, the beer smells of buttery caramel malts. Cooked biscuits and toffee swim thickly onto the nose and leave a sticky sense in the nostrils. Faint, spicy hops and grass play at the fringes of the beer’s smell. Dactyl seems to be present in the beer, but I find it inviting with the sweet smell of the malts. On the tongue, the beer tastes bready sweet with definite dactyl touches and a soft, building bitter that is slightly spicy. Faint salinity can also be found in the malt character, and light acidity gives light tartness at the very finish. The balance of this beer is off and lies slightly in the sweet section, though the bitters do wonders for drying out the finish of the beer. In flavor, the beer begins as rich toffee and buttered biscuits. Caramel, maple syrup, and rich breads play across the palate as the flavor slowly swings to the bitter end with dry grass, spicy hay and faint green tea. The finish is smooth caramel with touches of bitter grass, but the aftertaste is mostly of grass and soft dirt. In the mouth, the beer feels creamy and syrupy with a medium-plus body and a middling carbonation that works to try and keep the beer’s sweetness in check. The mouth is left sticky with saliva on the cheeks and a sticky sweet feeling on the tongue. Overall, this is not the worst Oktoberfest by a long shot. It is sweet and pleasing, and not unpleasant to put back. That paired with its cheap price makes it actually desirable. If you want a Marzen for cheap, this is a good option, though I still prefer Jack’s Abby’s Copper Legend.","Maxwell","Sep 22, 2013"

The nose comprises banana, buttery biscuit, and a vague sense of some sort of citrus rind. The taste focuses on a slightly less blurry version of the citrus, and everything else comes through watered-down and whatnot. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, an okay beer at best, one that seems like a severely weakened version of the classic German style. It's not bad, really, but I wouldn't buy another if presented with the opportunity.","TMoney2591","Jan 18, 2013"

Toasted malt and herbal hop aromas with a hint of tart fruit in the background. Medium bodied with pleasant carbonation and a semi-dry finish. Sweet bready and grainy malt flavors up front that quickly segue to spicy/herbal hoppiness through the middle to the end. Sweet malty flavors continue beneath. Finishes with a lingering bitter hop aftertaste. A little hoppier than most marzens but a good beer nonetheless.","IronLover","Sep 19, 2012"

4.43,22,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Another winning American Oktoberfest brew... I've quite a few as of late. This brew pours a gorgeously radiant amber and is capped with a filmy white head that deposits a surprising amount of spotty lace upon the glass' wall. The nose is fairly aromatic, offering biscuity, caramel-y notes and a hint of general nuttiness. The flavor is more directly nutty, fairly doughy-biscuity, and has restrained sweetness despite having much of its basis in sweet-type flavors such as caramel and toffee. The feel shows a great balance between creaminess and toothy body, and refreshing, mouth-watering drinkability. This is one of the best surprises I've had in a while, and I will certainly be drinking more of this.","ktrillionaire","Sep 17, 2011"

Bread and caramel, light toastiness, and faint leafy hops. It seemed like a hint of spiciness or alcohol was present in the finish, along with a lingering mineral character. Texture was nice, smooth with some heft to the body, lowish carbonation. Overall, I quite enjoyed it.","DrJay","Sep 17, 2011"

The beer has a spicy and bread/toast like aroma, which is very enticing. Good cling to the glass while you drink, the beer has a sweet, rich caramel malt flavor, with a heavy dose of nutmeg and cinnamon spicing that cuts the sweetness and warms you while you drink. The beer is creamy smooth in mouth, and gives you a malty tang on the aftertaste, with nutmeg and pumpkin throughout. The full bodied brew gives a slightly lingering, creamy finish.

It's like a slight mis-balance in the flavor, and nothing really compliments each other in it. There is a real hint of spice too, but again, it just doesn't mix correctly. The aftertaste is much better than the 'during' taste, with a nice cereal style after taste to it. That is the only part I really liked about it.

Biscuit, caramel, toffee are all present but this beer does a good job of not becoming overly sweet. It's light to medium bodied, almost too light, and finishes slightly dry. While the body is a bit too light for my taste it also makes this beer go down easily and quickly.

Taste is very crisp - caramel and barley combined with clean yeast for a biscuity taste. Hops add a slightly medicinal and bitter edge, matching the malt and yeast. Overall the taste is extremely crisp and clean, as well as the feel. Very drinkable, one of the better picks of its style this year.","Zodijackyl","Nov 16, 2010"
3.42,-5.8,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Tallboy poured into a pint glass. Pours a clear dark orange with a thin whit head on top. Dissipates quickly; no lace. The nose is pretty basic with hints of caramel, toasted malt, and some graham cracker. The mouth is a little harsher in carbonation than I'd like. Definitely spritzy. There's some heft to the body though. Flavors start out with a sweet caramel, light roasted malts, and a bit of alcohol on the finish. Clean finish. This wasn't my favorite Festbier of the season, but it's not bad. I'd gladly have it again.","Onenote81","Nov 05, 2010"
3.96,9.1,5,4,4,4,3.5,"The Crack & Glug netted me two fingers of thick, tawny head with great retention. Color was a stunning orangish-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was an interesting mix of grassy hop and caramel malt sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a big caramel taste on the tongue. This was pretty close to the style although many modern iterations are going for a dryer quality (Victory Fest), which is what I prefer. Finish was likewise relatively sweet with a definite caramel taste that lingered. Not bad, but not my favorite CANned O'fest, either.","woodychandler","Oct 31, 2010"
4.01,10.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"This can looks fantastic in my fridge and this beer looks fantastic in my glass. Frothy, airy eggshell-colored head sits atop a beer that looks like fall- copper and reminiscent of dark amber honey. Foam doesn't last long however and is just about completely gone by the time I take my first sip. Aroma is true to the style- dry, grassy, bready. Taste is clean and malty; sure, there is a bit of sweetness there but the hops have a little more punch that your typical Octoberfest. For me that makes all the difference in drinkability. Carbonation is nice and high, and that touch of hops bitterness means I could drink these tallboys all day and night. Will be sad when this beer's season ends...","coachdonovan","Oct 29, 2010"

3.75,3.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"The appearance is a nice copper color with a one finger head, that quickly dissipates and leaves a small ring. Smell has notes of malt, hops, sugar. The taste contains more of the malt, with some spices on the profile, and a bitter aftertaste. Carbonation seems appropriate for the style, along with some breadiness to it, and earthy overall. Drinkability on this newer offering from the folks at `Gansett is solid. I wish that I had bought some more, will have to do exactly that in the near future.","mltobin","Oct 15, 2010"

4.35,19.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I always drink out of a glass used for BEER ONLY! It was chilled to 32 degrees and dumped into a wet glass. Great copper color. As it was consumed it held the head all the way to the bottom of the glass. The flavor and smoothness increases as the beer warms in the glass. I think Gansett hit a home run. Now if we could only get this stuff in New Hampshire.","Ritz4022","Oct 09, 2010"

3.8,4.7,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"16oz Tall Boy. Pours a dark burnt orange with a quickly disappearing head. Some lacing. Aroma is of caramel with some malts. Somewhat sweet. Taste is more sweet caramel. Roasted malts as well and some spice to it. Hard to put into words but it just has that great Oktoberfest beer taste. Certainly drinkable and I'm loving drinking an Oktoberfest out of a 16oz can. I must admit that Narragansett is my Go-to lager, but with the recent additions of the Porter and now 'Fest I'm hoping that this is the start of a trend of new beers by 'Gansett. Worth buying, no question.","PicoPapa","Oct 07, 2010"
3.91,7.7,4,3,4,4.5,4.5,"D - Wow, this is an amazing session beer. Cant get over how good this beer is. Did this really come from not only a can, but a Narragansett can?! Definately worth the pickup. An amazing macro take on this style. Holy cow.","rudzud","Oct 05, 2010"

3.66,0.8,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"D: This is a decent American Marzen from Narragansett. The macro-adjunct flavor is fairly well masked so it isn't a big turnoff for me, and these went down easy. And $7.99 for a 6pk of 16oz cans makes this one a great value.","JMD","Oct 04, 2010"
4.1,12.9,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,5,"A highly drinkable light amber brew with a frothy tan head and light to medium carbonation. Aroma is lightly sweet and malty.

3.96,9.1,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"D: Gansett Fest's finest attributes are its clean look, smooth feel and fine balance of flavors. The 5.5% ABV puts it right in a sessionable territory and the tallboys are a bonus. That said, it either tastes like it was made with adjuncts or just not the same quality of malts you'll taste in more established American marzen lagers. Overall, it's a great value and a good Oktoberfest beer. Prost to RI!","Gambrinus1184","Sep 28, 2010"

3.18,-12.4,4,3.5,3,3,3,"The taste is not where it needs to be. This is a fairly light bodied beer with a malty back bone, definitely a touch of caramel, but with a spicy bite and an overprocessed feel. The finish is just a bit metallic, flat, and unappealing. It loses some of its sweetness in the finish as as the settles in. The reddish caramel flavors are decent but compromised by some of the off flavors towards the finish. As with most macro type lagery beers, the taste starts to diminish when the beer warms and some adjunct maybe presenting itself.","albern","Sep 25, 2010"

3.25,-10.5,3,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,"As I pointed to early, I like drinking this beer and it almost just reminds me of a regular tall can. Enjoyable beer, but not up there in the top "fest" beers(nor I was expecting it to be while buying it)","IPAkindaguy","Sep 14, 2010"

3.68,1.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"16oz. can served in a tumbler. Pours a translucent copper with a loose, one inch, cream-colored head pockmarked with ringlets and tiny craters. Head slowly recedes into a fairly consistent slick of foam, leaving delicate strands and slashes of lacing, but exhibiting weak adhesion. Nose reveals a light malt profile (perhaps some caramel), a mild aromatic hops quality and a trace of grain and citric acid. Taste follows nose - some sweetness expressed at the start, with a light citrus character close behind and a dry, somewhat cleansing, light hop character at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-bodied, but an assertive carbonation gives it a crispness and a little more texture to the mouthfeel. A very drinkable Märzen. Not your typical malty, sweet example of the style, but solid and quite drinkable. A fairly accessible offering for those new to this style of beer.","Jwale73","Sep 05, 2010"
