"Nice crisp taste, goes down smooth"
""

"Pale yellow color and good foaming. Slight skunk/sweet smell.  Taste hops on the backend.  Hardly any carbonation, almost flat.  Not bad, but is outshined by many other Octoberfest type brews."

"Speaking of tapping, I had not had a 5-L mini-keg (CAN) for a while and this was only my third or fourth, so venting was initially problematic as I twisted it more than a quarter-turn, which was too far. When I realized my mistake, I backed it down and got a momentary spray of beer until it pressurized. I pulled out the spigot and readied my glass before twisting the spigot to the left. Beer began flowing unabated! This produced two fingers of fluffy, bone-white head with good retention. Color was Pale-Yellow (SRM = 1 - 2) with NE-plus quality clarity. Nose had a biscuity maltiness. Mouthfeel was medium. Taste was malty, but not cloying as many beers in the style are. Instead, it had a bready, nutty flavor that was a pleasant surprise. Finish was semi-dry, not very sweet at all. Everyone who got a taste agreed that it was less sweet than expected, so whether a result of inadvertent aging or by design, I feel like it was quite worthwhile."

"A crisp, clean, excellent example of the German Octoberfest style. A lot of these reviews miss the fact that German Octoberfest beers are different from American versions.  This beer is excellent to world class, not merely OK."

"This is just an awesome lager beer and a brand that literally defines the style.  A must have/try."

"Pours a very clear golden straw color. A fingernail length head. Aroma is malty sweet. Taste of light malt and light hops. The feel is perhaps my favorite aspect of this beer. It has a lively carbonation. It is crisp and refreshing and light bodied. Not very complex, yet overall, a decent beer."

"Poured perfectly clear and golden. Aroma was malty and earthy. The body was a bit lighter than the typical American renditions but the beer was perfectly balanced and the familiar with the malty sweetness and noble hops coming through nicely."

"DATE TASTED: September 20, 2014... GLASSWARE: Saranac willbecker...OCCASION: PSU/UMass--a Mass-acre to be?... APPEARANCE: hazy golden yellow body akin to a pilsener; steady upward bubbles; quite light for a fest; pale white head laces in tongues... AROMA: highly hopped in Saaz, apparently; besides the ping, some floral hops and grassy notes; not the fest expected... PALATE: active, vibrant and commanding--the aftertaste lingers with sweetness.....TASTE: sweet as a corn and biscuit combo can be; malty to the taste buds, but not as round as it is metallic to the nostrils; some wheat grass ...OVERALL: as Oktoberfests go, a surprise--much lighter and less malty than expected in its finish; perhaps drinking too many American fests has misled my expectations; still, balanced and worthwhile...."
""
""
""
"yep. these ARE the original brews we drank years ago while America was languishing in Zima and Bartles n Jaymes....... I have had poor opinion of these recently but they truly are the originals. I miss being able to guzzle a hugely tasteful, hearty brew like this. gulping this down, I had a flashback to my Spaten days at Old World in Huntington Beach. anyone remember Club-Weisse? this aint it, but dang it provided a great flashback! prosit!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Crisp and perfectly balanced, with plenty of honey and flower nectar notes. A little green and spicy on the finish - nice use of noble hops. Much more floral than you would expect an Octoberfest beer to be. This one is my favorite of the style, just a little above Weihenstephan's."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a good, crisp tasting lager however it tastes more like a Pilsner than an Oktoberfest brew. That being said I would drink it again."
"Overall just OK."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not what comes to mind with an Oktoberfest kind of beer, but a super drinkable stronger lager.  Green bottle makes it seem a little bush league, though."

"Pint on tap at Beer Revolution in Calgary. A golden straw color with a light film of white bubbles on top and a pleasing enough aroma, notably floral hops with an unexpected whiff of tropical fruit (lychee?), grapes, corn flake, and rather bready malts. Unfortunately, the taste was more pedestrian, subdued, and dare I say ""macro"" ... An understated graininess, maybe a very light pear fruitiness, crisp and dry with aggressive carbonation, thin body, and vaguely grassy noble finish. I agree that it is not really anyone's place to claim that this beer somehow fails to capture style guidelines. There are lighter Oktoberfests. However, to my palate this compares unfavorably with other German examples such as Ayinger. I'd prefer the flavors to pop more after the tease on the nose."
""
"2.84/5: Even without taking the skunk into consideration, I'd still prefer a good marzen over this one"

"Overall-  An okay beer, but there are clearly some off flavors in this beer that detract from the enjoyment.  I've had this multiple time in the past and this was much better on draft, so maybe the green bottles screwed with, but even then I never really have that problem with Spaten beers.  For what this is right now, its a okay oktoberfest that I'd give another chance, but if the off flavors persist then there's better alternatives out there.  (70/100)"

"Pours a straw-yellow with a good 1/2+ finger foamy white head that settles down to about a 2mm head. Some spotty lacing was seen when sipped. Lots of streaming bubbles rising from the bottom and sides of the .3l (about 11.5 ounce) 'boot'. The aroma is of German grains with a slight floral hops. A bit more going on with the taste with some spicy hops in there as well. Very slightly dry but lightly sweet finish as well. Overall, not as good as some of the other Oktoberfest brews I have tried recently but was decent."

"Pale golden color with a decent sized bubbly white head that persists for a bit. aromas of spicy floral hops, rich bready crackery pilsner with just a hint of melanoid. The flavor is rich and malty with a hint of sweetness. Light spicy hop provides balance and a touch of pruney cooked sugars adds some complexity. Medium body and moderate carbonation. I'd drink these all day long given half the chance. Clean well made with some subtle flavors, I like."
"overall: a solid, well made strong beer."

"If I can find this brew in a can or brown bottle I think it would be a lot better.  The skunky smell and taste is the killer of this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Maybe it was the extra alcohol - which wasnt very noticable - it was very drinkable, but too much carbonation (in spite of a very agressive pouring with a huge head). I do like the hoppiness though. Will try review properly next time."

"Poured from a green 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a pale light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is kind of grassy, maybe a touch skunky. Taste is very light, some malts, some light grassiness, more pilsner like than oktoberfest in flavor profile. Feels light in the mouth and overall, while a drinkable and decent beer, there are way to many better examples of this style to recommend this one."

"10/16/13 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. This obviously travels very well. Smooth & perfectly balanced. Not sure about a Ma√ü bier but this sure would serve well as a full session companion."

"Not my favorite German Oktoberfest, but a good beer all the same. Hofbrau's version comes in clear and gold, with a thinner white head. The head lingers on aided by moderate carbonation. THe aroma is very mild, but just hints of malt sweetness and grass. The taste is a little more robust, with more depth to the sweetness, a little bit of biscuit, and a nice hit from the hops. The body is a little thinner and with some carbonation."

"Funny, my bottle was green, not brown as in the picture.  It was ok, it was a bit skunky and very pale in color."

"Just a general comment and observation on some of the reviews of the German Oktoberfest on here.  To say Spaten-Franziskaner, Paulaner, Warsteiner, Hofbrau, etc ""are not good representations of the style"" is an erroneous and quite snobbish, ignorant American view.  Although all large breweries, those companies ARE Oktoberfest and are all that's served in the Munich beer tents.  Far, far before American micro-breweries, craft brewers, and snobbish beer geeks, these styles epitomized what not only an Oktoberfest brew is, but their main line epitomized what German beer is.  Before Papa Joe's IPA shack was sold all over the place, going to a German restaurant and having a Spaten on draft was beyond a treat.  Now that we're all so spoiled, and 5000 beers in a store still isn't enough, we've cast off some of these larger European breweries to the curb and put them in the same class as a Miller.  These companies ARE ""the style"".  Some backyard hipsters operating in a 1000 sqft facility craft brewing are not ""the experts"" and leading what an Oktoberfest is.  In fact no American brewery is.  There's a huge difference between the German style and the American version.  I look for authentic beers, and when it comes to Oktoberfest, the ONLY beers to drink are from Munich.  The American versions are drain-pour.  Sometimes it's just about the drinkability and being able to pound liter after liter and have fun. Not jack up the ABV to heightened levels, sell it for a premium, and make every bottle some ride on the wild side.  Tis the Gem√ºtlichkeit - ein prosit!"

"O - Almost feel that I got a mislabeled bottle, but reading other reviews it appears that this is just an extremely poor example of the style. Completely off in color, malt complexity. Nothing wrong if it were categorized as a pale lager, but this is just not an Oktoberfest."

"On tap at The Seehund. Pours a translucent light amber color with an inch of head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is malty with some honey, sweet bread, caramel and floral hop notes. The taste is floral hops followed by the malts. Caramel and honey towards the end with a bit of floral hops. Medium bodied. Overall, great representation of the style."

"Another one of those German standards, where differentiation seems like a hard row to hew - it's difficult to not just proclaim 'yup, tastes very much like a real Bavarian Marzen', and leave it at that. But no, we have to go and talk about the headier than normal orchard fruit notes, the barely contained booze (which is technically a fair bit higher than average, no?), and the general zeitgeist of an offering that slowly, but surely grew on me by the end of the (import, hence the time lag) bottle."
"This is a light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. In true octoberfest fashion, this is pretty crushable and something you could drink effortlessly if you dont focus too much on what is going on with it. Nice to say I had it, but I doubt I would opt to try this again if presented with other options."

"Here's my last Oktoberfest offering perhaps for the remainder of the year. It's sad how a lot of these beers gather dust, yet it's even sadder that whatever a lot of these breweries are making in Germany for Oktoberfest are no different from their standard offerings. This is an example of that, but it still ends up being enjoyable. Due to the strict brewing regulation that goes on during the summer months in Germany, these older beers have been lagering sur lie for a longer period of time, and the booze is expected. Also, due to the inordinate amount of people that attend the festival, they have to get them off of the seats somehow! While I've had better Oktoberfest seasonal offerings, this one is still pretty good."
""
""
"If you like miller lite, this beer is for you. Scary how similar this is to mL for me anyways. Sweet, fairly one dimensional and watery. Light amber/yellow...seems like a pils. Smells pils-y. Clear as yellow glass. I would not drink again. Sweet, breadlike finish. I assume, based on the german nature of this beer, there are no adjucts, but it tastes corny to me. I am not sure why the others in my group loved it so."
""
""
""
""
"Oktoberfestbier pours a golden straw color with no head. There is a sweet apple juice like aroma. The taste is rather pale, light, and has a strong apple juice like flavor. Flavor is present but rather light and watery, and a little too much of the sweet side. Overall its a sweet light fruity Marzen."

"Hofbr√§u Oktoberfestbier has a medium, white head and a clear, bubbly, golden appearance with some lacing left behind. The aroma is of rich, full, and pungent barley malt and sweetness, and the flavor is of sweet, hearty, and bold malt, with a fairly moderate hop bite to balance out the malt liquor-like sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium and a bit slick, and Hofbr√§u Oktoberfestbier finishes wet, refreshing, and easily drinkable. This beer so much reminds me of major label American malt liquors, but without the corn adjunct or the background cloying sweetness. Overall, I think it‚Äôs a very enjoyable one. RJT"

"Amazing to think this is the first real Ok fest beer from Germany to come into BC. A lighter version of the style but still over 6% , this is a easy drinking clean marzen that a pleasant bready finish. While not as malty as I like for the style this is typical of the OK fest beers being served these days in Munich, lighter in colour and taste. I will buy more of this but other German Pils at around $2 a tall can present a better value."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It was an average Octoberfest beer - but not quite the Marzen profile I was looking for. I felt it leaned more towards a full bodied & malty pils. I'll finish the six pack - CHEERS!"
""
""
""
""
""
"While not one of the top Oktoberfest beers, Hofbrau's is simple, tasty, and something I could easily see myself having a one liter stein of."
""
""
"O: Not cloying or sickly, better this year than in previous years."
""
""
""

"O - better than I remember. Good enough. Prost!"

"It's hard to write a review for this beer as it resembles the Hoffbrau Original too much. Do I write one that compares it to other Oktoberfest' s or do I rate it according to its own merit? All I'll do is so simply say that I liked the Original a lot and could session it to death. This Oktoberfest may not compare to some others but I could session this one all September long."
""
""
"Overall a good easy drinking beer."
""
""
""

"The oktoberfest poured a lighter golden color than most German versions. The aroma is all caramel malt with a hint of earthy grassiness. The taste follows with a strong malt profile that has caramel and honey with a slight hoppiness in the middle that keeps it from being overly sweet. This was my first Oktoberfest of the season and I was thoroughly enjoying it."
""
""
""
"What I like about this Oktoberfest is that for a relatively high ABV %, it's a very easy to drink beer. It pours an unimpressive, bubbly straw color with a slight foamy head. The smell is grainy, slightly fruity, a subtle aroma of malt with a good amount of carbonation, but it's not overwhelming. The taste is grainy/malty -- a slight kick to it, but again, just a very easy to drink beer. All in all, a very good session beer for the late summer/early fall months."
""
""
"Seems like it has taken on a touch of skunk. It's a decent enough beer but I won't be revisiting it with better options in the style like Paulaner and Weihenstephaner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is okay. Fair head, and some slight lacing; and a golden hue not really characteristic. Nose is very yeasty, not really characteristic of the style, either. Yeasty, with some citrus, and spice. Overall, this is an okay quaff."
""
""
"Overall: There isn't much for me to like here even though Hofbrauhaus beers are usual reliably exceptional. It'd make for a good session beer but it's not extraordinary and is easily forgettable."
"O - It was better than expected. It has been awhile since I have had this style of beer. I think I would rather have Great Lakes, but this is not bad."
""
""
""
"O: Nothing to write home about. Quite drinkable but not very memorable beer. Was very excited when I picked this one up but don't think I'll be having any more of these."
"Overall - A tasty beer, but the sweetness while not artificial I find is a bit overdone."

"330 ml bottle into pint glass, bottled 5/25/2012. Pours lightly cloudy golden amber color with a nice 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Good spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of apple, pear, caramel, biscuit, toasted grain, light nuttiness, pepper, grass, floral, herbal, and light skunkiness. Ok aromas with good strength and decent balance. Taste of apple, pear, caramel, toasted grain, bread, grass, floral, pepper, herbal, earthy spiciness, and light skunkiness. Lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, toasted grain, bread, pepper, herbal, floral, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a bit. Ok flavor balance and complexity; with a good balance of malt and peppery spiciness from the hops; a fair amount of cloying astringency is present on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is decent. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a mediocre Oktoberfest. Skunked flavors and aromas; with flavor astringency on the finish make this much less enjoyable. Quite easy to drink, though."
""
""
""
"Pours a perfectly lucid straw color with a moderate amount of white froth. Carbonation bubbles are readily visible as they make their continuous migration toward the surface. The aroma has an appreciable skunkiness that masks earthy hops and trace amounts of malt sweetness. The exceedingly thin and light appearance would lead one to believe the flavor would match, but that is not the case at all. The flavor is surprisingly robust, with some caramel, brown sugar, and a distinctive nuttiness that I would never have suspected. Just enough hops are present to balance the malt sweetness, and the carbonation is spot-on, lending a creamy mouthfeel that complements the flavor profile well. I think I'm detecting trace amounts of apple peel near the back end as well. The sticky malt residue lingers on the lips, denoting a body belied by the thin visage. As far as criticisms are concerned, the hops overstay their welcome a bit in the finish, and the sweetness comes off a tad artificial, but there's no denying this is highly sessionable brew with more robustness than I'd expect to find in an oktoberfest. One of the more intriguing festbiers I've tried."
""
""
""
"Overall, a bit too sweet to be sessionable. Good caramelization, but the skunky aroma also detracts from the experience. BROWN bottles! Nothing to write home about."
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Grade: 3.33, a somewhat acceptable B-. Hofbr√§u Oktoberfestbier is tasty stuff, though it's certainly not interesting or unique stuff. It's still a refreshing, reliable brew in its own right - unfortunately, it's one that this Euro Lager fan merely likes, rather than loves. One thing I will say is that this is a perfect pairing for the first week of genuinely cold weather we've had all year here - it's light enough to be session-worthy, but hot enough to warm you a little as the night goes on. Worth a try if you have the chance to, but not a particularly memorable marzen by any metric."
""
""
"O: A good beer. I think it could be much better if it was not as sweet."
"This is a very good example for the style, as it one of the originals."
""
""
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Bright orange, soapy head, lacing on the side. Slight aroma of honey, grain, malts. Flavor is malty with a honey grain flavor like honey wheat bread. Overall, goes down easy and a sixer would have been a better choice than the single I picked up."
"O - A pretty disappointing Marzen overall, light on aroma and flavor. Needs some bolder toasted malt and nuttiness added to really give it that Oktoberfest charm. There are better beers of the style out there that make this one not even worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Really surprised that even on tap this one has some hints of skunk. One of my least favorite marzens"

"The beer smells skunky and reminiscent of Heineken, which isn‚Äôt a very promising thing for a beer to smell like. Notes of light caramel mix with a large bouquet of hay and grass with light biscuit touches on the edges of the smell. The beer tastes light and highly drinkable. Heavy notes of creamy caramel mingle with notes of hay and earthy hops. The sip begins as light sweet caramel bordering on sweet apples, but then opens into heavy hay-like flavoring that reminds me of a traditional saison a hell of a lot more than an Oktoberfest. From there it slides into more spicy and earthy hop notes, and then lingers in the mouth as a mix of pilsner-like hops and hay. Mouthfeel is thin and highly drinkable, which is wonderful for the style. Carbonation is light, and the beer practically slides off the tongue lightly and leaves the mouth slightly dry with some saliva on the edges. Overall this is a mediocre almost-session ale, but it does not taste like a Oktoberfest by my measure. The heavy hay-funk notes make me think that this beer might have an infection or something, but I actually like them and found them refreshingly palatable. An enjoyable chugger, but nothing like what you would expect from the style."

"definitely not my favorite of the german oktoberfests. it pours a very light and very clear pee yellow color with a half inch of rapidly fading white head. it smells like pale german malts and just a hint of that classic oktober sweetness. the flavor is pretty bland in this one, not the robust malty offereings i am used to this time of year. it almost tastes old in that way, and the aftertaste is a little off. the mouthfeel is fine enough, a little too light for the style i think though in terms of body. the carbonation is good though, and its easy to put down. even though this is authentic and all, i will not be coming back to it this year."

"It does smell slightly of skunkiness but mostly has a medium-level soft bread dough and floral hopping aroma. The flavor follows suit, but has a garnish twist of apple esters at the back end with some light amount of boozy heat. It's not a bold or amazing beer by any stretch of the imagination, but it suffers badly from style mismatch to the expected marzen standard. (Where are the toasted nutty qualities?) And the green glass bottle certainly doesn't help in terms of skunkiness. I can't really recommend this one, sadly. It might have been better than average when it began it's journey across the Atlantic, but it certainly didn't stay that way."
"Orange body, white head with moderate retention and some webbed lacing. Nose has various cereals, toasty grains, light veggie and some drying malt and mineral character. Taste has sweet malts, light caramel, more toasty cereals and some veg. Good bit of hop bitterness, but too much for my liking. Medium feel, higher med carbonation. Probably won't revisit this."

"o - Overall a very solid Oktoberfest beer, if that is what you are looking for. Nothing that outstanding about it, but it's a good, solid made Oktoberfest beer. Looks like people have had big problems with bottles of it but it was fine on tap; not skunky at all. If you're looking for an easy drinking Oktoberfest beer worth checking out, though I liked their Dunkel a lot more."
""
"Overall - 4.5- 5. Refreshing, clean, yummy and satisfying. Don't miss out on this one ON-TAP. Don't seek out the bottles. They're green and skunk too easily."
""
""
"The alcohol and sweetness in the middle of the flavor profile were the main distractions here but there was enough Noble hop character to mostly keep this crisp and drinkable. This was decent but I think there are some better imported examples of the style out there."
""
""
""
"Overall: A decent tasting Marzen, but its held back by the skunking from the green bottle. I would be interested to see how this tastes from the tap."
""
"Overall / Drinkability: A simple beer, but very solidly put together such that all the simplicity equals one very drinkable beer. I had this at the Dayton German Fest earlier this year and again now, and in both cases I could easily knock back another, and I would not mind doing so. Not a rich in flavor Marzen, nor is it my favorite as I think the malt is a bit on the weak side - but - it works as a good beer. If I cannot get some of my other favorites, I think I'll look to this one as my backup for large amounts with pork and other typical German Oktoberfest favorites."
""
"Drinkabililty : an average beer in the German style Oktoberfest."
""

"This was another crystal clear, blondish-yellow beer. I'm going to try to have to dig up some more of my old pics from Germany, because I remember these being much darker in color too. There are some numbers stamped on the label, but nothing I can discern as a date. In any case I think I'll be passing on this one until I can find my way back to Germany again."
""
""
""
"O: ¬†The smell was pretty awful and I was expecting to hate this buy it turned out the taste was much better than the nose. The flavors worked well together and the mouthfeel was pretty good.¬†"
"Green bottle...can't wait. Hoping it wasn't sunked, but alas no such luck. Moderate amount of skunkiness in the aroma with some malt background. The skunkiness came over in the flavor too. Would like to try this from the tap in Germany as I think it would be a really great beer if it was packaged better."
""
""
""

""

"Overall ‚Äì Nothing too special here. They should ditch the green bottle to get rid of some of the skunky nose. While rather easy drinking, there are definitely better ones out there."

"My fiancee and I loved it!"

"O: A nice Oktoberfest beer."
""
""
"I still like it for what it is; a paler and hoppier Oktoberfest without that generous toast character to the grain. Not a top-notch German example, however. Still passable, and very drinkable."

"I got a 5 liter mini-keg for $10.99 so I'm not complaining too much. Good beer, not exceptional but solid. Pretty thin appearance for a fest beer - gold like a lager. Smells of caramel mostly and a bit toasty, cookie dough, malty, spicy. Tastes of vanilla, caramel, slight hops, alcohol is hardly noteceable, even though 6.3 is relatively strong. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy with a spiky finish. This is treating me right. I don't get any off flavors. Not the best Oktoberfest ever made, but in the class of very good beer."

"O/D-Pretty easy drinking Oktoberfest. Had it a bit out of date but this isn't a hop bomb so I don't think the flavor degraded much. Pretty mild; the skunk/metallic taste is off-putting but it is very minimal. Had a single, and that was enough."

"O - A drinkable beer without being spectacular."
""
"O: Overall a decent beer, tasty but nothing remarkably striking about it."
"The beer exits the 11.2 ounce green bottle a crystal clear golden color with a towering cap of white foam above. The aroma is mainly consists of bready notes with some husky grains mixed in. Lots of lightly toasted malt on the palate. The barley is clean and thorough. A touch of grassy hops at the end rounds it out. A fine beer, nothing outstanding, but nothing particularly to complain about either."

"Overall: My second favorite ""Marzen", sure there are alot out there, but HB has given me a true beer with absolutely no hassles. Drinks smooth they way it should be, not debatable, and incredible taste to comfort the soul. Take it with love and cheers to all!"

"The octoberfest stash is in need of attention along with my pumpkin ale as we move into the holiday ale season. With that a review of the last of this years batch. A pale golden fluid with a soft fluffy white head. Some lacing left after a gentle fade. Smell is toasted sweet and malty. Some light spiciness in the hops as well. Taste is caramel malt, mildly sweet with a good toasted breadiness. Clean hop bitterness in the finish has muted Sazz notes and light peppery zing. Alcohol is hidden at first but as it warms it gives notice. Feel is medium light crisp and refreshing. A decent thirst quencher. This goes down well and drinks like a session lager when cold but the abv is a little high so be careful. The thing is this is more like a malty pilsner than a marzen so a nice beer but not quite what I was expecting style wise.."

"O: Very drinkable, but not really noteworthy either."
"O: Neither offending nor very pleasing. I like this one okay."
"Overall- Again, just a really refreshing drink, but as far as a Fest profile goes, it remains fairly average."
"It's an ok beer, nothing special"
"O: Pretty run-of-the-mill marzen, maybe even slightly below average given the grainy, low-character malt contribution and dank grassy hoppiness."
"O - This beer is an easy drinker with a fairly high ABV. Has refreshing properties but is very simple in structure."
"This poured a nice clear bubbly yellow, with a good two fingers of not quite creamy foam. The aroma seems rather mild, mostly floral hops. The taste is weighted towards the hoppy end of the scale, but with a bit more than the minimum needed to balance the hops. The decent carbonation and hops combine to give a pleasing mouthfeel, very crisp. Aside from the slightly elevated alcohol, this is what US megalagers should aspire to, even though the thought seems like a bit of an abomination. But at $23 a case at Costco, the price isn't that far off."
"overall fairly enjoyable light german beer."
"I have no idea how something this bad could be so strong in the alcohol department. This is not the kind of beer I would want to get drunk on and even though the carbonation didn't detract from the taste, this wasn't something that I could down very quickly. Maybe I'm not up to snuff on my appreciation of this style but after seeing how low this was rated on here, I'm thinking that this beer is about a big a letdown as they get."
"Overall, it is a great beer for drinking, but not for savoring."
"Overall this beer is easy to drink but doesn‚Äôt really have an interesting smell or taste compared to others in the style. It is too sweet overall with not enough malt heft or hop bitterness or flavor to combat the overpowering pale sweet bready/biscuitness. There are much better examples out there so this is a one and done for me."
"D/O- Blond Oktoberfest, Munich Helles, or weak Pilsener? By no means is this my favorite O'Fest; there's just too many other great examples out there. I don't see myself revisiting this brew anytime soon. Prost!"
"Overall, this is an extremely boring, bland beer."
"Green Bottle Disease is likely to be a problem, so pour & leave alone for 10 minutes first."
"Quite a departure from the style, and an unsuccessful departure at that. The mug, however, is awesome."
"A simple, classic Oktoberfest. I would happily drink this again."
"I didn't hate this one, but the appearance and mouthfeel left so much to be desired that I don't think I'd get it again."
"O- Sorry Hofbrau this one didnt do it for me. The dunkels and helles kick ass but this one is odd for sure."
"D: Pretty much a one and done. Might be better out of a tap, but I won't be taking this out of a bottle again."
"D - Not a bad beer, but something is a bit of with this one in almost all facets... I could drink this again in the future if given no alternative, but I will neither seek out nor recommend... There are many better Marzens out there and I'm not sure this is a solid representation of the style..."
"O: The beer is easy to drink but doesn‚Äôt really have an interesting smell or taste compared to others in the style."
"O- Drinkabilty is good, but this beer looks pretty much like a standard Helles. It is actually almost identical to Hofbrau's Original (maybe just a bit more ""assertive"" because of higher alcohol content), which failed to impress me as well"
"Draught @ Hofbrauhaus Pittsburgh: This one pours a clear, somewhat darker golden color. There was a good sized white head on it that didn‚Äôt linger long or leave any lacing. The aroma is lighter, with notes of malt, graininess and some spice. The taste is good. Malty, slightly earthy. A touch sweet with a hint of bitterness and pepper in the finish. Smooth."
"O - Not really what I was looking for in a Marzen, but I enjoyed it a bit more as it warmed up. I just had to put myself in a different mindset than the rich malty oktoberfests I had been drinking, and its not that bad. However, I must rate to style, and this one is not a very good showing."
"O: Goes down easily, ok tasting, not filling, mild kick, ok representation of style. I've had better of the style. That being said, it is a highly drinkable beer, nice flavor and perfect for tailgating!"
"O: It is what it is. easy to drink, no great flavor profile. To be enjoyed outside in the sun on a nice sunny afternoon, think I'll have another before the fog rolls in."
"O; apretty good example of the style but nothing to go crazy over."
"Lighter on the hops than some other Marzen, and the sweetness cloys a bit. Don't get the skunk other reviews are talking about. Middle of the road all around, but a good reference for the style."
"All in all, this isn't too bad. The aftertaste is a bit harsh, but it drinks very well. A nice thirst quencher."
"Bottom line: Not in my top 10 German beers; but would not turn down. Taste an appearance gives me the impression that this is the ""Coors"" of German beers (light years ahead of the American BMCs)...hmmmm."
"The supposed 6.3% ABV is about all this is good for. Oktoberfest-Marzen my butt, this really just a pale lager, and not very good."
"O: My first Marzen, so I don't really have anything to compare it to. However, not really what I was expecting from an Okotoberfest beer (weak in my mind). One plus I will give it is that it wouldn't be bad for a long, all-day drinking session, as it wouldn't be hard to put many of these away."
"(Notes from yesterday.)"
"My final beer of the night, one I missed out on a couple weeks ago in Chi-Town. It pours a clear pale amber-straw topped by over a finger of cream-white foam. The nose comprises light caramel, grass, flowers, and light orange zest (the aroma borders on mandarin orange). The taste brings in more of the same, though the caramel is even lighter now, the orange zest is increased, and some very light cinnamon is added for good measure. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda dry finish. Overall, a pretty solid O-Fest: not really the best of the bunch, but nowhere near the bottom of the pile. Good times."
"D-A very disappointing example of the style. I think this might be mis-classified because of the Oktoberfest branding."
"While I wouldn't quite call this an Oktoberfest, it is a delicious beer, and I would buy it again."
"Green bottle poured into a pint glass. This is a fizzy pale yellow: from appearance alone you wouldn't be able to differentiate this from the typical American pale lager. Smell is slightly skunky with some sweet brown sugarish undertones. Taste has a mild sweetness with a buttered biscuit flavor. Decent drinkability, but not much of a wow-factor otherwise."
"It pours a surprisingly light straw color compared to the ambers and coppers of most Oktoberfests and marzens. That said, it has a very good flavor. It's not at all watery. There are hints of grass, hops, and some fruit. It's light, crisp, and has a late, mildly bitter finish."
"recommended."
"O: Sort of disappointing as their helles is quite good. Might have to try to get this one on-tap."
"Pours a clear golden yellow with a 1 inch foamy white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Foamy bands of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, honey, and some grape juice. Taste is of sweet grains, honey, and grape juice. A mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good example of the style. A pretty easy beer to drink and I could see this fitting right in at an Oktoberfest event."
"Overall I guess it leans more toward the traditional style but the bitterness factor and skunk flavors really put me off. Pass."
"Dark yellow in color with an orange hue and excellent clarity. Poured with a dense, frothy white head with respectable staying power that left a few sticky lacings on the glass. Sweet bready and caramel malt aromas are dominant. Smooth, refreshing, delicate feel with light carbonation. Bready caramel malt flavors up front and through the middle with bitter hoppy notes toward the finish. Finishes crisp and clean. Very easy to drink. A very nice Octoberfest."
"Easy to drink. Probably wouldn't get again, maybe if I was at an oktoberfest celebration. Agree with review below about the girl on 6 pack cover..."
"O: Would probably like this beer more if it wasn‚Äôt a green bottle as you can taste the skunk. Overall, not too bad and pretty easy to drink. I wish it was served with the blond on the 6-pack."
"Taste-Faintly sweet at the onset,followed by a short pilsner hop bite. Not bad, but not what I expected from an actual German oktoberfest beer."
"Taste more like a Helles than a typical Oktoberfest, otherwise it's pretty good beer."
"Hofbrau Oktoberfestbier is a deep gold colored beer, very clear, small white head, a bit of lace. The nose has a distracting amount of skunk in it, topping a bland pale lager scent. The taste has me shaking my head, more skunk, a bit of a nicer malt profile than the Spaten, but not by much. Ugh, what the fuck Germany?"
"As said: quite strong as pilsners/lagers go. The flavour is ok, but it should be more complex."
"Overall, pleasant drinking."
"Pretty typical beer for this style. Poured a clear amber with a decent finger of white head. Light roasty malts on the nose, kind of weak. Generally malty flavor, light caramel and sugar, nutty, with a touch of hop bitterness. Light-medium mouthfeel and pretty drinkable."
"Drinkability: The more I got down to it the less I liked it. Maybe it had gone bad, although the expiration date was still 3-4 months away."
"This poured out as an amber colored brew. with a fluffy head that settles down a little after a few sips. The beer to me tasted much like any other German Pilsner. I was hoping that it would have had some other more festive flavors in it but I wasn't able to get much from it. The mouthfeel was medium to light and the smell was fresh and yeasty."
"On tap poured in a 1L stein at the Hofbrahusaus in Las Vegas and from a 12oz bottle numerous times. Pours clear light golden with lots of fine bubbles and a thick smooth creamy white head. Sweet malty aroma with some grassy noble hops. Medium sweet upfront caramel malty taste, almost like a mai-bock, followed by light grassy hops and a distinctive alcohol finish. Medium body very crisp and a bit creamy."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a dry, pilsner malt scent with a hint of Munich malt sweetness. The taste is decent. It has a crisp, pilsner malt flavor with a touch of Munich malt sweetness. It's quite simplistic and lacking in depth. These is a faint bready character in the finish. It goes down easy with some prickly carbonation and a bone dry finish. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a forgettable Oktoberfest. It's too bland for my tastes."
"A pale yellow-gold color (lightest of the lot) and pouring with next to no head. The smell is less than inviting - sweet, vaguely champagne fruity maltiness and potent hot fusel. Not appealing. These aromas concentrate in the flavor, with the sweetness near cloying and quite juicy. Acutely dry, stingy hot finish. Overall, a cheap, high-gravity malt liquor tone to this drink. A little more depth to the flavor than the corn-fed American malt liquors, but not much better. Disappointing."
"D - pretty good smooth anytime lager. It's a shame it comes out in fall this would be so refreshing on a hot day."
"d - easy...a 6 pack of these could be accidentally consumed. almost like drinking water, comparable to a kolsch."
"D- Excellent. This may be arguably the best Oktoberfest I've ever had, if not it is in my top three. You won't regret trying it."
"Picked up a bottle in a mixed 6er of Oktoberfests from Abe's Cold Beer. This is a simple, but tasty O-fest. I'd take this over Spaten any day. There's a spicy bitter finish with a hint of citrus rind. The malts are a smooth bready taste with a brown crust note. The aroma is less impressive, just a cheap, soapy sort of lager smell. Still, I'd be happy to drink a stein of this any time."
"D - Hell yes. Extremely drinkable."
"Drink- Pretty decent but not up to the standards of the other very good Oktoberfest beers that I have had."
"D - Very enjoyable oktoberfest beer. Would definitely recommend it."
"I had this last year and wasn't that impressed with it; after a year, my tastes haven't changed much on this brew. For me, it struggles with the basic test of an Oktoberfestbier: ""Would I want to drink a LOT of this in one sitting (i.e., a stein or MaB worth)?"" A big no on that one - the sweetness is simply too much, and there isn't much else to distinguish this brew from other Euro lagers to make it worth my while. I can drink this, and a pint isn't bad, but marking for the style, it's not one I'd pick up again."
"Overall, this isn't a very good Oktoberfest. Much better examples of the style exist and I'd seek those out rather than go for this one."
"D - One of the better Marzen/Oktoberfest brews."
"Notes: Overall it was a nice but an average Oktoberfest beer in my opinion. For me it was a little bit of a let down since I really enjoyed their Dunkel, Hefeweizen and Hells."
"On tap @ The Beer Engine. ¬†Served in a pint glass. ¬† ¬†"
"The beer features a¬†lower carbonation than I would like and a medium body. ¬†The mouthfeel is ok, but the finish is sweet and that looses point from what could have been at least one redeeming aspect of this weird bird. ¬† So, this beer is not bad. ¬†It's not offensive, and it's fresh and decent without the style guidelines in focus. ¬†But, to review this properly, I have to refer to how an Oktoberfest beer should taste, smell, and look. ¬†This just completely misses that mark."
"D - Extremely drinkable, this is a beer that is much better on-tap due to the lack of green bottle skunkiness."
"What a shame. This beer is from the home of Oktoberfest, but it just isn't as good as the Sam Adams I had earlier in the month... and I am still craving my Spaten. I would not reccomend this beer."
"Not a terrible pils, though still not great, and a rather ridiculous oktoberfest."
"Notes: I just bought this at Olivers in Albany (a single bottle, thankfully). It was out front in their ""new arrival"" or ""seasonal"" section. Looking at the code on the bottle, and given the taste, I can't help but wonder if this one was last year's edition - it says: L 139 J 08:24. . . ."
"This beer was served a light orange color with a nice finger of white foam adorning the surface. The aromas were a nice balance of hops and malts but in all honesty it was weak on both of them and didn't really remind of any other flavors at all. The taste had that distinct Oktoberfest maltiness, but as is more traditional it had more of the bite of the hops to go along with it. It's a fairly decent representation of the style as they are serving it in Munich, but I have to think that it's so much fresher having it there. It was a rather solid brew and I could have drank a few and sang along with the Om-pa band all night."
"Very yellow color with a medium fluffy white head that had some lacing but really off color for an Oktoberfest. The aromas were muted a bit but had a cornbread and honey like aroma. The flavors were light and crisp, but a little dull in comparison to that freshness note you get with the other marzens. Carbonation was spot on, though there was a slight alcohol bite that followed and made the beer have a dry finish. Overall, it was a good lager, but there are better example of the style especially when compared to it's German counterparts."
"overall this is a pretty good seasonal beer"
"On tap at Gourmet Haus Staudt. Clear and golden with a slight amber tint, this is pale for a marzen. Head retention is weak, but it looks solid otherwise. The nose is mild and malty, reminiscent of amber honey, apricots and fresh bread. There's the slightest hint of sulfur beneath. Pleasantly malty and clean on the tongue, honey and lightly toasted bread with a touch of stonefruit sweetness. Light bodied, dry and crisp finish with a mild grassy hop bitterness. Good, but not particularly special for the style."
"decent. just an average O-fest beer. pretty much a light bodied beer but with an above average alcohol content. taste is ok, but nothing great."
"Pours a straw-yellow colour initially with thick head that dissipates fairly quickly with some small lace on the glass. Aroma of of grassy and spicy hops with some bready malt. Flavour has some mild bitterness, but nothing too out there. Carbonation is a little bit too much for the style I think. An ok Oktoberfest, but there are better examples of the style."
"I liked the balance of this beer very much and it makes for an easy one to drink all day."
"Drinkability - I am learning, but for a 6%+ alcohol rated beer, i found this to be very clean and refreshing. I am most certainly impressed with the ""freshness"" this beer offers and could drink a few in a sitting."
"I poured this one against my better judgment. I normally NEVER drink anything out of a green bottle but I took a leap of faith. It pours a watery piss, straw yellow with a light white head. It smells just like Coors Light. The taste isn't quite as bad, but it's not very good. It's got very little character and is slightly sweet, as if they poored honey into a lager. The mouthfeel is very light and crisp. It has good carbonation. Overall this is a very poor Oktoberfest and not very drinkable. I expect better from Hofbrau."
"Overall I would say dissapointing. Very bland offering that I'll avoid in the future."
"D: A little tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, not the best representation of style, although this beer is a lot lighter than most O-fests it's a bit more poundable than most O-fests as well."
"A bit too high ABV, and a bit sharp bitterness."
"D- Very good beer for a cooler fall day. 2-4 of these in a sitting is a possibility today!"
"Nice sweet, crisp taste with a bit o' hops to balance it.A little light on the mouth. Very drinkable, thank god I got a keg."
"D- Not too difficult to drink, not hard to knock back a few of these guys and still feel good."
"Drinkability is great, and I would argue that the same is true of any Octoberfest beer, especially if it is served in a liter. Compared to the best examples of the style, however, this one falls a little short."
"Was surprised to see this beer pour a bright golden color out of the green (sigh) 330 mL bottle. Closer examination of the label reveals this to be an ale, rather than the amber Oktoberfest/Maerzen lager that one would expect from a beer by this name. Overall, it is a drinkable light-colored ale sharing some characteristics with a Koelsch, but with a noticeably higher ABV, greater mouthfeel and somewhat subdued carbonation."
"Hofbrauhaus Munchen Staatliches Hofbrau Oktoberfest--Munich Specialty. Brewed according to the German Purity Law. since 1589--2010 11.2 oz. Bottle. 6.30% ABV. 20 IBU's? (3.75 / 5.0) Foamy thin big mild lace white head. Clear bright light gold color. Mild hop floral malt mild dark green bottle Fest stank hint front. Fizzy tangy crisp mellow sweet fully fermented dry rich helles lager Pale Malt Fest body. Clean dry mild hop spice Fest end. Sampled 9/20/2010 from 6-Pack Purchased for $7.99 @ The Ballard Market, Seattle, Washington on 9/14/2010."
"This oktoberfest pours out a light golden color like a pilsner, the lightest october I've ever seen in the style. Smell include pale malt light caramel and nothingness. Taste is about the same, nothing to see here. Feel is light and lightly carbed. I drank it but won't again. If I wanted a malty pilsner I would of bought one."
"This beer is more like a pilsner than an Oktoberfest. It's very easy to drink, fairly well balanced and has a great appearance."
"D-Maybe it's me, maybe I'm not a fan of Oktoberfest beers, maybe this is just not a good example of this beer. I was just not all that impressed with this brew."
"D-not too many bad qualities but something about the after-taste means i couldn't drink more than one of these."
"Epilogue: What happened here? I was expecting to give a rave review. Hofbrau's Original is so tasty, but the Oktoberfest wagers little. I mean I have heard the expression, ""Play it safe", but come on. At some point you have to risk something. Try again, Hofbrau."
"It has a huge drinkability as it's like having sex in a canoe... f*ing close to water. Almost no alcohol feel/taste (which is OK since it's over 6%), but also not much flavor, some crispness, light sweetness."
"Overall - Not quite what I think of when I think of Marzen, but a pretty good, sessionable lager nonetheless."
"Drinkable, but not great. There's something cheap about this beer, and it borders on malt liquor territory. In the end though, it does the trick."
"For an Oktoberfest beer, pours a surprising straw yellow with a decent white head. Smell is of biscuits and fresh-cut grass. Taste is immediately malty and sweet, with that green-bottle skunkedness which soon morphs into an edgy bitter finish. A burning sensation lasts for a while after the sip, quite odd. Feel is perhaps a bit too spiky, and that suffers the drinkability as well. Always glad to try a new beer, but this is a weird M√§rzen.."
"500ml bottle from the Wellington & Bradley LCBO in London, ON. Part of the Fall 2010 Autumn Ales release (even though it's a lager!). Pours a bright golden yellow with a thin ring of bubbly white head and spots of lacing on the lager glass. Smell and taste are fresh cereal grains, bready and doughy malts, some skunk, toasted wheat, a touch of sweetness, light Noble hop bitterness, and a boozy sting in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is crisp, clean, medium bodied, moderate carbonation, spicy and drying finish. Drinkability suffers from the high ABV, especially for the style. A marzen is meant to be quaffed with ease, but this is a single serving brew. Just okay as an oktoberfest. I won't buy again."
"330 ml. green bottle no. L186J-14:18. Sampled on September 8, 2010. It pours a well carbonated pale yellow with a fizzy two-inch thick white head that lingers for a bit but fades away. Aromas of grains and some malts but little else. The taste is a sharp, grainy bitterness much like a pilsener. The experience was unexpected."
"Not deep or rich like American versions of Octoberfests, but still a good drinker."
"Added this to my beer bread recipe and the beer bread was quite nice."
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is strongly skunky with nothing else coming through. There is clearly something wrong with the beer, but if the brewer chooses to use green bottles, they deserve the bad reviews when the green bottle causes skunking. The flavor is not as skunky and I get some grain and corn. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Disappointing."
"i dont know whats going on but this is the second german oktoberfest i have had tonight that has not been as good as SA interpretation"
"This beer has a lighter appearance than I would have expected. Nice aroma, pleasant, but by no means overwhelming. The taste is a bit milder that other Oktoberfest beers I've experienced. This did not knock my socks off, but it was pretty decent for the year's first cool day."
"Notes: Definitely not a M√§rzen. For what it is, it is average at best. Not really that great, and really it is just a lower end German Pilsner. Green bottle no doubt lead to the slightly skunked taste."
"O This a beer worth having, but like all Hofbrau beers I'm left thinking it could have been so much better. It simply lacks character. More malt, more hops, more body...give me something! 3"
"Crystal clear straw yellow with a short white cap of fine bubbles. Spotty lacing, decent head retention. My first impression is not very good -- this looks way too light in colour for a proper Oktoberfest. Very mild aroma, grainy malt, very faint toast and bread, hint of grassy hops. The flavour was similarly disappointing. The bitterness was alright, on the light side but with good presence, but the malt character was very thin and echoed the aroma. Slightly fruity, but mild flavour overall. The texture was decent, medium to light bodied with moderate carbonation and not overly dry. While I had no problem drinking a bottle of this, it's a poor marzen."
"My first Oktoberfest and will drink it again if i had the chance"
"Drikability - A realtively smooth, drinkable brew, however, the taste and smell are lacking. I would be willing to give it another try."
" Decent deviation to the style by a big commercial brewer. This is a rich Munich fest Helles....not a trasitional Oktoberfest marzen"
"D - In a pinch, sure. I would not go out of my way to session."
"Value: Not great, this should be a buck or so cheaper a sixer."
"Overall, my main criticism is for the average color/appearance of this beer. However, the taste and overall drinkability was quite good. Represents the style well."
"You can skip this one. I'll give this brewery another chance when I have the money because it seems like there could be potential."
"D: Fairly easy drinking, although the taste does not inspire me to pour another."
"D: I was interested to try an Oktoberfest styled beer, but this does not seem to tied over with me to well. Seems like a maltier adjunct to me. None the less the alcohol is not noticeable and it is somewhat refreshing."
"Three fingers of ivory head over a really pale translucent golden. Great retention and good lacing. Aromas are basic, with straightforward honey malt and grassy hops, rounded out with a bit of spice. Flavors are grassy and floral, a notable hop presence. Fresh and pretty delicious with all these Bavarian hop characteristics. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, meanwhile creamy and smooth. A nice brew for a hot day. Doesn't really scream ""marzen"" to me at all."
"Pours clear gold with plenty of large carbonation bubbles surging to the surface in tight streams. The head is dense and pure white, leaving extensive patches of glass all over the glass. Bready malts and subtle spicey hops make up the nose. The taste is very well balanced with fresh bread and cookie dough malt being kept in check by a backing of leafy, noble hops. The mouthfeel is full bodied for a pale lager, with a brisk carbonation level. The finish is straightforward with a long lasting, light bitterness."
"And indeed it also lists this as a leading commercial example. Still, it's nothing like what I'm familiar with for the M√§rzen/Oktoberfest style (then again, who should know better, them or me?) And it's likely nothing like what most North American drinkers would be used to either. It should, however, be something they find agreeable, if not pleasant. Never mind the colour and celebrate October as if it were July or August."
"Pale gold liquid with high retentionable monolithic froth (2-finger). Pleasant hop aroma essentially overlays malt sensations. Bitter taste is moderate, low carbonation, major grain tones, decent additional bouquet. Calm pleasant mouthfeeling, you won't never say it answers its ABV, good non-typical Maerzen, recommended!"
"Decent enough, but doesn't blow me away."
"Post review note - looks like the aroma can be a common trait. I'll probably skip this beer in the future"
"D - Nothing mind blowing here but pleasant throughout. Slightly exceeded my expectations then again I half assumed it would be skunked because of the green bottle."
"I'm usually not a big fan of stronger Lagers but I like this one quite a bit."
"Very drinkable beer. Mild and pleasant lager."
"A decent beer but amazingly boring. Wasn't fond of the appearance, very pale orange, fizzy head, no retention or lacing. Very macro-like. Smell was ok, dry malt, grain, nothing outstanding. Taste was about the same. Kinda macro-like. Grain, dry malt, straw, just kinda bland. Mouthfeel was light and somewhat crisp. Overall fine, just not memorable."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable beer and considering its meant to be had in quality it fits the role. Decent beer overall."
"Golden amber rock color almost like a liquid gemstone. With a thick 2 inch marshmallow like head that disappears quickly leaving minimal lacing on the glass. Sweet almost straight from the honey comb and golden fields of wheat aroma with faint spice but not overwhelming. Again refreshingly sweet with a balance of complementary spice and honey overtone. A malty and nutty nature make this a well balanced pick for your fall season. Mouthfeel feel is very light making this very easy to drink and refreshing. After drinking one it would be essential to reach for another to flush down some late fall pork with crackling BBQ."
"I'm really starting to enjoy the subtle complexities of these staple Germans. Still am rather confused as to how this is an Oktoberfest though, so my review is as if this was a standard German Lager."
"T- It has a smooth, caramel taste. Sweet. It has a slight spice to it. To be honest, I'm not sure this tastes much different from a regular Hofbrau. I would like to try side by side to see the difference, . It's a good beer, but not what I'm looking for in a Oktoberfest."
"Bottle: Poured a light golden color lager with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of grainy cereal with more dry notes then expected. Taste is also dominated by the cereal malt bill that is not as enchanting as I had expected. Body is thinner then expected with good carbonation. A bit drier and astringent then I was expecting with malt bill not as refreshing as expected."
"D: A couple litres of this in a fest hall could be trouble."
"Final Thoughts: As my first Oktoberfest, I am disappointed, to say the least. I was expecting a much fuller and much richer experience. I've had many a bad import lager, and while it is by no means as generic as they are, that doesn't make it good. I'd have to say my biggest problem, is it seems to be unable to decide if it is a sweeter malty beer or a richer hoppy beer. Thumbs down on this one."
"This beer pours a clear pale amber hue with nice carbonation that leaves a nice one finger head and some sporadic lacing,the aroma is definately very sweet and malty with only a little hop aroma in the background,it has an average mouthfeel for the style which lets it down in my opinion with the aroma definately coming thru on taste with sweet caramel malts first up followed by a slight feint hop finish but for me evem tho its very easy to drink its definately not the best example of this style."
"Medium gold with an orange tint; of shining clarity. Topped by a pillow of fizzy white head the quickly recedes to a thin coating over the body, leaving no lace behind. Grassy aroma with crackers, hints of lemon, and kiss of sulphur. A very faint whiff of caramel buried below. Tastes of biscuity pale malt with a touch of caramel. Sweet. A mild, but firm, grassy bitterness dries things out a bit in the finish. Approaching medium bodied, with spritzy carbonation. Not sure how well this fits the style, but as a strong pale lager it's really not bad."
"Clear gold/straw with a big, stiff white head. Nose is grassy with a slight sweet edge and lots of herbal notes. Surprisingly dry, quite grassy and somewhat spicy, with a big husky grain and a faint hint of citrus. Decent body has some heft and a sharp carbonation. Finish has a solid, lingering bitterness. Clean and drinkable."
"It's fairly smooth, easy to drink, a good beer, but a little expensive at $3 a bottle. But this a good start for the LCBO, and i'm hoping to see other offerings from this brewery in the future."
"Pours a light coloured body with initial significant foam. Aroma initially a bit repelling, but is normal after the bottle has been open, warmed up, and sampled somewhat. A bit of lace foam sits in the glass. Carbonation is deterimental, and adds to the drying out of the palate by the finish, and beyond in the aftertaste. Some malts, a hint of roast, some decent features. Still, all in all, 500 ml is too much, rarely have I said this about a German beer."
"It goes down easy enough to have a few."
"Has a somewhat thick mouthfeel, and a pretty drinkable and refreshing beer, but I wouldn't buy this one again."
"Being my first Oktoberfest, I wasn't all that impressed. The smell is funky and taste is lacking. The highlight of this beer, by far, is its drinkability. Highly recommended for sessioning, but nothing else."
"Huge disappointment."
"D - A bit below average for the Oktoberfests I've had this season. It's a fantastic looking beer but has a mediocre delivery in all other categories. I wouldn't ever pass up a free one but would never hunt it down."
"MF&D - a decently thick brew with enough carbonation, the only problem is that it isnt a very good tasting brew for an oktoberfest beer. this would, however, make an excellent euro lager."
"With my stomach full and my thirst quenched id have to say this was a good beer especially along with its atypical food accompaniments. I would have liked it to be a bit darker and maybe a bit more complex malt in the profile but otherwise a decent beer for the style."
"Drinkability: Very good Oktoberfest beer, with a nice mix of flavours and a impressive drinkability."
"Drinks slow, might buy this as a Pilsner, but this so riddled with flaws, why is any one still using green glass? Will try again, if I can find it von fass. Avoid this unless you KNOW it's fresh"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly syrupy feeling, medium carbonation. Flavour is a little better but still not a very good marzen. 0 for 2 tonight it looks like."
"For some reason I imagined that Hofbrau's Oktoberfest would have been one of the greats for the style, but I'm sadly disappointed. This was crap."
"Overall - Not a good export beer. Although I haven't been to Munich Oktoberfest, I suggest trying it there instead."
"D- Very easily sessionable. Makes me wish I had picked up a six instead of a single."
"Despite the deficiencies in look and smell I d have another one"
"A decent lager just not the epitome of the Oktoberfest style. I can see it being quite easy to drink a few of these."
"Cheers!!"
"Medium-bodied with ample carbonaton. A good, crisp and clean beer. A drinkable beer and much better than I expected after the pour."
"I enjoyed this one quite a bit. Clean, crisp, and flavorful."
"I will have to try this again as the first beer of the night some time. If I do, I will re-review. But, I don't think I'll actively seek this out."
"This is an excellent quaffer even at 6.0 ABV. It goes down extremely well and has enough character and taste to keep your interest."
"Definitely not what I would choose when picking out a good oktoberfest."
"d- good drinkability, the most off-style oktoberfest in my opinion, but as a beer it was enjoyable, just not as an oktoberfest."
"Three beers down, one to go in the German Oktoberfest Invitational. See you tomorrow for the conclusion."
"Totally not what I'm used to in an Oktoberfest lager but pleasant nonetheless."
"Personally, I would take a pass with this and try out other offerings."
"It is a lot like regular Hofbrau, if you like that you will like this, if you are a fan of darker Okroberfests you might want to wait on it."
"On tap at the Schnitzel Platz - Glendale Heights, IL. Served in a giants-sized 2.0 liter boot. Poured pale gold in color with a tall, frothy white head. Aromas were sweet with some bread and caramel hints. Tastes were rather weak for the style - probably sacrificed flavor for drinkability here - some bready malt, slight caramel, little hops. It was worth it to say I've drank out of a giant boot, but this beer was lacking character."
"This beer has ""euro pale lager"" written all over it. I don't know how they can call it an oktoberfest: it pours a straw gold with a tiny white head that smells of honey sweetness. Taste is also honeylike with a light lemony hop. I'm a big fan of Hofbrau's maibock but this beer is ordinary and unexciting in every regard."
"D: This is a lackluster Oktoberfest. Pale, grainy, skunky...too bad. Lacks character and drinkability. Not really worth seeking out, unless you're a huge fan of the style. So many better examples out there."
"Poured into a glass. Beer is light and golden color, not what i expected for an octoberfest. The smell is lightly hoppy and grainy. The taste is quite refreshing, hops, yeast, some maltyness. The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing. This is not what i expected from an octoberfest beer but i was still quite satisfied."
"Re-review after reading Brewer's Association guideline for German-Style Octoberfest/wiesen. Changed taste from 2 to 5 an app from 2 to 4. 9/22/09"
"Pours a very transparent slightly-amber color with a small white head. The smell has some caramel and roasted malt with a tinge of European hops. The taste is somewhat malty and there are some faded pilsner-type hops. Mouthfeel is quite light without much going on. Low carbonation. Drinkability is quite low--too thin of a mouthfeel without much taste."
"MF&D - Crisp and easy to drink. Not bad, just not what I had expected from something labled Oktoberfest. More like a quality European lager (without the skunkiness). Reminded me of Sam Smiths Pure Brewed lager."
"This is unlike any other beer calling itself an Octoberfest. Others seem to use Vienna or Munich malts leading to a darker color, and more caramel malt sweetness. I am told that is because other Octoberfests became darker and maltier to adapt to the American palate, while HB has stayed true to style with a more traditional recipe. Don't know if this is true, but I do know I really like this beer, Octoberfest or not."
"Drinkability: All day...that's really all I need to say. Might not be the most popular style on BA, but definitely good this time of year."
"This was so heffeweisen like i had to ask and make sure it wasn't one. It had a slightly blurry color and a somewhat esthery aroma and flavor. In general a very good beer and a great seasonal drink, especially in the early, warmer octoberfest season."
"Pours a clear light golden color, fast fading one finger white head, not much lacing to speak of. Smell: import character, lightly toasted, grainy. Taste: sweetish pale malts, lightly buttery cracker, white grape, grainy, grassy/spicy. Not what I'm looking for in an ofest. The import character hurts here more than in a ""sturdier"" imported ofest such as Spaten."
"Overall, this is just okay as a beer, but not really in the same category as really good oktoberfests. In a blind taste test, i dont even know that i would have even guessed it was an oktoberfest to be honest."
"Average in every way. Nothing bad, but uninspired. Not the worst think in the world. Though I would seek this out again."
"D: This Oktoberfest is a little dissapointing. Not much flavor or character. There are far better Marzens out there"
"The body is on the light side of medium. There's a nip of crispness, but otherwise no real impression in the mouthfeel. Pretty tame."
"D -- Drinkability is definitely good, for a Munich Helles. Just a little disappointed in the Staatliches Hofbr√§uhaus on this one. I had a draft version at a bar that I thought was a little richer in flavor, but didn't take notes. I wonder if H-B pasteurizes their bottles, but not their kegs?"
"On tap at the Tyrolean Inn in Ben Lomond. Poured into a cool Hofbrau dimpled mug. Orangey gold color with a nice fluffy white head. Aroma is cereal grains, tangy malt, and a bit of grassy hop character. Flavor is similar, grainy with an almost citric tanginess to it. Mineral finish, somewhat watery. Really easy to drink."
"I don't know how this beer maintains a B+ average. This isn't a M√§rzen, it's just a lager. I guess this is the kind of Oktoberfest beer a Heineken drinker would consider a seasonal brew, but for the avid drinker this isn't the type of M√§rzen one expects. I don't recommend this beer for Oktoberfest, but it's not a bad beer by any means."
"Quite drinkable. But nothing really to get excited about."
"This is no Oktoberfest Bier. It pours a straw yellow with a quick disappearing head. The aroma was a mix of flowery hops, some dry crackers and a bit of toffee. The body was thin with little mouth feel. The tast was the same as the body, thin, slightly sweet with just a tinge of dry bitterness at the end. This so-called Oktoberfest Bier was, in other words, just a normal Industrial Euro-Lager with an Oktoberfest label."
"Lays straw gold and pale. Very little head to speak of and no lacing. Smell is perfumy and a bready grain. Taste is light in the malt department with some graininess. There is a good hop spice in there much like a German Pils. It is light on the mouth and light on the flavor for an Octoberfest. Good drinkability. Reminds me of the Weinhenstpehaner I had last week. Good just not what I would consider an Octoberfest."
"Drinkability: Not the worst thing I've ever had, but it's not something I'm going to get all excited about."
"D. A very fine Octoberfest brew here from Hofbrau house, would I expect any less. Just bought a case and its already depleted."
"Taste is of lightly kilned malts and floral hop flavor. Both have a tough time keeping up with the relatively high ABV. The beer is nice, crisp and fresh but I think I like all four of the other Hofbrau offerings I have tried better. Not to mention it is not very marzen-esque. Worth a try and certainly not a bad beer, but there are too many better oktoberfests out there to buy this one more than once every year or two."
"Drinkability: Not a bad beer, but far from my favorite in this style. I would drink it again, but it's not my first choice."
"the clear green bottle caught me off guard"
"A clear light golden color body with a thick short lasting white head , medium carbonation . Aroma of grassy hops, light bread dough and light skunk notes. Flavor is slightly sweeter than the aroma suggests , cereal grains , floral hops , corn lager , with a hint of honey and hey. Short dry finish,medium body with a crisp mouthfeel . Very drinkable but nothing special ."
"D: Not a bad beer, but there are better oktoberfestbiers on the market. You won't dislike it, but my guess is that you won't love it."
"Drinkability: This one is clearly made for drinkability and is a nice average beer for an evening out for dinner and good conversation with friends. While not challenging in any way this is a reasonably well made beer that goes down easily and it would be very easy to have a second, a third, etc."
"pours a bright clear golden color with a one or two finger white head depending on your pour. good head retention and a light wispy lace to the finish. smells of fresh cut grass with a slight herbal earthy note that turns slightly metallic after it's exposed to the air for a while. slightly sweet, slightly salty malt taste with slight hops noted and lingering mild after taste. mouthfeel was more to medium and carbonation strong. nice beer though the color threw me off because most i have had were amber to brown in color."
"Poured into a pint glass the beer is clear golden yellow. Moderate amount of head that dissipates almost instantly. Tiny carbonation bubbles float to the top of my glass. No lacing on the rim at all. The aroma is sweet grain and a cracker like breadiness. That's all I can pick up even with deep whiffs. The flavor is much of the same. Sweet grain with a tart fininsh. Salty crackers and sour corn. Biting carbonation that beats the crap out of my tongue. Medium body. Not overly impressive. I had high hopes for this beer. Unfortunately it falls well below my expectations."
"Drinkability: A slightly better-than-average Oktoberfestbier. Nothing too special but nothing to turn your nose up at."
"Hofbrau Oktoberfestbier pours a golden yellow with an off white head from a five liter mini keg. The aroma is grainy, not very impressive. The flavor is decent, malty, biscuit and/or caramel dominate. Decent, but not my favorite of the style to be sure."
"D = This is a very drinkable beer. I could easily see putting a few of these away at a beerhall."
"On the lighter side for a Marzen, but still good. Recommended."
"D - A top notch drinakle lager. Very crisp, very refreshing. Very intersting. I have fallen in love with this beer. Everything is right where I want it to be. I wouldn't change a thing. Cheers to Oktoberfest!!!"
"The beer is light on the palate and very drinkable."
"Poured a seethru gold body with one-finger white head that quickly died and left no lacing. A trace amount of caramel and roasted malts in the smell along with tea-like hop bitterness. Light-bodied and easy drinking, there are trace amounts of roasted malts along with caramel and heavier fruity hops. A rather nondescript marzen that is drying on the pallete and for some reason (I really don't give such low scores all the time) I had trouble finishing one. It just became more bitter and dry as I drank it and was not a pleasant beer at all."
"Honey blonde golden with a fluffy pock marked head that melts slowly and leaves blobs of sliding lace on the glass. Soft lemon with a big whiff of grassy euro hops and toasted grain. Tastes light and less malty than most of the style with nice mild hop bittering in the finish. This tastes more like a dortmunder lager than oktoberfest. Light medium bodied. A nice sessionable beer that seems a little light for the style."
"A decent Oktoberfest and a good beer for cold weather."
"HV"
"Pours a body that is a very clear yellow color, extremely pale yellow, with a foamy white colored head, lasting-ish. Has a malty aroma, nutty almost grass-like. Malty taste, nutty, lawn-like. Some fizziness. Not very good."
"No, this is not the most flavorful Marzen around, but if I were in Germany on a hot summer day, listening to um-pa-pa bands and swaying side to side with the other people at my table, this is probably what I'd be drinking."
"Overall, it's not the best Oktoberfest, but it's a lot better than the ratings would suggest."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow. 1 inch head with decent retention and decent lacing. There's a lot of suspended particles in this brew. Smells strongly of sweet/earthy malts. A little light in color to be a common Oktoberfest. A smooth, crisp mouth feel that leaves a dryness on the tongue. Tastes of malt with a lot of yeast lager taste. There's a metallic taste as well, that is not very pleasing on the palate. Overall, not that great at all."
"Overall, if you're contemplating picking this up, save a couple bucks and buy Heinekin or Beck's. This is almost dead on Beck's."
"M&D: surprisingly smooth on the palate, way less fizzy as the appearance suggests, while the flavour comes at an equal level as the body, about medium to full. Overall I find this a well-crafted and deliciously malty strong Helles lager balanced by an impressive input of German hops. In a sense, this is a super-quaffable lager to me, thanks to the lovely hoppiness and a soft texture."
"Bright gold pour with a fizzy white head. Metal, caramel, sugar, and grass in the aroma. Butter, wheat, malt, and a slight Heineken hop skunkiness. Look, I know this beer is not supposd to be as full-bodied as the others as this is to be drunk is large quantities at Oktoberfest. I just wish it tasted better."
"Drinkability: This is very sessionable, I wish I picked this up in the earlier months because I overlooked it too much. This one is easy to drink, smooth and satisfying. For the last October for the year, I'm going to miss them, but I'm glad I had this one to top off some great Marzens I've had the pleasure of trying this year."
"For what it's worth, I think this is a great ""fall"" beer. It's got a nice, full flavor and it's pretty crisp. I don't know how I would describe it as an ""Oktoberfest"" beer, though. If I recall, I thought those were supposed to be a bit thicker/more dense. That's not the case with this beer, but it's still worth checking out."
"This is not what I have come to expect from an Oktoberfest. I can not find any of the toasted, nutty, malty quality as in most Oktoberfest brews. Instead I'm thinking of an uber pilsner. Flavor is crisp and light, making this one drinkable and worth a try even if it falls short of the style."
"Not bad, but a little to sweet for my liking on this style."
"It has a straw brass yellow body which is weird for a Marzen from Munich. The head is just barely off-white. It smells sweet and grassy and maybe just a little skunk. It has a grainy and oddly sweet taste that is followed by a great but mild hoppy flavor. It has an average thin mouthfeel."
"Mouth: Sweet and bready, finishing dry with mild spicy gentile hops. Medium body with a very soft mouth sensation. Serving type: on-bottle"
"Drinkability: I hate to say it but this is an abomination of the style; steer clear"
"D: Very drinkable beer, but not really one of the best oktoberfest beers out there. The flavor is fine but it doesn't seem as dark and rich as a lot of the other beers in the style. Drinks more like a standard lager to me with maybe a bit more sweetness. Would be great for tailgating though."
"Decent, but not spectacular for the style."
"Pours a golden, clear sunshine with an argueable toasted hue. Not much ofa head, but sme good bubbling. The color makesno distinction between an octoberfest and a german pilsner. Hardly any toasted malt flavors in this beer. No sweetness, and a lot more tetnanger hops than should be. Crisp palate, but no sweetess or sooth. Very dissapointed."
"I was very disappointed with this beer, especially since my favorite beer is Hofbrau Dunkel (on tap). I'm not sure if it is because of light/heat damage, but I had to force myself to finish two bottles (the other four went down the drain). The thick carbonated head and citrus smell quickly gave way to pure skunk and bitterness, with a horrible aftertaste. I assume that I just got a bad six-pack. On the brighter side, I'm going to the Hofbrauhaus in Munich in two week's and will try one on tap to give it another chance."
"D - Drinks closer to pilsner urquell versus an oktoberfest. Not very drinkable for an okto."
"The taste was a little warming and started with sweet malt followed by a hoppy dry bitterness. A beer that is made for drinking in half liters, it becomes well."
"Taste is not as sweet as the smell would expect. A light pilsner maltiness. This beer is subtle in it's character, mostly malt driven. Clean fermentation. A short, dry aftertaste."
"d) Could put a couple away, quite moreish"
"Overall it's a decent beer and the slight skunk didn't derail my enjoyment."
"D 3.0, I would drink this, I like it, but it is not my first pick for a Marzen/Ofest beer."
"Pours a golden amber, decent white head. My total impression is that the brew is on the side of a plain jane - aroma is subtle with gentle notes of spices. Quaff is also along those lines, it does have a bit of a hop kick in the finish, but overall well balanced - although kinda weak. Nothing outstanding with this brew, but easy drinking in the cool fall weather."
"Drinkability: Crisp, light and refreshing with an unoffensive taste, albeit odd. I do like some deviation from the style in beers, but this one seems to be jumping ship completely. Still, I could have a few of these with ease."
"D-Fairly high, it's a nice brew that I have no trouble drinking."
"Good carbonation, this is a fairly crisp and refreshing beer that is certainly drinkable. But... but... it would not be a standout in any style, let alone Oktoberfests, from which I expect different things (not that they should be or are carbon copies)."
"For a Helles Oktoberfest, this is pretty good."
"The taste is similar, zesty, sweetly and spicly alcoholic raisin and grape with a creamy butter quality, a lot of bread and some hay and grass, hints of grain, grass, herbs, lemon zest and pear. It's zesty, with great balance and a finish that's tingly, zesty, lightly bitter with warm alcoholic bite."
"Pours a very light golden color, similar to a blonde ale or dare I say American Macro. Has zero taste to it at all and is just way too thin in the body and has average drinkability. It'd be hard to tell this from a Beck's or St. Pauli Girl, it's just that run-of-the-mill. I'm sure there's a lot of history with this beer but it's a big miss for me."
"D- Not a bad brew, but I feel it is lacking in the malt department for an Oktoberfest."
"This poured a clear light gold with white head. It smelled like lemon hops and cultured yeast, almost like a tripel, but with earthy caramel and nutty malts. It tasted like copper and lemon hops, with cultured yeast and a bit of bitter apples and barley malt. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was clean and drinkable, but it was certainly not the best tasting beer. It needed more classic European malt to give its character more depth and balance."
"D: I rate the drinkability very high on this beer because of all the great flavor, and the average alcohol content. Score yourself a case before I buy all of them up!"
"Drinkability: Not very impressed with this one. I was expecting something more."
"D: This is a really easy drinking beer that I don't have a problem drinking but there's definitely better beers out there"
"Smell is slightly grainy but pretty weak. Taste is similar. This seems more like a german pilsner than an festbier. Mouthfeel is medium light, no complaints. Drinkability is moderate, I wouldn't go back for another one of these but if it was offered to me I would never turn it down."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- While the carbonation is aggressive, it really is perfect for the sausage... lifting the grease and fat from the tongue and leaving a gripping, dry bitterness for the next sip. The lighter body of this example really adds points for drinkability, and this will absolutely be a contender for the upcoming all-day festivals for this season."
"A nice malty lager, a little less ""festive"" than I expected."
"D: If you are on a quest to consume all the Octoberfest beer you can get your hands on this fall (my personal goal), then by all means drink away. If you are looking for a good beer, pass it over."
"Good beer ya."
"I paid ten bucks for six of these? Oh well, it's better than Corona."
"v: oz3 al4 3.85"
"Overall, this beer is not bad and I could drink a few, but I am confused as to where the ""Oktoberfestbier"" part comes into play. Give it a shot if you have the chance."
"D: Very drinkable. A solid choice for the style. Had a liter during the keg-tapping at the Hofbrau House in Milwaukee."
"D: A nice session beer, but there are much better examples of this style out there."
"I could drink this all night. No body, no flavor, to texture. Carbinated water mixed with alcohol. However I do not believe this to be a good representation of this style."
" A drinkable beer; certainly not near the best. I would call this mediocre, but a fine beer for an outdoor festival with lots of people milling around. I don't think I would ever consume it at home."
"Thin bodied with moderate carbonation and good clarity."
"Personally, I'm not really a big fan of this lighter fest style. If I want a helles/spezial/export/etc. there are plenty of good offerings, and most fest tents already have them. When I want a Marzen/Oktoberfest, I'd prefer the original style. There's nothing inherently wrong with this brew when categorized properly, but when they scale back a style I enjoy, it's almost like a conflict of interest."
"Overall, this is not a great example of the Oktoberfest style. It isn't much different from any other light German lager."
"D: An easy drinker for sure but a total miss style wise for me. Glad I only grabbed a single."
"Fairly ordinary beer with even its best attributes compromised, this is not a very good Oktoberfest, with so many others besting this all around."
"M + D: Crisp and refreshing, fairly straight forward. Not too bad, but among the style choices, not anything extraordinary."
"Not bad..."
"Not as malty as I would like in the nose or flavor. Lighter color than most Oktoberfest beers, not much in aroma, but drinkable."
"D: Overall I was a tad bit disappointed by this. The flavor was rather bland. Theres a good herbal hop bite in the end, which is one of the few highlights of this beer. Drinks more like a festbier."
"Poured a golden/yellow color with a white head that didnt last too long. Aroma had a bit of skunk to it. Also was kind of grainy with a bit of alcohol to the nose. Flavor was malty with just a small bit of hops coming through. Not much lacing. Mouthfeel was a tad thin. Drinkability was ok. Decent beer."
"Hmmm... mine came in a green bottle and was slightly skunky. I'm pretty sure somebody poured a heineken or red stripe into this hofbrau bottle, b/c that is exactly what it tasted like. Nothing like an Oktoberfest/Marzen I've had before.. Looks and smells like a pale lager. Some yeastiness, some light malt and faint bitterness, and while not offensive aside from the light skunking, this is a horrible example of the style and not worth getting at all."
"D- not being a huge fan of marzen beers, i gladly accept this change though i have no idea whether it's authentic or not. it's sooo german so it must be. being fortunate enough to get this straight from the warehouse was a plus."
"D- Run of the mill oktoberfest, i feel Paulaner is better, this may be a bit thin, nonetheless, its fresh and crisp flavours give it good drinkability"
"Pours golden into a pint glass with the head disappearing so quickly that I didn't have a chance to notice it's qualities. Smells a bit of skunk at first then some grains. Taste redeems the beer somewhat after the lackluster effort in the looks and smell department. You get some grains, bolder than expected malts and some yeast with a little honey sweetness as it goes down. Not your typical Oktoberfest, but might make for a good summer session beer to replace a less tasty lager that you've become bored with. Then again, it might not."
"I'd have another."
"Tastes like a lager and goes down very smooth, just as smooth as Bud Light but with flavor that doesn't fizz in your mouth. It's just an outstanding beer to drink easily. It has flavor but it's more of a subdued one and the best comparison I can make would be to a light lager but that isn't fair to this beer since it goes down even smoother than those do and doesn't feel heavy at all. All in all, I wish I had bought more of this beer to store because I'm going to have to wait until next year to buy some more!"
""
"I poured this strange beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was very pale and did not look at all like a Octoberfestt beer. It poured a fine white bubbly head that decayed rather quicky. lacing was non-existant. The beer smelled skunky and sweet. Taste was not bad though. It was light and reffreshing but not very Octoberfestish at all. I would buy again but not in the fall !! This is like a summer beer."
"Definitely not the best Oktoberfest out there, but not bad at all - At least on tap."
"The bottle: Pours with a quickly fading fluffy white head. Smells of Munich malt and Haller hops with an almost skunk but not quite. The Malt really comes through in the flavor, and the hops take the back seat. Overall a great session beer."
"Disappointingly green bottle pours out a tarnished golden body with a small, loose, off-white head that doesn't last long. Skunky hops over honey-covered biscuits and cookie dough. Spicy hop bitterness up front. Cookie dough and apple malts mid-palate. Apple sweetness crescendos into a slightly skunky, spicy hop finish. Moderate body with a slightly sticky feel. Probably better fresh at the hofbrauhaus!"
"D: Easy to put back, but it doesn't exactly leave me wanting more."
"D - This is a fairly average oktoberfest. It smelled and looked like an average Euro Pale Lager, but it tasted better than that."
"Drinkability: This is meant for mass consumption at an Oktoberfest, and I think it would be perfect for a party. In fact I'm going to check into getting a keg of this for my next get-together..."
"I was disappointed when I first poured this. Lighter then other Oktoberfest beers that i have had. A dark yellow. Then the smell also seemed a bit skunky. However when I tasted it I was surprised again. It has a nice balance, however not as sweet and malty as some other Oktoberfest beers. Mouthfeel was light, but consistent with the rest of the beer. The drinkability was alright as well. Overall I probably won't seek out this beer again as there are better Marzen out there, mainly Paulaner, and Hacker-Pschorr, but I probably wouldn't turn one down if offered."
"Pours out a medium toned honey with sufficient bubble action and a thinnish white head with quite a lot of staying power. Leaves some streaks of thick lace. Smells of light, cracker maltiness, faint sulphur/DMS, and a bit of earthy hops. Flavor is rather straightforward, clean, malty, bready, and with a nice touch of finishing bitter. Sweetish overall with a simple syrup flavor somewhere in there. Mouthfeel is light in body, but a bit sticky, and the carbonation is a bit too obtrusive. Solid overall, but I'll spend my money on other Oktoberfests in the future."
"Out of a green bottle it pours a golden, straw-like color that is more reminisant of a macro lager (Heinieken or Pabst) has a quick disappearing head. Smells grassy, not malty, like a summer lawn mower beer. Unfortunatly, I can already smell the skunkiness from the light polution. This taste more like a Macro German lager than a Marzen. Comparing this to other O'fest (Hacker, Spaten, Paulaner) this is weak. Has some hop to it, but little sweetness. Mouthfell is fair. High carbonation, leaves the palate dry. Overall as an O'fest I am not a fan. As a lager, this is not bad. This is a high quality lawn mower beer. I'll atribute some of the faults to the green bottle, hoping this is better on tap. Not my first or even second choice as a Marzen."
"Recommended¬Ö"
"I'm a little disappointed. I expect more from German beer. Perhaps the stupid green bottle had something to do with it. Light polution, again. The appearance wasn't up to the usual German standard. It looks like a slightly-darker Budweiser. Not much head. The smells consists of hoppy and malty skunk tail (green bottle?). The taste seems a little bitter and it the beer seems a tad overcarbonated. I'm sure this beer is MUCH better when drank from a giant Oktoberfest mug in M√ºnchen, Deutschland. I've got to believe that this beer is better and that I just got a crappy six pack."
"The carbonation is quite strong. Large bubbles. The liquid is creamy."
"Overall- IMHO this makes for a great pilsner, but it seems a bit mislabled as a Marzen. This seems close to the style of beer that tends to be served in the Oktoberfest tents, but I was expecting a more traditional Marzen when I bought it."
"D: A fair Oktoberfest, not a bad beer, but pretty average and standard, but I wouldn't have a problem drinking a six-pack of this stuff, it's better than a lot of the stuff you're going to find out there."
"Not overly offensive, just very plain and Heineken like. Green bottles are no good! Not recommended."
"Okay, but not really what I want when picking a M√§rzen. Seems to be a helles-like beer with a bit of additional bitterness and hop flavor. The malt does come out a bit as it warms, though, but it still needs more."
"Pours an almost straw like golden color with an average white head, rather dissappointing for an Oktoberfest. The smell is of grains and grassy nobel hops. Not much malt detected. The beer has a cracker like malt base, maybe a touch sweeter than their Munchen Helles, and a slightly bitter hop presence. Where are the caramel malts?? The feel is light and fizzy and well balanced. This brew drinks well and is very sessionable but misses the mark for an Oktoberfest. I don't see that much, if any, difference between this and their Helles."
"This is a pretty good beer, obviously meant as a session beer. It's got a good kick for a session beer with the 6% ABV, it warms the palate a bit... HALLO OKTOBERFEST!"
"The body is light-to-medium. Smooth. Inoffensive. This is a mild, easy drinking O-fest. It's an all-round lighter interpretation of the style. While this is decent, there are better, tastier O-fests to choose over this one, IMO."
"I guess Hofbr√§u's Oktoberfest 2007 deviates a little bit from the mainstream oktoberfest beer. For one thing it has a little higher ABV (6.5%) but it's also more plain yellow as compared to a the usual copper yellow colour of M√§rzenbier. The smell is citric and bready and with that dishrag whiff this kind of beer should have. The taste is bitter, fruity and with a lot of bread. There is a slight sweetness and a some alcohol too. Lots of carbonation. I had expected a thinner oktoberfest from Hofbr√§u but it's really fruity and similar to the Czech Starobrno's Baron Trenck. The higher ABV does the trick, I think. My oktoberfest favourite this year."
"Mouthfeel was thin and slightly carbonated, but not bad. To be honest, this serves as a decent Euro lager, something that's certainly drinkable if you want a lighter beer. But as an Oktoberfest it's unacceptable."
"This is probably one of the lightest colored oktoberfests i've seen. It pours bright golden, almost strawlike with minimal lacing. The little bit of head it does have disappears rather quickly. It has a sweet smelling munich malt aroma at first, but the noble hops start to become more apparent after a while. The hops give it a nice bite once it hits your mouth, but it ends with that malty sweetness. Not very fully bodied, but this makes it very quaffable. As a beer, it's amazing for session drinking. I could see this being my go-to drink for say, several games of beer pong, for example. However I'm disappointed inasmuch as this is considered a Marzen (allow me to be a slave to the style for a moment). I was really hoping for that dark, heavy roast and malt flavor for the season. Overall, a decent beer, but I've had better Oktoberfests."
"decent enough drinkability, and decent anough beeer, but i'm not sure what this is, it sure isn't an oktoberfest."
"Drinkability - Easy to drink, but I'd rather have other octoberfest beers."
"This beer pours unlike any other Oktoberfest I have tried, which makes me leery right off the bat. Clear dark golden color with a thick and fluffy white head that dissipates slowly. Lager-ish aroma of mild hops and malt. Light-bodied with hops and grainy malt flavors that don¬ít have much staying power. The finish is mildly bitter with touches of citrus. Below average across the board."
"This beer poured a clear yellow with a thick rocky head. The smell is strong of hops. The taste is initially bitter from the hops, but the sweetness from the malt is quickly tasted ¬ñ resulting in a nicely balanced beer. The mouthfeel is on the thin side and has a slight carbonation bite. I was quite pleased with this brew and find it light and very drinkable."
"Drinkability/notes: Well-crafted to be sure, but a bit of a disappointment for those expecting an Oktoberfest, as the label states. That being said, this is competently brewed."
"Quite drinkable and refreshing. Haven't been a big fan of this style, but could easily put a few away."
"Subtle aromas of the Marzen malts. ubtle flavors as well. A nice light, crisp easy drinking brew. Not too much going on but just enough that I could sit around and suck these down."
"Overall, this was not a good beer, whether from poor storage or poor brewing, I don't know. But either way, I won't drink it again."
"While you could session this beer I would choose a better beer."
"Overall, not terribly impressed. Drinkable, but nothing I would seek out."
"Kind of a burgundy orange color with a smallish white head, but nice lacing. Smells quite grainy and a touch spicy, but mostly grainy. Taste is light on the mouth. Sweet malts but they seem a touch muted. Smooth though and enjoyable. Bitter hops provide a dry finish. Some alcohol notes creep in as this beer warms a bit. Not the most robust or flavorful O-fests but one of the more drinkable, sessionable O-fests I have had, even with the abv level. I think tap must be way better than bottles for this beer and most Hofbrau beers."
"Light body and high carbonation in standard euro-lager fashion. Overall a pretty boring and inoffensive beer."
"Just an average beer. There are definitly better in the style, this one just had nothing to stand out. Good for a very heavy german meal as an offset in tastes. If you see this on a shelf, look for a different beer in the style."
"Malty/bready, a bit syrupy even, with crisp-tasting water struggling in the background. Overall, feels unbalanced, too much carbonation and a little too dull. Easy to drink."
"Pours a light straw color with fluffy white head that clings to the glass all the way down. There's some citrusy notes to the hop aroma. There's also some skunkiness there, damn green bottles. Tastes fairly dry with a lot of hoppy flavor, but not a lot of sweetness of any kind. Still very refreshing. Mouthfeel is heavy and sort of creamy. It sorta bubbles up on the back of the tongue, very nice. All in all a very drinkable beer, I'd get it again."
"D - Not reccomended. A decent beer but the alcoholic aftertaste very much hurts the overall score in this category."
"Like all the Hofbrau beers I've tried, this is absolutely unexceptional."
"Overall, it is very drinkable. Not the most enjoyable beer as it lacks some defining character, but one that you could sit around and drink for a while. Nothing offensive."
"Just be careful to get it OUT OF THE CASE as the green glass bottles will allow it to be light struck and ruin the aroma and flavor quickly, if the bottles are exposed to light."
"Overall my least favorite Oktoberfest brew, but it is fairly easy to drink."
"D- This beer has a fresh malt flavor but it is overpowered by the noble hop bitterness that doesn't have much depth. I like the malt flavors and if the hops were a little lighter or had some depth to them this would be a good session beer."
"Revisited this 10-9-08. Not good stuff."
"D: Rare drain pour. Could have finished it--it was merely insipid rather than offensive--but I'd much rather spend my time on something else."
"Pours yellow with a poor white head. Smells grainy, with a hint of apples, and some skunk is present too. The taste is slightly tart and sweet, with some bitterness, and some skunk and sulphur tones in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is suprisingly heavy, but not extremely so. Drinkability is decent despite it's flaws. Ok, so this is oktoberfest beer, right? This beer would pass for pilsner. Probably a pretty fair pilsner, but oktoberfest? This almost seems like a mix up at the brewery to me. I gotta give low marks, just based on style, not so much because it's a bad beer."
"Pours a very pale golden color with a thin head that dissipates almost immediately. Light grainy aroma with a bit of off-putting skunkiness. As others have mentioned, the taste is more like your average Euro-lager. I found the sweetness to be a bit too heavy, and the skunkiness was present enough to not be enjoyable. This beer is a chore to drink, I don't recommend it."
"D- This isn't what I think of when I want a Oktoberfest. This looks too pale and not very sweet. ABV is there but this smacks of Euro Pale Lager rather than Marzen. We shall call this O-Fest Light."
"12 oz. green bottle. Code on the back label is L152F 1121. Pours a clear golden color, with lots of tiny bubbles streaming from the bottom of the glass. Not exactly what you may picture for an Oktoberfest. Thick frothy white head holds very well. Slight sulfur and grassy aroma, along with pale, bready malt. Good amount of bready malt greets you, then gives way to a bit of herbal and grassy hops. A bit sweet. Pretty clean and balanced. Leans toward medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Very drinakble."
"D: Not bad, but not at all what I was expecting from the style."
"FOLLOW UP: I had a chance to try this on draft, fresh, at Hofbrauhaus in Las Vegas this past weekend. Far superior to the bottled version, I'm sure a lot of that is atmosphere (that's why I'm not fully reviewing it), but generally much better. Still not my favorite, though."
"Did they put the wrong beer in this oktoberfest bottle? It doesn't taste very special, it tastes like any boring bland beer. I don't recommend looking for this, if it is in front of you it is okay to consume, but it isn't worth going out of your way for."
"Served in an authentic half-liter stein. Golden yellow color with a foamy white head. Crisp malty aroma. Taste did not strike me a being a Marzen. To be honest I thought I was drinking a pilsener. Clean, light flavor, with a hint of maltiness. Fairly drinkable,but it tasted closer to a Stella Artois than an Oktoberfest."
"Good to see the Oktoberfests back in session. Though Hofbrauhaus' left me a bit disapointed. I was expecting a rich bready, malty, strong, flavorful brew. Thought the strength shined, the bready, medium-full texture, rich malts left me wanting more. Paler straw than expected, but the head retention and lacing is on par. Aromas of majorily grain and an estery fruitiness that was unexpected. Tastes more fruity and grain-like than that classic rich bready, caramel malt that I really wanted. The beer is left a little too standard-pilsner-like. The strength was there, leaving an alcohol flavor and mild heat in the finish. Just a touch of grain-bite in the finish and aftertaste."
"I'm really dissapointed by this one. Usually Hofbrauhaus has some nice beers, but this just doesn't do it. This borderline tastes like a macro offering. Perhaps this is the lighter oktoberfest that is served traditionaly in German, as opposed to the heavier version we get. Perhaps it just isn't that good of a beer."
"I really liked this, and would probably get it again, especially if it was on sale."
"Interesting take on the style. Much lighter in color than other German O'Fests. Not much aroma, but traces of malt. Taste was the most interesting item here. Alot more balanced than the usual German O'Fest, which are usually over the top malt. This one is very nicely balanced with some hops in the finish. Mouthfeel was a little thinner than other O'Fests. Good drinkability. I like this one, even though it is not spot on for the style."
"Appears a light copper with a thin white head leaves specks of lacing around my pint. Aroma has sweet apple notes with German noble grassy hop notes not the typical roastier nutty American interpretation of this style but okay. Flavor has a clean mild sweetness low hop bitterness but with some good hop flavor that grassy herbal character is great with a touch of cereal presence, I think I could drink this by the liter at an actual O fest much more so than the caramel malt infused versions. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied good sturdy carbonation flows smoothly. Drinkability is quality like I said not as complex as or quaffable as some but you could put a few of these away with no worries."
"Overall a very drinkable Oktober. Not as sweet as some of its German bretheren, which really appealed to me."
"This beer is just kind of blah, for me, so accordingly, I don't have much desire to drink more. Also, the smell is a bit off-putting."
"This is a good Marzen...mine might be slightly skunked (Damn! I wish Europe would stop using clear or green bottles)....I am not sure because normally I don't like lagers anyway. But when I get past the slight (and I mean slight) funk, this is very pleasant and I will enjoy finishing off the 6 pack."
"I guess I thought that perhaps a German Oktoberfest would be closet to the style definition. Either all the others I've tried have it wrong, or this doesn't quite hit the mark. Not a bad beer, by any means, just not what I was expecting."
"Pours very, very light colored, with a nice frothy head that dissipates in time. Way too light for an oktoberfest, or at least what I think of as an oktoberfest. Smell is quite hoppy, just this side of skunked, with a slight malt note that, at warmer temperatures, starts smelling more like rice. On the palate, sweet at first with the malts, but very quickly this changes over into some zippy hop characteristics, much more in place in a German pilsner than an oktoberfest. Overall, this one doesn't fit the style to my mind, and the execution of what's here isn't great either."
"Overall. This isn't my favorite oktoberfest, but is still solid and quite nice."
"A unique Oktober, and one that is quite refreshing. Solid beer, and one that I enjoyed thourougly."
"Worst thing about it is, it doesn't smell like much. Doesn't look like a typical Oktoberfest either. Looks like a pilser. Pours a decent head though...but it tastes OUTSTANDING! I was impressed with this one. Banana-caramel malts round this one out with a crisp, smooth taste. No metalic background, an outstanding brew here. Very malty and sweet and different than other Oktobers in it's own right."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer, and I think that it is a great representation of this style. I think that I was fortunate to get a pretty fresh example. I didn't get a lot of alcohol in the flavor, but there is some subtle warming after drinking...letting you know that there is some power lurking within this beer."
"Drinkability: I really can't say that much about this beer because there wasn't much going on in this beer. It was ok, but if you want a bottle, just be a little cautious because it's a green bottle and could have been exposed to too much light. Not a beer that I would pick up again!"
"lagers get pretty shitty PR and I think this beer redresses the issues in an ever so small way"
"Comments: This was an average Oktoberfestbier. I've had many better, but I think a lot of the problem with this one was its freshness. I questioned its freshness, but there was no date on the bottle to tell. I think this would be a much different beer had it been sampled in Munich fresh. By the time it made it to my LBS, it tasted sort of tired...."
"D - Good flavor, easy to drink. Not far off from Hofbrau Original. Not what I expect from an Oktoberfest, but a good solid beer."
"Hofbrau Oktoberfestbier, to beat a dead horse, is a lousy example of the style. I wouldn't have picked it as an Oktoberfest if given five guesses. In spite of all that, the only thing that matters is whether or not it's good beer. As far as I'm concerned... not."
" This is a beer that grows on you. I can definitely see pounding endless giant steins of this next time I'm in Munich."
"Drinkability is good an enjoyable beer nice and refreshing even if it is a little lighter then it should be. Thanks go to merlin48 for this sample."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Hofbr√§u Munchen Oktoberfest is another one of the beers served at Munich¬ís Oktoberfest that is available here in the U.S. It comes in a green bottle, which normally isn¬ít a good sign. The appearance once poured threw me off as well. It was a pale golden color that appeared (and smelled) much more like a pilsner than the more common coppery-hued Fest brews. However, the taste was amazingly complex and enjoyable. It was tangy, with honey sweetness, tea-like tannins providing a contrasting earthiness, and decisively German hops providing a mildly bitter finish. The tiny bubbles of carbonation danced in my mouth, and the result was altogether quite impressive. I can only imagine how much better it would be straight from the tap in Munich."
"Overall, the Hofbrau is drinkable in the sense that it's gentle on the palate and is flavorful enough to be mildly enjoyable. My two reviews have generally not been kind to this, and I don't see a need to revisit for a third. I might try again if on tap, that's it. There are other Oktoberfests available (even locally) that I vastly prefer over this one."
"overall, an enjoyable brew. didnt make quite the impression that the paulaner did, but enjoyable none the less."
"12 oz green bottle pours a clear, pale yellow body with a one inch white head. Retention is fair, and there are some streaks of patchy lace left on the glass. Aroma is hoppy for an O'fest, with spicy and floral notes dominating a subdued caramel malt base. Mouthfeel is light bodied, with considerable carbonation and a slight hops bite. Taste is somewhat like a pils or helles, with a dominant floral bitterness. Caramel maltiness is very understated. Not exactly to style, but very drinkable. No skunky character from the green bottle, thankfully."
"Pours a golden yellow color, looks a little weaker than I had expected. The nose has a malty presence, maybe kind of grassy or grainy, and I'm actually pulling some hops scents out of this one as well. The taste is great. Malty and quite hoppy for an oktoberfest. I'm not sure it tastes true to its style, but beer-for-beer, it tastes pretty darn good. Pleasant aftertaste as well. The mouthfeel is good, nice carbonation. It goes down the hatch pretty well too. I'm impressed with this beer, and I really love the flavor. I'm sure its not a good example of the style its supposed to portray, but its refreshing and tastes good nonetheless."
"For me it was an average representation if not slightly below average. Still very drinkable and enjoyable."
"I'd like to try this one from a keg, or at least a light shielded bottle...but as this was a ""guaranteed"" fresh sample I just cannot rate it higher even though I can sort of see what this beer wants to be."
"The mouth is decent with good carbonation. Very easy drinker. While this may be a bit on the light side and an example of the new style Oktoberfest, it is still very tasty and well done."
"Overall Impression: A fine beer, very drinkable, clean, well crafted, just not very festive. Thanks to Pegasus for the sample."
"Best before 08-06-06. White head and clear golden beer. Nose has good maltyness, litle lemon/sour orange like yeastfruit and low hopnose in the back completing the overal fresh nose. In taste malt is dominating giving it a full flavour. Alcoholic and dry caracter but with sweet hint from maltyness. Mouthfeel is great as almost all ""real"" Oktoberfestbeers from Munich are; ultra clean and good but not to high carbonisation but with full hoppy and malty taste. Drinkability is then off course also fine IMO."
"Overall, I'd say this is a pretty good beer, and one that I'm sure I'll have several of."
"one high point is it does taste good for a lighter type ale."
"The color is honey golden with a nice level of carbonation. The head is average-sized and creamy white. The aroma is of sweet grainy malts, seems more like a mixture of German pils and helles aromas than the maltiness of an marzen. The taste is of lighter bodied malt sweetness with grain flavor running throughout. A touch of minty hops gives this a little more personality. This seems more like a ""big"" helles than an true O-fest. Not bad at all, but don't expect a big, bready marzen."
"The first of what will be many Oktoberfest beers this year. Poured out to a medium yellow color with a 1 1/2 inch head. Some minor and unconformed lacing in the glass. Odor was slightly skunky, but that is not unusual for the style. Malt, watery sweetness and some light cooked hops were present. Taste was very nice. Quite palatable. Flavors of malt, grass, and hops were present, as was a slightly bitter character. Finished smooth, with a note of bitterness and some dryness. This could be a easy pick for a session oktoberfest. Recommended."
"Overall I was very disappointed with this (my first this year) Oktoberfest. I guess I expected MUCH more malty backbone and a touch of caramel toasted sweetness - none to be found. I have to give credit to the cleanliness of this beer though. To think I picked this over a Sam Adams O'fest. Oh well, it's gotta get better than this."
"Pours light yellow/golden, minor head and lacing. Nose is toasted malt. Not the most exciting style for me. This one has less malt and more hops then expected. Notes of spicy honey and maybe some melon. Balanced and quite drinkable. Quite full bodied. Reasonably enjoyable sessioner, fairly tasty brew."
"This is pretty good bread in a bottle."
"Very drinkable, not what I expect an Oktoberfest to be like. More Helles like. Pours a clear gold, medium size white head and light in carbonation. Nose shows yeast predonimately with some malt. Flavor is yeasty and malty both, lacks the malt sweetness of an oktoberfest. Flavor is very clean, but not what I expected."
"Poured a light straw colour. There was a medium head which quickly dissapated. The beer tasted very sweet with a hop aftertaste. not a bad beer. Just not a great one. At least its cheap."
"Poured out dark gold in color, almost lite amber, aroma of malt very prevaulent, slight toastiness after warming, some toastiness in flavor with malt being the dominant, distinctive flavor some hop bitterness present but no hop flavor noted to me. Some what sweet after the bitterness subsides. Body medium to high, somewhat creamy, moderate carbonation. The head retention (being the two finger size or what ever the standard pour is) is low but it keeps a skim of head throughout the remainer of the session. Overall it is an one or two beer per session drinkable german amber lager. Recommend off the tap though, had it in Las Vegas at the HofBrauHaus there."
"This is an okay beer. I would not recommend it to someone who is trying to get their hands around this style of beer. If you want something by HB buy their Helles."
"Drinkability ¬ñ This really wasn¬ít a bad bier, but it¬ís not even close to an Oktoberfest."
"Poured a sparkling gold tinged with bronze. Green bottle and a tad skunky in the aroma. A little of the same in the initial sip, then it faded. Malt was promient, but a little thin. Fruity flavors - apple and grape, were noteworthy. Seemed to be on the lighter side of the style. Not at all bad, but I like Ofests a little more beefy in the malt."
"It's a very nice O-fest indeed. Plain and simple, but gets the job done, makes itself very easy to drink."
"Bought in the 12 oz bottle only says Hofbrau Oktoberfest..so I suppose it is the same beer. Nice sweet malt aroma, with a tiouch of honey for some reason. Pretty average in appearance for a Marzen a deep gold with a small white head...nice carbonation and lacing. Flavour is a caramelly sweetness followed by a tangy bitter falavour. Pretty nice and smooth on the palate. Overall a nice Oktoberfest to drink in quantity..but no were near as good as Paulaner"
"I was fortunate enough to get this beer on tap at Mellow Mushroom in Charlottesville, VA. It came to me with a slight creamy head with dissipated. The color was light golden. The smell was hops and malt with some fruit hints. Taste revealed a good solid malt base with some sweetness and fruity notes. A pleasant bitterness arises in the center of the tongue in the aftertaste. This beer left a good coating on the tongue. Definitely one I'd drink again if I have the chance."
"Pours a yellow color with a small head that dies off quickly. Very pale for a Marzen. The aroma was very skunky. Not much more. The flavor has some of the same skunkiness and caramel. The caramel is pretty strong, actually. Slight maltiness. I think this beer could be a lot better. Might have been skunked, but this is a poor Oktoberfestbier."
"This one pours a clear golden yellow color with a finger of head that falls to nothing. The nose is initially skunky like a heineken. The nose clears to be a bit grassy and sweet caramel. The flavor is definately grassy with a caramel tone that comes through late. The feel is just a bit thin. Drinkability is also just okay. probably the worst O-fest I've had his year, but give it a try, you may like it."
"Unfortunately, under it's current state, it's really undrinkable."
"Not a bad brew, just a different, less malt-driven, slightly more alcoholic presentation of the style."
"Sorry, I just can't get into this. First of all, this beer is colored like a pilsner: light straw yellow. Good head, but I am unimpressed by this un-oktoberfest color. Smells like an unpleasant pilsner at first (mass produced, yuck). At this point I am very disappointed in Hofbrau. However, as it warms, there is some citrus and even a little spice on the nose (cloves?), so I am pleased that there is something interesting going on. Tastes better than it smells, with the smooth citrus, cloves, and at the end, honey. Mouthfeel is quite pleasant, smooth, easy. However, I can't get into this as an oktoberfest. Certainly does not fit the style."
"Drinkability: Very good drinkability. I had a few."
"An ok, nice little helles perhaps. An Oktoberfest only on Bizarro World."
"This beer pours a clear, deep golden color with a thin white head. The color is a little lighter than a typical marzen, but the head does produce considerable lacing. The aroma has an expected, lightly toasted malt aroma, but also has a distinct hop smell. The beer is malty, light, and very smooth...this is extraordinarily easy to drink. Again, there's more hops in the beer than ususal for the style, but they don't hurt the flavor at all. Soft, and very drinkable. Quite tastey."
"The taste starts out with a nice honey, slightly sweet beginning that moves to an earthy hop finish that lingers for a really long time on my palate. Nothing too sophisticated or complex, but damn is that drinkable and tasty. It's just not an Oktoberfest beer as I know them."
"Clear pale golden color with a nice white frothy head that last, good lacing in the glass. Sweet, huge hoppy floral aromas, mild bready flavors, finishes with some bitterness. Medium body with a soft mouthfeel, seems a bit hoppy for the style, still a very tasty brew."
"Pours a golden straw color-lighter than many of the style. The head and lace are moderate at best. Aromas are all about the malt-sweet and extracted. In the mouth the beer shows good crispness and a medium body. Flavors ring true to the style, again with a good dose of malt. Worth a try though a rather restrained version of the classic."
"ng"
"Almost straw yellow with just a hint of coppery tinge. The head starts strong but goes down faster than a French prizefighter. Aroma is sweet and malty with a floral hop sneaking in. Sweet malty flavor with a very light bitterness. Not the best Oktoberfest I've had this year, but very drinkable."
"Sweet malt flavor with a grassy finish. Nice beer that reminds me of a German Pilsner. Not sure if I would get this again with all of the other options out there for this style, but this was enjoyable."
"I was really excited to try this beer. I¬íve been to the beer hall. I¬íve danced on the table. I¬íve sang with the band. I quaffed dunkel from a stone stein. That said, I¬ím deeply disappointed with this beer. The color was golden, not amber, or copper but golden. It does put a nice head on it, but no lace to speak of. The nose is hops, not malt. The taste is crisp with some malt sweetness coming in the middle of the experience, but this tastes more of a pilsner than an Oktoberfest. It has a light mouth feel, and is generally drinkable, but it is NOT an Oktoberfest. What gives? I love their lager and Maibock. I was pleasantly surprised by their Hefeweizen, but this is way off."
"12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a light gold color with half a finger of head. The smell is light and grassy, with saaz hops present. The taste is almost pils-like, fairly grassy and malty. The mouthfeel is pretty watery though. The drinkability isn't bad. A little off from the style."
"Pale golden hue with a huge, fluffy white head. Great retention and lacing down the half-liter mug. Quite subdued in the nose with some mild malt and somewhat of an off hop flavor. Flavor is a nice balance between sweet, caramel maltiness and a restrained bitterness that becomes evident on the prolonged finish. Full-bodied marzen lager, this is smooth and drinkable. Decent."
"Green Bottle."
"Zum wohl!"
"Had this at two locations in the last couple of weeks, so this is a mix of the two reviews. Golden clear color, aroma is like smelling a candy factory, with some floral hop notes. Nice frothy white head. Taste is a bit bready to start, there's some sweetness, and a grassy note from the hops. Not hard to drink, but not one I needed to keep drinking either. pat"
"Drinkability: A good session beer; smooth and easy-drinking. Would try again next year to compare notes."
"Apparently Germans have picked up on quality brews like... Kokanee. Not to trash Kokanee, as its often my choice cheap massive-quantity beer, but I was hoping for something more. When poured from it's green bottle it looked like a highly carbonated glass of apple juice. The head was big, white and vanished quicker than Trent Lott at an NAACP meeting. The smell is of... well, the main odor is that scent which most macro drinkers describe as ""beer-like."" I can pick out some corn odor in there - that's fine when eating, say corn on the cob, but its not welcome emanating from my beverage! The taste is similarly macro-pilsnerish. Very thin mouthfeel. It's drinkable, I supose, if one is not bothered by a need for flavor."
"Drinkability - I must have salted away about 5 or 6 of these during the game, so that speaks for itself. It goes down easily and almost too quickly. Even after several, the flavor is still right there."
"Hofbrau Oktoberfest: Well this is as close as it¬íll come to reminding me of my trip to Weis¬ín in Munich. Not a deeply colored Marzen, but rather a Crystal clear golden beer with a very nice and creamy head, and mouthfeel. Exceptional smoothness and drinkability. Fairly nice malts, nicely balanced with almost citrus-y hops. Nice and easy to drink, but I come to find out a fairly dangerous amount of alcohol in such a tasty, light and satisfying beer. Very nice."
"A crystal-clear golden body reveals just a few widespread streams of steadily rising average-sized bubbles beneath a bright-white foamy cap. The head drops shortly after pouring to a wide, creamy collar; yet it still leaves some impressive lace throughout the glass. The nose is clean and enjoyable but not impressive for the style with just some light grainy malt and a hint of alcohol. The body is medium falling towards light with a gently crisp carbonation. The flavor offers a clean, grainy malt that's nice but doesn't offer the richness of Vienna and/or Munich malts that the darker versions do; and it's well-balanced with a firm bitterness and spicy character (alcohol, hops, or both?) but the alcohol is a bit noticeable which is odd for a beer of just 6%abv. It finishes dry with some gently lingering malt and a touch of bitterness. A well-made, refreshingly dry helles Oktoberfestbier."
"Prost!"
"Pale gold or dark yellow, take your pick, as this is not impressive looking Octoberfest beer. A decent aroma with a nice malt sense despite the light body. The flavor is clean and crisp, but lacks Marzen sweetness. The body is a bit thin and unimpressive. This beer is a bit disappointing given its brewer's heritage."
"This Hofbr√§u M√ºnchen Oktoberfest poured a clear, golden-amber color, with long-lasting, creamy white foam. The smell was malty with elements of bread and biscuit with a bit of floral hops. The taste was malty with bread and biscuit malt flavors, slightly sweet (though less sweet than many other oktoberfest beers), and with some floral hop notes in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium body and good carbonation and with some sweetness up front but a more dry finish. This was a very tasty beer on tap and was very easy and enjoyable to drink. If you get a chance to try this on tap, do so."
"Pours very well, with a foamy German type head. Has a nice roasted malt aspect to it, which actually calls to mind a well-made Vienna lager (guess I don't have my expectations for the Okto style set in my mind). In other words, this is a pretty okay beer. The texture and mouthfeel come across like a standard American ""dark beer," which can get in the way of one's enjoyment."
"Light-golden in color, with a nice head off the pour, but dissipated in a short time. Corn and a bit of barley on the nose, with a yeasty, bready taste on the palette. Good, light mouthfeel and nice drinkability. I guess the problem with this beer is that it's not your typical oktoberfest. It's a much lighter style, both in color and in body, and doesn't have any malty sweetness or amber hue. A beer that I enjoyed, but if your looking for an octoberfest, look elsewhere."
"This is a decent, semi-generic euro-lager, but not what I'm looking for in a marzen."
"pale straw in color, no head and no lace.  euro skunk aroma with very little head and no lace.  this is an o-fest?    seems more like mass produced euro-crap with a hint of some munich malt.  this is not a bad beer in general but an abomination of an o-fest.  in fact it tastes nothing like an o-fest.  i'd have trouble discerning between this most other euro lagers.  nothing special."
"337"
"As other reviewers have noted this is at the extreme end on the lightness scale for Marzen/Oktoberfests: a golden body with a soft white head that lingers.  The aroma has some skunkiness from the green bottle, but there is also some spiciness from the hops.  The taste is mildly sweet, but the nice caramel notes are present for the style; the body has the appropriate carbonation and mouthfeel.  This is a nice oktoberfest beer for longer drinking sessions into the night."
"It is unbelievable how light colored this oktoberfest is.  I've had close to 20 ofests this year and nothing comes close to being this light.  It's a pale, pale straw color.  Reminds me of a braggot I had last winter.  This beer smells light-struck because it is.  It comes in a green bottle.  Skunky smell.  There is no resemblence of a ofest in taste either.  There's some of that skunky taste.  And after cutting through that, it tastes more like a light lager than an Ofest.  The skunkiness isn't overwhelming, thus I gave the drinkability the highest rating of the 5 categories,  a 2.5.  Not recommended."
"Pours a golden color (a bit light for the style), with a nice off-white, frothy head, with good retention. On the nose there is a sweet malt aroma. On the palate there is a steady malt flavor with a ever so slight roastiness, slightly chewy mouthfeel. Easy drinking, but could be better for a O'fest...still a very drinkable O'fest."
"alright, but by no means fantastic oktoberfest. i would have to say that this is one of my least favorite oktobers yet. it is still a good beer to drink. it goes down very well. a bit malty and sweet, it will be fine to throw back, but there are much better oktobers out there"
"A decent little beer, but for me it was a bit too sweet. Very sweet maltyiness, almost has a honeyed flavour, low bitterness, and lacks any bite to the flavour, quite good however, but yes, a little sweet, probably not the best example of the style."
"Very light malt sweet aroma that is quite pleasant.  Medium gold color that is a little light for style. Nice frothy head that has good retention.  Lighter steady malt flavor with slight roast characteristics. Dryness from start to finish, and lasts but is pleasing.  Somewhat full mouthfeel with it's sufficient carbonation.  Would be easy to drink several in one sitting and probably enjoyable too."
