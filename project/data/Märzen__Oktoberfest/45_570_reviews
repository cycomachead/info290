"Mild bread, malt, kettle sugar and spice aromas. Not much hop on the nose and no diacetyl. It pours brilliant copper tinted amber under a very lightly tan tinted 3” white foam cap that fairly quickly dissipates. Rich malt flavors with slight kettle sugar sweetness, grainy spiciness, no fruit, finishing dry with a moderate hop bitterness. High end of medium on the body with slightly below medium carbonation."

"O-  A nice octofest."
"O - The flavor was not as enjoyable as the smell but an enjoyable beer nonetheless.  3.5/5"

"Dark cedar with fine carbed head. Distinctive yeast. Toasted corn, balanced malt. My favorite US festbier."

"355 ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. A deep fiery red-bronze color with quick breaking beige head; some light creamy bubbles cling persistently around the rim of the glass. Aroma is rich toasty malts, raisins, brown sugar, and ethereal grassy hops. Faint whiff of grainy alcohol. Delivers some wonderfully authentic Munich malt flavor. I get brown bread, slightly tart fruit (almost citric or perhaps Granny Smith apple), sweeter dark fruit (raisins and plums), a touch of molasses and burnt caramel. Considerable malty depth, with a sturdy medium body and medium-heavy carbonation. Finishes semi-dry I suppose, with some lingering grass/hay, pepper, and orange peel (!) notes. Malts from the genuine source make all the difference here, along with tasteful hopping. One of my favorite widely available O-fests."

"Overall:  On its own, it was decent.  In comparison, this was far and away the least pleasing of the three I was tasting.  The herbal and apple notes and lack of richer sweeter bready malt left me wanting quite a bit."

"Bottle from Lazy Dog Macon. Pours hazy brown with white head. Aroma of malts, wheat and fruit. Tastes of bread with sweetness at the end. Notes of hops and toffee. Not that crazy about it."

"Typical Germany fall beer a little too yeasty for me but still bold and good."

"Clear ark amber pour with a small off-white head. Light toasted aroma with some grain and yeast. Taste is grainy with some spicy and earthy hops also present. Not much sweetness. Medium body also has a good yeast presence. Finishes crisp."

"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a above average example of the style, it had pretty much all the aspects that I expect from the style and in typical American fashion the malts were just a little more bolder than they are traditionally, but I expect that from these American made Marzens and it fit in well within the style.  This beer had good drinkability, It was smooth, fairly clean, crisp, not filling at all and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, I could drink more than a few of these without getting tired of it.  What I like the most about this beer was was how true to style it was, it was just what I expect from a American made Marzen.  What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, the head and lacing could have been a little better.  I would buy this beer again when in the mood for the style and I would recommend it to anyone who likes the style, it's just a nice example of a Marzen.  All in all I was happy with this beer, it had all the aspects that I was looking for and it came together to make for a enjoyable Marzen.  This is one of the better beers I have had from this brewery, but isn't a favorite of the style.  Nice job guys, this was a tasty Marzen, keep up the solid work."

"Appearance is clear amber and beautiful: Looks like fine cognac, very appealing and mesmerizing. The nose I detected cherry, a whiff of (blood) orange, herb even a hint of apple. Head is rich and frothy, with small concentrated bubbles that only enhance its bewitching appearance. Goes down with the fruit blend mentioned above, light crispness, on the dry side and a quiet amount of sweetness. goes down like a fine spirit. I keep thinking that I should drink this in a snifter than in my tulip glass (although a tulip glass can be mistaken for a snifter - and I do treat mine as such!). Ideal for roast beef, steak or shellfish. Good for any month of the year."

"The beer pours a fairly foamy head that takes a while to dissipate. The foam color is a tannish kind of color. The beer itself is a copper color that borders on brown. The beer smell is very bready and very yeasty with a hint of sweetness and hop notes. The hop notes are slightly bitter. The beer taste is a bit hoppier than I'm comfortable with but it doesn't detract too much from the taste even though it's supposed to be sweeter. Rather, the hops add an interesting orange note to it at the end. The beer taste also has various malt notes such as sweet and bready besides the hop notes. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth and a little bit light for an Oktoberfest. Very carbonated. Overall, an okay and interesting Oktoberfest.."

"A nice Oktoberfest offering from Brooklyn. Clean, malty, but not overly sweet. A nice head and creamy mouthfeel, eminently drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a nice amber. Short lasting white head completely dissipates. The aroma is mild and nondescript malt with a slight astringency. Taste loses the latter but keeps the former. A bit too much carbonation on the palate."
""
""

"Overall: A straightforward, drinkable Oktoberfest though somewhat light in body."

"I am not a big fan of Brooklyn on the whole.  That being said, I like the Oktoberfest quite a bit.  The only negative is the spice (clove?) on the finish.  Other than that the beer is a beautiful orange/brown cloudy color with a 1 finger head when poured into a goblet glass.  There is a fine mixed spice smell that translates nicely to the front half of this beer.  The one dominate spice on the back half brought this beer down slightly for me.  Body is solid.  Best offering by Brooklyn of those I have had - will seek out other new Brooklyn beers, something that I was avoiding in recent months."

"There really isn't much to say about this beer other than it didn't do much for me. It had no character that made me want to buy it again. The flavor profile left a lot to be desired. There are much better Marzen style beers out there. You won't be missing much by skipping out on this one."

"Auburn colored, nice lacing. Mildly nutty with a good dose of malts. Slight touch of metallic. Flavor is malt forward with delicate hop finish. Mild bitterness. Smooth carbonation, crisp. Pretty good overall. Not something I want to seek out but if it's there I'll drink it."

"I don’t know why I am drinking an Oktoberfest in March, but I had been saving this beer for a while and thought it might hit the spot right now. It is a good example of the marzen style- a style I am not usually too thrilled about and do not rank very highly on my list. But style biases aside, this is a good beer overall. The taste is better than the mellow nose leads you to believe and it does have enough going for it to earn a recommendation."
"Light brown colored beer with just a faint bit of white foam covering part of the top. Good clarity. Aroma of caramel and dark malt greets my nose. The mouth is a bit sticky and chewy. The flavor is of caramel, dark malt, and there's a nuttiness in the taste, particularly in the fade."
"O- It's not Octoberfish, that's for sure."

"O- A really nice beer and the first Oktoberfest I have had in a very long time, makes me want to seek out more Oktoberfests next year."

"Pours a beautiful amber colour with a respectable white head that has decent retention, albeit with limited resultant lacing. Grainy aroma has more caramel than I'd typically associate with traditional German versions of the style, but that's a modification I personally enjoy. Mild flavours are well balanced and again, not stereotypical for a marzen - lots of bread and grains, with some light toffee notes. Nothing that leaps out as ""spectacular", but an easy drinking beer."

"Brooklyn Brewery Oktoberfest (2013) - 5.5%ABV. Marzen style amber lager (brewed in March, stored cold over summer to lager, and then poured in September/October). Beautiful full head with thick lacing and excellent retention. Excellent amber red color with active carbonation. Full Oktoberfest lager aroma-- bread, caramel, and malts. Bold coffee and toffee front palate notes. Butterscotch and hops. Mid-palate a bite of lemon and pepper. Lager skunk hop notes with full fading into malty goodness. Back palate is a crisp hop note-- bitters and coffee. Almost a hint of stout. Good mouthfeel. Slightly wet, but full of flavor. Very drinkable. Full, complex, and well rounded character. Easily the best Oktoberfest this year I've had. Wonderful. A real classic marzen take on the style. Very well done-- bordering on excellent. 4.0 out of 5. Very good. Recommended."

"I love this time of year and I seek out as many Octoberfest and Pumpkin flavors as possible here in my little part of Carolina. This year I found some hits and some misses, Cottonwood pumpkin and Shipyard pumpkinnhead were delish, and then I came upon the Brooklyn Oktoberfest, all in all its an okay beer. I was a little disappointed in what seemed to be a lack of Octoberfest Flavoring in this beer. I would walk past this beverage in search of others..."

"Draught: The beer pours a rich copper color. There is not too much off-white head to it. Rich aroma of malts and some earthiness. Not too much hops (if any) to the nose. The taste is malty : caramel is the main flavor. Some earthiness and biscuit notes. A touch of nuttiness. This goes down very smooth. I really enjoyed this beer!"
"This beer is Too Sweet!!! WOLFPAC!!. Brooklyn Brewery.. NUFF SAID!! They don't brew trash..This Oktoberfest Brew is tha bomb best I have had..but who am I?!!! A beer drinker that's who!!

"Pours out a very clear amber with a thin head. Nose is toast, bready malts, and herbal, earthy hops. Taste has some toast up front, but that dies out pretty quickly. Lots of caramel in the middle with a good punch of noble hop flavor in the finish. A bit of acidity in the finish as well? Carbonation is lively without being too over the top. Tasty beer. Good job overall."

"The taste tends to be a bit better than the unimpressive aroma with a little roastiness and sweetness and a milder ESB-like bitterness at the end."
"Final Grade: 3.80, a respectable B+. Brooklyn's Oktoberfest Beer is a solid lager that delivers virtually everything I expect from a marzen - good malt-forward flavour with a firm German hop bill to counter it, as well as a nice, light, sessionable nature. A little overcarbonated for my tastes, and not my favourite Brooklyn beer by a longshot, but this is still one of the better marzens I've tried so far. Something worth picking up if you're in the market for a balanced autumn ale, and a great selection for my 499th review."
""
""
""
"Pours a 1/2"" creamy head that lasts about 5 mins. Smell is caramel, vanilla and a floral presence that goes deep into the back of your nose. Taste is well balanced between malt and hops. It's on the thin side but that's good, suggesting another. I like this beer and this style. I'll definitely get more while they last."
"O - A pretty decent beer for the style. It's got the caramel bread and roasted malt flavor that I've come to love, but like a lot of Oktoberfests, it's lacking in the mouthfeel."
""
""
""
"Dark amber in color with an orange hue and a heavy chill haze. Poured with a thin off-white foam that quickly dissipated. Toasted malt, sweet caramel, light toffee and dark bread aromas with pleasant spicy hops above. Smooth feel down the middle with tangy, assertive carbonation above. Grainy, toasted and caramel malt flavors up front with rye, dark bread and spicy hops through the middle to the end. Finishes crisply with a lingering dark bread and earthy, spicy hop aftertaste."
"Served in a 16 oz pint glass on tap at the Pourhouse, Westmont, NJ"

"Sturdy beer that's a tad sweet, but I like the assertion."
""

"O: A good Oktoberfest. Clean and easy to drink."
""
"It poured a dark copper that had caramel and roasted malts on the nose. The taste was heavier on the roasted malts rather than the sweet caramel malts that are more common in the German versions. As it warmed the sweeter caramel flavors came through, but the roasted malts were dominant. The Brooklyn Oktoberfest is a good American version of the style."
""
""
""
"O: An obove average Oktoberfest overall. I would choose this over other American Oktoberfest beers if offered on tap. As much as I would expect from a Brooklyn Beer, they have yet to dissapoint me."
""
""
"on tap at the screamen eagle in inlet new York. this is perfect opening sunday nfl beer. its not a light beer, but its real drinkable, its not an ipa, but it has a ton of flavor, and it isn't priced like other seasonal rarities. great by the pitcher. nice dense copper glow, short white froth head that lasts alright. I smell lager yeast right away, and a sweeter german caramunich malt type that contributes most of the color and fermentables here. simple but flavorful taste. dessert breads, honey, even slight maple in the finish. I still think I like sam adams better than most other commercially available octoberfest brews, but the Brooklyn is right up there. highly drinkable, but I would add a bit more carbonation to make it glide along a little better. it gets a touch weighty, especially as it warms up, and a little more gas would fix this. a good American tip of the cap to german tradition. a very well made beer."

"O- Why not try it? It's a pretty decent take on the style."

""
"save two bucks and have a shiner October instead of this. Nothing to celebrate over."
""
""
"Overall: Cerainly not the most traditional Oktoberfest, although elements of the style were present. The high carbonation and overt bitterness made this less smooth and round than I would have liked. If I were to consult on their recipe, I would tone down the alkalinity along with the carbonation, and bring in some lighter malt to round out the roasty quality and bring more complexity to the taste. Also, more dextrins could help with the mouthfeel and the sad head."

" The taste of Brooklyn's Oktoberfest is a more full flavored example showing a nice munich breadiness in the taste with light bitterness up front. The flavor expands to include some caramel notes with light toffee and fruitiness from the yeast. Overall this is a pretty decent take on the style, enjoyable and relatively clean with a nice amount of malt yet not heavy and still good for multiple servings I like that is isn't as sweet or bitter as other lagers I have had in the fest style I would probably drink this year round if I could."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a nice copper red with a small white head that doesn't leave any lacing. Smells of dark grain, but very very weak. Tastes of dark malt and slight coffee, very surprising and nice. Beer is light bodied and goes down real smooth, it is a nice refreshing sessionable beer. Overall, a slightly above average beer."

"Brooklyn Oktoberfest pours out an orange-red color with a small head. The aroma is full of roasted and nutty malts, with some earthy hops in the back. The taste is very good, the malt flavors here are very well-developed, with just a touch of nuttiness rounding out the excellent roasted and caramel malt flavors. A solid dose of herbal and earthy hops make the finish nicely bitter. The mouthfeel is on the heavier side of light bodied, and decently carbonated. Overall, this is an extremely well composed Oktoberfest. Highly recommended."

"A good, solid Oktoberfest. Along the same lines as a Samuel Adams Oktoberfest."
"this is a great beer for the season; toasty, buttery, sweet, without being cloying. not stellar, but extremely solid. I could drink 1000 of these."
"I won't expect less from this brewery. Always with the classic character to their beers and this one is no different. Don't think I found a Brooklyn beer I didn't appreciate."
"O - it tends a little heavy on the sweet side but is still a worthy offering"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: nice octoberfest style, hop character is almost non-existant, could make it a bit more complex, very basic malty octoberfest"
"Probably the best Märzen I have tried, although it isn't my most frequently visited style. There was a great malt and caramel base with just the right amount of sweetness and bitterness at the end. A well balanced and very enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
"While this is nothing that is going to knock your socks (or lederhosen) off, I submit that that isn't the point here. I can totally envision just putting these back, in frothy mug form, all night, with little further beer consideration required. Bread, caramel, soft biscuit, balanced-enough hops, and a slight uptick in alcohol. There - all thinking done - now just drink 'em. Next year, at any rate."
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: Looks nice, but misses the mark everywhere else."
"Poured medium amber with a 1/2 finger head that stuck around somewhat to the end. Smell surprised me a bit with some sweet malty chocolate. Taste pleasantly bordering on a bock, and leaning toward an English Brown. Not sure if that's what its supposed to do, but I sure like it. Very malty mild chocolate starting semi-sweet ending semi-dry. Mouthfeel was on the thinner side of medium. Not watery, but rather very drinkable. My first couple experiences with Marzens were... meh. Despite that, I have revisited the style this year with some great finds. This one was a gift and definitely the best find. Thanks Jay. Without hesitation I would say Brooklyn Oktoberfest is my favorite Marzen to date, and I would recommend this to anybody in the mood for something malty to put them in the spirit of Autumn."
""
"Reviewed Fall 2012"
"Flavor is similarly malt forward, multigrain bread and a touch of grape fruitiness also. An odd tanginess mars the otherwise straightforward flavors, body is light in feel. Something seems a bit off here, would advise skipping this beer in favor of other Oktoberfests, the tangy quality is a dealbreaker for me."

"Overall, a very average Oktoberfest. A little too sticky and too much astringency. Not really one to seek out as there are many better examples of the style out there."
"A rather average märzen - it doesn't stand up to German examples of the style. A bit too sweet and under-attenuated, along with a lack of noble hop character (both aroma and bitterness). I guess I'd like it to be crisper and slightly hoppier. It's a decent beer if taken on its own terms, though nothing special. Worth trying but no need to seek it out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Balanced, fruity and bready with a slight hop finish (on the bitter end). Fits the typical taste for a Märzen style beer. I personally think that the poured-from-the-tap version was better than out of a bottle (it’s possible the bottle just wasn’t quite as good)."
""
"Overall – A very nice refreshing and tasty Oktoberfest. Its blend of sweet, roasty, and drinkability make it one very nice session for the season."
"M: Thin to medium with moderate carbonation."
"D: not too shabby. worth giving a shot if in the mood for a marzen, but dont think you are gonna be blown away."
"O: A decent O-fest that delivers with the flavor and crispness you'd expect. Fairly average overall for the style, but worth a shot if you like the style and don't have a favorite picked out yet"
""
"Not a bad beer, just not great. My favorite so far is Karbachtoberfest from Karbach in Houston."
""
""
""
"Poured into a glass mug. Pours caramel brown with a fluffy off-white head and abundant tiny bubbles within the beer. The beer takes on a bready and mildly sweet aroma from the malts and some earthy and floral notes come from the hops. The taste follows the nose very well. I pick up those bready and sweet malt flavors and the hops add some nice balance with earthy, floral, and spicy notes. There's some back end bitterness there. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The drinkability is high. This is a very good beer."

"Well, a average beer, good enough so to kill a six pack after a long day of hard labor."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before Feb 2013. Pours fairly crystal clear copper orange color with a nice 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some light spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, apple, pear, and herbal. Nice aromas with good balance and decent strength. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, pear, and light herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of pear, caramel, nuttiness, biscuit, and light herbal spiciness on the finish for a short bit. Good amount of flavor with decent balance; no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice Oktoberfest. Solid flavor balance and complexity; and very smooth to drink. I enjoyed this, a good example of the style."
"O – This is a pretty good Oktoberfest beer. Nothing really stands out in particular, but it’s a decent example of the style. It looks good, smells and tastes nice with some nice malts and noble-esque hops, and has a good mouthfeel. This probably wouldn’t be my first choice for a beer of this style, but it’s certainly drinkable and tasty enough."

"On the fuller end of medium bodied with a zesty spice presence up front that lingers over the sweet malts into a dry finish.  Peppery with cinnamon, brown sugar and nutmeg countered by caramel malt sweetness.  There's also some earthy hop bitterness that compliments the spice but the spice presence is still a bit heavy for my liking.  Could use some more sweetness/stronger malt character.  Decent but lacks balance."
""
""
""
""
""
"Update. There's a metallic character that's offputting."

"O: I can dig it. This is a tasty oktoberfest and not spiced like some of the other American Oktoberfests which I do not enjoy. Overall recommended"
"O – The hops aren't crazy, but they assert themselves enough to make it clear this is an American take on the style. Brooklyn is becoming one of my preferred breweries in general; they deliver a solid line-up of styles, and this beer is a part of that. Good structure, with a tasty malt profile that shows off the caramel/butterscotch well. The only disappointment is how the body peters out in the finish. If you're tasting Oktoberfests, do the Germans first, as they'll seem thin and sparse if they have to follow this. Should definitely be included in any six-pack mixer sampling the style."

"This beer pours clear golden yellow with a one finger white head. The aroma of this beer matches the taste. The aroma is lager yeast, wheat and lemon grass. This is not too far from a witbier in my opinion and not to far from a pilsner as well. The flavors are somewhat weak and forgettable but well rounded and balanced. There is not the typical caramel and malt flavors in this beer that I expect from an Oktoberfest but this beer has a decent go at the lighter side of the style. Not a bad brew but not worth seeking out."

"Crisp and clean beer, despite the diacetyl flavor - I'm assuming I just got a bad batch. Malt obviously takes over, but is well balanced in the flavor. Not a terrific Marzen, but certainly drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is decent but a little too watery, too carbonated. I like my Oktoberfests rich and smooth- this one has a medium light body and is a little to prickly on the tongue. I'm not a fan of Brooklyn so for me this is one of their better beers, if not a great oktoberfest."

"Notes: This has consistently been my favorite oktoberfest beer over the last few years. Far from just another token seasonal; it's a very true to style offering that sets itself apart with a deep, rich maltiness that is rarely seen these days. Not at all watery or bland, as is the recent trend in the style, nor is it a bastardized American gimmick of a beer as so many tend to be."

"Found at Vasi’s in Waterbury, CT, this seasonal shows a coppery-brown color with a modest off-white cover that largely breaks down into scattered patches leaving little or no signs of lacing. The aroma suggests deep brown bread grains and mild maple malt. Not bad at all. The flavor follows with a more cidery-malt with vague sweet potato-pumpkin and a touch of herbal hops. Basically a fairly sweet malt concoction with some subtle spice. This is medium bodied with meager carbonation in this particular sample, leaving a bit of a glassy, aqueous feel. All in all a likeable brew but nothing highly memorable."

""
""

""
""
""
""
""

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Decent head, but no real lacing to speak of. Nose is malty, woody, with some sweet attributes. Flavor is a robust malt with a little butterscotch (but not really sweet) and some licorice bitterness. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."

"Drinkability: Not a fan. Not even sure this is worth finishing. I will still with the German imports for now, mixed in with some inexpensive Samuel Adams."

"Poured from bottle into a pint glass. Pours a nice golden/amber fairly clear and clean with a small off white head. Spot lacing that fades rather quick. Smell is what you would think from a marzen. Spice and pumpkin notes with some honey and cloves. Some earthy wheat. Not a strong eroma, but adequate. Taste is pretty straight forward with a nice mix of spices, malts and a touch of hops. Nothing complex, but decent. Easy on the palate and bread notes add to the taste. Feel is a good bit of carbonation that makes it dry and a touch thin. Overall- A pretty solid marzen that is refreshing and has a session quality to it. Enjoy the spices and earth flavor, but a little thin. Nothing spectacular, but I wouldn't turn one down. Another solid brew by Brooklyn, pretty tasty-"
"O – Was looking forward to this but there is something in the taste I did not enjoy. It’s a very harsh flavor."
"Dark in color. Medium carbonation. Heavy lacing. This beer tasted like a dark ale trying to have octoberfest spices. The bitterness drowned out the Octoberfest spice in my opinion. Decent quality beer and all, but not what I was looking for in this style beer."
"Overall a really fantastic beer for the season, and something to make you look forward to the fall."
"O: Very drinkable and enjoyable. I had three! Would have again."
"Brooklyn Okotoberfest is as good as the German imports I've had including Spaten, Hacker-Pschorr, and Ayinger. Amber brown in appearance with good lacing but not a huge head retention. The smell is mild, but the taste is round with noticeable hops - very mild bitterness with very nice malt presence. I recommend this highly."
"O - Overall, this a good, solid beer, definitely worth trying. Would make a decent session beer due to its drinkability."
"This is a very sessionable fall brew. Good job Brooklyn."
"This beer pours a clear amber-bronze color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into a thin cap of lacing. The aroma is quite malty. There is caramel, toffee, bread, and a very faint hint of roasted malt. There is some really nice complexity in this beers aroma. The taste is as malty as the aroma, but with a bit less complexity. It is more toffee oriented which I like well enough. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a fine Oktoberfest that I will certainly drink again."
"O - So far, this is my favorite Marzen of the around 7 I have tried this season. It has a unique flavor profile and brings a lot to the table of the style."
"This pours a nice auburn color with a good amount of foam. I get a pleasing malt aroma from the get-go, followed by a crisp taste, nice balance of bitter and sweet, and a clean finish. This is an agreeable marzen that’s quaffable and just about everything I’d ask for in a festbier."
"O- A decent marzen. Not on par with many of the German takes, but not bad."
"Overall the maltiness and mild sweetness of this brew is what made this Oktoberfest stand out. A definite asset to the style."
"The beer pours a dark copper color with a bit off-white foam. The aroma is appealing with lots of caramel malt. More malty goodness invades the palate. A medium body gives this thing some heft, appropriate for a cool autumnal day. A dusting of hops at the end provides some balances, but there is no mistaking that this is a hoppy affair. Nicely constructed and a pleasure to drink."
"Poured brown with some copper undertones. The one-finger of head dissipated quickly leaving no real lacing effect. There is a distinct malty and rye bread aroma that also is upfront in the flavor profile. The malt flavor is not as rich as I would like, but it still qualifies as hearty in my book. The finish is a bit flat and disappointing, but the beer, itself, is certainly one that I will gladly return to this season and in subsequent autumns."
"Not stand-out, but an all-around solid, easy drinking Oktoberfest."
"O: Nice! Sam Adams's Oktoberfest seems to be the benchmark these days (or at least the one that gets talked about the most), but I haven't had one in a while and can't say for sure how this would stack up. Definitely a very good beer though."
"Overall: a very pleasant O-fest. Perfect for sitting on the balcony watching the streetcars pass below."
"O: Looks and smells nice. Flavor was pretty good. I preferred this over the Paulaner."
"This is my favorite oktoberfest so far this season. The lager reminds me of the some of the high quality german imports, only fresher. It has a substantial body but could be sessionable because of its bright, refreshing flavor."
"O- an ok fest brew but but nothing great here"
"O: A nice solid beer with a good bit of malt flavor and a nice look. However, the beer might have a bit too much of a hop backbone for an Oktoberfest marzen style."
"O - This is a fantastic Oktoberfest I would recommend to all who enjoy the fall classic. It is smooth, rich, and has a sweet blend of malty flavor"
"Perfectly drinkable but it is uninteresting. With brewers, even German breweries, coming out with some well hopped, flavorful Marzens, this is easily lost in the crowd."
"M: Medium bodied and good carbonation levels"
"Nutty tea bag hop twang. Odd chemical-ish astringency that reminds me of old people cream. Despite what the previous two descriptors may hint at it's pretty good."
"The Oktoberfest jag continues to work its way through my system. Man, drinking semi-seasonally can almost be trying at times... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear copper-russet topped by a finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises toasted caramel, mandarin orange, light grass, rye bread, and a pinch of nutmeg. The taste ramps up the orange and adds a good amount of clove to the proceedings. Other than that, things follow the plan put forth by the smell. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation, and a slightly dry finish. Overall, a very nice O-Fest, one that makes me wanna keep drinking, then grab another bottle of it..."
"Overall - an ok beer overall but not a good ocktoberfest"
"Side note: My gf was drinking a Hofbrau Oktoberfest at the same time and I tried her's for comparison: the Hofbrau was smooth, clean, malty goodness in comparison (although the Hofbrau looked like a macro lager in appearance)."
"Overall: A very interesting and tasty take on a Marzen. More roasted and fruity than a typical Oktoberfest. Sort of like a cross between a Marzen and brown ale."
"Taste is rich and toasty, with more caramel and bread notes. An exemplary specimen for the style. Well-done!"
"O: The beer is very easy to drink and can be considered sessionable."
"Cheers"
"The malts are not as thick on the taste, much lighter but still sweet, some grain, just a bit of spice. Medium bodied."
"Very bold and hearty in a good way. Drinks like an Ale."
"Overall, I would have to say that it's a good beer. Brooklyn do make a decent beer that is easy to get in a lot of places, so it would be good to bring to your parties if you're celebrating Oktoberfest."
"This pours an amber color, a little darker than the other oktoberfest beers I've had with a large foamy white head with pretty good retention. The smell is a little heaver also, lots of toffee, sweet malt / biscuit, some caramel. The body is medium. The taste is pretty good also, the toffee and biscuit malts with a little hop bite, I actually prefer this one to the original german ones I've been trying."
"Overall: This is a very good Marzen that is just slightly marred by the medicinal aftertaste. Clean, flavorful and refreshing."
"NICE, WORTH TRYING!"
"Overall: I'm still not a big marzen fan, but I didn't mind this version."
"Overall another good Oktoberfest, great sweet taste, and hops with a clean finish to boot. Will keep an eye out for cheap sixers or cases."
"Overall a good Oktoberfest - easy to drink and just right as a fall session brew. Prost!"
"This is one of the better Octoberfest beers that I've had. I'd pick up a 6'er of this one."
"Overall- I enjoyed it. Was a little bit different than I thought it was going to be but still quite good. Cheers!"
"O: I'm still a bit new to the ""Oktoberfest"" style, but from what I've had of this beer, I like it. I'm a fan of Brooklyn's other brews, so I'm not disappointed that I have a 6-pack of this to go through. Definitely could be a nice session beer for the fall."
"Overall: an excellent oktoberfest. One of my favorites."
"A tasty enough brew, but not one I would necessarily be dying to try again. My enthusiasm for the Autumn is such that I really want my Fall Seasonals to knock my socks off with loud, bold flavors, and this one is just a bit too polite to do it for me."
"Overall pretty good, nice malt profile especially the nose, the hop profile isn't exactly what I expected but doesn't throw it off too much. Nice lager profile although I would have liked a slightly cleaner and crisper finish. Otherwise one of the better American made Oktoberfests I've had to date."
"Notes: After trying a few this is hands down my favorite Marzen."
"I don't have anything against this beer; however, I find it rather uninspiring. With so many excellent Oktoberfests out there, this one, for me falls the middle of the pack."
"Ammber brown in color with a tan head that has medium retention. No major lacing on the glass. The taste has a good taste of carmel malts and its balanced out by a nice somewhat earthy hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is a little lighter then I wish for a fall seasonal beer but overall I liked this version of the oktoberfest. Is this my favorite or the best I've had...no but its a great standby beer good for any fall occasion"
"A ho-hum beer if ever there was. A better-than-mild aroma of malt and oranges that might lead one to expect something tasty in the bottle, but one would be rather disappointed. The body is thin, the taste weak; the color wan. There's a nip from the carbonation but don't look for much more than that. Buy a bottle to try; don't invest in a six."
"Overall a decent beer, not the best example of the style but not too shabby either."
"Overall-With all the other Octoberfest/Pumpkin Beers out right now, odds are this beer won't be revisited."
"O - Another pretty decent Oktoberfest."
"It's not a bad Oktoberfest but certainly atypical and nothing like I was expecting. I unfortunately have five more of these to drink but it's not a beer I would purchase again. There are much better examples of the style out there, even American brewed ones."
"A well made example and would be pleased to drink out somewhere."
"One of the best fest beers I've had, especially from an American brewer."
"Overall, not a bad Oktoberfest."
"Morey's Bottom Line: This beer doesn't taste bad...problem is...it really doesn't have much taste at all! Refreshing and quaffable? Yes. But there are much better examples of this style, and I can't see myself picking one of these up again anytime soon."
"It's hard to say if I prefer this beer or Hacker-Pschorr's version. I'd go for this one I'm in the mood for something dryer and more sessionable and Hacker-Pscorr's if I wanted something sweeter."
"New bottle with a blue label! Almost missed it! A very well made Oktoberfest. It's probably the best of the American attempts of the style. Clear amber body with decent lacing. Smells malty, creamy, strong caramel candies, toast, and mild vanilla. The flavor reminds me of Ayinger, which is the better O-fest, though Brooklyn's version is great too. It's just carbonated more and has a sharp (instead of a smooth) malt zing...two things that are slightly working against it."
"In the end this was a decent example of the style but I certainly didn't love it. This isn't my favorite style to begin with but I tried to be fair about judging this beer. Got a few more in the fridge so I will consider it a bit further with some football this weekend."
"It has a nice copper color and tastes of caramel, and maple, but it's not sweet like maple syrup. Good balance of flavors and some roasty notes. Nice finish. Good, but not great. About middle of the pack as far as things go for the style. You won't be disappointed, but you won't be blown away."
"Ruby amber in body with white foamy head that fades. Aroma of malt sweetness, spices: nutmeg and cinnamon, biscuit. Malty flavors of sweet biscuit, cinnamon cookie with some burnt edges, slight toffee towards the finish and an aftertaste of slight cola. Light bodied with lively carbonation. Tasty and quaffable but the malt sweetness can push me away after a while."
"A: Not a bad Oktoberfest beer. Easy drinking and an ok flavor."
"O- I've had better Oktoberfest lagers but this one is very drinkable. The malts hang around in your palate for a while."
"O: OK...average...boring. a bit on the light side and the finish was not what I had hoped for."
"O: Oktoberfests aren't typically the first style I reach for, but this is pretty good. I do prefer this more balanced take on the style over the malt dominate competition. Probably won't reach for this again, but that's not a condemnation of this beer; just my indifference toward the style."
"D-Very confused by this one; everything about this beer, besides color, screams porter to me, not Marzen. I was expecting a more typical Marzen beer with toasty and caramelly malt forward beer with some nice noble hops. This is a nice beer, but it is not what I expect from a Marzen."
"Fall isn't quite here yet but the Oktoberfest brew is...And a lil local brewery by the name of Brooklyn Brewery has a lil rendition. Into a pint glass this pours a clear copper under an off white head. Aroma is a nice mix of toasted dark bready malt with traces of deep caramel and earthy herbal hop. Feel on the palate is somewhat mineral watery with an underlying bready flavored crisp malt. Huh, I pick up on a slight sunflower seed hint in the finish. Cheers to Fall!"
"EDIT: As this beer warmed, I realized that it was a little weaker in body than I liked (the flavors kind of bottom out and disappear), so I knocked .5 off the mouthfeel and overall."
"O- very nice oktoberfest, I really like a beer like this watching football."
"It's a bit dark tasting like some other Brooklyn's, but I like it (and it's a Martzen, not my favorite style)."
"Medium to high carbonation leading to a spritzy but slightly creamy mouthfeel. Very malty in the form of caramel and barley, and a touch of balancing citrus hops that give it an almost tangy taste. Slight touch of lightly roasted malts and tobacco leaves. Maybe a touch too citrusy the more I drink of it actually. It's interesting, but not necessarily in an amazing way. Maybe something's just a tad off here, but still a solid brew and a nice beer to nurse and let warm up on a chilly night."
"Bottom line, I enjoyed this beer, but for me it was a bit on the light side and the finish was not what I had hoped for"
"Either way, I gotta give it high marks. I won't complain about this one showing up on shelves in mid-August."
"O-Haven't had that many Oktoberfest beers but so far this one is the best. It didn't have same boring malts has previous the spices came through and made this one tasty. Most likely will have an Oktoberfest tasting and will compare then."
"I feel awkward drinking these styles in August but if it's out now I know it is fresh. Copper tinted brown with over big fluffy head. Aroma is sweet, slightly toasty, malts. Flavor has that smooth and crisp lager body with a large malty sweetness. Mild spicy hop finish but it doesn't leave a bitter finish. One smooth drinking Oktoberfest."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: I love Oktoberfest beers and this is a decent American take on a German classic. It has a nice easy-drinking taste, but is not special by any means. A session beer for sure. Cheers!!"
"O: Really enjoyable beer. Great for the end of summer/beginning of fall because its full of flavor, but not too heavy for the hot August/September days. Oktoberfest beers are always a style I look forward to releasing."
"This beer seems to have lasted a year. And it's very refreshing. There's no reason we can't have summer beers with this much taste and character. I'm really looking forward to all the Oktoberfest beers in the coming months."
"Poured out with a nice looking amber color, The head was tan and fizzy. There wasn't much lacing at all. The smell was decent with some sweet malts and a touch of caramel and spice. The taste was a little weak, I expected it to be a little better coming from Brooklyn Brewing. The mouthfeel wasn't too bad but overall this brew is just about average."
"C-"
"D – Pretty drinkable Oktober. Malty and not overly sweet, easy drinker that I could have more than one. I recommend trying it at least once"
"Overall it just really needed a little bit more for me to really get a grip of this one. I thought it was ok, but to be honest just needed more to finish it off."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer, though wouldn't actively seek it out as there are better Oktoberfests available, but was offered I would take one."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into dimpled mug. Clear amber with a tiny off-white head, lively one. Aroma of Vienna malts, noble hops, grains and mild nuttiness. Taste is somewhat bland with caramel, toasted Munich malts, light toffee. Mostly clean finish and a touch of astringency."
"D: Yes, drinkable but it did throw me for a loop I normally would expect a fuller taste from the guys at Brooklyn. Not the best Oktoberfest maybe but a good runner ."
"Opinion: This is a pretty decent beer. It comes in under the guidelines for this style, but I personally prefer my O-Fests quite a bit drier. This one finishes quite heavy. The choice of bittering hops was also a bit odd in this beer as it seemed like they thought that IBUs were IBUs and put something like Clusters in there for bittering. Either way, I am seriously splitting hairs and this is only because I am very familiar with this style of beer. This a good representation of the style and I am glad that I bought a 6-pack as I will surely drink it."
"This beer isn't a homerun, but I'd have it again. It's well made, and the nutty, toasted flavors that come out in it don't just get immediately lost in sweetness like I find in lesser lagers or brown ales, but rather they stick around and get fuller as you finish the glass."
"My advise would be to stock up while you can get it at your local beer store."
"d- good stuff, a solid oktoberfest, i'd drink this again for sure."
"D: Fairly smooth, but overall lacking in flavor. I had no desire to try another."
"Drink - This is one of the better Oktoberfest beers I've had. Worth seeking out."
"RJT"
"Of the domestic (U.S.) Marzens I've sampled, this ranks in my book as one of the more accurate interpretations (an opinion subject to change, I suspect). A short, stately looking head from the pour, lacing satisfactory. Rather deep orange-red hue, heavy on the orange. Aroma is moderately spot-on, though somewhat subdued and dry - dry and malty in a northern English brown sense, if that makes sense. Malty base, yet of mild intensity, and a light nuttiness. The flavor profile seems a bit muted, however, possibly being compromised by the carbonation level. The finish is slightly phenolic. This beer tastes and drinks okay, but it comes off a wee bit distant in personality."
"Pours a clear orangey/caramel hue with nice offwhite head. Sweet malty caramel aroma. Taste is sweet malty bready, caramel with some light hops. Palate is medium body, with good carbonation. Finish is sweet malty caramel, bready notes, some light hoppiness, with a nutty ending. Overall a very nice oktoberfest."
"The body was weak and uninspiring, not impressed at all. Just a poor malty beer with 5.5%ABV hidden somewhere in it. The worst O'Fest beer I've ever had."
"Pours orange with a thick, white head. Toasted malt aroma with hints of perfume hops. Toasted malt flavor balanced by piney, floral hops. Medium, crisp body, medium carbonation. Long, dry, earthy finish. Good Octoberfest but definitely not my Favorite."
"Mouthfeel is pleasantly dry and carbonation is moderate. It's a smooth and easy drinking example of the style."
"Recieved in a beer trade. Has a nice autumn brown color and maintains an holds it's carbonation well. (S)Carries a light malty scent, a nice aroma. Starts with sweet caramel with a nit of nuttiness. Then moves to a heavier mouth feel from carbonation and leaves a sweet tinging. This would be a nice beer to have one or two in a sitting."
"M/D: Medium to heavy bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, its pretty good. On the better side of others I have had in this style (this year at least). My only detraction that it was a little heavier than expected."
"D: This may be my new favorite Octoberfest!"
"Recommended."
"Pours a dark amber reddish color that just seems really good for this time of year. Had a small 1-finger light head that fell rather quickly leaving no signs of lacing on the glass. Lots of carbonation bubbles present. The smell was a little bit malty and yeasty, but it was a very faint smell all in all. The taste was crisp and dry. Floral hops were present, but didn't stand out a whole lot. Not a very complex tasting beer. The mouthfeel was good on this. Lighter body with a medium to high carbonation that went down smooth. I'd say the drinkability was good. These are pretty easy to drink beers, especially for this time of year where it's just starting to get a little colder outside. I'd say its a great beer to have for when its starting to get colder, but it's not quite stout season yet. This is the first beer I've had from Brooklyn Brewery, and I am definitely interested to see what other beers they have out there. Cheers."
"Is this a Marzen or just an autumn lager? Too dark for the style, but a light drinker for cool weather. Still nothing special, though."
"Poured into a pint glass. The beer is a clear burnt sienna color with just a thin layer of off white head that has a slightly red hue to it. The head vanishes quickly and doesn't leave me any lace, fortunately I have a bunch of tiny bubbles to look at. The aroma, which is very faint, has a barnyard aroma to it. Hay, grass, earth and slight hints of dark fruit and just a little bit of citrus to finish. The taste is grainy malt and bready yeast with not much else noticeable on this reviewers pallet. The mouthfeel is light and very dry with suitable carbonation. Solid effort overall in my opinion, I'm not disappointed that I picked up two bottles."
"Pours a red/amber with a bright white two-finger head. Average lacing and retention. Caramel, dark fruit, raisin aroma. Light sweet molasses and raisin malt dominate to start. Sweet bread as well. Also typical caramel malt for an octoberfest. Earthy hops finish up the beer. Light mouthfeel and solid drinkability."
"D: this might be better with food. This beer is not nasty, but fails to impress on any level."
"Pours a light copper with a white head that leaves a bit of lacing. Nose consists of toffee and bread with some faint hops. Taste is all malt with some grain and dough plus a bit of caramel and toffee. Light feel wih ample carbonation."
"drinkability: very drinkable, lighter on the Märzen elements but more bold and refreshing than expected."
"Pours a clear, copper color with just a thin cap of foam that fades quickly to a ring. A lot of sweet, toasted malt in the aroma, predominately toffee and banana with some phenolic hints in the background. Strong toasted malt flavors initially, matching the character of the aroma before some mildly harsh bitterness sets in. Body is on the thin side of medium but quite lively due to good carbonation. Finish is fast and fairly clean, with just a touch of lingering flavor from the malt and drinkability is good."
"Like all Marzens this is pretty drinkable, if not a bit filling. It definitely has a lot of character, but with so many other fine examples out there, I am not sure how often I will seek this particular one out."
"Drinkability - This is a slightly above average brew, in my novice opinion. Nothing bad by any means. It's easily drinkable and sets the mood for Autumn. I will drink this again if it's offered. Have no quarrels with the beer. Brooklyn Brewery always puts out a solid product."
"Really nice pour with a large head. Once the head settled, the color of the beer was with dark brown amber with a thin lacing. There is a caramel, sweet aroma with a malt hint. Subtle sweet flavor with a roasted nut-like flavor. The beer has a really light body with a solid crispness to it. Overall, I really enjoyed this drink for the evening."
"D: Goes down easily, minor kick, nice representation of style. Not my favorite style, but this is one of the better that I've had. I'd definitely have it again!"
"Notes: Dissapointed in this one."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a copper color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by malts.Taste is good, lots of malts, some hops are present, just a touch of caramel. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"Very easy to drink, I can have a few of these due to the high drinkability. It is a very refreshing easy drinking Marzen style. Not all that complicated in flavor but it sure does taste good. Good representation of the style, I recommend this beer to try."
"This is a decent beer. With its subtle and almost light flavor, you feel like you can drink a number of these."
"A very refreshing and drinkable beer. I can't wait to start on number 2."
"12oz bottle. Pours a light brown with a thin head that quickly disappears. No lacing. Aroma is a sweet caramel. Some roasted malts as well. Nice blend of caramel and malts with a smooth, crisp taste. Not overly sweet. Just a solid, inexpensive beer perfect for Autumn."
"Drinkability- not bad drinking at all but certainly no the best octoberfest or one to search crazily over, servicable at best"
"tastes decent however to me it gets fairly boring doubt i would personally get it again"
"Didn't think this was a good one, but glad I tried it again."
"D: mostly goes with the style, 12oz serving of this style is just too small."
"Clear dark amber with a small, but creamy, off-white head. Modest aroma of toasted caramel and bread, black tea, and slight earthy hop spice. Rich German malt flavor...raisin sweetness and earthy, spicy hops. Pretty tasty and satisfying, if a little rough around the edges. Medium bodied, bitter, and dry. Solid Märzen...I got a single this time, but I wouldn't mind grabbing a 6-pack while it's in season."
"I gave it good marks for Drinkability; but then you can usually say that about Oktoberfest beers."
"Well balanced, no alcohol noticeable, very well done and a great addition to the plethora of Oktoberfest's out there. Much better than SA."
"Overall impression: Worth a try."
"For a guy who normally hates the style, I could drink this beer all day."
"D-decent beer, has a strong malt body but little hop balance. still tasty and nothing glaring, the hay and stale grain seem to work slightly against the good bready caramel malt flavors."
"Very drinkable: as good or better than any of the other Oktoberfest beers I've tried this year."
"I'm getting more of this one... Its a terrific Oktoberfest that I'm going to keep around this fall..."
"M/D - Full body leaves some sticky residue post-sip but still manages to end light and clean. Maybe a little low on the carbonation. Easy to drink, nothing fancy but I think that makes this beer what it is, and to me that's good!"
"Compared to last year's that I had on tap, this was a surprise. I remember not liking it very much last time I had it. I don't know if it has improved since last year or if it was off at the place I had it last. I'll try and get it on tap and update my tap review if necessary. I recommend this one."
"This is a decent festbier, pretty easy to drink, but not hugely satisfying."
" Could easily be passed as an Import. Spot on for the style."
"D: Highly session-able beer. It is tasty and not too strong."
"Thin, smooth, light and highly drinkable"
"This is one very drinkable Octoberfest that, while taking a backseat to Paulaner's fest beer, is certainly worth a try."
"Possibly the best Oktoberfest I've had this season. I hope there are many more to follow it."
"D- Not too bad at all. I like this one. Easy to drink for sure."
"If you want an American brewed Oktoberfest, this is one of the better ones. The alcohol might be a little too high for me to have a 2nd liter--but that isn't necessarily a bad thing."
"Overall a decent brew - not my favorite for the style, and certainly not my favorite out of Brooklyn Brewery."
"A respectable shot at the style. You could take the label off and hand it to a Bavarian."
"Over all very bland granted it was my first of the style, but I just expected more. more malt, more something. not the rare fall treat I was expecting like I got from the pumpkin ales I've had. Maybe I should stick to those. I will of coarse try more marzens for safe measure. Its a good beer that would be a good stand by case of garage suds, or a fall keg that everyone can agree on but nothing to write home about."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Showed a deep reddish orange with creamy head and good retention. Smell was of faint malty sweetness, mellow earth notes as well. Taste was similar, but too light for my liking. The carbonation was not overpowering and made for a very drinkable beer though lacking somewhat in complexity. Not bad for the style, just not a fan of the style."
"D - This beer is ok. Maybe it's true to style, but in general it's not something I would seek out. It's drinkable to be sure, but there's just not much going on. Pretty uninspiring."
"Overall, a little bit too dry and earthy for me to drink all night (mostly because of the aftertaste), but definitely one of the better Oktoberfest beers I have had so far this year."
"I don't usually like to get a 6-pack of any one particular beer, but this is definitely an exception. Now, on to try other Oktoberfests."
"This is a tasty marzen. A good caramel presence, some balance, and just easy drinking all around."
"I liked it a lot. A good go to beer for the fall. The taste blends nicely and the drinkability is very good too. Definitely a top recommendation of mine for this autumn season. Nothing I really didn't like about this beer, I gave it 4's all around."
"In summary, it's very easy drinking and has no off-putting characteristics, just a bit boring."
"D- oktoberfest could possibly be my favorite everyday beer and i've said this before, but the american versions just don't peel my cap back. brooklyn brewery goes to great lengths to make their stuff true to style, even so far as having their grains malted in germany. whether this is rare practice or not, hell, i don't know, but there is some deeply seated passionate enjoyment inside me when i throw down a german oktoberfest, give a damn less if it spent a year in a hot cargo box, that our genius american brewers simply cannot replicate. not that i've tasted anyway. good beer though."
"this is a really nice example of the style, tastes like it was imported from germany. i recommend this highly for the season."
"Kind of a run of the mill Marzen beer. Decent and enjoyable, but a bit thin on the palate. Head disappeared quick. Nice malt flavor and moderate carbonation. A bit of nice bready flavor on the finish. Just a bit too simple and straightforward for me Will prob go elsewhere for my next Oktoberfest. First Brooklyn beer I've been disappointed with."
"Overall, a solid take on the style, with a subtle tweak of flavor that does more good than bad."
"D: This is an okay beer. I am not very impressed and wish I had just gone with the SA octoberfest."
"T: Still very clean, although the hops come out here much more than in the nose. Malts still dominate, though, with the caramel side taking precedence. Thin and light mouthfeel, rather watery. Leaves the palate dry and bland."
"D-Not bad. The smokiness keeps it interesting and its super clean and easy going down. I would have liked to see a bit more maltiness to it though."
"D: Hey pretty good ABV and a well balanced brew, make this a pretty drinkable beer. I'll have to add this one to my fall beer lineup."
"D - Great Oktoberfest flavor without the stinky green bottle aroma associated with German Oktoberfests (not knocking them)! One of the better American Oktoberfest beers on the market IMO."
"It is pretty good oktoberfest material, especially for an American brewer, a decent brew, a good one to drink if you see it before the other stuff comes out.This has been almost my 30th or so Oktoberfest I've tried and it just cements my affection for the style."
"D: Very drinkable, especially as fall lurks nearer."
"Pours a clear dark copper, topped by more of a ""collar"" than a head. Aromas are predominantly toasty, followed (in order of intensity) by caramel and something akin to a pile of sawdust. Flavor profile is (of course) massive on the malts: tons of toast and bread rolls, with a slight, earthy bitterness to establish order. Medium body is quite smooth; finishes with a sort of toast-meets-low-sugar-toffee taste [another way that I sometimes think of this flavor is an ""unsweetened Tootsie Roll""]. Overall very flavorful; not bad at all."
"Pours a very ruby orange color that is extremely clear and produces an off white minimal head. Very very dark and red in color even for an Oktoberfest. Aroma is sweet biscuity bready malts. Has a fried pizza crust maltiness aroma to it. Really earthy and has a distinct marzen aroma that is nice. Taste is on point with what I was looking for. Medium bodied yet easy to slug down. Big warty malty flavors of toasted rolls, marshmallows and some spicy earthy notes. Mouthfeel is under carbonated for me. Though it's easy drinking it's weight on the palate is just over the top. Drinkability is great. One of my favorite American marzens out there. Nice beer."
"Beautiful amber color, appropriate carbonation, modest head initially with modest lacing. Clear and crisp, with a memory-inducing aroma of the real thing. Easily consumed in large, festival-sized quantities. This is my favorite interpretation of Oktoberfest-style beers yet."
"Lovely copper color, though I did not pick up anything on the nose. Good solid flavor of slight caramel and a bit toasty. Light in body and dissipates quickly. Its lightness adds drinkability though it may run a bit thin for all day. Pretzels and oompa bands, anyone?"
"This is a tasty brew though, especially for a fall day."
"Into a pint glass, it poured copper/amber, with healthy carbonation, two fingers of white, great retention, and great lacing. Very toasty, with biscuit, caramel, toffee, and woodiness. The taste revealed all of the above in nicely balanced harmony, with some herbal hoppiness on the dry finish as well. Not as thick as the nose would suggest, with ample carbonation. A very drinkable marzen."
"D - You could pour back a few few of these. Easy drinking and good inoffensive beer with nothing objectionable."
"M: Easy on the palate, light"
"D: Not the most complex beer in the world but very drinkable. This is a great session O-fest, you could drink several pints in a sitting."
"I liked it very much though, and consider it a solid beer I could and would have more than one of. ""Sessionable," I suppose."
"The beer poured from the bottle to reveal a light copper color. The aroma was fairly nice with a moderately strong nutmeg character. The taste was very light with a mild spiciness. The finsish was slightly dry. The mouthfeel was very light. Overall this wasn't too bad. It is a decent representation of the German Oktoberfest beers I have tried."
"mmm, tastes like fall. Has a nice rich maltiness to it. A bit of a metallic finish. but very smooth, rich and it has an awesome mouthfeel."
"D= very drinkable, probably great with most meals or in session unless you want to drink something quality."
"Serving type: 12oz bottle purchased non-refrigerated on 12/7/2009"
" D- This beer has a great crisp fresh malt and hops flavor without any sulfur flavors. It would be easy to drink a boot full of this beer."
"Verdict: It's always good to see Oktoberfest beers that stay closer to the malty origins of the style. Brooklyn's is a pleasant-enough example, and certainly one of the better American attempts."
"Notes: A nice American Oktoberfest. It has aspects of a traditional German one, but a little more hops to bring some good balance, all while retaining that classic drinkability."
"I didn't get a of of smell from this other than a mildly hoppy aroma with some sweeter caramel that also comes through on tasting. Lightly spiced, ginger, nutmeg, caramel, malt, mostly caramel. Smooth mouthfeel, even texture, medium body; bitterness somewhat muted for a gentle, rewarding overall presentation. Good stuff, recommended."
"Pours a nice deep amber-orange with thick, creamy, scarcely off-white head, with good retention, Leaves a very fine lacing as the head recedes. Sweet malt aroma wafts from the bulb of my Sam Adams perfect pint. Caramel and toasted bread aromas come out after a gentle swirl. The taste is of sweet caramel malt and a bread like finish followed by a hint of bitter hops and grain on the back. This has a bit of chewy malt to it but has is a very balanced beer. The main taste is that sweet malty caramel that is very telling of Oktoberfest styles. Nice carbonation, I think this is a more balanced Oktoberfest than the Paulaner I had earlier this season, which was a little too thick and chewy and heavy on the caramel. This Oktoberfest from Brooklyn offers a nice hint of hop and clean grain to balance it out."
"D - I'm a big fan of Marzens, and this is one of my favorites. Very drinkable beer, and I always drink my fair share every October."
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. Poured a very nice amber color with perfect clarity. Had a nice thick white head that tends to go away pretty quickly but produces better than average lacing. The smell could be a bit stronger but still smells good. It consists 100% of caramelized malts. I tried smelling the malts but it's not really there. The taste steps it up from the smell. Again you can really taste the sweet caramelized roasted malts, very tasty. Sweeter than most Octoberfests I've had, but extremely tasty. There is a very slight hop aftertaste and burps up a bit hop, but the malts take up most of the flavor. I really wish I could rate the smell 3.75 and 4.25 on the taste so I gave them an even 4 a piece. This is between medium and full bodied, and very drinkable. This is one of the better Octoberfests I've ever had. The perfect fall beer. If this beer had a bit more hop to it than it would be a perfect year round beer."
"Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side, even for an octoberfest. Drinkability is good, but mainly because there's so little flavor that gets in the way of swilling."
"Drinkability is excellent and lends itself to any festive moment. If you can still find a six pick it up and carry Oktoberfest into Thanksgiving."
"""Brooklyn Brewing"" is essentially a short form way of saying ""American craft brewers are talented, ingenious artisans"". It's a case of student outshining teacher as this lager, like all of this brewery's renditions of classic European styles, successfully emulates all that is redeeming about the style and is, arguably, better than most originals you'll find."
"I poured this into a pint glass, it left a 1/2"" white head. Oddly enough there was no lacing at all when I drank this. Pretty good carbonation, nice malty taste but nothing spectacular. Nice color, good strong amber; very clear. This was a good, satisfying Oktoberfest-style beer, but in my opinion Sam Adams Oktoberfest is still better. Quite a bit cheaper, too. Lately it seems I've been a little under-whelmed with Brooklyn's attempts. This disappoints me since I enjoyed their East India pale ale so much."
"Drinkability is not bad. It goes down pretty easy and I certainly wouldn't mind having a few of these at a time. A good session beer but I do feel I've had better."
"Decent O-fest here. Has all the characteristics of a solid fall/winter brew. Not a stand out but a very good offering."
"Poured into a pint glass, pours a brown with a fluffy head that doesn't leave much lace. Smell is of strong toasted malt and oats, it has a nice crips fall like smell to this beer. Taste is spot on for the style a bit of a malty thick chewy body with a nice subtle sour like finish on the back end. Overall a very nice addition to Brooklyn's fine product line."
"brooklyn brewery oktoberfest is drinkable, can have a few of these. overall its a tasty oktoberfest that i'll look forward to getting during the coming autumns."
"Very easy to drink. Go get this one."
"Pours a clear, amber/copper color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and slight lacing. Smells of yeast, sweet malt, and slight hop. Fits the style of an Marzen / Oktoberfest. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, yeast, hint of roasted malt, and slight hop. Overall, a good body, easy drinkability, and good mouth feel."
"D: A guzzler. Light body and the clean, balanced, and simple flavor create a supremely drinkable marzen."
"D: ends dry but leaving a dry bitter nuttiness that isn't too appealing to me. could drink a fair few, but ehh.."
"D - while did not blow me away drinkablilty is good as could easily have again."
"Pours a deep amber-mahogany and develops a full, rich, tan head that persists to the very last sip. The initial nose suggests fresh baked bread, roasted malt and a light wafting of hops. The body is medium-full, yet soft, sweet and malty with hints of spice. The carbonation is pleasantly light. Attractive lacing does form through-out the glass. This lager is a straight forward thirst-quenching drink. Not overly complex, contemplative or moreish, yet deserving of repeat purchase. This Märzen is a good accompaniment with food with flavors to enjoy that will not compete with the food."
"Octoberfest isn't my favorite style, but i dug this one."
"Pours a heavy head, that fades away predicatably. Has a less than amber, but dark appearance that ooks nice. A decent smell, nothing overpowering, but nothing really stands out either. Average mouthful, good taste,maybe some caramel flavor to it, easy to drink several as a session beer."
"Mouthfeel is a bit light-bodied as it's sort of watery in texture and adequately carbonated for the mouth appeal. This Oktoberfest drinks very smoothly and easily. Definitely could have a few more bottles of these. Worth a buy for the fall season."
"Gotta say I'm a little disappointed in this one. I expect an Oktoberfest to be very drinkable, & I did not care for another once this was done. The style is one of my favorites any more, & I thought Brooklyn would really tackle a good, traditional O-fest, but the lemon flavors & the (for lack of a better word) metal taste & feel did not make me jump for joy."
"Somehow I had zero head on this one. Literally. No lace either. Not sure what happened. Still in date and everything else seemed fine just no foam at all. Nice brownish amber color for whatever that's worth. Faint aroma of malted grains that's delicate but pleasant. The flavor was quite nice, the hops and malt were in harmony. A bit of bubbles but otherwise an average mouthfeel. It's OK, and would make a decent fall session beer though I can think of better and there are certainly some nicer Oktoberfests out there but it's above average."
"An awesome rep of a Ofest. I was very impressed! Exceeded my expectations. Cheer to Mr. Oliver!"
"12oz bottle purchased at Tully's in Wells, Maine. Pours a crystal-clear golden-amber body with a thin off-white head. Smells like toffee with some maltiness. Tastes malty with toffee, nut, a tinge of butter, hints of chocolate, and a clean finish. Light effervescent mouthfeel and very drinkable. Kind of pedestrian, but comparable to Samuel Adams or some of the cheaper examples from Germany (Spaten, Beck's)"
"Mouthfeel is light and smooth with very light carbonation, a light to medium body and a smooth grainy finish that's on the dry side. A good beer that is well balanced and for me a great representation of this style. I don't like when an Oktoberfest has too much spice like nutmeg or pumpkin flavor, so this was very enjoyable for me. The type of beer I could drink all night, which makes it a success from the Octoberfest front."
"D- An enjoyable beer and just slightly memorable in a world full of Oktoberfests."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Not a bad Oktoberfest. Not my favorite, and kind of bland. Inoffensive, but an easy drinker."
"D - Very smooth. I rate this high for sure. Very solid beer and the better commercial Oktoberfest (compared to SA)"
"D: Very drinkable and evolves throughout the tastebuds so drinking more than one to decipher evolution is recommended."
"Mouthfeel is medium..and it tastes good, balanced flavor profile. Good marzen."
"The mouthfeel was a little thin but okay for my personal taste. This O-fest goes down pretty easy, I can drink a few of these. One of the better offerings from the Brooklyn Brewery and a good American interpretation. Well done."
"Medium body with appropriate carbonation. Easy to drink and enjoyable."
"D -- Very easy going down on a true Fall day here in the Midwest; from Chicago to Brooklyn -- Prosit to Garret!"
"D - The drinkability of this beer is high, very sessionable, this is a great Octoberfest beer, I'm glad La now has options in this style"
"Drinkability: Simply put, this is one great Marzen. Crisp, refreshing, and goes down nice on a cool autumn night. A special thanks to the wife for picking this one up for me."
"Light citrus tartness buried in a bed of malt. Well carbonated. Classic marzen taste comes through. Very drinkable, got to lover October, the beers are so damn good this time of year."
"2009 batch, nice and fresh. Haven't had a ton of oktoberfests but still get the general feel of them I think. Poured a clear amber-brown color with a one and a half finger head that is very fizzy and dies down quickly, light-spotty lacing is left as I drink this one. Carbonation can be seen rising in the beer. Smells of pale malts, a bit of hops and some citrus going on here too. Not a very complex smell for this one, not much going on. Taste is lots of pale malts up front with some good hop (citrus,earthy) balance following the malts. Also get a bit of spicyness and no alcohol or off flavors here. Maybe a bit of a grassy flavor in the aftertaste also, but not a bad one. The flavor seems to start to fade toward the end of the glass. Mouthfeel is surprisingly creamy and medium bodied, little-no alcohol warming and a good coating of taste left on the palette to enjoy for minutes after sipping. Very smooth and good carbonation. Drinkability is good, very good taste for an oktoberfest, no alcohol flavor to ruin the beer over time. The only trouble here is I can feel the beer starting to fade a bit at the end of my first glass. Stomach can handle many of these in the long run. The $9.50/6pack price is good for this quality and I would buy this one again."
"Bottom line- Better than average, but just too close to a Sam Adams -which I consider (for better or worse) as the median for a Grocery available American craft beer. If I really wanted an Oktoberfest, I'd go for a Spaten or Paulaner any day."
"This brew is very drinkable, it is a tade bit lower in tatse to me then some of the other oktoberfests I have tried. Good brew."
"Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Not one of my favorite oktoberfests as it doesn't really stand out, but it doesn't disappoint either. Enjoyable for the most part, but I just think I might get bored of it after having one or two."
"Drinkability is decent. I think as long as you have the right food to go along with it, this can be a great beer to drink during the cool fall months. Thanks to its mellow character, it lends itself to proably a couple of glasses in a session."
"I'm a noob, but I'm thinking Oktoberfests may not be one of my preferred types of beers. Nothing bad here - just not my cup of tea."
"Drinkability: I normally do not like Brooklyn brews for some reason, however this is one of my favorite Octoberfests. It may be my favorite from the brewery. This one is nice and malty, but it also does have some really nice spicing. I could session this one."
"Drinkability/Overall - What can I say? This is a well crafted American version of a Märzen. Personally, I would've liked a little more malt, but other than that, it's all good. It's very session-able and has just enough flavor to keep you interested. Another enjoyable beer from the guys at Brooklyn. I will more than likely drink this beer again. Prost!"
"D - Very nice Oktoberfest, will buy again next year."
"Pretty good, but not particularly special. I like the label--simple, nice. Didn't poor, so basing appearance on that. Simple spell, somewhat spicy, maybe a little malty... Hard to place. Tasted okay. A bit too bitter, but good. Mouthfeel--nothing great. Bites some, but gets better. Maybe a little soft. I wouldn't drink this if I didn't have 5 more waiting for me."
"M - Again a little flat but not so bad to stop me from finishing the drink. All in all a very good beer."
"D: 'Tis the season for Marzen and this is a good take on the style. I could become very well aquainted with this..."
"D = This one does drink well, but not outstandingly. I enjoy it, but after one I'm pretty much done and ready to move on to something else. Still, I happily return to it a couple days later."
"This clear copper-amber beer features little head--it quickly faded away after the pour. The aroma is appropriately toasty, but faint and barely detectable. The taste is excellent, however: lightly toasted, very bready malt flavor. Nice that they eschewed the heavy crystal, caramel flavor many American interpretations have. Bitterness is moderate, but it dries out the clean finish a bit. The body is a tad watery and thin, but otherwise, a decent Okto."
"D: I could drink this beer all day long. I would have pint after pint of this beer at Brooklyn's Oktoberfest party! BA has a clear ""big ale"" preference. It's nice to see that brewers like Garrett Oliver are still making delicious lagers."
"D: This is a very nicely done Oktoberfest from Brooklyn. Definitely one of the top American marzens I've sampled. Balance is great, and the beer has a nice overall character. I was impressed by this one and would recommend it over most other fall seasonals."
"It's drinkable, with a watery consistency. It's not a bad brew, but it isn't terribly interesting. It would go well with brat, but the mustard may get in the way of the beer."
"In a pint glass, this beer was an amber color with a small tan head. Very minimal aroma of some sweet malt. There was a small improvement in the taste, with a bit of sweet caramel followed by some hops. Crisp in the mouth, but this beer didn't have much going for it."
"Pretty drinkable, solid beer."
"A really nice oktoberfest. Not too sweet with just enough maltiness and hops to balance out nicely. One of my favorite American Oktoberfests."
"D= I liked this beer a lot for its freshness and its boldness of flavor. The aroma could have been better but all in all this is a very tasty and highly sessionable oktoberfest."
"Pours a bright golden orange with a nice 1 inch head that quickly dissapears. Aroma is very malty and bready with a hint of raisins. However the taste falls flat. While there is a hint of malt and caramel, its way to watery. Not enough carbonation or snap from the malt. Its too bad as it looks and smells good, but just to bland on the flavor."
"Pours a clear dark orange amber with offwhite head, very nice lacing. Smell: light bready malts, tart, slightly grassy. Taste: lightly toasted, light on the munich malt flavors, grassy and a little salty. Mouthfeel: nice feel on this one, softer (and livelier) carbonation than most. This looks like a robust marzen but tastes like one of the lighter ofests. Drinkability is high for football season, but too light for my taste."
"Cheers!!"
"A great amber lager that one could get comfortable with on a fall evening. Excellent balance and just an overall very drinkable seasonal release."
"D - A nice clean lager with a good malt flavor, though it lacks some of the sweetness and aroma that could add to its depth. A good festbier overall; I could definitely take down a few of these."
"Drinkability: Really high. Nice flavors, refreshing carbonation. A solid beer for the style."
"D. A good tasting brew with just enough flavor to keep you coming back for more. Could be a great session beer."
"I don't believe I will be buying another of these."
"D: Very drinkable session beer for the fall. Nice work Brooklyn Brewery."
"D- pretty good. very drinkable."
"Overall, a typcial American Oktoberfest--nothing too exciting and in no way a threat to the German Fest biers. Have a couple if you want a typical US fest bier...Prosit."
"Drinkability: Good. Very pleasing overall, but not thrilling to me. It certainly is a drinkable brew and very refreshing. A good football beer."
"Bright and smooth on the palate with a tamed yet refreshing level of carbonation. Somewhat dry finish. Pleasant throughout."
"My first Octoberfest beer of 2009. The color is a light amber/copper. Not a huge head and it settles rather quickly leaving a thin ring and little lacing. Smells of sweet, toasted malt. Maybe a bit of caramel in there. Faint hoppy smell. Taste follows the nose: Starts off a little toasty and the sweetness follows. Light fruit taste, though I can't really place what fruit is there. The taste is well balanced, though not particularly strong. Smooth mouthfeel without a lot of carbonation. Leaves a moderate amount of malty stick in the mouth, but drinks pretty easy. Overall it's a decent Octoberfest."
"D: This is a solid Oktoberfeat from Brooklyn Brewery. Good flavor and character, I could easily drink quite of few of these."
"Brooklyn Oktoberfest poured a very nice full amber, with a nice tan head, and good lacing. The smell showed good malt, caramel, and hops. The taste seemed full of minerals, but only showed faint malt flavors. The taste was very balanced with the hops and malt, however it lacked a bit of sweetness for my taste, but was not an unpleasant flavor by any means. Mouthfeel was good, very nice crisp carbonation. Drinkability was nice. Overall this was a decent Ofest, I enjoyed it, but again it lacked sweetness for me. I would not turn one down. Also, I am glad that the 2009 Ofests are here!"
"D: drinks well, but not all too interesting; if Oktoberfest is primarily about quantity, rather than quality, this beer is spot on in that it is pleasing enough in the offing without distracting from moving on to another round"
"D- a very drinkable brew, nothing wrong w/ this one just not very memorable is all..."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my dimpled mug. Appears a slightly hazed rich apricot color with about two fingers of creamy, tight foam. Nose and flavor is of toasted grains, caramel malts, fall fruits such as apples and pears, and bread. Very malt forward, as it should be. I had no problem making it to the bottom of my mug. Worth a try."
"The Oktoberfest style is my favorite, but I really did like Brooklyn's interpretation of the style. I could see myself drinking a liter of this beer during Oktoberfest."
"Notes from and tasted on: 12/09/07"
"M: Very thin and moving towards the watery style. I normally only pick up the limited batches from Brooklyn and expect this Oktoberfest is on a macro style for a larger audience. Not impressed at all."
"Slight malty aroma. Pours deep bronze with a huge, fluffy head that leaves a solid lacing down the glass. Looks lively, carbonated. Taste is malty, not as much bready yeastiness as some of the German counterparts, some sweet caramel there. A little bit too carbonated, aside from that the palate is adequate. Good marzen, but there are better out there."
"12 oz bottle. Brownish amber pour with a thin tan head. Aroma of malt and brown sugar. Taste is sweet with some bread and caramel. Nice light finish, lacks the sharpness that most Oktoberfests display which is a plus or minus depending on your tastes. Really sweet for an Oktoberfest but style aside a very drinkable beer."
"Brooklyn Oktoberfest Beer pours an amber color with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is malty. The flavor is nice and malty, a touch of hops and a biscuit like malt finish. This is definitely a decent Oktoberfest, worth a try."
"Drinkability: very good. Goes great with pizza."
"M/D: The beer had a light body to it, smooth and easy to drink. Carbonation was good, may have a touch too much water to it, but this was the only part of the beer that it really fell down, or it could have just been the bottle. Left a dry aftertaste. Overall, a good beer and one that I will probably keep on stock during the fall."
"Taste is pleasant, earthy malts with a slight hop background. Beer is full and creamy - nice and suddy. This guy is flavorful and a solid beer."
"I've grown to really like the oktoberfest/marzen style, and this one hits the mark. I will seek this out again next year."
"D: Maybe worthwhile, not great, but worthwhile."
"Tasted on 11/9/08."
"A very drinkable American Oktoberfest with a slightly bigger body and a stronger hop profile. I enjoyed it."
"Overall-good version of the style, while I am dismayed that everyone has to do an Octoberfest in the same style I can't complain about Brooklyn's. It's really well made, strong flavored and smooth."
"Mouthfeel is refreshing, not overly carbonated but just enough. If you're a slow drinker, it may taste a little flat at the end. Absolutely drinkable, although it is on the sweeter side. I am usually a dark beer drinker, this is complex enough, and alluring in its flavors to be your only choice for the entire night."
"D: Not too bad. Seems too dry tonight but I'm sure me taster is off a tad."
"This is a nice session beer for the fall season. It's a little high on alcohol for a session beer, but it is very drinkable and refreshing. Dark amber in color, this beer pours a decent head. The aroma is mild but malty, and the taste is malty but a bit bland. The label claims this is brewed in the Marzen style. Of course, that's what you normally expect from an Oktoberfest, but this one is a bit drier than most, with a bit wimpier mouthfeel and a little less flavorful that I would like to have in a Marzen. Still, overall, a nice drinkable beer."
"Very good Oktoberfest. One of the better American ones that I've had."
"Pretty good for the style. I'd recommend it."
"Pours a clear medium amber color with red hues and a one finger white cloudy head made up of little bubbles with good retention and great lacing down the glass. Malty caramel and chocolate aromas combine with stone fruit. Lots of caramelized malt flavor with some chocolate, fruity yeast and light lemon hop flavors. Medium body, medium carbonaion, this is a very smooth mouth cleansing beer. Upon finishing one, you reach for another."
"Drinkability is not as high as I might have hoped for in an Oktoberfest and not as balanced as others I've tried so far this season. I would prefer a bit more malt body and complexity. Otherwise not a bad beer. As others have noted it's very much in style of the German Oktoberfests. Note: After drinking several of these I have revised my rating of it, quite drinkable and would definitely have again."
"Poures a nice amber/copper color with a 1-inch off white head that leaves a nice lacing. Good carbonation throughout. Aroma of sweet malt, bread and hop, maybe some toasted coffee as well. Taste is crisp. malty, toffee with some hop. Mouthfeel maybe is somewhat bready, almost chewy. Still a good oktoberfest."
"Nice ruby amber color with a very fine off white head that settles into a thin cap of suds that leave good lace on the glass. Nice fresh roasted coffee and sweet molasses fill the nose. Tastes like the real thing only fresher than I can get in the U.S., big and flavorful maltiness typical of the style. Nice roasty quality comes out as it warms slightly. Medium bodied and nicely carbonated. A very well made fest beer that really tastes more Euro than most. Worth checking out."
"Poured a clear coppery amber with 1 finger of slightly off-white head. Good retention and nice lacing. Smells of caramel, bread malts, butter, and floral hops. Tastes of light citrus up front then butterscotch, and caramel malt for a sweet solid backbone. Finishes with a nice crisp blast of floral hops. Medium in body with good carbonation. Smooth and sweet with a nice crisp finish. Easy to drink, goes down quickly and is easy to session."
"The body is really lacking for style. More on par of the macro-Ero style where it's a bit wispy and really lacking the Munich notes. Overall, I'm a bit disappointed."
"Good taste, some sweet malt up front and characteristic Oktoberfest bitter finish. Mouthfeel is good and rich for this style. Some Marzens are just too watery. Drinkability is good. This would be an awesome beer for a fall session."
"Simply average."
"Not bad stuff here, but nothing overly impressive."
"Brooklyn's got another nice beer here. It's not among the elite Oktoberfests of the season, but it's a very good choice. The only complaint I have is about the nose. It could use a little strengthening. But, other than that, it's a solid beer that's certainly a nice release in the fall lineup. Recommended."
"Notes: Overall it's a very drinkable tasty Oktoberfest."
"D: A decent Oktoberfest beer. Although a tad thin, it was a solid offering which I could/would have more of."
"I really enjoyed this. I will be seeking this out again as long as they are around, or next year."
"overall, an enjoyable Oktoberfest, I have been spoiled by previously living in Wisconsin where I feel the O-fests are the best, but this one will do just fine."
"This was a sturdy O-Fest from Brooklyn with dependable flavors and an easy drinkibility. Nothing REALLY stood out but you could definitley do worse this season."
"Drinkability: Easy to throw back a few, not overly heavy like some other Marzen styles, very much one of the better Octobers, taste and smell alone will have me coming back for more, definetley a good experience with this one."
"This is one of my favorite oktoberfests. The color is a rich amber, that still lets in light. The aroma is a nice malty overtones, with a slight hop presence. The taste is wonderful. The roasted malt is huge with a nice bitter kick to it. Very balanced. The mouthfeel is on the medium side, and it has great drinkability. a must have for the fall."
"D: Sits heavy in the stomach. The taste itself is very drinkable, but it made me feel really full."
"This American oktoberfest was one of the best of the year for me...the smell i got a hint of roasted malts and some carmel smells and for the taste i had pretty good carbonation, smooth feel with a sweet carmel finish. Mouth didnt feel thin at all a great oktoberfest beer. Drinkablitily of this beer is exceprtional ...i could drink it all day on a breezy ocotober day"
"Im ashamed to buy a Brooklyn beer being form Mass but hey its beer. A very nice deep amber color make me wanna chug it. Very little hed from my pour. A hoppy smells with a bit of sweetness. The taste much the same. A spicey hoppy taste with a hint of sweet malt. Light and crisp. Not a bad beer but I would prefer a little more caramel/malty flavor. Would recommend if your a hop head is search of a nice drinking beer."
"Drinkability: One of the better Oktoberfestbiers I've enjoyed this season, and a really good American interpretation of the style. Worth seeking out, even though I'm not a huge fan of the style. Abv% is eminently reasonable, it's flavorful, pleasant looking ... yeah. Not bad."
"Easy drinking Oktoberfest, I like this one."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle. The beer is dark copper orange with thick white foam. The smell and taste are grainy malts, a touch of hops spice and bitterness, mostly sweet. Nothing exceptional but I guess that's the style. Very drinkable but Oktoberfests aren't my thing in general."
"Drinks OK for the heaviness. Carbonation compensates but still a bit weighty for the mild flavor profile."
"This is a pretty decent brew, a good american rendition. Pick it up and give it a try if you see it, but I don't think this one is worth seeking out unless you find other brewery's offerings too malty."
"The flavor lacks complexity of top notch marzen beers and relies on a sweet malt soup."
"Sweet malt aromas and some sweet fruit esters. The appearance is a dark colored amber body w/ a quick dieing wispy white head, that hades into a tiny collar. The flavor is very dark roasted malt bodies, with some molasses like flavor, no real hop prescence. Nice moderate effervescence, very smooth. Nice session"
"A nice, drinkable beer overall, and a rather decent representation of the style. On-par with Brooklyn's consistency in putting forth good beer."
"A really nice beer. Solid, all around good."
"D- a decent beer and i could have a few of these but i wasnt impressed as i thought i would be. I love their Monster Ale and that is by far the best i have had from Brooklyn!"
"This is the best beer I've had from Brooklyn Brewery so far. It blew all of the other octoberfests I've tried (tried at least 12-15 others) out of the water. This one actually had a nice body to it and wasn't watery like the rest of them. Also, it had taste and a good one at that.. some nice spices and fall type seasonings. I thought I hated all octoberfests and this was the last one I had to try and it did the trick."
"D: A nice refreshing drink for a lazy mid-week afternoon of playoff baseball."
"D - Good beer. This is definitely a top 5 Oktoberfest."
"Pours a clear yet deep amber with a fast two finger, receding head. Very little bubbling and no lacing, but good color though. The aroma is a strong, sweet, toasted bread bomb of malt and just a bit of herbal hops. Toasted dry malts give the taste givs freshly baked whole grain wheat bread and bg of rice scent. The hops add some grassy herbs and just a dash of citrus. Palate is has an almost off-puting resiny palate for an Octoberfest bier. Great session beer wth a softly receding flavor."
"Drinkable, but not as good as I hoped for. Both Left Hand and Samuel Adams is better this year..."
"A nice oktoberfest, certainly drinkable and above average."
"Dissapointed? Yes."
"Reminds more of an average Vienna lager than a Märzen. A disappointment."
"A good, drinkable Octoberfest, one of the better domestic ones I have sampled this year."
"D: This one has been my least favorite so far."
"The feel is thick and fizzy (a little bit) and yet easy drinkin'. A nice bittersweet, spicy, malty, yeasty brew. Really nice."
"Longneck dumped into a large Ayinger glass. A rough pour produced a nice two-fingered off-white head. Red orange color and very clear. Aromas of burnt toast, crusty pretzel, bit of musty sweetness, toffee, and a hint of raisin. Flavor starts off with a bready/bitter combo and then moves into dark crust and toffee finishing with a bit of earthy hop bite. Feel is a bit bitey from the carbo, medium in weight with a creamy finish. This goes down nice with some German food. The dark toast malt flavors may get a little overwhelming after a few. Unique as far as Oktoberfests go. Could definately pick this out of a crowd of fest beers as Brooklyn's. Nice during the season."
"Served in a standard pint glass. Poured a translucent copper-red with good clarity. Half inch off-white head receded quickly. Some spatters of lacing but not legs. Mild nose - some malt and caramel character, but sweetness does not come out too much. Consistent with nose with a bready, toasted malt character at the finish. Mouthfeel is light with a consistent level of carbonation throughout. Good drinkability for the style. Oftentimes I find some of the sweetness characteristic of the style to be difficult to session as their is often a lingering aftertaste. However, subdued flavor profile makes it quite drinkable."
"Very well-balanced and enjoyable Oktoberfest beer, probably the best from the US I've tasted thus far."
"D- Good, could definitely drink a few of these. For me, that's more of just the style though, these are easily drinkable beers and this one's no exception."
"In comparison, the Bluepoint Oktoberfest was more drinkable; however, I felt this was was closer to the norm of the style."
"Overall, this may be my favorite Oktoberfest I've tried."
"Bottle / Artwork... A significant variation on the typical Brooklyn offering... The trademark ""B" is there and easily recognizable, but it is blended into a well designed rust colored label with a powerful yellow font..."
"D: One of my favorite sweet marzens with the fuller body of most American offerings with the low grain, German flavor."
"M + D: Assertive carbonation, rather crisp. A refreshing brew that offers a little break-away from the style norm. Worth trying, and a nice take on the style."
"a very tolerable interpretation of an oktoberfest. have had around 10 now, and still not sure how much i'll mis it. good but not great, with a muted qualtity (at least partly inherent in the style?) yet the hops and toastiness seem to warrant a bit more crispness. but today sessioning for the first time. 3 down the gullet so far, and hmmm, pretty good! the more i have the better it's getting. so apparently quite drinkable."
"D - A decent oktoberfest, a lot like most others I've had so far. Definitely sessionable, but nothing mindblowing."
"MF&D - Medium/full bodied with lots of flavor. A solid Oktoberfest choice."
"Overall I was a bit disappointed. It's not a bad beer, but it's not what I've come to expect from an Oktoberfest Bier. It's just too roasty. Worth a shot if you're into that flavor."
"Clear amber as it lays in the glass with a big frothy head. Head slowly disappates leaving very little lacing. Slight smoke smell that quickly gives way to fruity malt aroma. Taste toasted malt and caramel sweetness associated with the color. Some spiciness in there as well. I would almost say some nutmeg and/or cinnamon...maybe my imagination. Mouthfeel and taste is alittle on the thin side. Thiness makes it go down really well and gives it a thirst quenching character. A good O'fest that I would reach for again."
"I don't know anything about this style and this is the first Oktoberfest I've reviewed, but I could be fully satisfied with a giant mug of this before me resting on a wooden table under an outdoor tent with only my lederhosen to keep me warm."
"A beer to enjoy during the fall months. Will be purchasing more."
"I would get on draft over some other typical choices. Dont think I would seek out a 6 pack."
"Overall- A great representation of the style. I ushered in the cooler weather with a glass of this while grilling and listening to college football on the radio. It then paired nicely with the chicken burgers with bbq sauce. I'd drink it again."
"I think it's a very good beer. Another solid brew from Brooklyn, in my biased opinion."
"Recommended..."
"Smooth and with fine carbonation, Brooklyn's Oktoberfest is exceptionally mild and very drinkable."
"Overall, Brooklyn Oktoberfest is another solid beer from the Brooklyn Brewery. Recommended."
"D- It's a good tasting beer... I think it's a bit more complex than what I've seen from Oktoberfests like Spaten, Hacker-Pschorr, Ayinger etc. Like I said previoiusly, it has the exact same flavor profile of a brown ale, maybe minus a shade of sweetness."
"Served a crisp dark orange with a thin diminishing head that diminishes to nothing. Aroma was a nice blend of toasted sweet caramel malt and slight hops. Taste was more of the same and great for the style. The beer is quite light and crisp. This is a very decent example of the style."
"Probably the second best Octoberfest behind Hacker-Pschorr, sweet and dry make this a great brew."
"Drinkability is great. The dry malt taste leaves you wanting another sip. It is somewhat high in ABV at 5.5%, but you can't taste it at all. Great session beer."
"Notes: Fine brew,I will certainly buy more and the it was light enough to have on a cool August night. I can say this one is a keeper."
"Amber colored beer that has a head that fades and remains about a quarter of an inch.Taste and aroma are both slightly caramel.I would drink again although I doubt I would pay for it.It doesn't really get more average than this.Not horrible or great,just kinda run of the mill."
"I had forgotten how much I liked this Brooklyn seasonal. Not as cloying nor sweet as some craft Marzens. Nice cloudy orange/amber in the glass, soft 1/2"" foamy head; nice caramel malt in the nose with just a hint of spicy (not fruity) hops. Perfectly balanced and the taste is really enjoyable. Extremely drinkable Oktoberfest and another win for Brooklyn (or Utica--where the brewery is)."
"D: Overall not a good example per style and wouldn't recommend or try again."
"Poured a dark, ruby red/crimson body that was seethru w/ slight carbonation. Half-finger head that is a little foamy w/ constant lacings. A spicy smell at first, clove mostly, and then caramel after that; not much else. A malty taste mostly, mixed with caramel and something like tart apples(?). A generic spicing is in the taste also; not the most complex beer but its mediumish body goes down smooth and is paired with a crisp, dry finish. A good beer, but just not something I would pick as my first Octboberfest seasonal."
"overall a nice solid O-fest of which I could have several"
"This beer, which is fine, is the weakest link of all the great Brooklyn beers. But that sounds a lot worse than it is. This is a good beer from a brewery that brews great beer."
"Very clear and reddish amber, this beer was topped by a fluffy, off-white head that showed good retention and produced sticky, chunky lace. The aroma was full of grainy malt with a bit of caramel, grass, and spice in the background. Light, yet solid, bitterness and a clean maltiness defined the flavour, with notes of warm caramel, spice and hops providing complexity. Maltiness really lingered. Nearly medium bodied with average carbonation, just off-dry with a good texture. This beer is highly drinkable, well balanced and great for a session."
"Drinkability- I enjoyed this one. The guys in Brooklyn should be proud."
"Final thoughts- Damn I should have visited the Brewery while out there."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a nice O-fest beer that I could drink several of if were in the mood for the style. The only problem with this beer is that I find Brooklyns prices to be slightly higher than most other craft breweries and this beer isnt really outstanding enough to make me select it over any other good O-fest beer."
"The taste mirrored the smell, as the nuttiness was the first noticeable trait, followed by an intense caramel sweetness and light fruit flavors. There is even a slight hop bitterness to really round out this beer. I was surprised at how 'full' this beer tasted. Another excellently crafted beer from Brooklyn, and one of the better Oktoberfests I tried this season."
"This beer is immensely drinkable. its very smooth and a lil dry on the finish. it pairs well with lots of food and seems like a beer to come back to."
"Notes: The best domestic Oktoberfest I've had to date. The hop bite is definitely an American twist on the style, but it isn't overdone and really works."
"Prosit!"
"An OK rendition of the style, but for a regularly available domestic Ill stick with SAs."
"12 oz. bottle in a willibecker...moderate malt in the aroma...clear solid amber body, with a large white head that settles to thin inconstancy...very little activity in body...creamy gentle feeling to tongue...moderately sweet at start and a pleasing finish....hops are subtle at the end...smooth, comfortable and fall appropriate...an average approximation of the style..."
"Drinkability: definitely full of flavor, but too much on the bitter hop side. Carbonation and mouthfeel make for easy consumption. I would like more malty sweetness."
"Notes: I went back and forth on the scoring in a couple categories -- taste and mouthfeel. Early on, the taste score deserves a 3 b/c of the strong metallic taste, but that seems to subside and it tastes more like the malt you'd expect after a few sips. So I gave it the 3.5. The mouthfeel really is a tad bit light and thin, I thought, but it wins points on creaminess. So I figured averaging out the two categories (T & M) with a 3.5 in taste and a 3.0 in mouthfeel was appropriate. Ideally I'd suggest this beer deserves about a 3.25 in each category and an overall score around 3.5 (it did look nice; hence the higher appearance score). It's not a bad beer at all, but I've had better Oktoberfests."
"Overall - A nice American slant on an Oktoberfest.. an excellent balance of hops and maltiness makes this very quaffable... recommended.."
"Pours transparent copper with slow carbonation. Only a thin sheen of head, but nice persistent lace. Aroma features well-rounded toasted caramel malt with strong nutty notes and a touch of spice. Flavor is very similar. Lots of toasted malts with nutty biscuit overtones on hard mineral water. Finish is a bit sweet, with very little hop presence. In the mouth, the beer is medium-rich, creamy and with only a little carbonation. A very conservative interpretation, but pleasing and easy-drinking."
"3.0. Average O'fest I'd drink if it was all that was available for the style, but I've had some better ones for sure."
"D - Went quite well with a hearty bowl of veggie soup. This is a great dinner beer, but after 2 I'd be ready to move on. All in all not bad, but not big on taste. I would have one again."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and very creamy. Perfect level of carbonation and medium mouthfeel. Highly drinkable and sessionable. While it isn't an eye opening beer its a great fall beer and brew to enjoy while watching a game."
"After meeting Garrett Oliver at a recent tasting of his collaboration beers Brooklyner Schneider Hopfen Weisse and Schneider Brooklyner Hopfen Weilsse with Schneider & Son's Hans Peter Drexler, I knew I had to have more of the Brooklyn offerings. What better time than Oktoberfest to try Brooklyn's interpretation of the Marzen style. The appearance of this brew is a beautiful, lusty copper-bronze with nice steady carbonation bubbles and a thin skin of head after the pour into my nonic glass. The aroma is difficult to discern, but appears as the brew warms in the glass. Bready malt comes thru with perhaps a whiff of butter and turnips. The taste is also bready and full with malty overtones and a slight bitterness and metal in the finish. Again, the flavor becomes more pronounced as it warms up. The mouthfeel is smooth to moderately bitter and the carbonation is evident. Not a session brew, but certainly one to enjoy as part of your Oktoberfest celebration."
"Deep copper with auburn highlights and a thick, lacy, light khaki head. Nose of cookie dough malts, caramelized cooked carrots, and spicy, noble hops. Nice. Taste starts off with toasted, caramelly malts. Herbal hop bitterness around the edges. Clean cookie dough malt sweetness mid-palate, but balanced by the spicy hops. Crisp, hop-tinged finish. Moderate body with a snappy feel. A nicely balanced Marzen."
"Notes: No need to let this beer warm up. It tastes its best directly out of the fridge."
"This one is a good example of an Oktoberfest beer. Good blend of flavors and not one is too over powering."
"Rather thin bodied, but not as smooth as the style should be. It has a decent taste, but not as malty and smooth as I would like in an O-fest. This brewery makes a great lager, but this Marzen lager is nothing special."
"Recommended"
"Very nice amber color with a short white head. Very clean and fresh malty aroma. Fresh malty taste with a nice clean and dry ending. It tastes the way an Oktoberfest is supposed to. The finish is clean and fresh. The dry ending leaves you wanting more and more. This is one very drinkable beer. Thank the good lord for Oktoberfest."
"Pours a deep reddish amber with a one-finger tan head that dissipates rather quickly. This is a nice looking beer. The smell is sweet and malty with not much hops. The taste is very similar to the smell: malty and slightly sweet. There is hardly any bitterness or aftertaste. The mouthfeel is crisp and dry. Drinkability is very good as these go down easy. Overall, a decent Oktoberfest but nothing special."
"12 ounce bottle, served in a ""new style"" Sam Adams Boston Lager glass. The beer pours a nice amber color with an inch and a half off-white frothy head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells like bread/grain, toasted malt and caramel, it's definitely a sweet aroma. Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, with a bit of spice too. Very little aftertaste. Body/mouthfeel is medium/full, it's smooth and has just the right amount of carbonation IMO. Drinkability is good, easy to drink and very sessionable. This is one of the better Oktoberfest beers I've had, it's definitely a good choice."
"Poured into a tulip pint glass. Color was a dark red amber with a 2 finger thick foamy head. The head dissipated quickly and left no lacings. Smell reminded me of multi grain whole wheat bread. Taste was good. Very slightly sweet, with a kick of orange zest at the end. Felt ok in the mouth. Too bitter to be very easily enjoyable. Coated ok. A solid oktoberfest."
"This is a very good Oktoberfest, especially since I like the less bitter Okts."
"D: Goes down pretty smooth, but the carbonation burns a bit. Decent enough to drink a couple."
"Brooklyn's Oktoberfest is a crisp, sweet and warming autumn beer that would go down great with either some late fall camping or at your Oktoberfest BBQ. It's not the most complex Oktoberfest on the market, but it's still a pretty good call."
"12oz bottle purchased from Clarendon Wines in Boston. Pours a clear, rich copper with a bit of head. Aroma is a bit indistinct. Taste follows - fairly indistinct. Some malts, not a lot of hops. Nothing standing out in this one to make me want to buy it again. Yawn."
"Overall, I was excited to try this brew, but it fell far short of my expectations. The look/smell was perfectly fine, but the taste was disappointingly bland, and the mouthfeel was simply odd and uninteresting. I almost feel strange rating this beer so lowly since nothing about it was awful; it's just that nothing about it was great either."
"Drinkability: Very! I had a 20 oz. at MacGregors with lunch and could have easily gone for more."
"This beer tries to be a big Oktoberfest beer, but ends up a big amber lager. Too rough along the edges for an Oktoberfest. However, it does make for a nice big, malty lager."
"This isnt a bad beer.Ive had worse Ofest beers,this isnt overly sweet like the one I tried in the past.Good beer."
"Not a bad Oktoberfest. It has good complexity, which is the characteristic to look for in a good Oktoberfest. The bad ones generally don't taste bad, but just taste like a regular lager or a Vienna Lager if it's only semi-bad. Certainly worth a try."
"D-i do like me some fall beers, and this is a good one. as above, this year's version is more complete and balanced than '06. i will be enjoying these after work for the next month or so."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. Appearance is a dark-reddish hued amber color, clear, thin fizzy head a finger high quickly dissipates to moderate sticky lacing. Aroma is sweet malt, grassy hoppiness, light notes of apple, caramel, roasted malt, toast. Taste is well balanced, opens with a roasty sweetness of malt, smooth transition to a light hoppiness, finishes with a drying slightly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is slightly rougher due to higher levels of carbonation,but pairs well with the more moderate body. Drinkability is good, easily has more substance than most O'fests out there, great blend of malt/hoppiness, smooth and roasty. Would purchase again ."
"The smell of this beer right out of the bottle is not good; I'm detecting a metalic, musty, maltish tone. The smell improves to a flattish soda with a tin can finish. The beer pours a nice amber, modest carbonation, some head, lacing, and retention. The beer is a bit watery and this another mark against it. As for taste, there is an almond, caramel, metallic taste that isn't bad, but as the carbonation thins, I'm getting too much flat soda notes. There is the typical nutty malts characteristic of the style, and considering I just had a Wachusett Octoberfest that had no resemblance to the name, this one at least is representative of the style, it's just not all that impressive. The finish and aftertaste are good, and a little on the dryish side."
"I enjoyed this. Might get more before they stop production."
"Mr. Oliver has another winner on his hands, although I think he toned down the malt sweetness from the 2006 version. This one remains a fave American version of mine."
"Pours an amber red with a modest off white head that lingers and leaves nice lace rings throughout. Kind of a tosty grainy malt aroma. Malt up front with a hint of caramel and finishes bitter and dry.Moderately carbonated, this goes down pretty easy but that sudden bitter drying effect at the end causes some pause."
"Overall--- 3.3 out of 5. A good beer that I would recommend. It is just not my personal favorite."
"Overall, very easy to drink. A good rendition of a good style. I look forward to it every year."
"Poured this one into my favorite pint glass. A vanilla-malty aroma wafted up to my nose before I even stuck my nose in to take a whiff. The next thing I noticed was this beer's gorgeous shade of amber. Exactly the way I would want an Oktoberfest style beer to look. My first swig was nice and crisp all the way through. Hints of cherries and a bit of citrus with very little lingering after taste. Reasonable complexity as far as lagers that I've tasted go. Very drinkable aside from a bit of acidic bitterness."
"D: A pretty drinkable beer. The tart flavor makes it a little bittersweet, but overall I'd have to say it is good and easy to drink."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a red copper color with a rather dense cream colored head. The smell is of caramel malts not much else, all in all pretty faint. The brew starts off with a noticable metallic twang. Tastes like it was brewed with hard water as it has a mineral presence. Caramel and toasted malts mix together with a subtle hop flavor. The feel is moderate and has a creamy texture to it, finishes slightly bitter. Definitely one of the more maltier Oktoberfests that I have tried and one that is more bitter than sweet."
"Pours a medium amber color with the usual foam. Glass is clean so doubt that would affect the head. Sweet and malty upfront with that smokiness that I like. Taste is much of the same, except that it has a nice bitterness in the back of the tongue and goes down really smooth. I'd definitely say it's tastier than the other Octoberfest-themed beers I've reviewed."
"Drinkability - Very much so. I could enjoy plenty of these babies. Good offering from Brooklyn."
"Very nice deep orange color with a decent head that fades right away. Low aroma-somewhat malty with a slight bite. Slightly sulfur-ish. Mild malty flavor with an underlying hop bite. Somewhat metallic tinge to it. Good body for the style. Ok overall. I love Brooklyn products but this is a notch above average. I need to find a US Oktoberfest I can really wrap my tongue around-have yet to do so."
"One of my favorite Oktoberfests. This year's version is no exception."
"Overall a very good brew. Very enjoyable."
"Well done by Brooklyn Brewery."
"Pours a copper color with a tan head that billows up to the top of the glass then dies down to leave a thin layer on top of the pumpkin colored brew. Smell is spices, maybe some coriander, some cinnamon. Malt flavors dominate the taste buds. The mouthfeeling is light and smooth letting your tongue taste some of the spices more. One of the best Oktoberfest beers I've had so far this year."
"Pours a clear copper with a finger of head after a strong poor that dies quick. Smell is extremely faint of malt and spice. Taste equivocates the smell. Malty semi dry finish. Drinks very well as its refreshing but leaves something to be desired with this style."
"D - I had 3 of these with food, no problem. I'll savor the next 3 over the course of the evening and get some more tomorrow."
"Drinkability- Having tasted ten or so examples of Oktoberfest beers, my problem with this one is the lasting hop bitterness that feels out of place. Considering the festival mindset that would encourage multiple replenishments, I would pass this up for something else."
"D-This is perhaps my favourite oktoberfest. Especially good when fresh which it is now. Glad I have a sixer of this in the fridge."
"Drinkability- Well I just opened up my first for the night, it's at the perfect temperature, I got it out before it cooled too long and had to sit before it was fit for tasting. I am going to drink this all night, and I could all fall with only a few pumpkin brews in between. This is my favorite beer among them all. There are those that are more graceful, and those with more flavor but this is the beer that I always come to remember when thinking of beer I wish I could have that I know is not available during the spring and summer. Thank you Brooklyn, you have won me over."
"This is a very good festbier from Garrett Oliver and company once again. Beautiful to look and a pleasure to drink, I could not have chosen a more suitable American craft beer to help me welcome the fall seasonals. Can't wait for more Oktoberfests like this to follow."
"This beer is smooth and medium bodied. Very drinkable. I will revisit this Oktoberfest in a couple of weeks. I can definitely drink this beer all night."
"D- Very drinkable. Not the best Oktoberfest available, but a good example of the style."
"M/D- Hearty for a lager like the oktoberfests are supposed to be, moderate carbonation and medium in body. Great for the season...I probably bought about a case between september and noverber."
"D- Superb drinkability, great balance between flavours. i really wish they made this in 50cl bottles, 33cl just isnt enough. However, to me its not a true marzen, there is far too much hoppy floral aroma and taste, but one i would definitely not turn down."
"This beer pours a medium brown color with a great deal of red highlighting. The head is fairly small and fades to a thin layer of bubbles which laces a bit. The smell is biscuit like caramel and toasted malts with some spicy hoppiness, very pleasant. The taste is dominated by the strong grainy malty presence but also contains a good deal of bitterness and spice from german hops. This Oktoberfest is less sweet and more bitter than others that I've had in the past, I may prefer them to be a bit on the sweeter side. The mouthfeel is good, the body is full with lower levels of carbonation. The beer finishes dry with just a hint of a bitter aftertaste. Good drinkability here too, this is a well done beer maybe not my personal favorite but a good representative of the style."
"A very drinkable marzen, well interpreted by the Brooklyn brewery."
"Drinkability: With a rich, complex array of flavors, and an ease of drinkability, this, to me, is one of the better American Oktoberfests."
"Nice beer, I look forward for October to drink beer."
"Lighter in body & flavor then other märzen style beers, the focal point seems to be more focused on drinkability, which is excellent."
"This one falls off a little in the taste department. Very straightforward and one dimensional. The rich chewy malt of the nose isn't so rich in the mouth. It's mainly just an aftertaste. This may be slightly too carbonated and it's covering up much of the flavor and balance. Drying hop on the ending but nothing really stands out about this beer."
"Overall- A delicious Oktoberfest. I was given a leftover 6 pack from a party and think this was a excellent score. Too bad this is a seasonal!"
"A good looking pour, darkish red. Aroma pretty good but nothing stands out. Same with the taste, decent but nothing screamingly amazing. Average mouthfeel as everything fades rapidly. Good drinkability as it's a fairly innocent beer. Not amazing but not bad. Not bad."
"Pours a dark copper color with a lace of head. Carbonation is minimal on this one. I can barely see any bubbles. Smells of scotch and roasted malts. Goes down smooth with a hint of hops in the aftertaste and more carbonation than it seems initially. The is probably the best oktoberfest I've had and if there more bubbles I could see myself giving this all 5's."
"Overall, this is a pretty easy to drink Marzen. While not the best one I've had, it certainly is better than a lot of them. Recommended."
"Pours a clear copper, thick white head, some lacing, decent retention, head settles down to a ring. Smell is sweet, citrus, bread, little bit of smoke, some caramel. Taste is toffee, some smoke, citrus, bread, very malty and balanced. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. Nice Oktoberfest, very refreshing and drinkable. Thanks grub!!"
"Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for the taste."
"Poured from bottle to glass at 55 degrees. Beer had a good head at first then was gone before I sat down almost. As usual from this Brewer it is a decent beer and fresh tasting unlike a lot of this type beer. I liked the beer but will most likely not seek to purchase again."
"Drinkability is high here due to the wonderful flavor and low alcohol content. Good beer."
"12 oz bottle. This brew pours a solid amber color with a finger of head composed of large bubbles. There is a moderate amout of carbonation working its way up to the surface. Clarity on this one is excellent. The head falls to a full coating over top. The aroma is a moderate bready and toasty character with a light honey-kissed sweetness. Nothing wrong here. I am hit with a solid toasty melanoidan character to start, followed by a mild herbal hoppyness that moves to a light bitterness. It finishes with a solid graineyness. The hops just don't accentuate the other flavors in the beer. I feel like they stand out too much where the malt should be the theme of the brew. The mouthfeel is moderate with a very nice moderate carbonation of large bubbles. This is not my favorite Oktoberfest brew that I have had recently. The hops just are not doing it for me."
"An average offering. Most stores carrying this will carry a better beer in style. Obviously would go well with a plate of wurst. Far from bad, but others are better. If looking to try a variety in the style, this is worth a look."
"drinkability is great. refreshing and enjoyable beer."
"Redish gold color with a thick 3 finger tan head, a beautiful beer. The head leaves lacing on the glass as it dissipates to tan swirls on the surface. Smell is pleasant but I'm not picking out anything in particular 'cause I'm a little congested. Carbonation is perfect, alcohol slightly apparent (which is good, IMHO), and mouth feel is overall quite smooth. Taste is that of a typical good Oktoberfest, a little hoppy, medium roasted malt, and I get a little fruitiness in there too, maybe apricotish, but only because I'm searching for something. Very drinkable."
"Medium-full bodied with medium carbonation, thick in the mouth, very nice. I am a little disappointed in Brooklyn's job here. It looks and feels great, but the important parts are oddly lacking and out of whack."
"Overall: One of the best American interpretations of the style I've had. This one is a must if you're a fan of the style. Even if you're not you should give it a try. Yet another top notch offering from the Brooklyn Brewery."
"M&D - smooth and rich, very nice mouthfeel, without it being to bitter, which means the girlfriend liked it, which is a plus"
"All in all, a solid representaion of the style. If you like Marzens, this one wont disapoint."
"Drinkability is good, it's well rounded beer, I'm just not sure but I probably won't buy more, until next year. It just did not wow me. MK"
"Overall a good Oktoberfest. Nothing spectacular, but definitely enjoyable."
"I've had 3 Brooklyn beers now and the consensus is, they are very average. They rival summit. This beer has no head at all, no lacing down the glass and is medium bodied. Doesn't taste bad but for the money, I'd rather have Sam Adam's Oktoberfest. Has some decent caramel malty flavors but not something I will ask for in the future. However, after a couple more years of tasting the brew has become a decent fest beer."
"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date. It pours a lightly-hazed coppery/amber with an inch of tan head that leaves good lacing. It smells of rich grains, molasses, nuts, and raisins - overall deep and sweet malts. The flavor is very rich - like chewing on barley - with caramel, chocolate, and molasses malts, nuts (pecan?), and oily, leafy/green hops that leave a medium bitterness. The body is on the heavy side of medium, with medium carbonation and a medium to long finish. Overall a very nice märzen, but one of the few drawbacks is that it is a bit full to be a great session beer. However, with food, or just having one or two after work is ideal."
"Pretty good example of a style thats not one of my favorites. This and Sam are the best American ones. Worth a sixer."
"A deep amber color with a eighth of an inch off white head. Strong malt aroma, sweet in its fragrance and strong in its presence. That strong maltiness is there in the flavor, with touch of hop bitterness at the end. Medium bodied, slightly crisp, leaves the palate very clean. Immensely drinkable, very smooth going, an excellent marzen style beer."
"This is an overall average oktoberfest showing. Definetly not one of my favorites, and definetly not the worst. Had a reddish orange hue. Not to much head. Had a little bit too much carbonation for my liking. Too much malt flavor, wasnt a real big fan of that. Overall it wasnt as bad as some i have tried. Worth a shot, if only once."
"12 ouncer, no freshness indication. This one pours a warm, dark shade of almond amber, clear with a slight light tan head. Mudium bubbles rising to the top and just a smidge of lacing left on the glass. The nose is faintly of just some malt. O'fest is not my favorite style, and this one sort of sums up why, its pretty boring, on the sweet side, and doesn't offer much complexity or interest. Malty, a hint of maple and a dull malty finish with perhaps a hint of spice. Ho hum, best thing about the style is its utility as a marinade, chicken, pork whatever."
"Notes: Much better than the '05 version, which I found to be quite thin for an Oktoberfest. However, not as complex as the '04 (my all time favorite O'fest)."
"Poured a rust and dark copper color with a white head and a nice thick bubble-laiden mask. Aromas of caramel, powdered sugar, and malt. Smoke and roasted flavors dominate with a hint of toffee. The roasted flavors work well with the sweet grain flavors that follow. Sweet and smooth with a mild bitter finish."
"Notes: My first review but I have to say that out of the 4 or 5 different Oktoberfest/Marzen beers I've had this season this is by far the best tasting."
"Drinkability - a good craft OFest, I'd like to see this on tap at an Oktoberfest near me someday."
"Big malty nose. Poured with a fairly small head that didn't linger long. Taste is clean, crisp and malty. Hops appear for a brief moment followed by a bit of astringency. Mouthfeel is on the thin side with a fairly prickly carbonation. I don't generally find O'fest beers to be all that exciting, and this falls into that category. However, it's a well crafted balanced brew that's easy to enjoy."
"D: Very easy-going marzen, but not stand-out, at least on tap. Still, this could turn into a couple orders in a session."
"Drinkability is so-so. This is oktoberfest is not particularly enjoyable. I will not try this next year given the much better examples available for fall enjoyment."
"We picked up a few bottles at the Park Slope Food Coop. Poured from bottle a deep copperish brown. The smell was subtle scent and with a hint of honey. A very malty flavor. My wife remarked it tasted like bread (in a good way). The mouth feel was smooth and felt strong on the back of the tongue. Highly drinkable; went great with tacos al pastor."
"A pretty good American interpretation of the style. A good blend of caramel, bread, and earthy hops. Still doesn't seem to have the body and smoothness of good German Oktoberfests. Has a light metalic taste and feel, but nice flavors nonetheless. Has a light minty / alcoholic note in the end and remains bready, caramelly, and yeasty. Clean and crisp in the finish."
"Very nice oktoberfest, clean, extremely flavorful and extraordinarily drinkable."
"Foamy white head sits on a copper brown beer. The nose gives off some sweet honey, strawberry, and faint apricot. I get next to nothing when I drink this, a tinny flavor, a bit of spice (hop). Not much here. A decent mouthfeel and a fairly clean finish."
"D: Again, like good Marzens (and this definitely falls into that category), it's dangerously easy to drink. If I hadn't seen the label, I would have thought for sure this was an import."
"such a good smell. man. and that first part of the taste. too bitter"
"Wow, this is heads and shoulders above last year's version. I almost didn't try it, but luckily the cool guy at the liquor store urged me to give it another shot. Definitely drinkable, and a completely solid O-fest offering."
"Not quite a true Oktoberfest, but a nice American take on it. The malts are a little richer than traditional fest beers, but its still pretty tasty. A lot of grains in the aroma. Flavor is more grains, almost wheat-like with a touch of spicey Bohemian hops along with caramel and malty flavors. Definately a winner."
"D: Pretty refreshing and crisp O'fest--reminds me of a brisk fall afternoon."
"O: Out of the three O-fests I've recently tried (Victory, & Sam Adams). This one is my favorite."
"Overall, this was a decent beer. I have never been too excited about this style but it is growing on me. This beer has made me want to try several more oktoberfest brews this fall, so it was a good choice on draft."
"Cheers!"
"This one was on SkinnyElvis."
"The beer leaves almost nothing on the glass, but it's a great color in the glass. Looks, smells, and tastes like beer. I enjoy the Brooklyn Brewery's products, but I remember liking this one more. Still a very good beer I'd recommend to any beer drinker. Distinct type of flavor from German Oktoberfest labeled lagers (Spaten, e.g.), but I much prefer Brooklyn's Oktoberfest over other American Oktoberfests such as Harpoon's."
"Really not a whole lot to it other than that. It's a solid brew, no flaws to speak of, just above average overall."
"Pours copper. Tan head, decent retention, and nice lacing. Smell is mild. It is a mix, of hops,and malt with grainy overtones. Body is medium with some carbonation. Taste is smooth, and malty up front with bit of a bitter finish. Worth a try, but would not more than one or two at a time for me."
"I prefer Paulner's version this year."
"I expected a bit more from Brooklyn. Although this is a pretty good beer, I don't think it stacks up to the rest of Brooklyn's lineup, or a few other domestic oktoberfests for that matter."
"Almost a medium body with a broad but mild carbonation. Definitely sessionable, but perhaps not the most enticing."
"Overall a scrumptious and flavorful hearty Oktoberfest lager. Definitely not shy bringing flavor and dimension to the table. I wonder if the Spaten's and Hoffbrau's used to be like this 20-30 years ago? Anyway, thanks Brooklyn for a tremendously delicious lager that will definitely have a place in my fridge every September."
"This beer pushe the limits of taste with big malts, some hop flavouring and some dry bitterness in the finish; perhaps too much carbonation, it still is a drinking beer with flavour, rather than a flavourful beer that you could drink a bunch of."
"Drinkability: This is a highly drinkable early fall beer that goes perfect with the start of the leaves changing, football season, and cooler winds. Enjoy!"
"D: Yeah, I could drink a few of these. This hit the spot on a cool day. I'll be drinking more of these this fall, for sure."
"Cheers."
"It has a sharp, slightly hoppy front, with good carbonation, and a moderately smooth finish that is impressively creamy. Very crisp. Malt is moderate throughout, but stands out in a sweet, flavorful aftertaste. Somewhat sweet, tart, thin, and spicy throughout."
"Pours a thin layer of head over a murky-brown-rust colored liquid. Smells of munich malt with caramel. Smooth wet sweet. A little bit of an O'fest funk. Well done so far. Taste is quite simple. Wet sweet caramel and a touch of tang. Some toasted malts and perhaps a touch of tannin. Cardboard and peanut butter with searching. Md body and moderate carbonation. Simple yet quite enjoyable."
"Tastes of rich caramel malt. A solid hop profile underneath the malt. A bit sour oddly enough. Mouth is quite sticky and sweet. This is decent but too sweet for more than a couple."
"D: A well-produced and quite drinkable beer with a malty, traditional Oktoberfest taste that has a bit of a twist in its deep, caramel sweetness."
"This is a beer you could chug down, which is not how I associate Brooklyn's brews. A bit too metallic and as a few other reviewers have stated, even a bit of olive in the aftertaste. The bottle says it's an amber lager but I would tweak the tone down and notes up if I had to redo this. Only worth a shot to compare to other Octoberfests, and sadly enough, it makes me wish for the other Brooklyn seasonals."
"A good representation of the oktoberfest style. It brings to mind many comparisons to German brewed oktoberfests. Plenty of aroma and flavor to keep it interesting."
"Brooklyn Brewerys Oktoberfest is the most beautiful in appearance of a recent sampling I did of several American Fest brews a deep mahogany hue with a creamy head and aromas of whiskey and honey. Those aromas come through in the flavor as well, with the initial sweetness of clover honey, whiskey and even a hint of maple. Theres a chewy, doughy middle to this one that leads into a gradually building bitterness. Subtle floral and grassy flavors come through from the hops. It has a round, full mouthfeel, with a slightly syrupy thickness. Overall, the most complex of the American Fests we tried, and the most comparable to the German originals."
"Poured a 12 ounce bottle I got from a friend of mine. A rather pale copper color, very murky, cloudy. Almost reminded me of apple cider or iced tea or even a dark Hefeweizen (it was so cloudy). Very poor head retention with next to no lacing at all. Quite crisp and a little bland from the amount of carbonation present, but any hint of roasted malts or hops is very hidden. Give it some time and a fruity character (apple cider again?!) and a smooth maltiness emerge, but the blandness kicks in then. You wouldn't want to take your time with this one; it's not a sipping beer in which the flavors become more robust with time. Just slightly above average for my taste."
"Cloudy orange color with very thin head that goes flat right away. OK flow of carbonation bubbles. Smell is a very mild bready. Taste is also bready. Almost no hops character to speak of but that is appropriate for the style. Mouthfeel is thin. I can't really recomend this beer. Just a slighly above average across the board. Nothing really wrong with it but it has no backbone."
"Had this beverage at the Brooklyn Brewery Jazz Cafe at Newark Airport. I was a bit surprised to see this on-tap. I had it in a tall Pilsner, which revealed a nice amber colour to it. The armor was average, nothing outstanding or memorable. It tasted malty instantly, though it ended a bit bland. I expected a more hoppy ending. Easy on the inside; I was able to polish off the Pilsner in short time. I wouldn't go after it again, however, I would like to try it at the Brooklyn Brewery plant to see if it would have the same effect on me."
"Id like to try it again on tap somewhere else to re-compare the two."
"One of the better October offerings I've had. Medium amber topped with an off-white frothy head that faded quickly. Malt a bread on the nose, perhaps some brown sugar, light and pleasant. Taste was more of the same with a bigger kick of sugar/caramel. Taste remained constant over the tongue, no real aftertaste, not overwhelming with typical steak & potatos food. Good feed and quite drinkable."
"This is a really good example of an Oktoberfest Marzen, a hoppy, tasty, attractive beer with a nice finish. Seems my report of the demise of Brooklyn is premature, which is outstanding news."
"Taste is pretty simple. Nice malty upfront, that quickly rounds out in a sliughtly hoppy finish. There is a slight hop aftertaste that tails off with some maltyness. Kind of a nice Vice versa. Pretty drinkable, and a bonus becuase the flavors blens so well"
"Pours a clear copper-amber with a medium-sized, off-white, foamy head that doesnt last too long before fading to a thin film. Very little lacing. The smell is quite malty, of course, with earthy aromas of caramel, bread, light flowers and nuts and a little apple. The taste is a bit sweet, with caramel being most notable, but the roasted malts are backed up nicely by a grassy hop bitterness. This one was enjoyable. I love a good, big, maltoberfest, but this one has more balance than Ive been finding this year. Nicely done."
"An easy drinkable beer. Some hop and carbonation. Malty and carmel finish. Light mouthfeel. amber colour and a little off-white head.Dry slightly astringent aftertaste. Certainly not the best representative of this style I have had. Just boring and nothing special."
"Brooklyn doesn't disappoint me in this offering. This is a very drinkable beer. Perfect as a session beer. I think I'll pick up another six-pack or two before they are all out."
"Drinkability: Reasonably drinkable, but I am not really a fan of the style"
"Very easy and tasty to drink...Brooklyn just knows how to brew a nice beer."
"Taste is mild and simple- spicy, zesty- simple. Mouthfeel is slightly chewy, sudsy, and easy to drink, once again. Drinkability is good- overall, it's an easy thing to drink. Not amazing, not earth-shattering, but easy to drink."
"A well made thing for all to see."
"Medium body. Smooth mouthfeel, with a sweet and nutty lingering aftertaste.I found this to be extremely drinkable, as several were enjoyed in one afternoon session. Nice beer."
"Drinkability: Very smooth and drinkable, subtle character. I savored a glass over the course of an hour and found it to be consistently enjoyable as it warmed. Tasty with sharp cheddar cheese. The Brooklyn Brewery has not disappointed me yet."
"I can see this easily being drunk by all at an Oktoberfest. Nothing out of the ordinary, just a solid example of the style. Good job!"
"overall, tasty. a 6 pack would be a welcome addition to any fridge. only complaint is that it thinks very much in terms of 'inside the boxx' but succeeds.. so how much can one really bitch?"
"a nice brown amber with a very quickly dissapating tan head. pale malt nose with caramel and light toffee aromas, giving way to some slightly fruity and floral aromas. malty, with caramel and light toffee coming through in the taste as well. a mild grainyness coupled with faint brown sugary flavors show up a little later on. i think the brown sugar may have accounted for the floral aromas i was picking up. it has a little bit of a grassy herbal hoppiness. medium bodied with a slightly chewy mouthfeel and mild carbonation. good drinkablity, easily drinkable, and a very respectable oktoberfest."
"So, another good one from BBC. Gee, that's Brooklyn Brewing rather than Bluegrass Brewing which has good micros too. So, yes, I'd buy this again without question. 2 for 2! (Although, I'd lean towards the Double Chocolate since those are simply awesome.)"
"This is an easily consumable beer, flavorful and pleasant. Nice example of the style."
"A great fall/Oktoberfest beer. Easy drinking with tons of flavor."
"i had one of these a few weeks ago and thought it sucked, but maybe i was just being biased. slightly above average oktoberfest"
"Pours amber orange with a respectable head, reducing to a collar, and nice lacing. Smells of sweet malts and maybe the faintest hops. Taste is very very nice. Not overpowering by any means, but delightful and full. Bready and toasty with some caramel overtones. Hops are steady in restricting the malts but not at all pronounced. Theres touches of fruit(apple) lurking about. Mouthfeel is terrific, medium low mouthfeel but somehow with the carbonation creates an incredible creaminess. A great session beer. A great oktoberfest."
"Pours a nice brick red in color. Slightly thin looking--but expected for the style. Just a thin filmy head on top. Cannot pick up much in the nose--just slight hints of hops. Flavor is solid. Nice example of an O'fest. Nice crisp toasted malts. Slightly biscuity. Hops hardly register. Mouthfeel is not as dry as I would expect and maybe just a tad watery."
"Pours a bright reddish copper with a thin whispy off-white head, and no lacing. Aroma is a nice strong earthy malt, very breadlike, with a slight floral hoppiness. Taste is more of the same, with a delicious biscuity malt, a slight note of caramel, and a mild grassy hop finish that leaves just a hint of bitterness. A slight bit of fruitiness, maybe apples or pears, starts to come through as the beer warms. Medium/thin body with a nice crisp carbonation, this is a pretty easy drinker. As a hophead, Oktoberfest isn't my preferred style but is starting to grow on me. I've tried several this year, and Brooklyn's is definitely the best I've had."
"poured a medium copper-amber color. Moderate white head That fell to thick ring that slowed nice clinging to the sides of the glass. Smell is mainly of malt and not really very impressive. Taste reveals some toasted grain and a malty sweetness that improves with subsequent sips. Texture is creamy abd very pleasureable in the mouth. Some hoppy dryness also presents itself and balances the maltiness very well.Finishes mainly dry with some toasted malt also noted. This was a good beer but it just never seemed to be able to come forward and really assert itself. Very drinkable, but not something to make me want to go and grap another."
"This is an enjoyable brew but it does seem to lack the personality of most imports of the same style."
"Pours a semi dark auburn with a frothy 1 finger head, decent longevity and good lace. A great eatrhy malt aroma, caramel, perhaps a bit smokey. Again an earthy malt flavor. Perhaps a bit watery but that increases its drinkability. A nice hop flavor and slight bitterness come in at the end. A bit higher than average carbonation. Dry and easy drinking. All in all a decent Oktoberfest"
"Body just shy of medium with a slick, almost creamy mouthfeel. I typically don't like lagers, but this is pretty nice."
"Overall: Pretty nice for a domestic O-fest, one of the better ones I've tried this year."
"a great beer to sit out on the deck and watch the leaves fall."
"The head on this beer is great,and the clear dark coppery color is very exciting.The smell is very fragrant,but the bubbles are a little disapointing.This has a great head yet the carbonation disappears very fast leaving a beer thats a little flat.It does have a very good taste thats not too full of spices.I do like this brewery and believe i may have just gotten a beer a little flat,i'm willing to give this another chance and i think you should too."
"Rich ruby-orange and a sticky lace for a head. The aroma is malty and gives off hints of roasted malts. Medium body with a chewy maltiness in the body. Semi-sweet malts up front and roasted malts. Has a hint of caramel. The hop's bitterness are just enough to keep the malts from dominating the beer. A great drinkability. I can have one after the other with out even thinking. This is a very impressive Oktoberfest!"
"Purchased at Whole Foods $1.75 for one bottle, being German I had to try it, had heard good things as well. Poured a light brown clear color, two fingure white head. No strong smell, some malt. Smooth taste malt finish. A nice brew I could drink several. I like that it is brewed in March for Septmeber/October consumption, good description on bottle of history of Octoberfest."
"12 oz bottle pours a slightly hazed, copper body with a minimal offwhite head that quickly drops to a film. Very sparse patches of lace are all that remain. Aroma reveals a pleasant balance of Munich malts and noble hops, with toffee, caramel, and molasses notes mingling gently with floral and herbal hops. Mouthfeel is light medium, with moderate carbonation. Taste is well balanced, with caramel, a hint of chocolate, and an equal measure of hop bitterness. Fruity notes of green apple and pear emerge midway through. Nicely complex for the style, and much more drinkable and balanced than the Stoudt's Oktoberfest that I compared this one to. Very nice and well constructed, the appearance being the only attribute keeping this one from a higher score."
"Das Guten Trinken!!!!"
"The taste is full of october malty goodness. There is a sweet honey taste in there, also caramel. The mouthfeel is the typical but amazing brooklyn mouthfeel; creamy stickey good. Very very drinkable."
"I have to say, also, that this is one of the best Brooklyn brews I've ever had. I think maybe because it doesn't scream, ""I am a Brooklyn Brew," as their Brown, Weiss, and Pennant have sometimes done for me. Maybe that doesn't make a lot of sense, but this one certainly is worth a shot, and I'm a big fan of it."
"Pours a clear amber color with a nice off white head that retains ok. Aroma is bready and grain-like with a lightly sweet background, very clean. Flavor is complex, with a classic oktoberfest taste; begins with a toasted bread flavor followed by a light caramel sweetness and a grassy, floral hops flavor. Mouthfeel is smooth with a medium body and moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good. A solid offering from Brookyln, easily one of the best american renditions of oktoberfest."
"I haven't been a big fan of Oktoberfest beers. Thanks to Brooklyn Brewery for helping me to gain an appreciation of the style."
"The dry finish seperates it from many sweeter Oktoberfest beers I've tried. Definately worth picking up again."
"-Oelergud"
"Prosit!"
"Sampled this from being inmy fridge for a few months (like 5!). Poured a deep coppery amber with golden highlights. The head was short lasting and remained thin throughout. The aroma gives off good doses of caramel malt sweetness along with a nice bouquet of roasted nuts. The taste is drier than expected. A dryness that carries right through into the finish. Right beside that dryness is touches of caramel, molasses and even traces of licorice. Medium bodied and very smooth. Overall, a very nice beer and a tasty version of the German counterpart."
"Medium bodied, good straightforward smooth oktoberfest."
"Brooklyn Brewery Oktoberfest is a worthwhile take on the style. While I haven't been too impressed with their beer in the past, this one is tasty and drinkable. I'm drinking it a bit out of season, but it's a pleasant reminder of those long gone, crisp October afternoons. Good beer."
"Light, see through brown hue with a thin dissolving head; minimal lacing if any to be noted. Has a toasted malt and bready nose. Sharp, grainy and some oats noted in the body; some green apple notes in the beginning as well. Medium-bodied, thinly carbonated, body is sweet, warmness gives way to some spicy hop offerings. Smooth and satisfying mouthfeel; clean palate; a wonderful offering!"
"D&N: A nice Marzen (brewed in March, guess I know the roots of that name now) by a top notch brewer. Oh, and don't drink this one right out of the fridge, let it warm up a bit, as with all good beers, it really brings out the deeper flavors and aromas."
"(Wish I could summon up more enthusiasm to match some of the other reviews, but it's not in me for this one, sorry.)"
"Dark reddish brown color, ,little to no head. Very sweet, nutty, roasty toasty scent to this one, very inviting, very Oktober. Taste isn't quite as full as the smell seemed to suggest, but it's good. That sweet nutty taste is definately there, just not as bold as I would've hoped. Maybe a little watery. Definately a drinkable brew though and tasty, but I wish this beer would just be a little more flavorful, cause it smelled oh so good."
"Went down too fast. A terrific brew and one of the better octoberfest/marzen's out there."
"The aroma is faintly sweet and citrusy. The taste is quite hoppy for a Marzen, which was a nice surprise. The hop flavor was in the low to medium range, which gave it a nice bitter aftertaste. The first taste is pretty mild, however. Overall, a pretty decent beer. Haven't had a bad Brooklyn beer yet."
"One of two Brooklyn offerings I had this past week at Redbones. Pour was a slightly cloudy amber, topped with a white frothy head. I am noticing some spice in the aroma (more of the subdued nutmeg variety). Tastewise, this is all about the malt, except for some spice in the finish (again, nutmegy). Mouthfeel is medium - (almost thin). I'm not sure if it's spice I am getting, or something intriguing from the hops."
"This Oktoberfest offering from Brooklyn was my favorite of the season and I have tried all that I can get in Northeast, CT. The beer explodes with the foam cloud opening which always gets me going because I expect a great taste to follow and their was no dissapointment to be found, but a lot of thrills. The malts and hop combined for a creamy taste with some slight bitterness which made me think this is what a German Oktoberfest style beer should taste like. I didn't like this beer last year so my lovefest with it this year should be a hint to run out and try one before the season is over. Update 2007 offering not as good, need to review this again in the fall."
"Dark amber with a little frothy head that lingers a bit. Smells of malt and hops with a slight notice of spice. Looks and smells warm and inviting. The balance of malt and hops was a little off, the hops were a bit more present forcing the beer into the 'bitter' realm of Oktoberfest. However, the spices were still there enough to notice, which is good. This beer was good quality, very consistent and smooth. I'd like to try their other beers."
"Tasty Oktoberfest ! You could have told me this was an Oktoberfest from a German brewery and I would have no doubts. As usual, Garrett Oliver nails another great beer."
"Fun little beer, nothing to come back to though. For the same season, I prefer their Pumpkin Ale."
"Pours out a dark orange color with a small yet consistent head. Very nice aroma. The taste is great as well. Not too heavy, not too light. Feels great on the palate and is an extremely drinkable beer. This is one of the better Oktoberfest beers that I have ever had. Brooklyn Brewery continues to impress me."
"Very drinkable version of the style. IMO this is just a slightly above average Marzen with nothing in terms of flavor that really make it stand out."
"Drinkability: Again, I'm new to Oktoberfest brews, but I liked this a lot and definitely see myself having another sometime soon."
"Best fest of the season so far."
"Pours a very carbonated clear amber with a thin short lived head. Minimal lacing. Smells doughy and sweet malt with a faint perfume of hops. Not at all what I had expected given the glowing reviews of some posters. A good solid beer, though not one I will go out of my way to find again. Slightly toasted malt in the taste but also overpowering yeasty taste. Not in balance in my opinion. Dry short finish."
"This 12 oz. bottle was obtained courtesy of BeerAdvocate spiritdeus. The brown bottle released a beer with a reddish amber body, and a fizz of initial carbonation, but with no head to speak of. The aroma was very mild and can be at best described as floral and perfumey. The taste was sweet and bready malt driven and toasty, but the body was a bit too thin. There was a tangy lemony aftertaste that kept me coming back for more though. Smooth and drinkable, but could benefit from a touch less wateriness."
"A very average Oktoberfestbier. This is certainly drinkable, but it isn't somthing I'd really go out of my way to hunt down. Might be good with a pretzel and some spaetzle."
"drinkability: i could drink these till i get arrested for throwing a brick through a window"
"Extremely drinkable."
"Taste was also kind of bizzare (""smell is a big part of taste"" is proven here.) Tastes like a spiced ale with pine nuts, filtered through a grassy knoll. Has a snappy hoppiness but kind of a thin, watery mouthfeel. Has the body of a summer beer, just too weird for me really to give it a thumbs-up, will have to go back for a second one to confirm."
"Taste is malt and malt, Nice malt taste with a bit of caramel sugar and not much hop taste. Probably a more true Oktoberfest than what they serve at Oktoberfest. but then again cant have Matzens at the fest.. One of the best domestic fests.. Drank with Korean spiced Flanken Ribs and Chinese spiced chicken.. Wow What a combo.."
"Bender Factor: Brooklyn has not impressed me so far. This Oktoberfest has redeemed their brewery. Their merely average Pale Ale and subpar Brown stick out to me. I plan to pick up some more of this (only bought one out of hesitation) before the ""season"" ends. A highly drinkable ""session"" brew, goes good with Chemistry and Calculus."
"I grabbed a fresh 6 of this at the package store last night, and it pained me to wait for it to chill and try. The color is a nice deep copper, and poured a nice head in the glass. No real lace to speak of. The smell is the caramel maltiness I expect from this style. Just a hint of the hops. The taste is a nice punch of malt; not too sweet, with the hops balancing the caramel sweetness I detected in the aroma. It has a great medium feel on the tongue, and a wonderful drinkability. Many American breweries struggle with German styles, but Oktoberfests do not seem to present the same challenge. This is a good representation of this beer style that I highly recommend."
"Pours a clear amber color with nice off white head that falls to a ring of foam. Aroma is malt light toasted grains bready and chewy smelling. Taste big on malt smooth and creamy malt, carmel flavors mixed with light spice and light hops. Taste is sweet rich and creamy a very enjoyable. This is a very drinkable medium bodied brew guess fall has arrived early after all and boy is this a good start."
"Orange-amber color with a tight creamy head that leaves some lace. Crisp toasted grain aroma with floral hops. Toasted flavor upfront with some sweetness, bread, and a touch of fruit and spice. Hops come in to balance and leave some bitterness. Medium in body, smooth and creamy. Excellent drinkability. A top notch Oktoberfest in my book."
"The beer pours an amber color with a nice white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. There are strong hints of specialty malts here. The taste is much the same. It is a bit sweet, but not that bad. It is medium bodied and a good drinker. This beer is smooth and enjoyable. Some may consider it to be a little too bold and heavy on the crystal malts, but that's why I like the Brooklyn ales. They are true professionals that don't let the masses determine what good beer should taste like."
"Typical orange amber Märzen beer color. Some spice, malt, and carmel in the nose. A slightly bitter taste dominated my sweet malt. Very smooth and balanced for the style, but boring. A good Oktoberfest, but not a great one. I'll take the Smuttynose or Paulaner over this anytime."
"This is one of the better Marzen style lagers I have sampled this season. Seemed to be a bit lighter and more drinkable than others that I have tried. Overall an excellent sample."
"This beer has a good copper color. Just as one would expect form an Octoberfest beer. Aroma in not as malty as I would like in this style. The flavor starts slightly malty but finishes with an unexpected bitterness. A good drinking beer but would I like more a malty (sweetness) flavor."
"I would rate this above average."
"I liked the bottle, came close to just saying ""beer"". Poured a nice orange like color. The taste had that muted hops with the right blend of malts. Definite ""October"" beer. I could sense leaves blowing in the wind as I drank it. Good beer."
"Deep amber color with a very stable head. The smell is overwhelmed with roasted malt (not that its a bad thing). Very sweet roasted flavor. Not much of a hop presence. A nice October, very drinkable but could use a little less sweetness and a couple more hops."
"Deep amber color, topped by a tan, long lasting head. Aroma of toasted malt. Flavor is very heavy on the taosted malts, some sweetness but much more roastiness. Ever so slight bitterness on the smooth finish. Lingering roasted aftertaste. Mouthfeel is very robust, but smooth. Drikability pretty good. Not a bad offering, but a little more sweetness and a bit more hops would be nice."
"Clear orange color. No head , no laceing. Has a malty, in a grainy way, with lite fruitiness smell. Malty taste, a regular kind of carmel toasted malt I associate with style. A little creamy& bitterness that faded quickly. Weak overall as far as I see it."
"Pours an orange-copper hue with a thin head. Lightly malty aroma, with a hint of sweetness. This beer is a bit thin on the palate, but makes up for it with a delightfully sweet malty character. Slightly spicy aftertaste. A very good approximation of a German marzen. I'd recommend it as a session beer, great for a breezy fall afternoon outdoors."
"A great american marzen beer, one of the better, more german tasting offerings. Brooklyn definitely makes a great product, and their lagers are amongst the best brewed in the US."
"Note to self...Must get more beer from Brooklyn brewery"
"Cheers to Garrett for another quality Brooklyn beer! Though not my favorite Oktoberfest of the season, this is certainly a well above-average one, and certainly one I'd have more of in the future."
"Pours a nice, reddish-orange color with a small, creamy lace. Clean, malty aroma. Very sharp, somewhat astringent mouthfeel. Slightly malty, but very dry. Hoppy. This beer is really lacking in taste. There's really not much to say about it. That's what makes it so disappointing. I was expecting something fairly malty and flavorful, and this just doesn't cut the mustard. I probably won't pick this up again."
"It pours a clear, copper-amber color into my 16 oz Brooklyn Brewery Oktoberfest mug. Produces a good-sized, foamy tan head, which disappears quickly. Fair lacing. Smell of toasted malts, a bready aroma & slightly sweet, but balanced perfectly with a slight hop bitterness. This medium-bodied beer is extremely drinkable and calls for another one. Bring on the oompah band. Cheers to Garrett Oliver for another fine creation."
"Pours a copperish color and has a two inch head that dissipates to ring but doesnt leave a lace. Smells of biscuity malt, almost of how nilla wafers smell, with no hop aroma. Tastes of sweet caramel malts with slight minty hop bite coming out in the finish. Nice medium mouthful tastes somewhat like how zwieback in a liquid form would be. Good to the last drop and could be drank all day. All around a very good beer."
"A little more acidic and tangy than the average O-fest, but not so much that the malt did not shine through, and the overall effect was to liven the beer up quite a bit. Hopping was reserved - the malt is the star of the show, and it was quite crisp. Mouthfeel was a little on the light and thin side, the only real detraction from this well-made beer."
"The brewers at Brooklyn are masters of their craft, and their Oktoberfest proves yet again that they can conquer any style. In the S.W.A.T. team that is microbrewing, Brooklyn is the sniper. This time, Oktoberfest is the prime target. Excellent appearance and the perfect sweet and malty taste I've come to expect from märzens. Mark my words, I will never have an Octoberly shopping list on which this beer doesn't appear."
"A sturdy and spunky version of a fest-marzen, as a great hop flavor strikes you, though it hurts the drinkability a little. A good session mouthfeel. Overall, a decent festbier, a bit too simple and not as savory as, say, Paulaner's version."
"Beer has a beautiful copper color with a thin beige head that dissipates rather quickly. Leaves minimal lacing. It has a subtle bready nose with some frutiness peeking through. Has a nice toasty malt taste with a surprisingly crisp hoppy finish... much more hops than I expected at the end. Taste seemed to improve as the beer warmed. Mouthfeel is very smooth with a medium body. Definitely a highly drinkable brew... probably one of the better Oktoberfests I have sampled this season. Another solid offering from the gang at Brooklyn."
"Reddish-brown pour with a small tan head that recedes to a small ring and lightly laces on the way down. Aroma is mainly bready, with slight hints of caramel and hops. Flavor is bready, some savory caramel, and a bit of hops in the end. Medium body, medium-lively carbonation, super easy drinking."
"This oktoberfest beer poured an effervescent, amber-red color with very light tan, creamy foam that settled but clung to the glass a bit. The smell was malty with notes of bread and a hint of hops. The taste was malty, with some not-so-sweet caramel, oak, and hops. There was also a bit of a vinous flavor as the glass warmed. The mouthfeel was smooth but crisp and dry overall. The body was medium with good carbonation. The finish was malty and hoppy. This was a very good and nicely drinkable beer."
"Pours with a dark copper body and a very thin white head with little lace or froth. Very pleasant floral hops with plenty of maltiness balancing it out. The taste was excellent, with a nice toasted malt accompanied with a pleasant bitterness from the hops, leaving a nice mild bitter finish. Despite the hops, it's still a light beer with little dryness. The result is a delicious drinable oktoberfest beer, one of the best I've had in a while. I must seek out more of Brooklyn's brews..."
"My favorite O-fest of the year so far. Hooray for fall!"
"This pours with a quickly falling faintly tan head that settles over clear amber liquid with hints of gold in it. The nose is bready/malty with a whiff of metallic hoppiness coming on strong. The mouthfeel was a bit thin for an O-fest, but had nice flavors of semi-sweet and toasty maltiness on the palate upon swallowing. The finish showed a flash of yeasty fruitiness (hmm, is this a ""true"" lager yeast O-fest or an ale yeast hybrid??) and some hop bitterness when I should of been tasting sweet malt. Decent, but much better examples abound at this time of year!"
"wonderfully constructed appears copper amber with a lucious tan creamy head sitting atop, not bad at all lacing is full and even great looking brew from Garret's brewhouse. Aroma toasted malts with edges of caramel sweetness and a touch of german hops thrown in their are noticeable. Great flavor crisp not overly sweet but still a malty treat with the blend of vienna and other specialty malts wow a great beer toasted nut in the finish with enough bitterness to balance. Dead on to the style I am loving this one possibly my favorite beer out of Brooklyn, mouthfeel is medium in body nice creamy texture. I could definitely throwback a liter of this as if I were in Munchen, plan to pick up some more of this jewel."
"An excellent Oktoberfest -- my first for 2003 and a great start. Slick, sweet, and medium-bodied."
"Nice dark appearance with decent head...malty aroma with a decent taste that stops about halfway on the upper palate. Not as rounded as I would have liked. Mouthfeel was initially nice, but stopped about halfway back, with a minimal aftertaste. Drinkability was average...I was hoping for more as I usually am a big fan of Brooklyn offerings."
"Light beige foamy head topped with big bubbles sits atop a honey/copper colored beer. The head is thick, and lingers long. Aroma is of sweet malt, with hints of fruit. Flavor is also fruity with light hop, and a bits of honey, pine and orange peel. Creamy mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Fine lacing all the way down the glass. Excellent selection."
"medium, white head. A small head remains. Very good lacing. The beer is a light brown/copper color. Smells like rum punch: butter, spices, citrus, and alcohol. Also smells a bit like a Dr. Pepper. Every whiff smells different. Tastes/feels buttery as well. The spices are there, too. This is a good brew. Very complex. Great aftertaste -- keeps you thinking."
"I'd say this bottle has held-up well, I would like to try it in season though, I would wager it is much better. Stegmakk send me this one so thanks for the beer."
"This rivals The Black Chocolate Stout as my favorite Brooklyn Beer. It pours with a reddish copper color and thin white head and lots of carbonation. There is a sweet caramel taste and it finishes with very slight hoppiness. An excellent interpretation of the Oktoberfest style."
"Pours an orange/auburn color with a fluffy off-white head. Froth fades down to about 1/4-inch and then remains throughout, leaving a thin sticky lace on the glass. Nose is of roasted malt and subtle hops, kind of reminds me of whole grain bread. Taste is slightly sweet and bitter with some bits of nuttiness mixed in. This is a decent medium-bodied beer, which leave a slightly creamy texture on the tongue. Very enjoyable."
"Liht slightly malty and bitter blend of an Oktoberfest. It has been better in other years and does change slightly as the beer warms. It is flavorful with the caramel taste of an Oktoberfest and is worth a try, much better on tap if you can get it. Another quality beer from Brooklyn."
"F."
"First Brooklyn brew that I tried,I liked the nice copper/caramel to it,very nice retaining head.Nice malty aroma,with caramel accents,very appetizing.Very fresh tasting malty brew with some hop quality in there as well.I have enjoyed all the Brooklyn beers I have tried.This one is better than alot of German styles."
"Drinkability OK..overall decent...I'll drink what I have and if I get more I will drink them...but I wont look for it"
"Pours a nice burnt orange with noticeable carbonation. Tops off with a nice thick and tight off white head. The head does fade quickly and leaves very little lace. The aroma is sweet, toasted malt and caramel come to mind, but there are hops present. The taste is right along with the aroma. A pleasant taste of malt starts across your tongue and ends with a slightly sweet caramel finish. The finish turns dry and sheds the flavor of the hops that were hidden in the aroma. A very nice beer from the Brooklyn Brewery."
"This well made octoberfest has a thin clean tan head, nice malt flavor. The head doesn't stick around to long. Strong body good color nice aroma. The sweet caramel and toasted malt flavor with slight hops and grain feel. nice for this style good body nice flavor this is what I am going to look for next October."
"Thanks to Davo for the sample."
"One of my favorite Octoberfests for the year along with Victory."
"Lately I have gone from an ale drinker to a lager hound. This beer is one of the reasons."
"Bright copper body topped by a creamy just-off-white head, which disipates into a lumpy oil-spill of a top, which lasts and lasts.  Little lacing. Aroma is fresh biscuits.  Taste is caramel malt, spicy hops, and chocolate-like notes. Let it warm a bit to bring out the malt flavors. Not too sweet, very well balanced. Better than I remembered it from last year (when it had a product placement on ""Ed""). The best US O'Fest I've had so far this year."
"If there was a beer parade, this one could be in the running for Grand Marshal. My favorite Oktoberfest this year."
"Pours a beautiful, clear, copper/amber color with a great creamy tan head that last as it rings the glass all the way down.  Sweet and toasty malt dominates the aroma and makes the mouth water.  The taste starts off with a smooth toasty malt that turns a bit sweeter as the brew finishes rather creamy.  There are just enough earthy hops thrown in to keep the malt in balance.  This is one excellently smooth medium bodied brew that makes for maximum drinkability.  Definitely my favorite Oktoberfest of the year, this would make for some great drinking while eating brats and big-ass pretzels.  I can only imagine how excellent it would be on draught."
"More breweries should take their Oktoberfest as seriously as Brooklyn.  Brewed in the spring, lagered all summer, released in the fall.  And it shows.  Nice grainy, toasted maltiness in the aroma and taste.  Crisp and clean, yet with a long creamy finish.  A nice beer."
"Wow now this is a really good Ofest!  Pours a reddish-orange color with a decent creamy lace.  On the nose the aroma of toasted malts, cookie dough, and caramel. On the palate theres a good sweetness, toasted malts, cookie dough, caramel, grainy, perfect amount of hop bitterness in there to balance this brew out.  This is a great Oktober fest brew"
"I tried this on tap at the Brewgrass Festival in Asheville, NC. There were several Octoberfests at the festival so I got to try this in context with several other takes on the style and it wasn't one of the better ones. The hops in this beer overpowered what's suppsoed to be a fairly malty style. Big dissapointment."
"Out of all the Ok-ees I've ventured into this year, this would be the first one I'd consider seeking out next year."
"Very mediocre on tap. Not malty enough, thin and rough on the palate. Could have been the lines at Sunset ..."
"2002 Octoberfest beer...and fresh it is. Lovely caramel color, creamy layer of steady foam. Smells like a fresh loaf of multi-grain bread with a mere suggestion of sweetness. The taste delivers these elements as well as some satisfying toasted grain and caramel flavors. Some nutty hints are also detected. Hops are assertive enough to poke through, but subdued enough to allow the malt to do it's thing. One of the best O' fests I've tasted."
"314"
"Notes: Hmmm ... tastes like an import? Care and dedication for this brew to be created ... several months of aging make for a well palated brew. See it, buy it and enjoy this excellent version of the style."
"This was my favorite Oktoberfest in the Northeast this year. The head leaves room for improvement, but the full mouthfeel and exceptionally fresh flavors of toffee and lightly toasted malt is unmatched. Hops are mildly leafy and give a nice bitterness throughout, as well as cleaning up the finish with a tiny zing. Delicious beer, especially on tap."
"This 2001 beer is great.  Malty, yet enough hop balance"
