"I bought this a few weeks into November when the store was trying to move Oktoberfest inventory to make way for winter brews. I was not a fan, wouldn't recommend it. There are better oktoberfests out there."
"Overall:  This is a decent American version of an Oktoberfest-style beer.  Very tasty and very refreshing.  Solid beer."

"It's really sweet without balance."

"10/19...pours reddish amber autumn with a fast acting white foam that settles out. Nose of molasses, malt, caramel, sugars. Malt forward taste with a spiced middle. Slightly out of step bitter. Very euro. Good, not great."
"Found this beer to be very good and full of flavor."

"Overall – This is a rather enjoyable and easy drinking October fest with a rather sweet malty taste and a little bit of fruit and roast."
"3.3/5: Hits all the right notes, and some that go beyond the call of duty, even...I still wish it was a lager, though"

"Looks aside this is a mediocre festbier. More sweet than toasty and more sugary than nutty. Some grassy hops at the end help cut the sweetness. Had an o-fest itch, this diminished it but did not quite satisfy it."

"Overall, a solid, good tasting oktoberfestbier. Very good malt flavors and not too sweet, good hosp and nice mouthfeel. Would like to have a steinfull."

"Got a 1/6 barrel of this. Maybe because I just finished a Yards PPA, but this batch was awful! Smell and taste were d-. Think pumpkin. I like Flying fish, local, lots of options, but this was not the cats meow, it came from the other end. Brooklyn, Long Trail and Yards are my go to after this. Now I have a week of this. If it improves, and I grow to like it, I will revise review. The man cave needs top notch brew, and this does not not make the grade. PS- I have had more than 30 brews pass thru my tap. Update: after almost a week of this fish, I have gotten a little more used to the taste. Still would give a D grade. Ordered a 1/2 Yards PPA at $165 9.26.13. Pricy but worth it."

"Poured into a mug, pale color for a marzen, no head to speak of. Smell was pleasently surprising given the color with spice and cinnamon notes. The taste was unusual, dank, earthy and not typical marzen. Mouthfeel is this beers best feature, rich, soft and pleasing. This is not representative of the style but a nice drinkable brew nonetheless. For transparency, I had a Paulaner Oktoberfest right before this which is tough competition in this category."
""
"I thought this was going to be a subpar brew, but this one came out nicely. It mentions ale instead of lager so I wasn't sure how this was going to come out, but I really like this light bodied hot cinnamon and spicy kick it has. Great take on a style and mixing it up."

"Poured in sam adams glass, developed a nice tan head which laced well for a moment, then all disipated (almost made me think my glass was dirty). Was a clear copper / honey color and had a nice malty bread aroma with a hint of caramel. Tasted of malt and caramel with hints of grain and grass. Nice mild body with a medium mouthfeel. Good stuff."

"This is one of the easiest styles for me to drink, and this one is no exception. Good beer."
""
"Overall pretty standard beer. Worth a try."
""
" O- An excellent NJ made representation of the style. Spot on."
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is a bit malty. Taste is light, carbonated, some malts, a bit mild for the style, just a touch of hops at the finish. Feels light in the mouth and overall, while nothing offensive, there are far better oktoberfest beers out there."
""
""
""
"D: regardless of what is listed on the label, this is a pretty solid oktoberfest. worth picking up if given the chance."
"6%ABV. per bottle label."

"I really like this one just as much as Samuel Adams Octoberfest. It has that same delicious Octoberfest taste. It has a great creamy texture to it and is a full bodied octoberfest. Also some candy sweet toffee evolves from the malts. Pretty complex malts on this one. Right up there with the best in my opinion and should be mentioned a lot more often around this time of year. Underrated beer."
""
"Poured into a pint glass from the bottle, Oktoberfish shows light amber color with no head retention or lacing. Some toasted malt aromas off-set by hints of yeast. A light mouth feel and lively carbonation precede toasty malt flavors and a medium length finish. This is a little lighter on its feet and not as heavy as some other U.S. craft Oktoberfest beers."
""

""
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours light amber with a short lived white, foamy head. Aroma is of caramel malt, hops and hints of fruit. Body is medium and slightly crisp. Sweet caramel malt, grain, herbal hops fill the mouth. Sweet finish becomes dry in the end. Nice brew I’ll buy again."

"This brew poured out as a light brown color with a fizzy light tan colored head on top. The smell of the beer had a sweet malt aroma to it with a light autumn spice on the nose. The taste of the beer was decent for a Marzen, it's still too watered down. The mouthfeel was light, could have been a little heavier and more warming. Overall it's an average brew I think. Nothing I'd need to have again."

"I'm going to have to try this one again just to be fair. Could be dirty lines or the end of the keg."
"O- overall not bad at all. The spiciness gives it a slightly different dimension than many marzens. Solid, but fails to separate itself from the pack."
"One of the better oktoberfests I have had this year. Great balance, good use of hops, and nice clean finish."
"I suggest trying the Brooklyn Oktoberfest over this one."
"Overall: I was not really impressed by this beer. I'd classify this as an Oktoberfest light."
"O: Solid Oktoberfest. Not the greatest looking, but a pleasure to drink. I liked this better than the Dominion."
"Pours a hazy apple juice color with a 1/2 inch foamy light tan head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Random streaks and dots of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of bready malt, caramel, and some light citrus aromas. Taste is much the same with a nice bready malt flavor with some caramel, grass, and citrus as well. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good Oktoberfest beer that I picked up on a whim. Nothing too great but definitely drinkable."
"Overall a very flavorful brew and a nice interpretation of the style."
"Overall – not a bad brew at all, and fairly interesting in taste."
"O: A really good festbier, and it's nice to see another East Coast version of this style in CA, they seem to do it well. It has a freshness that's hard to find with a version from across the pond."
"D: Awesome drinkability, it's not light, but its refreshing and quite quenching. The lower alcohol is on the upper-end of the session-able range which I like."
"Lighter but coating. Just enough carbonation to be above lacking. Drinks fine, but a little sweet."
"Pours light copper with very little head. Faint malt smell, but frankly, there is not much of a smell to this beer at all. Some toasty malt taste here, but not enough malt to be true to style. Mild but pleasant bite in the finish that really gives this beer a bit of character. Nice, but nothing special here."
"O: The beer isn’t overly difficult to drink, but it lacks the thicker body and stronger flavors associated with the style."
"O: Im not a fan of Oktoberfests. But this beer seems subpar. Tastes like nothing smells like nothing. Its just a nothing beer. Id drink it to get drunk and thats all."
"Overall: Nice beer but just not an oustanding version of an Octoberfest."
"Overall a decent beer, hoppy taste but easy enough to go with lunch. I wouldnt drink this beer in mass amounts but decent enough to try one or two and dall it a day."
"overall- I was pleased to see that the local pub had it on tap. Overall though it did not lead up to my expectations. It just felt something was missing in the ingrediants. I am pleased to have least tried it."
"O: Nice well-balanced smooooth brew. This is something I could drink all day."
"Poured a hazy brown with a white head that recedes to a film. Malts on the nose and some caramel sugars. Hearty bread in the taste, some nuts, with sweet malts and chewy caramel; pleasantly hopped in the background. Medium body, nice and drinkable."
"Pours a hazy amber with almost no head at all. Light, earthy, caramel malt aroma. Flavor is slightly sweet malts but nothing remarkable about the taste Very, VERY faint hops linger in the finish. Medium body, slick texture. Average beer. Nothing special here."
"overall not really that great of an example of the style. not a bad beer, but just average in my opinion."
"From fall brew tasting notes (2010): Sweet malty aroma with caramel and a little cellar funk, earth and toffee with lemoncit and yeast. Lovely copper-amber pour with a creamy eggshell head. Taste is heavy caramel and lemon, earth and dark toffee, predominately dry with a touch of corn and brown sugar. Faint bitter chocolate. Bready aftertaste, light-bodied. Not really a pitch-perfect Alt, and I'm having problems classing this as an Oktoberfest/Maerzen."
"On draft. My memories of this are a little hazy. Chestnut brown, somewhat spicy aroma and flavor. Toasty, bready malt, some chocolate, kind of sweet, very mellow. Biscuit, I suppose? Nice mild hop bitterness. I was pleasantly surprised here."
"I can imagine that, with more time given to the beer's conditioning, the flavors and nuances of what each malt has to offer would be allowed to come to the fore, improving what is more or less a wort bomb."
"D - Pretty good, average oktoberfest beer from Flying Fish. Not bad overall but wouldn't go out of the way to get it."
"Overall, it's much more enjoyable than many Octoberfests. It's a bit watery, but this style usually produces beers that are watery and this isn't as watery. The lager quality is tempered by the fruit and the heavy malt, making it stand out a bit as more complex beer."
"Nice-looking beer--light mid-brownish. Sweet smell to it, but not sickly sweet, only really a hint of sweetness. Tasted hopw it smelled--nice and robust with a hint of sweetness. Was a bit watery, but overall a very nice beer. This is something I'd buy and be comfortable drinking for an entire Oktoberfest."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer that is worth drinking of a long time if you're the mood for an Oktoberfest beer."
"Nothing redeeming about this beer at all. still, purchased in a very reputable shop and lack of date makes me wonder if it is old or not. Not recommended, this was going to be a drain pour as soon as I saw it in the glass."
"I prefer this one out of a keg then a bottle."
"I got this with a microbrew pack in the Manahawkin, New Jersey Spirits Unlimited. This beer pours a brown colour with half-finger white head with some lacing. The smell is fruity with a hint of caramel/toffee, a subtle citrus/apple taste with a hoppy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, and its a very drinkable smooth beer, especially with fall seasonal food."
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer in that it goes down easily, is quite satisfying to drink and I'm always ready for another sip. I could easily drink a few of these back to back in an evening. I'm also pleasantly surprised at how well this beer goes with the various cheeses on this mixed cheese plate which I started nibbling on about halfway through the beer."
"Pours a copper color, thin off-white head, minimal retention and lacing. Smell is of sweet carmel malts, butter and a lager like twang. Taste follows smell with a very sweet carmely and buttery mnalt structure, finished with a dank. lager-like bite. Body is on the thinner side of medium, slightly over carbonated. Average Octoberfest... just a sweetened lager essentially."
"Pours rich copper with a torrent of carbonation, which created a decent bubbly head and nice lacing. The smell is clean, crisp and malty, with a little toffee edge. the flavor is toffee-like, a little sugary with a pleasant malty burn on the finish. The mouthfeel is surprisingly rich with a big bite of carbonation."
"this brew is a very good oktoberfest brew ,extremely palatable. if i'm not drinking an original german brew i'll be drinking oktoberfish instead. cheers."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a shaker pint. It pours a deep, clear copper with a moderate white head. The aroma is full of sweet malt, and a bit bready. The taste follows, the finish is slightly sweet and lingers for a bit. The beer is medium bodied, and lightly carbonated. A solid fest beer that is very sessionable."
"This is a highly drinkable marzen for sure. The flavors blend well together and hide the booze very well. I could session these all night."
"CHEERS!!"
"Poured rich brown into an American pint glass, with a thin head, and little visible carbonation. The aroma was a little overpoweringly sweet and malty, with a hint of caramel apple and honey; no evidence of hop bitterness. The flavor was a slightly more subtle version of the nose, but since I have grown to appreciate fuller-bodied maerzens, I found the mouth to be a little on the thin side. Granted the latter makes for a nice session beer, but I'll pick something else to pair with my wurst plate."
"PS- I love the Bavarian flag background on the label!"
"Doesn't taste quite as good as it smells. Full malt profile, like ten different kinds of bread at once. Light hints of milk chocolate, butterless biscuits, that damn, delicious east coast mystery flavor, and then some lightly spicy hops finishing it off. Nice and complex with a lingering bitterness."
"the only things I really picked out of this were a sort of fruity, apple-like flavor and aftertaste. Reminiscient of a hard cider or such. Not much of this is present in the smell though. Moth is clean and crisp with noticeable carbonation. It's easy to drink and is refreshing, but didn't offer much to take note on that was too special about it. Appearance was just normal I guess is all there is to say about it. It's not bad, but I wouldn't go outof my way to have it again. Look for the apples, though."
"D: Overall a decent example and perhaps one of their better beers making for a good session marzen."
"When poured into a Flying Fish pint glass, this Oktoberfest was a clear and pale golden amber. On top of this amber brew was a 1/2 an ich head of white foam. This head of foam had decent retention that left behind a small white film and one single blot of white lace. The aroma was plain and simple with toasted malts with a splash of juicy fruits backing it up. The taste was lightly crispy with toasted malts, a tiny touch of juicy fruits, and a subtle hint of crispy floral hops at the finish line. The mouthfeel was light bodied with a crispy aftertaste of toasted malts and a hint of floral hops. In the end, it was stanadrd drinkable session German style Oktoberfest beer. You can easily drink 2 of these in a sitting."
"A nice effort. Not very complex, but overall a nice Octoberfest/Marzen."
"Pours a nice caramel-brown tone with slowly rising bubbles in a rather clear body; head is creamy white with a thick tracing that does not slide in time--a good start... somewhat sprucy (!)--or skunked (!!)--and caramel-sweet to the nose... the bouquet is big for an octoberfest, and more perfume than malttoo--intriguing... medium-bodied, with a bit of effervescence in the tongue and tocuhes at the throat--a rather swift rush overall... strangely stiff on the malt, almost making me doubt its freshness (the second bottle was a carbon copy)... pulls at the mouth and has a malty, woody pulp in its finish--the strength of its taste is to be commended, but its maltiness is a bit overstated, almost like it wandered through the winter into bock season.... I'm hoping the beer's skunked, and if it is, I will rewrite the review--if not, this is not an enjoyable brew for its style, with its caramelized sugary bluntness dragging down the more mellow characteristics of the beer... and Flying Fish is usually on point..."
"D: I would recommend giving it a try. Not the best American version of the Octoberfest that I have tried."
"I think the Sam's is more intense, but this was a few bucks less and I still think it's a damn fine Octoberfest."
"d. This is a very good session beer, glad to try the six pack. One of the better fall seasonals I've come accross this year."
"A copper-colored brew with a modest head that faded quickly. Carmel malt is the main feature in the aroma. The palate is light to medium bodied. Again caramel malt in the flavor with some graininess. A quiescent finish with very little indication of hops. Drinkable, for sure, but that is due to its fairly run-of-the-mill flavor profile."
"Certainly not the best depiction of the style..."
"One and done"
"Poured a light clear amber orange hue in to the pint glass. Off white two finger head that dissipated quite quickly. Thin layer of head left on the top. Decent carbonation. No real lacing in the glass. Smell is of a rather off malt flavor. No real caramel tones. Light scent for a Marzen style brew in my opinion. Dough like scent with some floral hints. Had some subtle hop notes mixed in with the malt scent. Some roasted malt flavors mixed deep in the nose. Taste was smooth and crisp very easy to drink. Nice malted profile with a decent caramel tone. Mild hop taste in the finish. Just a hint though not very distinct. The malt certainly takes the majority of the flavor. Rather light bodied. Decent beer but not my idea of a true to style Marzen Oktoberfest. Great drinkability and a good flavor lend to the quality of this crafted brew. I would certainly drink it again any time I can find it again. I picked up a case in NJ while on a work trip. The FFBC makes some great products and although this was not my favorite Oktoberfest but it is certainly a great fall time offering."
"Average isn't all that bad if you are looking to have more than one. I prefer some of Fly Fish other brews over this one. Had it at a beer swap and the crowd thought it was just OK too."
"Sample at the Mill Hill Saloon in Trenton, NJ: The beer is brownish-amber with a medium thin beige head that has good retention. Thin rings of lacing. Bready malt, grain and floral hops aroma. Medium body with a mellow fruit and malt character, and grassy hops in the background. The finish is sweet at first with a light hops and spicy alcohol aftertaste. Above average overall."
"I like FF other offerings a bit more but this is something that I wouldnt put into this style of beer. Didnt love it or hate it."
"I now notice that the bottle claims this is a German-style ale. I don't know if this is true or if it's there because of any law, but if it is an ale, they do a fantastic job disguising it."
"I'd call it a nice interpretation of the O'fest style. This one has a more pronounced cream character to it. It may mask some of the malt, but the smooth caramel still comes through, along with a bit of German lager tang. Overall, it looks good, it's smooth, drinkable and tasty."
"The drinkability for an O-Fest is there but the citrus and fruit notes in the middle of the taste really threw me for a loop. Not a great representation of the style but you could definitley do worse."
"Cheers!"
"Yet another good beer produced in my home state of NJ by the Flying Fish Brewing Co."
"Overall-An ok beer, brewed to style, the aftertaste threw me a little but it was still a good Octoberfest. Another solid brew made to-style by Flying Fish but it isn't exceptional."
"I had this brew during a return visit to the USA. It pours a very clear copper color, with a very slight head. The aroma is notably malty, with a toast and caramel quality. There's just a touch of hops in the aroma, but it's mostly about the malt. The taste is just slightly sweet, with the toasted character continuing throughout. There's a touch of bitterness in the finish. Moderately sweet, and with a fairly full mouthfeel. This is a nice, although not exceptional, oktoberfest. Not bad."
"This Oktoberfest poured reddish copper with a thin head. It smells clean, malty with a fain caramel. It tastes clean with a malt complexity, that is most likely from Munich and/or Vienna malts. It is lightly hopped. This beer has a light clean body. It is enjoyable and drinkable, but I have a feeling it won't stand up to all the fresh Oktoberfest beer that is waiting for us in Munich, Germany!"
"Overall, an enjoyable and drinkable O-fest. Not quite at the top tier of the style, but worthy of a try if it's available to you."
"D: Definitely a drinkable beer. Light and refreshing are great characteristics to have for a beer, Along with the sweet, malty taste and only a very slight hop bitterness, this beer is definitely a good brew."
"This wasn't a bad beer, but it didn't seem to do very well adhering to the style. It poured an amber bronze colour, as it should have, with a great looking head that hung around for a while, but that's where it ended. Smell was mostly malt, but the hops present are certainly either centennial or cascade. Grapefruit / pine resin in an O'fest? No thanks. Taste was even worse. Not that it tasted *bad*, it was just simply not an Oktoberfest and *definately* not what I was expecting; Malt dominating at first, followed by a pronounced ""West-Coast"" style hoppiness. A total disaster of an Oktoberfest, but a decent hoppy amber ale of sorts, I suppose."
"Drinkability: On style, with a nice malt profile (not overbearing as some can be) and delicate hopping"
"Not much in the way of flavor either. No complexity and completely onesided. Malt is hardly prevelant and the floral hop is hidde in the background. Things seem discombobulated."
"This is nothing outstanding, but it has pretty good characteristics - Just wish it had a little more body to it. As I mentioned above, it is an ale - An amber ale with some caramel added. Still in all, it's certainly worth trying. It's smooth and has a nice taste to it."
"Nice amber color, pours with a small head that dissipates rapidly. Shows virtually no carbonation, but there is some there. Taste is fairly well balanced with a finish that grows on you. Fairly middle of the road for this style, nothing to write home about."
"A nice golden beer with an orange hue poured out into my pint glass, with a thin white head. The nose definitly smelled like an Oktoberfest, some spicy hops with vienna malt. I get the same in the body, which also had a slight grapefruit taste rounding out the edge. Overall, it was very well balanced, a crisp mouthfeel, and a good drinking Oktoberfest."
"Overall- A delicious beer. I noted it tasted heavily of caramel and malt. I drank this beer in under 10 gulps!"
"Oktoberfish from Flying Fish Brewing Company right here in good old New Jersey pours a light coppery color with a thin head and a cider-like aroma. A bit sweet with a bitter, woody finish, this one is a little over carbonated I suggest letting it rest in the glass several minutes before drinking. The carbonation will go down to a more drinkable level, and the flavor will become fuller and sweeter as it warms a little. Of a recent sampling I did of several ""Fest"" beers from both the US and Germany over the past few weeks, this one was relatively average."
"Mouthfeel is slightly crisp at the start. The finish is somewhat dry. Thinner in body than other oktoberfests. Nicely drinkable, but there are better oktoberfests on the market."
"This isn't a beer to be chugged down, but it stands out from the other Octoberfests I've had. Warms ya up inside, has nice tarty notes to it, and is wonderful to swish around and build the head up sip by sip. Worth the money and slowing down to appreciate all of it's notes."
"poured a slightly hazy, medium copper with modest off-white head. Smell is nice and malty, with some toasty and caramely notes presemnt. Taste is a very sweetish malt. Initially there was a mega hops presence, but this seemed to diminish with subsequent sips. Finish is somewhat dry ( a little too dry for my taste). This is an OK beer, nothing fantastic. A nice easy drinker."
"This is a nice easy drinking beer, it is not chock-full of flavor, yet it is quite satisfying; definitely a beer to be quaffed in great quantities. It does not have nearly the hop character that I like to see in an Alt, but it does have that nice fruity finish that I find typical of the style."
"I dropped the drinkability off a bit here, because I found this one to be rather sweet to which I enjoyed. However, I know not all people enjoy sweet brews, so I decided that I doubt I could drink a growler of it, so hence, a lower score here. However, I liked it for the most part."
"This is a good, dutiful rendition of the style, in my eyes at least, and is a joy to drink. While nothing here will leap out and grab you, it will pat you gently and allow you to enjoy one after the other, though responsibly of course. For being brewed in my backyard, I think it's one of the more faithful Oktoberfest beers whose label isn't printed at least partially in German. Smooth and easy to like, it makes more than one a pleasant task to undertake."
"It pours a medium brown-amber with a medium-sized, foamy, off-white head that doesnt stick around too long. Malts are dominant in the nose, of course, with aromas of caramel, butterscotch, nuts and hints of fruit. It has a very nice malty flavor with a light lemony bitterness to back it up. Pear and white wine notes in there as well. The finish is dry with a lingering light sweetness late. It has a medium body and moderate carbonation. I really enjoyed this one, one of the more impressive Oktoberfest seasonals Ive had this year. Enough character and body to keep me interested, but still highly sessionable. Id buy it again if I could get it in this area."
"Poured clear copper with a very generous white head. A very nice pouring beer if I may say so. The head was relatively long lasting and left a nice bit of lacing on the glass as it withdrew. Aroma was malty and sweet though not heavily so, a touch of smoke. Taste was balanced over all - starting with sweet caramel malts and fading into a short dry finish. Pleasant brew that paired nicely with sausage, spaetzel, cabbage and crusty bread."
"Overall: Fairly nice local example of a domestic O-fest, one of the better ones I've tried this year."
"Overall, I enjoyed this one quite a bit. I found it to be a nice sessional brew and a nice take on the style. This is one of my favourites from the folks at Flying Fish."
"Mouthfeel is good. This one always surprisingly gets better for some reason. I much prefer the draft to the bottle though."
"Medium bodied tawny chestnut brown. Toasted grain and malt nose, hops are only lightly detectable. Not as full bodied or complex as some German examples, though has a solid malt character with wheat, grain and dried fruit characteristics. Hops barely bite in the finish and could use more bitterness for balance the sweetness. Still a nice local session beer as the seasons change, for that in-between period of Philadelphia weather, not quite cool yet but thankfully the blistering humidity is gone. The mates and I bought a case and it didn't last but a day or two. Not too shabby."
"I recomend buying soon as it is very limited. Something different - a real treat!"
"Poured clear, bright with an orange-copper color. A thin head of off white foam topped off this one. The aroma is interesting and a bit strange. Light toffee and caramel malt but also has some perfume like notes, that I guess are coming from the hops. Taste has a grainy sour quality that just doesnt some to meld properly with the rest of the beer. I guess this can be called an eclectic oktoberfest, rather than an authentic one. Lightly sweet and malty in the finish. Not bad, with points for originality."
"This beer poured a crystal clear well-carbonated liquid that was orange/brown/amber in color. The head that was created off white to light toupe in color, fairly thick and creamy to the taste ant touch, some stickiness was noticed. There was some spotty lace throughout the glass, not like a true lace but more left over spots that drug to the bottom. The aromas that came from the glass were on the light side, but roasted malts and nuts were noticeable, some dry leafs, earthy ash, light fruit in the later aromas and finished off with a yeasty appeal to it. The flavors from this beer seemed to be bolder and more pronounced then the aromas. Tastes of cocoa, nuts, dark roasted malts, some leafs and ash were present all through each sip. Some sweet fruits were noticeable as it warmed in the middle of the sip, as well as some light herbal hops and dirt. But one thing was consistent was the all end sips were of yeast and yeasty nut bread. The aftertaste that was left was of bread yeast and a dry feeling on the tongue. The body was on the light to medium side. Interesting beer seemed to have lots of malt and earthy flavors that were pronounced and consistent all through each sip. An enjoyable beer and real easy to drink."
"A definite session brew, I enjoyed them through two straight football games this weekend."
"12 ounce bottle."
"A very pleasant surprise, and easily my favorite Flying Fish brew. Good stuff regardless of ale or lager. Don't geek, drink."
"Anyways, this fall ale isn't bad. It looks nice; lighter than a true marzen. It has a surprising amount of fall spice in the smell and taste; nutmeg and ginger mostly. I was pleasantly surprised at the hop character and bitterness of this. That's what really made me think, hmmm...not a real marzen. The malts are there to lend a little sweetness, a little of that nutty sweetly esteric flavor, but only just a little. This stays easily drinkable and nicely even in its elements. Just don't call it an Octoberfest, call it a seasonal ale."
"Prosit!"
"Malt dominant aroma, smelled a bit musty but after a few sniffs it seems more like cocoa. Medium sized cream colored head is fairly dense and leaves a solid coat of lace as it fades to a dense film. Clear golden amber colored beer. Malt from the aroma hits first in the flavor, cocoa joins in after a second while a crisp hoppyness keeps the malt from going overboard. Body is on the light side while the mouthfeel is slightly slick. Cocoa flavor/aroma made the beer seem stale, just didn't dig it."
"Deep coppery color-slight head and some nice lacing on the glass .Nice aroma-slightly nutty,toasted malt and a touch of caramel. Malty flavor upfront-subdued hop bitterness. Has a touch of caramel sweetness in the finish. Very nice body-not as thin as some ""fests"" though Im likening that to its being an ale versus a lager. A good beer-decent fall seasonal."
"I was pleasantly surprised at sampling this one, as the 2003 version reviews were mediocre. While I'm not sure this meets the usual ""requirements"" of an Oktoberfest; it is damn good. The mouthfeel is especially intriguing--I wasn't sure I liked it all that much, until I had sampled a couple. In taste, I think it rivals the O'fests from Germany, which are available in the USA? Unfortunately, I can't get this one in CT; but got a six in NJ visiting the in-laws this past weekend. Will ask them to get some more for me. This is definitely one to try, if you can find it. Good job to the folks in Cherry Hill, NJ."
"There is a little bit of an astringent mouthfeel, probably due to the alcohol."
"Dark pinkish amber color. Nice fluffy white head. Sweet malt (caramel) nose with sharp hop notes. Initial stinging taste of hops is followed by a sweet malt coated tongue and throat. Medium slightly thickish mouth. Very hoppy and bitter for a marzen. Not a traditional tasting brew, the errors however lean to my taste preferences."
" Silky smooth as you would imagine out of the cask. The body was medium, and not lacking a bit at all. I would definitely not call this your typical Oktoberfest bier, but it was enjoyable. Much more floral than its Deutsche counterparts, Flying Fish gave this brew an interesting little twist. Sweet malts balance the hops well to make for a simple, but good brew. It is definitely more along the lines of a cask ale than an Oktober."
"Another amazing seasonal from the Fish folks."
"Pours a deep copper-ish color, with a tan head which leaves a good lace. On the nose the aromas are of bread or toast and slight caramel. On the palate more of the same, light toasted bread, a touch of caramel, lightly hopped, slight bitterness, followed by more maltsemm one of my favorite beers of the night at the Grey Lodge..."
"2002 version. ""Not the ordinary Fest beer! Savory malt profile, generous hop finish."" This beer is intended for draft only, although I tried it in both cask version and bottle today. It's very deep copper - almost brown in color - with a foamy light tan head that holds very well and leaves some very good lace. The aroma is mainly of a toasty Munich malt - very clean and nice. There is a light fruitiness, but it doesn't seem out of character for a dark lager beer. The body is medium-light and the carbonation is standard, but it definitely has a presence in the mouth! The flavor starts with a Munich maltiness, followed by a nice, light hop flavor - almost unoticeable at first - but then reveals a moderate bitterness and finishes fairly dry. The hop flavor and bitterness are present but don't really go any further than that. A nice beer with an interesting toasted malt profile; but not overly exciting compared to standard Oktoberfests. Still, an enjoyable quaff for the fall season."
