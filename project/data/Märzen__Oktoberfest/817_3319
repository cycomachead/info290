The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, this was a damn fine beer (awful for an O-Fest...), one whose popularity here I can easily understand.

3.52,0,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"1/2 liter bottle of Austrian lager, Stiegl. I'm accustomed to seeing the pils around my area. The local college in Steubenville has an exchange program with a college in Austria all of the Catholic college kids come back state side with a craving for this industrial style lager from Salzburg. A deep golden akin to apple juice with a large white head forming thick with flowing stream of carbonation bubbles in the glass, speckled lacing sporadic but there. The nose has nice floral/herbal hops in the back end with an upfront, bread dough sweetness with hints of cooked vegetable pretty straight forward Euro lager truth be told, but pretty clean so far. An enjoyable rolling malt sweetness, think biscuit malt with some mineral water, just enough herbal hops to give it a zing, completely clean dry crisp lagered finish. This beer is meant to be drank in number, not complex at all but doesn't really set out to be that type of beer. This is industrial style mass produced lager with a decent flavor, I can't complain it is what it is. Not leaps and bounds above an American style light lager, but there's more tradition in this glass than your average BMC. Goldbrau is right it says it all it's Gold beer, highly force carbonated yet finishes clean with just enough hop snap to keep you coming back for another sip. If those college kids want to relive their semester abroad more power to them, I can see the sentimental value in a lot of bad beers this is just extremely middle of the road to be a go to beer for me.","WVbeergeek","Mar 03, 2014"

The darker Goldbrau is in fact pretty light, maybe just on the orange side of lemon yellow, with a little white foam. Aroma is an interesting blend of sweet corn (I'd be surprised if there is actual corn in here but perhaps), biscuit, and a bit of a funky "off" note that actually sort of works since it is subtle and far from overpowering. Old wet malt? Anyhow, taste is quite tart and acidic with a decent amount of carbonation, brown sugar and sweet dough with a little noble hop spice and a mellow sweet cherry note (a bit like cherry gum) that shows up early and persists through the crisp finish. A subdued but classy and well-executed Oktoberfest, just this side of a Pils or Euro lager really in terms of appearance and flavor, but with some rich malt character and no obvious flaws.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 13, 2013"

I got this with a sandwich while I was waiting for the pliny the younger tapping. was looking for the least offensive, most neutral brew I could find, as I needed to clear the palate for what I knew would be one of the best beers of all time. it came in a pint glass, perfectly clear and golden with a finger or so of thick white fluff. the nose was super fresh, very very german in origin from the malt. fits all the stereotypes, but seems to have more body than some of the standard offerings in this style. unfortunately though, the nose is this beer's best feature. it tastes a little old, mildly metallic, and lazily handled. the malt freshness didn't come through the thicker body, and there was a starchy flavor to this that just dragged the whole thing down. I didn't even get spicy food and it couldn't clear my palate for me. it got even more heavy as it warmed, and left me pretty unsatisfied, although I will say again that the nose of this beer is very promising, and I will have to give the bottled version a fair shake at some point. overall a very plain beer, something for the BMC drinker in your life, since its a tad more hoppy than the generic stuff, but its not worth the import price.","StonedTrippin","Feb 02, 2013"

Overall, this is a pretty average beer and nothing all that special in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 30, 2012"

5,42,5,5,5,5,5,"I have had this beer both on tap and in a 16oz bottle. It is a remarkable beer in either form. I seek it out. I don't think I have a single negative comment about this beer - to my palate it is perfect in every way. It pours a pure, bright golden color with a white head. The smell is primarily of yeast - it reminds me of making bread, the subtle burn you feel if you bring your nose close to the bowl of yeast and sugar and water. There is some of that in the flavor as well. There is some hop, but its bitterness is negated by the malt and yeast. The malt flavor is not detectable per se - it is felt in the soft texture of the beer and it counters the bitterness of hops. Yeast is the dominant flavor. Breadiness. Mouthfeel is superior. It feels smooth and wet - there is not a hint of chalkiness or dryness to be found here. Like a loaf of bread, this beer can become heavy if one overindulges. That said, it is highly drinkable if your intent is to savor its impeccable flavor. If you, like me, love lagers, this is a beer you should seek out - there is nothing revolutionary about it...German purity law etc...but it is so perfectly executed that I simply cannot imagine a better, more satisfying beer.","bcpriess","Apr 10, 2010"

I've never appreciated anything that slightly resembles the mass produced American junk, so this keeps itself away from that category as far as I am concerned","RblWthACoz","Sep 04, 2007"
2.36,-33,3,2,2.5,3,2,"Pale golden color, white one finger head that sustains for a little bit. Mild fruity malt aroma mixed with dry grains and a slight honey sweetness. Drying bitter hops is more assertive in the taste and faint notes of lightly toasted grains, citrus and mild fruity malt. On the down side is a stale breadiness and a blanketed rice like blandness. The finish isnt something I care to revisit with cereal grains, some floral hops, and a cheap white wine flavor. Mouthfeel is thin but descent and carbonation is moderate, a little too fizzy with micro foam.","cabsandking","Aug 20, 2007"

3.37,-4.3,3,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Pours a golden yellow color with a white head that leaves sporadic lacing around the edges of the pint glass. A good dose of malt in the nose with just a touch of hops. The taste much like the aroma is mostly malt with just a touch of spicy hops. The mouthfeel could use some more carbonation as it is rather flat and watery. Overall, this is a decent brew for what it is. However, I don't believe I will purchase again because there are so many better brews within the style.","cjgator3","May 20, 2007"
2.96,-15.9,2,3.5,3,2,3,"Mouthfeel is a downer as watery and fizzy are the descriptors that continue to pop into my head. There is an oiliness to the finish that, while usually a detractor, is actually welcome for its thickening quality here. Not a bad beer and it is all I've got tonight on this evening when my fellow Chicago BAs are enjoying the 2007 German Beerhall Crawl (yes, I know this is Austrian) with out me.

3.28,-6.8,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Pours a clear orangish-gold and a 2.5 finger white head with good contour and solid retention, leaving quite respectable lacing. The nose is mild, but features a good blend of sweet malt and slightly metallic hops. The mouth is very prickly and fairly heavy. While malt is present in the taste, hops determine the flavor profile from the start. A bit metallic and a touch harsh, the bitterness doesn't last long, but is pronounced. The finish is sweeter, as the malt makes a comeback, leaving a bready aftertaste.","Globetrotter","Jan 22, 2005"

3.73,6,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"The flavour is more akin to a weak Marzen style, or a malty Pils, I'm not sure where this beer is trying to go. Sweet malt up front, but the metallic grains take centre stage closer to the middle, very crisp mouthfeel there, and they linger on and blend in with the hops upon the finish, a dry crisp finish. It makes for a fairly decent pils, but nothing overwhelmingly special aside from a very impressive appearance, especially the head, which left thick webs of lacing, and a pinky finger cap of white foam all the way down the glass, amazing retention. Worth checking out, if only for the Scooby-Doo mystery of which style it really is.","IronDjinn","Apr 21, 2004"
