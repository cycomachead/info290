"Pours a slighty hazy dark amber in color with a thin off-white cap that settles down to just the sides of the glass for the most part. Some ring-like lacing is seen when sipped that slides back down the sides of the glass. The aroma is of caramel and roasted malts with a hint of candied fruit. Bit more going on with the taste as there is some very light spice(?) with some sweetness. Pretty smooth for this style of brew. Goes down easy with no bitter or harsh aftertaste. Medium-bodied with lower carbonation (a good thing actually). A tasty seasonal brew that I really liked. PROST!"

"This hits the style well. Very authentic. I am looking forward to drinking plenty of this during Oktoberfest season!"

"O) A pretty average O-Fest in my opinion."

"I bought it as a single. I'd buy a 6 pack if I saw it next year this time. Its a pretty beer to look at and a rich honey malty taste that begs a fall indulgance. I enjoyed this beer."

"Sprecher Oktoberfest may not be a lager suited to seventeen days worth of gluttonous drunken celebration, but it's a quintessential cool weather, fall-time lager: it is hearty, rich, and substantially malted. This brewery's best offerings are its German renditions, not their American-style stuff, and there's few styles more German than Oktoberfest."

"I had a Sprecher left over from a Wurstfest party I through back in September....just cracked it open and it is a decent oktoberfest. The beer pours a slightly hazy rich copper with thin head that is leaving a modest lace. The smell and taste are typical of most oktoberfest beers. There is sweet malt esseance that provides both. This is a lighter medium body beer with decent carbonation. Overall its good...would I have it again....yes."

"16 ounce bottle into imperial pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy deep red color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of raisin, caramel, apple, molasses, toast, bread, toffee, pear, light nuttiness, and light herbal. Nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of caramel, raisin, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, molasses, toffee, and herbal. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, molasses, raisin, toffee, and herbal on the finish for a bit. Very nice flavor balance and robustness; zero cloying flavors on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Oktoberfest. Well balanced robust flavors, and very smooth to drink. I have a feeling that this was a bottle from last year or older, but it held up nicely. Very enjoyable offering."

"O - Mild fruity carbonation is a hindrance to this lager, a style which should impart no yeast influence through and through, but damn if it doesn't continue to go down nicely! Sprecher Oktoberfest is a crisp and easy-drinking version of the German classic. While there are steps to take to really elevate this to something bigger, it does score with a nicely malty base and hop follow-through in the feel."

"O- a great marzen. could have been close to perfection had there been a tad more hops to break up the malt a little"

"M. Lands on the heavier side of medium body, lightly carbonated."

"Pours a medium brown color with slight head. Scent is malty with some spices in the mix. Taste has a lot of spices like cinnamon, clove, and other roasted spices. The texture is fantastic with a clean finish that leaves the tasty spices lingering. A great brew!"
""

""

"D: Pretty plain Marzen... ABV is pretty good at 6% but there is really nothing to write home about."

"O- Honestly one of the best marzens I've had. Really surprised by this, simple execution done right."
"This brew seems more like a pumpkin beer than a marzen. It has a medium amber color and low carbonation. The aroma has some sweet malt and caramel. The taste is rather sweet, caramel, toffee, and a touch of nutmeg and pumpkin. This actually seems more like a pumpkin ale because of the taste. The body seems just a hair thin and is nicely smooth. I'd have it again."
"O: This beer didn't look like much when I poured it, but the nose was good, and the taste was very clean and delicious. Very drinkable. I liked this better than the Hacker-Pschorr."
"o 4.5 they really nailed this. will have to have a lot to be sure, but possibly my favorite of the style."
"O: This is one of my favorite marzens as I like the thick and chewy styles. A great mixture to form a real sweet and inviting marzen for the season."
"Overall: Although I'm not a huge fan of the style I was able to enjoy the slightly sweeter side of beer as a break from the heavier/hoppier selections I've had lately. I'll keep a look out for it again next year when this time comes around to celebrate the great German tradition of beer."
"Overall: A very solid take on the Marzen style. The fruity qualities make it seem somewhat like an English ale."
"O-pretty good beer to start off the fall season"
"Overall: It's a good beer. Some Oktoberfests are too light. This one hits the caramelly malt notes well. Wish it wasn't a twist off so I could reuse the 16 oz. bottle. Would probably help seal the beer in better for storage too. Really, one of the best oktoberfests I've had this year."
"Enjoyable, true to style with some complexity, and sessionable. One of the better representations of the style from a US brewery that I know of."
"A fraction of sweetness and hops, the beer reeks of fall."
"Overall: Another impressive brew from Sprecher. I guess I'll have to order a case of this when it once again becomes available."
"Given their German-American heritage, it was almost a foregone conclusion that Sprecher would brew a pretty damn good Oktoberfest. Still, it's nice to see (and smell... and taste) that they actually do. Where's my liter mug?"
"Definitely a drinkable beer and best suited for around a fire on a crisp fall night. This is a great Oktoberfest, definitely one of my favorites."
"Sprecher Oktoberfest was amber in color. It had a beige head that didn't last. The smell was sweet caramel malt and a touch toasty. The taste was toasty caramel malt upfront with a little bitterness and hop flavor coming through towards the finish. The finish was dry and a touch bitter. It was medium bodied with medium carbonation. Drinkabity was good. This was a nice easy drinking Oktoberfest that is not as sweet as most; and worth a try."
"Purchased at Hy Vee Stony Brook, Omaha, NE 12/6/10"
"Very enjoyable. Encourages me to try other Sprecher brews."
"This beer pours a dark bronze color. The head is a quarter inch in height, and vanishes within seconds. The aroma is of caramel, with some floral notes. The taste is similar to the aroma. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with very low carbonation and a sugary texture. Overall, this beer is quite a let down. It is bland and boring, and I can't see myself drinking it again."
"A nicely balanced beer that has a lot of depth in its taste. This is a WI brewed ""German"" beer, so I wasn't expecting it to be of great German caliber, but it held up very good. A 6% beer with a nice balance and depth that makes it a very enjoyable drink."
"Appears a deep caramel amber hue with a light beige head floating. Fine speckled lacing coats the glass. Aroma has fruit mild caramel toasted malts going on together, not overly sweet in the nose. Flavor sweet caramel, toasted malts, mild nutty tone, with a light herbal hops background very sweet almost syrupy at times. Mouthfeel has moderate carbonation a bit cloying at times but drinks decently well for the amount of sweetness. Drinkability overall is had to stomach this sweet malt driven brews are making me crave hoppy brews, weird."
"Sprecher hit this one out of the park. Just an amazing Oktoberfest that hits all the right notes. Incredibly flavorful and smooth drinking. The malt shines through and brings a delectable bouquet of flavors and aromatics to the beer."
"Very drinkable, no shame or risk in offering this choice to an oktoberfest newcomer."
"D: Fairly drinkable, yet a little too sweet for my taste."
"Drink it is a very drinkable and tasty beer. One I will get again."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. It was a great oktoberfest, and rivals staghorn (my favorite okto) imo. I need to start buying more sprecher, the last two beers i have tried have blown me away. Keep up the good work!"
"There is a golf outing the second Tuesday every September I have this on tap for the first time. Right about the time SE Wisconsin Summer starts relenting. It is a beautiful beer - darker than most Oktoberfests with a rich creamy head. It smells of roasty caramel malt. It's taste is a bit more malty and caramelly and full flavor than most - not as nutty as most. I expect a tad more nuttiness in an Oktoberfest, but I am not dissapointed because I am nut inot the nutty thing. I am so primed after a long summer to malt it up. Nice balance with the hops not over hopped - this is an Oktoberfest - this is exceptionally drinkable."
"Pours a deep amber color with a whispy tan head that retains OK, a little darker than a lot of marzens out there. The aroma has tons of caramelized malt notes upfront, along with some toasted bread, brown sugar, toffee, honey, pretzel, musk and earthy hops. Flavor has some pumpernickel bread character initially, along with pretzel, toffee, brown sugar, earthy hops, a little musk and some alcohol. The carbonation on this one is way too high which really detracts from the mouthfeel and drinkability. A decent stab at a marzen but not one of the better examples"
"16oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a nice amber with about an inch of creme-colored head. Aroma and flavor are dominated by toasted malt and caramel. A very smooth and drinkable lager. When it comes to German-style beers, Sprecher does not disappoint!"
"This is not a surprise. Oktoberfest is after all, an autumn celebration for the love of good beer. Cheers!"
"It is a middle of the road oktoberfest that is probably not worth the time or money."
"Poured a solid orange, verging on light brown, with a thin but persistent light tan head. Bready aroma with a hint of grape-nuts. Nice malty flavor with a bit more body than most German imports, subtle noble hops balancing it out. A very pleasant quaff all around. As the German import Oktos get yellower and thinner, this may be truer to the Oktos of nearly a century and a half ago when this whole Oktoberfest thing started."
"Medium bodied with some nice caramel malt flavor balanced by a prominent spice characteristic. Lots of cinnamon and brown sugar along with subtle hoppy bitterness. Nicely balanced with a dry finish. Easy to drink but I probably wouldn't drink more than one of these in a night."
"D - Ok flavor, not sure i would go for it again though. I've enjoyed all of sprecher's beers, but this is probably my least favorite of the bunch."
"Drinkability: I've never had anything that was not impressive from Sprecher. They do a great job on all of their brews. This is my new benchmark for Octoberfests."
"Sprecher has presented a great beer for the cool, crisp air that can be a staple, go-to. Not too much or too little, this is simply a good beer."
"(D)- A solid oktoberfest with a good balance & feel to it. Granted, its not a great example of the style, but my tastebuds are not complaining one bit. I could definitely have a few of these. Yet another solid beer by Sprecher!"
"Big full body on this one. Still retains a nice crisp quality to it though. Carbonation level is moderate-to-high. I really like the flavor profile of this one. There some nice bittering hops in there, but it mostly consists of a full bready mouth, with touches of honey and caramel. Light grainy aftertaste that is pleasant. I really dig this. I wish I could get it around here. Thanks for the hookup, Andy. Another beer I wish I could get more often..."
"MF&D - a thicker and fuller body than the ayinger. a bit more drinkable too, the flavour was a bit more interesting."
"*Minor update for 2011 -- no metallic character this year. Upgrading Taste to a 4."
"Poured in to a 0.5L mug, this beer sported a dark amber to brown body with a nice off-white head the saddly faded away. Aroma is of toasted malts and a little metallic astringency. Light to medium bodied with malty flavors that follow the aroma. The finish was toasty and not bitter with a bit of alcoholic warmth. This beer seemed to flatten as I drank it, and overall it wasn't that memorable."
"A little bit on the old side, so it's probably not at it's best, but I can see this one being pretty damn good when fresh."
"Clear deep red-brown color with a light tan creamy head that quickly dissipates to a ring and leaves no lacing. Strong caramel, malty nose with some light hoppiness. Very creamy, full body with a slight hoppy bite in the finish. Flavor has nice balance of caramel sweetness and noble hops, slight nut and fruit (berry) near the finish. Very enjoyable, a nice light marzen."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a nice carbonation."
"Reddish orange colored with a slight tan cap of foam that settles quickly. Roasted grain and caramel maltiness with some faint pumpkin pie spice. Rich caramel and toffee with a nice hop bite in the finish. Smooth with fine carbonation. One of the few decent american made examples of the style."
"This is an alright version of an oktoberfest style beer. The color is actually lighter than I thought. The taste is alright, but once again oktoberfest style beers should be drank in mass quantities i.e. drinking out of a liter mug which is essentially three beers. The smell was the only thing I considered interesting. Pratically no head at all which is an odd character on a german style beer."
"(D) A decent Marzen, more aroma than bite but definitely German."
"Drank okay, this just was out of style to me, maybe age has already gotten to this?? Other than the schwartz, this brewery hasn't impressed me. Will try this again if I can find it really fresh"
"EDIT: After having another one, I came to notice that one reviewer was correct in saying that it finishes pretty dry. Perhaps that ""tingly"" feeling doesn't amount to anything worthwhile, because I noticed that it has the same effect of certain candies, where the only way to refresh yourself and knock certain flavors out of your mouth is to just keep consuming more. If you happen to like dry or even near-numbing beers, then just consider this as having a tastefully complex finish. I on the other hand, unfortunately had to go back and knock 1/2 a point down in the mouth feel and thusly demote the grade of this beer. But it is still a fantastic brew that I will continue to recommend."
"D - This a very solid Octoberfest. The beer drinks very smooth and easy."
"Pours a deep copper with a large dense head that falls to medium lacing. The aroma is sharp, large, and spicy, like cinnamon. The flavor is malty and spicy. A clingy mouthfeel highlights the malt burn down the throat."
"The mouthfeel came up a bit short for me. It was lighter than I would have liked. There is a light level of carbonation. One of the better parts was the dry aftertaste, which accents the beer and makes it fairly good. Overall, I would say this was a reasonably good beer that I would drink again, but I wouldn't want to have too many of them in a year."
"Slightly smooth and a pretty good oktoberfest brew. I thought this one was so, so which didn't prompt me to order another."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: My first thought when this beer hit the lips was full bodied and creamy. As aforementioned this beer has a dry finish. This beer is crisp with delicate carbonation. Everything about this beer just works in combination with itself. Each component of this beer compliments and works with others to create a great beer. This is one of the Oktoberfests that I'll put in my top five O-fests, its definitely one that I'll recommend to others, unlike many of the O-fests I've had. Its got an authentic, real feel to it."
"Very drinkable brew. The 16oz went down in a hurry. I probably could have let it warm up a bit. This is a solid brew, but not as good as I had anticipated from Sprecher."
"16oz. bottle: This one pours a clear, coppery amber color. Mine had a fairly decent tan head on it, but it drops away quickly and doesn't leave any lacing. The aroma is decent enough. there are notes of caramel malts, and possibly some fruits and floral aromas. The taste is very clean. A little sweet, with a mild spiciness to it. Hints of dark fruit with the caramel malt. Very drinkable."
"D: nice oktoberfest brew. well worth a shot for an americanized version."
"Spercher Oktoberfest a dark amber/copper color. This is the darkest O-fest I have ever seen. Smell has the typical malty smell of O-fests, and slight hint of hops. Taste is sweet up front, a good malty sweetness. It is followed by a medium hop bite. It has decent balance, not overly sweet. Mouthfeel was good, and this beer has very nice drinkability. Good O-fest from a good brewery."
"Overall drinkability is good, definitely a decent Oktoberfest makes me want to sample some of their other brews!"
"Not overly impressed by this Sprecher offering, but it is not bad all the same."
"I found this to be very drinkable."
"Clear dark ruby-copper body that yields a thin finger of slightly tan head with little duration. Rich malty aroma filled with caramel malt, hints of chocolate, and berry. Good taste--not great, but certainly good--very malty, creamy, smooth, and certainly better than many other Oktoberfests I've tried this season. Floral hops complement the malt nicely. The mouthfeel drives Sprecker's Oktoberfest to me; excellent, smooth on the palate. Very good all around, delicious, no weaknesses. Fine stuff and well worth trying from one of my favorite sleeper breweries."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Perfect for a fall drinking session. My bottle was labeled 6% ABV so I should slow the drinking down a little bit."
"D - A really nice O-fest that won't change the world, but will satisfy any Oktoberfest lover like me. Slightly above average for the style. I'd buy this again."
"this bottle may have been a tad off, bought it last fall and have had it in the fridge for 2-3 months, so it may have been on the edge freshness wise. it poured a clear amber/old copper in color with a minimal, quickly diminishing off-white head. aromas of toffee, dark bready malts, and a vague fruitiness. taste was mostly the malts, hops underlying, and a touch of sourness in the finish. frothy and finishes relatively drying and a bit puckering. medium-bodied. sessionable."
"The only thing maltier would be a bowl of grapenuts. One of the better O'fest made stateside. I wull check this one out again."
"drinkability is good. though somewhat lacking in body and boldness, this is an otherwise solid marzen. not the best from sprecher, but a decent brew."
"Shocking that it has taken me this long to try a Sprecher beer. This seasonal pours a dark copper color with a medium light tan head that diminishes pretty quickly. Stringy lacing. Caramel malt aroma with touches of fruit and hops. Medium-bodied and smooth with roasted malt, caramel and plum flavors. Touches of mildly bitter hops are there as well. The finish is short and sweet with a caramel aftertaste. Overall this is an above average Oktoberfest."
"This was very enjoyable as it pushes the limits of the style a little bit. A must try."
"Overall a very tasty and robust Oktoberfest."
"Pours a clear orange/brown, thick off white head forms, few lace spots, decent layer. Smell is sweet, caramelized, bread, iron and light citrus, thick malts, bit of floral, not bad. Taste is sweet, light fruits, citric sourness, bread, iron, caramel, light chocolate and a bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Decent Oktoberfest, maltier than most, but theres something about it that I don't really enjoy."
"Drinkability- I'm not sure why I have heard so many high ratings for this beer. Michael Jackson and lots of my friends agree that this is one of the best. I'm afraid that I must disagree on this one. This is the 2nd one that I have had and they are consistant at being not very drinkable, watery, and has the rusty metallic off flavor that make it downright bad. The smell is the only redeeming quality that I really noticed on this beer. Rich and malty, but there is something wrong with this one."
"Mouthfeel is good, substantial without being chewy or stout. Drinkability - all day!"
"Good beer, but I just wasn't in a rush to finish these off."
"This beer had a nice orange/amber color. Had a decent 1 1/2 head with medium lacing. It has a decent smell of some herbs and malts. The taste is slightly bitter which is not what I was expecting, but it is a clean taste and is smooth. This is a change of pace from what I usually drink but was good."
"A clear, deep red colored body, tiny white head doesn't stick around for long. Scent is that familiar oktoberfest malt smell, caramel and grainy notes. Same goes for the taste; pretty solid caramel malt flavor, some bready/biscuit notes. Not a bad oktober. Check it out"
"D- solid oktoberfest"
"D: I'm going on my previous experience with this beer and beers from this brewery. A solid choice with any style this brewery is great."
"overall i really enjoyed this beer, especially as it warmed up very nice"
"This is pretty on for the style. The only thing I noticed that was different from the imported o'fest beers is that this had long roasted flavor that followed the smooth caramel malts. The lager yeast could have had a little more character and maybe brought out more complexity. Still, this was a great beer and I could drink a big stein of it. Prost!"
"Not too bad."
"Drinkability is good an enjoyable rich oktoberfest brew, might be a touch past its prime but holds up well. Thanks go to merlin48 for this fine sample."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 3/4"" tan head over the clear dark amber brew. Head fades gradually, with plenty of lacing. Aroma is nutty malts with a light hoppiness. Taste also shows the nutty grains upfront, with a light fruitiness in the middle, and closes with a slightly sour bitterness that lingers in the mouth. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both pretty good, but it's got a little ways to go before being my desert island Ofest. Another nice Sprecher product."
"Sprecher has better beers out there."
"Had again 5 years later a fresh bottle and malts were well attenuated, mild and wewll integrated smoke."
"D - This one goes down easy but is somewhat boring. I will more than likely be looking elsewhere for future Oktoberfests."
"Easily drinkable."
"Quite a good representation of the style...would enjoy again for sure."
"D - Very drinkable, I could drink a lot of this."
"Drinkability: Glad I tried it, but not a good example of an Oktoberfest beer. I think I will stick with my Ayinger."
"Luminous copper body with a small beige head and minimal lacing. Aroma is toasty and malty with a big dose of caramel. A spicy hop note in the background. Mouth is creamy and medium bodied. Good carbonation. Taste is awash in chewy caramel, balanced by a pleasant spicy hops bitterness. A hint of red apple fruitiness adds a nice complexity. Smooth toastiness from the bready caramel maltiness is the keynote here. Very drinkable. One of the better American Oktoberfest biers."
"Burnt copperish with nary a head. Not too much lacing either. Maybe the tap was not the best. Smells sweet and nutty. Some spicy clove/banana elements seemed to be in the aroma as well. Taste is dominated by a caramel/toffee maltiness. More of a malty sweet than a sugary sweet which is nice. Solid yeasty flavors of biscuit and clove back this up. A touch of fruit from the hops but really almost nothing. Malts dominate. Rich in flavor. A bit of a raisiny finish lasts long. Fairly smooth but not poundable. I enjoyed this."
"This is a good oktoberfest. If you see it, try it."
"Single bottle purchased in Madison and smuggled back via checked baggage"
"Drinkability  This bier is hard to drink slow."
"Mouthfeel- Bready, warm and very comforting. Felt good to drink trhis beer right after work."
"A great offering from a great brewery."
"drinkability: easy drinking"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy with a blast of bubbly. Goes down smooth and satisfying. This would definetly be a good brew to pick up a four pack of around the fall season. A good seasonal from an underappreciated brewery (that makes some kick ass sodas as well!)"
"Pours a crystal clear amber with a big creamy khaki head. Doesn't smell like much, musty barley malts, a little grassy. Taste is equally, uhh, subtle. Grassy, musty-sweet malts, not much of a hop presence. Mouthfeel is thin and crisp. There really isn't much to this fest beer, I could pound back about 50 of them I s'pose but I might be a little bored. This is an all-around solid beer, just didn't really impress me anywhere. Good value though."
"16 ounce bottle. Pours out reddish brown with an inch of off-white head. The aroma is toasted malt with caramel and a spicy hop aroma. Deep caramel malt flavor. The malt is followed by a tasty fruit flavor. Hops are spicy and a little floral. Mouthfeel is a bit lighter than average. Drinkability is good. This is one of the better Oktoberfests I've sampled."
"Amber in color with an orange brown tint and an off white head. Big malt aroma, caramel, nut, toasted, and a floral hop in the background. Flavor is sweet malt and caramel with a finish of toast. Good body and nice lingering finish. Another fine product from Sprecher."
"From my buddy Dwight, straight from Illinois. This beer pours a nice ruby color with no head. The nose is nice sweet caramel, with some fruity tones, but not really something great. The flavor is lacking a bit. Its sweet and fruity, but not really doing much for me. The feel is moderate to thick. Overall, not a bad beer at all, but just okay as the O-fest beers go."
"Nice amber color. Theres a decent head that remains the whole way down. Faint aroma-some caramel notes,slightly toasted-the beer not me!!!! Malty flavor upfront. slight hop bitterness. Dry in the finish. Body is ok-maybe a tad on the thin side. An average beer-Id like it to have a bit ""umph"" to it in flavor and body and I think it could be a quite good Oktoberfest. Thanks to bashiba for the trade and chance to sample."
"The mouthfeel is very full and enjoyable for this style of beer."
"Clear, tawny-bronze in hue, there seems to be a noticeable coppery highlight, especially when held to a light. At this time I noticed a steady stream of animation racing to the beige head. The foam was two fingers in height at the apex. Head retention was very good and after a few moments it began to fade to a bubbly cap. Subsequent lacing was skimpy but the cap lasted the whole consumption. It is a good-looking beer. Clean malty nose that is slightly toasty with a hint of caramel and grain; grassy hops are at the back. The bouquet says O-fest and that is all I need it to say. Above-average potency. Inviting. Sometimes a good thing can be so simple. The palate is very enjoyable; it is ideally clean but plenty flavorful. The malt comes across dry and toasty but with another layer, which is sweet caramel. Random hints of bready-biscuit are noticed as well. The hops do supply a crisp bitterness and offer a healthy dose of grassy, slightly earthy/spicy flavors. Very nice, from start to finish; there is good depth. I like the long taste as it leisurely tickles my tastebuds yet it still holds my attention, as the flavors are bright enough. This is a very solid O-fest. Tasty. Medium in body, if not a tickle bigger with firm carbonation, all of this adds up to create a solid mouthfeel. This is a very enjoyable quaff, I could session with this beer, easily. Bring on the Polka and pretzels! I bouquet a 16-ounce bottle for $1.40 which is a damn good deal, IMO, it was purchased in Milwaukee, WI. More please."
"Hazy orange-amber color with a decent creamy off white head with some lacing. Veggie and bready aromas, fruity, nutty, caramel flavors. Medium bodied with a full and creamy mouthfeel, lasting sweet finish. Gets thicker and more flavorful as it warms, this is one of the best american oktoberfest I have had."
"A very nice beer. A bit of sweetness to the malt with gentle fruit notes. Toward the middle there is a bit of white wine dryness. The finish is very clean, bordering on too clean, but there is sufficient residual bittering to balance out. Nice maltyness, while at the same time the overall character is a bit lighter and fruity than the average O-fest. Rather than being a detraction, this adds to the beer's drikability."
"Overall a fairly complex beer. I'm just not sure all of it works for me. Much better as it warms, more like a ale than a lager."
"Smooth and nicely carbonated with a medium body. Very drinkable like an Oktoberfest should be."
"By far the reddest Oktoberfest I have seen to date. Head sticks aroung, and lingers a little bit on the top the whole way down. Honey and hops are in the flavor, which is ok, but nothing great. Has a funny aftertaste, though. Not one of the better Oktoberfests I have sampled."
"Thanks to jeffboo for bringing it across the border!"
"Another thanks to jeffboo for the sample!"
"Drinkability: Tastes like a macro lager, wht little or no O-fest character. Won't try this one again."
"Taste: The feeling in your mouth is very soft, the flavors are malty. This is a very nice example of a session beer. I can see why the Germans drink Oktoberfest beers by the liter."
"Amberish color quick disappearing head a faint sweet hop aroma,first taste faintly honey and carmel, thought it would have a bolder taste, nice smooth mouthfeel but not very complex, it goes to the end without getting to bitter.It seems sprecher uses the same kind of honey in most of its beers, they taste somewhat similar."
"Good easy drinking O-fest. I think the Hops were a bit too pronounced for the style, but not at all overpowering. This is a good beer that gets better the more you drink. One is nice, 3 are better. While I enjoy this beer it is neither a great O-fest or a great Sprecher. Buy some Black Bavarian if you want Sprecher, and some Elliot Ness or Wolnzacher if you want an O-fest/Marzen."
"Mostly clear reddish-copper in color. Some carbonation but minimal head that quickly disappears. A rich, bold nose dominated by caramely malts. Underlying grains remind me ho-hum lagers, but fruity, crisp hops are detectable too. Quite hoppy at the start. A strangely sour, even metallic, taste is too dominant in the middle and early finish. Malts make their way out as the beer warms, or at least as the mouth gets used to it. Mouthfeel is more watery than I expected given the richness of the nose but is nonetheless clean. This one is OK, but not something I'm going to reach for given the competition."
"Ruby red hue with a thin bubbly head as a partner. Huge and wonderful malty aroma, very nice. Sweet off the cuff, but well done, some caramel tones are noted and they blend well with the rich and creamy malts. Bordlerline on a full bodied beverage. Great body and incredible taste, this should be the definition of a Oktoberfest beer!"
"Deep copper color with a creamy beige head that puffs up nicely then fades quickly-minimal lace or stick. Malty as well as fruity on the nose. A pretty big mouthfull of suds here and pretty much a fine example of the style. Heavy handed on the malt yet still a good dose of piney hops. Some caramel corn chimes in on the finish as does some burnt caramel bitterness. I have to give the drinkability a low score as Sprecher (to me) is nearly always over the top to the point of being flabby. This one though does grow on ya, and perhaps with a next sample I will review a tad higher. But for now, one pint will be just right."
"Looks like there's a lot more variety in Okto beers than any style definition can contain, especially when American brewers are involved. Sprecher's 2003 brew offers a nice dark complexion with a good roasty malt character. This, in turn, counterbalances the usual sweetness of an Okto, leading it to the promised dry finish. Still, the mouthfeel comes in a little thinner than expected, but a good effort."
"The look is equally solid, having a beautiful amber body and substantive off-white head and solid lace effect. The feel is good with a solid body and finish to match the dryness. I was impressed by this beer."
"The Rathskeller Wine & Beer Fest:A medium sized ivory head with small sized bubbles.The body was clear and free of carbonation.The hue was amber and the lacing was good.The nose was moderately malty and it had a malty flavor to it.The mouthfeel was vert smooth, light bodied, and somewhat thin."
"Pours a beautiful clear amber with an off-white head. Aroma has a malt sweetness and caramel scent to it. Mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat creamy (especially in the finish). Flavor consists of toasted malt, caramel, with a slight spiciness that's apparent. Overall great balance. This is one of the better Oktoberfests available and one of Sprecher's better brews. I'd definitely recommend trying one if you can find it."
"A pretty nice Octoberfest...soft toasty nose...taste is initially slick and sweetish with a small spicy hop accent...toasted grains emerge after that...Mouthfeel gives me a somewhat sticky, sweet, syrupy texture...overall I think this is pretty good, but I have had several better (Summit, Hacker,Paulaner,Goose, Titletown,Capital)...better than average but not elite in my opinion.."
"Dark orange color, clear.  Pillowy and cottony head that ends up in nice lacy patterns.  Slight bright yeast aroma, in with maltiness.  Lightly spicy flavors, sense of bready/pumpkiny tastes and a cinnamon spiciness.  Finishes with a fresh but subdued hop.  This beer is typical of many O-Fests, starts full and malty and ends thinner and tighter.  Makes for an interesting complexity and adds to the drinkability.  No wonder they're served in big ass steins.  Good example of style in my opinion."
"This clear copper brew is topped by a slight creamy beige head that is well retained.  A deep malty aroma accented by some slight noble hop spiciness.  This is one of the better tasting Oktoberfests in the midwest.  Very nice malt profile here.  The caramel tones stand out.  Underneath that, there are layers of graininess and toastiness.  And to boot, there's a nice little (emphasis on little) hop kick and bitterness.  Smooth and creamy full bodied mouthfeel.  Nice marzen."
"Sprecher Oktoberfest:  Dark copper colored beer, under a very thick off-white head.  Very nice sticky lace.  Somewhat mild initial tastes of malt, but with an unpleasant taste that is hard to place.  I love Sprecher products, but this one is not up to their typical exceptional quality."
"A very nice autumnal beer."
"This is a great beer to search for when available in the fall, particularly if you can sample it at Sprecherfest at Old Heidelburg Park in Glendale!"
