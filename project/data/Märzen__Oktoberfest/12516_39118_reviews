"Overall, a very nice American take on the style and one of the better ones out there."

"12 ounce bottle into dimpled mug, 2014 release. Pours fairly hazy deep orange/copper color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, brown sugar, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/bready malt and light earthy hop flavors; with no cloying sweetness after the finish. Very clean malt flavors with minimal yeast esters present. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Oktoberfest style. All around great robustness, balance, and complexity of clean dark/bready malt and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Thirsty Dog Barktoberfest is a howlin' good ale (it's as good as that pun is bad). It's ultra-rich maltiness and all its notions of walnut cake and nutty pastry that accompany it, are irresistible, especially when placed inside such a quaffable, easy-to-chug-back lager frame. After the iconic German brands, this is an obvious one to recommend. In fact, it's a new personal favourite."

"T: Has a sharp acidity, poignant, slightly citric and woodsy. Grassy wheat elements and darker malts. Deep sweetness, bready, very toasty, and rich. I think its a well-attenuated showcase of vienna malts. Sweetness is decidedly like malt-candy"

"A decent Oktoberfest that doesn't necessarily stand out among the crowd."

"Pours a deep copper colored body with a nice two finger head. Light scents of whiskey, and a caramel biscuit. Solid malty goodness hits the palate with just enough hops to balance out the sweetness. Bursts of top notch crispy, caramel goodness. Very drinkable. Medium bodied but a heavy Oktoberfest than most versions today. True to the style. Deep and pretty rich. Great with spare ribs or barbequed anything. Nice and creamy and very smooth. It's a good one."

"Clear medium amber pour with a red hue. Very nice head and lacing that lingers. Very slight nose of sweet caramel malt. Light medium body and well carbonated. The flavor profile is laid back, as a marzen should be. It has a very nice balance of caramel malt sweetness and flavor with just a hint of hop bitterness. The carbonation yields a crisp finish identical to the flavor profile. Thirsty Dog is becoming one of my favorite breweries. Another outstanding offering that is true to style."

"O: Overall the body is a bit more robust then you may want in a typical octoberfest style, this is more of a heavier, robust, slower drinking, less volume version, not the traditional german old world style as its labels claim. Big sweetness and big syrupy body, some nobel hops, but not as pronouced, fairly reserved and could of been fresher. The abv% of 6.0 seems a bit higher then the norm, not unexpected from the heavy handed malt body. Still some toastiness, just a bigger, fuller american version, somewhat tasty by itself. I rated this per my expectations vs an true german style counterpart, some may like a fuller version in much less quantity to which i would say give it a try, not a bad tasting beer, just an offshoot american bastardization."

"Really yummy. Immediately one of my favorite Oktoberfests"

"Great Lakes brewery has been regarded as the gold standard in local craft brews but Thirsty Dog has come a long way."
"Pours a deep copper color with a white head and a sheet of lacework. Aroma of caramelized malt and buttery toffee. In the flavor, toffee, caramel and a faint hint of butterscotch. Fairly bitter, earthy hops do a fine job of balancing this seasonal lager. Medium bodied with a moderate carbonation. Overall this is a very good American Oktoberfest."

"Thirsty Dog can be hit or miss, but this one is a ""hit"" for sure. Some will be opposed to the sweet flavors, but keep in mind that this is a Marzen, and the malt needs to shine over the hops (and it does). What we got is really nice complexity, with bread, fruit and raisin flavors. The alcohol is expertly and dangerously concealed, and the mouthfeel is spot on, with medium carbonation and thickness and an impressively clean finish given the sweetness in the taste. There are a lot of Oktoberfest/Marzen beers out this time of year that don't impress. This is one of those beers that manages to be both well thought out and nicely executed."

"Overall - I can honestly say this Oktoberfest is unique compared to all the others I've tried. It's a little too sweet in my opinion, but it's still delicious."

"Overall: I find this beer very drinkable – I’m preferential to sweet and malty beers and this one definitely hits the mark. Great for sitting around a campfire on a cool fall evening."

"Overall delicious and will definitely buy again. Wished I had bought more than a single bottle..."
""
""
""
"Overall - Great beer that is easy to drink. Will remind you of Oktoberfest and the fall to come. I am a big fan of Marzens and this is up there toward the top."
""
"OVerall - One of the sweetest octoberfests ive ever had. Its easy to drink but i dont think id want to many of these. Its a little out of balance with the high sweet flavors, the fruits and spices get buried rather easy. Its worth a try but not a great example for what a marzen can be."
""
""
"Overall- Nearly an interesting spin on the Marzen . The sweetness is almost a little overwhelming, but seems to be okay."
""
""
""
"Wow, Great Lakes lost a head to head lager battle. This is a first for me."
"This is an Oktoberfest beer that I look forward to each fall. Nice example of the style. It's similar to Great Lakes Oktoberfest, but somewhat lacks the complexity. This is worth checking out if you come across it."
""

"An everyday autumn beer to sit back and enjoy with friends and bratwurst."
"This beer pours a bold, clear amber with a thin head and lace that lasts. The aroma is of roasted malt, caramel, and bread crust. The flavor is complex with nuts, roasted malt, and toffee notes with a hint of honey in the background. The mouthfeel is medium and smooth. Thirsty Dog Barktoberfest is a very good brew, very drinkable and a good example of the style. Highly recommended."

"Drinkability: On point with GLBC as one of my favorite micro domestics. Tons of flavor for a deceptively lighter-colored brew, and a lot going on. Only picked up one bottle to sample, but I'll definitely be getting more if I can find it. A nice surprise here overall, and one I enjoyed every second of."
"Drinkability: I love malt bombs and am a sucker for bocks, porters, stouts and usually Oktoberfests; but this one is just a sweet mess. Pass."

"Overall I thought this was a damn good American version of a Marzen. This beer was all about the malts and had just the right amount of toast to it along with a nice nutty flavor. This beer was really drinkable, just how it should be, I would have no problem polishing off a six pack of this on a nice fall night, one of the most drinkable Marzens I have ever had, this beer doesn't last long in my glass. What I liked most about this beer was the flavor and the drinkability, it was all about the malts and they imparted a really good flavor that made me keep wanting to take another drink. What I liked least about this beer was the aroma and the carbonation, the aroma was a little weak and wasn't too interesting, and the carbonation would have better suited this beer if it was bumped up to medium. I am kinda bummed that I found out about this beer at the end of the Oktoberfest season, had I known about this beer earlier it would have been in my fridge for all of September and October, I will make sure not to forget about this beer next year. I highly recommend trying this beer when looking for a good Marzen, it's a great American version of what a Marzen is all about. This beer is up there with their Tripel as one of my favorite beer from Thirsty Dog, I have only tried three of their beers but so far I have been happy with every single one of them so there's no doubt that I will be trying more of their beers. Thirsty Dog did a great job at making a sessionable and tasty Marzen that I find to be better then Samuel Adams Oktoberfest, it takes a lot to knock that beer out of the top of my favorite Oktoberfests but this beer brought the heat and I enjoyed drinking every drop of it, this is my new favorite Marzen."
"Pours brownish orange with a half-finger of fizzy head. Smells malty with some subtle caramel. The initial taste is malty sweetness, but that is backed by a bitter hop finish. This beer has a good hearty flavor that should be enjoyed by a fire on crisp fall days."
"Overall not bad, typical American Oktoberfest with reddish caramel malts and syrupy flavors, a bit of a decent lager flavor and just a hint of hops that could use more of."
"Morey's Bottom Line: This was a bit of a surprise to me. I've had a good amount of Oktoberfest this Fall, and this is without a doubt one the best. Recommend."
"Pretty good, solid Oktoberfest here. Easy to drink and gets better as it warms."
"Overall, this is a novel take on Oktoberfest that is still true to style."
"O: Not very complex, but it's so tasty I'm not complaining at all. Great fall beer to drink watching a football game."
"o - pretty enjoyable, but kinda lacking for the style. if it weren't for the lager yeast, i'd say this is like drinking a carmel apple. not sure i would buy it again, but if you're looking for a malt bomb, don't pass this up."
"O: I love this stuff. Thirsty Dog is really under the radar and its a shame. This is my first lager from them, if the others are this good I'll be all over them. I think this is right behind Berkshire for my favorite Marzen."
"Really great example of the style. I wish great craft lagers like this were a more common sight."
"I had this for the first time. Early on in the season. I am a big fan of thirsty dog but they were always over shadowed by Great Lakes. This beer however has exceptional taste and is smooth. Its definately an ACE in the Akron brewery's deck. Worth having and going back for seconds"
"O: This is one of those beers that's neither great nor offensively bad. It's solid, but not memorable."
"Hmmm. I've had this on tap before and thought it better than this. Too sweet for my tastes; I'd prefer the more tried-and-true Brooklyn I just finished reviewing (and dissing for its ordinariness) as a more classic example of the style."
"O- As far as Oktoberfest beers there are much better options. A little boozy for the style and the flavor is a little too earthy and medicinal. I wish more biscuit or nutty qualities were present in this beer."
"O: Good beer for this time of year. Style-wise, I was hoping more malts would shine through, it seems a little meek. I was looking forward to more caramel/toffee/toasted nuts flavor. Its pretty easy to drink and sessionable though."
"Just a fantastic octoberfest in the flavor department. Bursnting with juicy melted caramel, and toffee. Butterscotch flavors very malty and cereal ridden. Full of fresh baked sweet breads with just enough hop to balance and keep things from being cloying. Thick, creamy, with good carbonation. Just delicious."
"Overall I welcome the style and they did a very good job representing it. If I could get it cheaper than 3 dollars a bottle (18 dollar sixer) I could enjoy it more. Damn Thirsty Dog is pricey here."
"On a separate note, the Thirsty Dog Brewing Co. has a VERY similar label to the Great Lakes Brewing Co. Not sure if they are affiliated, but I thought this was a GLBC beer when I got it."
"Thirsty Dog Barktoberfest is yet another impressive offering from an Ohio brewery that tends to get lost in the mix. Great Lakes in clearly the class of the state, but these guys deliver the goods as well."
"D - Drier than expected for a Marzen style, and a bit hoppier on the finish, too. Wish it had more body. While there are better examples of this style, I could see enjoying a few pints of this if it were found on tap and not up against other craft Oktoberfests."
"Spot on for style, very drinkable with a ton of malt flavor on the palate."
"Standard Oktoberfest pour. Copper/amber is appearance with pearl white head. Loses points for lack of head and retention. Aroma full of malts... caramel, grains, toffee and actually a decent amount of coffee, which I found very unusual. Nice smell though. Taste follows the nose. Good amount of caramel malts, bready flavor, toffee and yes, the coffee flavor carries over. A little bit of grassy hops finishes out the beer."
"Poured into a pokal a deep bronze with a half finger white head,the color was quite deep for the style.Aromas of caramel,sweet dough,and light splash of herbal/spicy hop,pretty standard palate with caramel and toasted grain the main components,light herb in the finish.Not a bad O-fest lager but pretty mainstream compared to alot of better ones out there."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with a light, crisp body and an almost watery feel. Quite drinkable and easy to put down; a very good Octoberfest that is sweeter than most, but to me was a good aspect of this beer."
"D- Very drinkable, probably one of the best American brewed Oktoberfests out there. If you're a fan of Oktoberfests this one should definitely be on your annual list."
"Pretty copper. Still. Nothing-head. Smells of toasty unidentifiable malts... maybe German, maybe not... almost a pumpkin note, buttery toasty-bread sweetgrain here, very small amount of bittering hop... taste follows... an easy, no-frills no surprises Ofest. Finish is lingering toasty malt (good), a little dry bitters and a hint of red apple esters. Mouthfeel is dry-crisp-fizzy and fine, is actually a lot drier than expected... interesting. Finish is much more fruity than it ""should"" be and reminds me, bizarrely, of Lost Abbey Lost & Found. Drinks okay. Would drink if this were local, but it's not German and seems like it uses an odd yeast. Worth a shot if you like the style."
"Poured an apple juice type color with no head to speak of. There was also no carbonation at all rising. Aroma was malty, slightly sour, with trace hints of wheat/grains. Taste was mellow, started off malty and grainy, just like it smelled, but not in a bad way. A bit of bitterness formed after lingering in the mouth. It felt good in the mouth, there was carbonation on the toungue despite none being evident in the beer, and it coated well. Good to drink, it was well balanced a fairly solid oktoberfest."
"Overall: Decent beer. Bitterness is a little too high for this style. With all of the other good Oktoberfests on the market, it would be hard for me to choose this one."
"Pours a crystal clear copper amber hue with a bright off white head, forms thick lacing around the glass as it dwindles. Aroma caramel malts, earthy/spicy hops will imbibe and report back sensations. A spicy hop background upfront caramel malts/nutty tones as well, this is solid maybe a touch of diacetyl (butter). Have no fear it doesn't hurt the flavor profile it's not offensive for me, but I'm not sensitive to that flavor. Only offense for me is overall sweetness it hits the super malty profile without hitting me with enough herbal spicy qualities to balance things out. Mouthfeel is creamy assertively carbonated, not thin not heavy or cloying. Drinkability overall is alright a bottle wasn't bad but this style is meant to be drank by the liter and this version doesn't justify that portion size."
"A straightforward interpretation of the style. Caramel malt-forward, some moderate grain notes. Finish was a rather pungent quinine bitterness that was out of place in the style. I've noted others complaining of butterscotch notes, but my bottles have none, so perhaps a bit of quality control at the brewery? The label art with the dogs howling at the moon was an amusing touch."
"Picked up a single at Abe's Cold Beer. I wasn't sure what to expect, but this turned out to be a very tasty lager. It was a little too toasty for the style (though I won't short it for that) with smooth mellow bread and hint of caramel. The only knock is a mild touch of diacetyl in the aroma. Still, I'd be happy to have a stein full of this Oktoberfest any time."
"There was almost certainly some sort of diacetyl problem going on here, but it was so far gone that the brewery should have caught this. I will rereview if I get the chance to try this again. Definitely not the intent (I hope) of the brewery for it to taste like this."
"D-can't get over the off sour green apple, not a fan of that flavor and I don't think it should be there."
"The heavy sweetness is never balanced with malt complexity or hop bitterness thus the sweetness causes early fatigue of the palate."
"Drinkability: I'm torn on this beer, it smells really good but falls short on the taste. I have another bottle to try but I'm not sure if I'd get again or not."
"Solid, drinkable festbier!"
"i've kept the mouthfeel score low because i reckon it's a touch on the supple side, but actually think this works out quite nicely"
"Overall, not a bad take on the style, pleasant and drinkable."
"On to the beer.. pours a pretty, light amber with carb-o-plenty. A thick head soon turns into a lacy ring, typical of this style. Smells phenomenal, yeasty and sweet and toasty. Taste starts with more of a bitter tip than other marzens, which I like, all the while balanced very well with toasted malt. Finishes bitter, and sorta sticky, but not too bad. Feel is nicely carbed and dense. Just a fine-drinking marzen, and a great representative of the style. Excellent."
"It's really pretty in the glass, and it has another cool dog oriented label (a bunch of doggie ghosts in a pumpkin patch). I am just glad I don't have more."
"Overall a solid example of the style. Not the best ever but very, very serviceable. I would have no issue at all with trying this one again any day, simply very drinkable."
"D- Easy to drink for sure. If you haven't had it go for it. I'll stick with Great Lakes or Sam Adams."
"I'm not sure what I think of this one. I've had better Fests, no doubt, but this was a decent beer for sure. Some characteristics I didn't like, but others I did. Try it for yourself."
"Pours a nice copper orange color with some nice initial head, but no lacing. Nice malty sweet scent, with hints of jerky Enlgish hops. Nice sweet malty flavor as well, with a hint of caramel, but with an odd hop aftertaste; more English than German. Goes down well, the odd hop aftertaste does not linger, but rather a nice sweetness does."
"D - I found this to be a nice, drinkable Marzen. Nothing earth shattering, but I could put away quite a few on a fall evening."
"Overall, this is actually a pretty decent effort from Thirsty Dog. Definetly one of the better Octoberfests I have had this year. But, as a whole, these beers remain rather unremarkable overall as there are much more festive and flavorful options out there. Worth a try, especially if you are a fan of the style."
"while the marzen lager isnt my favorite style,this is a very good beer.worth seeking out,imo."
"Notes: The first Thirsty Dog beer that did not REALLY impress me. I should note that I had Great Lakes Brewing Company Oktoberfest earlier today and having the two of them so close together really shows what this beer lacks."
"D- a pleasant suprise and not very Americanized, if hearty fresh grain could be considered so. The mf wins me over as it's not too heavy and not too light."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, not quite the best Oktoberfest that I've had but it's worth drinking for a while."
"Overall- An easy pint to throw back here. Flavorful but a bit light around the edges. A novice Marzen."
"Poured an amber/copper clear liquid with a white foamy head. The head disappeared rather quickly leaving some lace on the glass. Immediately I noticed a fruity smell. Should this be possible in an Oktoberfest lager? Taste is rather carmely followed by a fruitiness. Very little hop flavor or bitterness. Medium body and low carbonation. Overall, I am not sure about the fruitiness in this beer. It is not bad, but does not seem to fit the style. It also seems to cut back on the drinkability. Overall, not bad, but does not seem to fit. There are several others rthat are better."
