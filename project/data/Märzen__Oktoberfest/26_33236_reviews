"Overall: I know 3 Floyds loves to over-hop everything they do, and most of the time it works out really well. This is not a style for which that strategy works."

"Pours a dark amber. Not much head. 1/2 finger at best. Caramel nose. Not much else. Caramel with large orange undertones. Not much presents of hops. Nice amount of carbonation. Clean mouth. I'm not a lager person, but this , I would recommend!"

"Interesting spicey marzen lager.  Spices, dried cherries, plums, but a bit too much.  Good, but not great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a modest brew from 3F, they should stick to what they're good at and that is not lager."

"Overall: For a Three Floyds beer, this was fairly normal. It is a good Marzen, but I payed $9 for a bomber, and I could get a 6 pack of something just as good at the same price."
"Taste-Pale malt, toasted malt, spicy hop note. A decent interpretation of the style. A nice match for German potato salad or sausages."

"Trying the Munsterfest for a third time....but I now have a chance to write a review. Cracked a bottle open tonight and the beer pours a very nice clear amber (I left a heal in the bottle to avoid sediment). The head is thin and white and is leaving some lace. The scent is fairly faint....there are subtle bittering hops and slight burnt malt. The taste is a well balanced Marzen style and probably one of my favorites of this style. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall an excellent offering."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Easily the most normal beer by FFF. Though it lingers on shelves for a reason as it doesn't do anything to distinguish itself from other oktoberfests."
""
"(218th)"
"P.S.: I forgot to mention the hops...To me, the hops in this particular Oktoberfest lager taste far more citrusey (sp?) & biting than most other 'fests I've had. I like that about this brew, & with the sweetness added from letting it sit for a bit, this makes for an Oktoberfest that is in a league of it's own."
"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a lightly foamy (1/4), but mostly smooth (3/4) mouthfeel. This gives the beer a bit too much of a syrupy, cloying feel on the palate that neither works well for this beer or matches expectations for the style. Closes dry, with substantial stickiness on the palate and lips."

"Amber/copper color, 1 finger of head that dissipates quick,no lacing. Smells like wheat, bread, slight pumpkin, corn, rice. Tastes basically like it smells, with some banana in there. Mouth feel is light to medium, alc is covered, and it has a lager aftertaste (bready. Banana).overall this is a great oktoberfest, one of the best of the style that ive had."
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Lighter side of medium. Clean sip."
""
""
""
"O- I'm really impressed by this, I don't usually like their style because it's usually very malty and too grainy. This is so well balanced, great texture, nice sweet flavor, not too thick in texture. I'm glad I got to try this, the best Oktoberfest I've had personally."

"This a lager that drinks more like an ale. It definitely has marzen characteristics, with a Three Floyds' twist. It's not exactly a traditional example of the style, but it's close enough and is still enjoyable. The craftsmanship is clearly there."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall it was a decent Octoberfest, nothing to rave about but that tends to be the case for me with this style it very rarely wows me if at all."

"22 ounce bottle into pint glass; no bottle dating, but it is from the 2012 release. Pours very hazy orange copper color with a fairly dense 2 finger off white head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers for a bit. Minimal lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of pear, apple, grape, caramel, brown bread, toasted grain, brown sugar, light pepper, floral, slight nuttiness, and herbal earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and strength of fruity and malty notes with light hops. Taste of pear, apple, grape, caramel, brown bread, brown sugar, toasted grain, light pepper, floral, light nuttiness, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, caramel, brown bread, brown sugar, toasted grain, floral, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of fruity and malty flavors; solid complexity with good robustness; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Oktoberfest style. Nice balance and robustness of fruity and malty flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Pours a translucent copper-amber color with a short-lived, a light caramel/eggshell colored head. The head disappears way to quickly. Bubbles constantly migrate from the bottom of the glass. Mouthfeel is slick and wet, with very little carbonation. So little, that I wonder if this bottle is old. Not much going on on the nose. The obligatory toffee, but on the very light side. Some notes of dark red fruit. Flavor is pretty lacking. Not bad, just not 3F. The flat flavor and the flat mouthfeel are certainly not complimentary. I'm so familiar with 3F, it's hard for me to believe that this bottle is not old."

"A great respresentation of the style, particularly from an American brewer. Simple ingredients in just the right ratios make this a beer the Germans would be proud of. Overall, a really, really good beer."
""
"Poured a hazy darker amber color, with a small white head that quickly sank to a ringlet. Bready malts on the nose, caramel, light fruits, light hops. No surprises here. Similar taste, bready malts, caramel, notes of pear and apple skins, a touch of citrus pith bitterness. Light-medium body, fairly drinkable, an good average marzen."

"O- Pretty average to the genre, not my favor but pretty good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Not bad. A little underwhelming, but a standard Marzen here"
""
""
"taste is octoberfestery as you would expect. I've been in the spirit of octoberfest lately so I've been having a lot of these beers and honestly I would choose the revolution octoberfest over this."
""
""
""
"Smells only lightly of citrus peel and nutmeg spiciness, but maintains a core aroma of bready caramel malts. The flavor follows suit mostly but has a somewhat higher citrus peel accent and a touch of nuttiness on the finish with a bit of earthy hopping. It's serviceable, but there are more exciting marzens out there on the market than this. Surprising mostly for how 'normal' this beer plays out for a brewery with the slogan of ""it's not normal."" I believe it may be the black sheep of their lineup in this regards."

"Poured an amber orange hue with an inch of creamy white foam leaves spots of lace. Smell is malty, caramel. Tastes similar to smell with notes of caramel and malt, citric bitterness is noticeable and not as sweet as I'd like to see for the style. Medium bodied with decent carbonation. Decent brew, but not a fantastic marzen."
""
"I like the different flavors, but it just needed a bit more oopmf."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - let me start by saying that Munsterfest is now #2 behind the GLBC Oktoberfest in my marzen ranking. I was expecting a totally different brew from FFF, but this hits the marzen/Oktoberfest style with perfection. Just a tasty lager meant for the festive autumn season. Great flavor and a bottle full of sweetness."
""
"O: A nice beer for sure! I was a bit taken back by the lack of nose on this, but the taste and mouthfeel came to the rescue! Well done for the style, easy and smooth to drink, and overall solid."
""
""
""
"Overall - Nice, tasty and smooth. Alcohol is masked well, malts are the featured flavor. Everything you want in a octoberfest, maybe a little more hoppy then most but its solid and actually a safer/normal beer from 3 floyds, and that i feel makes most not enjoy this as much as they want to admit. Worth a drink for sure."
""
""
""
""
"Morey's Bottom Line: This is only my 2nd beer from Three Floyds, and it's definitely a good representation of the style. I'm not sure why, but as good as it is, I was expecting a bit more. Still not too far behind Great Lakes and Barktoberfest."
""
"O- This is a beer anybody could drink and be happy with but I was honestly expecting more out of three floyds. This one is good but it doesnt live up to the brewery's reputation or the price tag."
""
""
"O: Pretty good. Simple, but good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (3.5): I like everything about this beer except for the sweetness in the taste. Would drink again, but won't seek it out."
""
"o - i've come to really dig this style. munsterfest has a really nice flavor and feel and an oktoberfest i'd be happy to drink every fall."
""
"O- overall a great beer. A little bit sweeter than most Oktoberfests."
""
"O: Probably my least favorite 3F thus far, but on the other hand better than many Oktoberfests I've had."
"Pours a clear, dark golden color. Aroma of bready malts and citrusy hops upfront. In the taste, biscuit and mild grapefruit flavors. Bitterness is pretty pronounced, along with more bready flavor. Lightly roasted malts. Citrusy and bitter for an Oktoberfest, but quite nice and in good balance. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and crisp. Overall, a nice twist on the Oktoberfest style, and a quality hoppy lager."

"Decent drinker, but nothing special. Perhaps better when at relase, no freshness dating, so we will never know.. Would do better as a Keller bier IMO"
""
""
""
"O) I was pretty stoked about trying this brew. I typically really enjoy anything by Three Floyds, not to mention I had read this was the gold medal winner in the Marzen category at the 2011 GABF. Unfortunately, I was slightly disappointed. It wasn't bad, but I'll be sticking to the Wisconsin brewers and German imports for my Oktoberfest beers."
""
"D - Clean and pleasant taste; refreshing lager characteristics make this an enjoyable beer for anytime of the day, from dinner to summertime"
""
"O: It's an Oktoberfest, what can I say? I've never had one that was interesting or complex, but that's not really the purpose of the style. That said, I'd rather have a Spaten."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty standard Marzen, and even a little on the sweet side. Expected more from Three Floyds, but nevertheless very well done."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- All the characteristics of a traditional Marzen are here. Nothing crazy or earth shattering going on. Just a nice, classic example of the style."
"Not exactly terrible but pretty unremarkable. Meh."

"O - A bit darker than expected, but I enjoyed that it wasn't overly sweet."
"Nice traditional oktoberfest flavor of toasted malt, fresh bread, candy corn, and spice well-balanced with hops. In fact, this one seems to have a bit more ``zing'' than a few others I've had this year. One expects a beer from 3F to be anything but normal, but they seem to have minded their manners here and delivered a good, traditional oktoberfest beer. Like all good oktoberfest beers, this one is wonderfully smooth and drinkable. Pity about the price."
"Overall this is quite a delicious beer - perhaps a bit sweet (under attenuated?) for the style, but refreshing and quite drinkable. Will seek this out and drink it again."
"Overall this is a rich, malty and easy to drink lager. Exactly what you'd expect for a Marzen or Oktoberfest. Great malt complexity without being overly cloying, very drinkable."
"A very reserved beer from FFF, but extremely delicious nonetheless. Very glad I picked this up."
"O - overall a good easy drinking offering from FFF. This one was good and pretty true to the style without too many of the normal FFF curve balls. I would definitely buy a couple for the fall season."
"O: A very very nice Oktoberfest. Probably the best Oktoberfest I've had. A really good drinking beer."
"Overall a very easy to drink beer, good malt flavors, and great mouthfeel. A really nice beer for the style."
"Wow, I thought from the smell this would be kind of ho-hum, but the taste really impressed. Unfortunately, it didn't impress me as representative of the style; it is way too fruity. Still, tasty, easy drinking, and enjoyable, I'd definitley put another of these down if given the chance."
"Munsterfest is an interesting beer from Three Floyds. Generally, their beer is pretty aggressive, full of flavor, and a little in your face. While Munsterfest is none of those, it is a pretty good Oktoberfest. It’s tasty and features a nice little twist with citric hops. All in all, it’s a pretty balanced, reserved effort from Three Floyds. Still good beer though. Definitely worth checking out."
"O -- An enjoyable Oktoberfest, but not one of the top. Still, I would have this again."
"Cheers."
"Light to medium body with good carbonation, very easy to drink. Need a big stein glass so I can pour the entire bomber into it and give a hearty Prost! to my neighbor."
"Mouthfeel and Overall – Definitely a dry beer. Crisp and refreshing, though I did crave water as I drank it."
"""Es Ist Nicht Normal," eh? Well, despite Three Floyds being an absolute favorite brewery of mine, I have to scold them for putting this German-ized translation of their slogan on this bottle, because, well, this is pretty much as normal as it gets."
"Overall not too impressed, weird malt flavors, astringent, bitter, and tannic finish with light esters too. In all that no toasty straw, no crisp clean lager, no dry finish..., just a strange beer. I expected a lot more from 3F, although both of the lager beers I've had from them were the only real two 3F beers I was quite unimpressed with. Maybe they're just not in the right environment or ingredients (water or whatever) for lagers."
"O -- Other than the pretty wimpy head-retention, this is a pretty good take on the style. It's interesting that the noble hops are utilized in a way that gives them up-front prominence in such a balanced beer -- most traditional Oktos' hop character is back of the malt. The dryness could become fatiguing to some palates, but I think the bready malts save the day. A respectable offering of the style."
"Over all I liked it. It's absolutely not what I was expecting out of 3 Floyds and it almost taste more like something made by Upland, which is not a bad thing in my book. Just not what I was expecting."
"O- This is a VERY nice, traditional octoberfest. Not something that I expected from FFF- seeing as most of their brews are unique or edgy. This is slightly sweet and very mildly hoppy. Well done overall."
"O- A very solid representation of the style. Maybe a touch pricey at $8.99/22oz bomber though."
"O: A great beer and I love the direction FFF took with this style and beer. I will frequent this beer a few more times this season if I can find it."
"There are some good qualities, but there are also just as many bad qualities to this beer. Not worth the money. I'll stick with GLBC and Sam Adams."
"Good, but at the going rate for Three Floyds beers, not one I'll revisit often."
"O: A decent beer, but I was expecting this beer to pop much more than it did. A very restrained beer from FFF that is really quite average. The bottle proudly indicates: ""Es ist nicht normal," but I'm not so sure I'd agree."
"I read on the label once that this was brewed according to the Reinheitsgebot and then did a double-take as I struggled with the thought of the Floyds brewing something so ordinary-sounding and historically ""pure"" (for lack of a better word). Figured I'd have to try it out. It pours a lightly hazy bronze-straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises grass, cracked wheat, buttery biscuits,, light nutmeg, honey, light caramel, and a few scraps of grapefruit rind. The taste primarily follows the grainy path made from the elements above, but with a nice twinge of orange and grapefruit zests. The honey and caramel also pop in at various points, so as to ensure that everything isn't all grassy malt and whatnot. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and an appropriately grainy feel. Overall, a very nice O-Fest-like brew, nicely balanced and surprisingly refreshing. Right on."
"O: My least favorite Three Floyd’s beer so far. The skunkiness wasn’t enough to totally put me off, but the thin palate and even thinner body make this a beer I’m not planning on going back to. Oh well, I can’t stay mad at Three Floyd’s for that long – Broo Doo will be here in a week!"
"this was a very good domestic and enjoyable oktoberfest. Not super malty, but with more hops to it."
"Served in a stein glass at 3 floyds. Pours an almost amber with a good head. The retention is pretty amazing. This is a pretty solid tasting brew. It as an easy drinker but still has some substance. I am not extremely familiar with this style, but it tastes pretty good to me."
"o: First time trying this FFF release. It's decent but nothing seems to stand out for me. Worth a try but not certain I would seek this out again, especially considering the price."
"O - A nice Octoberfest. Very light and enjoyable...perfect for the warmer months of fall/end of summer."
"Overall this is a better than average example of the style for an American brewery but fails a big short for me because it lacks the certain crisp and clean quality of the traditional German styles. Don't break your back to find it but it is worth a go if you stumble across it."
"Medium mouthfeel. I would pick this over any pumpkin beer I've had in the fall, but I'm not a fan of pumpkin beers. Decent offering overall."
"D-Overall for its style i was very impressed. Im kinda confused as on the bottle it says lager but on here it says its style is oktoberfest. But no matter which it is i think its very flavorful for the style and didn't exspect much of it when i picked up the bottle but thought it was quite tasty. I would def. get this again"
"Big thanks goes out to enelson for this one in a past trade! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured yellow-orange with a two finger fizzy off-white head that subsided to a half finger slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, brown sugar, pumpkin, and sweet potato. The flavor was of sweet malt, pumpkin, sweet potato, brown sugar, and subtle spices. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty tasty brew for the style. Got this one awhile back and found it while consolidating my cellar. Still had an excellent flavor and aroma going on here though. If you enjoy this style of beer you owe it to yourself to at least try this one once. You won't regret it..."
"O: Prosit! I think FFF should sell 6-packs of this stuff and charge the same price I just paid for a 750ml. bottle. $10 for a bomber huh? This is the only real problem I found with this brew."
"D - A tasty Oktoberfest. I was expecting something a little bolder coming from 3 Floyd's."
"Thanks to hurfer for this bottle. Poured from 22oz bottle into snifter glass. Pours a deep orange/amber color, light haze to it, with a foamy white head that quickly disspates. Aroma has a very sweet profile as a whole with a good amount of grainy malt nose, very strong noble hops profile with a combination of sweet grassy and spicy notes and finishes with a light soured malt note. Flavor starts off with a strong hay and light toasted malt note early (cereal) with noble hops grassy finish. Body is very light, which I suspect, is from the low carbonation present in the brew. Texture is kinda watery. Overall, a big disappointment as the nose is unimpressive and the texture of the brew really doesn't help the lackluster flavor. There are better Oktoberfest brews out there."
"Another solid offering from Three Floyds. Sturdy body with well-balanced malt notes. Caramel is predominant, but at an appropriate level. Perhaps a touch more hops than traditionally found in the style, but still well-within the traditional profile. A bit bigger and bolder than some, and that is good."
"Overall, a solid marzen that was just a bit too sweet for me. Still worth trying but by the end of the bottle it's a bit too much. Not avail here in TX so shipped back from my Indy trip. Rotation - would like to try again closer to the release and on-tap. Not my go to style but worth a bottle a season. [O;O]"
"D - Very drinkable Oktoberfest, medium bodied, well balanced, I would for sure get this brew again. Another great brew from Three Floyds. I recommend this brew"
"Overall, a nice marzen style beer I enjoyed way more than I expected to. I'm usually not the biggest fan of the style but the smooth malt flavors, clean finish, and high drinkability really impressed. I would definitely have this again if I had the chance."
"D: I would enjoy a few glasses of this beer with some BBQ or pickled eggs."
"Drinkability is good and the abv is just right."
"Beer is pretty malty, nice bready mouthfeel. Forward flavors are slightly sweet. Finishes cleanly and not too dry. For a marzen, its quite good. The malt backbone is well thought out with good connectivity. I would definitely drink this again."
"All in all I think this is a good representation of the style but would appreciate a little more creativity from 3F as they tend to do."
"Pours a light rusty brown with a bit of an off white head. Mode brings some slight caramel and toffee and a bunch of doughy malt. Taste is quite bready with a bit of sweetness in the background. Light to medium body and good carbonation. Drinks well, but nothig all that special about it."
"If you like Marzens then check out this beer. It is unique enough to hold the interest of even Oktoberfest skeptics."
"D- Ok this beer is highly drinkable to me. The beer itself is nothing like FFF beers per say. It's well crafted I think and this leads to the drinkability of it. The alcohol on this is low enough that a bomber plus some is a easy goal for me to obtain."
"I was looking forward to this beer. I've been enjoying the Octoberfest and Harvest ales lately as a relief from the IPAs that I have barraged my palette with all summer. The color is just as pretty and red as the leaves that decorate the trees here in the midwest. The flavor is calm and smooth. Atypical of what FFF's usually prides themselves on. I think the calm and subtle flavors would start to disappear after more than a pint or two, which is disappointing. I can't say that its my favorite harvest ale, but FFF have continued to brew beers that I continue to enjoy and look forward to."
"I still love three floyds but I am going to never have this again. I love all their other stuff that I have had but alright so every brewery makes a black sheep. They tried to make a beer similar to a recipe from two hundred years ago and good. I am sure back then it was the greatest thing ever but this recipe could use an update."
"D-Quite drinkable, though it would be a hefty session beer."
"I liked this beer and could drink it all night but only if an elite Marzen wasn't available.."
"Bomber poured into a pint glass. This is a light caramel amber color.. fizzy with light head. Smell is rich caramel malts, graham cracker, and brown sugar. Taste is sweet with more brown sugar, caramel, and grain. Hops are very minimal. Alcohol presence is very low. This is a very drinkable and sweet oktoberfest."
"D: Easily drinkable. Nice representation of the style."
"D- One of the best Marzens I've had as of yet. Truly enjoyable, and I wouldn't mind drinking a few of these at a bar some night."
"Certainly if 3F ever wanted to make something for the masses then dropping this into cans would surely sell out, but if you're looking for their monthly edition of crazy in a bottle wait until November."
"This has some wine-like quality for some reason. Carbonation is a little much for me and would like to see more body. I think they were going for high drinkability and missed."
"Color is mahogany and a bit on the orange side. Smell is woody and citris with a bit of a banana tone. A bit sweet upfront with a certain tartness following it. Kind of mellows out with the sweetness lingering a bit but there is very little aftertaste. Mouthfeel is creamy and nicely carbonated. Not overly aggressive. Very easy drinking beer and my first Marzen! I like it. Reminds me of a Hefeweizen if anything."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, lightly carbonated, with a beautifully light dryness from the alcohol. Nicely drinkable, but not exceptionally so."
"Drinkability is good, overall. Back off on the carbonation a little and boost the body to make it fuller, richer, and this is dead on and award worthy. As it is, it's good, but I've had other oktoberfest/marzen beers that are truer to style than this one."
"The mouthfeel is smooth and rolls off the tongue. It is a very drinkable beer that I can drink all day glass after glass."
"I can't help but notice written multiple times on the bottle is ""Es ist nicht normal"" directly translating into ""It is not normal"". I couldn't agree more Three Floyds. The beer pours a slightly cloudy orangish amber color with fleeting coarse bubbles. Everything but the cloudiness is typical to the style. The smell has the hints of malts and orange zest that is typical to the style, but I detect hints of banana and clove which I must say is unexpected for the style. The wheat aroma is also confusing, particularly why it is there. The taste comes on with an unreal smoothness but quickly punches you in the face with it's bitter undercurrents. The bitterness almost seems to come from a roasted malt flavor rather than the expected bitterness from hops. The mouthfeel takes some getting used to, smooth and bitter is a not often seen combo. The drinkability is fairly easy to handle and overall it's not bad, worth a try if you can get it for the right price and are a connoisseur of the style I say have at it. It's a different approach to the style."
"It goes without saying that this is a highly drinkable and enjoyable beer but the fruits, sweet caramel, and gravity gives this beer something that's definately ""Not Normal"" in traditional Oktoberfest beers."
"alcohol isn't high so and it's not a full bodied beer so it goes down with ease. I think i would prefer to have this on tap next time however."
"Down it goes and goes down with ease! A solid O-fest and no real surprise from 3F that they can actually make a beer to a specific style that its suppose to be."
"Drinkability -- While I enjoyed this beer, it's not my favorite of the style. I might have it again, but only for lack of better options."
"Poured a bottle from 2009 into a Guinness pint glass. It poured smoothly and a pumpkin pie burnt orange. It had a light cream colored head which dissipated within a minute. The smell isn't anything too special. It's definitely malty and has a light coffee, spicy aroma to it. The taste definitely makes up for the lack of aromas. It's a little sweet and definitely has that fall-time flavor. It's a little spicy and appealingly so. It makes me wish it were autumn already. The mouthfeel is light and smooth. The age on the bottle definitely killed the carbonation but gave it the mouthfeel similar to an aged DFH 750ml. This beer may now be one of my top three Oktoberfests. It's extremely drinkable and both tasty and thirst quenching. If only it were on tap...."
"The beer pours a light orange color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of toffee and bready malts. The flavor is more complex with bread, caramel, toffee and grapes mixing together. Low bitterness from the hops. The beer tastes very clean. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D: I thought it was a good lager that did the style some justice and really ever dissapointed on FFF offerings. I'm not big on lagers but this one makes the cut."
"I'm no aficionado of the style but I'm not digging this example very much."
"The taste has some Oktoberfest characteristics but overall it isn't an impressive representation of the style. It, like other American takes on German styles has sort of a ""cat urine"" flavor, I tasted the same thing in Prima Pils, I think it is the misuse of noble hops."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a golden/orange color with a pretty small head. Head retention is low, and not much lacing either. Aroma is light, but nice. It smells like bready malt, toffee, and some caramel. This brew tastes just like the aroma, malty and sweet. Good thing the taste is stronger compared to the aroma. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's slick but the carbonation is a bit low. Drinkability is decent, it's not hard to drink at all. I realize that this bottle isn't exactly fresh, so I'll have to try this again in the future when a fresher batch comes out."
"Mouthfeel was full and smooth, slick even. Could use a little more carbonation it seems."
"D - Definitely one of the best American Oktoberfests I've come across."
"(d) I would like to see a higher abv% on this one, but then again it wouldnt be a traditional marzen...but then again FFF isnt a traditional brewery. Whats nice about this brew is that unlike other fests, I doubt it gets dumbed down every year. I will look forard to this one on draft this fall. (4/5)"
"D: Drinkable, not too heavy on the alcohol."
"Drinks well here-a bit out of season but definitely refreshing."
"drinkabiity is good - a heavy lager that would be better if lighter"
"D: Drinkability is average at best, this beer is just too bland. This beer is not even close to being worth $8 a bomber."
"Mouthfeel is light and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is pretty good, it was pretty easy to finish the bomber during the beginning of the Super Bowl this evening. It's lighter bodied and full flavored making it a very drinkable brew. I found it a pretty good representation of the style."
"Bottle: Poured a dirty golden color ale with a tiny foamy head with light retention and not much lacing. Aroma of overly sweet malt with some grainy cereal cereal is more or less interesting. Taste is also dominated by some grainy cereal with some overly sweet notes. Body has an oily texture with medium carbonation. Not sure I get what the goal was but I didn't enjoy this - lacking caramel malt."
"Notes: at $8 for a 22 oz. bottle, I find this to be ridiculously overpriced for an Oktoberfest brew."
"Pours a cloudy iced tea orange with a shallow loose off white head that's gone in a flash leaving negligible lacing. The smell is aggressive with a rich malty sweetness mixed with toffee apple notes. Adequately carbonated and tangy the mouth feel is full bodied and creamy. Full flavored, the malty caramel and harvest fruit taste is complimented nicely by the texture and lingers appropriately with a slightly salty character. One heck of a nice drinker. Tastes like a TON of quality ingredients. Quite sessionable, especially at 6% ABV. Really glad that i had the opportunity to consider this one...during the game...BEAT ARMY!"
"Hazy deep golden. Thin dirty white head. Barely any lace. Malty aroma but not overly rich or thick. A little apple fruitiness as well on the nose. Pretty plain flavor. Just like the nose. It's malty, but not overly so. And there is definitely an apple like presence which is a little awkward. Body is pretty lifeless. Easily, the most unimpressive beer I've had from this brewery. I coulda had a sixer of Staghorn instead of this bomber. It is what it is..."
"Tastes a lot like it smells only the hops are a lot bigger and the cinnamon much bolder, almost at Spotted Cow levels. Starts for a marzen, big bouquet of spices and light flowers, moving into sweeter, bockier middle with dry American hops and ending on a long, lingering blend of hops, spice, and malt sweetness. Really nice."
"Overall a very nice fest beer. Per the usual recipe at three floyds a fest beer with some muscle."
"Drinkability: A tasty Oktoberfest, and another fine offering from FFF."
"D - Very drinkable beer - abv is manageable. Flavors are solid and not overwhelming. Not filling, although certainly a noticeable body to it."
"Conclusion: I was really looking forward to this (it's my first FFF beer) but I must say, while this is in no way bad, it was just underwhelming and not really worth the $8.00 a bomber IMHO."
"The mouthfeel is liight, not very drinkable."
"D: I'm enjoying this one. I don't typically like many of the lager styles, but the Octoberfest beers are usually the exception and tis that time of year. The Munsterfest is not disappointing me. I only wish I had a giant pretzel or a bratwurst to go with it!"
"The smell puts its bready malt foot forward with just a little bit of lemon peel and banana in the background. The taste follows suit, with a satisfying biscuit lead-in, a subtle taste of citrus in the middle and a measured bitter finish. While I'd love to see FFF take this style off the deep end, this beer shows that they can succeed at a more subtle task."
"a pretty decent fest bier. ayinger is STILL the best but this is actually a bit close to it in that its balanced. good stuff"
"650mL bomber purchased FRESH from Friar Tucks in Peoria. The beer is hazy-translucent and dark orange color with an extremely thin wispy head. The aroma is sweet and malty, lots of fresh bread and I guess a hint of esters. This stuff is delicious, I think I've found my favorite Oktoberfest. Sweet and bready, a little grassland hops, pleasant overall. This is what Oktoberfests should taste like, definitive and near perfect."
"horray for munster"
"Nicely crafted, went down easily on a hot summer day."
"Overall a flawed beer that has good things going for it, but needs more attention from the brewers if they make it again next fall season. I have enjoyed most of their lagers, and this one just needs a bit of improvement. The deep malt flavor almost saves it."
"Pours a very nice semi-dark copper color, although with just a bit of initial head and no lacing to speak of. Deep malt aroma with a slight pepper nose and a bit of hoppiness. Nice deep malty scent, hints of pepper and clove (like a German wheat beer), and a good malt-hop finish. Goes down fine, if not the smoothest. A nice marzen, but not the best, and not 3F's best brew, either. Still, definitely good enough to drink if you're in the mood for an Oktoberfest."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easy, not too filling, good kick, nice representation of style, this is a very good beer to drink for a whole evening."
"The aroma is definitely not normal with corn, caramel, grassy hops, and fruit. The appearance is amber with an average head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is a bit thin but not too bad. Overall it's not great but it is interesting. I would have another."
"Overall, very drinkable. Was hoping for a little more from FFF, but it's still a very legit brew. Could be a little darker and more bitter, then I would have been totally satisfied."
"Copper color with no head and little life on the carbonation side. Very bland looking beer that dosn't get you too exicited. Smell kicks it up a notch. Toasty malts with some caramel and a little more hops that is normal for the style. Hops are earthy in nature. Taste is mostly sweet malts on the toasty/bready side of things. Clean, crisp finish. A real interesting departure for Three Floyds. Overall a nice brew that I'm glad i had a chance to try."
"A very easy to drink Oktoberfest beer from Three Floyds."
"D: This is definitely one of FFF's most approachable beers, refreshing and clean. I wish I had another bottle to enjoy."
"d: a heavy o'fest, still a well drinking beer"
"Drinkability suffers form the sweetness. Really builds the more you drink."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The body of the beer is medium. The carbonation works well with the beer to produce a slick feel. The beer was easy to drink and was what a beer geek would expect from FFF."
"Poured a slightly hazed copper into my SA beer drinking glass. Nice 1 finger of fluffy near-white head. Sweetness detected on the aroma with some nuts thrown in. Sweet, toasted malt flavor with some caramel. Crisp in the body, somewhat nutty, with a balanced hop bitterness. Hoppier than most of it's German relatives. Spicy hop finish and pretty good overall."
"D: Easy to drink but not tasty or interesting enough to want to."
"D- A little sweet for my tastes. Definitely doesn't blow my doors off, but it gets the job done."
"A nice version of a favorite style of mine."
"Flavor starts off light and crisp, with a spicy bite hitting the sides of the tongue. Notes of light, peppery hops drop out of the middle, before the profile culminates in a finish of amber malt, nuts, spice, and some zesty yeastiness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and the medium-high carbonation level adds an invigorating feel to the beer that gives some pep to the more subtle spices. Overall, an excellent beer for the Oktoberfest style (not one of my favorite styles, but it's growing on me). What else do you expect from Three Floyd's?"
"D- Very easy to drink and very enjoyable. Very solid brew."
"Thanks, kirok1999, for the opportunity"
"Drinkability - a worthy OFest to enjoy the ALCS Games 7 with. Great season BoSox, good luck Rays. Tasty beer, a close ballgame, life is good! Thanks to OHLRangers for providing this bomber courtesy of the LIF route, a process that is soon to appear in a city near you (provided you're lucky enough)..."
"D - goes down easy and it isn't too filling."
"Highly sessionable and one of the best I have had this season."
"drinkability: high"
"D= Very drinkable, probably the best fest bier I have had this year. Highly sessionable!"
"One of the better American versions of the Oktoberfest. I really enjoyed this one. Plus at only 5.59 it's probably the cheapest FFF bomber I've ever bought."
"Caramel flavors, malty, not much hop presence. Finishes kind of dry. Something in there reminds me of fall leaves. Light bodied, easy enough to quaff a pint. Not especially complex, but a nice way to usher in the fall season."
"Overall I thought this was a very solid choice for sure. It was not as complex as most FFF brews tend to be, but in this case that is absolutely fine. A good, quality, session able beer the this time of year. I would have no issues with getting this one again."
"D: Just so so."
"D: Fairly easy to drink but i'd like to try this fresh"
"Pours a clear, dark amber color with a short lasting half inch of off-white head. Aromas are mostly Munich and Vienna malts, toasty and bready, not really any biscuit. Quite a bit of noble hop notes including some floral and slightly spicy tones. Just a hint of caramel. On the palate, it hits incredibly smooth. The bready, caramel like malt character really dominates with just a touch of hop bitterness for balance. A very clean lager with a hint of diacetyl, no fruitiness. Very smooth and easy drinking. Nice to find an Oktoberfest this time of year (regardless of how old this bottle is)."
"Afterthought - I'm pretty sure that this bottle is a bit old and out of date, considering the low carbonation and lack of head. Oh, that and the fact that I'm reviewing an Oktoberfest beer in January. I have taken this into account in my ratings."
"A deep amber color with a small white head that forms, that quickly dissolves away. Th carbonation is strongly visible through the from top to bottom. The sweet scent of malt dominates the aroma, with touches of a light citrus fragrance at the end. The malt is the strength of the flavor, it solid all the way through. There is not much hop bitterness, a light citrus flavor at the end, but nothing to dominant, a surprise from Three Floyds. This is a very easy to drink beer, the carbonation does not deter from this very smooth medium bodied feel. I like this beer, though I am partial to Marzen, I was expecting somewhat of a hop kick, being from Three Floyds. That takes nothing away from this very good beer."
"Mouthfeel was fine, could have used a bit more carbonation and the alcohol was too strong for the style. Still, a quality beer. Not worth the money to me, though."
"Drinkability- Hmmm This isnt what Ive come to expect from FFF. This is a very balanced, normal brew that is right on for the style. Its a terrific Oktoberfest that isnt really a crazy American interpretation. Great job by FFF. Solid beer, great brewery. Much thanks to TheodorHerzl!"
"Taster's Note: *Thanks to amatuerbeerguy for this one!"
"Tastes pretty nice but not what I expected for a Marzen. It has more pilsner notes. There's some nice hops, fruit, grass, wheat, and the brew is well carbonated. Feels slick and slightly creamy and is pretty easy to down on a chilly fall night."
"This goes down smooth, with more toasted malts balanced by a nice bit of hops for an Oktoberfest. It isn't what I think of when I think Three Floyds, but that's ok -- much like the Prize Ale, they've again shown their talent with sublime subtle brews. They don't all have to have Alpha King's super-charged flavor. I like this. It's superbly drinkable and doesn't fizzle on the palate, either. Well done."
"Bomber pours a mostly clear, radiant orange body with a small and fleeting beige head. Sticky fleck lacing on the glass. Aroma of toasted grain, caramel, and spicy/herbal hops. Light medium body, good carbonation, and a slightly creamy mouthfeel. Taste is well balanced, with a toasty, nutty, and caramel maltiness that is complimented by a subtle spicy hop bitterness. Very well constructed lager that rivals some of the better German examples of the style."
"D - Worth $9? Not quite, but still good, and made for an enjoyable night."
" Beer pours near bronze with little to no head which dissipates immediately. The beer has a sweet smell that is soon overpowered by alcohol and corn, unpleasant. The corn taste dominates and sits in the back of your mouth. Tastes like a roided' out Budvar. I have so much faith in FFF but I will not be having another. Taking into consideration where I purchased this from it should be very fresh."
"Poured from a bomber into a stein. Liquid was amber with a white head. Aroma was of roasted malt, slightly sweet and minimal hops. Taste begins with sweet malt that fades to a dry (style-like) finish. Lacked the hops I was expecting from FFF. Very drinkable, like and o'fest should be."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with ample carbonation. Goes down easy with a nice dry crispness on the finish. Quite an easy drinking oktoberfest. It doesn't really set itself apart from others in the style very much, but overall is a tasty, enjoyable oktoberfest that lives up to the style. As one of the Floyd's few bottled lagers, it's one I'd probably come back to again."
"Im so glad that orbitalr0x sent you my way in a good trade!"
"amusing label on this bomber. poured into a nonic, this was a hazy apricot/amber in color with a thin, off-white creamy head that dissipated rather quickly. but, for me, the head is one of the least important characteristics of a beer. smell of sweet caramel malts is prevelant before your nose gets near the glass. some faint vegetal notes are also detected upon further inspection. the taste and mouthfeel both present some interesting contrasts, as it starts out sweet and medium-bodied/viscous and quickly cleans out to dry, light, and spritzy. this may be the only 3f's beer i've ever had where the hops did not assume a prominent role. in this one, they only play to a light bitterness in the background and the aformentioned vegetal notes in the nose. i give this one high marks for it's complex mouthfeel and cleansing finish, it makes for a beer you'd want to drink a lot of. it should be noted that i'm pretty sure they make this for a fall release, and having bought it in june (they just put these out in a new section at the local binny's), i'm pretty sure this is past it's prime. but it was good nonetheless and did not seem light-struck. will definitely revisit this if a fresh batch is re-released this coming fall. not the clean malt profile of an ayinger oktoberfest but still tasty."
"This is a spot-on great Maerzen. Come fall, I will be (no doubt) shelling out way too much money for this overpriced bomber."
"Pours a cloudy amber with a two finger off white head. Decent retention and lacing. Aroma is roasty carmel malts. Taste is dissapointing, very malty with a little too much sweetness and not enough hops. Mouthfeel is average. Pretty drinkable but not something I would want to drink a lot of. I am hoping this was just an old bottle; I will get some fresh as soon as it's available."
"Overall a tasty oktoberfest. Very drinkable."
" Prosit und Zum Wohl, MK"
"A great brew in the style from one of the best."
"Slàinte!"
"this is another great offering from the FFF brewery - Try it if you can find it!"
"May be a bit past it's prime, so I will try again in the future. Easy to drink, but flavor is just a bit off."
"All and all - a solid lager. Had a nice tast profile, but yet very quaffable. Quite enjoyable."
"Three Floyds is proud of the 'it's not normal' nature of their beer (as they should be). For this German-style offering, they've amended their tagline to read 'es ist nicht normal'. Munsterfest is probably the most normal thing they brew, but it's still a damn fine example of the style and shows that these guys aren't just hop fanatics. What this beer has shown me is that 3F can be successful at whatever they set their minds to."
"Overall a good beer, just not something that demands the FFF premium."
"Finally gave in and grabbed a Munsterfest off the shelf of the liquor store in town. The beer poured out of the 22 oz. bottle to a hazy orangish brown in my mug. Decent carbonation, but little head retention. Sweet earthy malt smell. Nothing that over powers though. Taste is the same with a bit of bitter hops in there. The hop bite starts and the sweet malt finishes as I swallow, which I enjoyed. Feels a bit thick and chewy, not over bearing in those regards. I put this on the same drinkability as Sam Adams Octoberfest. I could polish of a few bombers if I so desired."
"A very simple American oktoberfest. A bit more of a hop bitterness than normal, but overall a very nice simple drinkable marzen."
"Poured from a 22oz bomber. Poured a dark amber with a short fluffy white head that disappears very quickly. Smells of lager yeast, honey, and apricots as well as light malt. The taste is a little dissappointing. It is more reminiscent of an imperial pilsner or craft malt liquor than it is an Oktoberfest. Its very malty, very little hops in the front, fairly sweet in the middle as well as some apricot. The mouthfeel is nice and full and creamy, and very smooth. Very restrained carbonation. Not a bad beer, just a little bit odd interpretation of the style."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a minimal layer of beige bubbles over the cloudy dark amber brew. Head is down to a swirly film quickly, with average to good lacing. Aroma is lightly of nutty malt and fruitiness. Taste follows along with a nutty grain husk flavor upfront, and hopping to balance for the rest of the experience, with maybe a touch of fruitiness. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both very nice, and even if they say it's ""not normal", I'd be happy with this as my fest beverage..."
"Clear orange/reddish amber, but still fairly light, topped by an off-white head of fine bubbles. Some spotty lace. Sweet malt aroma with grassy and floral notes. Mild bitterness with some caramel, mild toastiness and light floral hops. Moderate carbonation, medium/light body, quite smooth with some dryness in the finish. Quite easy drinking. Thanks for sharing Viggo!"
"As is the case with most well-done lagers, this beer is uber drinkable. I could drink it by the case if I could afford it and it was available."
"drinkability is good. a well balanced and tasty beer."
"Easy to drink as all Three Floyds beers are. This doesn't really taste like an Oktoberfest but it does taste good. Flavor-wise this would be a real good schwartzbier but it isn't dark enough. Tasty but not to style."
"Pours a clear orange, big off white head forms, settles down to a thin layer, some lace spots, decent retention. Smell is sweet and malty, some citrus, bread and yeast, bit of funk, smells okay. Taste is sweet and malty, yeast, orange/citrus, little bit of sourness and some zest, bit of jasmine, weak finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, very smooth. Never thought I'd see an Oktoberfest from 3F. Not bad, not up to their quality, but a decent brew."
"D - A tasty Oktoberfest. I was expecting something a little bolder coming from 3 Floyd's."
"Overall this is a decent Oktoberfest, not what I expected from 3F's. Yet still a nice beer to partake in."
"D: This is a very drinkable Oktoberfest. Not my favorite style but I could see myself drinking a lot of this. All the flavors meld very well. It's malty without being too sweet and there's just enough hops to keep the malt in line. If only FFF would do a dry-hopped version of this!"
"Pors that simple yet clear grainy amber that is spot on with the real deal oktoberfest beers. Thick yet snappy head that leaves a small foam throughout the whole mug of beer (22oz). Smell of some syrupy straight up malty sweetness. Authentic. The taste is like sweeter pretzel bread fresh from the oven. Leaves a little aftertaste. Goiod on the drinkability for its clear sweetness, but tastes a little like runny syrup."
"D- This beer has good malt depth with a very nice balance of malt and hops. I think this is the first Oktoberfest beer that I could drink by the liter and not get tired of drinking. Of course, I have never been to O-fest in German. With the soft malt and hops I will have to find this on cask and I think it must be consumed fresh."
"Interesting new brew. Pours a clear copper red/brown with a big off-white head. Excellent lacing. Nose is mildly hoppy with a good bit of spiciness comign through. Nice. Taste is mild sweet grains and lingering sweet hops. Not a real strong flavor, but well done. Mouthfeel is above average, and drinkability is high."
"22 oz bomber. The beer is a golden orange color with a very small and patchy head. Clarity is poor and there is a moderate carbonation apparent. The aroma of the brew is mildly doughy, with a sugary caramel sweetness. A little bland to my nose. The flavor is very bready, with a peppery noble hop spiceyness, with a mild caramel sweetness. As it warms a little, there are some more toasty notes along with a mild graineyness as well. That definately makes it start to work more for me. It finishes with a mild but pleasant bitterness. The flavor is also a little distant as well. Mouthfeel is moderate with a light to moderate carbonation. It sits nicely on my palate. This one is nice and easy drinking. I think that this one is definitely better as it comes towards cool in temperature. The grainy and toasty notes seem to come to life after it warms. This is a nice brew. Definitely a drinkable one."
"Drinkability - this is good, but not great. Could be sessionable."
"D- It is really good! I think it tastes amazing. It's a new blend of flavor which follows Three Floyds. I don't know how they do it but they keep making a total new blend of flavors and it keeps coming out amazing."
"Saw this on the ""new bottles"" menu at the Map Room and i got it despite the price because i'd never seen it before (later i saw it at Sam's too). poured red with a bit of brown and translucent...massive white head. crisp, lightly malty and all-spice odor. some sour apples on the nose too. taste is very smooth, nicely hoppy. some slight apple and cinnamon tastes, small amount of hops. It's a very nice lager...not really an octoberfest but i always keep in mind that ""it's not normal"". High marks for this guy overall...reminds me a bit of Brooklyn Lager with less hops, which is weird because it's not at all the same style. highly drinkable and very refreshing. way to go map room."
"This one was hard to review  lots of things going on with it. I was expecting a rich Oktoberfest beer, but drinking it was completely different. I recommend trying it (if you can get it!)...."
"Tasted at the brewery on tap."
