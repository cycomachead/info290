Nonetheless, Blue Point has made an honorable effort that, while it doesn't quite rank on par, is a nice ode to the more traditional, original versions of Oktoberfest beers. But it's certainly nothing to celebrate about.","biegaman","Nov 15, 2014"

This settled fairly quickly into two-plus fingers of dense, rocky, tawny head with good retention. Color was solid-gold (SRM = > 5, < 7) with NE-quality clarity and of course Mammon, Croesus and Midas showed up, clamoring for a taste. I watched, bemused, as the head fell, leaving behind sticky lacing in its wake and I was thinking about some gelt for me. Nose was very biscuit-like, quite malty, but not overly sweet. Mouthfeel was medium with a pleasant amount of carbonation on the tongue. The flavor was both biscuity and grassy, a nice combination of malts and hops that proved to be eminently drinkable. The finish evinced a slight honey-like sweetness, something often found in the quality lagers, but overall, I would still classify it as semi-dry.","woodychandler","May 26, 2014"

Taste of caramel, pear, apple, toast, biscuit, grass, herbal, and light spiciness. Lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, toast, biscuit, and herbal on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of all flavors with no cloying sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice.

Poured golden yellow with a two finger bone white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, brown sugar, nutmeg, and slight spices. The flavor was of sweet malt, pumpkin, spices, and nutmeg. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. It was however not a favorite of mine from the style. The flavor was pretty good, but the aroma was lacking big time. This one could have used a little more spice to bump it up a notch.

Thin, with medium carbonation. Not very good.","CuriousMonk","Jan 19, 2011"
3.78,7.4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4," The flavor is good, nice malt which has a slightly honey-like fruitiness and mellow spice from the hop in the background. I enjoy the mellow caramel presence from the malt, but toastiness is mild and hops could be more forward. I like the yeast's role in this which is mild, yet it could use a little more character. I think it is pretty easy to drink and still represents the style ok -a refreshing lager without a whole lot of German yeast character or hops, but still very drinkable and no major flaws to speak of.","Slatetank","Dec 21, 2010"
2.71,-23,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Pours a clear light amber color with a finger of head. Aroma is clove, nail polish, grass, and wheat.

Seems to be contracted in Rochester at High Falls, seems like a trend for alot of crafts out there. Very nice spicy hop nose present, a touch of caramel drizzled on a biscuit cracker with nice lively citrus and grassy hops kickin'. A stong mineral water characteristic creeps throughout the entire drinking experience. Flavors is a bit dull in malt presence, a quick touch of caramel and biscuit that disappear quick and are replaced by a carbonated watery graininess. Not as much hop action as the nose was entailing, maybe a bit of lingering spicy hop edge in a burp or two but that's about it. Mouthfeel is pretty lackluster light to medium bodied with odd carbonation much a metallic mineral water edge with sweetness with a touch of rust and spicy herbal hop finish. Drinkability overall is decent not a beer I'd pick to win the race but one that I know will finish effortlessly, not the best craft fal seasonal out there worth a shot for sure.","WVbeergeek","Beers"

Smooth and sweet with a good balance and a crisp finish. A pretty good Oktoberfest, easy to drink, assumingly sessionable. Worth picking up again.","HopDerek","Oct 12, 2008"
3.03,-13.9,3.5,3,3,3,3,"pours a verry light orange yellow color with a 2 finger white head on top that was afraide to stay to long. the smell was musty malt and corn and the taste is just that starting a bit sour and the finsh is one of big malt with practly no hop present at all, this one is a big disapointment to me as their hoptacal illushion is one of my favriot beers in my state. i think that thay should go back to the drawing bord on this one","orcasteve","Oct 02, 2008"
3.78,7.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"this is a good local oktoberfest. The color is a dark golden color. The aroma is malty, with not much else. It is a little on the sweeter side with little to no hop presence. It has a nice light mouthfeel for an oktoberfest with good,lively carbonation. This is a highly drinkable beer for an oktoberfest.","NoahSYGG","Oct 01, 2008"
3.08,-12.5,3.5,3,3,2.5,3.5,"Right off the bat, this reminds of Hacker-Pschorr's O'fest for with smooth, yet lightly roasted caramel and hint of hops in the finish. Unfortunately, there are two flaws that really detract from an otherwise tasty marzen. At first I'm getting a metallic tang in the flavor and then diacetyl in the aroma. What a shame.","tempest","Sep 28, 2008"
3.36,-4.5,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a vibrant, clear orange brown color with a small white head and slow rising carbonation. Sugary sweet malts on the nose, very floral and spicy, cinnamon, roasted nuts, woody and grainy. Caramel malt is dominant with a subtle hop scratch and a slight alcohol note. Not uber complex, sticky medium bodied but definitely drinkable. Good beer.","ATPete","Sep 28, 2008"

3.62,2.8,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"There's a slight touch of odd astingency, though that may have been from carbonation, making it not quite as smooth as I would have liked it, and there is a slight thinness, but, overall, it's a fine O-fest with a nice sweet/bitterish balance.","jwc215","Sep 28, 2008"

3.97,12.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"This beer pours a light amber (lighter than other Oktoberfests) with a 2 fingered head and nice lacing. The smell is nice of sweet malts and spices. The taste is very nicely balanced with the sweet malts and the hops aftertaste. The main flavor I get is oktoberfest, sorry nothing else really comes to mind. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy with a nice carbonation level. I could see myself utting 3-4 of these back with no problem. All around a nice brew!","Biggness","Sep 21, 2008"
3.78,7.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability is excellent. Not an overly complicated brew, just delicious and easy drinking. I can easily see this as a fall session staple. Will pair beautifully with traditional German food as well a just about anything from popcorn to football food like hot dogs and such. Good stuff to have on hand.","scootny","Sep 19, 2008"
3.65,3.7,3,3,4,3.5,4,"Notes:Not much to say on this one because it was dominated by the ""butter"". I can not say it was bad,but a tad bit below average.","Lexluthor33","Sep 19, 2008"
3.35,-4.8,3.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Pours a clear copper color with an average white head that dissipates into a slight ring. The aroma is of buttery caramel malt, little rust, and a small hop spice. The taste is of sweet caramel malt, quite buttery, some honey, not much in the way of hops. Reminds me of a more malty version of their toasted lager. The buttery taste seems out of place for an Oktoberfest. The feel is moderate, slightly chewy, well carbonated, finishes with a malty sweetness. Not a bad beer but I have had better Oktoberfests. This one seems to miss the mark with the buttery flavor.","Gmann","Sep 19, 2008"
4.2,19.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Flavor is a little more tart than the smell. More yeasty tartness, malts, a citric-lemonlike bite, more on the carbonationed side. I like the bite of this beer, as many American brewers seem to lean on the sweet side for thier oktoberfest biers, this one stays biting, lighter an highly drinkable.","czfreeman","Beers"

4.3,22.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A pre-release sample at Bellport Beer from one of the Blue Point brewmaster assistants. We poured the bottle into tasting glasses and noted the orange/gold tone to it as it came up with a sudsy head resembling milk froth. The subtle aroma of wheat and mild spices came to mind, but the first taste to follow was flowing with blond malts. I had to stop for a moment as the aftertaste was revealing most of the ornate elements. I couldn't reflect off of a beer judge to describe what I was tasting, but the base reminded me a delicious hefeweizen. I was sorry we only had two bottles, but I made mental note to buy a case of this upon its release this weekend. It was very easy to drink with nuances of the traditional Oktoberfest flavor to it.","bonbright7","Oct 05, 2006"
3.65,3.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Don't get me wrong, its a good beer, but it wasn't what I want out of an Octoberfest. I will give it another chance, though, if I see it somewhere else.","Amalak","Sep 10, 2006"
3.93,11.6,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Nice deep amber color with nice rich head. Very smooth although a little on the light side for a marzen.

3.88,10.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"On draft, pour a clear dark honey amber, with a moderate tan head. Leaving minor lacing. Nosa is sweet malt. Decent octobetfest, moderate sweetness, smooth and tasty. Lingering maltyness on the palate. Not the most exciting of styles in my book, but this one is pleasant and drinkable. Always good to support NY state. More respectable brew from BP.","Billolick","Oct 07, 2003"
3.15,-10.5,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,"eh. that's pretty much the best word i can think of to describe blue point's oktoberfest. actually, if i didn't watch the bartender pour this one from the tap, i could have easily mistaken this for their toasted lager. it pours an amber colour with hardly any head to speak of and has a malty, bready smell to it, with hints of citrus. there was also a bit of staleness present in the smell, which is strange considering the bartender shared with me that it was just received and tapped that day. this one tastes average at best, and seemed a bit watery at times. not horrible, but maybe my least favourite o'fest this season. i'd try any other fest brews on hand before sampling this one, but at the same time can't say that i'd never sample it again. overall, average but uninspired.","SixpointJMH","Beers"
