4.25,10.1,,,,,,"Overall the sum is greater than that of the parts.  It doesn't look particularly beautiful or smell enticing but it's a very smooth, balanced, malty beer that fits in between a Helles and a Dunkel, as I think it should.  There is nothing particularly interesting about the flavors either, but also nothing offensive.  In some respects I think a good, drinkable beer should not be over the top - this one won't knock your socks off but when you finish your glass you'll most likely be wanting more.  That's probably a good mark of a festbier.","MikeKnauf","Sep 20, 2014"

Aroma of bready malt with light biscuit, light grassy hops and caramel. Flavor is bready caramel malt with hints of biscuit, slight dark dried fruit and a mild, grassy hop finish. Medium bodied. Classic marzen style with a deft balance between dryness in the malt and a light sweetness overall. Flavorful caramel and biscuit malt. Enjoyable.","LiquidAmber","Aug 31, 2014"

Aromas of caramel, pear, apple, toast, bread, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of malt and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, apple, pear, toast, herbal, bread, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, toast, bread, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice and clean balance of malt and yeast ester flavors; with nice robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Oktoberfest style. All around clean and well balanced malt and yeast flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 10, 2013"

3.76,-2.6,4,3,4,4,4,"Paulaner's Oktoberfest pours a brilliently clear copper, with a decent amount of orange highlights. Roughly a finger of soapy white foam comes together atop the beer, leaving a little bit each of head retention and lacing in its wake. The nose is definitely a bit dull. I know this style isn't necessarily supposed to have the most bombastic aroma, but it really is barely there. There are some light toasted bready notes, as well as just a hint of herbal noble hops. The flavor profile, while following the nose step for step, is easily more potent. A deceptively deep maltiness leads off, very biscuity in nature. The hops are again playing a secondary note, with an earthy, herbal quality present against the dominant malty character. The mouthfeel is fairly full bodied, with just a little bit of carbonation cutting through. Paulaner Oktoberfest is a really nice well, and holds up better than some of the other German imports I've had.","axeman9182","Nov 02, 2012"

4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a very light amber, bordering on dehydrated piss coloring with a lovely finger width head of soapy white bubbles that stick around. The color actually reminds me of changing leaf colors which is a nice nod to the season. Lacing is light and cloudy, with just a few dots and lines edging up the glass. The body is clear and full of a torrent of bubbles that are racing to the surface. The beer smells surprisingly spicy with yeast that has an almost spicy hot tingling in the nose. Touches of bread and sweet toasted malts are clearly present, with a nice side showing of earthy hops reminiscent of decaying leaves. The beer tastes sweet and caramelly with a big rush of decaying leaves in the middle of the taste which wonderfully offsets the sweet malt. The beer begins as sweet toasted caramel malts before it opens into the hops earthy-leafy flavor in the middle of the taste. The sweet malts transition back in at the end of the taste and into the aftertaste, along with the spicy yeast notes and a touch of bready malt. Mouthfeel is clean and just a smidge to thick for the style, leaving the tongue clean but for a touch of saliva, and the rest of the mouth slightly dry with sweet lingering. Overall, I have to say that this is my favorite of the German Märzens I have sampled. It is much more complex in flavoring than the others, with some wonderful yeast spices. Unfortunately, this also makes the beer a little too thick to continuously slug back, though I don’t really see that as a huge problem as I could still drink quite a few of these in the course of a day. Good beer, worth a try and a retry. Prosit!","Maxwell","Oct 17, 2012"

Appearance almost a 5 - clear, lovely foamy head, but of course the Marzen style has little hop aroma so no extra marks for smell. The taste was delightfully balanced, good depth of malt but not overpowering in the slightest. Overall, another total gem from 'Phil and Ted's World Tour of Bavaria'. Do not underestimate the experience of tasting the beer at source.","beerman_60","Oct 17, 2012"

Some lacing is left behind as the head dissipates. There are aromas of bready malt and grassy and floral hops. The taste follows the nose. It's very bready. The hop bitterness is not strong, but it does lend some nice balance to the flavor. The body is light with adequate carbonation. The finish is smooth and dry. The drinkability is high. Overall, this is an excellent example of this style. Definitely give it a try.","acevenom","Jun 16, 2012"

I exaggerate, but the cans on display were more-than-generous; more apt to be footstools or pieces of a makeshift barrier than a beer serving size. Still,　splitting one of these azure monoliths with a friend didn't seem too greedy. Orange and frothy, this looks like a festival beer - good for celebrating outdoors where heady rays of sunshine and noise from adjacent crowds make good complements to the otherwise simple notes of honey paired with the crispness of pilsner malt and sharp carbonation. Unengaging, the Pauler Marzen is best left to being a session beer, or served with powerful dishes, or to slake undiscriminating thirsts. It deserves a glass boot more than a chaise.","GarrettB","Feb 03, 2012"

Clear amber orange to brown in color, lightens to a yellowish orange at the glass bottom, only a trace of bubbles visible. While there’s a decent core of malted milk balls, caramel and molasses to the nose there’s also a surprising amount of herbaceous notes and raw grains, at times gives it as much of a pretzel dough as bread character, offers more lemon zest than mix of peach, apple, pear fruit scents. Medium-bodied, zesty and refreshing mouth feel with that herbal side paired with pepper and flowers, the lemon contributes to forestalling the arrival of the caramel, molasses, honey aspects. White raisin and fig supplement the peach, apple fruit here and helps sweeten the back half. Carbonation is somewhat weak, more tiny prickle than a real contributing presence.

This nuttiness and maltiness really helps this brew pop a bit. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly smooth feel.

There is really no bitterness but there is a weird astringency on the tongue after each sip. A good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.

It's only a shade darker than most of the pale lager styles, and there's really only the slightest hint of caramelized and toasty notes to differentiate it in terms of flavour and aroma.

Drinks well, and appropriate for the season.","aforbes10","Nov 04, 2008"

The beer is definitely tilted towards the crisp rather than the creamy end of the continuum, but there is a tad bit of creaminess on the tongue, for it isn't entirely crispy either. There is a slightly husky graininess, there is a herbal, tea like hop character, and the finish is a bit biting, but much milder than some other Octoberfests you will find. The key principle in this beer is balance. The parts are well balanced and more so than most other Marzens you will find, and that makes this one a cut above the pack.

A smooth, almost creamy medium-bodied beer that has a not overpowering sweet malt taste of caramel and mixes it with some spices in the background. Passes over pleasantly and has a little kick on the backend. Hops lead to a floral, semi-earthy taste but do not overpower the beer, only give it a dry backbite.

There's not a lot going on in the taste department, but it works just fine in this beer. Not everything has to be complex. It has a certain openness to it that is surrounded by a thin veil of hops.

Nice bubbling action in the tall slender Erdinger glass enhances the appearance of this beer. Smell was not really strong but I am picking up malts and light hints of fresh fruits and citrus. The taste starts off with slight sour note on the palates with a pleasing malt profile, subtle fruitiness and citrus also show up soon after. The taste was slightly bland though refreshing, like the Kristallweizens though I prefer this one slightly to the Kristals but of course not as much as the Hefeweizens of course. The finish was a little dry with a nice malty after taste where the wheat becomes more pronounced before a typically grapy, citrus conclusion; I am getting malt aromas on the nose as well throughout the after taste.

The mouthfeel is very nice and smooth with the drinkibility to last alll day....what it was brewed to do. The Paulaner version is very similar in appearance, with a slightly larger head, and also in aroma, but a slightly stronger smell.

First sip brings a crisp tingle to the tongue followed by a huge, caramel, biscuity, sweet middle. The hops are somewhat absent at mid-point, but they come through with a fairly long, dry, crispy finish. Body is just thinner than medium and spot-on for the style. The sweetness may get a bit much for me over an average session, but I can't complain as this pint disappears.

The taste of the beer is very malty, high toasted grain flavor with a little residual sweetness. The hop bitterness is low, but enough to provide a wonderful balance for the style. The carbonation is medium. The beer has a medium-light body with a very nice smoothness. Overall I really enjoyed this beer.

Rich, sweet, chewy malts are the centerpiece of the taste here, but they're expertly balanced with dusky, earthy hops that are perfectly bitter.

Pungeant candied hops and some lightly sweet malt in the aroma. It almost smells like they soaked noble hops in gasoline, it's intense. The flavor mimics the aroma, but is very light, almost airy. The hops dominate the malt, but it's all very subdued. Finishes with a sprinkle of table sugar mixed with pale malt. Don't get me wrong, this is no hoppy IPA, but for some reason the hops reallz stand out. The malt profile is a bit timid for the style, which is probably why the hops pop.

Maybe it's that US import mess? The one I had was straw yellow on the pale side. It poured with lots of bubbles and not so much foam. The smell was rich with bread, herbs and fruits mixing. The first taste was sweet, spicy and bitter with bread and citrus there as well.

It has a very malty, nutty, sweet smell. Just like whole grain oat bread with some brown sugar on top. Great smell really reminded me of what a great season autumn really is. The great color really makes for a beautiful presentation. Nice aromas of mild hops and some fruitiness. First taste was refreshing and clean. Nice mouthfeel with good malt sweetness upfront and a crisp hop finish. Well balanced and drinkable beer. There are some nice hints of caramel and some slight hints of faded yeast. Great start and finish to this one. The well rounded flavor of this beer makes it a winner in my book. I enjoy a good Oktoberfest and this one hits the nail on the head for style and presentation.

Pretty perfect as far as oktoberfests go, but the head eventually just fades out almost completely. Big aromas of nuts and bread up front with an herbal tea-like hop scent mingling along. Malty. Chewy nutty malt flavors are dominant here with a noble hop kick that all finishes kind of dry. Flavors seem to wash away a little thin here and there, but other than that, this tastes great. Mouthfeel is softly carbonated but with sufficient bite. Still has a creaminess to it. Could be a bit more full as it gets kind of watery. I could see sessioning this.","goochpunch","Sep 18, 2006"

Chewy bread and softly sweet caramel malts come through at the beginning of the taste and are followed up by muted, clean and grassy hops. There is also a noticeable mineral presence in the finish that lingers through as an aftertaste. Lightly silky-smooth mouthfeel; refreshing and satisfying.

While I haven't (yet) been to Munich for Oktoberfest, this Paulaner offering is exactly what I imagine it would taste like. This one was particularly fresh and sat a gorgeous dark amber in the glass, capped with a 1/4 inch delicate foam head. The nose was all carmel and malt; and I noted that it was rich and slightly sweet in the mouth. The taste is also quite carmel/malt, but I noted a very nice hops bitterness--even a mild tartness--in the aftertaste. Talk about complexity... it's like the taste changes from sip to swallow.

4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Surprised to see that I had never reviewed this beer. A frequent sampling at my local German Pub -- Marrikas. A staple malty, lager with big bready and fruity notes and evidence of nice maturity and age. The beer, appearing a hazy rust color and good retention throws up good fruity esters in the aroma. Aromas and flavors of ripe-to-bruised fruits of figs, dates, and prunes. Maybe an orange, apple, and pear thrown in. The fruit flavors begin to overtake the bready and yeasty flavors that are present. Light alcohols show sweetness throughout. Medium to heavy body for the style. Finishes sweet and fruity. Never dry. A good middle-of-the-road beer when you want good flavors, but not and intense beer.","BEERchitect","May 07, 2006"

Mouthfeel is medium , drinkability is good. I find this one more one dimensional and less drinkable every year though. I prefer the Hacker o-fest amongst other choice.

Nice amber/auburn color with a frothy head. Sweet malty aroma, almost like apples or even apple cider (subtle fruity and floral character to it). The sweet aroma leads one to believe that the beer will also be sweet. In this case though, the beer may be sweet, but not overly so, like some other Oktoberfests that I've tried. It balances well with next to no hoppy bitterness. Any hops in this beer are very well hidden. Crisp and clean mouthfeel without much of an overbearing aftertaste.

Very clean smelling and inviting. I know it is really not that fresh, but it doesn't come across that way in the taste. A nice husky and grainy malt profile with just the right amount of bitterness in the finish to keep it very drinkable. I'm looking forward to trying this one fresh this coming Oktoberfest season.

The nose is all malt with hints of candy and figs. The taste is sweet malt up front, and more of the candy overtones mid drink with a creamy light finish and mouth feel.

I like to close my eyes and think about it when I smell and taste this. It has a nice malty taste which has a sweet nutty taste that I bet goes really well with bratwurst or sourkraut, or any other german foods that I can't think of right now. The mouthfeel is almost a chewy thick coating to it. Very complex and very satisfying. I could drink gallons of this like I am sure I would if I were in Germany during Oktoberfest.

The malty body is creamy and sweet, with toffee and honey flavors. The hops have a lime-like bitterness and mild spiciness. Slightly astringent and some noticeable alcohol, which lasts throughout.

Aroma of the malt and the brewers art are in the nose, clean and fresh. Start is sweet, the middle light, the finish is fastidiously hopped, temperately acidic, the aftertaste dry and pleasant. A beer I look forward to every fall, as with several other ""Oktoberfest Marzen's.","Gusler","Oct 26, 2002"
4.57,18.4,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours with a nice white head on a copper body.  The aroma is fabulous, with sweet floral smells and a hint of spices reminiscent of nutmeg.  The head leaves a light lace on the glass.  The flavor is very rewarding.  Sweetness balanced wonderfully by hop bitterness.   This is my favorite O'fest by far.  It feels good from the time you take the first sip to till you finish the last drink, which could be sevral hours and several beers down the road.  Definitely need a case of this next year.  Finally an Oktoberfest beer that I don't feel the need to compromise flavor or aroma for drinkability.","aaronh","Oct 17, 2002"
4.48,16.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"this one goes in my personal top ten.  best o-fest.  clear dark amber....medium head and minimal lace. aroma to die for... munich malts....hints of spice...yum...hints of floral hop....tastes absolutely delicious, smooth velvety mouthfeel.  oh baby what a beer.  i'm not a huge fan of the marzen-oktoberfest style but this brew transcends all styles and should be respected as a classic.","budgood1","Oct 17, 2002"
4.37,13.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Great looking rich copper color. Foamy, rich, light tan head. Great rich bready smell, sweet toffee aromas also bounce around. Very very inviting pleasing smell. Taste is very balanced, yummy sweet carmel malt, everything that is expected. Nice hop bubbles yeild a super bitter bite in the middle, especially on bigger sips. Medium bodied, very drinkable. Great with hearty fall meals or as a treat alone. Very good for the style, a really good beer.","StevieW","Oct 17, 2002"
3.5,-9.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Nice color, sandy-looking head. Aroma is sweet malt and the flavor is nice malty, caramelly and sweet. Mouthfeel has surprising body to it. There are some esters to the flavor or maybe I'm picking up something else.","aracauna","Oct 14, 2002"
4.35,12.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Copper red/orange body topped with a one-inch solid off-white head. But it does disipate too quickly. Malt sweetness dominates nose, but there is a touch of herbal hoppiness. There is a good earthiness to the taste. Wonderful caramel snap as it first hits the tongue. While malt is the dominate aspect, it has a depth of taste beyond being simply sweet. While the hops are secondary, they achieve a good balance. Overall, goes down easily but memorably.Year after year, one of my favorite imports.","RonfromJersey","Oct 04, 2002"
4.3,11.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Copper color with thin head. Delectable aroma with hints of cedar and smoke. Malts are fine, substantial, and a little bit raw which is part of the appeal. Hops don't give much dryness or kick in the finish, but what they offer is true perfection in terms of spiciness. Said spiciness is the true draw of a marzen, in my book. This has it in spades. While the malts are sweet and sticky, this beer is actually quite light to drink and could be offered to more trepidatious, less experienced beer tasters. Be absolutely certain to let it warm up. You are doing yourself an injustice if you drink it too cool. This is the quintessential Oktoberfest beer for me. Maybe not the highest marks but it is the most utilitarian.","Thrasher","Oct 01, 2002"

4.33,12.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Clear, deep amber with an orange cast, topped by a cream colored head that holds well and leaves some decent lace. The aroma is of lightly toasted Vienna malts. The body is medium with a standard carbonation level. The flavor is richly toasty backed by a brisk bitterness. It has a bready quality that is not unlike the almost burnt crust. As it warms in the mouth some dark toffee notes are revealed, only to be quickly ushered away by a spicy hop flavor. There is an underlying fruitiness that includes some apple, grape, and plum. The finish is dry with a lightly lingering spicy hop. Very well balanced, alternating between a lightly sweet malt and a crisp bitterness. Refreshing and highly drinkable.","NeroFiddled","Sep 29, 2002"

Sweet smell in the aroma and taste, caramel, almost candy. Slight hops noted in the finish, as well as a big malt taste. Truely a great example of the style, obviously, they've been doing this for a long time. My bartender was puzzled, because I kept with the same beer for more than two.","HopheadEd","Sep 28, 2002"

As for the taste, very sweet caramel malt flavors are balanced well by the hops and the carbonation. Toasted biscuity malt in the background and in the aftertaste. Spicy and crisp hop bitterness is present, especially in the back, which is very nice. Tastes almost like a mini-doppelbock. Great mouthfeel from the carbonation. Excellent märzen! I can't wait to have another. The only thing it needs is better head retention.","hyuga","Sep 24, 2002"

Toasted malt seems to be the dominant taste.  Husky grains are apparant as well.  One aspect is a bit disappointing on the pallate.  A slight off-flavor. A bad bitterness coupled with a slightly soapy aftertaste.  It isn't overbearing, but definitely there.  This is the second german octoberfest I've been a bit disappointed in this year.","Bighuge","Sep 18, 2002"

Smell has a nice toasty, slightly husky malt aroma to it with some nice noble hop aroma as well.  great toasty malt flavors are almost perfectly balanced by the excellent low level bitterness provided by the hops.  The brew has just enough body and is rather smooth and very drinkable.  This is probably my favorite so far for this years Marzens.","Murph","Sep 16, 2002"

The aroma of bready German malts also has a hint of candy sugar.  The smooth body supports a lightly sweet bready flavor with a bold, sharp hop profile creating a very nice balance.  Very tasty.","beernut7","Sep 14, 2002"

It is a gorgeous pour with a nice amber color topped with a creamy head,  The aroma is malt dominated with a warm caramel aroma lingering above the hop spiciness.  The tast is why I love this beer, a full explosive malt flavor dominated with rich caramel and subtle hops spiciness lingering in the mouth. When the first hints of fall are in the air, I could come back to this rich and flavorfull beer again and again.  Now if only I could sample the Paulaner Oktoberfest in Germany!","brakspear","Sep 01, 2002"

I am not the biggest fan of this style... but this brew wins you over with almost nutty sweetness. On revision in 2003 I sensed a metalic nature to the finish. Still a nice solid marsen and I enjoy this style much more since my original review. The only change decreases the taste from a 4.5 to a 4.","frank4sail","May 02, 2002"
4.22,9.3,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Bronze hue w/ excellent clarity.  The fluffy white head settles into a dense layer that's a bit thinner than other German brews.  Rich, toasty Munich malt and toffee aroma. Trace herbal hop nose.  Medium bodied w/ a very smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel.  Complex malt flavors abound in this brew.  Crystal malt sweetness, toasted Munich malt, and that oh so lovely decocted caramelized fruit note make for a tasty experience. The insubstantial hop bitterness serves only to prevent overbearing sweetness and does that well.  Finishes with a semi - dry honey - like sweetness. This widely available and fine brew is quite comparable to Spatens Octoberfest and definitely worth a try.  Think of it as a Salvator ""light.""","marc77","Apr 17, 2002"
