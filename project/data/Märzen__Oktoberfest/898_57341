It's also a bit too carbonated, making each quaff a mouthful of foam. The level of toasting of the malts is ok, but while the structure is integrated, the components themselves are mismatched. Unless Heavy Seas adjusts the recipe in the future, this is a pass when putting together a Marzen / Oktoberfest tasting, unless you want to start with something too sweet to demonstrate how the style can go astray.","BuckeyeSlim","Sep 15, 2012"
3.9,9.6,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"This beer pours a beautiful clear gold with a fluffy two finger head. There is poor retention and no lacing to speak of. Smell is wheat, lemon, and pine. Mouthfeel is great here. Not watery and lots of carbonation that just gives that satisfying feel. Taste is almost pineapple on the front and spicy hops and a faint roasted taste on the finish. Neither taste is particularly overwhelming. If anything the front end might be a little stronger than the finish. Overall an enjoyable beer.","Mojo","Sep 14, 2012"

Sadly, even in Maryland, the price is much to high (8.99). The better German marzens and Oktoberfests are around the same price or are only a dollar or two more expensive. In other words, not a bad offering at all, but not good enough to be compete with other and better beers.

There is a little spice from the hops on the back end but a relatively clean yeast flavor with subtle tinge of apple. Verdict on this is a beer I could deal with frequently. A decent American take on the Marzen style that doesn't strictly conform but I appreciate that.

Nose was very subdued and lacking the big malty character I've come to associate with the style. Flavor profile reveals light fruity esters and toasty malts, but very weak, and lacking the caramel sweetness. Finish expresses cereal grains and the skunky quality initially suggested by the nose.

Medium-bodied, sheds weight as it progresses. Rye, pretzel dough, brown bread and wheat present, no real bite more so this is a conscious foil to the caramel, honey as well as apricot, pear, red apple fruit flavors.

Flavor is equally sweet with roasted malts as it is spicy with herbal edge hop notes, a perfectly balanced malt monster. I really enjoy this more drinkable version of the Americanized Oktoberfest style. Some of these versions are too heavy with the caramel malt this is not the case here touch of caramel and mild spicy note with light herbal bitterness with mineral water notes to it. Mouthfeel is a bit residually sweet with some sticky texture but overall a sturdy amount of carbonation keeps it crisp malt wise it's medium bodied and something I could down by the liter.

3.2,-10.1,3,3,3.5,3,3,"I got a bottle of Balto MarzHon that says "SantaHon" on it, but because it says Marzen Lager below I believe it's the same beer. This beer pours a largely translucent amber color with a medium head. The smell is of watery malt, with no notes of hops. There is no real kick to the taste, it is mostly traditional medium color malts. It goes down with a thick consistency, with not a lot of carbonation to space out the beer which detracts from its drinkability. There is a hint of pumpkin and spice at the very end which dances on the tongue, but for the most part its a one-dimensional taste.","Toddv29424","Sep 29, 2007"
3.68,3.4,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"The first beer that I've had by Clipper City that I thought was marginal -- the rest have been outstanding. This one starts with a moderate malt / moderate grain balance with a hint of sulfer in the nose. The hops seem to balance the beer well with earthy, pungent hops and a light grassy note. The standard copper look releases fair head retention that hangs around til the bottom of the glass. The beer tastes more malty, round, and smooth than the nose suggested, along side of a mild hop flavor and a bitter balance that struggles to keep up with the moderate maltiness. The texture is where I have problems -- the beer lacks depth, creaminess, and seems to fall apart going into the finish. The linger brings up cola-like aftertastes and a light hop / grain astringency. A fair Marzen, it just gets lost in the plethera of good Oktoberfest / Marzens.","BEERchitect","Sep 23, 2007"

Rather mild malt scent not the sweet caramel tone I have smelled in other Marzen style Oktoberfest. There was a rather light malt flavor with a thin body no real heft to this brew. It is smooth but not what I would call my favorite offering of this style. Seemed like they were going their own direction with this one. Light and drinkable but I would only have this one once.

Nice orange/amber color, decent head and refreshingly thinner (than expected) mouthfeel. Taste was incredibly balanced, if not really complex.

This is drinkable, because the high carbonation, decent flavor and mild, yet pleasant, bitterness mesh to make this a beer you throw back for hours.

Slick mouthfeel, like syruped wort. Md body. Drinkability is okay, but the fine carb is too sharp for the style. Plus, the slick mouthfeel and butter suggest a pedio infection.

The nose is clean and fresh with delicately sweetish, lightly bready, moderately toasty, and subtly "juicy" malts (are there some Vienna malts in here?), and enticing floral hops. It's easy to go over the top with the maltiness, but this one's perfect! And it's also perfectly medium-bodied without being overly dextrinous, or too thin; and it's very fine-bubbled, moderate carbonation gives a light caress to the palate and awakens the tastebuds. The flavor is much as the nose suggests, with it's honey-glazed, nutty bread crust maltiness appearing upfront, immediately followed by rising notes of deliciously floral hops. The bitterness is omnipresent but repressed, and they've done a brilliant job of balancing this one!
