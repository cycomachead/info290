Nose of caramel and bread.  Flavors follow a standard Oktoberfest with sweet breaded malts, light sweet caramel malts, and a barely detectable hop in the background.  Light mouth feel.  Decent for what it is, but not a lot of the more robust flavors associated with the style.  Decent.","Brutaltruth","Nov 30, 2014"

It has a great head and looks beautiful in a glass. If I lived in colder climes I might have an issue with the lightness/wateryness of this brand, but if your October has temps in the high 80s and 90s, this beer is refreshing. It's the best "cheap" Octoberfest I can find anyway. Better than Sam Adams for sure.","Urizen","Oct 18, 2014"

3,-5.7,,,,,,"Poured a nice clear amber body with a one finger white head. Very nice and true to style. Scents of rich, sweet malt, a light toasted aroma and a very faint citrus. Overall impression is of a nice, clean Oktoberfest aroma, though the citrus is an odd touch, but not unpleasant. Flavor begins with a nice rich malty sweetness, moving into a nice toasted malt character with an extremely faint touch of lemonade. Middle continues these flavors but gets a little drier, with a very faint hint of alcohol present. Finish is medium-dry with a nice presence of toasted malt. Overall impression is of a clean, malty flavor that is balanced between rich malt and toasted malt. The lemonade flavors faintly in the background are not traditional, but not unpleasant. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy with moderate carbonation. Quite nice and very true to style. Overall this a decent example of an Oktoberfest. It stays mostly to style in most respects and what it does differently is not unpleasant and works with the flavor profile and aroma. Nothing spectacular, but good all around.","Auraan","Sep 06, 2014"

It's got nice lacing, but the head doesn't last long. The colour's even almost copper, but on the lighter side. You can taste a mild sourness common in cheap lagers. It kind of tastes like if you took a good marzen and poured some cheap Walgreen's lager into it. STILL, it preserves a lot of the things I like about marzens, which are some of my favourite beers. Fall is my favourite season for beer. It's got a rich, toasty flavour and a really nice blend of malt flavours, cheap-tasting malt, but still, very well blended. It really tastes like a marzen. The hops, too, taste genuinely like the hops a marzen should have. They're barely, there, just as they should be, but what flavour profile they provide is more than just a bittering agent. They add a bit of flavour, themselves. This is a great buy for the money.","ElCommodoro","Sep 14, 2013"

Taste is the same as the aroma, it's all toasted malt, caramel and some hoppiness. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit coating and very easy to drink. Moderate carbonation.

Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity and loads of CO2 bubbles in evidence. Nose had a honey-like lager sweetness along with a breadiness, initially, and warming, I began to perceive the caramel. Mouthfeel was medium, but there was a pronounced effervescence due to all of the carbonation noted earlier. Taste was sweet, but not cloying, and I really liked the way that the malts interacted so that it had a sweetish, bready flavor initially and then took on a sweeter caramel taste on the finish. I also noted a slight grassiness, perhaps Hallertau hops? Fall seasonal? Hell, it's a "German-style Marzen" and it's damn close to March as it stands. I would like to see this released more often and if not, stash some away for late winter. It is just that good.","woodychandler","Feb 10, 2013"

Fairly unremarkable in terms of taste, just average with no strong malts, spices or hops. Feel is thin and watery with a lower end of carbonation. Overall- This was just okay.

The color and clarity of the beer are its highlights for me. It's a lovely golden brown ale with zero haze. Not much smell to it but a nice, thirst quenching quality in the taste with a solid nutty profile. There's no noticeable aftertaste that sets it apart.

All this said, it is like a more "mass produced" beer quality to appeal to the masses. I just had a Hacker Pschorr, and that beer absolutely showcases the malt so much that it is like drinking a milkshake. This beer is a bit like a Budweiser "premium product" that is clean and made to appeal to the masses.

There was nothing really off or offensive about this beer but it also seemed to lack that certain something that brings all the flavors together, there was a much larger emphasis on the biscuit malts then I would have liked. I liked the mouthfeel the most, it was exactly where it should be for a good Marzen, I also really like the drinkability, if I was in the mood I could take out a six pack of this with no problems. What I liked the least was the taste, I thought it could have been balanced a little better, the larger presence of biscuit malts seemed a little overpowering at times. I usually buy a couple twelve packs of this each fall but since Samuel Adams Octoberfest is just about the same price I think I will be grabbing the Sam Adams instead. If you are wanting a Marzen this will do the job, but with all the other Marzen's that flood the shelf's this time of year, there are better choices to be had for a similar price.

Seriously, I haven't sniffed Snuggle sheets in a while, but I confirmed my suspicions a bit later on in the evening. Odd. The taste wasn't much better, holding notes of some kinda sour-ish caramel, soap, squash, ginger, and some watery orange peel. Honestly, this wasn't very good on the tongue at all. The body is light, with a moderate carbonation and a dry-ish finish.

The smell is honestly not that great. It maybe for a number of reasons but it may be that when you get mass produced beers this is the way it turns out. The smell is of old hops that have seemingly gone past their prime. Overall, something is amiss. There almost seems to be a hint of roasted malt which is uncharacteristic of the style as well. The beer tastes of both the sweet malts that it is supposed to and the bitter stinging taste of hops that have perhaps been skunked (which is now my prevailing theory). The bitterness hits the tip of the tongue. The mouthfeel is really what you should expect and the drinkability is better straight out of the bottle like a cheap beer than poured into a pint glass.

The taste is reflective of the nose; a solid amber malty backbone with hopping to balance but no hop presence, finishes slightly bitter. The mouthfeel isn't quite as dense as I would expect from the style, a light-medium bodied beer with a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is not bad, but not outstanding either.

It's hard to understand, yes, I know. But that's what I got from it. Anyhow, taste is medium bodied and laden with flavors of lightly roasted malts, some dough, corn and hops. Not bad.

Beer is rather sweet, perhaps the sweetest Oktoberfest I have had this year, can really taste the malt, but cannot detect hops or alcohol. Beer tastes better cold than warm.","lampkins","Beers"

3,-5.7,3,3,3,3,3,"Came in a sampler of WI O-fests I recently received. Pours a light copper-straw with a thin off-white head. Smells of singed sweet bread malt with a mild Scotch tape hop smell. I'm not a huge 3M adhesive-smell fan, but it's not too off-putting. Taste comes at you with a bready and bland malt attack up front. Okay, maybe more of a "coast it on in in neutral" than an attack. Anyway, this gives way to a cereal malt wash midway and finally to some indistinct, yet mildly bitter, hops. Finish is a little astringent. Mouthfeel is average to thin (for an Ofest). Overall, slightly more malt and character than a Leinie's lager or Northwoods, but a rather watered-down Oktoberfest.","alexgash","Oct 01, 2004"
3.43,7.9,4,3.5,3,3.5,4,"Crystal clear amber color with a thin white head, with some lacing. Nice malt and yeast balancing in the nose, toasted bread malt aroma, and the yeast smells somewhat spicey. Clean flavor dominated by malt, finishs dry with a little grainy astringency. Overall a very good Oktoberfest style.","redmosquito","Jul 11, 2004"
3.06,-3.8,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,4,"Not too much to complain about, but certainly no overwhelmingly good traits. Leinenkugel's has much better styles, but go ahead and try this one for something different.","hero27","Apr 25, 2004"
3.21,0.9,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,"The beer warmed up and I warmed up to it. The carb toned down and the maltyness came out to greet me. Still not a great beer, the taste and drinkability got bumped up","elmocoso","Jan 20, 2004"
2.66,-16.4,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Looks pretty good: Clear dark amber with a decent-sized off-white head. Head dissipates quickly and leaves a few random patches on the glass. Smell is mildly malty. Taste is sweet and malty, but weak. Really, not much going on here! Are there hops in this? Slightly sour aftertaste. Watery mouthfeel. Not bad... but not very good, either.","jimdkc","Nov 02, 2003"
2.66,-16.4,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"I find myself without a strong opinion on this beer. It isn't bad, but there's really nothing to recommend it either. I find it to be middle-of-the-road as far as Leinie's goes: better than Berry Weiss and Honey Weiss, but not as good as Creamy Dark and Red. Before drinking what is my first every Oktoberfest, I wondered what an Oktoberfest was supposed to taste like. After drinking it, I'm still not sure that I know.","BuckeyeNation","Jan 18, 2003"
3.71,16.7,4,3,4,3.5,4,"Pours a clear autumn amber with a slight egg-shell colored head that forms a nice inch & a half but fades to a thin film rather quick. The carbonation is up abit ti almost fizz-like. The smell is slightly sweet. Hop in the taste is slight as well but just enough to balance to a dry mouth finish. The body is light, alittle watery but drinkable.","chilidog","Jan 03, 2003"

3.2,0.6,3,3,3,3,4,"Pours an amber hue with a white head. Malty sweetness, medium bitterness, average for an O'fest beer. I still have a few left, and its not bad but not great. Better than budweiser. Since you won't run into these guys until next year, I will say that it is better than a macro lager. But not my favorite of this style.","jtw5877","Oct 06, 2002"
2.85,-10.4,2.5,2.5,3,3,3,"dark golden color, cheap foamy head and no lace.  nice toasted malt aroma is cut down to size by the adjunct used (corn).  taste mimics smell...your interest is piqued by a biscuity goodness that is soon drowned in adjunct badness.  pretty light and fairly smooth mouthfeel. thin hop profile adds nothing. o-fest light.  easy to drink with hints of caramel malt flavors.  fairly lame and tame.","budgood1","Oct 06, 2002"
3,-5.7,3,3,3,3,3,"Deep amber in color, the head is beige, the lace is adequate. The nose is caramel, sweet, malt and quite pleasing. Front sweet, the top is light to moderate, the finish is lightly dry, middlingly acidic, basally hopped, drinkable, but nothing to get excitied about as with most of "Lennies" beers. Does not rank on my current 1000 beer master list.","Gusler","Oct 04, 2002"
3.18,0,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"A slightly above average beer in general, but a weak Oktoberfest.  The color was light amber and there was very little aroma.  The taste was sweet and malty but very light.  Might be a good entry Oktoberfest for someone trying the style for the first time after only drinking macros, but I like more flavor.","ryanocerus","Sep 29, 2002"
3,-5.7,3,3,3,3,3,"A very light version of an Octoberfest.  Slightly sweet, but in a good way.  More like an amber than a marzen.  Someone mentioned a mix of an octoberfest and a Killian's Red.  I'd say that was right on.  Drinkable and good, but not the best offering of the style.","proc","Sep 22, 2002"
2.76,-13.2,3.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,3,"Copper in hue w/ trace haze, covered by a very dense persistent head that leaves Belgian lace. The aroma is dominated by sweetness derived from both caramel malt and unfortunately, corn.  Toasty Munich malt and a lemony hop nose are secondary and very light.  Bready sweetness upfront is followed by mildly buttery malt and notes of grain husk.  Sweetness then mimics the aroma mid palate, becoming a combination of caramel malt and cooked corn.  Hop bitterness is paltry, but since overall sweetness is fairly light for style, decent balance is acheived.  Moderate in body, w/ a surprisingly dextrinous mouthfeel considering the apparent use of adjuncts.  Finishes with notes of sweet biscuit and grits.  An odd, and not particularly good oktoberfest.  Think Paulaner's Oktoberfest mixed 50/50 w/ Killian's Red.","marc77","Sep 20, 2002"

3.5,10.1,4,4,3.5,3,3,"Clear copper color.  A big pillowy white head sits on top.  Pretty decent aroma dominated by a luscious sweet malt presence.  Taste has an interesting hop presence.  Nice little hebalness, which add nicely to the underlying toasted malt taste.  Medium to full in body and goes down the hatch fairly effortlessly.  A little better than average for an Ofest.","Bighuge","Sep 09, 2002"
3.21,0.9,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,"A pretty average Octoberfest that works nicely as a thrist quenching amber style beer....The nose is unremarkable...some maltiness, but some corn or adjunct smell as well...body is thin for this style but I don't mind it so much...I bought this figuring it would have some decent malt tones and be rather thin/easy drinking...I was dying of thirst after work tonight and this went down nicely....The taste is on the malty side but not real heavy...it does finish with a little dry note...not an all-time great, but one that can be enjoyed in the right spot...","ZAP","Sep 05, 2002"

2.96,-6.9,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,3.5,"Clear amber orange color, head thin and quickly down to a 1/8 inch.  Very little in the aroma department.  Decent malt flavor, mostly in a brown sugar range with peppery hops showing earlier than some Fests.  Both malt and hop could be stronger -- in a point/counterpoint manner.  Thin mouthfeel...Pretty average, but drinkable.  May be one of "Leinie's" better efforts.","ADR","Beers"
3.49,9.7,4.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Rather light in aroma, more of a  pale malt than lightly roasted. Reddish, orangish and gold in color.  Bright and clear.  Big and solid head.  A nice looking beer.  A Maerzen made more for the masses than lovers of this style.  Flavor lacks the boldness I'd expect, but is of a stronger malt than just pale malt with some richness in middle to finish, leaving some dryness on the tongue.  Medium body that seems appropriate with adequate carbonation. For me not an altogether poor start to the Oktoberfest season.","garymuchow","0"
