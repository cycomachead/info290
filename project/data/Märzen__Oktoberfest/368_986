I could use a little less of the sweetnes and more boldness in the toasted and dough character. The first sip brings mild toast with some caramel sweetness. This fades to a very mild spicy hop finish that just hints at bitter on the side of my tongue. The brew is moderate with a moderate carbonation.

Good complexity to the flavors with a hint of alcohol. You really have to let this one warm up a bit for the full flavor to develop, if you can resist. The best part is the lingering malt flavor in your mouth drawing you back for another swallow. Pretty average flavor if not for the finish. A lot of carbonation deters from the mouthfeel and drinkability for me.

A nicely done festbier that delivers a bit of hops as well as malt!","NeroFiddled","Oct 21, 2003"
3.76,3.9,4,3,4,4,4,"This bottle came in a tour sample pack of which you only get one of each. What I had was half of this in a glass, the other half shared. It poured a nice clear, darker than others, amber. The head was full, fluffy and laceable. The aroma I can't say stood-out. The taste was a carmel malt balanced by a hint of bitter hop. The mouth was left crisp. Given this 6 oz. sample, I'll pick this beer up again if and when I see it. A good Octoberfest offering.","chilidog","Sep 06, 2003"

3.85,6.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This is an amber colored beer with a small and quick to depart white head. The aroma is malty, slightly toasted. The taste of this is a well balanced caramel and grainy taste. Neither are quick to dominate. Hop bitterness is also present, but well balanced as well. This is not a bad beer at all.","Tballz420","Aug 16, 2003"
3.75,3.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Had this tapped for me at the Wisconsin State Fair. Very Dark amber,with full head.Carmelly thicker first taste, left a carmel sweet taste on the tongue.2nd and 3rd sips a roasted malt and molasses taste sneaks in, not boldly but distinctly. Left a cotton candy taste in my mouth when I was done","grynder33","Aug 04, 2003"
3.75,3.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Here it is in August and the Oktoberfest has already hit the shelves, along with four others that were on the same shelf. Out the those, this was the only one I haven't had. A little early if ya ask me, but oh well, here we go - Clear ambery-brownish color with a small off-white foamy head that fades, little spots of lace. Smell is a roasty sweet malt with a touch of herbal like hops and earthyness coming through. Taste is subdued roasted malts with some sweetness and slight tang coming through mostly, a touch of herbal qualities show up near the finish along with a balancing sweetness. Feel is a bit lighter then expected, even while drinking it in 85 degree heat, it is however, very smooth and easy for good drinkin'.","tavernjef","Jan 19, 2003"
2.6,-28.2,3,3,2.5,2,2.5,"Capital seems to have dropped the ball on this one. Either that or I had a bad bottle. Amber in color with an off-white head that retreats quickly. Light aroma consisted of some sweet malt and a touch of caramel. Mouthfeel teeters between thin and medium-bodied. Taste is extremely bland for an Oktoberfest. Everything about the caramel, biscuit and malt flavors are muted and watered down. Very disappointing.","Winter","Dec 09, 2002"

3.95,9.1,4,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Off-white head, gone quickly. Amber/caramel color. Aroma:vegetal, herbal,spicy, earthy, pumpkins. Rich maltiness, nice sweet overtones, some tingly hops. A satisfactory Oktoberfest, very smooth and easy-drinking.","feloniousmonk","Oct 30, 2002"
3.8,5,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Clear orange-copper color, nice white foamy head. Aroma of light caremel and flowers, sweet, balanced malts and clean tasting, light body, a little thin semi-watery mouthfeel, still a very good Oktoberfest.","maxpower","Sep 06, 2002"
3.8,5,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Now we're getting somewhere. Part of the Capital ""Summer Sampler", this is a really good seasonal. Dark amber with decent lace. Nice honey and nutty aroma. Tastes kind of like a Marzen with a malt flavor and light caramel finish. I will look for this one next summer.","Dogbrick","Sep 03, 2002"

3,-17.1,3,3,3,3,3,"re-rate 9/6/05-Same cloudy appearance..almost a sour candy apple type finish...one of their worst products and one of the worst o-fests I've had...average is being kind","ZAP","Aug 27, 2002"
4,10.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Clear bright orange color, good creamy head of 1/4 inch.  Toasty aroma, a little brown sugar.  Nice match for style, nice dominant caramel malt flavor with a hoppy clove bite peppered in.  Good elements of toast.  A little better mouthfeel than some.  Very drinkable, open a couple and pour 'em in a big ass stein and quaff in honor of the harvest.  A good kick off for Fest season for me (I'm not counting the bomber of Lagunitas)...","ADR","Beers"
4.3,18.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This clear reddish brown brew throws out a nice long lasting thin off white head.  Nice bready, yeasty, malty aroma.  Nice biscuit tones on the tongue as well as toasted malt.  Very clean tasting.  Very little to no caramel malt sweetness is noted.  Some slight hop bitterness is apparant.  Medium bodied and very drinkable.  I'm in anticipation of some nice 50 degree autumn days to enjoy these fine O-fest beers.    Another solid lager from Capital.","Bighuge","0"
3,-17.1,3,3,3,3,3,"Amber with hints of orange.  Complex malt aroma.  Mixed hop and malt flavor that is on the light side for style.  Finish is rather dry and long.  Overall good but not great.","garymuchow","0"
