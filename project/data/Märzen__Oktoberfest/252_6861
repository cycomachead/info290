Almost light medium body with a touch of smoothness. Above average carbonation that provides a nice effervescence throughout. The flavor profile is laid back, but has a very nice balance and a bit of complexity. It begins with pear and a touch of lemon, then flows into a rather toasty biscuit light sweetness. The middle effervesces into a slight bitterness over a receding biscuit. The finish approaches crisp and has a noble hop flavor note over a slightly dry character. A solid Oktoberfest, but not world class such as Great Lakes, Hacker-Pschorr or Ayinger.","tillmac62","Oct 23, 2014"

This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, a little clean, crisp, not filling at all and the taste did an ok job at holding my attention, I could drink a couple of these, but it isn't something I would drink if I wanted a good Marzen.  What I like the most about this beer was how unique it was, the perfume and herbal aspect was unique and while it was a little weird at first I found myself liking it the more I drank it.  What I liked the least about this beer was that it wasn't true to style, it's just not what I expect from the style and I'm pretty sure there would be no way i would guess this is a Marzen if I tried it blind.  I might buy this beer again, but not if I wanted a straight up Marzen.  I wouldn't turn it down though.  I think this is worth giving a try, but I wouldn't recommend it as a good and true to style Marzen.  All in all I was a little confused by this beer, I didn't mind it, it's just not really what I was expecting, but I think this might be a nice change of pace if I was drinking traditional Marzens all day.  This isn't my favorite beer from this brewery or my favorite Marzen, but I think it's decent in it's own way.  I like the uniqueness of this beer, but it's just not what I think of as a Marzen, I appreciate the effort and I didn't expect a brewery that is this so old and traditional to make such a different take on the style.","StoutHunter","Sep 23, 2014"

4.05,9.2,,,,,,"O: 4 This is very good and refreshing beer. I was thinking it would be a bit darker with more body and roasted malt flavors (like a transition from typical summer beers to dark, winter beers). This reminds me more of a really good pilsner with more interesting flavors and aromas. Still a good beer, just different than I was expecting and hoping for.","Tele","Sep 13, 2014"

Very surprised at both actually. Lots going on with the aroma and is of grains, yeast with a hint of citrus. Even more so going on with the taste that has a hint of honey, herbal and bread (yeast). Very tasty and goes down very easy with no bitter or harsh aftertaste at all! Medium bodied as well as medium carbonation. Fantastic brew and the BEST Oktoberfest style beer to date!","BeerWithMike","Sep 13, 2014"

3.85,3.8,,,,,,"Pours a clear light gold with a very short-lived fizzy white head. A little bit a head lasts on the surface, aided by a steady carbonation stream. The aroma is light but distinct: grassy, biscuits, earthy, with the hops dominating. The aroma is in lock-step but a bit more malt-forward, with the hops coming in towards the finish. The body is lighter, but not watery and there's a slight bit of carbonation, but barely noticeable. A really good lager.","delta490","Sep 12, 2014"

3.5,-5.7,,,,,,"Overall-  Its a good beer, but I expect/prefer oktoberfests to be maltier.  While, this has some malt presence, its simply too light and unassertive.  Seems like they were going for a balanced approach, which they succeeded in, but some styles are better a little unbalanced (eg. ipas).  I would drink this again, but I would not purchase this again. However, I am glad I tried it as it shows the the apparently broad range in which oktoberfests can be made. (80/100)","CTbrew32","Sep 11, 2014"

3.78,1.9,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"330 ml bottle into dimpled mug, bottled on 4/16/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear bright gold color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and clean mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice pale Oktoberfest style. All around good balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 05, 2014"

I like the nose very much, but not under this style. Flavor is bitter, some bits of corn and grain, a little bit of anise almost in the back. Light bodied with higher carb and a dry finish with a rubbing tongue feel. This is the least impressive of Weihenstephan's beers.

Sweet biscuit flavors up front followed by earthy grain and a spicy, tangy, bitter hop bite. Finishes dryly with an herbal, lemony bitter aftertaste.

Pleasant wheat and light malt flavor. A slight off-flavor bitterness in the middle, wheat malt finish. Some banana and clove hints. Very refreshing to drink. Carbonation lively throughout. More hefeweizen character than other marzens. It could use a bit more sweetness for perfection. I still like this a lot, like all the Weihenstephan beers.","LiquidAmber","Jul 18, 2012"

Herbal, leafy hops and lager yeast giving a very clean impression. Bitterness is mild, for a more or less even balance. Mouthfeel is light bodied, thin and carbonation is slight. Makes for an easy drinking beer, this whole review and drinking Festbier in it's entirety took 6 minutes.

In my opinion however... I'm kind of surprised. It's good, but it doesn't blow my hair back.

The taste holds notes of spicy rye, light caramel, greens, flowers, grass, orange zest, wheat, and light black pepper. I'm actually surprised the malts came through as well and as strongly as they did here, given the lightness of the look and smell...

Palate is malty sweet and crisp as can be. Hops bitterness balanced perfectly with the hints of roast malt to keep this from being cloying. Overall an excellent beer.

Taste is very much the same, maltier than the nose lets on, but not by much. Finishes by leaving the faintest lightly dry and bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, a little rough because of this brew's watery-thin viscosity.

Nose is mild, musty wheat with a hint of sweetness detectable in the profile. Taste consistent with nose, as well as the addition of some light fruit (pear); wheat/biscuity character lingers at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-bodied with consistent, but subdued carbonation.

The smell had some spicy notes, with hops dangling around the nose after the initial pour. the tast resembles a marzen the most, because i don't taste the malty notes that are more apparent in an octoberfest. The alcohol is present here, dissapating very quickly and smooth over the tongue leaving very quick, nice you might say.

Where most Oktoberfest beers begin with a bright copper/orange hue mixed in with ligher highlights, this beer reminds me a lot of German Lagers. Even the nose is more hop-forward with a spicy saaz note and haullertau herbal, grassy character. Malts stay clean, crisp, sweet, and bold, with no hints of caramel, toast, or melanoidin taste. Instead, a bold lager-like flavor comes through, though pushing the threshold on sweetness and body. Confectionate sugars with fresh fruity notes (pez-like), give a very pleasant sweet tastes to accompany the pilsner malts. A bit heavy in the body for a pils, begins to bring out a marzen-type weight. Nicely carbonated and bitter. Finishes quite clean with a hop note late and some malty sweet breadiness / yeastiness. It's a very good beer, but not what I consider a Festbier. So, the rating may not reflect the quality of the beer, but style accuracy.","BEERchitect","Beers"

Something trying to give it just a hint of sweetness between the alcohol/pale malt sharpness. Finishes with a little bit of metallic aftertaste. As a light lager and nothing else, this isn't bad.
