"Overall: not a bad beer but not on my list to drink again. A bit to sweet and not quite as balanced as I'd prefer."

"O- Very tasty. Hop profile is great. The malt character is a great balance of toasty and sweet."

"Excellent Oktoberfest (Marzen) style beer, Been to the Oktoberfest in Munich many times and this beer is as good or better than any other beers that I've tasted  of this style I poured three 12 Oz. bottles into a 1 liter glass mug. A nice two inch head and reddish  color.  The aroma was perfect. It brought me back to Munich . This is a very drinkable beer to be had year round..........Ein Prosit!"
"Overall: I'm sure there are better Oktoberfest beers out there, but I'd get this again.  It's exactly what it's trying to be; nothing more, nothing less."

"The best fest I've had in memory!  Off of tap in green lake Wi fantastic"

"Medium bodied with average carbonation, and very little that stands out. New Glarus makes a lot of good beers, but this is not one of their better efforts."

"This is light bodied, crisp and modestly carbonated. A crushable brew by marzen standards, I could/would drink a bunch of this if it was accessible to me in season."
""
""
""

"Brilliant amber color, with a frothy cream head that slowly dissipates. Aroma is dominated by floral and earthy noble hops, which fade to a toasted, bready malt character. Flavor reveals specialty malt fruitiness initially, which is countered by bready, nutty malt in the lightly dry finish. Very sessionable beer. The fruitiness is a bit more than I'd prefer in the style."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours light red amber with a good one finger white head. Smells of berries and nice sweet caramelized grain. Tastes of fruit, berries and nice sweet grain. Beer is lightly carbonated finishes smooth. Overall a very good beer."

"Orange with a tint of gold in color. Head dissipated very quickly. Creamy colored collar persists. Smell is mostly tangy orange with some faint leather notes. Taste is of citrus and spice (think coriander, ginger, and clove). Mouthfeel is probably my favorite thing about this beer. Light, yet full; despite the low amount of head, the carbonation is enjoyable. I'm enjoying New Glarus more and more with every brew I have from them; however, this is the first one that hasn't wowed me."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: A pretty solid take on a Marzen. Good biscuity malt notes with some nice undertones."

"Wisconsin brewing company new glarus knows what there doing when it come to a Oktoberfest, not as heavy as other Oktoberfest, but has amazing flavor and a great aroma. a beer id recommend to any Oktoberfest beer drinker. but for those out of state people i feel bad for you that you cant experience this beer or any other new glarus beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid take on the style by an American brewery. Definitely one for the malt lovers out there. I'd highly recommend this if you're into the style"
""
""
"Picked this up going to the Bristol renaissance fair. I wanted to compare this Oktoberfest style beer with Two Brothers Atom Smasher (oktoberfest) style beer. I absolutely love anything that New Glarus produces but in this case Two Brothers Atom Smasher takes the win. Staghorn is extremely smooth with a barley flavour. Nice hopp flavour as as you open your mouth after you finish swallowing the amber colored brew. Well rounded mellow smooth taste. I'd deffinately grab another 6er if I'm up in Wisconsin within the next month or so... Or even next years Oktoberfest."

"The feel on this is very nice. Clean, refreshing in a light bodied beer that is well carbonated. Slightly dry finish that is very heavy on the malts. This is a very good Oktoberfest-style beer, one of the best I've had, actually. Nice work on this lager, Dan."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This tastes like autumn. It has that perfect blend of spicy hop and malt. Just excellent. I thought I remembered not liking this one, so I'd been avoiding purchasing it for awhile (plus having 2 years without being near Wisconsin), but I was wrong. This is wonderful."
""
""
""
""
""

"Nice rep for the style. Color was a nice golden/red. The head presented itself nicely, about a half of inch but then dissipated quickly. I'm usually looking for a little more malty finish in an Oktoberfest, it was briefly there but not as pronounced as I look for in this style. Overall this is a very drinkable offering from an outstanding brewery. If you get a chance to pick up a sixpack or better yet, if you get a chance to have this on tap– I wouldn't pass it by. It'll be well worth the cost."

"O: I had the bar set pretty high on this one and New Glarus cleared it by a country mile. Not sure how much a sixer of this cost in Wisconsin, but I imagine it's pretty much the same as I'd grab a quality O-fest around here. I think I'll move to cheeseland during the fall."
"overall a great seasonal from this brewery. very flavorful and quite fulfilling."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours light copper - see through - with foamy white head. Light malty smell. Light malty flavor, hop swirled in. Modestly sweet. Touch of spiciness on the tongue. Real easy drinker with loads of malty goodness. Good O'fest celebrator. Clean."

"This beer poured out as a nice looking orange amber color. The head on the beer was very nice, it settles but as a good retention. The smell of the beer is earthy with a pleasent malt aroma. The taste has a very nice caramel malt flavor with a slightly bitter grassy finish. The mouthfeel is smooth, nicely carbonated and medium bodied. Overall I found this to be really good, came close to some of the Oktoberfest beers that I tend to enjoy the most."
""
""
""
"This is a very sessoinable Octoberfest beer that is gone too fast. One of my favorite fall beers."
""
"Drinkability: I was a little disappointed initially but the beer turned into something special. It is a very solid beer and one of the best märzens I have tried."
""
"Beer is medium-bodied with medium levels of carbonation, resulting in a slightly fizzy, but gradually smooth mouthfeel. Finish is not dry, and there is some residual sweetness across the palate. This generally comes across as correct for the style and this particular beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes like it smells. Sweet and bready, but not as rounded as my favorite marzens. The sharp, grassy end grows on you, but it the balancing effect with the smoother malty start isn't fully to my liking. I guess I'm just particular with this style? Still, well brewed and they hit what they were going for. Just, so far as marzens go, I'd prefer they had gone for something a little different. Again, this isn't to say this is bad--because it's actually pretty good--it's just not the top tier oktoberfest I was hoping it would be."
""
""
"O - From the maltiness to it's earthy hops, New Glarus' Staghorn Octoberfest embodies much of what makes a classic German Oktoberfest great, but seems to miss the mark on mass consumption drinkability a bit. While I truly enjoy the balance and bolder hoppiness this beer offers, I can't say that I'd want it served to me in a liter stein. I'll stick to the yearly 6-pack, one delicious Staghorn at a time."
""
"O - thanks to Skye for bringing this from Madison, a great way to celebrate the coming of Autumn."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I tend to sway towards a more malty sweet version of this style. However this beer is well made and I'd have no problem knocking these back on a crisp fall day. Just a bit boring with a weak malt backbone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a a dark amber, almost copper color, with a big cap of creamy foam that stayed around throughout. A rich malty aroma fills the nose. The medium bodied beer is incredibly smooth and creamy with just the right amount of carbonation. A big dose of grain continues on the palate. Its not too sweet, a little bready and just a hint of caramel. It exclaims the bounty of a fall harvest-- keeping the grain center stage. The finish has just a hint of bitterness. This is a clean brew with a nice fall flavor. The folks at New Glarus followed their own path when developing this Oktoberfest and it stands above many other fall seasonals."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful dark amber color with a lovely head. The smell is sweetly complex, with overtones of clove. But the flavor is what makes this one so great. It's a richly complex beer, smooth but not overwhelming. One of the best I've had in quite some time."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very clean, easy drinking version of the style. Many of the typical Oktoberfest beers tend to be far to malty for my likings, but this one is fairly nice."
""
"Overall I really like this beer. Very drinkable, very tasty. It has just enough of everything and keeps with the style, won't bore but doesn't step out the bounds. I really like it and will continue to be excited for it every fall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I really do not like this beer. Strange, considering I really enjoy almost everything else from New Glarus. There are many other Oktoberfest style brews I prefer to Staghorn (including Sam Adams), I don't think I'll be revisiting this in the future."
"O- This beer was good and definitely drinkable however the low carbonation made it seem very off. The scent was rather poor although it smelled alright. Kind of a swing and a miss for new Glarus. First of their beers I have ever tried and felt this way about. Hoping this bottle was defective but I'm not so sure. May try again at some point if I get the chance but this was really a rather bland marzen."
""
""
"Pours a clear deep amber/copper color with a nice white head and some spotty lacing on the way down. The nose has a good bit of amber and bready malt with a touch of caramel sweetness. Some earthy hops lingering in the background. The flavor is quite malty with a bit of hops cutting through the finish. Medium body. Very nice."
""
"The beer is light golden colored with a white head. The aroma is mildly fruity, light malt. Smooth feel. Nice flavor, with a lingering lager malt and fruity aftertaste. A touch of dryness in the finish. Light bodied, this one goes down easily. A solid example of the style."
""

"D/O: This beer is a genuine pace-setter among American-brewed amber lagers. There may be no better choice to show off the potential of New Glarus to brew a traditional and delicious German-style beer. It is deliciously malty and very palate-friendly--truly compelling."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I realize I'm late in the season, but this is one of my favorite Oktoberfests out there.. had it before, I'm sure I'll have it again-"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a top tier lager. A very clean and precise Oktoberfest that compares well with any US-brewed versions of the style."
"Overall a tasty and clean beer. I'm somewhat off-put by the syrupy mouthfeel, but quickly disappears so as not to detract from the total experience of the beer. Would drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - this is a really solid Marzen style brew. Pretty straightforward, but this style usually isn't the deepest in flavors. But what is there is really good and flavorful. Definitely enjoyed this offering!"
"Overall: This beer is very drinkable, but it's hard to distinguish this as anything other than a slightly spicer, more expensive miller lite. Again, I do not like the style, but even for a Marzen this one fell flat for me. It DOES make a great brat marinade, however."
"Overall: I like a lot of the beers from New Glarus, but this isn't one of my favorites. Way too sweet for a Marzen Oktoberfest style and way too thin and watery. There are too many good Oktoberfest beers out there to have any reason to seek this one out again."
"O: Of all of the Octoberfest/Marzen style brews I have tried, this is the most memorable. It has the nice lager flavors that go along with the style, but also has it's own unique spin. Well done New Glarus."
"I was able to try Staghorn last night at an Oktoberfest party. The beer poured clear, amber orange with a sudsy, off white head that settles pretty quickly. Not much lace to speak of. The scent for the most part was typical grain and slight alcohol. The taste was dissapointing to me, the beer was slightly sweet and a mild spicy hop character that balances well in the finish. There's a vague fruitiness in the aftertaste with warmth as well. The mouthfeel is ok...the body was fine I dont think I can have more than one though. Overall it is ok worth a try ...sure....more than that....eh."
"O- Refreshing,pleasant Octoberfest that I could drink year around, very good bordering on great beer. New Glarus never disappoints."
"Overall: My favorite Octoberfest beer. I love this beer Dan Carey does a fantastic job with this style! It falls... and this beer is the beer I love during this season!"
"Normally I don't want another marzen but I would make an exception for this. Unfortunately, this is the only one left from my Wisconsin trip. I found these old Wisconsin microbreweries to be much better than I had given them credit for. They make a lot of micro-miller, but they also make bolder styles."
"O=Huge disappointment. Okay to sell this, just don't call it an Octoberfest."
"O- Meh. Just ok. It would be a good beer if your planning on drinking a 6 pack or tailgating, but just to plain for me."
"Overall, this is a good german style marzen. I guess I tend to prefer the more americanized versions of them, which are heavier on the malt, but this is still a good one. I love New Glarus."
"O: This is decent beer, but it's not outstanding. There are many other Octoberfest beers that I'd prefer. I'm glad to have tried it though."
"Another decent offering from the New Glarus crew, who don't seem to make anything bad. If you like your Oktoiberfests on the sweet side, this may not be the one for you, but the herbs and spices make it a little unique and worth a try. The 6.25% abv is not even noticeable."
"O: A nice beer to drink. Very traditional. The noble hops are there. But....I think my Ofest preference is the Americanized version. I crave more caramel from mine such as found in Sam Adams or Great Lakes. This is more like the imports. Not a bad thing. But I like a maltier beer for this style."
"The taste starts with a very bready malt front, loads of grain, some caramel, and just a bit of hop to provide balance. The mouth is light and smooth."
"I followed up a Paulaner Oktoberfest with this version from New Glarus. The Munich brew is less flavorful, but more subtle and maybe a little better balanced. The fact that the Paulaner brewery is 6000 miles away and the New Glarus brewery is 60 miles away may have a bearing on the contrast, though."
"Staghorn pours a golden cooper like color with a good size white head. THe smell was a bit weaker, but had a bit of a malty tone. The taste was very balanced, a nice spice note, very similar to other Marzens. The taste was very balanced, it was overpowering, but wasnt watery either. Overall I found this one VERY enjoyable, one of the better Marzens out there."
"O: Wasn't that impressed with this one. Big malts and nothing else. Very one dimensional."
"Another sessionable New Glarus beer, fortunately for those doing Oktoberfest in Wisconsin. What about the rest of us?"
"Appears on the lighter yellow-orange side of amber in color, transparent with lively bubbles rising up from the bottom of the glass. One finger of head, recedes to a skim layer, no lacing. Smells of medium strength lightly toasted bready malt and mostly earthy spectrum noble hopping, tastes of the same but with a sharp drop-off of the noble hopping in the mid sip that leaves the finish as a gradual fade-out of the malt sweetness. Stays clean and simple without being boring, lighter bodied and brisk on the palate... I'd recommend giving it a try at least once."
"O: For around 9 bucks a sixer, this is hard to pass up. It passes strict German muster, tastes right, and tastes good."
"Flavors of sweet graham cracker, tea leaves, wet barley. Light feel, fairly malty. Nothing to really pontificate on, but a solid malty lager with no off flavors. Prost!"
"Overall: another solid NG beer. not high on flavor, but looks and smells good with a clean finish. very easy to drink and very enjoyable too. if youre into oktobers, this one is worth a drink every year!"
"O) Fall + Football = Staghorn. This is a great brew, and I always look forward to it."
"O - A real Oktoberfest with very rich sugar biscuit and spice flavors. I tend to go back to this as my fall session beer. Very drinkable but flavorful."
"O -- Giving this a 4 for overall because it's well worth sampling, even though it doesn't really fit a true Märzen Oktoberfest in style. I really wish NG would start using some of the imported malts used in 2 Women, but maybe I'll just grab more 2 Women for my Oktoberfest pleasure."
"O - an easy style to overlook, but this one is delicious, and oh so easy to drink, a beer I look forward to every year"
"EDIT-A little bit of a yeast taste when I had one of the last two left from my six pack. Interesting...."
"O - While I think this one is a bit past its prime I still enjoyed it. I will have to try and get some this year so I can compare the two."
"Taste is very nice with a healthy dosing of roasted malts, a light spiciness and a marzen yeast that brings more earthy grain malt qualities out. Overall this is really good stuff for a Marzen. Smoother than probably any that I have had and can compare to this. Extremely drinkable and glad to have a few more waiting. Next stop, Germany for a comparison."
"Taste is typical Oktoberfest. Malty. Slightly astringent after taste. This one is pretty good; I am just not a lager fan in general. I have had only a couple of this style that I say I really rate highly. Nothing personal; this one is true to type."
"Pours a clear copper color with just a little bit of head. Smells malty and sweet - a pretty nice smell, not overpowering. Tastes of roasted malt with the hops coming through as well. This is a nice octoberfest beer. Good feel and drinkability. I enjoyed this beer even though it's probably been in the fridge for a few months. I'll definitely be looking for it this fall."
"Soft mouthfeel, consistency just north of water, in a word excellent."
"It is a bit sweet, but it's not cloying. THere's a nice maltiness to it that's very chewy and creamy. The hops balance it out very well leaving a nice dry finish, quite solid."
"I like it but don't love it. I could drink one, maybe two, and be good for a while."
"At first I was nervous when I took my first whiff of this beer, as the aromas did not appeal to me, however, as this beer warmed in the glass it became a very good beer and a joy to drink."
"Reviewed 1/10/2010. Bottle thanks to FlssmrBrewAlum. Pours a clear orange with a small white head. Aroma of stale, grainy malt. Flavor of sweet light malts and a grainy, crackery finish. Some excess sweetness in the aftertaste. On the bland side but ok overall for an oktoberfest."
"D. Finished off quite easily. One of my favorite Octoberfests this year."
"New Glarus is very well known in Wisconsin for making great beer and this Oktoberfest if no exception. It pours a light amber color and you take in a mild scent of spices. The initial sip seems a little weak but is followed by an explosion of spices that tickle your taste buds that drinks rather smooth. Definetly an Oktoberfest worth trying!"
"D - Glad I had tried the brew but it didn't do a lot for me, actually a bit disappointed. Probably wouldn't seek this brew out again"
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with carbonation being moderate. Drinkability is very good, it's a very clean and crisp beer that also has some good flavors and excellent balance. An excellent version of the style and a very good beer overall."
"Pretty much as drinkable as I can imagine a beer with more than 6% alcohol being. Easy going down but with plenty of flavor to savor so it would be a shame to drink it too quickly."
"Beer is medium to light in body with moderate sweetness at leadoff. The sweetness gives way to a carboanted palate that has mild fruit flavors, mild apples but not spoiled. The finish isn't dry, its balance and has no bitterness. Its about as easy drinking as a beer gets. I'd have another, shit I have another (thanks beerwolf)."
"Like any good Oktoberfest, I can't seem to put Staghorn down. New Glarus never seems to disappoint me, especially in the lager department."
"What a remarkable beer. Clean with not off flavors, even the malt sweetness does not show a caramel tone to it which most American versions do. Very drinkable and a sure pick. I'll be seeking this beer out next year, no doubt."
"D -"
"There's absolutely nothing detracting from this beer's drinkability. It's clean, it's balanced, it's tasty, and the ABV is reasonable."
"D - This is a great Octoberfest beer! This is extremely drinkable, especially for a seasonal/Octoberfest beer. It hard to have one. Outstanding job New Glarus!"
"Drinkability is great, finishes crisp and clean, could drink liters of this."
"D/O- Good interpretation of the style. Somehow an underrated New Glarus brew...due to their relative dominance in the Unplugged/R&D/fruit area perhaps. Very refreshing. Yearly staple."
"D-Very flavorful, very smooth, making for a nice evening if your fridge is stocked with this beer."
"D: I'd love to sit and drink a 1L stein of this. The tastiness of this has inspired me to go and pick up some genuine Oktoberfests while they're still fresh on shelves."
"Really good oktoberfest. Great drinkability with a smooth finish. Not hard to throw a couple back after a long fall day at work."
"I just recieved this from florida9 in a BIf. The pour is a clear copper with an above average white head. Lots of caramel and earthy malt on the nose. The flavor is full of sweet malt and earthy notes with a lingering sweet finish. A well balanced fest beer that I am very glad to be enjoying."
"D: Aside from Great Lakes, this is my favorite Oktoberfest of this season."
"Drinkability -- This is an exceptional, well-refined Oktoberfestbier, possibly my favorite. Got to hand it to New Glarus for keeping the malt sweetness subdued. Not terribly complex, but to my mind the style is meant to be enjoyed in abundance; Staghorn is perfect in this regard."
"D - very well executed. nicely executed feel and malt profile with a great balance. up there with my favorites for the style. NG never ceases to impress. thanks to a74gent for the trade!"
"Taste is mostly sweet, a sort of buttery sugar, caramel deal. Corn is a light flavor hanging in the background. Everything comes back to sweetness, can't say much more. It's not as diverse and some beers, but it's simplicity is pure and clean with a crisp hops bite that doesn't really hit with any extreme bitterness, adding a bit of citrus that cleans the palette. Extremely refreshing and tasty. There are not many beers that can make simple seems sophisiticated. This beer has almost the bare essentials in terms of flavor, but its execution is impecable. This is a homerun balance of tradition and innovation. Hands down the best octoberfest I've had recently."
"Fairly complex in character for a Marzen. I'm used to a sweeter malt profile, but I can see pounding a Staghorn or two every harvest moon or so. Vielen Dank!"
"Again, thanks GDBEERMAN!"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a large mug. It poured a nice copper color with a moderate amount of head that dissipated sort of quickly. It smelled sweet and malty, i spent a long while just enjoying the great smell of the beer. The taste is great, it's fruity and sweet, but not overly so. The mouthfeel is a little thin, but i didn't really mind it. I could drink this beer one after the other and enjoy every drop of it. Truly a great beer."
"T/M: the taste is a classic Oktoberfest lager, with rich notes of caramel. Hoppy undertones of spicy clove. Rich in taste, and the body is a nice balance of flavors."
""
"One of a number of beers sampled during a fishing weekend in northern Wisconsin. This entry pours a clear copper amber topped by about a finger of white foam. The nose comprises burnt (...caramelized...) caramel, orange rind, flowers, and Indian corn. The taste holds notes of dry toffee, light tobacco, orange peel, light maple syrup, and light sweet honey. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a solid O-Fest, not the best I've had but far from the worst. VDubb would agree with me that this one's talked up a bit too much, though."
"Got this on a guys weekend trip up to the Northwoods of Wisconsin. As a lover of the style I'm really excited to get my hands on this to taste the hype. It pours a golden orange color with a nice frothy ecru head. The smell is fairly vacant for most of the Oktoberfests that I'm used to. There is obviously the distinct smell of malts and in this instance there is a slight citrus smell from what seems to be hops. On the trail end there is a hint of orange zest in addition to the hoppy aroma. The taste is exactly as it smells with the hoppiness causing a slight bittering on the back of the tongue. I've gotta say maybe it's that I've heard such good things about this one, or maybe it's because this is more of the traditional German style that is not my preference. This is not the best Oktoberfest available and that in itself is a disappointment. It's pretty drinkable and carbonated right and not a bad O-fest, just it's not my favorite."
"Overall, a very nice Octoberfest... World class? Hmmm... Not so sure about that one but it is a dang good brew.... I polished off 4 while grilling chickens and watching Tennessee get their rear end handed to them by Florida so I must have enjoyed it some..."
"d 1.5 as the weeks have rolled past, each bottle seems less appealing than the last. have not even finished the last several. there's just something weird in the flavor and burpback--probably the alcoholic fruitloopyness with a touch of aftershave. want to keep liking it, but i can't."
"I like New Glarus."
"D- Light and crisp makes this beer very drinkable which we all know by now is NG's m.o. It may not be spot on style wise but is still very balanced and tasty."
"For full disclosure I got this because I was looking for a sixer of something from New Glarus while I was still home and the badass bottle lept out at me. Awhooo!!"
"Very decent and I'm very glad I gave this another shot."
"D - Pretty drinkable, nice take on the Marzen, not world class, but wouldn't turn this down."
"Overall- Really good! I am enjoying this so much I am thinking of how I can get a keg of it or try to find a clone recipe to homebrew it! A wonderful session beer with just enough complexity to make you want another. The great balance in this beer also makes it fun to drink as one sip reveals more hop bitterness/hop flavors, and the next brings out more of the malt flavors. Another winner for New Glarus!"
"J"
"thanks, george, for the first of a few good extras im looking forward to."
"Thanks Jeff."
"The taste is sweet, light malts with some toasted bread and spicy hops, especially in the finish. It's extremely smooth and creamy for the style with the carbonation not getting in the way of the feel. Overall, an excellent Oktoberfest."
"Overall an above average marzen. Let's hope this is my last okto so I can end on a high note"
"Good heaviness, good carbonation, very beer favorable, good drinker, a session beer if not for the above 6% abv. I'll take this all year round over anything made in Germany."
"A different rendition of a German Octoberfest which is more pale and on the lighter side for its style. Nothing extraordinary but a good beer nonetheless."
"Anyways, in summation, one of my favorite Midwest breweries, one of my least favorite and seemingly unadventurous brews from them. Mild taste, some would call it smooth I guess if they're fans of it. I guess if you like a mild brown ale with more carbonation, this is your thing."
"Notes: I'd say this is my favorite American Octoberfest, and probably favorite Marzen period. It's not my favorite style, but New Glarus sure crafts their beers right. When I'm in the mood for a malty autumn beer next year, I'll definitely pick up some Stags."
"Drinkability: This is an easy beer to drink. Well bodied, nice malt aroma and flavor with a small hint of earthy hops. While my list of beer to try is ever so large, I could see picking this up again in the future to celebrate the end of Summer and coming of Autumn."
"This is a very good oktoberfest. If the mouthfeel were a bit crisper without the astringent bite it'd be even better and more drinkable. Still, one of the better domestic ofests I've had. Worth seeking out."
"Another solid offering from NG."
"I was very impressed with this and consider it the best American Octoberfest I've ever had. Drinkable, and flavorful with none of the off notes that I often perceive in the style."
"D- For how light this beer is, it has quite a bit of flavor. Really easy to session, considering the alcohol content. Very nice beer and easily one of the best Oktoberfest's I've had."
"Drinkability: I highly recommend as a lighter octoberfest - this ain't the beer you have to commit thirty-forty minutes to drink. If you want to sample some other beers after - this beer won't stand in the way - its simple, to the point, yet savory all rolled into one. I highly recommend. Thanks to a friend from WI - I was able to savor a few of these while in Cincinnati."
"The body on this is a little on the light side. A bit more watery than I would like, but still decent. Nice slight bittering hops at the forefront, but has a nice crisp finish of fresh bread and toasted malts. This is really good. Some of the characteristics could be tweaked a bit, but it's good where it counts: flavor."
"Looks very nice when poured into a glass mug. Dark reddish copper big frothy head. Toasty, bready malt a little grapefruit in the nose. Nice smelling beer. Nice tasting beer too. More malty toasted grain than hop presance, but the hops are in there. Nicely balanced brew. This is very crisp and clean, no unwanted flavors. Creamy malty mouthfeel. This is by far the best thing I have tried from New Glarus. Best Oktoberfest around in my opinion too."
"Bottle via trade thanks to badbeer. Pours a clear light amber color with a foamy one-finger white head. Aroma is caramel, grain, earth, and mild toast. Flavor is pretty well-balanced, but not amazing, with sweet caramel malt, mild roast, earth, toffee, and some hop bitterness. Palate is smooth and crisp, and body is medium-light. This is nice for the style, but nothing to write home about overall. Drinkability is high."
"pours a nice copper/orange color with a small head like most marzen/fest brews it looks good the smell is bready malts and toasted caramel ..the taste is way good its a smooth malt and bready crisp hops..a very well balanced Oktoberfest..MMMM..this one is good..NG makes world class brews and this one is outstanding this is by far my favorite marzen to date on a style that is not my favorite but of course this time of the year i drink plenty..this one is highly recommended for its superior well crafted representation of the style... its just a beautiful tasty brew.. find this one or trade for it ...im glad NG is so close to home"
"The beer is medium bodied with moderate carbonation with a soft and clean mouthfeel. This is one of the best Oktoberfests I've had. Highly recommended."
"Very nice, very easy drinking beer. Like this one."
"drinkability is decent. very drinkable, but only because the brew lacks any distinct characteristics. not the best brew from New Glarus, but worth a try."
"The beer is a copper/orange with a white head. The nose isn't very big on this beer, but it has a nice bready/biscuit note that comes through. The flavour is full of bready/toasty flavours with a slight hop bite. It's creamy smooth, and easy to drink. Some sweetness comes through, which is unexpected. I don't have much to say about this beer, except it's solid. Another great beer by New Glarus."
"Poured into the perfect pint glass, this beer showed an amber body, not red as the label description suggests, and a puffy white head. Aroma is of ""clean"" malt, I don't know how else to describe it. Medium bodied with a bready, biscuity but also straw-like malt flavor that becomes less appealing as I drink. I had much higher hopes for this beer, but I found it to be kind of boring overall. I'm sorry to say I won't be picking up a 6 pack this year."
"Overall, this is not a bad beer; it's just that I expected something a little more style-consistent from the folks at New Glarus, and this seems not to be an Oktoberfest but some strange hybrid."
"(D)- A great example of the style. Straightforward, but the balance creates interesting complexities. Nothing out of the ordinary; just plain good beer."
"D-It is an everyday beer when in the transformative season."
"12 ounce- copper orange- excellent clarity. Sticky off white head. Nose- grassy hops, candied fruit. Taste- bready biscuit malts, touch of caramel sweetness higher than expected hoping giving a dry finish. Very drinkable. Carbonation level is good and body is spot on. Well crafted brew."
"Almost no head, at least nothing that stayed around from any amount of time. Lacing from swirling doesn't last either. Smell is lager yeast at best, maybe some malts there too, but barely there, my friend smelled a fart in the glass, not mine either. Taste is actually not bad, sweet, but not overly, light crisp body, balanced mouth, medium carbonation. For a style I don't generally go for, this isn't a bad example. Cheers to Taturbo for the brew."
"Not a great flavor profile. There are a lot of complexities to the malt but it's drinkable and tasty. Good brew."
"Pours deep dark amber colour with solid two fingers off-wite head. Lots of lacing. Smell - malty, slightly bready, slightly fruity. Taste - very malty and bisquity upfront, bready, sweet and fruity (plums?) afterwards. Sweet, honey-like finish. Very good. Very rich and smooth, very balanced. Great stuff. Drinkability - good."
"D: A very nice lager beer. I'd be content with a six pack for a April-shower filled weekend."
"A strong pour gets an inch and a half of rocky tan head that fades in minutes leaving only slight dots of lace. Body is a deep mahogany amber in color. Nose has tones of rustic spices, limestone and some sweet malt to balance the minerals. Minerals and malt are the first things to show through as you start to drink. Then a nice crisp feel really makes this beer standout on the middle of the palate. A crisp dry almost green apple likefel comes about on the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel reminds me of a good German Pilsner, refreshing yet rich and rustic. I could dring these all night and year round. I wish I'd bought a case or two."
"Drinkability- Probably the best Oktoberfest I've had. The Scratch 13 was damned good but I think I prefer this one. It seemed to have a really nice balance between the nutty and toasty with just a kiss of hops at the finish. Tasty stuff that I'll actually stock up on next year come October and I have a craving for Oktoberfest's again."
"Overall: Very drinkable and refreshing. Well balanced, with a nice subtle yeasty smell and flavor."
"Pours a see through reddish brown with nice white head that lingers a fairly long time. Nice carbonation running up the sides continuously. Smells of caramely malts and slight citrus hops. Very crisp refreshing brew, starts with a nice sweet malty backbone with tinge of hops to round it out, very balanced beer that's very easy to drink(which is pretty much NG's standard when it comes to the 6packs). Nice beer overall, it has been my favorite Wisconsin Oktoberfest for a couple of years now, I can't drink a capital okto once I've had a Stag. Nice brew."
"M&D: It's a smooth drinker and it would be easy to put 3 or 4 of these back on a fall day for sure. It's going to be hard to find now but keep your eyes open for it!"
"Drinkability: Sure. This one's fairly solid and, though it may be a little stale, I can detect what was once a pretty dang good beer. Plenty of solid, reasonably complex malt notes alongside an understated balancing bitterness and hop presence and a reasonable abv% make this one pretty drinkable, as well."
"M/D - Full bodied and sily smooth. An incredibly easy drinker. A touch light on the carbonation but still a great feel."
"Dissapointed."
"D= An outstanding festbier and one I will surely seek out again next year! Very drinkable, highly sessionable."
"D - This is a great o-fest. It is great tasting and very drinkable."
"Overall a real surprise, this beer is very good and probably the best Octoberfest I ever had. I wish I could get this in my area, I would love to drink this in September and October. Well done New Glarus, your first beer I tried I loved!"
"D-A very enjoyable beer...not a style I usually seek out, but I will make this one an annual grab."
"Overall, despite not liking the Oktoberfest style, this is the best one I have had."
"that fine line between sweetness and dryness. Good 'un."
"Pours an orange brown color with magnificent clarity and a sturdy medium sized white head that leaves some sticking. Nice nose of sweet roasted malt, fire wood and a sweet nuttiness. Much is the same with its flavor, nothing offensive going on here. Incredible drinkability."
"highly recommended and worth seeking out."
"Big thanks to demcorhip for throwing this in as an extra in a trade!"
"Great drinakability, another winner from from New Glarus!"
"D: My idea of the perfect session beer. I can throw this down all night. Not even finished with the 1st glass, and wanting to pop another."
"Just a quick little foam after a good that disappears in the blink of an eye. Great deep amer with some ruby hues, but practically no bubbling. Heavily toasted malts with a lot of straight, unmilled grain aromas. With just a touch of herbal hoppiness in the aroma. Very bready and grainy. This is close to what the ld school German octoberfest tasted like. Heavy toasted malts, and in this case, grassy/minty hops balancing things out a bit. The palate is a bit rough in the begining of the palate, but smooths out towards the end. This beer could use some smoothing out."
"Thanks again, Nick."
"D: A very drinkable fall offering. Not stupendously complex, but a solid all-around brew. Another quality beer from New Glarus."
"Clear amber body with golden highlights around the edges. Big, three finger white head with ample lacing. Aroma of husky, grainy malts, not much in the way of caramel like so many other American OFests, but I like that. Nice and traditional. Clean flavor of toasty malts, sufficiently sweet, slightly hoppy, a little herbal, and a little floral. Light carbonation, yet crisp. A very nice OFest, and even though the ABV is over 6%, is drinkable as hell and could see myself putting back a few of these on a nice Autumn evening. Probably the best American OFest I've tried."
"This is a very tasty Oktoberfest whose greatest asset, I think, is how smooth and easy drinking it is for me. Nothing big and bold here, just a solid interpretation of the style. Another winner from New Glarus."
"Poured a nice crystal clear amber, but the head was disappointing and disappeared quickly. Malty aroma with a bit of citrus. Malty taste too. Medium carbonation. Nice hoppy finish. Very fresh tasting beer with medium/full body. Very drinkable. Could tell it had a higher ABV after a couple of drinks due to a little alcohol warming. I liked everything about this beer, but that doesn't help make it anything special. I'd buy more, but wouldn't make a special trip or pay extra for it."
"D- This beer is very clean in flavor even as it warms."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Opens with a bit of caramel sweetness, but this is actually more on the dry side. Toasted whole grain bread with fruit preserves comes to mind. Herbal hops linger in the background. The finish is dry and crisp but only mildly bitter, ideal for Autumn quaffing. Great stuff here, much better than many American attempts at the style."
"Worthwhile purchase, wish New Glarus was available in Indiana."
"D: Good flavor and mouthfeel make this an easy drinker. Definitely would be easy to knock down an entire six-pack of these."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours a very clear copper color. There was a very small white head on it that went away almost immediately. The aroma is caramel malt, and some slightly spicy hops. It has a very clean and crisp taste. Caramel malts with some spiciness. It is a very well executed Oktoberfest."
"This stuff is so clean and so smooth, its kind of remarkable how much flavor they still pack into it. One might say its the slightest bit ""boring"" with its unadulterated mellow malt flavor, but nobody should complain about its taste and craftsmanship."
"D- hard to put this one down. id definitely go for a second and a third. sorry this is only a seasonal, one of the better examples of the style."
"Pretty good beer overall. I've been trying many Oktoberfests lately due to the availability this time of year and this one certainly does stand out as one I would love to drink again."
"I would recommend this beer. Best Oktoberfest I've had in recent memory. I bought this bottle at Three Cellars in Franklin, WI."
"This seasonal brew pours copper and foamy, pretty typical appearance for an American Oktoberfest. Aroma is not stong, but the taste is satisfying. Toasty malt, no caramel, but some sweetness, with a dry finish. Satisfying mouthfeel and highly quaffable."
"D - an easy drinking, good tasting brew."
"Nice beer, not my favorite from New Glarus, but a solid offering."
"I like most New Glarus beers but there are a few I just don't get. This one goes on that list. The high ABV does not aid in drinkability."
"Pours a dark amber with a medium sized head. The roasted malts are the thing that really stick out to me about this beer, and is something that hasn't been matched in the other oktoberfests that I have tried. That being said, it is the best oktoberfest that I have tried, beating out Capital and Great Lakes, among others. I am definitely going to go pick up some more before the season is over."
"This is another strong beer from New Glarus. The more Staghorn I drink the more I want to drink. This stuff continues to grow on me. This is one of the best of the style I've come across."
"D: The ABV is a little higher than I'd like but this is a very easy drinking beer"
"Pours a stunning clear red-copper hue with a one finger off-white head that falls to thin layer which eventually disappears. Some bits of stickiness here and there on the sides, but not much to speak of. Scent consists of toasted grains, mild caramel and crystal malts, and a some metallic notes. An interesting pepper and spice with an earthy hop tickle the nose as well. Pretty tame smell overall though. Taste begins with some roasted nuts and pale malts with a bready characteristic. Midway some sweet caramel and honey with a light dry pepper flavor in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light to medium with a strong carbonation sting and a crisp body. Drinkable? You betcha, especially with the surprising 6.5% abv. Not a bad O-fest, but I expect more from New Glarus. Thanks again Joe for this extra!"
"Super quenching. I had a pint of Point & a Capital Brewing Co. O-fests also and this NG one blew the other two away. It is so smooth that it is probably not to style, but I don't care. I love this beer and am going to stock up on some."
"Comment I really like this one a lot. It has a pretty complex taste, but not too much flavor that over whelms. Just right for drinking one or having more than a few."
"It pours to a medium copper color with a nice 1"" plus head. Good lacing throughout. Mostly maltiness on the nose - some caramel and honey present. Similar taste profile here with the malts dominating. Where this beer excels is in drinkability. It slides down almost too easily - quite sessionable on a nice late September evening."
"It is very drinkable. I enjoyed it last year and was anticipating Staghorn for the last few weeks."
"Not a very exciting beer...I've had more flavorful Oktoberfests...it went down easily and without any glaring faults, but it's a little timid and the sour/tart finish I could've done without. I prefer a bit more flavor and/or depth and/or character in general, and hoped for something maltier in this particular beer. Not at all bad, just one I wouldn't go out of my way for again."
"This beers comes out of the bottle a beautiful honeyish amber brown. Smells like fall to me. Brilliant wheaty malted aroma. Honey, vanilla, floral notes come together like a mountain meadow in fall. This beer just screams autumn and the outdoors to me. The taste is not at all a letdown. The malt is predominant--with robust caramel--and a delightful tinge of hoppiness is a lovely counter. Sweetness and bitterness combine ohh so well with this beer. It really has an extraordinary balance and flavor profile for an oktoberfest, well for any medium-bodied beer for that matter. Body is crisp and medium with a favorable creaminess to it. Some cooked apples come through eventually. A cracker this one."
"I haven't had a lot of this style but this is the most enjoyable of the ones that I've had. Worth trying if you can get it."
"Think I waited to long on this beer. Pours a bright clear reddish orange malt with a small beige head. Smell is sticky, stale, gooey malt with band aid qualities and metal. Probably not as it was intended. Unappealing malt flavor and metal as well."
"A nice marzen that is very enjoyable. I can definitely drink these all night and might be looking for some come next September."
"Thanks Lordsloth for the trade!"
"Flavour is juicy and full of apples and pears then followed by a bit of nuttiness and lots of grain. Damp earth, then some peppery spice. I'm not going to lie, this is more than a little bit sweeter than I would like, a bit more balance would be lovely. Mouthfeel is very wet and almost watery with a bit of stickiness in the throat, carbonation is very mild. All in all, one will do, this is a very sweet Oktoberfest and I prefer a little more balance on the palate."
"Drinkability- I can think of a good handful of oktoberfest's that I would rather drink but many are not as clean and crisp as this."
"I think i need to give this one another go around this fall, but it is definitely one i want to try again and did enjoy."
"Overall it's malty and smooth with a nice bready malt flavor and lager sweetness. The appearance is a clear orange-amber without much head retention. It reminds me a lot of Hacker-Pschorr's O'fest beer for being a little big, but very smooth. There's a slight mineral note with the bread loaf aroma, which I suppose is appropriate for a German style lager. There's also a dry, biscuit and toffee finish that's quite pleasant, and hints of herbal hops around the edges. This is a beer I'd be happy to fill my stein with. Cheers."
"D: Very easy to drink and no cloying or overpowering tastes make this one very sessionable."
"D - Good beer. This is a good Octoberfest beer."
"Pours a orange-ish yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, a malty sweetness. As for the taste, again a dry malty sweetness that is quite balanced. A smooth malty mouthfeel and a clean and dry aftertaste. Sweet and malty, dry end and a decent oktoberfest."
"Drinkability: Pretty tasty. I will defeninitely keep my eyes open for this beer next season."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a nice golden amber color with a 1/2 inch white head that lasted for a while. My first whiff was of strong roasted malts. My first sip was full of strong graininess with a snap at the finish. This beer clean and refreshing throughout the drink. Carbonation is key in releasing the wonderful balance of this beer. This is a great example of an Oktoberfest beer. Definitely worth a try, but you may have to wait until next year as I snagged this from a friend whom forgot he had it in the back of his fridge."
" ~ I am very please with this brew. I recommended many a friend try the Staghorn this past fall."
"I would happily enjoy this one while relaxing at any taproom. This is a beer that I would want on draft to experience the nuances over the course of a liter or so. I feel like one bottle doesn't let you get to know it enough."
"Of all the Octoberfests I've tried this fall/winter, this is my favorite (considering SurlyFest has been changed to Rye Beer). Finally found a fest beer that hits the right spot between sweetness, dryness, and alcohol level."
"Another good balance of malt and hops emitting spiciness that resulted in a good brew."
"Drinkability - This is the kind of beer that consoles you when the summer's over. Very tasty, even quaffable. And its from a fantastic local brewer."
"Mouthfeel perfect, crisp. Flavor is dry toasty malt with a clean, dry finish just a touch bitter. Very refreshing and drinkable, easy to down this one rapidly and reach for more. Great job with the style."
"Very solid Oktoberfest here from New Glarus. Nothing earth shattering, but a beer I could easily drink several of on a fall night."
"Drinkability, like I said earlier, near perfect balance."
"overall, i really enjoyed this brew and hope that theres another 6er sitting at the beer store"
"[Served chilled, in a mug]"
"Now this was an excellent Oktoberfest beer! I have had plenty of them this year but this one really stood out to me. Luckily received it in a BIF or I never would have even known about it. Poured a nice bright amber with a good hint of orange. The ample carbonation led to the formation of a nice thick white head of lace about two inches tall. Good retention left behind some nice concentric rings of side glass lace and a nice frothy film on top. The aroma was very crisp, fresh with a nice grassy tone, some bready malts lingering in the back. The flavor followed right along, coming through with a big backbone of bread like malts with a very nice grassy kind of twang to it. Some nice little nuances of spice hiding in the back and a good little dry hoppy like finish to it. Nice light to medium body and ample carbonation gave a great smooth feel and this one was defiantly a winner. I was thrilled to have gotten the opportunity to try this one. This was the best of all the Oktoberfest I had this year. It had such a nice balance of flavor and session ability that it was unmatched. The great little bursts of flavor and extra little pop that seemed to be in it just pulled it apart from the crowd. A really great brew and absolutely perfect for the season. Will be looking for this next year."
"Fairly light body and little carbonation make it easy to drink. One of my favorite oktoberfests."
"Courtesy of someone awesome! The aroma is sweet malts, lightly toasted with hints of fresh honeyed biscuit. The body is a dark orange amber and holds a diminishing off white head. The first sip offers a somewhat dry toasted malt flavor with a bit of sweetness toward the swallow. Has some almost nutty notes. Lightly toasty again. It finishes dry with a bread-like grainy kiss of sweetness. Decent, but different."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, excellent representation of style, this is a beer that is well-worth drinking for a whole evening. I could see myself plowing through a six-pack with ease and enjoying each sip."
"The whole package makes for a very drinkable brew. The light to medium body makes for a tasty, refreshing, and fairly sessionable beer. The only obstacle is the alcohol which at 6.25%, would start to catch up with the drinker somewhat quickly. A brew I've enjoyed before, and helped get me into taking beer much more seriously, and a brew that im glad to have back after a year hiatus. Hope to see and drink it again next year."
"D - Overall a pretty good Oktoberfest, probably the best I've had this year. Might seem a bit thin and bland if you drink it too cold."
"Pours a dark copper red with thin head that laces down the glass. Smell is biscuity, sweet malt, and a touch of citruis hop. Has the malty flavor of a marzen, but subtle compared to other o'fest brews. Higher level of hops compared to the traditional German Marzens. Mouthfeel is good carbonation is where it should be, leaves a pleasent malt aftertaste that is not overpowering but reminds you of what you just drank. Overall enjoyable, I think it could be a little better, but only because New Glarus has put out outstanding brews before. A keeper for sure."
"D - Very tasty. I think this one could hang with any of the German Oktoberfests."
"Pours a beautiful, crystal clear, amber color. Head retains well. Smell is slightly floral, biscuity, and a hint of a lager-like smell (light DMS?). Pretty balanced between the malt and the hops; seems to have a higher level of hop flavor and bitterness. I seem to remember a rich smell of fresh malt, similar to that at the brewery or when I'm homebrewing, this doesn't seem to have it as much. Carbonation is medium and it's medium bodied; sits pretty good on the tongue. Pretty damn good beer, better than my numbers may reflect, but doesn't seem to have the huge malty aroma jumping out at me like the previous batch."
"This beer pours a clear bronze color with red hues. The head is small, and recedes quickly into no lacing. The aroma is of caramel, biscuits, and grass. The taste is like the aroma, but with some nice nutty flavors appearing in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is quite thin for an Oktoberfest, while the carbonation is nice. Overall, this is another overhyped, disappointment from New Glarus. It isn't bad by any means, but I don't think its so good that I would search for it."
"D-A really good beer but the more I drink of it the less appeling it is. I would still have to say Spaten is #1 IMO."
"Pours a rusty copper color with a nice finger worth of fluffy white foam. Aroma is spicy, some apple, salty water?, fresh earthy hops, and little roasted malts. Taste is much like the aroma but more fruity and malty, and some bread and yeast flavors. Mouthfeel and carbonation are both medium. Easy to drink but I guess its not my favorite style of beer."
"All in all one of the better ""octoberfests"" out there. A little too nutty for my taste however."
"Flavor is wonderful. The body is rich and full but at no point overpowering or filling. The tongue rolls in waves of toffee and toast. The malts are just huge but this never seems unbalanced. Each sip finishes with a nice dose of herbal/floral German hops. The palate dries just enough to want another sip of the sweet, malty brew. Perfectly drinkable. My favorite American Oktoberfest hands down."
"D: Very nice Oktoberfest. Would have like the head to have a bit more volume, think it would have aided in the mouthfeel overall. Again, another nice beer from New Glarus. This one really grows on you as you drink it too. Yearning for another one now."
"D - had a couple back to back. Nice brew for easy drinking."
"I can tell this would have shone in it's day hopefully New Glarus will bring this one back next year."
"A drinkable beer but should be ""bigger"" in texture and flavor to match the style."
"Drinkability is solid if not a little one dimensional and boring."
"This oktoberfest poured a clear, coppery color with creamy, tan foam that settled but clinged a bit to the glass. The smell was rich and malty with a hint of hops. The taste was malty and rich with a light Munich malt flavor. There were notes of fruit and caramel, and the hops came out in the finish. The mouthfeel was dry with medium body and good carbonation. The finish and aftertaste were malty and hoppy. This was a good take on a märzen."
"-UF"
"Bottle smuggled back from my trip to Madison. The code 04327 72 1949 is printed on the bottom of the bottle."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a creamy 1"" light tan head over the reddish copper brew. Head fades slowly, with heavy coating lacing. Aroma is nutty malts, with hoppiness present, but not dominant. Flavor is as the nose indicated, nutty grains and sedate hops balancing each other, just what I would expect from an Octoberfest. Mouthfeel is soft over the tongue, and the only thing that may detract from the drinkability is the sweetness starts to become prominent. Definitely an enjoyable brew that could be revisited."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"cool label, a little out of sorts for the typical new glarus 'color-on-white' style. dark beer, dark label? i dunno. regardless, this beer pours reddish brown and rather clear with a thin, consistent layer of tightly-packed film. intricate oval patterns on the surface. little to no lacing. aroma is smoky, sweet malts with rich, tangy fruits like near-ripe apricots and plums. some gluey notes and tea leaf aromas give it an 'off' character. mouthfeel is somewhat abrasive for something so smooth... tangy metallic hops meet an odd sour flavor in the finish. gingerbready malt adds some good flavor and then excessive fruit and sharp alcohol emerges.. essentially falls apart, becomes a mess in your mouth. does not hold up to similar marzen o-fests, see hooker."
"Doesn't blow me away, but is better than average. Enjoyable."
"Pours solid coppered brown color with a finger of head that falls to a light ring over top. Nose is god balance between toasted nuts and toffee, with a hint of roastyness in the back. Flavor is fairly on with the nose. Toasty, nutty, very light roast and toffee sweetness. Feel is moderate with a light to moderate carbonation. Overall, I really enjoy this for a fest beer. Nothing obtrusive and very tasty."
"[ serving type: bottle ]"
"This is a great example of the style. The ABV is perhaps a bit high for the style but is very settling."
"This Octoberfest pours a rich ruby red, almost brown, color. Medium white head rises and fades rather quickly. Aroma is a bit weak with caramel and spice and maybe a little hops in there. But what lacked in aroma more than was made up for in flavor. This is a really rich beer with a nice thickness to the body. Flavor begins with a nutty caramel maltiness and that's the main flavor, it holds throughout. Toasty bready and yeasty flavors coming in underneath. Lighter fruits and spices from hops come as I go further. Finish is drier but leaves me with a bit of the caramel flavor and makes me want to drink more. This is really a great Octoberfest and one everybody should try to get."
"football and oktoberfest beer, what a great time of year."
"great Wisconsin octoberfest."
"Drinkability -- I think I'll be able to polish off this six pack and buy another."
"This beer pours very nicely and has a beautiful, deep amber color that is crystal clear. I would have preferred a little more aroma, but there was only a hint of carmel and very little hop presence to my nose. Taste is very solid, a typical flavorful German Oktoberfest ""marzen"" . Like most New Glarus brews, the mouthfeel is smooth, and you could easily drink these in quanity. A nice local Oktoberfest, with a smooth finish."
"overall: thanks again to dirtylou for sending me this in a trade. i'm not a big fan of octoberfests, but this definitely shows some promise. excellent malt profile, but not too sweet. very drinkable, crisp and refreshing."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Malty with mellow carbonation. This is a really enjoyable marzen that I could easily have a few of. If you enjoy the style...make sure you find a way to sample this one. Quite a treat."
"drinkability: I look forward to many saturday afternoon's watching Notre Dame win and NC State lose while drinking these guys!"
"Pours a vibrant amber color with a smallish snow-white head. Smell is malty up front, spicy and citrus notes round it out. Taste starts off strongly malt and finishes with a spicy/lemony hop kick. Mouthfeel is very crisp, could use a little softening around the edges but overall stays quite drinkable. A nice little marzen here, not the best I've had but tasty nonetheless."
"Purchased at the brewery, 5th bottle of the six pack."
"12 ounce bottle. Copper colored with a large, creamy head. Caramel and apple aroma. A roasted nutty smell too. Nutty malt flavor. Very yeasty. Just a little hop flavor. Some spice in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium. The carbonation is pretty light. Great drinkability. This would make a very good session beer. I've had most of New Glarus's beers, and this is one of my favorite."
"Mouthfeel is medium. This beer is pretty easy to drink, and I really enjoy the toasted malt flavor, but it's basically just a solid amber lager."
"Thanks to kmpitz2 for sharing one of these with me. It pours a light amber color with a small head that dies off quickly and leaves a small amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is malty with a nice caramel smell. The flavor was a mixture of a nut brown and smooth caramel. Very nice. The mouthfeel is right where I want it, moderately thick. One of the best Oktoberfest's I've had."
"good oktoberfest, little plain though. worth a try if you like oktoberfest and have already had most other offerings, or want to try them all."
"Thanks to the beersters on the Great Lakes board for reuniting me with a long lost friend--made a run to Woodman's in Kenosha and cleaned them out of this seasonal brew. In short, it's about as good as I remember with the exception of a mild tinniness that I could do without. From the beginning... a beautiful beer, a sort of deep amber that fits the time of year. Bisque-colored head that lasted a good long while. The nose to me is extremely floral and the taste is not partcularly hoppy, sweet but not too much so. Slightly tinny aftertaste that I hope does not taint the rest of the 3 cases I bought. All in all, it's good to be home."
"Soft and delicate in the mouth with light carbonation and medium body. A very nice Oktoberfest, definately going to be kicking it with this one for awhile. The softness just makes it easier to throw back."
"Picked up this cervid-inspired beer at Chicone's during a recent five state border run. Pours a ruddy, leathery, fall-oak-leaf brown, with brassy highlights. Has a soft, medium-sized dark-white head. Smells of brown sugar, biscuits, caramelized carrots, and spicy hops. Taste starts off with spiced carrot cake, mild sweetness that turns nutty and biscuity as the hops come in and attack the side of the mouth. Hops are fresh, spicy, and adequately balance the malt. Finish has some tangy hop bitterness and a good dose of unsweetened cookie malt. Medium bodied lager with lots of malt AND that's not too cloying, but the carbonation seems a touch high. A very nice O-fest, but I didn't expect anything less from New Glarus."
"Another winner from Dan at New Glarus. Beautiful shiny amber body with super light, white, fluffy head. The aroma has some definate malt presence, but a also a bit of citrus action going on. It is a nice blend of both. The taste begins roasted and dry, but finishes much sweeter. The roasted, dryness lingers on the front of the tongue and roof of mouth. The mouthfeel is a little uneventful. Overall, a great Octoberfest for all!"
"Carbonation seems turned up a bit to much for this style. This beer tastes much different than I remember it tasting a few years ago. I may have had a old beer or a bad 6 pack and will review when I buy it again next year as every beer in the six pack had the same off taste as the beer warmed."
"Thanks to jeffboo for this treat!"
"Great looking beer...clean looking amber....looks like it came from the freshest spring in the world...the nose is soft, but exhibits some toasty notes..the taste is almost bock like....sweet without much balance from the hops....I like it, but the mouthfeel definitely leans more towards a bock. The taste is mainly toasted malts with very little hopping (I do get a very faint floral note)...The mouthfeel is slick and sweet and the sweet, slick feel is why I feel this leans towards bock territory....this was my most anticipated ""fest tasting yet, and maybe my expectations were too high...It's solid...I'd drink these all night if I could....but, it is not in the same class as my top 3 from this year (Hacker/Summit/Capital)...It is in that next level though....Worth buying a sixer of if you see it..."
"Solid darkish copper color with a small puffy off-white head that sticks around a while eventually fading to nothing as its consumed and leaves sheets of lace that dispear fast to stick in webby lines and spots. Wonderful toasted aroma on this, touch of caramel and light floral dried hops, very crisply toasted with a hint of ripe fruity-like sweetness reminescent of a sour bread dough. Really becomes a sniffer as it warms. Taste is a nice toasty, lightly sweet mix of maltyness, very solid through and through. Sweetness is strong but subdued in its presense over an amazing and great little toastyness, some thinner caramel sits in the back with some light herbal/floral dried hops setting up the finish to end with a nice mellow crispness and light lingering sweetness. Medium body feel, lightly creamy aspect and a lovely finish. A very nice O'fest beer that goes down with ease. A new favorite to keep around, top notch and a cut above alot of the mish-mashy O'fest brews that every brewery seems to make. This one is done right. Great job New Glarus! Toasty!!"
"Staghorn has become my #1 favorite Wisconsin-produced Oktoberfest beer."
"Acquired via trade. Very passable Marzen. Deep dark amber with a medium beige head. Strong malt aroma. Rich malt and caramel flavor with a nicely spiced finish. This is one of the better New Glarus beers I have tried so far. On a side note, I have really liked all of New Glarus' labels, very cool retro art."
"This is my favorite American Oktoberfest that I have sampled this year."
"This is a gorgeous looking beer. Clear deep copper with orange tinting. Carbonation is evident in the form of rapidly surfacing gas bubbles. A medium sized creamy beige head sits on top and sticks around for awhile. Lacing is sufficient. Nice toasted malt aroma. This beer has an excellent malt profile, with the toasted qualities really coming to the forefront. A nice refined sweetness is present, but not annoying or cloying. Hops are present to produce balance and that's about it. Not a lot of contributions to the taste, and that is not a bad thing for this style. Body is about medium-full and very creamy. Carbonated to perfection. After trying 15-20 Ofests this year, I'd have to say this is my favorite so far."
"On the top shelf, as far as Midwestern Festbiers go."
