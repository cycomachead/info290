"Overall I found this to be quite refreshing. And like I said, when I get a good Oktoberfest it always helps on the homefront."

"Slight head on the pour which ends up dissipating. Surprisingly minimal in carbonation, which allows some of the flavor to come out in a smoother body. So not a bad thing, in essence. Has a heavy bready, lager yeast feel here with a slight toffee note in there. A good beer for when the weather turns to Fall."

"Actually, this didn't seem very revolutionary. A nice, orthodox Marzen. Very smooth and  tasty."

"12 ounce can into dimpled mug; no canning date, but from 2013. Pours slightly hazy orange copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, pear, apple, floral, herbal, light pepper, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt and yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, toffee, floral, pear, apple, herbal, light pepper, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, toffee, herbal, floral, pear, apple, light pepper, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and robustness of malt and light earthy hop flavors; with a fair amount of yeast esters with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Oktoberfest style. All around good balance and robustness of malt and moderate yeast ester flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
"O - Not my style but a good, easy drinking beer."
""
"Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium to medium-low intensity, creating a full and mostly foamy mouthfeel that manages to never come across as fizzy. Closes dry, with moderate stickiness coating the palate and lips."

"(O)- I have not had many new Marzens this season so far, but I think this one really is a fantastic example of the style for me. Smooth, yet a good malt bill meets a nice rustic nutty graininess. Really digging alot of what Revolution is putting out and this is no different."

"O - cloyingly sweet, with some odd vanilla and cola notes I've never experienced with this style. Seemed more like a pop than a beer with all that sweetness."
""

""

"o: Easy to drink Oktoberfest. Although sweetness might get a bit cloying after a couple of these."

"Slight citrus flashes by, and the bready toasted malt base rolls through and lingers into the aftertaste. Toast, marmalade, lightly bitter noble hops in the aftertaste. Light to medium feel, easily drinkable. May not be the most traditional, but it tastes great."
"O- got this for free and was my drink of choice after work pretty nice with some sausage and rice but nothing i would buy unless its on tap just to make a comparison"

"This is a solid Oktoberfest. It's not bad, but it seems to get lost in the shuffle and almost seems forgettable compared to the other ones on the market, in my opinion."
"The body rests at medium with a good flow off a consistent carbonation ofeering a nice bite while smoothness is likewise consistent."
"Appears a deep copper hue with off white cream head, fine even spaced lacing looks great. Aroma has caramel malts, herbal hops kicking in the backend, with a complementary air of very refreshing beer. Lager in a can, I'm game especially microbrewed O Fest. Semi sweet malts bring nutty, earthy notes between the malts and Euro hops I'm very excited to sink my teeth into the rest of the 5 cans I have from the sixer I purchased. Slick oily yet clean and refreshing all in one gulp, I'm a big fan of this Chicago brewed lager, I do know they have a decent German heritage in Chi town this could have been brewed by a direct descendant or a rebel revolutionary who knows how to brew good beer. I'm a fan of the brewery, brewery, and brews that they produce. This is all around quality, go try some if you see the tuba touting lederhosen clad gent next to the fist of the revolutionary. Great artwork complements great beer, go try some folks."

"My favorite domestically produced Oktoberfest, 5 bones a bomber, and it singlehandedly justifies my stein purchase. A winner."
"Overall-- meh. This is a pass. I will be honest, this isn't really a style I go crazy over, but I try my best to review such styles with an open mind and a generous nature in terms of scoring. To be fair-- there is nthing offensive in this beer, but nothing that wows me either."

"O- really enjoy this Oktoberfest by Revolution. Sweet but to to sweet with crisp finish."

"Served on tap at Whole Foods Schaumburg. Appearance is a deep reddish orange with striking clarity. Dense white head leaves thin layer that retains, heavy lacing. Nose is full of deep grains, notes of lager yeast, caramel, an earthy hint of spicy grain in the vein of rye or pumpernickel. Taste is full of wonderful fall flavors, plenty of bready malts with deep caramel notes and a hint of spice. Bitter hops come through and balance out the malts with an earthy component. Mouthfeel is appropriate, maybe a tad high on carbonation. Overall, this Is a great and tasty version of a marzen. Worth a try (as are all Rev brews)"

"Is this a good rendition on a German Oktoberfest or a really well-made Amber Ale? The mild fruitiness in the aftertaste and the hop character leans me toward Amber Ale, but it's well worth trying."
"O: A very solid representation of the style, but it doesn't wow me. Very solid malty sweetness and the light hop backing adds another depth of flavor. At 4.99 this a great value and would buy again if i was in the right setting."
"O: A clean and pretty traditional Oktoberfest. Nice job guys!"
"Somehow, this is my first Revolution beer from the bottle. Go figure. It pours a clear copper-tawny topped by a finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises biscuit, light honey, light rye toast, mild spicy and earthy hops, and a tiny touch of deep fried chicken skin (...yeah, this is what came to mind...I dunno...). The taste brings in more of the same, though the hops are slightly stronger and lean a bit more floral now, and a pinch of black pepper is tossed in absentmindedly. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a nice, solid O-Fest, nothing spectacular or eye-opening, but something I could easily have a couple of beneath a tent at some big party of some kind..."

"O: A very good example, a fester should be stronger than a normal amber lager, but it has to retain a specific feel to it, many oktoberfests get stronger without the hops and end up very sweet, the others raise the bitterness but the hops flavor goes away and you are left with harshness, this one is a good balance, it is designed to be consumed in large quantities after all"
"Solid mouth feel and the beer went excellent with my food. I think this would be a great fest beer as it is tasty and easy to session."
""
"this is a good and solid oktoberfest. While there are grain tones to it, they don't dominate and instead we get some malty goodness"
"Clear copper in color. Served with a thin bit of white head. Decent lacing. Caramel malts and herbal hops, a slight metallic tinge in the aroma. Flavor is all malt: caramel, toffee, toast. Maybe some earthy hops, but the hops aren't the star of the show here. Mouthfeel is medium in body, but the heavy malts really round things out. Overall decent, but I didn't order a second."
"O - Drinkable, decent for the style. Can drink again with no complaints."
"D - It's a solid and true-to-style Oktoberfest offering and relatively easy to drink. Not my favorite style, but fairly enjoyable all the same. If you're into Oktoberfest beers, or even darker lagers this would be worth trying."
"Carbonation is perfect at a medium to high level and mouthfeel would be right there if the finish was dryer. Drinkability is very high though as it should be given a beer that should be drank in 1L glass steins."
