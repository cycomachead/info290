Taste gave the same impression, and I was surprised to know this was not a barleywine, technically. Very sweet, malty flavors. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and easy to drink.","LouZ","Feb 17, 2015"

As one reviewer said, this seems to be better suited as a holiday beer - served after thanksgiving.

Soft, sugary palate, sweet yet rounded - nothing cloying or overwhelming, just creamy oatmeal, molasses, and buttery biscuit with a hint of maple and vanilla. All in all, it comes together to make a dense, chewy beer that is very much "imperial" tasting (even goes down with a mild boozy kick on occasion)...but apart from being big and boozy, it just hits the spot. Equal parts dinner and dessert. Cheers.","BarryMFBurton","Sep 26, 2014"

Aromas of caramel, sugar sweetness, tuber veggies, earthy highlights, hints of toffee, earthy notes, and an overlaying highlight of roast.  Very rich and sweet. Flavors are rich and roasted forward, with a blast of caramel and toffee sweetness, a subtle bitterness in the backbone, char highlights, earthy and woody notes, and hints of booze.  Malt bomb for sure, but with a balance and drinkability that is impressive. The body is smooth and robust, but light enough to quaff.  Roasted sweet, rich, heavy aftertaste with a building warmth as you work your way through the bottle.  The finish is smooth and slick, with a slightly sweet, cloying linger that makes you want more.

4.1,5.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; Batch 9 bottled in August 2012. Pours moderately hazy reddish orange color with a 2 finger dense cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, prune, pear, apple, toast, biscuit, molasses, brown sugar, light nuttiness, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/toasty malt and fruity yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, pear, apple, raisin, molasses, brown sugar, biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, light pepper, and toasted/yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown sugar, pear, apple, raisin, biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, light pepper, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity and balance of dark/toasted malt flavors with moderate fruitiness; with big malt presence and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial Oktoberfest. All around great balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/toasty/nutty malt and fruity ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 20, 2013"

Pours a deep coppery red with very little head. Awesome color - just looks like a badass beer. Heavy cherry on the nose, malt, bread. Surprising melon element in the flavor, as well as strawberry. 10.2 abv, and absolutely no indication of it. Medium to full mouthfeel, and light carbonation. One of my favorites from the large format Avery brews. Really nicely done.","BeerWizard","Sep 15, 2013"
4.18,8,4,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"The flavors, and the feel, are thick, rich and savory. Mentioned to be an Oktoberfest, this has more elements of a barley wine. Proportional sweetness to malt dryness, the toasted grain mixes well with dried fruit elements. I catch a little date, prune and grape along with a some bran, barley and oat. Well balanced and awfully drinkable this is deceptively 10 pct ABV.","KYGunner","Sep 15, 2013"

It's more like a Belgian pale and a doppelbock had a baby. Don't get me wrong, the result is amazing, but it's just not really possible to compare it "within style" because Marzens aren't really comparable in any way. This is a very different league of beer.

Above average head retention and a significant amount of lacing is present on the sides of the glass. The inviting, rich aroma of caramel with accents of toffee is rounded out by some grassy notes. Initially, semi-sweet caramel joined by bready yeast. Finishes with mild grassy bitterness and mild phenol alcohol. Medium to low level of carbonation, medium to full-bodied with a slick and a slightly syrupy mouthfeel. Interesting "amped up" version of a traditional marzen. Defintely trends boozy, however the above average abv never dominates. An very original seasonal especially for "big beer" lovers.","chanokokoro","Oct 25, 2012"

The alcohol in the aroma is not noticeable in the taste. Medium bodied with nice carbonation for a pleasant mouth feel.

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, spices, pumpkin, fruit, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, spices, fruit, subtle sweet alcohol, pumpkin, subtle citrus, and subtle metallic. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. I had this one sitting in my cellar for quite sometime if I remember correctly. It seemed to have held up pretty well over the past year or so in my opinion. All of the flavors that would define this one as a Marzen were definitely still present and were very well mixed together. Was surprised to see the alcohol aspect around, but you can't win them all I suppose. Worth trying, even if it is a vintage bottle.","thagr81us","Nov 07, 2011"

There is quite a bit of dark fruit flavors, raisin, fig, and plum. There is some toasted malt flavor and some bitterness. There is a mild hop presence here as well as a touch of booziness. The finish leaves some lingering bitterness and sweet fruitiness. The body of this is on the heavier side of medium, and it has good carbonation. It goes down easy and has a chewy quality to it. Some alcohol warmth on the back end. This has good drinkability. It is a good beer, and definitely an interesting interpretation of the style. It is a super amped up marzen.

3.98,2.8,5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"This is a medium to full bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. For an imperialized version of an oktoberfest brew, this was done fairly clean and without much fault. However, as it warmed up it got to be a bit of a chore. If I could re-do the experience I would have served it colder as warming it up did not help it. However, it is to be noted how well this brew was done. My only gripe is the buttery aspect and along with the imperialization, it really lost that crispness I look for in the finish. Instead, it had a long drawn out toffee-sweetness and lacked that crispness which would have increased it's overall drinkability. Regardless, this was a nice change of pace and was an interesting experience. I would recommend giving it a try if you have the chance. Thanks again Brett!","stakem","Oct 16, 2011"
3.88,0.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"O - This beer is a pretty good marzen altogether...if you have it as a dessert beer.

Aftertaste is slightly bitter and there is an alcohol kick. This beer has a bubbly carbonation level with a crisp mouthfeel.

Poured from bottle into Brooklyn tulip. Pours a terrific dark amber color- perfect for the Oktoberfest style. Pour is pretty much crystal clear, no head at all, and plenty of alcohol legs on the glass. Smell- alcohol, caramel, toffee. The present alcohol smell is not appealing- makes me think I'm in for a sloppy boozy mess. Taste- caramel, cloying sweet malt, alcohol. This is a boozy mess of an Oktoberfest style beer. Interesting concept (Imperial Oktoberfest) but it doesn't work that well. This is gonna be a sipper, real tough to get down.","lnashsig","Sep 03, 2011"

Taste has a very strong, sweet malt, with masked bitterness from the nut and honey notes - lots of caramel malt and a very definitive Marzen character to it. While there is a bitter character to the malt, it is well buried in the full flavors of several types of malt. For an extremely malty beer, it lacks bitterness, though the sweetness is a bit overpowering. Very sticky, rich feel, feels syrupy. Not the most drinkable beer though, at it is extremely heavy, even if there is hardly a hint of alcohol.","Zodijackyl","Nov 04, 2010"

The smell is incredibly bready in nature, I'm sure the yeast saw to that. There is a lot on the nose, what I can detect (and I assure you it's not all of it) is mainly clove and cinnamon. Bits of orange zest round out the nose to a nice fragrantly potent smell. As I tasted it the first thought that ran through my mind was that this tasted like French Toast (don't tell the Kaiser, it'll upset him...at least until he conquers Belgium). The flavors comprising that are the bread, egg, and cinnamon most attributed with that combination. The only deviation from that flavor is there is a whiskey/boozy background flavor that reminds you this is more of a college breakfast than you wanted it to be. The mouthfeel is just a bit too syrupy for my liking with regards to the fact that there is a lack of carbonation to make it have that pop it needs. This beer is a bit too boozy and strong for me to say that I could drink it too often, but by no means is it bad. I recommend you try it.

4.43,14.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"I think it's great that Avery calls their Imperial series the "Dictator" series. It's a nice play on the imperial style. Tonight I've got a bomber of the Kaiser, which bills itself as an Imperial Octoberfest. 22 ounce bomber. Pulled out my dimpled mug for this one. Tradition and all. Pours reddish light amber with a fizzy head made up of small bubbles. Minimal lacing. Smell is of caramel and - can't believe I'm saying this - peach fruit rollups. I haven't had a fruit rollup since I was a kid. Low levels of carbonation present in the mouthfeel of the beer. Lends itself to a slick mouthfeel. The first taste gives you a huge caramel malt body and a gigantically warm alcohol finish. The lazy description would be to call this a malt bomb and wrap it up. That's not fair to the effort these guys clearly put into making this beer. Caramel syrup and toffee malt lends sweetness. Hops aren't at the front as with most styles. I get them more towards the middle of the drink, and they've got kind of a spruce type of flavor to them. Dried peaches and apricots are there too. But they're there only briefly, before more sweetness takes over and blasts you into a warming finish due to the high ABV. It's nice to finally see this beer back on the shelves. To me it's one of the beers I look for to let me know that, hey, despite it being nearly 100 degrees today summer is on the way out. This would be a great beer to enjoy in 50 to 60 degree temperates either outside camping or at your local football team's tailgate. I thoughroughly enjoy this beer, and in many respects it's the complete opposite of their summer seasonal. My only complaint is that it's not out nearly enough.","eclaycamp","Aug 28, 2010"

The aroma is subtle and sweet, almost no hop smell to speak of. The taste is strongly malty and sweet with accents of cherry, maple and maybe coffee. The hops again to me are light and nondescript. The mouth-feel is rich and moderately carbonated. I was surprise to see that the alcohol content is so high -- that does not come out in the taste at all. I'd be saving this one for a quaff now and then, don't see that I'd be knocking a lot of these back in one session; it's a little too rich for that.","rfabian","Nov 06, 2009"

Taste: caramel sweetness / toffee, nice floral hop profile, fruity - white nectarine, golden raisin, pale malt backbone, little bit of warming alcohol. Mouthfeel: heftier and softer than the usual crisp marzen, I like this. For the style, drinkability is horrible, and with zero head retention or lacing, it's not a looker. Still, an interesting take on the style (I can see the double marzen, but could also be described as somewhere around a pale winter warmer or a big maibock), a decent fall sipper, and worth a try for ofest collectors.","babaracas","Nov 01, 2009"

The alcohol (the bottle lists alcohol at 10.03% as opposed to what is listed above) is ever present and gives the beer a bit of a harsh, unrefined feel to it while the fruitiness is a little over the top.

These flavours are, though, all a bit muted under the fruity-spicey raisiny alcohol. It's on the sweet side, almost cloying but not quite. It's a bit frothy and gets a little to oily at the finish. it's a bit on the balnd side, but has some nice flavours, a hint of complexity, and fairly good balance. it's fairly drinkable.","Offa","Oct 22, 2009"

Aroma is like your normal oktoberfest but stronger in alcohol and dark fruit notes. Sort of English barleywine-ish. Taste is strong alcohol on top of normal Marzen flavors. The alcohol really is at the forefront, taking away from the enjoyment a bit. Toasty biscuit flavors with boozey warmth. Mouth is well-rounded and full with strong alcohol presence. Smoother in carbonation. The drink overall is pretty strong in alcohol flavor and this is a bit unpleasant.

This had much more hops than usual in an Oktoberfest (Magnum, Sterling, Tettnang, and Hersbrucker), lending some pungent cone aromas and a delicious but slightly bitter flavor to the extremely strong malt base. The malts are caramelly and biscuity, providing excellent counterbalance for Avery's choice of hops.

There I found, tucked at the back of their fridge, one lone bottle of this beer dated 2005! I asked the clerk how much for it and he said, "I don't know, I haven't seen it before". So I said, "You have to give me a price if I'm to buy it!" He said "Ok, ten bucks." I said, "What? You don't even know what it is! Six bucks." He thought about it and suggested, "Eight bucks?" I said, "Sold!" So I then added it to the box I shipped myself after the holidays. It arrived safely here in Vermont and I coddled it for another month before I finally opened it, four years after it was bottled, on Superbowl Sunday, February 1st, 2009. Out of the well-aged bottle the fluid was a cloudy, garnet/amber color with a lot of visible sediment. The head was thin, which was to be expected, but the retention was moderate as a beige skim that left thin streaks of lacing. The aroma was of caramel malt, hazelnuts, raisins, brown sugar and a touch of alcohol. The flavors were really stupendous, all the aging had done it well. It started with a nip of the alcohol and some fruity esters, then it went into caramel and toasted malt, toffee, light wood, hints of raisins and brown sugar. Despite being rich and sweet the finish was appropriately bitter and really balanced my palate nicely. The carbonation was soft, partly due to the age I imagine, the mouthfeel was smooth and the body medium/full. A great experience and a true find.","thekevlarkid","Feb 04, 2009"

Just a little much sweetness of caramel and toffee. Mouthfeel is a little cloying up front but also a bit overly drying toward the end.

The feel is fairly thick with good crisp carbonation, finishes sweet yet with a bitter hop aftertaste. An imperial style for the sake of being imperial. While the flavors are good, the additional alcohol is not needed. The doughy bready goodness that is an Oktoberfestbier is minimalized by the alcohol presence.

At first I was a bit skeptical, but having had a few Oktoberfests lately, I can say this is a good next step for those wanting a little something more robust and powerful.

Bits of cardamom and all spice peak through as well creating a strong pumpkin ale like scent without the pumpkin. First few sips present the spiced smells up front. Moves to a sweeter caramel and biscuit like character. Finish is dry and the alcohol mixes well with the spices to create a nice warming effect upon my cheeks. Deliciously smooth and medium bodied.

With aging potential that really smooths things out. This however is an '07 batch and it's fresh, malty with a hop bitterness on the finish. Rich toffee and caramel with sweet earthy cereal bready malts. Thick and creamy and a treat on a winter evening. Spicey earthy qualaties really show through with alcohol on the long finish.

It had a decent white head that settled into a constant broken foam. The aroma was very sweet - malty with caramel and fruit. Was almost too sweet smelling. The taste also was almost too sweet. In general, I'm not a huge fan of the style but find The Kaiser to be one of the few in it that I can have a couple times a year and really look forward to. Read a couple reviews that mention that a 12oz bottle would be better and I'd agree. Towards the end it gets to be too cloying but not enough to ruin it. Recommend.

D: It's definitely a good beer, but I do have to admit that as I continue through the glass I sort of wish this had more to say for itself. The hops are pretty distant and the sweet caramel nearly overrides everything. A huge malt profile is to be expected, but something seems off in the balance.

It is kind of neat but I probably won't buy again just because it has niether the warmth or complexity of bock and other high ABV beers, nor the refreshing qualitiesof German session beers, so it really fills no useful role in my cellar or fridge.

The flavor is balanced beautifully. Tons of alcohol in this one guys, being 9.3%. Very nice head buzz. Kind of reminded me of a lagered Barley Wine on a few sips.

The taste runs from sweet caramel, to a slightly tart and earthy middle, to a slightly bitter finish. The mouthfeel is the only real setback so far, it could use more carbonation, but it is fully bodied and silky in exchange for that. The drinkability is great, more than adequate for the ABV. I've only had a few imperial pilsners, and I loved every one, and I'd say this fits right in with those.

The beer maintains a thin head and leaves a long trail of lace. The carbonation seems just a bit too low and the mouthfeel is medium to full with a mouthcoating stickiness. The taste is mostly of caramel malt, balanced by alcohol and some hop bitterness. The finish is acidic, slightly bitter and a touch astringent.

The mouthfeel is good, a good balance with the exception of the strength. I enjoy this beer but feel it could be much better if they didn't go for high ABV. The flavors would come out more.

A great tasting beer with plenty of caramel malt, brown sugar, molasses and sweet potato with a dose of citrusy hops to balance out the sweetness of this O-fest. Alcohol is feintly present, but just enough to feel it on the face and in the flavor profile. I really enjoyed The Kaiser, Avery is always pushing the envelope and The Kaiser doesn't disappoint.

The head was white and fizzy and it faded away rather quickly. Smell was very light and had a definite presence of grain to it. Taste was alcohol, sweet malt, copper coinage, and in that order.

Flavor is actually pretty neutral, low bitterness but without a lot of individual malt flavors to pick out either, and without the spiciness of most examples of the style. Probably the closest approximation to my mind is the syrup in canned peaches, rather sugary overall (some bittering in the aftertaste, but that is true of most beer in general). Some alcoholic sense, but without a bitter or stinging hotness. Seems like a decent enough beer, but surprisingly not very distinctive in character.

At times the beer is reminiscent of an English style barleywine, probably due to the alcohol, but with a decidedly German malt profile. Its warming and fairly well balanced. It has a little yeast character and the fruitiness in the smell continues through the beer. I found it enjoyable, but despite the fact that I enjoy high alcohol brews, this one doesnt have exceptional drinkability. It doesnt have the cleanness that I expected. Regardless of that, however, the beer is certainly worth trying again.","Suds","May 21, 2006"

The flavor though is pretty good. It is a sweet beer but not too fruity, and no citrus flavor. The hop flavor is more resinous than anything.

Big and malty, lots of caramel, finishing sweetish and sugary. Not a whole lot going on besides caramel. Caramel up front, caramel dominating a little apple fruitiness, with a caramel finish. Definitely full bodied, pretty smooth, with milder carbonation. I could easily drink this after a few beers, but while I'm paying attention to flavor, it's completely uninteresting.

Palate shows a flourish of floral hops on the front, becoming overtaken by the presence of heavy caramel malt towards the back of the mouth. A hint of brown sugar is noticeable in a finish that includes a fairly heavy alcohol presence. Body is nice, moderately thick and just a tad bit syrupy, which is probably a necessity given the high alcohol content. The alcohol in turn makes this one a bit difficult to drink in quantities as large as 22oz, so perhaps you should find a friend to split the bottle. The concept of an imperial Oktoberfest is intriguing, and I have to say, this is probably exactly what it should be like. I'm pleased.","ElGordo","Oct 25, 2005"

This is followed by a touch of dark cherries and some bready notes followed by a rough alcohol edge.

With a little bit of an ethanol sting as well. Malts are sweet and bordering on cloying, but the ethanol keeps it in check. The more I drink this the less I like it. But the fact is, I thought I liked it pretty good to begin with. So this is not bad, but just not as good as I thought from the get go. Alcohol has more of a presence than I thought to begin with and it's also too sweet. Almost in a dopplebock sorta way. Toasted maltiness is lacking as is any sign of caramel.

Gentle hop bitter mixes well with the gentle smooth alcohol burn. Hop floral has got to be tettnanger. The 'dark' of this hop works to counter the light malt sweet.

But I didn't, I really didn't, and I didn't find this to be anywhere near a doppelbock either. It's a true fest, with the tautness and suppleness of a light lager, and a healthy autumn maltiness that is respectably close to style. The hops are somewhat obscured, though, and one would never mistake this for the real thing. The drinkability sucks, for one. You can only take small sips; otherwise the alcohol chokes. A far cry from a true Marzen which, while being somewhat weighty in alcohol, demands being drunk by the liter in rapid succession. The beer had a good head and some nice lace; a humdrum, wine-y aroma; a solid malt backbone with lackluster hops; a pleasing, watery mouthfeel; and a deliberate, painstaking drinkability. It's worth a shot, and may be the ideal beer for Oktoberfest fans who are also raging alcoholics. But to most, it will be just an interesting experiment.","Thrasher","Sep 20, 2005"

4.06,4.9,5,4,4,4,4,"When I first heard of this beer it made me stumble mentally a bit. A marzen is one of the last beers I would expect to get the "imperial" treatment. I poured this beer out of it's neatly labeled 22oz bottle into a glass tumbler. The body is a deep combination of ruby and orange and nearly perfectly translucent. A sticky tan head steams up radidly, but recedes rather quickly as well to a clingy coating about the edge of the glass and a thin greasy layer on top. Honestly this is one of the most attractive festbiers I've seen to date. The nose is very rich with malts, luxorious and velvetty. My nose is dominated by fruity and caramelly flavors, so fruity in fact that it makes me doubt the fact that this beer truly uses a lager yeast. Tiny hints of spicy euro-hop peep through the thick curtains of malt. As I take a sip I notice the luscious, velvetty mouthfeel, a little thick for a marzen but I enjoy it none-the-less. Caramel blends with sharp fruity flavors, caramel dipped pears comes to mind (again a bit out of character). The finish is biting with spicy hops, and phenolic punch. I do actually pick up on tones of muted lager yeast flavors which confuses me a bit. This beers warms my throat up quickly and as I sip I can feel it working it's way to my head already. Stylistically, I'd have to say this beer is out of character, however I think it's damn good. Styles be damned anyway.

4.28,10.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Taste was a big hit of malt up front followed by a very balanced hop dry finish. I thought the alcohol hit at the very end but was well blended in. As it wamred the alcohol came out a touch more but was still very pleasant. To me it seemed dangerously drinkable. All in all a very enojyable brew with a nice mix of malt and hop that I would certainly purchase again.","kegerator","Jan 10, 2005"
3.55,-8.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Poured a copper with nice, tight head. Malt and citric hops vied for dominance, with the caramel of the malt rising and falling back. Alcohol had a raw edge in the flavor profile. The beer was enjoyable, but not one that goes in a repeat lineup.","Brent","Jan 09, 2005"

Aroma is very malty and sweet, smells like an octoberfest all the way. Taste is initially malty, bready and sweet followed by a nice dose of german hops. Finished is rough due to the extreme alcohol tatse. Not balanced at all! Thr alcohol is not well integrated into the beer, it just stands out too much. It's strange to here these words come out of my mouth cuz I love strong beers, it's all I drink! Some might really enjoy this brew, alas, I did not!","AlexJ","Nov 26, 2004"

Taste of lots of malt, very big bodied Oktoberfest, creamy with lots of caramel malty goddness abounding. Finishes with noticable alcohol presence that brings the spiciness and hops to the front. This is a very big Oktoberfest that was quite a treat only draw back was the noticable alcohol flavor. Mouthfeel is leaning towards full, nice and creamy brew. Drinkability was good I would not mind to have this in the future. Want to thank melin48 for sharing it with me.","mntlover","Nov 21, 2004"

Just like it's other high-gravity cousins, this is also a winner (but c'mon, let's be honest, the Salvation kicks ass). All solicitation aside, these guys remain one of my favorite brewers, and the warm welcome I received at the brewery proves that these guys are deeply passionate about their beer, and good beer in general.","Mitchster","Nov 14, 2004"

Reminiscent of a Dead Guy, actually. Not certain if I like this experiment. It's not bad, but nothing to go ga-ga over. History tells me bad things tend to happen when Germans get imperial aspirations... thankfully this bucked the trend.","ManekiNeko","Nov 11, 2004"
3.63,-6.2,4.5,4,3.5,4,3,"Beautiful crimson in hue with influences of tawny-copper; tiny bubbles were noticed in the clear liquid, the animation was lively and raced quickly to the off-white head. The froth was two fingers in height at the apex, impressive. Head retention was very good, the majority of the foamy mass lasted for a long while. A tight cap lasted the entire consumption. Subsequent lacing was sticky, very widespread and organized. This is one of the most impressive looking O-fests Ive seen. The nose was cleaner than I thought it would be. Malt was the focal point, it was sweet and very wide but it encompasses a very limited range that covers caramel and chocolate covered toffee. Hints of dark fruit, cherries mainly, maybe some candied red apples. Suggestions of grain, some earthy hops but the spicy grass aromas are more noticeable. There are only weak indications of alcohol. The potency is moderate and I did have to work at it a bit to smell everything but I was rewarded. I liked the bouquet. Inviting. The palate is not quite as refined and articulate as the nose suggested. I am disappointed. Still, the beer has some merits. I dont believe this beer is really an O-fest. It is a Doppelbock. Also, the Imperial label is very lame. Summits Oktoberfest clocks in at 7.70% abv and it is much more refined, plus it doesnt bullshit us into believing it is a new style. Hey Avery, lay off the marketing and just make good beer. Can you do that? Upfront the beer is malty, fairly sweet and mostly caramel with just hints of apples too. In the middle there is noticeable suggestions of grain, biscuits, earthy hops and some spicy grass. So far the palate is pleasant and tasty. Simple. It is straightforward and well rounded. Only if this beer didnt have a finish because this sucker turns hot! It is way too raw, I mean cant they hide the alcohol? The finish is home to the cherries and toffee. Fusel, rocket fuel Jesus, Im breathing fire here! This beer is beating the shit out of my brain. It is way too harsh; the aftertaste is dry and unpleasantly bitter. Once this beer is boiled down to the basics it really isnt than complex or special and then you factor in the alcohol rawness and what is the point really? Basically this beer is a Malt Liquor Lager! Easy to drink if its your thing. For me, not so much as I find it pointless. I need some food if I going to finish this bomber. Somewhere around medium in body, moderate but appropriate carbonation, the mouthfeel is good; it is a little slick and kind of oily and, yeah, hot. I was shocked when I saw a bomber of this in Brookfield, WI; I gladly forked over the $6.00. In hindsight I have to ask why was I so enthused? It is drinkable, sure, I can finish the bottle but I dont need to drink it again. I can see why some people like this but for me it is not very well brewed, give me less alcohol and more malt and you have winner here. I say it is still worth a try if you see it. Decent.","bditty187","Nov 09, 2004"

3.96,2.3,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Sounded too interesting to pass up since an Imperial Oktoberfest is not something you come across every day. 22oz bottle with a picture of a Kaiser on the front. Appearance is a deep amber body with a tall off white head. Nice rings of lace were left decorating the glass as I drank this. The aroma of sweet malt and a bready smell masked the alcohol almost completely here. Still not a very complex smell. Malt sweetness dominates the palette along with a warming alcohol presence. A bit of a spicy sweet after taste lingers around for a bit. Mouthfeel is medium and almost full, definitely the thickest of the style I have had. Drinkability was fairly good, this is not where near a favorite style of mine but this is one I enjoyed. I would say give it a shot if you come across this.","meathookjones","Oct 12, 2004"

Thick mouthfeel supports flavors of apple, bread-like maltiness, a pow-pow-powerful hopping and a blast of alcoholic heat. The super long alcohol & hop show finish ends with alcohol felt in the throat...wow! I found this one to be an impressive take on the Marzen style, surely not for the timid of palate!

Transparent, cranberry orange beer with a few traces of lethargic carbonation. Malt flavor is sweet up front, but begins to fade as the alcohol kicks in towards the end. Body is on the light side.

Slight harshness from the alcohol. Finishes with a lot of residual sweetness. Thick on the palate. Drinkabilty suffers due to the harshness.

Smells of biscuits that have been marinating in honey and corn syrup overnight. Lots of sugar. I notice a sharp hop bitterness too. Taste...whew! Now that's sweet. The Kaiser wastes no time in letting me know that he has a heart of pure sugar/cough syrup. Slight biscuit flavors are quickly, and rudely shoved aside by melted pixy stix and alcohol. Luckily, some bitter (almost astringent) hops kick in at about the same time and tame the sweetness a touch. Still, too cloyingly sweet to drink much. Big, cloying mouthfeel.

The malts are nice and roasty, staying on my tongue along with just a bit of a hop to balance them out. This is a good tasting lager beer. Mouthfeel is thick, as I would expect from this monster.

Smooth and creamy with a velevety texture, it leaves a little of itself behind after every drink. Overall this is an exceptional brew from Avery and probably one of my favorites.

4.13,6.7,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Deep copper-red color with a huge, yet short lived cap of coarse foam. High ABV surely contributes to the rapidly diminishing head, but it laces a bit and leaves a thin film to soldier on. Aroma is a bit fruity with black cherry and a bit of alcohol sneaking in. Flavor is almost like a Doppelbock with powdery cocoa, toffee, and a bitterness strong enough to cut the sweetness, but not overshadow the subtleties of the malt. Mouthfeel is dead on for a big beer with lots of alcohol. Thick enough to ensure you pace yourself, but not syrupy. This beer speaks softly but carries a big stick. You miss the ABV till it's too late. Great beer, great name.","Sixpack595","Sep 12, 2004"

Nose is malt dominated, sweet and fresh to the senses, start is sweet with a delectable malt profile and the top moderate in its feel to the palate. Finish is strikingly acidic, the hops determined in their spicy bite with the aftertaste decidedly dry, another magnificent beer from one of my top ten breweries, and a fantastic label, my kudos to the great people at Avery once again.","Gusler","Sep 06, 2004"
