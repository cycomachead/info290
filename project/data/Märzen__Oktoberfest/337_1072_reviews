"Not a bad Oktoberfest, but St. Arnold could have done a little better on this one. It could use a little more on the nose."
""
"not a good attempt in my opinion"
""
"Actually an Oktoberfest ale!  Saint Arnold tried it as an ale and a lager and the ale was much more popular.  Very tasty!"

"Smooth, fruity, medium bodied, just enough hops and very surprinsingly good."

"I am very disappointed with this one - I always anxiously await the release of SA Oktoberfest, and have only been disappointed once, until now. This beer has nothing special about it, and quite frankly, is completely forgettable. I give it a 3 purely as a sign of respect to SA, because they generally do everything right.....Hey, everybody can have a bad day, and maybe it's just my palate, but I'm disappointed. Can't wait for the 2014 Christmas Ale to come out though! Love you Saint Arnold!"

"Overall: Drinkable with a nice malty body, but a bit too sweet as with some of Saint Arnold's other ale offerings."
"Overall:  So as far as the Märzen style goes, this features an ale yeast so its a bit creamier than most Oktoberfest and less of a crisp finish.  Besides that, this is still very tasty and enjoyable in the same price point at Sam Adams Oktoberfest.  This has more of a cloying finish than most Oktoberfests, so in my opinion this is just begging to be paired with a nice hearty fall meal.  Makes me want to smoke a brisket."

"Love this beer! Bought it in late September, and after the first six pack, I went out and stocked my fridge with enough to last me until late Dec. Looks like a golden amber autumn leaf, and smells as bittersweet as hooking up with a hot girl and not remembering it because you had too much to drink at Oktoberfest. It really just tastes like what beer should taste like, with perfect balance, and is by far one of the smoothest beers I have ever had. Each drink makes you want another, and against all of the other American Oktoberfest beers, this one is head and shoulders above. A must try!"

"This is an ok brew. It is fairly light and the initial flavor dissipates. That initial flavor has some good notes, but nothing that really stands out."

"Atmosphere is pretty decent. Slight head, no real lacing, lots of carbonation. Nose is sweet malt grains, molasses, with a woody character. Sweet and pungent. Overall, this is pretty good quaff."

"This is my second favorite beer from St Arnold's brewery only behind the glorious Pumpkinator. The beer pours a beautiful dark orange with a golden orange head that dissipates quickly. The flavor upfront is a great carmel sweetness with hints of hop in the back end. The smell is really the only disappointing part of this beer, there really is none. It's so weak in the smell department that its a huge disappointment . The mouthfeel is light with a small oily feeling on the back"

"Body is medium and pretty refreshing and easy to drink. Overall it's pretty much what you expect when you get an octoberfest, even if not particularly outstanding."

"Oktoberfest in august?These seasonal beers keep releasing earlier and earlier, soon we will be drinking christmas ale in september but anyways this is a good beer no matter the season.st arnolds oktoberfest imo is the best of the style,better than sam adams and others that i have had.the smell and the taste is a little on the sweet side but thats the style i guess.drinks well and good abv.this is my halloween beer when trick or treating with my kids, good seasonal beer from st arnold and true to their other seasonal offerings better than their year round beers."
"You can read all the other professional reviews on this page, but from a strictly pedestrian beer drinking perspective, I appreciate this beer for what it is. It is a malt forward, medium to full bodied beer that would rock in concert with some wings or other tail gating fare. It's an easy drinker and should be enjoyed in moderation, given the above average ABV of 6%. Don't mess with Texas beers, or the Texans. Salud!"

"Pours a lighter amber, with good amount of white foam. A light layer remains after the pour. Esthery smell, not dominant but there. Caramel malty taste, very soft, subtle. Butter flavor. Not too sweet, and not much bite. Mostly mellow. Easy finish. Pretty good Octoberfest."

"12 oz bottle. Pours amber with a long lasting white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of sourdough and hint of grassy hops. Body is medium and smooth. Caramel malt and herbal hops are balanced on the palate. Finish is short and slightly sweet. One of many good Oktoberfests."

"Poured into a pint glass. Pours clear amber with a creamy biege head that dissipates at a moderate pace. There are some tiny streaming bubbles visible in the beer. The aroma is of bread with some herbal and earthy notes from the hops. There's not much in the way of sweetness in the aroma. You definitely get the full flavor of Munich malts here with some mild hop bitterness in the background. I pick up those earthy and herbal hop flavors, but like these are mild and allow the malt profile to come through more. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The beer is crisp and smooth, permitting high drinkability. This is a very good beer."

"A bit sweet, but didn't overpower. Just a good solid beer in my opinion. I would have no problem drinking these again and again. Enjoyed."

"O- Entire profile is out of whack per style. Too sweet and not light nor clean enough. I wasn't a fan, but my girlfriend liked it, so this became her beer."

"O: Overall a very drinkable beer and you don't even taste the 6% ABV"
"It has a certain crispness to it but it still has a wet finish. I like the aftertaste that it leaves. I could easily see myself making a session out of these, easy to put down."
"I’m starting to regret saying something to the effect of ‘I’ve never tasted an Oktoberfest beer I didn’t like.” This, case in point. Pours a clear, toasty brown color. Good head retention but not a whole lot of aroma at draught temperatures. Light in taste with a bitter hop kick at the end. It’s not the smooth, lightly malted marzen I’ve come to know and love. I’m glad I took a chance on this but I would be hard pressed to finish a sixer at home."
"Received this in a trade with LadyOfMuchBeer. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Pours a transparent amber hue with virtually zero head. The nose is pretty muted, not a lot going on. At most you pick up what seems to be some cinnamon or nutmeg. Maybe a little bit of malt and caramel. The taste is definitely on the malty side with hints of vanilla and caramel. The mouthfeel is very thin and alkaline like. There isn't a lingering aftertaste which is nice. This goes down real clean. Overall, while not one of my favorites, this wouldn't be a bad session beer this time of year on a cool, cloudy day. I wouldn't seek it out, but I wouldn't get mad if I was stuck drinking it either."
"Overall, very good to style."
"O- my first oktoberfest(oct. 1 :D) and i enjoyed it. was refreshing."
"D - quite drinkable, and reasonably good Oktoberfest. Not overly sweet, but lacking a bit of intensity."
"O - It's a very drinkable beer, but I find it too syrupy sweet with some ho hum flavors. Crushed it easily, but it lost my attention rather quicklly."
"Very hoppy for an Oktoberfest."
"Give it a try."
"This pours a light amberish color with a nice white head which quickly dissipates. The smell is of bready and caramel malts. Feel is medium. The taste is more of the caramel and bready malts, a little lighter than some of the others. Overall a good beer although one of the weaker oktoberfests I've tried recently."
"O - Very impressed with this Oktoberfest, so far this is one of my favorite Oktoberfest brews out. It is very well rounded, pleasant taste and overall feel. Each sip is delightful and refreshing. I definitely recommend everyone to try it."
"O: If I had to choose a Texas-made Oktoberfest, I'd opt for Rahr or even Shiner over this one. Solid choice and worth trying, though."
"O: Worth a shot if you can score a single. A six pack would take a while to finish."
"O- A pretty tasty take on the style. Has a different taste to it because it is an ale but I really like the end product."
"Overall-Pretty simple, but what I expected. I will probably drink this 6 pack by the end of the day."
"D - Decent brew, lighter than most Oktoberfest beers that I have had. Good brew that I could easily have more than one. Would like to have again and I recommend trying it"
"drinkability: The winner of the group Ive had from this brewery."
"I'm very impressed with Saint Arnold on this one, nothing bad to say about it at all."
"Drinkability: I'm having this one a bit late, but it was an enjoyable beer. I don't think I'm ever in the mood for more than one oktoberfest in an evening, but this was an easy beer to sip on."
"A bit stronger than Brooklyn Ale's version so drinkability might not be quite as good but this is still very good beer especially paired with traditional German food as I just had it. Little wonder many in TX are switching to this from Shiner (which is good but well, to each our own)"
"Pours a reddish amber with a quickly fleeting rocky off white head. Smells of caramel bread honey graham cracker and hints of dark fruit. Taste is malty sweet with caramel honey candied dark fruit and just enough hops to keep this from being sweet. Crisp level of carbonation, syrupy/creamy mouthfeel, medium body. Great O-fest from Texas, very well done!"
"A good robust Oktoberfest."
"D - Tasty, refreshing, and highly drinkable, this is a fantastic beer for autumn, particularly here in Houston where the temperatures are still hovering around the mid-80s. Try it if you have access to it."
"A good beer, just not a whole lot going on. Mild in aroma and flavor, but tastes fine. Not worth buying a bunch of, but worth a taste if you like Octoberfests."
"This was a fairly average Oktoberfest beer. Easily drinkable and goes well with the fall climate. At colder temps, 40 or so, it is not that great. I let it warm up and it got much better. There is really not much to say other than it's a typical tasting American style Oktoberfest beer. Decent level of sweet maltiness and dry hopped. It was kind of overly carbonated for my taste. I thought it was better than Sam Adams. This beer didn't really invoke much. It didn't give me much to elaborate on - what's to say. It was decent - I would have another if the price was reasonable - it was a good autumn beer."
"An ok effort, but nothing about which to get excited."
"D- Enjoyable, but it is better on-tap or directly out of the bottle."
"The beer pours an orange-amber color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of toffee and caramel malt. The flavor is more of the same, with a lot of toffee as well as some brown sugar notes. I also get a little bit of grape, as well as a slight bit of hop bitterness to help balance the flavor. Very drinkable. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Thanks to wagenvolks for the trade! 12oz bottle into a DFH Signature glass pours a crisp bubbly orange with a nice lasting off white head that eventually diminishes to a thin layer. Aroma is a nice amount of sweet caramel malts. The taste is an interesting blend of sweet malts. The beer is strangely thick, like unhardened gelatin. This is an interesting beer, but not likely one I would have again."
"Drinkability: Overall with the weird aftertaste I was getting I wouldn't want to drink much more than one. Will try on tap to compare to bottle."
"drinkability: A good session beer. One of the better octoberfests I've had this year."
"I probably wouldn't drink a whole 6er of this stuff straight, but it was pretty awesome. Dark golden color. Excellent head, smooth mouthfeel and great flavor. Rich earthy hoppy aroma with hoppy and earthy flavors, but balanced with a great spiced malt flavor. Balanced is the key phrase here. I would not hesitate to pick up a pack to split with friends."
"Not quite to style but good except for slightly odd aroma."
"Thanks, ericandersnavy, for the oppportunity"
"A malty, but not overly sweet brew. Drinks very well, with higher end of abv for style covered well. It does have an ""ale"" character to it, and says ""ale"" (though in Texas it goes by abv level...) I'm assuming it's an ale version of the style, and for that it does well, bringing in malty smoothness that is not overly sweet. I could drink plenty of these when in a malt-accented beer mood!"
"Decent enough beer. Not really representative of the style, but I'm not hung up on that. I just suspect some of these tastes (diacetyl?) might not be what the brewer originally intended. Gimme the Lawnmower any day!"
"Thanks Exiled!"
"If it was still available I would buy it again, only if my favorites were out."
"Pretty nice. I probably won't buy again because it's just too sweet for me. Still, really not bad."
"Glad I got to try it. But won't seek it out."
"So glad I tried the bottled version of this... It was definitely worth the second chance..."
"Final thoughts: It started pretty good, great appearance, and nose to start, then the taste was a little interesting with some roasted porter tastes and slight chocolate malt, and some toasty tastes. Then it went downhill with some strange sweet syrupy tastes, diacetyl, and other weird flavors. About halfway through the beer, and all the initial strange flavors blend into the taste buds, its starting to slightly taste more like a traditional Oktoberfest, but not really. I give them some credit for stepping outside the bounds, but perhaps not on an Oktoberfest. Call it Harvest or Autumn or something."
"Verdict: A solid Märzen, Saint Arnold's Oktoberfest is a tasty and drinkable taste of fall. Something to look forward to each year, like most of this brewery's seasonal releases."
"The mouth is crisp but a trifle thin for the style. Still, this is a pretty tasty take on the lighter modern O-fest."
"Flavor is also on the subdued side, with some sweet cola, orange, apricot, and toffee notes that remind me of an old ale, actually. Still, less sweet and bready than other oktoberfests, with a touch of bitterness I haven't noticed in others. After sipping for a while, I think the light hops actually make this a pretty balanced beer, and I'm liking the effect. Mouthfeel is nice and full and finishes cleanly, thanks to that bitter property. On the whole, not a bad beer at all, though different than I expected."
"not really a fan, haven't had many oktoberfest's though."
"Opinion: Well, this is a good beer, but a good bit from what I would expect from an Octoberfest. The balance is considerably sweeter than other German versions, which balance toward the dry slightly. Maybe the yeast slighlty under-attenuated, but I seriously think that it was just the grain-bill. There is likely two-row and crystal malts (Maybe cara-munich) to make up for the lightness of the base malts. I am a bigger fan of using almost entirely Munich malt for the grain bill...but that is personal preference. I will probably drink this beer again, but I won't be expecting the exact style that is printed on the bottle. It is a pretty good session beer, regardless of the intended style."
"Overall: This was a pretty good beer. I wouldn't call it amazing but it was solid. I will gladly keep this stocked in my fridge all fall."
"Very fresh 12oz bottle. Pours clear amber with a fluffy off-white head that dies to a collar rather quickly. Smells strongly of caramel malt, with a bit of wet hay in the background. Sweet and bready taste, again with plenty of caramel malt. Some very light, grassy hops. Medium body. Not a bad O-fest."
"D: Fairly high depending on the pairing. Alone, maybe not so much, but with a hearty meal this would be mighty nice."
"Thanks again, brewdlyhooked13!"
"Pours a very clear brownish colored body, but with absolutely no head. Has a very malty sweet smelling aroma. Has a very fizzy palate. A nice malty nutty taste. Very malty tasting, maybe a little too much for me."
"D - Pretty solid Oktoberfest. While not one of my favorite styles, this one is certainly decent enough."
"Drinkability: A very sweet O-fest, sweetest I have ever had. Right at the border of being sugary vice malty, this is an unusual beer. Not too sure I like this one."
"Easy on the palate, this beer make the evenings go well."
"D - although it's a bit past Oktoberfest (my mom bought this for me when it came out and now I'm visiting home for Thanksgiving) I quite like this. A very drinkable Märzen with a nice flavor to it. Would definitely buy again next year"
"D-Nothing spectacular but it all comes together to form a pleasant, easy drinking brew. A very nice effort by St Arnold that I would be happy to drink again."
"Bonus hitchiker from JonathanL7890, part of a great group of Texas traders who contribute great class of our site.Pleasant malty aroma with some peach fruit. The fruit is in the initial taste, with a modest smoke. Not very drinkable, but it could depend on the night and the food. A bit light on mouthfeel."
"This isn't my favorite style, but not a bad drinker."
"Mouthfeel is very good amount of carbonation for this style. Overall, this is a very drinkable beer, but there are far too many better oktoberfests out there."
"This beer does not meet oktoberfest or marzen standards. It almost had no smell, no head retension and the taste was pretty boring."
"Overall it was a solid fest bier, though not the greatest in the world, I would not turn my nose up at it if it were offered again. Damn fine selection and something I would love to have again."
"Pours a nice coppery/amber color, big fluffy white head fades out relatively slowly, settling into a foamy layer and collar around the beer. Sweet caramel aroma, bready/grainy. Lots of caramel malt flavor, but not too sweet, some spice, hearty bready flavors, and a very faint alcohol flavor. Extremely clean-tasting, medium-bodied, and drinkability is perfect for the season. I'd have this again in a heartbeat if Texas weren't so far away. Thanks, Rick!"
"Pours a lightly hazed orange/amber, rich looks colouring, thin off white head forms and quickly settles down to a thin ring, a few lace spots are left on the glass. Smell is a little weak but solid, some caramel and butter, light citrus, bready malts, iron, oranges, honey, nice and clean, reminds me of the Sam Adams Oktoberfest. Taste is nice and malty, biscuit and honey, butterscotch, corn syrup (in a good way), rich and full malty finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, lots of substance, medium carbonation, easy to drink. Very solid Oktoberfest, the malts are real nice in this one. I could definitely have a few. Thanks Greg!"
"Drinkability - a superior fall beer, thanks to BGThang for providing a sixer of these for the upcoming Halloween beer tasting. Well, a 'fiver' now... ;-)"
"Thanks to ballewblake for this one."
"D - it was ok."
"Pours a clear amber with a slight off-white head. Smells sweetly malty with strong roasted nuts, a touch of spice. Taste is heavy on caramel malt as one might expect and is nicely layered - plenty of bready notes, toffee, some fruity tones - especially apple, and nutty, roasted qualities. Medium body and carbonation (just a touch high), with a pleasant oily coating that lingers on the tongue. One of the better I've had on my marzen binge this season. Cheers to mhewes for the bottle."
"Decent take on an Oktoberfest here. It could have used a bit more toast or bitterness and the body was a touch thin but it still drank fairly well."
"Pours a cloudy golden dark orange color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, not much sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is malty, with some yeastyness, slight spice. The taste is sweet, malty/yeasty, with some spice. Medium body. Drinkable, not too bad, tasty."
"A good brew all around will gladly drink more if I had it available. A fine Octoberfest"
"Amazed at how this beer is very malty, but yet avoids being overly sweet or sticky. Quite delicious and very easy to drink. A recommended Oktoberfest!"
"M/D - Medium to full bodied and very creamy. Excellent feel. Alcohol is very well masked making this a very drinkable brew."
"A very nice example of an American Oktoberfest!"
"Like many American O-fest's, this one leaves toward a richer, roasted caramel flavor. That's not a bad thing, it's just different. The aroma, in addition to the toffee and caramel, has a slight hard-water mineral note in the aroma. The flavor also finishes with a mild black pepper note. Worth a stein full."
"As the beer warmed a bit, the maltiness became a bit more pronounced and again this is something that I liked in this beer. Overall a very drinkable beer!"
"Another good beer from Saint Arnold. If the sweetness was a little less, this would be a great beer. Still, something I would recommend."
"3.5/3.5/4/4/4.5"
"This beer is mellow and a nice end of summer drink. I am currently enjoying this while home-brewing a stout on a cooler summer night. It makes me look forward to the winter months. Excellent beer."
"D- Drink one and than another, and another, and another... and another"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable because it does not wreck the pallet. This is a very well balanced beer, but it will not become my go-to beer while available."
"D: Definitely drinkable as the somewhat high ABV is not apparent at all. This is a very smooth brew that is a good representative of the style."
"after storing it for a year it was undrinkable"
"Cloudy amber pour with a fluffy beige head. Malty, sweetness on the nose. Tastes was a light bodied maltiness, with some almost tartness as well. Perhaps biscuity malt flavored. Somewhat of a quick light finish. Not a bad beer, but not one of my prefered styles either."
"EDIT: I think I did get a bad sample or maybe this years sample is just super fresh and awesome, or maybe this is just a better version. I bought a sixer for extras in a trade. I just cracked it open. Not bad. This is a decent oktoberfest. There is a little bit of dry tannins and a touch of off flavor on the mouth. But overall, this is a decent, full crisp oktoberfest."
"Medium body, moderate carbonation. Balance is good, smooth with maybe a slighty creamy mouthfeel. Overall a decent example of the style, and certainly a session candidate."
"I finally found my notes from Fredericksburg, Texas' Oktoberfest! This poured up amber with a light tan, creamy head. Smells of caramel malts. Sweet. The taste starts off with a roasted caramel flavor, almost like maple syrup, with hops at the finish. It had a nice full mouthfeel. It left a ring of sugar feeling on my lips."
"This beer goes right on par with all of the other oktoberfests I have had. This beer is a very good beer, and being from a texas brewery I tend to lean that way when hitting the local liquor store for a quick sixer. But compared to all of the octoberfests not brewed in germany, this one is tops in my book. Definatly a good malty flavor and light mouthfeel. To bad this one is only out for a short time :("
"Somewhat hazy orange/amber color with a nice white head that retains well. Smell is lightly fruity with some breadiness and there seemed to be a little DMS present. Again, taste has some fruitiness and plenty of bread, but the DMS (or something similar?) detracts from the brew for me. Taste would be much higher if not for that. Above medium levels of carbonation and slightly heavier than medium bodied. I'm thinking they could make this Oktoberfest a real winner with a couple changes in procedures, but who am I to judge? Decent brew from what seems to be a pretty darn good brewer."
"Drinkablity: Though the mouth got a low score, this is still very drinkable. Mild and smooth with a good sweet flavor helps this go down easy and at 6% ABV, you can have a few without thinking."
"The last of my American oktoberfest beer reviews. Next week I will be at the real deal and see how these young pups stand up. Again it looks identical to other American marzens dark amber and clear with a nice white head. I like the smell on this a bit more it has more force to it? I get a nutty malty flavor to it. Kudos to St Arnold for changing it up a bit. I don't LOVE HATE LOVE it, but an A for effort. See you all in Munchin."
"If you see it, give it a try and I'm sure you'll be impressed with this Houston Brewery. I know I am. Thanks TTU94! And remember..the thickah the waistband, the deepah the quicksand....or so I have heard."
"I like it but it's not a great example of an Oktoberfest lager in my opinion. Would make a very nice amber ale, though."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with no dating info into a pint glass. It was a copper color with tons of carb. It had a very small head that quickly disappeared. No lacing. The aroma was pleasing with sweet malts and a touch of hops. The taste was pretty good as well. It's a little sweeter than other oktoberfests that I've had lately but not too much. This is not one of favorite styles but I do go thru a short stretch where I like to try em. This one is a keeper and can see drinking a sixer or so every year. Overall, a good beer and recommend trying. (3.5, RB-OAY, T, O)"
"Not your TRUE Oktoberfest, but a beer worthy of the season that is highly sessionable and very good."
"D & Notes: The thing is, this beer actually tastes good. However, if it didn't say ""Octoberfest"" on the label, I might not even think I probably wouldn't guess I am drinking an O-Fest beer. Saint Arnold admits they are using ale yeast to brew this beer; and, while there isn't anything wrong with that, it simply isn't true to the style. There are way too may estercy flavors in this beer, and according to any brewing book, those are off limits in a O-Fest. Still, an interesting effort and a decently drinkable beer."
"Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz. bottle. The beer pours a medium copper, forming a 1 inch light tan head that quickly fadeds. No lacing left on the glass. The aroma is a good mix of sweet malt and caramel. The taste is slightly nutty from the sweet malt, but just with a hint of caramel in the finish. About medium mouthfeel. The full smooth flavor makes this a very drinkable ale. Overall, I was impressed by this beer. This is the first Oktoberfest beer that actually stands out in my mind as being above average. A great offering from Saint Arnold, and one that I will be taking advantage of while its available."
"D: Good, all around beer. Certainly reminds me of the fall with its malty notes and sweetness. While this isnt a German marzen (and certainly no Paulaner), I guess it would be a Texas take on a German tradition. This beer is something to look forward to in the fall, and I shall enjoy it any chance I get."
"If anything, it is too sweet. But, not bad."
"Pours out a chill-hazed orange/amber with lots of bubbles feeding a thinnish head. Smell is overwhelmingly toasty without the typical rich, malty aroma of an Oktoberfest. I pick up a good bit of booze as well. Tastes medicinal, overly toasty, oddly fruity, oddly somewhat roasty, and has a saccharine-like sweetness. Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin and prickly with bubbles. Not for me. If it didn't have the word ""Oktoberfest"" on the label, I surely wouldn't think of this as an Oktoberfest."
"Overall impression: Not bad - a rather average Oktoberfest."
"D - Very nice, on par with some German imported O-fests. I would buy and drink this if it were available near me."
"Pours transparent orange with an off white head that dissipates quickly. Malty sweetness in both aroma and flavor. Faint hop aroma. Some bitterness and the alcohol is noticeable. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, this makes a decent session beer and tastes ok. Compared to others in the style, I'd have to say I prefer Paulaner's or Spaten's over this, but this is good."
"Not a bad Oktoberfest but I feel I have had better. It's maybe okay in a pinch, but there are better ones out there."
"Bottle poured into a standard pint glass. Lovely color to this one. It was coppery amber with a nice white head. The aroma was nice and the taste had an excellent balance of malt and hops. It was not too alchoholic tasting and It was very true to its style. It was drinkable and pleasant on the palate. It was not a revelation, but it is a solid beer executed well."
"1-and-a-half 12oz bottles, in a half-liter Ayinger glass. Pours a pretty, clear amber color with a small but lasting head. Sweet malt aroma, rather caramel-like instead of toasty or bready. Flavor reflects aroma well, sweet malt cut by a mild bitterness, and a smooth clean finish. Neutral texture, body on the high side of moderate."
"D- I thoroughly enjoyed this interpretation by Saint Arnold. Some have said it is too one-dimensional but I didn't see it. Sweeter than other Marzens but different can be good."
"This is a unique rendition of the Oktober style. It's a solid, delicious fall treat, and one with few flaws. Another decent offering from Saint Arnolds."
"Pours a somewhat cloudy, pale coppery color. Low aroma-some buttery, sweet malt aroma. Malty upfront with a slight bitterness to it. Rather thin body-could sure use a kick to liven it up a tad. Ok beer overall. Take a chance-make your own opinion. I'm not overly impressed. Thanks to mushroomcloud for the bottle."
"A sweet, malt presence is here but the turnoff is the signature Saint Arnold's dirty malt finish."
"I'd enjoy a few of these if the opportunity arose...a nice beer for the day ahead."
"Very drinkable. A solid O-fest. Well made and worth a try."
"Another quality offering from SA."
"Just picked up this 6 pack yesterday so this should be this season's Oktoberfest batch. As with many of St. Arnold's beers, this one pours with very little carbonation, no head. Very nice amber hue. Would look prettier with some fizz. Good smell, spicy and hoppy. On second whiff, I note light smell of alcohol. Taste- has a definite taste but hard to put my finger on it. Hint of lemon, caramel towards the back of the tongue, molasses, and.... hint of chocolate in the aftertaste. Not the best brew St. Arnold produces but decent."
"Tastes like a very malty Elissa IPA."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Thanks to Kindestcut for this one!"
"This beer is a clear dark amber color with a thin eggshell white head. Thin lacing too. The aroma is malty sweet. Medium-bodied with a kind of fuzzy mouthfeel. Very, very sweet flavor of malt and little else aside from a bit of caramel. Very one-dimensional, which is saying something for a Marzen. The finish is sweet and bready. Not terrible but definitely too one-sided."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1/4"" beige head over the orangey copper brew. Head is gone in a flash, and lacing minimal, at best, with just little bubbles left here and there that eventually fall to the liquid. Aroma is malty, with a slight hops component. Taste is sweetly malty, with a tinge of fruit in there, with the slightest hops presence. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good. Not a bad Octoberfest, for sure."
"The is an very drinkable beer, one of the better local beers that I have had. I would recommend it to anyone."
"Overall Impression: My review doesnt do it justice. Im enjoying the season already. I can pound these, or savor them depending on mood. Not quite the expected taste for the style, but very enjoyable."
"Very smooth, easy to drink, very sessionable. One of the milder examples of the style."
"This is the first non-German interpretation of the Oktoberfest style that I've sampled. Saint Arnold Oktoberfest pours a very good medium amber, but, unfortunately, follows with almost no head. Smell is good and malty, aroma is biscuity with a little something else I can't quite place. Taste is solidly malty, but finishes a little too sweet. Honey taste is noted in the finish. Fortunately the sweetness never becomes cloying. This is a solid and likable brew, but I prefer the few German examples I've tried so far."
"This bottle-conditioned Oktoberfest pours a slightly hazy amber body with gold and orange highlights beneath a full head of creamy off-white foam. Its head retention is good, and it slowly drops to a wide, creamy collar and cottony surface covering. Sticky splashes of lace left about the glass add to its appearance. Some delicate tart fruit in the nose is reminiscent of plums and dried apricot, and they're carried over into the flavor wrapped in sweet, lightly doughy and just slightly toasted malt. The hop bitterness is restrained, allowing the sweetness of the malt to dominate the flavor profile without becoming cloying; and a swash of spicy hops comes through clearly, also helping to dry things out. A medium-light body (and fine-bubbled, moderate carbonation) also helps to keep its yeasty fruit and malty sweetness in check; and it finishes semi-dry with some lingering maltiness at the back of the throat. This is a really unique beer! It's certainly not a traditional German-style Oktoberfest/Marzen, but more of a Munich-malt based Belgian-style beer. Interesting, satisfying, and refreshing. This would certainly make a good table beer at a Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner! Well-done!"
"Pours a clear dark amber color with a tint of orange and a short white head that quickly fades into a nice lace. Nose has a bit of a sour twang (not an off-putting type of sour but rather something that invites you to continue sniffing) with some additional notes of roasted malts and grains. Moderate in body with a solid mouthfeel. Taste is a good blend of sweet malt, tart fruit, and bitter hops. This is one of the best of the Saint Arnold line of beers. Perfect to pair with some grilled bratwurst."
"When I drink this beer, like a good marzen, it heralds the changing season by bringing something new to your glass. This is a sweet beer, however, the sweetness is definitely balanced with a slight hop bitterness and a distant fruity flavor. While tasty, the beer goes down very easily and doesn't feel heavy to me."
"A small, grayish-cream head dies fast over the clear, dark, red-amber beer. Sweet, dark caramel in the grapesy nose. The beer starts off like a sugary grape drink. Dark, cooked, caramel malt shows up giving way to a dry, grainsy, bitter, grape drink finish. The aftertaste is like a sweet, grape ice cream. Interesting. It's very grapedrinky. Nothing really wrong with it, but nothing all that special either."
"Presentation: Packaged in a short brown glass bottle with a twist off crown. Served in a standard pint tap glass."
