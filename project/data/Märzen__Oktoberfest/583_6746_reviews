"Taste: More of the caramel/biscuit malts, with a touch of fruitiness in there. A perfectly drinkable and enjoyable Oktoberfest — maybe not to the same quality as a true German rendition, but nonetheless, one I’d not hesitate to enjoy again."
""
""
"O-Much better than I was expecting, especially given I am not too fond of the style."

"The beer pours a fairly vigorous head that dissipates quickly. The beer itself is a clear orange copper. The beer smell is very hoppy for an oktoberfest. The smell has orange hop notes and yeasty, bready malt notes that mix well with the hops. The beer taste is a bit hoppier than I'm used to for oktoberfests. The beer has a bready and malt taste that is topped off by a very orange and tangy hop taste at the end. The mouthfeel is very smooth with carbonation but not usually as thick as the better oktoberfests. Overall, an okay but there are better ones."

"Poured a decent 1/2"" head which went away fast and left minimal lacing. First aroma is of sweet malt and honey. Color is a cloudy orange-tan. First taste is crisp with a well balanced blend of hops, yeast, malt and a touch of caramel. Flavor overall seems well balanced and maintains its crispness throughout. About half way through, there is a touch of bitterness aftertatste but it is desirable and makes you want to drink more. Overall, a good beer with lots of flavor that still seems to remain light and crisp and most definitely is a beer to drink anytime, any season, anywhere !!!!!"

"Not too much going on here. Good beer, but a little to much toward the sweet caramel flavor."

"O - This is a quite enjoyable Marzen; definitely one that can be sessioned. The slant toward a bit fuller toasting than is typical for the style really keeps the sugars at bay without turning the beer into a hop-forward brew. While there really isn't anything particularly distinctive, it's the balance and toasting that make this the kind of beer that's a comfortable go-to within the style."
""
""
""
"Overall - Nothing to complain about here. This is not a bad tasting beer. Unfortunately, it doesn't taste of much like anything. Your American Adjunct Lager chugging buddies might really enjoy this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Solid offering from Schlafly. Very tasty beer. I’d certainly get it again, next fall."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: This beer has a good amount of malts but is still rather drinkable. It is a good representation of the style."

"My favorite use for Oktoberfest brews is to marinate chicken and/or brats in em...."
"The flavors are typical of the genre and this goes down easy. Barley, bran and grainy flavors combine with a touch of caramel malt sweetness. Tinges of roasted nuts and a biscuity malt all lend to a very good example of the style."
""
""
"A good malty lager but doesn't really hit the style. I like it better than some of the ""amber lager"" marzens that many American breweries make, though. Good beer for watching football."
""
""
""
"Served in 16 oz pint glass at the Pourhouse, Westmont, NJ"
"12 oz bottle. Pours amber with long lasting, foamy white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of Noble hops and nutty, caramel malt. Body is medium and smooth. Taste is sour, salty, caramel and herbal hops. Finish is long and salty. It seams to me they were trying to brew Gose but put in too much caramel malt."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a solid representative from Schlafly."
"In terms of what I want to drink in an o-fest, this is right on the money. But in terms of what the style emphasizes, the balance is off to my palate. I think it's a very good beer. I think it's just a ""good"" Oktoberfest. Great drinkability."

"Pours a crystal clear amber/orange with a rich dense off-white head. Aromas of soaked grain, and a hint of cinnamon. Taste begins with an herbal, citrusy flavor, followed by some rich bread flavors, finishing with a pine forest flavor. Mouthfeel is rich. Overall a very good Marzen that I would get again."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a orange, slightly cloudy, with a small white head that dissipates quickly and leaves some decent lacing. Smells of oranges, lots of oranges, maybe a little wheat. Tastes of malt with a little hop bite, but pretty bland. Beer is carbonated great for its light body and is quite drinkable. Overall, a slightly above average beer."

"Nothing special, nothing terrible here. The aroma was a bit off to me...cant exactly put it in words. appearance was nice darker bronze, head was adequate. Taste was rather malty sweet with a mid level bitterness on end of swallow. i dont know if it tasted rather metallic or hairspray-like, but there was this odd flavor at the end of each drink...it started out sweet but ended with this tinny taste. i should have had it with burgers, brats, or wings rather than by itself."
""
""
""
"Overall, lacking in malt complexity and a bit too bitter for the style. Drinkable, but not memorable. No real flaws."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Pours copper in color with a fluffy off-white head, chunky, sticky lacing as the head slowly dissipates into a thin foam. Aromas are malty, bready, caramel, toasted grain, herbal noble hops, metallic, lager yeast. Tastes are nutty, grainy, bready - rye perhaps, herbaly hop, earthy, caramel, hint of tobacco at the back of the palate. It's medium bodied with moderate carbonation, nice spicy finish while finishing semi-dry. Overall, good offering of the style, glad I got to try it in St. Louis."

"Drinkability: The hair spray always gets me. Perhaps it is something else, something much more constructive, but I always think of hair spray. Not cool."
"I really enjoy this beer, one of the more enjoyable Oktoberfest for the fall season. Aroma is a nice balance of sweet malt and spice, reminding me of the upcoming fall weather. Taste, sweet spice and everything nice. Love the malty mouth feel, and slight spicy under tones of a crisp fall evening. Very enjoyable overall."
""
""
"The beer poured a pleasant orangish amber with a nice white head, that laced throughout the session. The aroma was of sweet malt, with a bit of fruity fragrances on the edges. The taste was straight up sweet malt like you expect from a good marzan, maybe a bit of peach in the undertow. The feel is medium and a bit on the wet side as you'd expect. This is a very well put together beer that you could sit and sip on all day."
"Overall- Very drinkable . One of the better oktoberfests that I have tried."
""
"O- A nice seasonal from Schlafly. I really enjoy the fall seasonals, so I look forward to them hitting the shelf. This one did was not over the top good, but worth trying."
""
""
"Overall, I really didn't get this beer at first. But then I drank another, and it started to make sense. It make take a while, but it is a complex brew, with many things emerging, and those typical warm malty caramel notes are in there, you just need patience. Interesting take, but probably not preferred to have again for me."
"Very Americanized but schlafly has managed to combine fruitiness with rustic earthiness which many breweries have been unable to pull off, i really like it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I enjoyed this beer a lot more than I was expecting. I will be looking to pick up a few more marzens this seasons than in late summers past."
""
""
"D- very drinkable light Oktoberfest."
"O - Made the mistake of trying this AFTER the pumpkin beer. An excellent example of the Marzen style, but I just want more pumpkin...."
""
""
""
""
"O: Just a so-so Oktoberfest. Nothing really special or rememberable."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Pretty good brew. One of the better Oktoberfests I've had."
""
"Pours copper color with a medium sized head and a good amount of lacing. Smell of caramel and spices. Flavor is somewhat sweet like caramel with some malt and grain followed by a little bitterness. A pretty good balanced beer. A nice seasonal offering from Schlafly; glad they are now in Iowa."
""
"O: This is a solid Oktoberfestbier, especially when compared to other American takes on this style. I really like the unique character contributed by the (presumably) Polish hops; they give this beer an extra something that many American Oktoberfestbiers lack. That being said, there really isn't much separating this beer from other beers of this type, and as a result, I see no reason to seek this or any other American take on the style out over the German originals."
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle into Sam Adams glass. Pours a medium amber, decent but rapidly dissapating head. Aroma is fruit and biscuit, actually very pleasant. Taste is subdued spicy hops, sweet fruit, and slight caramel. Medium carbonation. Nothing offensive about this beer, but not much stands out as well. Would make for a nice session beer, but not much else."

"about as average as a beer can be, this oktoberfest in not distinct in anyway, not to say that it is a bad beer, just that it is so standard and in line with other traditional american brewed oktobers. it has a big malty nose, taste, and body, with plenty of carbonation. not particularly drinkable as it can be a bit filling in high volume. i doubt i will buy this one again."
"Pours a copper orange. White creamy head that dissipates rather quick. Good lacing. Smell of citrusy hops, some malt. Taste is malty with quite a bit of bitterness. For me, the bitterness overpowers everything else. Good carbonation. Not my favorite Oktoberfest."
"Overall- It is like the brewers were going for a cookie cutter Oktoberfest, which is surprising since their other fall offering, the Pumpkin Ale is so interesting, and tasty! I am a little disappointed by this beer and wish Schlafly would have given it more herbal notes or dialed back the adjunct wheat flavor in there."
"O- started out great, but blew in on taste. Not bad, but leaves something to be desired."
"I have liked a lot of Schlafly stuff that I have tried, but I would recommend avoiding this poison. If I had to choose between this and something like a PBR or Bud, I would be drinking PBR and Bud all night long."
"O: Quite enjoyable, easy drinker. Good for a for a few. A nice seasonal offering."
"O - I'm glad to get some hops from a Marzen for once, but they kinda muddied up the rich malt flavors that I look for in this style."
"Off-tap in Alexandria, VA this beer was clear orange color with a small head that didn’t retain itself particularly well and left very little lacing as a result. The aroma was malty with some light esters but nothing particularly distinct. The flavors however I enjoyed. I tasted caramel malt, some toasted malt, nuts, a little bit of biscuit-like breads and a crisp, clean finish provided by the above-average hops (for a Marzen). The body was medium, the mouthfeel good and the carbonation low. A simple, sessionable example of the style."
"Biting, astringent, and altogether a little too American to be a really good marzen. It's not bad, certainly, but not what I look for the in style."
"Oktoberfest pours out hazy copper in color with a thick rocky head on a good draught pour. As the head slowly subsides, there's a tremendous amount of lacing that left down the entirety of the glass. The smell of this bier - well it reminds me of fall crammed into a glass. But since that's a rather subjective statement, the actual aroma is slightly sweet with notes of tasted and grainy malts. Both the taste and the drink of the bier is a wonderful balance between the malted caramel grains and bitterness from the German hop varieties. Overall, this may be one of the most quintessential autumnal biers for Saint Louis locals. Thanks to the relatively moderate ABV (5.5%), you can feel comfortable having a few of these during dinner or while watching a game."
"I poured this good beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was an orange looking color. The beer poured a nice big head. The beer had a bready smell to it and tasted a little caramely. I really liked the beer and would buy again. I noticed thiugh all the octoberfest beers coming out are this same color. I wonder if they are adding food coloring?"
"Another average offering."
"A tasty amber-style Oktoberfest that has a solid flavor profile, but a nose that doesn't really match. The flavor falls in the upper half of O-fests, but that nose holds it back a little bit."
"o: I was hoping for a little bit more here and the weird soap taste in the finish kind of confused me. (it was a clean glass) Very easy drinking and would be happy to have a few of these on a football Sunday."
"Pours a clear copper body with a small head with decent retention. Aromas in order of intensity are earthy first, toasty second, and tea-like third. The flavor is far less toasty than many oktoberfests and way more herbaceous and soil-like than I expected, but in a way that's intriguing. If ""autumnal"" was a flavor, this would be it. Body is medium-full and carbonated in a way that showcases its unique flavor notes. Very enjoyable."
"Pours a dark amber w/ a one finger off white head. Great lacing, and almost zero carbonation. Nose is toasted malt, some fruit, and a little orange. Taste is the exact same profile as the nose. Not great, but pretty good. Very light and fizzy feel on the brew. Overall, this is a decent brew, but not fantastic. You can find better Oktoberfest beers."
"The aroma was light, bready malts with a hint of a caramel sweetness. Light touch of grape like fruit in their providing a slight nose of sour. Rich tones working their way in the flavor though. Quick, clean hitting and crisp, this was a definite session beer to say the least. Nice well rounded malt flavor with a hint of light hops toward the end that were just enough to provide a nice touch of balance."
"The Schlafly Oktoberfest is a good festive beer! the appearance is a clear amber with decent white foam that laces throughout the drink. The smell includes sweet malt and grain. The taste is a great balance of malt and sweet goodness. Typical marzen beer great for the cooler fall days. Worth a try if you come across."
"D: Drinks quite nicely, I really like this beer."
"Overall, a great Oktoberfest win and beer full of flavor. These guys to me are a real under the radar simple basic and good brewery. Very underrated, they make some solid stuff and this one is no exception. Goes down like nothing."
"Overall Impression- Enjoying again in the same week (in bottle this time), very average brew but once again, not enough character for a Oktoberfest beer! Easy drinking for those who don't give a shit, but I do. I'm hoping next years Oktoberfest brew is much better than this year and I'm not being harsh. Just reviewing another beer."
"Overall a good Oktoberfest, but in the future I'd probably pass it over in favor of better examples."
"O: What sets this one apart from all of the other myriad Octoberfest clones, you might ask? Nothing... and therein lies the problem."
"Medium bodied, beer was very fresh and drinkable. Perfect for a rainy Labor Day. One of the better Oktoberfests available in Tennessee."
"Medium mouthfeel and a little bit of a dry finish. Good enough to have another and seek out the bottled version."
"Overall, I would say this is an above average American Oktoberfest, it is malty, bready, and satisfying in that way, as appropriate for the style."
"Enjoyed my first Octoberfest of the season out of the bottle and in a pint glass. This Oktoberfest poured a hazy copper color with a average off white head, head retention was average, and there was a bit of lacing. The aroma of this ale smelled of toasted malt and fresh baked bread. The taste is medium in body, a malted barley base, a little sweet. Easy to drink. Overall, it is an average representation of the style. Nothing more...Nothing less."
"Overall: A pretty good Oktober fest, sweet and easy to drink. Not a home run, but solid."
"Lots of barley malts, some caramel notes to it as well in a slightly sweet sort of way. A light hop presence is found, but only as a balancing factor and not all that significantly. Somewhat corn-like in its malts as well, which is a little off-putting and unpleasant. It was bottled 8 days ago according to the bottle, so it is definitely fresh. But there is some sort of taste in there that is slightly off-putting for sure. Smooth and easy to drink though, as any oktoberfest beer should be. Just lacking slightly in the flavor department a little bit, as it would do better if it was a little sweeter. This was my first Oktoberfest of the year, but I know there will be better ones."
"Beer is thin to medium in body, a little grainy on the finish, some aftertaste, a little bit of boiled vegetables, bummer, I had high hopes for this one."
"Drinkability - This is a decent brew. Worth a try. Falls in line nicely with the Fall/Oktoberfest season. Pretty easily drinkable and would pair well with a cool evening."
"Verdict: Quite nice, drinkable and enjoyable. Worth trying."
"Not a great combination or balance of flavors. This is nothing special."
"12 ounce bottle. Using a rudimentary and very basic beer mug for this one. Somewhat of a murky, cloudy appearance that could be chill haze, with very little in the way of head or head retention. Caramel sweet aroma with hints of sourdough bread underneath. Light carbonation and a relatively thin mouthfeel. Caramel sweet aroma also translates over to the finish. Some might complain that the body's a little thin on this but I think it works fine in the parameters of the beer and the style in which it is working. There's also a surprising amount of bitterness to be found in the middle of this beer, though the huge caramel finish overpowers that relatively quickly. Lemony citrus hops also help to cut the sweetness of the finish. This beer is all about the malt profile - which is good because it's very decent and enjoyable. That said it's not spectacular - there's not a lot here that's going to bring you back to the beer or anything particularly memorable about it."
"Good body and carbonation. Very easy to drink. Enjoyable for the season. Pretty good."
"Overall- A fantastic example of an Oktoberfest. The color and taste are spot on and very tasty. I wish I had more of this beer to drink."
"While it's not the most overwhelmingly good beer, for this time of year, this is a highly serviceable and sessionable 'fest."
"D- A decent, if slightly underwhelming Marzen. A bit more flavor intensity and one could pair this with a variety of foods."
"Has a great drinkability as it has a medium mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: This beer is pretty smooth and light, but the bite at the end keeps it from being a session beer."
"They just started making it, and it's quite fresh, BTW, bottled on 8-6-2010. I think I got one of the first sixers sold in my area. It's just a bit odd for a marzen, and not all that similar to what I had in the taproom."
"Drinkability - I have had it on tap, and prefer that over the bottle; but still overall a great beer for the style. This will be one of my regular fall beers."
"Easy to drink but it gets a tad sweet (honey-ish) after just one."
"On the palate it's clean and crisp with slightly dry finish. I'd say Schlafly did great on this interpretation of the Oktoberfest style. If I were at Oktoberfest in Munich and this was served to me, I wouldn't know the difference between this and any other without a side by side comparison."
"Softly carbonated, light/medium body."
"pours a very lively copper/amber with a two finger off white. very nice. smells of sweet yeast, bread, grass, cider, and small malt. tastes of light malt and toast with a very grainy aftertaste. light body with good carbonation. the grainy aftertaste makes it very difficult to enjoy this lighter beer."
"Drinkability: I would have this again fresh to compare, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. I recommend this for those who enjoy a light bodied brew that has a distinct malt/ grain profile. A one and done for me."
"D: Goes down easily, not too filling, sweetness in the finish drop the drinkability on this one, but a nice beer to have one or two."
"Lots of flavor on this Americanized version of an oktoberfest. Toasty and nutty malts are just as prevalent as the typical sweet caramel. Touch of fruitiness and the finish has some definite hoppy bitterness. Body is nice and creamy but seems a touch overcarbonated. I like it well enough, but it is not as thirst quenching and clean as many of the better German versions of the style, not as sessionable. Still not a bad offering and I would gladly try this again, perhaps on tap."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a very solid O-fest to drink for a long time."
"The feel is not as thick as some other O-fests but not too thin. This beer goes down smooth and easy and I can drink a few of these. Something to look forward too when fall comes around and this is an underrated American interpretation. Good stuff."
"Mouthfeel is chewy, slick. This is a tasty guy."
"D. Definately a good session beer, Nice malty flavor with a slightly bitter finish. Not too heavy with lots of flavor. A real nice brew."
"Split a mixed 12 pack from a Hy Vee in Columbia, MO. Poured a tall, off-white head with a toasted caramel malt aroma. The flavor has a little tangy lager kick in the aftertaste that reminds me of Summit's O-fest. The malts are mild at first, but a little orange peel hop, burnt caramel, a pleasantly grainy crust. This beer is more aggressive than your usual Oktoberfest, but you could consider this a tasty American interpretation."
"Pours a clear amber with moderate beige head, mostly diminishing. Aroma of caramel and biscuit malt, no hop presence. Definitely tasty with good medium body. Sweet caramel malts in front with hint of cinnamon then a crisp, spicey hop finish. But like a true Oktoberfest style this is a malty brew. Solid offering by not quite up to par with a true German brew. A bit on the sweet side."
"Pours a beautiful amber color with a frothy head atop and sticky lacing lines the glass. Smells of caramel, malts with subtle hints of hoppy finish. Taste is similar to the nose, with sweet malts being the dominate flavor. Overall really good tasting not too sweet and smooth as can be. Mouthfeel is fairly thin and drinkability is high. Definitely a session worthy. Credits Schlafly."
"Pours a clear, amber/copper color. 1/4 inch head of an of-white color. Decent retention and slight lacing. Smells of yeast, sweet malt, slight hops, and slight grain. Fits the style of a Marzen / Oktoberfest. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, sweet malt, grain, and slight hops in the finish. Overall, a little watery, weak in body, and simple in body."
"I was surprised at some of the low ratings on this one. This is an immensely drinkable and flavorful Octoberfest that remains refreshing from start to finish. It is hard to believe it is only 5.1 % ABV. I have enjoyed every product from this brewery and this is no exception."
"Drinks very easy, a great stab at the style, will be getting some of this every fall"
"drinkability is so so - with the heavier body the temp. needs to drop some more before i could put many away"
"A good Oktoberfest but doesn't stand up to it German counterparts or Sam Adams Oktoberfest for that matter. I wished it would have been just a little sweeter."
"It is a bronze colored beer. It has a tan head with a lot of over the body that disappears quickly to form a spread out and thin lace. It has a sweet and malty taste at first. It is a little more mild on the hops than most Marzens. I mainly tasted what little bit of hops that I did taste in the aftertaste. I do like the way it taste though. The mouthfeel is thin and refreshing beer that is good as transition from summer to winter beers."
"Pours a foggy orange with a hint of browns. Nose is nutty, earthy, and sweet. Flavor is carrying much of the same qualities. A good mix with that typical citric tangy flavor that you notice from this style. feel is sticky and slick on liquid. Carbonation is slightly lower. A pretty nice Oktoberfest."
"12 ounce bottle, bottled on 8/18/2008. $7.49 for a six pack, purchased at Liquor Barn, Lexington, KY. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear amber/orange color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both average. It smells like bready and sweet malt, and also a little bit of caramel. The taste is similar to the aroma, with the addition of a bit of an earthy taste. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium with decent carbonation. Drinkability is good too, it wouldn't be a bad choice for a session beer. Overall I think this is a good solid brew, but then pretty much everything I've tried from Schlafly have been good beers. Too bad I can't buy them in Ohio, if they were available here I'd pick up their products more often. Recommended."
"This isn't my favorite Oktoberfest, but its a damn good one. Its too bad its a seasonal, I could drink this all year long."
"I was happy I did...it poured with a nice, quickly evaporating head, and slight lacing. Nice amber color with a hint of seasonal spices. Smooth to drink, with only a hint of bitter in the slightly sweet finish. Can't wait to buy a case...as good a beer as I've had in a while."
"Like most of Schlafly's beers I have, this is a good, solid example of the style and very drinkable."
"Easy to drink, sweet and satisfying."
"In short, I thought this was a very likable brew from Schlafly, a brewery that seems to me to be getting better each year."
"D- I really enjoyed this, a great American Oktoberfest!"
"D - this is a pretty good beer. I have not tried many others of this style, so I don't know how this stacks up against the rest. It is very malty and makes for a great companion when watching football on the weekend."
"Poured 12 oz bottle into pint glass. Golden color with 1 finger white head that diminishes to none with little to no lacing. Slight malty aroma. Lightly sweet, malty flavor that lasts through to finish. Slightly more carbonated than it's German relatives. Very drinkable. A good American version of this style."
"Not bad for a beer that was selected because it was ""The Best Available"" at a Memphis TN Wal-Mart. Top notch Oktoberfest and far superior to most other examples of the style."
":)"
"Smooth and creamy, easy on the palate, Schalfly has brewed a gem, one of the better Oktoberfests I've had and certainly one of the better offerings from Schlafly, a fine brewery whose wares have at times been hit-and-miss with me. Schlafly Oktoberfest is unquestionably a hit, very well done."
"This is an OK O-fest. Not on the scale of a Paulaner but I will finish this sixer easily."
"Pours a copper color with a thin white head. Has a very sweet bready smell with a bit of caramel in there also. A nice steady stream of carbonation rising from the bottom is also noted. Taste is heavy on the caramel with a hopps finish. Not a bad beer but it is a bit on the sweet side."
"Schlafly Oktoberfest is a pretty good version that, nevertheless, failed to knock me off my feet. I'll stick with Millstream Oktoberfest. However, if you live in the St. Louis area, you could do a whole lot worse. You could also do a whole lot better."
"This is a solid beer, but not one I feel the need to come back to."
"Sample at the Lambert St. Louis airport location. This beer is a clear copper-amber color with a medium thin off-white head that has a short life span. Top ring of lace with spots underneath. Sweet caramel malt aroma with a bit of pine. Medium-bodied and smooth with a sweet bready malt character. Touches of piney hops and spice here and there as well. The finish remains sweet with a short toasted malt aftertaste. Another average beer from Schlafly, but again a welcome sight while at the airport waiting for a plane."
"Drinkability - despite a rather distracting smell, this is a great Octoberfest. Another one for the Halloween party tonight..."
"D: Despite the mouth feel, this beer is very drinkable. I had more than a few, and they got better as the night waned."
"D - Outstandingly drinkable as are all good O-fests. I drank two big ass 22 oz glasses of this wonderful stuff."
"D: EZ to quaff. I'm fan of Marzen/O-Fest biers, and this is a good one."
"Pours a rich golden amber color with a two-finger head of just off-white. Sheets of lacing line the mug. Active carbonation bubbles rush to the surface, making this beer appear quite lively. The nose is of roasted malt, fresh bread and sweet caramel corn. The palate is, thankfully, not over sweet. A nice roasty malt flavor is dominent, but the somewhat yeasty, bready character is assertive. Very mild hop balance, but enough to temper the sweetness sufficiently. Mouthfeel is medium witha nice carbonation ""bite."" Finish is smooth enough, and only somewhat dry. Maybe not my very favorite Oktoberfest for the year, but it is among the better examples I've had for 2007. I'd say maybe only Millstream is better, over all, of the 4-5 O-Fests I've tried so far. Another very solid brew from Schlafly."
"I'd prefer a little more heartiness to my Oktoberfest but this one didn't disappoint."
"Nutty, vague apple esters, coarse barley. Some vague lagery aroma, maybe noble hops. Very vague and average, even when relatively fresh. Just okay. Thanks to Paul for the fresh bottle."
"pours a very light amber color with minimal head, smells pretty good has a nice maltiness to it, but hardly any hop character. tastes good, again has a solid maltiness to it, slightly watery but nothing awful, good all around oktoberfrest, first one of the season, cheers to many more"
"12 oz bottle. The beer departs the bottle a deep deep golden color with a small finger of head that falls to a broken coating over top of the brew. This is a very clear beer, and it has a moderate carbonation bubbling up from the bottom of the glass. The aroms brings some sweet bready notes with a touch of caramel as well. Under the sweetness is a light toastyness. It just doesn't seem to be coming together as well as it could to me. The sweetness doesn't work for me in this one. Tasting it, there is a definite bready quality that dominates with a little caramel sweetness, moving to a more mild toastyness and a little grainyness to boot. It finishes with a little grassyness from noble hoping. Mouthfeel is moderate with a nice moderate carbonation of small bubbles. It is a bit drying on the finish, which I find detracting to the experience. This one is okay. The sweetness just isn't working for me, and the drying quality is not pleasing. I would go with another O-fest before I had this one again."
"The drink ability is good, not great but a fine and mainstream example of the style. Prosit, MK"
"Thanks, beerhandy, for the opportunity"
"Pretty good American rendition of the style. Somewhere between a copper and orange hue with nice retention and lacing. Bready / caramel malt aroma with light grain and earthy hops. Tastes similarlly with emphasis on the caramel malts and German hops. Medium fullness and richness in the body that thins toward the end. Leaves with a mild grainy flavor and texture, allowing the hop bitterness to linger. Not bad, but cannot compete with good German O'fests."
"Not a bad beer here, though will still find myself reaching for something else other than an Oktoberfest more often than not."
"Mouthfeel was medium in body and carbonation. I liked this beer but I probably won't have another."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle marked ""Bottled With Love on"" date of AUG 08 2006 into a pint glass. Appearance is a transparent reddish orange hued amber color with a half finger of off white head that slowly fell away to a light ring of whitish lacing. Smell is sweet and toffee malt, bready and grainy notes as well. Very light on the nose. Taste is also light, more malt and caramelly sweetness, bready flavors, fades quickly into a slightly dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light-bodied with medium carbonation, goes down easy. Drinkability is good, would make a decent session beer, lacking in complexity and overall characteristics. A good solid Oktoberfest, easily the lightest one I've sampled this season, could use some more maltiness in my opinion but still a great easy to drink beer nonetheless. Suggest trying, great beginner introduction to Oktoberfest beers."
"This was a drinkable beer, just somewhat uninteresting."
"Thanks to Vancer for the opportunity..."
"D - It is a decent lager, but it didn't quite meet my expectations."
"Pours a clear light copper color with a thin head of very large bubbles that fade quickly. Aroma is candy sweet. Cracker Jacks. Taste is sweet, but not overly syrupy. More of a honey and bread flavor as I drink. Aftertaste is lightly sweet. A very satisfying brew. Thanks H-O-P!"
"Beer doesn't get much fresher than this, as it was consumed a mere 4 days after bottling. Props to Schlafly for getting it in stores so quickly."
"Definitely worth a try. Light/medium bodied, very drinkable cold."
"Departs the bottle a clear amber hue, with a small offwhite head. Head and lacing fall away after just a few minutes. Aroma is subdued, with bready malt and fruity and spicy hops. Light bodied and well carbonated in the mouth. Taste is well balanced between a bready maltiness and a subtle fruity and spicy hopiness. Slightly metallic, but finishes clean and refreshing. Solid, if unspectacular."
"Pretty good brew from the schlafly folks. I could and probably will enjoy a few more of these this season."
"Malts and spices in both the aroma and taste. Also noted nice hints of a nutty cinnamon. Very crisp and dry, a real pleasurable brew, and made for a nice short session. Grabbed some bottled OKs for the weekend. Looking forward to them & football Saturday nite."
"Overall: A good beer, but one that I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop and it never does. It's almost like having half a beer and hoping the other half with get there sometime. Certainly worth trying, but definitely not one of my favorites."
"Taste; starts of a bit spicy and floral, but that quickly fades into the bready/caramel malt flavors. I really liked the spiciness that this started with but it didn't stick around long enough for me, and the malts were a little to muted as well. Mouthfeel was pretty much standard for the style, light to medium bodied."
"A decent copper leaning red color with a good white head that fades down to clumps of head. Smells a touch citric and the malt is also a little muted, but there is breadyness to it as well. This has the usual clean lager yeast taste but the malt flavor seems a little confused for a marzen, not assertive enough. It has a good mouthfeel and could be an ok session beer there is also a slight metallic taste in the finsh."
"When all is said it done I like this beer. I found it plenty drinkable. I will happily drink the six-pack I purchased in Kansas City, MO. This beer will be one of my last O-fest this year. I am pleased to end on a happy note. I say, try one."
"I could drink a LOT of this stuff, it is very nice !"
"Deep copper to orange color, clear with a fluffy tan head. Nice lace. Aroma is toffee peanut brittle, a little fig. The flavor has a deep toffee flavor, more fig and date, almost a light roast. Smooth rich mouth feel very drinkable. This beer needs a little work. In speaking with a few other Bas, it seems to be a consistent problem with the base malt, and I agree. This beer could be great with a little tweaking."
"Pours a copper color, with an off white creamy head. Aroma is malty sweet. Slightly sweet taste with some light caramel and spice. Bitter, long lasting finish."
"Another well-done style from the best brewery in St. Louis and I enjoyed this at the Bottleworks. This beer matches its season very nicely. Roasty, malt, and hopped well. The color was a warm orange and the head was small. This sample was carbonated well. I enjoyed this brew and it was one of the better ones of this style that I have tried."
"This beer was way too bitter for my taste.It had a large sized creamy off-white head that contained fine-large sized bubbles that fully diminished.The nose was lightly malty, lightly hoppy and sweet.The flavor was moderately-heavily bitter that left a lingering aftertaste.The mouthfeel was smooth and medium bodied.There was excellent lacing with this beer."
"Purchased at the Bottleworks, with a bottled on date of Sept. 22, 2003."
"ave"
"The nose is malt, caramel and creamy with no hops note. The flavor comes through with a very nice strong malt flavor yet the finish on this little beauty is quite dry in the end. A really nice built taste. The feel is a bit full, but quite smooth. I believe that this is a long session beer. Long live October!"
"Cheers to budgood for the sample!"
"Pours a deep amber hue, some caramel and roasted malts barely noticeable on the nose. Strong caramel malts noted up front, very rich, borderline full bodied. A tinge of spiciness and hops to be noted. Slight sticky and sugary, very well rounded and balanced, excellent brew."
"Clear orange-copper color, nice white foamy head. Has a light flowery and malty caremel aromas, sweet, balanced malts and clean tasting, medium body, nice rounded malty mouthfeel, this is a great oktoberfest, with a maibock feel some great stuff and strong for the style."
"This is my kind of Octoberfest....rich and malty...initial smell on the nose is toasty, but that gives way to a wonderful caramel aroma...body is about perfect....rich and pretty thick and firm for this style...taste is like I expected from the nose...big maltiness...caramel...sweet malt...and then the surprise to it all is a tich of spiciness from some late entering hops that keeps things balanced nicely....an excellent Octoberfest..One of the top 5 I had this year.."
"pours out a deep, slightly hazy, deep copper/amber color. a nice tan head and some lace. strong aroma of toasty, sweet caramel malts. a full mouthfeel precedes the flavor of sticky sweet caramel maltiness. definite perceivable alcohol undertones. hopping detected but for balance only. a pretty solid and beefy o-fest. my first schlafly brew. thanks to my brother for bringing this up from st. louis over the thanksgiving holiday weekend. funny thing about it is...schell brewery in new ulm, mn contract brews the bottled version, so my six different brews that i received from my brother have traveled a long ways for my drinking and reviewing pleasure!"
"I am beginning to question my desire to taste Oktoberfest style microbrews.   This light orange color brew with a light white lace has a light biscuit aroma, but the mellowness ends there.  The malt flavor is sharply sweet and the boldness of the bitter creates a beer that could be great with an extended stay in a cellar.  But until it mellows quite a bit, I won’t be coming back to it."
