"Drank warm and it was still great."

"Nice look, Sweet smelling, smooth drinking. Good ""sweet bread"" flavor, not overly complex. Gets that stale Apple juice flavor if you don't drink it fast enough"

"Maltiness with just enough hops to let you know you've got an honest to god german beer here. Decent beer at a good price. Bonus points for weighting in at a none too shabby 5.9 ABV."

"Overall:  This is definitely one of the tastier Oktoberfests I've had.  I bought the last case of this stuff at my local distributor, and I have no regrets.  I can drink several of these puppies in a row, to a nice comfortable effect.  Not overpowering, but not weak either.  It strikes a pretty good balance overall."

"Pours a clear orange with white head. Nose is heavy with grainy malts, lager yeast, some sweet grape like character, and a touch of green apple.  The taste is sweet up front with some candied grape flavor followed by grain and bread. Finish is sweet with mild dryness to finish. Mouthfeel is light and well carbonated. Overall, this Oktoberfest leans towards the sweet end of the spectrum."

"Not bad.  Light and clean.  Good grass cutting bear.  You can drink multiples.  Not a ton of flavor.  Like my beers bigger and bolder.  Decent though.  Tailgate crowd pleaser."

"A bit one dimensional.  Slight herbal hop pop and grassy.  Reminds me of a Euro Pils.  Not terrible, just not what I'm looking for in an Oktoberfest"

"Pours light color golden with a fat creamy head of off white foam that lasts an leaves lovely lace. Nose is caramel and nothing toasted or breaddy or grainy.  Some hop herbal that is faint but promises to be on the palate.  The beer is clear.  Taste is nondescript. Fairly sweet with caramel being the major flavor here and nothing to indicate bread, or bread crust, nothing toasty. One dimensional.  There is a hop herbal on the palate and it's a strong grassiness. Not the best.  Thin mouthfeel with a bit of slickness to it."
""
"O: altogether nice, mild, and clean... hardly explosive on flavor, nor is there much depth to its malt character"
"09/29/13 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Lighter mouth feel than I expected but a very smooth taste & feel just the same. Full rounded flavor. A touch of caramel sweetness."

"Reddish bronze malt accented lager with a sweet nuttiness. Yummy taste for a lager and easy to drink! (especially in a boot (:)"

"Taste is a very good,solid oktoberfest with the same basic elements as the aroma, nicely balanced, light sweetness, light zesty bitterness. It's great alone or with German food. Feel is nice, not watery, slightly lively. It's a great easy-drinking but tasty beer."

"This is a light bodied brew with modest carbonation. Fairly crisp and balanaced for the style. It carries with it a bit of straw/grassy bitterness found in some other warsteiner offerings. I found this to be the best of the 3 offerings I had from this brewery but still, probably would not purchase again."
""
"330 ml bottle into dimpled mug, best before 5/28/2014. Pours slightly cloudy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of honey, bread, cracker, pear, apple, grape, floral, grass, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Ok aromas with solid balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with decent strength. A bit too much yeast fruitiness in the nose. Taste of honey, bread, cracker, light caramel, floral, grass, pear, apple, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Slight herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of honey, bread, cracker, light caramel, floral, grass, pear, apple, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish. Nice balance and robustness of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a good Oktoberfest style. Good balance and robustness of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"what? minimum of 250 characters. i'm not hoity-toity. this is a great beer for Americans. the buzz is excellant. f*** the S-A-S-T-M-O. the regular guy that is used to the 3 big American breweries will like this beer. Stop with the bourgeuois b*** s***. f*** the craft and micro brews. they are overkill."
"O: This beer is quite drinkable and isn't a bad representation of the style."

"Overall: It’s interesting to see a Northern German brewery brew an Oktoberfest beer, as that style of beer is traditionally only brewed by Bavarian breweries. Maybe because of the popularity of the style here in the U.S.? This one is pretty good, but nowhere near as good as those from the Bavarian breweries."

"Clear gold yellow pour with white head that stays around but doesn't lace.. smells like a euro pilsner with bread crust or cracker sweetness.. taste is pale bread crust with a toffee finish in the end.. strange bitterness in the end.. alcohol is present as it warms.. not enough taste to cover its almost 6% abv.. mouthfeel is smooth for a lager but enough bite to keep it crisp.. this beer is good for the warmer months of september.. but later fall I'd want a darker richer oktoberfest for sure."
"Well worth trying."
""
""
"Aroma is crackers and typical german lager crispness. Reminds of a pils with a hint more malt. The taste has that familiar Oktoberfest (munich malt) sweetness but with a lighter more bubbly mouthfeel. Based on the color, mouthfeel and taste I would classify this as a Oktoberfest-lite. Still quite good but not as complex and rich as a traditional OF. I love OF but they can get a bit heavy after a few. I think this would be a good beer for people who prefer lighter beers or if you are really planning to trow down. I like it, not as an OF but if I wanted something a bit heavier than a pils."

"My Oktoberfest season hasn't ended just yet... This stuff pours a clear sunset brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises biscuit, toffee, grass, a touch of butter, and a few sprinklings of mild greens. The taste brings in more of the same, but ups the grass and greens and adds a touch of orange peel. Still, the dry, buttery biscuit steals the show. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a decent O-Fest, but I'd put it in the lower echelon of those from the Fatherland."

"a proper octoberfest i think. darker, like an amber in appearance. with a small and fading off white head. however, the smell is malty but not sweet, which is perfect in this style. the flavor imports a much more dark malt profile into one of these oktobers. roasty and rich, less sugary and filling than some can be. i would drink several liters of this no worries. there is also a sort of essence of fall to this, which is not necessarily explained easily, but it works for me. the feel is good, heavier in body than most, but well carbonated and plenty drinkable. im really into it. great with a smoked ham hock, and one of those seasonals ill go back to again and again. lovely and underrated."
""

"Overall, a very malt-forward brew, as expected. Lacks complexity, and the cola flavor is a bit offputting."
""
"O -- Overall, this is a pretty lackluster Oktoberfest Märzen, though it's far from offensive in character. Maybe a first step into richer beers for a beginner, but not the best example of style."
""
""
""
""

"I am surprised at the low score this one has, maybe due to American's ignorant expectations that an oktoberfest has to be dark and toasty. This is a very refreshing beer with a sweet grainy presence that drives the beer but finishes clean with a somewhat crispy hop note. It is kind of like a kicked-up helles lager and is done quite nicely. I really like it and is quite a bargain at 12.99 a 12-pack. I may have found my go-to oktoberfest for 2012 here. Nice stuff."
""

"Kind of light for a marzen (in general). Deep straw color with literally no head after an aggressive pour. The smell was initially a bit skunky, but it faded. Lots of sweet grain with a very light hint of toffee and caramel. Not enough of anything. The taste, is just too bitter and light. Medicinal/earthy hop flavors stand out too much for style. Hint of sweet grains and caramel. Finishes super clean and sweet."
""
""
""
"Overall, I am glad I tried this beer but it doesn't seem to match up with other versions of the style, be it German or American."
"This beer sticks with tradition, and that's good. It's not, however, in the same league as some that have taken the style and built upon it."
""
"Not too shabby. I'm enjoying my first Warsteiner Oktoberfest."
"No, it's not the heavy sweet ""O-fest"" beer American craft-brewers brew every year--of which you can drink a couple (at most) at a sitting. This is a CLASSIC German session beer, meant to pound down glass after glass in Stammtisch.... talking with friends as long as you can stand being around each other!"
"Light mouthfeel that is enjoyable overall."
""
""
""
"A lesser alternative to a Spaten, Warsteiner's marzen pours a clear copper color with a small head that displays moderate retention and a bit of lacing. Aroma of toasted grains, sweet malts, pretty standard for the style. More of the same in the taste, toasted grains, caramel malts, cardboard, light hops give a mildly bitter finish. Light-medium body, a bit thin and bland overall, but easily drinkable at least."
""
"This beer pours a clear gold with yellow highlights under the light with a 1 finger head and no lace. It's aroma is of caramel with a hint of lemon. The flavor is mainly sweet malt and caramel with notes of bread crust and brown sugar in the background. The mouthfeel is light-medium and the beer is very drinkable. Warsteiner Premium Oktoberfest is a good beer, recommended."

"I think the thing I remember most about this beer was the glass."
"O: this beer is a good option for celebrating Oktoberfest because it has a very drinkable character and light presence, although it could be a bit on the bland side for some people."
"O/D-Don't love Marzens. This one is more intense than others I have tried. Sharper and less smooth than others. I enjoy the brashness. Do I like this more than Hacker-Pschorr's Marzen is the question. Both came cheap for a twelve pack. Not bad."
"Overall a brew that somewhat is in alignment with the style, although it was a little light in flavor for a typical Märzen."
"It has that special Warsteiner grain that floats to the roof of your mouth."
"Well, given it is Oct. 1 this brew fits the bill well. Tis a good example of the clasic style I am sure, but give me the Highland Brewing Octoberfest any day."
"Not crisp enough to engender any desire for more - and too much German lager diesel character to boot..."
"Medium body, higher carbonation, thinner and clean on the tongue. Honestly, this was a pretty boring take on the Marzen, and I struggled to pull the flavors and scents out."
"Overall great. Nice malts, straw, toast, dry, clean and crisp, noble hops, just delicious."
"O - A lighter more drinkable Oktoberfest than I'm accustomed to. Moving on to other Oktoberfest brews. 3.5"
"Sampled from a bottle - best before May 25, 2012. Golden yellow in color with excellent clarity. Poured with a bubbly, foamy white head that reduced to a sturdy white cap. Light grainy aroma, a bit musty, with an herbal hoppiness. Wet and tangy feel. Bread-like, grain flavors throughout with a hoppy tang in the middle that introduces an herbal hoppiness to the finish. Finishes clean and mellow. This was pretty good, but after tasting quite a few marzens this season, there's a lot more to offer out there."
"This is a drinkable beer. There isn't any remarkable notes, but it worked well with the pizza."
"Dark gold, clean white film of bubbles. Somewhat hoppier than expected with an earthy spice flavor mingled with damp grain, rather musky as it goes along. Not at all Maerzen like, more like a Dortmunder Export. This is at the bottom of the list of the many Oktoberfests that hit the shelves this time of year."
"Can't wait to have it again & I do encourage trying it on tap!"
"O: An ok beer not really in my taste range but maybe drink it again on tap to see the difference."
"Edit: I will buy this one again in the fall just to see if its freshness had anything to do with my negative tasting. I don't have high hopes though"
"1L bottle at my local biergarten. I am going against the grain on this one and rate it one of my top 10 oktoberfest biers. Poured clear, bright golden with faint shimmers of copper, just a dusting of head stuck around. The aroma was sweet with notes of corn syrup and caramel at first. Hoppage was on the light side with some fruity and leafy presence. The flavor opened with lemon zest and almost oaky sourness on the tip of the tongue. Syrupy sweetness rolled in and ended up supporting a bit more of the lemon and some spicy bitterness. Finished sweet with caramel and corn. Light-medium bodied and tangy on the palate (which interfered with clearly evident underlying smoothness)."
"Overall: It's actually been a while since I had this so I am doing this largely from memory. Very different from other beers in this style. Maybe this is a more accurate representation of the style?"
"Overall, I was disappointed. This is not what I expected for the style. It isn't bad, just average."
"Time to get into the fall spirit with some nice fest beers. This one pours a golden yellow with 1 finger of head that fades to a thin cap with chunky lacing. The aroma is very sharp and crisp, with hints of lemon and a slight yeastiness. The taste starts out thin and bland, with a lot of carbonation and an unpleasant bitterness. Some hints of sweetness in the middle before a fast, fairly clean finish. Nothing too special about this beer."
"D - it's not bad, I could drink this for a while but it certainly does not fit the profile of beer that I thought I was drinking"
"Notes: Really doesn't deviate much from the Verum. It tastes alright, but not a great Oktoberfest."
"A good session brew that I wouldn't turn down."
"Pours an ultra-clear golden color. A fine-bubbled white head patches to the glass. Smell is there, some toasted malts and some grassy quality. Taste has a bit more mineral quality to it, but has a very nice toasted malt finish. Very smooth and easy to drink. Nothing exceptional about this beer, but I feel like it is definitely above average."
"D-very drinkable, the thing with oktoberfest beers is that you're going to be drinking large amounts of it if in the right setting. i definitely want to drink large amounts of this. i could have as many german yards of this as it would take for me to pass out."
"Not a distinguished marzen, but a nice taste, well balanced, and really drinkable. Goes down easy, and encourages you to go for more."
"(D)- A good Oktoberfest with an extremely good drinkability; lighter for the style, but good."
"This is not a good representation of the style by any means. I think they got the Pilsner tanks mixed up with the Marzen tanks. It's like a macro pilsner with artificial sweetener."
"had on tap @ old chicago it came a dark amber color with a frash tan ring,,smell was grain malt and peat moss smells..taste was malty.caramel,some toffee with earthy tastes noble hops were in the background but not prominent ..mouth feel was medium with lots of earthy malts and grain tastes.an easy one to drink but not real tasty..its one to try this time of year however"
"D - Sure why not but there are better Fests out there. Worth a try but what beer isn't?"
"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. Gold with a tinge of amber in color, with a nice light-tan head that fizzles out quickly. Grainy, sweet aroma, bready German malts. Flavor is malty but a little heavy on the sweetness. I like a more bready earthy lager; it's less tiresome on the palate. A little sticky through the finish. Achieves what it's going for but it's not something to revisit."
"While too high for a session beer, one could easily go round after round, while relaxing with friends or watching a game. Not pretentions or hugely over the top, this one is just well done."
"Drinkability- Good. I would buy this again."
"Appearance is a golden amber with a fair crisp head and no lace. Smell is a biscuity sweet malt. Taste of biscuity grain with a light malt sweetness and a light hoppy dry finish. Mouthfeel has a smooth light - medium body and good carbonation. A good easy drink, not bad, but not the best Oktoberfest I've had."
"Drinkability: very, especially for the season."
"Pours a golden sunshine and copper color with ok bubbling and a very quick head. The aroma is pilsner malts with a little extra toast to them. This smells just like the flagship Warsteiner pilsner, but with just a little toastiness. This beer tastes just like the flagship Warsteiner pilsner, just a little toastier. I wouldn't be surprisewd if it was teh exact same recipe, with maybe some caramel malts thrown into the mix. Very drinkable beer, just doesn't have a hell of a lot of character."
"this beer pours a very light golden yellow color with a white head that recedes quickly to a thin layer of lace. the aroma presents a very light amount of malt character and of course a touch of the yeast esters. the taste brings a bit of sweet malt and not a lot else. a surpriseing amount of body for the lack of malt in the taste, good carbonation and an easy drink."
"Drinkability: Having said that....it's a nice light beer. Not quite crisp but good enough"
"The lightness of this beer is quite refreshing and feels very good when going down. It is a good beer for the fall seasib but is light so could be good for a warmer day then mid to late October."
"D: A nice beer, but I'm not exactly sure what makes this one an Oktoberfest as compared to their regular offering as this is one of the lightest Oktoberfest beers I've ever tasted. Virtually no malts for a style which typically is quite malty."
"Notes: This was a very basic but very drinkable Oktoberfest beer. I did enjoy it but I would have loved more head retention!!!"
"I had this on tap at Capone's. It is a light amber with a moderate white head. The aroma is sweet and bready. The flavor profile is sweet with toasted malts and the finish lingers a bit. The beer went down smooth for a full bodied brew. A solid brew."
"Don't expect an award winner here, but it was a solid drinkable beer. Not bad, I would drink it again."
"Pours a pale orange/deep yellow color (nice German brewed coloring) with some very nice head and a bit of lacing. Nice clean and malty scent, with just a hint of spiciness. Great flavor, a nice and deep maltiness, thick with a nice caramel tone to it. Went down great. Very nice Oktoberfest."
"Overall- Non offensive and an easy drinker."
"medium to light bodied. smooth mouthfeel. prolly wouldnt want to drink too many of these in a night, not my favorite style, but thats just my opinion."
"D - Quite nice. It doesn't have quite the richly integrated character of the ideal Marzen, but it's worth a try. I could easily drink a couple of these."
"Drinkability is higher than expected, a unique twist on and Oktoberfest. Good to try during the season if you grow tired of the ""normal"" Marzen style. NOTE - This is not a typical example of the style though, but I did enjoy it more than any other Warsteiner to date."
"Comes out of the tap a clear amber with a decent white head. Aroma is strong, crisp, malty and slightly fruity, mainly banana. Flavor is malty and crisp with a firm undertone of banana and just a hint of caramel. Texture is smooth and only slightly fizzy, rather pleasing."
"Pours a soapy, white head and is quite ""fizzy"". Smell is decent, of a touch of caramel malt, a husky grain and almonds, possibly. Very smooth taste, a bit of a harsh ""twang"" at the end. I can taste the husky grain, not much on the caramel flavours. Very easy to drink. Highly carbonated. Really refreshing but not a top notch beer."
"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, not a good representation of style, there aren't a lot of qualities that make this beer anything like a typical O-Fest and overall, it's not a beer that I would want to drink again."
"Overall it is a solid Oktoberfest, with nothing off-putting about it. It goes down smoothly and is easily a good choice for an Oktoberfest session. Not the first Oktoberfest I will grab but maybe closer to October 3rd this is what I would go for to break up the ""monotony""."
"Tastes like a grassy, bready and citrusy lager, not bad. My first octoberfest, hopefully they get much better than this!!"
"Drinks easy, could surely spend hours on end downing these in a biergarten."
"The beer pours a golden color with a thin fizzy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a dry, pilsner malt scent with a faint Munich malt sweetness and next to no hop aroma. The taste is below average. It has a very bland pilsner flavor with an ultra dry finish. It's got zero Marzen character and little to be festive about. The mouthfeel is average. It is a low bodied beer with too much CO2. This is a beer for the scrap heap. It's a poor example of the style."
"D - This is a very session-able beer. There are no strong flavors here, but what is here is done well. I found it very much like the original Warsteiner."
"If you remember college and losing at Beiruit, how the beer you had to drink as a penalty always tasted worse and was hard to get down. Thats what this beer reminded me of."
"D: Not the best Oktoberfest around, but pretty decent. A fairly solid pickup in my book."
"Although this was lighter bodied, it had some character to it. Refreshing and to me, a little different from other marzens. Worked for me."
"Second rewiew on BA so bear with me... I got a 12 of this at CentralMarket today - really like this, much more than I thought i would. Poured into tall glass - nice head with lots of small bubbles below - very lively carbonation. Head held for a little while then drops to small white ring round the edges. Smell is very pleasant and nice- smells like a nice fall day. The first beer i ever had was in Germany - in high school and this took me there. Also made me think of a beer garden in the early cool fall and made me want to sit outside the rest of the day.... Color is light light amber or darker yellow depending on light. First sip is great - very balanced malt and biscuit/yeasty flavor. Taste like an early fall day somehow. Very lively mouthfeel followed by something spicy or clove... lingers as well and is very pleasant. Another review said this beer was elegant and I would have to agree. This is exactly what i hoped for from a German Octoberfest beer. Thinking of it now - this is exactly what i wish more American beers would go for - simple and GOOD, very clean but lively at the same time- this is what Bud/Miller/Coors should taste like. This is a great beer for sitting in the back yard, enjoying the day and waiting of October to get here. Will get again - soon..."
"$0.02"
"D- lucky for me to get a 12 of this mid-summer and it's still good n fresh. funny how a style i used to hate is now one of my favorites."
"Clear golden with a fluffy white head that fades fast. Toffee and light butterscotch with a bready yeastiness. A pretty light looking and smelling example of the style. Light caramel maltiness, noble hops and fresh bread come to mind, finishes dry. Light bodied and refreshing. This is the beer that is served every year at a big local Oktoberfest celebration in Indy every year and even though it's not a really great fest brew it brings back personal memories for me. I look forward to hoisting a 2 liter boot of this at the end of every summer."
"Poured from a brown bottle into a weizen glass. Has a pale yellow color with about a 1/2 inch of head. Aroma was somewhat skunky. Tasted somewhat malty and decent but not overpowering flavor. there is a slight aftertaste. Feels good in the mouth and is fairly drinkable. Overall a pretty good beer."
"I can see why people drink liters, upon liters of this stuff. It's good. I'm gonna need some more pretzels."
"Crisp and dry finish, an easy drinking German classic. They do a hellva job with your ""basic"" beers. Decent price for a sixer, I wouldn't turn my nose up at this one."
"Thin mouthfeel, decently drinkable."
"I have to wonder if the negative reviewers here are judging this alongside cedar-sharp American IPA-style beers; I had a Warsteiner Okt last night after an IPA style and found it odd by comparison. The Warsteiner also needs pouring into a glass to open its flavors up, and it can seem a tad sharp and wallpaper-cleaner tasting sipped out of a bottle--but enough reservations--shove them out of the way. This is a very mature tasting Oktoberfest beer with a nice balance of grain flavors with moderate sharpness, a bare touch of sweetness--balanced as a $300 Mont Blanc pen--a strong (as in, nice-to-have) grain fundament is in the flavor. On in its own terms (that is, if it the first beer you get, and in a glass), it is one of the best beers of this autumn. I have tasted no American Okt beer remotely like this, though, I have to say. It will not slap you about the head with grapefruits and cedar branches. It will taste like an old school, elegant beer."
"i didn't mind this but didn't really like it much compared to the other o-fest offerings. this might be the worst o-fest i have ever tasted and the high price makes for a bad deal overall. not really recommended."
"Taste: Pretty much a sweeter, less hoppy Warsteiner, and not really much of an Oktoberfest. Light, sweet, biscuity malts, and mild but very grassy hops. Less of the hard, mineral-water bite than standard Warsteiner, but it lurks in the background behind the sugary sweetness. Really not much beyond a fairly drinkable euro-lager."
"D: On the whole this is just a really middle-of-the-road beer. It simply doesn't have enough personality to hold your interest."
"Perhaps the lightest beer to ever call itself an Oktoberfest that has crossed my lips, Warsteiner's offering is really barely average. It goes ok with simple food, I guess... I wouldn't turn this down if offered, but there's no reason to seek this out, either."
"Pours a clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, one-finger creamy white head, with some sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, with some spices. The taste is malty, sweet, and some spice. Medium body. Drinkable, not too bad."
"Clear gold with hardly any apparent carbonation. A creamy head sits on top, shrinking to a nice bubbly topping. Light and clean aroma...grain, doughy sweetness. More like a mild German pilsner with a touch of darker malts. Sweet, toasty grain flavor. Not bad...kind of ""sticky"" feeling, almost cloying. Hints of leafy hops way in the back. Medium-light body. Drinkable - not all that interesting."
"D - This was a surprisingly good oktoberfest. Very mild with excellent emphasis on the malt."
"Pours a toasted straw color with an average white head that settled into a slight cap. The aroma is of bready Munich malt with some peppery hop spice, quite Pils like. The taste is a sweet doughy caramel malt, spicy noble hop, a touch of a lime sourness. Definitely on the dry end of the Oktoberfest scale, more of a malty Pils. The feel is light, almost watery, good carbonation, finishes dry and astringent. A different Oktoberfest, average. Cross between an Oktober and Pils. Easy drinking, good conversion brew."
"Easy to drink and very refreshing. It has some taste to it, not bad."
"Presentation: Packaged in a 330 milliliter custom brown glass longneck bottle with a pop-off crown. Served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Overall just an average at best beer of this type. One bottle is all I'd be interested inhaving, not because it was horrible or anything but it wasn't memorable and there are plenty of better brews of this style around."
"Pours an golden orange with a big white head. Smell is faint and of alcohol. Taste is of toasty malt, quite dry, with a good amount of bittering hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is thin, carbonation levels high. Pretty drinkable, though not as good as other Oktoberfests. Sort of a disapointment, Warsteiner's other beers are better IMO."
"Pours a dark yellow/light orange with a frothy white head. The smell is malty, some sweet notes, and toasted malt, an inviting beer. The taste is similar, sweet and malty, not a huge flavor but still good. The mouthfeel is light, with a good balance of carbonation. This is a smooth drinker, nice and easy. This is an easy drinker, good beer for all. Enjoy."
"D - this is okay and easy to take down. Probably my least favorite of this style that I have tried this year, but that doesn't mean it wasn't enjoyable."
"For the price, I have no problem kicking back a few now and then, but one day I'll have some money and won't ever have to drink this again."
"D: An easy drinker, and a pretty decent example of the style (and at a good price, too). I'll buy this one again."
"D - This is a really good O-Fest straight from the region who's inhabitants started that crazy party tradition. I'd drink this again, but it's nothing to get super excited about."
"D: I could celebrate Oktoberfest with a gallon of this stuff. That is if nothing better was available... I good beer though"
"I liked it, buy just one though. Helmut Kohl."
" Warsteiner Oktoberfest was very clear and light orange/gold in color. It had a white head decent retention. The aroma with lightly toasted grain. It tasted like the pilsner with a little sweet toasted malt thrown in. The finish was dry. Mouthfeel was light for the style . Drinkability was good. This beer was basically an Oktoberfest light."
"I feel compelled to call this beer average but it's really just slightly above. Pours a golden copper color, head is light and pillowy and dissipates quickly. Lacing is thin but very pronounced and high on the glass. The mess is strange, like german honey and hillsides. The taste is more slightly bread but mostly malt is what you get here. There is a strange roundness to the mouthfeel but the aftertaste leaves you longing. I've had worse but I've certainly had much better. Try a single but pass on a six."
"Overall, this is a pretty good Oktoberfest at a great price."
"Pours golden with a thin white head. Good retention and nice lacing. Aroma is of bread,grain and malt. Body is on the light side of medium with lots of carbonation. Taste has a honey bready edge. Sweet up front with a jucyfruit finish. Worth a try for sure."
"Pretty drinkable while going down, it does leave a blandish aftertaste. It has a surprising drinkability for all the drawbacks. Still, it's not worth getting this one when there are smoother, tastier, better examples of the style that are just as easily attainable."
"Not bad, but a little lacking in the flavor department. Wouldn't be my go to beer for Marzen."
"D: This is pretty much a middle of the road marzen, similar to what I found in their Helles. Inexpensive for an import, I'll give it that, but there are much more enjoyable and tasty German examples out there."
"Very unpleasant and not good at all. Don't even bother with this beer."
"Really, a poor example of the style."
"This is one of the best Oktoberfest beers I've had, though admittedly I'm not a big marzen fan. It looks like a classic marzen, with a deep auburn transparent color that almost glows in the late summer light. But, unlike many marzens, this one pours an outstanding soft white head that pumps up to three fingers deep, and has great retention over a leisurely quaff, leaving a lovely diffuse lacing on the glass as you go. Through the head, a soft but pronounced fruity bouquet entices you to allow your nose to linger over the glass. The flavor on the palate does not disappoint, with a malty semi-sweet character quickly evolving into pure malt on the front and middle of the palate, but finishing with a slight hoppy transient bitterness that subsides to leave the malt persistent in the aftertaste. The full smooth mouthfeel combines with a perfect carbonation that makes this beer very drinkable. This beer is perfect for the late-summer waning heat, as the evenings prolong into the early autumn coolness. A great seasonal session beer, but with an ABV of 5.9% the sessions should be on the weekend or holidays."
"MF&D - Thin bodied, crisp and easy drinking. A lot lighter and less flavorful than one would think of as an Oktoberfest beer, but not a bad beer to session all day Sunday, while watching the NFL."
"Drinkability: Average and easy to drink."
"D- I struggled with this one big time and gave a lot of the bottles I had away. No thanks."
"Drinkability is okay. This beer was brewed to drink all day, but it doesn't follow the general mode that is needed. Too many hops for constant drinking."
"Light stuff..."
"What a disappointment, probably the worst Oktoberfest I've ever had. It's a poor representative of the style and not one I'll ever revisit."
"mouth feel is nice and light. drinkability is there."
"Drinkability - ridiculously drinkable off the tap, far better than the bottled version."
"Instead of an orangish or even reddish hue, received a pale yellow beer with little head. A faint sweet smell (caramel, honey) with very little spices and no real hop presence to speak of. A fairly weak body, with a mostly hoppy taste. Some citric notes come from this hop presence, but there is no spiciness, thick caramel/other malt taste and dryer finish that I assoiciate with a Marzen. A rather piddling effort."
"D - Its an okay beer it would probably be better in a colder season I'd try this again but I'm not in a hurry to"
"Clear straw yellowish-orange is the color of the beer, topped off by a big fizzy head. A little grass and skunk in the aroma, not very pleasing. Fortunately the taste is okay. Very simple lager with a sweet note. A kick of alcohol then numbs the tongue. It's very light bodied for an O-Fest, similar feel to a pale lager. I wasn't impressed by this beer."
"Drinkabilty: Well, it was better than anything else they had at the party, so I had 5 or 6 over the course of the evening. I wouldn't be seeking this out on purpose...."
"D: A decent grain bill and well balanced brew makes this pretty satisfying."
"I would have bet a lot of money that I wouldn't run across a beer as bad as Warsteiner Premium Fresh (a low alcohol beer). Wrong again. I'm pretty damn sure this is the worst Oktoberfest in the long, storied history of Oktoberfests. If it isn't, I don't want to taste whatever is."
"Had this on-tap at the Balloon Fiesta in Albuquerque in 06. (they had a large seating area set up just for Warsteiner) Pours golden amber with a head that doesnt stick around too long. Nose is virtually non-existent. Flavor seemed to have a fruity edge to it and it seems to stay on your mouth for some time. Feel is thick and frothy. Definitely drinkable, but one of the weakest of the style I have ever had."
"I was pretty unimpressed by this beer, considering the quality Oktoberfests I've had this year. There's just not much flavor past your standard corn-mash and bitter-ish hops you would find in any other run of the mill Euro lager. This was maybe a touch sweeter, but it didn't really do it for me. Mouthfeel was carbonated and on the thin side. You sould drink them, but why? There are far superior Oktoberfests here, both craft and German. I'd pass."
"What a joy this brew turned out to be. I have not enjoyed a Warsteiner like this before; and this may be my new favorite Oktoberfest. Im glad I stumbled upon it."
"Overall Impression: Wow, my least favorite Oktoberfest so far. Something funky in there thats not clean or malty. Cant recommend this one at all."
"Drinkability: While I usually like my marzen to have more body and complexity, this is an easy drinking satisfying beer with balanced flavors and mild alcohol. I could easily put a sixer away while playing the ""air"" tuba. Oompah, Oompah..."
"pours a light golden color with a bit white frothy head that doesn't leave an ounce of lacing. has a great malty smell to it, but no hops are present. taste is ok, has a good clean taste but nothing that really jumps out at me. its kinda watery but i can drink them all night long since its a realitvely good beer and is pretty cheap"
"Overall a decent beer thats easy enough to drink."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This beer is light bodied and of a higher carbonation, nothing at all like an Oktoberfest. The label is misleading, damn this beer to hell, damn Warsteiner to hell, may they burn forever. My their beer always be spoiled and infected. I am actually not sorry to say that I will never buy this beer again. Infact were I you, I'd not ever buy this beer, it is not an Oktoberfest, it is Warsteiner trying to con the man into thinking that this is something different, sure all the fratties that drink this will say ""Wow, there is so much difference!"" but fuck that, this is pretty much the same damned thing! Sure its easy to drink, but I want something for fall, something to celebrate slightly cooler temps, this is not it. This beer is straight out stupid...words cannot express how pissed I am about this beer. Basically, this is not what you're looking for, as a matter of fact noone is looking for this beer, it completely sucks, it is as false as Ashley Simpson on SNL if not more..."
"Drinkability: The Warsteiner Oktoberfest is non-offensive, but not very interesting, either. It's definitely at the lighter end of the Oktoberfest spectrum."
"D: Easy to drink but becomes sweeter and sweeter and the alcohol becomes more and more present."
"Light bodied, very drinkable. this is another Oktoberfest Lite, somewhere between Oktoberfest and a regular European Pale Lager."
"Comment: It was a nice beer and complemented the event well. I'd like to try again with a glass and after fewer ""starter"" beers."
"Head is very large, creamy, and tasty as well! Lacing is excellent as you drink the beer. The taste is the only true downfall as it tastes pretty smooth but a bit light on flavor. There's also a slight undertone of a flavor I cannot identify that gets more pronounced the more you drink this beer."
"It has a very light mouthfeel with almost no lingering after taste and one could drink several of these in a session but there are far better Oktoberfest brewers out there, in my opinion."
"Tends toward a flat, syrupy mouthfeel. Makes it seem much heavier than it is. Really not impressed with this brew and with so many other Oktoberfests available I'm not sure why you'd choose this one. Definitely a product aimed at Americans familiar with the Warsteiner name but not necessarily classic Oktoberfests."
"A nice solid brew that is very drinkable. But there's nothing I can detect that makes this an Octoberfest beer. There's a lot better out there."
"Tastes like a slightly stronger version of the Warsteiner pils, which is alright as far as it goes, but it's not a very good oktoberfest."
"Got this one on-tap at the Berkley Front in Berkley, MI. Poured a light brown-amber color with a bit of off-white head on top. No real lacing. Nose was mild, a touch of spicy malt. Taste was similar, although it had a little bit more to it. Caramel malt, brown sugar, and then some ginger spiciness in the middle. A very light hop character came through at the end. Feel was a little thin, but with fairly good carbonation. This one wasn't bad, although I'm looking forward to trying a few more robust Oktoberfests this year."
"Had this brew on tap last evening and was my only mistake of the evening. The brew poured to a light golden color with an amber hue. Had hardly any head and left no real lacing. The aroma was of caramel malts leading to a sweet scent. The taste is very grainy, and not in a good way, mixed with a somewhat sweet taste from the malt. The flavor just seems to be missing something, this is not a very good brew and I feel a pretty poor Octoberfest compaired to Hacker-Pshorr and Paulaner"
"On tap a pint at Pizza Plant. Fresh with abundant lace and white head, apple juice appearance of body. Taste is a bit complex, with fruity toasty nutty malty character. Nothing tremendous. Fizzy carbonation detracted. Ayinger was superior vertical on Octoberfest."
"A decent beer, at best, but there are most definitely better versions out there - produced both here and in Germany."
"Pours golden amber in color with a frothy white head that soon fades into a thin lace. Nose is sweet malt along with some grassy notes. Taste has some sweet caramel malt along with fresh grain and some herbal hop bitterness. Quite light for the style. Not terrible, but there are better Oktoberfests to be had."
"One of the many beers I got to sample at the Oktoberfest Zinzinnati. Very good Oktoberfest beer. Medium brown in color but appeared to be fairly clear. Drinking out of plastic fest cups, so difficult to get a full read on the appearance. Smell was nice, lightly hopped, semi-sweet aroma. Flavor had a nice slightly malty sweetness with a touch of roastiness. Very easy drinking and light mouthfeel."
"Overall a decent German macro Oktoberfest. Certainly not as complex of a malt profile as other offerings, but certainly drinkable."
"This Oky sets itself apart from others in style."
"I sampled this beer at the Virginia Beach Octoberfest on Oct 16th. Disappointed that the beers were served in opaque plastic cups. Sorta guessing at the color, but it looked amber colored and clear as much as I could see it. Nice head, typical carbonation and good head retention and lacing. This is a good tasting beer, very comparable to the Sam Adams Octoberfest I enjoyed last week. The mouthfeel was just right. Light but not watery with no aftertaste other than a good beer taste. I would drinkg this beer again. Enjoyable either for sipping or as a session beer."
"Had in a 1 liter glass at brewery night at the Flying Saucer. Feeling pretty good after that one. Bar was darkish so hard to tell color but looked golden. Had a light bouquet. Small head (but not sure how long it sat before being delivered) and some carbonation. Overall had a good taste with a slight bitter taste at the end. Good but not great beer. Avery Kaiser kicks its butt."
"A very nice beer. Not overly complicated, not outstanding; just pure and simple. A golden-copper, crystal clear hue, moderately carbonated and forms a 1/2"" white head with a little lacing. Smells softly of barley malt, caramel, toffee, and spiciness. Flavors of classic german pilsner flavors with a little toasty quality. Throw in a bit of caramel and toffee. Spicy with added noble hops. No off flavors. Body is medium and airy. Finish is fleeting, but not dry or abrupt. Very clean and crisp. A well brewed beer, but not a favorite among high gravity lovers."
"A special keg at the Royal Falconer in Riverside Ca. to commemorate Oktoberfest, this beer had a golden-orange translucent color with 1/4 inch white head that quickly settles. Aroma is very slight, was expecting more, but the flavor made up for it- malty, creamy, orange sode like with incredible drinkability. Slight hop kick at the end, just enough to keep interesting. Oktoberfest beers are not generally complex, or overpowering, but they are so bloody drinkable, and this is a very good example."
"One of my favorite O'fests this year, and last year."
"This is a dumbed-down bier and a classic example of how a very large brewery can lose track of taste and concentrate on mass producing."
"Pours the colour of tea with a nice frothy white head. Smell is of malt with some caramel notes. Taste is average. Nothing to get excited about. Very easy drinking however. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for a Marzen. Overall this beer is not in the top 10 must drink Oktoberfest. This probably is along the lines of Becks Ofest. A mediocre attempt by a huge brewer to sell an Oktoberfest."
"This came with an inch and half head over a nice golden colored brew. The was a slight smell of malt but not much else. This tastes malty and sweet. It's a very light beer and quite drinkable. However, I expected a little more from Warsteiner in there Oktoberfest."
"After so many Oktoberfests this season, the Warsteiner was nothing to write home about. Though not a terrible beer, it's not something I would actively seek out again either."
"Quaffable, yes. But nevertheless, one of the least inspired German festbiers I've tried."
"This golden brew had good head retention and some nice crusty lace at the top of the glass. A decent lager but off the mark as a fest. I was looking for a deeper color and a lot more maltiness. The bitterness was there but it left a bit of pasty dryness where I was looking for some malt body."
"Not bad. Lighter than most Oktoberfests. Many are a medium to dark brown or even a nice cherry stain color, this one was dark tannish-gold with a small white head. Ther was some mild, sweet malt under the herbally hops in the aroma. Tastes a lot like regular Warsteiner except there is a light caramelly malt sweetness added into the mix. This is an extremely drinkable, but seems a little light for style."
"Light, transparent honey color with a white bubbly head. Low sweet malt aroma. Flavor is a light sweet malt, with doughey highlights, and hints of flowers. Light hoppy finish, and a lingering sweet flowery aftertaste. Mouthfeel is tingly and crisp. Not blown away at first, but I'm warming up to it. The more I sip, the more flavors that rise up out of it. One of the best of the very traditional German Oktoberfest beers."
"An absolutely spectacular octoberfest marzen, in the lighter true german style, not the heavier, darker sytle brewed for american tastes.. Incredibly clean, pronounced flavors. This is probably one of my favorite octoberfest beers so far."
"On draught at the German Village Oktoberfest. I guess this is a newer offering from Warsteiner and isn't a terrible attempt. Hazy orange color with a thin light beige head. More hops than malt in the aroma, which is kind of a change in this style for me. Medium-bodied and almost over-carbonated with the hop profile dominating, although the malt begins to assert itself a little more on the backswing. The finish is rather slick. This isn't a great beer by any stretch but it does the job nicely on a cold Oktoberfest evening."
"In the glass a translucent golden amber color with the head modest in size, frothy in its texture, the color a bright white, lace forms a decent sheet upon the glass. Hints of caramel sweetness in the nose, crisp and clean, start is sweet, top is skeletal in its feel upon the palate. Finish is crisply acidic, hops pertinent to the style, aftertaste dry and long lasting, average at best."
"Light chesnut color, lighter than most O'fest brews. However, the Europeans and in particular the Germans, do well to brew light colored beers with a lot of flavor. This one fits into that catagory. Not deviating from the syle, the emphasis is on the malt here. It takes on a caramel, bready character then shifts to nutty and spicy. Carbonation and mouthfeel on the mark. A respectable O'fest brew enjoyed tonight at the local Oktoberfest. Prosit!"
"Now, I know you think I'm kidding but the nose on this beer was stale cigarette ashes - and I'm not kidding. I went back to it several times and that is as accurate as I can possibly be. Cigarette ashes. The look is pale gold and out of style, but the flavor is semi-sweet and a bit thick, actually not too bad. Actually, everything is average but that odd nose."
"(Old score: 4/2.5/2.5/3/3)"
"Light for a Marzen brew, Warsteiner Oktoberfest is more of a pale amber -- almost bold yellowish-orange -- than the copperish, mid-amber I've come to expect from the style. Decent malty sweetness though a bit bland. Cleans up with a nice, lightly hopped finish. It was a good-drinkin' beer for sure -- but not enough to inspire an amazing review."
