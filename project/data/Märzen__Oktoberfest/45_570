4,9.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Mild bread, malt, kettle sugar and spice aromas. Not much hop on the nose and no diacetyl. It pours brilliant copper tinted amber under a very lightly tan tinted 3‚Äù white foam cap that fairly quickly dissipates. Rich malt flavors with slight kettle sugar sweetness, grainy spiciness, no fruit, finishing dry with a moderate hop bitterness. High end of medium on the body with slightly below medium carbonation.","pat61","Mar 05, 2015"

A deep fiery red-bronze color with quick breaking beige head; some light creamy bubbles cling persistently around the rim of the glass. Aroma is rich toasty malts, raisins, brown sugar, and ethereal grassy hops. Faint whiff of grainy alcohol. Delivers some wonderfully authentic Munich malt flavor. I get brown bread, slightly tart fruit (almost citric or perhaps Granny Smith apple), sweeter dark fruit (raisins and plums), a touch of molasses and burnt caramel. Considerable malty depth, with a sturdy medium body and medium-heavy carbonation. Finishes semi-dry I suppose, with some lingering grass/hay, pepper, and orange peel (!) notes. Malts from the genuine source make all the difference here, along with tasteful hopping. One of my favorite widely available O-fests.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 02, 2014"

This beer had good drinkability, It was smooth, fairly clean, crisp, not filling at all and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, I could drink more than a few of these without getting tired of it.  What I like the most about this beer was was how true to style it was, it was just what I expect from a American made Marzen.  What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, the head and lacing could have been a little better.  I would buy this beer again when in the mood for the style and I would recommend it to anyone who likes the style, it's just a nice example of a Marzen.  All in all I was happy with this beer, it had all the aspects that I was looking for and it came together to make for a enjoyable Marzen.  This is one of the better beers I have had from this brewery, but isn't a favorite of the style.  Nice job guys, this was a tasty Marzen, keep up the solid work.","StoutHunter","Sep 25, 2014"

Goes down with the fruit blend mentioned above, light crispness, on the dry side and a quiet amount of sweetness. goes down like a fine spirit.

The beer taste is a bit hoppier than I'm comfortable with but it doesn't detract too much from the taste even though it's supposed to be sweeter. Rather, the hops add an interesting orange note to it at the end. The beer taste also has various malt notes such as sweet and bready besides the hop notes.

Other than that the beer is a beautiful orange/brown cloudy color with a 1 finger head when poured into a goblet glass.  There is a fine mixed spice smell that translates nicely to the front half of this beer.  The one dominate spice on the back half brought this beer down slightly for me.  Body is solid.  Best offering by Brooklyn of those I have had - will seek out other new Brooklyn beers, something that I was avoiding in recent months.","gonzo000","Sep 14, 2014"

Beautiful full head with thick lacing and excellent retention. Excellent amber red color with active carbonation. Full Oktoberfest lager aroma-- bread, caramel, and malts. Bold coffee and toffee front palate notes. Butterscotch and hops. Mid-palate a bite of lemon and pepper. Lager skunk hop notes with full fading into malty goodness. Back palate is a crisp hop note-- bitters and coffee. Almost a hint of stout. Good mouthfeel. Slightly wet, but full of flavor. Very drinkable. Full, complex, and well rounded character. Easily the best Oktoberfest this year I've had. Wonderful. A real classic marzen take on the style. Very well done-- bordering on excellent. 4.0 out of 5. Very good.

3.8,4.4,3.5,4,3.75,3.25,4,"Final Grade: 3.80, a respectable B+. Brooklyn's Oktoberfest Beer is a solid lager that delivers virtually everything I expect from a marzen - good malt-forward flavour with a firm German hop bill to counter it, as well as a nice, light, sessionable nature. A little overcarbonated for my tastes, and not my favourite Brooklyn beer by a longshot, but this is still one of the better marzens I've tried so far. Something worth picking up if you're in the market for a balanced autumn ale, and a great selection for my 499th review.","thehyperduck","Sep 26, 2013"

I smell lager yeast right away, and a sweeter german caramunich malt type that contributes most of the color and fermentables here. simple but flavorful taste. dessert breads, honey, even slight maple in the finish. I still think I like sam adams better than most other commercially available octoberfest brews, but the Brooklyn is right up there. highly drinkable, but I would add a bit more carbonation to make it glide along a little better. it gets a touch weighty, especially as it warms up, and a little more gas would fix this. a good American tip of the cap to german tradition. a very well made beer.","StonedTrippin","Sep 09, 2013"

The high carbonation and overt bitterness made this less smooth and round than I would have liked. If I were to consult on their recipe, I would tone down the alkalinity along with the carbonation, and bring in some lighter malt to round out the roasty quality and bring more complexity to the taste. Also, more dextrins could help with the mouthfeel and the sad head.","BethanyB","Aug 27, 2013"

The taste is very good, the malt flavors here are very well-developed, with just a touch of nuttiness rounding out the excellent roasted and caramel malt flavors. A solid dose of herbal and earthy hops make the finish nicely bitter. The mouthfeel is on the heavier side of light bodied, and decently carbonated.

Very malty mild chocolate starting semi-sweet ending semi-dry. Mouthfeel was on the thinner side of medium. Not watery, but rather very drinkable. My first couple experiences with Marzens were... meh. Despite that, I have revisited the style this year with some great finds. This one was a gift and definitely the best find. Thanks Jay. Without hesitation I would say Brooklyn Oktoberfest is my favorite Marzen to date, and I would recommend this to anybody in the mood for something malty to put them in the spirit of Autumn.","Justin23060","Oct 29, 2012"

Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, pear, and light herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of pear, caramel, nuttiness, biscuit, and light herbal spiciness on the finish for a short bit. Good amount of flavor with decent balance; no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel.

Good structure, with a tasty malt profile that shows off the caramel/butterscotch well. The only disappointment is how the body peters out in the finish. If you're tasting Oktoberfests, do the Germans first, as they'll seem thin and sparse if they have to follow this.

The aroma suggests deep brown bread grains and mild maple malt. Not bad at all. The flavor follows with a more cidery-malt with vague sweet potato-pumpkin and a touch of herbal hops. Basically a fairly sweet malt concoction with some subtle spice. This is medium bodied with meager carbonation in this particular sample, leaving a bit of a glassy, aqueous feel.

4,9.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass. Pours a nice golden/amber fairly clear and clean with a small off white head. Spot lacing that fades rather quick. Smell is what you would think from a marzen. Spice and pumpkin notes with some honey and cloves. Some earthy wheat. Not a strong eroma, but adequate. Taste is pretty straight forward with a nice mix of spices, malts and a touch of hops. Nothing complex, but decent. Easy on the palate and bread notes add to the taste. Feel is a good bit of carbonation that makes it dry and a touch thin. Overall- A pretty solid marzen that is refreshing and has a session quality to it. Enjoy the spices and earth flavor, but a little thin. Nothing spectacular, but I wouldn't turn one down. Another solid brew by Brooklyn, pretty tasty-","TheDinger","Nov 13, 2011"

The taste ramps up the orange and adds a good amount of clove to the proceedings. Other than that, things follow the plan put forth by the smell.

A short, stately looking head from the pour, lacing satisfactory. Rather deep orange-red hue, heavy on the orange. Aroma is moderately spot-on, though somewhat subdued and dry - dry and malty in a northern English brown sense, if that makes sense. Malty base, yet of mild intensity, and a light nuttiness.

Flavor profile is (of course) massive on the malts: tons of toast and bread rolls, with a slight, earthy bitterness to establish order. Medium body is quite smooth; finishes with a sort of toast-meets-low-sugar-toffee taste [another way that I sometimes think of this flavor is an "unsweetened Tootsie Roll"].

Medium bodied yet easy to slug down. Big warty malty flavors of toasted rolls, marshmallows and some spicy earthy notes. Mouthfeel is under carbonated for me.

The taste is of sweet caramel malt and a bread like finish followed by a hint of bitter hops and grain on the back. This has a bit of chewy malt to it but has is a very balanced beer. The main taste is that sweet malty caramel that is very telling of Oktoberfest styles. Nice carbonation, I think this is a more balanced Oktoberfest than the Paulaner I had earlier this season, which was a little too thick and chewy and heavy on the caramel. This Oktoberfest from Brooklyn offers a nice hint of hop and clean grain to balance it out.","Lldeegan","Nov 03, 2009"

It consists 100% of caramelized malts. I tried smelling the malts but it's not really there. The taste steps it up from the smell. Again you can really taste the sweet caramelized roasted malts, very tasty. Sweeter than most Octoberfests I've had, but extremely tasty. There is a very slight hop aftertaste and burps up a bit hop, but the malts take up most of the flavor. I really wish I could rate the smell 3.75 and 4.25 on the taste so I gave them an even 4 a piece. This is between medium and full bodied, and very drinkable.

This was a good, satisfying Oktoberfest-style beer, but in my opinion Sam Adams Oktoberfest is still better. Quite a bit cheaper, too.

The initial nose suggests fresh baked bread, roasted malt and a light wafting of hops. The body is medium-full, yet soft, sweet and malty with hints of spice. The carbonation is pleasantly light. Attractive lacing does form through-out the glass. This lager is a straight forward thirst-quenching drink. Not overly complex, contemplative or moreish, yet deserving of repeat purchase.

Carbonation can be seen rising in the beer. Smells of pale malts, a bit of hops and some citrus going on here too. Not a very complex smell for this one, not much going on. Taste is lots of pale malts up front with some good hop (citrus,earthy) balance following the malts. Also get a bit of spicyness and no alcohol or off flavors here. Maybe a bit of a grassy flavor in the aftertaste also, but not a bad one. The flavor seems to start to fade toward the end of the glass. Mouthfeel is surprisingly creamy and medium bodied, little-no alcohol warming and a good coating of taste left on the palette to enjoy for minutes after sipping. Very smooth and good carbonation. Drinkability is good, very good taste for an oktoberfest, no alcohol flavor to ruin the beer over time. The only trouble here is I can feel the beer starting to fade a bit at the end of my first glass. Stomach can handle many of these in the long run.

Flavor starts off with a bready/bitter combo and then moves into dark crust and toffee finishing with a bit of earthy hop bite. Feel is a bit bitey from the carbo, medium in weight with a creamy finish. This goes down nice with some German food. The dark toast malt flavors may get a little overwhelming after a few.

The mouthfeel really is a tad bit light and thin, I thought, but it wins points on creaminess. So I figured averaging out the two categories (T & M) with a 3.5 in taste and a 3.0 in mouthfeel was appropriate. Ideally I'd suggest this beer deserves about a 3.25 in each category and an overall score around 3.5 (it did look nice; hence the higher appearance score).

What better time than Oktoberfest to try Brooklyn's interpretation of the Marzen style. The appearance of this brew is a beautiful, lusty copper-bronze with nice steady carbonation bubbles and a thin skin of head after the pour into my nonic glass. The aroma is difficult to discern, but appears as the brew warms in the glass. Bready malt comes thru with perhaps a whiff of butter and turnips. The taste is also bready and full with malty overtones and a slight bitterness and metal in the finish. Again, the flavor becomes more pronounced as it warms up.

As for taste, there is an almond, caramel, metallic taste that isn't bad, but as the carbonation thins, I'm getting too much flat soda notes. There is the typical nutty malts characteristic of the style, and considering I just had a Wachusett Octoberfest that had no resemblance to the name, this one at least is representative of the style, it's just not all that impressive.

The next thing I noticed was this beer's gorgeous shade of amber. Exactly the way I would want an Oktoberfest style beer to look. My first swig was nice and crisp all the way through. Hints of cherries and a bit of citrus with very little lingering after taste. Reasonable complexity as far as lagers that I've tasted go.

The brew starts off with a noticable metallic twang. Tastes like it was brewed with hard water as it has a mineral presence. Caramel and toasted malts mix together with a subtle hop flavor. The feel is moderate and has a creamy texture to it, finishes slightly bitter. Definitely one of the more maltier Oktoberfests that I have tried and one that is more bitter than sweet.","Gmann","Sep 08, 2007"

The taste is dominated by the strong grainy malty presence but also contains a good deal of bitterness and spice from german hops. This Oktoberfest is less sweet and more bitter than others that I've had in the past, I may prefer them to be a bit on the sweeter side.

The aroma is a moderate bready and toasty character with a light honey-kissed sweetness. Nothing wrong here. I am hit with a solid toasty melanoidan character to start, followed by a mild herbal hoppyness that moves to a light bitterness. It finishes with a solid graineyness. The hops just don't accentuate the other flavors in the beer. I feel like they stand out too much where the malt should be the theme of the brew.

The flavor is very rich - like chewing on barley - with caramel, chocolate, and molasses malts, nuts (pecan?), and oily, leafy/green hops that leave a medium bitterness. The body is on the heavy side of medium, with medium carbonation and a medium to long finish.

Those aromas come through in the flavor as well, with the initial sweetness of clover honey, whiskey and even a hint of maple. There¬ís a chewy, doughy middle to this one that leads into a gradually building bitterness. Subtle floral and grassy flavors come through from the hops. It has a round, full mouthfeel, with a slightly syrupy thickness.

Almost reminded me of apple cider or iced tea or even a dark Hefeweizen (it was so cloudy). Very poor head retention with next to no lacing at all. Quite crisp and a little bland from the amount of carbonation present, but any hint of roasted malts or hops is very hidden. Give it some time and a fruity character (apple cider again?!) and a smooth maltiness emerge, but the blandness kicks in then. You wouldn't want to take your time with this one; it's not a sipping beer in which the flavors become more robust with time. Just slightly above average for my taste.","redwolf1","Nov 16, 2005"

Mouthfeel is light medium, with moderate carbonation. Taste is well balanced, with caramel, a hint of chocolate, and an equal measure of hop bitterness. Fruity notes of green apple and pear emerge midway through. Nicely complex for the style, and much more drinkable and balanced than the Stoudt's Oktoberfest that I compared this one to.

The color is a nice deep copper, and poured a nice head in the glass. No real lace to speak of. The smell is the caramel maltiness I expect from this style. Just a hint of the hops. The taste is a nice punch of malt; not too sweet, with the hops balancing the caramel sweetness I detected in the aroma. It has a great medium feel on the tongue, and a wonderful drinkability. Many American breweries struggle with German styles, but Oktoberfests do not seem to present the same challenge. This is a good representation of this beer style that I highly recommend.","carln26","Sep 02, 2004"

Some may consider it to be a little too bold and heavy on the crystal malts, but that's why I like the Brooklyn ales.

Bring on the oompah band. Cheers to Garrett Oliver for another fine creation.","BeerFan","Oct 11, 2003"

There are just enough earthy hops thrown in to keep the malt in balance.  This is one excellently smooth medium bodied brew that makes for maximum drinkability.
