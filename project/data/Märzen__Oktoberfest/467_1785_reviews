"12 ounce can into dimpled mug, best before 1/3/2015. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep orange/copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavor with no overly estery notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and moderately creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice oktoberfest style. All around good robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/bready malt and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"12 oz. can purchased at John's Grocery in Iowa City, unknown brewing/canning date but bottom of the can read ""EB 12/13/14," poured into my Snallygaster 2013 mug and drank over 30 minutes"

"Overall: On its own, I think it's pretty good, and I'd drink it again.  It doesn't all come together quite as well as the ideal Ofests out there...and it suffered in comparison with the Millstream."

"O - Nice beer. better than ok, but not great."
""

""
"I hope I just got a bad batch, because others  have had this and liked it.  The beer I had a metallic taste to it.  It reminded me of a very cheap beer in a can."

"This is one of the higher abv oktoberfest beers I've had, 7.1% .  Its still very tasty and malty for its style, i will look for this again."
""
""
""
"Overall, really enjoyed this nicely layered Marzen. Well done."
"Overall this is a good Oktoberfest beer.  It is not the best I have had but it is very drinkable. NOTE: This is imported therefore I don't know how long it spent on a ship; it might be better fresh."

"12 oz bottle poured into a pilsener glass. Nice, but weak, malty aroma. Good off-white head, fades relatively quickly with some lacing. Dark amber/copper color. Moderate carbonation is just right. Initial taste is fruit. Moderate bitterness comes through. Sweet aftertaste lingers. Good Oktoberfest beer. I'll buy it again."
""
""
"Overall (4.04) : Although it's different from other Marzens I've tried, this beer is pretty good. What sets it apart is its Flanders style sour thing going on in the middle... it's not really intense but it stands out. If you get a chance to try this, do it."

"Pours a pretty copper-amber in color with a thin off-white head like most brews of this style. Just some spotty lacing is seen as well. The aroma is of sweet caramel malts for the most part. More going on with the taste with some toffee, yeast with a hint of nuts. Perfect carbonation and medium bodied. Lots of good flavor and goes down pretty easy. Just a very slight hoppy aftertaste that doesn't last for a few seconds. Overall, a good Oktoberfest brew."

"I really like this beer. After landing in MN. This was in the fridge at the hotel. Great taste, no linger, easy to drink. Marzen style drinkers will like this beer. A little on the front end that I don't care for, but that fades pretty rapidly. Label could use an upgrade, looks like a production beer."

"I find myself trying every Oktoberfest and pumpkin flavored beer I can get me hands on, this one was pretty good! I am a easy going critic as I enjoy just about every beer I've had so... saying that, I still feel there was something missing here. I wish I could place it with words but don't yet have the beer vocabulary to do so. Overall very drinkable though!"

"(O)- Definitely a solid Marzen. Again, a touch sweet for me, but still very enjoyable."

"O-Not a style I'm big on, but some Oktoberfests bring something to the table, this one does not."
""
"Nice to see Summit back in Ohio, this is an Oktoberfest, poured into a 1/2 liter krug, there's a perfectly filtered copper body with a bright light beige head that fills the more than a 1/3rd of the glass. Fine banded lacing with each sip as it slowly dwindles down. Aroma has a nice pleasant cereal grain complexity built into it light herbal hops, almost cider like notes with caramelized sugars evident. Flavor is a bready full on sweetness with malts working overtime, herbal highlights bring a bit of balance but this beer has more than enough residual malts to become borderline cloying, most Oktoberfest beers I enjoy have big malt but manage to still finish crisp and refreshing, the finish here seems a bit unrefined compared to good American versions or the German standbys. Mouthfeel is medium bodied carbonation tickles the back of the throat putting just a bit too much of that element out there, overall I'm glad to have another version to try from Summit still very enjoyable."
""
"O: Enjoyable beer, nice seasonal offering from Summit."
"O - good example of the style, very easy to drink; I'd get it again, especially for the price."

"O: definitely an underrated Oktoberfest. Perfect for a chilly October evening. Try it out"

"Golden yellow with a heavy orangish hue and hazy. Poured with a thick white foam that reduced to a healthy cap that left wet sticky lacings on the glass. Earthy grainy malt aromas with light floral hops at the back end. More reminiscent of a pilsner than a marzen. Medium bodied with tangy, assertive carbonation. Grainy, bready malt and earthy, spicy hops up front and into the middle. Hop spiciness peaks thru the middle and tapers to the end with grainy and toasted malt returning. Finishes crisply with lingering toasted and bready malt flavors."

"Overall â€“ An Oktoberfest that is on the slightly sweeter side with not much hop influence, but a nice easy drinking feel overall. A pleasant and easy drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Fairly dark hue, slight head, and a fair amount of persistent lacing. Nose is sweet with tea and tobacco. Has something of a synthetic air to it. Woody, pungent, with a hint of sweet. Overall, this is a decent quaff."
""
""
""
""
"OI - An excellent Marzen. Somewhat ale-like fruity esters were not apparent last year, and less noble hop character. Still an outstanding example of the style."

"A little stronger in the alcohol department, but it isn't really all that noticeable. This is definitely made in the traditional sense outside of that aspect, lots of Germanic types in the upper midwest, this beer definitely has a following while I was in the area."

"Overall, lacking in complexity of malt base, fairly 2 note. Also a bit on the sweet side."

"Summit Oktoberfest Marzen pairs with Patricia Kass' cd entitled ""Piano Bar."" Specifically check out the Patricia breathing life into the old tired standard 'Autumn Leaves.'"
""
""
""
""

"Unusually light nose, faint blend of nuts and caramel. The flavor is also relatively restrained (as is the ABV content) with some medium-light caramel sweetness combined with nuttiness and the typical marzen light herbal-earth-spice hopping combo. This is pretty much just a by-the-books marzen that is noteworthy for hiding a slightly higher than typical ABV content, and an unfortunately somewhat muted nose."
""
""
"O) A solid fall option, and a good representation of the style. I've been trying to throw some different Oktoberfest into the mix this season, and really, this is one of few I'd reach for again. Glad to recommend..."
""
""
"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight yeast, slight caramel malt, slight nut, hint of earthy malt, slight hop, and a hint of pale malt. Fits the style of a Marzen / Oktoberfest. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of slight hop, sweet malt, slight nut, hint of yeast, slight caramel malt, and a hint of earthy malt. Overall, weak appearance, but good aroma, feel, body, and blend."
""
""
"Unlike most other Oktoberfests, but still very good nonetheless. Very easy to drink and my guess is the ABV sneaks up on you. Would go very well with certain foods, giving a nice filling meal. Glad I tried this one."

"Overall I thought this beer was ok and it was a pretty average example of an American Marzen, it was crisp and clean but it felt a little too bland and it didn't have the balance that the better Marzens have. This beer had ok drinkability, it was pretty smooth, but the flavors didn't really hold my attention, I could probably drink another one, but it wouldn't be my first choice. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance it looked pretty good for it's style with lots of nice head and lacing. What I liked least about this beer was the the bland aroma and the prickly carbonation, if those things were fixed it would be right around above average. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's not hard to find a much better Marzen, I don't really recommend it. All in All this beer was ok at best, but it just couldn't hold my interest, nice try guys but this one needs a little work, I still think Summits a solid brewery but this beer didn't impress me."
"This is a good local Oktoberfest beer! Easy drinking...watch out, I may have fever to polka."

"Oktoberfest Marzen pours a dark golden color, with a decent sized lacy head. A very nice carmalized roasted malty aroma. There is a very nice crisp taste, good malty backbone, strong carmalized flavors, with hints of some spices. Nice crisp taste, full flavor, very drinkable. Overall a very solid marzen style, good full flavors, very well balanced."
""

"Overall- A very good beer. Samuel Adam's Oktoberfest used to be my go to Fall seasonal but this could replace it."
""
""
""
"Overall I got this one for around 2 bucks and was surprised. Pretty stellar Oktoberfest."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A delicious blend of flavors. Very drinkable. I wish this beer were available year round."
""
""
"Overall: Excellent across the board but I wish this had a lower ABV."
""
""
"Look is a dark amber-orange, clear, with a small white head that fades to a ring around the glass. Smell is toasted grain, malt, with a touch of floral, earthy hops. Taste is sweet caramelized malt at first, followed by roasted grain. Burnt toast, pumpkin, spice, light floral/grassy hops. Medium-light feel that is full of malt and feels slightly velvety on the tongue. Decent amount of carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - About half way through the beer, the sweetness becomes more and more cloying as it seems unnatural in this beer. While it's got the maltiness of an Oktoberfest down to a T, it's lacking a crisp hop profile that balances and rounds out the beer, the one aspect which makes the otherwise fuller-bodied beer drinkable in mass quantities. That's certainly not to say that this beer, standing alone, isn't good. In fact, it would be a wonderful transition beer during the cooler fall nights."
""
"Final Thoughts: This is a good brew from a good brewery. It's got a nice malt complexity and would be perfect on a cool autumn afternoon. I'm glad they toned down the abv, it makes this beer more approachable if you are planning on having a longer drinking session."

"O - A rather refreshing, clean Marzen that presents orange-hinted sugars and malt up front with enough hops in the finish for balance and cleansing to prevent them from being cloying. It's surprising to see the ABV above 7%, although there's evidence of it when there's some time between swallows. Close enough to the traditional representatives of the style to qualify, but definitely a crisper, malt-booze take on it. I see future enjoyment of this around a late-nite October bonfire with friends and cigars. Probably won't seek it out, but will buy a sixer when I see it just to have for the right time."
"Enjoyed this while in Minneapolis for an Iowa football game. Can't remember the name of the bar but anyway, a real solid Oktoberfest beer with the perfect amount of malts balanced by a slight amount of hops. Nice copper pour with a white head. Nice smooth malty taste and finish. A nice fall brew."

"A real classic looking marzen oktoberfest beer. A orange amber beer with a thin head. A solid beer with like session drinkability. Nice full body with no overly aggressive feature but with big beer taste. One of the better American craft attempts at a true marzen beer."
"Overall-balanced, enjoyable, spot-on. A great version of the style, one that should be had again and again as things turn colder."
"Btw, lacing is spotty but there."
" ~ This is a decent beer but not something I'll get again. I probably wouldn't recommend this Oktoberfest to a friend seeing as there are better and less expensive brews available."
"Overall- It isnâ€™t bad, just a very run of the mill, ho-hum Oktoberfest / maerzen."
"O-Not one of my favorites. Too thin and not enough malty goodness. Too heavy on lingering aftertaste and CO2 bite for me."
"O- a good oktoberfest. I think it's better than the euro examples."
"O: Solid Oktoberfest. Looks and smells nice. Interesting taste and very drinkable."
"D: A great Oktoberfest. ONe of many this season. A good go-to for an Americanized Marzen."
"Yet another Oktoberfest beer to sample. 'Tis the season, I s'pose... It pours a clear light sunrise sienna topped by a finger of dirty off-tan foam. The nose comprises buttery caramel, grass, light greens, earthy flowers, and dry wheat. The taste brings in more of the same, though the caramel's sweetness is amped up and the graininess steps up enough to duel with it for the duration of the taste. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a grainy feel. Overall, a decent O-Fest, but it doesn't really pop much at all. Not bad at all, but not great."
"I'm having a bit of difficult describing why, but I really kind of dig this beer. There is a nice malty flavor and just really hits the spot right now."
"Overall, this was a fairly average US Oktoberfest. I liked this better than the Schell's version, but still don't think too highly of this either. Probably will not seek out again."
"O- Overall, Summit Oktoberfest is a pretty average O-Fest. It's not bad, but not in the top tier either. Worth a try."
"Pours light orange and smells abundantly malty with a touch of sweetness. Surprisingly, the malt taste is not as strong as the smell would indicate. This is relatively true to style, but the malt profile could be much bolder. I like my Marzen to contain so much malt that it can be substituted for a meal - this did not quite get there for me, but it is certainly a respectable brew."
"like i said i'm a fan of most of summit's beers but i don't know if i'll be buying this one again."
"Drinkability: For me, the bitterness was off-putting. I prefer a little bite with mÃ¤rzen, but not something distracting like this. It really took away from the malts I would enjoy much more. However, it is still very robust for the style, and for that I will commend Summit."
"wow wanted something diffrent and this beer is excellant what a great color , very nice taste , very happy to buy this one , try this for oktoberfest . it smells like fall go enjoy a beer from summit gonna try another beer from summit but for gonna drink this"
"Smells a malty, caramelly, with a nice malt background. A liitle lace with moderate carbonation. I Really like this octoberfest with a citrusy malty taste. It is my go to octoberest...I enjoy it more then our other local octoberfest made by schools. This is a solid beer."
"Notes: This Oktoberfest has more body and depth than others, and a pretty well-balanced flavor. For what it has, however, mouthfeel is a bit thin, and the alcohol is noticeable. It is still drinkable, but not my favorite seasonal that Summit has to offer."
"This is a very good beer and is a good example of the style. It has a nice color and big head with plenty of lacing and rich flavor."
"Overall: A very good take on a Marzen from Summit. Everything you would expect from this very malty style of lager. Rich and sweet but not overwhelming."
"Different than other Marzens I've had. Almost Belgian quality to it. Interesting, pleasant and different."
"Wow! For a marzen, this stuff is exceptional. The flavors are so complex and perfectly blended. Higher in alcohol than most examples of the style but who's complaining? Definitely a great beer to enjoy during the late fall months."
"A well made beer that is easy to drink. Not overly complex but worth a try if you like malty brews."
"Worth a try, nice slightly above average American Oktoberfest."
"I enjoyed this beer a lot. Typical of a marzen style and worth my money. I recommend it."
"D - solid Oktoberfest here. I know I would buy this in the fall if Summit was available around here. Thanks go surlytwins fan for this extra!"
"Tasty beer but overall thin."
"I thought it was a decent representation of an O-fest."
"D: Not digging it too much because of the sweetness. I remembered this being really easy to drink, not so much now. Glad I got only one in a mix six."
"I am not going to an Oktoberfest where people are drinking this. Seriously, what were the folks at Summit thinking? As solid as the taste is, are they trying to make a supposedly session beer double as roofies? The alcohol is way too high and the taste and mouthfeel entirely deceptive. At first I thought that the ABV listed on BeerAdvocate might have been an error but I checked at the brewer's website too. Had it been 3.7% ABV (3.7 = 7.4/2!), I could have drank it for hours! What can I say, for a non Belgian beer at this body, the drinkability is below average."
"If you like october beers then this should be right up your alley so drink up!!! cheers!!!"
"Overall a tasty malt driven beer."
"While there are plenty of other marzens around that are more authentic versions of the style, I love the heavy malt and sweetness in this one. A fall favorite for me and one of Summit's best."
"overall a very solid example of the style. nothing at all to complain about at all here."
"The body is on the light side, carbonation mild. Easy to drink, and enjoyable. A bit to sweet for me to drink too many."
"Drink this is a pretty drinkable beer even with the alcohol present. I wouldn't seek this one out but wouldn't pass it up either."
"Cheers.."
"Summit brews a very good beer as their interpretation of the Oktoberfest/Marzen style though I do feel it strays just a bit. I do recommend this beer!"
"Drinkability: The noticeable amount of alcohol makes this beer not too likable for me. I do enjoy the spicy fruity notes with the strong maltyness expected in an Oktoberfest but the alcohol taste is too strong to ignore."
"D: A nice, albeit, slightly over the top--as far as alcohol strength--for the style, lager; good beer"
"There are a ton of Maezren choices out there, especially in the WI market, I would suggest passing on this one in favor of others."
"Overall, bland and uninspired- just like the 2010 Season Opener. Not terrible but not great."
"D-I really feel like the mouthfeel is all wrong on this one. I want way more carbonation in my Marzens. It's pretty easy drinking besides that, but it's an average Oktoberfest/Marzen at best."
"This beer is the 3rd in my Oktoberfest binge... not impressed. Oktoberfest reminds me a lot of Summit Maibock: Weak head, weak smell, tastes like a tin can and alcohol... The beer is not horrible, but it really does not have any good attributes either... worst Oktoberfestbier this year (so far)..."
"D - Overall, this one was quite tasty with some unique properties. I wouldn't drink more than one or two, since I wasn't completely attracted to the flavours. I'm thinking I should've drank it warmer to see how that might have altered my interpretation. Definitely worthy of trying though."
"With the high ABV comes a decided mouthfeel. It doesn't wimp out, and it almost gives the beer more character -- just being a bit thicker."
"Drinkability: The immediate brightness on the palate was a bit off-putting for me and I think it was ultimately the combination of hop and sweetness that precluded me from ordering a second round."
"I've heard rumors that each year the alcohol can vary. I think the abv I heard was around 8%"
"M- Light and crisp on the tongue, very nice lager."
"M/D - pretty enjoyable brew, sweet caramel taste but with a malt bite, not overly strong though. I good brew from Summit. I another cool evening brew to be had (couple times)"
"D: Standard oktoberfest, maybe a little too malty for my likings, but a decent beer none-the-less. Paired this one with a brat sandwich and it worked just fine."
"M/D - Medium bodied with good carbonation. Very easy drinking."
"Drinkability: I really didn;t enjoy this beer. I don't know if it's because I don't enjoy Marzens or if it was this particular beer, but there was just too much sweetness in there for me."
"Clocks in at 7.4% this year per SummitBrewing.com. I've tried this a couple times recently, but I'm drinking a bottle right now. The draft, by memory drank smoother, but wasn't all that different. This beer is a deeper red than most O-fest and has more kick in the finish. The flavor starts with the usual caramel malt, but there's a touch of alcohol burn with grassy, earthy hops. This is a big beer, and not your typical Oktoberfest, definitely not sessionable."
"D - A very tasty oktoberfest with plenty of flavor and body that hides its high alcohol content remarkably well. I found the Summit fall variety pack for $10.00, that's less than a dollar a bottle!! This beer was very well crafted and does an excellent job of adding enough hop flavor to the caramel malt base to keep the beer interesting. I challenge anyone to find a cheaper and better oktoberfest."
"Nice orange body topped by a long-lasting off-white head. Aroma has a nice malt component that is present almost every time I lift the glass. Many beers seem to fade in aroma quickly - this one has decent staying power. A slight herbal hop note is evident after a few sniffs as well. The taste is decent, but not a malt-dominant as I would have expected from the aroma. Then a slight metallic edge creeps in on the finish. Mouthfeel is solid. Drinkability suffers a bit due to the funky metallic edge to the finish."
"Overall I'm starting to run out of things to say about this style. I've had so many this year they all sort of blend together. This seems to be a decent representation of the style though. Rather drinkable."
"D: Pretty good for the ABV, but I'm not a hufe fan."
"Summit Oktoberfest poured a medium amber. No head what so ever, and only average lacing. Smell was ok. Some sweet malt, and grassy hops. Taste was ok. High alcohol came through, grassy hops, and some sweetness. Lacked balance. Mouthfeel was good. Drinkability was hurt by the high abv in opinion. Overall this was lacking something. Didn't feel like a real Oktoberfest."
"Drinkability: This is a very good smooth drinkable marzen style beer that I would drink again."
"Drinkable, yes and worth a try."
"After rediscovering Octoberfests (this year as I do every year) I am really digging the style. I just went out and bought every brewer's rendition that I could find, including Summit's. Typically I don't agree with Summit's practice of hopping the crap outta everything they make but this one they balanced very nicely and stay much closer to the traditional style. By far my favorite from Summit (I'd also suggest the Maibock for those of you who can't stand the hop waters...)"
"This oktoberfest is pretty big and bold compared to many of it's overseas brethren, but in this case it actually works pretty well. The sweet and toasty malts are balanced nicely by a firm alcohol finish that is helped by a little bit of floral hoppiness. The sessionability that is so appealing with oktoberfests is diminished somewhat, as I could only see myself drinking a couple of these at a time. But it is a fun little beer to drink and a nice change of pace fall offering."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into my nonic pint glass. Appears a clear muted amber color with about a finger of creamy off white foam. Nose and flavors consist of toasted bread, sweet caramel malts, light green and red apple notes, earthy, a touch of alcohol. Decent body for the style and amply carbonated with a bittersweet finish."
"D - Good, but not overwhelming, flavor, with a roundish mouthfeel. A session lager -- which is what an Oktoberfest should be."
"D - This is a very good octoberfest. I'm glad I was able to get my hands on some."
"Coppery brown color. Smells of sweet malt with some spices. Really pleased at the taste. Big sweet malts with a nice light blend of holiday spices to compliment. Not the most complex, but satisfying none the less. Smooth mouthfeel, about medium bodied. Can't believe this is almost 8% ABV because it is not noticed. I could easily session these. Perfect for the fall season. Just a nice easy going, warming and satisfying Oktoberfest beer. I would have this again."
"Overall, a fair to good marzen that just didn't stand out for me. The aroma was close to style but the taste was further afield for most of the drink. Drinkable and went down easy but once done, I'd have a hard time recalling it. Rotation: avail here. One and done for me unless best choice (not bad but better out there)"
"I don't really want to drink more than 1 or 2 of these at a time. This brew is a little too sweet for my personal taste. I think I will stick to the Extra Pale Ale the next time I buy a sixer of Summit."
"Another Summit beer to give a thumbs up."
"Very drinkable beer. Have a couple while watching the leaves turn color."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable considering the high ABV. I'd have it again."
"D: A solid marzen but not all that distinctive compared to other Oktoberfest brews."
"Better than I remember, though I wouldn't give it a higher grade - decent for the style, as the balance is better than many."
"Another typical Summit offering. It's a decent brewery, but they have a long way to go to hang with the big boys. They could definitely learn a thing or two from their cross town little-brother, Surly."
"Taste: Pretty good and balanced. Sweet, but not too sweet. Bready and toasty. Fair bit of bitterness to round out the experience."
"The feel of the beer is slightly less than a medium body that works evenly over the pallet. The hops are evenly balanced with the malt which is nice. Overall, there is a bit of a dullness to the beer, that especially surfaces afterwards. Not a bad thing, just not crisp aftertaste."
"D-Very good. A pleasure to drink this one when it comes around each year."
"Malty, par for the style, and drinkable."
"D -- Drinkability is questionable. It's a good beer, but I wouldn't drink more than one in a sitting."
"This review completed from notes. I dug the notes out because my wife and I were planning our trip to the State Fair and I commented that I usually see the Summit Octoberfest for the first time at the fair each year. At least that is how I remember it. Anyway, it was copper in color, almost exactly like the color of a copper pipe. Wispy and light head of lacing. Mild malt notes on the nose. Fresh smooth attack and creamy mouthfeel. Creamy taste with a mildly bitter finish. Mild dryness in the mouth at the finish. The creaminess of this octoberfest is what sets it apart from other of the style in my opinion."
"This is a marzen, with a moderate amount of alcohol and no heat. The taste is good and drinkability is very good. This a welcome addition to my ice box."
"This beer is dangerously delicious and drinkable! The alcohol is more potent than most Octoberfests but not in a bad way. The higher alcohol content makes its presence known, but does a good job to complement the other marzen-esque flavors of malts and caramel occurring throughout this beer."
"A decent Oktoberfest. Nothing special, but I do enjoy it. Something that is worth a try."
"Seems off-style to me, but I have wondered if this is an attempt at the O-Fests of old, when the abv was supposedly higher."
"D= Boozy for a Summit beer. Delicious though. I'll prolly be drinkin this beer quite a bit this Autumn. Impressive for being average. Even has some nice balance to it."
"Into a pint glass, pours a clear, somewhat bubbly amber copper color, a head of ivory color an inch tall, shrinking to a thin film. Lacing is in long, thick webs. The aroma has nice grassy hops, nice grains and a bit of toasted malt. A little light, but still decent. Pretty tasty though, toasted malts and a bit bready, nice hops in grassy tones, good bitterness, sweet. The mouth is medium, good carbonation, quite smooth, alcohol showing up toward the end to say hello. In all, a great session beer, if it weren't apparently 7.7 percent."
"The color is sort of a light amber brown with a reddish tint. There is not much of a head and lacing is light to minimal. It has a very toasty and malty, slightly sweet smell that translates very accurately in the taste, which is strongly of malt and hops with some caramel and toffee sweetness. There is a very slight bitterness, but not enough to discredit much. I found the taste to linger on the tongue for some time. It has a good body that is thick and has light to average carbonation. One can hardly tell that this is almost 8% alcohol. I'll say I would drink it again with the disclaimer that this is the first Marzen I've tried."
"What this beer lacks in jaw-dropping power or novelty, it more than makes up for with its pleasant flavors, gorgeous appearance and sublime drinkability. Again, nothing spectacular here, but a very good introduction to the MÃ¤rzen style. I would very much fancy another round of this one."
"A bonus inclusion in a recent trade by mhewes, Summit Oktoberfest was poured into a Lager glass, in which it looked typical for the style, with a amber colored clear body, a small head fed by lively carbonation, and not much lacing. The smell was malty and mildly spicy, but marred by a slight vegetable odor. The taste was very authentic with a toasty, malty, crisp taste , that made this easy to drink. There was a little more hop flavor present than typical, and they served like a nice counterpoint to the malt. The body was thick enough to provide a sustained sweetness. Not much aftertaste to speak of. Although this is made in one of the styles I don't go out of my way to sample very often, I enjoyed it pretty well."
"This one pours a clear reddish amber with a small white head that dissipates to nothing quickly and leaves no lacing. The aroma is a mixture of toasted grains and sweet caramel. The taste is much sweeter than the aroma suggests with a massive caramel malt sweetness that dominates throughout. There is a bit of toasted bread character, but less than the aroma. The mouthfeel is fairly full-bodied for the style with very little carbonation - slick and a bit sticky. This is certainly not near the top of my list of oktoberfests, but it is quite drinkable for the ABV, which I never would have pegged at over 7%."
"D: Very nice take on the style. More akin to a true German Okto than many US varieties. A winner in my book."
"d. This is a really good o-fest. One of the better ones I've had in 2008. The 7.7% is not noticable in the taste. recommended."
"Pretty subpar Oktoberfest. I wouldn't call it bad, per say, but it sure doesn't stand out in any way."
"Thin watery soda-pop mouthfeel. Aroma is grainy, soapy. Mass-produced, thin, watery, stale flavor, metallic finish. I don't like this stuff at all. I am pouring it out...there's New Glarus in the fridge."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Poured a small head on a light amber body. Mellow smells of sweetness, maple, touch of hoppiness. Taste was along the same lines, just a bit more pronounced. Hop bite was above average. Carbonation was not too high, not too low, with a crispness that make the brew easy to drink. Not the best example of the style, but not the worst, by far."
"I like the flavor of this beer, but the roast of the malt is a little light for a marzen."
"mouthfeel is nicely bittered smooth and sessionable, loads of flavor, a very reasonable price as well"
"D: Very easy drinking. May have improved a bit for me with more of a bittering hop finish. Good true enough, just not special."
"All-in-all, a fair-to-fine example of the style. If you're looking for an Oktoberfest brew, you can do a lot worse than this."
"Got a 12 pack of these last weekend. The color of this beer is a gorgeous coppery color, with a nice alive bubbliness, and a modest head. The smell is strong, with perhaps a bit too much alcohol evident, but still pleasant. The taste is outstanding, rich and complex, not very hoppy, but full of sweetness and grains, but not thick and syrupy either. After a hot day these really hit the spot, even with their elevated alcohol %. That 7.7 would probably prevent me from having more than a couple of these, well, maybe 3. Perhaps my favorite Summit."
"Well worth drinking & a worthy 'Fest beer. Nice job Summit."
"Got this one on tap at Ike's at the St. Paul Minneapolis Airport. It poured a beautiful clear rosey amber with a thin but complete white satin cover and great lacing. The aroma brings roasted malt and toasty wheat, crisp and clean. The taste is more of the same with a wine feel, a bit of alcohol presence. Medium carbonation, smooth and fair drinkability. There's some grassy hops bite, sort of peppery and clove with a hint of a metallic kiss in the back."
"Beer pours a nice creamy orange-like hue. Head is also creamy and pillowy and stays to visit for a while. The smell is robust, carmelly and bready. Not too complex but perfectly balanced. Mouthfeel is darn near perfect, I could probably sit down and cozy up with this for a good long while. Highly recommended!"
"The body is moderate with a sweet finish. Carbonation is light but ok for style. Overall, this is just a generic lager with some good caramel notes. But for an O-fest it is really missing some the specific flavors that I'm looking for."
"D- Easy to drink and a good example of the style."
"I found this to be very drinkable. I could drink this all day."
"Very good oktoberfest. I'm impressed, since the rest of the Summit lineup has been pretty mediocre."
"Ahhh, first Oktoberfest of the '06 season and this one is a sturdy ox of a brew. Thick malty aroma, sweet and powerful. Good medium copper color with a thin head and minimal lacing, understandable due to the alcohol content. Smooth drink with a full well rounded feel. Flavor is strong and biting. Rich heavy malts dominate this one there is a nice grainy sweetness. I like a strong brew and this one is a great start to welcome in Autumn."
"D-not too bad, I could have a couple."
"12 oz bottle courtesy of GrizzlyAdams and my first Summit beer. I poured this into a pilsner glass and it was a ncie orange color with a very nice subtle bread-like smell. The taste was like most other octoberfest beers I've had and nothing to stand out. However, I found5 myself drinking this beer really easily for the purported 7+ ABV."
"round and light, but not thin. Not quite to style, but pretty tasty."
"This is my least favorite Oktoberfest to date, but if you like an Oktoberfest with more of a nutty malt character then this is a must try"
"Drinkability - not a bad beer, but the metallic aroma and aftertaste does impair this beer quite a bit."
"Drinkability: I'm not a huge O-fest fan, but I do enjoy a few during the fall months. This one is average when compared to the others I've had. Its a reasonable choice however when you are in the mood for a Marzen style beer."
"I recently also had the bottle version of this beer, and it failed to impress me either time. It's hard to find the exact reason why, but I have tried several Octoberfests this season, and this one is at the bottom of the list. It just has a different flavor/mouthfeel. That lager yeast flavor seems to be dominant, and it's missing that caramel malt sweetness that appeals to me in this style. There seems to be a different type of malt used in this Octoberfest than in others...maybe I'm wrong. Obviously, this is just my opinion, maybe other tastes would see it as one of the best out there this year."
"Picked up a 12 pack since hey, it's October. Summit's fest beer is all right, nothing too special but pretty easy to drink."
"It had a semi sweet smell, a bit grainy. Light almond hints. Tasted much the same. A nice bready undertone takes the harshness of almond away. Some slightly roasted grain makes it's way to the back of the palate. A bit thin. Chalk this up as average"
"Overall- This was a pretty good beer, but it lacked any sort of ""wow"" factor. I'd drink it again, but it isn't anything I'm likely to seek out."
"I liked this beer for its alcohol content but not as much as I like say Left Hand Marzen... I plan to sample and review more Marzen style beers as this is one of my favorite styles (hopefully one day I can get to Germany to sample the originals)"
"Smells of roasted malt. Tastes like it smells, with roasted malts dominating, with an aftertaste that tasted to me like it was sort of spice or pumpkin. Honestly, the aftertaste didn't float my boat. This was all right, and there were some things going on, but the taste it left in my mouth was just kind of off. This one wasn't amazing for me."
"On second thought the 7.70% ABV doesn't make this a good session beer as I found out this morning."
"Transparent and as close to true copper as a beer can come. Thin but lasting off white to tan head. Aroma is sweet grains and lightly toasted malts. Flavor is a tad sweet and perhaps under toasted but otherwise spot on. Toast is certainly present as is a sweet, German damp malt flavor. There is a strong nuttiness and even some nice spice in the finish. The yeast adds some sweat generic fruitiness. Slightly buttery with a touch of toffee. On the big side of medium bodied for the style. Well carbonated. The finish is dry and nutty with a carbonation bite that lingers for a while. Very drinkable. I enjoy it more than most."
"Oh. and the 7.7% alcohol don't hurt either :-P"
"Overall 4 out of 5."
"Bright carbonation, but overly thick body. Not real drinkable, but I got some enjoyment out of it."
"Too bad this time. BA reviews show that I'm stuck in an isolated incident."
"Very good old fashioned Oktoberfest session beer. Pours with a fine off-white head and some lace. Clear rich amber color. Nice nose matches the flavor of slightly toasty malt, very little hop. A bit of sweetness. Excellent balance. Finish has me coming back for morrre. Definite session beer."
"I was not the biggest Summit fan up until the last couple of month's or so. Mabye I'm getting older and my palette is changing , or they are tweaking their beer's to keep up with the big gun's of the micro industry, either way, give their brew's another chance because they seem to be achieving better quality and flavour's thruought their entire line."
"overall, i really enjoyed this brew, for such a high abv, there is little to no notes of bozziness"
"Sam Adams Octoberfest has always been my favorite but this is it's equal!"
"This Oktoberfest pours a beautiful light copper color with a nice white head that diminished into a spotty skim after a few sips. The aroma is highly malty, spicy toasted grains and caramel sweetness, there might be a light hop aroma as well. The flavor is very malty, spicy and sweet initially, followed by a solid balance of hop bitterness, and finally the toasted grain spicyness reappears at the swallow. The carbonation is moderate and the beer has a medium body, giving a good drinkability. Overall this is a very good Oktoberfest. The malt aroma and flavor are both very prevalent and well done. I enjoy the toasted spicy flavor from what seems to be a large portion of toasted grains, like Vienna or Munich. The hop bitterness provides a nice balance, definitely keeping this Oktoberfest from being overly sweet. IÂ’d place this in the top 3 Oktoberfests IÂ’ve had."
"On draft at Barcade as part of the ""Midwest Beer Night"" and probably the biggest surprise hit in my opinion. Light reddish copper in color with a big malt aroma. The flavor was very complex with hints of bitter chocolate and smoked malt in with the more traditional toasted maltiness of an oktoberfest. Very strong for the style and it had a little bit of alcohol evident in the finish. Almost a doppelbock oktoberfest. A doppelfest maybe?"
"Overall Impression: Well brewed Octoberfest-Marzen Style Lager. I thought the bitterness was a bit overpowering and would like to see a bit sweeter, or a fuller body but that is just me. Very nice overall."
"Overall impression: Nice Oktoberfest - has all the flavors I would expect from a marzen. The high ABV is well masked - this is a nice seasonal offering."
"Contains enough Oktoberfest character to fit the style, but not enough to compete with classic German examples. Begins with aromas made up of part malty grains, bread, yeast, and earthy hops, but also partly with ester, fruity ale characters and American hops. Brilliantly clear with a pale copper hue. Sparkling carbonation with fair head retention and lacing. Tastes go back and forth from bready / saaz, to fruity / spicy. Body does lack creaminess, and maltiness, but the beer does finish clean except for a mild metalic hop character late. Good beer but not what I will go for when wanting an true Oktoberfest."
"Pours a two finger white head that vanishes leaving no lace. Cloudy amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Sweet malty nose. Starts sweet but balanced, subdued caramel finish, higher ABV totally hidden. 99Â¢ for a 12oz bottle from Chalet Party Goshen, In."
"Pretty disappointed with this one, especially considering that Summit is a solid brewery."
"A disappointment from a brewery whose other offerings I've enjoyed."
"The bottle pours an amber orange with a very small amount of dense head. The foam clings to the glass well leaving belgian-like lace. The aroma has both hints of fruit and malt. Most oktoberfest beers have one or the other, but this is a nice balance. The taste is the same as the smell with the addition of some hops. Good body and carbonation. A good beer over all. I never tried this when I lived in Saint Paul for 3 years, but I'm glad I have now."
"Stole this from HopscotchÂ’s fridge at his post-GABF tasting. It has a low intensity aroma that features a vegetal mash and some sweet malts. The body is lustrous amber and holds a rapidly diminishing wispy white head. Light palate in the fore along with sweet but somehow juicy feeling malt flavors. No bitterness as per the style. Has some hard caramel candy sweetness in the middle ranges. Finish is abrupt with only some faint sweet malt and grains lingering on."
"Overall, I didn't care for the sweet/metallic mix. This was not a very good O-fest."
"I'm not a big fan of Oktoberfest beers, but this one is at the bottom of my list."
"Not the thirst quencher I seek, but would enjoy a few of these on any given day...a great start to October for me."
"Poured a medium copper color with massive slightly off-white puffy head. Strong malt notes presnrt in the nose. Taste is malty sweet, with some nice caramel and toffee to be found. Nice, full and creamy in the mouth. Finishes with a mild bitterness which is really a nice ending for this beer. Excellent drinkability. I was shocked to see the 7.7% alcohol. Never would have guessed."
"GET MY BUZZ ON- y"
"D- I always get a little giddy when Oktoberfest rolls around because this is one of my favorite beers. I got real lucky as I took the brewery tour the week after they kegged and bottled the first run of this so I got to try this years version before it hit market. It gets better every year."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, a simple yet aggressive Oktoberfest that hides its ABV well."
"Easily drinkable."
"Drinks pretty good, not a bad take, but I'd preffer a little more finese versus the alcohol/grainy taste hammer. Still worth seeking out"
"Originally reviewed September 17, 2005. On tap at the Big Lake Brewfest. No aroma. Nice headstrong amber pour. Malty and sugary, but lacking any decent characteristics, that distingush it as an Oktoberfest. Finish is skanky and a touch too dry. Somehow overall the higher alcohol doesn't appear."
"It's not bad. Smells good with some caramel/pumpkin flavoring. Is over carbonated. The alcohol is high for this style and is pretty much undetectable. Body is thin, mouthfeel very thin. Soapy head that disapates quickly leaving no lacing. Taste isn't bad and is an average beer. I would have it again without a doubt, but will not go seeking this one."
"Corn flake malt aroma. Sweet, toasted malt flavors with a pleasant caramel finish. The body leaves a bit to be desired..seemed a bit light to me for an Oktoberfest that clocks in at a hefty (and pretty respectable) 7.7% abv. That being said, the alcohol is hidden quite well. Overall, I'd put this about average for the style."
"Jen: For a Summit brew, this seems to be one of the better ones, but it still isn't a great brew. It has a nice backbone of bready malts with a sweetness that carries throughout the whole brew. This doesn't feel like an Oktoberfest to me, it is almost missing that fall feeling I have gotten from others. It is a decent brew and offers something different than most fall crews, but I still find myself wanting to finish this so I can drink something else."
"This beer felt like eating a big old slice of home-made bread slathered in honey. The flavors and the mouth feel really came together to make this a fantastic beer."
"I found this beer to be rather unimpressive and kinda boring. I hate to say it since I usually like Summit beers but this one is definatly a sleeper for me. Its poured a amber color with amber head and had poor retention. It smelled bready with bold spices and herbs. It tasted of toasted malts and heavy bold spices with to much carbonation and bitterness. It is rather strong though so that is a plus to an otherwise boring beer."
"Purchased a 12 pack for 9.99 + + at Opperman's cork N Ale in Saginaw, Michigan. THe beer seemed to have suffered due to age. The pour was a bright and brilliant clear red and was topped off with a sparse off white head. The nose was sweet and malty, too sweet, and lacked any balance. Flavor continued the one dimensional sweet feature with a cloying feel. The beer just lays there, I have had better. Will look forward to a fresh Sample in September because Summitt makes some wonderful products."
"Mouthfeel- One of the most refreshing beers for a 7.7% abv. I want to say this would be a good session beer, but this stuff would kick your ass much faster than you would want."
"Summit Oktoberfest Marzen and Millstream Oktoberfest are two of the better domestic versions that I've run across. Maybe it has something to do with the high concentration of German immigrants in the Midwest. In any case, this is a beer that I can easily recommend. While it didn't impress the lederhosen off me, it's a definite keeper."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" beige head over the dark orangey amber brew. Head hangs at about half height, with average lacing. Aroma is sweet somewhat wet grain, with a tinge of alcohol. Flavor is upfront brash fruity malts, with closing bitterness, relatively balanced overall. Mouthfeel and drinkability are about average, although the perceived alcohol in the taste seems high for the style."
"Drinkability - tasty and easy to drink, kinda average though."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink a two but I think the sweetness of it would prohibit drinking more than two in one sitting."
"Pours a copper orange hue, with a semi-hazed clarity. The head is dense, but under one finger and retains poorly. Decent lacing though. Crystal malt aroma, with a pinch of floral hops and ester. The flavor is rich with vienna malt sweetness and bavarian hops, but still too thin to hide an obviuos cider flavor. The hops flavor is lacking, and the ester aftertaste ruins the mouthfeel. Slow, even carbonation and medium body are fairly smooth, but the finish winds up too sweet and expels any chance for a resepctable drinkability."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with quite aggressive stingy carbonation that makes it a bit hard to drink. Alcohol is well hidden in the flavor. With all the Oktoberfests that are out there I doubt I'll be coming back to this one, but I'm still glad I had the chance to sample it."
"The mouthfeel is quite full-bodied. Has lots of residuals and a powerful burn appropriate for the fall season. This was an alright Oktoberfest, but I think it overshot the mark whether it was intended or not."
"A quaffer, but nothing worth looking around for."
"i'm not a huge oktoberfest fan, but this is decent. it's interesting to see that this style get generally lower ratings than others. only a tiny portion of the beers in the style (which is a long list) have ratings of 4 or above"
"This is a very impressive beer from Summit. For the price, I don't know what else I would pick over Oktoberfest. If you live in the area, pick up a sixer while they're still available!"
"12 oz bottle pours a clear and radiant copper body with a small, beige head. Retention is minimal and sparse spotty lacing is left on the glass. Aroma is malty, with caramel and a note of molasses. Fruity floral notes lurk in the background. Mouthfeel is light medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Taste is on the malty side, with lots of caramel notes. Spicy, hop bitterness is well executed, and equally assertive. Very nicely balanced. Alcohol is very well concealed, especially if this one is actually 7.7% abv. A very well done American Marzen with very good drinkability."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer, like most Oktoberfests. I could see myself downing quantities of this at a sitting."
"Very nice golden amber color. Small head that is gone rather quickly. Low aroma-somewhat toasted malt but theres a metallic wang going on in there. A tad sweet on the flavor side. Malty with a somewhat sulfury finish. Not all together unpleasant. Body is ok though almost too full for the style. An enjoyable enough beer though a bit heavy on the body and abv for a maerzen for me. Worth trying for your own opinion. Thanks to deejaydan for the Great Pumpkin sample."
"12 ounce bottle. This beer pours out a clear, copper color with a small head. Toasted malt aroma with some spicy hops. The flavor is malty, with some lemon, which is strange. Just a bit of hop flavor in the finish, but the emphasis is towards the malt. Mouthfeel is light to medium. Good drinkability. Alcohol is well hidden. I didn't detect anything close to the 7.7% abv listed on the bottle. A well above average Oktoberfest."
"-UF"
"Drinikability: A little hard to choke down at a quick pace."
"Drinkability: Oh yes, you could drink the shit out of this. It goes down easily, and is never unpleasant. It's just not going to change your life. Unless you drink an assload of it, go home and knock up your girlfriend, get married, get a job at the glue factory and spend your days sawing the hooves off of horse corpses before you throw them into the glue pot so the hooves can be sent off to the Jell-O Brand Gelatin factory so we all can continue to enjoy our fruity gelatinous desserts until the end of time because I know we all just LOVE to watch it jiggle. If that happens, then I guess you could say that it DID change your life. But it seems like a bit of a longshot."
"Drinkability is good. This is a tasty, tasty beer, but at 7.7% abv, it is a bit heavy as a session brew. It is great one or two at a time, though. I'll buy it again next year."
"Amber color but not much head. It was gone pretty quickly. Mild carbonation with a malty aroma and flavor. Not very impressed though compared to other Summit brews I've enjoyed. I'd say it stays pretty true to the style as far as color and flavor go, but could use a tad more bubbles for my tastes. Maybe I'll get a chance to sample a draft in the near future."
"I think this is one of the better Oktoberfests around --- German or American."
"Nice orange hue, minimal head and lacing. Aroma is floral hops with bready notes. Taste is bready, biscuit like. I'd like more sweet malt flavors upfront, but it's not bad. Mouthfeel is a touch thin, but if this is 7.7%, it's masked well. Very quaffable."
"Overall a sturdy and honest Oktoberfest. A beer that tastes and feels good, requiring no deep thought - just drink and enjoy. I'm impressed."
"Radiant bronze. Thrilling to look at. Dark for the ""style."" Soft aromas of nuts, toast, caramel and cream. Big and sweet in the mouth. Baked fruit and caramel flavors. Hempy bitterness. The texture is broad and a bit sticky with volumes of tender mousse. Spiced lemon cuts it and drives rear aromas of steeped tea and herbs. A pure finish; don't scrutinize it. Tangy, toasted kernels of acidity provide an efficient tempo throughout."
"Pours a clear red color with a small white head that recedes quickly. The aroma is clean with some grassy and floral tones. The taste is as clean as the aroma. The sip has lots of floral notes, while the aftertaste is rather sweet. The mouthfeel is medium boded with ample carbonation. Overall, this is another solid brew from Summit."
"A big O-fest thats taken a turn for the better over the last couple of years. Thank goodness. Its a keeper to have around. And watch out, its a sneaker, it warms ya up pretty fast too."
"Poured a vibrant coppery amber, perhaps a bit on the pale side for the style. Aroma was vague, perhaps a little apple. Flavor was a bit sharp and tart, lighter and a little fruity, without the malty subtance of a marzen - more like a Vienna. Not much depth to the flavor and overall simply lightweight. Perhaps it is good I started with this light, boring version - better to acclimate myself to the real thing."
"drinkability: pretty drinkable despite the higher abv"
"Pours a clear orange/amber color. Lots of bubbles coming from the bottom of the glass. Thick off-white head. Good retention and lacing. Bready, toasty malt aroma, hints of herbal/grassy hops. Strong toasty caramel malt flavor, followed by a bit of bitterness. Finishes sweet. Medium body, carbonation is good. Very easy to drink, even at 7.7%. Pretty solid one here. A bit hoppy for an O-Fest."
"That initial taste of metal drops this score a notch, even though it did not linger. Summit Oktoberfest is worth trying, but it isn't something I'd make a special trip to purchase."
"overall- very similar to a bock with the big malt flavor. I would taste a little more spicey/hop presence to balance it out. the 7.7% is very well hidden and overall i think its a pretty good beer. nothing spectacular, but better then average."
"Crystal clear pumpkin orange color, with very minimum head on the pour. Smell is vaguely grassy, definitely sweet and crisp, also has some noticable alcohol in the nose. Taste is very crisp and full, sweet malts, with a grassy, alcohol laced background really make this a full and unique tribute to the style. Nice mouthfeel, to boot. A good start to the Oktoberfest season."
"Beautiful deep amber to copper color. Tawny head with strong lace. Mild aroma with toffee and malt notes. Balanced taste with just the right hoppiness and strong malt flavors. Aftertaste of roasted malt, chocolate, and just a bit of pineapple. Feels great on the tongue with a lively carbonation. I could drink a liter stein of this lager!"
"Pours nice with a fairly creamy head and a nutty, balanced aroma. Smooth mouthfeel and crisp finish made me grab another! Not in the same class as German standards like Spaten or Hacker-Pschorr, but a solid effort from Summit."
"Fine representative of an Oktoberfest/Marzen Style. Very tasty, satisfying and drinkable."
"This is a passable Oktoberfest from Summit. Bright copper-orange color with a miniscule light tan head. Thin lacing as well. Sweet caramel aroma. Light-bodied with a sweet character, containing malt, caramel and some fruit flavors. Kind of thin on all fronts though. The finish is the only place I could detect any hops. All in all this beer doesnÂ’t strive for much in the category but I couldnÂ’t find too much to complain about."
"Im think'n alittle Wow factor here! My first of the Summit line. The beer poured a good-looking clear copper/bronze color with a nice off-white, cream froth head that maintained well. Carbonation was medium while ring lace was left on the glass, very nice. The aroma is caramel sweet with notes of malted biscuit. The taste starts out sweet with caramel, brown sugar and ends with a spicy hop and alcohol favor. The alcohol is a nice touch as it warms you as the coolness of fall sets in. This is a well balanced, complex for an october, while not being to heavy on body brew. Perhaps one of the best Octobers ive had to date. Drinkability I kicked up for its smoothness at 7.7 abv. While easy to drink, careful, that Wow packs a punch! Good stuff!"
"This is a medium copper color, makes a light head, not too much lacing to speak of. Smell of caramel & has the likeness of a fresh baked oatmeal cookie. Flavor is rich and sweet, more of that nutmeg, cinnamon, pumpkin goodness that is fresh out of the oven this time of year. Mouthfeel is very smooth, a bit sticky and syrupy on the finish. I could definitely drink more than one, but sadly... I only have one. Oh well... for 7.7% I can't tell at all, this is a really sneaky beer. Good stuff!"
"Picked up a sixer on my recent trip back to the homeland (the autumnally beautiful MN). Pours a clear golden copper with pumpkin edges and a smallish, off-white head. Smells of mildly sweet, caramelly malt (brown sugar carrots). Slight, spicy hop presence. Taste starts off with the brown sugar carrot malt, followed by tangy whiskey flavors. Notes of alcohol and burning leaves lead into some surprisingly bitter hops. The good dose of hops is needed to balance out the hefty, mostly sweet, malt flavors. Lingering bitterness and sweet, buttery zuchinni bread. This is a great tasting Octoberfest and one that has some balls too (without being cough-syrupy sweet like the Kaiser). Good job Summit!"
"(Side note: I mixed this with Capital's Autumnal Fire, and that was pretty good.)"
"Pretty refreshing beer. Sweet bitter finish. Pretty easy to drink."
"Taste: Initial sweetness, with moderate alcohol burn. Very clean throughout, but this obviously leans toward the heavy side of Oktoberfest. Finish has doppelbock leanings, with lingering residual sweetness, and hops only come through in the very end. High abv causes the drinkability to suffer (for an o'fest), but this is definitely one tasty beer."
"Big thanks to Jeffboo for the bottle!"
"a little too tangy/rich for me to drink in quantity, though I can enjoy one bottle."
"It's December and nice to know that Oktoberfests still hit the spot sometimes. I might have to add Summit to my list of annual O'fest purchases next year."
"The color an unblurred burnished copper as it rest in my glass with a substantial head that is semi-creamy in texture and a very light tan in color, as it dissipates a silky veil is left to conceal the glass. Musky malt sweetness at the front with an underlying crispness, pleasant as noses go with the front quite sweet, almost cloying, top is middling in feel to the palate. The acidity is pesky and the hops pronounced with a bone dry aftertaste last lingers on with a slight bitterness and a fine representative to the style, even if it is a bit sweet but I like it nonetheless."
"Bright and tasty and yummy, yum, yum!"
"A clear, deep amber/copper body is punctuated by the creamy vanilla head that rests above it. It appears with an almost reddish cast while resting on the bar, but it's clearly more of a straightforward amber with golden highlights when held to the light. The nose displays a grainy, very toasty maltiness and some grassy/floral hops. The body is medium; and its fine carbonation leaves it crisp in the mouth. The rich, distinctly toasted Vienna malt is slightly sweet but well-balanced by a solid bitterness and some limited grassy/piney hop flavor; and it finishes dry with a lingering note of malt, then hops, and finally bitterness and a splash of alcohol. An enjoyable beer with a bit of a bite to it!"
"Dull copper, with an off-white head, a clumpy pour; some alcohol and caramel malts on the nose. Up front, crisp and sweet, malt dominated, some toasty flavoring off the bat. A spicy twinge in the body seems to overpower at first, but blends in rather nicely, a wonderful malty-caramel taste sets in nicely. Somewhat dry and woody throughout, the ABV is masked, yet a decent belly warmer; be careful, this O-Fest will slap you in the face if you don't pay respect, a clear winner from Summit."
"Clear dark orange-copper color with a small off- white foamy head that doesn't last very long, not much lacing. Has roasted, malty caramel aromas, sweet and roasty malt flavors, medium body with a full mouthfeel, finishes sweet with noticeable alcohol."
"Zum Wohl to the F-Monk for delivering this appropriately named beer today!!!"
"Drinkability: Worth trying once, but not a big fan of their version. Needs more hop involvement to tame the alcohol."
"Thanks to feloniousmonk for the sample!"
"Thanks ZAP!"
"This one is a light copper color, very clear and crisp looking. A nice sized frothy white head on top. This has the classic oktoberfest taste, nice toasty malt flavor, a slight hop bite, and some spicy alcohol flavors. I am told that this one clocks in at 7.7% abv, so you will have a fun time putting some of these down. A very good oktober."
"I am rather uninspired by this beer, which is surprising because I generally like Summit's offerings."
"Summitâ€™s Oktoberfest has a nice bronze color, with an off-white head.  The aroma is one of malty-spiciness.  It has a decent malt flavor, not as malty as I usually expect an Oktoberfest to be.  It also has a spicy hop flavor, and it finishes with malt sweetness.  Overall there is a decent balance of malt and hop flavor, but there is not quiet the fullness I would expect from an Oktoberfest."
"clear copper color, slight head and lacing.  really not much aroma in the nose...some heavy bready malts, with subdued oily hops.  big body and heavy mouthfeel....sweet and sugary caramel malts dominate.  any hop flavor is oil slicked away by the muscular malt.  lots of alcohol lingers in the background.  this is an o-fest that doesn't mess around.  i relate to the comments about the similarities in some flavors to the maibock...it's my opinion that summit does ales better than lagers.  and i also am in the club that misses the alt style that was dumped in favor of this more ""marketable"" o-fest."
"Clear copper in color...virtually no head...nose is slightly alcoholic and sweet...taste features a hint of the same unique flavor their Maibock has...I like it, but it is a little different..taste definitely leans sweet with more of a caramel taste, but it also closes with a dry finish and definitely has more of a hop feel this year than last year. I think Summitt is one of the top 25 or so breweries in the U.S. and I have come to anticipate their seasonal releases. This is one of their better ones and once again it is a very enjoyable beer.."
"Too bad the Alt had to be canned."
"Crytal clear copper in color. Slight off-white head that has good retention. Fairly large grain, subdued malt and a slight yeastiness in the aroma. Really nice toasted malt taste. Yeast off-flavors (similar to their maibock?) acentuate nicely. Very clean tasting and very drinkable. The slightest hint of alcohol is actually present in this brew. This octoberfest is medium to full bodied and a very enjoyable brew. I only wish they hadn't canned their alt to introduce this beer last September."
"On tap notes (Chang O'Hara's Bistro):  much better, outstanding malt toastiness"
"Wonderful amber color with orange (bronze) hints.  A mild sweet malt aroma that is very pleasant.  Head is low and steady.  Taste begins with sweet malt with some sharpness.  Mellows from middle through finish with steady malt character.  Mild alcohol flavor noticeable.  Some dryness to finish, but relatively short.  Medium mouthfeel."
