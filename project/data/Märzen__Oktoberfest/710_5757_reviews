"Pours lighter gold/tan than expected for the style. Aroma is slightly off, a mix of some malt and a little skunky. I’d think I got a bad batch if other reviews weren’t also quite low. Taste is boring, feel is overcarbonated."
"Overall, this was a decent beer, but it lacked any head, was not super flavorful and was a little bit too watery (and Märzen/Oktoberfest beers are supposed to be full-bodied)."

"Enjoyed from a 12 oz bottle in a pint glass, this Oktoberfest pours a clear amber with a nice dissipating white head that leaves very light lacing.  Nose of caramel and bread.  Flavors follow a standard Oktoberfest with sweet breaded malts, light sweet caramel malts, and a barely detectable hop in the background.  Light mouth feel.  Decent for what it is, but not a lot of the more robust flavors associated with the style.  Decent."

"This was not what I expected and was pleasantly surprised at the smoothness and flavor. Definitely a new seasonal favorite!!"

"terrible that this tastes to me like the shandy. not sure if they put this on the same line or what, but man do i get a concentrated lemonade thing in here, which in any light does not belong in an octoberfest lager. the look is incredible. frothy soapy tall lasting pure snow white head with beautiful retention and lace as it drinks, i mean, it could not look any better for what it is, with the pale copper beer clear underneath. a little light maybe, and definitely light in malt on the flavor, especially compared to is german counterparts. there just isnt much base to this, thin and watery and oddly citrus forward but not from hops, tangy but not quite tannic. nice because its light but bad because it tastes nothing like the style is supposed to. no caramel or anything like that, not german cereals, and no yeast profile at all, doesnt even seem like a lager. the tang of the shandy lasts through the finish, and i would never guess this is an octoberfest beer in a blind tasting. fine for all day drinking though i guess if you dont know what its supposed to taste like. i was unimpressed."

"Overall pretty shite, definitely not worth picking up. Support another brewery if you want a good Marzen this is all talk and no delivery."

"Overall- This is pretty good, not the best Leinnie's has produced but not bad."
"Mouth med to lighter bod, decent carb"

"Leinenkugel's Oktoberfest is a decent marzen-style beer. It has a bit of a watery taste, but it doesn't water down the flavor of the beer all the way."
"Great taste! Exceptional! My favorite Oktoberfest beer!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is an average Oktoberfest. It is lighter than some Oktoberfests. This is a good beer to ease into an Oktoberfest but others are better.  Needs more flavor."

"a little too much on the caramel flavor for me"
""
""
""
""
""
"The mixture of caramel and malt really break out when you first taste this. My problem is all the other flavors that are also trying to break through. Just too much going on here."
"I think this is a damn fine Oktoberfest beer. Yes, as other's have noted it is not a heavy beer like most beers in this style. However, the flavor is great. It has a great head and looks beautiful in a glass. If I lived in colder climes I might have an issue with the lightness/wateryness of this brand, but if your October has temps in the high 80s and 90s, this beer is refreshing. It's the best ""cheap"" Octoberfest I can find anyway. Better than Sam Adams for sure."

"an average octoberfest. It had a funky ester going on. almost as if it were brewed with an English Ale yeast at a high temp. kinda watery. maltiness and color were decent."
""
""
""

"O- Not terrible but not worth having again. Maybe useful for people who are new to the style but I am sure there are better Marzens out there."

"Too watery than what is to be expected from a marzen."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm with wiscokid 920.  Lacks any kind of maltiness for mouth feel.   Looks and smells good just needs a name change.  Not an Oktoberfest beer."
""
""
"Pours a bright orange with an off white head that trails the glass. The smell is full of earthy and nutty scents. The taste was very mellow but had some really nice Marzen style taste to it with a lot of nutty notes in the beginning with a very clean finish. Very nice, albeit simple."
""
""
"A bit light bodied, a little watered down, but on-point as far as the characteristic Oktoberfest flavors. Like a nice common. It's the only Oktoberfest the 7-11 carries :)"

"Orange amber with a natural white head. Minimal lacing.Aroma is toasted, nearly roasted caramel malt with a faint whiff of hops. A touch of caramel sweetness kisses a nice dry, clean finish. Mouthfeel is good. This is a tasty, good, American style Marzen."
"A decent offering of an Oktoberfest.  Has the traditional toasted and caramel malts, slight bready/nuttiness.  A decent enough hop bitterness.  The biggest knock I have is the mouthfeel.  It's just not up to par. Too thin and watery.  The classic aroma and flavor profile is there, but it just doesn't have the type of body necessary for the style...at least in my book."

" Overall a 3 for Leinenkugel's Oktoberfest - Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company. I probably won't get this brew again."
""
"Leinenkugel's Oktoberfest brewed by Jacob LeinenKugel Brewing with an ABV of 5.10% This brew pours out a nice light brown color with a small white head.  The smell is rich with flavor and grains. Nothing special so far.  Now for the taste it is smooth with some burnt grains. Oktoberfest has a nice balance to it. There is nothing overpowering in this brew. Leinenkugel's did a nice job with this one. The mouthfeel is nice and clean. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out 5. I would buy this brew again."

"Overall (3.17) : it's a toss up if I'd ever buy a six pack of this beer. I don't think it's bad, but it's not very good. There are better Marzens out there, friends, but this is still worth a try."

"Poured a nice clear amber body with a one finger white head. Very nice and true to style. Scents of rich, sweet malt, a light toasted aroma and a very faint citrus. Overall impression is of a nice, clean Oktoberfest aroma, though the citrus is an odd touch, but not unpleasant. Flavor begins with a nice rich malty sweetness, moving into a nice toasted malt character with an extremely faint touch of lemonade. Middle continues these flavors but gets a little drier, with a very faint hint of alcohol present. Finish is medium-dry with a nice presence of toasted malt. Overall impression is of a clean, malty flavor that is balanced between rich malt and toasted malt. The lemonade flavors faintly in the background are not traditional, but not unpleasant. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy with moderate carbonation. Quite nice and very true to style. Overall this a decent example of an Oktoberfest. It stays mostly to style in most respects and what it does differently is not unpleasant and works with the flavor profile and aroma. Nothing spectacular, but good all around."

"I figured the Oktoberfest beer I could make my first would be from my favorite mainstream-brewer, Leinenkugel, and I wasn't disappointed. Not really knowing how an Oktoberfest beer is supposed to taste, I went in with no expectations, and came out with a great beer, full of pleasant caramel malt character and mildly bitter and refreshing crispness. Keep 'em coming, Leinie, and I'll keep drinking."

"Not bad at all. It has a nice warming taste and feel to it. There's a caramel, malty trait to both the smell and the taste. I wouldn't get this again, however, it was certainly enjoyable. There are better out there."

"Pours a pretty copper in color with a 1-finger foamy off white head but doesn't last too long. Some spotty lacing is seen with each sip. Tiny streaming bubbles rising up from the bottom of the glass but not over carbonated. The aroma is of some malts with a slight hint of caramel. The taste is about the same with a slightly dry finish. Doesn't have a bitter or harsh aftertaste though. Not as bad as some others make it out to be really.."
"Overall: This is a mid-tier American Oktoberfest that is widely available in the midwest. I would likely choose Sam Adam's Oktoberfest over this if I was buying large quantities of this beer style, as the nose and malt flavors are a little better than the Leinie's offering. Pales in comparison to the German examples."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark copper color with a moderate head and bits of lacing. Aroma of malt, bit of caramel sweetness, fruit and citrus. Taste of malt, some caramel sweetness. Mild bitterness and a clean finish. Fairly light body, smooth but a bit short on flavor. Decent beer, but hoped for a bit more character."

"I picked this up in a mix and match section at Fresh market. After one drink it tasted like I was drinking a lite version of an Octoberfest beer, tasted watered down very disappointed as Leinenkugels usually puts out good beer. Even Yuengling tasted better than this"

""
""
"Pours a clear copper with a foamy tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt and caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with toast and caramel flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is drinkable but pretty boring and forgettable for the style."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer tastes like a ""lite"" version of a German Oktoberfest—it has the proper aromas and flavors but seems to be watered down."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - An average Marzen, overall. I wouldn't necessarily seek this beer out again but it is drinkable and appropriate for a nice fall day."

""
"O: The best part? I drank it without incident. Sadly, that just means this one is no good. Even if it was offered to me freely, I'd think long and hard about drinking this again."
""
""
""
"Overall – A decent Oktoberfest that is a bit on the sweeter side. It’s alright, but noting super exceptional."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad beer, I wouldn't send it back if I ordered it, but I'd ask what other ambers they had before I ordered it again. Lacks the character I look for in an Oktoberfest. I think a larger malt bill could help."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pleasant and easy drinking, if not very remarkable."
""

"Overall a decent Märzen. Not the best of its kind but I wouldn't refuse one."

"This beer is WAY good for the money, but you can tell that it's the cheapest Oktoberfest you can get your hands on in the US. It's got nice lacing, but the head doesn't last long. The colour's even almost copper, but on the lighter side. You can taste a mild sourness common in cheap lagers. It kind of tastes like if you took a good marzen and poured some cheap Walgreen's lager into it. STILL, it preserves a lot of the things I like about marzens, which are some of my favourite beers. Fall is my favourite season for beer. It's got a rich, toasty flavour and a really nice blend of malt flavours, cheap-tasting malt, but still, very well blended. It really tastes like a marzen. The hops, too, taste genuinely like the hops a marzen should have. They're barely, there, just as they should be, but what flavour profile they provide is more than just a bittering agent. They add a bit of flavour, themselves. This is a great buy for the money."

"I was very pleased with this beer. It left the impression of eating fresh baked bread on a cold autumn evening. To me, considering the style, I think it is a very good tasting beer. It's not overpowering, or watery. It's just a good sessionable beer that I will definitely be buying again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Atmosphere is okay. Decent head, no real lacing though. Nose is roasted grains with a bit of a woody character. Peaty and woody with a little bitterness. Overall, this is an okay quaff."
""
""
""
"Overall: I am a big fan of Leinenkugel's beers, but not this one. I don't thick they hit the mark when it came to a marzen beer. A bit disappointing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A reliable seasonal beverage that I would go back to. Not the best in the category, but it does not pretend to be something that it's not. Easy to drink. Would enjoy best with friends on a Saturday afternoon in September."
""

"12 ounce bottle, best by date of DEC0213. Served in a mug, the beer pours a clear orange/amber color with an inch off-white head. Head retention is decent, and there isn't much lacing. The brew smells like toasted malt, caramel, and a little bit of hops. Taste is the same as the aroma, it's all toasted malt, caramel and some hoppiness. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit coating and very easy to drink. Moderate carbonation. Not a bad Oktoberfest brew, but not one of my favorites either. Still, I think it's worth trying. Got this as a single at my local Kroger."

"I remember trying a few Octoberfest brews last Fall, and I recall that my impression of Leinie's was quite favorable. One very popular brand, in particular, I found to be quite hard to drink....My favorable impression of Leinie's version is strengthened with this purchase, which is the first Octyfest that I've seen for sale in my town."

"Pours out to a half-inch off-white head that falls to a thin but permanent foam layer. Not much lacing. Color is amber-gold. Aroma is toasty Munich malt with a bit of grassy-spicy hops. Flavor is malt-forward and toasty as expected but not as round and sweet as a typical O-fest, possibly due to it being about 1.5% lower than the typical abv for the style. Mouthfeel is a bit rough, slightly astringent. Overall a solid brew but without the kick I was expecting."

"My favorite fall beer but it's out way too early. Beer cola. Truthfully it's the only October beer I've ever had. I drank Coors light exclusively for twelve years then grew up by trying new beers every once and awhile. I'm sipping one now and sad that it will be in the 80's tomorrow!"
""
""
""
""
" Overall a nice brew, even on a hot day I would enjoy this oktoberfest. This is my first of this style this year, I would have liked to put it off a bit, but couldnt resist."
""
""
"Beer is a decent enough Oktoberfest, I would certainly drink enough in the fall to fulfill my fair share. The beer is best enjoyed out of a bottle, particularly good out of a Munich glass. A flavorful beer to be enjoyed with friends on a Saturday afternoon."

"I employed a Crack & Inverted Glug to get things started and it produced a finger of dense, tawny head as a result. Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity and loads of CO2 bubbles in evidence. Nose had a honey-like lager sweetness along with a breadiness, initially, and warming, I began to perceive the caramel. Mouthfeel was medium, but there was a pronounced effervescence due to all of the carbonation noted earlier. Taste was sweet, but not cloying, and I really liked the way that the malts interacted so that it had a sweetish, bready flavor initially and then took on a sweeter caramel taste on the finish. I also noted a slight grassiness, perhaps Hallertau hops? Fall seasonal? Hell, it's a ""German-style Marzen"" and it's damn close to March as it stands. I would like to see this released more often and if not, stash some away for late winter. It is just that good."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good Oktoberfest brew. Reminds me of holiday in Munich. Very festive tasting beer, with hints of nutmeg and cinnamon with a slightly citrus bite. I would recommend it to those who cannot handle real German beer that has a high ABV. Perfect for beginners in the world of Oktoberfest brews"

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a translucent red with a small white head. Smells of some grain, but not much at all. Beer has some caramely and slight chocolate notes in the dark roasted malt, but tastes watered down. Beer is carbonated fine and goes down really well, definitely sessionable. Overall, an average beer."
""
""
"Pours out a nice dark golden brown color that’s crystal clear and filled with mild carbonation. Its topped off with a nice thick off white head that sticks around for a while. Its got some really good lacing, the aroma is a bit on the light side with hints of pumpkin, wheat and mild hops. Some grass and herbal smells come through from time to time. Crisp on the tongue at first, it mellows out as it spreads throughout your mouth, it has some nice wheat flavors, mild grass notes when you swallow but that’s all I get fro it. It is light bodied but good overall."
""
""
""
""
""
"Oktoberfest pours a pretty clear golden color, with a very lite head. There is a slight malty aroma. There is a crisp light malty taste. Not to watery a bit lighter, a little carbonated. Overall its a pretty solid Marzen, a bit lighter but still rather enjoyable."

""

"Overall this comes off as just a simple Marzen, but it's easy drinking and I could drink this again without discomfort no problem."

""
""
""
"-Overall 2.5: An average beer. I would not go out and try to track this down, but this is certainly not the worst beer you will ever drink. It is ""maerzen-esque," but if there are other Oktoberfest options available, I would exercise them first, especially if you want to avoid the weird dryness in your mouth. Bleargh."
""
""
""
"Consensus is that drinking this beer is only marginally better than not drinking at all."
""
""
""
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Pours a light to medium amber with a 1 finger of off white head that fades quickly. Nose is of bready malts and some mild spices, nothing significant. Taste follows the nose with some of the bread and light spice profile. Minimal hops and nothing that stands out. Fairly unremarkable in terms of taste, just average with no strong malts, spices or hops. Feel is thin and watery with a lower end of carbonation. Overall- This was just okay. A bit disappointing considering I'm a fan of the Sunset Wheat. Would drink another if offered, but not going out to buy any soon. Needs something to make it stand out. Very basic-"

"The smell of the beer is grainy and otherwise indistinguishable from and american adjunct. The taste is a bit better. Its very grainy, a lot of grassy, wheat, herbal grains. The beer is in my opinion better then an adjunct lager but its really not much different. Same lager yeast taste, same plain grainy taste, same sugary caramel feel and taste. But it is still and upgrade and gives me just one more reason to question the sanity of the people still buying the big branded beers."

"Not too much to hit on here. Almost touching on amber lager here. I'm not upset. Just disappointed."
"O - This seems like Oktoberfest Light. Decent not great. I'd drink one again if put in front of me, but wouldn't go out of my way to buy a sixer."
""
"This Octoberfest presents itself as it should, a dark orange coloring with a light carbonated head. The taste is sweet with a faint malt flavor that compliments the scent I caught. Overall a slightly above average entry in the Fall/Octoberfest genre."
"Taste a slight crisp bitterness followed by a caramel sweetness backed by rich roasted malt - subtle in the background. Finishes with lingering sweet caramel notes which makes it a little cloying. This has some good flavor, but falls short of some of the other options."
"Overall, a malt-forward brew with some slight flaws that add more flavor than the malt characteristics. Drinkable, but not a favorite."
"Again with leinenkugel, pretty simple. Some spice on the nose, and unfortunately it doesnt go beyond that. Taste is malty and plain, even a little watery. There is some slight fall like flavor on the finish and dry. Wish I could say it gets better, but it don't."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - From the appearance to the finish, Leinenkugel's sexy-looking beer nails the great drinkability for the style with a well balanced and nicely malty brew that screams to be consumed in large quantities. While others might be a richer fall treat, this beer takes up quite a bit of room in my fridge each fall because it's often the Oktoberfest I want to reach for."
""
""
"O - An inoffensive, introductory marzen. Flavors are appropriate to style, but very light."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not the most exciting Oktoberfest. This 6-pack will probably remain in my fridge for a while. Appearance and Mouthfeel are very good but doesn't quite make up for lack of taste. Got more flavorful after it warmed which is strange for a lager."
""

""
"O-One of my favorite beers from Leines. An easy to drink simple yet solid Marzen. Lacks depth and richness but good drinkability. I like it, great for a Fall fishing trip!"

"Poured one and a half bottles into a 1/2 liter stein,a brilliant bronze with a fluffy two finger white head atop.Aromas are clean and grainy with a tinge of iron.Flavors are too clean for the style with a little caramel sweetness but pretty basic.Eh it's clean and pretty light in the feel but it's not bad when out grilling in the great weather we're having here in NC."
""
"Poured into a pint glass from a 12 oz bottle. I am usually careful with my pour so as to not create a big head but in spite of that, I got about half inch of head that didn't last even a minute. The color and clarity of the beer are its highlights for me. It's a lovely golden brown ale with zero haze. Not much smell to it but a nice, thirst quenching quality in the taste with a solid nutty profile. There's no noticeable aftertaste that sets it apart. Tastes better if you let it warm up to about 50 degrees and get some fizz out of it."

"O- Not easy drinking, taste is mediocre. I'd avoid this one unless you just can't stay away from Leinies."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- The taste isn't terrible, but nothing special here especially for the style. Could be a session beer at a bar with a sad beer selection, or in my case, the best option at the casino."
"Overall- I definitely have had better oktoberfests. This one was kind of a letdown."
""
""
"Overall, if it looks like a macro, and tastes like a macro ..."
""
""
"O - Not the greatest Oktoberfest I've tried, but I've never met a Leinie I didn't like. This, one of their best, is still very enjoyable and can easily be sessioned."

"This beer has a amber colored body with a very thin lace around the top. The smell is malty with a little bit of sweetness to it. The taste is carmel and malty with some hop bitterness on the back of the tongue. The mouth feel is good and nicely carbonated. Overall this is a average marzen."

"Poured from a 12oz bottle into an SA glass. Was a nice shade of copper. Very thin head that receded into a very thin cap with like-wise lacing. Not much nose at all. I strained to get a little bit of grain out of it, but absolutely nothing else. The taste leaned toward metallic, with some caramel, but like the nose, not much else was there. The tinny taste made for a less than appetizing mouthfeel. I like most octoberfests, but I can't include this one in that group."

"O: This is a mediocre Marzen/Oktoberfestbier at best. Not all of the Leinenkugel's beers are bad, but this one is seriously lacking. Maybe they should just reintroduce Autumn Gold."
""
""
""

""
""
"This Oktoberfest came in a Autumn Sampler. I have toured the Leinenkugel's Brew and all of their beers come from the same wheat and yeast. Being from up north Leinenkugel's was my first taste of a brew that was not a Macro. This beer is not at all impressive. Clear see through copperish color, little head that dissipates quickly and light lacing. Fruit grain and yeast smell. Sweet banana, bitter malt and a metallic after taste. I think I will give the other 2 away."
"Overall - This is a pretty good Oktoberfest beer but it makes me burp a lot.. It's pretty light and is missing something compared to the others."
"O - An average or slightly below average American Octoberfest. So far this year I liked the Harpoon and Saranac offerings better. Still, its drinkable and reasonably tasty and served its purpose (outside on a chilly fall afternoon)."
"Overall it's average, and not interesting enough to drink again."
"O: average ""Oktoberfest"" to me, yet I still tend to get this one every Autumn, perhaps not as into Leinenkugel's as I used to be"
"D- never been a leine fan, never gonna be. Their beers just don't do it for me and this one is going down the drain."
"O: This was slightly below average. Not the worst beer I've ever had, but certainly not something I'll be trying again. The smell and taste were not good."
"O - Not a huge fan, strange aftertaste with very mild flavor. Heartening the overall profile would do wonders for this beer. Certainly low on my list of sampled Märzens."
"It has all the parts of a good Marzen, but it needs some more smoothness, and alot more caramel malt. Not terrible, but far from good."
"The beer pours a reddish-amber color with a small white head. The aroma is sweet toffee and sugar with no real hops present. The aroma is much sweeter than I expected it to be. The flavor is heavy on the toffee with some biscuit malt also mixed in. There is a slight metallic flavor to the beer, as well as some grape and other fruit notes. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"salud!"
"Overall an easy drinking, simple beer pushing the boundaries on the hops for the style."
"I opened up the bottle and poured into a small glass. The head, which was of an off white color, was about a finger thick and faded quick. The color is a nice dark amber, while the aroma has the citrus notes and a hint of the malts in the beer. The taste was a good mix of malt and hops, with the hops taking the first moments of the taste and fading back to the malt. The mouth feel was surprisingly thin considering the aroma and taste. Overall I feel it's a solid seasonal brew, not outstanding, but a good fall beer."
"overall: good beer, maybe a hint too sweet but overall very drinkable. Not very complex in flavor but it is pleasant to drink. I'd buy it again."
"O- Certainly a different take. My verdict is still up on whether or not it's a worthwhile take..."
"From bottle to my pils glass resulting in a less than finger head of white foam. Color is a 8 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell of wet hay and clover. Taste is full with flavors of barley, cooked corn, lime, and clover. Mouthfeel is light coat of cream, with good tingle. I would not think of buying this again, not because of the flavor, but it is just not my favorite style."
"This beer really is hard to describe. I bought a six pack to give it a try. However, it just doesn't impress at all. Taste is odd and slightly bitter on the end. There isn't any depth or real character that makes me want to have another. I finished the 6 pack but it was forced so not to waste beer."
"Poured a clear amber color with a decent light head. Scent was mostly that of malts and wheats, but much more dry and crisp smelling than those used in summer beers. Has a crisp and clean taste to it. Malts, wheats, and spices were decently mixed together. However it was fairly watery, especially when I've drank probably 15 other Oktoberfest beers. It was a good drink and went down fast but yeah it was too watery and the taste was about average. I know this stuff sells great in Wisconsin but even I'll admit that there are far better tasting Oktoberfest beers our there."
"Overall: An ok marzen, that is probably one of my least favorites from Leinies. The sweetness is not overpowering like some Leinie’s beers. This is true to style, but nothing really jumps out to differentiate this one. I will most likely pass on this in the future."
"A drinkable O'fest, not a great one. I'd have it again though. Not bad."
"O- Not a very good marzen. Not a very good beer. Will not revisit."
"O - Not impressed. This beer doesn't capture the full malt quality that a Marzen should."
"Overall not a bad beer probably wouldnt buy it again as there are other similar beers that are better and cheaper, I however would not turn it down if offered."
"I poured this average beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a nice copper color and poured a nice white head. However that head did not last very long. The lacing did but thats the short end of the head story. The beer had a bready smell. The taste was slightly sweet but not much taste going on here. Actually the brew was kinda watery. I will not buy again."
"M: Lighter-bodied for this style. Good mouth coating with an ok finish."
"This beer pours a clear, bold gold with a thin head that quickly disappears. It's aroma is of nuts, bread, and toasted malt. The flavor is nutty with notes of toast and spice with a mild hoppy tang in the finish. The mouthfeel is light-medium. Leinenkugels Octoberfest is a good beer, balanced and a great match for schnitzel and sauerkraut. Recommended."
"Overall a poor attempt of the great Marzen style. Drink it if you want a more flavorful adjunct lager with a high level of carbonation."
"Opinion: This is an OK beer. It shows that the brewer knows how to make a Lager, and it is well balanced and clean. All this said, it is like a more ""mass produced"" beer quality to appeal to the masses. I just had a Hacker Pschorr, and that beer absolutely showcases the malt so much that it is like drinking a milkshake. This beer is a bit like a Budweiser ""premium product"" that is clean and made to appeal to the masses. I would definitely choose other Oktoberfest beers before I would take this one, but if it was on tap at a pizza joint or something, I would probably have a glass as it would probably go pretty well with pizza."
"Not something I would drink everyday. I'll probably stick to Sam's Octoberfest in the future... but hey, it was worth a shot and it wasn't too bad. Just another notch in the belt for Autumn beers tried, and it's one worth trying. Pretty average, I'd recommend trying it at least once."
"Just ok."
"Overall impression: A pleasant, easy drinking, slightly malty Oktoberfest. Not sure why there isn't more love for this beer. Worth a try."
"Overall: This is a good beer. I was not disappointed. There is a reason that this is seasonal because this is not the kind of beer I would grab on a hot summer day. It is not for everybody but it should satisfy fans of Marzen brews."
"O: A servicable Fest in a pinch, but there's so much better out there."
"O- I'm not a big fan of fall seasonals but I love Leinie. This one just isn't up to par for me."
"A bit too much off-flavours to enjoy with a critical eye - of course, for baseball and fireworks watchin', it was all right."
"Pours burnt orange with a finger of white head. The smell has a touch of alcohol, but is overall not very pleasant. This does not taste like a Marzen as it is very light on malt and there is actually a noticeable hoppiness to the finish. It's not too bad, but it's not true to style."
"Overall- Not Leinenkugel's best here. They can do much better than this. I love good marzens but I would prefer Schell's Oktoberfest or Paulaner Oktoberfest or Schmaltz's Freaktoberfest."
"Samuel Adams and Bell's makes FAR superior Oktoberfests, go give those a try, they're simply amazing especially the Sam Adams version."
"Overall- I really was no impressed but did think it was a great beer to have on a hot day. Cheers"
"Conclusion: I hope for better, but seems to me to be a mass-produced alternative to macro-lagers that is released in fall. This brewery sometimes produces better beer, but I feel that this isn't an example of that..."
"O=Great if you want to drink the style but not deviate too far away from an adjunct lager. Won't be added to my rotation, regardless of how the other märzens do."
"O) This is average at best, maybe below average. There are so many really good Oktoberfests to drink this time of year, don't waste your time with this one."
"Overall: A decent lager overall but mediocre as a Marzen. Could of been more forward with the caramel and spice."
"mouthfeel a bit of smoothness and some crisp flavor"
"Looks nice smells hoppy ,taste wrong for me too hoppy for a this style of beer ,short on malts ,stays on the back of my tongue kinda metalish orange peel ?"
"6 pack bottles from Fred Meyer, N.Salem store. $7.49 Pretty caramel coloured ber with a small white head. Aroma isnt that bad..caramel,slightly toasty, some nuts Taste is similar to the aroma, semi-sweet with a bitter end..OK Ok on the tongue not too shabby. Not a bad beer actually..quite enjoyable"
"Mouthfeel was not too heavy as the aroma makes this out to be but overall this beer was all over the place compared to another Oktoberfest beers in the market."
"Taste: The hops stand out, but not as potent as in an IPA, rather it is more complementary with the other flavors in the beer"
"Overall I thought this was a slightly above average Marzen. There was nothing really off or offensive about this beer but it also seemed to lack that certain something that brings all the flavors together, there was a much larger emphasis on the biscuit malts then I would have liked. I liked the mouthfeel the most, it was exactly where it should be for a good Marzen, I also really like the drinkability, if I was in the mood I could take out a six pack of this with no problems. What I liked the least was the taste, I thought it could have been balanced a little better, the larger presence of biscuit malts seemed a little overpowering at times. I usually buy a couple twelve packs of this each fall but since Samuel Adams Octoberfest is just about the same price I think I will be grabbing the Sam Adams instead. If you are wanting a Marzen this will do the job, but with all the other Marzen's that flood the shelf's this time of year, there are better choices to be had for a similar price. This beer was ok but when it comes to Marzens I am sticking with Bell's and Samuel Adams."
"Overall: Drank this beer with dinner tonight. I was in the mood for a marzen and it was fairly decent. Better than my expetations! $2 draft can't go wrong!"
"The finish was about the same, light and thin, nothing basically wrong or faulty, just not enough of anything"
"Drinkability is okay on this beer. Not very strong, so one could drink them fairly well. However, one wouldn't want to. Not worth going out of your way for."
"M/O. Has a creamy smooth easy drinking medium body feel and overall this is an okay beer."
"Taste, really to style I guess, I hate to be that guy, but it is real mellow. I don't take any hop presence out of it, very chill, smooth. Fair amount of sweetness. Everything is in a minimalistic way about this beer, except for the sweetness. Not a bad beer, but at almost $8 a 6pack, there are so many better options."
"Bought a case of this with high hopes that this would be a pretty good brew since I'm a fan of the Sunset Wheat. I poured a bottle into a pint glass and liked the color of the beer. It was a nice clean looking brownish red with a white head on top. The smell was a little distant, I was picking up the malts and some spice but nothing too much really jumped out at me. The taste was the same, this beer was pretty much a basic brown ale with just a minimal amount of autumn spices. The mouthfeel was light and not very warming. It's a decent beer if that. I can't say I'd buy it again."
"Poured clear golden light brown in color with a small white head and nice lacing. The aroma was that of bready and sweet malts with light odor of hops. It tasted mild of grainy malts with a light hop flavor. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy but a little light bodied.. Overall an average brew, but not a great representation of its class."
"D- I can have a couple of these here and there. I wouldnt buy a six pack of them though."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a dimpled glass. I am going against the grain on this one again and give this a good rating as this is my top 10 domestic oktoberfest biers. Pours light brown with small but frothy head. Aroma is a bit on the grainy side with malt and hop character minimal. Flavor is sweet at first sip, but subsides into astringency. Malt character is evident but not prevalent. Palate is thin to medium and finishes clean."
"D: this is not the best Leinenkugel's, nor is is this the best Oktoberfest. It's ok, in a pinch."
"D: All in all a good, drinkable beer. Top choice? No. Oktoberfest flavor? Maybe. Good beer? Yes."
"Poured into a pilsner glass. Color is a moderate copper with a two-finger off-white head with a bit of lacing as the head goes down, which is quite quickly. The nose is fairly nice with some caramel, bread, toffee, light hops, and a slight nuttiness. The taste is a bit more plain and falls back on the slightly-sweet malt a bit too much. Fairly nice body with pretty good carbonation and a nice finish. Drinks well enough and is a pretty decent brew from them."
"Mess of a beer. Way too sweet. No redeeming qualities."
"D: Fairly easy rate of consumption, mostly because it had little substance or flavor to hold it back. Not bad, more of a tweener that falls short in quality and substance when compared to its finer German, and even more noted American counterparts."
"Not the best marzen/oktoberfest, but I still liked it enough to finish off a 6 pack in an afternoon. It's got a pretty light body, and almost sweet tasting hops in it. The head was just frothy enough and stuck around my glass. Like I said, not my favortie oktoberfest, but still enjoyable."
"overall a decent seasonal but there are much better out there for sure."
"D - Good fall beer."
"D: OK. So this isn't the greatest example of a Märzen out there, but what it lacks in nose and taste it more than makes up for in crisp refreshing drinkability. I wait for it every year, and it becomes my go-to in the fridge for the two months or so that it is sold."
"D: This is an easy going beer, but I do not think that I find it to have classic flavors."
"Poured into a pint glass with nice tight white head. Medium carbonation with a nice copper hue. The aroma is of slight metallic malt, and some hints of fresh pumpkin rind. The taste is a solid malt backbone with light hop balance. The body is only slightly thin which seems to make this brew not stand up as well to hardy meals. A nice try, but I'll look for true German Marzens when in the mood."
"D: You could drink many of these, but why?"
"The carbonization on the tounge and roof of the mouth is heavy but not so strong that I am turned off. I taste a little maple in there with some light spice. The beer is not extra strong but delivers enough to make you enjoy."
"Poured a clear amber color with a small just off white head. nice clarity to it with some brownish red hues. Aroma was muted a touch, but caramel, peanut shells and even some lager yeast came through. the flavor was nice and light, easy to drink with a nice malty backbone. light hops and just bitter finish. mouthfeel was spot on with carbonation, though it didnt have the umph to let me know this was an oktoberfest and not just an amber. overall its good, and probably my favorite leinenkugel beer they make, though its simple."
"(D) Drinkable brew, not the best from this brewery but an easy drinking beer. Decent sesson beer."
"Pours a rich orange color with a foamy white head. Small amount of lacing is left on the glass as you drink. Malty, toasty, and very slightly sour smell. Taste is also malty; just the right amount of carbonation; very crisp beer. Nothing incredible, but very solid marzen & very easy to drink."
"However, I was otherwise a bit let down as far as Marzens go. The nose is of a dark malty and sweet character. Tastes occupy a much more one-dimensional malty tier of flavors than I am used to. Certainly a bit of sweet caramel here. Don't expect a terribly crisp drinking experience, nor a very notable range of spices. This brew is definitely a sweeter and more bready take on the Marzen style. Drinkable? Yes. But not one to be sought out over certain alternatives."
"D: I really liked this beer... ABV was good, flavor were good... not much not to like here for me. Another good beer form Lein's"
"I am surprised by the low reviews on this one. Yes, it is not the most complex lager, but it is perfect as a quaffer. With the low ABV, one could enjoy a few steins of this during a celebration."
"Still a decent brew, but nothing extraordinary. I would definitly drink again though."
"Final Thoughts: For an impluse buy, id say that this beer is pretty solid. Although this last beer was in my fridge for about 3 weeks after I bought the 6 pack. But all in all i'd give it a solid 1 thumb up."
"not bad..not great...wouldnt turn one down."
"The mouth is crisp. Moderate body. Decent. The flavors start out pretty weird. I get a weird veggie flavor right away, but this gives way, as I sip, to a more balanced toffee, malty beer. Nothing really stands out. Light mineral on the back end. This is a simple beer, but nothing all that great. I wouldn't turn it down."
"As compared with my standard go-to octoberfest (Sam Adams) this leaves a little to be desired which is sad because i'm a big fan of Leini's brewer. It's not as smooth as Sam Adams and has an ever so slightly hoppier profile. I expected better from Leinie, but i wouldn't turn one of these down if i was offered. I'll finish the six pack for sure, I just expected more."
"Drinkability: This is pretty drinkable, but not a top marzen by any streatch."
"Out of all of the octoberfest beers I have tried this season this has to be one of my least favorite beers. Has a very weak taste with hints of caramel and very little malt and decent smell. Has very little mouthfeel and a very decent drinkability. I like the Leinenkugel family and would buy this beer again, just not on the top of the o-fest list."
"At one point I thought this was a decent beer so I was shocked to come back to it and find out how it compared to other beers I've tried."
"D: had several pints of this one last night. I would say it is quite drinkable... nice to finally taste something decent from Leinenkugel's. They do not have a good reputation in my book."
"Had this before from a bottle, but got hooked up with a can by woodychandler. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a caramel color with a 1 inch head. Smell is mostly of malts. Taste is good, malts , some caramel, slightly sweet, very high drinkability. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a tasty and enjoyable beer."
"Overall I wouldn't get this if you are looking for an Oktoberfest."
"D- Probably one of the most middle of the road beers I've ever had. Disappointing for an Octoberfest sure, but not bad. Nothing to complain about, but nothing stands out. Decent-just there are better Octoberfests out there."
"D: Pretty average. I could have another one or two."
"Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company, Inc.--Leinenkugel's Oktoberfest German-Style Marzen--Limited Release--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 5.10% ABV. 20 IBU's. (2.5 / 5.0) Rich long lasting lacy white head. Clear thin bright amber red color. Enticing appearance oversells taste. Toasted malt hint mild hop light front.Thin textured mild sweet slightly fizzy tang light toasted caramel fruit hint weak but smooth Marzen body. Clean mild hop thin bland smooth end. Refreshing cold but turns bland with a little warming. Sampled 9/10/2010. 6-Pack $7.49 @ Fred Meyer--Ballard, Seattle, WA 9/10/2010."
"D- This is a drinkable beer. Not my favorite Oktoberfest style by any means but well...it will do in a pinch. I wouldn't buy this if it were up to me."
"Pours a fairly carbonated, light amber-orange with head that soon recedes. Smell is muted toastiness, a bit nutty and earthy. Fairly sweet. Taste delves into the roasty, almost burnt end of the spectrum. Finishes dry and bitter. Feels good. OK Oktoberfest, but I like most all of them.."
"Pours a clear copper with barely any head and little in the way of carbonation action; color is distinctly lighter than that of most other Oktoberfests. Aromas are fairly subdued and not very interesting; has the same toasty notes of any oktoberfest (and not much of them, at that), and little else. Taste is not bad at all, but disappointingly simple - very malty in a toasty sort of way with an extremely mild woody bitterness. Not a bad beer by any stretch but neither is it very interesting, especially when had side-by-side by other members of its style, as I am doing right now."
"I've only had a few Oktoberfest's but this one is kind of average to me. not bad but not good."
"Overall, not a terribly bad beer, but doesn't offer much to recomend it either. It is however, like Yuengling, an unoffending highly drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: Easy enough to drink, but probably not a beer I'd seek out."
"This is what was left in my buddy's fridge while watching the Boise State-VA Tech game tonight. I feel ya, VDubb. It pours a clear copper amber topped by nearly two fingers of cream-colored and -textured foam. The nose comprises Snuggle dryer sheets, flowers, light toffee, and light buttered toast. Seriously, I haven't sniffed Snuggle sheets in a while, but I confirmed my suspicions a bit later on in the evening. Odd. The taste wasn't much better, holding notes of some kinda sour-ish caramel, soap, squash, ginger, and some watery orange peel. Honestly, this wasn't very good on the tongue at all. The body is light, with a moderate carbonation and a dry-ish finish. Overall, a pretty sad excuse for an O-Fest, and the sentiment was shared by a couple others in attendance."
"Leinie's Oktoberfest pours a amber orange color with zero head to speak of. The color seems to me to be a smidge lighter than most Oktoberfests but it's not too far off. The smell is honestly not that great. It maybe for a number of reasons but it may be that when you get mass produced beers this is the way it turns out. The smell is of old hops that have seemingly gone past their prime. Overall, something is amiss. There almost seems to be a hint of roasted malt which is uncharacteristic of the style as well. The beer tastes of both the sweet malts that it is supposed to and the bitter stinging taste of hops that have perhaps been skunked (which is now my prevailing theory). The bitterness hits the tip of the tongue. The mouthfeel is really what you should expect and the drinkability is better straight out of the bottle like a cheap beer than poured into a pint glass. Overall this is a fine beer if you want to just kick back some cheap ones or to glaze your brats not that great, but drinkable."
"This beer is similar to all beers brewed by leinenkugel's brewing co. it is hard to drink, and has an all to similar malty taste. the punch of taste is not enjoyable, and is hard to even keep down. it cost a whopping 10$ for a six pack of 12 fl oz bottles, and is not worth it in my book. i do not recommend this beverage to anyone."
"d 4-4.5 this fest was made for gulpin, so that's just what i'll do, but one of this days this fest is gonna ... now how should that end? it really did disappear from my glass at an alarming rate, even though i envision it having been conceived in a lab where the recipe was born of stingyness and cunning. looked at another way, it's like a decent soft drink sort of beer."
"Poured into the weizen glass and saw the a well carbonated, copper color with a white, fluffy head that settled quickly. Aroma of malt is there, but a little faint and the taste matches the weak aroma. Slight bitterness matches the malt so it's balanced. Not a bad beer, but not overwhelming in taste. A little light for the style possibly, but not the end of the world. Lighter mouthfeel than others in the style, the lightness makes it easier to drink than others of a similar style."
"I have to say I love this beer. It may not be the greatest oktoberfest out there but its above par for American companies. This was the first real beer that I ever had. I don't consider big brewrey stuff like Bud and Miller real beer. Picked up my first twelve pack of the year today and I am sure there will be many more to come!"
"The taste is on par with the style. I do get the sweetness of malt up front, but the kick of that cooked vegetable taste is there (Not my favorite trait of this style)."
"Oktoberfest beers are my favorite style so this is a great time for beer. Leinies and Point are the first ones on the shelves here and I just had to pick them up. Both are a fairly average Oktoberfest. Leinies is a hair more spicy and Point is a hair more earthy. Truthfully they both are very similar and I can't tell them from each other unless they are side by side. I can't wait for the other brands to start showing up. I'll be getting more of both Leinies and Point until NG's Staghorn hits the shelves. Both really should be scored higher than I have. Alot of really great Oktoberfests out there. :)"
"Really disappointing, because this is one of my favorite styles in general."
"Like many other reviewers here, I found this beer to be merely adequate, but there are so many other more interesting Marzens that this one fades quickly to the back of the pack."
"honestly it wasn't so much appearance or anything it was lacking in. It was just lacking taste. I expected something more robust. This left me with nothing. At least it was reasonably priced."
"This might be my favorite Octoberfest brew. Pouring a bottle of Leinenkugel's Octoberfest into a mug leaves the drinker with a delicious beer. The color of the beer and head is enough reason to pour the beer. I became a pretty big fan of Octoberfest beers over the last year, and this one doesn't fail."
"D: Needs a bit more body. Burnt flavor needs to be removed and maltiness brought to the foreground."
"12 oz longneck brown bottle. Pours a orange-amber color with a thin off white head that quickly disapates. Aroma is of bready malt sweetness with a faint hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side for an Oktoberfest. Finish is sweet with toasted malt flavors. Not bad, but there a many better Oktoberfests out there."
"Taste: Biscuity and nutty. Little bit of banana flavor as well which is not bad tasting, but it's inappropriate for the style."
"Overall, this is a reasonable beer. It does not result in awe but is pleasing enough that I will enjoy a couple each year when it comes out."
"Not great. A rather week Oktoberfest."
"Overall, this is a ""lighter"" Oktoberfest making it a good entry into the style before moving up to more complex brands."
"Future outlook: This was pretty much awful. Not much more to say...I won't be purchasing this one."
"M/D - Another good beer from Leinenkugel's, very tasty, not overpowering in the malt department, pretty sweet taste. I brew to enjoy during cool evenings!"
"d - just a nondescript beer."
"Better Oktoberfests out there by a long way..."
"Drinkability: Pretty good. This is an Oktoberfest that I could certainly see myself getting again."
"A decently drinkable Oktoberfest. Nothing very special or memorable, but decent for what it is, an inexpensive macro craft october seasonal offering."
"Edit: This one definitely is a step below some of the other marzens I have recently enjoyed"
"D: Highly drinkable, not much giong on in this beer but it's not bad when you're looking for something simple on the sweeter side."
"Eh, not bad. The beer appears a clear copper orange with a little head lingering around the edges of my glass. The aroma is ripe with traditional, clean macro-continental lager, but also a little caramel a drop of cocoa. The flavor follows suit with a fruity lager yeast note like you might find in Heineken, followed by the caramelized malt. The flavor is actually step don in complexity from the aroma, but all in all it's clean, mass-produced amber lager in the style of an Oktoberfest. Certainly not a bad or offensive beer, but it doesn't taste like a true O-Fest."
"D: Smooth, crisp, and refreshing. Drinkability is definitely good, but this is just an average Oktoberfest/Marzen. I don't think I would seek it out again, but I don't have anything against it."
"I don't know what the ideal marzen is supposed to be like. I know enough to know this probably isn't it. Looks alright when poured from the tap. Brownish, redish, mahogony translucent with not much of a head at all. Not too much of a smell either. Taste is alright, toasted carmel malt, bready notes, a little more of a hop bite would have pulled this beer together better. Mouthfeel is a little too fizzy and watery. Something this dark I would expect to be much more full bodied. All in all not awful beer, but I'm sure it doesn't belong in the category of a great Oktoberfest."
"Drinkability: A decent Oktoberfestbier. I have been pleased with the overall selection this October and this beer is no different."
"Drinkability: A solid Octoberfest. 'Nuff said."
"Actually the futher into the bottle the more I liked the beer."
"The taste leaves a bit to be desired as well with the malts taking on a thin and toasty flavor and lacking some nice caramel sweetness. I think the toasty malt contributes more to a bittering finish than the actual hops do. The metallic and mineral components found in the nose can, unfortunately, still be found in the flavor. Carbonation levels are decent, but the overall mouthfeel is pretty watery. This is one oktoberfest I will not be re-purchasing."
"Notes - A decent oktoberfest, if someone offered me one I'd gladly take it. But there's no real reason to buy it when there's so many better oktos around at this time of year."
"I would probably not buy this again."
"It's not a beer I'd buy again but I wouldn't turn a free one down if offered."
"do yourself a favor and buy a real oktoberfest beer like Paulaner Oktoberfest."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle marked NOV3009-EO1160116. Sampled on October 10, 2009. The pour is a moderately clear copper color with a thin beige head. There is not a whole lot of life to the aroma. There are a few malts and neutral hops on the nose but the major scene is of some kind of rotted vegetation. The mouthfeel is in the medium range but pretty average. The taste has a hint of vegetation along with a tartiness that I cannot quite define."
"Drinks alright, not a really good take on the style, but neither is Sam Adams any more. I could get through a sixer of this during a football marathon if pressed, but not really even as good as its overall score..."
"Leinenkugel's is one of the cheapest beers ""with merit"" around so I guess it has that going for it but I'd suggest searching elsewhere for true brews."
"Let's just hope that the local stores don't hold out on us much longer."
"Unfortunately not all beers from a certain brewery are worthy of an A. This one seems very slightly thin and ever so slightly watered down. When poured into a Sam Adams perfect pour glass is produces a bunch of head and has a nice dark amber color. The aroma is sweet with caramel. Unfortunately it's light on flavor and body, just by a touch, not enough to make me put it down but it is noticeable."
"While some may say this one's thin, it's really not. A fairly good mouthfeel and even a little creaminess make this better than the watery brew some claim it is. Carbonation is light, especially considering the appearance, and the body is medium."
"I'll admit that I don't really have any experience with this style of beer, but there has to be better than this out there. I guess I'll find out for sure when the Sam Adams and Hofbrau hit the shelves at my local LCBO."
"From bottle. Pours a clear medium copper with medium white head. Aroma of toffee, caramel and biscuit malt. Definitely more of a malt presence than hops, which is to be expected. Medium to full-bodied with a tasty, easy drinkablility. Lacing lasts throughout the crisp finish, with malt presence remaining. Overall an above average seasonal offering from Leiney's - CHEERS!"
"Drinkability: It's drinkable, and with the low ABV it's an easy one to knock a few back, but it's nothing too exceptional for the style."
"Pours a deep, orange-amber body with a thick, puffy white head. Aroma has some malt sweetness, but also an adjunct smell that reminds me of macro lagers. Corn maybe? Mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonated bite. There are big, sweet toasted malt flavors from start to finish with just a hint of bitterness in the aftertaste. Overall, this is a decent beer, but nothing special about it at all."
"Aroma is malty and crisp with a yeasty undertone and a hint of fruit. It pours a nice dark golden amber with a fairly thick head that dissipates fairly quickly. Flavor is malty, but that is about it - the taste is strong, but not complex. Texture is rough and a little fizzy."
"Overall it isn't a good beer at all, and yet one of the better Leinenkugel beers. One of the worst Oktoberfests/Maerzens out there, though I haven't had the Michelob one. The only way Miller can save this product is if they stop mass producing it."
"I was very happy with this beer. I had it on tap first and something wasn't right(dirty tap lines) decided to try a bottle. Poured it and found it quite pleasant. Nice orange amber color with ample head at first then subsiding with not much lacing. the taste was somewhat spicey with malt up front and notes of grain(?) and caremel. Good carbonation. Overall a good session beer."
"Overall, not a bad Oktoberfest. I wasn't expecting much, and I actually got something out of it, which is a plus in my book. By no means a top tier beer, but a solid one none the less. Cheers, Leinenkugels!"
"It also has a less than satisfactory aftertaste."
"D- Since it's an Oktoberfest beer, it is made to be drank in larger quantities, but with this one, one is enough for me."
"Pours a crystal-clear amber, with a very sweet aroma. Tastes pretty sweet, too. In fact, the overly malty presence is overbearing, completely obscuring the flavor profile or the supposed ""4 specialty hops"". I hate to slander a ""German-style Marzen", but this one blows."
"I've been buzz sawing through all the oktoberfests I can get my hands on and figured I better give this one a try. Poured into my pint glass the beer is bright burnt orange. Rather clear with tiny bubbles floating to the top of my glass. Generous beige head rests atop my beer. After receding there is a tiny amount of lace left behind. The aroma is malty and pronounced. Some sweetness a touch of breadiness. By far the strongest nose I've found so far in the style. The flavor is spot on for the style. Nice smooth malt with a pleasant hop bite to round it out. A wheaty biscuity flavor is strong in the finish. Medium body moderate carbonation. Overall I have to declare a winner in the race for top marzen. I have a few more to try so I can't crown it yet but, Leinenkugels has wowed me for the first time in my life. This is what I'm looking for in an oktoberfest."
"Overall, not in-your-face by any means, but a nice, easy drinking, sessionable beer to be sure"
"This is an easy-to-drink beer that is refreshing, so I scored it well in terms of drinkability. It isn't going to challenge for Oktoberfest supremacy, but it is a decent beer to drink."
"Overall: The mouth feel is velvety and a little watery. The body of the beer is medium. This beer is not the greatest mazen beer. It sure is a leinen's beer, mediocre."
"(D)- A solid example of the marzen style. One of the better Leine's offerings out there. 6pks of this will not last long at all."
"German style Marzen pours light copper with medium carbonation. The smell told me Lager right away, not very complex. The taste surprised me a bit. It was very fresh, and surprisingly a fair amount of hop flavor. Overall mouthfeel was light, but refreshing. I can taste the malts too, the hops and malts are equal but not very strong."
"Overall- Light but easily drinkable. Probably won't buy it again but won't turn it down."
"D: A solid brew and definitely the best Leiney's I've tried yet. This was quite enjoyable and very approachable if you're looking for a beer for a wide audience (like my friends). Definitely a safe option beer when options are limited, a solid choice."
"Drinkability: Pretty good. I've never been to impressed with Leninkugel's, but this was very drinkable and does well in a lot of what I like in a Maerzen. Would drink again."
"D -- Okay -- gotta say, this is a very nice quaffer. The roastiness is not to-style for an Okto, but it's not distracting. It's not the best Okto I've ever sampled, but it's far from the worst. Worth a go for a lazy afternoon with friends."
"This brew has a tiny head, but pours into the glass with shining copper color and gold highlights. It's beautiful through the right glass until your done. The smell is not my favorite part. A little bit of hoppy yeast and toasty caramel and/or brown sugar. The taste is quick: a tastebuds encompassing flash of hoppy caramel and carbonation, but the mouthfeel is just barely thick enough for the style and it doesn't leave anything lying around. As long as I'm not in any sort of hurry I could drink it all night."
"Well I have to agree with the general consensus of reviewers. Not awful, but quite bland and not a good introduction for anyone to the marzen style. Appearance, ok not as coppery/amber as I would expect and looks a bit light. Smell is decent, slight honey with good caramel aroma. Taste, disappointment...kinda metallicy but very light and easy to drink."
"Drinkability: Fine, I guess..but not something I'd want to keep going for. Its a decent beer, just not the best marzen."
"A decent beer, but also very bland at the same time. I think this one misses the mark for the style."
"This beer is easily drinkable but not at all a good representative of the Octoberfest style. Too flat and lacking any complexity of flavor. Avoid."
"D-Good enough, but attempts at German styles should be left to the Germans."
"Not the worst beer to drink, but doesn't really match the style. Doubtful I would have this again."
"Beer pours a crips clear amber color. There is a one finger head that last and gives way to a decent lacing. The overall smell is of roasted malts, breads, cinnamon, and spice. The taste is very roasty with the hints of cinnamon and spice coming through. The carbonation is slightly high. The overall drinkability is high, it is a good oktoberfest, but not the best."
"drinkabilitity ultimately depends on how much you like the flavors, if they dont agree with you...then you may not want to partake in more than one. however if your in the mood for it, its pretty damn good. i liked it and i'd take another"
"Overall the drinkability was average, it tasted like an average beer with a touch of a darker beer but not necessarily an Oktoberfest styled beer."
"Out of a bottle this brew was an orange/amber color with a thin, off-white head. The retention was poor and the lacing so-so. The aroma was of big toasted malt with a dry grain background and some light bitterness from the hops. The flavors were at first dominated by the roasted malt but some hops did show up to offer balance eventually. The graininess was again there along with some wood notes, especially on the finish. Semi-bitter and semi-acidic. The mouthfeel was rough due to the carbonation being too high and the body being light/medium. A bad combination."
"Drinkability is average. This is not the best Oktoberfest I've had this year. It ranks above Becks, but far below Saranc. It's a decent beer if your in the season but theres definately better out there."
"Drinkability is good, though given the choice in the month of October, I'd move onto a different selection than double up this one."
"I am a fan of marsen beers. I had a few an this a pretty decent beer. Not heavy, light on the palete."
"Pours a light amber/brown color with a foamy light tan head that dissipates quickly. Mild malt aroma. Mild malt flavors. Slightly harsh bitter finish that leads to a nutty almond aftertaste. A light vienna. Not a bad octoberfest, probably Lienie's best beer ever (non big eddy)."
"D- This can be an easy to drink beer. Very light and not too strong."
"D: A decent mouthfeel and taste combination, but it was not too representative of a good Oktoberfest. Could have used a little more work in order to make it a better beer overall."
"This beer has the carbonation just right. All Leinie's needs to do is crank up the malt/hop/caramel characteristics of this beer and it would be outstanding."
"Nothing impressive about this one at all, but it's everywhere! I don't get it."
"D: I'm not sure what they were going for but it's very weak in taste and body. Nothing to offend on by any means, and good session beer no doubt, but I was looking for something a bit more from Leinenkugel."
"Serving type: Glass"
"D) Just not my cup of tea, the earthy flavors really rubbed me wrong. Nothing horridly wrong, I just don't like the recipe."
"This isn't a bad beer, in fact it may be one of the better Leines I've tasted. Now, that is not saying that this is a particularly good Octoberfest, but it is a decent slightly malted up, slightly carmelized lager beer with a decent balance of hops, some nice cracked grains, and an earthy quality that isn't bad. If you rate it as a Marzan, this beer will fall way short. On its own, it's not bad. This is amply carbonated, is refreshing, does not have any off tastes, or some cheaply added adjunct, characteristic of other Leines I've had. This is a solid beer, not complex, but respectable nonetheless. There is a slight mouth puckering dryness in the finish, but the aftertaste is very slight, and the mouthfeel is a little perked up from some nice hop balance."
"Pours an orange/amber color with somewhat creamy head with decent retention. Smell isnt the best. A very (very) strong biscuit smell with a bit of dry malt. I dont know how but somehow this beer just smells ""dry."" Taste is average. A chalky, malty backbone with some bread and biscuit flavor. A slight touch of burnt grain as well. Mouthfeel was pretty light and a bit fizzy, little too much carbonation. Overall this isnt a terrible beer, I didnt mind the 6 pack but probably wont be going back for another."
"This beer is a pale orange color that looks terribly overcarbonated. It smells weak and of watered down rice malt. Taste is quite bare too, very light and macro-esque. Perhaps a slight bit of malt flavor at the end, but perhaps thats the remnants of the beer I had in this before and did not properly wash out. Not a good beer, not at all."
"Pours with three finger white head that fades quickly leaving some lace. Crystal clear amber color. Light malty nose. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Flavor is malty, hints of caramel, typical Oktoberfest. $1.75 for a 12oz from Barb's Beer Emporium Concord, NH."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass longneck bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Poured into a pint glass, light to med brown in appearance with a light tan 1 finger head, Sweet malty aroma with traces of fruit present. Pretty typical in taste for a Marzen with malt sweetness being the dominant taste. Nicely carbonated and easy to drink. A nice Marzen but not up to the standards of the imported Marzens like Spaten and Paulaner and I think Sam Adams is also a better choice"
"D= good, nothing over powering and it goes down easy. If it was a little more interesting it would be worth a session but its very basic and smooth. Good beer for the average consumer I like it"
"Overall, just not a good beer and definitely not a good o'fest. One and done - almost drain pour halfway thru but I gutted it out. Avoid and grab a Leinie Red instead."
"Color is a golden amber with very little/non-existent head. Barely a discernable smell and the taste is generally lacking any distinguishing beer characteristics. This basically tastes like a very plain pale ale. Overall, not a bad beer but certainly nothing to get excited about."
"This fall offering pours a pale golden orange with a splotchy cap and sparse lacing. Small is stale yeasty malts. Almost a bit unpleasing. Taste is a bit better, sweet malts. Yeasty esters. Almost a bit bland. Mouthfeel is OK, a bit thick and chewy. I found this to be a fairly drinkable beer at a good price."
"Poured an attractive amber/copper color with a nice white head that lasted a while. The aroma was somewhat malty, but nothing really stood out. The flavor was quite mediocre. There was nothing really offensive about this beer, but nothing memorable either. Average brew."
"The beer pours an amber color with a 1/2"" offwhite head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light pale and crystal malt scent that is dry with some faint yeast esters. The crystal malt has a watered down aroma. The taste is average. It's not horrible, but it has an almost burnt quality to it. There is some malt character, but nothing too significant. It's mostly pale and crystal malts with some bisquity character. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an easy drinker, but that doesn't make it good."
"Pours a light, amber-golden color with an instantly disappearing 1/4 inch head. Lightweight body; slight malty aroma; slight malty taste but quite nondescript past that point: in other words, past the gesture of an octoberfest, one gets a rudimentary tasteless american beer. In fact, I'd suggest sticking to Leinie's red or even Leinie's original: beers that completely live up to their names and are honestly affordable good 'micros.'"
"Leinenkugel's Oktoberfest pours a light copper color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is malty. The flavor is on the malty side but has an unpleasant metallic note until it warms up. Once the metallic note fades, it leaves a mediocre marzen, malty but not especially flavorful, a bit of hops in the finish. Disappointing."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Poured a lite amber color with good carbonation and head that lasted seconds. Aroma was somewhat malty, and weak. Taste was watered down with no hint of any spice. Not a very good beer. Maybe it was skunked, so I tried a second one, nope, it just wasn't a very good ofest."
"Drinkability- Your average Joe six-pack may like this beer, which I suppose they are marketing to. I would think it would be wiser to make a better product as Sam Adams does much better with an equal or lesser price."
"All in all, not bad brew."
"This beer does have a nice amber-gold color, but it lacks head-retention. The nose is malty with a good toasted edge. Not too bad a flavor... toasty like the aroma but it could use some more malt to keep away the blandness. Moderately crisp, medium-bodied... not too bad for the range of oktoberfests out there from American micros. Better than the other Leinenkugel beers I've had."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not filling at all, mild kick, decent representation of style, it's not a bad beer but there are definitely a lot of other O-fests out there that are significantly better."
"D - This is an okay oktoberfest. Nothing fabulous but drinkable."
"D: Drinkable enough, but not very exciting. Weakest Oktoberfest I've tried so far."
"Not one of the best Oktoberfests I've had this year."
"Pours a clear reddish orange with fast fading fluffy head, sheets of lacing for the first few inches. Smell: toasted malt, vegetal hop. Taste: toasted malt flavors, leafy hops, some munich malts in the middle of the sip, but finishes with an odd metallic and hard water character. Medium bodied from the carbonation, could be a bit heavier. Not terrible, but certainly not on my list of ofests to pick up again."
"Not the best beer I've ever had, but far from the worst...very average."
"This one was kind of a let-down for me. I'm generally a fan of the Marzen style, especially this time of the year. Doesn't even hold a candle to Sam Adams which I use as a benchmark for easy to find Oktoberfest styles. The flavoring was slightly bland and the coloring a little lighter than expected. I expected much better from the guys that make sunset wheat."
"D: I'll reach for another, if I have a few real beers first. I would not recommend drinking this until later in the evening."
"D: No flavor, not worth drinking."
"Notes: Overall it's a nice easy drinking but average Oktoberfest."
"Pours a nice copper with amber hues.One finger white head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma is of toasty grains,and maybe a hint of fruit. Body is on the thin side and carbonated. Taste is roasted and bready up front with a bit of hops in the finish. Not bad."
"A amber colored lager not much of an Octoberfest beer but a decent drinkability. Served chilled at about 43. Poured into pint glass. No head at all. Slight burnt matly taste with a mild hoppy finish. Crisp and light in the mouth. Its cheap and not that bad to drink if your gettin loaded dont rush to the store to buy it."
"Nicely done, and well balanced. An easy drinking beer that's great for crisp autumn weather (or anytime really)!"
"Interesting to say the least, not a whole lot worked for me at all with this. Strange flavors and a weak body really limited the drinkibility as well. I would not try this again."
"This tastes like seltzer water and caramel malts with a touch of hops. Not very good."
"Finally broke down and purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Poured a medium foamy head on a light amber body. Smells were fairly light, sweet, caramel, a touch of hoppiness. Taste followed suit, adding in a bit of maple syrup. I like Leinie's beers, but with this brew, in line with many of their catalog, Leinie's seems to be thinking more of mass appeal than really striving for something out of the ballpark. It's not a bad beer, pretty good and easily findable, just nothing to push it up towards the top of the style."
"This is without a doubt the worst Octoberfest beer I've ever had. It tastes like 90% bud light mixed wth 10% Guiness, couldn't finish the bottle."
"Poured a reddish copper color. Lots of head after a hard pour. Head was slightly offwhite. AFter the hard pour the head hung around awhile and left some decent lacing. Smelled a little of caramel, malt, and grain. Also a hint of alcohol. Taste was weird, slightly bitter. That taste hung around a while. It was almost like there was no taste. Maybe a little caramel but not much. Maybe more sweet than caramel. To me it was hard to describe. Felt ok in the mouth. I thought the carbonation was about right. I was trying some different Octoberfest style brew and felt I wasted my money on this one. If you try this beer, make sure you have a hard pour. I think it made all the difference in the world with the appearance."
"Fizzy, overcarbed bite to it. Sweet and yucky veggie like in the middle, and sickening grainy/metallic finish. O-fest? This is a definite No-fest for me. More like a Yuck-fest, bleh."
"D - Bleh. This is probably the first bonafide offensive oktoberfest I've had this year. There's something about the dirt/earth flavor that really detracts. Mostly the rest of the flavors are there, but too muted and overpowered."
"A great, drinkable beer, and overall a great offering amongst the Oktoberfest seasonals. In my opinion, this is one of closer adherents to the original, though it could use a slight up in the maltiness, body, and alcohol content."
"I wasn't really expecting to like this beer but despite the artificial sweetener and lack of conformity to the style, I kind of enjoyed it. Worth a try and I could see picking it up again."
"Everything about this beer is great, except the flavor."
"A good middle-of-the-road example of the style it claims to represent. You can't go wrong, especially if you've never tried the style and you see this example."
"Overall, this is not a great beer. There is absolutely zero complexity and it has many attributes of a macro lager. Worthy a try? Yes. Will I be buying any more? No."
"Flavor is quite enjoyable without having any real complexity. Other elements are a bit ho-hum but there are no extreme faults either. You could down big mugs of this while doing the polka, and its flavor is nice enough to be enjoyed any old time...but I'd probably reach for a stronger representation of the style next time. Preferably one from the homeland."
"D: This is totally to style, its not exactly the best or most outrageous beer to drink, but it definitely goes down easy, and I could see myself spending a night with some sausage, sauerkraut and some of this stuff. Not too shabby in that aspect. Overall not something I'd reach for all the time."
"D: In fairness, its light taste and thin mouth make for drinking a lot pretty easy. A sixer is affordable and could go down easy in one setting. This is a good one for the relatives that come over and want a ""special"" beer but don't like the ones with a lot of taste and character."
"3/3/3.5/3/3.5"
"D- Easy drinking beer but theres nothing at all that would make me want to revisit this one."
"Leine's Oktoberfest pours an attractive orange brown color with some visible carbonation and an attractive, sturdy 1 finger off white head. Clean, sweet roasted malt in the nose. Caramel malts and a bit of spicy, peppery nuttiness from the bready yeast used. Pumpkin spice and ginger come through also, really making it feel like a fall brew. Good citrusy hop bite on the finish and into the aftertaste as well creates excellent balance. Tingling mouth-feel, light/medium body, slightly grainy but it does have character. Good beer. Worth a shot."
"In my quest to sample some Marzen/Oktoberfest beers, I seem to have gotten into aa mediocre rut. This beer was not bad-looking, a copper color with a medium white head. After that, there wasn't much else to say about it. It had a faint malt aroma and a faint malt taste. I think there was a hint of hops, but I couldn't be sure. Not a beer I would want to drink too many of."
"Very lite in the hop category with the aroma, and the quaff doesn't add much either. I'm afraid this is more of a hoppy pilsner than an Octoberfest. Disappointing attempt at the style. This will be a one and done sixer."
"D - If you are looking for something amber without any offensive flavors, that you could drink all night long, this is for you. I don't think I would call it an Oktoberfest, though."
"drinkability is decent. this is a thin marzen without the heartyness and warming quality that makes the style so appealing for the fall season. a dissapointing brew from Leinie's."
"D- There are many better american oktoberfests out there. I'd avoid this one."
"D - 3.5 - this is a pretty good beer if you like malts. There is no balance to this brew, but it definitely goes well with the season."
"this beer pours up an amber coor with a decent white head. the nose is very boring. just your everyday, run of the mill, sweet malts. the taste is decent bitter malts. Not the best Oktoberfest I've had but a decent American one."
"Tis the season to try as many Oktoberfest lagers as possible and since I can't be in Munich like my kids and their friends, I've tried a few of those available. We don't get many Leinie's brews here (other than the ""soda pop"" beers that seem to show up everywhere). So I was excited to try something different from Leinie's. This was interesting. Deep orange/amber in the glass, clear with a decent head. Rather ""fizzy"" and thin mouthfeel, little in the nose, but a heavy malt flavor in the initial taste. All malt. And then more malt. Butter dripping slick almost cloying malt--albeit in a fizzy, watery base. No hops at all. Nice try, but nothing I'd seek to buy."
"Overall impression: This seems like a below average amber to me - certainly doesn't stand out either on its own or as an oktoberfest"
"D: Leinie's Oktoberfest is okay but it falls far short of the best offerings in this style."
"A thin tea-like, fizzy O-fest. Not a good example of the style."
"Clear orangey-amber color with a fluffy lid of off-white foam. Smells of munichy and toasted grains with a subtle sweetness and some musty-earthy hops. Flavor is not great. Slightly sweet grain with some watery toasted grains and musty-herbal, earthy hops. Smooth light-medium body is a bit watery with a moderately crisp carbonation. Not one of the best as I suspected it may not be."
"Drinkability is pretty good. If you're in the mood for a moderately cheap Oktoberfest, this is a good six-pack to go with. Other than that, it's pretty much your basic holiday beer."
"Overall a refreshing beer I don't mind drinking."
"Thats just my opinion, and its hard to compare to sam adams."
"While not a ""top tier"" O-fest by any means, it meets the basic characteristics of the style and is easy enough to drink. Decent choice for the price."
"strong corn flavor and some hops at the end, to much carbonation and not impresed with this offering at all, i love this stile but this is a sad offring at best, i am glad that i only bought the one bottle of this one. maby i will try one next year but not in any rush to do so"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a golden-copper color with a dense, one-finger, creamy looking head. The smell is malty as one might expect from the style, amber and slightly toasted grains are present. Not a whole lot more discernable about it for me. The taste is reflective of the nose; a solid amber malty backbone with hopping to balance but no hop presence, finishes slightly bitter. The mouthfeel isn't quite as dense as I would expect from the style, a light-medium bodied beer with a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is not bad, but not outstanding either. Same with the beer overall, not bad but very underwhelming."
"I guess you could call this drinkable in that it isn't offensive or challenging to drink, but I don't think that is really in the keeping of the spirit of BA. If this wasn't in the fridge, I wouldn't have another. Not good and not worth paying craft prices when you could get innumerable Oktoberfest beers that are much better."
"D: For the most part, a good beer to drink. The taste is better than the nose and good character carried through. Has its faults but in the long run, Im a pretty big fan of this one. Nice little surprise. Surely not great, but not awful as many others seem to feel."
"D- Not bad, but there are many Oktoberfests that I prefer. Don't know if I will purchase this one again."
"D--Sure."
"Overall I'm not impressed one bit. This could have been a better beer. Being that I'm from the great land of Wisconsin I always give my local beers a fighting chance, this one unfortunately never should have happened. Lately Leinenkugels has been hit or miss with me. Hit with Creamy Dark, miss with Summer Shandy. Hit with Red, miss with Sunset Wheat. Hit with Honey Weiss, miss with Oktoberfest. Can't win 'em all."
"Not a good Octoberfest beer. It was the correct color but thats about it. The taste was way off, I would not even call it an Octoberfest. I am not sure what to think about Leinenkugel with all their weird beers but this one def. did not help. Don't even bother trying this one, just stay away."
"Overall, the price is low and the flavor is decent. If you find it on sale, it is worth it to pick some up."
"Serving type: bottle"
"This would be a really good oktoberfest if there was a little more caramel sweetness to round out the malt profile."
"Nothing above and beyond..."
"D: Definitely on the wrong side of my favorite Oktoberfest list. Don't thing I'll be having this one again."
"Not a real good effort, but, keep trying!"
"D- Decent, but probably wouldn't have again."
"Well, first of the style to show up in town and actually, the first time the Leinie's has shown up here and..I don't find it to be a well rounded brew...no symphany of flavours here. Too bad. ;^("
"A smooth lager and a malty beer overall. The mouthfeel is a tad watery however. Syrupy with hints of caramel and maple. Give me a strong malt presence in this beer, please - a decent Oktoberfest"
"D- I was very disappointed in this one. There's just so many better so I'll just have to pass."
"Verfy drinkable but there are others more drinkable. It is well worth the time to sit down with a few and enjoy on a nice evening."
"A nice flavor but not really what I look for in an Oktoberfest."
"Lousy marzen presented by a usually decent brewer. Aroma is non-existent, appearance is good with a nice bronze color and small creamy head. average feel here with a weak finish. Flavor is decent for a standard lager but falls fairly short for an oktoberfest. I have a sneaking suspicion that Leinenkugel's may be falling to the wayward hands of their owner, I only hope their other brews aren't being compromised by cheap ingredients."
"Poured a very orange copper color. There was a thin off white head that dissipated quickly and left no lacing. The aroma is very mild, some malt, light spice noticeable. The taste is thin with a little alcohol in the finish. Some decent hops flavor, but relatively unnoticeable and forgettable taste. This is a mediocre brew from Lenie's for whom I respect most of the beer they brew. Not their best work here."
"As with most of Leinkugel's beers, this leans more towards a macro than a micro. It pours a clear copper color with a suddy light beige head. The nose is grainy with some spices. The taste is mostly weak malt and old hops. Body is light and fizzy. Not the best example of the style."
"So if you like Leinenkugels original, of which I do find to be a pretty good lager, then you'll like this. Its just mis-labeled as an Oktoberfest."
"Drinkability - easily sessionable but I'd generally go for something with a little more roast/toast to it for an OFest. Doesn't stand up against its similarly priced peers of the style."
"Has a pleasing copper color with a light tan head, but the taste is quite nondescript. Flavor is basically just malt with a bit of grass or earthiness to it, though it does have a light, crisp finish that makes me think it could be consumed in large quantities if taste or complexity arent really concerns."
"D- Okay drinkability, not a beer I would get again."
"Drinkability is good with this beer - it's one to try if you find it."
"Overall- It wasn't a terrible beer by any means. When presented with limited options at a bar, I'd give this one another go. It just wasn't flavorful enought to make me say it was really good. I went into this beer expecting a bit more."
"This beer isn't the best Oktoberfest beer I have had but it has enough light flavor throuhgout to keep things interesting when you don't want to be overpowered by the beer. It would be easy to throw back several of these."
"Fits the profile. This is the type of beer that I would be more than happy to get at a restaurant with a limited selection and might buy a six pack once in a while for an easy going, drinkable lager."
"Drinkability: A poor representation of the style, and an outright disappointing beer."
"overall, this isnt too bad, but its kind of lacking in the flavor, sessionable"
"Drinkability - Not bad, a good backup plan. Something friends who aren't into craft beers could enjoy."
"Edit - the first one of these I had alone, and I wasn't particularly impressed. The last one I had outside at a ballgame with a brat, and I felt much better about it. Granted, it's not a particularly impressive Oktoberfest and I think Leinies can do better, but it is better than a Budweiser."
"There really isnt anything special about this beer. Not a great appreance. kinda orangy lager color. Not really any octoberfest taste that I could pick out. Very thin watery mouthfeel. Overall just a big dissapointment."
"Leinenkugel's Oktoberfest was amber in color with good clarity. It had an off-white head with decent retention and left a little spotty lace behind. The aroma was toasted malt. The taste was toasted malt and hops with a little sweetness upfront and a semi-dry finish. It was medium-light in body with plenty carbonation. Drinkability was average. It's an average beer, but a little thin for an Oktoberfest."
"A fairly light beer with a slight fizz on the tongue. Could drink a few of these quit easily. Nothing great here but it is a decent beer to enjoy on a cool afternoon. I would buy it again if I could find it for a discounted price."
"D - Average tasting oktoberfest style beer. Just average."
"I liked this one. Buyed it to try it, was nicely priced, and I love Oktoberfests, so gave it a whirl when I found it. Smells of caramel and munich malts, no hops to speak of, at least undetectable, but the style requires little anyway. Had a little lacing and decent head. Tasted good. Rich malts with a nice caramel front and back, and as most Oktober's, easy to drink. Will check it out again."
"Better than most run of the mill but nothing to seek out when others are out there at similar prices."
"Thanks to mac56 for this one."
"Originally reviewed on September 17, 2005 at the Big Lake Brewfest. Light dusty malt aroma. Clear orange with off-white head. Nasty plant malt, without much of anything. Extremely bland finish. This is worthless. Both skunky and sugary, not it doesn't really have any merit in the style."
"Pours a clear shade of orange-copper. Two and a half fingers of creamy, egg-shell tinted head show decent retention and light spotty lacing. Crystal malt and dextrins in the nose, with a subtle flowery hop aroma. Caramel sweetness upfront, follwed by an indistinct adjunct taste. Lighter flavor, but non-offensive. Dry aftertaste, spicy tettnanger hop flavor and a great deal of bland hop bitterness. Thin bodied with high carbonation that creates a light and crisp mouthfeel. Dextrinous finish showing a hint of toasty Vienna malt, with a stubborn hop bitterness that really throws the balance off. This has a good drinkability, but given the lack of malt character and assertive hops, it seems to miss the point of the style."
"Overall this is a skipable O-fest, unless you are looking for a cheap (I got my 6-pack for $4.99), low flavor, highly consumable, O-fest beer. I am really not liking Leinenkugel's seasonal offerings."
"Drinkability: I wouldn't recommend this take on the Oktoberfest style."
"A very disappointing Octoberfest. I didn't think slapping a label on a beer is all it takes to make an Oktoberfest is it? Way too bland, tastes like a macro with a bit of artificial flavorings. Without a label, people would be all over the map trying to nail the style. As a lager, I would have given it an ""Average"" for taste, but masquerading as an Oktoberfest, I give it a ""Not Impressed""."
"this is an alright octoberfest, its a little thin, it does have that ""american lager smell"" which i think has not place in a german style beer."
"When it comes to O/M I expected Lienie's to really deliver for some reason. Unfortunately this offering, while respectable, is definately a lightwieght. Light color, light aroma, light taste with some mentionable toasted character, fizzy mouthfeel. An all around average oktoberfest to be sure. It goes down smooth though. I think I drank 4 in one sitting."
"Appears a light copper orange with a quickly dwindling white head leaves thin specks of lacing. Aroma has a strong metallic tone with weak watery caramel malts, and not hop profile to speak about. Taste is flooded with grainy notes more metal highlights alot of caramel but it comes of sour and acidic in nature. Mouthfeel has a watery feel to it very light bodied with high carbonation. Drinkability this isn't where it's at not just style wise it's a poorly constructed beer, drain pour."
"Always a sucker for the seasonals, even if I know that they won't be great brews. Though the beer has some nice caramel and bready flavors, but not the body, or the malt additions to properly disquise the graininess and weakness. Hopped nicely for an earthy, european character, but again, falls a little metalic under the timid body. Finishes a little minty-fresh and alcoholic, but reamining grainy and weak."
"I had this beer out of a 12 ounce bottle poured into a glass mug. It was a dark amber with a slight head with little retention or lacing. The smell was weak and slightly citrusy. There was almost nothing to the taste other than a acidic tinny flavor. I did not enjoy this beer, yet have several more of them on chill. Thankfully I have superior Oktoberfests to drink."
"So, first beer from this brewery, a seasonal, not bad. I'd still put this in a average category, lots of other things to try and price doesn't allow this to be stocked in my fridge. It did make me want to buy some Genny Red..."
"Drinkability - Ugh. I like the oktoberfest style especially in the fall, but this beer does the style wrong. Only the faintest hints of the style are present. Even more, the taste of this beer is actively offensive. You can have the rest of mine."
"""Worth a try"" does seem to describe this beer the best! An overall average American version of an oktoberfest brew. I am more for the big malty, robust flavors of the fall! But in all respects, give it a try...cheers!"
"doesn't rank very high on my list of other Octoberfest type beers I have tried."
"D- This is Oktoberfest light. I have trouble even calling this Oktoberfest. It will work for those who drink Lite but for snob, it leaves me flat. Not one of the better Leinie efforts."
"Dits ok, but not a much flavor as I hoped for"
"I might buy a few sixers for my dad and brother this fall (I'll hide their Bud Light and pull the old switcho-chango....we'll see what happens)."
"D- This beer didn't have a lot of depth but it was also not real interesting in flavor either. The pot caramel was the only real flavor and it was a bit off."
"A good Marzen, which I knew nothing of when I first reviewed."
"This is not an Oktoberfest. It is a slightly maltier version of a pilsner. The aroma is almost non-existent, the taste is bland, with only a faint malt. Drinkability is slightly above average because it doesn't have any negative distinguishing features. An average beer all around, more interesting than a typical BMC but not nearly as interesting as a typical micro beer."
"Another solid beer from Leinenkugel. I do feel fortunate that these guys have their beers in Detroit, as they are a nice change up from time to time, and they rarely disappoint. Pours out to a deep bronze color with a nice 1/2 inch head. Rings of lace are present on the interior the glass. Medium level of carbonation. Smell is faint, but notes of malt and grain are detected, with an overall sweetness and a hint of earth that initially smells skunky, but blooms into more of a natural chipped wood aroma. It's hard to understand, yes, I know. But that's what I got from it. Anyhow, taste is medium bodied and laden with flavors of lightly roasted malts, some dough, corn and hops. Not bad. Mouthfeel was nominal for the style; nothing special, yet not bad. Overall drinkability is above average. I'd have no problem having this in my fridge during Oktoberfest time. Worth a try."
"A bit overly fizzy and the hop bite was a bit stronger that others of the style I've had in the past. Malt was a bit suppresed as well. Kind of reminiscent of a hybrid between what it should be and a more ""mainstream"" lager. Just barely decent, certainly nothing to write home about or search for. Has potential if they feel like tweaking the recipe and toning down the megabrew BS lager side of the formula and making it a real octoberfest/marzen, IMO."
"Pours a decent coppery color. This beer ""fizzed"" like a soda would when poured. Great head that was gone in an instant-very noisy though. Sharp coppery aroma-smells like a penny. The flavor is a touch better-the highlight being the slightly sweet malty after taste. Average body overall-certainly no maerzen. Sort of dissappointing actually. Some of the other Leinie products I have had wern't all bad. Skip this one though."
"021919"
"Pours a clear, medium amber with a small, foamy off-white head that quickly diminishes to a small film. Some sparse lacing. The smell is nice and malty. Grassy, caramel, brown sugar, doughy bread, lightly floral. The taste has an initially well-rounded dominant malt accompanied by a light citrus, but it runs a little thin on its way to the floral, lightly bitter finish. It has a medium body, dry texture and soft carbonation. Not too shabby at all. Nothing spectacular, but when you take price into account, this is quite worth it."
"12 ounce bottle. Pours out a mostly clear copper color with a small head. Strong aroma of grain. The aroma is a little herbal, and very unpleasant. This beer has that nasty wet carboard flavor with sugar and adjuncts. No toasted malt flavor. Maybe a little hop flavor, but it's hard to tell. This beer is pretty bad, even by macro standards. At least most macros have the sense to be bland. This is flavorful, but the flavor is nasty. Not a drain pour, but close."
"Thin white head raises to one finger and disipates fast lingers at nearly nothing and laces slightly but follows the beer down the glass. The smell is faint, not good at all, musty almost, very grainy...it may be a blessing that it is a faint smell. Taste however is actually quite nice at first, full and malty...very ""clean"" finish as AB puts it....which means nothing is there, no after taste nothing. Mouthfeel is water but ok. A very average beer."
"A little weak for an Oktoberfest but not a bad beer. Drinkable but not outstanding."
"The worst tasting Oktoberfest I have come across, to be avoided."
"Overall I was a bit impressed with this offering. My expectations were a little surpassed. A sweeter than dry Oktoberfest with a good (but fleeting) flavor profile that requires no pondering - just drink and be merry. A good beer to have for curious fence-riding newbies."
"Leinie's Oktoberfest pours a tawny color, probably on the lighter end of the scale for the style colorwise. It's capped by a head of impressive (and, no doubt, chemically-aided) longevity, which provides good lacing. Looks pretty good. Smells malty and slightly musty. The taste is similar, though I swear there's a touch of banana, with a little bit of a toasted finish. The aftertaste has a hint of phenol and metal, mmm. I don't want any more of this--sorry Dad."
"Ahhh...What can I say? A cool refreshing cheap beer from the master's of Leinenkugel! This is a good BBQ, Lawn-mowing, Football watching beer and is always a tasty treat in the cool, crisp, Wisconsin autumn's. Looks nice in a glass and has a crisp, hearty flavor. I think Leinenkugel is underated as an everyday beer and would strongly reccommend as a replacement to your Bud or Miller rituals! At $8.49 a twelver, I'll buy everytime! :)"
" A lightweight entry in the field. Best to avoid."
"A good try at a Wisconsin Okto that is hamstring by megabrew constraints. Decently golden brown color and foamy head. A nice amber malt character, but nothing that says its anything but a lager with a few darker grains thrown in. No real faults as a beer, but Oktos are too easy a style to go bland in."
"This beer pours a copper orange color with an average sized head. It smells malty, but a little plain. Taste: Carmel, Carmel, Carmel! The carmelized malts really stand out in this one leaving a nice sweet flavor and a very welcoming aftertaste. The mouthfeel and drinkability are also excellent. I could drink several of these. A decent Oktoberfest. A good beer. When something like this is around there's really no excuse to resort to budweiser or miller lite. Quality beer at a low price. Worth a try!"
"Pours a copper color with a small head that doesn't stick around too long. The aroma is a little weak, but there is a caramel and a very small amount of lager stank. The flavor was subdued a bit. Has a caramel character with a bready feel, but nothing spectacular. This is just a run of the mill Oktoberfest."
"This leaves the bottle a golden color with a finger of head that falls to ring the beer. The nose is definately marzen. Lots of caramel and some of the lager characters, but not so strong. The flavor is a little thin and watery with a caramel tone to it as well. There is a sweet finish. The feel is moderate at best. Drinkability is just okay. Nothing special here. I'd take a Spaten over this one."
"A good O'fest. Not a great one, but not a bad one either."
"This may be a good intro to the style for some folks. While not a bad beer in any category, it is not good enough to move far up the rankings. Of the Wisconsin Regional Breweries Oktoberfests, this one comes in 4th behind the offerings from Point, Berghoff/Huber & City."
"This beer is an ideal entry level Oktoberfest to introduce someone to. It is no too over powering and is an ok session beer. Beer pours a copper color with very little head, actually when poured into a pint glass there is very little head, but for some reason the opposite is true when your drinking it straight out of the bottle, it get foamin up. Suspect it has something to do with the general overcarbonation of Leinies' beers in my opinion. I do not get a strong smell of anything in particular. Beer is rather sweet, perhaps the sweetest Oktoberfest I have had this year, can really taste the malt, but cannot detect hops or alcohol. Beer tastes better cold than warm."
"Believe it or not, I know that SAB/Miller/Leinie can do better than this timid ""seasonal""."
"This is the kind of beer that's made to pound, straight from the bottle. I almost feel the urge to add something to it to make it taste like something, anything. This is not a good beer."
"Came in a sampler of WI O-fests I recently received. Pours a light copper-straw with a thin off-white head. Smells of singed sweet bread malt with a mild Scotch tape hop smell. I'm not a huge 3M adhesive-smell fan, but it's not too off-putting. Taste comes at you with a bready and bland malt attack up front. Okay, maybe more of a ""coast it on in in neutral"" than an attack. Anyway, this gives way to a cereal malt wash midway and finally to some indistinct, yet mildly bitter, hops. Finish is a little astringent. Mouthfeel is average to thin (for an Ofest). Overall, slightly more malt and character than a Leinie's lager or Northwoods, but a rather watered-down Oktoberfest."
"Crystal clear amber color with a thin white head, with some lacing. Nice malt and yeast balancing in the nose, toasted bread malt aroma, and the yeast smells somewhat spicey. Clean flavor dominated by malt, finishs dry with a little grainy astringency. Overall a very good Oktoberfest style."
"Not too much to complain about, but certainly no overwhelmingly good traits. Leinenkugel's has much better styles, but go ahead and try this one for something different."
"The beer warmed up and I warmed up to it. The carb toned down and the maltyness came out to greet me. Still not a great beer, the taste and drinkability got bumped up"
"Looks pretty good: Clear dark amber with a decent-sized off-white head. Head dissipates quickly and leaves a few random patches on the glass. Smell is mildly malty. Taste is sweet and malty, but weak. Really, not much going on here! Are there hops in this? Slightly sour aftertaste. Watery mouthfeel. Not bad... but not very good, either."
"I find myself without a strong opinion on this beer. It isn't bad, but there's really nothing to recommend it either. I find it to be middle-of-the-road as far as Leinie's goes: better than Berry Weiss and Honey Weiss, but not as good as Creamy Dark and Red. Before drinking what is my first every Oktoberfest, I wondered what an Oktoberfest was supposed to taste like. After drinking it, I'm still not sure that I know."
"Pours a clear autumn amber with a slight egg-shell colored head that forms a nice inch & a half but fades to a thin film rather quick. The carbonation is up abit ti almost fizz-like. The smell is slightly sweet. Hop in the taste is slight as well but just enough to balance to a dry mouth finish. The body is light, alittle watery but drinkable."
"All and all just a maltier version of the regular Leinie's beers."
"Pours an amber hue with a white head. Malty sweetness, medium bitterness, average for an O'fest beer. I still have a few left, and its not bad but not great. Better than budweiser. Since you won't run into these guys until next year, I will say that it is better than a macro lager. But not my favorite of this style."
"dark golden color, cheap foamy head and no lace.  nice toasted malt aroma is cut down to size by the adjunct used (corn).  taste mimics smell...your interest is piqued by a biscuity goodness that is soon drowned in adjunct badness.  pretty light and fairly smooth mouthfeel. thin hop profile adds nothing. o-fest light.  easy to drink with hints of caramel malt flavors.  fairly lame and tame."
"Deep amber in color, the head is beige, the lace is adequate. The nose is caramel, sweet, malt and quite pleasing. Front sweet, the top is light to moderate, the finish is lightly dry, middlingly acidic, basally hopped, drinkable, but nothing to get excitied about as with most of ""Lennies"" beers. Does not rank on my current 1000 beer master list."
"A slightly above average beer in general, but a weak Oktoberfest.  The color was light amber and there was very little aroma.  The taste was sweet and malty but very light.  Might be a good entry Oktoberfest for someone trying the style for the first time after only drinking macros, but I like more flavor."
"A very light version of an Octoberfest.  Slightly sweet, but in a good way.  More like an amber than a marzen.  Someone mentioned a mix of an octoberfest and a Killian's Red.  I'd say that was right on.  Drinkable and good, but not the best offering of the style."
"Copper in hue w/ trace haze, covered by a very dense persistent head that leaves Belgian lace. The aroma is dominated by sweetness derived from both caramel malt and unfortunately, corn.  Toasty Munich malt and a lemony hop nose are secondary and very light.  Bready sweetness upfront is followed by mildly buttery malt and notes of grain husk.  Sweetness then mimics the aroma mid palate, becoming a combination of caramel malt and cooked corn.  Hop bitterness is paltry, but since overall sweetness is fairly light for style, decent balance is acheived.  Moderate in body, w/ a surprisingly dextrinous mouthfeel considering the apparent use of adjuncts.  Finishes with notes of sweet biscuit and grits.  An odd, and not particularly good oktoberfest.  Think Paulaner's Oktoberfest mixed 50/50 w/ Killian's Red."
"I dont think this is up to BA standards of what an Oktoberfest beer should deliver.  Ill skip this one next year."
"Clear copper color.  A big pillowy white head sits on top.  Pretty decent aroma dominated by a luscious sweet malt presence.  Taste has an interesting hop presence.  Nice little hebalness, which add nicely to the underlying toasted malt taste.  Medium to full in body and goes down the hatch fairly effortlessly.  A little better than average for an Ofest."
"A pretty average Octoberfest that works nicely as a thrist quenching amber style beer....The nose is unremarkable...some maltiness, but some corn or adjunct smell as well...body is thin for this style but I don't mind it so much...I bought this figuring it would have some decent malt tones and be rather thin/easy drinking...I was dying of thirst after work tonight and this went down nicely....The taste is on the malty side but not real heavy...it does finish with a little dry note...not an all-time great, but one that can be enjoyed in the right spot..."
"Body is void of any real flaws, but lacks any real stellar traits either.  Easy drinking, no-brainer stuff."
"Clear amber orange color, head thin and quickly down to a 1/8 inch.  Very little in the aroma department.  Decent malt flavor, mostly in a brown sugar range with peppery hops showing earlier than some Fests.  Both malt and hop could be stronger -- in a point/counterpoint manner.  Thin mouthfeel...Pretty average, but drinkable.  May be one of ""Leinie's"" better efforts."
"Rather light in aroma, more of a  pale malt than lightly roasted. Reddish, orangish and gold in color.  Bright and clear.  Big and solid head.  A nice looking beer.  A Maerzen made more for the masses than lovers of this style.  Flavor lacks the boldness I'd expect, but is of a stronger malt than just pale malt with some richness in middle to finish, leaving some dryness on the tongue.  Medium body that seems appropriate with adequate carbonation. For me not an altogether poor start to the Oktoberfest season."
