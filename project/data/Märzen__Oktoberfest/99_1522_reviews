"I was expecting a better effort. Not a whole lot of flavor, lacking any malt undertones. Take the label off and it would be an average amber ale."
""
""
"Not the best not the worst Octoberfest I had. Tastes like a regular amber lager. No significant notes.  Lacing is not to bad. loses the head quickly"

"Color and appearance is good but the aroma and taste has too much floral hops for the style.  Also, the mouthfeel was rather watery which accentuated the bitter finish. Somewhat surprising considering how well balanced the Saranac pumpkin is."

"It doesn't have the punch of an Otter Creek or Thomas Hooker Oktoberfest, but as 'The Bros' point out, it is extremely drinkable.  Not a session beer, but definitely a beer to pair with brauts & sauerkraut."
""
""
"A little on the pricey side but a well rounded beer nonetheless. Smooth from the start with gentle malt flavor and a hint floral grains on the finish. Flavor lasts a second or too after swallowing. Nothing spectacular here but a good starter to the style. Very drinkable."

"Mediocre. Typical for Saranac; not great, but not bad. I would take it if nothing else good were available. It's not a bad Oktoberfest (so, as one of my favorite styles it gains points for that). Malty, smooth... Biscuity, with a cracker finish. But a bit thin, lacking in carbonation, and underwhelming."
""
""
"A great representation of the style by an American brewer! The mouthfeel is a bit thin for my taste, but otherwise, this is a fine brew indeed."
""
""
""
""

"Overall this is a good Oktoberfest offering.  Pretty typical for the style, it did not blow me away but it is worth trying."

"I normally am not all too impressed with Saranac's offerings, but I really enjoyed this one. Honey (more so than caramel) was the dominant sense in both smell and taste. And with the taste, it was a warming honey biscuit. Very drinkable and enjoyable. I will probably get this again next year."
""
"O- My own mini-Oktoberfest consisted of a blind side-by-side-by-side tasting of Oktoberfests by Sam Adams, Saranac, and Dundee. Somewhat surprisingly, Saranac came in last. I'm not very well versed in Oktoberfests, but Saranac seemed to be a below average Oktoberfest and about average overall."

"O-not mouth filling flavorful but maybe because i am not experienced enough in octoberfest beers not sure. But compared to a few others i have had it's ok. If you are standing in the store right now reading this like i have in the past...check the next brand. If you are mixing a sixer...give it a whirl!"
"Overall: I’m disappointed in this beer. Not much going on at all, it’s just….there. I wouldn’t turn it away if offered, (and there wasn’t any other beers to drink), but I’m not looking for it either, in fact, I’m passing on this one next Oktoberfest."
"Saranac Octoberfest (2013) - Slightly faint floral aroma with a bit of coriander and bread. Excellent head retention and lacing. Very active small bubbles in the carbonation. Caramel color. Smooth mouthfeel. Muted lager hops on the nose. A little toast. Mid-palate gets a little bolder. Strong lager hops with muted floral undertones. Crisp and full but not overbearing. Strong floral hops notes on the back palate. Good breaded malt notes. A bit of nuts and wood. Aftertaste is good traditional German Lager. Light lingering citrus and pine notes. Not a particularly good Octoberfest-- a bit more hoppy and more lager notes than you would expect for variety. Normally more malty, but that's okay-- it's a good lager nevertheless and very drinkable. Pretty good overall. 3.4 out of 5."

"Overall: a very weak flavored oktoberfest beer that is easy to consume, but lacks the satisfaction expected from the style."
""
""

"Overall –An overall easy drinking, sweeter Oktoberfest. Rather tasty overall and not bad for the price."

"O - Not a whole lot going on, and I've certainly had better Marzen's, but this isn't a bad beer, and won't mind drinking it again. Doesn't have the sweetness than can damage some Marzens, and is crisp and clean like a regular Lager of Pilsener would be."
""
"Pours a clear light copper with two fingers of off-white head that retained for a long time and left nice lacing behind. The nose is malty and bready - typical for this style. Malt is definitely present in the flavor profile, but the body is a bit light for style. The finish is pleasantly dry. This offering is not excellent, but it is a pretty good effort."

"Copper amber color with decent head and moderate carbonation. Malty, fruity aroma. Bitter and very malty taste. Decent malt balance. Toasty, caramel malty aftertaste. An average octoberfest. Finishes slightly thinner than it started. Maybe a bit more malty than we'd like."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a nice light red orange with little head. Smells of dark roasted malt with slight hint of chocolate. Tastes of water and malt, a little weak but leaves a great aftertaste. Beer is very drinkable, light bodied, and good carbonation. Overall, an average beer."

"one of the classic fall beer of upstate new york. pours a redish amber browny color with a nice tall white head. the nose is sweet german malts and bready yeast, right on for the style. the flavor really features the malt, its quite bold, minerally, honey sweet. i feel like this is more authentic than many american versions. the finish is a touch too sweet i think, but the mouthfeel is awesome, more than medium body but remaining very drinkable due to the low abv and the powerful carbonation. works well in a lot of ways. its a great 6er to drink on a summer late fall day, and one that goes well with a lot of good autumnal cuisine. a very versatile brew, one of saranacs better seasonals."
""

"O: Excellent beer. For the price (just got a sixpak at $7.50) this is absolutely outstanding!"
""
""
""
""
"O- about an average Oktoberfest in terms if taste but very drinkable and sessionable."
"One of the better octoberfests I have tried. Good brew here."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed, orange-copper coloring with a thin, foamy white coating of head. Aromas of tangy caramel, roasted nut, hints of pumpkin, and some very light spicing. The nose lends itself more to the sweet side, a touch unbalanced. Flavors are a touch light, with a roasted grain and light toffee blending in the backbone, minimal spicing, and an overall watery mouthfeel. The finish has a touch of roast and pumpkin sweetness, but it also falls short on flavor and feel. I would not seek this one out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Nothing bad about it, but it didn't blow me away either."
"Clear amber colored with a beige sizzly head that settles out quickly. Sweetish aroma of doughey malt, some corn and cinnamon. Flavors fairly match the nose, plus a metallic note, some dried leaves, mild bitterness lingers. Dry and crisp mouthfeel, a bit slick with some carbonation sting. Decent beer overall."
"Clear, rusty copper color, little to no head. Scent leads with caramel malt and mineral water, some stale earthy hops. Taste is light and filled with notes of sweet caramel and residual sugar, light earthiness, little hops. Light bodied, moderately carbonated. A little too much sweet and not enough of anything else to be that good."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink but tastes rather watered down, especially when compared to some of the other maltier beers in the style."
""
""

"we all have our favorite octoberfest this isnt one of them , i tryed something diffrent and boy it bit my ass , the beer has too much head , too much foam , doesnt taste like auturm stay away from this beer if you have taste, if a poor man oto fest enjoy your favorite and dont try this one enjoy the fall beers"
""

"Overall, I really like this one. It's just so, so easy to drink, and has a refreshing, clean feel. It has a great spicy feel to it, but it's subtle."
"A straightforward Oktoberfest. Malt bill is raw and toasty, mild hops do their job, the yeast plays a part as well. Easy drinking but nothing to seek out. One of the better beers I've sampled from this brewery."
"The feel I'm not a huge fan of, not because it's too light (it's actually about medium-bodied), but because it's much too crisp and carbonated, being biting and overly fizzy. It calms down eventually, but the smoothness that follows is just enough."
"The flavors are very subtle, a good (but not great) Octoberfest."

"The palate leans strongly on the hops, particularly the earthy and dusty Tettnangs, lending both, a mild bitterness and moderate flavor. Moderate caramel and mild brown sugar characteristics are present. Drying on the finish with a lingering hop bitterness and a little burnt toast, this beer feels just a touch watery on the mid-palate. Carbonation is moderate. Apart from my quibble about the watery mouthfeel, I have no major complaints about this beer. None of the sulfur of the nose is present on the palate. In addition, the hops add an almost mineral note to the beer. Solid stuff from a brewery that I drank a LOT of in my earlier days."

"Overall: This octoberfest won't blow your mind by any means, but there's nothing wrong with simplicity from time to time. Decent flavor and very drinkable."

"O - Great, would buy again. Looks nice, and tastes nice. My first brew from this company and its a nice first impression."
"Overall- Honestly, I'm not sure what this beer may have tasted like, or if this is the beer as it was released. I really hope not, because it might as well be sold as an adjunct with how little flavor it has. It needs a much better mouth feel, not to mention a real boost in malt character to be a good example of a Maerzen."
"O: Something about the taste rubs me the wrong way. But, this beer looks phenomenal. I liked the Otter Creek better."
"Pours a beautiful dark amber with a half inch foamy off-white head. Slight lacing on the glass. Smell is sweet, slightly hoppy, with a faint aroma of citrus. Taste is also sweet and crisp. Very easy to drink. All in all, one of the better everyday octobefests."
"Notes: What this beer lacks in complexity is makes up for in sheer drinkability, it goes just as good with bratwurst and sauerkraut than any other Oktoberfest beer."
"Pours a clear orange, with an off-white head. Smell is tart hops and toffee. Taste is quite acrid, and nutty. Severish finish - hops are strong. Bit of cereal body, totally acceptable. Also, a chemical taste I can't quite figure out.."
"Overall this is a decent, sessionable beer, but it's not a great marzen. The flavors don't mesh and the flavor profile is a little too mild."
"This was a pleasant Oktoberfest from the good folks at Matt Brewing. It doesn’t quite hold up to others I’ve had like Flying Dog Dogtoberfest for example, but is certainly holds true to the style."
"The appearance is amber with slight hints of red and smell is in sync with the overall presentation of this beer. This beer has a nice smell that goes well with the taste. The surprise is the finish leaving a nice mouthfeel. Overall this is drinkable and well worth the trip. Will go nice with some old bay shrimp."
"From the 12 beers a fallin'. Been pleasantly surprised so far as the Saranac mixed packs don't get no respect. Poured from the bottle into my Geordie Schooner. Nice frothy head and copper amber color. Typical malty scent with just a touch of hops. Nice and bready. Paired with a sauerkraut dog. Nice complement. A good basic 'festbier."
"O - a really good one for a session or with a nice garlic chicken pizza like I had. thumbs up"
"Poured a light amber - orange color with minimal head that dissapeared in seconds. Scent is slightly floral.Taste is unexeptional,a touch too hoppy/bitter,(label says they use Saaz and Tettnang hops with two-row and Crystal malts. it's ok, but there are much better Octoberfest Marzens out there!"
"This Oktoberfest lager had a familiar appearance: copper-color with fluffy white head. It had a nice roasted malt flavor to it but a slight metallic aftertaste that wasn't bad but a slight mark against it. This isn't my favorite style but I enjoyed this one."
"Overall: One of the octoberfest beers I like to keep in stock. This one came out of the 12 beers a falling Saranac variety pack."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I recently read a Lew Bryson review for this beer, and he got my hopes up a bit. It's good, but it doesn't hold up to the Great Lakes version, or even the Sam Adams for that matter."
"O-I will be having it again soon as apart of an Oktoberfest tasting so I'll see how it stacks up against some others, but it seemed bland and lacking."
"Overall - I'm a big fan of Marzen/Octoberfest beers. This one is just ok. Easy to drink, but offers very little excitement in the taste."
"Easy to drink and for what it's priced at, definitely worth a try."
"Overall not bad, a bit too much on the amber reddish american malt profile but gets some of the toasty cereal malts right, light hops are nice but not really right for the style. Sweetness is right, drinkable."
"D: Less heart and hefty than many US versions. Not that is misses the style at all, it is just a lighter, and perhaps slightly hoppy, take on a classic. Plenty enough drinkable though."
"My pour generated two fingers of tawny head with very good retention. Color was a deep copper with NE-quality clarity. BUPGOO! Nose had a biscuity malt quality underlain by a soft grassy hoppiness. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was more grassy than malty on the tongue. The finish continued to have a more bitter than sweet quality, which was not necessarily to my liking. I think that there are better examples of the style available."
"D- not too shabby but seems a bit lacking in some ways. Again, more akin to German versions than our super sweeties i.e. Sam Adams, great lakes, thirsty dog."
"Pours a nice clear chestnut amber color with a 1 finger head that slides to a thin lace on the edge of the glass. Smells of a good malty backbone, hints of caramel, and a nice touch of spice. The taste is of nice blended malts, sweet caramel, spices clove and ginger a touch metallic on the finish. Light on the feel, nice fresh, watery lager. Very drinkable, good price, good choice for a Marzen."
"Many Oktoberfest's on the market and this one was deceny but not near the elite."
"From fall brew tasting notes (2010): The aroma is hardly noticeable, consisting mostly of spruce and citrus. Its golden amber appearance is standard for a lager, but a bit on the light side for an Octoberfest. Minimal head. The taste is interesting: light sweetness, medium bitterness, and lightly sour. It has a crisp palate, with a thin texture and lively carbonation. The finish is clean and abrupt. Decent beer for the category."
"D= rather drinkable. Would probably go nicely with any gravy meal (chicken, beef, pork, turkey)."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability isn't bad, it's a decent beer overall. It just wasn't anything that stood out in the style for me."
"D: A no-frills marzen but not a bad offering from Saranac. They have seemed to take measures not to screw up too basic of a brew and its 5.4% ABV puts it right in line with many German marzens and basic domestic fest beers. It's pretty solid, if not boring."
"The Moment: More baseball/football watching--the best time for this sports fan... Glassware: Saranac willibecker... Appearance: Strong, autumnal orange/brown body that suggests malt and more malts--thin white head that is a bit inconsistent... Aroma: sweet, crips malt as promised; doughy accents prohibit a higher mark for aroma... Palate: medium-bodied with a late fizziness; otherwise, flat and lacking a strong mouthfeel... Taste: a bit flat, delivered with the quality of a cola; monolithic in its delivery of malt; the malts themselves taste slightly roasted and stay true to their aroma... Overall: This ""limited release"" is a serviceable sessioner--and I am a fool for an Oktoberfest ANYTHING--and yet, imperfect hints of metal ping at certain points taper my enthusiasm; truth be told, I bought a case and have not been disappointed in reaching for a pair or three per night the past few weekends..."
"drinkability: a lighter take on the Märzen style with some pleasant typical lager attributes, pleasant to drink."
"Drinkability: Not a favorite of mine, but for the QPR this is tasty and a decent domestic version of the style, and maybe one of Saranac's better brews."
"Poured at 40 degrees F into standard American pint glass. Pours a clear orange-gold, less than a 1-finger egg-white head, almost no lacing. The first ingredient in the aroma is cinnamon, just like when you put cinnamon in a homebrew. Other than that, some sweet autumn-malts. Taste didn't sit well with me. Way too bready, and the bitterness is not the kind of bittering hops we all know and love. This bitterness combines with the carbonation and destroys the roof of my mouth. The taste of cinnamon doesn't carry over heavily. It leaves a sticky, undesirable stale malt flavor on the palate. I would not recommend this as a session beer. However, Saranac has other good brews, so don't turn down the company immediately."
"D: Very drinkable; goes down real easy. Smooth and balanced while fairly flavorful."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. Pours a translucent copper with a 2.5 inch, fluffy, cream-colored head. Head eventually settles into a solid, quarter inch cap with sticky strands of lacing present during the tasting. Aromas are very light; however, there seems to be a trace of citrus, caramel malt and a slightly skunky quality. Taste follows nose - skunk is less dominant and the malty character expresses itself a bit more; however, there is also a slight metallic character that manifests itself towards the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to the light side of the spectrum), with a lively, almost fizzy, carbonation. Not a bad Marzen, perhaps a little too much carbonation, and some slightly off-putting flavors, but drinkability actually isn't all that bad."
"Pours a amber-copper color with an off white head. A good few fingers of head at first, though this drops down rather quickly without leaving too much lace behind. The nose is a bit of caramel malt and bread as well as some light hop notes. The taste is mostly some caramel and bread and not too much else. Medium body with good carbonation. Fairly plain, but still tasty."
"Pours a lighter amber than most oktoberfests. Nice white head, but below average lacing and decent retention. Complex aroma. Caramel, wheat, floral and citrus hop aroma with a bit of alcohol as well. Taste starts with a hint of sweet caramel/toffee malt and also some citrus and floral hops. Hoppier than more oktoberfests. A little grass and wheat flavor in there as well. Nothing too strong about the flavor and even a bit watery. Light bodied."
"Easy drinking brew that I could session with food easily..."
"The malts profile is fairly basic. Not the most complex beer out there. Light sweetness noted, but the aftertaste is bitter and reminds me of veggies. I've had better balanced festbiers for sure. Mouthfeel is a little on the spritzy side. Smooth this one out a bit more. It's not bad for the price, but probably the least enjoyable of the style I've had this year."
"Pairing: Best pairing with food so far was with a beef stew. It matched the heaviness of the stew and mixture of the vegetable aftertaste with the beer elevated the overall dinner experience."
"The pour is a clear copper with a medium white head. The aroma is very bready, sweet, little grassy. The flavor is pretty standard marzen, bready and sweet with ligth hoppy finish. Medium to full body, average carbonation. A standard marzen, decent session type brew."
"A little lighter than I am used to with this style, but very nice over all. Not terribly complex, but nicely done."
"Drink - there is nothing special here, an average beer that is fine to drink 1 of every October."
"Pretty good. Not great, but meets the standard. Can't beat the price(at least for this sample pack). A worthy beer from a so-far worthy brewery."
"The smell is crisp and fresh and I felt like drinking a nice mouthful right away. It has a nice light body and great balance. You will taste the slight bitterness of german hops after you let the beer linger in your mouth, which adds to the value of this very drinkable seasonal brew, just like it is meant to be for the celebration of the Oktoberfest, where the masses enjoy a few good liters of fine beer."
"D - Medium drinkability on this. It's a good beer but nothing would make me want a whole lot more."
"Decent body and pretty smooth feel, with minimal carbonation. A good easy drinker but different than I expected. Still not bad for a change."
"mouthfeel syrupy"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark golden color with a small head. Smell is mild, some malts. Taste is also mild, malts with some hints of hops, a slight bitterness at the finish. Not bad but nothing special. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a decent brew."
"D. I probably won't be buying this again. Sam Adams Octoberfest is much better."
"D: Quite nice. A good Octoberfest, worth a try."
"D - Pretty high, this Octoberfest does not disappoint."
"This is a great beer from a great brewery. Who would have guessed that F.X. Matt would be putting out such high quality craft beers just a couple of decades after Utica Club was the swill of the masses? As usual, Saranac delivers an excellent beer at a low price - $5.76 per sixer here in Maryland, over 300 miles from the brewery. Not too shabby."
"D: It is not offensive in any way it just misses in almost every area. The color is not bad. Sure it drinks easy but there are so many better examples of the style out there."
"Pours golden amber with a touch of foam that recedes into just a few wisps. Touch of lacing. Malty smell, notes of caramel. Rich malty taste, lots of barley in there. Crisp tartness snaps at the finish. Buried hop veer so slight. Creamy-ish. Very nice, keep drinking."
"Pours a clear copper with with a small head and a fair amount of carbonation active throughout the body. Big toasty notes with lighter notes forest soil and a dash of caramel of honey. Taste is mainly toasty, with a long, toffee finish that is tasty but quite simple. Not a bad beer, but far from great and far from being the best of the bargain price Oktoberfests."
"It's an average oktoberfest, no more and no less. Nothing really jumps out here, and nothing offends. Drinkable."
"Sampled on September 3, 21010. The pour is mostly amber in tone with good clarity and about a half-inch of foamy off-white head. Caramel malts lead the aroma with a little light yeast in the background. The caramel malts are stron on with a likeable mellow hoppiness. It reminded me of an Octoberfest but there are better ones out there."
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable"
"D: I'm not a big fan of Saranac, but this beer was suprisingly decent. Not the best Marzen by any means, but very drinkable. And considering the price, this beer is a great value."
"D - Interesting cross between a classic german marzen and the sweeter, caramel flavored marzen typical of American breweries."
"To my surprise it wasnt terrible. Just ordinary. A pale, clear orange beer. Balanced taste and nose. The best part is that it is quite easy to drink."
"Clear orange-tan brew with 1"" of rocky eggshell head that settles slowly and generates decent lace. Nose is thick malty biscuit, raw grains, and a smooth blend of (in order of decreasing intensity) caramel, honey, grass, pine, vanilla, grapefruit. Taste follows directly from the nose, with a finish of mixed hops (mostly lemon), butterscotch, and some fruity esters. Mouthfeel is pretty thin with abundant soft carbonation, could definitely use more body. Overall a pretty decent marzen."
"d: a good session beer but not amazing by any standards; might be good to convert your friend who only drink miller light to try some other micros"
"Pours to a medium amber brown with a nice head that doesn't go away to quickly. It coats the glass well. Aroma is of hops with a sweet note hidden in the background. Pleasantly bitter and smooth finish. Not a lot of aftertaste. This is a light-medium bodied Maerzen. It isn't too creamy like some other examples."
"Serving type: 12oz bottle purchased non-refrigerated on 12/7/2009"
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, very enjoyable. Will have another!"
"Poured a clear light orange/copperish body with good head that died quickly. Faint smell of malts and a little herbal hop bitterness. Lighter-bodied and goes down easy, wiht some minor sweetness and roasted malt presence along with a citric, herbal hop bitterness on the backend. A rather simple beer that is light in both malts and hops but an easy drinker and not bad to have."
"From 12 ounce bottle into a Unibroue tulip. 1 finger of foam quickly dissipates and lacing is soapy and white. Aroma is a nice balance of hops and sweet malts with some spices, with sweetness dominating. Taste is also pretty sweet with some spice and dark fruits, especially upon warming. Easy to drink and pretty tasty."
"Drinkability is relatively high. Kind of an average beer, worth a look if you are into Marzen, otherwise don't worry about it."
"Incidentally, Saranac is a fine brewer that can and does produce some ""quality"" beer. (See my review of their Imperial Stout.) Unfortunately, their Oktoberfest is not one of them. How would the Germans say ""meh?"""
"Pours a copper color and a small yet respectable white head. As the beer head settles a little lace is left behind. The beer has a good aroma, hops with a bit of malt in it and a few spices, maybe some caramel. It has a full body but more syrupy that I expect in a ocktoberfest but at the same time it goes down easily. I think I could drink a number of these without complaint. The flavor is malt an hops. There are certainly some toasted grains in there, and maybe a hint of spices. Not much in the way of hops, but there is a slight lingering. Over all not a bad rendering."
"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into a normal pint glass. The beer has a pretty copper color and a small but respectable white head made of small bubbles. As the head is settling a little bit of lace is left behind. The beer has a pleasant aroma; there seems to be a bit of malt in it and a few spices, but nothing that I can definitely identify. The thing that strikes me first as I taste the beer is it's full body. It's more syrupy that I expected, but at the same time it goes down easily. I think I could drink a number of these without complaint. The flavor is more malt than hops. There are certainly some toasted grains in there, and maybe a hint of spices. Not much in the way of hops, but there is a slight lingering bitterness that is enjoyable."
"The beer just wasn't a very drinkable beer for me."
"Very light on the palate, not overly sweet, with medium carbonation. This is a wonderfully balanced and drinkable beer. I'll definitely be picking up some more of this soon."
"most impressive where it counts. love the toasty-yeasty notes as this slightly warms up on this rainy, windy, cool 40 degree day in PA"
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into my standard shaker glass. The marzen appears a hazed muted amber color with about a finger of fluffy light tan foam. Nose and flavors consist of toasted bread and cereal grains, green apples, pears, sweet biscuits, caramel malt. Medium in both body and carbonation. Pretty decent and accessible as well."
"D..A very good Oktoberfest beer to drink. Smooth from the bottle or glass. This is certainly one of the best American Oktoberfest brews I have had. Disappointed I only found one six pack, but happy to have enjoyed what I bought and looking forward to more whenever possible."
"Wow! Pretty nice. In a climate where a lot of German Oktoberfests have been dumbed down to the point of being just malty golden lagers, and many American brewers use too heavy of a hand with the malts, Matt has kept theirs balanced, and to style. Very nicely drinkable! One of the better examples I've tasted this year."
"cheers"
"Overall, this is an okay Octoberfest. I am being kind of harsh on the ratings, but there just isn't enough here to warrant a purchase. Nothing even a beer nood hasn't seen before. A pretty main stream beer. Not the worst Octoberfest you could buy, but definetly not the best."
"I remember having this a couple of years ago so I picked up another six pack this year, not quite as good as I remember, I drank about 3 of the 6 pack before I reviewed it just in case I happened to get a bad beer, but my review stays pretty consistent. Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass, has a fizzy head to it that goes away very quickly, little lacing at first, then it goes away completely. Smell is very good. Has a very clean smell to it, mostly malts. The taste is again a very clean taste, dominated by mostly malts, a little bit of roasted taste as well. It doesn't finish all that well, almost a little bland, but I'd still say it's an above average taste based on the initial taste. The mouthfeel is good, a little too carbonated, not quite the characteristic of an Octoberfest. The drinkability is very good, one of the more refreshing Octoberfests I've had. This is overall one of the more lighter looking and tasting Octoberfests I've tried, but not bad. I'd recommend it more on a warmer fall day than a cool one, but don't avoid it just cause it's lighter."
"D- A decent brew but not my favorite of the style."
"Saranac Octoberfest is a sparkling, crystal clear amber lager with a pillowy, foamy off-white head that has excellent retention and lacing. It has a faint, wooden, herbal scent and the malt smells bready and pretzely. It seems a little funky. It is medium bodied, smooth and dry with a very dry and chalky finish. It has a light wooden, botanical bitterness that's well balanced with the sour dough pretzel flavor. It's a sufficient oktoberfest."
"D- Easy. I can see where it might be perceived as a little watered down, again, i could definitely have a few"
"Drinkability - very drinkable really good beer just a little watery."
"A sweetish/bitterish smell, but nice. Taste is terrific. Mellow and smooth, lots of flavor. Sharp mouthfeel, and coats the mouth and makes the next sip easier. Overall, nice. I would drink this all day. And I will at Maddhopper's Oktoberfest!"
"Drinkability: Overall, not bad for the style. A bit of sweetness, nice crisp mouthfeel, and easy drinking. There are better Marzens out there, but this one isn't bad."
"Very toasty, smooth and complex. It's got a nice carbonation and flavor. This is the best Oktoberfest beer I've had since Otter Creek Oktoberfest."
"D- As I said before it is okay but there are many other Oktoberfest to enjoy during this season."
"Part of an Saranac Autumn sampler. There were better beers in the 12 pack. This beer was an amber color with a medium-sized white head. Aroma was lacking, just some vague spice. Cinnamon and clove in the taste, just the tiniest bit of caramel. Mouthfeel was warming from the spice, not quite pleasant. Two and done for me."
"Overall a decent Oktoberfest, cheap in my area, but there are many better representations out there. Worth a try! I still prefer the Sam Adams version..."
"D. Definatly a session beer. I could drink a few of these on a chilly october evening. Reminds me of autumn."
"Overall a very solid offering but again nothing really spectacular. I would not mind having it again, but what would be the point."
"Pours amber color with thin off-white head which dissapeared quickly. Smell - very malty and bready. Quite nice. Taste - yeasty, malty, bready. A bit sweet. Rich and smooth, almost creamy. Good sessional beer. Drinkable. Would definately have this again"
"Mouthfeel is perfect, grainy malt, very little carbonation. Check it out."
"PS- I dig the Bavarian flag label scheme."
"Out of a bottle this beer produced a one-finger, sandy-white head atop the orange/amber fluid. There was lots of rising carbonation, decent retention of the head and good lacing in thin bands. The aroma was soft, dry grains and toasted malt. The flavors were good but the aftertaste odd. It started with hop bitterness before some biscuity malt added balance. It then became very dry and grainy but the aftertaste was stale/off. The mouthfeel was smooth, the carbonation good and the body medium. It was still a good example of the style and enjoyable enough."
"6/4/6/3/12 (3.1/5)"
"A decent Oktoberfest beer that goes down very easily."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was a dark mahogany color. I had a big rich tan looking head that was inviting for sure. The brown fuzz oozed a malty smell that was a hard on coming for the taste buds. The taste was malty and sweet but not too much. This was a great beer and I will buy again."
"I generally think that Matts does a better than average job with most styles. This is no exception. Is there better, yes, but for the price and for the consistancy, these guys do it very well."
"This poured a clear amber with off-white head. It smelled like lemon hops and wild yeast with copper hops and some earthy caramel malt. It tasted like dry earthy barley malt, and copper and lime hops with sour yeast. It was watery with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this didn't have the best flavor, and it wasn't terribly clean either. The body was OK, but this beer just wasn't enjoyable enough to make we want to finish it. It's only really drinkable as a 2nd or 3rd beer of the night."
"Average Oktoberfest but very easy to drink. Worth a try."
"Drinkability: Not bad. A nice balanced malt profile - perhaps a little dry - but interesting enough that I didn't get too bored. It's a little too overcarbonated, which sort of shoves the malt astringencies down your face, but it's not a bad beer at all. Give it a shot."
"Pours a clear orange/gold color with a thin off white head with little lacing. Toasted malt and lemony hop aromas. Grainy, biscuity malt flavor up front followed by spicy, lemon hops that last into the finish. Medium body and carbonation, creamy mouthfeel with a very dry spicy finish. Easy drinking but the hop bitterness outweighs the malt, not keeping with the style."
"The bottle is ugly though :P"
"D: Not the best fest beer around, but pretty darn drinkable."
"Not very good in my opinion. The taste is quite unpleasant."
"It does look nice, though!"
"D: A very drinkable marzen from Saranac which isn't a bad value. Allow it to warm a few minutes and it's pretty enjoyable."
"D: This is an easy drinker, but part of the reason is that there just isn't much about this beer that makes you sit up and take notice."
"Bottle poured a clear copper with a small disapating white head. Aromas of straw, light caramel and light spice. Palate was light to medium bodied and crisp. Flavors of carmel, light straw and spicy hops with a crisp malty finish. Definitely on the lower end of the Oktoberfests I've ever had."
"Drinkability: I wasn't to impressed with this one. The earthiness of the taste wasn't done well, and I especially disliked the acidity this beer had in my mouth. Not an awful brew, but I don't think I'd buy this again. There are much better Octoberfest beers out there."
"Drinkability is moderate. It's fairly easy to consume, but boring and nowhere near the best Oktoberfest I've had. Not really doin it for me."
"Notes: Overall it's a solid yet safe Oktoberfest beer."
"Drinkability is good. One of the better Oktoberfest's I've had this year. Went down pretty well and I could do another or two. Not a bad seasonal by far, I'll probably grab a 6'er but this isn't something I could drink all year."
"A rather drinkable beer, but much more akin in flavor to an APA than a Märzen. If this had been brewed with a top-fermenting yeast, it'd make a decent pale ale, but it lacks the slight caramel sweetness of a good Oktoberfest."
"Pours amber with a nice, solid dense head that falls to good lacing. The aroma is strongly malty, biscuity, and dry. The flavor is malty, a bit orange citrusy, with a little spice burn at the back and a dry finish. The mouthfeel is a bit weak, for the style, but there is a little tingle of carbonation that brings out the spiciness."
"A nice, solid little octoberfest. Better than the average Octoberfest, as I've been trying a lot lately and it's definitely not one of the best, but better than a lot of the others. Pours a boring yellowish-red color, but has a nice malty smell and taste. The mouthfeel are carbonation is excellent so this makes the drinkability high. Good offering from Saranac."
"D: In a word: Highly."
"D - Although it's not all that well balanced and doesn't provide the malt I'm looking for in a marzen, it is fairly drinkable due to it's unoffensive nature."
"Bottle/Artwork - Standard Saranac bottle with the exception of the blue and white diamond check pattern..."
"The beer poured a translucent copper/amber with a thin tan head. The aroma was malty with a hint of spicy hops. The taste was malty with a little caramel and toffee with a spicy hop finish. A little on the thin side but very drinkable. I have had better Oktoberfests but for $5.99/six, this one hits the mark."
"D: Not among the better Oktoberfests that I've tried, but not too bad. Worth a try, and it's certainly not a drain pour."
"Brown-amber color, medium off-white head and some lacing. Semi-sweet aroma with a blend of hops and malt. The flavor was very well balanced including light malt, spices, brown sugar and a little hop bitterness. I recommend this one, it's a good drink."
"Maybe I am not sure about the rating system here but C means average. Is this an above average beer?"
"Not bad..."
"A good, but not outstanding O-fest. Flavor is mild and pleasant. Worth a try."
"My local beer distributor still has several cases of this lying around and when it went on sale I decided to give it a go. I am familiar with Saranac products and they rarely disappoint. This beer has a nice amber color and drinks smooth. Taste is a little caramel and dash of hops, similar to a watered down version of Sam Adams. Overall a very good Octoberfest, but could have a little more flavor. Great price. $19.00 (case)."
"My friend The Sage recommended this as we sampled some Saranac wares. Not bad, and better than others I've tried from Saranac, to be sure. Two fingers of off-white cap on an orange-ruby body, nicely done. The smell is a bit weak, unfortunately, with some spice and bready yeast kicking around, but not nearly enough. The taste isn't bad at all--smooth, a bit of ginger and cinnamon, caramel sweetness--making the smell all the more disappointing for what it didn't indicate. This flattens out somewhat early, dragging down the drinkability a notch. Yet this is on the whole fairly good Oktoberfest, not a top-of-the-line beer but not bad at all."
"This beer seems to be one that is much better with food than on its own. Anything with salt helps to cut some the bitterness of the beer. Cheese, pretzels, or a full meal, and this becomes a drinkable beer. By itself, I'd prefer one of Saranac's High Peak's series instead."
"D- Overall an ok beer, certainly better than the Adirondack lager, if only in complexity, but not the most balanced beer."
" While the thin body might enable you to drink more of these than some other oktoberfest beers, I believe that the lack of flavor would inhibit me from wanting to. Overall I found this beer to be very average."
"Drinkability- This beer does not represent this style of beer well."
"I know it is late in the season to be reviewing an Octoberfest but I had it and is one of the only brews from Saranac I have not reviewed. This brew poured to a copper color with a very small light tan head that did not have much retention but did leave a little lacing. Te aromas seem to be mostly toasted malts with some caramel highlights The flavors are fair, would say it does not compare to Sam Adams version, just comparing it to it since it is the most readily available here and just a quick/easy standby. Caramel and Roasted flavors come out but also has a little odd aftertaste that I have never really been overly keen to. This is a brew I always have just because it seems that every fall people have it in their fridges. Many better Octoberfests available but for the price point it is not to bad."
"D: Not very tasty, doesnt go down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, poor representation of style, there would have to be a very limited array of choice available for me to select this beer again and I certainly would not recommend it to anyone."
"The light body on this makes for easy drinking but I just wish there was more that excited me in the aroma and taste department. There's just too many other O-Fests out there that I'd rather spend my time and money on."
"drinkability - Not a bad beer, had better octoberfest beers, but wanted to try it."
"A very mediocre Octoberfest beer if there ever was one. It pours a nice amber with some head and retention. The smell is sweet malts and caramel. This is a medium bodied, low carbonation lager with a flat, caramel, almost what I call a cola syrup taste that is just not that enticing. There is a sharp bite to this beer that makes no sense and I'm not certain where it comes from. The mouthfeel is a bit watery but okay, the aftertaste has that bite again. This is a one and done for me. You can do better in seeking out other beers of this style."
"Saranac Octoberfest was amber in color with a white head. The head was small, but had good retention and left some lacing behind. The aroma was caramel malt, lightly toasty with some hops. The taste was toasted and caramel malt with some hop bitterness to balance. The finish was dry and a little bitter. It was just less than medium in body with good carbonation. Drinkability was good. It's a decent Oktoberfest, but not the best that I've tried."
"Okay for what it's worth, but there are lots of better out there. Wouldn't get again."
"A middle of the road Oktoberfest for this season that may be better in a draft version."
"Light bodied and smooth with a touch of grainyness. Easy to drink,just barely enough taste to be sessionable. Typical Saranac,decent beer,but not too exciting,but very drinkable."
"Not Saranac's best beer, but it is definitely another solid beer from a fantastic brewery."
"Drinkability: This looks to be the last new Oktoberfest beer I'll have for the season. Bummer."
"This is a fine modern Oktoberfest that is very easy to session."
"D: A fairly drinkable beer. Smooth and crisp taste makes it nice and easy to drink."
"Pours a light copper color with an average off-white head that dissipated into a small cap. The smell is of caramel malt and light spicy hops. This marzen starts of sweet with the caramel malt but is quickly offset by spicy and somewhat bitter/metallic hops. The malt has some toasted qualities to it. The feel is moderate and well carbonated and finished a tad on the bitter side. A fairly clean and refreshing brew, probably one of the better Saranac offering that I have had."
"pours a bright copper color with a large off white head that holds up well and a fair amount of lacing. floral aromas with a slight hop and spice there also. bready malt taste with a citrus lemon turning to a slightly bitter grapefruit hop finish. mouthfeel is light and carbonation is crisp. not bad but not my first choice."
"I'm not much for Oktoberfests, but this is one of the better ones I've had in a while. If I'm in the Upstate area again, I'll give it another go."
"This poured a pale amber, with some head. I found this to be more pale than other Oktoberfest beers I've had in the past. Smell is abundantly malty, with some hops. This is also reflected in the flavor as well. Hops and malt are present. It goes down quite easily, relatively smooth. Overall I'd say this is a pretty solid brew. Nice session beer."
"edit 9/10/08: This years offering seems a bit thicker than last years and not as dry..."
"D: Very drinkable - could put a couple of these down pretty easily."
"One of the better Octoberfests in my opinion."
"Notes: This one is not too shaby it is certainly a solid year round beer.Cheers"
"D - I had a hard time finishing the one glass, so I just 'pounded it' ."
"Pours with a minor, white head that goes quickly and leaves no lace. Clear light, amber color, starts malty, finishes smooth and hoppy/malty. Nose is sweet and malty. Good carbonation. Light bodied not heavy at all as some reviewers have mentioned. Not as rich as the brewer claims. The ABV is 5.3%."
"Still, Saranac is a good introduction to craft beer for the macro drinkers."
"it had a heineken kind of skunk smell and taste to it. kind of strange. almost clear brown in color. the moutfeel was kind of thick and the flavor very middle of the road. not bad, just exactly what i have come to expect from saranac. very hit or miss, some beers are fairly solid and others are better suited for cooking."
"D: Very high. Very tasty and easy drinking."
"Very inviting and drinkable. This would be a great beer to introduce to macro-swilling friends."
"D - I'll probably say it in every Saranac review, but they all seem to resemble each other...but as far as this goes, it was enjoyable. Wouldn't seek out again - more of a 'hit-the-spot' seasonal."
" Decent nose with caramel and familiar sweet two row malts to accompany an appropriately Marzen color, head, and lacing. Head and overall mouthfeel both possessed an otstanding creaminess I haven't seen in other Saranac beers. Taste has a brief hoppy kick at the end of the sip along with the sweet, nutty malt notes. Nicely dry and clean in the finish. Not a terrible beer, just not awesome among available other Oktoberfest beers."
"Overall a very drinkable Octoberfest. Not overly sweet. Very sessionable and something to look forward to as the days get shorter."
"M&D - smooth and easily drinkable, more complex in the taste than in the aroma, a decent O-fest, especially for an American one"
"Thanks Jimi for another brew experience."
"D - This is one of the better offerings from Saranac. I found this one much more enjoyable than previous years."
"If I were to review this beer based on the first couple of sips it would be much lower than what I'm giving them currently. This beer actually significantly improved as it warmed. Initially it had a very astringent diacetyl that shrouded all other flavors. That actually dissipated as I drank on. A more appropriate malt laden sweetness that Marzens should have came through as time passed. Mouthfeel was a little off as well as it seemed a little grainy and foamy. I don't think spoilage plays into it, but I did get the beer in South Carolina which is a ways from NY state. Overall not bad, but certainly not great. There are much better options for the Octoberfest fans."
"I had another 4-4-2007 and it held up nice real solid Marzen. IMO"
"Very easy drinking. A smooth, refreshing ""session"" brew. Good to have another fresh lager O-fest. Not that the amber ales that are released as O-fest seasonals are all that bad at all - but, nice to have a smooth, fresh beer that fits the style well. This is a nice traditional O-fests from the American craft industry, especially where body and drinkability are concerned."
"Overall: While not my favorite, it is a decent interpretation of the style. I got a sixer for $5.99, and at that price it's a bargain. (The same store sells Paulaner and Spaten Oktoberfests for over $10 a six-pack.) This one is definitely worth picking up if you're a fan of the style, and even if you're not go for it."
"I like this beer, and would definitely drink it again, especially considering the price, but it's not what I have in mind when considering the Oktoberfest style."
"I gotta admit, this was better than I was expecting. Rather true to the style and when the price is factored in it becomes even more attractive."
"All in all I think this is typical for Saranac in a couple ways: (1) it's a decent beer for the price (I paid $9.99 for a 12-pack); (2) it's a solid version of the style, just nothing special; and (3) the hops seem to have a certain ""Saranac"" flavor to them, even where they're Saaz and Tettnang rather than what they use in their Pale Ale and IPA. I bought this 12-pack to bring to a party, and it served its purpose well. Even so, I probably won't buy it again this season."
"This one is ok, but just ok. I think it has been better in recent years. Not really on style in my opinion; not very malty with little bread aroma. Also, a bit hoppier than I think an O'fest should be, and pretty thin. With that said, worth a try; but I will not be buying anymore this season."
"Drinkability: Excellent for sessions. Well-balanced and not too highly alcoholic."
"I would not say this beer is worth a try. It tastes like a marginal import thats popular with people that drink whatever beer they think is cool. That said, it has a light body with an almost skunky aroma. Taste is starts with overly sweet caramel followed by nice hops flavor with is then ruined by a sour skunk flavor. It wasn't bad at first, but the aftertaste is rotten. What a shame."
"Cheers!"
"Overall- A decent Octoberfest that would be an easy session beer. Worth a try!"
"Overall, it was an okay beer but not malty enough for me. I would drink it again if offered, but I probably wouldn't buy it again."
"This seems a very drinkable lager. Nothing to overwhelming or underwhelming."
"Pours deep golden with orange hue. One finger head with good retention,and lacing. Smell is malty, and the body is light to medium and carbonated. Taste is toasted, and malty up front, with a dry, bitter finish. As for most of the Saranac products, good but not great. Still, worth a try this fall."
"Pours a crystal clear golden orange. Dense one and a half finger head, shows excellent retention with a sticky patchwork of lacing. Saaz and tettanger nose, some mild toasty malts in the background. Sweet Munich/Vienna toasted malt meets with a crushing noble hop flavor. Dry aftertaste, plenty of bitterness, and monsterous floral saaz and spicy tettanger flavor. Medium bodied and high in carbonation, the mouthfeel is crisp, but has a dextrinous, rich texture. Nutty and toasted at first, but near the finish the german hops overpower what should be a malty beer. Despite this imbalance, it remains both very drinkable with lots of characterictic german malt and hop flavor."
"D: It's a solid stab at the style, sure. There's a nice aroma, and the maltiness is nice. But the finish isn't that great, and detracts from the beer. It was oh-so-close, but the taste was a bit off the mark."
"*Overall Impressions* while this beer is highly drinkable and quite agreeable, it is also rather dull for an Octoberfest, which is a boring style to begin with. Overall, a good beer...but nothing to go bonkers about"
"The beer poured a translucent amber with a tan head. The aroma was of floral hops over malt. The taste was malt with a little caramel and a floral hop finish. The feel was medium bodied and dry. A nice Marzan, but no knockout here. A beer I wouldn't turn down, but next Oktober I'll probably sample a six of someone elses."
"Not a bad Oktoberfest brew. Poured out to an appropriate dark orange color with a small white head and some notes of lace. A medium low level of carbonation was noted. Aromas of malt, hops and almost pickle like vinegar was detected. Flavor was average; some roasted malt and bread elements, but nothing special. Mouthfeel is average, slightly creamy and smooth. Drinkability is pretty good. This would be best with some pretzels and brats. Worth a try."
"The carbonation is slighty fizzy and tickles my palate. Overall the beer is easy to drink and not overly complex. A decent example of the style and a good beer to have quite a few of on a nice fall day!"
"An OK Oktoberfest but there are many better. Needs a bit more complexity and depth, I wouldn't seek this out but I could drink this if it was the best option available."
"Orange-tan with tiny head that fell to nothing quickly. Smell is a pleasing mild toasty malt. Taste is similar. Pleasing and mild, very little hoppiness and the malt is subdued. Mouthfeel is medium thin. This is a very easy drinker. Priced cheaply enough to make it a reasonable purchase for a gathering, but there are much better Octoberfests out there."
"Eh, I'd drink it again, but nothing mindboggling. This is signature Saranac ... was another malty lagerish safe beer necessary?"
"Not bad at all for the price - $4.99 at Wegman's. Smart alternative to any macro this time of year but a bit below the other seasonals I've tasted this year - Sam Adams and Brooklyn."
"Poured a short-lived cream colored head that left a few strings of lace. Brilliant copper colored beer with streams of fine bubbles rising along the edges. Sharp, barely sweet malt aroma that has a strange note chicken noodle soup. Faintly sweet caramal malt mixed with grassy hops. A pinch of bitterness and copper in the finish. Moderately light body is fairly. Not a very good beer. Strange aromas and hops that taste almost vegetal hide what would be a crisp refreshing malty beer."
"Pours a medium amber with a 1 finger head and OK lace. Weak aroma for a Oktoberfest. Some slight malt and hop aromas - typical stuff. Its flavor is more of a weak APA and not a oktoberfest. Its more hoppy than malty, I score it low on taste not based on that its a bad beer, it just does not reflect the style well - its too hoppy for an oktoberfest. Good drinkability though. Again its not a bad beer it just does not represent the style - in my opinion."
"Overall-a subdued but decent version of an Octoberfest from Saranac, they always hit the style well and this is no exception. This beer is right at home with other Octoberfest entries."
"Pours a clear amber color. The head is a small lace but stays for the life of the beer. Has a roasted malt aroma and a slight hop bitterness. The flavor is roasted malt up front and is balance out with a spicy hop. The saaz hops stand out the most in the slighty bitter finish. This is an all around no frills Oktoberfest lager. The drinkability is almost perfect!"
"Deep orange in color. A tad darker then some of the other fest beers. Low aroma. Somewhat sharp and metallic. Smells like the underside of the bottle cap. Good, failry clean malty flavor. Nice sweetness in the finish. Very nice mouthfeel-holds up well overall. A very drinkable beer. Quite enjoyable and more moderately priced then a lot of the other micro fests out there."
"Prosit!"
"Mouth feel is light bodied and goes down easy, though I dont think I will be seeking this one out again."
"First Octoberfest of the season, and it's not even September yet. I couldn't wait... let's see how this one stacks up. Pours a very fallish looking deep amber color, with a decent head that seems to be fading quickly. Nice clarity. Smell isn't really getting me overly excited. Sort of withdrawn malt scent, faint nutty smell and some grainy hints. Hmmm. Taste isn't really what I've come to expect from an Octoberfest. A little bland overall. A subtle (maybe too subtle) nutty characteristic meshes well with a slight toffee taste, but I can't tell how much of that I'm just imagining because I've been craving a good O-fest and this is the only thing I could get my hands on out here in western New York. Mainly it's just your average lager, only a little sweeter. Maybe even some corn tastes in there, and sort of reminds me of malt liquor or something. Not the best. I can't wait next week when I'll be back in Boston, hopefully there's some better selection out there, like BBC. But one thing is for sure, the O-fests are starting to come out, and that's a great thing. Mmmm."
"poured a crystal clear copper copper with moderate white head. Smell is mainly of toasted malt with caramel noted. Taste is malty, with caramel and bread found. Finished sweet and malty, but nothing that really impresses. An OK beer at best. I'm glad I only bought one of these."
"I wouldn't go back to this one. It was very humdrum."
"Light brown color with a subtle hop aroma. The taste is pretty average with some hop bitterness, but not very complex at all. Pretty well-balanced brew that's easy on the palate. Best part about this beer is that it is very drinkable. A decent session brew, but nothing too exciting going on here. Just a very average beer."
"Beer looks great in the glass, a rich orange with a decent head that goes away in a couple minutes. The one thing that stands out to me is how balanced it seems. It has enough flavor to be interesting, but light enough that it doesn't feel at all heavy, perfect for a Fall day, enjoying that last warm day before the Winter winds blow in."
"Pours orange with fizzy white head. Has the smell of faint toated malt. Taste has some toasty malt sweetness with a tangy aftertaste and faint hop bitterness. Overall a pretty well balanced lager with some flavor. Easy to drink and a good choice for having a few when you're in the mood for something mellow but tasty."
"overall, a decent oktoberfest. surprisingly bitter, but great hops flavor from the noble varieties they used."
"As an Octoberfest, this defies the style; this is closer to a lagered Bitter. I like this more than a typical Octoberfest, but it pushes the hop envelope."
"To me, this seemed like a hoppier interpretation of an Oktoberfest beer. Not bad, but I don't know if I could picture myself drinking one of these again. Average all around."
" The beer poured a good-looking clear copper with a nice off-white, cream-like head that maintained nicely. Spider-like lace is always nice for an October brew. The aroma was of sweet caramel malt. The taste also caramel roasted malt balanced by a spice hinted hop. The result for this well balanced, mild carbonated, medium bodied brew that is a smooth, mild drinkable beer. A slight hint of alcohol warmth is felt in the finish. Not a complex beer that nothing overly stands out but a very drinkable beer alone or with the fest of October."
"Pours a nice copper with decent almost creamy-like head that settles nicely leaving a small amount of lace,big caramel aromas with some roasted malt in the background with a light pepper note as well.Taste is roasted for sure with some lighter caramel notes and at times I pick up a light grassy hop note.Hey better than what I was expecting,picked it up because its pretty cheap and was pleasantly surprised.Bt did get a little cloying after a awhile."
"In addition, I sampled this at the Rochester Beer fest and at a local tasting. Still the same complaint, tastes like the Amber."
"It pours a light golden brown color. It is a little light in color for my expectations. The aroma is one dimensional malty grain. The oily body has an initial bitterness. It becomes smooth and finishes with a lingering sweetness. It is not very complex, but has enough toasted character to get by as a drinkable Oktoberfest."
"Drinkability&Notes: This was my first review of a Matt Brewing Co. beer, and I'm seriously impressed. Goes down so very nicely. Awesome Beer."
"The beer pours a dark golden/amber color with a thin white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is dry and mildly malty. The taste is good. It's light and refreshing, but with a bit of crystal malts to give it some character. It is slightly bitter and balanced with a light hop flavor. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine drinking fest beer; another fine offering from Saranac."
"Saranac made a bad attempt at this one. Back to the drawing board."
"Pours with a big, puffy, cream-colored head. The head is very stable, and sits atop a brownish-amber beer. Aroma is slightly hoppy and has hints of malt. Not nearly the sweet, malty aroma that I expected. Seriously intense carbonation. Drier than expected finish, with a hoppy, almost floral quality. It's not a bad beer, worthy of a session or two, but it's not what I would call a marzen."
"Overall a decent, drinkable O-fest. Nothing too special, but not bad."
"Saranac makes some ok beers, but i think they're geared more for folks getting into craft beer and still haven't developed a very sensitive palate, or someone looking for something a bit more flavorful that Honey Brown or what have you. Alright, but I won't get it again."
"Not a bad little beer from Saranac. It's certainly not a world-beater like some of the other Oktoberfests, but has a nice little drinkability, and I could have a few of these if I didn't have only a single."
"Overall - Not a bad choice for the price. I find the whole Saranac line, almost to a beer, to fit this same mold. Whatever style it happens to be, they are basically lighter (i.e. watered down) versions of said style. The O-fest is no exception to that rule. That being said, it is still a descent little lager. It has some O-fest qualities, but they are in short supply. A simple, easy, very drinkable beer."
"Appears copper mild brown ale with a cream colored decent sized head and leaves scattered patterns of lacing. Aroma consists of primarily faint caramel and other specialty malts with slight nut characteristics not bad just really mild and clean. Taste great drinkable representation of an O-fest just not the best version. Has the components the mild toasted nuts the sweetness swarming the palate in an endless battle for balance of the flavors and mild spice here great tasting beer. Mouthfeel is quite full for the typical Saranac beer I would say this is one of their better done seasonals thank god nobody wants to see that disgraced. Overall drinkability is decent one reason it does an alright job of copying such a great style of the Oktoberfest great drinkable version just toned down in flavor but it's there just toned down I like."
"for me, saranac brews have always been decent or below average. they never seem to make anything truly horrible or outstanding. fortunately, their octoberfest falls in the decent catergory. it's not the worst fest brew i've had, but there are loads that are better. it pours a nice ruby/amber colour with an impressive off white head. smells of caramel and malt, with a bit of alcohol apparent as well. for the most part, the taste is quite similar to the smell. there is a nice hoppiness here as well and it's medium body makes it quite drinkable overall. again, not a bad brew, but not the greatest octoberfest either."
"Thin, light, and lacking flavor, man has Saranac really let me down lately. There is a major lack of body in this beer. I will keep my Hacker-Pschorrs away from this beer because they would only insult it more. Don't get me wrong, it is not horrible, just very inferior in comparison to what an Octoberfest should be."
"It's not horrible, by any means. I just don't think it's all that special, either. (as might be indicated by being a limited, seasonal beer)"

"I have a bit of a prejudice against American Octoberfest interpretations, but I can't resist something new. Saranac has made a decent go with the style. The distinct bread malt aroma and flavor is aptly captured. The body is nice and light, but not too much so. The only criticism I would present is the IBU level. A bit more sharply bitter than I would prefer, but on the whole not a bad brew."
"I'm going to grab some more of this and put it away before it vanishes from the shelves; it's everything I wished for in an Oktoberfest."
"Hate to say it but #8 of 8 (last place) of Octoberfests tried so far this year...."
"This was my second Octoberfest this year and after Sammy's try, I think anything would rate high.  This was a nice beer with the marzen red color.  The head was a little thin and I had no lacing.  It was a good beer, but nothing was especially dictinctive, not that it was bad - just not distinctive.  I noticed more hops than malt, but the overall effect was good.  Very Drinkable."
"I thought this was one of the better O-fests I've had, more traditional than others.  Nice toasty malt characteristics, spicy hops, lingering lagered finish.  Made even more palatable by its $2.99/six price tag paid up in Utica.  I just wish I had it on tap at their Oktoberfest, which I missed by just a couple of hours."

"Clear copper lager with full head that vanishes. Decent aroma with hints of caramel and trademark Saranac malts. Overall this beer is nothing special; does not stand up to other Fests or the best of Saranac's other beers. Some light spiciness in the malts but generally corn tasting to me; hops are not quite there, mouthfeel is thick which I like but borders on syrupy. Other than a chunk of malt flavor at the beginning of the sip, this beer is hardly there, there's no middle, bottom, or finish. There is nothing bad about this beer (it goes down easily enough), just nothing exciting either. Maybe with a full plate of brats and some oom-pah music in the background, this beer can take on a life of it's own. But sitting here alone at my computer terminal, it's negligible."
"Nice bright copper body, topped by a thinnish white head. But nice lacing all down the glass. Good carmelly malt aroma. Better than expected fullness in mouthfeel. Some toasted malt, some hop bite in taste, but a little bland. Exceeded my expectations."
"Slight chill haze, sort of a brown amber color that's not as bright as some.  One half inch head at first, spidery at the margins in 50 seconds.  Nice spicy and hoppy aroma.  Sweet and hearty caramel malts, slightly nutty.  Hop balance is good and strays into the lemon range (rather than orange rind), unusual for an Oktoberfest.  Nice beer here, like Black Forest, a stronger Saranac offering.  There's a lot of variability in Matt beers, here's hoping they focus on the five or so strongest along with seasonals."
"Pours a pleasant light orangish amber color with a decent tan head that is too fizzy and doesn't last.  Very nice toasty malt in the nose with very faint hop bitterness in the background.  Nice toasty malt with a short burst of hoppy spiciness that quickly subsides into a nice balanced finish.  The maltiness is a touch too sweet and leaves the mouth a little sticky afterwards.  Otherwise this is a decently drinkable brew but with the other Ofest options available I will not be revisiting it."
"Presumably the 2002 version. This brew had some promise beginning with the color and aroma. Deep gold, nearly amber. Nice looking head, tan and creamy. Aroma is equally enticing with toasty malt and nutty notes. Unfortunately IMHO, it falls flat after that. Inital taste is metallic and astringent (too cold?). The warming action dissipates the metallic flavor, and mellows the beer, blending the toasted malt, caramel and nuttiness in a rather bland way. O'fests aren't my favorite and this one does nothing to change my mind."
"This is a very good beer, but to me it does not taste like a true Oktoberfest. This is the first American brewed interpretation of the style that I have tasted. Hop flavor is present, but the brew feels a little thin and not bitter enough for a true Oktober. I would drop the numbers comparing this to other styles, but I just cant because it really is a very good beer. The taste, mouthfeel, and smoothness are excellent, and I look forward to drinking many of these on a brisk fall night at the Saranac Fall Festival in September."
"She's a hoppy one.  Not a ""death by hops", by any means, however.  Good lager by Saranac of course.  Hops add a lot of festive aroma.  The flavor really builds after a while.  The body seems a little thin and sulfur-tangy under the hops, but finshes so clean that it really makes a great-drinking Fest Bier."
