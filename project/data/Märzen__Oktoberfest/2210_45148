The nose has all of the familiar malty notes I would expect in an oktoberfest with the addition of of some toasted oak which adds a nice dimension. Some slightly sweet malty notes are present along with that bone dry lager yeast character.  Taste is absent of any sweetness as all the malt is influenced strongly by the oak character.  The oak lends a very dry notes to the toasted malt character.  There is not a whole lot of character here although it is very easy to drink.  Mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated.  Overall, an interesting take on the style but a little lack in the flavor.","homebrew311","Nov 09, 2014"

That being said, the beer is still very drinkable and far from providing a bad experience. Just over-priced (in my area, anyway) and under-malted.","SpatenPony","Sep 13, 2014"

Since this is closer to a Wies'n Fest I don't miss the big melanoidin Bavarian Amber Märzen carries, but I wish there was a little more.  To the plus side, it's not a roasty or nutty beer at all, relying on good malt and hop combo to make up a pretty good brew.","steveh","Sep 09, 2014"

3.35,-9.2,,,,,,"12oz. bottle served in a tumbler.  07/17/14 printed on the label. Pours a golden orange with a translucent clarity and a loose, one inch, bright white head.  Nose is fairly nondescript - light malts and a hint of skunk.  Taste consistent with nose - not overly malty for a Marzen.  There's also a slight toasty quality, a bit of grassiness and noble hops bittering towards the finish.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a mild, even carbonation.  While I can't say that I particularly enjoy the big caramel notes associated with the style, this is a bit lacking.  I was anticipating that the oak would help attenuate the caramel malts and add an additional dimension; however, this is a bit too dull for my liking.","Jwale73","Sep 03, 2014"

American breweries just don't know how to make a good Oktoberfest. they always seem to think it needs lots of candy sweetness and reddish malts, and bitter herbal grassy hops. The good German breweries are nice lagered characters with light malts that speak for themselves, don't need all the extra things added into it. To be fair though, this isn't nearly as bad as most American O-fests which are loaded with caramel and Munich malts and super sweet. But, tt's barely enjoyable actually even if this wasn't supposed to be an Oktoberfest. 3.5","jlindros","Aug 30, 2014"

Nose is malty and has a the beginings of honey on it but stops short of any real honey scent. In fact it is the lightest oktoberfest I have ever seen. Light in color light in scent. It has a bit of hop herbal on it. Fresh grass. It’s cool like ti has the dew on it. Taste is light and smooth. Not really toasty bread but again more like a maibock. Light sweet malt that is the sweetness of the grain and only verges on a light honey. Dry white bread rather than crusty dark bread.  Dry crisp malt that’s round and gives a medium mouthfeel. A bit of fresh herbal hops come up to accent this one and offer balance. It finishes dry crisp, impeccably smooth and you cannot help but wonder how they managed to expose only the inherent sweetness of the grain so expertly. The hops leave a touch of bitter to linger and some grain to echo on the back palate. Unique and superb in texture; and in style and presentation to the palate.  The oak becomes mor eprominent as ti warms and it is quite dry.","utopiajane","Aug 21, 2014"

Light toasted and caramel malt, fresh earthy herbal hop and grassy aromas. Medium bodied with a full, slightly oily feel through the middle followed by a tangy, crisp hop bite near the end. Bready and toasted malt flavors up front and through the middle followed by crisp herbal hops from the middle to the end. Finished crisp and dry with a lingering herbal hop bitterness. Marzens aren’t a tongue twisting, taste bud numbing style. I’ve heard and read of a lot of disappointment with this particular beer almost as if Firestone Walker was going to reinvent the style. Well they didn’t. They made areally good marzen.","IronLover","Aug 20, 2014"

3.8,3,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,"one of the better versions ive had this fall, but I wanted it to be oaky, like its name misleadingly suggests. pours a pumpkin orange color into a 10 oz. globe with a robust white head that settles slowly. clear liquid, lots of bubbles, great nose. freshly fallen leaves, vanilla sweetness, caramel malt, german yeast, and a hint of wood. the flavor is a little less interesting than the nose, where everything is subtle, even the german malts. very little residual sugar though, which I love, and a fast finish, even for a lager. vanilla is light. I really wish this was oaked, or more so if it is, because I don't taste it and I think it would lend itself well to a good oaking. still a great beer though. light and drinkable, I could pound on these. firestones regular beers are as good as their whales. bomb stuff here.","StonedTrippin","Sep 27, 2013"

Smell is of malt, caramel, and fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and grain flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is a solid American take on the style in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Sep 26, 2013"

The beer appeared a darker amber color that was clear with a nice one-finger head that was pretty light. The beer gave off a very nice, robust malty aroma with hints of biscuit. The taste was as expected from a marzen, a big malt flavor, perhaps toasted and no bitterness to note. The beer had a lighter moderate feel, but the carbonation seemed to be right. The beer was very easy to drink, it was clean and refreshing. Overall, a fine beer and one that I will hope to get next fall.","PhillyStyle","Jan 25, 2013"

The aroma has a lot of toasted malts, with just a touch of noble hop spice. The flavor has plenty of rich, toasty malt flavors with almost perfect hop balance. Medium-light on the palate. This is quite reminiscent of the oktoberfests that they actually serve in Munich, which are much more drinkable than the darker marzens that get shipped over here. Make no mistake though; this is a more complex and flavorful beer than the versions that the major Munich breweries are making. I'm a bit confused on the oak part. My roommate says he tasted oak, but I didn't pick out anything definitive, and Firestone's website doesn't say anything about oak in the production process. Regardless, this is another awesome Firestone beer, and one that I can see anyone loving.","bulletrain76","Nov 08, 2008"

My nose is greeted by an earthy and slightly piney hop aroma. Sweet bread, nutmeg, very grainy. I spent a few minutes trying to pinpoint the dominant characteristic in the malt profile of Oaktoberfest and decided it was grain. The beer smells very grainy. The beer is reminiscent of a pumpkin ale, but I don't think there is any pumpkin flavor in it. Aromas of nutmeg, clove, some vanilla, and possibly allspice give it pumpkin ale characteristics. These are not primary characteristics of the aroma but were detectable nonetheless. The mild bitterness up front is quick to introduce caramel and grainy malt flavors. The taste is of oak, nutmeg, and vanilla, and a faint hop bitterness concludes the show. The carbonation is good.","HopHead84","Oct 23, 2008"
