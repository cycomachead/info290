"I remember this as being my very first beer outside the realm of Coors and Budweiser.  I loved it, and still love it today.  Best balanced beer I have ever had,"

"Overall this is a great beer and the only brew worth ordering at Gordon Biersch in my opinion. Very tasty."
""
"Overall, this is a pretty good beer that maybe my personal favorite from their ine up."
""
""
""

""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall - A nice, unassuming beer. Your American Adjunct Lager drinking buddies should have no issues with this beer. Ultimately, however, this lager is little lacking in character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A fairly sweet and malty brew at only 5.7 % abv with a nice easy drinking feel. A very enjoyable, year round Marzen style beer."
""
""
""
""
"This beer means business. Consistent copper color and persistent lacing, nice taste and a swell finish. I made mistake of going beer for beer against a guy who was sucking down Michelob Ultra. In the span of 2 1/2 hours I probably had eight or nine of these. Net effect was like being kicked in the head by a mule. This beer doesn't pull its punches and is better left to be consumed slowly and responsibly. Watch out!"
""
"The Verdict: Pretty good. A solid malty lager with good flavor. There is not pretense of balance, hoppiness is nowhere to be found. Still, it’s tasty and goes down smooth."

"Beautiful amber hue is the first thing to greet the eye upon pouring it into my trusty pint glass. Crisp to start after a healthy inhalation of a bready grassy aroma. A hint of something else for sure but unfortunately my palate hasn't developed enough to call it out with confidence. The aroma chases the taste onto my tongue. The bitterness is perfectly balanced with the hops and roasted malt. The finish is dry but a bit disrupted by something and my guess is that it's age. Alas, here in Singapore freshness is often something to be desired. The bottling date puts it 11 months ago, but I'm going to go ahead and call it a solid Marzen! Prost!"

"a real easy drinker, to me this would be a perfect oktoberfest bier because of its sessionable qualities. the appearance is fully clear, pumpkin flesh orange with an obvious amber malt glow and a fluffy and patient bone white head. the nose is caramunich malts, as it should be, with only moderate sweetness and a really really creamy texture that slides effortlessly down the gullet one swig after another. theres also a slight fruity complexion to the yeast, but its tame, and it too gives way to the sweetness of the malt, which is less amber than it looked, and more caramel and classically german. i could drink this forever, its medium in body, but feels lighter because if its gentle glide. it also has fairly relaxed carbonation, which lets the heft of the body remain. to me this is a perfect fall beer which stays approriate in the winter too. this is one of the best regular beer on at gordon biersch by far i thought. only 4 bucks-ish during happy hour, how can you beat that? id buy this is a 6pack if i could."
""
""
""
"A pretty decent Marzen, I think I could drink a pile of these."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This has more hop bitterness in a marzen than I am used to but it is still an enjoyable beer."
""
""
"A classic, flavorful, malt-forward brew with a surprising balance and flavor that keeps you sipping until your next pint. Very interesting and complex upon close scrutiny, yet as a whole is very welcoming and approachable that just about anyone can appreciate it. Goes down easy and is the perfect session beer. Great brew!"
""
""
""
""
"A real treat, and one of my favorite amber lagers to date. This is one of the most authentic renditions of märzens I've had since my visit to Germany. There's complexity for sure, but there's a relaxing vibe about it overall that makes it a crowd pleaser for just about anyone, even people who aren't fans of beer, as experience has shown me in the past. Goes good with most food, but particularly would be good cooked with pork or steak. Excellent stuff!"

"Pours a clear copper with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small patches of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt and some caramel aromas. Taste is of toasted malt, bread, and some slight caramel flavors on the finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is pretty straightforward and drinkable."

"Gordon Biersch is probably the only brewery whose flagship beer is a Marzen, but this is a good thing for them. It's an incredibly smooth, roasty beer. Just sweet enough, perfectly enjoyable at any occasion. And don't wait until October to try it, because they have FestBier waiting for you then. I've never had a Marzen with a particularly amazing nose, but this one does OK - those roasty malts can only indicate happiness to come."

"This is one of the best marzens I've had to date."

"Review from 10/2010 notes. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a light to medium orange amber with a light off-white head. Light malt and dark fruit aroma. Flavor is light to medium dark fruits and malt with light hop presence. A nice American made Marzen and a pleasant dinner beer."

"The maerzen is probably my favorite of the standard Gordon Biersch beers. It sticks to the style while delivering decent flavor and drinkability. A go-to … if you’re at a Gordon Biersch."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Really good beer. Slightly hopper than the European Marzen's I've had. Very good, especially for beer available on an airplane!"
""
""
"Overall: A good Marzen."
""
"Overall - I'll admit naivety when it comes to Marzen beers; I don't think I could count on half a hand the number of beers I've had in this style. Certainly drinkable, but not so enjoyable that I'd seek it out again."
""
"Pours a copper amber with little to no head that dissipates quickly to form a ring around the outer edge and a small archipelago on top. Crisp and clear with no haze whatsoever. Smells sweet and a bit fruity, notes of raisin overpowered by caramel and syrup smells. Smooth and not as sweet as expected. Full mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation. Moderate upfront sweetness that hints at brown sugar and molassas. Easy to drink, light. Excellent for the style. No bitterness on the finish. Leaves behind a bit of a piney taste. Overall a great beer."
""
"This was one of the more complex Marzen offerings I’ve had to date. The high quality standards of GB were definitely showcased in this offering. The higher ABV was also interesting given that most Marsens are brewed as session beers"
""
"Overall Impression- Wow! Super close to the original marzens from Munchen. Highly suggest! Would like to enjoy more from this brewery. A bit pricey at the airport..."
""
"An easy drinking, nice tasting take on the Marzen style. Could easily bang down six of these in short order. An anytime of year brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not a very impressive Marzen. I enjoy the style, but this one is by no means world class. The offering from several other breweries are much better. Wonder if this is better on tap?"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Had this on tap at Raleigh Durham airport. Made the time go quickly. A traditional marzen; worth a try if you enjoy the style."
""
"Overall, I can't remember when I had this last, but I reviewed it well last time, and maybe better this time. Just a solid marzen, and year-round I believe. Awesome. Very well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:	It was one of the better offerings. Nothing really stands out to make it above average but still a good beer."
""
""
""
""
"Probably their signature beer, but I am just not a fan of it. Their seasonal beers are usually their best."
""
""
""
"My pour resulted in two-plus fingers of dense tawny head with great retention. Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. BUPGOO! Nose was rich and malty, very caramel-like in its intensity. The head was so long-lasting that I was in no hurry to disrupt it, so I allowed it to fall on its own, leaving some nice lacing in its wake. Mouthfeel was medium and it had a rich malty sweetness on the tongue that might have been to much for me on most nights, but it was tasting pretty daggum good tonight. Finish remained very sweet with just a hint of hops at the extreme finish and I know that I would generally shun something like this, but half the glass was empty just while I typed! Nice."
""
"There is nothing wrong with this beer. A nice marzen/ Amber styled beer for anyone looking to move on from Coors and Pabst. One of the better offerings from Gordon Biersch."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Very impressive marzen. A style I enjoy but have never been blown away, this one comes close."
"O - Decent Marzen style beer and great crisp flavor combined with it's medium body."

"Overall I liked this beer. I wish I could find them more in my area."
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability - Bottle is probably past its prime. As is, offers no redeeming qualities, and has too man prominent off-characters to be either a session or a tasting beer."
"O: One of my favorite Marzen's to date. It has a very 'bready' flavor to it. I would put this in the top 10% of Marzen's I have tried."
"o - Overall a very easy to drink Marzen. Not a ton going on but some caramel and bready malts, but nice for the style and something I would order again. Probably the best of their beers I had that night."
"Dr: It's pretty drinkable; you could down it quickly all night. No alcohol comes through, but at this ABV that's not difficult to accomplish. I'd try it on draught, but it's nothing special. It does compete with most German examples of the style I've had, but those were brewed mainly for festivals."
"This is usally my staple brew when going to Gordon Biersch with the wife for dinner. It is a nice smooth taste with a nice deep amber color in the glass. This beer goes great with the Steak Frites which is steak cut up over fries with a Marzen based sauce poured over top. Wash that down with a Marzen and you will be set for the night!"
"Had the Marzen at the G & B in Bolingbrook, IL last evening. The color was a nice copper/amber with white head that laced slightly. The aroma was sweet with hints of malt. The taste was a very good balance of grain, hops and malt. The was a slight sweetness that made the beer smooth to drink and the beer came off the pallet clean. Overall not to bad...the mouthfeel was smooth and easy. good session beer."
"Where a bit more dryness and hop influence is preferred, this Marzen is sure to satisfy the sweet tooth."
"This beer pours a clear, bold gold/rust color with 3/4"" head and some lasting lace. The aroma is of caramel and hints of plumb and roasted malt. The flavor has caramel and molasses notes with a faint hints of spice. Toast shows up in the finish. It's got a light-medium mouthfeel, great with pretzels. Gordon Biersch Marzen is a good beer, a decent example of the style. Recommended!"
"This beer gives me a new respect for Gordon Biersch."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle. Has a pretty auburn color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by malts, ahint of caramel. Taste is also malty, slightly sweet, just a touch of hops. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
"Poured a clear, amber-brown with a small white head. Aroma was toasty, nutty, light, grainy. Taste of toasted bread, sweet malts; very mildly hopped. Standard märzen profile, nothing too interesting going on. A little on the light/watery side, but not too bad, and fairly drinkable."
"This is my 2nd favorite beer that GB makes. The first is still The Swarz."
"Overall - A good Marzen, good full body, nice touches of spice. Very drinkable"
"O: It's a nice refreshing beer. Not to sweet to start, not to bitter to finish. something I would certainly purchase again."
"This is a very good beer. Makes a great octoberfest beer. This dark and deep amber colored beer is very clear. It pours with a very thin head. A very light aroma of malt leads one to expect the beer will be very light. However, one taste tells you that this is not the case. This dry beer is full bodied with strong flavors of toasted malt. Had it at the Sacremento Airport."
"Nice and simple every day beer!"
"Notes: Overall this is a solid American take on the style. Moderate to full-bodied, and well balanced. It's quite easy to drink, and pretty damn tasty."
"Had this on tap at the Gordon Biersch in Virginia Beach. Color is a good copper shade with a nice two finger head that dissipated at a fair rate and left some lacing. Smell was bready, but rather light. Taste was good, malty, bready, earthy, and a slight sweetness. Aftertaste was unremarkable, but not offensive. The beer wasn't too heavy, but wasn't very light either. It hit a nice middle ground. Overall, this was a nice marzen, nothing spectacular, but it was well done and I would have some of it again."
"O: It's a decent Marzen. 3.5"
"From a bottle stamped “bottled on 4/18/11” consumed on 6/25/11. Poured into a pint glass, it’s a dark reddish brown color with good clarity and minor carbonation streams. Pleasant nose with buttery diacetyl notes, nuts, and heavy sweet malt. In the mouth, it tastes as the nose advertises: malt heavy with toffee and hops notes. Slightly flat and watery. Overall, it’s a decent beer, a few steps above average but nothing either “extreme” or especially “mellow.” Sessionable; I could drink several for sure but nothing I’d seek out. Worth a try."
"Served in a pint glass with a good inch of foamy off whit head. Head reduces down to a mere ring around the edge fairly quickly. Aroma is fairly muted, mostly caramel malt and some faint grassy hops. Flavor is a bit more developed: caramel malt, some light citrus hops, a mild bitterness, and an earthy finish. Feel is medium bodied, a bit on the lighter side for the style, but very clean tasting. Overall a decent, but not great, beer"
"D-This one was pretty enjoyable, but it was a little on the pricey side for a marzen served in the wrong glassware."
"O: An okay beer, but nothing really special. I’m thinking this would have been better on tap."
"A good beer waiting for an airplane, but I was hoping for a touch more."
"O-A solid rendition of the style."
"O: Very good. I can see why this in one of their most popular offerings."
"This is a decent, simple, malty lager that I would certainly come back to when offered alongside BMC-type tap offerings."
""
"Overall: A very good example of the style with no real faults. Worth a try if you're into German lagers and trapped on the wrong side of the ocean."
"D- Yes, Yes, Yes. Go get one."
"D: Refreshing and solid brew. Easily drinkable and quite sessionable. Very rich malty character was an enjoyment."
"I had this beer for the first time at a local bar in west palm beach which is where I live. This beer had a nice amber color and a finger and a half inch head. The taste of the beer was the biggest surprise. It was very good. I generally drink only IPAs but this Marzen was worth writing about. I recommend this beer to anyone and everyone!"
"Drinkability- this is definitley a session beer that you can have more than one of in a night."
"I'm thoroughly impressed with how well-defined, how expertly-stylistically distinguishable the flavors are. Tune in next time to track the development of my swooning."
"I've had this in my kegerator in the past, and it didn't disappoint there either."
"average really. but not to be undersold. a highly drinkable beer that i would drink a lot of."
"Pours a clean reddish/copper color with an off-white head. Leaves a little bit of lacing on the side of the glass. Has a subtle sweet/malty smell. Really get the hops and a grainy taste. It has a pretty high carbonation. Very drinkable and really enjoyed this brew."
"The beer had a cloudy amber-orange color with a medium-sized white head with moderate retention. The aroma was malt-dominated, with caramel highlights, and some lighter yeasty and citrus tones. Flavor was mildly sweet with a slight bitterness, and was mostly malty. It was a slightly wet beer with a drier finish, average carbonation, and a medium body. The beer was ok, but nothing too be remembered."
"D- Very nicely balanced and slightly sweet. Very easy to drink."
"Overall, this was probably one of my favorites at the restaurant, it was an excellent Marzen and worth a try!"
"drinkability is ok..."
"D. A decent brew a little on the sweet side but a good representation of the style."
"Sampled at Gordon Biersch restaurant in Dallas, TX. Pours copper hue. Aroma is of sweet caramel malt. Body is medium, smooth. Taste is sweet caramel malt up front and then earthy hops kick in to balance. Long, malty finish. On the whole, it is nice Marzen."
"Overall an ok marzen not a bad example of the style but not a good one either."
"Mouthfeel is way overcarbonated, leaving a fizzy impact that hurts the profile of an otherwise solid beer. Body is a bit light, but it is otherwise smooth with little palate impact. If this had lower carbonation, it would be less filling and the drinkability would score higher."
"Taste was a little bit of dark malts, and that's about it. I don't drink a lot of Oktoberfest beers, but this is probably one of the least flavorful ones that I have had."
"D: Good brew. Reminds me of similar ones from Germany."
"I just looked down and noticed I'm drinking this beer fast, so I guess that goes for something. But this has to be one of the shortest reviews I've written...I'm finding this brew completely uninspiring."
"Pours a golden-copper color with a few brighter streaks in the light. Single-finger white head falls pretty quickly and doesn't leave behind too much lacing. The nose is really light earthy hops plus some mild toffee and bread notes. The taste is really light toffee propped up on a base of lightly-toasted bread. Feel is light to medium with pretty good carbonation. Drinks well in the end, though it is a bit plain."
"Pours a nice clear copper with a medium sized head. A little lacing on the surface. Very mild smell- sweet and toasty malt. Nice biscuity malty flavor. Sweetness in the background. Some herbal hops in the finish. Very little bitterness. Medium to light bodied. Very easily drinkable. A solid marzen."
"D: A tasty, drinkable beer. Neither offensive nor particularly good. I'd have it again, but there are a number of others I'd choose first. Still, this exceeded my expectations."
"This beer is pretty drinkable, the flavors are not strong, but are well done for a mazen that is on the malty side."
"RJT"
"D- very drinkable, on of the better amercan marzen/fests out there"
"This beer has a very strong caramel taste and after taste. A good, classic Marzen offering from GB, that is perfect for a cool Fall afternoon or evening. Because of the strong caramel flavor, this is not great for drinking in significant quantity but is great if you are interested in having one or two."
"D- Very Drinkable"
"D: Extremely easy to drink. I love to drink this beer while chilling and was able to convert a Bud-sciple to drink this instead."
"Appearance is copper in color with a nice head that dissapates leaving no lace. Smell of sweet malt and light in dark fruits. Taste has that sweet maltiness, grainy and balanced well with the low hop, but having a light bitterness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. Gordon Biersch seems to make good on the German styles."
"Drink is excellent, I was crazing this today. Overall a very excellent beer from a company that does get overlooked quite a bit."
"I don't notice anything sticking out wrt the mouthfeel. Carbonation and thickness seem to be on point for the style. This is a nice, subtle lager that you can quaff for an entire session. This is probably Gordon Biersch's best beer. Darn nice."
"Pours a splendidly clear amber orange. Off-white, ringy head. Plenty of carb trails. Smell is crisp and fresh, almost a light vanilla/floral quality, hard to pin down. Taste is mild for a märzen, good and clean with a hint of toasted nuttiness, as well as alcohol. Finishes pleasantly bitter. Feel is active and soapy. Drinkability average for the style, but a decent brew in all."
"Mouthfeel is a bit too thin, but not ridiculously so."
"D- I found this goes quick and well with many different foods."
"D - Weak, watery, thin. These are the words that best describe GB Marzen. Avoid if possible."
"D - This was a pretty good marzen. It appears to be their signature brew."
"Top notch. Comparable to the greats from overseas."
"D: I first had this beer in San Diego and I don't remember it being this astringent. Usually it's been a very malty beer, but maybe my palate has become more sensitive to these kinds of things. While usually I enjoy this beer, this particular pint just wasn't my pint of beer :/"
"D- easy and pleasant to drink, quite good but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
"D - Very drinkable, I could quaff a sixer with pretzels & other salty snacks for sure. I think I'd buy again for a toss back beer but it's nothing exciting to me, I would of liked more malt character in the flavor. Not bad for the price though, but I'd look elsewhere for a richer malt profile."
"Very drinkable and enjoyable. This is a nice simple brew that you a can knock back with your buddies, while they drink that other stuff."
"Marzen/Oktoberfest is a style I'm just realizing is really tasty. I think this is pretty good. I'll be trying more this fall."
"D - Very drinkable, this large glass is disappearing pretty quickly. Unfortunately I don't have time for another!"
"Comments: Overall, I liked this beer, but I probably would not reach for another considering some of the other options that can be found within this style."
"Overall: Honestly, this is the first Märzen I've tried and I thought it was pretty good. This beer shows a lot of promise for this style."
"D - I used to think this was a great beer. Now, it's average. If it's at a party I'll drink it, but I'm not going out of my way to drink this."
"The mouth is thinner than I'd like. Could stand a bite more depth here. Well-rounded flavors with a sweet finish. Mild bitterness. This beer surely hits the spot. I love that this offering is offered year-round, so I can get my Marzen fix without waiting for Autumn. Good stuff."
"Yet again, bland and generic. A by the books version of a Marzen."
"D= very drinkable and enjoyable, would make a nice session beer, I've been working my way through a case with great enjoyment."
"Pours a bright amber, transparent sinopia, with a dissipating head. This isn't the prettiest style on the block, but this beer is pretty spot-on, in my rather limited märzen experience. Aroma is sweet caramel, closer to the cheap stuff filling candy bars but still pleasing. Bit of a rum-like note, as well. Maybe, a bit of Euro hops of some sort. Flavor is sweet but not cloying. I expected less, to be honest, and I bet this beer is even better fresh from a keg. Mouthfeel is a tad slick, but I don't really mind. I've never been a huge märzen fan, but this is one is definitely better (and probably truer to style) than many American versions."
"Taste, bland and boring would be too harsh, but not anywhere near exciting. You know, they roasted a decent amount of malt, little hopping. Unadventurous. Their garlic fries are bomb though. Too expensive for what it is to rate drinkability wise."
"Tried this at the City Paper Brew festival, here in Baltimore. I didn't know what to expect from this brewery but both their Marzen and Maibock were very good. The Marzen was very malty, smooth as I would expect. Thin in mouthfeel, very little carbonation. Very drinkable."
"D: Expected this brew to be a bit sweeter but it wasn't all together bad. Pretty average."
"The flavor is rich and bready with a sweetness that reminds me of butterscotch. The finish has a small hop flavor in it that's very similar to a pilsner, and seeing as they're both lagers this makes sense. Overall this beer surprised me, I admit to having reservations about Gordon Biersch based on their being like Taco Mac and other chains, but this is a good and decent Marzen, and well worth the dollar a bottle price."
"Nicely colored amber brew with something of a grainy nose and taste, sweet with caramel malts, some nuttiness, and a hint of spice but there's something off, a sort of hollowness to the taste and a chalkiness in the light mouthfeel. I wouldn't have mistaken it for a classic German Märzen, but I might still drink it again."
"A good beer if you are looking for malt, rather typical for the style."
"The beer pours a golden orange color with a white head. The aroma is lots of biscuit malt. The flavor is a bready malt with a light hop character. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Decent, nothing spectacular."
"Very drinkable, this is one I truly don't want to put down. 5.7% ABV isn't too high, but for Oktoberfest-style sessioning it can catch up quickly, and I imagine that the rich maltiness would also become a little cloying after just a few. A little higher hopping rate would help that out, but as it is it's still a wonderful example of the style made even better by being a year-round brew."
"Not really that impressive, but a decent brew overall."
"Drinkability: A strange flavor, without much complexity or depth. Not a great example of the style."
"I like this beer. It's consistent and goes well with the food GB serves. It pours with a nice head. I'll give some credit to the bartender who knew actually how to pour a lager. The golden brown amber color looked nice and clear. The malty aroma was nice but not over powering and the mouthfeel was decent. Seemed a little forced with carbonization but not bad. I would happily drink this beer again."
"Drinkability: Compared to the FestBier, this is less balanced, a bit cloying and much fuller bodied - all of which reduce the drinkability"
"I must say this is a decent quality beer. Definitely not a stand-alone brew. If you get one of these, have it with a meal. The food complements an otherwise unremarkable beer."
"Dark amber, one finger head, quick dissipation with above average lacing. Malt dominated nose, bready over sweet, with quite a bit of piney hops present. The taste is a bit of roasted malt more than sweetness, syrupy, not much hops in the taste or on the backend. Malts become more dominant as the beer warms up, with sweetness coming to forefront. Nice carbonation, fairly smooth mouthfeel. A farily decent interpretation of the style."
"Came in a really cool plastic bottle that I have never seen before. This was a very pleasant marzen with very good drinkability and decent malt and hop profile. On the darker side of the style I was reminded of Negro Modelo at times though I found the mouthfeel on the thicker side. With the limited amount of Marzens available year round in BC this is a nice find that I will purchase again"
"Decent, easy drinking brew. I really enjoy this one when I'm enjoying more than one."
"Notes: Like many of the other GB beers it is a solid correct version of a traditional German style. However, also like other GB beers, it doesn't really stand out. It's a solid beer, but doesn't seem to have any endearing qualities."
"Drinkability: Very mild for an Oktoberfest, but that mildness does lend this brew to a nice bit of drinkability. That being said, this brew is a bit too mild for my taste. I've had worse Oktoberfests, but there are plenty out there that are better."
"Got it in a Gordon Biersch mixer. Amber beer with an off-white head that dissolves leaving no lacing and a touch of film. Nose is spicy caramel malt and a touch of grain - super mild. Really very little going on here aroma-wise. Flavor is similar, if a touch stronger. Similar caramel malt, a touch of dirty earth flavor. Some grain. Carbonation is fine, appropriate for the style. Overall, very mediocre - not offensive, just not particularly good."
"Drinkability- ok have had better marzens but it was ok just average"
"Overall: I like it. Although, the body is somewhat lacking."
"Drinkability: A decent, acceptable lil' O-fest with just the right amount of maltiness, hoppiness, and overall drinkability."
"A great Beer and one worth trying."
"D: An OK marzen, there is certainly worse out there, but certainly better."
"It's not bad, and not all that good either. Better than a macro, and I would drink another one, but I certainly wouldn't seek it out."
"Quite drinkable, I was surprised actually, this is the first Gordon Biersch beer I've tried and it is a decent and drinkable Oktoberfest. In particular it pairs very nicely with food. It won't blow your socks off but I'm sure you'd want another."
"D: Very drinkable, this was a pretty good one for an American version of the Oktoberfest."
"Mouthfeel is rich enough for the style, nice and crisp. Drinkability is good, a little metallic but overall not bad. I'm sure this review suffered because I had a Hacker Pshorr first, but this is a fairly good beer."
"The Gordon Biersch Marzen has an auburn tint to it. Overall it is medium bodied and goes down very smoothly. It is a medium-hopped lager with a mildly sweet taste to it. The Marzen is the most popular beer at the Rockville location and understandably so. If you are at a GB, make sure you give this one a try."
"Smooth and creamy, mildly carbonated. Nutty, and not too malty, with some caramel apple. Slight hop back, just enough to give it character. Could drink quarts of it."
"A nice little beer, not great, but if the price is right( i got this one free) i will buy more."
"Medium body, with moderate carbonation. Not terribly creamy. Overall not bad, but this beer is significantly better on-tap at the Plano restaurant. Bottled version is much sweeter, and only shows a bit of characteristic toastiness you would expect. In the future, I'll stick to the tap."
"I've felt nothing but disappointment with Gordon Biersch brews"
"[rathertap]"
"Drinkability: Drinkable en masse but it's not a stand alone; goes well with their food"
"D: Very drinkable. Good sesson lager."
"D- Not bad, but not great either, overall pretty average for a Marzen."
"Gordon Biersch makes a good marzen beer. It is available all year round at your local Safeway. It is easy to pick out of the crowd with its red label. In my experience the aroma is sweet and the brew looks gorgeous filling up my extra large pint-sized glass."
"D - Quite nice overall with a complex and enjoyable malt character. My only complaint is the dryness in the finish which makes the toasted character seem excessive and diminishes the richness of the malt."
"Not that I should, but I'd compare this iteration of the lager style to a cleaner amber ale, one with less depth of flavor."
"D: Even though the taste is mild, this is highly drinkable bier. Could have the whole 6-pack without an issue. However, if you are looking for a real high quality Marzen, look somewhere else. I will have this again though. Not bad. Prosit."
"D) Another really nice beer from GB. Very German earmarks, fresh and tasty, I'll be getting more."
"The aroma is dusty, malty, and corn like malt and floral hops. The appearance is orange gold with a large head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is thin. Overall a nice tasting beer that is a bit thin and weak. I wish this one had more substance I really want to like this one."
"Had this on tap at Gordon Biersch in DC. Poured a rusty orange color with thin off-white head that left that remained as a slight skim on the top and some lacing. Not much nose, though I did detect a very slight fruit scent. Medium bodied mouthfeel that was somewhat tingly led to fairly weak fruit taste. Not real impressed with the finish, as it was short and a tad skunky."
"Amber, crystal clear, with a healthy head but no lace. Lots of carbonation is present. The aroma is definitely malty. The first taste reveals a medium to med-heavy body brew, sweet in the middle and finish. I found it underhopped for my tastes and sweet to the point of cloying"
"M + D: Medium bodied with a good carbonation balance. If the odd sweet notes in the flavour and aroma were toned down, I think I would find this much more enjoyable. Worth checking into, though I don't know if I'd be after it again, personally."
"Drank this from a 12 oz. bottle. Decanted into a pint glass. Pours a clear orange with a very small white head. Aromas are pretty one-note: very bready, some dark fruit. Flavors are singularly bready, with a few sour notes. Not a lot of dynamic character. Mouthfeel is decent - appropriate for the style. An easily drinkable beer, just not a lot of character to it."
"this brew pours up a clear orange-copper color with a small off white head. nice lacing on my glass. the nose is German malts, light fruits, maybe some raspberries. I taste sweet malts ,a hint of smoke, crisp hop finish. buttery and smooth mouthfeel. A fairly decent brew..."
"D- This beer is a light very drinkable and sessionable lager. It will be a good one to give to friends, here in Texas, who drink Shiner bock"
"copper colored, 1 fnger head. not much smell i can pick up. has a decent moutfeel, pretty smooth actually. taste is kinda meh, not a whole lot going on with it. get little malt and a touch of sweetnes, a tad bitter hops, nothing really stands out though. okay beer, nothing to get excited about. would much rather have Sam Adams Octoberfest any day. could also bet that its February and maybe need to get it again when it comes back in season."
"Enjoyed at the Miami brewpub. A marzen in February-why not? Their most popular beer at this location, according to the trainer, and maybe the best of the day. Smoke cloudy colour with a minimum white head, and faint lace. Served way too cold, but still a good malting and fruity."
"I have been to several Gordons, Seattle, SF, Vegas, DC and everytime I get this beer. Had it on tap and bottle but bottle kind of sucks. Poured a nice deep auburn, with a smaller than most of this styles, head. A half inch tan pillow and thats it. Nose is malty, sweet and sour candy-like. Taste is well balanced and the body is solid with a sweet malted caramel greats you while a mild hop comes through to crisp the rear. Mouthfeel is very smooth and drinkable."
"Pretty good Märzen. It's nicely malty, sweet, and thick."
"Out of the bottle it pours a red auburn with not much head. It has very subtle aromas which are dominated by a sweet almost sugary smell. Taste is dry and a mildly hoppy on the finish. I think it could use a little more carbonation. But overall, very easy to drink."
"Opinion: Well, I have been drinking a whole lot of Paulaner Oktoberfest here this season, and this beer really doesn't do it for me like that one. Oktoberfest styles are rather subtle with a delicate mix between the different flavors. They can be mistaken as mild, but if you think about what you are tasting...it is like a milkshake. This beer doesn't do that for me. It is OK, but the hops and crystal are out of balance to let the toasty malts shine through. It is an alright beer, and I would certainly take it above a whole lot of others...and I would even like to try it again on tap...but I won't be seeking it out like I do a whole lot of others."
"This beer has a nice copper color, and a moderate head on top of it, though it fades within a minute or so. The nose is rather grainy for a Marzen, though there's an adequate maltiness in the nose. The flavor has a very light toastiness, but is pretty bland for a Marzen, malt-wise. Better on draft at the local GB than it is in the bottle, by far."

"5/3/5/3/10/2.6"
"This poured a clear brownish ruby with a little white head. It smelled like malt and some mild hops. It tasted like roasted malt with some bitterness. It was watery and had a little carbonation, with a sour aftertaste. I'm not a big fan of the lager sourness, so overall I'd just say this wasn't bad. Although it did taste more like a standard ale than anything."
"It is watery and I will not buy it again. Not a good representation of a Marzen."
"I'd pass on this one."
"D - Not great, but good if you are looking for a sweet beer."
"The taste is caramelly grain with a cream-soda hint. It's a bit on the alcoholic side, smooth but light and spritzy. It's a little too sweet, uncomplicated, and one-dimensional, and a bit flat. The finish is rather short and flat with almost no aftertaste aside from a barely noticeable hint of grain."
"D- Easy to drink, nothing terrible but also nothing to write home about. I just think there are better ones out there."
"A dark copper brew is covered by a two-finger rolling tan head that fades in a somewhat slow manner and leaves very litte lacing. Not much on the nose. Maybe some malts and spice. Tastes of malts, a very subtle essence of caramel and not much more. Has plenty of carbonation and d light to medium mouth-feel. Not bad, but nothing special here."
"The fourth in the line of the 6x Sampler at the Rockville restaurant and the one that those with me (thanks N & E) ordered individually. Easily the most drinkable of the bunch. Nice hazy orange in the glass with a significant head of tan foam that laced fairly well throughout. All caramel malt in the nose, and the same in the taste... with just a touch of residual bitterness thrown in to make it soft on the palate. Extremely drinkable and, if one weren't careful, the one GB offering that would never be cloying and could easily be enjoyed all night long. I have a feeling the ABV would sneak up on you after awhile... offering a true Oktoberfest experience."
"D= I like the roasty toasted-nut flavors in this beer and it is usually my go-to beer in this place. Decently good."
"Not a bad beer, easy to drink."
"Is it just me or is this beer simply boring. After sampling a couple of these I'm tempted to drink the rest just to free up some real estate in my beer fridge. Pours a medium copper color with a slight amber tint. Large head that quickly settles down to a minimal along with minimal lacing. Looks ok but then I close in to smell this beer and I get nothing. A little closer and I am able to detect a faint presence of sweet malt and nothing else. Mouthfeel is decent but borders on thin, finish is sticky and undesireable. The flavor is weak and unimpressive nothing too good worth writing about. Overall I really don't care for this beer. I bought it on sale and I still overpaid."
"Overall a nice high ABV session beer."
"D: Out of the previous 3 G.B. beers I've had, this is the best so far. Would come back to this one again."
"D - Very easy to drink and always enjoyable."
"General Impression: a bit rough but overall a good call"
"CHEERS!!!!"
"Drinkability- Smooth and clean, currently the most affordable craft beer outside of Trader Joes in the neighborhood. I can't complain about that, also seems to be an excellent style example for a marzen. I will revisit it again."
"Quite often overdone, GB's Maerzen is neither to thin nor too malty sweet, and hits the mark right on. Add to that that it's very well made and you've got a very drinkable lager that's interesting enough to enjoy beyond one serving, and also pairs well with food. Worth trying!"
"D- The malt flavors are nice but they are behind all the carbonic acid finish. They taste fresh but their is not a lot of depth to them."
"Nothing too complex, but certainly above average. There's a slight metallic note I could do without, however."
"Eric"
"Overall- Not bad and a good representation of the style. It is a little bit sweet, but it sure beat the hell of the BMC that are in most airport bars!"
"This was an average Marzen that was quite good to have while on a ski break. Amber hue with intentionally no head poured from the server - Balanced malt nuttiness and slight spicy hop parallel the aroma and flavor. Slight creamy mouthfeel. Drank one and was headed back for the slopes- glad I bought this instead of a lousy $10 hamburger."
"D- It is drinkable. I love the color. I wasn't too impressed with the mouthfeel."
"D - I wasn't running back for more, but it's easy to drink. Not bad."
"This is the best ""pub-brewery"" beer I have ever drank in a restaurant chain."
"Overall- An easy session beer. Not as good as their Hefe but tasty."
"Clean, copper body with tight blonde head. Modest malt presence detectable in aroma. Taste brings out a little spice but mostly malt, with a little bit of German hops. Clean mouthfeel but heavy. Modest flavor profile doesn't lend itself well to drinkability."
"A copper color with ruby tints and a decent head and lace patches. A weak smell, considering the style. There are some hops noticeable, but no spices jump out, no fruit, no caramel or whatever you might find in a marzen. The taste is rather thin with minimal hops and a few peppers that goes down the gullet slick. It is an alright brew, but I expected more on this one."
"D- This is an alright brew. Usually ""the good stuff"" at most BBQ's."
"Tap at the Gordon Biersch brewery in S.F. Golden amber rich color with a fluffy off white head that held up for a while. Lightly malty caramel honey nutty flavors, with some hoppiness in the aroma. Rich, flavorful, balanced and a good beer I thought. Only one I ordered after sampling all of their beers."
"D: Decent on the drinkabilty scale, that's about all I can say about this one."
"Could drink a good amount of this, but rather not if something better was available, not my favorite Marzen but wanted to try because I have not have many gordon Biersch before, recommended next October if it is the only seasonal on the shelf at that time but I would probably not drink this one again"
"Good beer overall. Could be kicked up a little more in a couple areas to make it great, but good nonetheless."
"Bright orange in appearance with a thin head that drops. Doughy malt and gingerbread are in the smell of this brew. The taste is non-offensive, but nothing spectacular to note, it has a sweet taste of a blend of different malts. Moderate hop bitterness then kicks in to balance out the flavor. This brew is adequately carbonated, but has a thinner feel to it. Granted all this, I could happily knock down a few of these and be satisfied."
"A surprisingly balanced beer, and its served year round, much more enjoyable than many of the seasonal fest beers from the me-too crowd. If only it didn't cost so damn much at $$$6 per glass."
"Amber orange colored with an off-white head that drops quickly. Aroma of bready malt, toffee, and light brown sugar. Flavor is initially doughey malt with medium sweetness, cinnamon, ripe fruit, and some grassy undertones. Moderate mouthfeel, a bit watery upfront but bubbly and very tingly in the finish. Very drinkable, good representation of the style."
"On tap at the brewpub at the Aloha Tower. Poured crystal clear orange-amber. Faint carbonation left next-to-no head. Smelled of sweet malts and floral hops. Grape esters? Inviting. This beer had kind of a strange flavor arc -- the malts, hops, and yeast all emerge at different times and have very different characteristics. The sweet malts are the first to emerge, and they remain, mildly intot the finish. The hops are initially overshadowed by the bitter yeastiness, unusual for the style, but as it fades, they come out -- lightly spicy, lightly floral. Fairly nice, but not something I'd get regularly."
"Drinkability- IT's worth trying...once."
"Drinkability: easy to drink this - very session like. This won't blow you away but across all Gordon Biersch brewpubs this is always a consistant standard offering worth having."
"Served on draft in a pint glass in the DC location. Appearance was dark copper with hint of red, little head and no lacing. Aroma of noble hops and slight malt/caramel. Taste was reflective of the aroma, starts with a light caramel/malt flavor and ends with hop bitterness; a metallic flavor was also evident. Mouthfeel was light, low viscosity compared to other Marzens. I rate drinkability as slightly above average because this is one that can be consumed quite a bit and quite easily in a single session, although overall this Marzen seems to be missing the rich caramel malt flavor I have come to expect from the style."
"From Safeway in Eureka at $8.29 a six pack. For this price you expect something special. It poured a rich copper color with a nice off-white head that left good lacing. Fairly attractive. Nose was of malts and hops, with a smooth mouthfeel and llavors of malts. Nice finish was a touch of sweetness. Decent brew but just a little expensive for what you get."
"Not a surprising disappointment, considering that I dislike the other Gordon Biersch beers I've had. No reason to get this again, considering how many better Märzen beers there are..."
"Poured into a .5 liter stein a rich bronze with great clarity a tight well retained 1/2 finger head around with some spot lace left behind.Lightly sweet doughy malt with hints of caramel even a touch of vanilla and anice,full,rich flavors somewhat sweet and caramelly with a sweet doughy quality with hints of scotch whiskey finishing with just a touch herbal/spice.Wow pleasantly suprised I really liked this full flavored marzen beer nice medium body and enough dryness to really enjoy in amounts."
"Mild and easy to drink...nothing to write home about."
"I think this is the first of this style that I have ever tried. It was milder than I thought, but I wasn't really sure what to expect. The color was a nice redish brown, with a head that settled fairly quickly. The taste was nutty, sweet, and slightly sour. Hints of caramel and spice came through, and possibly grapefruit as well. Would have this again, as it was easy to drink and very enjoyable."
"Light in the mouth, could maybe have had a bit more body for my tastes. However, this makes it quite easy to drink. Overall, an enjoyable Marzen that is available year round and is often on sale at the grocery store. Neither the first nor last time I will drink this beer."
"The aroma is malty, sweet and sour candy-like. The taste is well balanced and the body is solid. A sweet malted caramel greats you while a mild hop comes through to crisp the rear. Mouthfeel is very smooth and drinkable. The 5.7% is a nice touch for this autumn centered brew. Nice Job Gordon!"
"Well, this is not a beer that I could like. It was ""the middle sampler", a beer in a sampler at a microbrew, that seemed average, unoffensive and taking up space on the way to the beers I love. Plus is again, freshness. Second beer from GB (this was dated 5/9/06) that tasted real fresh, very few bottled beers get the ""it's like a fresh microbrew pour"" so bonus points there."
"On tap at the Washington DC restaurant. Amber-red color with a thin off-white head. No lacing noted. Reserved aromas of toasted malt, caramel, hay and some background noble hop spiceiness. Thin, somewhat watery palate but refreshing and clean. Flavors much like the aroma; toasty malts, sweet caramels and some faint, but crisp hops. Nothing astray here, just a bit of a middle-of-the-road lightweight Marzen."
"In a GB Becker, forms a lasting one finger head, light tan. Clear copper body. Impressive here. The nose is sweet caramel, a nice hop aroma, but there's something a bit off that I can't ID. The taste is thick, somehow, very malty-rich, with low hop character. Filling. Could use better malts, I think. The mouthfeel is medium, with adequate carbonation. This is a nice interpretation of the style, but is too thick for more than one."
"D - In terms of drinkability, this brew has a lot going for it... it's light and tasty and I feel like I could pound a few of these in a night."
"The mouthfeel is fairly average; there isn't too much carbonation, but it's not flat either. It goes down fairly smoothly. This is a decently drinkable beer that I would definitely get again."
"D: Eh. Not one of my favorite marzens, thats for sure. It is what it is I suppose."
"Amber/copper colored beer with a small head and little lacing. Sweet caramel in the nose, but not a whole lot of presence. Sweet malty backbone to the flavor, finishes on a mild bitter note. Mouthfeel is smooth, but light. Malty finish. Drinkability is moderate."
"Presented as a medium amber colored beer with modest whiote head. Smell is sweet with a bit of caramel present. Taste matches the smell wiht a pleasant sweetness combined with slight caramel notes. Finisnes with a full sweet mothfeel that is not unpleasant. Good beer, but nothing great."
"very quaffable, this is not as good as I remember it, but I wasn't exactly back in Hawaii where I used to drink this either!"
"Well, this is a hard, hard, style to find a good beer in. Paulaner Octoberfest possibly being the best I've had. Well, Gordon's is second. Very well balanced, nice malty caramel upfront, with slight hop character on the back end. Nice caramel smell and medium bodied for nice texture. Drinkability is tremendous as one can pound these. Nice offering by Gordon Biersch!!"
"Dark copper color, a nice head atop. Carmel malts in the nose. Much like the Kolsch was from Gordon Biersch, with a sweetness that adds a punch to this beer, making it somewhat cloying towards the end. A little graininess in the flavor, but this is definitely a middle-of-the-road offering, inoffensive for the chain brewpub clientele."
"This is a drinkable beer. Its billed as a premium beer and Im not sure its all that, but I had several of these during the time I was in Las Vegas. I would buy it again."
"Sampled a pint on tap at the DC location. Came to the table a nice red-amber, seemed a little light for a marzen. Head quickly disappeared and left little lacing. Smelled like malt and caramel. Mouthfell as good, not thin but not heavy. Very quaffable, I could have easily pounded another 4 or 5 pints. Solid marzen, worth every penny."
"D - very drinkable brew on a normal occasion. Their best 'standard' beer IMHO."
"Sampled at the Washington DC location and enjoyed the quality and flavor of all the products that were served. 13.5 Plato and 5.7 % ABV. THe pour was a clear bright red topped with a small off white head and carried light carbonation. The nose was nice malty some crystal but not over cloying. The flavor continued the light sweetness and did not over sweeten in the finish as it dried out nicely. This was a very nice beer."
"Drinkability: Better than average, but nothing to go out of the way for."
"Not a bad Marzen I can recall drinking this quite often years ago. The balance is not bad and is rather smooth with a comfortable sour finish and aftertaste."
"All in all, a pretty good Marzen. I prefer their Blonde Bock, but this is better for the fall months."
"Gordon Biersch's Marzen is caramel-copper in color with a moderate head. The aroma is of sweet, bready malts with just a touch of spiciness. The taste has a nice caramel malt profile with a nice spice flavor that provides balance and complexity. The finish is sweet and just a bit sugary. Drinkability is great, this is easily sessionable like most of the other beers I've had from GB."
"However, the lightness did make this very easy to drink. It may be a nice session beer for some. The mouthfeel was also decent. It went great with my Dodger dog, so that is a plus!"
"Drinkability- Balance this one out and it might be OK...as it is, I'll pass next time. I shared my Fantome with groom first though, so at least we both got a good beer on that day."
"I wasn't really much of a gordon fan to begin with....but at 7.99 a 12er, it was cheaper than budwieser so why not. This marzen is drinkable and smooth... but on average on every count. It tastes to sweet for a marzen to me...this would be good party beer."
"Extremely easy to drink. I could go through several and not blink. This is ""hands down"" my favorite from GB."
"Tasted: 11/20/04"
"If I could get this for $3.99 all the time Id drink it more often., at less than a $1 a beer its not too bad. Any more than that, Ill buy something else."
"The head is small and yellow white. It sits on a clear, red beer. There's a touch of amber, but it's mostly bright red. An aroma of nuts and sugar. A little sour, too. Burnt caramel and some nuts up front. The middle turns thick with caramel and a little fruit. Very rich caramel malt when warm. The finish is a bit metallic. Sour, nutty, some alcohol. This beer is surprisingly strong tasting. It's good, but not hugely enjoyable."
"This is a full-bodied beer with a high, but still appropriate carbonation. The aftertaste is largely malt but is still dry. Overall, I like this marzen very much."
"Pours a nice cherry wood mohogany red with off white head that is average, lacing is good, froth will stick to the glass. The smell is very sugary and sweet, hints of caramel and molasses, fruity tones linger. The taste is overyly sweet, the strong carmel apple taste is nice but no hops to even out the sweetness, still not bad. Medium bodied and good for a dessert beer."
"Drinkability  This was a bit off-style but went down nicely."
"An OK beer but not a great one."
"This beer poured a clear, red-amber color with light tan foam that eventually settled. The smell was malty but rather minimal. The taste was malty with some grain elements and an ever so slight touch of sweetness in an otherwise dry beer. Not a very rich taste. The mouthfeel was dry with medium body and low carbonation. This beer was OK and was easy to drink."
"Had this one at the Washington DC location. Reddish/Auburn color, diminutive head. Some malt and spice bouquet. Sweet malt flavors with a medium hop presence, some of those Marzen spices as well. Tastes similar to this years Sam Oktoberfest. Very fresh tasting like most good brewpub beers. Pretty good, drinkable, and went well with my Marzen BBQ chicken sandwich."
"Light brown color, medium white foamy head. Aroma is malty and slightly sweet. Lightly roasted malts, somewhat hoppy, kind of dry. Malt flavor is pronounced and slightly sweet. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is dry and crisp. Aftertaste is malty and slightly sweet."
"A bit sour to want more than a couple, but a good beer, quite serviceable. I have not had many Marzens since last winter, so I'm not sure that I'm in the best position to judge the extent to which it matches up to standard; however, if you come across this beer someplace, it's not a bad beer at all, and certainly beats the macros that you are apt to find alongside it."
"Originally sampled on 6 August 2002. I am writing this review from my notes. Nice amber color, good malt flavor, easy to drink. This is a very enjoyable session beer. As a general comment, as with all the Gordon Biersch beers I've had over the years, this was far better than anything BMC offers, but nothing compared to a good micro"
"I would think that this would be a good beer for a Killians Red drinker..to discover micros"
"I found this beer very appetizing. Nice amber color with a creamy head gives off a good impression. Smells of sweet malt, with a touch hops. Taste is also nice- malty upfront, which turns into a mellow lager like taste. Very light on the tounge, but full of flavor. Easily solid beer, for all drinking seasons."
"A light amber body with an OK white head. There is very lace from this beer. Light body and only a small amount of aroma, mostly malt. The flavor is quite sweet with a very mild mouthfeel. This is a very drinkable beer that seems to err on the side of caramel malt. There is not much balance to this beer."
"This is the first beer I tried from GB and I was pretty excited, until I poured it. Very little head which is ok excpet there was absolutely no head retention. By the time I got about half way done there was no head at all and I was drinking flat beer. I liked the color, very full red/amber look. Begins with a mildly dry taste and explodes into an overly sweet finish with little bittnerness. The aroma is sweet with a hint of hops but not enough to get the mouth watering."
"Translucent deep amber to copper color on the pour, the head is unpresumptuous in size, the texture creamy, the color light tan and the resultant lace nice fine clinging sheets. The smell of sweet malt dominates the nose, citrus crisp and fresh, quite pleasant. Start is malt and lightly sweet on the palate, the top middling in mouth feel, the finish perkily acidic, purposeful in its hop presence, dry and lingering aftertaste, a good beer not overpowering in any category, one that would make a fine session beer."
"GB have established an increadible distribution network (they even have a chain brewpub in one of the Vegas casinos now) and that's what sells this beer. Their pamphlets state that Mr. Gordon acquired his brewing skills at the Weihenstehpan school in Bavaria in the late 1970's. I don't know what's happened between now and then, but I could leave a bottle of Weihenstephaner Dunkel-weiss (or any other Weihenstephaner beer) in my car's back windshield for a month and it would still taste better than the best Gordon Biersch beers. It's a shame GB hasn't turned the corner and started producing really great beers."
"This is a pretty mediocre beer across the board, but it's available at the local ballparks and beats (at least slightly) the usual budmillercoors.  The flavor is decidedly bland but not altogether unpleasant.  On the positive side, they go down fairly well on a sunny warm afternoon."
"A very smooth brew but not very flavorful. head goes away quick and lace was O.K. at best. Drinkability gets a decent number for the smoothness but this is one micro company I have never been impressed with."
"Well-rounded and smooth Marzen for my money. I haven't had many Marzens but if this is the standard I am impressed. Gordon Biersch does a good job of retaining their microbrew sesnibilities as they continue to expand across the USA."
"I had on tap at the San Francisco location. Brown-reddish color, slight thin head that left quickly. The smell seemed very sour and somewhat stale, didn't get any of the sweet smells others mentioned. The maltness was there, but the whole beer was overpowered by a stale, sour, flatness. I was really dissapointed after going out of my way to find the place. Maybe I had a bad beer, and shouldn't review it, I considered that, but I told them at the pub, and they should be held accountable for serving lousy beer."
"Not a bad beer. It's got nice coloration, but I've seen better. It's also got a smooth mouthfeel and a nice sweet finish."
"Fruity taste and smell.  Crisp and clean.  Clear in the glass.  Amber with a strong tint of red.  Almost no head is left after a minute of pour.  Very slight hops presence, but it's pushed way back in favor of the fruity/malt notes.  Good average quality brew."
