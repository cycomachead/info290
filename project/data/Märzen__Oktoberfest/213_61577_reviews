"O: Overall a sweet oktoberfest style lager. Not something for mass consumption, a bit overly sweet for multiples, but best left in small appreciable quantities. single purchase."
""
"Deep orangy amber. Scents of sweet honey, and malty goodness. Sweet earthy malty mellowness that rolls smoothly down the back of the pallet.  The perfect amount of carbonation- latent yet not drowned by the malt. It breathes fall."
""
"Six from Total Wine in Plantation.  Good Oktoberfest...."
""
""
""
"Want a Marzen but only have 6 bucks? This. Above avg Oktoberfest in tall boys for the right price. Would choose this over any low-end marzen (and cheap beers in general)."
""
""
"Gansett gets better and better!"
""
"Drank from can but have had many. Not a big fan of Marzens but this is the exception.  Orange somewhat clear. God carbonation. Kind of dry. Good hops. Citrusy spicy hops. Almost IPA like. A little sweetness. My favorite of the Oktoberfest style of beers. Have not had a beer from Narragansett that I did not like"

"Overall: One of Narragansett's best in my opinion, and a traditional beer they make quite well. If I were to have an Oktoberfest party, this is one beer I wouldn't mind buying in quantity for guests. A good Oktoberfest. Above average."
""
""
"O: A decent beer for what it is: a cheap Octoberfest."

"Nice Oktoberfest brew, malty, semi-sweet, a nice head that sticks around with patchy foam islands like foam on the sea."

"First time having this brand but was pleasantly surprised with a very nice Oktoberfest style. I enjoyed it but not at the top of my list for Oktoberfest beers this year."
""
""
"Appearance was a deep orange with a lot of head but settled quickly. The smell was very interesting with more sweet notes than I was expecting such as vanilla and caramel as well as the classic toasted malt smell. The taste was very refreshing with earthy tones starting off blending into sweeter flavors into the finish. Really enjoyed this one."
"Taste / Palate: The flavor is classic German lager all the way. It has a fresh bready maltiness loaded with a nutty, caramel and nougat like character. Hops adds a light earthy dryness and bitterness. The feel is right on for the style and very drinkable."

"Overall: This is definitely worth seeking out among the parade of marzens that hits the market every fall. It stands out because of it's malt-forward character and because it's a pretty solid buy (six tallboys for around $9-$10). The sweetness is there but it's far from overpowering. I paired this with pupusas, plantains and rice & beans and it was perfect; I love pairing Latin American food with German-style lagers. I'd have this again for sure - next time probably in season (found it on sale among fall remainders)."

"O: This was pretty tasty for an Oktoberfest beer. There are others around that are better. But still, there's nothing wrong with this one. If it were available here, I'd grab some when I was in the mood."

"Pours a brilliantly clear deep reddish brown with a nice fluffy off white head that persists forever. Smells of caramel and candy sugar with hints of prune and raisin and a touch of carmelization. Little to no hop aroma. The flavor is sweet with brown sugar countered by a light burnt sugary taste. Light dried fruits and a hint of earth. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. I was quite impressed with this beer, although I went in with low expectations. It's a touch on the sweet side for my tastes, but its got a wonderful melanoid flavor and aroma as well as the dried fruits. Color me pleasantly surprised."

"UPDATE: 2014. The beer seems much improved this year. The sweetness is toned down, the hops balance the malt now. This is good beer."
""
"Overall: Pretty standard octoberfest beer. A bit light and was looking for a bit more sweetness and bready notes."
""
"The beer pours a deep, candied orange, close to amber. The beer pours with an aggressive head of yellowing bubbles that form a creamy canopy over the beer about two fingers high. The head lasts for quite some time, but when it dissipates, splotches of fluffy foam are left behind. In body the beer is clean yet dark, with a steady stream of carbonation from the bottom of the glass. A dark haze is present in the beer, but the other side of the glass is visible. On the nose, the beer smells of buttery caramel malts. Cooked biscuits and toffee swim thickly onto the nose and leave a sticky sense in the nostrils. Faint, spicy hops and grass play at the fringes of the beer’s smell. Dactyl seems to be present in the beer, but I find it inviting with the sweet smell of the malts. On the tongue, the beer tastes bready sweet with definite dactyl touches and a soft, building bitter that is slightly spicy. Faint salinity can also be found in the malt character, and light acidity gives light tartness at the very finish. The balance of this beer is off and lies slightly in the sweet section, though the bitters do wonders for drying out the finish of the beer. In flavor, the beer begins as rich toffee and buttered biscuits. Caramel, maple syrup, and rich breads play across the palate as the flavor slowly swings to the bitter end with dry grass, spicy hay and faint green tea. The finish is smooth caramel with touches of bitter grass, but the aftertaste is mostly of grass and soft dirt. In the mouth, the beer feels creamy and syrupy with a medium-plus body and a middling carbonation that works to try and keep the beer’s sweetness in check. The mouth is left sticky with saliva on the cheeks and a sticky sweet feeling on the tongue. Overall, this is not the worst Oktoberfest by a long shot. It is sweet and pleasing, and not unpleasant to put back. That paired with its cheap price makes it actually desirable. If you want a Marzen for cheap, this is a good option, though I still prefer Jack’s Abby’s Copper Legend."
""
"Overall its a real good Marzen beer that is certainly worth a try. Reasonable price, great drinkability."
""
"Overall it's a decent marzen to add to the pile. No harm no foul."

"Not being a huge fan of the style, I find this drinkable when cold and not undrinkable as it warms. A bit too grassy and lacking some crispness, but good nonetheless."
""
"O: This is an enjoyable enough oktoberfest lager. There are better examples of the style, but when you want your German malts in a 16oz can, look no further."
"I want one of those beastly tankards Gambrinus is sportin' on the can. X-Mas ideas, folks! Anyway, this stuff pours a clear copper topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises banana, buttery biscuit, and a vague sense of some sort of citrus rind. The taste focuses on a slightly less blurry version of the citrus, and everything else comes through watered-down and whatnot. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, an okay beer at best, one that seems like a severely weakened version of the classic German style. It's not bad, really, but I wouldn't buy another if presented with the opportunity."
""
""
""
""
"Would I buy it again? Yes."
""
""
"Overall not bad, not great but not as bad as I thought for a somewhat macro like style lager."
""
""
""
"O: This is a pretty decent Octoberfest. Not mind blowing, and not the most authentic, but it's an easy quaff that certainly hits the spot. This beer is on par with pretty much all the other Narragansett beers I've had; it isn't style-topping stuff, but you feel happy as a consumer because you certainly got what you paid for. It is of perfectly sound quality for a beer that comes in the tall boy can format at $8 a 6-pack."
""
""
"O- Another rock solid American take on the Ocktoberfest style beer."
"Overall a well rounded Octoberfest."
"I'm spoiled because my go-to Oktoberfest is now Staghorn, but this was nice with good flavors and a clean finish, nothing wrong here."
"RJT"
"Might make a good lawnmower beer, but not my typical purchase"
""
"Thin and spritzy, but the flavor is rich. Malty with a bit of biscuit, brown sugar and dark cherry. Low hop presence; shows up on the swallow but doesn't stay for long in the aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's overall very nice. I'd be happy to drink this a lot."

""

"O: This beer is pleasantly smooth and is a good representation of the style. It wouldn’t be a bad choice to throw some of these cans into a cooler for a fall football tailgate party."
"Overall, this is decent fare, and surprisingly flavorful for a beer that only clocks in at 5.5% ABV. A few extra doses of grain and sugar would have made for a more potent drinking experience, but if you’re looking for a good lunchtime brew that won’t get you hammered before the afternoon shift, this is a good candidate."
""
"Notes: Well it's drinkable but very unique for a Marzen. Cheers."
""
"Reddish-orange in color with a slight chill haze. Poured with a thick, rocky white foam that slowly reduced to a wispy cap. Toasted malt and herbal hop aromas with a hint of tart fruit in the background. Medium bodied with pleasant carbonation and a semi-dry finish. Sweet bready and grainy malt flavors up front that quickly segue to spicy/herbal hoppiness through the middle to the end. Sweet malty flavors continue beneath. Finishes with a lingering bitter hop aftertaste. A little hoppier than most marzens but a good beer nonetheless."
""
""
"Toasted grains quickly yield to caramelly, bready malt sweetness. Cookie dough mid palate. Lightly bitter, spicy hop bite in the finish. Lots of lingering caramelly malt goodness. Moderate body, with a smooth feel. A tasty, nicely made Ofest."
""
"Mouthfeel is also very nice- medium body, light to moderate prickly carbonation, a nice long finish with sweetness and a little hop presence. I like it- it tastes better and is better priced than many of the American oktoberfests out there."
"overall this is one of my fav seasonals"
"overall - probably my my favorite oktoberfest beer right behing Ayinger. easy to find but only sold by the 6 pack (tallboy cans). Love this beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very easy to drink and enjoyable, could easily be sessionable and it was very easy to drink the 16 oz can of this one. A solid example of the style from a brewery that I have enjoyed all the beers I have tried (and all available at very reasonable prices in cans)."
"Dark copper with a big white head that quickly rises in the glass. Aromas are bready malt with a bit of sweet caramel. Flavor profile is mostly toasted bread but enough of an herbal character to call this beer balanced. Mouthfeel is medium and good carbonation. At roughly $8.99 for a 6er of tall cans, and considering the fact that I can sit here and drink this all day, I'll definitely be reaching for this one again. Awesome brew."

"This is a fairly decent and authentic brew for the style, with a malt based body and some buttery and toasty flavors in the aftertaste and a bit of 'metalmouth' as well. The overall creaminess of the texture is high, just like the flagship brew from these guys. Must be something in the water up there. For a drinkable sixer of tall boys, you could do a lot worse."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - A solid Oktoberfest, but nothing to get too excited about. Was plenty easy to drink the 16oz can - I'm sure these are great for camping or summer at the beach."
"Interesting that they abandoned the ""Oktober"" and just made it ""Fest."" Well, it's a good example of a Fest, and you gotta love those tall boy cans."
""
""
""
"O: Not bad, but not great either. I've never been a huge fan of the style but this one is okay. I could maybe see myself getting it again next fall."
"A nice deep, clear orangey amber with a decent white head that leaves some streaks of lace here and there. Aromas of light orange fruitiness and cinnamon laced pepper. Nice bread and toasted grains. A touch of Sazz hops spiciness. Taste is malty and smooth like a good fest brew with caramel and toasted grains in large supply. A touch of butterscotch in the back with a clean dry finish. Light bread flavors lingering. Feel is gently carbonated with a medium weight that gives an easy drinkability. A nice version that is quite satisfying."
"Tasty and malty. Smooth and easy drinking. Bread notes, nutty notes. Some hop dryness late and in the finish...Not bad, pretty good for beer in a can. But basically a middle of the road Octoberfest."
"Cheers!"
"O: Goes down easy, tasty, not too filling, mild kick, ok representation of style. This is a decent beer that is very affordable."
"Cheers!!!"
"Overall: I really liked this beer, what impressed me more is that a marzen in a can is hard to come by, yet Narragansett nailed this one on the nose. A very nice balance overall between the hops and those crisp, autumnal malt notes that make this beer perfect for a cold autumn night in New England. At 5.5% it's very sessionabble & I only paid $7.99 for 6 16oz cans - how can you beat that?"
"O -- A pretty good stab at the style from this resurrected brewery."
"O: Not a bad beer at all. Very enjoyable on this fall evening while watching some baseball. If I could get it regularly in the fall I definitely would."
"While this certainly wasn’t the most memorable O-Fest that I’ve ever had, it was a pretty good bang-for-the-buck, as I think that I paid like $8 for this six-pack of 16 oz cans. This is pretty good for what it is."
"Final impression: A solid example of the style. A four pack would make a good session brew before a football game. I would pick this over most other Oktos."
"This is a tasty, easy drinking beer. A great example of what an autumn beer should taste like."
"Malty with a hint of sweetness. Carmel. The beer is very well balanced in terms of malt and bitterness. The hops and malt work together to leave my tongue simultaneously. My perfect Octoberfest lager as it's not cloyingly sweet or a malt bomb. Grab a Gansett!"
"The body is medium and the carbonation is soft. A somewhat creamy feel. Overall another solid seasonal from these guys."
"Pours an orange-copper with a one-finger thin, tan head. Aroma of sweet caramel, candied sugar, toffee and hints of toasted grain. Flavor beings with a subtle kick of tart fruit (apple, pear) and toasted grains before moving into a silky smooth, sweet, sticky and delicious caramel malt. Other notes of toffee and nuttyness mix well in the malt before some spicy hop notes and more toasted grain to finish. Very sessionable oktoberfest with an awesomely blended flavor and great mouthfeel."
"Value: You can't beat this, I found a sixer of tall boys for like 8 bucks."
"Nothing to complain about with this one."
"A clear copper color with a decent white cover and lots of lacing. The aroma offers a crisp, light fruity wheat. The flavor delivers a fruit nougat malt with some flowery hops notable but mostly it’s a bright malt theme that refreshes with peppery carbonation. It’s closer to light bodied than medium, very drinkable yet packing a good deal of flavor with a dry, hop grain finish. A pleasant surprise from a 16 ounce can!"
"Pours medium amber, light colored. Thick creamy white foam that lasts and lasts. Very sticky. Malty smell. Clean light lagery taste, watery. Mild hop closes but barely noticeable. So an easy drinker, but not terribly flavorful. Good, though."
"In retrospect the lack of a line should have clued me in that no one wants this stuff."
"O-not bad. i know this style isn't know for flavor and this beer no flavor even relative to the style. easy drinking though."
"Overall, its a solid marzen & the fact that its canned is a hell of a bonus. At $1.79 for a pint, I'd drown in this lager a happy man."
"O- Overall, I thought this was a pretty bad beer. I wouldn't purchase this one again."
"Another winning American Oktoberfest brew... I've quite a few as of late. This brew pours a gorgeously radiant amber and is capped with a filmy white head that deposits a surprising amount of spotty lace upon the glass' wall. The nose is fairly aromatic, offering biscuity, caramel-y notes and a hint of general nuttiness. The flavor is more directly nutty, fairly doughy-biscuity, and has restrained sweetness despite having much of its basis in sweet-type flavors such as caramel and toffee. The feel shows a great balance between creaminess and toothy body, and refreshing, mouth-watering drinkability. This is one of the best surprises I've had in a while, and I will certainly be drinking more of this."
"Clear amber with a two inch cap of fluffy, beige foam. Good head retention, some clumpy and sticky lacing. Malty aroma, a little sweet with notes of caramel and toasted bread, sort of doughy. A little sweeter in flavour than I expected - bitterness was hard pressed to keep pace - but still tasty. Bread and caramel, light toastiness, and faint leafy hops. It seemed like a hint of spiciness or alcohol was present in the finish, along with a lingering mineral character. Texture was nice, smooth with some heft to the body, lowish carbonation. Overall, I quite enjoyed it."
"Poured from a pounder can into a pint glass, the beer is a bright, vibrant copper coloring that is slightly hazy, and has little to no head. The beer has a spicy and bread/toast like aroma, which is very enticing. Good cling to the glass while you drink, the beer has a sweet, rich caramel malt flavor, with a heavy dose of nutmeg and cinnamon spicing that cuts the sweetness and warms you while you drink. The beer is creamy smooth in mouth, and gives you a malty tang on the aftertaste, with nutmeg and pumpkin throughout. The full bodied brew gives a slightly lingering, creamy finish. Very flavorful beer."
"O: This isn't a beer I would ordinarily come back to, but at $8 for a six-pack of pint cans (at New York prices), it's a solid value."
"O - a good American example of the style."
"A disappointing marzen/fest beer. Their maibock is a quality brew and it would have been nice to incorporate that beer into a marzen. They got the color right but missed on the flavor."
"One of the best American Märzen I've had. And it's a great value! Go Gansett!"
"-OtheRed"
"Not bad, low price and availability will probably make this somewhat of a fall standard for me."
"O: A clean Oktoberfest, not heavily spiced but not boring."
"O: This is a great octoberfest that helps to bring in the fall season. It is very crisp and refreshing, especially on a cool 75˚ evening"
"The smell and taste pretty much match up with a grainy, whole wheat sort of flavor to it. But there is something lacking in the taste. It's like a slight mis-balance in the flavor, and nothing really compliments each other in it. There is a real hint of spice too, but again, it just doesn't mix correctly. The aftertaste is much better than the 'during' taste, with a nice cereal style after taste to it. That is the only part I really liked about it. If I were to describe this in one word, it would be ""meh"". Their summer was a much better seasonal than this. My suggestion to this one is, drink it cold. It tastes worse when it is warmer."
"A pretty darn good Oktoberfest, which was unexpected from Narragansett for me. I will certainly have this again."
"Poured a brilliant bronze into a 1/2 liter stein,a large fluffy white crown atop,Oktoberfest beer for my money are the prettiest beers out there.Caramel malt and light toast in the nose,I would like a little more depth to not only the aromas but the flavors as well.Sweet and somewhat doughy with light drying in the finish,with a little more crispness this would be top notch,as is its decent.Not a bad O-fest beer,for $5.99 a six pack of 16oz cans its awesome,Narragansett is actually some good shit."
"O: This is a smooth, easy drinking fest lager. Another solid seasonal from these guys. Also comes in tall boys and is priced very well. Solid fall beer and a repeat seasonal purchase for me."
"A solid lager for autumn at a good price point. Just a bit too sweet though."
" wow, what a nice surprise!"
"This is a decent lager and for $8.49 a sixer of tall boys 'Fest' is a good one to go to from time to time when in a pinch."
"O/D-Pretty good. Maybe my least favorite of their seasonals but I also do not love the style that much either. Unspectacular but for $7.99 for a 6-pack of 16 oz. cans; I cannot complain."
"Not bad, and better than expected. Can't compete with German and many good domestics, but not a bad brew."
"O: Another good offering from Narragansett. They'll rise again if they can continue to produce cheap but good beer like this."
"From a pounder can - Sweet! Mellow munich malts in the aroma: caramelly goodness. Nice thin layer of white foam sits on top of this slightly reddish - tinted looking beer. Not dark red, but like a red ale light. Mellow, smooth munich -like malts come thru and are followed up with sweet caramel, all balanced very well. A very slight hop bitterness lingers. This beer has a mouthfeel that hints at creaminess - very nice. Overall a very nice beer that is well balanced. Did not expect this judging from their regular lager. A real smooth, easy - drinking treat that come at a good price too."
"Perhaps I would like this more if it was later in the season, its my first octoberfest seasonal of the year so maybe I'm adjusting but I wasnt overly impressed. Must agree with another poster that it has a macro feel to it. Its solid and within style, I could use a bit more spiceness/comlexity. This would go great on a autumn afternoon with football on the screen though. Worth trying but their are better options out there."
"O/D: Given the ABV to taste ratio, you can enjoy this all day. Another winner from Narragansett."
"A decent marzen that will probably please fans of Narragansett's other offerings. I can honestly say that I've had better examples though. It's a start."
"This poured out as a dark orange color with a fizzy white head on top. The lacing is light but actually has some nice scattered bubbles that stick to the glass. The smell of the beer smells like a typical German lager, with a minor crisp hop aroma too. The taste of this beer has a really nice caramel flavor to it, but doesn't have too much spice. The mouthfeel is very smooth and drinkable. Overall this beer is pretty good. I enjoyed having it."
"Smells veery sweet with toffee, caramel aromas. Very malty and lightly hopped. Not very bitter tasting the taste follows through in this fantastic, easy-drinking Oktoberfestbier. Beers like this is one of the reasons I anticipate the fall. People complain aout the early arrival of seasonals, but for those of us who adore the autumn, cheers! A lighter-bodied beer with sufficient carbonation. Try it! It's great!"
"Give this fest beer a try one of the best fest beers that is highly drinkable."
"Clear amber with a thick frothy white head that descends into a thin coating, sitting atop the beer for the entire glass. The aroma is of sweet bread and soft caramel and toffee, not much hop presence. The tastes follows with some nice buttery bread, though the taste isn't overpowering at all, very subtle. Biscuit, caramel, toffee are all present but this beer does a good job of not becoming overly sweet. It's light to medium bodied, almost too light, and finishes slightly dry. While the body is a bit too light for my taste it also makes this beer go down easily and quickly. Overall, a quality beer at a nice price point that I'll probably go back to several more times before winter rolls through."
"poured from 16oz. can clear orange/copper color large head that stayed well and good covering of lace. smell is a little weak but pleasant. taste is sweet and malty reminded me of rock candy with hints of toffee smooth light to medium mouthfeel lots of carbonation that holds up well. oktoberfest beer is not one of my favorite styles of beer to drink but this was very enjoyable and i will look for it again."
"From 16 oz. can no. 2061-2157. 2011 season. Sampled on August 15, 2011. It pours an attractive looking pale to medium amber with a mammoth frothy, foamy head that never completely fades away. The malts express themselves in grand fashion on the nose with a more subtle, beckoning hop note on the backside. The body averages about light to medium. The taste begins with a strong caramel sweetness and then there is this clean, crisp hopped finale to balance it out. This was very easy to drink and true to the style. I liked it."
"fantastic fest bier! one of my favorites! i think it got even better this year. recommended."
"I have to note that I am really not a fan of the Märzen / Oktoberfest style. I had to give this a chance because all of the other Narragansett seasonals have been way better than anticipated. This is pretty average for the style. Overall, it's a little too sweet for me."
"Overall while not my favorite fest beer of the season, it was definitley drinkable."
"D-taste gone in no time"
"drinkable, very."
"Aroma of caramel malt, biscuit grains and yeast, and mildly aromatic/medicinal hops - very clean smell. Taste is very crisp - caramel and barley combined with clean yeast for a biscuity taste. Hops add a slightly medicinal and bitter edge, matching the malt and yeast. Overall the taste is extremely crisp and clean, as well as the feel. Very drinkable, one of the better picks of its style this year."
"Tallboy poured into a pint glass. Pours a clear dark orange with a thin whit head on top. Dissipates quickly; no lace. The nose is pretty basic with hints of caramel, toasted malt, and some graham cracker. The mouth is a little harsher in carbonation than I'd like. Definitely spritzy. There's some heft to the body though. Flavors start out with a sweet caramel, light roasted malts, and a bit of alcohol on the finish. Clean finish. This wasn't my favorite Festbier of the season, but it's not bad. I'd gladly have it again."
"The Crack & Glug netted me two fingers of thick, tawny head with great retention. Color was a stunning orangish-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was an interesting mix of grassy hop and caramel malt sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a big caramel taste on the tongue. This was pretty close to the style although many modern iterations are going for a dryer quality (Victory Fest), which is what I prefer. Finish was likewise relatively sweet with a definite caramel taste that lingered. Not bad, but not my favorite CANned O'fest, either."
"This can looks fantastic in my fridge and this beer looks fantastic in my glass. Frothy, airy eggshell-colored head sits atop a beer that looks like fall- copper and reminiscent of dark amber honey. Foam doesn't last long however and is just about completely gone by the time I take my first sip. Aroma is true to the style- dry, grassy, bready. Taste is clean and malty; sure, there is a bit of sweetness there but the hops have a little more punch that your typical Octoberfest. For me that makes all the difference in drinkability. Carbonation is nice and high, and that touch of hops bitterness means I could drink these tallboys all day and night. Will be sad when this beer's season ends..."
"m+d- highly drinkable, not your traditional Oktoberfest. but a decent brew. inexpensive,"
"The appearance is a nice copper color with a one finger head, that quickly dissipates and leaves a small ring. Smell has notes of malt, hops, sugar. The taste contains more of the malt, with some spices on the profile, and a bitter aftertaste. Carbonation seems appropriate for the style, along with some breadiness to it, and earthy overall. Drinkability on this newer offering from the folks at `Gansett is solid. I wish that I had bought some more, will have to do exactly that in the near future."
"D: Very drinkable, this was a nice balanced oktoberfest with a moderate abv and good taste and feel."
"Taste starts with nutty malts, a light fruitiness in the middle, then closes with peppery alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is reasonably smooth, and drinkability is pretty good as well. Some more malt character and depth of flavor would push this one to the next level."
"I always drink out of a glass used for BEER ONLY! It was chilled to 32 degrees and dumped into a wet glass. Great copper color. As it was consumed it held the head all the way to the bottom of the glass. The flavor and smoothness increases as the beer warms in the glass. I think Gansett hit a home run. Now if we could only get this stuff in New Hampshire."
"A damn shame because the look and smell were very promising, but after that it got pretty terrible. Not worth finishing, bleh."
"16oz Tall Boy. Pours a dark burnt orange with a quickly disappearing head. Some lacing. Aroma is of caramel with some malts. Somewhat sweet. Taste is more sweet caramel. Roasted malts as well and some spice to it. Hard to put into words but it just has that great Oktoberfest beer taste. Certainly drinkable and I'm loving drinking an Oktoberfest out of a 16oz can. I must admit that Narragansett is my Go-to lager, but with the recent additions of the Porter and now 'Fest I'm hoping that this is the start of a trend of new beers by 'Gansett. Worth buying, no question."
"D - Wow, this is an amazing session beer. Cant get over how good this beer is. Did this really come from not only a can, but a Narragansett can?! Definately worth the pickup. An amazing macro take on this style. Holy cow."
"A fresh tasting O-fest, enough stride to pull away from the middle of the pack."
"D: This is a decent American Marzen from Narragansett. The macro-adjunct flavor is fairly well masked so it isn't a big turnoff for me, and these went down easy. And $7.99 for a 6pk of 16oz cans makes this one a great value."
"A highly drinkable light amber brew with a frothy tan head and light to medium carbonation. Aroma is lightly sweet and malty. Flavor is quite nice with a good malty backbone excellently balanced by the hops. A very drinkable and enjoyable fall beer. Good going guys!"
"D: Nice easy going beer, love the price $7.99 for sixer of 16oz. cans. Finishes a little harsh on the throat, but otherwise could see anyone being able to down a couple."
"Not an amazing Octoberfest by any means, but an amazing fest for the price."
"Drinkability is just average. Not the best example of the style I've ever had. I don't think I'd want a six-pack of these."
"D: Gansett Fest's finest attributes are its clean look, smooth feel and fine balance of flavors. The 5.5% ABV puts it right in a sessionable territory and the tallboys are a bonus. That said, it either tastes like it was made with adjuncts or just not the same quality of malts you'll taste in more established American marzen lagers. Overall, it's a great value and a good Oktoberfest beer. Prost to RI!"
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a very solid beer that is worth drinking for a very long time."
"The taste is not where it needs to be. This is a fairly light bodied beer with a malty back bone, definitely a touch of caramel, but with a spicy bite and an overprocessed feel. The finish is just a bit metallic, flat, and unappealing. It loses some of its sweetness in the finish as as the settles in. The reddish caramel flavors are decent but compromised by some of the off flavors towards the finish. As with most macro type lagery beers, the taste starts to diminish when the beer warms and some adjunct maybe presenting itself."
"mouthfeel is workin on this one, it has a smooth sweet flow. very drinkable...it's like a more flavorful bigger bodied gansett..it does taste too simaler to the original tho"
"Would I buy more of it? - I would. A six-pack of 16 oz. cans is going for about $8 here in New England. Very affordable for a quality brew."
"Yea, this beer reminds me of a Hacker Oktoberfest. But stands on its own as a great addition to the fall beer offerings found on New England shelves. Nice to see a new Ofest, rather than yet another pumpkin ale."
"As I pointed to early, I like drinking this beer and it almost just reminds me of a regular tall can. Enjoyable beer, but not up there in the top ""fest"" beers(nor I was expecting it to be while buying it)"
"D: Easy and sweet. I'll enjoy this beer this autumn."
"As a homebrewer i can appreciate an unbalanced beer for its uniqueness, but for a marketed product the flavor profile should be more cohesive."
"16oz. can served in a tumbler. Pours a translucent copper with a loose, one inch, cream-colored head pockmarked with ringlets and tiny craters. Head slowly recedes into a fairly consistent slick of foam, leaving delicate strands and slashes of lacing, but exhibiting weak adhesion. Nose reveals a light malt profile (perhaps some caramel), a mild aromatic hops quality and a trace of grain and citric acid. Taste follows nose - some sweetness expressed at the start, with a light citrus character close behind and a dry, somewhat cleansing, light hop character at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-bodied, but an assertive carbonation gives it a crispness and a little more texture to the mouthfeel. A very drinkable Märzen. Not your typical malty, sweet example of the style, but solid and quite drinkable. A fairly accessible offering for those new to this style of beer."
