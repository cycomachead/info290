I can drink several of these puppies in a row, to a nice comfortable effect.  Not overpowering, but not weak either.  It strikes a pretty good balance overall.","Doctor_Bogenbroom","0"

The taste is sweet up front with some candied grape flavor followed by grain and bread. Finish is sweet with mild dryness to finish. Mouthfeel is light and well carbonated. Overall, this Oktoberfest leans towards the sweet end of the spectrum.","homebrew311","Oct 18, 2014"

3.56,4.7,4,3,3.5,4,4,"330 ml bottle into dimpled mug, best before 5/28/2014. Pours slightly cloudy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of honey, bread, cracker, pear, apple, grape, floral, grass, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Ok aromas with solid balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with decent strength. A bit too much yeast fruitiness in the nose. Taste of honey, bread, cracker, light caramel, floral, grass, pear, apple, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Slight herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of honey, bread, cracker, light caramel, floral, grass, pear, apple, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish. Nice balance and robustness of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a good Oktoberfest style. Good balance and robustness of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 13, 2013"

The taste has that familiar Oktoberfest (munich malt) sweetness but with a lighter more bubbly mouthfeel. Based on the color, mouthfeel and taste I would classify this as a Oktoberfest-lite. Still quite good but not as complex and rich as a traditional OF. I love OF but they can get a bit heavy after a few. I think this would be a good beer for people who prefer lighter beers or if you are really planning to trow down. I like it, not as an OF but if I wanted something a bit heavier than a pils.","kgotcher","Sep 04, 2013"

The nose comprises biscuit, toffee, grass, a touch of butter, and a few sprinklings of mild greens. The taste brings in more of the same, but ups the grass and greens and adds a touch of orange peel. Still, the dry, buttery biscuit steals the show. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a decent O-Fest, but I'd put it in the lower echelon of those from the Fatherland.","TMoney2591","Nov 05, 2012"

Hoppage was on the light side with some fruity and leafy presence. The flavor opened with lemon zest and almost oaky sourness on the tip of the tongue. Syrupy sweetness rolled in and ended up supporting a bit more of the lemon and some spicy bitterness. Finished sweet with caramel and corn.

Poured into tall glass - nice head with lots of small bubbles below - very lively carbonation. Head held for a little while then drops to small white ring round the edges. Smell is very pleasant and nice- smells like a nice fall day. The first beer i ever had was in Germany - in high school and this took me there. Also made me think of a beer garden in the early cool fall and made me want to sit outside the rest of the day.... Color is light light amber or darker yellow depending on light. First sip is great - very balanced malt and biscuit/yeasty flavor. Taste like an early fall day somehow. Very lively mouthfeel followed by something spicy or clove... lingers as well and is very pleasant. Another review said this beer was elegant and I would have to agree. This is exactly what i hoped for from a German Octoberfest beer. Thinking of it now - this is exactly what i wish more American beers would go for - simple and GOOD, very clean but lively at the same time- this is what Bud/Miller/Coors should taste like. This is a great beer for sitting in the back yard, enjoying the day and waiting of October to get here. Will get again - soon...","titusgroan","Jun 29, 2009"

The Warsteiner also needs pouring into a glass to open its flavors up, and it can seem a tad sharp and wallpaper-cleaner tasting sipped out of a bottle--but enough reservations--shove them out of the way. This is a very mature tasting Oktoberfest beer with a nice balance of grain flavors with moderate sharpness, a bare touch of sweetness--balanced as a $300 Mont Blanc pen--a strong (as in, nice-to-have) grain fundament is in the flavor. On in its own terms (that is, if it the first beer you get, and in a glass), it is one of the best beers of this autumn. I have tasted no American Okt beer remotely like this, though, I have to say.

It looks like a classic marzen, with a deep auburn transparent color that almost glows in the late summer light. But, unlike many marzens, this one pours an outstanding soft white head that pumps up to three fingers deep, and has great retention over a leisurely quaff, leaving a lovely diffuse lacing on the glass as you go. Through the head, a soft but pronounced fruity bouquet entices you to allow your nose to linger over the glass. The flavor on the palate does not disappoint, with a malty semi-sweet character quickly evolving into pure malt on the front and middle of the palate, but finishing with a slight hoppy transient bitterness that subsides to leave the malt persistent in the aftertaste. The full smooth mouthfeel combines with a perfect carbonation that makes this beer very drinkable. This beer is perfect for the late-summer waning heat, as the evenings prolong into the early autumn coolness.

3.53,3.8,3.5,3,4,3,3.5,"On tap a pint at Pizza Plant. Fresh with abundant lace and white head, apple juice appearance of body. Taste is a bit complex, with fruity toasty nutty malty character. Nothing tremendous. Fizzy carbonation detracted. Ayinger was superior vertical on Octoberfest.","Sammy","Beers"
2.97,-12.6,3.5,4,2.5,3,2.5,"A decent beer, at best, but there are most definitely better versions out there - produced both here and in Germany.","Sixpoint","0"
2.9,-14.7,3,3,2.5,3,3.5,"Pours golden amber in color with a frothy white head that soon fades into a thin lace. Nose is sweet malt along with some grassy notes. Taste has some sweet caramel malt along with fresh grain and some herbal hop bitterness. Quite light for the style. Not terrible, but there are better Oktoberfests to be had.","Morris729","Sep 18, 2006"
4.07,19.7,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"One of the many beers I got to sample at the Oktoberfest Zinzinnati. Very good Oktoberfest beer. Medium brown in color but appeared to be fairly clear. Drinking out of plastic fest cups, so difficult to get a full read on the appearance. Smell was nice, lightly hopped, semi-sweet aroma. Flavor had a nice slightly malty sweetness with a touch of roastiness. Very easy drinking and light mouthfeel.","Generik420","Aug 28, 2006"
3.41,0.3,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall a decent German macro Oktoberfest. Certainly not as complex of a malt profile as other offerings, but certainly drinkable.","plaid75","Oct 18, 2005"

4.1,20.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"I sampled this beer at the Virginia Beach Octoberfest on Oct 16th. Disappointed that the beers were served in opaque plastic cups. Sorta guessing at the color, but it looked amber colored and clear as much as I could see it. Nice head, typical carbonation and good head retention and lacing. This is a good tasting beer, very comparable to the Sam Adams Octoberfest I enjoyed last week. The mouthfeel was just right. Light but not watery with no aftertaste other than a good beer taste. I would drinkg this beer again. Enjoyable either for sipping or as a session beer.","JayQue","Sep 19, 2005"
3.41,0.3,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Had in a 1 liter glass at brewery night at the Flying Saucer. Feeling pretty good after that one. Bar was darkish so hard to tell color but looked golden. Had a light bouquet. Small head (but not sure how long it sat before being delivered) and some carbonation. Overall had a good taste with a slight bitter taste at the end. Good but not great beer. Avery Kaiser kicks its butt.","TexIndy","Dec 30, 2004"
3.88,14.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"A very nice beer. Not overly complicated, not outstanding; just pure and simple. A golden-copper, crystal clear hue, moderately carbonated and forms a 1/2" white head with a little lacing. Smells softly of barley malt, caramel, toffee, and spiciness. Flavors of classic german pilsner flavors with a little toasty quality. Throw in a bit of caramel and toffee. Spicy with added noble hops. No off flavors. Body is medium and airy. Finish is fleeting, but not dry or abrupt. Very clean and crisp. A well brewed beer, but not a favorite among high gravity lovers.","BEERchitect","Oct 30, 2004"
3.66,7.6,4,3,3.5,4,4.5,"A special keg at the Royal Falconer in Riverside Ca. to commemorate Oktoberfest, this beer had a golden-orange translucent color with 1/4 inch white head that quickly settles. Aroma is very slight, was expecting more, but the flavor made up for it- malty, creamy, orange sode like with incredible drinkability. Slight hop kick at the end, just enough to keep interesting. Oktoberfest beers are not generally complex, or overpowering, but they are so bloody drinkable, and this is a very good example.","Dukeofearl","Aug 16, 2004"

3.3,-2.9,3,3,3,4,4,"This is a dumbed-down bier and a classic example of how a very large brewery can lose track of taste and concentrate on mass producing.","BierManVA","Jan 31, 2004"
3.15,-7.4,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours the colour of tea with a nice frothy white head. Smell is of malt with some caramel notes. Taste is average. Nothing to get excited about. Very easy drinking however. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for a Marzen. Overall this beer is not in the top 10 must drink Oktoberfest. This probably is along the lines of Becks Ofest. A mediocre attempt by a huge brewer to sell an Oktoberfest.","TinusTime","Oct 24, 2003"
3.68,8.2,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"This came with an inch and half head over a nice golden colored brew. The was a slight smell of malt but not much else. This tastes malty and sweet. It's a very light beer and quite drinkable. However, I expected a little more from Warsteiner in there Oktoberfest.","babyhobbes","Oct 12, 2003"
3.17,-6.8,3,3.5,3,3.5,3,"After so many Oktoberfests this season, the Warsteiner was nothing to write home about. Though not a terrible beer, it's not something I would actively seek out again either.","beergeek279","Oct 12, 2003"
2.93,-13.8,3.5,3,2.5,3,3.5,"Quaffable, yes. But nevertheless, one of the least inspired German festbiers I've tried.","cokes","Oct 10, 2003"
3.3,-2.9,4,4,3,3,3,"This golden brew had good head retention and some nice crusty lace at the top of the glass. A decent lager but off the mark as a fest. I was looking for a deeper color and a lot more maltiness. The bitterness was there but it left a bit of pasty dryness where I was looking for some malt body.","farHillsBrewer","Oct 08, 2003"
3.3,-2.9,3,3,3,3,4.5,"Not bad. Lighter than most Oktoberfests. Many are a medium to dark brown or even a nice cherry stain color, this one was dark tannish-gold with a small white head. Ther was some mild, sweet malt under the herbally hops in the aroma. Tastes a lot like regular Warsteiner except there is a light caramelly malt sweetness added into the mix. This is an extremely drinkable, but seems a little light for style.","aracauna","Oct 07, 2003"
3.7,8.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Light, transparent honey color with a white bubbly head. Low sweet malt aroma. Flavor is a light sweet malt, with doughey highlights, and hints of flowers. Light hoppy finish, and a lingering sweet flowery aftertaste. Mouthfeel is tingly and crisp. Not blown away at first, but I'm warming up to it. The more I sip, the more flavors that rise up out of it. One of the best of the very traditional German Oktoberfest beers.","far333","Oct 06, 2003"
4.49,32.1,4,5,4,4.5,5,"An absolutely spectacular octoberfest marzen, in the lighter true german style, not the heavier, darker sytle brewed for american tastes.. Incredibly clean, pronounced flavors. This is probably one of my favorite octoberfest beers so far.","UnionMade","Sep 27, 2003"
3.3,-2.9,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"On draught at the German Village Oktoberfest. I guess this is a newer offering from Warsteiner and isn't a terrible attempt. Hazy orange color with a thin light beige head. More hops than malt in the aroma, which is kind of a change in this style for me. Medium-bodied and almost over-carbonated with the hop profile dominating, although the malt begins to assert itself a little more on the backswing. The finish is rather slick. This isn't a great beer by any stretch but it does the job nicely on a cold Oktoberfest evening.","Dogbrick","Sep 20, 2003"
3,-11.8,3,3,3,3,3,"In the glass a translucent golden amber color with the head modest in size, frothy in its texture, the color a bright white, lace forms a decent sheet upon the glass. Hints of caramel sweetness in the nose, crisp and clean, start is sweet, top is skeletal in its feel upon the palate. Finish is crisply acidic, hops pertinent to the style, aftertaste dry and long lasting, average at best.","Gusler","Sep 18, 2003"
3.47,2.1,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Light chesnut color, lighter than most O'fest brews. However, the Europeans and in particular the Germans, do well to brew light colored beers with a lot of flavor. This one fits into that catagory. Not deviating from the syle, the emphasis is on the malt here. It takes on a caramel, bready character then shifts to nutty and spicy. Carbonation and mouthfeel on the mark. A respectable O'fest brew enjoyed tonight at the local Oktoberfest. Prosit!","John","Sep 09, 2003"
2.88,-15.3,3,2.5,3,3,3,"Now, I know you think I'm kidding but the nose on this beer was stale cigarette ashes - and I'm not kidding. I went back to it several times and that is as accurate as I can possibly be. Cigarette ashes. The look is pale gold and out of style, but the flavor is semi-sweet and a bit thick, actually not too bad. Actually, everything is average but that odd nose.","AtLagerHeads","Sep 02, 2003"

3.54,4.1,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Light for a Marzen brew, Warsteiner Oktoberfest is more of a pale amber -- almost bold yellowish-orange -- than the copperish, mid-amber I've come to expect from the style. Decent malty sweetness though a bit bland. Cleans up with a nice, lightly hopped finish. It was a good-drinkin' beer for sure -- but not enough to inspire an amazing review.","marburg","0"
