"If I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life, this would be it."
""
""
""
"Pours brilliant copper tinted gold, with a 1” moussey white, persistent foam cap with good lacing. A light bread nose with a hint of light grains and kettle sugars. The palate dries out after an initial hint of sweetness with grain and kettle sugars and a moderate hop accent on the finish. Medium to a shade below on the body with moderate carbonation. While not big and assertive, a very easy to drink beer."
""
""
"Strong, malty aroma has spicy and hoppy undertones. Pours a clear amber with an average pale cream head. Malty flavor has subtle notes of apple, pear and cloves and a hint of caramel. Smooth texture has typical body and average fizz."
"Solid standard.  Every Fall Bob's 47 should be in the fridge."
""
""
""

"A bit bland, even for a Marzen, this beer manages to have crisp, lively carbonation with a head that's a bit weak for style.  Light aroma and flavor is even a tad light for style, although not the hop level.  Nearly as sweet as it is bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (3.78) : Hey, it's not a bad pumpkin beer. It just spreads out way too thin over the first few drinks and then gets tiring. A lot of beers fall to this fate I'm afraid, so it's not uncommon - but it should be. If you get a chance to try Bob's 47 from Boulevard, don't skip it. It's a decent beer, worthy of your opinion."

"O: 3.5 - It's enjoyable, but again, really nothing to remember in my opinion; a C beer."
""
""
""
"On tap for pint night at McNellie's OKC. Pours a clear amber with a foamy white head. Lots of carbonation rising from the glass. A faint aroma of bread and malt. That's good because malt is what you get. There's a bit of caramel and just a touch of hops on the end. Medium mouth with decent carbonation. It's not bad, but just doesn't have the depth of the really good Oktoberfest offerings."
""

"This beer is very poor. Octoberfest should have some fall flavor, but this beer has none. To sum it up, it is highly carbonated, with a slight biscuit taste. No hops, no pumpkin, no nothing. Probably the worst beer I've had in the fall season. Bought a 6 pack but will NEVER buy another. Sam Adams Octoberfest destroys this Boulevard offering."
""
"Finishes clean and smooth, begging for another.  Very drinkable and a great session beer as any Oktoberfest should be.  One of my favorites."
""

"I like Oktoberfests, and Bob's '47 is a pretty good one.  It's not quite as malty sweet as some, but it's got a well-rounded flavor and good color.  Solid fall seasonal offering."

"Pours a pretty glorious burnt honeytone, initial fleeting off white head, and perfectly clear. Aroma is a little subdued, earthy, malty, bready notes, and slight yeast. It has a nice mouthfeel, and the base flavor is good, but I'd like something else going on. More spice, more booze, just some kind if hook to give it some character. As it stands, it just tastes like a watered-down Oktoberfest. This is another one from Boulevard for me that is almost there but is holding back. I worship Boulevard's Smokestack Series and their Nutcracker Ale but I haven't had a sixer of their tamer stuff that doesn't seem lacking in flavor. Many better Oktoberfests available - no disrespect to Bob."

"I'm a big fan of Oktoberfest, and this is one of the best Oktoberfest brews you can buy.. every time I see this brew for sale I get excited! It has a great marzen lager taste but still with the boulevard beer taste. You can tell easily it's a boulevard and an Oktoberfest in one which is a Great combination. I will say compared to other oktoberfests this isn't quite as Sweet.. Maybe from the added yeast in each bottle? But either way this is a Great Brew, one of my favs.. Highly recommended! Wish they sold it year round!"
""
"Bob's 47 is certainly among the best American Märzens I've tasted to date. In fact, I'm convinced that it would stand up to my favorite Oktoberfests from across the Atlantic. I'll be sure to pick up a bottle next year. I hope that Chimay, which has recently purchased Boulevard Brewing, doesn't change the recipe."
"O- Very tasty beer well suited for the autumn through winter seasons. Fairly strong taste of caramel and nutty malts provide a warming taste appropriate for the season as well as a nice full smooth finish."
""
""
""
"This is pretty good. It starts with spicy hops and finishes with them. The between parts are a little boring, but it's pretty good overall."

"O - A very good Oktoberfest. Not a beer I would crave all the time but it'd sit very nice on a cool October day sitting around a camp fire. Easy enough to drink that one could enjoy several"
""
"O-The flavors weren't strong, the balance wasn't there. A boring oktoberfest."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is an ""OK"" example of the style, with a bit more hop presence than I would normally expect. The hops are alright by themselves (they lend a somewhat vegetal, herbal bitterness to the finish that I didn't really care for, but some may enjoy), but the mouthfeel doesn't match well with the flavor...this thing needs more crispness and drinkability if they are going to go so light on the malts. On the plus side, this is a good-looking marzen with a particularly nice head."

"A decent, journeyman effort for an Oktoberfest beer. Malt grains and hop bitterness play well together and create an enjoyable, easy-drinking experience. Nothing exceptional, but a rock-solid seasonal beer offering."
"This Oktoberfest offering from Boulevard deserves more than the average 3.5+ rating it currently has (in my humble opinion). Outside of Sam Adams, I haven't run across a better American example of the classic German Marzen. Well done, Boulevard!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's a nice take on an Octoberfest. My preference is something a little more dry and spicy. I look forward to finishing the sixpack and would buy it again. CHEERS!"
""

"Overall a solid, enjoyable Märzen from Boulevard."

"The 12 oz bottle says ""best by 12/01/12."" Above that is ""1101 D."" So is it a year old? It has that coarse carbonation and slightly musty scent that indicates to me a beer past its prime. So they're not doing any favors with the liberal ""best by"" date."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a pretty good American Marzen. It isn't my all-time favorite but I always look forward to Boulevard's Fall seasonal."
""
""
"O- A nice Oktoberfest. Better then a majority of the american versions I have tried."
""
""
""
""
"i was a bit let down by this one.. i've only had boulevard's smokestack beers and haven't been let down.. until now. this is definitely one of their low end beers."
""
""
""
"Pours the color of honey with a fluffy tan head that soon recedes, leaving behind a thin veil of foam and sporadic lacing. Aroma is very mild--sweet, and vaguely citric. The flavor is also mild, with caramel malt and just enough hop flavor to balance things out. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy--probably the highlight here. An easy to drink brew, but nothing remarkable, which pretty much typifies the oktoberfest style to me. Wish I had more to say, because it's not bad, just uninteresting."
""
""
""
"O: Another great example of the Oktoberfest style. I've really jumped into the fall seasonal offerings this year and I'm really liking the majority of them."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Not bad, a little bland but within expectations for the style, not much else to say about this one."
"Overall: Fairly drinkable. The finish hurts this one a little. I am not a big fan of the style and this one wouldnt be a regular for me."
"The body was bit fuller than typical for the style, nicely smooth, but the finish was just a bit sticky. Drinkability was very good, having several wouldn't be an issue. Overall, a very take on the style and a nuce brew. Certainly worth your time if you see it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: For me, it falls far shy of being an ideal Oktobefest."
""
""
"O: A decent Marzen overall, though a little on the bitter side for the style."
""
""
""
""
"O- Another nice drinking seasonal from Boulevard. I'm glad they decided to release their seasonals in 12 packs this year."
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty solid Marzen. Has more of a spicy kick than most in the style. It makes for an interesting twist."
""
""
""
"Enjoyable drink overall."
""
"Overall, this is your old standard marzenbier with no twists to stay true to the style which is probably what they're shooting for. Good session brew in the spirit of Fall."
""
""
""
""
"Enjoyed this brew on many occasions on our trip down to Kansas City, MO. Nice amber pour with a medium sized white head. Nice malt aroma with a bit of the hop presence at the end. Flavor is slightly malty with a nice hop finish. Not as flavorful as some Octoberfests out there but it can get the job done."
""
""
"Overall - I would absolutely recommend this beer. Try it, buy it, drink it! Good oktoberfest beer, I would like to take this to some friends outside Boulevards distribution area and see what they think. Tasty!"
""
""
"Overall: Above average Marzen that really hits the spot. However, the tingly mouthfeel and slightly odd balance hamper it slightly."

"O- This beer is almost astringent it is so dry in the finish and although it is well lagered the malt is hidden behind the bitterness and big fizz."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While this may be a better-than-average marzen, it's still a nice beer."
"Opinion: I was diging this beer until I got to the drinking part. It isn't bad, but the balance is a little off for the style. It is OK for a commercial beer, and I wouldn't mind drinking it again as it definitely IS drinkable. I just really enjoy Hacker Pschorr O-Fest, which is practically like a milkshake in flavor and mouthfeel. This beer is a long way from that, but still a decent attempt at the style and one worth trying out if you get a chance."
""
""
"Overall: a decent Oktoberfest, but I don't think I'd seek it out again."

"Not a memorable beer, but very drinkable with thin head that remains until the end. No lacing on the glass. Metallic hop taste lingers for a while, and although not unpleasant, this lacks a bit of complexity and taste up front that you would expect from a typical american octoberfest beer."
""
""
""
"Drinkability: It could be better, but it is far from one of those American märzen’s that looks sexy but lacks a ton of complexity."
"Drink- Not too shabby. Not my favorite style but Boulevard still makes a good beer."
"Overall, probably one of the best Oktoberfests this year 2012. Malty, caramel sweetness, and a hint of cinnamon spices. Love it."
"D: Really easy to put down and very tasty.  I look forward to this beer every year, and wasn't disappointed again.  It's not the best example of the style, nor the most tasty, but it's well made and balanced.  "
"The mouthfeel is pretty full-bodied for the style. It isn't thick exactly but it has some tooth to it. It also manages to achieve a dry finish despite this beer's totally sweet flavor profile. Overall, this is a very good American Marzen. Boulevard rarely disappoints, and this beer has been a Fall favorite in the Midwest for a long time. This beer would be so, so good paired with some Turkish food, some nice Dolma. Give this one a try if you're looking for something clean and tasty to session."
"Smooth mouthfeel through and through, but there is some odd bitterness that pops up here an there that is a little off-putting."
"Much better than the average american oktoberfest attempt, but still lacks a bit in terms of malt complexity. Not my favorite beer style, but this one is tasty and drinkable enough where I might order a second, especially when it's cold out like tonight."
"first beer from these guys. pours slightly darker than the european oktobers, smells like a malt bomb, decent head. taste is true to the nose, malt up front, malt in back. not over the top, but balanced and a little bit addicting. this is a great 6pack for the fall. not the best oktoberfest on the shelf, but a damn fine version. medium thick body keeps this one in the gut for a bit, nice when its chilly out."
"Overall Impression- A decent Marzen by Boulevard but not a beer I would necessarily go back to... Quite boring actually but represents the style well. This is one of the last Oktoberfest brews I will be enjoying this season, unfortunately..."
"The beer pours a slightly hazy orange-brown color with a white head. The aroma is toffee with a little bit of cocoa mixed in. A very nice smelling, very malty beer. The flavor is also full of malt. I get some toffee, cocoa and caramel. The beer is pretty dry. There are no real signs of hops in the beer and the alcohol is well hidden. Easy to drink. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A nice American-made Oktoberfest."
"Overall it's a pretty good Octoberfest. Certainly all well and fine within the Marzen style. Very affordable too, and also featured in some of their samplers."
"Feels medium in body, with good strong carbonation to keep the palate cleansed and dry. Makes me desire yet another sip."
"Aroma is caramel, toast, herbs; appearance is amber, orange, very clear, tan head; taste is medium sweetness, lightly bitter with excellent balance; palate is medium body, flat carbonation, nice slight bitter, long finish. A nice beer I wish would be available all the time."
"Beer is quite sweet, very caramelly and thicker than expected, medium bodied, smooth throughout, decent finish. Could have used a little less caramel, a little more Munich with a lighter finish, otherwise I enjoyed it and would have it again."
"I'm glad I tried it but I dont know if I'll buy it again."
"Finally, a new O-Fest on the market! Digging in... It pours a clear sunset amber topped by a finger or so of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises toasted caramel, light cilantro, grass, light white bread, light toffee, and a touch of nutmeg. The taste generally follows suit, but with a more pronounced pine character (springing from the aforementioned cilantro), some spicy greens, and a bit of nuttiness for effect. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a slick feel, and a kinda dry feel. Overall, a nice O-Fest, with a slight American take on the style with the stronger-than-usual hop presence and drier finish. Not bad at all, really."
"Well its almost October and the Oktober Fest beers are rollin'! Trying the Bob's 47 Oktoberfest from Boulevard...and it is good! The color is a beautiful clear amber with nice white head....unfortunately it did not lace. The smell was mostly sweet malt and some hop. The taste was a perfect balance of sweet malt, hop and grain. Session...no question. The balance and smoot drinkability earn decent marks for this beer. Boulevard strikes again!"
"medium/full bodied with a spice finish. This comes off as a real good american interepretation of a oktoberfest."
"Nice light crisp body. The hop profile and lighter body make this an interesting hybrid style, but very enjoyable especially on a good fall night or football gameday knocking back a few."
"I'm not particularly impressed by this Oktoberfest, as seems to be the case with most US versions. They're just lacking the robustness, heartiness, and mix of flavors that the better German versions can offer. This one doesn't excite me; I won't be picking it up again."
"Overall this was a solid oktoberfest offering. Loved the malt, I thought it was better than other oktoberfest beers, there just wasn't anything outstanding about it. Will gladly enjoy again though."
"Had on tap and packaged in bottle. The taste is slightly similar, however the bottle is a bit more flavorful. A nice light brown color with a bit of amber. Small amount of carbonation and compact bubbles with litle to no laceing. A nice malt presence but not overwhelming. A bit of hoppiness to give an overall round character to the brew. Nice fall seasonal."
"Excellent O-fest. Rich and complex yet balanced."
"M: Medium body, crisp slight fruit, apple or pear, can't quite make it out. Guess I don't have the tongue for it yet."
"Overall- A good oktoberfest style beer. I could drink a few of these."
"O: One of my favorite Boulevard seasonals. Listed as a Vienna Lager here but marketed as a Marzen/Oktoberfest by the brewery. Either way, this is more hoppy than your basic Oktoberfest, and not as spiced as some of them are."
"Overall a good offering"
"A pine bitter finish."
"D: Nice and drinkable, but not too memorable."
"Overall, a good Oktoberfest lager. It has a nice to it but it is not very bold. Worth trying if you see it."
"Poured a very light copper color, very thin, with just a little head and no lacing throughout. Decent scent, a nice light maltiness with a very nice thick caramel undertone. Good flavor, decently thicker than a regular lager, with some nice caramel flavors, but nothing too ""fall like."" Goes down smooth, but fairly thin for an Oktoberfest."
"Boulevard Brewing Company--Bob's 47 Oktoberfest--A tribute to our friend Bob Werkowitch, master brewer and graduate of the US Brewers' Academy class of 1947--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 5.80% ABV. 20 IBU's? (3.25 / 5.0) Mild lace thin white head. Clear bright rich dark gold color. Mild hop lightly toasted soft caramel malt aroma front. Smooth mild sweet wheat bread toasted caramel malty mild fruit Fest Lager body. Crusty hint soft hop smooth malty end. Odd bland weak flavor. Sampled 11/9/2010 from 6-Pack purchased for $8.49 at Fred Meyer--Ballard, Seattle on 9/8/2010."
"Overall, a pretty solid Oktoberfest beer. i'd have no problem drinking a few of these, but after a while, it might become a bit monotonous for me and i'd want to switch to something else."
"Poured from the bottle into my beer mug, a nice rusty, clear color, with a white head that laced some and retained well. Smell was a good balance of maltiness and graininess. Taste lead with the graininess more. Feel had ample carbonation and a nie smoothness. Overall a good oktoberfest sampling."
"Very drinkable. I could easily have several at a sitting. One of the better American examples of the style."
"D - Pretty good beer, but don't see myself running back for more anytime soon."
"Poured a clear amber, almost bourbon like, with a nice off white two finger head with some light lacing. Aromas of carmel malts and booze. On the palette it was like sipping cheap whiskey with malty undertones, kinda nice. Fair enough carbonation. Don't know if you could call this brew a Lager, but it sure had some Marzen qualities to it. Two thumbs up."
"Solid beer from a solid brewery. The 47 has a a great caramel flavor and a solid smell and taste. Fits well in the Vienna style as advertised but doesn't stand out among other beers in the genre. That's no reason to stay away, though, as this is a must try."
"Notes: Pretty good German lager. Malt heavy but with a nice amount of hops to break that up. Pretty good and enjoyable, especially on a fall day. Didn't quite have the kick or extra something to make it great, but it is very good."
"Overall a solid brew that hits the spot during Ofest (even though not an Ofest) season. Recommend. Available here in TX. Rotation - I got this as part of a 12pk sampler so got 2 of em. I think that is the perfect amount and way to get it for me. [O;O]"
"Notes - Oktoberfests are a fairly narrow style, and few of them stand out. I would say Boulevard's is middle-of-the-pack. There's no particular reason to seek it out, but no particular reason to avoid it, either."
"This would be a good beer with hearty food with savory flavors."
"Ok there is one word that has yet to appear in my review: toasted. Where the hell is the toasty/toasted flavor in this beer? Is this supposed to be an oktoberfest? Maybe not since I see it's classified as a Vienna Lager. That makes more sense. Whatever it is, it's decent, but nothing special. Enough flavor to provide some satisfaction however."
"The rich malty nose was enticing except for the dreaded metallic notes. The metal didn't show up in the flavor though. This goes great in the fall with some grilled brats and a football game."
"D: Simple, and good. Boulevardy."
"Overall a week attempt at an Oktoberfest. I feel like Boulevard does a lot of very good ""big"" beers but their everyday six pack styles are sorely lacking. This is a prime example."
"D: This is a nice Oktoberfest. It's flavorful without being overly strong. A solid pickup."
"A crystal clear medium amber brew with good frothy head and carbonation. Light hoppy and malt aromas. Mouthfeel is medium and satisfying, but still quite drinkable. The flavors are well balanced with a clean, crisp slightly sweet finish. Another good midwest brew from awesome trader Birchstick. Thanks."
"12 ounce stubby bottle. Porus a deep burnished orange with a light tan head with a solid half inch of retention. Nice levels of carbonation are apparent in my glass. Light notes of honey nut cheerios up front along with the smell of lightly skunky lager yeast. Is this thing a lager? Guess I should have actually read the bottle. If it is a lager it's surprisingly dark, as the color borders on amber. Smell is average at best, was hoping for more malt but the aroma just isn't there. Medium mouthfeel, light carbonation is present in the body of the beer. Kind of sticky, but not overly so. I find this beer coating the roof of my mouth more than others in the style. Not as watery as I had anticipated. Good malt body in this beer, much moreso than the aroma would lead you to believe. There's a nice mix of caramel sweetness and hop bitterness in the finish of the beer. If you're a hop head you'll find the hops about 2/3rds of the way through drinking the beer. Brown sugar malt sweetness greets the palate, introduces itself, before moving out of the way for the hops. The hops stay briefly and then you're left with more malt sweetness and some mild hop bitterness. It's actually a very well balanced beer and also very easy drinking stuff. Could benefit from a bit more in the taste department; the entire beer is rather subdued and while the mouthfeel isn't watery the taste feels like it could be pushed up a couple of degrees without sacrificing anything. Overall though a decent brew and exactly what I was looking for tonight to keep me company."
"Surprisingly, I've been drinking some octoberfest beers lately, and I believe this is the last one in the fridge. Pours a brilliant amber color, with a smallish ecru head. This is what a glass of beer should look like. A little spicy on the nose, with a bit of caramel. On the palate, sweet, crisp and a little bit bitter. A nice fall refresher."
"Mouthfeel is thin with a dry finish provided by the hops."
"Thanks BlueOkie!"
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable, but I think a little lower than it should be for the ABV. A nicely crafted beer and easily sessionable. Boulevard does a consistently good job of creating well blended brews, and this one easily exceeded my expectations."
"Drinkability is pretty good. A sweet, simple - ugh, vienna lager? I'd say marzen...but whatever, quaffable and smooth."
"D: Great food beer, bring on the bratwurst and red cabbage. Also make a nice session beer, tasty flavors but nothing that gets old."
"D) Just average not a stand out."
"D -- Easy drinking. Just enough malt and sweetness to satisfy having a couple. Decent ABV. Will get more for the holidays."
"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/3 inch head of ann off-white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, yeast, grain, and slight hops. Fits the style of a Marzen / Oktoberfest. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, sweet malt, slight citrus, and yeast. Overall, great flavors, good blend, but a little heavy on the hops in my opinoin."
"D: Pretty good Fest bier; more sessionable than most though not a big."
"D - This is a nice amber lager. It fits the Vienna style quite well. Very drinkable - another decent beer from Boulevard."
"A terrific example of the style here... Again, Vienna lager or Oktoberfest, doesn't matter to me, its delicious and very drinkable.."
"Drinkability: sessionable"
"If it wasn't for the harsh finish, this one would actually be a pretty good beer. I think this is one that Boulevard could back to the drawing board and significantly improve with some fine tuning. Nothing terrible, but not something I'll be picking up next year."
"This brew pours a brilliantly clear copper color with a thick off-white head. The aroma is moderately malty, toasty and a bit of husk/grain. The flavor is moderate-high malt, toasty with a bit of a dry/puckering quality, especially at the swallow. The body is medium-full with moderate carbonation. Overall a decent Oktoberfest. The swallow is rather dry combined with a bit of a puckering quality from the grains, makes this a bit below a top notch Oktoberfest."
"D: This is a nice, autumnal lager that is pretty easy to go down; a bit thin but quite drinkable"
"This one is a little lighter on the toasty malts than most and has a strong nutty presence. Not too much sweetness and is fairly dry for the style. There is some graininess in there, as well as some tannic bitterness. This is an easy beer to consume large quantities of, but the overall flavor of it is somewhat light. Not a bad offering and can hang with the German crowd fairly well. This one will be a repeat purchase around this time of year for me."
"D - Easy drinking. ABV is manageable. Flavors are smooth, not overwhelming. Is slightly filling. Good session beer in the fall."
"It may have trouble standing up to its peers if tasted side by side, but alone it is good."
"This is a good beer with a nice balance. The biggest issue being the intensity of aroma and taste, allowing the balance to be more enjoyed. It is a good beer and worth enjoying. The taste does not become overwhelming, nor does the alcohol."
"D - refreshing and good ABV."
"Not my favorite offering from Boulevard, but a solid beer. I wont be buying this again, but I can see why some people do."
"Overall: this is a pleasant beer. It just needs a little more substance. Not alot! Just a little. The hops are probably about right, but the malts are lacking. I would also agree with previous posters that there is a metallic taste that shows up sometimes."
"Drinkability - Good and tasty for fall."
"Each sips manages to pack in good flavor, but end quickly and cleanly, making for a very sessionable Bavarian style beer. I can't believe I didn't care for this in years past. I will definitely be buying more this season and will eagerly look forward to its arrival each fall."
"Sure, it's drinkable, but it's not something i'd pay premium prices for. MAybe if I could get a sixer for less than $7, it would be a worth by. As it is, this is a poor martzen/lager with some strange off flavors."
"D. Easy to drink. Not incredibly flavorful, but still good."
"Overall impression: Very drinkable - only negative is that the aroma is a bit harsh. Otherwise an enjoyable beer."
"overall just okay."
"Overall, pretty nice beer, I would get this again, but honestly it would be a hard sell if SA Octoberfest was sitting next to it...."
" Overall, a nice, versatile beer that is enjoyable and shouldn't offend too many palates."
"Poured from a stubby 12 ounce bottle into my standard shaker ""pint"" glass. The lager appears a clear golden amber color with a finger of foamy off white head. Smells and tastes of light toasty bread, very grassy, slightly bitter hops, fall fruits, sweet caramel malts. Rather thin in body but adequately carbonated. Not terrible, but I'd probably pass on having another."
"Drinkability: very easy to drink, this goes down with absolute ease. Great taste and feel, and all around one of the best Oktoberfests I've had yet (trumping even my last review of Baron Brewing's Oktoberfes"
"Most of What I've had from Boulevard is really good, and I had high hopes for this one. It was clear and bright in color with a creamy head. The aroma was predominantly malty and sweet. It's too bad thats what the beer tasted like as well. It was one sided and mostly Malty sweet with some fruit and diyctal flavors. All in all it's just too simple. It need to clean up the diycital and possable get some more hops. Personally I don't agree with the Oktoberfest labeling if it's not a Marzen."
"I had this at the end of it's drink by date, so maybe that has something to do with the metal."
"Drinks alright, getting a semi-stale vibe here. Will re-review when I can find fresher, this sample is pretty run of the mill for the style"
"Notes from and tasted on 11/08/06."
"Hmmm, I wish had something better to say about this Boulevard offering I have to admit that this was probably thee most mediocre of the O-Fests that I tried this season. It tries to come on too strong (and sometimes a bit artificial) with what it's got and just didn't sit well with me."
"A good American version of the style. Another hit by one of my favorite Midwest breweries."
"from mhewes in Pre-Season Football BiF"
"Poured into a generic chalice glass, this beer has a nice reddish-copper color, though the head retention is lacking. The nose is fairly grainy, with a very light toastiness. The taste mostly continues a similar grain (sorry). A better malt profile would really help this beer. As it is, it's pretty ordinary."
"I tasted some very odd flavors reminiscient of the flavors I don't care for in German hefeweizens - flavors I've come to think of as ""yeasty"". Overall, it tasted more to me like I was drinking a hefeweizen than an Oktoberfest."
"its a meh beer. worth a shot. i wouldn't go out of my way to get it but i might drink it again if presented the opportunity"
"It has a great dark amber and somewhat orange body. The cream colored head disappears quickly into a thin lace. It smells spicy and wheat like even though it is not a wheat. It has a great Marzen flavor. It is sweet and malty balanced out with the right amount of hops. It has a medium body. I like this beer a lot and cannot wait until next year."
"This beer has some brewing flaws that should covered up. It's not something I'll be trying again."
"D - extremely drinkable, just not very memorable"
"Easy-to-drink, very smooth. Lightly toasted malts, no hoppiness to speak of. Sweet without being syrupy. I usually find Oktoberfest beers too sweet, but this is nice. Good work by Boulevard."
"D - pretty good Oktoberfest, however it did not hold my interest as much as I wanted it to. However, it is one of the better Boulevard beers I have tried."
"This is probably my favorite Boulevard excluding the smokestack series."
"D - Nothing I would buy a regular basis, just doesn't really get me"
"M/D - Medium bodied but the aftertaste that lingers is so sticky sweet it verges on unpleasant. Still, a drinkable o-fest."
"This brew pours a light orange - amber with an off-white sudsy head that dissipates quickly and leaves no lace. The smell is a combination of toasted malt and a light caramel sweetness with some spicy/herbaceous hops. This is a tasty beer with some quality toasted malts backed up by a faint sweetness. OTOH the hops seem somewhat heavy-handed in this beer (and I like hops). The malt and hops are nicely balanced but in an O-fest I expect the malt to be in the forefront. Even so this is a very nice brew."
"This is one that Boulevard could stand to market more than just the Fall and, should they only stick to the Fall, start distributing in mid-August (at least here in Illinois). This is one of my favorites from Boulevard, right up there with Bully! Porter and Zon. Well done, and one to which I'll return many more times. Very good Helles Lager."
"D - One of the more flavorful Oktoberfest style beers that I've tried. Low alcohol and good flavor make for a very sessionable ale."
"Very nice. Impressive for a beer with just 4.5% alcohol. Time to crack another."
"Always look forward to fall when 47 becomes available. A very sessionable beer with some great overall flavor and mouthfeel."
"One of the better offerings from a brewery that's never been one to take chances--though their recent Smokestack Series is changing that quick."
"M/D: Low carbonation, a bit of metallic aftertaste. I see the ABV is under 5%, I can really, really see myself making this a session beer if it becomes year-round."
"D: Easy to drink. Good as a sipper and a beer I could have a couple more of. Light ABV at around 4.5% makes for an appropriate session beer. Good job overall, Boulevard."
"I look forward to this one every year."
"Drinkability: a decent beer with complex flavors, could use a little more structure and body in my humble opinion.."
"Drinkability is moderate. It's a fine beer, just nothing exceptional."
"Pretty good...nothing I could ever rave about, but one of the tastier offerings from this average brewery."
"Poured a 120z bottle into my Chimay chalice. This beer pours a copperish red, with a small 1/2 inch white head that disappears into just a slight rim around the outside of the glass. The aroma is of roasted malts, vanilla and a bit of spice. The taste is big on roasted malts, with a really spicy hop notes that are not found in many other beers. I really enjoy this beer. There really are not a lot of nuances in Bob's but it suits it very well. The mouthfeel is light and slightly carbonated. I think this is the best seasonal that Boulevard puts out. I seek it out every year, and buy about a case over the fall. I absolutely love this beer, and it is my go to beer in the September-October months."
"Very drinkable with a satisfying flavor and low ABV. I just wish it was more widely available in my area."
"Medium carbonation and clean in the mouth, crisp and very enjoyable. I will be drinking this all fall long and possibly into the winter."
"M&D-Very smooth medium body extremly easy to drink makes me wish it was around longer, this one as well as the Sam Adams this year i will most likely buy a case of to get me through all those times I wish I could have one."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce brown glass short bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard tap glass."
"D - Drinkability is good. This beer is smooth and mildly refreshing. The flavors come together to make a nice brew that I'm glad I got the try. This one makes me look forward to trying more Boulevard Beers in the future."
"The Boulevard Smokestack brews really piqued my interest in boulevard beers again, and seeing as I've had a hankerin' for a lager lately it seems fitting to give this one a shot. Pours a light amber into a Pilsner glass with a big light tan head which rounds itself off high above the rim. Wide streaks of lacing are left after the head settles down in a slow fashion. Smells a bit sweet at first with some malts, grains, hay and a bit of hops making things interesting. The smell is not as dull as some lagers tend to be. Tastes of sweet malts up front, a bit of sweet tea, hops and a faint hint of spices in the background. Super drinkable and very tasty. This one proves a lager can be tasty, refreshing and drinkable (I sound like a beer commercial) something so many breweries forget, which is too bad for the style. One of my new favorite lagers."
"Nice caramel and bready malt flavour with some fruitiness and a fairly dry finish thanks to a small but, it is there, hop presence. Wow. The more I drank, the more I wanted to drink...extremely drinkable for me(mouthfeel was nice and not a bit watery) and very satisfying. I just wish I could buy some sixers around town. :^("
"Pours amber with a fluffy beige head. Tart malt, and lager-like yeastiness in the smell. Flavor is light, somewhat crisp body with a mild bitterness. Sourdough breadiness and while not my favorite, a drinkable flavorful beer with an interesting tartness."
"Thanks to markabberant and your positive review of this brew, made grabbing a six of this an easy choice."
"Thanks rsyberg01."
"D: Bob's 47 is excellent and an exceptional example of the Helles Lager. Clean, crisp, and delicious. For a company known for their American wheat, this was a great surprise that I really enjoyed."
"Somewhat of a pale coppery color with little discernable head. Sharp aroma with a bit of a metallic smell/bite to it. Fairly malty flavor-nice residual sweetness against a crisp hop bitterness. Decent mouthfeel-somewhat soft and bready. Quite a drinkable and enjoyable brew."
"The drinkability is good, my only complaint is that Boulevard doesn't sell this year-round."
"Tonight felt like a Bob's 47 night, with a crisp bite in the wind outside, me warm inside, watching my Jayhawks dance all over Texas A&M. Boulevard's Bob's 47 is a Munich Style Lager. Very oktoberfest. I poured a bottle of the brew into a glass beer mug, and snapped this picture with my phone. The head pours bubbly, but thin, and quickly dissipates, leaving very light lacing. The color is an orangey-amber, like copper, and very clear, in a filtered sort of way. Sticking my nose into the mug, it smells sweet, a little fruity and slightly spicy. The first sip has a sweet, malty, bready flavor, followed by minor bite, perhaps hops. (The Boulevard site says the beer is brewed with a combination of Pale, Munich, Carapils & Aromatic malts, and Magnum & Hallertau hops.) It is carbonated well to provide some lightness, and the mouthfeel is on the thinner side. This beer presents like it will be too sweet, but the taste left afterwards is a bit dry, only slightly bitter, and drives me to take another sip, and another. Like most of Boulevard's seasonal brews, I wish this one was available for longer periods. Our keg at work is sporting Bob's right now. I have been working overtime lately. :)"
"D: Sessionable. Another quality non-wheat offering from Boulevard. Too bad it's seasonal."
"Flavors of caramel malt, some underlying bitterness, husky grain. Not all that memorable, but it's simplicity works in it's favor. Well carbonated and probably sessionable, but I had to reach for something else after one."
"D - This one totally came out of left field and floored me! I was expecting a somewhat boring pilsener-like lager, and got a hoppy fruit bomb with deep toasted malts. Here's to Bob Werkowitch!"
"is a pretty decent one."
"Note: I am rating this beer based on the Vienna style instead of Helles. Helles is defined as a light colored beer (helles is German for bright) and this beer is copper or amber in appearance which is more in line with a Vienna style lager. I tasted Bob's '47 side-by-side with an Ayinger Jahrhundert and they are two different types of beer."
"Clear amber in color with a healthy white head, this brew had a modest nose of mostly sweet grains. The malt body was round and juicy with a twinge of tea flavor. Crisp and clean on the palate, the hops had a surprising citric quality that was unexpected for the style. I never really got any noble hop vibes out of the beer, i.e. grass, herbs, hay, etc. Despite this perceived shortcoming it is really a solid beer that goes down super smooth."
"Good beer that I'll gladly drink again. Well done guys."
"This beer pours a clear bronze color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes into nice lacing. The aroma is of spicy hops with nice biscuity, toasty notes. The taste is of like the aroma, but a little hoppier. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with a high level of carbonation. Overall, this is a nice beer. It is a little too hoppy for the style, but I like it nonetheless. I would drink this again."
"There is probably a tad too much hops in this to be true to style, but I like it. A great lager; approachable to newbies, but enough going on to satisfy those looking for more. Very impressive, I wish I could get this locally, it would make a fantastic session beer."
"Bottle #5 of my six pack. Best before 12/01/07."
"Beer pours a nice, clear copper, with a good white colored head. Aroma is sweet caramel along with fruity and spicy hops. Taste is very well balanced. Hops are herbally with some toasted, sweet malt present. There is a slightly fruity background as the beer warms. Hops also finish pretty spicy. Medium to full mouthfeel. A very easy drinker for the fall especially comming in at less than 5% abv. Boulevard does some good stuff and this is no exception."
"Body is about right although the thin flavor can't help but influence the overall perception that the beer itself is thin. Easy to drink and if the sweetness doesn't aggravate you then I could see making a night of this one. This is a prime example of a beer that doesn't score well when adhering strictly to stylistic guidelines but at the same time is pretty darn good just from an enjoyability standpoint. Good brew!"
"Pours a light red-orange with a small, white head. The smell is somewhat faint, typical lager. Almost tastes ale-like. I don't know if they bottle condition the beer (It says so on the label, but I didn't notice any sediment or haze), or if its the specific yeast strain they use or what. It sort-of misses the mark for a helles, but it still is a very good tasting brew. A little bit of sweetness hits your tongue on first sip, matched with good carbonation. After, you taste the well rounded bitterness from the hops. Leaves a clean, light feeling in your mouth. Quite drinkable, could be a good session beer with the not very high abv. As this is a seasonal beer, I plan to stock up on it for the rest of the year!"
"pours a reddish amber color with a small head, smells pretty good, has a small hint of corn and water but more predominately maltiness. which is surprising for a lager. tastes decent mild alcohol sting with a malty taste, little hop note, atleast from what i can tell. mouthfeel is pretty good as is drinkability, not a bad brew."
"My bottle unfortunately is a little past its prime according to the best by stamp, but this one is still pretty tasty. It's an amber color with lacing and a sweet, almost candied aroma. The flavor mixes light bock-like licorice with nutty grains and caramel. A pinch of hops flavor and crisp, pleasant bitterness round out what is an impressive lager. Rich in flavor, not too sweet, and good for the summer."
"Drinkability: drinks more like an ale than a lager in my opinion. Drinking several in a row would be quite easy and tasty with a relative low alcohol."
"Drinkability, oh ya! At about 5% abv this medium bodied brew goes well anytime with any meal. Great Job Bob!!"
"Overall Impression: Smooth flavor melds the four natural ingredients in a solid fashion so that none stand out, but all are tasted. Total package is refreshing and clean, but with solid flavor. Easy drinking, very nice beer, recommended."
"Thanks, beerhandy, for this eye-opener"
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable enjoyable lager, and according to the box, the only lager produced by Boulevard. That is too bad because this is a great beer, IMO. I'll be looking forward to having this again next year. Very drinkable very sessionable."
"Not bad. Well balanced and nothing bad about this beer. Next time you take a trip to the Midwest, try to check this one out."
"Another good seasonal beer. Had a amber color. Poured into a glass, very light colored head. Taste was the best part. Very smooth, not bitter. Got better as it warmed up a little. I will be looking to enjoy a six pack of this beer each year it comes around. I am trying to get more technical with each review as I add them. I will keep better notes."
"Draught: Mine poured a crystal clear amber color, with a bit of carbonation going on in there. A bit of a white head with about no lacing. The aroma was decent enough, but a little light. Slightly grassy with a whiff of caramel. The taste is slightly dry with a hint of spicy bitterness to it. Not too bad."
"D - I was expecting a Helles when I purchased the beer but am pleasantly surprised by what I found when I opened this bottle. The flavor is much maltier but still gives way to a bit of a hop finish. I will buy this again the next time I'm in a state that sells it. This is a very satisfying beer. I can't wait to delve into the other Boulevard beers."
"D - I like this beer. It looks and tastes more like a Dunkel than a Helles, but oh well. I wish Blvd would make this beer year-round, as I don't think I can wait until next September!"
"12 oz bottle poured into a tall hefe glass. Mild wispy head, only about a finger width that quickly receded. Spotty lacing. A very attractive, warm brown color. Smell is musty, earthy, and yeasty. Smell doesn't really jump out. Taste was a mild spice finish, pepper with a bit of other herbal notes. Medium bodied mouthfeel. I like Bob's 47 a lot, but it doesn't seem to be standing out as much for me this year as it has in the past."
"Smooth yet crisp and very drinkable."
"D - I enjoyed this seasonal from Boulevard. It is yet another beer that I wish was available year-round."
"This is simply delicious and one of my favorite beers. I once spent four hours of my weekday afternoon driving around St. Louis looking for this seasonal offering (quit holding out on us and offer it year 'round!). The color a beautiful translucent dark amber/brown. Pours a quickly fading head with some lacing, but the real redeeming quality is the taste, full and rich while mild without a heavy or grainy mouthfeel. Fantastic!"
"Pours a dark copper colored body, nice full and creamy white head. Smells light of malt, and that's about it, none too strong. Nice full malt flavor in the , spicy and fairly dry. Good. Hops are also not an afterthought, provides a nice finish. Mouthfeel is full and crisp, finishes nicely. A nice sessionable, reasonably priced lager, a nice change of pace (even though i love hop flavor more than malt)."
"All in all, this would be a good one to go with your bratwurst."
"Overall: Yet another Boulevard present thanks to Minnesotas finest BA. I could easily handle a 6-Pack of these no problemo. Thanks Joe."
"pours out a hazy copper colour with a sparse off white head. lingering lace. aroma thick with buttery malts...butterscotch and toffee. taste is the tradtional take on o-fests...a lot of munich malts and an underlying zing of bittering hops. the combination aforementioned gives a zest to the overall character of the beer, making it one of the better balanced o-fests available. light in the body, crisp in mouthfeel...sessionable and quenching, too. never too sweet or too syrupy. the above average hopping comes to play to liven the beer up and keep it interesting. very drinkable and satisfying for the style. recommended."
"I wouldn't mind it if this were on tap and on special, but I'd probably stick to something different if not."
"This is another solid one from Missouri's second largest brewery. This beer pours up very average, watery and thin with a smallish white head about one finger, which does lace and leave a decent ring with the glass during the session, the full amber color is b-e-a-utiful. The smell of this lager is nice with a grainy presence overwhelming an organic hop base light with malt. This one tastes very nice it is almost segmented first grain, second hops, third malt, fourth grain finishes this one. Very full and not at all offensive. This one does not feel like it pours very creamy and smooth on the cheek, somewhat watery but for a light lager not too bad. Overall a nice brew, a nice change of pace from the Boulevard Wheat."
"The mouthfeel is light, not too sharp on the tongue, and the bitterness mixes quite well with the other residual flavors. Gets better as it warms. Highly drinkable, though not quite as drinkable as I thought it was during last year's release, when I actually returned to the store for more later that night in true wino fashion."
"Pours out a hazy golden copper with amber highlights and a one finger off-white head. Caramel malts, florall hops to make up a splendid nose. Very nice. One of the best of Boulevard sline-up if not he best. The taste caramel and sweet malts up front. Some fruitiness Strawberry? Then herbal, slightly spicy hops slide in. Delicious and different. Finish is more sweet than bitter. Medium-bodied and coats the mouth well for a beer of its size. Well done again to the folks at Boulevard. Bpb Werkovich would have loved this too."
"Tasty, but too thick to be truly refreshing."
"This beer pours an amber color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is very clean with some hints of caramel and diacetyl. The flavor has some caramel malts and a certain nuttiness about it. Not as clean as the nose would suggest. Interesting, but not my thing."
"Light orange peel in hue with a soapy tan head. Barley malts, freshly toasted wheat bread and butter on the nose. Caramel malts, sweet roasted nuts and barley compliment the tender hop bitterness. Simple and extremely well balanced. Orange spices and toasted bread flavoring emerge as this one warms up. Traces of alcohol come to play; a huge caramel malt based backbone. Very well done."
"This beer pours a coppery amber color with a small ring of head over top of the beer. The nose is slightly caramel, but very buttery. Diacetyl alert. The flavor is also rather buttery-sweet. I'm not so sure what I think of it. There is a slight spicey on the finish. The feel is moderate with a slight carbonation. This is not a favorit of mine. I don't like the way the diacetyl comes through so dominant. It is not supported by a good hop like some ESB's."
"Flavor favors malts, but there is a good hop balance. A smooth beer with medium body. Finishes with a very enjoyable slight bitterness. Very easy to drink."
"Pours a dark amber and has a white head that leaves a nice lace on my glass. The aroma is very malty with a little spiciness of the hops. Very nice for a lager... It is very bock-like in it's character. I love the malty backbone with the excellent hopping... I am blown away by how good the beer is. I was expecting much less. I can't wait until next years batch."
"A solid triangulation of a lagers vienna, marzen, and munich."
"Kinda hazy golden copper with amber highlights and a small, off-white head. Sugary-sweet, candied carrot cake mix with spicy vegetal hops to make up a splendid nose. Very nice. One of the best smelling light lagers I've had the pleasure of smelling. The taste didn't let me down either. Tangy and sweet malts up front. Sugary fruit--kiwi? Strawberry? Light apple sweetness and then herbal, slightly spicy hops slide in. Delicious and different. Finish is more sweet than bitter. Medium-bodied and drinks and coats the mouth superbly well for a beer of its size. Well done!"
"Bobs 47 Munich style Lager from Boulevard is a most welcome amalgamation of malts and hops that I would recommend to anyone."
"Copper in color with a white head. Leaves a good amount of lacing down the glass. The aroma is spicy, and slightly grainy, with a nutty toasted maltiness. The flavor is sweet of caramel malts upfront, it then flows to a somewhat fruity taste. It is toasty and somewhat spicy in the flavor as well. Light in body, and smooth to drink. I pretty decent brew."
"Coppery-brown in hue with a slight tawny influence, Ive always loved the color of this beer. From the bottle a bit of yeast haze enters the otherwise clear liquid. Not much animation is noticed streaming to the off-white head. At the apex the foam was almost two fingers in height before quickly fading to a thin cap. There wasnt much subsequent lacing. There is nothing noteworthy about the appearance aside from the color; it says autumn to me. I like that. The nose says German in that universal beer language. Clean but malty, traces of buttered nuts, caramel, faint toasty sugar at times, earthy hops as well. Husks. Very slight suggests of alcoholic-fruit. The nose is simple but inviting. Ive smelled it year after year and enjoy it every time. Coherent. The potency is moderate. The palate is very tasty. It doesnt seem like a straight Helles to me, there seems to be a little O-fest in the mix (you know what I mean, right?). Whatever really, it is a great tasting German Lager. Malty upfront, in the middle, and at the finish! The malt offers some sweetness in the form of toffee, a little bit of buttery nuts, bread, crackers, and a warming caramely fruity-alcoholic finish. Hops are secondary and offer some earthy undertones. Lovely. This beer has improved (to me) ever year that Ive quaffed it. I think the beer has stayed the same but my palate as matured and I can now more fully enjoy the subtleties in beers like such. Clean aftertaste, there is just a trace of sweet malts. Pretzels anyone? Medium in body; creamy yet filling mouthfeel, in part, because of the moderately low but natural carbonation. I really like the bulk on the tongue and the creamy, smoothness of the swallow. Very drinkable, I look forward to this beer every year. Ive neglected to sit-down and pen a proper review (i.e., ignore that on-tap review I wrote, for now). This is a very solid offering; it is quite the drinker. Im thankful this beer is quite common in Omaha, for a few weeks every fall anyway. Recommended."
"Not sure how close to style this is but this is damn tasty in my book.."
"Bob's '47 is good beer. In fact, it's the best Munich Helles Lager that I've had to date and rivals Bully! Porter as Boulevard's best beer. Too bad it's a seasonal. The brewery would do well to make this one available year-round."
"Drinkability high and easy going. And at 5% this is a super sessionable brew to behold. Too bad its a seasonal. Astonishly good stuff!"
"Pours a clear copper-amber color with a good-sized off-white head that doesn't last long. Smell is malty, slightly sour, with a whiff of hop aroma. Taste is slightly sweet, malty with moderate hop bitterness on the finish. Good mouthfeel, nicely carbonated. Very flavorful and easy to drink. I've had a couple six-packs of this this season, and it goes nicely with most meals. I'll be looking for this each fall."
"A decent brew. Better than I remember from last year."
"This is Boulevard's seasonal fall offering. I liked the color of this beer when I first poured it, quite a rusty red--very autumn-like. The head is as short lived as autumn colors though, and dissipates quickly; the lacing is equally fleeting. Not much on the nose, some hops, maybe a bit of banana. Taste is also underwhelming, just a basic light beer, not much taste or mouthfeel. I could knock back a half dozen or so of these and not be bloated or overly inebriated, so drinkability is a plus. Overall, a solid beer, but not remarkable (or one which I will seek out regularly)."
"I'm not sure if it's my palate, but overall this hasn't been the 'must have' that the last few years of this seasonal has been, otherwise the 5s would be coming out for this one. It's still solid though and I'll enjoy it until the Nutcracker gets here though. Definitely worth a try if you can get it."
"The body is quite thin...too thin to really enjoy the flavor of this beer. If it were a bit less watery, then I think this would be an excellent Oktoberfest."
"I am glad it is from my local brewery."
"Light copper color, clear in presentation, resembles an orange-hued Marzen. Big rising head, very creamy. Laces cling in big sheet patterns. Nutmeg aroma, slightly nutty with a husky sense. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side, with reasonbly-done almost fluffy carbonation. Fruitier flavors than I expected, bright orange notes, a little fig, mixing in with a lightly caramel maltiness. Hops are not assertive, balance adequately without a distinguishing flavor that identifies type. Thins late in the impression and gets a little boring by the end of the glass."
"Pours a amber color with a small off-white head. The retention is fairly good with a little lacing. The malty aroma is nice. The taste is also malty and lightly sweet, but overall it is well balanced. The body is medium, nice mouthfeel. Nice fall seasonal brew."
"pours a clear bright amber brown with a short head. Aroma is heavier on the malt, floral hop, and herbal hints. quite tasty. Malt upfront and strong backbone with a great hop balance, and i detect some lemony herbal notes. Really a good smooth drinking medium bodied lager, I could easily see this as a session beer if it wasn't from so far away. Thanks to Nytmare for providing the sample."
"Thanks go to Marc77, provider of this brew!"
"Pours a nice, clear orange with a nice off white head. not much lacing. Decent retention. Smells of florally hops, bready malts, and caramel. Well balanced flavor with a nice bready flavor up front, crisp hops leave a nice aftertaste with a slight sourness at the end. Very nice mouthfeel. Enough carbonation to make it crisp, medium body. Slighty oily, but not overly so. These are quite good, and a great alternative to Sam Adams Lager, though slighty more expensive. If I have a few extra bucks, I'll buy these in the fall instead, for my sittin' in front of the TV watchin' the ball game beer. Mmmm."
"It pours a clean deep amber with a thin white head and minimal lacing. A breath of hops supports a fresh bread malty aroma. This is a nicely balanced lager with a lightly sweet, biscuity malt and butterscotch notes. The hops provide a mild citrus bitterness and slight metallic tang. The hops are very complimentary to the malt. A mellow herbal flavor and light dose of warming alcohol meld nicely to this highly gulpable brew."
"Bright amber-copper color, nice white foamy head that leaves a nice lacing in the glass. Has burnt roasted, malty caramel aromas, sweet and roasty malt flavors, medium bodied with a full and rounded mouthfeel, finishes clean with a nice sweetness. A pretty good fall brew, definitely worth a try."
"This style of beer is nowhere close to being one of my favorites, but Boulevard did an excellent job with this one. It seems a lot fuller and more balanced than others that I have tried."
"Very smooth, rolls onto the palate. A good beer, while I'm not a fan of the style this brew was pretty tasty."
"This one is a dark orange/amber colored beer, with a white foamy head that takes off quickly. Looks real crisp/clear/refreshing. Its got that caramel malty scent to it that is familiar with this style. Pretty much same for the taste, very smooth, a slight and well balanced hop influence detected.. This is a lager that is worth enjoying."
"Thanks for the great ofest/vienna/red/amber/munich-style lager, marc77."
"Brilliantly clear ruddy deep bronze hue. Lanky, but steadfast off white head leaves sparse, muddled lace. Soft herbal hops accompanied by balmy, toasty Munich and toffeeish medium lovibond caramalt dominates the aroma. Hints of sugary, caramelized nut like melanoidins offer a Marzen esque twist. Buttery, light toffee sweetness upfront in flavor is complemented by a mellow toasted malt and nutty brittle combination. Bitterness augments mid palate, and is comprised of an agreeable suggestion of lightly singed French toast, which couples well with the subtle, persistent, woody maple like malt undertone. Light on the palate, but firmly dextrinous in mouthfeel, lending a pleasant, ashen viscosity conducive to quaffability. Finishes cleanly toasty, with fleeting, rounded hints of simple caramel. An understated, but superbly balanced and unique brew. Akin to a Marzen / Dortmunder hybrid. Rich in character, yet airy on the palate. Superlatively drinkable and nearly immaculately crafted. Another fine seasonal from Boulevard. 5.6% ABV."
"All-around good choice for a tasty beer that is also not too heavy. It pours to a low, tight head that fades away to a ring around the glass. aromas are suggestive of Munich malts and a restrained noble hop character. Flavor is smooth, clear and very lagerlike with munich and crystal malt dominating, offset by the hops. Not a strong or extreme beer at all. Good for all occasions. This is simply good malty lager. An affordable alternative to Samual Adams Lager for those in Boulevard Territory."
"Alcohol Content: 4.48% by weight"
"Acquired via trade. This was a decent Amber Lager with a dark amber color and thin off-white head. No real lacing to speak of. Rich caramel malt aroma. Rather strong malt flavor with a nice finish. Not bad at all."
"This brew pours with a nice orange color and a lasting off-white head.  The very light aroma shows a hint of malt.  The body is quite light and backs up a light malt flavor with a quick bitter bite to finish.  Not bad, but a little too light for my tastes."
