3.9,4.3,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into dimpled mug, best before 1/13/2015. Pours hazy deep orange/copper color with a 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Slight spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, brown sugar, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light oak, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and light oak notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, brown sugar, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light oak, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light earthy herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, brown sugar, light nuttiness, light oak, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malts, earthy hop, and light oak flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavors as well with minimal esters present. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Oktoberfest style. All around good robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and light oak flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 29, 2014"

The Atom Smasher is interesting and very decent lager with nice drinkability and light malt sweetness w/out much wood character but it does contribute a slight lactic malt quality.","Slatetank","Oct 15, 2014"

The aroma smelled 'soapy' for some reason and some caramel malts as well. Pretty much was the same for the taste with a hint of wood. After about 3 more good sips, I poured it out. Medium bodied and perfect carbonation...for the drain. LOL! Overall, the worst Oktoberfest brew I have had this season. Maybe I had a bad bottle?

This has a much more fruity taste and smell to it then any other representation of the style I've had. But it's pleasant and easy to drink.

The taste is very tart almost like drinking liquid sour dough bread. The mouthfeel is tough...high ABV masked by bready tart soury mash taste.

The flavor is okay, having too much of a grain character with slight tannins and a mild tartness. Light body with bread crust and modest carbonation. Decent enough, but not something I would revisit.","Thorpe429","Beers"

3.23,-13.6,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Appears a slightly clouded deep caramel amber with a big billowing cream colored head. Fine speckled lacing scattered in my liter Paulaner krug. Aroma has some nutty caramel sweetness, tart cider like notes in the background. Alot of bread dough malt driven tones without much herbal hops to balance things out. Flavor super sweet almost sugary, lacks the balance that a nice toasted bread malty herbal hopped Ofest has I get it this isn't a straight up marzen this is a boozed up maltier version. Of all the Two Brothers beers I've tasted this is my least favorite. Mouthfeel becomes cloying especially once you're half way done, not my style of beer. I've had imperial Ofests that worked with higher alcohol the unbalanced malt/hop ratio is killing me. Carbonation is a bit much almost too heavy tickles the back of my throat and nares. Drinkability overall is really limited I wouldn't even suggest a bomber, I've been there and done that no need to revisit.","WVbeergeek","Oct 03, 2010"

4.07,8.8,3.5,4,4.5,3,4,"D: I was pretty damn happy this beer. I've been in the mood for malty and this really delivered. Some of its minor defects were that it was a little sweet on the finish and it didn't look polished. Otherwise this was rock solid and I'd drink it again.","brewdoc75","Sep 28, 2010"

In theory, it sounds like a solid idea, but at the end of the day, it doesn't translate to a better beer.","homebrew311","Sep 23, 2010"

3.75,0.3,4,4,4,2.5,3.5,"Mouthfeel is sticky and the carbonation is way too low. I'm not happy about this aspect, as I think better carb would have brought some pep into what is coming off as a dead beer. Distracting and certainly under the necessary feel of Octoberfest beers. While this was a unique angle and started off with some nice added depth, I feel this beer fell short. It's drinkable but too flat and sticky to be enjoyable. Please carb this next year, get those carbon and oxygen atoms to smash and make bubbles. Probably worth a try for the die hard Marzen fan, but not worth another try for me.","jampics2","Sep 13, 2010"

4.32,15.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Got this bottle on a whim from my local Binny's. It pours a clear dark orange with a thin quickly receding white head. The smell is very nice. Aside from the malt which there is strong smell of there is the smell of orange zest, pepper and what I believe to be an almost woodsy mesquite aroma. The taste is pretty damn good too. As far as I'm concerned it's the best Oktoberfest I've had this season. Now I say that with the caveat that my preference is to the sweeter more American Oktoberfests. Having said that the flavor is sweet malts on the front with hints of smokiness. The aftertaste isn't much with the distinct bittering and hints of cinnamon. It is smooth and highly drinkable. A definite recommendation if you have the opportunity.","Vdubb86","Sep 06, 2010"
3.88,3.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"""Turn out your pockets. I see atoms!"" Good times with old Father Burns. This brew pours a slightly hazed dark amber topped by a finger or so of cream-coloured foam. The nose comprises orange zest, mandarin orange syrup (yes, just the syrup), rye bread, hot cinnamon (Dentyne-style, Homes), and a touch o' white flowers it may be the acid, but I can taste the colours...). The taste is pretty similar, with the citrus and sweet bready malts double-teaming my 'buds quite nicely. The body is a light medium, with a light carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a very nice O-Fest, one of the better I've had thus far this season.","TMoney2591","Sep 05, 2010"
