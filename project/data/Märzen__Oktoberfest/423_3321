The palate dries out after an initial hint of sweetness with grain and kettle sugars and a moderate hop accent on the finish. Medium to a shade below on the body with moderate carbonation. While not big and assertive, a very easy to drink beer.","pat61","Jan 19, 2015"

That's good because malt is what you get. There's a bit of caramel and just a touch of hops on the end. Medium mouth with decent carbonation.

It has a nice mouthfeel, and the base flavor is good, but I'd like something else going on. More spice, more booze, just some kind if hook to give it some character. As it stands, it just tastes like a watered-down Oktoberfest. This is another one from Boulevard for me that is almost there but is holding back. I worship Boulevard's Smokestack Series and their Nutcracker Ale but I haven't had a sixer of their tamer stuff that doesn't seem lacking in flavor. Many better Oktoberfests available - no disrespect to Bob.","BeerWizard","Sep 07, 2014"

It has a great marzen lager taste but still with the boulevard beer taste. You can tell easily it's a boulevard and an Oktoberfest in one which is a Great combination. I will say compared to other oktoberfests this isn't quite as Sweet.. Maybe from the added yeast in each bottle? But either way this is a Great Brew, one of my favs.. Highly recommended!

The taste generally follows suit, but with a more pronounced pine character (springing from the aforementioned cilantro), some spicy greens, and a bit of nuttiness for effect.

3.68,0.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce stubby bottle. Porus a deep burnished orange with a light tan head with a solid half inch of retention. Nice levels of carbonation are apparent in my glass. Light notes of honey nut cheerios up front along with the smell of lightly skunky lager yeast. Is this thing a lager? Guess I should have actually read the bottle. If it is a lager it's surprisingly dark, as the color borders on amber. Smell is average at best, was hoping for more malt but the aroma just isn't there. Medium mouthfeel, light carbonation is present in the body of the beer. Kind of sticky, but not overly so. I find this beer coating the roof of my mouth more than others in the style. Not as watery as I had anticipated. Good malt body in this beer, much moreso than the aroma would lead you to believe. There's a nice mix of caramel sweetness and hop bitterness in the finish of the beer. If you're a hop head you'll find the hops about 2/3rds of the way through drinking the beer. Brown sugar malt sweetness greets the palate, introduces itself, before moving out of the way for the hops. The hops stay briefly and then you're left with more malt sweetness and some mild hop bitterness. It's actually a very well balanced beer and also very easy drinking stuff. Could benefit from a bit more in the taste department; the entire beer is rather subdued and while the mouthfeel isn't watery the taste feels like it could be pushed up a couple of degrees without sacrificing anything. Overall though a decent brew and exactly what I was looking for tonight to keep me company.","eclaycamp","Sep 03, 2010"

The taste is big on roasted malts, with a really spicy hop notes that are not found in many other beers. I really enjoy this beer. There really are not a lot of nuances in Bob's but it suits it very well. The mouthfeel is light and slightly carbonated. I think this is the best seasonal that Boulevard puts out.

Smells a bit sweet at first with some malts, grains, hay and a bit of hops making things interesting. The smell is not as dull as some lagers tend to be. Tastes of sweet malts up front, a bit of sweet tea, hops and a faint hint of spices in the background. Super drinkable and very tasty.

Boulevard's Bob's 47 is a Munich Style Lager. Very oktoberfest. I poured a bottle of the brew into a glass beer mug, and snapped this picture with my phone. The head pours bubbly, but thin, and quickly dissipates, leaving very light lacing. The color is an orangey-amber, like copper, and very clear, in a filtered sort of way. Sticking my nose into the mug, it smells sweet, a little fruity and slightly spicy. The first sip has a sweet, malty, bready flavor, followed by minor bite, perhaps hops. (The Boulevard site says the beer is brewed with a combination of Pale, Munich, Carapils & Aromatic malts, and Magnum & Hallertau hops.) It is carbonated well to provide some lightness, and the mouthfeel is on the thinner side. This beer presents like it will be too sweet, but the taste left afterwards is a bit dry, only slightly bitter, and drives me to take another sip, and another. Like most of Boulevard's seasonal brews, I wish this one was available for longer periods. Our keg at work is sporting Bob's right now. I have been working overtime lately. :)","smc143","Beers"

It sort-of misses the mark for a helles, but it still is a very good tasting brew. A little bit of sweetness hits your tongue on first sip, matched with good carbonation. After, you taste the well rounded bitterness from the hops. Leaves a clean, light feeling in your mouth. Quite drinkable, could be a good session beer with the not very high abv.

3.85,5.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Coppery-brown in hue with a slight tawny influence, Ive always loved the color of this beer. From the bottle a bit of yeast haze enters the otherwise clear liquid. Not much animation is noticed streaming to the off-white head. At the apex the foam was almost two fingers in height before quickly fading to a thin cap. There wasnt much subsequent lacing. There is nothing noteworthy about the appearance aside from the color; it says autumn to me. I like that. The nose says German in that universal beer language. Clean but malty, traces of buttered nuts, caramel, faint toasty sugar at times, earthy hops as well. Husks. Very slight suggests of alcoholic-fruit. The nose is simple but inviting. Ive smelled it year after year and enjoy it every time. Coherent. The potency is moderate. The palate is very tasty. It doesnt seem like a straight Helles to me, there seems to be a little O-fest in the mix (you know what I mean, right?). Whatever really, it is a great tasting German Lager. Malty upfront, in the middle, and at the finish! The malt offers some sweetness in the form of toffee, a little bit of buttery nuts, bread, crackers, and a warming caramely fruity-alcoholic finish. Hops are secondary and offer some earthy undertones. Lovely. This beer has improved (to me) ever year that Ive quaffed it. I think the beer has stayed the same but my palate as matured and I can now more fully enjoy the subtleties in beers like such. Clean aftertaste, there is just a trace of sweet malts. Pretzels anyone? Medium in body; creamy yet filling mouthfeel, in part, because of the moderately low but natural carbonation. I really like the bulk on the tongue and the creamy, smoothness of the swallow. Very drinkable, I look forward to this beer every year. Ive neglected to sit-down and pen a proper review (i.e., ignore that on-tap review I wrote, for now). This is a very solid offering; it is quite the drinker.

Taste is slightly sweet, malty with moderate hop bitterness on the finish. Good mouthfeel, nicely carbonated. Very flavorful and easy to drink. I've had a couple six-packs of this this season, and it goes nicely with most meals. I'll be looking for this each fall.","jimdkc","Oct 25, 2004"

3.18,-12.9,4,3.5,3,3,3,"This is Boulevard's seasonal fall offering. I liked the color of this beer when I first poured it, quite a rusty red--very autumn-like. The head is as short lived as autumn colors though, and dissipates quickly; the lacing is equally fleeting. Not much on the nose, some hops, maybe a bit of banana. Taste is also underwhelming, just a basic light beer, not much taste or mouthfeel. I could knock back a half dozen or so of these and not be bloated or overly inebriated, so drinkability is a plus. Overall, a solid beer, but not remarkable (or one which I will seek out regularly).","Trentonator","Oct 09, 2004"
4,9.6,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"I'm not sure if it's my palate, but overall this hasn't been the 'must have' that the last few years of this seasonal has been, otherwise the 5s would be coming out for this one. It's still solid though and I'll enjoy it until the Nutcracker gets here though. Definitely worth a try if you can get it.","DPMomutant","Sep 26, 2004"
3.34,-8.5,3,4,3.5,2,3,"The body is quite thin...too thin to really enjoy the flavor of this beer. If it were a bit less watery, then I think this would be an excellent Oktoberfest.","GuinnessSmurf","Sep 26, 2004"

3.53,-3.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Light copper color, clear in presentation, resembles an orange-hued Marzen. Big rising head, very creamy. Laces cling in big sheet patterns. Nutmeg aroma, slightly nutty with a husky sense. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side, with reasonbly-done almost fluffy carbonation. Fruitier flavors than I expected, bright orange notes, a little fig, mixing in with a lightly caramel maltiness. Hops are not assertive, balance adequately without a distinguishing flavor that identifies type. Thins late in the impression and gets a little boring by the end of the glass.","ADR","Nov 17, 2003"
3.77,3.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours a amber color with a small off-white head. The retention is fairly good with a little lacing. The malty aroma is nice. The taste is also malty and lightly sweet, but overall it is well balanced. The body is medium, nice mouthfeel. Nice fall seasonal brew.","afinepilsner","Nov 12, 2003"
3.92,7.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"pours a clear bright amber brown with a short head. Aroma is heavier on the malt, floral hop, and herbal hints. quite tasty. Malt upfront and strong backbone with a great hop balance, and i detect some lemony herbal notes. Really a good smooth drinking medium bodied lager, I could easily see this as a session beer if it wasn't from so far away. Thanks to Nytmare for providing the sample.","mydeadguy","Nov 02, 2003"

4.1,12.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a nice, clear orange with a nice off white head. not much lacing. Decent retention. Smells of florally hops, bready malts, and caramel. Well balanced flavor with a nice bready flavor up front, crisp hops leave a nice aftertaste with a slight sourness at the end. Very nice mouthfeel. Enough carbonation to make it crisp, medium body. Slighty oily, but not overly so. These are quite good, and a great alternative to Sam Adams Lager, though slighty more expensive. If I have a few extra bucks, I'll buy these in the fall instead, for my sittin' in front of the TV watchin' the ball game beer. Mmmm.","Nytemare","Oct 16, 2003"
4.1,12.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"It pours a clean deep amber with a thin white head and minimal lacing. A breath of hops supports a fresh bread malty aroma. This is a nicely balanced lager with a lightly sweet, biscuity malt and butterscotch notes. The hops provide a mild citrus bitterness and slight metallic tang. The hops are very complimentary to the malt. A mellow herbal flavor and light dose of warming alcohol meld nicely to this highly gulpable brew.","BeerResearcher","Oct 12, 2003"
3.63,-0.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Bright amber-copper color, nice white foamy head that leaves a nice lacing in the glass. Has burnt roasted, malty caramel aromas, sweet and roasty malt flavors, medium bodied with a full and rounded mouthfeel, finishes clean with a nice sweetness. A pretty good fall brew, definitely worth a try.","maxpower","Sep 29, 2003"
3.82,4.7,3,3.5,4,4,4,"This style of beer is nowhere close to being one of my favorites, but Boulevard did an excellent job with this one. It seems a lot fuller and more balanced than others that I have tried.","Quaffer","Sep 23, 2003"

3.88,6.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This one is a dark orange/amber colored beer, with a white foamy head that takes off quickly. Looks real crisp/clear/refreshing. Its got that caramel malty scent to it that is familiar with this style. Pretty much same for the taste, very smooth, a slight and well balanced hop influence detected.. This is a lager that is worth enjoying.","Tballz420","Sep 09, 2003"

4.08,11.8,4,3.5,4,4,5,"Brilliantly clear ruddy deep bronze hue. Lanky, but steadfast off white head leaves sparse, muddled lace. Soft herbal hops accompanied by balmy, toasty Munich and toffeeish medium lovibond caramalt dominates the aroma. Hints of sugary, caramelized nut like melanoidins offer a Marzen esque twist. Buttery, light toffee sweetness upfront in flavor is complemented by a mellow toasted malt and nutty brittle combination. Bitterness augments mid palate, and is comprised of an agreeable suggestion of lightly singed French toast, which couples well with the subtle, persistent, woody maple like malt undertone. Light on the palate, but firmly dextrinous in mouthfeel, lending a pleasant, ashen viscosity conducive to quaffability. Finishes cleanly toasty, with fleeting, rounded hints of simple caramel. An understated, but superbly balanced and unique brew. Akin to a Marzen / Dortmunder hybrid. Rich in character, yet airy on the palate. Superlatively drinkable and nearly immaculately crafted. Another fine seasonal from Boulevard. 5.6% ABV.","marc77","Dec 10, 2002"
4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"All-around good choice for a tasty beer that is also not too heavy. It pours to a low, tight head that fades away to a ring around the glass. aromas are suggestive of Munich malts and a restrained noble hop character. Flavor is smooth, clear and very lagerlike with munich and crystal malt dominating, offset by the hops. Not a strong or extreme beer at all. Good for all occasions. This is simply good malty lager. An affordable alternative to Samual Adams Lager for those in Boulevard Territory.","EagleTalon","Dec 05, 2002"

The body is quite light and backs up a light malt flavor with a quick bitter bite to finish.  Not bad, but a little too light for my tastes.","beernut7","0"
