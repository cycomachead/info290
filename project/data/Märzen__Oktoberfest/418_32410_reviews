"The aroma and flavor are both nice enough but neither is extraordinary. The flavor in particular has plenty of malt, but it competes with the woody bitterness and alcohol. Not bad, at any rate."

"I just really didn't enjoy the beer"
"If I see a left hand beer I need it in both my right hand and left hand."
""
""
"o: A solid Marzen which I'm drinking a bit late for the season but which still works as a good dinner brew with fried scallops and baked potato."

"BBD 12/4/14.  Clear amber pour with a beautiful dark ruby cast.  Normal head and retention, excellent lacing.  Light nose of biscuit with caramel hints over a faint pear like citric note.  Almost medium body with a distinct creamy texture.  Heavier than most Oktoberfests, which is a plus.  Above average carbonation with a nice effervescence throughout.  The wonderful flavor profile is intense, complex and well balanced.  It begins with a burst of biscuit against a caramel backbone that effervesces into a mild bitterness in the middle.  The bitterness is herbal in nature (with a bit of rind), gives the tongue a nice tart pucker, then releases into pear notes.  The finish is clean and leaves you with a mild bitterness over a faint biscuit sweetness that is somewhat dry. One of best!"

"This is a decent Marzen.....sweet balanced by maize malt base.  The beer was a rich clear amber with thin head....that did not lace.  Body was medium with decent carbonation.  Overall...it was good."

"The perfect Oktoberfest. My favorite iteration of the style"

"Once again Left Hand Brewery comes through with a great addition to their beer family."
"Bright copper. Mildly bready nose.  The body was pretty good.   The flavor profile had a healthy maltiness upfront and a dry bitter finish.  This is a very, very good Oktoberfest."

"Pours a pretty dark amber in color with a small beige head that settles to a very thin layer on top and sides. Some spotty sticky lacing is seen when sipped. Lots going on with the aroma with what I can pick out, some caramel malts, toffee, bread and malts. More going on with the taste as it is full of flavor with some sweetness in the mix as well with some spice, nuts with a ever so slight hop finish. Very tasty and smooth brew overall. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. It could compete with some good German Oktoberfest brews! PROST!"

"Overall: A pretty solid take on the German Marzen style. Good toasty malt notes with some nice backing hops."
""
""
""

"Nice clear dark amber/orange color, with a one-finger head, left no lacing. Very malty aroma, with some herbal hop notes and just a touch of spice. Taste is bready malt and some noble bitter hops- ""herb"" as the Germans would say- just what an Oktoberfest beer should taste like. The mouthfeel is light, with a bit of prickly carbonation, again, reminds me of Oktoberfest!Overall, a pretty fine representation of the style- Left Hand gets it again!"
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a fluffy off white head that dissipates quickly. The beer itself is a clear copper that is a bit orange in color as well. The smell has a strong malty caramel smell and a tangy orange hop smell. The beer taste is similar to the smell. Although, the sweetness is a bit sweeter. The tangy orange hop taste works well because of the huge contrast between the two tastes. The mouthfeel is medium bodied but on the lighter side. The finish is smooth with very little carbonation. Overall, a pretty good Oktoberfest and one worth getting when available."

"O- This is a brilliant Oktoberfest."
"One of the best Octoberfest beers I've tried.  Very tasty without a ton of bitterness."

"Smooth taste, subtle hop characteristic"

"Outstanding Oktoberfest.  This is one of my favorite styles, and Left Hand knocks it out of the park.  Make sure you try this one in the fall.  A good friend who usually stays away from anything in the amber realm tried this and declared ""that is a damn good Oktoberfest", so there's all the endorsement you need."
"This was a great october fest. Very malty and crisp, nice carbonation. Deep ruby mahogany color and a thin head on the top. Mild lacing on the way down. Chives and cinnamon make up some nice undertones with the alcohol more noticeable to me than with many oktoberfests. Nice hop finish. Bought this as a single bottle... going back for a 6 pack tomorrow."
"This poured a lovely orange with yellow hues in it and good clarity. Had a fat head that fell slowly and left lace. Simply gorgeous in the glass. Reminds me of a pretty girl with a stature if you will. Nose is tempting with a hefty hit of toasted bread crust first that gives way to some light but luscious caramel. A faint bit of herbal on the nose a small hint that the very kernel of this grain might just be a bit nutty. Tastes just like that. Smooth, malty, a grainy little edge and a light little herbal. Sweet too. Rounds out at the back palate with a faint bitter. Drying, dry and lingers with a bit of malty sweetness. Lovely, clean and very good. Medium mouthfeel that is thin meaning not thick or heavy. Perfect!"
""
""
""
""
""
"I really enjoyed this, not easily  found in my area, nice and coppery, more foamy than lacy in the glass, very complex flavors, bread caramel and pepper. I would love to try this one on tap, have only seen around me in bottles"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Dry and effervescent."
""
""

"Revisiting this beer after an initial tasting a few weeks back. 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass...medium head, wonderful mild copper color. Nice aroma, malty with hints of spice. Classic Marzen body and taste. A very nice beer for this style, enjoyed best as the Fall sets in. Enjoy!"
"This Oktoberfest beer pours with a thick, luscious head that sticks to the glass; just what I love to see from a beer. A nice color, with aromas of biscuity, toasted grains and a faint sweetness. Flavors of grain predominate, with hints of cotton candy in the back. A nice offering of this style! One worth a second (or third!) try!."
"Malt bomb with a profile that's both sweet and clean. Smells like fall, a blend of pumpkin and stewed apple under a blanket of bread dough. As for the palate, it's all about rich malt character: buttery pie crust, pumpernickel, wheat toast, hints of apricot, marshmallow, and jammy stone fruit. Hops are faint, slightly peppering the back end of the profile for a  more clean, balanced finish (though the beer as a whole is nowhere near dry). A little on the sweet side for me, but that's its only flaw - everything else spells great drinking."

"Clear deep golden color with ok head and lacing. Aroma of malt and bread. Taste is sweet malt and bread with possibly some toasted almond. Finish is pretty clean with a bit of bitterness from what I would guess is the hops. Pretty balanced brew !!"
""
"T: Nice and sweet upfront. Caramel, toffee, and something like apple florality. Herbal hop flavor mid. Nice toasted biscuit throughout. Tastes like fall. As good as American Marzens get imho. (4.25/5)."

"This was a pretty good Marzen, good amount of roasted malts but a bit too sweet for me. Still, a good beer!"
""
""
""
"3.2/5: A competent marzen that's slightly too big for its own good"
""
""
"Copper colored lager with good clarity. Mildly roasted, caramel and spicy herbal aroma.  Nutty flavor. Lots of caramel. Spicy hop. Earthy texture. Crisp finish. Well carbonated. Good stuff."
""
""
""
"Pours a beautiful deep amber with a short lasting foamy white head. There is no lacing. The aroma is fruity with a hint of earthy. The taste has some of the fruit notes but also adds a nice bready depth to the malt profile. There is just a hint of hops on the finish. The body has a nice weight to it with a smooth finish and just a hint of carbonation. My first tastes weren't as good but it opened up with some air and a little warming."

"I really enjoyed this Oktoberfest. Its smooth and rich with caramel, honey, and buttery roasted malts. I also get lighter notes of orange peel, baking spice and toffee. Altogether, its one of the best Oktoberfest beers I have had in a while! love it!"

"Best in class American Marzen? Must try. Eager to share with friends. A bit more alcohol than others."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a really nice Oktoberfest. It is definitely ""American"" in terms of strength and hoppyness but it pulls it off well. A good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Another very, solid American version of an Oktoberfest beer. Very, very good! Great balance between malt, sweet and bitter. Certainly another beer to add to my Oktoberfest rotation!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: an awesome American marzen. Great balance, nutty malt character with floral and slightly minty hop character. I Definitely suggest this marzen to anyone!"

"O: Enjoyable beer, good seasonal offering."
""
""

"O: A nice change for an octoberfest style beer. I love the hop taste that it ads. A solid beer that I would definitely drink again, though I don't know that I would actively seek it out."
""
""
"This pours a clear, amber color with a slight off-white head. The aroma is mild with scents of toasted malt and spices. The texture is smooth and creamy delivering a great tasting Oktoberfest. Finishes with a slight hoppy spice after taste. Very well made and probably one of the better Oktoberfest beers I have had in awhile"
"This beer has a nice ruby brown body with a small head that hangs out for a little bit. The aroma has a malty, sweet carmel aroma to it. The taste has a great strong malt flavor up front then it mellows out towards the finish. The mouthfeel is very nice and a very good represation of the style."
""
""
""
"Overall - pretty good representation of the style"
""
""

"This is a refreshing beer, albeit a little unremarkable. I wouldn't mind drinking this again, but won't go out of my way to do so."

"Another good Oktoberfest to enjoy this fall. I am a fan of Oktoberfest's, this one did not disappoint. An amber, rich copper color, good off white head, great lacing. Smelled of caramel malt, a nuttiness in there. Taste was just the right balance of everything in an Oktoberfest, there was the slight sweetness offset with the bitterness, nice crispness. Over all one of my new favorites"
"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and an above average example of the style, it was pretty true to style and it had most of the things that I look for in a good Marzen, This beer had nice drinkability, it's a little strong for the style but it was still pretty smooth and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I don't think it would be a problem for me to drink a couple of these. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was pretty nice, true to style and I liked how clean it was. What I liked the least about this beer was the alcohol, I think it should be toned down just a little to make this even more true to style. I would buy this again next year, I'm not sure I would get a whole six pack. but I'm sure I would revisit it again and it's priced well. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the style, All in all I thought this was a pretty solid example of an Oktoberfest, it's not my favorite of the style, but it's still pretty above average. Good job Left Hand, this is a worthy Oktoberfest."
""
"Judgement - Try"
"look is a sorta cloudy pumpkin color with a ring of foam. smell is light and pleasant: pulpy pumpkin, some spice, sweet caramel malt. there is a slight burnt flavor (and some of that dry leaves going on) but it's mostly clean and not too sweet or spiced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Got this for the first time in a 64oz growler. Pours well, nice 1/4"" thick, foamy head. Appears a clear amber/golden brown. Crisp initial taste, malty. Goes down very well. A mild hoppiness towards the end and finishes with a crisp. Not a huge Oktoberfest-type beer fan, but this one does it well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Malt forward, as expected, with good toasted character, but the esters and metallic notes are slightly offputting. Had they not been present, this would've fared better."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is malty, some sweetness. Taste is of malts, a bit of spice, toasty, some alcohol is present. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer, a bit stronger than most of this style, but still highly drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Superb, one of the best of its style. Great job guys!!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was fine, but I wasn't too blown away."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is where this beer really shines. The caramel flavor is rich in the maltiness. The hint of spice late in the taste really sets this beer apart. Mouth is thin as per style, but this is overall a beer that may bring me back to lagers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A good Oktoberfest, but that hop character I was tasting does not fit the overall style. I would get this again, but keeping in mind that this is not supposed to mimic a traditional German Oktoberfest-Märzen."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good Oktoberfest. Clean and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The feel is watery thin with very little carbonated touch. I'd like a thicker more solid feel but other than that I found this to be a rather good Oktoberfest."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is pretty bad."
"Summary - Really, this is almost an amber ale. I'm not impressed. It's not bad, but not a great example of an Oktoberfest Marzen."
""
""
""
""
""
"O) This is a solid Oktoberfest. It wouldn't be my first, or second, or third option, but it would be an option at some point."
""
""
"Very well done American take on the märzen. I'd drink this again."
"O: It stays true enough to style, but it's more complex than most. Somewhat reminiscent of a kirta-halbe. You can drink a lot of it, yet it won't get boring. Very well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The more I drink this, the more I enjoy it. A little bigger-boned than a lot of Octoberfests on the market these days, but that's the way I like 'em. Up there with the best American-made Octoberfest lagers. Makes me crave some German food badly."
""
""
""
"Overall a very drinkable Marzen, one of the better ones I have tried."
""
"This is a very solid Oktoberfest. It's pretty straight forward, but there's enough to keep you interested. Nice flavors."
""
"This is definitely one of the better Oktoberfests! Don't miss out on it."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear auburn to burnt orange hue. Nice thin white head. Balanced mouthfeel. Pretty much perfect taste for a Marzen style. No real heavy aroma to speak of. Who doesn't look forward to mid-August every year? Fall and Winter Seasonal's is when most breweries get to expand their horizons without being ""weird"". This offering from Left Hand is for sure a good one to get your hands on."

"Overall, I'd definitely get this beer for my friends for a party."
"O- This is a bad beer. Im usually optimistic when reviewing beers but this one is just plain bad. I hope the bottle I got is just a rotten one because left hand's beers are usually pretty decent."
""
""
"This is a flavorful marzen but the intense yeast notes throughout are overpowering. the hops are a bit bitter as well and interfere with the caramel. In the end it's a highly drinkable and sessionable. It's worth a try, but I think there are better Oktoberfest beers out there."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 8/7/2012. Pours slightly hazy orange copper color with a small foamy white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big pear, apple, biscuit, toast, caramel, earth, herbal, and light nuttiness. Nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of caramel, biscuit, toast, pear, herbal, apple, earth, and nuttiness. Lingering notes of caramel, light fruit, biscuit, toast, and herbal on the finish for a bit. Good balance of malt flavors; with no cloying sweetness after the finish. A slight twangy flavor noted on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice Oktoberfest. Good flavor profile and balance; very smooth to drink. Quite enjoyable."
""

""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, bottled on 08/07/12. This pours an amber color with a decent off white head. The smells are of caramel, toffee, bread. The feel is medium higher than expected carbonation. Taste is good a little copper flavor, some caramel some toffee."
""
"A pretty solid tasting Oktoberfest with a nice sweetish caramelized taste, one of the better drinks for this time of year."
""
""
""
""
"Color is a dark amber. Small amount of head foam. Not a huge smell, but smells nice. Plenty of spice in the taste. Yeah, it taste like fall. A really good version of this style in my opinion. Not very bitter, and not real sweet."
""
""
""
""
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was an ugly off amber color and poured no head at all. UGLY!. The beer smelled pretty good though with hits of nuttiness. The beer also had good lacing which was strange since it had no head. The beer was pretty good tasting though with that nuttiness that I really liked. I will buy again."
"Better than I expected as I had not had anything from this brewery until recently. Excellent choice for those of you looking for an Oktoberfest that's a tad higher in ABV than Shiner or Sam Adams for example. Goes well with food as well as without. Cool label to boot. Here's to craft beer!"
""
""
"O: Although this beer is quite malty, it’s rather easy to drink because the body isn't that heavy."

"O - An awesome octoberfest beer. I am not a big fan of the style, but I think this is great. Well done Oktoberfest. Puts me in the fall spirit."
"This is a wonderful beer for the style. Dare I say it's one of the best I've had in the style. What a nice little discovery."
"I prefer a Marzen to a pumpkin, would try this fall brew again."
""
"Overall not bad and really nothing I would seek out again. A side note very sick cover art a wolf with fire breathing dragons? WOW!"
"Overall a decent beer, just not one that I particularly go for."
"This is a very well-balanced beer and one of the better Oktoberfests I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- It's an ok, slightly-above-average octoberfest."
""
""
""
"Beer poured red amber in color. Head was light and did not hold on long. Smelled malty and lightly bready. Taste was good for someone to start out with that is not familiar with the marzen style. A good beginner beer. taste was lightly malty, I thought, with small amount of noble hop presence some caramel and nutty notes. Pretty well rounded and balanced. Hence the good starter beer label. I would drink it again. Not sure if I would go out of my way to buy it though. Mouthfeel was clean with decent medium body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cranberry red fused with a touch of amber. A quick living greyish white head that leaves rather quickly leaving behind a sampling of it around the edges. A sweet and spicy aroma, malt forward 110% of the way. Bready, caramel, nutty and cloves, cloves, and a little more cloves. Flavor is strong on the clove, the nuttiness, caramel and bread is definitely right there with it too though. A crisp medium to full body to this. Overall, meh. Not too familiar with the style but I do believe Great Divide's Hoss is a similar style, but with rye malt included, and I prefer that to this for sure. Glad I only bought a single of this...though not even sure I care to finish this one bottle of it."

"O - very solid American brewed Märzen for Oktoberfest."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"mouthfeel - good carbonation, medium body to thick bodied for style. very very drinkable."
"pours a beautiful deep copper with a frothy head indicative of the style. the nose is biscuity, definitely malty. vibrant mouthfeel, malty but not sweet. extremely palatable but not a standout amongst the autumn offerings. better on drinkability than most as well, ill enjoy the other 5 tonight."
"A fair representation of the style, not particularly exciting, refreshing, or inviting to me. I don't think I'd buy this again, but would drink if gifted."
"This brew poured out as a nice orange brown color, perfect for the time of year it's released in. The head was white and a fizzy. There really isn't much lacing here. The smell of the beer has some nice earthy spice notes on the nose. The taste of the beer has a little more of a hoppiness that I wasn't expecting. The mouthfeel of the beer was decent, had a nice balance and everything but just wasn't overly impressed by it. Overall this beer isn't a bad one for the style. I'd drink it again if I saw it around."
"Not a bad American tribute to a Bavarian classic. It pours a nice red color with an orange hue. There is some light tan head and lace that is a bit sticky with about average retention. There is a good malty aroma. The flavor is very sweet and grainy. There is a bitter finish that is very refreshing. The body is medium and true to the style."
"Overall, this is a pretty good beer, not my favorite Oktoberfest, but very solid"
"Decent example of the style."
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors are nice and there is a bit of variation on the normal marzen style. The hop presence and fruity additions were very welcomed."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into dimpled glass. One of my top oktoberfest biers. Pours brilliant copper with a solid stand of off-white head. Aroma is fairly sweet with lightly toasted malts and some noble hops (especially on the pour) imparting some nice cherry and oaky notes. Flavor is mild and pleasant with a soft, clean lightly toasted maltiness. Moderately dry throughout, but moreso in the finish. Body is rather light, but the mouthfeel is smooth with medium light carbonation. This is a really easy drinker and pretty solid style-wise."
"Pours clear dark amber with a small offwhite head. Aroma of sweet malts, caramel, some fruitiness. Taste is same as aroma with some light hops. Palate is medium body, good carbonation. Finish is sweet bready malts, caramel, some light bitterness. Overall an easy drinking brew."
"This attractive and arty beer (with complex and creative bottle renderings) pours a deep amber with an average head. The olfactories reveal an odor of fruit and yeast. Quite appealing already! The taste is crisp and even sweet up front, followed by a slight hop zing in the followthrough. Seems stronger and heartier than most lagers, and this one was a pleasure to finish."
"Pours a moderate copper-bronze color with a white head and some pretty good lacing. The nose is some light caramel and bready plus some earthy, floral, and lightly-spicy hops. Really nice. I appreciate what they've done with these beers. While this may be overdone with some styles, I like how there's a fairly-pronounced hop presence in this brew. Good feel and all around this is a nice brew. Also, doesn't hurt that the artwork on the label is totally awesome."
"Drinkability was good. Strange dark fruit flavor was a little off-putting."
"D - Very good stuff."
"Nice job overall - fits in very well with the spririt (nice artwork) and drinkability (minimal ingredients) of the style."
"D- Has pretty unique taste compared to others. I find this one pretty easy to drink."
"Good malt forward Marzen. It's rich and the complex malt profile will have you guessing."
"Verdict: one of the more pronounced oktoberfests in terms of flavor. It certainly beats out most of the pale-malted, noble-hopped, domestic excuses for the genre that turn up too frequently."
"Are there better Marzens out there? Sure, but you could do much worse than enjoying a few pints of this beer in the cooler days of fall, especially if you're not a hop head."
"Overall, a well put together marzen with some unique fruitiness to it. I think I'll have another."
"Pours a dark copper, nice red and orange hue. Off-white head with OK lacing and retention. Sweet smell, caramel and toffee mostly. Very malty flavor profile. Big sweet caramel malt, toffee and biscuit. Great malt combination. A hint of the usual octoberfest hops at the finish, but not much balance to be found. Still a very good taste. The malts are really excellent. Very creamy and thick mouthfeel for a Marzen that goes down easy."
"D- It's a decent version of a Marzen. It's quite substantial and malty. It might not be quite as refined as the upper echelon."
"Drinkability - not a bad brew at all. Not quite as full-bodied as I would have hoped for , but still interesting. Good tasting and easy to drink."
"Pours a nice copper color with some red orange and re highlights. The aroma has that peanut shell goodness and lager yeast that makes this closer to it's German counterparts. There is a caramel initial taste but a bitter flavor at the end that leaves the palate dry. Nice carbonation and a nice sweetness that plays well. Overall this is a good example of American marzens and what they can bring to the table. Not the best but good."
"Though it was bigger than expected, I enjoyed it for a change from the traditional 'fest seasonal."
"(chilled bottle poured into a pint glass)"
"Drinkability: This beer is ""ok"" for drinkability. I've had better Oktoberfests though and so I would drink it if offered but not go out of my way to have another."
"This one was a malt showcase, and a pretty good one at that. The overall sweetness was solid, but kept in check by a sturdy hop bill. Definitely drinkable and enjoyable."
"Nicely malty but hops bitterness a little harsh and more assertive than I prefer, different from some of the German Oktoberfests or marzens. Not the best but far from the worst..."
"pours a mostly clear copper color with a 1 finger head some lacing on side of glass it looks good..smell is malts some spice a vienna malts smell with toffee and bread...taste is malts and bread with some spices like nutmeg and cinnamon some hops and citrus come into play and some toffee malts..mouth feel is medium its tasty and typical of a marzen ..drinkable and tasty not the best but still good"
"D - Fantastic fall beer! It's a very well-brewed oktoberfest with epic drinkability. I'd pour these into a liter mug if I had enough!"
"This is not the sessionable sort of Oktoberfest that you are probably looking for. Compared to, say, Sam Adams' subtle, excellent example of the style, Left Hand's is downright imperialized. This will appeal to some people. I was looking for a crisp Marzen and this heavy, flavor-dense rendition of the style wasn't it."
"Left Hand Oktoberfest was a dark amber color with good clarity. It had a creamy beige head that didn't last but managed to leave some lacing behind. The smell was sweet malt and a touch toasty. The taste was full of toasty malt with a little spice and fairly dry finish. Mouthfeel was good; just over medium bodied with medium carbonation. Drinkabity was good. This is a good Oktoberfest and worth trying."
"Nice amber/orange with sticky head. Slightly herbal aroma. Herbaceous notes continue in flavor profile, but there was a slightly odd acidic tartness up front that ran through the flavor and seemed out of place for the style. Not enough to be a major problem, but a discordant note in an otherwise well made beer."
"Pours a clear dark copper with one finger of off-white head with that holds itself aloft for quite a while. Aromas are predominantly sweet, with more toffee than toastiness. There's a hint of earthy hops in there if you sniff at it hard enough. Overall the nose is nice but unrepresentative of the style. The taste is a bit closer to that of a traditional Oktoberfest, with plenty of toast on the front and mid-palates. A strong brown sugar flavor makes it a bit sweeter than most Oktoberfests, but the extra richness doesn't turn me off; it just makes me sip it a bit slower. A low hopiness on the finish adds an additional layer. Overall, it's fun to sip but is not even remotely sessionable."
"Cheers..."
"I had Left Hands Octoberfest for the first time last year. This year it tastes alot different. I found this years to be less flavourful. It almost tastes like a watered down version of a lesser quality Octoberfest. Very dissapointed with this years brew."
"D- Complex malts make it very drinkable"
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Showed a brownish orange with good head and retention. Smell was faint of sweet malts, some caramel and bready notes as well. Taste was similar, light bodied, high carbonation, all malt. Very sweet and mellow. Some good malt complexity."
"Slainte."
"D: A good, session Oktoberfest"
"The flavor matches the smell profile. Thick, creamy mouthfeel. Slightly sweet, this is a malty beer of lighter crystal (or darker pale). There's enough hop to be noticeable--still it's subtle."
"This beer feels good and is very easy drinking as most Maerzens tend to be. It was a decent start to the Oktoberfest beer season."
"D: I could easily drink 6 or more of these at a time. A very good beer."
"the blue and white checkered tiger bottle art is a bit strange for the style, tho this of course did not affect my review in any way."
"D - The only complaint I could think of is that the dark fruits seem to take over the alt flavors in the rich example of an Oktoberfest-style beer. Fantastic otherwise all around. One of the best examples of its style I have ever enjoyed."
"D - Impeccably balanced with an excellent malt character, this is a perfectly drinkable fest beer. The malt is soft and rich with no harsh edges of husky flavor or burt toast. There is only a light hop presence, but it is enough to balance the beer and influence the palate in a way that brings out the best in the malt. This is a great beer and once of the best lagers that I have had from a US brewery."
"Pours a DEEP golden orange, decent tannish head. Many slow carbonation trailers. Looks good. Smells good too - deep, dense roasted (but not too toasted) malts that have a high sweet note. Taste is as complex than the smell, dark cake-like with a bit of mineral. The feel is oh-so-smooth and low, with a nice bitterness after the sip. All In all, a darn tasty marzen, and the best brew I've yet to sample from Left Hand. Very nice."
"Left Hand Brewing Company--Oktoberfest Marzen Lager--Malt Liquor--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 6.60% ABV. 30 IBU's. (4.25+ / 5.0) Thin white orange thin lace head. Clear thin bright pretty rich dark orange ruby color. Mild hop toasted malt ester front. Fully fermented thin dry sweet tangy toasted sweet caramel fruit malty Fest body. Smooth dry sweet mild hop lingering Festy end. Sampled 9/7/2010. 6- Pack Purchased @ PCC--Fremont, Seattle 8/24/2010 For $7.25."
"Crazy label design with the blue and white cat on the Bavarian color background but it did catch my eye. The beer is a clear, copper color with two fingers of head that had decent retention before settling to a thin cap. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. Aroma is by far the weakest component of this beer. Like, where is it? Just the faintest whiff of malt. The flavor is on the sweet side but is balanced by a noticeable hop bitterness. The malt flavor is very tasty indeed. Clean and refreshing. The body is light to moderate with a nice carbonation that does not get in the way of consumption. Quite enjoyable fall beer. Well crafted."
"Nicely drinkable and balanced, though I tend more towards the Ayinger-model of paler, grassier oktoberfests as a personal preference. Does nothing to take away from the fact that this is a pretty nice beer."
"drinkability is great - this is the 5th and last oktoberfest beer i bought this weekend and it is by far the best"
"Drinkability- well this is at this point of my life the best octoberfest beer I have ever had, its complex and balance while still hitting the right amount on malts, very delicous and one i will recommend big time to other beer fans to try, an octoberfest at its finest match this up against any german octoberfest out there!"
"New '10 Oktoberfest from a bottle. Wow, props to Left Hand because this is a great example of a Marzen done right. Talk about balanced. Pours a beautiful carmel/orange color with a decent head that quickly recedes. Taste and drinkability is where this beer really shines. Nothing is overpowering. You experience that caramel, bready sweetness you expect from a Marzen, but it finishes surprisingly crisp with no syrupy aftertaste or mouthfeel you might expect. Each sip is like experiencing this beer anew. Drinkability is through the roof and i could easily drink more than a six pack if i wanted to take it to the limit. I highly recommend this beer. For lager fans it's a must, for beer fans in general you can't miss with this one."
"D - These go down fast and easy."
"So far, flying dog's offering was much better..."
"Not a fan of this one."
"Taste-Toasted sweet malt, caramel notes, slight hop bite that seems to stand apart, rather than playing nicely with the malt, giving a bit of an unbalanced feel. That being said, a pretty nice version of the style."
"Pours a rich/deep orange color with a nice light white foam that dies down in a short period of time to leave but a small remnant on the surface. When first sniffed after the pour there is a large malty smell to the beer that reminds of citrus. There is a distinct aroma from the german hops as well. The taste is quite pleasant on the tastebuds. The beer is dead on for the style an in my opinion as good of a version as you're going to find in America on the store shelves. Those german hop varieties so through slightly in the taste but don't leave any bitterness in the beer which is highly desirable for myself. The yeast flavoring on the back is quite interesting it has slight and very short lived hints of banana and cotton candy. Neither of which are strong enough to detract from the rich malty flavor of the beer itself. The feel is quite smooth and an appropriate viscosity. This is a highly drinkable, highly refreshing beer. Overall it is quite delicious and a definite recommendation from this reviewer."
"Overall, I dug this. A great domestic version. Sweet, toasted, light bitter, fruit, clean. I mean, what more can you ask for?"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and nicely carbed with a clean finish. Just a touch too sticky/sugary for me. Overall, I enjoyed this but there are some better O-fest beers out there. This one is just average even among the American takes on the style and isn't as stand-out as I remember."
"D-not bad, it goes down very easy, but not the most interesting beer"
"D - With the odd taste and the lack of carbonation, finishing these is not the easiest task."
"D-Very drinkable Oktoberfest. I only purchased a single, but will be buying more when it gets cooler outside. Great beer."
"Mouthfeel is a medium body, maybe a little on the lighter side. Carbonation could probably use a little extra kick to cut the sticky texture, but overall it is mostly in the right place. Very nice drinkability, I could easily get into the Oktoberfest spirit and put a few down in short time."
"F: Finishes mostly dry, with just a touch of that lingering syrupy sweetness. More of the harvest toasty malts with the syrup. A bitterness comes out a little more on the finish as well, with a hint of spicy hops. Mostly clean and crisp, a nice Oktoberfest IMO."
"D - Good drinkable Fest beer."
"Poured a clear medium dark mahogany amber with a less than one finger off white head with a little lacing. Sweet malty aromas dominated thru out with a slight grassy hops tint finish. Clean, crisp, with a nice sweet malty punch to the palette with good carbonation for this medium light Marzen. I give this brew two thumb up on the drinkability scale."
"We sized this one up and it came through like a champ. Not only does it have the upper hand for freshness compared to its German counterparts, but it drops a complex but drinkable malt bomb on the taste buds. Worthy of a mass ja!"
"12-oz bottle. Substantial head with rings of lacing. Clear amber color. Aroma is sweet and malty with a hint of apple. The lfavor is uncomplicated. Lightly malty and sweet. Texture feels a little watery. Finishes clean but unfortunately with some mild tinniness."
"The beer pours a dark gold/amber color with a 1/2"" off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has an incredibly malty scent that boasts of pilsner, Munich, and bisquit malts. There is a real caramel/toffee feel here. The taste is decent as well. Again, it's a little bit over done with the malts. It has a dry, caramel/toffee flavor that goes down easy with some prickly carbonation. There are some light bready notes in there as well. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a pretty good Marzen/Oktoberfest. It's big on malts and very drinkable."
"D - This is an easy to drink ofest beer that won't really challenge you good to drink while listening to ompa music on a fall day"
"Good drinkable okto style brew. Good for those cool fall nights. Not my favorite in the style, but a decent brew."
"Dark copper liquid filled my glass with a small amount of head that could not hide the malty goodness that filled my nose. For taste there was a sweet mixture of toffee and grain. After finishing my glass I felt that it was very nice. Sorry, no fancy review tonight."
"Goes down easy. Looks, tastes and smells good. For some reason I got kinda into this one this fall."
"Drinkability: As said above, very easy to drink these and very good tasting. I'd definitely recommend this one to anyone who likes this style of beer!"
"D - Everything about this beer is pleasant...but just pleasant, nothing stands out. If I was craving a marzen style and couldn't get my hands on a Paulaner, I would grab one of these."
"Taste strikes a nice balance of bitter hop presence and sweet caramel maltiness. The relatively high ABV is detectable but certainly does not approach being hot. Carbonation is somewhat low for a lager and the mouthfeel is a tad below medium. This one is a pretty fast drinker and I was surprised this bottle was the last of a six pack bought a week or so ago. Sure there are better O-fests out there, but this one is pretty solid and I will be ready to buy again next year, I am glad we finally get this offering in Tx."
"12oz went down quick, and I'm sure a fat Liter would do the same."
"Medium bodied, leaning toward light and moderately carbonated. Clean and quenching on the whole. A relatively simple, uncomplicated, solid marzen."
"Medium bodied with a slight film from the hops. A bit crisp for a marzen."
"Pours a copper color with a fair amount of carbonation and a 2 finger head that fizzes away. Minimal lacing lines the glass. Nose is malty with notes of caramel and bready dough. Taste is quite sweet with floral notes along with fruits and raisins. Mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied and drinkability is solid. The appearance and taste are right on queue. As far as Marzen's this is up there near the top on my list."
"Was expecting a bit more from Left Hand but still a decent effort. Try their Milk Stout."
"Pours an orange-amber color with a small white head, which quickly dissipates. Smell is very malty, with some caramel and bread aromas. About what you would expect from a Marzen. Taste is malty sweetness with a lot of fruit in the flavor. Little to no hops are apparent. The beer is very crisp, but a litte thin on the mouthfeel."
"Bottle poured into a standard pint glass. Really nice color. On the browner side of copper, I'd say. Produced a nice head that carried up some of the color. It has a familiar Marzen sweet malt aroma, and a little sourness that I can't identify. The taste was dissappointing. To me, the hops and malts are clashing. It's like there is a good Marzen in there, but it is being subdued by a harsh metallic bite. Maybe the high carbonation contributes to this. Great brewery, but I don't care for this one."
"A serviceable Marzen, but by no means on the top of my list."
"D - After drinking one, I really don't have the urge to open another. Still, it's a good beer, and a unique interpretation of the style."
"The taste is about average for a Marzen from the USA. Muted with a little malt, a taste that goes well with a wide range of foods. A great pizza beer."
"Drinkability: Absolutely one of the most enjoyable oktoberfests I've ever had. I wasn't expecting this beer to be as enjoyable as it is. Awesome."
"Decent enough beer as a good drinking oktoberfest, though not enough to buy again."
"One of the worst Oktoberfests I have tasted."
"D: A good but overly sweet marzen that is interesting but not in the upper tier."
"D: Too sweet and hoppy to be truly sessionable. A decent marzen, but there's several others that are better, in my opinion."
"Bottle: Poured a deep cloudy amber color lager with a medium size foamy head with good retention and not much lacing. Aroma of sweet caramel malt is really dominant. Taste is more accentuated then expected with huge caramel malt backbone with nice balancing residual sugar aftertaste. Body is full with some limited filtration and good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. Very well done for the style with great character."
"D- A fantastic take on the style. Tasty and makes for a great beer on a cool evening."
"Overall, a decent Oktoberfest but it's a little heavy on the caramel-type malts for my liking."
"Taste is surprisingly of hops at the get go. Nice major hop bite at the start the leads in to a bready flavoring capped by toffee and caramel malts. Light to medium bodied,medium carbonation, goes down smooth with a slightly sticky finish. Not a bad beer, but I wouldn't seek it out."
"D - Goes down pretty smooth. A bit too sweet for me to have more than a couple."
"Not a bad effort from Left hand. After trying about half and dozen different Octoberfests this year, I would say that Bells Octoberfest and Great Lakes Octoberfest are the two best ones I have had. Seek those ones out before any of the other big name ones. This one is better than most, but still nothing to write home about."
"Medium body, adequate carbonation. Pretty easy to drink and overall enjoyable."
"A little bit murky. Interesting. I'm just looking for a classic Marzen right now. It's late September."
"By no means is this a bad beer, and it should definitely be tried."
"A pretty good American version of an Oktoberfest. A good fall beer that is worth a try."
"Drank it straight from the bottle, so I cannot attest for appearance. I was expecting to get punched in the mouth with flavor but this oktoberfest was not nearly as complex as I was hoping for. Kind of flat and not much fun. I'm not going to waste a single bottle, but I would not purchase them again."
"D: One of the more differently-flavored American marzens I've tasted. Quite earthy and rather spicy. Distinctive, but in a mostly neutral way. Worth a try at least."
"Another festbier. Here goes. Poured into my pint glass the beer is dark orange brown with just a touch of haze. The head is about an inch and light beige in color. The head leaves a decent amount of creamy lace around the rim. The aroma is mild malt. Some sweetness with a touch of wet grass. The flavor is malty up front then a sweet grassiness with a nice bready finish. Dry as a bone with medium body and moderate carbonation. Overall a nice marzen. Put on the pile with others."
"Drinkability: I am glad I tried it, but it is one of my least favorites from Left Hand. The usual over the top maltiness from Left Hand is missing from this one. Just an OK Octoberfest, I will not be seeking this one again."
"overall this is a good, easy drinking o-fest, but there are too many that are far better, so i probably wont buy it again."
"D - I've had a lot better (as well as a lot worse) marzens. A little over-sweet and one dimensional. Somewhat boring."
"Conclusion: Starts really nice, but ends a bit short. Decent enough Oktoberfest bier, nonetheless."
"The mouth is crisp, yet smooth. Moderate amount of carbonation. The flavor is a bit different than the other O'fest beers I've sampled this fall. This one is much maltier and full of caramel goodness. This reminds me of a tamed down amber ale. This was pretty good. I like the take on the style here. I'd have this again for sure."
"M/ D - Med mf and moderate carb. Good for style and has nice earthy flavors to balance with great malt flavor"
"Overall a great looking beer and then it goes down hill very steeply and quickly. I am glad I only bought a single of this. Many more much better O-fests out there for sure."
"Although Iam a self cofessed hop head I do like to drink the fest-marzen style during this time of year and I seek em out.This poured a brilliant bronze color with a lacey white head,aromas were of German malt, iron and toast etc...I like the fact that caramel doesnt dominate the flavor profile,way to many American versions are to sweet for me,this isnt.Flavors have toasty element to it with light caramel sweetness,in the finish there is a herbal smack wich is nice.This seems to be more traditional than alot of other American versions,very nice."
"Enjoyed on-tap at Stub and Herbs in Minneapolis, MN. Poured a deep, dark amber body with a thin off-white head. Aroma of spice and sugar. Medium bodied with medium carbonation, this beer's flavors were mainly toasted and caramel malts. Very good version of an Octoberfest beer."
"Overall, a nice drinkable Oktoberfest."
"CHEERS!!"
"Very drinkable and a nice addition to the Oktoberfest beers I have tried. I purchased this six pack at Richey's East in Pensaola. I wish this brewery were distributed here in Tallahassee. This is a good solid beer and I want to try more from this brewery now!"
"D - This is a great Octoberfest. I really enjoyed this brew."
"Drinkability is eh. Its not bad, its just bland. Not robust enough."
"Pours a clear, red/amber color. 2/3 inch head of a pale tan color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of yeast, slight roasted malt, slight hops, and some grain. Fits the style of a Marzen / Oktoberfest. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, yeast, slight roasted malt, sweet malt, and a little nut. Overall, a rather watery mouth feel and only average body."
"This beer is a wonderful deep copper color with a thin, but soapy, white head. The aroma is modestly composed of pale and lightly toasted malts. The taste is equally malty...plus some decent melanoidin action here. It's a little sweeter than necessary...the taste also has a distant fruit component (think peaches). It's definetly not as clean as I would have liked. It finishes a touch sweeter than necessary as well. The mouthfeel is a moderately full. All in all, however, this is a decent, pretty complex, and fairly enjoyable Marzen-style brew."
"D: This beer just doesn't smell and taste good enough to warrant a second glass."
"Overall a pretty enjoyable offering. It's not at the top of my Oktoberfest list, but it'd do in a pinch!"
"The drinkability is quite good if you like your Oktoberfest beers on the sweeter side. Very smooth, almost no bitterness. Overall, this is a decent Oktoberfest beer, but it is lacking in complexity and has little going on besides the sweet malt flavor."
"This beer pours a clear light amber color. The head is a half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is toffee and bready malt with no real hop character. It is quite pleasant though. The taste is very sweet even for the style. In fact, I think it is best described as annoyingly sweet. The mouthfeel is sticky, medium bodied, and lively carbonated. Overall, this is an Oktoberfest I do not enjoy, and can't see myself drinking again."
"Drinkability: Not bad, decently drinkable, and certainly better than when I had it a few years prior on draft."
"D- Only bought this one, that will probably be it."
"Drinkability: Excellent Marzen, although the bitterness is a bit high for the style. Paulaner had always been my favorite. This year, now that I have experienced a lot more beer, I prefer this one over it. Great job."
"D - Very easy to drink."
"Drinks very well, perfect autumn beer."
"D: Very quaffable. I judge this by how quickly I make the return move to my lips...this is a quick one!"
"D: Not a bad beer overall, but I noticed a great deal of residual sweetness in this beer that really killed it for me. Won't be grabbing a second bottle."
"I was in one of my, ""Spring Oktoberfest"" moods and picked this up today. It is a bit outta date, but O'fests are just as good a few months late. Nice pour with a white, cushy head..goes down a bit quick. Smells of caramel and whiskyish malt. Very pleasant. Nice taste, hits the taste buds hard and washes down clean with a peaty zest. I can tell you now, I wish I had more than one of these. Nice smooth, dry finish. I would say this is a nice flavored Oktoberfest and I will pick it up again."
"Very bready nose with some sugar. Lots of malt, more than in most fests. Caramel overtones in the intial hit, which ties in to the sugary nose. Good body balance. The finish leaves a slight off taste for me, though, but that may be a factor of the age of the sample rather than a quality of the beer."
"D: Overall a easy drinking October, decent session though much better examples are out their to pass the time with."
"Drinkability: A very nice style interpretation that is as good or better than it's German counterparts. Perfect 6.0% alcohol. Lingering sweetness is nice. Will be revisiting this beer."
"The aroma is papery and metallic, with cereal and herbal hops. The appearance is amber with a nice head. The flavor is like the aroma and strange. The palate is typical for the style. Overall this proves vet again why I am not in love with Oktoberfest beers."
"D - As if you haven't noticed, I've been really impressed with this brew. This is one of the most sessionable beers in this most sessionable of styles. Could be a new ""go-to"" beer for me."
"Pretty average marzen, here. Pours decent with a good head and a typical marzen hue. Smells like a bit of bready malt, but overall a weak nose, nothing impressive. Tastes pretty average, nothing stands out. As it warms some sweetish candy caramel flavor comes through, which is pretty much the single standout flavor of this beer. Overall pretty average with a few special notes, but passable when compared to Flying Dog and Hacker-Pschorr's marzen brews."
"A few of these will do me fine, as they warm up without losing their goodness. Left Hand won against Mendocino, but next fall I'll do a complete 16-team Octoberfest playoff competition, including the big bad Germans."
"The more I drank this one, the warmer it got, and the more it grew on me. I liked the maltiness of it, but a nice little tinge of the hops in the end. It also had a slight smokiness to it, which was present in the taste and the smell. Of course, there's a big nutty/earthy presence throughout. Not too bad of a Marzen."
"Not very good. I've grown to love this style this season, but this is one of the weakest of the bunch. Aroma is good..caramel and malt. Pour was as nice as any O/M. Light brown with a nice 1 finger white head. Taste was another story. A little too caramelly. There is a stickiness that overpowers the beer with the caramel and not much to balance it."
"Overall while not my favorite fest beer of the season, it was definitley drinkable. A little light, and not as full of flavor as I would have liked, but still decent. I would give this one a shot again."
"Very drinkable. Not very exciting, but a pretty decent take on the style compared to other American O-fests."
"This poured a clear auburn with a bit of dark tan head. It smelled like roasted barley and wheat malt with copper and lemon hops. It tasted like strong copper hops and sweet barley and caramel malts, with a bit of cider spice. It was watery with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this had pretty good flavor and decent body, but seemed a little too hoppy for an Oktoberfest. It was clean and easy to drink, so I enjoyed it, but not as this style."
"Pours a reddish amber with a thick head of tan foam leaving some very trace amounts of lace as it quickly dissipates. The nose is bready with a caramely sweetness. The flavors are much the same,dry earthy leafiness,bread crust,with a slightly off taste. Subtly bitter and pretty malty for a Marzen,not too malty just on the high side of the spectrum. The mouthfeel is good and has some creaminess and a solid body."
"Appears a deep caramel amber near ruby red with a large off white tan head formed leaves behind thin even speckled lacing patterns down the sides of my liter mug. Aromatics offer up roasted malt and caramel tones with a touch of alcohol and mild herbal hop flow. A very bready texture of house lager yeast noted as well. Flavor is rich with cereal grains and caramel amber malt flavors, subtle nuttiness with a punctual noble hop bitterness adds to the incredible balance this version of the style has. Probably without a doubt one of my favorites of the season along with Great Lakes O fest. Texture is smooth with crisp even carbonation, definitely grab a whole sixer of this brew light to medium bodied it won't let you down. Drinkability like I said to enjoy this grab at least a half liter mug and enjoy it two at a time, so far I know Left Hand can pull off some good lagers, Pole Star and their collaboration Terrapin."
"Pours an ultra clear amber brown with a diminishing small white head. Aroma is medium sweet, nutty, light fruit and light floral. Flavor is much stronger than the aroma, nutty and sweet with adequate bitterness. Medium bodied, slick texture. Long carmelly sweet finish."
"I knew I should've picked up more than one sixer of this. Its delicious and everything I look for in an Oktoberfest brew."
"12oz. bottle served in a pilsner glass. Poured a reddish amber with a thin off white head. Pretty good aroma of caramel malt with some noble hops. Medium to light bodied. Malt sweetness, not terribly complex. Some noble hops in the finish. Smooth and easy drinking. I'm usually not a fan of American Oktoberfests, but this one is pretty good."
"I've gotta say that this is a quite refreshing beer, definitely high marks for drinkability."
"It is a drinkable beer. I think hop heads will enjoy it more."
"T - Spiced beer with hints of nutmeg. Overall a good balance between the hops and malts."
"D: Certainly a good session beer. I have mixed feelings on this one. It's a good beer overall, but the flavors don't fit the style in my mind."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a flavorful O-fest and is worth drinking a lot of over the course of an evening."
"D - very smooth and drinkable"
"One of the best Oktoberfest biers produced in the USA that I have had. I typically do not care for US Micro produced fest biers, but I rather enjoyed this one. It poured up a lovely orange bronze colour with a slight chill haze. Nose was quite sweet with a bit of maple syrup. Other toasted cereal smells were also present. Flavour was similar to its German couterparts, except there was an easily detectable hop bitterness toward the finish which I do not care for in this style. The hop bitterness is what I do not like about US festbiers in general, actually. It just happens to be less assertive in Left Hand's offering. Not bad. Glad I had the opportunity to try it."
"M/D - I really wasn't into this one. I have really started enjoying Oktoberfest beers lately, just not this one."
"Exceeded expectations. Good example of the style."
"This would be a great Oktoberfest except for the weird bitter/sour flavor."
"This beer is really good, nice and malty, and an awesome caramel malt finish, this is one of the better oktoberfests ive had. really good effort by lefthand. Would get again. definitely give this one a try if you see it. It pours a nice dark amber color like octoberfests should and if the rest of left hands beers are as good as this ill be satisfied."
"D-its allright, I'll move on"
"Overall a tasty and drinkable beer, though taste could be better integrated and mouthfeel somewhat smoother."
"This was very nice for the style from Left Hand with a lot of attributes that just work well for me. I last had this about 2 years ago, enjoyed it then, and still really enjoyed it now. Solid."
"Drinkability - Not too bad. Slightly too bitter to make it an all the time choice, but solid for a Marzen."
"A nice Oktoberfest with a decent amount of carbonation that I would pick up again."
"Not bad, but I think I may have had too many really good Oktoberfests recently to really like this one."
"D-I won't really miss this one, but i'll for sure try it next year"
"D: Not a beer I would really feel like pounding in a bar, but I can see how it would go with pretzels, mustard and bratz."
"A golden amber in color with a decent head and retention. Good carbonation. Smell is pretty grainy with an earthy, mild hop presence. Taste is much of the same. A delicate sweetness of caramel along with a touch of toasted bread. Still some grain flavor. Nice earthy hop presence providing a little bitterness. Good mouthfeel, fairly light in body with good carbonation and a light crisp finish. I could have a few of these, no problem. Good stuff overall in my book."
"A pretty tasty O-fest. Surprisingly grainy with generous hops for the style."
"drinkability - This was bery good, might be my favorite so far to date for this style. Worth a try on this one."
"An interesting take on the style but not something I'd recommend to our friends from Deutchland."
"Very good beer. Not the best beer I had that night, but I would still recommend it without hesitation."
"D: A nice combination of mouthfeel and taste. A nice example of this style; a nice Oktoberfest."
"D - Easy to drink, but not my typical style of beer. Good to enjoy and be in the spirit of the season, but not something I'd ask for year-round"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a reddish brown with a 2 finger bubbly head. Smell had tinges of vanilla and pepper. Taste was slightly milky sweet with a spicy aftertaste. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation was slightly strong, but the liquid coated well. Easy to drink, alcohol was extremely well hidden, went down smooth."
"There is a small nose, with a bit of caramel sweetness. The head on the beer is about 1 cm, good retention, good lacing, and a lot of carbonation. The beer is very caramely and has a nice sweetness. The lager bite comes through at the end to make the beer crisp. There isn't much toasty/biscuit flavours coming though. Very nice mouthfeel. The taste is a bit too one dimensional though. Pretty drinkable."
"Pours a orangish, copper body with a decent head and some lacings. A good smell of caramel malt and a hint of hops; sweet smelling. Low on spices and a mild sweet malt taste but real smooth and filling. Goes down easy and is a good Oktoberfest, but not the best."
"pours with an orange color and no rolling bubbles. leaving a 1/4 head that drifts away. it has a great smell of having trouble explaining other than sweet. followed by a very rich and smooth start followed by a bitter finish. Though it doesn't show any carbonation it has plenty in the feel. This is a very drinkable beer but there are many more much better."
"D: Pretty good, but one or two at a time is enough for me."
"This beer pours with a thick, creamy white head that dissipates to a thin, lasting layer. It has a typical light amber color for the style. Very light malty aroma with some alcohol present. The flavor is a bit bland and the finish is unspectacular. It's a decent beer but I probably won't be getting it again anytime soon."
"Very drinkable and an excellent example of the style, with a great balance that seems lacking in some other variants. The higher level of alcohol than usual does have a noticeable effect on an empty stomach, though, so beware."
"Drinkability: Easily one of my favorite beer seasons, I need to find my favorite Oktoberfest. This one is good, but I still think some of the actual German examples I have had are my leaders."
"Overall, it's just pretty bland and uninspiring and the off-flavors make it rather unpleasant."
"The beer pours a clear amber-copper color with a thin white head. The aroma is moderate-high malt, toasty and sweet and a bit oxidized (year old bottle). The flavor is highly malty, biscuity and toasty. There is also a moderate spicy hop flavor. The finish is just a bit dry and rather smooth. Moderate carbonation and medium body. Overall a solid Oktoberfest."
"Overall this is at the top of my list for Oktoberfests. It's comparable to Victory's Festbier in body and flavor, but with more of a toasted flavor. A must try for Marzen fans."
" I'm normally a hophead in what I prefer but in this case, I've been won over! Additionally, I have no idea what the ABV % is but in this case, I don't care. Even though it's still in the 60's outside, this is a great brew to welcome the upcoming cool weather with. Have it after dinner or with a slice of pumpkin pie and whip cream - once again, Left Hand has an offering worthy enough to be held in mine!"
"Overall a tasty and certainly easy to drink Octoberfest."
"Beer pours a dark amber color with a large 3 finger head that dissipates quickly. Lacing remains pronounced on topmost level. Smell is delicate/intricate, flowery/carmelly. Taste is very well balanced, a bit of roasted malt a hint of molasses. Mouthfeel is superb, very well rounded and robust again, aftertaste is quite strong but not offensive in any way. More of a reminder of a quality beer. Drinkability is high. This is one of the better handcrafted Oktoberfests I've tried this year."
"D: It continued to impress over the course of a bottle, though it did seem like it might get a touch intense for the style with a couple or more. A good beer, nonetheless, and one I'll be looking for again before the season is through."
"Overall, Left Hand Oktoberfest is a decent Oktoberfest, but probably not a beer that I would purchase again. It is worth a shot though."
"If I would just have read about Oktoberfest beers and never actually had drunk one, I think that this one would come very close to my expectations. It is very drinkable but still with a lot of character. Reminds a lot of a brown ale."
"D: Very drinkable; decent ABV, not too filling nor tiring. It would be nice to kick back a few of these."
"Taste is pretty similar too the smell, but there some strange very sweet note that disturbs slightly. I really like it though, and the palate is really good!"
"Drinkability is good also. It goes down very easy. You can easily have a few of these."
"taste is crisp, caramel, light amount of tin, some nuts, ends oily and thick with a little bitterness, as it warms becomes more watery."
"D. Very sessionable. This is a very good Oktoberfestbier. Rivals Sam Adams...."
"D: A nice example of the style but there are better out there. I find left hand to be totally hit or miss. This is something in the middle."
"Pours a very promising rich amber hue with good white head. Nose is slightly hoppy for the style, but the malt is there. Taste follows, a good malty flavor, but an akward profile, not quite the caramely flavor you get out of most german examples. Hops are more present than usual for the style, but still defenitely in the back seat. a strange malt profile here, still a good brew, but slightly strange for the style. Mouthfeel is good, but slightly thick. Drinkability is quality, but not amazing. Overall a good brew, and a good attempt, but still doesn't quite seem like the real deal. The malt profile is a bit off. Still an enjoyable beer, and great for the season."
"This beer I would say tastes like a watered-down Oktoberfest. Not very hearty, no malty sweetness typically found in these beers, rather an over tone of bitterness. This tastes like a fair ESB, and I would drink it for those qualities, but not my cup-o-seasonal brew."
"Drinkability: One only for me. I'm still hunting for a more sessionable Octoberfest."
"You should try it if given the chance."
"Mouthfeel is very rich and creamy and a solid medium body. Goes down incredibly smooth. The creaminess and sweetness from the malt leaves a good aftertaste as well. This is a great session beer. I don't know if I could drink them all night long, but certainly could have a few at a time."
"Aaaahhh, Oktoberfest season is upon us...almost. Anyway, this is my first of the '08 season. Pours a very clear, bright reddish amber with a decent 1/3 inch head that dissipates pretty quickly. Smells of grains, german malts, light signs of cherry, some hop spice. Flavor is more graininess, german malts, yeast, doughy, very light hop spice to even things out. Very balanced and extremely drinkable. Oktoberfests are THE session beers. Perfect carbonation, medium bodied, slightly dry finish. Great Oktoberfest offered up by Left Hand Brewery. I'm pumped for the '08 Marzen Season. Bring 'em on! Now all I need is the crisp autumn air and the leaves to turn to foliage."
"It's a decent stab at a wonderful style."
"Drinkability is moderate to high. Flavors are fine and beer is easily sessionable. I think it would just get annoying after a while though."
"D : It wasn't bad, wasn't great. For a Oktoberfest, it's not as close to the German ones as I would like."
"Recommended..."
"Notes: I had this after two pints of Rogue Black Brutal '07, so the first sip was a huge downshift from mouth-coating hop bitterness to sweet malt. Took me awhile to reboot my tastebuds and adjust to the sweetness. I still found it to be a tad bit too sweet for my tastes, however. . . ."
"An orange amber colored body comes off very deep in color darkness for the style. Head is a rocky fluff of light tan fuzz. Head has decent retention and a solid coating of lace is left behind. A hint of crusted fig and nicely carmalized malt is wraped up in a noticeable sweet candy like nose hints of chocolate milk and toffee arise also. On first sip you get the upfront sweet maltiness that really dominates this brew. It almost steps into the scotch ale catagory on some points. Reminds me a lot of a soft chewy toffee wraped around a cashew. Woodsy mineral tones are all over the last half of the palate. Mouthfeel is fuzzy and enjoyable. Could use a bit more of the authentic German styly but it is a good brew in its own right."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Not usually a fan of Oktober's, but tis the season (sorta). Poured a nice color, darkish amber. Smelled strong of malts, and taste was ""malty"" as well, but not overpowering. Last drop of bottle was same as first. Didn't get the spice or fruit smells others have with this beer. Though not a favorite, not terribly bad."
"Drinkability - not a bad beer overall, just not a great one. The diacetyl and metallic taste mar this."
"D: Rather drinkable, as the style often lends itself to, but also rather different. This interpretation is a little bolder than expected, which I came to admire. Went nicely with a serving of swiss cheese and water crackers."
"D-Enjoyable enough....Not a top tier ofest but an enjoyable drinker with some interesting dimensions you don't encounter in most beers within this style.."
"The flavor is as might be expected, with the toasty and somewhat sweet or ""juicy"" malts dominating, backed by grassy, leafy, and mildly spicy hops. It's well-balanced and nicely rounded, and it finishes dry with a long-lingering toasty and bready maltiness."
"D, notes: Octoberfests are supposed to be great session beers and I would say this one fits that bill. The malt flavor is a bit cloying."
"Very impressive. I'm always on the lookout for new Oktoberfests this time of year and Lefthand's O'fest, though familiar to the area, is the first I recall seeing it here this year. Very drinkable and an enjoyable example of the style. I need to seek more of this out before it's gone."
"Pours a clean amber color with an off white head. Aromas of a German lagering yeast, and sweet. In the taste, light dryness and hints of fruitiness. A smooth and light mouthfeel, with a clean, dry small maltiness in the aftertaste. Nice representation of style, easy to drink, very non-offensive."
"This one wasn't bad at all. I think this one goes at the top of my list as far as American Oktoberfests go. For my preference, it seemed to have all the correct characteristics, and it tasted pretty good too. Recommended."
"Very easy to drink and good, great session beer, and one of my new favorite Okotberfests."
"Thin, even white head on a classic orange brown body with normal clarity...nice roasted malts with a slight sweet, doughy aroma...medium to full palate, with a smooth texture and finish...sweet, even malts...a lingering finish, impressive in its singular effect...another winner from Left Hand, a beer equally made for sessioning or swigging....bring on the candy corn."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: A decent easy to drink oktoberfest. A touch on the tame side, inoffenseive. I feel this was made so that it would appeal to as many people as possible, which I guess is ok. I will not purposely seek this one out again."
"d - good effort by LH, i'll look for this one again."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Full bodied in the mouth with moderate levels of carbonation this brew leaves somewhat of an oily feeling that vanishes just as soon as the metallic tang vanishes. I'm also getting a slight aftertaste of diacetyl, not very pleasant, it doesn't work well with the rest of the brew, its there just on the back of the palate, in the air that sits upon my tongue, perhaps more of an oxidation than diacetyl, but its slightly warm, a bit buttery and not very pleasant. Not much more to it than that. This is an alright brew, but I can't see myself searching this one out."
"D - A very good Ofest beer..I picked up a six and will enjoy all of them"
"Poured into a pint glass, pours an hazy brownish orange with a fluffy head that does not hang around long but does leave a ring and also some lace on the glass. Smell is very breadywith malty backbone also that car smell that all left hand beers have in it. Taste is a malty smooth gem, I can taste a bit of roasted malt and also some roasted nuts in there, this goes down very smooth and was quite enjoyful, also a bit of carmel corn in the finish as well. Overall this was a pretty enjoyable beer from Left Hand and one of my favorites from them."
"As suspected, I've gotten more used to Oktoberfest's flavor now that I'm drinking the final few ounces. Either that or it improves as it approaches room temperature. Give it a whirl if you love the style, but there are others out there that are more deserving of my money."
"Nice amber/rusty orange color. Carbonation appears moderate. I'm not getting a lot of aroma, some sweet, toasty malt notes no hops to speak of. It's a good aroma, it's just not very strong, typical for the style. Taste is more of the same, nice tasty Munich malts with just enough spicy hops and carbonation to clean it all away with a nice crisp finish. A really well done O-fest that would be a good session beer."
"Pours a rich, clear, dark honey-brown with a thin but somewhat persistent head. Aroma is strong, malty and spicy - I got hints of cloves and cinnamon - with a touch of hops. Flavor is rich, mouth-filling, mainly malty, with spicy undertones. Smooth and very pleasing, this is an excellent autumn beer."
"A decent American Oktoberfest."
"While nothing spectacular, it's a decent O-fest. I'm still looking for a great example of the style, one that really wows me. While I wouldn't call this it, I wouldn't decline this. I won't be pining for it either."
"It's nice, but I don't think I would include this in my O-fest line-up, as it doesn't have the smoothness that I look for in the style."
"The drinkability is very good I will look for this again to be sure. Prosit und Zum Wohl. MK"
"(BTW, 2 Ofests that ARE like Beef Stew are New Glarus Staghorn and Summit Ofest. These are my measuring sticks when it comes to Ofests.)"
"Alright."
"Overall, very refreshing. Just a wee high in alcohol to be sessionable, but very drinkable nevertheless. Easy to have two, three or four in an afternoon-evening, while watching the game and enjoying some chili or brats."
"A very nice going easy drinkin' O-fest that suits the style well for what an American brewery can pull off; which Left Hand does well with this nice brew."
"A good example of a malty marzen beer, but not my favorite for Oktoberfest."
"I really like this beer enough to miss colorado based solely on that basis... although there are additional reasons"
"Very enjoyable beer, would definitely buy this again."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, with a pretyy decent drinkablity."
"Excellent beer!"
"Overall, the worst O-fest I've had so far this year. Does not come close to the German versions. Doesn't even resemble other American versions."
"Medium to light bodied, faint finish, a little sweetness at the end, some caramel, toffee flavors. But not too memorable. Fairly average offering for the style."
"Recommended"
"This Oktoberfest unfortunately doesn't do too much for me. It's somewhat bland and bready, with pockets of caramel malts and nuts. It's not bad tasting by any means, but doesn't have enough character to run with the better beers in this genre. Mouthfeel is medium and slightly fizzy. I'd recommend this one if nothing better is available. Not awful, but not great."
"Drinkability: Sessionable but somewhat bland."
"1011"
"Aside from an off aroma (smells dusty or like a bottle even poured in a glass), this was a pretty decent beer. The flavor was a little low until it warmed up and gave a really nice mellow caramel malt flavor. There's nothing complex going on, but it's tasty and quite drinkable. Maybe not a standout for the style, but a decent take on it."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle marked ""Bottled on 8.22.07"" into a pint glass. Appearance is a clear rust-hued amber, with a thin cap of fizzy head that is an off-white tan color that fell away to light sticky lacing. Aroma is comprised of sweet caramel and toffee, heavy roasted malt notes, light spiciness/hoppiness also mixed in. Taste is roasty malt, caramel, toffee, yeast/bread notes, sweet finish with a dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel is slick and smooth, medium bodied, low carbonation, goes down nice and easy. Drinkability is great, well balanced O'fest, nice malt complexity and heartier substance expected of the style, would purchase again."
"Record breaking 90 degree heat here, just outside of Buffalo. Still, the Oktoberfest has commenced! This one pours a cloudy honey color,with a thin white head. Not much retention,but a decent lacing. Aroma is of sweet bready malts,and a hint of earthy hops. Body is medium,with some carbionation. Taste is of bread and butter with a nice touch of hops in the finish. Very good!"
"Pours a slightly hazy amber with a nice off-white head that leaves very good lacing. Aroma is toasted bread, caramel, toffee, and a faint hop pressence in the background. Taste is toasted, bready malt and some sweet caramel. Some herbally hops are present in the back. Mouthfeel is medium with a nice carbonation level. Very drinkable version. A nice o'fest from a Left Hand."
"The body is medium. Crisp carbonation with a clean, dry finish. Very easy to drink. I love Oktoberfest season. This is a good one as well. Much better than pretty much all of the other Left Hand stuff I've tried."
"Nothing wrong with this beer; serviceable. But nothing special either. Copper colored amber, like its commercial description. Light hop. A bit more sweet and less roasty/dry than I prefer, but not bad. Carbonation is ok. Finish is ok. Body is ok. Ok? ok"
"Pours a clear copper color with an average white head, no real lacing left on the glass. The smell is of caramel and toasted malt, nothing very distinct. The taste is of caramel malt, toffee, light bitter hop to balance out the flavors. The feel is fairly light and well carbonated. The flavors blend into a nice smooth feel. A respectable Oktoberfest, very enjoyable, refreshing and quite easy to drink. Definitely worth a go."
"D - This is a very drinkable beer. During this 5 minute review it is almost gone."
"Drinks pretty easy, not as good as last years, so far that's the trend, so maybe it's me? Still liked this considerably more than Sam Adams, no contest"
"d: Pretty easy...surprised by this one, as I'm pretty picky about my oktoberfests. Not stellar, but certainly ""good"". A 3.5 only because the unchecked weight of the malt hinders a bit."
"Final Note: it seems to me that in the rush to put out an Augtoberfest beer, some breweries miss the target with their Marzen. This one was way off the mark"
"Man are the Oktoberfest's comming out early this year. Good to see this new arrival popping up this week. Aromas give a medium malty, bready, caramelly rich nose; with hints of barley flavors and grains mixed in. The appearance is a brightly hued color of copper, golden, and amber--quite nice. Very clear with a continuous layer of foam, but little lacing. Flavors give a medium character of deep, rich barley malts with light caramel, bread, and hints of nuttiness. However flavors of grains soon make their way in, above the moderate bready flavors. The feel is a little light / thin, not allowing the rich maltiness to last deep into the aftertaste. Instead, a mild grain husk flavor gains intensity and follows deep into the lingering. Good beer, I just demand more from a good Oktoberfest."
"Pours a clear medium amber body with small cascading bubbles throughout leaving a thick creamy tan head. The aroma is caramel, nuts, plums, chocolate essence. Very malty and complex, this taste is wonderfully sweet upfront of caramel, pitted fruit, with a nice hoppy bitterness for balance that ends sweet coating the palate with a caramel sweetness. Great Oktoberfest Left Hand."
"D - Easy to sip or gulp."
"Originally reviewed on December 23, 2005. 12 Oz Bottle. Pours clear amber orange, wita whitish head. Aroma of lime rinds and dusty malt. Sweet dusty malt and sour corn flavor, with a hint of old fruity tones. Not much depth. Palate a little dry, but mostly clean sweet. Meh."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, lager malty, with a light cinnamon spice along the palate."
"The flavor is sweet and malty up front. Notes of caramelized malt sugars are prominent and almost evoke a soft berry like fruitiness. This finishes with a nice balancing bitterness, which tends to morph into a light herbal character. This could definitely use more bready malt character though. It is quite drinkable as is though (and I will be happy to drink this again), but it is just not a stellar Oktoberfest."
"Thanks, Oxymoron, for the opportunity"
"12 ounce bottle."
"Drinkability: pretty good marzen here. Definitely worth a try. Had this after a Victory Fest, so it is a bit milder in flavor than that one."
"pours a one to two finger head with some lacing to the finish. smell is of cooked cabbage or cooked glazed carrots. taste has some hop to it, more malt, sweet at the end with a little chocolate there. nice beer easy beer to drink. i would like to try some other beers from this brewer."
"This one is not bad in any area, just bland and doesn't do much for me. It's a typical O'Fest. It won't offend but it won't wow you."
"The clear, amber colored body topped by a one finger thick head gave this pour into the mug a classic look. Smell was also authentic, which is to say quite malty with a touch of spice. Taste was a little too sweet and underattenuated to be a good fest bier. Oddly earthy hop bitterness kept lingering on, and felt out of place for the style. Was this only 6% ABV, as it became too much of a tedium to drink rapidly. Is this a bold interpretation of the style, or is it good intentions gone wrong? Hard to say for sure."
"Very nice American take on this style. Brilliantly clear, cheery copper in color with a good head and spare lacing. Rich taste, deeper, sweeter, and smokier than the average Oktoberfest, and almost chewy. Aroma is not particularly strong, but my nose never catches much from Oktoberfests, anyway. Well done. Well worth trying out."
"This one's all about malty goodness. The aroma is unremarkable, but the flavor capably makes up for that. And it's the flavor that makes this enjoyably drinkable. So as I have another, I am now convinced that this is my favorite Left Hand beer."
"EDIT: For anyone who checks older reviews, the 2008 version is even more authentic than before. The hops come out in the middle like in the Hacker-Pschorr and Paulaner versions. Sweetness is still there, but it's been mellowed a tiny bit. Yum! Probably the best O-fest available in the US."
"Very drinkable overall, this is certainly one of Left Hand's more worthwhile offerings. A strong new brew like this is great for the Colorado beer scene, and it's good to see it come from Left Hand. If they start putting out seasonals of this quality, I might become a part time convert."
"D - tasty interpretation of a classic style. I could drink a few of these any time of year."
"Overall- A nice Marzen, nothing outstanding here but a beer I quickly drank down. I could drink a few of these."
"This is a nice beer. I'm glad they have offered this style for the season."
"Overall impression: Nice Oktoberfest - glad to see they revived this. According to the website this is a new recipe and name from the old Tabernash. I never tried that one to compare, but this is a solid beer that I will be enjoying through the fall months."
