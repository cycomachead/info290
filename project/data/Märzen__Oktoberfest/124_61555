3.93,2.9,4.25,3.75,3.75,4.25,4.25,"500ml bottle. 07/15. Pours a bright, pale straw colour with a frothy, slightly off white head which refused to disappear and excellent lacing. Very gentle aroma of malt and only a hint of hops. Light sweetness and light bitterness. Very clean. Medium body, smooth texture and just a touch of bitterness in the finish. Not very complex but subtle, well made and a perilously drinkable brew at 6% abv. I wish I had another one of these, as it's not a beer to be pondered and dissected, it's a beer to be simply enjoyed.","magpieken","Dec 14, 2014"

3.99,4.5,3.75,4,4,4,4,"i had no idea these guys did a wheated octoberfest. so glad they do, its amazingly tasty, and a wonderful contrast to all the marzel lagers going right now. this one is pale straw colored with a lovely inch and a half of white head that tries but cant hang on. way more clear than other german wheat beers. the nose is sweet from the wheat, uncovered by the yeast like i expected it to be, quite delicate for its 6% abv, and rather robustly grain forward. there is an apple nose too, and it comes through in the taste, especially in the finish. almost like cider meets wheat beer. the yeast is interesting, with some fruitiness but super dry at the end. the wheat adds a lot to this traditional style, really ramping it up to something that feels both distinct and historic. the germans still do some clever stuff, and they probably deserve a little more credit among american beer geeks for beers like this one. its really tasty, richer in feel but still dry and airy from the carbonation. it just feels like fall. far better than the regular paulaner oktoberfest, although i like that one too.","StonedTrippin","Oct 25, 2014"

Aromas of bread, toast, cracker, honey, pear, apple, light caramel, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance of malt, yeast ester, and hop notes; with good strength. Taste of bread, toast, cracker, pear, apple, honey, light caramel, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of bread, toast, cracker, pear, apple, honey, light caramel, light pepper, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a bit. Damn nice balance and robustness of malt and yeast ester flavors; with no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and slightly creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Oktoberfest style. All around great balance and robustness of malt and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 19, 2013"

Light straw color looks and behaves like budwieser in the glass only with better lacing. Compare it to hoffbrau ofest if you can't find this one. Worth a try and I will buy it again. This one will be in the late sept through November beer rotation at the uniobrew household as long as I can find it! And the 6% abv is well hidden with a mild sessionable flavor...hence the sneaky tag being hung on this one.","Uniobrew31","0"

Having said that, this does not resemble a Marzen/Oktoberfest as the style suggests, as the color is wrong and this beer does not highlight the strong malt body and flavor that Oktoberfest is known for. Much more like a strong Helles. Whatever it is, I love it, but around $6-7 a can, my consumption will be limited. My rating of this beer is based more as a Helles rather than an Oktoberfest. Although the style characteristics are off, this is still a fantastic beer.","beeragent","Aug 25, 2013"

Not really a medicinal or aluminum type smell, although the hops take on a distinct earthy and grassy note. Hops are the smell for this beer, although some light citric notes in the hops as well as touches of bready sweet malt make an appearance. Like an good German bier, this brew is light-bodied and easy to drink with the dominant taste being the sharp hoppy bite. The hops are like they smell, earthy and dry, and are balanced not so much from any citric hops (there are some) but also from a moderate usage of bread/barley malts and a touch of sweetness shines through here and there. This easy to drinkness, as it were, makes this not only a good beer to quench your thirst but also easy to keep drinking (which might be the point since it's an Oktoberfest bier).

The beer pours with a tall, bright white, foamy, sudsy head that starts at a whopping three inches in this huge glass, and then slowly settles into a dense, clingy head. The beer is a slighty hazed, yellow-gold coloring that is vibrant, and almost honey colored in the depths. The beer's aromas are extremely effervescent, with a blend of toasted grains, a touch of honey, and a background presence of hops (noble?). The beer has a very light and smooth blend of flavors, with a slight tangy malt sweetness, a toasty quality, and the crisp and clean characters of hops sprinkled around the end of the palate. The aftertaste has a honey sweetness and tang, but only for a short amount of time, as the hops presence cleans your tastebuds for a clean crisp finish. I was impressed how clean and quick the finish was with such a creamy, rich, and round body. Good brew.","GarthDanielson","Sep 30, 2011"

The first pour looks great, with a big frothy white head atop a clear, sparkling golden brew. Aroma is a little sweet, without being artificial. Taste is nice; mostly malt and bread, with a little bit of hoppy bitterness. Mouthfeel was a little light and sweet, probably good for the style bot not my favorite. Overall the big liter glass was good at reminding me I need to work out to drink from it, but otherwise it was very enjoyable.","medic25","Sep 27, 2011"

The taste is of the sweet doughy munich malt, light grains, honey, touch of tin and some grassy and peppery hop. Pretty much a stronger munich helles and typical festbier. The body is moderate with semi-soft carbonation; sweet overall finishes with a slight peppery hop balance. Comes in a big can. Was glad to try this beer.","rockyfire","Sep 22, 2011"

This stuff pours a mostly clear russet-golden-amber topped by a finger of light off-tan foam. The nose comprises light orange zest, lightly toasted wheat bread, light caramel, grass, and a touch of cashew. The taste drops the cashew, opting instead for a nice blend of mandarin orange and caramel-dripped wheat bread, with some grass tossed in the back for good measure. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation, and a smooth, kinda creamy feel.

It is more sweet than bitter, there is imbalance in the force. Very grainy and grassy. I could swear this is Paulaner Helles Lager packed as Oktoberfest. Hop notes are astringent but minimal.

Novelty packaging but kind of cool, a liter can of Paulaner Wiesn Bier packed inside of a one liter Paulaner krug. Pours a bright straw deep golden hue crystal clear, egg shell white head forms thick and leaves beautiful scattered lacing. It was worth the 12 bucks I used to have the same krug in college and back then I paid 9 bucks for it. So for 3 dollars extra the beer and glass didn't seem like a bad deal. Aroma has a beautiful honey drizzled malt layer with herbal/spicy noble hops. Flavor is great clean sweet all malt presence huge biscuit/cracker with a touch of honey sweetness. Herbal/spicy German noble hop character balances it out perfectly. I can't think of any other beer I would like to festively drink by the liter, this is a nice version of it with a bit of fruit in the back end a touch of tart green apple actually fits the season. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied healthy but smooth carbonation flowing, it really goes down easy. The most drinkable form of a lager built for fest tents in Munich.

4.13,8.1,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"I got a 1000ml can of this inside an Oktoberfest glass, and at first I was worried that it would be hard to down it all, but as I get further into it, it becomes more and more of a pleasure to.","BBP","Sep 25, 2010"
3.83,0.3,3,2.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Drinkability ranks high. This sits light and tastes good. There is nothing about this beer that would make me hesitate from grabbing another, except that it is almost 34 ounces!","Kooz","Sep 24, 2010"
3.78,-1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"D - This is perhaps the beer's highest point. You will have no problem downing this on the final hot summer day's. With the perfect balance of sweet and bitter and the perfect carbonation, this beer's drinkability is almost as good as it gets.","Transatlantic","Sep 24, 2010"
3.56,-6.8,4,3,3.5,4,4,"Overall, I wouldn't mind drinking this all day for a few days in Munich. Since I'm not there, this one can will have to do for now. Nothing too special, and the Oktoberfest from Paulaner is better. I'm happy with the glass though.","OlRasputin989","Sep 24, 2010"
4.45,16.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Drinkability is spectacular. Beautifully flavorful, great balance, excellent mouthfeel. Nice to get a German beer like this where you actually know how long it's been on the shelf - beautifully fresh. Love it, beautiful beer.","JohnQVegas","Sep 22, 2010"
3.63,-5,3.5,3,4,4,3.5,"Pours (from a massive can) a clear dark gold with a big, frumpy, white head. Aromas are predominantly grainy and honeyish, disappointingly simple. Luckily the flavors are more interesting, with lightly toasty and woody notes adding to the mix. Finishes toasty. All around it's just okay; I expected more from Paulaner.","droomyster","Sep 20, 2010"
3.66,-4.2,4,3,3.5,4,4.5,"Poured with a nice big head that took a few minutes to dissipate. After that now head or lacing. Goes down real smooth. Very drinkable. Wish I was in Germany, but this is a nice reminder of what I had when I was there.","Hex92","Sep 20, 2010"

4.63,21.2,4.5,4,5,4,5,"I haven't found this anywhere other than in these limited edition cans. Kind of limits the "drinking a lot" idea. I guess I need to go to Germany.","Kbogac","Sep 19, 2010"

3.92,2.6,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"High carbonation leads to an effervesent and bubbly feel early and leans away from creaminess. The carbonation ushers in the minerally crisp-clean feel late. For a 6%er, this one scrubs the palate a bit too much.","BEERchitect","Sep 18, 2010"
3.88,1.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,5,"The mouthfeel has a light touch of carbonation. It verges on creamy without that filling feeling. This is the kind of beer you can use to wash down a big meal, or drink in mass quantities. Perfect for 'Festing.","bort11","Sep 17, 2010"
3.68,-3.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a rich golden honey color with a soapy pure white head that settles into a sparce cap, some chunky lacing on the dipple mug. The aroma is of a doughy munich malt, some honey, grassy and peppery hops. The taste is of the sweet doughy munich malt, light grains, honey, touch of tin and some grassy and peppery hop. Pretty much a stronger munich helles and typical festbier. The body is moderate with semi-soft carbonation; sweet overall finishes with a slight peppery hop balance. A good "tent or fest" style Oktoberfest. I prefer their marzen oktoberfest but this does remind me of your typical 1 liter tent brau. Definite try as it seems to be limited to this year only.","Gmann","Sep 12, 2010"
4,4.7,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer pours a crystal clear golden straw with a big frothy white head that leaves barley any lacing down the sides of the mug as it recedes. The aroma is grassy hops up front, with a slight toast and just a bit of fresh bread. Very simple and straight forward. Nothing but simple clean aromas. Thats my favorite thing about good lagers. There is no way to hide things, its either there or its not. The flavor is exactly the same with slightly grassy hops and some yeasty biscuits. A slight bit of caramel mixed with toasty bread. Really simple, really straight forward. Great stuff. The mouthfeel is light and slightly creamy, with just a hint of dryness that makes your mouth linger for another sip. Man, this brings me back to Munich. I would rather be sipping on a liter of this in a biergarten then in my living room. i have a feeling ill be giving away a lot of Paulaner 1 liter krugs.","hwwty4","Sep 12, 2010"
4.18,9.4,4.5,4,4,3.5,5,"D: as with all marzen its ment to be consumned in large quantities and this is one to fit in with the others","rootbeerman","Sep 11, 2010"
3.93,2.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"D: Considering I had a 1 quart size serving of this, I would say 1 per sitting. If you find these in 12oz bottle form, it's easy to drink several.","tlazaroff","Sep 05, 2010"
3.77,-1.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Poured from the big ass can into the Paulaner mug. Beer produced on 06/16/10 with a best by date of 03/16/11. What am I going to do with this 1L mug after this beer? Pale yellow color with a small head that did not last very long. Not much for lacing either. I blame the mug more than anything for the lack of head and lacing. But the pale color is not what I would describe a good Oktoberfest as having. Has a hoppy and sweet aroma. Smells floral with notes of honey and grain. Too sweet for my tastes but otherwise a solid lager. Very floral and grassy in nature. The malt tastes very sweet. I would of preferred a more toasted nature. Feels a little heavier than it probably is because of the lingering sweetness weighs on the palate. Perfectly carbonated as to be expected. An arm workout hoisting the heavly mug and 1L of beer. No problem downing the entire contents of the can. Probably will be a little drunky after finishing this.","morimech","Sep 03, 2010"
3.41,-10.7,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability is moderate to high. The ABV is easily managed, and the flavor profile is ok. It's a bit boring, and will certainly be a chore to finish the whole liter.","Goliath","Sep 02, 2010"
3.88,1.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability: An easy-drinking and thoroughly enjoyable Oktoberfest beer. This beer looks absolutely stately in its intended mug and I can only imagine the pleasure that would come from quaffing down a few of these on the Wiesn!","wahhmaster","Beers"
3.88,1.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"D - Great balance and very easy to take down...I guess that's why the mug is so big. Now I just have to travel to Germany to compare to what they serve in the tent...","ZeroSignal","0"
2.65,-30.6,3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"on the can it says "Oktoberfest Bier" (ABV 6.0%), so I am not sure whether the brew I was tasting is actually the same as this one .... this does not really taste like a Märzen, rather like a pint Starkbier 'reduced' with say half a pint 'ordinary' lager ... lacks smoothness and pleasing flavors (what I taste is mostly bitter-sweet and sticky) ... not a brew to remember ....","Daredevil","0"
