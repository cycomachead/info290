It has a light sweetness along with a dry bready character. It goes down easy with a dry, malty finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation.

A tad sour and very deserving of the October sensibilities. The flavor is in keeping with the aroma. A bold tart allspice apple with tons of caramel malt. I even get an odd licorice edge. Very woodsy, swampy malt. I think it's neat, something that truly fits the season. It's medium plus bodied with pleasant carbonation. A substantial somewhat cidery feel.

The taste is not overpowered by anything, but has a nice malty spine with tangy bitterness and some fruit and pepper (and peas). The carbonation is lively and the alcohol, while present, feels lower than its stated ABV.

One can smell a menagerie of malt, fruit, fall spices and grains. It does make it intriguing to drink but it is also sometimes off-beat due to its complicated aromas. The taste also follows suit with the smell, however a really bitter aftertaste follows with sips that hinder a complete enjoyment of the fascinating flavors in this drink.

Hops tries to surface in the finish on the back sides of my tongue, but the malt doesn't let it come through. Surprisingly, the beer is not cloying at all.

Slightly toasty, caramel, and nutty flavors shine through the sweet malt that was balanced perfectly with the hops. But the hot alcohol is out of place for this style - more in line with a bock or dopplebock if you ask me. Its more than warming, and is distracting from the all the great malt flavors - even makes it unbalanced . I try this every year and have the same complaint every year. Taking the gravity down a notch from a bock level would make this so much more drinkable I think.","Longstaff","Sep 17, 2007"

Pours a dark orange, with a creamy looking white heading that soon turned to clean looking lace. Smell is of sweet grainy malt, honey and sugar, i almost detect an almost honeydew smell in there too.Taste was really malty, with little in the hops, and an overall huge sweetness. The caramel and grains really accompany one another well with this one. The alcohol is also pretty well accentuated with this beer, it really warms you up. Mouthfeel was medium to heavy...probably from the big malt presence. Tough call on drinkability...I couldn't drink these all night, certainly a few if I drank slowly. Im more of a hophead then anything, so the huge maltyness really stood out for me...still not a bad thing though. If anything, it is beers like this that make me appreciate lagers more.

Hints of fruit or some sweetness develop in the mouth after a few tastes. This is a very drinkable and enjoyable beer. I am glad to see the fall style beers coming around again. I have been anticipating the return of this one especially. Wonder what this beer would be like aged a bit longer? I may have to put a couple 22's away in the fridge until winter.
