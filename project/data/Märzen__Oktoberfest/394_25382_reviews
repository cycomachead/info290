"Light, easy to drink octoberfest. Low on flavor."

"o: OK for a  dinner beer but a bit too lightweight for a good  Octoberfest,  Not nearly malty enough for me in this style."

"As far as this style is concerned, this beer has a good flavor with a slight bitterness making it a good Oktoberfest choice for those who tend to prefer IPAs. I give it a 4.5 from within the Märzen / Oktoberfest style and probably a 4.0 overall."

"Malty flavor with a slight bitter after taste."

"Autumn orange in color and very hazy. Poured with a short, rich foam that quickly reduced to a wispy cap. Sweet, bready malt aroma with a hint of floral hops beneath. Smooth, delicate feel with a tangy bite that accompanies the carbonation through the middle. Caramel and toasted malt flavors with delicate, earthy, floral hops benath. A bit of tangy, spicy bop bite near the end ushers in a clean finish with a light bready, toasted malt aftertaste."

"Overall: A pretty good oktoberfest style here from Stoudt's. Wouldn't go out of my way to drink it but this isn't bad."

"Pours a clear orange amber with a medium off white head. Aroma and Taste is of sweet lightly toasted barley. malt, yeast, light fruity notes with a bit of grassy notes.. Palate is a medium body with mild carbonation. Finish is sweet malt, yeast lightly toasted barley and grassy notes with some mild bitterness. Flavor and aroma are a bit weak. Overall an ok brew."

"O- This brew is much better on tap than out of the bottle. I love getting growler fills, but rarely buy a case of bottles."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 2/8/2013. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of caramel, pear, apple, bread, toast, toffee, floral, light citrus, and herbal hops. Very nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity. Taste of caramel, toast, bread, pear, apple, toffee, floral, light pepper, and herbal hops. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, toast, toffee, bread, floral, and herbal hops on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of malty flavors that are fairly robust; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and moderately creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Oktoberfest. Nice balance of fairly robust malty flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering; and nice example of the style as well."

"I poured this into a pint glass, it has a orange color body with no head or lacing. The smell is of malts and that is all i detect. The taste has that nice malt flavor upfront followed by a little bit of sweetness. No hops are present. The mouth feel is good and overall a good marzen, not the best i have had but defently not the worst."
"O: A decent Oktoberfest. A bit more robust that some I've tried. Sessionable."
""
"Pours light copper with good 1/4 inch white foam that holds. Laces. Lighter malty nose. Good malty base, very light. Sweetness, thinner mouthfeel - designed to be an easy drinbker. Quite sessionable. Touch cloying. Not a hop in sight. Good, not great. Though I had right after the Hooker Octoberfest, and this was clearly inferior to that one."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a good standard Oktoberfest beer. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but I will drink it."
"O: A solid oktoberfest, but there are better options out there."
"The body is medium with a biting carbonation which leads to a pretty nice smoothness underneath that's dominated by a crispness that bites too harshly. It has the makings of something that could be good but is too heavily carbonated."
"Overall this is a pleasant beer to drink if you like a sweet beer. This is an easy drinking beer which would be good for a cool Autumn night. A few more hops to balance out the sweetness would be nice but I can not complain."

"Overall –Overall a very easy drinking brew with a nice flavor blend. Give it a go if you have a chance."

"Overall: this one is strong on the rye bread end. The flavor is very full and different but not really what I look for from the style."
"O - Overall its a nice marzen, mostly easy drinking like it should be. Much better ones out there, though."
"I'm always glad to get the chance to try a new Oktoberfest and Stoudts fits the bill though perhaps not quite true to style. I'll have to drink a few more before I decide where is ranks with other."
""
"O-not as smooth an easy to drink as I like my Oktoberfest beers to be. It is okay though, just off for the style."
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a very good Oktoberfest, compared to most.."
""
"Thanks to tone77 for this beer."
""
""
""
"O: This is one Oktoberfest that I look forward to every year. Simple, tasty, and highly quaffable. A great example of the style; everything you're looking for is here."
""
""
"O: A typical bastardization of a wonderful style by Stoudt's."
"O. Definitely one of the best Oktoberfests I've ever had."
""
""
""
"I wouldn't choose this beer over others that I would consider to be in the same class. It's got a great smell and above average taste, but the taste really isn't special for a craft beer, and the look and feel just aren't quite there for me. It's *almost* there, but its lack of unique character just doesn't help this beer make the cut."
""
""
"Marzens generally go by the book and this isn't too much different than most. Not too sweet, but pleasantly so...a little biscuit differentiates it from some others."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a really good oktoberfest – a little light on the flavor but very drinkable none the less."
""
""
""
""
"O: This isn't a bad Marzen, but it's not an overly good one. This is an average beer which I find rather surprising because I have praised some of Stoudt's other lagers. Obviously this is better than the Mickey's and Yuengling which slightly higher or similar marks from me, but based as an Oktoberfest it is lacking. This would be a good beer for a hot sausage sandwich on a nice fall day."
"Overall: There is nothing wrong with this beer, but it's very average. I don't think I would have another."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, some spices. Taste is rather mild, malts, a touch of spice, a slight bitterness at the finish. Feels light in the mouth and overall is a decent beer, but I have had better Oktoberfest's."
""
"Not one of the better Oktoberfest out there. I usually like stuff from Stoudts, but this one needs to go back to the drawing board."
""
""
"D-Not a bad beer, but I really would like a stronger malt presence on this one."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, average carbonation, and leaves a good film on the inside of your mouth. Very drinkable. Overall, a good beer. A better than average Oktoberfest that is very refreshing and goes down smooth. Not worth seeking out, but glad I picked this up."
"This beer pours a clear, bold gold with thin head an no lace. The aroma is caramel, nuts, and a hint of roasted malt. The flavor has notes of caramel, orange, and spice, mainly ginger. a tiny bit of root beer shows up in the finish. It's mouthfeel is medium-light. Stoudt's Oktober Fest is a good beer, dry and refreshing. A good example of the style. Recommended."
"O: A nice beer for when you just want something simple that you don't have to over-analyze what you're drinking."
"Medium bodied with a prominent autumnal spice character up front that lingers over the sweeter notes into a dry finish.  Slight crisp hop presence compliments the spices but doesn't overpower.  Not bitter.  Sweet malt backbone is kind of watered down with caramel toffee and nut.  Mediocre.  "
"Overall, not true to style and lacks any striking traits. But, it is clean and easy to drink."
"O - One of the better American examples of the style I've had, this was a very nice surprise!"
"Poured into a pint glass, it has a nice 1/2 head that dissipates to a lace that follows down the beer. Really nice rich amber color. A malty smell with a very faint hint of fruitiness. Not as crisp as I prefer, but very drinkable. Overall, another nice beverage from Stoudts- I haven't been disappointed yet!"
"O - This is a respectable presentation of the fall classic, but definitely not a must have. I was expecting more out of this."
"Overall it was a very decent Oktoberfest and very drinkable. Nice going Stoudts."
"O: The smell and flavor were a bit mild with this one. Overall not bad, but not great either."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Super drinkable beer from a brewery that I have a bit of a soft spot for. Not quite as good as Great Lakes. It starts out that way, but it just doesn't finish like GLO does."
"O - Pretty decent Oktoberfest."
"Very interesting retro looking label on this one. Poured into my Geordie Schooner. Nice thick head on a dark copper base. Head lasted quite awhile. Aroma was malt-a-mania. Tons of malty sweetness both in the nose and in the mouth. Not much in the hops department. Just a regular basic malty Octoberfest. Would like to try on tap. My first from Stoudt's."
"amberhue, foamy head with gobs of retention. bubbling carbonation. Nose is clean if not malty, taste is sweet, bready and finishes with light grass and flower. More balanced than many Marzens I've had. drinkable. A much fuller body than many marzens I've tried this year. Nice!!"
"Terrible rendition of an oktoberfest."
"O: This is a decent beer, but doesn't offer enough for me to seek it out again."
"This beer is very light and sessionable. Not a bad Oktoberfest, but not very complex either."
"A very nicely malted nose leads the mouth into a beautiful harmony of flavor and drinkability. I had to stop myself from finishing a whole sixer in an hour's time. It just goes down so nicely, but not in that way where you don't notice. Every sip makes me happy."
"I'd like to try this on tap."
"Over a descent interpretation of the Marzen, I could easily drink many, but as far as innovation and character go, I would say just a touch on the bland and unexciting side."
"O - Not that great of a beer. It just doesn't have much in the way of aroma or flavor. I thought maybe it was last years beer, but the best by date is 01/20/12. I definately won't be buying this game again."
"A bit early for the Oktoberfests, but I could definitely drink lots of this in a few weeks. A very enjoyable brew."
"O: My first bottle from this batch I was a little disappointed, but the more I have this beer, the more I enjoy it. Although it's not extravagant in any way, it's a damn good session beer. In my opinion, this is what the standard of commercial beer should be."
"Overall, I'm not all that impressed. This was OK. I hate to judge a Stoudts offering on only a single bottle. I'll buy one fresh and revisit."
"Having had this before, this is the first time I am giving it an honest review and truthfully, I don't remember it being this enjoyable. It's very true to the style, which Stoudt's seems to do quite well. I really look forward to this beer in the fall but it's still wonderful now."
"Pours a translucent dark golden brown with maybe 1/2 finger of head. Nice carbonation rising throughout. Smell is faint, slightly sweet smelling malts, but nothing more distinct than that. Tastes like a lager, but not in the Marzen style. Crisp and pretty clean, but taste doesn't really stand out in any way. Mouthfeel is light with a high carbonation level, too much for my liking. Overall, this is okay but not at all memorable."
"This Oktoberfest isn't too bad the pour is nice. The head rises but didn't overflow, the color is a deep amber color. The head is cream colored. The aroma is slightly spicy with some good malts on the nose too. The flavor is pretty standard for most Marzen style, it's earthy with a little spice with some sweeter malts in the back. The mouthfeel is a little light on this brew. If it was a bit heavier it would have probably been better."
"Tasty Oktoberfest with nothing spectacular but tasty all-around."
"From Fall brew ranking notes: Pours a nice dark amber but almost no head. A bit of lacing, but nothing to write home about. The nose was a pleasant maltiness carried by the lively carbonation. Hint of nutmeg and cinnamon. Mouthfeel was also pleasant, heavy but carried by the nice carbonation. Good mix, didn't weight you down and the carbonation didn't pull the beer from your tongue. Taste was dominated by the toasty caramel malts. There was a touch of orange peel, and a hint of bitterness to round the taste out, but nothing getting in the way of the reserved and simply drinkable taste. Pretty above average in every way. Not the top of the line for this style, but a really solid attempt."
"Overall: A pretty hoppy version of the style. I would like to see more of a malt backbone to back it up. Lacking the smoothness of a good lager. Still, I wouldn't turn it down if offered."
"I thought I could count on Stoudts to come up with a solid authentic Marzen, but instead this tastes decidedly like a maibock. It even looks like a maibock, in color - a light yellowy-amber with a faint haze. Looks pretty flat, as far as carbonation. There's some maltiness to the aroma, but there's also some uncharacteristic hoppiness and spiciness as well. As far as the nature of the spiciness, it's a toss-up between whether or not it's derived from the yeast (which could be lending the fruity notes, too) or from the specialty grain. The malt in the flavor, once again, having a rye bent to it, and body is of moderate concentration. The apparent deficit of CO2, in the form of visual foam and bubbles, as previously noted, can be detected as well in the smooth, yet surprisingly watery feel. Ya, boring. What's up, Stoudts?"
"DB- A pleasant, easy drinking flavor. Fairly standard for yhe style but enjoyable without any major flaws."
"drinkability: for the Märzen style, it is sudued and not overly prounounced, but in general the very light hop notes complement the mellow taste."
"D - Good session brew. Clean and drinkable, but doesn't stand out."
"Good moderately full body. Given the low ABV, I'm surprised at how ""heavy"" this feels. This is really a secretly-full beer. Great beer that's full of flavor. Lots of tasty breadiness finished with a kiss of sweetness. Nice grainy aftertaste. This really is one of my favorite of the season. Great flavor, excellent drinkability. Just tweak the nose a bit, and this is stellar."
"M/D: On the thinner side, seemed watered down. Had high hopes for this beer, but it was a let down for me. Will reach for other beers in this style in the future."
"D - It's a light, drinkable beer but not worth craft brew money in my opinion"
"Pretty much the same as the bottle. Slightly better."
"I drank quite a few of these at the German American Oktoberfest I was at, but that is mostly because the only other beers offered were Spaten. If they had offered a better authentic German marzen, I think I would have taken it over this, but it was still a darn tasty beer. It also went great with my massive sausage platter!"
"D: The beer isn't very difficult to drink. I would consider trying this again because it was an unusual interpretation of the style."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. The color is medium orange with a 2 finger white head, no lacing. The aroma is sweet, bisquity. The flavor is sweet and bready, with a light finish. The body is a solid medium with moderate carbontation, and it drinks very easy. Not best in class,but a solid marzen."
"Another fine product from Stoudts. This is an excellent beer for an early, slight cool autumn day. Despite the low ABV, the overall sweetness may keep this one from being truly sessionable. Still, an excellent lager."
"D - pretty good, basic example of the style. refreshing and goes down pretty easy...wouldnt mind celebrating Oktoberfest with a few of these."
"Taste is crisp and creamy with a nice finish. It's got some toffee notes with a light hop presence. Very drinkable."
"Clear light orange brew gives a thin bubbly off-white head. Nose is pretty faint but nicely complex... a little spice, florals, hops, malt, etc. Taste is much more forward, fairly hoppy with a moderate marzen-type body, a tiny bit of acidic bite, carbo a bit too fizzy."
"Pours copper and a half finger head. Nice bready malt with a very light hop bitterness. Smooth yet bubbley on the mouth. Drinking is pretty much on on par with other mazens. Fits style but isn't anything special the write home about. If i was from pa it would be good"
"This beer pours a light copper color with a creamy white head that fades slowly with minimal lacing. I got a lot of sweet malty bread off the nose with the signature lager aroma off the nose. It is right in line with the style and gets me excited for the season. The carbonation on this one is very strong, maintaining itself as I finished the glass. Very smooth and fresh to taste with the grains taking the forefront but not aggressively so. The hops add just the slightest bitterness to finish it out. As it should be, this oktoberfest is clean, fully flavored, and extremely drinkable. I'm glad I still have a few in the fridge."
"Quite an enjoyable example of the style, plenty of flavor, traditional and all around good."
"Poured a ""Cider"" color, creamy white head. Good head retention, with some lacing. The aroma was weak consisting of caramel, and sweet toffee. Taste had mainly caramel and toffee. It was a little bitter at times but well done. Nice subtle cocoa notes on the finish. One of the better Oktoberfests I've had."
"This is a pretty decent Oktoberfest. NIce crispness, nice malts and Marzen lager flavors and aromas, some nice grassy hop additions. THe flavor comes a little light for me, but overall nice. No off flavors either so they did a good job lagering."
"Nice session drinker."
"D- This was a nice drinkable beer that I almost wish they made year round. I would be trading for this all the time if that was the case. A great drinking beer!"
"Drinkability is phenomenal. Perfect balance, great flavor, excellent mouthfeel. Beautiful beer."
"D - Excellent drinkability. Smooth and balanced, the aftertaste is clean and the full flavors make it a good drinking brew."
"I'm glad I revisited this one as its an elite Octoberfest in my opinion... Its fresh and loaded with a balanced rich maltiness and biting finish... Delicious.."
"Seems a touch thin in the mouth, but comes across as tasty and highly drinkable. I measure my American O-fests against Samuel Adams and this one falls short."
"Transparent orange with white bubbly head. Sweets smell of sugar, slight grains, cereal, honey, and some floral notes. Flavors of cereal, honey, floral notes, slight oranges and tang in the aftertaste. Light in body with light carbonation. A bland octoberfest worth trying but not the best."
"Very easy to drink with a nice mouthfeel that layers the tongue"
"D: This is a good beer, but not a typical Oktoberfest. Way too hoppy compared to a traditional Marzen. In my opinion, the brewer pushed the enevelope a little too far, almost to the point where it no longer fits the style. That said, it's still enjoyable, but if you want something more traditional, look elsewhere."
" good interpretation of the style"
"Stoudts knocks some beer out of the park. Unfortunately, Oktober Fest isn't one of them. Brewing outside the box is fine for some styles, but this one works better if it stays closer to the tried-and-true."
"I know it's getting near the end of its fridge life, but this one let me down. Although, it seems to have smoothed out since the fall. I was hoping for a nice bready sweet Marzen, but it seems like we want to hop everything up beyond recognition these days."
"D: Very good drink-ability. Good example of the Marzen style... I'd go for this one again."
"Over all a decent session beer but not my favorite for an oktoberfest."
"D -"
"d: I don't often reach for O-fests, so maybe my assesment is off. This just seemed pretty far removed from what is tradtional for the style. That doesn't usualy matter much to me, but it did bother me with this one."
"Notes: Stoudts has an extremely drinkable crisp body and nice simple flavor that I could drink plenty of with some soft sour dough pretzels and mustard."
"Would I buy more of it? - Yes, yes I would. I'd love to try it on tap at the brewery in Adamstown along with a big, fresh-from-the-oven, soft pretzel!"
"Pours a golden amber color, 1 finger of frothy white head, minimal retention, ok lacing. Smell is of roasted and sweet malts and a faint spicing and hoppy background, nice to see some of the toasty whiffs in there. Taste is a a balanced profile of sweet and roasted malts, like the smell there is a faint spice and hoppy finnish. Medium bodied, slightly chewy, good carbonation. Good representation of the style with a little more dark roasted malts than others."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a nice sessionable O-fest to pound down for a long time."
"D - I enjoyed my first Stoudt's experience. Tasty and easily drinkable in Liter mugs, it's one of my more favorite oktoberfests this season. It has a complex and delicate malt and hop balance that doesn't beat you over the head. Goes down very nicely."
"D - Way too sweet and yeasty for me. I only had a 4oz snifter full and poured the rest down the drain."
"A decent drink nothing worth seeking out for the holiday."
"Drinkability: I seen that there was only one 6 pack of this left so I figured alot of people must have liked this and were scooping it up fast. Not my favorite October I've tried but it has alot of characteristics to make it a decent try. Very drinkable, I can throw back a hell of alot of these in a short period of time. The malt was overly sweet for my palate and the body a bit too light, but otherwise, this a solid drinking O'fest."
"D - A very refreshing Oktoberfest. Would drink it if I could get it around here."
"Good flavor and pretty drinkable. Not a bad brew."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into a standard shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a clear dark amber color with about an inch of lingering, fluffy bone white head. Nose and flavor are of mildly sweet malt, toasty bread, light fruitiness, apples, pears. Medium in both body and carbonation with a clean finish. Worth checking out."
"single from Norm's, Vienna, VA"
"d- not too bad overall, not the best oktoberfest that i've had but it's solid."
"Pretty good! Would have it again."
"Pours a three finger off-white head that fades to a thin layer leaving some lace. Crystal clear amber color. Malty nose. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is a mellow bready malt. Dry aftertaste. $1.67 for a 12oz bottle from Manchester Wine and Liquors Manchester, CT."
"Drinkability: A disappointing example of the style. I usually enjoy Stoudt's, but this Oktoberfest isn't one of my favorites."
"It's even 5.0% which means I can enjoy a few more without getting too intoxicated. This sixer was $11.99 at my local good beer store, which seemed a bit steep. Other Stoudt's product (non-imperial/double) sell for $9.99. A bit expensive I felt, but still a good brew."
"Even mouthfeel, full with moderate carbonation, finishes tingly. Tasty and drinkable, good representation of the style."
"Drinkability: Not a bad Marzen. Stoudts produces some quality, easy drinking brews and this one does not disappoint. I've had better Marzens, but this one is good and I would reach for it again."
"Again, just alright."
"Drinkable and worth a try. If you enjoy the style, you can't go wrong with this example. I'd love to drink it out of a glass boot."
"Poured from a bottle. Thin white head that dissipates quickly. Yellow-orange transparent body, a little lighter than I expected. Smell was weak, a faint smell of spices and malts. Taste followed the smell, pretty thin and not a lot going on. Gets a little stronger as it warms up but still not much happening. Very drinkable beer though."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a crisp orange with a decent eggshell head. Aroma is a decent amount of sweet malts and mild Earthy hops. The taste is more sweet malts with subdued Earthy hops. The beer is quite light crisp and refreshing, perfect for the first chilly day in NC in at least 3 months! This is a very respectable Oktoberfest."
"D- high. This style is meant to be drunk in good volume, and as a good example of the style, this beer is up to that task."
"this one's pretty spot on for style. not too sweet, toasty malts and a slight bite (noble hops perhaps?). this may be my favorite american oktoberfest beer. goes down super easy like and oktoberfest beer should. has some really nice subtle nuances for a low abv beer. my only stroke against it, is that it is slightly over carbonated for the style. but that being said, this is a marked improvement in the domestic oktoberfest line."
"the flavor is pretty much the same plus some woodiness and a very mild bitterness on the finish which lingers into the aftertaste. bland...it tastes a little like it's been watered down?... medium body also feels like it's on the watery side. 5/3/5/2.5/13/2.9"
"A very sessionable Oktoberfest from Stoudts but a bit too light for my tastes."
"A great seasonal brew for the price. 2 of these after a day of work was just about perfect."
"It was an easy drinking Oktoberfest, but there wasn't much to it. I don't expect much out of a Oktoberfest, but a little more of anything would have been nice. Would I drink it again? I might because I like Stoudt's. Not one of their best beers, but at least it's drinkable. If you like crispy German style Lagers, then you should probably try this one."
"Stoudt's Octoberfest pours a light orange with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is mild, malty and a touch sweet. The flavor is also malty, with a biscuit like flavor. There is a bit of noticeable hops that balance out the flavor. Decent, worth a try."
"D/O: An easy-to-drink, yet rather tame interpretation of the style. A nice, year-round lager with a good balance between malt and hop, but there are better, bolder American Märzens out there."
"Drinkability: is awesome you can drink this beer all day and night its a great ofest beer"
"M/D: The carbonation may have been a little high, but it did not really detract from the beer. It was crisp, smooth, dry and left a nice aftertaste. The six-pack was gone quickly. This one will be a staple this fall season."
"Very nice drinkable beer. There are plenty of ofests out there that are much better. But this one is very simple and drinkable. Would make a nice session beer."
"Poured a clear coppery amber color with thin offwhite head. Little retention and minimal lacing. Smells of toasted grain, caramel, earth, and spicy hops. Tastes of lightly toasted grainy malt, caramel, and bread crust, with a spicy and earthy hop finish. Medium in body and moderately high in carbonation. Grainy but smooth and buttery with a metallic finish. I'd give it a try again, but I wasn't much of a fan of this one this time around."
"D- Pretty much middle of the road. Its easy to drink I just think there are better examples of the style."
"D- good beer and a nice session brew. A sixer would be perfect for the hockey game."
"D: An admirable offering in the Oktoberfest style, but in the middle of the pack when the whole package is considered."
"D-Quite possibly the best Oktobefest I'v had in 2008"
"Pours a clear light copper color with very thin white head with light retention and no lacing. Lots of toasted and carmelized malt aromas that mix with noble hops. Again, toffee and caramel flavors with some vanilla mix nicely with a muted hoppy finish. Low carb, medium body, this is a clean refreshing beer."
"Overall not bad at all, though it was entirely forgettable. This will most certainly not go down in my list of favorites for the season by any means. It was just too little with not enough character. Oh well, onto the next one."
"I wasn't overwhelmed by the flavor of this marzen, but it's well balanced and really doesn't have any off flavors to speak of. You might be wise to pick up a different brewer's version, which is surprising given Stoudt's track record."
"After spending $8.99 for a six-pack, I was disappointed. Light in color and body, lacking any distinctive taste, surely not of the true marzen style. Taste mediocre, alcohol kick sorely missing, particularly for the style. Definitely a step down from other Stoudt's products."
"D - Great drinkability, I think I'm going to grab a case before Oktoberfest if over."
"Overall, a good beer but too Americanized. Not sweet enough, and a little too hoppy."
"D- This is a pretty good American produced Oktoberfest that is worth a shot."
"Pours a copper gold with a fluffy white head. Good retention and a very nice lace. Aroma is grainy and buttery. Body is light and carbonated. Taste has some nice spices up front with a rich bread and butter finish. Some hints of honey make this a really enjoyable brew!"
"Bottle / Artwork - Blue and white diamond background is brought to life by a tubby tuba player in octoberfest gear... Great bottle..."
"A bit thin, but overall a nice, easy-drinking interpretation of a tradional O-fest."
"Poured a light brown color with no head. Smelled of light watery malts. The taste was a typical oktoberfest, some malts a spices. All around nothing wrong with it, but nothing stood out. I'll pass next time."
"I expected a lot more from Stoudts."
"A light, refreshing, drinkable brew, but none-too-impressive as far as Oktoberfests go. Low in alcohol for an Oktoberfest-Märzen, this would make a nice session beer, but lacks some of the proper character of the style."
"Overall, this is a great, refreshing beer. It is not much in the category of Oktoberfests, but it is a great German style nonetheless!"
"D: Overall, this beer did nothing for me. There was something about the taste that didn't sit well with me."
"There really aren't a lot of off flavors to slow you down. An easy drinker."
"Mouthfeel is very balanced and pleasant. This is yet another fantastic lager from Stoudts. All kinds of balance, flavor, and satisfaction. Highly recommended."
"D - the taste kind of grew on me as I neared the end of the glass and I would've had another if I would've bought more than 1 bottle."
"Pours a nice copper color, with no head. Aromas that are earthy, and a bit cidery. Same in the taste, a bit cidery, but not big in a fruit presence, and dry. A clean aftertaste, somewhat refreshing. Prefect for a nice warm fall evening, I might have to get a case for Halloween."
"D- A decent beer. Not my favorite or all oktoberfests, but enjoyable."
"Drinkability is very good, I like this take on the classic Oktoberfest, another great beer from Stoudts."
"Fairly drinkable, not bad for the style."
"Mouthfeel: Medium-to-thick bodie dmouthfeel... Creamy and chewy with rich malts and a great level of drinkability..."
"D: Overall decent beer but only slightly average for its style with slightly average flavor."
"This is an easy drinking light bodied beer that goes down waaaay too fast. A good 'toberfest!"
"mouthfeel is slightly creamy, good carbonation, and pretty true to the style, nice!"
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Color is a light shade of copper. Rather thin head that fades quicky. Lacing is decent. Moderate carbonation. Smells fruity and lightly malty. It tastes fruitier than other marzens I've had and the fruit kind of hides the malt. There is almost no hint of alcohol in the taste. Mouthfeel is light for the style and is an easy beer to drink. Certainly a drinkable and enjoyable beer though I've had better Oktoberfests."
"A nice interpretation of the style."
"D: A decent session beer. Many at the party, myself included enjoyed the beer. I liked it, although probably not my favorite Oktoberfest brew."
"D: Good beer all around. Not something I would seek out again but solid."
"D. A good session beer. Solid example of the style. Rates comparably to other Oktoberfests."
"D - Super easy to drink and representative of the Oktoberfest style."
"D, notes: Drinkable. Overly bitter for an Octoberfest. Nothing too exciting or noteworthy here."
"Stoudts delivers another fine German lager, how they made their mark. One of the better US O'fests."
"Nose is slightly brownish amber. No head. Nose is almost like there is nothing there. Flavor is very leafy. I feel like someone put dried out leaves right in my beer. And the aftertaste is really staying with me. Nutty as well. Man. Talk about a fall time brew. Seeing as how I am in the middle of August, I feel like it might be a bit early to be having such a seasonal beer. Feel has a nice carbonation to it. Liquid is pretty well bodied. This is a very good beer. A nice example of the style. If you are interested in the style, definitely try this one out. Pretty interesting I have to say."
"Drinkability is there, and overall, this is a pretty good beer, but not quite as dark or flavorful as I figured they would go far. Not a bad brew in the wide picture of things, but not quite the quality that I expect from Stoudts."
"Light bodied compaired to most O-fest i've tried with a bit of grainyness. Pleasing,goes down smooth,a sessionable O-fest. Wish I had another. A very good beer overall."
"The beer pours a dark golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale and bisquit malt scent. It's semi-sweet with a dry bisquity aroma. The taste is decent. It has a dry, malty flavor that's full of pale and bisquit malts. There is a light sweetness to it. Other than that it's quite simple. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer , although there are plenty of better choices on the market."
"Drinkability is good. This is a nice and easy to drink lager."
"Light copper with a half finger of white foam, slowly dissipates. Mild citrus, soft florals, slight esters and some honey malt notes. Lightly roasted malts, earthy at the beginning and soon after bitter hops take over adding a touch of pine and florals. Malt character displays a cereal grain up front and honey sweetness in the back. Citrus zest and a little metallic flavor become more apparent. Carbonation is high but manages a good creamy smoothness. The finish shows dry grains and some citrus pith."
"Pours a perfectly clear light copper in color with just shy of a finger of bone white head that leaves some decent lacing. Nice aroma, malty, namely Munich malts. No hop aroma, diacetyl, or esters. Flavor is definitely malt forward and fairly complex. There is some initial malty sweetness which is followed by some Munich/toasted malts. There is a pleasant hop bitterness that appears in the finish. Rather clean and crisp with just a bit of lingering bitterness. Good mouthfeel, medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Seems smooth and somewhat creamy but at times seems a bit slick in the finish. Overall this is a very enjoyable beer but seems more like a Vienna Lager than a marzen in appearance and body. This is an enjoyable fall seasonal that is certainly worth a try."
"Other than the body and the appearance, this is a nice marzen. The flavor is good with interesting differences that give this beer character."
"D - Was talked into buying a case at the beer store, and am not disappointed. Not the strongest O-fest I have had, but easily drinkable and tasty. Easily sessionable, esp. in the cooler months (i.e. October)"
"Pours a medium amber with bright gold highlights and a dusting of a head. Perfect clarity. Aromas of buttery amber malts and a touch of spiciness that I assume is hop-derived. On the palate, mild bitterness at the first, then things turn biscuity and a tad sweet. Balance remains, though, with some nicely scratchy hop notes asserting themselves as balance. Mouthfeel is quite smooth aside from the pleasant hop oils, while carbonation is spot-on for the style. This is a well done Oktoberfest Marzen beer. Good."
"The feel is spicy on the tongue. Medium-bodied but milky as it warms up. Leaves a light, pleasant film. Overall it's really a terrific brew; a fresher, smoother version of the typical Oktoberfest."
"Stoudt's brings something a little different to the Marzen style with the hop bitterness of this guy, and I rather like it! Besides my issues with the body, I found this to be a rather tasty and easy drinking Octoberfest."
"I'd call this a nice American-style Oktoberfest in that this is a nice smooth lager, but the caramel malts have a roasted edge to them. There's a nice malty aroma and taste, but it lacks the subtlety of a great amber lager. Still, a solid beer and a decent example of the traditional American O-fest."
"Recommended"
"Overall, a different kind of Oktoberfest beer to me. The taste is fine, not a great balance between malts/hops but certainly not bad. The mouthfeel is tough, though, with an off-key bitter tingling."
"D- This is a classic example of an O-fest but it has a little bit more of a hop bite. Despite low reviews, I really enjoyed this beer and I think it is a great example for the style. Its a tasty, drinkable German lager."
"I bought a case of this last year and remember it being better than this. I don't know if it changed or if my memory is skewed, but this is an average oktoberfest. It's disappointing because I really like Stoudt's and was expecting better here. Maybe they just need to change the name back to Fest, because that doesn't imply that it's an oktoberfest, but rather just a fall seasonal. Or they need a subtitle that says it's not true to the style, because it really isn't. It's not a bad beer, but Stoud'ts can do so much better."
"Disappointing."
"Poured into a tulip pint glass. Color was a dark amber brown. Head was an off white foam that lingered around the edges. Aroma smelled like sweet dark bread. Tasted like a sweet oaty bread. Felt slighty carbonated in the mouth with a hint of bitterness. Fairly easy to drink, but not one I would drink many of at once."
"Not bad."
"As with the other Oktoberfests I've been sampling lately, this example has its subtleties. Stoudt's has a certain tanginess to it. The grain is a bit more toasted and husky here. But it is nonetheless smooth and easy to drink."
"Overall- Very disappointed with this one. Stoudt's is usually pretty solid but this years Oktoberfest seems to be dumbed down."
"amber color with a white head and some lace. mild smell with a hop character and some nice nutty, malty notes. balanced taste with nutty, sweet (but not too sweet) malt, a little bread and some stinky german hops. medium big body for lager and smooth cream. easy drink. stoudt's"
"___"
"D- Very, very high. On this cool day, I'll be drinking more than one. Bring on some football, at least, games that count!! Another nice brew for a great brewery...Stoudt's."
"I must say, this beer is much better than last year's. Last year's batch was a little too sweet in my opinion. This pours a nice oft-brown color with a nice large head. Very nutty on the nose with some nice, bittering hops at the end, keeping the brew dry, which I love. Very malty and toasty, a nice interpretation of the style."
"Nice dark orange head, creamy lace around the glasses. Malty smell offset by slight alcohol tendencies. Goes down really well, slightly sweet but offset by spice and warmth of subtle hop and alcohol. Smooth drinking, great for a warm-up in the Cold when the fall comes. Much bettter than other versions I've had, they stuck to the proper recipe and made it their own."
"I don't like the finishing sensation with this beer, and generally don't find enough else positive in it to balance out this negative."
"Poured into a tumbler at 50 degrees. Beer had a nice brown rich color and smelled yummy of nuts and pumpkin. Good head that oozed that smell right into your olfactory glands and made you want to gulp it right away. Beer was a great beer and like a bock to me. I will certainly purchase again."
"Nice middle of the road Oktorberfest with great session drinkability."
"The mouthfeel is tangy with a medium body. This is not a bad beer and it is certainly easy to drink."
"Bright brassy-copper body, clean, with a small, loose, off-white head. Toasted caramel roll malts on the nose with spicy hops and light, sweet fruits. Toasted, grainy flavors up front. Turns to caramel and bread, with light cookie sweetness. Dry, fruitiness coupled with spicy, vegetal hops in the finish. Moderate body with a touch too much carbonation. Otherwise a fine, quaffable O-fest."
"Cheers!"
"Overall a unique tasting Octoberfest. Very nice floral hop. Very drinkable."
"The drinkability is quite good, Very sessionable. Prosit und Zum Wohl. MK"
"i was thirsty for a brew, so perhaps any beer would have tasted amazing right now, but this really hit the spot"
"B'ham UK"
"By far the best octoberfest that I have had this year. This is a drinking beer with flavor. Recommended."
"I liked this one. It's one of the better Oktoberfests I've had in a while. Definitely worth a shot."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with no freshness date. It was colored a dark honey color and poured a thin but nice head.It was fairly light bodied and had a spicy flavor to it, which I quite enjoyed. Along with the spice flavor, malt was there and subtle. A very drinkable Oktoberfest selection."
"One of the better American ""oktoberfest's"" beers I have had yet...but not great. I would recommend this beer to others and I plan on looking for other Stoudt beers!"
"This was a disappointment. Looked good with a light amber color, very modest head, but good carbonation. Initial impression was okay, just something I wouldn't want another of. After that it was all downhill, taste was dismal and left an alltogether unpleasant aftertaste."
"This Oktoberfest is a great example of the style. Of the ones I've tried this year, this one hits closest to the mark of what I consider a great Marzen Oktoberfest. Plenty of body, good mouthfeel, and higher-than-average drinkability. Just the right amount of maltiness, and the hops are there, although not too present (right on style, IMO). And the aftertaste is nice and refreshing. Definitely the best Oktoberfest I've had this year."
"Drinkability: Light and simple. So, you know, that's cool, if that's your thing. Me, I'll stick to other examples of the style or, better yet, Stoudt's other beers."
"12 oz bottle, pours a gorgeous crystal clear copper with a nice white head that sticks around for a long while. Nose is caramel, grainy malt, and a slight vegetal note, nothing too impressive. The taste on the other hand is excellent, a nice full doughy malt, slightly nutty, with a nice gentle touch of hops to finish things out. So smooth and creamy, so delicious, so easy to drink. This is a suberb Oktoberfest, seek this one out if you can find it."
"Low to medium bodied, this is a nice drinking beer. Not the best Oktoberfest, but surely worth looking for."
"Overall a nice Oktoberfest and easy to drink."
"Drinkability: Although that aroma is pretty foul, the taste more than makes up for it; a decent Oktoberfest"
"Overall: Not great, but not horrible. Definitely not my favorite Oktoberfest brew. Worth a shot, but not anything I'd seek out. Oh well."
"($8.49 / 6-pack)"
"M & D: Definately a smooth beer, but for me, pretty much only drinkable in the fall, when it reflects the season."
"Drinkability is good not the best Oktoberfest but not as bad as last years."
"Beer poured a nice coppery color with lively carbonation and a thin head. Smell was fresh. Hard to describe. Nothing really jumping out as a dominating smell. Taste was the same. Tasted good but no distinguishing characteristics to set this beer apart from another. Mouthfeel was crisp and lively. Good carbonation. Overall this is an average beer. The only conisistent thought going through my head while I was drinking this was that it is fresh. Not impressed but not a bad beer. Would rather try another Oktoberfest than this one."
"Translucent copper color with lacy white foam. The head is thick with a soapy, porous texture. Some malt aromas can be detected, but faint and not much else. Alcohol and malt flavors are up-front with a dry malt, medium-bodied aftertaste. Some bitterness in the aftertaste but flavorful. Overall, this was an enjoyable Oktoberfest beer from a very good brewery; definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability: This one has the potential to be a solid Oktoberfest beer, but unfourtunatly, it doesn't shine through like it should. It's not bad, but I'd rather go for a Sam Adams O-fest, and I never thought I'd have to choose SA over Stoudt's. Hmmm..."
"This is my second offering from Stoudts and I'm really impressed."
"One of the better O'fests I have tried so far this year. Poured a (dare I say?) orange hed brown. No head and it appears almost flat. But I still really liked the color of this beer. Nose is quite pleasanlty of just slightly toasted malts.Taste is simple and straightforward. Not lots of anything. Just some pleasant toasted grains. Hops just barely register. This is how I see an Oktoberfest tasting in Germany. Easily drinkable with some good friends as you sit around the table and chat. Unfortunately, my only negative about this beer is that it is fairly flat in the mouth."
"Drinkability is where this beer really shines. It's smooth and cool but hearty. It doesn't make you feel loaded down at all. I could definitely stand another. Will buy it again, may have people over for an evening of different brewery's Oktoberfests around mid-October, and this will definitely make an appearance."
"I can't imagine a much better O'fest. The aroma and flavor are delicate but impressive; makes you want more! Highly recommended."
"12 oz Oktoberfest bottle as shown on the brewery website, purchased as a single at the Vintage Cellar. My first Festbier of the season. Pours a clear and glowing copper amber body with a khaki head that rises one finger. Good retention before falling into profuse patchy and sticky lace. Munich malt aroma has notes of molasses, maple syrup, and toffee. Spicy floral hops back up the sweet maltiness. Mouthfeel has a light medium body with appropriate medium carbonation. Taste is dominated by the same maltiness noted in the aroma. Munichesque notes of toffee, molasses, caramel, and a definite hint of maple syrup. Restrained, but adequate, presence of floral and spicy German hops. Very tasty, but heavyhanded with the sweet Munich malts. Just a bit too sweet for good drinkability."
"As an aside, I believe this brew, in particular, needs a new listing as ""Oktoberfest"" if for no other reason than the fact that Stoudt's has brought the brewing of this Bier completely in house (not to be confused with its contract brewed bastard of a counterpart, Stoudt's Fest). In addition, Stoudt's will not be offering the Oktoberfest all year 'round, as they did with the Fest. The Oktoberfest, as it was explained to me, will only be available during the appropriate fall months."
