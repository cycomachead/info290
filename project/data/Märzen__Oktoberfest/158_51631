Smells and tastes true to style without being quite as rich and luscious as some examples. The maltiness is less than expected, the hops more, especially the bitterness. Overall this works well as an American example of the style, and the rye is a very well done component. As usual, Great Divide delivers a bold interpretation with.

An unexpected amount of fruitiness (easy there, no I didn't read the label right away). Bready malts, and a bit of spice as well. The taste features, sweet, very lightly roasted malts, led by caramel. A good amount of bread malts as well, and some grain. A little bit of bitterness. Some very lightly roasted nuts that were a very nice addition to the caramel. Very very well balanced, with a good deal of sweetness that doesn't go overboard. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. A bit sticky, with makes it a little harder to gulp down. Overall this one was a pleasant surprise, after having a few letdowns from Great Divide.","majorbase2","Nov 10, 2014"

I get a little of the same malt/grain taste that the Denver Pale Ale has. This was bottled in Oct. of '13, but still very good. Will look for fresh this fall. Well done. Overall 3.75 conservatively.

Color was a filament-bright deep-copper (SRM = > 13, < 17). Beautiful! Nose had a rich, malty scent, but I was not getting the fruitiness the label mentioned, at least, not on the nose. Mouthfeel was soft, slightly bubbly and now I did get a distinct cherry flavor on the tongue. Wild! The rye manifested itself on the dry finish, giving it an earthy balance to offset the malts. This was MUCH better than I anticipated and probably one of the best beers of the style that I have encountered. Great lacing formed as I drank through it.

Poured into a goblet it is a really nice orange color, very little head despite an un-careful pour, and there's just sort of a broken-down bubble-film floating at the very surface now. You can really, really smell the fruit right off the bat; definitely the cherries and maybe a little berry in there. Taste is also very cherry, and might I say, holy crap it is good. There's that sweetness that I notice a lot of GD's stuff has, and then on the back end there's a little bitterness and malt for a second or two (maybe that spice the label mentioned, but I don't really get that), and then it breaks clean off. Really nice. The mouthfeel is oily and smacky, and the carbonation, though low, is right there I feel for a marzen. I had this a few years ago at a restaurant and didn't like it, but I'm wondering if I got a bad bottle because this stuff's kickass. Nicely done!","BeerWizard","Jun 15, 2013"

Low to no noble hop flavors but appropriate clean bitterness provides good balance. Mouthfeel is med-full, creamy and makes this beer a joy to drink.

Thank goodness, as the flavor was off putting. Started of malty, and sweet, but ended with a tange of brown bread, which I found unappealing. (That might have more to do with the hot dogs baked in beans served with the brown bread that I hated as a kid, than it did with the actually bread) I was very excited when I found this beer, (Mar-zen, and Rye usually peak my intrest) but was extremely disappointed!","jwps214","Oct 07, 2012"

Tastes somewhat drier than the nose had me expecting, but still semi-sweet with caramel malt and plenty of toasted bread alongside a light herbal hopping garnish on the finish. The cherries from the aroma are very much subdued upon the palate in the actual flavor, but that's okay, because the caramel malt gains some nuttiness to compensate that wasn't as perceptible in the aroma. If only these aspects carried fully back and forth from nose and palate to present a complete spectrum, this would have been absolutely amazing.

3.2,-14.4,3,3,3.5,3,3,"Hoss Rye Lager pours a deep burnt orange/auburn, falling just short of having full clarity. There's a finger or so of white foam capping the beer. It fades pretty quickly, and lacing is fairly spotty. The nose is pretty dull and lifeless, but what is there is nice. There are some bready and toffee aromas, and the delicate spiciness of rye creeps in a little bit in the background. The flavor has a little more vivacity to it, with biscuit and caramel maltiness coming together for a lingering opening. Earthy, lightly peppery rye comes in for the close, but seems to die out before the beer hits the back of my palate. The mouthfeel is definitely not ""crisp"". The body's a little bit chewy, and the carbonation lacking, and leaves the beer giving a syrupy impression. I think a rye marzen could be a pretty interesting beer, but Hoss Rye Lager just suffers on the execution end.","axeman9182","Jul 05, 2012"

A small bit of sweet, a little hint of peppery spice, with a mellow banana bread almost. Felt good in the mouth. Coated very well, but the carbonation seemed to be all over the place.

Maybe a little cherry in there but maybe that's just me looking for it because I saw that ingredient mentioned on the bottle. Starts off sweet from the heavy malt base and some cherries. Slowly but surely a little hops kick inn towards the end and the rye asserts itself in the finish. A heavy body to this, kinda syrupy mouthfeel to this with very little carbonation. Overall, this one seemed to grow on me. While I do find it to be a little too much on the sweet side for me the 2nd half of this beer seems to counter that sweet aspect well enough that I found myself enjoying it overall. The taste that sits with you after a sip is a nice combo of the malt, the spicy rye, and a little hops and I enjoyed that. This beer is definitely a sipper, definitely the antithesis to a session beer, imo. I probably won't be running back to the store to pick up more of this right away but it is a beer I will drink again.","denver10","Feb 07, 2012"

The head is off-white, about a finger thick and multidimensional. The head does fade, letting the beautiful beer color shine through, but is does lace the glass nicely. Aroma is subtle and yeasty, and as you near the bottom of the glass, a scent of iron filings comes through. The flavor is well balanced, the malt and bitter nicely cancel each other out. The finish is very dry, and it is only in the aftertaste that you get the rye. Very easy drinking beer that goes well with food.","iSip","Nov 25, 2011"

More like dark cherry, perhaps some cherrywood, or whiskey-soaked cherry, if I was pressed to pin it down. The rye gives it an edge, but Iâd be hard pressed to describe just what, exactly.

Overall, this is a very good beer that I will certainly drink again.","KarlHungus","May 05, 2011"

The taste spotlights the (now stronger) orange and caramel, with some light pinches of black pepper in the background.

The retention was only as a thing collar and the lacing was not much to speak of either. Scattered spots at best. The aroma was strong with the ways of the grain, rye, wheat and some wet grass. Behind that was a more traditional caramel malt backbone. The flavors were a good, balanced blend of a Marzen/Rye beer with lots of grain presence, strong notes of caramel and rye, some butterscotch, hints of kettle corn, a little earth and very little hops presence. A festival beer, for sure; very quaffable. The body was medium, the carbonation light and the mouthfeel a little watery. A great food beer. One could easily throw these back with a schnitzel or two.

It's pretty disjointed, a giant rift running through the middle of it... sweetness way over here, spice and hop waaaay over there, nothing in the middle. As it warms the sweet side develops a bit of warm vanilla. The feel is on the light side of moderate, reasonably creamy with soft carbonation. I disagree with the label claim of ""crisp"".

Aroma is primarily biscuit-like malt with a nominal caramel character and ever-so-slight spice/earthy quality given from the hops. Flavors here are pretty standard for a Marzen with an emphasis on the malt; however, the mouthfeel is a bit too thin lacking the lingering bread notes a Marzen usually carries. The added rye probably lends to this as this one finishes noticeably dry. A very refreshing beer with enough hop character to balance out the malt focus, which makes for a solid summer brew.","WOTO97","Jul 24, 2010"

Smells very malty with only a touch of spicy rye at the finish. Tastes creamy and very malty with a rich sweetness and firmness and once again only a touch of spicy rye. I suppose I see the point of adding the rye to try to balance the malty sweetness, but I'm not entirely sure it works. The deeper more savory rye notes are lost under the malt, and only a bit of spiciness survives to balance. Still, its tasty enough as a Marzen, and has a nice creaminess to it with the rye spice at the end.","Georgiabeer","Jun 26, 2010"

Head is about a half an inch thick and slightly tan and fizzy. No real legs or head retention. Aroma is somewhat malty and earthy, most likely due to the rye. Initial sip gives off a lot of malt character with the rye lingering in the finish. Relatively crisp and dry, surprisingly refreshing. Light mouthfeel with lingering rye, though it can be a little bit syrupy. Some caramel notes are present in the background. As you acclimate to the beer the hops come through with notes of citrus and fruit - lots of cherry. The rye makes this taste almost like it's been oak aged.

Deep and vibrant metallic red to coppery orange colored liquid, clear with excellent reflective brilliance, quite pretty. Pastry flakes, milk chocolate, honey coated orange citrus, more of a warm butter than toast covering, the rye waits until the penultimate moment to move forward into the spotlight. Medium-bodied, however, lounges squarely on the palate and unpacks a picnic basket of caramel, milk chocolate, molasses, honey, graham cracker, croissant and ripely sweet oranges. The carbonation is like tiny explosions, precise and prickly yet with no staying power. As a flavor the rye has a clear delivery but doesn't add much texturally, the hoppy side of the equation slacking. The sweetness never comes close to cloying and for a more or less one-sided beer it's, err, decently balanced. Drinkability highest when coldest.","farrago","May 05, 2010"

The taste is where this beer really shines: classic caramel maltiness upfront, followed by some doughy malt flavors, spicy rye flavors, mineraly hops and a touch of cherry. This is a really superbly balanced beer, a little sweet but with a drying finish. The mouthfeel is full and smooth but not overbearing, and drinkability is excellent.

I wouldn't buy it often, but it's definitely something I'll look for as a regular seasonal.","WesWes","Mar 04, 2010"

Flavor is fantastic sweet with malts and rye more of that honey simple syrup flavor with a fruity apple and caramel drizzled tone. But the hops and the rye malt balance things out with a grassy, spicy herbal tea accent. Mouthfeel is a bit stickier with residual malts especially with the higher alcohol and the rye additions carbonation is pleasant and smooth the entire bottle. Definitely a medium body with the rye giving it a bit more girth than your average marzen. Drinkability is solid from the first sip to the last drops, a beer that strikes gold coming from such a known ale brewer to dabble with their twist on a great German style, I enjoy it and look forward to more next year.","WVbeergeek","Dec 03, 2009"

The palate opens with a surprisingly strong hop character, quite herbal and earthy with a little mineral-like character. Bitterness is low, and this allows the malt to shine, with a great caramel and burnt sugar character, along with the spicy rye character which especially dominates the mid-palate and towards the finish.

Maybe this has something to do w/ the Rye but like others have said the rye flavor is very subdued and difficult to detect.

3.18,-15,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a pale golden brown with a thin beige head. Nose has mellow grains, faint grassy hops and a subtle rye aroma. Taste is also on the lighter side for a Marzen. Drinks well, but could use a bit more depth. I didn't find much of a rye presence. Light body is well carbonated.","rye726","0"
