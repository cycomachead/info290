3.88,3.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce can into dimpled mug; no canning date, but from 2013. Pours slightly hazy orange copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, pear, apple, floral, herbal, light pepper, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt and yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, toffee, floral, pear, apple, herbal, light pepper, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, toffee, herbal, floral, pear, apple, light pepper, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and robustness of malt and light earthy hop flavors; with a fair amount of yeast esters with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Oktoberfest style. All around good balance and robustness of malt and moderate yeast ester flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 10, 2013"

4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"Appears a deep copper hue with off white cream head, fine even spaced lacing looks great. Aroma has caramel malts, herbal hops kicking in the backend, with a complementary air of very refreshing beer. Lager in a can, I'm game especially microbrewed O Fest. Semi sweet malts bring nutty, earthy notes between the malts and Euro hops I'm very excited to sink my teeth into the rest of the 5 cans I have from the sixer I purchased. Slick oily yet clean and refreshing all in one gulp, I'm a big fan of this Chicago brewed lager, I do know they have a decent German heritage in Chi town this could have been brewed by a direct descendant or a rebel revolutionary who knows how to brew good beer. I'm a fan of the brewery, brewery, and brews that they produce. This is all around quality, go try some if you see the tuba touting lederhosen clad gent next to the fist of the revolutionary. Great artwork complements great beer, go try some folks.","WVbeergeek","Aug 22, 2013"

4.03,7.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Served on tap at Whole Foods Schaumburg. Appearance is a deep reddish orange with striking clarity. Dense white head leaves thin layer that retains, heavy lacing. Nose is full of deep grains, notes of lager yeast, caramel, an earthy hint of spicy grain in the vein of rye or pumpernickel. Taste is full of wonderful fall flavors, plenty of bready malts with deep caramel notes and a hint of spice. Bitter hops come through and balance out the malts with an earthy component. Mouthfeel is appropriate, maybe a tad high on carbonation. Overall, this Is a great and tasty version of a marzen. Worth a try (as are all Rev brews)","homebrew311","Sep 17, 2012"

3.49,-6.7,4.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"O: A very solid representation of the style, but it doesn't wow me. Very solid malty sweetness and the light hop backing adds another depth of flavor. At 4.99 this a great value and would buy again if i was in the right setting.","Treebs","Sep 06, 2012"

3.53,-5.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Somehow, this is my first Revolution beer from the bottle. Go figure. It pours a clear copper-tawny topped by a finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises biscuit, light honey, light rye toast, mild spicy and earthy hops, and a tiny touch of deep fried chicken skin (...yeah, this is what came to mind...I dunno...). The taste brings in more of the same, though the hops are slightly stronger and lean a bit more floral now, and a pinch of black pepper is tossed in absentmindedly. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a nice, solid O-Fest, nothing spectacular or eye-opening, but something I could easily have a couple of beneath a tent at some big party of some kind...","TMoney2591","Sep 02, 2012"

4.1,9.6,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"O: A very good example, a fester should be stronger than a normal amber lager, but it has to retain a specific feel to it, many oktoberfests get stronger without the hops and end up very sweet, the others raise the bitterness but the hops flavor goes away and you are left with harshness, this one is a good balance, it is designed to be consumed in large quantities after all","dpodratsky3","0"
