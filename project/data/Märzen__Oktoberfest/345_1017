4,8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Enjoyed from a 12 oz bottle in a pint glass, this solid example of a festbier pours cloudy orange brown with a nominal off white head and decent lacing.  Nose of biscuit, caramel malts, and some light bittering hops.  Flavors are straight forward for the style.  Rich caramel malts on all sides with a bready characteristic and light bittering hops to the rear.  Smooth lightly coating mouth feel finishes wet with a light sweet aftertaste mingling with light hops.  Very true to the style.","Brutaltruth","Dec 22, 2014"

The taste has a much more refined caramel quality with a little nutty aspect and there's just a hint of earthy hops. A little thinner on the body but not off. A slight tickle from the carbonation. A decent example of the style.","delta490","Sep 13, 2014"

Not overly malty on the nose; some yeasty bread, honey, nuts, candied fruit, a little funk. The initial taste is sweet vanilla followed by tangy fruit (some citrus), pine, minerals, and hops. And the hops linger. For me, a bit too hoppy (and too carbonated) for an Oktoberfest, but Victory being Victory, I guess we should have expected more hops than less.","kaufmaal","Oct 15, 2013"

This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, but the flavors didn't hold my attention, I could drink a couple of these but I would rather have something with a little more flavor. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was the truest to style and it worked well with this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was how boring this beer was, a little hops would have helped this beer out and impart a little bit of complexity. I don't think I would buy this again, there's many other Marzen's that I would much rather have and would buy instead, it's worth trying if you really like the style, but I don't think it will make the top of anybody's list of great Marzen's.

A bit heavy on the hops for the style, lots of earthy herbal hops compete with an inadequate malt base. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and an earthy slick mouthfeel.

Taste of big pear, toast, caramel, biscuit, toffee, apple, earth, herbal, and light nuttiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light fruit, earth, and herbal on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance and robustness of flavors; with no cloying sweetness at all.

Taste is malty and smooth with a grainy quality that flows to a well integrated hop component that balances the caramel sweetness and gives a somewhat longish dry finish. Well developed nuttines shows towards the swallow, gives a nice platform for the bitterness to blossom. Feel is medium with a light tingley carbonationan and a crisp overall character.

Aromas of roasted malt, both nutty and richly sweet, with a bready backbone and some old world fruit highlights. Flavors are rich and thick, with a roasted backbone supporting fresh and sweet flavors of pumpkin, nuts, and a spice blend of nutmeg, cumin, and cinnamon. Very forward and bold on the palate. Sweetness has a touch of brown sugar going into the aftertaste, which is tangy sweet and only lightly roasty/toasty. Good transition of the flavors as you drink.

The first thing that I noticed was that this brew was a little thin and not what I would consider for the body of an Oktoberfest. On the nose, I got…nothing. No joke. Not a thing. It was like sniffing water. Maybe if I thought really hard about it, I could get some sort of earthiness and a hint of sweetness. But, it would be a reach. The taste is primarily watery, just how it looked. I didn’t get a lot of taste on it. Maybe some sweet malt on the taste and a hint of earthiness? I’m surprised about the lack of flavor in this brew. I didn’t really like it and would not get it again. Definitely underflavored.","mgironta","Sep 16, 2012"

The aroma was of caramel, bread, butter and a bit of toasted malt. The flavors were an interesting balance of very sweet caramel malt and dry but floral hops. The bready malt and dry yeast also came through in the middle and I also got some toast and pine nuts as it warmed up. The sweetness seemed a little too much for a Marzen to me and I wasn’t exactly ‘wowed’ but I suppose this could just be my impression of the Victory interpretation.

I’m not sure I personally like it, due to the odd sweetness, but there is nothing in there to severely offend anyone. It’s fairly balanced though a little bit off kilter on the sweetness, but overall worth a go for the price if you don’t mind a fairly “flat” Marzen. Maybe this bottle wasn’t any good, because I know it wasn’t old and my review seems quite contrary to the others.","seesnow3","Nov 08, 2011"

The flavor has a strong nuttiness tending towards almond, and is smoothed out by notes of biscuits and toffee, and yet it does not cross the line into sweetness.

Served in a mug, the beer pours a clear amber/orange color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. Aroma is toasted and bready malt, nuts, and a bit of spicy hops. The brew tastes mostly like toasted malt and nuts, with some bready malt and light spicy hops noticable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's smooth and easy to drink with moderate carbonation. Not a bad brew at all, I'd definitely buy this one again.

3.99,8.4,3,4,4,4.5,4,"Fresh nose full of toasty, nutty and fruity goodness with hints of grass and spice. Great balance of flavors here. Nutty, grainy and toasty malt profile.

It has a mellow flavor that's well blended. It tastes grainy and fruity with notes of pretzels, bread crust, caramel, possibly a hint of cherry.

The malt content in the aroma and taste comes off toasted-grainy, nicely sweet and yet a tad syrupy, however, something's lacking - a certain something that fails to round out the flavor to its full potential. Throw in some mustiness up front and vague cabbage (greens) in the back, and that sums up the taste. Compared to the others, the body is fuller, touching on viscous in its smoothness, yet it finishes dry enough not to stick. I can't help but feel this would go well with dishes that include potato - German (red) potato salad, potato cakes - things like that.","Bouleboubier","Nov 25, 2010"

The beer looked okay, it was a clear russet brown with very little head that completely vanished within a minute. The smell was intensely malty--toasty and grainy. The beer tasted just like this, very malty, a little sweet, some grain astringency and a weird herbaceous hop aftertaste. There is a little nutmeg or cinnamon spiciness and a raw walnut nuttiness. The beer is definitely under-carbonated and feels a little thin.","Soonami","Oct 24, 2010"

The smell is full of toasted malt, a touch of honey and bitter hops. The taste follows to be a big grainy and very earthy. The toasted malts are very predominant in the one and the beer has a slight honey sweetness to it. However, the grainy taste is a bit overpowering. The mouthfeel is light and somewhat watery.

It pours a clear amber orange topped by a finger or so of very light ecru foam. The nose comprises caramel, clove, vanilla, and brown sugar, with a hint of orange in the back. The taste ups the orange's ante slightly, diluting the sweeter notes, but the caramel maintains itself nicely, making up for some of the once-lost ground. The body is a nearly-heavy light, with a light carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a very nice O-Fest, proof that Mike ain't completely crazy just yet.","TMoney2591","Oct 09, 2010"

Lots of cereal, granola, biscuit and grains in the nose, quinine or mineral water too, pepper spice, takes awhile for a caramel or toffee scents to get going, walnuts, limited but steady orange citrus, no real distinct fruit component. Medium-bodied, there's a strong, wiry carbonation to it which keeps it moving at a brisk pace. Not that sweet, seems closer to the ""traditional"" Märzen recipe with grain, pumpernickel bread, corn husk, walnuts and chestnuts, white pepper. As in the nose, subdued orange citrus as well as peach, pear, yellow apple fruit. Thin patina of milk chocolate and caramel.

There is also a very subtle hop presence which provided an excellent balance of bitterness to the sweet malts and spice notes.

There is a lemon citrus scent in at the end. The malt is very dominant right at the front of each taste. There is a very feint grassy bitterness at the end. A thin feel at the front, it gradually gains weight as flows across the palate. I am of the believe that there is no such thing as an undrinkable oktoberfest/marzen.

It's pretty clean, but there's not a lot behind it. Feels a little dead, could use some more carbonation.

Pours a brownish copper color with a ruby red glow... smell is very buttery and creamy... The taste is great, with caramel, vanilla, butter, and bread flavors... The best thing about this beer is that it went down so easily... like drinking water... mouthfeel was equally exceptional, and although this isn't the most flavorful offering I've sampled from Victory, it's clean, creamy taste truly satisfies... will definitely purchase this again next autumn...

The taste is smooth, malty, and for a drinkable as I find this beer to be, the malt gives it some substance and there are enough hops to give it a little bite. Unlike many Octoberfests, where there is a roasted malt or dark molasses taste, this beer is on the sweeter side of this style, but it works well and makes for a well rounded autumn beer.

There is but a flash of grassy and spicy hop flavor right at the beginning of the taste, but the rest of the flavor profile here is almost entirely about bready malts, with a very faint caramel note appearing before a mildly spicy hop finish. A chewy bread flavor lingers in a most unhurried fashion through the aftertaste. There is moderate carbonation here, but it's felt only at the finish and is rather appropriate. Overall clean lager mouthfeel, gets a bit heavy as it warms. I appreciate that the alcohol is not overly amped-up in this Maerzen, unlike many other American interpretations. I tried this on tap a couple of weeks ago and didn't review it, but I seem to remember liking it far less than this bottle. Interesting.

The other flavor aspects, light breadiness and a bit of hop bitterness, are quite nice. The mouth is right where I want it, medium, with medium carbonation too.

And with the higher-than-average price tag, I wont be getting this again.","ski271","Oct 17, 2005"

Overall, a very clean grain flavour with some toastiness that's balanced by moderate hop flavour. Very smooth texture, medium carbonation, some residual sweetness and sugar.

The taste is also malty, but with a slight hop bitterness, or maybe tangy-ness, towards the end. The sip finishes with an odd aftertaste that I just cant seem to figure out. The mouthfeel is crappy. Maybe not terrible, but too thin and too fizzy when it first hits the palate. Drinkability is average.

The aroma begs you to delve deeper with a softly sweet and mildly toasty (even gently bready) maltiness that's enhanced by a delicate floral hoppiness that's quite alluring! The mouthfeel is gently crisp from a fine carbonation, and slick across the palate with a medium/full maltiness. The flavor starts with a sweetish maltiness that expresses a soft toastiness and mild toffee notes as well as some lightly floral hop flavor. It sweetens slightly as it warms, but then finishes dry with some gentle bitterness and a lingering nutty and toasty 'crust of bread' note that gives it exceptional drinkability. It continually becons to you taste again! Exceptionally well-balanced and rich without being overbearing! As much as Victory is known for their heavy-handed beers (such as the hop drenched Prima Pils), they should also be recognized for their beers that display impeccable balance. This is one of them and it should not be overlooked!","NeroFiddled","Dec 17, 2002"
4,8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer poured into the glass a amber/copper/orange color and was very clear, very bright, seemed to glow with the light. The head had an orange tint to its big foamy white mound. The aroma was of herbs, hops, bread (yeasty) malt and some hints of alcohol near the end, slight. The taste was of roasted bread malt, herbs, hops, caramel seemed to pick up near the middle of the tongue then ends with the nutty malt and slightly bitter hops flavor. A good example of this style of fest beer.","Jarod","Dec 16, 2002"

2.47,-32.9,2.5,3,2.5,2,2,"Musty malt/old sneaker smell. Crystal amber color. No lasting head at all. Sweet chewy malt flavor with a smidge of hops. Very dissapointing effort for one of my favorite breweries. The label says victory but the taste is not one of a victory product. Overly sweet, unbalenced, and no head retention at all. Like sweet syrup.","frank4sail","Dec 06, 2002"
4.08,10.9,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Clear bright copper body with a fine, steady stream of carbonation. Head came foamy up, and quickly left, leaving behind the thinnest of tops. Aroma is of fresh bread from the bakery up the block, not strong, but there. Taste is of deep, toasted malts, a hint of dark chocolate. Not overly, cloyingly sweet. Just a whisper of hops, I believe they are there, but can't be sure. Second best domestic O'fest I've had this season.","RonfromJersey","Nov 21, 2002"
4.13,12.2,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"A malty, clean tasting 'fest that is highly drinkable....looks great in the glass....orangish...lace coats glass nicely...nose is of sweet malts...the body rates about medium....tastes of sweet malt and toasted grains...finishes on a dry, spicy note....very drinkable...very tasty....one of the better O'fests I've had this year...","ZAP","Nov 20, 2002"
3,-18.5,3,3,3,3,3,"Heaven knows Victory has more than enough great beers to keep us beer geeks more than happy.This one though is probably made to keep their less adventurous brewpub patrons content.","Scoats","Nov 13, 2002"
3,-18.5,3,3,3,3,3,"Clear amber with full head that completely vanished. Aroma mostly of caramel malts. Victory has put forth a big sturdy malt base for this beer... and leaves it at that. No appetizing hop dryness, no traditional spiciness. Just a sweet syrup of a beer, hints of butter but cloying. Well-made but ho-hum, esp. for Victory. Drinkability low for a Fest, since the hops do not pull their weight in creating a dry tasty finish or spiciness. Not bad by any means, in fact those who don't warm to O'Fests might actually enjoy this especially if they roam around the dopplebock end of the spectrum. May also be good for cooking.","Thrasher","Nov 05, 2002"
3.68,0,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Notes: Next time I have this beer I’m going to pair it up with a big fat juicy Ruben … extra kraut please. I think Victory tackled the style quite well with this one, a must try for any beer geek that makes their round of Oktoberfest Beers.","Jason","Oct 24, 2002"
4.5,22.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Dark gold, light amber color with a low head.  Light spicy malt aroma and an awesome candy-like sweet flavor (reminiscent of smarties?).  There was a nutty character as time went on.  A medium bodied and creamy brew.  One of the best American style Oktoberfests in my tasting.","RBorsato","Oct 24, 2002"
4.07,10.6,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This beer is a clear amber, but lacks a head.  Only a slight collar is present.  Aroma is full of a deep maltiness.  A bit of a candied like aroma is also present.  Has a medium full body.  And unlike many ofest, this one has a taste I can get in to.  I think it's got a little bit more of a munich and vienna characteristic than a lot of the other ofests.  The hebal hops accent very nicely as well.  This is a nicely put together oktoberfest.  Very clean tasting and highly drinkable.  Nice effort from the gang at Victory.","Bighuge","Oct 16, 2002"
3.73,1.4,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Looks very much like an Am. version of style, in that greater attention to amber-orange color (it seems many German ones aren't so dark).  Big to huge full head.  Light toast, yet pleasantly sweet malt aroma.  Flavor is adequate for style, maltiness with roasty quality, yet non-distinct for many I've sampled this autumn.  Very nice creaminess to mouthfeel, with nice richness without being heavy, and not excessive in carbonation.  Finish is fairly long lasting with pleasing dryness of the malt and not bitter.","garymuchow","Oct 16, 2002"

3.86,4.9,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Deep orangey color, 1/2 inch foam settles to a skim in about a minute.  Malty aroma, but a little tang in there.  Malty while not being overly sweet, good body early.  Proper sense of a good toast and a clean finish.  A little more hops than some, while lacking some nutty qualities.  There seems to be a variety of opinions on this beer, I found this suitable for style while a little hoppy and quite drinkable.  Aged properly, according to Marzen style.","ADR","Oct 02, 2002"
2.61,-29.1,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"The color and head look promising. After that I'd have to agree with previous reviewers that this is sub-par for Victory. Not as clean as a Marzen should be IMHO. Some diacetyl is detected and I thought while drinking that it might be an ale. Just verified via the Victory site that it's indeed a lager. Not bad, but very unVictory like.","John","Sep 24, 2002"
4.3,16.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a smooth amber color as a Ofest should be. With a decent lasting, pillow like, off-white colored head. The aroma is mostly of Barvarian malts, slightly nutty, and caramel . On the palate more of the malts, caramel, german hops make a slight bite, toasty, slight graininess, not really complex but it has nice full flavor with depth, nice sweetness, smooth mouthfeel. This is a very good Ofest IMO","WilliamPhilaPa","Sep 18, 2002"
3.55,-3.5,3,3,4,3.5,3.5,"This is basically a solid, well made Marzen style beer, but not up to Victory's usual standards.  Carmel and mildly toasty sweetness dominate the brew.  At times the sweetness boarders on syrupy.  Not much of a head, and the aroma is understated.  Still, it's a good beer, but not typical of Victory.","Suds","Sep 15, 2002"
4.07,10.6,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Taste is somewhat light, fresh and quick, basically sweet caramel-malt with a touch of very light hop bitterness to balance. Very clean soft mouthfeel, fades fast. A real good session beer.","bmills1608","Sep 12, 2002"
