"Pours a deep orange with a finger or so of bubbly white head. Bready malt aroma with a touch of piney hops. The taste is of biscuits, caramel and toffee, with a nice piney aftertaste. Medium mouth with decent carbonation. As Surly admits on the label, this isn't your traditional Oktoberfest, but it's freakin' great."

"Overall:  I like it.  As it says on the can, it isn't intended to be a classic Ofest beer.  Nonetheless, it is close in some intriguing ways, and it delivers on the rye, which is always appreciated.  In the right mood and on the right day, I find this beer to be awesome.  Other days, its an oddball, but one I appreciate.  This year like every year, its gone too soon."

"Poured into a becker a clear rich copper/bronze with a thick creamy white head atop.Grain and light toast in the nose along with mild spicy rye.Dry on the palate wich I liked alot with German malts toasted bread notes,a good shot of spicy hops and light lactic rye in the finish.I could drink this from a stein all day,a great O-fest beer."

"Pours a brilliant clear orange with dense white head, terrific retention, and some nice sticky lacing.  Nose features biscuity malt up front with that trademark marzen character that I can only describe as the smell of fall or freshly raked wet leaves.   The nose also has a noteable hop presence which I'm not used to for the style, but I must say that it is welcome.  The taste is malt forward with notes of biscuit, honey, and bread.  This is followed up by slight herbal hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel is light with appropriate carbonation.  Overall, one of the more enjoyable oktoberfest beers that I have had."

"If by ""Oktoberfest," Surly actually means ""pale ale," then OK.  So not a fest bier."

"I love both Surly Furious and Cynicale, so I'll stick with those Surlys."

"O:  Not a typical Oktoberfest, but these guys love pushing the style guidelines so thats no surprise.  I really liked this beer and it lived up to my expectations and excitement to try it."
"Surly's take on the Octoberfest brew.  Sometimes a brewery produces an Octoberfest just because... However, Surly rarely does anything ""just because.""  Surly Fest is made with the same gusto as Abrasive, Furious, Darkness, and pretty much every other brew they make.  Fest tastes like no other Octoberfest out there.  It is unmistakeably hoppy, yet not too much so it takes away from what it is.  I'd hate to call it an IPA-esque Octoberfest, but that's a fairly accurate description.  Very attractive red-bronze color and a fairly thick head, agreeable aroma, and a smooth mouthfeel with a pleasant hint of carbonation.  Of the dozens of Octoberfests I've had, this one is by far the best.  If you have a chance to get it, do so.  Your taste buds will appreciate it."

"O: Really digging this beer â€“ it's not always my favorite style, but this example is well-lagered and enjoyable. I do wonder what yeast strain they used because it comes across very well in this beer, and the rye addition with restrained American hops (don't know which one, also curious about this) create a very drinkable and tasty beer. I feel like this is a beer that needs to be in my fridge every fall."

"O - I really enjoyed this offering from Surly. Something different to drink in the sea of Oktoberfests."
"09/04/13 can into a tulip glass. Thanks yamar68! Pours a clear dark amber/red body with a finger of tan foam. Aroma is a combination of sweet bubble gum, citrus, caramel malts and spicy rye. Taste is milder with the citrus and fruit working off of the caramel and spiced rye bread perfectly. A little lingering hop bitterness. Mouth feel is full and coating for a lager. This is a really interesting beer. It's really delicious and kind of perfect for the colder weather."

"SurlyFest pours a dark copperish color with a small lacing head. There is a mellow sour rye aroma. The taste has a slightly sour, but sharp rye like bite, with a nice hop bite. Very full body, yet very drinkable. Overall its a very solid and well crafted beer."
""
""
""
"That's pretty much where it lines up. The rye spiciness is front and center, perhaps to excess. I would have liked a fruitier finish to back all of this rye. Still, it's clean-finishing, if a little heavy."

"O - this is a fine brew with a nice mix of spicy rye grain, sweet malts, and a smooth finish, not a traditional 'fest' beer as I know it but big ups for putting a twist on it, this brewery is the real deal"
""
""
"apparently surly makes only interesting and top quality brews. I love this one. its like a Oktoberfest, but is spiked with rye malt, and has a unique vanilla character im not used to in the style. the pour is more bronze than orange, mostly clear, with an inch or so of lasting white head. the nose is german malty, but with that familiar peppery rye kick and a finish of fresh vanilla beans cut open and scraped clean. yum! the flavor is a little less dramatic on the vanilla, and its more toward the front than the finish, but its still there. the malt balances out into a nice german traditional marzen style. this has characteristics of both an ale and a lager, its crispness is remarkable for its complexity, and its super sessionable. strong carbonation lightens up a fuller medium body, and the 6% abv is just right for me in thus style. overall a very strong offering from surly, I really love the vanilla twist here."
"O - Old, but still tasty. Some hops still left. How'd I miss this one? I want a fresh one!"
""
""
""
"I went in expecting a typical marzen, but this was actually quite different: a tasty rye lager. A mostly clear, darker amber pour, with a small, foamy, white head that sank to a collar and left a few streaks of lacing on the glass. Aroma was sweet with malts, bready, toasty, herbal hops. The taste reflected the scent, sweet malts, bready, toasty rye--not too distinctive, but still apparent--light herbal hops. Crisp, clean mouthfeel, medium body, maybe light-medium, quite drinkable overall. A nice and unexpected treat."

"Beer pours a reddish-brown with a fluffy white head and lots of bubbles. Smell is caramel malt with hints of spicy rye. It essentially smells like your average marzen with a little something extra. The flavor is where this beer really shines, it has that great caramel malt flavor of a marzen but adds in some awesome spicy rye and a bit of hops. It's incredibly full-flavored but has a nice clean finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with some heavy carbonation. This is a pretty great beer and one of my favorite lagers ever made. I wish it wasn't just a seasonal, as this would be a fantastic beer to drink year-round."

"o: easy drinkin, smooth taste, really solid beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Yet another winner from Surly. Incredibly flavourful and delicious. This is a session ale, and everything about it screams easy drinking deliciousness."
"O: The dry-hopping and rye helped lighten up the maltiness that is usually found in Oktoberfest beers. I found this to be very enjoyable and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is also great. Medium bodied with an excellent carbonation level. Smooth, buttery and well balanced with a clean almost crisp finish. Great drinkability on this one, wish I could have been drinking this already all during the fall. Great beer, great representation of the style. Has some unique characteristics while still maintaining the traditional integrity of the style. Well done Surly and thanks to Noah for sending this one out."
"O: This tastes fine, but instead of choosing a hoppy beer or a traditional festbier they made a hybrid that seems sort of middling to me."
""
"O: Not bad. Very mild and not overpowering."
"O: I really enjoyed this hoppier take on an Octoberfest with the addition of rye - it is just enough different than others in the style but in a positive fashion. Easy to drink and sessionable."
""
"O- This was a very good Oktoberfest beer, definitely better then most that I've tried. The style isn't my favorite, but I definitely enjoyed this beer. This beer definitely makes for a nice autumn beer. I would drink it again and I definitely recommend it if you like the style."
"overall: not your average oktober, much darker/bigger and hoppier, and i give surly credit for that. its got less of that classic clean, spicy taste and more of a hoppy kick than i expected. most importantly, surly's finger print is all over this one. its got that same finish i get from a furious, cynic, bitter brewer that we've all grown to love. i'd still take a furious or abrasive over this one any day, but a very good oktober from a top notch brewery"
""
""
"O- first of all I didn't know this was a rye beer, thought it was just another Oktoberfest beer. Boy was I wrong. Very good rye beer with big citrus notes and nice amount of bitterness."
""
""
""
"O-I've really been enjoying this beer on cool fall days the past couple years. Like all Surly beers this beer will wake up your taste buds. I haven't been a huge fan of rye beers but this one is quite nice. I really like the combination of rye flavor and the generous flavor of Sterling hops. Biggest defect is the alcohol bite in the finish."
""
"O: Not a traditional Oktoberfest style beer, but one that's perfect for fall days."
"O - I expected more since it was a Surly beer but once I realized what this beer was and is supposed to be I appreciated it much more. A great traditional done very well."
"O- A very good beer, drinkability is through the roof, this is the kind of beer you can pound several of without much trouble."
""

"A shout out to cpolking for the hook up with this beer. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a bronze color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is hoppy, some pine. Taste is smooth, hops, rye, flavorful and so easy drinking. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall another winner from Surly, damn I wish they would distribute here."
""
"Final Thoughts: I knew going into this one that it wouldn't be the standard Octoberfest. Instead, Surly has taken the style in a whole new direction (by adding hops, lots of hops. Oh, and rye) and the result is a great beer. If you are able to get your hands on it, you won't be disappointed."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I really enjoyed this beer and feel that while it's in line with the myriad of other fall seasonal beers, it breaks out of the mold a little. I would buy it again."
"Overall: A very satisfying beer. A nice blend of ryes. It's very drinkable. I certainly would like another one."

""
""
"Keeping with just about every Surly beer I've had, this one is subtle, easy drinking, and highly sessionable. Great with just about any meal. Really wish I had easier access to this one."

"Big thanks goes out to MBrausen for sending this one my way so I could tick it and caSSino for handing it off to me in-person! Thanks guys! Served from can into a Samuel Smith imperial pint. Poured a deep red-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, spices, bread, fruit, and subtle bitter hops. The flavor was of sweet malt, spices, bread, subtle fruit, and bitter hops. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall was a pretty good brew. All of the components you would expect from this style were there with the spiciness, but it also threw in a Marzen twist to keep you guessing on top of that. A really well done brew that I can't believe I had never tried before. I suggest you try it as well!"

"Overall: This is my favorite Oktoberfest to date. It has a very clean taste which was outstanding. Definitely going to grab some more nect year. Cheers!"
""
"O- Another beer to make me proud to say I'm from Minnesota."
"O: Pretty decent beer. Again Lagers aren't my style but this one has nothing wrong with it."
"O: unlike any other oktoberfest I've had. Honestly, its so fresh & clean, if u didn't tell me it was an Oktoberfest style, I wouldn't believe it. Really well done. Ill drink it again & again"
"Another fine brew by Surly."

"overall a solid Oktoberfest beer that I'm glad I grabbed a 4-pk of and look forward to enjoying again!"

"O= Overall, I thought this was a great beer in this style. I really enjoyed this beer it's a above average beer for this style (Rye/Octoberfest). I would diffently try this one again and it's a perfect fall beer."

"Canned 14SEP11 A: Rusty orange with a transient sheet of off-white foam which quickly founders to a broken surface of the same with strengthened rim bubbles. Excellent clarity. No lace. (3) S: Hops up front, nice earthy and herbal hops. Then some sweetness from the munich style malt additions. To be honest the hops dominate and while I like the nose, itâ€™s far from an appropriate marzen. (3.5) T: Sweet bready and slightly oxidized malts come together in a true oktoberfest profile. Again, the hops are strong and belie the tradition of marzens. Nice beer, not a good marzen (3.5) M: Thin with hi carb, semi dry finish and some nice lasting aromatics. (3.5) O: Drinkable beer, if Iâ€™m in the mood for a marzen, I will not reach for this one, but if I wanted a unique amber lager with hops, here is where I would go to. (3.5)"
"O- A great representation of the style. Wish i had more of this beer. Not a big style of lagers, but this is delicious."
"I appreciate a different take on the Oktoberfest style and there's nothing off about this one, but the flavors really aren't complimentary. Doesn't have enough of the good meladoinin malt for an Oktoberfest or to support the rye spiciness."
"O: B in this one. I like more hops and I have never loved the seasonal lags but this is much better than most."
"This beer throws style out the window and the result is pure win. It's a lager that tastes like some kind of hoppy rye ale? It's extremely drinkable, and I could drink this year round. I'll have to remember to get more next fall."
"O: Overall I really like this beer however it doesn't hold true to style. Either way its a good beer and I am glad I got to try it. 4.0"
"A Fest beer I can get behind. Rye and malts mix well with the single hop profile. Tasty."
"A very tasty and drinkable beer."
"O- This brew just screams fall, harvest season, and drink me with a beef/pumpkin/barley stew! In fact... I think I'm gonna do that tomorrow night for Halloween!"
"O - I don't know that I would drink this in place of my favorite Oktoberfests, but it is a very enjoyable and unique lager that I would definitely get again."
"D: This beer threw me off in a couple of places, but it was still pretty pleasant and tasty. Â Not at all what expected, and somewhat out of style in my opinion, but it's good for what it is and I'm glad to have had the opportunity to try it. Â I think I'll stick to other marzen lagers next year, although I can't get this regularly, so it doesn't really matter ..."
"O: overall, a decent beer. Not very complex, but still enjoyable."
"Upon opening the can I instantly get a whiff of dry hopped goodness, perfect! It pours a light bodied and creamy light hazelnut brown in color, very translucent, with a creamy beige head that laces my snifter. It looks like a creamy marzen. The aromas are very hoppy, featuring the traditional Surly hop profile, despite being dry hopped I get more fresh wet hops from the nose with light German malt and an interesting yeast strain. The flavors are a near perfect mix of fresh hops and malt. The rye is subtle and it does drink like a light lager. The hop presence is really nice. It is VERY complex period, and especially for the style. Like most of their beers, this one was built for a can and has a perfect mouthfeel. It is overly sessionable and really surprised me. The complexity is unheard of for the style. I'd say this is a must try, and a nice upgrade over traditional ""festbier"" that you'll find this time of year."
"Big thanks to my boy troopscoop for the can. Great artwork and color on this can. Pours with brilliant clarity. great lace and retention. aroma of yeasty malts, a bit of fruity esters, and some earthy and slightly citrusy hops. taste is light and clean. a bit of light malts, rye, caramel, with a touch of carbonation. not really complex or bitter, but still an easy drinking brew."
"The mouth is decent but a touch over carbonated. It is an easy beer to pair with food."
"O: Good beer that I enjoyed drinking, doesn't live u to the hype like other Surly offers."
"On the other hand, I feel like tempering my review a little, just to keep it honest. On the other hand, oh hell, maybe I should just join the crowd and quit giving Surly a hard time? Nah."
"Overall this is one of the top 5 lagers I have ever had by far. The malt profile is so complex with the spicy rye and the toasted breadiness but the the ample hop profile and dry hopping also plays a huge part in making this a great beer. Once again Surly knows how to make a great beer; really drinkable, balanced and sessionable during this fall season but could be consumed year round although you would want it fresh to appreciate the fresh dry hop aromas and flavors. Highly recommended and should be on every beer geeks ""bucket list"" in my opinion; glad I was able to check it off."
"O - *Very* happy to try this at last. Another fantastic brew from Surly. Not enough lagers in the craft brew world, so it's always nice to come across a fabulous example. Cheers to Todd and Omar,"
"It is a great beer, but I was surprised that Surly didn't give it a heavier rye taste."
"Overall: Another Surly winner. It's a unique take on the fall seasonal and adds just enough rye to let you know what you're dealing with. Definitely a top fall seasonal for those who can get it."
"Overall - Solid beer, if a bit unconventional for an Oktoberfest style. I think this would fly better as a marzen with a rye kick rather than a rye beer on a marzen base."
"Overall a well done o-fest/rye beer...however you want to classify it. I'd say it leans a little more toward marzen as the rye is not as prevalent as in say, a Red's Rye or Cane & Ebel but definitely noticeable. Gives this lager a nice complexity to it, along with the the nice hoppiness it has. Will definitely seek this beer out again and would honestly probably buy a case of it if I lived in Minnesota."
"Overall: An interesting take on an Octoberfest beer. Well balanced and very easy to drink. I would have it again."
"Overall this is one tasty mug o brew. Digging the rich maltiness, dangerous level f drinkability, and great balance from the hops. Surly does it again!"
"Overall is higher because aside from the smell and taste, I consider this to be more than just ""good"" overall when it comes to drinkability."
"O- Solid for the style and although the hoppy aroma teased my expectations for the flavor, it's a decent beer and worth a try."
"O - This is a very good version of an Oktoberfest beer with added rye and hops this is a good example of style blending resulting in a damn good tasting beer that I could drink a number of worth getting your hands on to try"
"Serving type: can"
"O: This beer is fantastic! Plain and simple. You won't be disappointed with this brew."
"O - This is a very fine Fest beer."
"Very nice offering for the fall. Actually, this is actually my favorite seasonal for the fall. Just outstanding and a joy to drink. Thanks for the want Andy!"
"Overall: I always look forward to this brew during the begining of fall. I have been meaning to do a review for many-a-years. When I took the first sip of a Surlyfest a little while back I knew it was an A beer. Solid work."
"Overall- a great alternative to the traditional Marzen. Drinkability is off the charts and if I were drinking this on tap, my wallet would not like me. Perfect for the fall season and one that I will look forward to each year."
"O- A fascinating idea of a hoppy rye octoberfest. The octoberfest aspect gets slightly lost in the mix. That's ok, it's a tasty beer."
"O- I'm feeling fall every time I crack a can of this. A great beer for the crispness of fall. Extra points for the most aesthically pleasing label on the block."
"Overall this is a great seasonal offering from Surly. Different from most of their lineup, but in a good way. I would highly recommend this beer to any BA, regardless of style preference. Lucky are we who can find fresh Surly. Cheers!"
"Overall: A very good take on a rye beer. A very nice balance of sweetness, spice, and bitterness. Complex and tasty."
"Served from a can into a pint glass... not a stein unfortunately. Lagers are obviously clear, this being a good example. Orange, tan, brown, rust color with a lighter head. Lacing does not last long on the inside of the glass. Very nice smell. Mellow, citrusy, and richness. I tasted the single hop, Sterling, evenly throughout with rich maltiness that has a bite to it (the rye). Leaves a good impression, slightly different from the majority of oktoberfest beers which isn't a bad thing. Thanks for the great one, Todd! (Head Brewmaster @ Surly)."
"Freshly brewed. A nice coppery pour with a finger of rich tawny foam that recedes slowly leaving heavy lacing. Rye grain and mostly citric hop on a rather faint nose. Taste has an initial impression of malt/grain, light sweetness and spicy rye characteristics, which are swept away with a light washing of citric hop that leaves only a trace of malt/grain for mostly clean, dryish, slightly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy and very nicely carbonated for the style, imparting a creamy yet crisp backbone. Overall, a nice hopped-up twist on the Oktoberfest style."
"I like this beer a lot more than I thought I would. Despite the smell and flavors being dominated by grains, it has layers of depth that really impress me. Surly delivers again!"
"The look of the beer is fall. Gets me ready for the shennanigans to be had. Outside under a big tent. Lederhosen, sweet green hats, great lookin bar wenches wearing scantily clads and serving giant steins of beer. PROST! Gearing up my moves for the dance floor when the polka outfit plays my jam. Sing it with me ""Roll out the barrel. We'll have a barrel of fun."" Practicing my steady hand at hammerschlagen. Eating brats, pretzels and mustard. Solving world issues around a table with a 1 liter mug in my hand. Giving that sweet lookin gal a smooch with my handlebar moustached lips. Ahh Oktoberfest. Best time of the year."
"Enjoy!"
"o - overall, really really dig this one. i'd like to try it a bit fresher (my bad that i sat on it for such a long time)...but i do really enjoy it with the heavy malt bill and missing hops. the sweetness is great...almost barleywine like crossed with a marzen."
"Thanks to surlytwins fan for the opportunity!"
"Though the carbonation was a slight issue with this one, it's won't be keeping me away, as I can't wait to quaff more of Surly's suds."
"Mouthfeel and drinkabilty are good. Will update this review when I get a chance to try another within a month or two of canning."
"D: Quite drinkable. The rye leaves a lingering flavor, and not in a bad way. Good but not an everyday one for me. A great seasonable beer for autumn."
"There's exceptional carbonation the whole way through, and its light to medium body is an easy drinker. The bitter bite with sweetness that hangs at the end isn't totally my thing, but it definitely is part of the season. Cheers to Surly for making another one they can hang their hat on."
"D - For me this was just a mediocre offering from a fantastic brewery. I love all things Surly but this one just didn't live up. Nothing against Surly, this one was just ok."
"D: Good beer."
"D: An interesting, complex, and bready brew; really good but quite different"
"This is a tough one for me to grade. For the style, I don't think it hits the mark. Too much like a malty IPA. Not sure if that was what they were trying to do with a Rye, but it didn't work."
"D - Decently high. I liked this one but the over the top chewiness got to me over the course of time. It was still very nice. I can't wait to try some of the other surly beers."
"D - Easy to drink beer for sure. Nothing crazy but just solid!"
"Very hoppy for the style with a bitter piney hop blast up front which is balanced by a nice caramel malt backbone. I'm also picking up slight hints of rye. The hops give off hints f pineapple, grapefruit and lemon peel. There is a slight lactic creaminess that alng with the malt prfile make this beer extremely smoky and quaffable."
"At least I'm having this in some partially appropriate glassware. It pours a hazy sunset amber topped by a finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises mandarin oranges, peach, light cinnamon, wheat, and black pepper. The taste holds notes of light toffee, mint, black pepper, sourdough, and light pine. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish. Overall, a nice brew, though I think the rye goes somewhat overlooked/underused. Beyond that, I could see enjoying this on a regular basis in the fall. You lucky Minnesotans..."
"This beer pours a nice amber color with an off-white finger of foam on the surface. The smell is surprisingly nice on the hop aromatics. There is a malt backer in the aroma along with some sourness from the rye itself. The taste is a slightly bitter sour rye flavor along with some spice that would be associated with it as well. It isn't overwhelming in those regards, there is also flavors of some nice earthy hops. I'm never really a fan of any bitterness, but this beer isn't bad at all. It's perhaps one of the most drinkable rye beers that I've ever had. I could drink this all day."
"D: I guess this is in the Marzen style, even though BA catalogues it as a rye beer. Very solid brew."
"Cheers!"
"The most interesting and notable aroma here for me is this leafy tea character. It's not quite herbal but has a certain leafiness to it. Breadiness here as well. This tea flavor carries through to the taste, with some dried leaves, malty, herbal combination. Though the finish. Low-medium bodied, low carbonation. Very drinkable. Thanks!"
"D- This is a very good beer. Very easy to drink as I sit here on a cool Saturday watching football."
"I don't usually enjoy lagers. Tasting this beer is dry, yet smooth. Sweet sugary yeasty bread, pale malts and well-balanced bittering hops make this an amazing beer combo for eating finger foods, watching movies, or just relaxing outside in a lawnchair. The body is thin, the carbonation is light and smooth, and this beer does NOT destroy the palate at all, so perfect score for mouthfeel. At the end of the glass, nutmeg comes out of nowhere in the aroma, making this beer wonderful down to the last taste."
"Flavor has a rye-like, spicy malt flavor. Very little toast/caramel for an Oktoberfest inspired beer. Hop flavors are back with a strong, tea-like flavor. There is a slight tea-like slickness on the mouthfeel, possibly from some diacetyl. This is a unique beer with some interesting aspects to it, but it doesn't have the drinkability of a fest beer, yet isn't exciting enough as an odball beer."
"d - A decent rye beer but nothing really jumped out at me in the smell or taste. While not a bad beer, it's probably the worst beer I've had from Surly so far. An easy to drink beer but I would not seek it out again in a trade; I'd much prefer their other offerings."
"Cheers.."
"D: A rare miss for Surly and this one is way off the mark. I know they're trying to put a different spin on the Oktoberfest, but this just didn't work at all."
"The one pint can disappeared all too quickly. This might be my new favorite o-fest. I'll be looking for this again next year! Fantastic beer."
"Overall this is not what I was expecting out of a so-called Oktoberfest beer, but it was a very satisfying surprise."
"First the Crack & Glug, then the fireworks! Two foamy fingers' worth of tawny head with moderate retention. Color was a deep orangish-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was an interesting admixture of grassy hops and a mild malty sweetness. This was more up my alley, although it was not a traditional O'fest. Mouthfeel was medium with a light sweetness on the tongue accompanied by a grassiness. in the mouth. Dang, I wish that they had not mentioned pretzels because I could really go for one right about now. Finish was initially dry, but then the cool minty blast of rye kicked in and I was reminded of Sopor, the first person to turn me on to rye. Whew! Smoooth! More, please."
"D: A decent offering. I am glad for the opportunity to sample this beer. While I enjoyed my serving, I wouldn't seek this out."
"This beer presents the spicy and earthy characteristics of rye more than any other beers I've had that include this grain. This packs a lot of flavor and seems very well made all the way around. Darn, I wish I could get Surly at my store."
"Hops become very strong after a few sips and leave an intense aftertaste. Whatever that hop is, it's a killer. A different beer for those who like unusual flavors, and worth a taste. The last half of the pint is the problem."
"My hypothesis was correct. Taste brings forth a spicy bread with a complimentary hop character. I'm diggin this brew. Would go great with a fresh Philly soft pretzel. Not what I expected at all in an Oktoberfest, but in a good way."
"D - No alcohol presence at all, and not palate destroying. This has all the enjoyablity of an adjunct lager, with 10x more taste. Awesome beer, just wish it had more hops in the front."
"Ah well."
"I seek this beer out every year, but I don't buy more than a 4 pack or maybe two. That is enough to hold me over until next year."
"Beer is medium to light in body and has a nice spiciness to it. It finishes cleanly not too dry. There is a forward grain flavor that I assume is the rye. The finish is very nice, very drinkable. I would have this again."
"Drinkability is great. Despite the malt, with the balance of the rye this beer goes down amazingly smooth. Could definitely have a few."
"D - Good. Clean, dry, refreshing and full flavored. This is a pretty good beer, especially suited for afternoon quaffing on the patio."
"True to form, this Surly is meant to be savored."
"D - I'd rather drink this all night than any other ""fest"". Very good for a rye, also."
"Another great Surly offering."
"Very drinkable, probably the best Oktoberfest style beer out there."
"Interesting take on the Oktoberfest beer, and I like it. More quality from Surly."
"Definitely a Surly-caliber beer and one that I much prefer to most of the Marzen style Octoberfests that are the standard. Easy drinker."
"D: Here's to Surly! This is quite different from the typical fest beer. So good they could offer it year-round. I'm convinced of it!"
"Surlyfest, it's like a party in my mouth and everyone is invited."
"Very drinkable. In fact, perhaps more drinkable on its own (without food pairings) than traditional fest beers. I wish this had lower alcohol, which would make it an excellent session beer."
"D: I could drink this as a mainstay. Very sessionable. I wish Surly would make this year round."
"D: I think the drinkability is good, on the second one the flavor became a little blasÃ© to me. Almost like there was nothing more to discover/savor..."
"D: Just ok, not my favorite Surly, or Oktoberfest (although it is hard to compare because of the rye). Nice for something a little different."
"Overall this is one of my favorite Surly beers. I've had all the year round, seasonal and special releases, but this is fantastic."
"The taste has definite rye with some malt balance. Wants to almost jump to your tongue and palate as soon as you raise the glass. The mouthfeel is full and pretty foamy with a good, moderately easy to drink flavor."
"Can. Pours a nice amber red color with a nice 1 finger off whtie head. Very clean and crisp looking. Very slight hop in the nose but mostly the aroma is dominated by malty grain, wheat, and rye type aromas. SLight bitter taste with a nice balanc of malt flavors. Very reminiscent of german beers with a nice american twist. Nice lace left on the glass. Medium outhfeel. Very sessionable."
"*Not sure if this was 5.5% last year, but this year its 6.2% according to the pamphlet from Surlyfest*"
"O: Surly never disappoints."
"Not a bad interpretation of Oktoberfest."
"D: Very drinkable, though not something I would want to mix with other beers, but rather just drink this for a night."
"nice flavor profile going on here, but a really thick malt bill makes me want only one or two."
"Overall a great twist on the Marzen style. Very flavorful and tasty. I would love to get this fresh on a cool October afternoon."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish color with a small white head. In the aroma, maltiness of rye and a bit sweet. As for the taste, malty and sweet with a dry rye like end. A smooth and light bodied mouthfeel, with a dry malty aftertaste. A nice rye presence in an Oktoberfest. Quite nice!"
"D: not my favorite Surly beer by any means, but fairly tasty and easy drinking."
"thanks to freshmanpour77 for this gracious throw-in!"
"M/D - A touch thin and very dry. Easy drinking. Excellent rye profle makes for an excellent rye beer."
"Note - Surly hosts ""Surly Fest"" each September. Your paid entry gets you four Surly beers, a .5L SurlyFest stein and lots of live music and fun at the brewery. Man, I wish I lived a LOT closer..."
"3.5 D: I'd like to try this again fresh, but as it stands, it's nothing more than average."
"M/D: Medium body lingers on the tongue for awhile, but is very easy to drink. Excellent for a cool summer or fall night, but also is great as a change-up beer in the winter."
"D: Not my favorite style, but very drinkable."
"easy to drink. very creamy. overall a very nice beer."
"D: I like some of the other Surly's but this one is too hoppy for a rye."
"D - this beer has session written all over it. i wish we could get this stuff here in Denver. With the cans and all this would be a perfect camping/fishing/tailgate/BBQ beer."
"A nice twist on the traditional Marzen style with some added rye for a nice touch. Not quite as flavorful as I'd hoped, but enjoyable nonetheless."
"Drinkability: Another top notch Surly beer. A tasty Marzen with a nice rye bite to it. An interesting mix that Surly pulled off very nicely."
"Reviewed on 10/25/2009. Can thanks to j120601. The beer pours a clear orange-brown with a very small white head. Aroma of sweet malt, light nutty malt. Flavor is much of the same--sweet, nutty caramel malt, some toffee too. Pretty good for an oktoberfest."
"M/D - Another great brew from Surly, medium bodied, very smooth tasting with a little bite at the finish. Too bad a seasonal brew so enjoy a couple times over when you could. A for sure brew to be had by the Surly lovers out there."
"After having a few Surly products now this is one of my favorites as I can't really compare it to much else I have had. Definitely something I would buy again if I could."
"D- Would be great to take camping, tailgating, or to a cookout."
"Got to try a can of this courtesy of a friend from Minnesota. The colour was golden straw with a thick head. The aroma was nearly nonexistent. I mean, maybe there were some hops and malt there, but I couldn't detect any. On the palate, there were faint hops and faint malt but generally it seemed quite watery. I guess I expected more form the folks who make the Darkness!"
" Overall this beer is an interesting take on the Oktoberfest style. I like that it is a rye and appreciate that it isn't over-hopped."
"D: IS it sessionable yes, but I probably wouldnt want more than two in a sitting."
"solid offering from surly, a wonderful take on the marzen style."
"D - Good, full flavored lager perfect for a fall afternoon. Good and crisp. At 5.5% this is easy to have a few and keep on going. Good beer to have after raking leaves or other outdoor fall chores. Think I'll have another."
"Overall, a good drinkable beer with a nice amount of flavor. I really want more for the fall season as it is a great seasonal and when the weather is right, I would love to have this around."
"Pours a dark amber body with a thin white head that soon disappears. Aroma is of toasted caramel and peat. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a spicy rye flavor. There's a medium hop bitterness that is discernable as well, but the rye is what shines through. Decent drinkability, but sometimes it depends on the setting with rye beers."
"D: Very high! Gimme another and I'm glad I bought 2 4-packs."
"D: This was a very nice beer. I must say that this years batch is definitely my favorite so far. I didn't really care for more than one of these at a time in years past due to the overpowering hoppiness. This year the hops are perfect. The malts rule the beer and the rye makes it much more interesting than other Oktoberfest beers. I would love to drink this in a 1L stein while listening to polka music and eating sausage. I hope to make it to SurlyFest next year so I can do so. I'll be picking up another 4-pack of this before it sells out for sure. Another great Surly brew."
"D: A very good beer for the season. Surly does it again. Takes a style and turns it into something truly unique, and good at the same time. Definitely a session brew for a cool Autumn night."
"Pours an amber color with a two finger head with poor retention. Smell is rye, hops, and sweet malt. The flavor matches the smell, and is sweeter than I expected. The malt is the star in this beer and really comes through nicely. Tastes of sweet malt in the beginning, followed by hops and rye at the end. Nice balance. There are not enough O's in smooth to describe this beer. Nice carbonation, and the drinkability is outstanding. If you get a chance to try SurlyFest, take it. This one is good."
"D= awesome. Yet another fabulous beer from surly. I wish they would fix the head a little but it still taste great. Delicious beer."
"D- Highly drinkable, very refreshing and leaves you wanting more. An excellent session beer."
"pours a nice light copper color with a quickly dissipating head the smell is rye and caramel toasted malts and some good hop profile the taste is very fresh this was delivered today and was almost sold out already its smooth and creamy with balanced hops and a great rye flavor ,,this one is real easy to drink and again surly pushes the envelope and creates a great brew to represent a style..but is it a marzen a rye a lager a rye lager or a brown? surly again does it in their style and does it great ..highly recommended"
"Drinkability is off the charts. Light while still maintaining some richness, low ABV and a taste that leaves you wanting more. I am glad I stocked up."
"Drinkability: Fantastic autumn beer. While the malts are somewhat reminiscent of a Marzen, the hops and rye clearly move it well beyond Marzen territory. That said, it beats any traditional Marzen by a wide margin."
"This years batch definitely lives up to the hype, this is some good stuff. Try it if you can, drink it if you've got it."
"It's decent, but nothing to get too excited about. Appearance is nice as all Surly's are, looks clean and well put together. Smell and taste are very similar- a decent amount of rye but also kinda woody and hoppy. Mouthfeel is medium with medium carbonation. Drinkability is ok."
"Had again 3 years later and it was fresh and it may have been tweaked. Got more toast, and hop aromas."
"A good lager easy to drink and I could easily put away a few of these in a sitting. I drink it again, if it was available local."
"D - Very drinkable (if only this wasn't my only one). I likey."
"D - Drinkability is quite good with the SurlyFest. Several things about this beer stand out as very good and make me want to hunt is down agian (no matter what the trouble). Very well balanced flavors and aroma. Bitterness level is just about perfect for this beer. Couple that with the low alcohol and...we have a winner. Very happy I got the chance to sample this."
"I forget who sent this one to me, but thanks! A 16 ounce can pulled from the back of my DBF and poured into my nonic pint glass. A rather aggressive pour unveils a hazed rich apricot colored brew with about three fingers of creamy, fluffy light ecru foam. A stellar pour! Smells and tastes of bitter-sweet, spicy, caramelized malts, biscuits, and an awesome citrus tinged hop presence (lemon and grapefruit). A memorable lager to say the least! Medium in both body and carbonation. Try this one if you can."
"It's a good beer with a good lager flavor, but it's not as complex as I was somehow expecting. I would prefer a good German lager with a crisper bite."
"Drinkability: Entirely too easy to put this one down. It's a little on the high end for a pure session beer, but I'd have no problem putting down a few. It's too bad I don't normally have access to Surly's beers, because I'd be excited to try more of them. If I had the opportunity I'd have this again."
"Overall: Thanks go to Scoobydank for being so kind as to hook me up with this one. This beer was great. I would definately drink it again."
"D: The cereal grain base gives the beer a bready base that is pleasant to sip on. I'd like a little more rye to peak through though."
"Wow. I like Rye beers, and this one is definitely one of the more enjoyable examples I've had the pleasure of trying. Goes down smooth, and this one disappeared before I realized what was happening. If it was readily available to me, it would easily be one of my go-to brews."
"D - A very tasty take on the style."
"Another great Surly beer! Burnt orange color with nice head. Smell is of hops and orange peel with malt. The taste is of roasted malt with a slight backing of hops and that distinct rye flavor that I've come to love. Mouthfeel is good, pretty smooth. This is a very drinkable beer. I could drink several of these at once. This beer has great balance and flavor. I could drink these year round. Too bad it's only a seasonal."
"16oz can thanks to stopbarking, nice. Dark orange-brown, good head and lacing, looks nice. The smell is really cool, rye, hops, fruit. The taste is fruity and pretty good as well and I don't know what style this is. I don't think I've had an average surly beer yet, all good."
"Drinkability: Hits all the right notes, though with a few missteps. Alcohol's not an issue at all, and the mouthfeel and backing aromas/flavors are very nice - I just think the can may have been a little off. Regardless, there's a good beer, so give it a shot."
"I got this can from JohnBierman as an extra, very appreciated and I'm so happy to have another Surly beer to try. This is difficult to rate against any given style, a dry-hopped rye helles lager. The beer is copper colored and a little hazy, with a thick rocky 3-finger foam that recedes into a thin wet frothy film. The first smell that hits me is rye spice, followed by bready and malty ""helles lager"" aromas straight outta Munchen. Exceptional, and the taste is even better if only because helles lagers seem stronger in flavor than aroma (at least to me). Delicious biscuit, malty sweet, with distinctive rye bite and a sharp after-taste that lingers. The body is creamy and filling, this is as drinkable as any beer I've had before. An instant classic, this beer is unique and needs to exist, a near perfect beverage."
"Mouthfeel is yeasty, medium bodied, and spicy."
"Thanks again, this and Furious make me ache that Surly isn't available as wide as Jersey."
"This beer was included as an extra in a trade with DBhog. Since I did not have a stein on hand, as the label suggested, I just decided to put it in a Duvel glass instead. Color is a hazy dark orange, with a half finger of white head. Aroma has some dry grainy husks, bit of caramel sweetness, traces of fruit here and there, slightly musty as well. Taste brings on more of the same, but more subdued overall. Taste also clues you in that this is a Lager and not an Ale in the way that all of its conponents intermingle. Good carbonation, and a pleasant hoppy bitterness lend itself well to the drinkability of this beer. At the same time, one is good enough for me. A good beer from Surly, and much more refined than their other brews. Again, like all of their other products, I wish I had access to them here. Thanks again to Bill for this one."
"M + D: Feel is alright... medium bodies, but the flavour doesn't go over with it very well. I have been fond of the other rye beer I have had, so I'd be willing to give it another go based on that, but I'm not too interested in getting another any time soon."
"D- This is a great collaboration of rye, hoppy, and o-fest. Great flavors and lager quaffability. Reminds me a little bit of great lakes Elliot Ness. Well done overall and something I would like to trade for next time it comes around."
"Pours a barely foggy and slightly orange hued amber. Nose is mild citrus tones and mild hop characteristics as well. Flavor has that rye bite, but it seems like it's blended with a fairly intense citrus and pine hop edge. Nice marriage. Feel has a fairly obvious carbonation that's full in the mouth. This is easy to drink, yes. But it still carries the bite you expect from a rye."
"M/D - Very nice balance of all of the above to make a very drinkable enjoyable brew. I'd love to get more of this."
"Nice orange, somewhat golden color. very clean looking. Tight creamy head on top. Very hoppy aroma for the style. Nice malty sweetness to it. A heavy blast of hops. Good balance between the 2 with a pleasant lingering bitterness. Very silky and creamy mouthfeel. All around a great drinking experience. My first from Surly and it lives up to the hype for sure."
"D: very nice fest beer with an American twist. solid brew. well worth getting. very creative by dry hopping an oktoberfest."
"drindability- i enjoyed this one very much it goes down way to easy. I could put down 4 or 5 of these."
"D- Very drinkable, for those who like more malts with their hops this is the one for you."
"ahhhh, I don't know.... Right now the overall score here is really good, but I can't go with it. I really like Surly stuff, but this isn't one a their best imho. So so head. no lace. Slightly hazy orangish amber color. Hoppy nose. Flavor picks up malt, a bit of roastiness. Helps make it more drinkable. Sort of an Oktoberfest. I guess. Finish is ok. I could drink a few more of these, but don't know if I'd go out of my way to do so."
"Overall, a really excellent beer, again, from Surly. Very drinkable and would be a good session beer. Get a good amount of hops without shredding your tongue or getting to be too much. Highly recommend. Will definitely seek out again."
"Overall a pretty tasty brew. A rye lager thing is a nice take on a style aside from marzen for the oktoberfest season. A great alternative when marzens get boring. The extra hop presence in here is pretty nice. Certainly one worth picking up. A good one for those seeking just a touch more flavor and body at the autumn barbeque. Good beer."
"Poured a medium and clear golden/orange color with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of earthiness, wet leaves, toffee, and bready. Tastes of caramel, toffee, some earthiness, and the same rye/breadiness. Lively body that has a dry finish."
"Thanks again to Deliriumfest for this extra goody."
"Slightly hazed light-orange pour into a SA beer drinking glass. Fluffy 2 fingers of near-white bubbly froth. Great lacing in the glass. Nutty aroma with a blast of citrus hops. Very bright flavor, orange hops very evident. Nutty, spicy, roasty malt body. Finishes very clean and hoppy. Don't let the German-esque can fool you...this one is a nice refreshing spin on a Marzen."
"Great session beer - I wish I had more of this a couple of months ago. Wait 'til next year isn't just for the Cubs! Drinks extremely well."
"Pours a dark coppery amber with a large fluffy white head. Head holds for a bit and leaves good lacing. The aroma is very spicy, loads of rye. Not very typical of an Ofest but interesting.. Very peppery and mildly sweet. Taste is much the same. Lots of peppery, very spicy, loads of rye. Pretty damn dry. Has a very earthy taste and feel. Body is medium to medium light with good carbonation."
"Pours a medium amber with a fluffy white head. As the head dissipates, light sticky lacing is left behind. The aroma is subtle if nothing else. Smells like a well balanced, slightly bready beer with a note of hops but not too overwhelming. I was expecting a Terrapin Rye Pale type taste and that may have clouded my judgement here. It did resemble Terrapin in the rye factor but the hops are a little more laid down which is totally fine. I was just expecting more of a sharpness to it. Not a bad beer in any sense. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Well done Surly."
"D: Very easy to drink - flavorful, good-looking, sessionable strength. Disappeared far too quickly. Another fine effort by Surly...is it too early to put in my order for a 4-pack next fall, Nick?"
"M&D - a fine brew, a nice sessionable canned beer, nice flavor, would be a nice wind down brew after some sort of manual labor, like a game of baseball or something, easy down and quite refreshing"
"Overall: OK"
"Pours a nice coppery/amber color, slight haze, foamy beige head fades quickly into a foamy layer on top of the beer, minimal lacing left behind. Lots of piney hops on the nose of this one, and a candy-like malty sweetness. I was thinking I might not really ""get"" the rye in this beer (having had precious few rye beers), but it's there in abundance. Really spicy kick, peppery, and nicely balanced with the sweet malt flavor. Medium-bodied, some faint, yet long-lasting lingering bitter flavors. This is excellent, and that ABV makes this very session-worthy. My first Surly beer, very impressive!"
"certainly a unique concoction...ale-like character but a lager type feel. fruity, spicy and hoppy...and still a lager. surly again breaks all the rules to bring us an extremely flavourful and festively drinkable hopped up fall-type beer. recommended."
"I like it, but its definitely got some rye kick to it. a tasty maltiness to it and a definitely nice rye and spice charachter from the yeast. however i do have a slight problem with this beer. however tasty the individual characteristics are it doesnt come together all that great and it gives a 'lemonade-y' type flavor as a part of the combination. its brief between the rye spiciness at the start and the yeast character at the lingering finish. It hurts the drinkability alot."
"When it comes to brewing low-ish alcohol beers that have huge flavor, Surly cannot be topped. Best lager ever? It's pretty damn close. Stupidly drinkable."
"Great drinkability, this works far better as a rye beer than an Oktoberfest to be sure"
"D-Drinkability is good. It 's unusual to drink an Oktoberfest-seasonal beer that is so hop-centric, but refreshingly so. Will certainly wait for this again next year."
"Certainly different and pretty good for an Oktoberfest type beer, but I didn't really enjoy it as much as the traditional type. Worth a try for it's uniqueness, but not my first choice."
"D= Though this was certainly a non-traditional festbier, it had a lot going for it. I really appreciated the hop flavors and the addition of the rye. Sort of combined the clean flavors of a lager with some of the best attributes of an ale. Delicious!"
"Overall a great interpretation of the Ofest style. Surly comes through again."
"Even though this beer isn't really in the same league as most of their other outstanding offerings, it's still light years better than similar lagers. Actually, there aren't any similar lagers. SurlyFest is both unique *and* delicious. Talk about a killer combination."
"Drinkability - I wish I lived in Minnesota."
"D - Totally."
"This is definitely not what I expected from a rye beer (or a fest beer for that matter). Nonetheless, it's a great beer and one that I highly recommend. Thanks again for the cans Brian!"
"Zum wohl!"
"Overall a pretty wild Oktoberfest , I only wish Surly was in Ohio."
"The innovation I continue to see coming out of this small Minneapolis brewery never ceases to amaze me..these Surly folks are incredible...keep 'em coming!"
"Touch more rye twang in the fresh stuff, maybe some honey-ish notions, but both have a considerable talcum drying effect leading the way to zesty juiciness. A feels more grainier then B, but both powder on the hops. Not an intense bitterness, but very constant after the brief unfamiliarity in the beginning. All left turns once you get past the intersection of rye & malt. My tongue is a bit numb to boot."
"Pretty drinkable, another nice Surly brew."
"D - Near excellence in this beer... certainly is not a traditional oktoberfest but we certainly are not in germany. An excellent americanized take on the style. The flavors are restrained however are well crafted, this beer truely embodies balance."
"Not familiar with the style, but I'm sure Surly thoroughly disregarded it. Which is exactly why I enjoy drinking their beer."
"Cheers."
"D - This is an excellent brew. Typical of Surly, it is completely unique."
"This is a unique beer. Worth a try. The little angry german guy on the can is the best anyway."
"Another outstanding beer from Surly. Not sure this beer qualifies as a marzen, but if so, it is the best American made version I've had this season. Another very good beer from Surly."
"Smell has a wonderful hoppy, malt, sweetness. The taste is even better. Rye flavor comes through well. Outstanding flavors and balance. Creamy mouthfeel. A hint of bitterness in the finish but not the dryness I expected/feared. It is a filling beer so I couldn't have had more than one in a sitting even if I wanted too."
"Surlyfest 2008 vintage. Appearance is mostly clear amber-orange with a frothy off-white head. Good lacing. Aroma has some citrus hops and bready malt, neither too strong, with the hops dominating. Initially, the flavors had me scratching my head for sometime because I thought I was drinking an Americanized Oktoberfest so I was relieved to see the heading here as a rye beer. I tasted restrained citrus hop flavor with the bready malt but the malt flavors danced on my tounge for only a moment and was whisked away in a fairly dry finish, which is explained by the rye malt and normally tends to be a palate cleanser when added to beer leaving a pretty dry finish. Mouthfeel was right in the middle making this beer very drinkable. This is unlike any beer I've tried before because it does remind you of Oktoberfest but you've got interesting twists with the American hops and rye malt. Oh, and of course it's absolutely delicious."
"Notes: If I were to review it as a marzen, it'd do very poorly. It has none of the characteristics I expect from one. Yes, you gotta drink outside the box but there's a reason I like my marzens and this beer does not deliver on that front. Also, criticizing this beer for being hoppier than most rye beers is pointless, 'cos it delivers what's advertised on the can and that _is_ this beer's USP"
"Overall I'm very impressed with my foray into Surly Brewing thanks to maximum12. I look forward to snagging any more of their brews any chance I get."
"Overall I thought this was seimply excellent. By far the best fest I have had this year so far. SImply amazingly sessionable and just really a superb beer all around. Surly really is one of the best and this just goes to show it!"
"oh my god was this good or maybe the whole rye kick i have been on but yes alass this is the beer that i rememberd from last year super hoppy nose just like all surly beers mmm can smell it now good brownish red color then to the taste mmm mmm delicious with the rye bite and the dryness of the rest man is it nice to live in MN now i could easily drink this every night but then i am on kind of a rye kick so that might not last"
"Drinkability: I still can't get over that this is a lager; it is so fruity and lacks that lager twang"
"Eminently quaffable. And I ask, where are the other low-ABV, session beers of the world? I've had a couple of excellent ones lately (Bitter Brewer, Leatherlips, Lost Sailor) but they're exceptions rather than the norm. I'd love to see some more tasty, complex, non-run-o'-the-mill beers that I can drink & still drive home, brewers! I'll hoist this as another example. Thanks guys!"
"The color is a dark wheat color, of autumn leaves, this beer just smacks of fall across the board. Aroma is breathtaking. Floral, malty (love the rye), hoppy, sweet-smelling, bitter-smelling all at the same time. Extremely inviting. Sunny rye flavor, with a nice malt sweetness. Nice amounts of hops as wlel in the taste. Though not as evident as they were in the aroma floral notes come through here nicely Medium-bodied and somewhat robustly creamy as well. At the same time is is extraordinarily smooth and not at all too weighty. An autumn delight."
"I've been craving this one for 9 months. Better stock up for the release next year!"
"D- I could toss these back no problem... and I probably will. A unique twist on the fest beers, and really nice instead of the same malty fests that we all know."
"Two inches of creamy light tan head that turn rocky and leaves lots of lace as it slowly fades. Body is an attractive honey dark amber. Nose is more on the hoppy side than I was expecting from the style. It includes a grassy malty backround with some green tea notes. Enters the mouth with destinct lengthy tones of rye and minersl based hops. The slightly rustic bitterness is smooth and welcome. Bold yet sesionable on the back of the tongue creating a very tasty mouthfeel. Super easy to drink all around. This would stack up well with many foods."
"Thanks again Eric."
"Poured amber with a good head that stuck around. Smelled super fresh and a bit grainy, with some spicy rye notes and subtle aromas of apple and pear. Tasted really frsh and clean as well, with some more rye graininess, a bit of vanilla, and a nice bitter finish. Mouthfeel is a bit thick for the style, but what a nice beer!"
"Bottle courtesy of Oakbluff: Poured a deep slightly hazy amber color ale with a thick foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of big semi-sweet malt rye with some dry hops. Taste is also dominated by big rich malt with the typical rye taste and some light dry hops at the end. Full body with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very refreshing beer but also very filling which mean I wouldn't have that much in a session. Also, I was expecting a hop bomb as this brewery is quite good at those but this is somewhat close to the original style."
"D-Oktoberfest not Fest...whatever! It is from Surly so you can only expect hops to be present! A cool interpretation, albiet blasphemous, of the style. Regardless, I really enjoy it and if was able would certainly have this every fall when it is released....nice. I can only imagine those hops a popping when this was 6 months younger!"
"Bottom line: This is a very tasty and drinkable Rye beer that I wouldn't hesitate to try again. Highly recommended!"
"Drinkability: Great drinkability. A bit on the sweet side, but easy to drink. Quite refreshing."
"Thanks goes out to Pitmonkey for the opportunity to sample this one."
"Pours a fairly hazy dark copper to amber color. One finger creamy off-white head that thins quickly leaving moderate lacing. The nose is understated, piney hops and yeast dominate but I get some floral esters as well. The taste comes as a bit of a surprise as it tastes more like an IPA than a lager, the rye is big up front and the finish is caramel malts and herbal hop flavors with a bit more pine though a little dusty and dry. Mouthfeel is nice, very smooth with a creamy carbonation that matches the head seen when poured. When very cold the feel is light and dry with some bite that moderates by the end of the glass. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and found it very drinkable, especially being a rye lager, this is probably due to the IPAish character that it seemed to have. Another solid and enjoyable beer from Surly."
"Pours a gorgeous autumnal amber color with a big sudsy lace inducing head. Smell is fresh and vibrant and wow, there are actually big fresh hops in this oktoberfest! Smell is hoppy, yet apples and sweet malt as well. Amazing for a style I usually find pretty average. Taste is nice, and mildish aside from a decent dose of grassy hopping and a nice bitterness level. Easy on the malt, and not a sweet or tart oktoberfest like I'm used to but more mildly sharp and zesty, perhaps from the Crystal Rye. A touch on the thin side palatewise, although the carbonation is spot on. A great, unique oktoberfest although I would actually like a hint more sweetness here. Big thanks for the can, Tyler!"
"Pours a deep amber/bronze color with lots of thick foamy off-white head, good retention and great lacing. Takes a while to pour it all in the stein with all that head pouring out of the can. Smells quite hoppy for an Oktoberfest with amarillo hops taking a commanding presence, as well as some honey, lemon, and caramel. Taste is also way different than I would expect, with rye jumping right out at you followed by some honey sweetness and a touch of lemon citrusiness. A nice sweet toffee backbone with a big ole piney hop finish. Medium in body, smooth and creamy with a dry finish. An unexpecting beer, but very drinkable and something I wouldn't mind drinking often in the Fall (or any other season)."
"Whether or not you call this an Oktoberfest Marzen, an interpretation of a Marzen, or just some strange abortion of the style, I think that is damn tasty for what it is and would keep this in my fridge full time during the fall months if I had access to it."
"Oh - is this drinkable...a wonderful hoppy, yet balanced brew. Very creative/unique!"
"Since I'm a confirmed Surly Nut. I love the twist that they've brought to an O-fest, certainly one of the best lagers I've ever had."
"This is the first beer from Surly that I have not enjoyed. I see others have, so drink up. But I will pass on this next fall. Unless they try a new hop, like Columbus or Palisade or Simcoe. My opinion is that Furious is 10 times better than this."
"Notes - Never thought I'd try a dry-hopped rye Octoberfest lager. Very creative stuff, and more importantly, quite good."
"Pours a nice hazy golden brown color, nice carbonation, very nice one-finger plus off-white creamy head, which leaves some nice sticky lacing throughout the drink. The nose is malty, hoppy, nice touch of the rye (bitter), and some caramel. The taste is malty/hoppy, nice touch of rye (bitterness), and some caramel. Medium body. This brew is pretty dry and bitter on the finish, very tasty though. Very drinkable, really like this one, highly recommended. Thanks Megan."
"D- Very easy to put back. Could be a very sessionable beer if it were more available."
"D:Best example of a Octoberfest beer that I can think of. Definitely a Surly twist using those hops to round out this beer. I wish more Octoberfest beers used hops like this."
"Drinkability is great, this is extremely sessionable. A very interesting and tasty take on the Oktoberfest / Rye Beer styles. I really like it, and would make this a staple in the fridge and ""in"" the outdoors if this was available here. Well worth a try."
"Pours a somewhat foggy rich copper hue with a generous two finger off-white head that has no intentions of leaving. Beautiful lacing left behind on the sides of the glass. Smell is of crisp rye up front with a subtle fresh citric hop scent. Nice caramel malt with a bit of a metallic aroma as well. Some dirty earth hops find their way in the nose too. Wow, what a perfect blend of hops and malt on the tongue. Sweet grapefruit hops balance with a creamy caramel malt. The crisp rye gives a fresh zing in the mouth. A spicy pepper sting finds it's way in the mouth as well. Aftertaste is an interesting combination of toasted nut and pine hops, niiice. Fluffy light to medium body with a full carbonation. This doesn't exactly fit into the ""traditional"" fest beers, but that's why I like it. Definitely a nice change of pace during the Oktoberfest season, especially for hop lovers. Line 'em up, I'll put 'em down...scary good drinkability. What a great beer experience. I would take this beer over Furious anyday."
"Big props must go out to PitMonkey on this one. Pours a glorious deep amber orange that has almost perfect clarity. Head is of the standard varity, one finger, fluffy, fades in a few minutes. The rye grains dominate the nose with the hops coming in at a close second. Good dose of dry hopping. Its hard to tell if I'm picking up a metallic smell or if it is the rye grains that I am not used to, either way it doesn't distract from the overall sensation. The taste has a great complexity. Again with the rye and the hops and a clean smooth mouthfeel. A superb interpratation of a hop heads Oktoberfest. Drink this beer."
"D- This is extremely drinkable. I could easily drink these until I passed out from the alcohol and deliciousness."
"Beautiful blue and white checkered, 16-oz. can. Deep gold-edged copper body with a clingy, tight, centimeter of light khaki head. Fresh, fragrant, floral and resinous hop nose with a solid malt backing (spice cake, caramel, and bread). Toasted malt and noble hop bitterness festively greet the tongue. Flash of caramel and spicy (rye?) cookie dough with cooked veggie undertones. Herbal, noble, resinous hop bitterness comes on strong in the finish and lasts a delicious while. Tastes like a rye-infused, hoppy Ofest to me! Medium body with lively, even carbonation. Another great Surly brew."
"The grassy hop character seems to grow a bit as the beer warms up a bit, coupled with a sort of pine / menthol note (but not in the typical American hop way), this becomes the dominant, though not quite defining, characteristic of this brew. If you hadn't guessed this really is quite hoppy, definitely a hop dominated brew; sort of like a cross between an IPA and a malty Oktoberfest. Quite tasty, a really enjoyable brew and I am glad they did not brew another typical Oktoberfest (while I do enjoy a well crafted traditional one, truly great ones are few and far between). Perhaps my only complaint is that the hops get in the way of really noticing the rye character."
"Solid feel to it. Medium body. Extremely drinkable. Goes down easy....and fast. I truly believe Surly needs to have an East Coast brewery contract brew for them. Dogfish Head, perhaps? Man, that would be freakin' awesome. Another fabulous beer from Surly."
"Nice bubbly frothy tan head 2 mm thick. Amber in appearance with sediment lingereing. Smells very hoppy, small amounts of bready yeast. Pretty hoppy for an Oktoberfest, grapefruit comes through slightly. SurlyFest is better than average but not amazing. Body is dry and lacking."
"Overall: Ever since objectivemonkey sent over the Surly brews I have been getting Surly. I have to admit that I saved this one for last as I tend to lean toward the hoppy brews. Being a fest beer I expected pure malt. I have never been so wrong in my life. They have taken an Oktoberfest brew and made it sooo much more. Hops and malts are both noted in pure balance. I profess there is not a greater fest brew in the world. Surly could hang their hat on this one. Yet there are sooo many others. Furious, Bender, Cynic, and dare I say DARKNESS. I see why BA voted them best. Break out the parkas honey I want to move to Minnesota!"
"Thanks, tayner!"
"Pours a nice hazy amber color with a nice tan frothy head. Smells of hops with notes of citrus and a nice sweet malty backdrop. Its tastes great! Nice a hoppy with a great citrus sweet malt character. This is a great medium bodied beer that has a ncie carbonation level to balance out the flavors. Great beer"
"Wonderful citrus and pine hop aromas waft forth, immediately this brew declares itself as not your usual Oktoberfest. Crisp and highly carbonated, tangy and delicious. The tart and complex hop flavors really dominate here, to delicious although style-clashing effect. The malt definitely keeps to the background--or rather, the dry and tangy rye malt is th emajor player. The effect is a delicious, highly drinkable, crisp, dry ale with a long bitter, flavorful finish. I love it, whatever it is."
"Final Note: I've never had a marzen with this much hop flavor. Good beer for a Hophead Fest."
"Nice full mouthfeel, with just enough carbonation. Certainly a different version of a marzen, but enjoyable."
"Now, can somebody just hook me up with a bottle of Darkness when the 15th rolls around next month, please?"
"overall, i really enjoyed this, surly never really follows the style specs, always tending to be much more aggressively hopped"
"Very good."
"Pours a clear golden/amber, thick white head forms, settles to a thin layer, leaves a ton of lacing. Smell is great, nice bready malts, grain, toast, floral/apricot, light citrus hops, different take on a marzen but I like it. Taste is similar, nice and malty, toasted bread, grain, caramel, wheat, some floral and citrus hops, touch of tangerine, very clean balanced finish, solid bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, super refreshing, very smooth and easy to drink. Different kind of marzen but shows up anything from Germany in my mind. I could certainly drink many steins of this. Thanks Jenn!!!"
"This is a much more hopped up version of this style which was quite enjoyable considering most of of the time you get the same old thing from an Oktoberfest. Non-traditional but recommended to those who like hop flavor..."
"Drinkability- IÂ’m not sure how to say it but this is about as drinkable as they come. ItÂ’s so crisp and clean and goes down so easy. The alcohol isnÂ’t staggering high so it would make a great session brew for those long Oktoberfest nights. Thanks again to mnstorm99 for the opportunity!"
"D-I know there are mixed opinions on this beer. I am rating it as a beer and not an ofest. As a beer it is outstanding. Its the kind of beer I wouldn't mind packing my fridge with and reaching for every day. I love the hop flavor of this and the spicy maltiness complements it perfectly....I like Furious and that has its place too but I feel this is a better beer overall. I'm extremely impressed."
"Drinkability is fan-dang-tastic on this one. It is very smooth, and slides down easily. This is an outstanding beer! Get it if you can."
"My favorite Surly offering? No. But this is yet another very solid beer from the guys in Brooklyn Center. I love the incorporation of rye and could care less what style this is supposed to fit into. Well worth seeking a couple cans out."
"Good carbonation and very easy to drink."
"I had my doubts from reading other reviews (considering Surly is so highly regarded), but this is very nice, up there along the lines of the other great Surly brews."
"This beer really disturbs me."
"Pours a very nice dark copper color with a finely grained head. It may look like a typical Oktoberfest, but it's anything but. The nose clean and hoppy with plenty of citrus, but with a nice malty body in the background to balance the hops. This beer is exceptionally drinkable and downright delicious; And the mouthfeel is pure velvet. Awesome!"
"Overall, a very clean tasting lager with an intesting twist."
"D: Very tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style while taking the style to the next level. This is definitely one of those beers that I could drink several of throughout a whole evening and not have the urge to drink anything else. I know that the fact that I like this beer more than any other O-fest Iâ€™ve had simply because of the hoppiness means Iâ€™m a Hophead, but Iâ€™m calling like I taste it. This is an excellent beer."
"The mouthfeel is pretty good, light carbonation, medium body. The drinkability is high on this one. I can't get enough of it. It's too bad all my local stores are out of it, I was hoping to snag at least another pack. The flavors are in great balance and everything about the beer screams ""drink me."""
"This is Surly's best all-around beer."
"drinkabilty is great. this is a darn fine octoberfest beer. well balanced, tasty, and highly enjoyable. glad i have another can!"
"I still donÂ’t know where I stand on this one. Its good, but for an Octoberfest?"
"What to say. Just like the others of the Surly line I've sampled an overall solid, impeccably drinkable beer that satisfies. Not immensly complex but it is a lager after all. Thick with caramel and toasty cereal grain. The allspice I thought was in the nose is no longer prevelant. Creamy with complimentary carbonation. Good hop flavor and bitterness. And again nice and spicey with a nougat type finish yet dry. Maybe this is more complex than I notice. All I can say is another top notch beer from a top notch brewery."
"D: This is a very interesting and unique take on an Oktoberfest, and one I would certainly love to come back to if they sold it in MA. You could easily throw down a few of these in a session. Nicely done Surly."
"Baaaa.Baaa."
"I wouldn't call it an O'fest, but what else could it be? I guess if it needs a style..."
"Not your average Oktoberfest beer, but I loved it! Keep it up Surly, hope to see you outside of Minnesota soon!"
"Poured into a Stuttgarter Hofbrau stein as per the instructions on the can. This brew pours a clear copper color. The head is massive, firm, and recedes slowly into thick lacing. The aroma is explosive. Spice rye, and noble hops, a hint of green apple and pear, with a soft biscuity undertone. The taste is more malty than the aroma. Biscuits appear then quicky fade as a hint of caramel comes through, then that fades and a nice lively spiciness shines, then some firm bitterness arrives in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with perfect carbonation, and a creamy texture. Overall, this is one of my favorite Surly beers. It seems to walk the line between being an extreme beer and being a tradintional beer. Whatever it was intended to be it is wonderful."
"Pours a deep burned orange with 2 fingers of soapy white head that dies slowly. I know this is a marzen but I know its a Surly marzen which makes alll the difference. Smells of piney hops, citrus, rye and malty. Ooooh yeah. Tastes of juicy, piney hops, malty balance and delicious rye. This is the brilliant nectar named Furious but tamed down with more flavors. If I could make a perfect octoberfest beer to suit my hophead tastes, it would be almost as good as this. Medium in the mouth with the perfect tickle of carbonation. Drinkability? If I had a case of this I would drink non stop and end up in a hospital and it would be so worth it."
"I had this once last year on tap, this year's version seems to have much more rye flavor than last year's, which I seem to recall as more grassy and pilsner-like. This is still a good beer and it's great to have another Surly in cans."
"Kudos to the Bavarian colors of the can."
"Drinkable and then some. Enough said. Damn solid O-fest by Surly! Grab your lederhosen, a big Ol' mug, pour a bunch of this in, and sing yourself a song until you fall asleep and do it again."
"Another home run for Master Omar and the wily fellows at $urly."
"But the bier,...yum!"
"This beer kicks butt. A nice copper/amber hue with a small off white head and minimal lacing. The smell definitely shows its dry hopping, it smells like rye, barley malt, piney green hops, spices, unidentified citrus, and earth. The taste really showcases the hops, with all sorts of great flavors ricocheting around my mouth. Salty pretzel flavors, rye bread, barley malt, bracing hops, herbs and spices. Very nice. Mouthfeel is full and good, and the drinkability is downright sessionable."
"Another great beer from Surly. They deserve every accolade they have received. Buy this beer. You won't be disappointed."
"Dark orange color with a quickly dissolving head, but decent lacing throughout. I didn't get much from the aroma in the way of hops and a mild malt smell. Taste was very good nice and grainy without being too sweet, good balance of piney hops on this one. felt a little weak in the mouth, not much texture. I could drink this beer all night long, great flavor, and very sessionable."
"Now, normally I'm not a huge fan of fest beer, but this... the malts are sweet, lovely, hop hit bang... ya, really, like all other Surly beer, it defies description, and is just... simply... fantastic. The mouth is smooth and crisp, if not a little too lean perhaps... an utterly fantastic beer to drink."
"This beer was so easy to drink. I really feel like this is the best lager beer I have ever tried. I like a good pils, I like the high end doppelbocks, there are some good marzens out there, but this was hands down my favorite lager."
"This pours an opaque dark amber color, whith a thick white head and ample lacing on the glass. The smell is of hops. The taste has a rich maltiness typical of Octoberfests. What makes this different than any Octoberfest I have ever tasted before is the huge hop flavor, both citrussy and piney-I believe they dry hopped it. While it stretches(and I think exceeds)the boundaries of the Octoberfest style, one cannot deny that this is a very tasty beer. It is(like all Surly beers)rich and full bodied. This is a fine beer. I just wish they would call it something other than an Octoberfest."
" I'm glad Surly took this one for a spin."
"The unassuming and standard looking body do not harbinger the different but fantastic beer that is SurlyFest. The smell gives it away at first. Mangos, pineapple, strawberry, passionfruit. All very malty but rich and fruity as well. The taste backs this up. A rich malty beer with many fruit notes, also carmel malts, with a better-than-average-for-the-style hop finish. I think Surly could've stuck with what may be assumed is the Surly formula (hops up the wazoo), but this beer is so much more, it is delicious, unique, and should be tried by all. A standout Oktoberfest."
"This might be my favorite Octoberfest, mostly because Surly's effort is not to style which is fine by me. Starts with nice creamy tan head, thin, but might have been the bartender's pour more than the beer. Copper colored beer with gold highlights. Strong citrus aroma, hop and malt strong. Very aromatic, almost like a fresh hop. Not sure what it is, but smell like American hops. The hop character is strong on top of a lot of caramel taste in the malt. Very fun to drink and will make a point of getting another before it runs out."
