"For bells this isn't all that impressive. It has a proper copper orange color, clear, and holding an inch of white suds for a few minutes before settling. Aroma is sweet and rich, autumnal, bigger in grain character than most of these, sweeter too, but seems alright. Minimally hoppy in nose and taste, these could be increased a little for balance and depth. Toffee and lager yeast in the flavor, long flavor too, but lacking nuance. Because it's a little bolder than others, it's hard to drink a whole lot of it, but maybe that's part of its charm. More filling and hearty for later fall, makes sense, but this is nowhere near as compelling as other bells brews."

"Bready aromas and flavors, crystal clear orange-ish gold with a 2 finger head with good lacing on the glass. Very rich malty flavors, malt driven like an Oktoberfest. Good body and carbonation, with rich foam. The malt balances well with the bitterness."

"This was a decent, but not great Octoberfest. Picked up a growler, poured into a mug. Good color, lighter orange.  Light molasses marzen flavor, definite biscuit notes...but a little bland. Very mild white head. Pretty OK."

"I feel like Bells products are typically more solid than this was. What I did get was awfully good but it simply did not assert itself as it should."
""
"O-I'm afraid I've come to expect more from Bells but this is just an average attempt from an American brewer at the German Marzen. Many better options out there."

"Overall – Rather sweet and malty with a great flavor profile and wonderful transitions. Drinkable and quite favorable."

"DRINKABILITY: Nice balance to this one. The firm flavor was quite welcome after the modest aroma. This beer was repeatable, easy to drink and priced right -- three important characteristics for a beer calling itself ""Oktoberfest."" It's definitely not in the upper ranks of Märzens -- more around the middle, I'd say, but for spending a nice fall afternoon watching baseball, football or whatever your fall sports weakness is, you could do a lot worse."

"O - this is a phenomenal beer in all aspects.. i'm having it a little late since it's january and it was bottled in august, but i think it allowed for some of the more complex flavors to kick in.. maybe? i don't know, if this is what it's like not fresh, then maybe that's how i want it!"

"Drink- Thanks Erik for an Octoberfest I wouldve never had before. This was pretty flavorful with a very odd aftertaste. I would have this one again next year if I were in MI for fall."

"Bell's Oktoberfest is definitely a beer that you can drink a few of, but it doesn't really distinguish itself in any way. Good, but not great."
"Average looking for the style, a red-orange with a tiny head. Aroma is sweet, nutty caramel malts and grains. Solid. The taste is also good - props go out to Bells for a domestic Oktoberfest that's not too sweet. Instead, it goes down not tasting too much like anything at first, a bit of graininess but not too much else. Some toastiness comes in for the finish too. Drinkability and mouthfeel are both about what you'd expect for the style, a bit more carbonation wouldn't hurt though. Overall, it could be better, but kicks the pants off of most of the domestic O-Fests I've had this year. I probably like the Heavy Seas Marzen a bit more, but this is still good."
"This poured out with a nice look golden orange color with a fizzy white head on top that doesn't lace too much. The smell of the beer has some nice aromas of grains and hints of autumn spice. The taste of the beer was pretty good, it had some decent caramel notes and some decent autumn flavors in there. The mouthfeel of the beer was typical, it got to be a little flat by the end though. Overall it's not my favorite Fest beer but it's not a bad one to try."
"O - A little to be desired. Average all around."
"Served from tap into a sampler shaker pint. Poured yellow-orange with a two finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, grain, floral, subtle spice, and nutmeg. The flavor was of sweet malt, floral, spice, wheat, and grain. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. Nothing on this one really 'popped' for me in the nose nor the flavor. The flavors I did get were blended quite nicely, but this would have been much better with some added complexity going on. Worth trying though for the curious and fan a-like."
"2: There are many better to try out there"
"During an Oktoberfest party I was able to try the Bells Oktoberfest. The beer poured light amber kind of hazy. Decent carbonation that created a thin white head that laced. The smell was big on sweet/caramel malt and some grain. Taste was better than the scent would lead. The malt and grain is prsent, but there are hints of fruit. The mouthfeel was good....definite session beer. Overall it is probably one of the better Marzen beers that I have had. Certainly worth a try."
"O: Good beer, not great, but a solid overall. Very refreshing, good session beer."
"B - A very nice brew, one you can drink multiple bottles of on a crisp fall afternoon, good balance, good depth."
"I picked this up in secret halloween 2011, thanks Michael. The pour is light amber, small white head, light lacing. The aroma is pretty typical fot the style, light toasted notes, some caramel sweetness. The flavor is toasted malt, some bready sweetness, light sweet finish. The body is full, good carbonation. Overall, a nice easy drinking fest beer."
"Overall, this aromatic märzen is an ideal fall-time quaffer. Not the craziest most robust example of the style but still a very solid rendition and one that I would purchase again. Recommended."
"O: Crisp, not bad; In general I like Bells, this just isn't impressing me as much as their beers normally do."
"O - I haven't found an oktoberfest that blew me away, but Bell's comes the closest. I want to take this beer and sit on my dock in Maine and go through a six pack. This is a very good beer"
"O- It's solid. Just a normal beer that bell's brewed pretty well."
"Notes: So-so marzen. Plenty of toasted malt flavors with a good amount of caramel. Nice hints of fruit and herbal hops. Nothing too special but a decent autumn beer."
"O- a mediocre Octoberfest, and not up to snuff with Bell's other offerings. Not a bad option if choices are lacking, but there's much better out there."
"D: This beer drinks very nicely. It's delicious."
"Overall a let down in terms of style. It's crisp and refreshing and drinkable for sure but lacks taste wise."
"I like that the beer is dry, but I could use more malt sweetness to give it some depth. I'm glad I only picked up a single; there are better examples of the style to be had just as easily. I finished just over half the bottle."
"This is a fairly average to below average American attempt at an Oktoberfest. A bit disappointed with Bell's here; won't be checking this out again. Generally bland, kind of like an APWA of this style. Good if you wanted something simple, unremarkable, and unmemorable, but why bother? .... Why bother with anything?"
"Medium body, well carbonated, sticky and chewy on the tongue. Drinks pretty well, although nothing too explosive here."
"o: pretty good oktoberfest. Nothing that really stands out, but an enjoyable beer to drink."
"D- I think I really like this beer, Im not a huge oktoberfest guy, HOSS is my favorite from the states but this might just be my second. A six pack might be in order."
"O: Bell's Octoberfest is an above average, yet slightly forgettable entry into the Märzen world. Nothing stands out here, yet it's easy to drink without much complaint. I certainly wouldn't pass one of these up, yet if given a choice, I'd rather have a Victory Festbier or Great Lakes O-Fest instead."
"Overall not bad, surprisingly not loaded with caramel and reddish malts which is a nice change, nice light toasty malts, hops are barely there and nice additions so a bit more of those would have been better, and the other big thing is the tons of fruit juice, which comes from the yeast probably fermenting a bit to hot and stressed, but not too bad."
"D - An average Oktoberfest... Solid appearance and aroma... The taste and mouthfeel are a bit of a let down... There are several other style counterparts that I would opt for and recommend over this Bell's offering..."
"Overall: A pretty good take on a Marzen. Full flavored and well balanced."
"Pours a nice gold color w/ an off white one finger head. Good carbonation and lacing on the glass. Beer has a little cloudy vibe to it. Nose is mostly toasted malt, w/ a hint of caramel. A little thin and one dimensional for me. Taste is the same as the nose. A little disappointing. Feel is medium w/ a little touch of honey aftertaste. Definitely not the best thing I've had from this brewery, but a good beer if you don't want to think about what you're drinking."
"This was a good representation of this style, a well balanced flavorful beer. I would drink this again."
"O - An average Marzen. Certainly not disappointed but not too impressed either."
"Not a complex beer by any means, but a very sessional one. Very simple and straightforward taste that is enjoyable."
"A lovely clear amber liquid full of carbonation bubbles sits beneath a billowing head that stands tall above the rim of the glass. Very attractive. The smell leaves much to be desired however, as the grain scents are very weak. The taste is primarily biscuit, though hops make their presence known with a floral/herbal flavor in the finish. Nothing special going on in the mouthfeel, though carbonation is just right. Not one of Bell's better brews."
"O: Extremely drinkable, tasty, great representation of the style."
"Refreshing and flavourful."
"The beer is nearly clear, and appears light orange in color. The head is thick and frothy, measuring a little over an inch thick. The aroma is somewhat muted and weak, though I have yet to experience a really assertive, bold aroma from a beer of this ilk. The flavor is nice, with a strong malt and grain presence, followed by a light dose of pleasant spices. Great feel on the palate. I could throw back a few pints of this. I would have this again."
"Fuller bodied with a very good spice and grain finish. This wasn't a domestic oktoberfest trying to masquerade as an oktoberfest or trying to put its own spin on it. Takes the style and runs with it very well"
"O: Not a bad effort, but I could really use more malt."
"This is a solid easy to drink Oktoberfest, I did expect a bit more from Bell's though. However, this sixer will become a memory before too long."
"O-It's an ok octoberfest but I'm left with kind of a meh feeling. Compared to Great Lakes or some of the German examples, this one isn't all that great."
"Medium copper color, slightly hazy, plenty of foam. The aroma seems light with more of an emphasis on the hops than the malt. The taste was similar with a tad more malt noticeable, with some cinnamon and nutmeg hiding in the back. The body is good and it's fairly smooth."
"Clear copper color. Virtually no head and no lacing. Malt aroma is grainy and metallic. Taste has similar bready/grainy malts, very clean. A hint of apple and caramel. Quite sweet. Minimal hop bitterness, although it becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. Medium-light bodied, carbonated and smooth. Definitely sessionable."
"Not too rich and mildly carbonated leaves this Oktoberfest beer very quaffible. The appearance could be cleaned up a bit for a better presentation rating."
"Overall: I would have liked a much smoother hop bitterness in the finish. I wouldn't search this one out again."
"O - A pretty awesome oktoberfest. Has a really nice flavor."
"So easy to drink, a super-solid take on the style"
"great full flavored traditional octoberfest."
"Overall, it is a multidimensional, very flavorful, well-balanced beer."
"O: A nice, simple, subtly sweet Oktoberfest"
"Overall, a good, but not great example of the style. It was enjoyable but I'd rather try another offering of this style than give this one another try."
"Great feel and a very easy drinker if you like a sweeter brew. I can have 4 or so until I have to switch it up. Great session brew."
"Overall: Not a bad beer at all, but there are several better examples of the style around. I probably wouldn't seek this one out again."
"D-This is one of my favorite stateside Marzens. I wish I could get more than a few months out of the year."
"Overall – Good beer that finishes a little dry."
"Overall – An okay Octoberfest, but to be honest I’d much rather have a SA Octoberfest over this one."
"O - would recommend this to anybody wanting an overall good Oktoberfest"
"M- Average. A bit thin, but not too much. Carbonation is pretty spot on. Just could have a bit more in the body."
"This beer is drinkable, not much in the way for flavors but it is mildy malty with a nice not dry finish. It is easy going the entire time, nothing wrong with it but they forgot the flavor."
"O) This is a nice fall drinker. Picked this up as a single in a mix pack, but I'd be plenty happy to have five more in the fridge."
"Pours out an amber orange with a one finger whitehead that quickly fades leaving a little retention, sparse lacing and good carbonation. The smell consists of caramel, some bread and sweet malts. The taste starts out with some caramel, apple, some sugary sweet malts and than some hops sneak in to balance the taste and finishes off with some hops and caramel in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth, but dry and overall I thought this was a good beer that I'll try again."
"Not my favorite Bell's beer. Thin and rather soft on flavor. Decent, but not great."
"Overall - I thought this was one of the better Octoberfest beers I've had. I've never found marzens to be particularly complex, but this one actually displays some nice complexity. Well done by Bell's."
"M/O: Crisp and rich flavor, the beer has a great carbonation. Overall a decent interpretation of the style."
"D/O Drinkability is only fair due to the relative harshness (when compared to other beers in the style) and overall I am left wanting more. 3.0"
"Leaves the sweet flavor with a slightly astringent bite on the tongue."
"Pours a rich copper with a frothy off white head. The smell is mostly malt with spice undertones. The smell isn't very potent, but very inviting. The taste is nice, not as sweet as other oktoberfests, but very enjoyable. The malt is the focus and plays out very nice. The mouthfeel is medium, nice carbonation, good balance and depth to the flavor. Overall an enjoyable oktoberfest, only a few minor differences to set itself apart from the rest, but still enjoyable nonetheless."
"O: An average octoberfest with an unfortunate mineral flavor that lingers."
"I love grabbing the first seasonals I see on the shelf because I know they are fresh. This one pours out a bright copper color with cream colored head. The smell is rich and malty, with bready aromas like pumpernickel, with some faint herbal hops. The taste is rich and slightly sweet, but with a nice herbal hops balance. I detect some faint toffee flavors from the roasted malts. I am not a huge fan of the style since I favor hoppier beers but this one is quite nice. I am afraid that a lot of the German imports could be pasteurized, sure they meet Reinheitsgebot but what about *after* they are brewed? To that point I may never know what a real Oktobefest beer tastes like, but I think Larry Bell has put together a very nice, drinkable one. Prosit!"
"O- Absolutely delicious. Overall just a fantastic beer. I was worried about the lack of retention and thought the taste would be diluted. I was wrong."
"Overall: Nice beer, but there are better examples of this style."
"O:"
"Overall: This is a pretty nice beer overall that I would drink again. I think the fact that it's underwhelming in the nose department really brings it down. Part of the experience is the aromatics and this beer leaves a lot to be desired. However its a good tasting beer that would go well on a fall day. It's worth checking out at least once."
"D - I really expect more from Bells. This is a poor rendition of an Oktoberfest beer IMHO.others in this style."
"notes: for Bell's, this is middle of the pack. better than lager of the lakes and third coast beer, and on par with oberon."
"Mouth feel and overall - Very dry overall. Makes me thirst for water. Very natural and leafy tasting. Too dry and carbonated for my likings."
"M - Carbonation is bright and crisp. Very good for the style. Medium body with a slightly sticky mouthfeel."
"D: Easy to drink and characteristic of a good octoberfest beer. Solid offering."
"Pale orange in color, it has a caramel aroma and thin, quickly disappearing head, but opens up big and malty at the first sip, with a full barley mouth feel and soft, but crisp finishing hop upon the swallow. This is a beer lover's beer, unafraid to fill the mouth with malty sweetness and a pronounced grainy flavor that is proud uncorrupted by roasting or other flavors. Although slightly over-carbonated in the bottle, it's actually one of the few efforts that have reminded me of the Vaterland."
"I tried this twice during the fall and just not a fan of it - not bad, just others I enjoy much more."
"Tap from various bars and 12oz bottles into pint glass. Pours a clear light amber with a big three finger off white head and spotty lacing. Nose is yeasty biscuits, grass and caramel malt. Taste is sweet fruit, caramel malt and nuts with a dry grassy slightly bitter finish. Medium mouth feel. Not a favorite style, but a fairly decent brew. I prefer tap over bottle."
"D: Another very solid beer from Bell's. Not the most impressive for this style, but very easy to drink and could definitely drink 4-6 of these easy."
"12 ounce bottle. Pours clear amber color with a 1 finger white head with average retention and average glass lacing. Aromas of caramel, pumpkin, and spices. Taste of spice and pumpkin with a bit of a bitter finish with spices that linger afterward. Medium carbonation and body. I was actually surprised on how tasty this was considering the aromas. Tasty!"
"What a strange beer. It tasted nothing like it smelled, and the taste was completely out of style. Possibly the tap handle didn't match what was in the keg? Something definitely seemed amiss here. I hope to try this again sometime to see if the experience is different."
"D: This pretty good beer and has some interesting things going on, but exemplifying the octoberfest style is not one of them. It has some of the right elements. Malts are toward the lighter end, but reasonably rich and toasty with some juicy malt sweetness. Hops are noble if a tad forward. But what is up with the vinous, fruity ester, bready yeast character? What is this? A Vienna Kolsch hybrid? A KolschFest? It is interesting, but I'm not sure it works."
"Bottle from Champagne Cellars. This was spot on the style but not all that drinkable. Sweet, fast disapearing foaming head on copper fruity coloured body. Malty pleasant aroma. Middling mouthfeel. Not unpleasant, just not something I could finish.Understated hops (nobel)."
"I poured into a pint glass to a half inch of off white head. The beer is orange in color. The aroma is caramel malt. The taste is also caramel malt with just enough hops to balance it out. I used to really dig this style, but my palate is evolving toward bigger, more flavorful beers. This isn't a bad beer. It is just a little plain for me."
"D This a pretty good beer, and similar to the German O'fest beers I've had. I'd have another. 3.5  "
"D- This misses some of the key elements that I love in Marzens. It tastes more like a generic lager, and is even borderline adjunct lager in its interpretations. It could be so much better, and is a disappointment coming from Bell's."
"Fantastic drinkability rounds out what I consider to be a world-class example of one of my favorite styles. This one hits many of the notes that Ayinger and Stoudt's Oktoberfests do, which puts it in elite company for me, and away from the big syrupy messes many American Oktoberfests end up being."
"Not much going on with the aroma. The beer carries a very small white head that disappears quickly No noticeable lacing or retention. It displays a beautiful sparkly orange gold color. Taste is excellent. Crisp and clean with a bready lightly sweet taste. Slightly metallic aftertaste. Good carbonation. Medium light body. Overall, it is a light refreshing beer that goes down smooth. A pleasure to drink."
"Mouthfeel was good, but i wouldn't see myslef drinking very many of these."
"D: Okay drinkability. A little too much one sided."
"D - Easy to drink because the alcohol is not noticeable at all in the finish, possibly due to the low 5.5% abv."
"This pours a bit darker than a traditional lagger with little head, its definately a session brew and I'd take several of these down at a tailgate. The finish contains pronounced tones of malt and some peppery hop will dance on the back of your tongue."
"Nothing really great about this beer. One of Bell's weaker attempts."
"Poured into a pint glass pours a rustic brown with a minimal white head no lace on the glass. Smell is pretty thin with a bit of malt and bread through the nose. On taste is was expecting more of a bread malt type taste but was happy that this was nicely balanced. This beer went down very smoothly and I truly enjoyed this, overall probably one of the bester marzen styles I have ever had."
"Pours a clear, very deep gold with very little slightly off-white head. The nose is pretty faint, but there's some apple cider, slight bready yeast, and grainy sweetness. Nice feel and the finish is really clean, but the taste is pretty blah. There's some bready yeast along with a slightly metallic taste as well as a faint hops note. But really, there's just not a lot of taste here. Goes down like water. I'm not really a fan of the style and this did nothing to change my opinion."
"Pours a light shade of copper with a two-finger off white head and a bit of spotty lacing. Nose brings caramel, bread, and a bit of earthiness. Taste adds in a bit of European hops but is comprised mainly of a general bread dough character with a hint of grain. Feel is light and moderately carbonated. Drinks alright, but is not one of my favorite offerings from them."
"overall this doesnt hit me a sucha great craft beer, but its something that can be drunk somewhat liberally but with a taste of craft beer."
"The mouthfeel is light and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is good, it's a pretty good beer of the style. It was a lighter, easy drinking beer but still had some good malty flavors to it. It wasn't anything outstanding, but more of a good and easy drinking beer. I thought it was pretty good version of the style as well."
"D - Very easy to drink, goes down very nicely on it's own or with whatever you're having. Probably not something I'll seek out specifically in the future, as while there's nothing wrong with the drink there's nothing that particularly stood out in it either."
"D - Well a good Oktoberfest overall and a great beer by bells but I liked other Oktoberfest's more. Good beer overall."
"D - I'm typically not crazy over oktoberfests but I really like this one. The mildness makes it very drinkable but it still boasts plenty of flavor. I could easily go through a 6 pack."
"drinkability: by far the worst Bell's beer Ive had. This was not made for BA's"
"D - Another good tasting brew from Bell's. A touch lighter for a Marzen but still very enjoyable, good seasonal brew. I recommend picking up a 6 pack before the season ends!"
"Overall i believe Bell's did a good job on this beer, nothing too crazy or bold going on here, but its an October fest and its not meant to be bold, just tasty and drinkable and this beer succeeds at both. Having had many bottles of this beer it was nice to try it on tap and i thought i was slightly better. My go to local octoberfest."
"I really enjoyed this beer. The color is pale golden/orange, typical of the style. What makes this more drinkable than a lot of Octoberfests is the lack of cloying sweetness and syrupy mouthfeel. The mouthfeel is supple and rich - someone below said creamy, and I agree. The carbonation is thin but not lacking sharpness. The flavor is rich, malty, with hints of vanilla and honey. This is good stuff. It goes down very smoothly and with the relatively low ABV for the style you can enjoy a few of these. Excellent effort from Bell's. I'm looking to try the 25th anniversary beer, but $18 a six pack seems a bit steep. This one is a fall seasonal winner for sure."
"D- I probably won't have another; I'm a big fan of this style but this leaves a lot to be desired and there are a lot of better choices out there. This isn't bad, it just doesn't taste like much of anything."
"D - Goes down easy but it doesn't mean its good."
"D- Very nice, maybe the best Octoberfest I have had this year."
"Bottle. Batch 9833. Poured into a tupil glass. Appearance is a golden orange clear color with a 1 finger white head that coasters. Matly, pumpkin, squash type of aromas eminating in the nose. Oh, eeh, mmm, not really a fan of this one I'm sorry to report. Starts with a little carbonated medium mouthfeel that then develops into a slight bready pumpkin type flavor with some metallic notes. The bitterness from the noble hops are there but not until the very end and then go on to linger in the mouth. Some lace as forms as I drink away. Overall, I think this is just OK. Being from MI, I expedct a lot from a hometowm brew and this one just lets me down a touch. Oh well, most everything else they do is great!"
"Bell's is a typically amber lager with a rich, malty presence, with a slight tinge of hoppiness near the finish. More complex than the other Octoberfests I""ve reviewed lately, and not as heavy on the palate. I rate this one a prime example of a traditional Octoberfest style, and a delicious brew."
"Very drinkable"
"Another 6 packs I'm glad I picked up based on Bells reputation."
"This is one of my favorite Oktoberfest brews. It has all of the characteristics you've come to expect from a good fall lager: not too heavy, not too light, some bread like malty sweetness, balanced hop character and mild carbonation; everything that reminds you fall is here and the leaves are changing. Served in the proper glassware this makes for a wonderful fall evening."
"The beer was a mild golden color with a small head that fell to a small island over top of the brew. Clarity was fantastic and a mild carbonation was present cascading towards the surface. Good looking, but maybe a touch light in color. Aroma was grainy, fairly light with a mild bready sweetness in the background. Flavor was very bready with mild sweetness and toastiness. The graininess was pretty full in there, and a mild bitterness hit on the finish. I thought it was tasty. Mouthfeel was a solid moderate with a light carbonation that gives the brew the feel of more thickness than it truly had. Overall, I liked the brew. It was a little more grainy than I would have liked and the nose was lighter than expected, but it was an enjoyable beer."
"Bells has made a perfectly acceptable Octoberfest, but a bit middle of the road for my tastes. I do reccomend trying this Festbier however, especially if you like this time of year and the types of beer that come with it."
"D - I really expect more from Bells. This is one of the worst Oktoberfest beers I've ever had. Not much flavor and the flavor that is there really doesn't stand up to others in this style."
"Not as rich as I normally like. Very dissapointing. Would not buy again."
"D: Easy to drink and characteristic of a good octoberfest beer. Solid offering."
"Cheers"
"D: Enjoyable and very drinkable; although, not one of Bell's better offerings; kind of plain."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Octoberfest are not typically my favorite beers to begin with although I like to have a few each fall. This one was a bit of a let down, especially coming from Bells. I prefer Great Lakes, Victory, and even Sam Adams Octoberfest to this one. Not bad, but I don't see myself spending money on it again."
"MD- Goes down very easy as most Maerzens do. I would certainly consider this one again."
"Pours a clear amber color under a thin, soapy head. Tame, clean, sweet malty aroma with a somewhat odd doughy note. The flavor is a bit more straightforward in the typical Märzen flavors...toasted grain, sweet yet dry, and clean. Nutty and earthy with a bitter finish. Medium-light bodied. Not the most well-crafted Oktoberfest bier out there, but worth a try. I don't see myself buying this again though."
"Poured from bottle into twenty two ounce beer glass.. Pours typical amber orange color.. Little head that quickly dissolved.. Some Carmel flavour but nothing special to make me really want more.. Have had other bells offerings that are much better... Still prefer good old Sam Adams or ayinger"
"Pours a clear copper that is a shade or two lighter than most Oktoberfests, with one finger of off-white foam that quickly dissipates. Aromas are not bad by any stretch of the imagination, but neither are they consistent with boldly toasty profile of most members of its style. The taste is also too sweet (with mostly notes of honey and sugar) to fit the bill. I typically like Bells' offerings but this one lacks malty depth that draws me to the style in the first place. Pass."
"D. Very drinkable; crisp like the fall weather. Not a great beer, but the first Octoberfest/Oktoberfest of the year so I was pleased."
"I have had two other Octoberfests this year. The HackerPschorr tasted like lager with some extra hops sprinkled in, while the Leinie's was somewhat similar to Bells but with some off flavors. Bells is best so far."
"D: This is an alright Octoberfest. Nothing special. But this beer is plenty drinkable."
"Severely disappointed."
"Pretty ""plain Jane"" and middle-of-the-road for a Bell's offering. O.K. for the style, but nothing to shout out about here."
"D: I find this to be a very refreshing Oktoberfest, easy drinking and light on the palate. I would see this ranking higher if overall taste was a bit more bold."
"D - nothing really outstanding from the beer, like the bit of hop at the end in the taste, will stick to Germany for my oktoberfest"
"D-Good I could drink a few"
"Drinkability: I'm typically not a big consumer of Oktoberfest style beers, but I really enjoyed this one, possibly because it's less sweet with more hop. I did have three last night and was ready for more."
"D: Ehhhh. I guess I could have a few of these, but it really was quite boring."
"It's gettin' to be that time o' year again, when O-Fests run the world. This one pours a lightly hazed orange amber topped by a half-finger of seemingly ecru foam. The nose comprises red apple, cinnamon, caramel, cashews, nutmeg, and a touch o' citrusy hops. The taste holds notes of orange peel, caramelized caramel (okay, I've been advised by VDubb that it'd be better to call it burnt caramel...either way, you get the picture), red apple skin, oak, and a slight bit o' lime. The body is a heavy light, with a moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a solid O-Fest, not one of the heavier hitters but pretty good nonetheless."
"D- This is my first fall seasonal of the year and it didn't disappoint. Overall, this is a solid O-Fest that is definitely worth a try."
"Had a glass on-tap at Tap and Table in Emmaus. The clear amber lager looked nice enough, but there was an odd floral and plastic twist to the caramel malts I just couldn't get into. Yes, there was the light bread and caramel character, but it doesn't dominate the beer like it should. The body is drinkable, but the flavor isn't."
"I thought that this one was a good example of the style. My qualms are minimal: better head retention, maybe a tad less bitterness and some more hop in the aroma. The hoppy aroma is my American opinion so don't yell at me."
"D I really do like this. It is probably my favorite American Octoberfest. I could drink this all day."
"D: Oktoberfest isn't a complex style to begin with, but Bell's has made a mostly drinkable version of it."
"Tried this side by side with the Great Lakes Oktoberfest and this was a big letdown. While the GL was a fairly faithful, if boring, representation of the style, I'm not sure what the aim was with this. Appearance was a golden copper color with a quickly fading foamy off white head and little lacing. Aroma had the typical toasted malt notes, but very little caramel or hops, or basically any depth at all. Flavor was also lacking malt depth and was oddly tangy and sweet and overly carbonated for the style. Bread and toasted malts dominate with some occasional strong grain presence as well, and the finish has some earthy hops and grains. Mouthfeel is medium thick with strong, fine carbonation. Not a bad beer, but missing a lot for the style, and particularly woeful when compared to the Great Lakes version."
"D- Not my favorite style of beer but another good offering from Bell's, nowhere near my favorite of theirs but still a good beer, would possibly order one if they were serving it at the cafe."
"Mouthfeel is medium and dry. Drinkability is fine..its a good oktoberfest, but not one of the best."
"Pours a nice light clear orange color with a finger of white foam that eventually laces on top. The aroma is of malts and not much more. I think I was able to pick out the scent of a bit of citrus from the hops as well as honey. The taste is quite malty as an Oktoberfest should be. There is a definite undercurrent of noble hops which give it quite a traditional German Oktoberfest flavor. I might be biased but I tend to go for the sweeter American style (personal preference, say what you will). The slight taste of citrus from the hops eventually builds upon the tongue to almost be acidic to the point where it might be mistaken for bitterness in the beer. This creates a rather earthy Oktoberfest. As it should be this beer is extraordinarily smooth and appropriately lightly carbonated. Overall a definite recommendation of a German style Oktoberfest. Prost!"
"D: Good example of the style. If this is your thing, you will enjoy!"
"M/D: Medium body, very delightful feel. It does dry your mouth out a bit though... I think the drinkability is great. Like I said above, its my favorite so far this year."
"Pours a lighter amber color with an off-white head that sticks around nicely. The aroma is exceptionally clean with hay and biscuit notes upfront, along with caramel and toffee, and some floral hops. The flavor starts off with toasted bread, caramel, toffee, musty hay, floral and tea-like hops, and a bit of alcohol. The mouthfeel is smooth and drinkability is excellent. This is one of my favorite marzens, and arguably the best American interpretation (along with Victory's)."
"DrinkabilityL An easy drinker and definitely right for the Fall, but this isn't necessarily the best of its style."
"D: Well I can't fight it the weather is changing and the Octoberfest and pumpkin beers are on their way, this beer is a good introduction to a season of new beers."
"Edit: After finishing the 6-pack, three of the beers had that awful smell, while three were actually mellow and crisp smelling. So I'm not sure what is going on with that..."
"I am a huge Bell's fan and love most of their beers, but I think this needed a little more darkness and malt to nail the style. The Dogtoberfest I had a few days ago was much more satisfying. This is good and drinkable, though - just throw the bottle away after you pour and forget it's supposed to be an Octoberfest."
"drinkability is good and was just what the doctor ordered after drinking 2 german oktoberfest failures"
"D - The only thing that would make this easier to drink is better taste."
"D: So far Great Lakes leads the Octoberfest pack. Sorry, Bell's."
"The appearance is quite striking. A very translucent gold starts at the bottom and works up into a deep golden rose with ruby interior petals. The smell is bittersweet marzen malts and very light other than that. The taste has that very good, very smooth toasted amber malt quality frequent of good oktoberfests for the first half, and then a very good hop balance comes into play to finish it off. The beer does have a decent body to it and though the hops and 5.5% are great, but nothing to trifle with, the drinkability is above average."
"D: the only reason i keep sipping on this is because of the flavor than the smell. if i want pumpkin ill get pumpkin ale."
"an easy drinker for sure. not very impressive bit still a good, solid beer. i can imagine this with warm doughnuts from the cider mill."
"D-This is only an average beer for this style. Somewhat of a dissapointment for this brewery."
"A good beer to have with a meal. I would have never guessed this to be an octoberfest beer however."
"Mouthfeel is nice - good medium body and really active but not prickly carb. Finish is sweet and dry. Nice for the style. Overall, this isn't bad, but I'm pretty sure I could homebrew this quality of beer with a little more practice. I guess I just expect a bit more from Bells, and this is just remarkable. Remarkably average, that it."
"Although I am now follower of the Bells Beer consumer cult, I must admit this is a good beer. Perhaps not great, but certainly drinkable."
"This one was poured into a Guinness pint glass. It poured light and kind of watery with the lightest of heads. It was a light, light orange that was very translucent. The smell was strange. It had both yeasty and lunchmeat aromas, yes, lunchmeat. I have no idea why it smelled like that, considering it's very, very fresh. The taste was bland and also had a slint tint of lunchmeat to it. What's happening? At least it was fresh and crisp but it was a little light. I don't know where Bell's went wrong on this one. I didn't think it was awful last year but this bottle was horrible. Not drinkable whatsoever."
"Drinkability: A clean beer, but not as flavorful as it could be. A solid concoction. Worth drinking in October."
"D - average octoberfest, a bit too syrupy for me"
"One and done. I love Bell's products, but not crazy about this one."
"I was expecting more from Bell's on this one. Will just have to switch back to their other offerings..."
"D-lighter beer that has an ok taste and decent mouthfeel. not one of their better beers but it alright."
"D: Admittedly I didn't like the first couple of bottles from the original 6-pack when I first picked it up a few months ago. Maybe a little age was good for this or my tastes are more in tune to the style (I was drinking A LOT of Imperial IPAs at that time), but this beer is much more enjoyable than I remember it. Not a world class brew and certainly not the best Bell's has to offer, but a nice beer to enjoy when you want something easy to drink and not overwhelming in any one flavor category."
"D- Drinkability is good with this beer. Not my favorite style by far but Bell's makes it enjoyable. Will look for next year when it's fresh!"
"D - This is a great lawn mower beer or something to sit back and enjoy with friends. This wouldn't be my first choice if I were looking to explore the depths of palate but overall an enjoyable beer."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Medium bodied and moderately carbonated. It has a dry finish and a really good aftertaste where a bit of honey."
"Poured a light amber color in the glass, with hints of gold along the sides. Strong visual of carbonation, that forms a white half inch high head on top, that gradually settles to a thin layer. Cracked grain and bread strikes the nose at first scent, with a touch of grass and peppery fragrances come out at the end. The bread comes out in the flavor by attaching itself to the palate. That flavor stays there and lingers long after each taste. There is a feint bit of bitterness hits the back of the palate with grassy and grapefruit flavors. The feel is light to medium bodied with a thinning to a more watery consistency. An ever present feel carbonation is there from front to back. This is an average octoberfest, the color is to golden the aroma is not hearty enough. The flavor is not robust and the feel does not have that crispness I look for in the style, of course I could be wrong."
"Very drinkable but not too special."
"Rather decent brew. Nice hops and good flavor. Very drinkable."
"D: Highly drinkable. I'd order another, and wouldn't object to buying a sixer, despite the off metallic character."
"I haven't had too many beers in this style. Enjoyable as a good anytime beer."
"Drinkability: A solid Oktoberfest and another tasty brew from Bells. Refreshing with a nice body and crisp feel, a brew I will look forward to enjoying again."
"Aroma was down-right bad. I've gone through a 6 pack and keep getting this same nasty salty vegetable smell. Past experiences with this beer didn't leave me with high expectations, but again, I gave into the pull of Octoberfest. It's drinkable but falls short of the typical Bell's quality."
"Pours a clear, golden/copper color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of slight yeast, sweet malt, slight dry hop, hint of spice, and slight grain. Fits the style of a Marzen/Oktoberfest. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, grain, hint of citrus, pale malt, hint of butter, sweet malt, and slight hops. Overall, a decent blend, body, and appearance."
"O: Ok beer, but a great alternative to macrobrew lager."
"This review was missing after a server crash. Added back on 10/28."
"Pours a bright orange color. Tone isn't quite as deep as I like to see in a Marzen, but pretty nonetheless. Lots of carbonated bubbles originate from the base of the pour and a bubbly 1/2 finger head fizzes to nothing quickly. Nose is sweet malts and hints of caramel and honey. Taste is full of malts and seasonal spices. Mouthfeel is fairly thin. Drinkability is pretty solid, taste makes up for the lack in appearance. Overall a good marzen from Bell's."
"Purchased from Three Cellars in Franklin, WI. Pours a bright amber body with a thin white head that caps the beer and lasts. Aroma is a light malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation, toasted sweet malt flavors with a low bitterness in the finish an a hint of honey flavor. Overall a terrific take on the Marzen style."
"D: A decent, mildly flavored, mass market Oktoberfest beer. A little on the malty side, but with a nice, light hop bitterness, makes for an easy drinking autumn beer."
"(D)- A solid oktoberfest that definitely wasnt what I was expecting, but in a good way. Definitely much hoppier than usual for an oktoberfest, but its good though. Still, really malty and filling than I would want though."
"Overall, this is one of Bell's beers that just didn't impress me. It is better than some octoberfests, but I expected more flavor considering it was brewed by Bell's. Probably not something I will be drinking a lot of."
"I've only seen this beer on tap in PA, never bottles. I'm pretty sure Larry Bell won't send any of his lagers to PA in bottles. Why, I have no idea. Anyway, arrived in a standard shaker glass. Appears a hazed apricot color with about a finger of light rust colored head. Aromas and flavors consist of biscuit malt, sweet caramel, slightly fruity, somewhat spicy yeast, some peppery hops. Medium in both body and carbonation. Not really something I thought about the next day."
"I can usually expect some decent and reliable results from Bell's but I think I was turned off by the smell, spicier and more herb-y than most other Octoberfests. Good amber color and medium head, a lot of carbonation, but a little too spicy and bitter for an Octoberfest, mainly because I think lagers shouldn't have these characteristics."
"D: Not the best Octoberfest brew, but another tasty offering by Bell's"
"D - The flavor is nice, but it lacks sweetness and it's too crisp and hoppy compared to my favorite Octoberfest beers. Not bad, but nothing that I'd seek out again."
"Poured to a two fingered head that didnt last very long. Head was offwhite in color. Brew itsself was clear and very golden. Had some lacing but not a lot. Smelled a little sweet,like caramel. With biscuits and malt. Tasted slightly sweet. Also of caramel and malt. Had a slight bitter aftertaste. This wasnt a bad thing. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation was about right. I will have a sixer of these every October. Wouldnt want to make a session beer out of them."
"D. Drikable. Not a superseet malty beer like some other Octoberfests. A well balanced beer. Good Octoberfest, but not one of my favorites."
"Pours dark golden with very little head. Smells malty, but with a larger hop presence than is usual for the style. not unpleasant, but a little different. the taste could have some more robust maltiness, but its not flabby at all, with a clean, firm edge to it from the hops. a little light, and a bit nutty in the finish. I enjoyed this to start, but I got a little tired of it by the time I was finished. not bad, but a little too far out of the style guidelines to work- its too soft for a hoppier beer and too hoppy for a Marzen. Okay."
"A light brownish-orange color with a decent white head to start but not much lace in the long run. The aroma is mostly hops and while it's not bad it's not quite great. Could have used more malt. Same goes with the flavor but for the most part it's blended a lot better and the malt steps forward a little bit more. Good carbonation and well-integrated bitterness makes this one particularly refreshing. One of the better Octobers I've had this year and another solid effort from Bell's."
"D - This isn't a bad beer by any means, but it's definitely an American bastardization of the style. It could stand a more complex malt body and some toning down of the hops. For someone who prefers a hoppier beer, it could be just right. Otherwise, it's pretty easy to drink, but I feel like I have to shave off half a point for style guidelines."
"This Oktoberfest pours a clear, dark amber that is almost copper with a decent pale tan head. Aroma is malty and just a little spicy. Mouth-filling malty flavor has hint of hop bitterness and a touch of cloves. Rich, lively texture leaves a nice spicy finish."
"This would be a decent session beer, but there are far too many other Bell's offerings that I would take over this one."
"Hey, how can you not enjoy a little [sweet, yeasty aroma] with a freaking match in his mouth and a wearing a pair of aviators spouting lines like, ""You're a disease, and I'm the cure?""? Also, I love how people rip on how over-the-top and phony [American Octoberfest beers] are with all the [toasted malt and honey flavor] and the one-man-gang takedowns of entire armies (composed of the same five guys getting killed in different fashions). What makes me laugh is that today's [fall beers] are no more [smooth and drinkable]. Have you seen anything with [pumpkin] in it? [Drinking] these [beers] too much could make anyone believe in the freaking Easter Bunny! Anyway if you haven't [tasted Bell's Octoberfest], please check it out."
"Not one of the better efforts as far as an Oktoberfest goes, but it is ok."
"Drinkabiliys moderae to low. This beer had a lot of good things going for it, but it falls flat s soon as it hits the tongue. It loked and smeled like a good o'fest, but the taste just wasn't quite there for me."
"D- Easily drinkable with a nice flavor. One of the better Oktoberfest beers that I have had."
"Bottle poured into a pint glass. A medium amber color, translucent and fizzy. Smell is sweet: caramel and sugars. Taste is very sweet as well.. lots of ""breadiness"" to this one, with a slight bitterness at the finish. Pretty light bodied without any overwhelming characteristics, this is a great easy drinking fall beer."
"Overall an interesting marzen. I gotta give it props for having a load of flavor which is something that seems to be lacking in the style. However the flavor is a bit over the top for my taste when drinking a traditional oktoberfest."
"This may not be the most to-style Octoberfest out there, but who cares - it's damn good. Do yourself a favor and try one."
"Bell's rarely disappoints. This is the best octoberfest I've had so far this season(I know, it's early) Pours a glowing orange amber with a rich, frothy head. Perfect carbonation. The taste has the right amount of malt with subtle peppery spice. I had this just after a leinenkugel octoberfest and Bell's was far superior. I could drink this one all night."
"D - I expected more from Bell's. It's probably one of their weaker beers but still a solid offering. The grassy hops are killing me here but it's a great fall beer nonetheless. Not something I'd rush out for again but good either way."
"D= An extremely sessionable beer - one of my favorite Oktoberfests of 2009."
"An excellent Oktoberfest. Easily drinkable, and a good introduction to fall."
"The bottom line is that this beer could have a lot more ""oompf"" than it has, but it is a decent offering."
"So to sum: Bell's Octoberfest is just shy of being superb and it's a crime the score on this site is so low. I rate fairly and my ratings are correct. Eat your heart out, Joe."
"Bell's Octoberfest Beer pours a clear, coppery-golden color with a thin, white head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is malty, slightly toasted, with a hint of sweetness to it. Flavors are also malty with a slight bitterness, and very refreshing with light carbonation. The hops are there, but very subtle and understated. Perhaps too much so. Overall a very drinkable beer, but not outstanding. It goes well with a steamy Florida summer night."
"We had this beer on tap at Bells. It is a lovely orange super clear beer with a white head. If I had one serious quibble with the beer, it's the aroma. Oktoberfest lagers are supposed to be fairly clean with no hint of esters or diacetyl. And, unfortunately this one had a very powerful ester aroma that was not appropriate for the style. I also felt it was hopped to have a noticeable hop taste which isn't appropriate for the style. It's a good beer but I didn't feel it was a good Oktoberfest. Otherwise it was a drinkable beer, and definitely had a lot of merit on it's own."
"Quality stuff... Recommended..."
"Seriously, a B- average? This is hands-down the best Oktoberfest I've had. Rather than coat my mouth with candy-like caramel flavors, Bell's has gone a more traditional route and focused on the toasty flavors."
"D: High on the list of beers I could do in a session this fall but the lack of a stable aftertaste will keep me away."
"On tap at Pracna on Main for their Oktoberfest flights. Had this along with 10 other Oktoberfest beers and I felt this one was in the top five of all of them. May not say much, but I enjoyed it. Typical burnt orange color for this style, minimal head and lace. Subtle smell of malt. Sweet malt taste with some caramel and maybe a hint of spice. Not great, but still enjoyable. A little thin on the mouthfeel. Not too bad of a beer."
"A decent offering but nowhere near as good as I remembered it in the bottle. It is very drinkable but it is rather boring."
"I really like Bell's beers and the O-fest style. but his combination left me a little deflated."
"I really had expected more from this one. A rare miss from Bell's in my opinion."
"i was a bit let down with this. i hate knocking a beer and i love bells but there was nothing dominant about this, nothing really stood out. im pretty sure this is rather fresh as we JUST started getting their oktoberfest this year."
"I'm not the biggest fan of the style, but even within the style, this is not the best beer. I expected more from Bells, a brewery that has become one of my favorites. Not their finest offering, thats for sure."
"The mouth is a little thinner than I'd like, but there's some touches of carbonation bite in and out. Flavors of fresh bread, grassy hops, and light spices make up this one. This is a pretty decent Festbier. I'd have it again."
"Drinkability: 'Tis the season! A pleasant, easily drinkable beer and a decent example of the style."
"This isn't a Märzen and this isn't a pumpkin ale, so why does Bells label this as an Oktoberfest beer? When it comes to seasonal beers, especially Oktoberfest, I expect something other than the standard fair of beer. If this is what Bells considers Oktoberfest then I must say it's a muted, almost unreasonable beer. I suppose I can't really say it's a letdown as from previous experience with Bells I haven't found a single style that they excel at. This is just another beer that I feel is a result of the craft beer explosion in which hype matters more than product."
"Overall this was a lackluster attempt at the style from a brewery that doesn't usually miss hitting the nail on the head. The flavors don't pop enough and it just doesn't have enough body."
"Poured a nice light copper color, not as deep as I like, but with a little bit of head; no lacing. Nice scent, malty with a nice hint of leaves, but again, not as deep as I'd like. Good flavor, nice malt deepness, a slight burnished flavor to it. Goes down quite well."
"Drink I could have a lot of these. It isn't a real strong tasting beer but has a good amount of flavor and is very smooth. I liked it a lot."
"D - A really nice Oktoberfest. I could drink a sixer of these really easily."
"Drinkability: Pretty high. Not my favorite marzen in the group so far, but definitely tasty and a little unique amongst the rest."
"There is not much in the way of body to this beer, seems a tad watery on the tongue, and a touch flat overall. Not a great representation of this style, at least not compared to other Oktoberfests that I have consumed. Very rarely does Bell's let me down....this is one of those times. :("
"I don't know which beer they were describing in the commercial description, but it's not this one. I personally prefer the old red/vienna malt lagers of the traditional okfest/marzens. This one is a lighter amber tending yellow. Does have a nice white head and plenty of lace. Good malty aroma. Ditto flavor. Nice body. Good finish, but nothing exceptional. Ok fest beer for this year I guess. Session beer."
"Poured a crystal clear amber with a moderate head that quickly reduced to a threadbare skin. The aroma is slightly malty. Not much taste at first (45 degree), but got a malty sweetness and nutty as it warmed. Mouth feel was light bodied with good carbonation. Quite drinkable, great for those frosty Oktober evenings in Württemberg, or wherever. Tasty when it warms, otherwise, average."
"Overall, a pretty good beer. I'm not a huge fan of the style but I figured I would support my state by buying Bell's Octobefest."
"Appearance is standard for the style, nose does not produce anything even remotely interesting. A bit of mettalic hops taste on the finish. Medium malt backbone and a thin mouthfell round out a dissapointing beer form a brewery that normally nails it."
"A very well made, flavorful example of an octoberfest. I would definately pick this up over a lot of others."
"Drinkability: It's a fine beer, but the taste is the strong point to it as the other aspects don't really measure up overall and it falls a tad short; the ABV is mild enough and it's certainly refreshing, so I could easily get through a couple of these in a night if necessary."
"Not light but not quite medium bodied either. Carbonation is on par. Wouldn't turn this down on a fall day, but hopefully I find some better representations of the style. Expect better from Bell's."
"drinkability is decent. not the best marzen, and a bit stale on the palate. could be better, but still not a bad brew."
"D: Decent beer from Bell's expected much more."
"D - This is a nice Octoberfest. Yet another worthy brew from Bell's."
"clear amber, minimal off-white head. aroma is nutty, caramelly malts with some grassy and spicy notes underneath. light to medium bready malt sweetness is not quite cleared out by the underlying hop bitterness. light to medium in body, smooth. could use a bit more carbonation maybe? very drinkable at this abv, a decent representation of the american style o-fest."
"Drinkability: Decent somewhat sweet lager, but a fairly weak example of a Marzen. C'mon Larry, you can do better."
"Bell's octoberfest is a clear gollden bodied beer with a two finger thick khaki head that leaves decent lacing. The aromas are malty, sweet and bready. The flavor matches with a decent bittering to acheive balance and drinkability. Notes of caramel coated fresh baked bread come with warming. Creamy mouthfeel. Enough carbonation to keep it from being sticky. A great beer for a cool fall day."
"Overall, this is my favorite American-made Oktoberfest bier. I was turned onto Bell's about 1.5 years ago and have not been disappointed in anything so far. Do yourself a favor and pick up many of these. Prosit!!"
"A nicely balanced brew that I really enjoyed."
"light and fruity flavors with some very subtle malt elements. an interesting raisiny sweetness is detectable from the confluence of malt and hop. the finish is not good and the brew is very light on the tongue. too much so, actually, as there is little lingering of the flavors, which are decent, to be fair, but the whole beast is too anemic for me to make a good autumn lager. ultimately the experience fades unceremoniously; certainly the driest oktoberfest i have sampled to date"
"Really plain beer, I'm a little surprised from Bell's, they usuallly produce"
"D- Good dirinkablity, however this seems more like a summer refresher rather than a rich full bodied fall oktoberfest."
"D: Refreshing, maybe good for a hot October, but not for me."
"Not the biggest on this style, but the beer is very drinkable for the style. Not terrible, but far from awesome."
"D= awesome. Super delicious beer. I don't know why it isn't higher rated. Impressed me."
"The beer is very drinkable, but by far not my favorite Octoberfest I have had this season."
"was in my local beer store today and bells octoberfest was on the shelf i bought a single and was glad i only purchased 1... it pours a slightly hazy off orange color with the typical big head that bell brews has ... the smell was ok it was stale and musty smelling the taste was malty with spice and hops... im not impressed at all its ok will not buy again bells needs to rework this marzen its just not good..year after year... i also think bells has become to big and expanded to to many states and has become a macro/micro brewery and has lost some of their small batch quality not drinking to much of their brews like i used to"
"Overall- I've been kinda disappointed with bells lately. this years batch of Octoberfest is definitely better then last years. i noticed they've been changing it over the years. last year it was 5abv and was terrible!! then the year before that (07) was around high 5's abv and was amazing. i'm not saying higher the abv the better but for this case it is."
"D: Easy to drink but not something I will pick up again."
"D -- Drinkability is good, but my overall impression of the beer to style is a little too hoppy. Albeit, very nice noble hop character, it seems to be a typical American micro take on the style. I'd have preferred more Munich malt with a sweeter character, but the freshness of this beer stands tall."
"Drinkability: I liked this one, but with a catch. I do not feel this is a good session beer. It's good to have one, maybe two, and then move on. This is a good beer, in small quantities."
"Pours a very light brown/yellowish color. Smells a little bit of roasted malts and tastes pretty much the same. Doesn't have much of a hoppy taste at all. It goes down very smooth. The first half of my glass tasted watered down but it filled out towards the bottom of the glass."
"Pours a golden amber in color. Ring of head around the perimeter of the glass. Malt's in the nose as well as what smells like some sort of corn base. Taste is huge on the malts with just a hint of hops to balance it out. Some signs of toffee. Easy drinking and slightly unimpressive."
"Looking forward to trying the brew fresh when it comes around again."
"D: Easy drinking. Solid O-Fest."
" A pretty orangish pour,with a thin head. Aromaof sweet caramel, and lightly toasted malt.Flavor was buttery,toffee,some faint hops,and spices, well-balanced, with a thin body,very drinkable.Not as good as I expected but still a solid offering."
"That was on 12/22/2008. On the new batch, 2010, this beer has gotten far worse. The aroma is of cracker malt and almost an adjunct note, much like the nose of a yuengling or coors original, but with a little more biscuit and a hint of outhouse. Flavour is not better. tastes adjunct-ish, with stale crackers and stale hops. This is just bad. Drain pour. Come on, Bell's."
"D: Definitely sessionable though I think I prefer the Sam Adams Octoberfest overall a bit more."
"Orange pour, quite fluffy whitish head. A good amount of carbonation in this one, but not overly offensive. Standard malt and caramel sweetness. Light/med bodied with some biscuit/breadiness. Hopping cuts down the sweetness pretty well. I'd say this is sessionable if not quite drinkable. One of the very few Octoberfests I cared for this year. Worth trying, a slightly above average take on the style."
"D - Ok. Will I seek this out again. No. Not because it wasn't good, but because it is not my preferred style. Nice lower alcohol content. Wish I liked it."
"Overall this is an ok representation of the style, and a decent beer, but probably not an okto i would revisit, as oktoberfest should really be a sessionable beer, and this one i find to be just a bit too odd to session regularly. Certainly not a bad beer, it just needs some minor adjustments. Try it, its pretty good."
"This beer is very average, there are much better Oktoberfest beers around, and this is one I can not recommend under any conditions."
"Poured into a pint glass a clear med amber with a hint of orange with a 1 in head that quickly disappeared. Malty, semi-sweet aroma with a hint of spice. Flavor was not as sweet as I expected with a stronger hop influence than I was looking for and a little 'off' at the finish. I've had a few different Bells beers and this one just isn't up to their standards. Overall just a very average Marzen"
"Kind of disappointing, mix a generic malt profile with subpar hops and smudge the details, charge a little too much and here we are. One was plenty... a slightly below average Octoberfest."
"Not offensive, but not a great oktoberfest either. Maybe my bottle was slightly off?"
"Drinkability: Very easy drink. Will definitely seek this out next year."
"Pours a very clear golden copper color with 2 fingers of big foamy white head that fades quickly leaving some spotty lacing. Smells fruity up front, like apricot and oranges, then some floral hops, caramel, and toasted grainy malt. Tastes of honey, orange and grapefruit juice up front, then some cereal and doughy bread malt mixed with caramel, finishes with some bitter grassy notes. Medium in body with moderately high carbonation. Sweet and toasty, smooth, with a metallic bitterness in the finish. A good sessionable lager, but different enough from others in the style that this isn't what I'd grab first if I wanted an Oktoberfest ."
"D_A fairly decent Oktoberfest. The potential to be great is there but the flaws prevent it. Still I did enjoy it and would go back for another as it still manages to trump some of the less malty versions of the style."
"D- Sure you could drink a few, but I poured mine down the drain."
"It's an easy drink but only a so-so Marzen."
"Overall I thought it is a very good Octoberfest, though maybe not the best American example I've had."
"D: A decent session beer, not my top choice, but a solid offering."
"Overall not a bad beer by any aspect, just expected a little bit more out of Bell's to be honest. Still though I would not turn my nose up at this one, even though I cannot say it was much more then average."
"D: This is a pretty good Octoberfest beer. Maybe not as hearty as some examples from the Fatherland but rewarding nonetheless."
"Medium body, low carbonation. Pretty simple and easy to drink. Not bad."
"Eric"
"D: A good but not great oktoberfestbier. The maltiness is a little too much."
"This poured a clear, dark gold with white head. It smelled like robust caramel malt and cultured German yeast with sweet lemon hops. It tasted like cultured yeast and caramel malt with lemon hops, and a bit of barley and pumpkin spice. It was fairly thick with no carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was a clean and somewhat drinkable beer. It had good body, but I didn't particularly care for the flavor. I could still drink it, but this was not my favorite Octoberfest."
"D- I was a bit let down by this beer. It was fairly average for an American produced Oktoberfest beer. Would I order another? Probably not. But, it wasn't to the point where I refused to finish the beer."
"This was OK for the style but it was the little things lacking here and there that kept me from really liking this. Not bad but I expect a little more from Bell's."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Poured a medium foam head on a light amber body. Smells of sweetness, caramel, a touch of floral, and a whiff of hoppiness. Taste was along the same lines, with the hoppiness coming through at about medium. None of the flavors were remarkable, however. They're there, just not ""excitingly"". It has above average hcarbonation, but remains smooth a fairly easy to drink. A pretty good brew, easy enough to drink, but there are others in the style that are much better."
"I must say that I was pretty let down by this beer. It was good, and not terrible by any means, but it was simply average in every way. This beer could definitely use more toasted malt character. I hope they play with the recipe next year. There are all kinds of better Octoberfests out there."
"pours an extremely clear orange brown color with a semi sticky white head. Very slow rising carbonation. Spicy roasted malts in the nose, woody and musty. Very bright with flavor, dried fruits, cinnamon and peppery spice and nicely balanced. Good hoppy twang, and solid malt backbone. Nothing to write home about but damn this brew is drinkable as hell. Im loving it, highly recommended, wish we had some in NJ..."
"The beer tastes clean with roasted malt, barley and hops with citrus in the background. This is a well brewed beer that is very easy to drink."
"Drinkability- A smooth drinker for the swilling needs. I may get a sixer just to slam back on a bender. Taste fine for those purposes, but with that in mind, wouldn't it be a better deal to get a Sam Adams Oktoberfest twelve pack?"
"D - What this lacks in flavor it makes up for in drinkability. A very easy brew to handle, though I'm not sure why the alcohol is pulling through so much. I expected more from Bells, and for the price there are better marzens out there."
"Glad I could try this; it won't enter a regular, seasonal rotation, though."
"Overall, a great beer and defintely worth a try if you like Oktoberfests."
"I poured this bland tastless beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was a orangey looking color. The beer had a tan head while it was there the quickly ewent away. The beer was sour smelling slightly. I thought it was very tastless for an Octoberfest beer though a little fruity. I will not buy again."
"Even so, it's pretty good, regardless of how well it fits a style."
"The drink is medium-bodied with fine carbonation, feel, and drinkability."
"There is a combination of toasty biscuit malts, with a slight bit of hop aroma there as well. The beer is a copper colour with not much of a head. The flavour is really smooth with a nice bitterness to accompany the main flavour: toated malts. The toasted malts are definitely the main flavour in the beer; it's almost too much and hinders the balance of sweetness and toasted biscuit. A sweetness is also present, but it's more in the background. The mouthfeel is definitely watery. Pretty drinkable."
"D- I can't believe how big and thick and malty this is for 5%. One of the better fests I have had this year."
"D - This is a decent overall oktoberfest beer that I could fathom drinking a sixer of, as long as I don't spill it like I did while reviewing it."
"D: High, this is a very good Octoberfest in my book. If you read my reviews, you know I love hops so this Ofest fits my likes exactly. Very good beer, I would drink this again and will probably seek it out. Bells does it again."
"D: Goes down fairly easily and something i can drink very easily but not the best marzen out there"
"Pours a clear orange with a slight head that falls quickly. Ever so faint malt aroma. The flavor displays mild malt, with a little bit floral hops on the back. The mouthfeel is thin and inoffensive. The beer did improve somewhat as it warmed, bringing out the malt and a little bit of hop bitterness, but this remains a merely OK beer."
"D: Oktoberfests rarely turn out great in my book, and this one fits the same bill. I'm not lusting after another, but it's a decent brew."
"Taste has dry malt with dull phenols and some clean alcohol. Malt is toasted with some tannic or astringent edge. Phenols are not quite clovey, more pumpkin pie spice. Aftertaste is mild drying phenol and acrid carbonation sting. Thin body and too strong of carbonation for the style and with the flavors, as stretched as thin as they are."
"Drinkability: Not one of the best I've had, and I'd expect better from Bell's, but it's pretty easy to drink, flavorful, and very nice for the season of course."
"Pretty average Oktoberfest."
"It's not a bad beer, but I've come to expect better from Bell's. This was just average by their standards."
"Clear amber with many bubbles fighting for the surface. The amber color was on the light side of amber. The head quickly fell into the glass. Slight fruity smell evident but not easy to detect. Taste was slighty toasted and malty and much like the smell with not alot of umph. Very carbonated with a light body. This wasn't bad but there are plenty of better options on the shelf."
"D: Not as solid as many other Bell offerings, which is surprising. Still drinkable, certainly, but not among the better of the style."
"Batch #8610. Poured a medium-hazy golden-amber with a small whithish head. Appears heavily carbonated and smells malty with perhaps a hint of caramel. It feels medium-thin-bodied in the mouth and comes out with a crisp malt finish. There isn't much to the flavor, but if you like a solid malt, then, by golly, this one's for you. Nothing to write home to mom about, but it seems alright for the style."
"This doesn't seem to have the usual craftsmanship and quality that Bell's put into their beer; this is watery with too much carbonation and a somewhat stale or sour tang to the taste. Malt body is decent but is laced with metal. This is a bit less polished than the average marzen. Not really something I'll look out for in the future."
"Honestly not as bad as I remember, but lacking in several area. A run of the mill oct fest that can easily be skipped for far better versions of the style"
"Decent overall beer, but nothing exciting. Not the best example of an Octoberfest/Marzen IMHO, but serviceable."
"D- Easy to drink but there are better examples of the style out there."
"Not a bad beer, but not anything special. If you are new to the style, it might be a good place to start."
"I already can't wait to have my second of the sixer. Great Beer."
"I was expecting a fuller flavor from this O-fest. Flavor is sweet, with subdued complexity. Initially I found this offering overly sweet and light in body. However, the more you drink the stronger the toasted malt and spicy hop becomes. That said, this is still a rather light, grainy O-fest. In the future I would probably pick something more robust."
"Drinkability is good. There is nothing dramatic about this beer. I would have liked a bit more bitterness in the finish but I would not turn down a few pitchers of this in a session with friends. A pretty good Oktoberfest."
"Could drink a few of these, not the best though."
"Pretty good Octoberfest if I say so myself. Nothing complex, just a good tasty brew perfect for the season."
"The mouthfeel was medium with moderate carbonation. This was incredibly creamy and smooth. Very sessionable indeed."
"Eh, this was all right. Nothing that really excited me, but a nice simple representation of the style. Bell's has better beers, but this was simple and solid."
"mouthfeel is crisp, very flavorful and good weight - nice overall. definitely what i would want in an octoberfest :D"
"I've had quite a few october fests this year from various brewers and this is undoubtedly one of the best Octoberfests out there."
"at the same time pretty refreshing and easy to drink."
"12 ounce bottle, Batch 8610, packaged on August 22, 2008. Served in a snifter, the beer pours an orange/amber color with an inch white head. Head retention is low, lacing is good. It smells like toasted malt, grassy hops, bread/cereal, and a little bit of apple. Taste is similar to (but a bit stronger than) the aroma, but there's also some caramel malt in the taste too. It is mostly malty, but does have a slight bitter hoppy aftertaste. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium and it has a bit above average carbonation. Drinkability is very good, it's quite sessionable as it's easy to drink and smooth. This is the first O-Fest beer I've had this year, and it's pretty decent. I'd buy this again the next time I'm in the mood for this style of beer."
"The carbonation is pretty heavy and the body is fairly light. Very juicy, very refreshing. This beer is easy to sip, but makes for a great session beer. I would not only get this again, but I would drink it year-round. A tremendous beer to say the least."
"Body pours to a perfect golden amber alost honey in color. Head is a fluffy tan biscuit that stands at two fingers but quickly fades to just a skim as I finish this sentence. Nose is a soft mineral snap of nutty hints and attractive maltiness. At first sip you cant help but thinking of yourself raising an oversized mug of this in the middle of a German festival singing and eating brats. Super smooth zesty maltiness that is a lot like a buttered bisciut with drizzled honey. A nutty metalic feel sticks to the top of the mouth. There is a slight nop of hops on the end of the palate but it is ever so brief. The malts really create a thick mouthfeel that is common to the style. Overall a good representation of the style Americanized."
"I really wouldn't consider this a true Maerzen, but it is a tasty beer. There is hardly any roasted aroma and no maltiness that makes this style so great. It is also a little high in the IBU department. Despite all that, there is a bit of flavoring and aroma hops present, just enough to make this beer very drinkable, especially at cellar temp. I guess I made the mistake of keeping the six pack in the fridge and not letting the first few bottles warm up enough, which made it taste a little too bitter. Drinking it at 50-55 degrees really improved my opinion of this beer."
"Prosit und Zum Wohl, MK"
"I Think we'll see a lot more of this in late 2008."
"Aftertaste is sweet and seems to be missing that strong maltiness. There is a toasted feel but I guess I was expecting more from a company that likes to push the envelope."
"D: Eh. Not too sure about this after taste. Its ok but not fitting the style well enough."
"One of the better american ofests, I recall it being even better on tap."
"As a disclaimer, I am not much of an Ofest fan. I like the SA version and this one isnt bad, but this isnt a style I search out."
"D - overall a decent enough Marzen/Oktoberfest style beer, not exceptional, but well done though"
"This is one of my personal favorite Oktoberfest beers. It is very easy to drink, with it's full, malty flavor backed with a noticeable hop presence. It is well built and certainly fits the style. I could have a few of these at a time."
"Overall, pretty tasty. I enjoyed this and felt it had good balance, nice flavor, and was easy to drink. It wasn't the most complex beer I've ever had, but I don't think that was what they were shooting for. Very sessionable."
"Pours a clear orange/copper color with a medium off-white head that has decent retention. Spotty lacing throughout with a thin ring at the top. The aroma is mostly malty with touches of sweet spice and hops. Medium body with roasted malt, caramel and hops flavors. The finish is malty and nutty at first with a lightly peppered hops aftertaste. Pretty simple for a Bells beer quite honestly. Average overall."
"Given the taste bud saturating excellence that Bell's usually delivers, Octoberfest Beer is a disappointment. Maybe it's my big beer bias, but when it comes to this style, heartier (maltier) is almost always better. Two Heartier (hoppier) wouldn't be too bad either."
"D- Interesting, and great mouthfeel. I'll probably have it again when the season rolls around."
"Copper/orange color with a white cap that fades pretty quickly. Complex nose of florals, soft to bright fruits, orange cream, vanilla, banana, and light caramel. Nutty earthy malty grains balanced well by hop flavors of orange citrus, slightly tangy, tea herbals and some spicy to bitter notes lay on the tongue just before it finishes. Mild to medium carbonation is just crisp enough, mouthfeel is thin but is a nice smoothness. The finish is dryer, grainy, and some tart that all hangs around long enough for the next sip. A very quaffable fall selection."
" ~ This is the last of my six pack and I am glad I made this purchase. I will certainly give this beer the thumbs up to any friend looking to try a quality Oktoberfest."
"A nice suppin' ale, that's for sure."
"O'all - A nicely balanced, malt oriented beer. The slightly bitter finish might annoy after a while, but it does keep it from becoming sickenly sweet."
"well, most everything bell's is usually a hit with me, but i'd say this one is a miss. the extra eight bucks a case over the other o-fests definitely isn't worth it. there are better offerings to be had. this one ranks with leinenkugel's o-fest and michelob marzen when it comes to being uninspired."
"Overall: a simple, quite drinkable beer. Not exactly packed with flavor, not some grandiose experience, but not much to turn you off about it. It went well with a piece of pumpkin chocolate chip bread."
"d-one of my favorite octoberfest beers, i will def have this again, will be looking for it on tap"
"I was disappointed in this offering. I've had plenty of great Bell's beers in the past and this was quite a letdown. Flavors were off and rather unenjoyable for an Oktoberfest beer. I kind of wish I didn't waste the money on a six pack of it."
"The mouthfeel is thin and crisp. Good balance between sweetness, toastiness, and bitter hops. Could stand to be just a tad bit more drinkable, but it was worth trying."
"Overal a nice American O'fest, better than most of the US O'fest but still not up there with the originals from Munich."
"Overall- I thought it was a very solid representation of the style. While it didn't do a lot to set its self apart from other versions, I'd rank it up there with my other favorites from both American and German brewers."
"This beer started out pretty good for me with a nice gold to amber color and 1"" tanish foam head. Aroma was more of overdone toast not the bready melnoidans of better oktos. Aftertaste left an undesirable bitterness or flavor that shouldn't have been there either, and was more noticeable in the last quarter of the glass. I'd say mouthfeel was as it should be, just a little on the thick side. All in all Bells makes mostly great beers, this is just not one of them."
"At 5% this is an easy one to have a bunch of."
"D: Enjoyable fal offering from Bell's -- very smooth and builds some uniqueness into the classic marzen style."
"The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and the adequate carbonation gives it an excellent crisp feel. An awesome drinker here. I dont know if it would ever get old before spring came around."
"Hazy blazing orange. (Of course it's not clear...it's Bell's!) Thin dirty white head. Little retention. Lace is sporadic. Really nice aroma. I like the emphasis on the toasted malt qualities on the nose. I also get some biscuit malt and a little caramel malt as well. The malts lay a pretty solid foundation. The toasted character isn't quite as prominent as it was on the nose, but it's there with the usual suspects (biscuit, caramel and yeasty doughiness). Carbonation lends a bit of a fizzy attribute to this medium bodied lager. Not a particularily bold Ofest, but enjoyable nonetheless."
"While this may be a very sessionable beer, it's because there is not much flavor here and it's lacking the character one would expect for an Oktoberfest. Overall though, it serves it's purpose...one could easily down a 6'er of these without much of a problem. Easy drinking."
"that . Get it while you can, it's a good one!"
"D - Disappointing, especially for Bell's tasty lineup."
"In reviewing this beer, I have to keep in mind that a Marzen is one of the original session beers, and, consequently, must be relatively easy-going. This beer does a nice job of managing to be interesting, and yet very mellow. Perhaps just a touch on the timid side - I'd like to see a bit more maltyness, but the drinkability is very good."
"Overall impression: A bit light for my tastes - doesn't quite have the malt backbone I would expect in an Oktoberfest. Despite this, it is highly drinkable and interesting enough that I'm sure I won't have a problem finishing the 6er."
"Pours an orange/copper color with a fluffy white head. The head doesn't hang around for long and there isn't much lacing. It smells like bread and yeast but it is really subdued. The taste is of sweet malt and bread. Not much else there. Decent carbonation but it has thin mouthfeel. If there was such a thing as Light Oktoberfest beer this would be it. Very sessionable but not big on flavor. Would make a good beer garden offering."
"Another good offering from Bells. Keep up the good work."
"Don't drink and review."
"A lighter style o-fest. If you're looking for a big malty, rich, big o-fest this isn't it. This is subtle, but tasty in its own way. Personally I would chose several others in the future over this because I prefer a bigger o-fest but I could see this appealing to a lot of people looking for something a little lighter."
"Medium body, a decent beer, easy to drink, but nothing special for the style."
"D: Even for a subtle style like a marzen, this beer seemed to lack a personality of its own, which is unexpected from a brewery like Bell's. Nevertheless, it could be a lot worse. This one is easily drinkable, but there's not enough excitement to keep you coming back."
"This is one of my least favorite releases from Bell's. It's just very ho-hum compared to their other releases. It could stand a little hop punch and more flavor overall. It's not a bad beer, but it is a letdown considering it is Bell's after all."
"Pours a clean, pale orange-ish color with an off white head. Aromas that are earthy and somewhat fruity. In the taste, some of the same, earthy and hints of fruit, but not overbarring. A very smooth mouthfeel and a dry sweetness of an aftertaste. Not a typical Oktoberfest, but a nice twist, easy and tasty."
"A nice, straight-to-style type of beer, but a little ordinary in the whole scheme of Oktoberfests. Standard orange / copper color with terrific head retention and brilliant clarity. Aromas are malty, hopped for balance, and a touch of caramel malt -- all coming together quite well. Flavors are bready and rich, with hops off-setting the sweetness, and contributing a light grassy flavor. Textures are firm and creamy, providing a firm pillow for the mellow flavors and spices. Finishes with a mild dry, hop finish. Good beer, but likely gets lost in the shuffle."
"D - A very quaffable lighter version of an Octoberfest. A crisp, clean finish makes it easy to have multiples, but not a very flavorful fest overall."
"Tried a ""normal"" non-German octoberfest to give me a reference point for Surlyfest. This wasn't as sweet as I remember most other octoberfest beers."
"Drinkability: this would be a great session o'fest for a tailgate before a football game on a cool day. Very enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This brew is full bodied with lower carbonation as befits the style. It drinks easy and is a good session beer, though there are better brews that depict the style better, also better brews out there that not only depict the style but add their own flair to it as well."
"D - I could drink this all day. Solid O-fest."
"The bottom line: An ok take on the Oktoberfest style by Bell's. I didn't think that this beer did anything particularly memorable though."
"On tap at Ashley's in Ann Arbor,poured into a standard pint a clear medium copper with a decent but quick to fade head,caramel and sweet dough mainly in the nose a bit toastiness not much detectable hop presence.Flavors are somewhat sweet upfront with some real caramel and sweet dough coming thru a firm toastiness held up well to the sweetness a bit of spicy hop dried it out a bit in the finish.A bit middle of the road not bad and its drinkable just not earth shattering."
"Overall a fantastic take on the style. Not too sweet, not lacking in flavor...just wished it held-on a bit longer when it comes to the flavor/mouthfeel experience. I like to savor my O'Fests, while this one begs gulp after to gulp to savor IMHO. But then again, if that's what most people thought (and I was the brewer), I would be very happy, as the sales would be steady. Great O'Fest that I'll put on my 'to buy' list every year. Good job Larry & Co. !"
"Dark gold into orange color, small white head disappears fairly quickly. Sweet, grainy scent. Slightly fruity, caramel malt with strong grain overtones on the taste. Some slight bitter hop taste in the backround. Touch of alcohol. Creamy mouth. I could drink these until I forget my name."
"NASTY"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Appearance is a clear caramel-hued golden light brown, with an off white fizzy head that quickly dissipated to a whitish film with moderate lacing that clings to the glass. Aroma is light, sweet caramel/toffee notes, roasted malts make up the body of this brew. Taste is also light, sweet maltiness, caramel and toffee again, light grassy hoppiness also present. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean, light bodied, lower levels of carbonation. Drinkability is good, but mainly due in fact to the beer's lighter characteristics and it's 5% ABV. Overall a solid session O'fest, but a little sweeter and not malty enough in my opinion. Would consider purchasing again, wouldn't necessarily seek out."
"* If you want an all around amazing Oktoberfest try the Great Lakes!"
"This brew pours a clear golden color with stunning amber hues. The head is large, fluffy, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of bready malts, and noble hops, but is somewhat faint and simple. The taste is like the aroma. It has a nice bready backbone, but the hops are very light and bitterness is low. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation, and a velvety smoothness. Overall, this is a pleasant beer to drink, but it lacks any sort of complexity. It is an odd thing for Bell's to make a beer that I don't love, but they did so here. I could drink it again, but I don't think I will."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink but not wowing and a touch sweet for not having much oomph."
"Recommended"
"This beer poured a clear copper color and formed a foamy white head that left little lace as it subsided. An aroma of malt, hops, and caramel. The flavor was of malt, caramel with a hint of pepper. It has a slightly creamy medium light body and a hint of sweetness in a finish. Not bad for the style."
"Got this one cause I haven't had a Bell's beer yet that didn't impress. Pours a deep orange color with a finger of white head that dissolves to little puddles of white foam on top. Looks solid, although it's nothing to write home about. Nose is mostly light caramel malt and some fruity, drying hops as well. A little grainy. Taste is interesting, although maybe because I haven't had too many Octoberfests. Some dry, roasted malt, and some breadiness. Also a bit of spiciness, and maybe a touch of molasses or brown sugar. There's a light hint of hops at the tail end of this one, but it's definitely dominated by malt. Feel is medium bodied with solid carbonation. This one's okay; I'll need to try more of the style to see if it's better or worse than whatever else is out there."
"Not my favorite example of the style out there, but this is not a bad beer by any means. A bit too bready at times, but on the whole an entirely drinkable beer. I love Bell's, and they do some excellent beers, so it's nice to see them trying out new seasonal stuff."
"Its a nice light amber copper color with a two finger head that dissipated quickly. Crystal clear. The beer's aroma is exceedingly bready and slightly yeasty. The slight fruit aromas I get are of the German hops, but the aroma of them isn't strong. The taste starts off with the bready yeast flavor but turns into sweet malts, toasty and slightly solvently. The mouth feel is light and crisp up front. It smooths out as it moves along, and has a slight residual bitterness right all the way through to the finish. All in all, an Oktoberfest, a nice plate of light cheddar maybe, or some bavarian pretzels would be a nice compliment."
"Mouthfeel is sweet up front, medium bodied, doughy, and semi-dry."
"Amber/caramel clear with sheet of white on top. Easy, steamy pale malt aromas scented with moist vegetation and cereal. Workable, watery texture punctuated with fizz and oily bitterness that provide definition for apple, straw and green plum tartness. Overall, a drinker. I want just a little more texture and viscosity."
"Pours a clear as day copper with a fluffy head that dies quick. Smells of bread and grain. Tastes as it smells, bread, grain, some very mild sweetness and tiny bite at the finish. Feels medium to light in the mouth with good carbonation. Goes down very easy. A tasty Octoberfest brew but nothing that stands out."
"Pours a golden color with a bubbly white head that lingers and slowly fades away. Smell is grains, rice, and a maltiness. Taste is Sweet and smooth with some spices. Limited carbonation on this one makes for a crisp smooth drink. Nice offering, and look forward to drinking the rest."
"Bell's Oktoberfest was a pretty good representation of the style. Didn't have that high, craggy head that the great German Ofests do, but had some nice malts, could've used a few more, very smooth with a slight hoppy kickback. Highly drinkable on a fall night. Some slight caramel flavoring and a nice orangish/brown color. An overall decent interpretation of an Oktoberfest."
"Overall, one of the better octoberfest beers I've had. Very sessionable and enjoyable."
"D- A great sessionable beer. This is fall in the bottle. Another worthwhile addition to Bell's line-up."
"D: This is a great light autumn brew. Very delicate, but very pleasing. Nothing to be searched for, but it is a good buy if you're looking of something new."
"Overall, this was a very respectable octoberfest. It seemed a bit disappointing at first but it opened up towards the end. It definitely strays a bit from the authentic German style though."
"Drinkability: You can pound these back all night."
"Originally reviewed on December 9, 2006. On tap at the Downtowner Lounge - Houghton, MI. This keg has probably been on for a good while, as this isnt the type of bar where people would drink this beer. I was quite glad to still find this on tap, it seems to be a rather rare Bells draft, despite having been released throughout the state. Lemon fringed with an orange core, creamy froth of off-white. Light wispy aroma of creamy malts and light oatiness. A touch of graininess. Sweet sugary, lightly estered malt, with some barnyard oat qualities and a touch of hay. Not as much of the heavy Munich malt character as I expected from the style. Backend presents a slightly sourish, lemon tang and a nip of aged yeast. I can tell this keg has been on for a while, but it doesnt seem to detract. The smack is one of the more profound of any beer Ive had for a good while. A long lingering, clean mint and lemon bite, that hangs out along with a jumble of barnyard, sweet malt esters and clear mid-roasted unfermented crystal character. An interesting rendition, in my opinion. Im sure why everyone else has this beer so down. I enjoyed it quite a bit. Nicely refreshing and light."
"Must remember to stop comparing perfectly fine examples of a style against those versions that skirt outside the boundaries."
"12 oz pour. From notes. The beer was a mild golden color with a small head that fell to a small island over top of the brew. Clarity was fantastic and a mild carbonation was present cascading towards the surface. Good looking, but maybe a touch light in color. Aroma was grainy, fairly light with a mild bready sweetness in the background. Flavor was very bready with mild sweetness and toastyness. The grainyness was pretty full in there, and a mild bitterness hit on the finish. I thought it was tasty. Mouthfeel was a solid moderate with a light carbonation that gives the brew the feel of more thickness than it truly had. Overall, I liked the brew. It was a little more grainy than I would have liked and the nose was lighter than expected, but it was an enjoyable beer."
"drinkability: easy drinking"
"Appearance is slightly clouded copper with a large off white head leaves a collar of lace dwindles down and leaves behind specks of lacing. Aroma has fruity caramel sweet bready mix from the malt profile with a slight spicy character with bitey, grassy noble hop presence, seems a bit muted even after warming the brew for a little in my hands. Taste has a light noticeable alcohol note with creamy light fruty subtle caramel malt flow light bitterness with a quality overal mix of flavors finishes like a light herbal tea. My excitement exceeded the actual experience of trying this brew, I'm a pretty much overall Bell's fan but this one left me wanting a bit more flavor. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation somewhat creamy textured with mild prickly bubbles hitting the palate. Drinkability is pretty good overall but due to the somewhat lack of flavor I'd much rather go with a Penn or Great Lakes Octoberfest brew. Nice to see a cloudy fest and I will drink it again, but I was under wowed by it."
"I really like the Bell's beer,this one was just a little disapointing to me."
"I had this beer today over dinner with the family. I have been drinking a lot of Oktoberfest of late and looked forward to this offering from Bells. I had a pint on tap, it was a pleasing amber with a thin head with slight lacing. The flavor of the beer was a bit mild and lacking for my taste. I have been drinking German Oktoberfests and am unsure if i am spoiled or what. It is a good enough beer but there are better choices out there."
"This was the only thing on tap I had not had at the exchequer pub in down town, so I tried it. I have to admit I wasnt able to spend as much time on this one as I do with most. Simply because I was with company, however I did make some quick mental notes during the course of my meal. It had a decent head not too wild. Looked like a lager with a slightly more caramely tarnished color. Smell was subtle hints of spice, hay maybe and some sweet malt. Taste was decent, some caramel, a little hops, kind malt and spice. Again I didnt get to spend too much time with this, but over all I thought it was a decent seasonal beer. Mostly likely I would not buy a bottle until I've had a couple more Oktoberfests for referance, but if it was at a fest and cheep I might go for it right away."
"Moderate mouth with just enough carbonation. Its drinkable and could make for a good dinner beer, but it is a rather standard Okto fest and I wouldn't go to any great lengths to seek this one."
"This pours a hazy amber color, with a substantial yellowish white head and leaves substantial lacing on the glass. The smell is the least pleasant thing about this beer-there is a distinct sulfery odor. Thankfully, there is no trace of that in the taste. There is a distinctly grassy flavor, along with a creamy caramel blast at the finish. The mouthfeel is nicely rich and the only thing hampering the drinkability is the aforementioned smell. A very nice Octoberfest."
"Creamy carbonated mouthfeel. Easily drinkable."
"On tap at Ashley's in Ann Arbor. Solid gold orange clear body with a small, but persistent, off-white head. Nice fall weather for drinking this baby outside I might add. Cookie dough malt nose mixes with grassy vegetables and spicy hops. Bursting with juicy cookie malt sweetishness. Peppery spicy hop bitterness fills in the finish. Creamy, moderate body that goes down too easily."
"Pours a nice burnt orange and light coppery color with a small off white head. Aroma is a lightly sweet maltiness mixed with cooked grains, there is also a little earthy-grassiness. Taste follows the aroma with a gentle malty sweetness that is smooth on the palette and is followed by a nice and light peppery-spicey hoppiness. The beer is very creamy and soft and I found the sweetness to be light and not overpowering and well balanced by the subtle spice and dryness from the hops. I could easily see myself sessioning this and was wishing Bell's had to go containers available as I left."
