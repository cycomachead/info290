4.25,12.4,,,,,,"Pours a slighty hazy dark amber in color with a thin off-white cap that settles down to just the sides of the glass for the most part. Some ring-like lacing is seen when sipped that slides back down the sides of the glass. The aroma is of caramel and roasted malts with a hint of candied fruit. Bit more going on with the taste as there is some very light spice(?) with some sweetness. Pretty smooth for this style of brew. Goes down easy with no bitter or harsh aftertaste. Medium-bodied with lower carbonation (a good thing actually). A tasty seasonal brew that I really liked. PROST!","BeerWithMike","Nov 29, 2014"

Aromas of raisin, caramel, apple, molasses, toast, bread, toffee, pear, light nuttiness, and light herbal. Nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of caramel, raisin, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, molasses, toffee, and herbal. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, molasses, raisin, toffee, and herbal on the finish for a bit. Very nice flavor balance and robustness; zero cloying flavors on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Oktoberfest. Well balanced robust flavors, and very smooth to drink. I have a feeling that this was a bottle from last year or older, but it held up nicely. Very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 29, 2012"

It is a beautiful beer - darker than most Oktoberfests with a rich creamy head. It smells of roasty caramel malt. It's taste is a bit more malty and caramelly and full flavor than most - not as nutty as most. I expect a tad more nuttiness in an Oktoberfest, but I am not dissapointed because I am nut inot the nutty thing. I am so primed after a long summer to malt it up.

Flavor has some pumpernickel bread character initially, along with pretzel, toffee, brown sugar, earthy hops, a little musk and some alcohol.

If you happen to like dry or even near-numbing beers, then just consider this as having a tastefully complex finish. I on the other hand, unfortunately had to go back and knock 1/2 a point down in the mouth feel and thusly demote the grade of this beer.

At this time I noticed a steady stream of animation racing to the beige head. The foam was two fingers in height at the apex. Head retention was very good and after a few moments it began to fade to a bubbly cap. Subsequent lacing was skimpy but the cap lasted the whole consumption. It is a good-looking beer. Clean malty nose that is slightly toasty with a hint of caramel and grain; grassy hops are at the back. The bouquet says O-fest and that is all I need it to say. Above-average potency. Inviting. Sometimes a good thing can be so simple. The palate is very enjoyable; it is ideally clean but plenty flavorful. The malt comes across dry and toasty but with another layer, which is sweet caramel. Random hints of bready-biscuit are noticed as well. The hops do supply a crisp bitterness and offer a healthy dose of grassy, slightly earthy/spicy flavors. Very nice, from start to finish; there is good depth. I like the long taste as it leisurely tickles my tastebuds yet it still holds my attention, as the flavors are bright enough. This is a very solid O-fest. Tasty. Medium in body, if not a tickle bigger with firm carbonation, all of this adds up to create a solid mouthfeel. This is a very enjoyable quaff, I could session with this beer, easily. Bring on the Polka and pretzels!

Buy some Black Bavarian if you want Sprecher, and some Elliot Ness or Wolnzacher if you want an O-fest/Marzen.","Sixpack595","0"
3.4,-10.1,4,4,3,3,3.5,"Mostly clear reddish-copper in color. Some carbonation but minimal head that quickly disappears. A rich, bold nose dominated by caramely malts. Underlying grains remind me ho-hum lagers, but fruity, crisp hops are detectable too. Quite hoppy at the start. A strangely sour, even metallic, taste is too dominant in the middle and early finish. Malts make their way out as the beer warms, or at least as the mouth gets used to it. Mouthfeel is more watery than I expected given the richness of the nose but is nonetheless clean. This one is OK, but not something I'm going to reach for given the competition.","BitteBier","Sep 16, 2003"
4.47,18.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Ruby red hue with a thin bubbly head as a partner. Huge and wonderful malty aroma, very nice. Sweet off the cuff, but well done, some caramel tones are noted and they blend well with the rich and creamy malts. Bordlerline on a full bodied beverage. Great body and incredible taste, this should be the definition of a Oktoberfest beer!","GeoffRizzo","Sep 15, 2003"
3.55,-6.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Deep copper color with a creamy beige head that puffs up nicely then fades quickly-minimal lace or stick. Malty as well as fruity on the nose. A pretty big mouthfull of suds here and pretty much a fine example of the style. Heavy handed on the malt yet still a good dose of piney hops. Some caramel corn chimes in on the finish as does some burnt caramel bitterness. I have to give the drinkability a low score as Sprecher (to me) is nearly always over the top to the point of being flabby. This one though does grow on ya, and perhaps with a next sample I will review a tad higher. But for now, one pint will be just right.","moulefrite","Sep 12, 2003"
3.34,-11.6,3,4,3,2,4,"Looks like there's a lot more variety in Okto beers than any style definition can contain, especially when American brewers are involved. Sprecher's 2003 brew offers a nice dark complexion with a good roasty malt character. This, in turn, counterbalances the usual sweetness of an Okto, leading it to the promised dry finish. Still, the mouthfeel comes in a little thinner than expected, but a good effort.","DrunkMcDermott","Aug 25, 2003"
4.24,12.2,4,5,4,4,4,"The look is equally solid, having a beautiful amber body and substantive off-white head and solid lace effect. The feel is good with a solid body and finish to match the dryness. I was impressed by this beer.","AtLagerHeads","Dec 22, 2002"
3.24,-14.3,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"The Rathskeller Wine & Beer Fest:A medium sized ivory head with small sized bubbles.The body was clear and free of carbonation.The hue was amber and the lacing was good.The nose was moderately malty and it had a malty flavor to it.The mouthfeel was vert smooth, light bodied, and somewhat thin.","hotstuff","Oct 03, 2002"
4.21,11.4,5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a beautiful clear amber with an off-white head. Aroma has a malt sweetness and caramel scent to it. Mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat creamy (especially in the finish). Flavor consists of toasted malt, caramel, with a slight spiciness that's apparent. Overall great balance. This is one of the better Oktoberfests available and one of Sprecher's better brews. I'd definitely recommend trying one if you can find it.","Winter","Sep 15, 2002"
3.83,1.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"A pretty nice Octoberfest...soft toasty nose...taste is initially slick and sweetish with a small spicy hop accent...toasted grains emerge after that...Mouthfeel gives me a somewhat sticky, sweet, syrupy texture...overall I think this is pretty good, but I have had several better (Summit, Hacker,Paulaner,Goose, Titletown,Capital)...better than average but not elite in my opinion..","ZAP","Sep 13, 2002"
4.25,12.4,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Dark orange color, clear.  Pillowy and cottony head that ends up in nice lacy patterns.  Slight bright yeast aroma, in with maltiness.  Lightly spicy flavors, sense of bready/pumpkiny tastes and a cinnamon spiciness.  Finishes with a fresh but subdued hop.  This beer is typical of many O-Fests, starts full and malty and ends thinner and tighter.  Makes for an interesting complexity and adds to the drinkability.  No wonder they're served in big ass steins.  Good example of style in my opinion.","ADR","Sep 02, 2002"
4.35,15.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This clear copper brew is topped by a slight creamy beige head that is well retained.  A deep malty aroma accented by some slight noble hop spiciness.  This is one of the better tasting Oktoberfests in the midwest.  Very nice malt profile here.  The caramel tones stand out.  Underneath that, there are layers of graininess and toastiness.  And to boot, there's a nice little (emphasis on little) hop kick and bitterness.  Smooth and creamy full bodied mouthfeel.  Nice marzen.","Bighuge","Aug 26, 2002"
2.71,-28.3,4,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Sprecher Oktoberfest:  Dark copper colored beer, under a very thick off-white head.  Very nice sticky lace.  Somewhat mild initial tastes of malt, but with an unpleasant taste that is hard to place.  I love Sprecher products, but this one is not up to their typical exceptional quality.","jackndan","Apr 18, 2002"
