"Herbal/hop taste.  Overall too dry and smoky for my liking."

"Enjoyed from a 12 oz bottle in a pint glass, this solid example of a festbier pours cloudy orange brown with a nominal off white head and decent lacing.  Nose of biscuit, caramel malts, and some light bittering hops.  Flavors are straight forward for the style.  Rich caramel malts on all sides with a bready characteristic and light bittering hops to the rear.  Smooth lightly coating mouth feel finishes wet with a light sweet aftertaste mingling with light hops.  Very true to the style."

"A very flavorful, full-on malt character, rich in dark malt and woody, nutty flavors."
""

"Poured into tumbler. Brown. Not much of a head or lacing. Smell is sweet caramel. Malty. Taste is dry sweet bold malt. I do not like marzens mostly and this we not much different than those."
""
""
"I'm not a big fan of the style because it tends to tilt toward malt and I'm a hop lover. This beer is definitely malt forward, but there is enough hop balance to make it interesting to me. I probably wouldn't seek it out again. This was part of a flight for me."

"This pours with a cloudy yet bright amber hue and a tidy close knit head. The nose is quite malty with a sweet grain, barley, roasted nut and biscuity aroma. The flavors emulate the nose with a more toasted tone. The malts are kilned and toasty with a prominent pecan. Very smooth lager but the flavors of an ale."
"Deep amber color with a small white head. Poor retention. Sweet caramel malt aroma. Flavor was lacking that dry, bready, Oktoberfest profile. Chalky mouthfeel. I'm usually a fan of Victory but this was a miss for me. I would recommend most German and some other American versions of the style over this one."

"A near perfect Oktoberfest.  The best American Marzen I've had.  Extremely smooth, rich and delicious!"

"Lacks body.   Not a huge fan of malt but this one could use a bit more.  Not a bad beer but not memorable either."

"Light brownish-copper. Nose is bready and nutty.  The flavor profile is solid but not particularly impressive.  There is also an odd off sour note in the flavor."
""
""
""
"Toasty sweet malt backs a light hop presence. Quite drinkable and mouthfeel spot on"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Meh. A sub-par Oktoberfest offering. Too sweet, one dimensional, and coming off like a soda-beer. Malty, but that's all that's going on here. Like wet biscuits, but in a bad way. Not terrible, but not a beer I'd return to, especially with so many great examples of the style during the height of the season."
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL:  This is an insanely drinkable beer. Although it could be construed by some as a rich beer, it just goes down so easy.  This is what Marzen should taste like to me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my new favorite octoberfest. Had it poured from the bottle into a mug. The color is perfect, a reddish copper. The aroma and flavor are outstanding. It's a smoky mix of molasses and malt, capturing the flavor while avoiding the syrupy constitution of some other offerings of the genre. Love it."

"Pours a beautiful deep and clear amber. A thin and fizzy white head dissipates quickly  but a steady stream of carbonation leaves some bubbles at the top. The aroma is sweet and all I get is caramel. It's almost too sweet, bordering on candy. The taste has a much more refined caramel quality with a little nutty aspect and there's just a hint of earthy hops. A little thinner on the body but not off. A slight tickle from the carbonation. A decent example of the style."

"O- nice.  Overall I had never really been into Marzen/octoberfest beers until I went to a tasting.  I tried 3 including Ayinger Oktober fest-marzen and firestone walker oaktoberfest.  I felt that this was on the same level as firestone walker but not as good as Ayinger"
""
""
""
"Light toasty grains and they marginally outsized sugary quality. decent enough, but this lacks the depth and breadth of maltiness that I was hoping for. I expected a bit more from Victory."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Clean malt taste, but not smooth. Low hop flavor. Slight bitterness, only moderately sweet (3.5/5). Toasted hay"

""

"o: was expecting more from Victory.  this is a little disappointing (wishing i didn't have a 6 pack).  märzens aren't the most complex to begin with, but this is has a distinct lack of flavor.  appearance could use some work too"
"Overall, not the greatest Oktoberfest brew, but worth downing a sixer or two."
""
""
""
"While I love Victory's Prima Pils and Hop Devil, this was a disappointment. Overall, an unbalanced beer that I wouldn't pick up again. If you are looking for an easy-drinking Octoberfest, there are better options out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I might have gotten a bad 6er because we had this at Octoberfest night for beer club and somehting was off in the aroma and the taste was much harsh (hoppy not malty), might have gone skunky on us?"
""
""
"Chill haze and tiny head/no lacing detract from appearance.  The malt overpowers the hops resulting in an unbalanced brew.  Carbonation is just a little too lively, bordering on aggressive."
""
""
"Very nice and smooth beer with a bit of hop to finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A near perfect octoberfest in my opinion. So flavorful. The malt taste in this beer is great. Well done and a must try oktoberfest!"

"O - A solid Oktoberfest.  I don't drink a lot of this style as so many seem similar to me, and there isn't much variation it seems.  This is a solid Oktoberfest though.  Somehwta complex, full of flavor and fairly easy to drink.  I recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a first for the Marzen style. This is a well polished, well balanced and highly easy drinking brew. This is worthy."
""
""
""
"O-  I love Marzen's and I love Festbier.  Bring on more."
""
"09/26/12 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Great first impression. Tremendous balance with a touch of toasty/burnt sugar. Envision a wide spectrum of flavor with a punch up in the middle w/bittersweet. Seems a bit on the heavy side for more than a pair o' pints, but worthy overall."

"Overall, a tasty and simple beer. I could definitely drink a few of these."
"O - Good marzen style of beer, Victory is usually reliable when it comes to their styles."
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice beer, but I think it lacks a little bitterness bite near the end like I expect in an Oktoberfest. Would be a decent choice for a fall session beer, for sure, however."

"O- A good octoberfest beer. Worth having."
"Perfect clear amber color with very little cream colored head. Aroma is of very sweet caramel, and not too much else. Taste is definitely of caramel, and a good biscuityness to it as well. Lighter carbonation than I would expect, but not terrible. Good body too."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very good Octoberfest beer. I wish I had tried it a couple of months ago."
""
"Overall it is a nice drinkable fall lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A solid fall classic from Victory. Simple, easy, and drinkable."
""
""
"Overall- Above average good beer which seems to be a good representation of a style I generally don't like but need to have more experience with. Definitely worth a try- the mouthfeel is the star."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is another solid American version of an Oktoberfest beer. Nicely balanced between malt and hops and sweetness. I’d certainly get it again."

"This one pours a nice deep orange color with some ruby-red/pink grapefruit highlights. Starch-white head that collapses to a thin layer. Not overly malty on the nose; some yeasty bread, honey, nuts, candied fruit, a little funk. The initial taste is sweet vanilla followed by tangy fruit (some citrus), pine, minerals, and hops. And the hops linger. For me, a bit too hoppy (and too carbonated) for an Oktoberfest, but Victory being Victory, I guess we should have expected more hops than less."
"Overall: Has some unique and tasty qualities of which I was appreciative, even if they didn't come together as nicely as one might hope for. Easy drinking despite the long list of descriptors. Would choose it over many Octoberfests."

"Nutty toasted malt flavor, grain husks, apples, fall leaves. Very light hint of bitterness in the aftertaste, and a hint of malt sweetness up front, otherwise dry and crisp. Very smooth and easy drinking, full and almost chewy for a lager. A delicious and traditional American Oktoberfest, definitely a staple i'll be looking for every fall. Side note: this was a top 3 finalist up against a dozen other Oktoberfests at a recent tasting."
""
""
"A very well done Marzen, one of the top American examples I have tried. Picked this up on a whim and am very happy I did. Certainly a ""go to"" example of the style."

"Victory has the habit of making clean and crisp brews that are sharp, meaning distinct and clear. That's what this beer was. Clean, subtly sweet and earthy. It has abundant flavor and a palate that is ready for anything from burgers to pasta primavera."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of the best American Oktoberfestbiere that I've had so far this season. We will see how it compares to Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen, one of the best German versions of this style, in a few days. Overall, I'm generally pleased and would gladly order this at a bar. Whether I buy it for home consumption remains to be seen."
"O: Enjoyable, fairly flawless except for slight oxidation I am getting in taste, simple yet enjoyable beer."
""
"Overall a good octoberfest. A bit weak on the aroma, but full in flavor."
"Highly drinkable and certainly worth your dollars."

"Mouthfeel: Light bodied, crisp and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The battle wins out with a surprise come-from-behind victory by crispy sweet lager yeast flavor. Not world class, but dam good. worth a six pack, it won't last a week."
""
"Medium body, perfect October-time beer. Smell and tastes aren't too complex if that is what you are looking for, but throwing back one or two of these on a nice Autumn day would be ideal."
""
"O - Very enjoyable beer. I would definitely have this beer again - glad I got two of them...and I'll likely be going back for more. Although I prefer the caramel sweetness from Samuel Adams' Octoberfest, I still think this is a pretty great beer. Hell, doesn't need to be one or the other - I'll have both!"

""
""
"O-Very nice beer that surprised me. From my first whiffs of it I thought it was going to be another mediocre Oktoberfest, but once I tasted it I enjoyed it very much, yet another high quality offering from Victory. I'm surprised this isn't rated higher, grab some if you see it."
""
""
""

"O - I'm not too impressed with this beer. I liked it, but I like to think of Octoberfest beers as something I could sit down with and consume a fair amount of. This doesn't really fit that description."
""

""
""
""

"Highly drinkable, would make a great food beer. Another good German style offering from Victory. (3.5)"

"Appearance- Clear amber almost light ruby red hue with one inch white head that fades fast but keeps a ring around the glass. Smell - Light bready malt with caramel and grassy spicy hop notes. Taste - Caramel with a light nuttiness and sweet pilsner malt are equaled by spicy grass with light floral hop flavor that keeps till the end. Overall - Not a bad beer wish breadiness would stand up stronger against the hops."

"Overall - I'd have to believe this one's been on the self for a good 8 or 9 months, but based on my enjoyment, I'd say it's held up well. This is one I'll have to try fresh come September/October."

"Overall, this is definitely one of my top 3 favorite beers out there, if not my favorite. I found this bottle in the basement, thinking that all of them from the case bought in September's case were gone. What a surprise! But it's always available at the brewery, thank god."
""
""
""
"Overall, this makes for a very tasty version of an Oktoberfest bier. I will have to pick this up again in the fall."
""
""
"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a copper color, produced a above average white head, nice retention and it left a nice amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of fresh baked bread and piney hops. Medium bodied, a foundation of toasted malt, caramel and a semi dry, bitter hop finish. Very nice session beer and nice example of a Oktoberfest beer."
""
""
""
""
"A verry good beer from victory they haven't done me rong yet I will drink this one again"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I like it. Another good offering from Victory."
""
"Beer has a medium to medium-light body with carbonation of medium intensity, creating a beer that slightly fizzes across the palate, ultimately coming across as crisp and smooth. Closes semi-dry, with moderate stickiness lingering across the palate."

"All in all I thought this beer was just ok and I thought it was a pretty average example of the style, I didn't pick up any hops, just lots of malts that seemed a little too dull for the style. This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, but the flavors didn't hold my attention, I could drink a couple of these but I would rather have something with a little more flavor. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was the truest to style and it worked well with this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was how boring this beer was, a little hops would have helped this beer out and impart a little bit of complexity. I don't think I would buy this again, there's many other Marzen's that I would much rather have and would buy instead, it's worth trying if you really like the style, but I don't think it will make the top of anybody's list of great Marzen's. All in all this beer was pretty middle of the road and not that memorable. I have yet to be really impressed by Victory, most of their beers seem to be pretty average, better luck next time guys."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a clear amber color beer with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of grainy notes with light dry caramel malt notes. Taste is mostly dominated by grainy cereal notes with a dryer then expected caramel malt finish. Body is about average with good carbonation. Easily drinkable though finish is not as clean as I would have expected."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, pretty much what you would expect from an Octoberfest, definately one of the better ones."
""
"O-I wonder why I drink Oktoberfests. This beer didn't bring much to the table, at least it wasn't awful. But boring at the end of the day."
""
""
""
"This is an awesome Oktoberfest style beer. Right up my alley. Much bolder with more to offer than any of the big name German Marzens I've tried."
""
""
""
""
"Pours medium amber, some orange, light layer of white foam that splits apart. Malty nose, some cinammon/nutmeg spice. Taste is a rich chewy caramel malt. Hearty malt. There is a barely noticeable hop at the close. Real flavorful marzen, maybe a touch short on bite."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is surprisingly complex and has a nice bitter finish. Better than I thought it'd be!"
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is as malty as the aroma and significantly sweeter than what I got on the nose. A modest lingering finish ties it all together. It isn't all that bad and is entirely drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"m: Moderately high carbonation with a moderately light body. Fairly dry finish that may be due to a bit of astringency."
""
""
"A deep copper brown color with a modest white cover that dissipates quickly to random swirls. Lacing is fair. The aroma is no doubt cabbage malt with a hint of chocolate and herbal hop. Pretty neat. The flavor is absolutely in keeping with the nose hit. A beautiful malt bath with an herbal hop edge that makes for a lucid, dry feel in a medium bodied brew with modest carbonation. A very satisfying Octoberfest beer that I would easily recommend autumnal malt fans."
"Medium bodied and a feel of medium to high carbonation. The finish is balanced between the caramel malts and hop bitterness. Overall I liked this Oktoberfest, but would prefer a bit less hop profile."
""
"Verdict: skip."
""
"O - An American NW take on the style that respects the traditional foundation of toasted malts and caramels, but still has the need to make sure the hops are noticed. If you're expecting a Marzen, you'll probably find the overall effort out-of-balance. Probably better paired with food, where the hops can find more to balance with, than drunk alone."
"Roasted malt and caramel up front followed by bitter herb. It has a nice balance and a full body. It has a chewy, nutty, bread like mouth feel. This is a real good Octoberfest. This one gets better as it warms."
""
""
""
"O: A super tasty, solid Oktoberfest that doesn't differentiate too much from other available marzens, but I feel Victory has produced one that is very true to style. $8 for a 6 pack is a great price to pay."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Other than the lack luster aroma, this is one really fantastic and tasty beer. It is one I will definitely go to again. It has great flavors and a very nice feel."
"Taste is malty and slightly sweet, the carbonation doesn't add much pop on the tongue. The beer is very balanced and ever so slightly peppery, a very subtle and malty beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep golden amber color with a smallish off white head with minimal retention and lace. Smells of caramel and bread and a bit of toast with an earthy floral hop component to it. The flavor is bready pilsner malt with a bit of caramel and sweet sugary malt. A bit heavy on the hops for the style, lots of earthy herbal hops compete with an inadequate malt base. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and an earthy slick mouthfeel. Decent enough beer, but like a lot of American interpretations it just doesn't measure up to the German brewed versions."
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 12/11/2012. Pours lightly hazy orange copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of pear, apple, caramel, biscuit, toast, toffee, earth, and herbal. Nice aromas with good balance and decent strength. Taste of big pear, toast, caramel, biscuit, toffee, apple, earth, herbal, and light nuttiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light fruit, earth, and herbal on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance and robustness of flavors; with no cloying sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good Oktoberfest lager. Nicely robust with good flavor balance; extremely smooth to drink. Enjoyed this."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm not impressed."
""
"Overall pretty impressed and a solid Marzen to be had, with a lot of flavor."
""
"O - Victory Festbier might just be the ultimate Oktoberfest. Crisp and clean, it adheres to it's strict lager standards and showcases deep malt complexity while adding a simplistic but oh-so-important kiss of hops, all while remaining exceptionally drinkable, especially for it's robust body! A moment of pause to consider the skill required to brew such a balanced and immaculate beer is rewarding but equally as rewarding is losing one's self in the festivities and enjoying pint after pint of such a beer."
""
""
"Overall: A very good American take on a Marzen. Full bready malt flavor with some nice subtle roast notes. Nicely balanced sweetness."
""
"A nice orangey amber with a decent head of an off white hue and touches of lace here and there. A bit of haze as I gaze, no carbonation in the glass. Smell has lots of toasted grains and light sweet malt with yeasty bread and herbal hops. Taste is malty and smooth with a grainy quality that flows to a well integrated hop component that balances the caramel sweetness and gives a somewhat longish dry finish. Well developed nuttines shows towards the swallow, gives a nice platform for the bitterness to blossom. Feel is medium with a light tingley carbonationan and a crisp overall character. High notes for drinkability and sessioning this one is easy. A good solid effort from one of my favorite breweries."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Pretty good Marzen here, it was a little sweet, but good blend of tastes. Almost a 'complex' Marzen."
""
""
""
""
"Flavor is rich and malty, with a hint of toasty grain malts and a light, fruity hop finish. This is a subtle, well-crafted, and complex, but easy-drinking beer. Impressive!"
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed, orange-amber coloring with a slow cadence of carbonation bubbling and a thin, sparse, off-white filmy coating on the surface. Aromas of roasted malt, both nutty and richly sweet, with a bready backbone and some old world fruit highlights. Flavors are rich and thick, with a roasted backbone supporting fresh and sweet flavors of pumpkin, nuts, and a spice blend of nutmeg, cumin, and cinnamon. Very forward and bold on the palate. Sweetness has a touch of brown sugar going into the aftertaste, which is tangy sweet and only lightly roasty/toasty. Good transition of the flavors as you drink. The finish is rich and smooth, with a tangy, slightly lingering sweetness. Very flavorful and very easy to drink. The light body keeps the sweet, rich flavors from overpowering."
"O: Enjoyable and very easy to drink - there is a nice balance between the malty sweetness and hop bitterness."
"Pours an orange doused copper capped by one finger off-white head. No lacing. Caramel, toffee, bread dough and fruit accents including a bit of pear and sweet apple on the nose. Light, sweet caramel malt, doughy pie crust, joined by apple peel, and then finishes fairly dry with grassy hops. Lighter medium body, slick with hints of syrup. Decent level of carbonation. Overall a solid marzen, however a bit more depth to the flavors would be welcome."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-a decent Octoberfest beer, but not among my favorites"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Had it not been described as an oktoberfest then I may have seen this beer differently, but overall I will avoid festbeer in the future"
"Pours a copper tinted amber, clear with little head and no retention. Scent is very pale with hints of light caramel and muddy, mineraly water. Thankfully taste is a bit better, light sweet malts, faint nuttyness and faint grassyness, still some mineral qualities. Lighter than expected, very few bubbles of carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
"This brew was a clear amber color with minimal head and active carbonation. There was no real lacing to speak of. The first thing that I noticed was that this brew was a little thin and not what I would consider for the body of an Oktoberfest. On the nose, I got…nothing. No joke. Not a thing. It was like sniffing water. Maybe if I thought really hard about it, I could get some sort of earthiness and a hint of sweetness. But, it would be a reach. The taste is primarily watery, just how it looked. I didn’t get a lot of taste on it. Maybe some sweet malt on the taste and a hint of earthiness? I’m surprised about the lack of flavor in this brew. I didn’t really like it and would not get it again. Definitely underflavored."
"My favorite American representation. Recommended. 4.5"

"O: A nice O-Fest that displays a bunch of the characteristics of the style. Easy to drink too. Solid"
""
""
""
"Overall this is one of the better American interpretations of a Marzen/Oktoberfest that exist in today's market. The caramel, sweet maltiness is probably overstated for the style but I enjoy that more than one that is heavy on grainy, pilsnery flavors. Good, not great, worth a go amongst others."
""
"O-this isn't a good Oktoberfest beer. The flavors just don't mesh well and it's not drinkable as the style is supposed to be. "
""
""
""
"Solid fest beer, but nothing special. At the high price point, it's not especially desirable."
"O: A highly drinkable, flavorful marzen. It's pretty standard for the style and doesn't really bring anything too new to the table. It's easy to appreciate the simplicity of this beer, though. A perfect fall party beer."
"O/D-One of the better takes on a style I don't love. Enjoyed the hop intensity. Another solid Victory brew."

"This was the first time I have ever seen and Oktoberfest lager from Victory, so I had to pick it up. Probably one of the best American made versions of this style of beer."
"Overall: very smooth and drinkable, but for a decotion mash being used would have liked to see a more assertive malt background and less bitterness"
""
"Appearance is a dark amber color, with an initially generous head that fades pretty quickly. The smell is strong, with bread and biscuit scents standing out. Toasted bready malts are dominant in the taste, reminding me of sourdough bread. There is a bit of nutty flavor, and a floral bitterness in the finish. Just average mouthfeel. Nothing really remarkable about this beer, but nothing bad either."
""
""
"QUITE NICE, WORTH TRYING!"
"Mouthfeel is good as well- medium bodied, light carbonation on the tip of the tongue. Very drinkable. I love this style but haven't had the opportunity to try too many- this one is good but perhaps in a month I might say differently."

"Overall: typical large craft brewery marzen. Doesn't have the spiciness or malt profile to stand out or be memorable. Very drinkable and clean overall."

"Review from 11/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a medium orange amber. Slight head dissipated slowly leaving light lacing. Grainy, light malt aroma. Caramel, malt, slightly sweet. A pleasant light malty ale. A straightforward, but unremarkable Marzen."

"Really nice, well executed. Not an overload of the senses, but what is there serves a good purpose. Hard to fault what Victory do, one of the more consistent breweries across styles."
""
""
""
"Taste is nice caramelly barley, toasty bread crust, woody-peppery hint, light bitterness. It’s very slightly on the sweet side. It is very good, enjoyable, solid, but simple and 2-dimensional ."

"Overall quite a good beer, interesting somewhat Americanised take on an Oktoberfest."

""
"Victory's Festbeer is one of the better Marzen style beer available. Nice amount of malt, mouthfeel is pretty good. Marzens can be a little too light or way too much malt, but Festbeer is a perfect balance. Nice hop bitterness to cut some of maltyness."

"Out of a bottle this beer was a clear amber color with some nice tangerine highlights. The tan head displayed decent lacing and moderate lacing as well. The aroma was of caramel, bread, butter and a bit of toasted malt. The flavors were an interesting balance of very sweet caramel malt and dry but floral hops. The bready malt and dry yeast also came through in the middle and I also got some toast and pine nuts as it warmed up. The sweetness seemed a little too much for a Marzen to me and I wasn’t exactly ‘wowed’ but I suppose this could just be my impression of the Victory interpretation. The mouthfeel was good, the body medium and the carbonation moderate."

"The beer when i poured it into a pint glass, it has a nice amber color body with not a lot of head that thins down to a thin lace. The smell is of carmel and malty. The malt hits you up front, first thing i taste. Then some earthy hops comes along, but not strong. The mouth feel is nice and crisp. Overall this is a average marzen."

"Final-I’m not really sure what to make of this. Out of all of the Marzen’s I’ve tried this probably has the least amount of bubbles in it. I’m not sure I personally like it, due to the odd sweetness, but there is nothing in there to severely offend anyone. It’s fairly balanced though a little bit off kilter on the sweetness, but overall worth a go for the price if you don’t mind a fairly “flat” Marzen. Maybe this bottle wasn’t any good, because I know it wasn’t old and my review seems quite contrary to the others."
"O- a lot of nice aspects to this one, but I really didn't dig the flavor. Not a bad version of the style, and appropriately priced for those who are fans of this."
"Overall, solid marzen."
"O: If you're picking out an American interpretation of a Marzen, this is the one in my opinion, I bought multiple 6ers of this, it's a great beer"
"Decent, but pretty unremarkable, lacks complexity.. Drinks more like a red lager with some fall vibes rather than a true oktoberfest."
"This is a top tier oktoberfest/marzen for me. Up there with Great Lakes take on the style. I would love to sample both to see which one I prefer, but this is a damn good brew. Case worthy indeed."
"Four Stars(out of four)"
"A marzen that is a bit above average."
"Overall: Good, not great, Oktoberfest. Not a lot of balance."
"For me, this is a rock solid Marzen offering for the season. I started luke-warm on the offering, but am on my 3rd 6er. I really enjoy Southern Tier's Autumn Ale, but until someone gives me a better Oktoberfest spirited lager, this is the go to this season."
"O: Victory strikes again, great fall beer, traditional American Marzen beer."
"This actually has a lovely rye taste to it. Nice and malty, a touch of caramel sweetness. Nice blend of flavors. This is a very smooth and refreshing beer. Nice carbonated tingle, but not heavy. Very complex and well-executed."
"O: I'm not usually a fan of the style, but I rather like this one. It is remarkably drinkable."
"Boulevard in J'Town, PA had the Victory Festbier on tap. It poured a clear amber with decent frothy head and laced. The aroma included malt, barley, and some spiciness. The tase was powered by barley and malt....very grainy beer. The mouthfeel is ok, the taste leaves something to be desired. Over all it was ok,,,never been that big of a october Marzen fan. Certainly worth a try though."
"A decent fest beer, worthy of a try. But is a crowded season of seasonal fall beers, it is hard to put this ahead of so many other great Oktoberfest and pumpkin beers out there."
"Overall, nothing about this beer really jumps out at me except that it is an enjoyable beer."
"D/O- A well done interpretation by Victory. Nice malt characteristics and a balanced sweetness. This is one of my favorite American takes on a German Märzen. Recommended. Cheers."
"Drinkability: Nothing too complex, but it is a solid brew. It reminds me a lot of Millstream’s Oktoberfest from last year."
"O: This beer looked and smelled pretty good. The flavor was good, not great, but good. The mouthfeel was okay. I liked the Great Lakes Oktoberfest better, but this wasn't bad."
"It poured a healthy reddish nut brown and smelled of toffee and molasses. Low carbonation but enough to be refreshing. It tastes great! Full of flavor with little after taste. It seems that Marzens dont really score to well on BA, understandably so as they really arent amazing beers in general. But comparing apples to apples, this stands out as a pretty good choice. I would buy again."
"Too much carbonation. Its fizzy and prickly. The finish is dry."
"I haven’t had a lot of Oktoberfest style beers but it’s pretty good. Not really something I would drink a lot of."
"O: Easy to drink a few of. Not bad, unoffensive, but nothing special. I'd actually take Sam Adam's Octoberfest over this, or Paulaner though."
"Overall: I'm just not in love with this beer. There are Oktoberfests that I like, but this just ain't one of 'em."
"Poured into a chilled mug. Head pops up then dies completely. Thin lacing, but as I say the head deteriorates almost immediately. Garnet color and very clear. Smells of vanilla and a hint of bitter orange. Very creamy mouthfeel, smooth as silk going down. Flavors of toasty malt, nice orange, spicy, hoppy citrus, with a slight metallic wash that pierces through in the finish. Refreshing, somewhat spiky carbonation. Nothing bad to say about this beer. Very drinkable, noticeably less malty than other Octoberfest brews, which is a nice change. This is a brewery that knows what it is doing, producing consistently good beer, and this Festbier is no exception. You'll want more than one of these."
"."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 40 degrees. The beer poured a nice tan head. The beer smelled a little fruity but did not taste that way. The color of the beer was orange and the taste has a hint of caramel. I liked the beer and would buy again."
"O: Festbier is not a bad seasonal brew, but much like the Chiefs, I do not associate fall with Victory."
"I felt this was a good Oktoberfest and would recommend"
"Overall: Really nice, refreshing fall beer. I've picked this up the past two falls and like sitting back and enjoying it once the weather starts to take a turn and feel more Fallish. It's got a really nice earthy flavor that goes down all too easy."
"O - Nice representation of the style, with the hops being a welcome twist."
"Beer is medium in body and sweet, nice finish, mildly bitter, really drinkable, good mouthfeel. I enjoyed it and would have it again, the munich malt comes through nice on the finish and midpalate."
"Overall not a bad marzen. The toastiness is a little more than you'll get from most marzens, and it's not as rich as most. A good beer though."
"Between this and Great Lakes Oktobefest, there's no need to look elsewhere for your next Märzen fix."
"probably the 4rth or 5th best american okt I've had...."
"The draft version was pretty much the same. A good Octoberfest that's worth trying if you see it."
"O: Very drinkable, refreshing. Great beer for the fall."
"In the end the hops round everything out and really balance out that roasted flavor. The malts really seem to be roasted closer to burnt but not really. It does add for a very autumn like beer. One of my favorites of the season. Exceptionally well crafted."
"o- I enjoy many of victories beers, and this one does fail.. I bought a case for my friends and I know they will enjoy this victory"
"Pours a clear dark copper with a 1/2 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a thin film. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, and a roasty aroma. Taste is of toasted malt, caramel notes, and a roasty/bitter flavor. The aftertaste is of the roast/bitterness as well. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a nice toasted/roasted malt quality to it."
"This German style is undertaken very well by Victory; why am I not surprised? The color is a radiant amber hue, and is capped with a smallish white head. The nose is bit toasty, with hints of caramel, and the ghost of autumnal spice. The flavor has a strong nuttiness tending towards almond, and is smoothed out by notes of biscuits and toffee, and yet it does not cross the line into sweetness. Medium-bodied and quite refreshing, this is a very enjoyable example of the style; everything about it is well-done. Now that I think of it, I cannot recall a better Oktoberfest brew."
"Overall it is a good tasting O-fest. I just think the after taste lasted way too long. Good beer if I’m only having 1, may become too much if having a sixer at a time."
"In all honesty, this is one of the best Oktoberfests I've tasted. It has much more flavor than a majority of the American brewed (and even some German brewed) ones, with no off flavors. Easily one beer I will be stocking the fridge full of this fall."
"O: Another great beer from Victory. Not my absolute favorite marzen but one I'm happy to have around when things are cooling off. I'm sure to buy some more of this."
"O: I dug Victory's taste profile and honestly believe that they are some of the best in the biz at styles like this (Moonglow is a wow beer!), but I simple thought this was too rich for my taste. Still, this was pretty good."
"Overall- I always like this beer not sure what took so long to review but definitely one of the best Octoberfests out there"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Stone IRS tulip. Gorgeous amber color and a frothy, off-white 2 fingers of head. Smells of sweet malt, earthy grain, a roasted nut quality, light hop scent. Up front a light fruity sweetness, followed by a blast of nuttiness. Lots of barley/undefined grains. Extremely light hop bitterness on the finish. Dry. Very creamy mouthfeel. Little to no prickly bubbles. Just smooth, easy drinking. Great Marzen."
"Loads of toasted, bready malts, nuts, vanilla, spicy hops, nice and sweet. Smooth mouth which finishes a bit dry."
"D/O Also as mentioned above, really drinkable (I find that most every beer in this style is quite drinkable…I think that it is pretty much the idea of a fest beer) and overall this beer is good among other beers within its style. 4.0"
"O: I really like this beer. Easy drinking and quality all around. One of the best Marzens I've had so far this season."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink despite all of the maltiness because the hops help to balance off the associated sweetness."
"D - Nice example of the style, but not great. It has decent drinkability and is worth a try during the fall season."
"A truly well put together and interesting take on the style. A beer I will keep coming back to as the leaves change year after year. Well done, Victory."
"A clear amber beer with a patchy layer of white head. Biscuity aroma, caramel malts. More of the same in the taste--it's a märzen, basically--nutty, bready, with a caramel sweetness, and some light floral hoppiness for a good balance. Medium-bodied and tasty. Easily drinkable."
"Unremarkable for the style. There are too many equivalently-priced alternatives to make me return to this one."
"this beer from victory pours a really nice copper brown color. The smell is malty and slightly spicy. The taste is a nice potent bitter. It's not over powering and makes for good drinking. This is a nice octoberfest and perfect beer to go with the season."
"O: A pretty solid beer and a very satisfying flavor. This is my first go with this one (which is surprising cause I love Victory)"
"Poured amber-orange with a half-inch of light foam, no lacing. Smell is lightly malty but rather non-descript. Malt presence on the taste buds is sweet, biscuit, bread, Earthy, almost chalky. Some light herbal hop late into a slightly dry finish. Body falls apart on the tongue, but the carbonation is decent. Overall a decent malty Oktoberfest."
"A decent beer for the style. It looks great, although the aroma is a little lacking. It's very refreshing and has some very nice malt flavors."
"Not the best example of the style. But a solid beer from Victory."
"Golden orange with a small amount of head. No retention. Light toasted malt nose. Small bready yeast character like rising sourdough. Flavor comes forward more than the nose predicts. Sweet caramel toasted malts. The bread yeast shows up more in the finish. It leaves a crisp toasted malt tang. There is also a slight layer of hops, almost like a Pils (some saaz). They leave a earthy dryness after the sweet dough."
"This beer is the quintessential ""fall beer"" to me. Love it."
"This is my first Oktoberfest beer of the season, I bought this since one of my friends said it was good so hopefully I'll like it! 12 ounce bottle, label says enjoy by Jan 2, 2012. Served in a mug, the beer pours a clear amber/orange color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. Aroma is toasted and bready malt, nuts, and a bit of spicy hops. The brew tastes mostly like toasted malt and nuts, with some bready malt and light spicy hops noticable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's smooth and easy to drink with moderate carbonation. Not a bad brew at all, I'd definitely buy this one again. It's one of the better Oktoberfest brews I've had."
"Fresh nose full of toasty, nutty and fruity goodness with hints of grass and spice. Great balance of flavors here. Nutty, grainy and toasty malt profile. Sweet and fruity flavors are complemented by a light sting of bitterness and leafy, tealike hop flavors. Exceedingly crisp that leaves you wanting more. This would be a great choice for a fall 'go-to' brew."
"On tap at the brewpub. Amber gold with a white head. Nose is lightly suggestive of grainy malt and vague spices. Subdued and difficult to pin down given the stylt and the type of glass it was served in. Mouth is fresh with a lightly sweet, grainy expression. Pumpkin sugars? A super fresh, balanced and enjoyable Oktoberfest, enjoyed at the source."
"Overall: Really like this brew. It is a low ABV, yet flavorful brew that is light enough for warm Autumn days, yet rich enough to satisfy once the leaves fall. Nice entry by Victory."
"Pours an amber red with a full finger and a half of off white foam. Dissipates rather quickly. Lots of caramel malt in the nose. Biscuit too. Rather ho hum malty flavor. I wish I could be more positive or negative. This beer is rather average at best."
"Overall - For a German Marzen/Octoberfest style session lager, this is a very good beer crafted and a great go-to beer when one doesn't crave crazy tastes but just want to relax with a beer (or several). Victory makes another finely crafted beer for its style."
"Easy to drink with a good mouthfeel. Has the makings of a good sessions beer. Worth a try."
"O- I could easily make this my go-to beer, and regret that the mass-produced stuff can't be on this beer's level. It's very drinkable: the more you drink of it, the more it grows on you. Still, it's clearly missing something; just a little more girth to the body and Victory has a perfect beer!"
"D: Well crafted."
"I will stock up on the beer every fall, as Oktoberfests tend to be my favorite style!"
"Not overly anything in the flavor, but certainly maltier than hoppier. Surprisingly, I pick up a note of booze in the flavor, right after a dose of unexciting malts and a small hit of hops that balances it out and gives it a little character, but its ultimately not enough to bring it to Victory standards. . It's smooth and goes down super easy, but it's also unexciting and unique like I have come to expect with Victory. I definitely need to try it again next fall just to compare and see how much freshness makes a difference."
"Victory Festbier is a hazy amber lager with some small particles in it. It's topped with an off white head that fades to a thin film and leaves nice lacing. It has a malty and melanoidal aroma. It smells like pretzels; grainy with a touch of caramel. It's medium bodied and pretty smooth with a light, quick finish. It leaves the palate clean. It has a mellow flavor that's well blended. It tastes grainy and fruity with notes of pretzels, bread crust, caramel, possibly a hint of cherry. It's not sweet and has just a touch of herbal bitterness. I'm not a big fan of this style, but this is really well made."
"I like that fact that they wanted to create something for the Oktoberfest season but, I don't know if this beer really fits that perspective or not. It's more along the lines of a Pilsner than a Marzen. The flavors that Victory came up with her are most definitely German but I don't think that it was the best way to go in making this brew. It was also a little too weak for a beer in the fall season."
"The beer quaffs easily, far better than many other American attempts at the style. It's flavor profile is simple, appropriate for a Marzen, but an interesting buttery tone reveals itself as it warms. Tasty, I'll be looking for more of these next fall."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Color is amber with a thin and quickly vanishing off white head. Aroma is very light, some caramel, maybe nutty malts, and a little bit of spice. Palate: very easy to drink but maybe a little to watery and carbonated. Flavor is very similar to the aroma, malt and light spice, nothing that leaves much of an impression. Overall this is not a very complex beer. However, is is very easy drinking and pretty cheap."
"D: Very drinkablbe and would go with some grilled pork or brat nicely."
"Overall, Festbier is a malty, buttered bread experience that spoils my appetite, especially during a big Octoberfest celebration where you are encouraged to drink a few rounds. I am, however, tasting this offering on the later end of it's life-span, so it is very likely the hop flavor has subsided, thus creating an imbalance."
"D - Very enjoyable and festive beer. Would like to enjoy more in the future."
"D- Overall, Victory Festbier is a solid Oktoberfest style beer that is perfect for the fall/winter season."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer, would love to get some more of this one."
"D: Would be quite high if it weren't for the metallic finish I""m experiencing."
"Notes: A good Marzen to pick up and a rather tasty and drinkable beer. Cheers."
"Drink - Another beer that falls in the category of 'not for me'. It's not an awful beer but not something I'd seek out again. It reminded me too much of a barnyard smell.."
"This said, I could envision myself drinking it year round. Prosit!"
"The body is medium/light with crisp carbonation. The finish is quite dry, making it easy to come back to and finish. There just wasn't too much to remember in this one, not Victory's best."
"Pours a dark amber, almost brown with a one finger off-white head. Not much lacing or retention. Bready aroma with hints on dark fruit and caramel. Doughy flavor to start. Sweet bread, grain, yeast along with the typical oktoberfest caramel and toffee malt. Toffee a little stronger than in most. Very sweet finish."
"The color is a dark mahogany, looking richly malty and inviting, but where's the head, Herr Victory brewer? The malt content in the aroma and taste comes off toasted-grainy, nicely sweet and yet a tad syrupy, however, something's lacking - a certain something that fails to round out the flavor to its full potential. Throw in some mustiness up front and vague cabbage (greens) in the back, and that sums up the taste. Compared to the others, the body is fuller, touching on viscous in its smoothness, yet it finishes dry enough not to stick. I can't help but feel this would go well with dishes that include potato - German (red) potato salad, potato cakes - things like that."
"Notes: Solid all around; toasted malt sweetness, creamy mouthfeel, and high drinkability. I'm going to miss this seasons Oktoberfests come winter."
"D- I found this one to be easy to drink just not my favorite of the season."
"D: Easy drinking beer, but not very satisfying. Very malty but not very flavorful. However, you could session this quite easy and would be appealing for some entry level drinkers for sure. Would try this one again for sure, not a complete bust for me."
"D: A nice solid Oktoberfest. Well balanced."
"This beer has a great, sweet flavor that smacks you during the first sip. Flavor is very nice and with no lingering aftertaste at all. Finishes clean witha nice body. Overall, this is very enjoyable. Excellent Octoberfest."
"It was almost a given that Victory, which has a German beer sensibility for the most part, would hit a home run with their Oktoberfest. Festbier is a wonderful celebration of the harvest season. Those of you fortunate enough to live within easy driving distance of Dowingtown can enjoy it year-round on-tap."
"This is such a hard beer to review. The aroma and taste - bready and malty - is so muted and mild, but it's very true to style. An authentic Octoberfest is just not going to blow you away with strong flavors, and this doesn't do it either. I found the carbonation too thin and the mouthfeel a little watery. For me, that put Festbier a notch below the average O-fest."
"M/D: Medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall a pretty good beer, one of the better Oktoberfests I have had."
"Festbier is a solid Oktoberfest release. I think it performs alright for a style that's simple and straight forward. My only complaint about is that the flavor seems to trail off to a weak finish. I don't know what it needs to carry it through. Maybe more hops? All in all, it's a good release. Definitely worth checking out."
"Overall, a nice oktoberfest brew, smooth and sessionable."
"The aroma is malty and smooth with just a little bit of roasted character. Flavor mimics the aroma. It is very smooth clean mild and malty. Carbonation is moderate and pleasant. This is a smooth, easy drinking, no-frills Oktoberfest."
"I hope that my general dislike for malty, low-hopped beers didn't just taint my experience of this beer, but I did not really enjoy Victory's Festbier very much. The beer looked okay, it was a clear russet brown with very little head that completely vanished within a minute. The smell was intensely malty--toasty and grainy. The beer tasted just like this, very malty, a little sweet, some grain astringency and a weird herbaceous hop aftertaste. There is a little nutmeg or cinnamon spiciness and a raw walnut nuttiness. The beer is definitely under-carbonated and feels a little thin."
"Good pour, copper red with a a good head, although it dissipated quickly. Caramel and malty notes on the nose. The mouthfeel has a medium body. I was not a fan of the taste though as the balance between the malt and hops was out of wack and left a slightly astringent finish."
"D- could definitely enjoy a couple playing horseshoes on a nice fall day."
"Poured into a tulip. The body is a clear honey amber color with about three fingers of rocky off white head that leaves sticky lace all along. The smell is full of toasted malt, a touch of honey and bitter hops. The taste follows to be a big grainy and very earthy. The toasted malts are very predominant in the one and the beer has a slight honey sweetness to it. However, the grainy taste is a bit overpowering. The mouthfeel is light and somewhat watery. No complaints on the carbonation and the drinkability is very nice. I could see myself having this around."
"M/D - Lighter body with nice carbonation. The beer was very easy to drink, I thought. The beer was smooth with a light creaminess to it. Overall, this is a solid brew from an excellent brewer and to be honest, I thought that it would have a better rating than it does. I would recommend this beer to anyone."
"Drinkability: Another solid brew from Victory. One I will be seeking out in the future during the season."
"Drinkability: A nice and complex marzen. Very good for the style. I could have several of these."
"Reddish copper in color with perfect clarity. Poured with a light off-white head that reduced to a nice cap. Sweet malty aromas with hints of caramel and ripe apple. Medium to full bodied with ample carbonation. Very smooth and easy to drink. Sweet malty flavors in the beginning with a slightly tangy/spicey flavor in the middle that leadsto a nutty slightly bitter hoppy finish."
"Don't get me wrong i dont hate this ber, its just not a stand out brew that I can rave about."
"D: A pretty drinkable American marzen lager where malts are truly the showcase. The 5.6% ABV is very manageable and although it doesn't have the depth or balance to be an elite Oktoberfest, it's a pretty strong option. Pair it with a beer brat or some potato salad and you're set."
"This is a winner of an oktoberfest for me. Love the malt sweetness, love the nutty flavors, and I love how it wraps up well."
"Very clean and smooth. Goes down very easily. A pretty solid interpretation of the style."
"Drink: a pretty classic representation of the style, Festbier goes down easy and combines perfect measures of European hops and sweet German malts. Who needs Munich?"
"Really surprised i haven't reviewed this before, as I can remember drinking it quite often."
"My boi VDubb86 tipped me off to the quality of this brew, so I gave it a chance in my mixed sixer from DICarlo's. It pours a clear amber orange topped by a finger or so of very light ecru foam. The nose comprises caramel, clove, vanilla, and brown sugar, with a hint of orange in the back. The taste ups the orange's ante slightly, diluting the sweeter notes, but the caramel maintains itself nicely, making up for some of the once-lost ground. The body is a nearly-heavy light, with a light carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a very nice O-Fest, proof that Mike ain't completely crazy just yet."
"D - I really liked this Festbier. It gave a great representation of the style and I kept the ""local brewed"" aspect in mind when enjoying it. If victory had this in a variety case I would not be disappointed."
"Not all O-fest beers are created equal, and Victory Fstbier is one of the better domestic examples I've had. This is one to try during the fall."
"This beer pours a dark amber color with a good size head that stayed throughout. The beer has a sweet complex smell, similar to a marzen style. There is an earthy taste, and its a bit light, but still enjoayble. The taste dose get old a little too quick. overall not bad, but not the best ockotberfest"
"drinkability: was pleasantly surprised with this one, it has everything to expect in the Märzen style, and the progression of the experience is spot-on. If they could make this with a slightly higher abv and maintain the same consistency, it would have put it over the top."
"Pours a medium amber with quickly disappearing quarter inch head with no lacing. Faint malty aroma. Very good burst of rich malt up front with some balancing bitters. Smooth finish, medium body. I can quaff a few of these with no problem. Nice example of style but at almost $10/sixer, I'm not running out to stock up. I'd like to catch this on draft."
"D: mostly fits with the style but is not my favorite due to the cooked grain flavor."
"I was going to grab a keg of Sam's Octoberfest but they were out and this is I was recommended, good choice! Copper color with an amazing head, extremely flavorful October beer that had a wonderful malty finish, bravo to Victory on this amazing October beer which made me come back for multiple rounds!"
"Finger of deep tan foam with a mild orange tint, loose and bubbly, weak retention but does a solid dusting across the surface, the lacing slides easily down the glass sides. Noticeably clear amber copper, mixes in browns, red and oranges, transparent, few bubbles visible inside. Lots of cereal, granola, biscuit and grains in the nose, quinine or mineral water too, pepper spice, takes awhile for a caramel or toffee scents to get going, walnuts, limited but steady orange citrus, no real distinct fruit component. Medium-bodied, there's a strong, wiry carbonation to it which keeps it moving at a brisk pace. Not that sweet, seems closer to the ""traditional"" Märzen recipe with grain, pumpernickel bread, corn husk, walnuts and chestnuts, white pepper. As in the nose, subdued orange citrus as well as peach, pear, yellow apple fruit. Thin patina of milk chocolate and caramel. Overall, it's a nice little brew but not really that interesting."
"not as richly flavored as the scent intimates. clean and caramelly with a refined bittering finish. good toasting. spicy hops--make it kinda refreshing, actually. i was first tempted to express dissatisfaction with the body (it's solid) but i dig it, for style"
"The body is about even, maybe a bit thicker than water, very easy to pound. I'll be getting more of these as we approach Oktoberfest season."
"Overall, one is enough for me. Not one of my favorite Fest brews ever by any means. I hate to slam a beer, but this one just misses the mark completely for me."
"Not a bad beer, overall. It's good that these fall beers are starting to come out more now, and though this isn't my favorite, it's getting me in the autumn state of mind. Give me a bit more aroma and a little more in the flavor department and this would be a pretty nice beer."
"Drinkability- easy drinking and goes down really easy, level of dryness and hops keeps you able drink and want more, not my favorite October of year but decent example of the style that wasn't hard to finish the 6er"
"Pours a dark brown with a nice, sturdy tan head and good lacing. Smell is doughy bread with some night, light fruit and caramel touches to it. Taste is similar, with a nice sweet maltiness coming through. I really like the balance they've struck between the flavors, as well as the overall intensity. Mouthfeel is nice, creamy, and rich without being filling. Drinkability is very nice. I believe this is my favorite American version of the style to date."
"D - Victory always impresses with very authentic German style brews. A terrific amount of flavor for a 5+ ABV brew. Clean flavors provide for high drinkability."
"Morey's Bottom Line: An above average Octoberfest. Slightly darker in color and bolder in taste than others I've had within the style."
"A winner."
"Very drinkable, nice fall beverage, but easily could be a year round beer. Nice job Victory!"
"On tap at Meridian Pint. This is...well...it's a Marzen. It's fine. Don't Marzen's pretty much all taste the same (with the exception of the Kaiser, which I had in the same tasting). What...fairly highly carbonated, full caramel malt flavors with very subtle hops, nice fruity caramel nose, orange-amber color. Tastes like fall. Definitely works, although it's not a style that generally bowls me over."
"d- I could drink this for a while. Good beer."
"Anyway, nice pour, bright autumn orangey amber color with an ample head. Nice aroma of pale malts, honey, and a nice dry noble (?) hop background. Almost reminiscent of Honey Nut Cheerios. Really nice and balanced flavor as well - this interesting honey note is in the forefront, nice lager-y malt, toast and caramel, and a great herbal hop finish. Very smooth on the palate, yet crisp, and highly quaffable. I've decided that Victory can really pull off some German style brews. Definitely a great fall beer and something I'd drink anytime."
"D: This is one of the better Octoberfest beers that I've had, and I will drink this again"
"pours a golden copper color with very fast receding head then a beige ring lacing on side of glass,,,smell is caramel malts,bread and spice..taste is malt forward sweet caramel vienna lager tasting some bread and nutmeg..mouth feel is medium moderate carbonation..good taste and easy to drink,,not my favorite marzen but still solid enough"
"This beer hardly excites me, one of the more forgettable Oktoberfest beers."
"D - High. This is what a celebration brew should be all the way around."
"D: A very solid, drinkable beer. I like this one in the fall. Not sure if I could drink it year round, but one I would certainly turn to when given the option."
"Victory Brewing Company Victory Festbier--A Rich Amber Lager In The Tradition Of Oktoberfest--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 5.60% ABV. 30 IBU's? (4.25 / 5.0) Oktoberfest--Marzen. Lacy medium off white head. Clear bright pretty rich thin fizzy head sustaining amber color. Immediately Quenching mild sweet biscuit caramel fruit hint tasty smooth Marzen Fest body. Mild sweet hop East Coast Lager malty fruit hint Fest! end. Sampled 9/13-14/2010. 6-Pack for $6.99 Purchased at The Ballard Market, Seattle, Washington 9/2/2010."
"Copper appearance, head dissapates upon the pour, very little lacing. The aroma is fruity/malty. The taste is malty-goodiness. A slight hint of yeast, intermingled with some simple fruit flavor and a return of malt on the finish. Not a long lasting finish, but it doesnt need to be. This beer is to the point. Mouthfeel has a perfect amount of carbonation. In summary, i could see myself sitting around with friends on a fall day on the deck drinking a few of these. Very drinkable. Seek it out and try one on for yourself."
"O - One of my favorite marzens, a good example of the style."
"Pours orange with a nice white head of foam that slowly fades. The aroma is of citrus and orange zest along with caramel malts. The taste is of German malt and slight German hop taste on the back of the tongue. There is also taste of white grapes and orange. There is a medium body to it with appropriate carbonation. I could seriously sit and drink this all day. I'm thinking that this maybe one of my favorite Oktoberfests out there, but I wonder if that is due to the fact that it's on tap and not out of the bottle. Either way if you have the means I highly recommend it."
"Somewhat filling, but nicely drinkable. I could definitely put back a couple more of these with the wonderful soft pretzels they have here at the brewery. A very solid domestically brewed Marzen."
"It finishes still lightly sweet but dries quite a bit. Some lingering syrupy flavors with more toasty and bready malt lingering, as well as some crisp lager flavors. Now more of the bitterness comes through with some light earthy and mild grassy hop flavors."
"Pours a clear amber with a small head. Big, toasty aromas are dominant, with interesting background notes of Tootsie Rolls and light earthiness. Flavors are more complex than the nose, with tons of toast up front with lighter, breadier and biscuity notes adding more layers to the mix. Finishes with a blend of toast and earth. Body is finely carbonated, full bodied, and rounder than many other marzens. Very nice."
"Pours a very deep rich dark orange color with a just off white head that dissipates quickly and leaves minimal traces of lacing. Pretty big does of peanut shells, almonds and even some roasted chestnuts. Has a deep malted aroma. Taste is full bodied, a little to big for an Oktoberfest but delicious. This is really a mix between an Irish red and an Oktoberfest to me. The malt profile is nice and drinks very smooth. Nice level of carbonation and a great balance but predominantly malty. The drinkability's huge. Big ass malt profile with a nice complexity not usually found in Oktoberfest."
"A nice offering and a recommended version of the style for someone who wants a sixpack of fresh Octoberfest beer."
"Cheers!!!"
"d - A decent beer. Mostly bready and caramel malts; would drink again but probably wouldn't seek out."
"I love hoppy beers but Fall with it's advent of malty Oktoberfest style beers is my favorite season. Victory Festbier will definitely be one of my mainstay Festbiers this year."
"Drinkability: I knew Victory could deliver a solid Marzen, but this was better than expected. Similar to Paulaner, but better executed or perhaps simply fresher."
"I think Victory is at the top of their game when they make German beers. Prima Pils, Festbier, Moonglow Weizenbock, are all awesome beers. Don't get me wrong, i like their other stuff too, but there's just something really special about those beers. if you blindfolded me, i'd probably think this was a Paulaner (i actually think its better, but that's the closest comparison i could get). get one."
"A great fall beer."
"A must have fest beer, terrific. This is my new go to for the style."
"Good brew. Easy to drink, fairly simple. Not something that stands out, but very tasty. Worth drinking and a good seasonal to remember to look for."
"Poured from a bottle, pours amberish copper color with a copious amount of carbonated bubbles coming to the top. About 2 inches of off white head. Strong aroma of malts. Sweet malts of a caramel nature, substantial hop backbone. This is my favorite of the Oktoberfest beers and I look forward to it each year. I normally end up buy a couple cases. And just a side not, I have drank it well into March and it was fine."
"An enjoyable example of the style. Certainly not the greatest but definitely better than some other examples I've seen. It would work well on a day colder than this though."
"This is a great beer. Easy to drink, great flavor and aroma with an amazing feel to it."
"D: Though I'm sipping now, I could definitely see this as a beer to gulp, as in during Oktoberfest. When the harvest is good, you have to celebrate somehow, right?"
"D: This style is designed for heavy consumption, and this might be my favorite rendition of that style. Perhaps a little sweet, and less carbonated than others, but a great fest beer nonetheless."
"D - not bad. a bit too sweet for me."
"D: A decent drinker."
"OVERALL easy drinking, pretty much to style, and flavorful enough. But not exceptional or memorable."
"Taste: Definitely a lager. Malts are toasted, a little carmel and a grassy hop on the palate. Finishes dry and would have been good with some bready food."
"Overall - A good example of the style"
"Serving type: 12oz bottle purchased non-refrigerated on 12/7/2009"
"D - This was a nice Oktoberfest beer with a bit more hops than expected to balance out the malt sweetness. Perhaps a bit too bitter for traditionalists, but I liked it a lot. I'd have no problem drinking these all night."
"This is a heavily malted beer. One of the very best Oktoberfests I've had yet."
"d- really really drinkable and sessionable, this is a great oktoberfest, then again you can't go wrong with victory, i get a case of this every fall really enjoy it (alas, i've only got one left), a go to oktoberfest for sure."
"Easy drinking, a bit over carbonated but not shabby at all."
"mouthfeel is crisp just how a lager should be. It is a very enjoyable brew with very high drinkability."
"Drinkability is pretty good. It goes down easy and is tasty, however not my favorite example of the style. Though I wouldn't mind having a few more and it would make a nice session beer."
"It smelled and tasted like any ordinary lager. It was sweet, malty, and yeasty, with no significance in the flavor or feel. It was refreshing; however, and went very well with pizza."
"Poured a clear brownish red with a quickly dying tan head. A strong roasted/bready malt smell along with minor sweetness and a hint of hop bitterness. A tad thin and watery not too sweet or hoppy but more a of dry, toasted malt taste that leads to a syrupy, dry finish although it finishes clean with only a little bit of crisp hops that tend to citric notes. For some reason I didn't really care for this beer yet I could see myself having a few of them - it is strong and a few will set you right."
"Wow, this is an amazing oktoberfest, one of the best I've ever had. Rich and smooth, nice and sweet and toasty. A nice little bit of hops on the finish for an overall smooth and super drinkable brew."
"Great O-fest, actually best I've had. more hops and malts than the spaten or any imports i've treid"
"If you're into the style, it's worth a try."
"Notes: This beer was very interesting and surprising. The malt was Octoberfest all the way but the hops were crisp snappy German Pilsner and they made for a very tasty combination."
"Drinkability: High. Some of the keg is still left, but not because it filled us up. This was a more sessionable Octoberfest than I had expected. Enjoyed this one."
"Good to have a few of. Drinkable. Best marzen? No. But its a good one. I'd buy more"
"Decent feel, maybe a little thin. Prickly carbonation. Somewhat dry finish. A refreshing, easy drinker."
"very nice to drink in the fall season. has a nice warming effect that you dont get from some oktoberfests. pretty good session beer for the season."
"D: Very drinkable - could be a session beer for some - may be a little too sweet or a little ""rich"" for some to be a session; definitely worth checking out."
"Overall it tastes grounded and earthy but also a bit cheap. looks a little lifeless, too. There are better marzens."
"Overall a nice Ofest that I would drink anytime. Well done."
"D) A nice brew once my palate likened to it. I'd have another."
"Pours from the bottle a nice, clear amber / tea, with a puffy light tan head. The head dissipates pretty quickly to a tiny ring of foam. Smell is, of course, malt heavy; there's also some hints of caramel and earthiness. Taste is nice and malty; a touch nutty - although a tad thin. There's some sweetness, and a very slight touch of hoppiness on the finish. Mouthfeel is good, if a bit thin - its still satisfying. Highly drinkable. Good Oktoberfest from Victory!"
"Mouthfeel could use more carbonation, but decent."
"M/D: Medium bodied, carbonation is a tad high, a bit too prickly on the tongue. Drinkability isn't too bad. Overall, a flawed beer, but not deeply so."
"D: A very good marzen with a big punch of maltiness and a big body for the style. I've come to expect nothing less from Victory. Another very good brew."
"I enjoyed this, although I pretty much knew what I was getting into. Festy is a bit different if only for the way the hops gently come out to play. In most Marzens I really only get big malt globs. I would gladly enjoy a sixer of this in a sitting with the low ABV, but 1/2 way through I probably would be looking for a new style to tackle. I've yet to find a oktoberfest that could hold my interest, either way this is good for a go."
"Victory Festbier is likely to appeal as much (if not more) to the mainstream crowd as it is to craft aficionados. Given its lighter body and lighter flavour it might also go over well with those looking to celebrate Oktoberfest in the stereotypically gluttonous and over-indulgent fashion. As for me, I'll likely celebrate it responsibly - and with a different beer."
"D= I liked this beer a lot...very fresh and refreshingly crisp/clean. A highly sessionable oktoberfest beer."
"Overall a nice marzen, particularly for one made in america. A good choice for the marzen fan during the fall. Good brew."
"The mouth on this one is a bit harsh. This is way overly carbonated. Hinders drinkability a bit. Fresh slight hoppy bite at the onset, but this finishes mellow and slightly sweet. I really like the aftertaste on this. Nice bready flavor going on. Not too bad of a beer here."
"Just a solid take on an O-Fest by Victory. Of all the times I've had this in the bottle over the last few years, I believe that this was the first time that I've had it on draft. I'm glad that I did."
"There's a medium body that almost seems fuller than it is. This one feels creamy but has a very nice crispness with a light carbonation."
"D - Not my favorite style but a nice offering from the local Victory...this one comes across sweet at first but leaves you with a nice hoppy ending"
"Nothing too strong, but a perfect session beer for a session beer style."
"Great Oktoberfest brew."
"Overall, very pleasant O-fest bier. Very welcoming to the season, just looking for a little more flavor and body next time."
"Drinkability: all day"
"A really nice Marzen. More traditional than other American Oktoberfests, but still hoppier than imports. I like the hops in this, adds some fruitiness that works well with the maltiness. I also like that its not too sweet. Very clean and very drinkable Marzen."
"D - Nice beer and could easily have this one with some brats and krat sitting in a parking lot waiting for the game to start."
"Poured from a growler. Has an amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very mild, slightly sweet. Taste is very easy drinknig, malty and finishing a tad bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this is a pretty good selection."
"I'm very impressed with this brew. I don't know why it gets a low average (thats assuming you think a B is low) but it is what it is. In my opinion, and mine is the only one that matters in my review, this is a very good representation of the style, and a very good fall session brew. I will definitely be purchasing this again."
"Surprisingly very full bodied and chewy, especially for the style with a lot of sweet malt and fall spices. Hints of cinnamon, brown sugar, biscuit, and that slight toasted malt flavor that the aroma alluded to. There is also a very subtle hop presence which provided an excellent balance of bitterness to the sweet malts and spice notes. An excellent example of an American interpretation of the style but I can't really see to many Germans liking it. Either way I highly recommend it."
"Drinkability: I love this beer. Victory has always produced quality beer, and this one is one of my favorites. Perfect for a cool autumn night. I have enjoyed this beer for years, and will continue to do so."
"A middle of the road Octoberfest beer, easy to drink and always available in this area. Solid."
"D -- The nutty character definitely leans this more to an American take on the style, but the boldness of the smooth maltiness throughout makes it a definite top of the available beers. It's, well-balanced in all categories and smooth to drink."
"Pours clear medium amber, w/ a slight golden hue. Typical khaki head, moderate retention and then a film, collar and upon a moderate swirl, the appearance ofminor spots of lace. Dull malty nose. Pretty typical O'fest brew, the expected smooth malt, the expected clean bready notes, the expected easy to drink quality. Never been my favorite style, on the dull side IMHO. This one fit my expectations. Works in a marinade if you have more of this type of brew sitting around and you are not real interested in drinking more of it..."
"Beer has a very bold rich autum color. Froty head and numerus happybubble to the top of the glass. Smells of clove,pumkin, and spices. Very distinguished flavors in the taste. Carmel and harvest tones make this beer tasty. Has a very smooth mouthfeel and goes down fast. I find this to be a quaility beer, victory usually produces excellent beers."
"D: I mean it's inoffensive, sort of, and thin. I suppose that makes drinkability, but no, not really."
"This is a very drinkable Octoberfest. Very smooth, with a clean finish. From a lager perspective, I really like it. I was expecting a different finish, thinking there would be more bite at the end. Nothing like that at all...very smooth. This is a beer that should be available all year long."
"Tastes like toasty bread with a bit of malt sweetness. A slight amount of caramel is in there to, but this seems quite biscuity to me. Overall pretty good, but also a little boring. The good thing is that is full and not too heavy, so I could drink many, which is also nice."
"This beer pours a clear golden amber color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes rather quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of biscuits and caramel with no real hop presence. The taste is like the aroma, but with the addition of a nice light hop bite in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a smooth texture and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a really nice Oktoberfest. I would like to get some more life out of the aroma, but other than that it is really solid."
"D: Good session beer that feels right for the season. Not the best Oktoberfest around, but quite good."
"Poured a nice light copper color with a bit of head and no lacing. Nice clean malty scent, but not very deep or strong. Nice amber ale flavor, but nothing deep or fall-like that an oktoberfest should have. Goes down fine. This would make a slightly above average amber ale, but as far as the deeper complexities that an oktoberfest should have, it just wasn't quite there. Not a bad brew, just not a great marzen."
"overall a good brew."
"D - Good overall. Not a big fan of oktoberfests, but this one was good."
"D: A well made, drinkable beer."
"D: Good fall session beer in the spirit of Octoberfest."
"This is quite robust in my opinion, but still is quite drinkable. Will go good with seasonal brats and pork."
"Highly recommended..."
"Definitely a sessionable one."
"D- My initial reaction to this beer is that it reminds me of Fat Tire. I like it but it probably isn't my favorite octoberfest beer. It is an enjoyable beer and pretty easy drinking."
"This has got to be one of the better October/Marzen beers I've had. The aromas and flavors are appropriately complex--bready and nutty with a smooth malty sweetness-- but overall, the beer is subdued enough that your palate never gets fried. This beer would pair great with a lot of foods. Beyond that, Octoberfest beer is supposed to be eminently drinkable and this one has got drinkability in SPADES. This beer is so clean that it exudes quality by its subtlety. I'm gonna go broke this fall!"
"I love good Oktoberfests and Victory's version is no exception. Very drinkable, but caution: a six pack may not be enough."
"D: Overall, a decent American made Octoberfest. I found this one to be a little too bready for my taste, and not enough sweetness and spice. Not bad, but there are better domestic Marzens out there."
"Not bad, not great. But so far this year of the maybe 8 or so micro and german OKfestsbiers I've had, none have been the shit. Poured and ok medium to small off white head and bit of lace. Color is a nice medium amber. Aroma is very nice; malty and a bit spicy. Flavor is 'bout the same. Body's a tad thin. 'S'okay. Nothing to write home about. Drinkable. Session beer. Body's ok too."
"Easy drinking, nice session beer and big props on the bottle artwork."
"Overall a slightly underwhelming example of Marzen, but solid all around."
"Poured into a pint glass it's orange amber in color. The head is about a half an inch and beige in color. Not much lacing is left on my glass. The aroma malty and sweet. Some hops can be detected but only after a good hard whiff. The flavor is malt with a hint of caramel sweetness. Hops are there but, not real strong. It has a flowery finish. The mouthfell is medium to light. A tad watery. Lots of carbonation. Another American Marzen beer that I feel is lacking. I'm going to try to stick to European Marzens for now on if this keeps up."
"Pours from the bottle to a hazy burnt orange with very little head or lacing, and a nose that is malty cookie dough and candy, with a faint side of hops, apples and citrus fruit. Mourthfeel is fairly flat and non-descript, and I actually picked up the hoopy apples more than the malt side in the taste. No alcohol ever makes itself know, and the finish is so-so."
"Perhaps I just had a bad bottle? I don't know. All I really know is that I wasn't impressed by this brew. I paid $10 for a beer that tasted like a Yuengling (which I could've gotten for half the price). Is it a bad beer -- no, its just a beer that lacks concentration and leaves a mild-mannered impression. Hopefully next year's will be up to par."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a hazed golden amber color with about two fingers of pillowy off white foam. Nose and flavors are of medium toasted grains, a good dose of sweet malt, grassy, fruity hops. A notch or two better than medium bodied and adequately carbonated for it's style. One of my favorite marzens. By all means, check it out if you are a fan."
"Somewhat malty on the tongue, thick and simple with a uniform malt presence and a touch of woodsy spice. Rather bitter and smoky on the finish in sharp contrast to the initial sweetness. Carbonation was high and resulted in some oscillation between sweet and dry in the second half of the glass. Too confusing to reach for again."
"Mostly clear copper with a smallish head of foam. Slight caramel nose with some toasted grain and light citrus and herbs. Flavour is rich malt with some light fruit and toasted character. Hints of coffee. Light bodied and quite fizzy, fairly dry and very drinkable."
"It is a drinkable beer. If it did not have that off finish, it would be much better."
"Drinkability: This is a very tasty and drinkable beer and I could do several in an evening. One of the nicest festbiers I've tried."
"Not a mold-breaking Marzen by any stretch and not the normal cut-above job achieved by Victory. Still, this isn't nearly as bad as other reviewers have mentioned and I find this to be plenty drinkable even a month after its freshness date has expired."
"Poured into a regular pint glass this beer produced a amber hue with a short lasting 1 finger white head. The aroma smells like like malts and perhaps sugar/something sweet. The carbonation is light but the taste is not great. I felt like this beer really goes outside of the regular Marzen characterization. Unfortunately this is not a repeat for me."
"I have heard much from Victory, but I just don't get this one. I do like the style, but this is off. A bit too free-wheeling in the interpretation of Festbier."
"Festbier is an above-average Marzen and one of the better American examples I've had. Recommended for those of us who can't afford a trip to Munich. This is good beer."
"Overall - the taste experience is one dimensional form start to finish. A good brew that is very sessionable."
"Not my favorite from Victory."
"I prefer Harpoon Octoberfest to this one because it has a deeper malt flavor. I'll probably give this another try next October."
"Retained itself very well despite being near the end of shelf life."
"All in all, not my favorite Oktoberfest by any stretch. I had to force myself to finish it."
"I just found this in the back of my fridge and I forgot how good it is. This particular one is not the freshest Victory Festbier I've had as I bought this in October and its been sitting in my fridge for almost 4 months, but its still great. Honestly one of my favorite Oktoberfest beers. I put this one up there with Paulaner and Spaten. Best American Oktoberfest I've had so far. Obviously you probably wont be finding this very easily right now and perhaps it may be best to wait for August of this year to try it for the first time. Sweet and malty, crisp and clean, very drinkable. Highly recommended for Oktoberfest fans."
"EDIT: Bottle was in fact past it's Enjoy by date...but they must be drank."
"D: The highlight perhaps is they are drinkable, but who'd want to?, certainly not I."
"This is nothing to seek out, but a decent brew that hits the style spot on."
"The amber bodied beer was amply carbonated, and readily formed a durable three finger thick, head. The smell was sweet and malty with slight hints of cooked corn. The taste was driven by honey dipped bread sweetness of the malt with some counter taste by spicy hops. The body was thicker than typical for the style and aftertaste had a touch of sourness. One of the better festbiers I've had."
"Orange tinted amber with a tight white head that quickly recedes after pouring. Smells of bready yeast and sweet maltiness. Tastes very rich and malty without being sweet, something like fresh pumpernickel with fresh butter flavor. Mouthfeel is fairly light and crisp, highly drinkable. Really nice, probably the best U.S. made oktoberfest i've had."
"Pours clear amber with a short head. Pleasant lager aroma; sweet caramel, straw, and corn. Taste is watery and flat for the style. Bread dough, metal, graham cracker, and corn. Wanted more and didn't get it. I am convicnced that marzens and me just do not go together."
"Terrific drinkability - pleasant to smell, taste, and easy on the palate."
"Original tasting - Nov 12, 2007. Pours a darkish copper with a thin head. Aroma is over sweetened malts, sort of a faint vomit smell. Flavor also has an overpowering sweetness of malts, grains and caramel syrup. I think this the first beer from Victory I have not been impressed with."
"The drink is light-bodied, lightly-carbonated, and heavy on the drinkability."
"M/D - not a bad beer for the style, not a whole lot of flavor but a good beer overall."
"I like this a lot."
"D: Excellent drinkability. I would highly recommend that you drink this offering from Victory. It is delicious and a great example of the style. I could drink this all day."
"A medium to light amber color, with a light beige head forming on top, that is two inches thick. Then it quickly dissolves away, to being very feint appearance along the sides the glass. A strong maltiness at the front of the aroma. That is followed by bread and biscuit fragrances. There is a lemon citrus scent in at the end. The malt is very dominant right at the front of each taste. There is a very feint grassy bitterness at the end. A thin feel at the front, it gradually gains weight as flows across the palate. I am of the believe that there is no such thing as an undrinkable oktoberfest/marzen. This beer fits that believe, though a littlr more hop character would be nice to balance it out better."
"Mouthfeel was slick and somewhat zesty."
"This is worth a try if you enjoy the style or not."
"Medium body, malty and biscuity. Not a whole lot of spiciness or hoppiness here, but the body doesn't stand out all that well. A far thinner body than I recall from my last time tasting, I never thought I'd call a Victory offering ""watery", but that's the impression I'm getting. It's pretty clean, but there's not a lot behind it. Feels a little dead, could use some more carbonation. Easily sessionable, but this time around I get so much worse an impression than when I first tried it this year that I wonder if my bottle didn't hold up in the 2 months since purchase."
"an alright Oktoberfest, but I was expecting a bit more from Victory."
"This beer pours a nice copper color with a bit of foam atop it. A big bready aroma with some earthy notes. A medium body greets the palate in a pleasing way. Big, but nice, malt flavors. Slightly sweet bread flavors with some background huskiness. The beer finishes with some spiciness. A clean malty beer with decent drinkability. A good beer for the best of seasons."
"3.0 D: It's the pungency in the taste that lowers the drinkability by quite a bit."
"D- I would definately go for this again. Probably not something that I would sit around and knock down, but one that I would love to pair with food."
"A dark orange body with a swiftly descending head that leaves no trace--semi-opaque... solid malt aroma with hints of fruitiness to develop a sense of complexity.. slightly effervescent, with a mellow, medium body that is pleasantly fulfilling... smooth, malty presence in the back of the mouth; little hops to speak of, but at this refreshing a taste, they'd only get in the way! Hops actually manifest on the teeth in time (by mid glass)... this lager is easy drinking--I could have finished the six-pack tonight--and leaves room for improvement, in the sense that it fits the season well but would not be sought out of it....another Victory."
"D: A session beer all the way. Gimme more."
"D: Good, a wonderful fest bier. Wish it was on the shelves in Tampa."
"Drinkable for a few pints, sure, but Sessionable? At 5.6% I'm not so sure that is the right description."
"It's really good, and if you actually prefer the maltier Marzen to the more balanced ones, this one could arguably be one of if not THE best around. Personal preference will dicatate how much you like this one, but I don't think anyone will argue with the beer being exactly what they were shooting for."
"I could have several of these. not bad within style except for the near non-existent aroma"
"D: Very drinkable beer, this was one of the more flavorful marzens done by American brewers. In fact this is one of the better marzens because of the amount and balance of flavor it has."
"Victory impresses yet again with another German-style lager!"
"D - Very high. Light and refreshing despite its maltiness."
"This came as a big shock and disappointment to me, because all of the other brews I've had from victory has been really tasty and bold, this one just screams mediocrity. Sorry Victory."
"This was drunk on-tap from a red plastic cup, so I'm not exactly sure what it looked like. It smelled like lemon hops and hearty wheat with some earthy barley and hints of sweet vanilla. It tasted like mild but zesty lemon hops with creamy vanilla and barley malt. It was oily with a bit of carbonation, and had a semi-sweet aftertaste. Overall this was more like a lager than an ale, but seemed like a fitting traditional Oktoberfest. It had a clean and enjoyable taste, good body, and was definitely easy to drink. Victory!"
"Drinkability - This category should probably be weighted more heavily for Oktoberfests, since sessionability is the point. Anyway, this beer is true to style: good flavor, but not overpowering, not overwhelming with alcohol, and refreshing. I wouldn't mind having a few of these."
"it contained very to little head in a pour from bottle to tulip glass, color was a slight copper-amber tone. little to no taste but that of skunk. not much aftertaste, allowing for the posibilty to finish a glass; give a six-pack a few days. not recommended."
"Mouthfeel is nice and crisp, but a little thin."
"Very easy to drink but seems a bit watered down."
"I'm guessing that I got a bad bottle. I hope I did, as otherwise this is big disappointment."
"Bottle / Artwork - Great label featuring very basic figures working over a wooden tub... Blue purple label with red and white font... Simple but different..."
"Saw this Victory offering for the first time so picked up a single to give it a try. It's a pretty decent beer, an easy drinking octoberfest. Leans more to the sweet side than the toasted side but not overly sweet. Worth a try."
"Pours transparent brown with a light foamy head. Nose is slightly malty with hints of alcohol. Taste is light with some sweet caramel malts. Not a lot of complexity, but refreshing. Easy drinking, you can definitely down several without a problem."
"Pours a clean orange-ish/ copper color, with a light tan/ off white head. In the aroma, earthy, sweet malt, and a small hop backing. In the taste, a small, sweet roasty malt, with a balanceing small hop. A small hop bitterness and medium mouthfeel, with a dry, lager-ish hop in the aftertaste. Nice balance, nice fall-ish beer, and a bit bit bigger than standard."
"The taste is toasted, bready grains, some caramel maltiness, some spices in the allspice family, a touch of the red ale in this beer with a backbone of some florals. The spices, the floral hops, the slight hop bite in the finish, and the smooth drinkability of the beer makes this one worth revisiting. L'Chaim."
"Note: Will have to revisit the next bottle of this to see if this beer is indeed as it appears before me now."
"The beer poured a clear, deep amber with a thin white head into a pint glass. The aroma was of sweet caramel malt, and not much else. The taste was of sweet malt, with caramel undertones and a very subdued hop profile. Nice carbonation and lacing. Seems to be a fairly accurate representation of the festbier style."
"Everything I expect from an Octoberfest"
"Very drinkable, but kinda steep with the $10 per sixer price."
"For me, this was scary drinkable. No off-flavors at all. Definitely my favorite so far of the season. That may have had something to do with it."
"D- easy to put this down. A sixer would be gone in hours. This is a perfect beer for doing yardwork on a saturday!"
"d: exceptionally drinkable, as the style tends to be. Not overly sweet, but the flavor is a bit light. Still, its a good offering and an enjoyable brew."
"This is an tasty Octoberfest with a nice crisp malt backbone. I thought the lack of lace made the beer look a bit flat and the aroma needs to be a bit stronger."
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. This beer pours a dark, clear copper color with a quickly receding head. The beer smells of a sweet bread. The taste is heavy on sweet malt, the finish is crisp and clean. The beer has a light to medium body with light carbonation. This beer is very drinkable. A good Oktoberfest."
"HV"
"Drinkability is good mainly because of the perfect mouthfeel. There is nothing exceptional about the taste of this beer, but there is nothing bad either. An above average beer that I wouldn't go out and get, but I would drink it if handed one..."
"D- This is a nice O-fest. I bought this last year but made bread with it rather than drinking it (good bread too). It has a nice hop character to it and had the nice caramel malt flavor that I like. Good, very drinkable beer."
"Overall, not a bad Oktoberfest. I'm finding I don't much care for the style. I don't like the toasted biscuit flavors."
"I'm not a huge fan of lagers, but this beer really hits the spot. Overall a great Oktoberfest beer from Victory. Well worth a try."
"Great burnt orange color, very good clarity, looks pretty lively in the glass. Foamy white head builds up and drops to a thin froth. Smell is lagerish, some subdued sweetness in there, a bit of sharp malt. Taste has a good amount of toasted malt, a nice full flavor to it. Semi-sweet ending... I could drink a lot of this beer. I think they nailed the flavor that is acceptable for Marzen's. Good mouthfeel, not too watery, not too big. One of the better Marzen's out there. Might have to take this head to head with Hacker-Pschorr's Oktoberfest."
"D- my favorite october fest beer so far and another victory success. this brewery hasnt done anything wrong in my book. something i could drink several of, and will be sad to see removed from the shelves once the season is over. check this one out people!"
"D: I'm a believer. This is the best I've had so far!"
"Good body and smooth feel. I like this Festbier."
"D - This stuff goes down great. No real off flavors, and while the flavor is simple overall, it is very good. An easy beer to session without getting wrapped up in nuance."
"Nice O-fest offering from Victory. Not my favorite but easily one of the best American ones out there."
"Has nice drinkability qualites with the light body and low ABV. Just a little sweeter than I prefer in my beer."
"Pours a semi-transparent copper color with a small slightly sticky off white head. Not much going on in the nose, but it is clean, some roasted malts. The brew is bright and balanced, good strong malts but not over kill on the 'toasty' character, nice citrusy hop notes. No off flavors which is a definite plus to this years recipe. Light bodied, no alcohol presence and very drinkable. Definitely one to pick up this season."
"Pours a bubbly, clear reddish amber with a good-sized off-white head that lingers as a cap for a while and leaves a little bit of lacing. Roasted caramel malts dominate the nose with a bit of sweetness of vanilla as well. The hops are present but subdued in the aroma. The taste is even sweeter than the aroma indicates with a much more bready malt backbone and tons of caramel and vanilla sweetness. There is a bit of earthy hops in the finish leaving a little bitterness. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied - crisp and clean with good carbonation. Not overly complex, this brew is definitely drinkable and a good representation of the style."
"I found this to be rather drinkable and enjoyable. For whatever reason, most of the Oktoberfest brews I have tried this year seem to be on the dry side and I personally like them toward the malty sweet side. None the less, this was good and I would certainly order it again."
"Very drinkable, but alas, the flavor profile is lacking. I expected more from these guys"
"Nuts and grains in the taste, alongside a hint of caramel. A bit of spicy earthiness / grassiness. A well-balanced flavor. Finishes dry, and here arose my area of concern. The nutty taste and exceptionally dry finish left my palate with the thick impression of having just eaten unsalted nuts. Not great, and a bit surprising, because I otherwise found the Festbier to be medium-bodied and nicely carbonated, crisp and refreshing."
"GC"
"D: Very drinkable. Subtle ABV."
"Served: in a standard pint glass"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle a nice amber/orange color with a head that lasted maybe 10 seconds, no lacing at all. Aroma of caramel, malts and some spices. Pleasant taste, with some caramel and spice. Full bodied and pretty smooth with a touch of hops. Carbonation is not too heavy, very little if any. A good beer for the fall."
"A very good example of one of my favorite beer styles."
"Note: when I first had this on my tap system, I was not too impressed at all. But after having it on a couple of weeks now, this has really grown on me and is something I will have again."
"I am a marzen fan, and Victory doesn't dissapoint with a good interpretation of the style. It's not mind blowing, but it is tasty and I could easily drink quite a few of these back to back and still come back for more. Prost!"
"Overall this beer really doesn't differentiate itself from any other Ofests, but it's a solid offering. Worth a shot."
"Pours a nice coppor color with a small and short lived head that settled into nothing, bit disappointing. The aroma is of a steely caramel malt, bit bready and grainy. The taste has a nice bready malt base, caramel, touch of grain, not much noticable hops; pretty clean. Nice moderate feel, with semi-soft carbonation, chewy; finishes slightly dry. An good example of an American Oktoberfest; nice bready caramel malt. I expected a bit more of a hop presence from Victory but this malty lager does well."
"Poured dark copper with an ample, beige head, which quickly dissipated. It has relatively good lacing throughout. The scent is slightly of malt and hops. The taste is much like the scent - malty at first. Slightly sweet, but finishes with hoppy bitterness. Overall, not a bad O'fest beer."
"Mouthfeel is good, medium body, medium to low carbonation. Very drinkable and a likely candidate for session beer of the autumn. As the temps didn't even hit 60 today, I think of this as a great beer to lead into the cooler months ahead."
"Drinkability here is lower for me. I can tell from others in the style what I think this should be - clean, crisp, with a light hop feel and a nice and easy mouthfeel and drinkability. I can't say that this doesn't match that profile, but what I can say is that it doesn't do it very well, at least the way I like it. Theres better out there but this is a good try."
"The body is moderate with a nice balance sweetness. Good light carbonation. Overall, there are very few faults and very clean tasty beer. My problem is the malt bill. Would like the toasty caramel flavor to come out. Really tough for me to knock this beer. Sigh."
"The 5.6% ABV does not assert itself in such a way as to be obvious. Not hard to enjoy more than one and I intend to do so. I didn't expect to be disappointed by a Victory product and I definitely wasn't with this one."
"Notes: An o.k. beer with good drinkability.Decent balance and while I may have expected more I can not say this was not worthy."
"My friend picked up a growler of this from the brewery and claims the beer tastes better from the growler. I will try it out and write a review on that; I am hoping for a better drinking experience with a ""more fresh"" Festbier."
"D - Not overly strong in alchohol, not too thick on the palate clean finish all make this a great beer to serve for your home Oktoberfest party."
"D: Half the reason people overlook this style is that the beer must be fresh. By the time most of the German imports get over here they are past their prime. When they are fresh they are a wonderful style. Really well done by Victory."
"Don't drink and review."
"D: This is a really good marzen, my first of the season, even though it is only August. I would not hesitate to have this again, this is one of the best Oktoberfests I've ever had."
"I have loved the Victory label, so I was excited to give this beer a whirl. The best I can say of this beer is that it is unremarkable. It certainly lacks complexity. I am certain it's intent is a munich-like style Octoberfest, but falls a bit flat. It looks wonderful, pours great, but generally stops there. The slightly malty nose is also a nice compliment. The taste seems hopless with some floral and fruit (Pear/apples?) undertones. It is medium bodied and copper colored and has a bit of a dry finish. I love Octoberfest beers, but this one left me a bit flat."
"M + D: Medium body, a subtle ABV - easy drinking, and something I look forward to retrying hot and fresh this fall, because the older brew manages to do alright."
"It pours a lovely reddish amber with light head. There is a pleasant but slight malty aroma. The flavor is of a perfect amber malt character with a light floral hop flavor, with hints of pear and apple on the finish. The mouthfeel is light, but more than a mere throwaway draft beer. This is an outstandingly drinkable beer, worth far more than the sum of its parts."
"Good typical marzen abv makes this a fine drinker and something that won't knock you down before the nights begun. Good one Victory!"
"Overall, a very drinkable brew. One of the better American representations of the style, not as unique as some Marzens/'Festbiers, but very accessable."
"D: This is one drinkable lager. The sweetness is nice balanced. I can't wait until the Victory Fall Fest."
"D: Drinkability was smooth though not as sweet as typical marzens, dry, hoppy with some wet grains make for a nice fest style."
"Overall, very easy to drink. Flavors are very mild, but not in a bad way. Very smooth and light in the mouth. Nothing bold going on here, but very good, probably my favorite of this style I had this year."
"overall, very good. i was hoping for more richness, but the beer is so nuanced and balanced that even without the weight it's delicious."
"·	Drinkability: Little complex flavor, but very drinkable. Easy to enjoy a few."
"Pours a clear amber that has a brownish/orange hue to it. Crème head. This beer just looks good. Nose has some leafy character to it. Just earthy overall. Flavor is vibrant and full. Nice deeper leaf tone to it. Very, very minor roasted thing going on. Leaves what I think is an inky aftertaste. Feel has a very good level of carbonation to it and the liquid is good. Overall a good marzen. Probably a bit too deep to make a session out of it, but would probably pair very well with food."
"This Festbier pours a clear copper color with a thin white head. The aroma is moderately malty, toasty, bread-like and slightly sweet. The flavor is highly malty; bready and a bit spicy. The hop bitterness is medium-low and there is just a hint of hop flavor at the swallow. The after taste is good, a bit different than most Fests, a bit nutty. The body is full and carbonation is medium with a very smooth swallow. Overall a well done Fest, smooth and a bit of a unique aftertaste, recommend."
"Overall- I thought I had reviewed this one already, but I guess not. I found it in the back of my fridge and thought what the heck. It is a warm day here, so it really hit the spot. Very good Octoberfest/Marzen brew. Cannot wait to revisit this one again next year!"
"Another solid offering from a great company... have not been dissapointed by any brews from Victory... Strange to say, I copped this Oktoberfest beer in late Decemeber, probably being only one of two six-packs left at Bottle King in Glen Ridge... best before January 14, so I still got some time to enjoy this one... Pours a brownish copper color with a ruby red glow... smell is very buttery and creamy... The taste is great, with caramel, vanilla, butter, and bread flavors... The best thing about this beer is that it went down so easily... like drinking water... mouthfeel was equally exceptional, and although this isn't the most flavorful offering I've sampled from Victory, it's clean, creamy taste truly satisfies... will definitely purchase this again next autumn... Certainly recommended..."
"This beer is great by sight, good by nose, and solid in the flavor department. For certain one of the better domestics of the style."
"On draught at the Mill Hill Saloon in Trenton, NJ: The beer pours a clear copper color with a medium thin light beige head that dissipates slowly. Spotty lacing. Light malt and caramel along with hops in the nose. Medium body with a soft mouthfeel. Flavors of toasted malt and caramel, plus mild hops and fruit. The finish is sweet malt and a hint of hops. Slightly above average all around."
"A seriously easy drinking beer. Another solid offering from Victory."
"Nothing too special but a good example of an american oktoberfest."
"This beer comes out a beautiful amber, very appetizing and inviting. Aroma is fairly strong and malty, not complex but pleasing. Flavor is richly malty with just a hint of spice and no hoppy bitterness. Texture is very smooth. Lip-smacking and easy on the palate, this is a decidedly drinkable beer - good from bottles, but better on tap."
"Overall: An excellent American Oktoberfest brew. I could easily drink a few more of these. This one is a must try if you're a fan of Oktoberfest biers."
"D - I could enjoy a few of these easily. Very pleasant to drink."
"D - A very drinkable Octoberfest/Marzen that is darker than most, but is more flavorful and overall very quaffable. It is a style that is for celebration and this one is fit for it. I am glad this is one of PA's best festbiers since I have been a fest fan since visiting Germany in '92, this one makes PA proud."
"This is one of the two or three best oktoberfests I've had. Very good beer."
"D: Nothing overly outstanding about this, but it's a solid choice for a seasonal fall lager. Taste and mouthfeel are both good and ABV is a modest 5.6%; boding well for choosing this as a session beer when the temperatures start to drop. Wouldn't hunt this down but would have it again. Thanks for sending, Jeff."
"Good Oktoberfest beer but I like others like Summit, SA better"
"mouth feel is a bit on the thin side, but makes sense, when combined with it's other attributes. crisp and cleans up nicely without being dry, very well crafted in that respect. drinkability was verygood, this is a quality sessionable beer that some thought was put into. somewhat mild and unassuming, but well worth a try. reminds me of an english bitter a little."
"D - All in all, nothing spectacular here, but a decent brew that everyone should at least try once. I could definitely have a few, and next season, I will try a few more."
"Overall, a fantastic beer for this time of year, or anytime for that matter."
"Unusually smooth, nice body. A bit of Yuengling-like milkyness. Smooth feel perfectly offsets that bitterness. It's really delicious and easy to drink. A truly excellent fall brew. Drinkable but not thin."
"Not too bad. One of the better American-brewed Märzens that I've had this season. They really don't hold up to the German versions though. But kudos to Victory and their victory at the GABF. This one's for you!"
"M&D - a typical high quality marzen, not top tier, but well above average, the beer neatly fits into the niche it was seemingly brewed for, well done Victory"
"The 5.60% ABV can hardly be detected here, and unlike some other Octoberfests that I've had, this doesn't have much of a warming effect to it. All in all, this is a pretty average beer and a good way to start off the transition into the darker beers of this time of the year!"
"I was expecting a little better from Victory. This one seemed boring, to sum it up in one word. The flavors were there, they just weren't anything to be excited about. Not recommended."
"Pours a crisp deep amber with almost no head. Aroma is some caramel malts, but somewhat weak. Taste is caramel, sweet malts, some dried fruits and a hint of hops. The beer is light to medium bodied and very crisp and refreshing. This is a decently enjoyable version of the style."
"best by Feb 24, 2008...single bottle from WF Raleigh"
"Pours amber with a thin, off-white head. The aroma seems slight skunked. If it's the hops, they're rather musky and not welcomed. Can't really detect any maltiness in the aroma. The mouthfeel is a little on the thin side. Festbier is a malty lager with a touch of hop bitterness. An ale fruitiness is introduced in the middle and lingers into and almost unnoticeable finish. Overall, I was not impressed by this example of an Oktoberfest."
"The bottom line: Oktoberfest is what it is, a lighter bodied, softly malty Fall quaffer. Of the major micros I've had in the style, this is one of the better examples. Ideally suited for a dimple style pint glass on a crisp Fall day with the window open."
"D: Excellent. Highly quaffable. I could imagine myself at Oktoberfest in Germany downing mug after mug of this, all day long. It's flavorful enough to keep you interested but light enough to keep 'em coming."
"i was inspired to get this one by their other styles; pours a clear copper color w/ a very slight head which dissapates quickly, minimal lacing; not the strong malty aroma I expected, more fusels than anything; the taste was malty w/ notes of caramel a slightly ""alcoholic"" aftertaste & a little thin; again i'm getting that kinda ""watered-down"" feeling here, a light-med body w/ slight dextrins; not an unlikable brew at all, tho, i'd drink it again"
"I have had this beer from the tap and by bottle. Each time, it offers up a clear, clean copper color, little to no head, and a sweet, brown sugar aroma and maltiness. The taste is smooth, malty, and for a drinkable as I find this beer to be, the malt gives it some substance and there are enough hops to give it a little bite. Unlike many Octoberfests, where there is a roasted malt or dark molasses taste, this beer is on the sweeter side of this style, but it works well and makes for a well rounded autumn beer. This beer will appear to a broad spectrum of people because it bridges darker fall beers and amber lagers."
"Nothing special, but certainly an enjoyable brew that does seem to hit the spot this time of year. Probably would've liked it more if it were ""imperialized", ha!"
"Certainly not the most complex of oktoberfest beers I have tried this year, but it is well worth seeking out for the season."
"Recommended"
"Pours clear copper with a half-inch of tan head on top and sparse lacing on the sides. The aroma is nicely balanced between toasted caramel malts and grassy hops. Flavor is more malt-focused. Plenty of nutty and toasted bread malts with a bit of clean bitter hop in the finish. Medium body is both creamy and nicely carbonated. A little weak on the hops, but easy-drinking and pleasant for a malt-lover."
"Pours copper with a relatively thin head and little lacing. Smell is malty and fruity, maybe cherries. Slight tang from the yeast on the finish. Taste is smooth with dry malt noticeable, but slightly watery. Earthybitterness in the middle and a spicy finish. Not bad, but a little disjointed. Mouthfeeel is spritzy and spicy. Smooth, but not creamy. Pretty easy to drink, but the whole package just doesn't make me shout."
"So smooth, and easy to drink. Good body. A rich version, that was a real treat. One of my favorites."
"D- This is a very decent example of the style. May not be the most outstanding, but a good ol' American shot at the Euro style."
"O: Very refreshing... first had this at Victory's Fall Fest... fresh and lovely on a warm fall day."
"D - Highly drinkable beer, it is easy to put a few of these down. Great festbier overall; the malt character is wonderful and it has just enough hops to balance. The head is good for an American beer, but a bit subpar by German standards and the beer could be just a little bit smoother but, aside from these minor flaws, this is easily one of the best festbiers I have had."
"Poured into a tulip pint glass. Was a orange-y red-y brown-y color, with a very thin head that quickly left quickly with a thin tracing on the edge of the glass. Aroma smelt yeasty and sweet. Tasted slightly acidic bitter, with spices and pepper. Felt good in the mouth, coated well. Easy to drink."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, forming a 1 1/4"" beige head over the clear orangey amber brew. Dense head lasts well, with prevalent frothy lace. Aroma is sweet nutty malts with a top of hoppiness. Taste follows the nose, nutty sweetness balanced by lightly bitter hops. Mouthfeel is smooth and drinking is easy. This one combines interesting flavor profile with a sessionable fest-style brew. Just what the doctor ordered."
"I'm actually disappointed. I LOVE Victory's offerings...but this one is just WEIRD! Maybe I got a ""bad bottle?!"" (Don't think so though) Tastes kinda like dirt, with a little bit of old hops added. Not sure what this beer is... The worst Octoberfest I've ever had...so far, and I really hate to say it. Again, Victory is a wonderful brewery, and this is THE FIRST of theirs that I've had that I don't like. Maybe it's not me, 'cause my buddy DID say he's tried it, and hated it as well?!.... Sorry friends. I don't recommend this....unless you like a ""dirty""-tasting Oct-fest. Sorry Victory friends. Cheers and SAAAALUTE my BA friends!!!"
"A good fall beer."
"This brew was served to a nice clear amber color with a good-sized frothy head that had a nice retention leaving a good amount of lacing at the top of the glass. The aroma seems to be musty with a great deal of malt wrapped together. Some spiciness seems to be present as well along with a slight nut and alcohol scent breaking through. Over all a pretty good smelling brew. The taste, to me, seemed to disappoint. It did not seem to have enough oomph, seemed watered down. The Malt flavors where there but they did not stick out. The flavors that where present where caramel, nuts, toasted grain and a hop/dry finish. Not a bad beer but do feel that it holds up against some of the better Marzens from Germany and is mediocre to a number of Marzens brewed here domestically."
"Drinkability: A really nice attempt at the style; bursts with flavor and original, but traditional elements"
"Beautiful garnet-amber color, crystal clear, pure white, small head. The aroma is a great combination of Munich Malt and subtle hops. That, however, is only the beginning. The real pleasure comes with the first sip, and last until the last drop. This is a great example of the style, exhibiting the unique flavors of a true decoction mash, with the wonderful malliard flavor components this brings. Seek this beer out!"
"Overall impression:"
"Scott"
"Overall the drinkability is pretty good here. Nothing stands out with this offering but it seemed solid enough."
"Not my favorite Oktoberfest but it's worth giving it a try. Also I expected more flavor out of a beer from Victory Brewing Company."
"It's not a standout (and actually a small letdown coming from Victory, whom I assumed would put out a classic),. But to say it's anything less than solid would sell it short as this ultimately succeeds in its cause and would be downable in minivan-sized steins given the right occasion...and absence of other similar options."
"This one poured a very nice light orange amber with a good looking two inch plus head on the top. Ample carbonation was kept alive throughout which really gave it great retention and helped to keep the lively look of it going. A nice bit of side glass lace was apparent, but the real story here was the complete and total clarity of the color and the great hue to it overall. A very nice, classic looking lager here. I have only tried two Victory beers, Prima Pils was my first but I like Festbier a whole lot more. A great seasonal that should be a year round beer"
" Overall what can I really say about this one. It was really superb and just what was needed at the time. This was an extremely drinkable, well designed and very filling brew that really gave a good represent of the style and offered a none complicated version. In a day and age where everyone and everything keeps going better, it was nice to see someone just keep it simple and put out a quality everyday brew, well done."
"Pours light copper with decent enough head and some lacing. Smells a touch doughy with some soft caramel and hops. Upfront is a nice lightly toasty malt note that gives way to a nice mellow malt base. All balanced by an even hop bitterness, ends drying. Mouthfeel is damn near perfect for an O'fest, i think. Almost medium bodied with vibrant carbonation and a terrific creamyness without getting too heavy. Impeccable balance. Drinkability is good. Best O'Fest i've had this year, though I'll admit to only having tried 5 or so. Extra points to this one for not being overdone."
"Overall, a nice entry into the marzen world."
"Overall, a very enjoyable Oktoberfest."
"Bright coppery orange with a short-lived head. Clean sweet malt aroma, lightly doughy and floral. Toasted, nutty sweet malts comprise much of the flavor. A leafy, herbal hoppiness compliments the malt. Solid medium body wraps everything up nicely. Clean and easily drinkable."
"It's smooth and slightly sweet. Theres not a whole lot going on. It's good, but I suppose I was expecting more."
"Cheers!"
"Decent...The slightly burnt edges irks me a bit, but overall it's decent enough to put in the yearly line-up of O-fests."
"Good, yummy, and satisfying."
"drinkability - i could kick back PLENTY of these bad larry's. VERY drinkable. The best American version of Oktoberfest that I have tasted yet. Seems better than last year's outing."
"This is good stuff. As far as Oktoberfests go, this is one of the better ones out there. Beers true to the style don't leave much wiggle room for twists and turns in the flavour, but those that can do it right make for a tasty beer, and that's what this one does."
"Pours a perfectly clear dark reddish-copper color with almost no head and no lacing. Aroma is not very strong, faint hop aromas underlie toasted malts. Taste is of toasted malts with only hints of hop bitterness to balance the beer out. Some sweetness at the beginning gives way to a drier finish. Mouthfeel is good, medium-light body and moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good. This is a solid oktoberfest but didn't do anything to impress me. I'll have another but in the future I'd pass on this and give myself the opportunity to try a new beer."
"Another winner by victory brewing company.A nice mix of bread and caramel aftertaste.Goes down like spring water on a hot summer day.I recommend this beer and will absolutely be buying this product again.I also will be buying other produts from victory brewing afterall it's in my hometown's backyard."
"Pours a rich amber hue with a one finger light khaki colored head. Stcikiness is hardly there, but somewhat. Smell is a sweet buttery scent with a nice caramel malt mixed in. Definitely a lot of malts in this one, let's give it a taste. Starts off with a subtle citrus hop bite that is quickly dominated by the sweet caramel malt. Sweet bready flavor with a nice kettle popcorn flavor towards the end with a vanilla tea like aftertaste. Pretty complex on the tongue. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with minimal carbonation. I put this one down quicker than I had expected, pretty damn good I must say. Victory seems to master almost all styles of beer."
"Pours a clear copper with a 2 finger head that dies quick. Smells crisp of nuts and spice with a little vanilla. Tastes as it smells with a touch of malt to balance out all the mild flavors. Medium to light in the mouth with tasty carbonation. Drinkability is great as this is a sessionable but not impressionable brew."
"Drinkability: Make no mistake, this beer may not be overly complex, but it is exceedingly drinkable, in every possible way. In fact, it's the best Oktoberfest beer I've had all year (only two, as of writing this)."
"Yeah, its a good fest beer. Its got a basic, mostly sweet taste of caramel malt with a bit of grassy/spicy hops at the end. The carbonation seems a touch low and I cant get any head or lacing. There's a slight burnt or heavy roasted note in the back of the flavor, like some black patent malt was used. I'd drink it, but I wouldn't really seek it again."
"A pretty average oktoberfest, IMO. Poured up nicely with an orange bronze colour and a foamy sand coloured head. Smell was honestly a little BMC-ish with a bit of sweet malt. Taste, Mouthfeel, and Drinkability are all pretty average. Overall, this wasn't bad, but honestly, I wasn't impressed."
"D- A very good example of the style, a little more hop finish would have put this beer at a 5.0."
"Drinkability is good though. Good malty flavor. A solid beer that will go down easily, especially this weekend while camping out."
"Not much going on here, and yet it's fantastic. I feel nourished. I think I could have this for breakfast. You know, in an emergency. Don't say you never thought of it!"
"Final Note: A very different taste than any of the many American or German Marzen's I've tasted (Fall Beers are a favorite of mine). I like what Victory has brewed here and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys celebrating anything... Prosit!"
"T: very nice and flavorful. there is definatly caramel and malts with some earthy tones as well i feel it has a medium taste but not such a medium bodied beer, on the light side of medium bodied. its almost like drinking a thinner drink with alot of flavor. i still think its a great beer regardless. thisalso makes drinkability really high. very easy to drink beer"
"Overall I would rather move forward from this beer than drink it again. Not bad, simply not something worth coming back to."
"drinkability - I like any octoberfest beer, A must try. Interesting taste compared to others."
"Drinkability/Notes. Glad I found this guy in the back of my DBF, just what I was looking for to offset all of the big winter beers I've accumlated. A nice malty beer with plenty of caramel malt giving the beer its sweetness that also finishes with a nice hoppy twang that lingers long on the tongue after the swallow. Super drinkable and one the would make a good session beer if so inclined. Definitley recommended and will buy again next fall."
"I'm not crazy about fest beers, but maybe it's right that this stuff tastes a little muted -- that is, if it is to be consumed all afternoon long from bottomless steins. I think Victory scores again with this one. It may feel a little delicate, but it's good stuff."
"D: Easily drinkable. No doubt a very good session beer. Marzens are suppposed to be subtle and understated but this one might be too understated for my tastes. I have reccomended this to friends who still drink Bud, Lite, etc. in efforts to get them to start drinking higher quality beers."
"The drinkability is good, this beer war brewed to session. MK"
"Poured into a pint glass, this beer has a yellowish-orange coloring (autumn appropriate) with a nice head, yet it disappeared quickly. It gave off a faint sweet smell with almost the hint of orange. The taste was smooth and refreshing. Sweet and malty followed by a mild hop aftertaste. It was fairly well carbonated and you could feel the bubbles in your mouth as you drank it. Overall, a very good Oktoberfest beer. We served this at our annual Oktoberfest family party back in October and it went over real well with an assortment of German sausages and smoked pork chops."
"12 oz. bottle, ""enjoy by"" 3/21/07. It pours a clear copper/amber, with high carbonation leading up to a half-inch khaki head that keeps a thin cap and leaves light lacing. It smells sweetish, with toasted and caramel malts, and some dark fruits. The flavor is lightly toasted, with caramel, molasses, and some lightly spicy, green hops that leave a medium bitterness. The body is medium, lightly drying, tingly at first, but it evens out and leaves a medium finish. Another good offering from Victory."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied with a solid creaminess. Flows down really easily and makes for an enjoyable brew. I could see myself sitting down to a few of these in a session no problem. Another solid brew from Victory, and quite possibly my last O'fest of the year!"
"12oz. bottle fresh date Feb 24, 07. Poured a reddish brown color with very little head. Not much in the smell department but a bit of malt. Taste of bready malts with a slight hop bitterness .Very drinkable I could easily drink a few of these. One of the best October-fest I've tried this year and will look forward to it in the next year."
"drinkability is great. really smooth and easy drinking. thanks jay!"
"An interesting take on a Marzen. Auburn colored brew, a bit darker than traditional German O'Fest. Aroma is bready, but with just a hint of hops. The taste is very good, bread and malt conquer the hops on this one for sure. Nice mouthfeel, fullish. Drinkability is good. This one rivals the best USA O'Fests; not quite as balanced as this year's Brooklyn O'Fest though. I'm glad I can get this one in Ct, although the supply was very limited."
"Autumn gold brown with a sticky, off-cream head. Caramel, caramelized carrots, honey, maple, vegetal hops on the nose. Biscuity malt flavor up front. Toasted caramel takes over. Spicy, herbal, hops finish over cooked vegetables and caramel residue. Medium-light bodied. Quite drinkable. Nice."
"It's funny how one of the few true american octoberfests is called a festbier. Anyway, a nice example of an octoberfest, very true to the german style. One of the best american octoberfests out there."
"D - Definitely one you can quaff down to celebrate Oktoberfest. Nice drinkability."
"A very good session beer, which I would happily drink more of. Nice balance and good taste."
"Light copper color, with a small peach colored head. Smelled of malt and something sweet like honey possibly, mild hints of spice as well. It tasted just like it smelled, with a light and refreshing feel. I could easily down a few of these (low ABV and very watery consistency). As far as compared to other brews of this style it is not the best but worth a try."
"Copper color with an oatmeal colored thick and foamy head that fills the top of the glass an inch high and lingers long. Very low aroma of bready malt and some sweet fruit, mostly apple. Flavor is biscuity malt, some caramel, and an autumnal smokey dry leaves kind of flavor that's hard to describe or decipher. Mouthfeel is dry and tannic."
"D- It is good but nothing amazing. Is nice and refreshing. A easy beer to drink but not one to go nuts over."
"This is the most Plain Jane brew I've had from Victory, but it's by no means a bad beer. This would be a good way to introduce a BMC drinker into craft beer, I think."
"D- The flavor of this beer are good but a bit muted making it a little thin and not that exciting for a session beer."
"thie is a good beer, but not as good as i would expect form victory. this beer is worth a try for sure."
"Drinkability is great. This would be an ideal companion for a cool, autumn day. I only wish I would've purchased more of these."
"Ahhh, finally, a great American Oktoberfest!! This one is really good. Highly malty with some stickiness on the glass, leaving some slight lacing. Not much head after the pour. Caramel notes all over with a nice slight hoppy twinge at the end. Nice burnt orange in color. A highly recommended beer and decently priced. I say it rivals Paulaner and Ayinger as my top 3."
"A solid Marzen from Victory that captures all of the beauty of this seasonal lager."
"Drinkability - this is a very good beer and very sessionable."
"D: Very good representation of style, tasty, not very filling for this style, easy to drink, I could stick with this one for the duration of an evening."
"Clear, bright toasty amber color with a thin grayish-white layer of foam. Spicy yet ""smooth"" aromas of noble hops (somehow reminds me of the smell of Scotch Magic tape) backed up by some doughy malt scents, like a loaf rising in a slightly warm oven. There is but a flash of grassy and spicy hop flavor right at the beginning of the taste, but the rest of the flavor profile here is almost entirely about bready malts, with a very faint caramel note appearing before a mildly spicy hop finish. A chewy bread flavor lingers in a most unhurried fashion through the aftertaste. There is moderate carbonation here, but it's felt only at the finish and is rather appropriate. Overall clean lager mouthfeel, gets a bit heavy as it warms. I appreciate that the alcohol is not overly amped-up in this Maerzen, unlike many other American interpretations. I tried this on tap a couple of weeks ago and didn't review it, but I seem to remember liking it far less than this bottle. Interesting. Anyway, a solid, drinkable beer for the beginning of the cooler months. Recommended."
"D: I'm not a huge lager drinker, but this is a really pleasant beer. Balanced, flavorful, and well done. I could drink a few of these for sure."
"Overall- Much better 2nd time around. A good session beer!"
"D - I could drink this all night. It went down so easy it was gone before I even finished my review."
"D: I love this time of year--so many highly drinkable O-fests. I've been particularly impressed with the American offerings this year, and this one is no exception."
"Overall, a decent attempt at an Octoberfest Marzen. I liked the variation of the theme with the hop presence but I think it lends itself to more criticism from the style police. It is still pretty drinkable but not as much as a Hacker-Pschorr or Paulaner. I will go back for this one."
"Pours a clear copper. Thin white,not much retention. just a bit of lacing, but lots of bubbles. Smell is malty, but week. Body is light to medium, and carbonated. Taste trys to balance malt and hops, and just about makes it. Worth a try, but don't run out and buy!"
"Its a slightly above average beer that should be the hands-down best of its style to justify the extravagant price of $10/sixer."
"Crisp and clean with a lingering caramel sweetness. Fairly full-bodied for a lager. I could put down many of these with no problem. I've really gotten into Oktoberfests this year, whereas last year I skipped over many. This is a mistake I won't make in future years."
"The taste is a little sweet and juicy, and kind of reminds me of red apples, which is perfect for this time of year. There's some hops at the end, but that's not where any emphasis lies. It's not very complicated, but the fruitiness and buttery mouthfeel make it so drinkable that I just don't care."
"On my recent foray to Norm's, I picked up a six-pack of this, with some singles to taste as well, and I'm thinking that the singles will have to wait, as I enjoyed this quite a bit."
"The taste is definitely about the malt. They are fairly big, nice and biscuity with carmel notes throughout. A good amount of yeast overtones as well. The nose is confirmed with a slight hoppiness in the flavor. There is a fairly creamy mouthfeel to this beer, which makes it enjoyable. I definetly recommend this for any O-Fest (not o-face, that's something else) fans. Pairs well with any of your classic german fare."
"Cheers!"
"D: Try this if you see it. One of the better ones I've had this season so far. Easy drinking--not overly sweet or malty. Well balanced."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and drinkability is very good. A very easy drinking brew. This is certainly one of the beers I look forward to in the fall."
"Pours an orangish/brown with a 2-inch foamy head. Smells of sweet, roasted malt. Very good blend of malt, a hint of citrus, and sweet caramel. Goes down a little on the thick side and has a nice caramel aftertaste. Very drinkable lager...great for enjoying at night as a dessert brew."
"D: Very drinkable, a well made Oktoberfestbier."
"This beer pours a clear dark ruby red with a small head that disappears quickly. The smell is not too strong, but it has sweet malt, nuts, and an earthy aroma. The taste is very chewy with nuts,carmel,sweet malt, and a ""bisquity"" flavor. The m/f is light and chewy with all the flavors mixing well. This isn't one of my favorite styles,but this is pretty good, as I would expect from a brewery as good as Victory. Cheers"
"-Oelergud"
"This is a classic marzen, sweet, and malty, with caramel notes and faint hops aftertaste. But the sweet flavors predominate (as they should). This beer is extremely creamy and smooth, and marks very high on the drinkability scale."
"A slightly above average Marze; reserved in flavor. An offering a bit disappointing from what I'd expect from Victory."
"drinkability: good"
"The pour into my Mahr's mug raises a light tan, two finger head that falls pretty quickly. The lacing is also quite sparse. The beer's color is a lovely deep amber/copper. The nose is sweet, bready, and touched by a hint of floral hops, but also has a bit of a burnt aroma. The taste is richer than many O-fests, but not necessarily in a good way. I think the burnt flavor creeps in here, as well. It doesn't ruin in, but it takes away from the overall impression. The other flavor aspects, light breadiness and a bit of hop bitterness, are quite nice. The mouth is right where I want it, medium, with medium carbonation too. This is definitely not one of the better O-fests I've had, but it is still enjoyable, if flawed."
"One of my favorite fall beers, this Oktoberfest pours a dark, almost angry copper, with a head that rises fast and leaves almost as quickly, leaving a skim and just a little bit of lace. Slightly nutty aroma. Light and sugary on the tongue at first, but then a bit more brassy and full on the edges. It's fruitiness is like an English pale ale, with an almost watery aftertaste that is, actually, very pleasant. As with so many Oktoberfests, the only way to make it more drinkable would be to add an intravenous line."
"All in all a terrifically drinkable festbier. Prost!"
"Once again, a high quality brew from a brewery that always pleases. One of my favorite oktoberfest beers made in America"
"For once I agree with the leftest SOB's at the NY Times. ;-0"
"Now, this is the Octoberfest that my palate has been craving. Certainly a good example of the style and easily drinkable. I may get burned out on the style before the season even gets here as this is the third O-fest that I have purchased and consumed in August..."
"I'll definitely be buying more of this at times, and I'm adding it to my beer-store shopping-list. I would find it very acceptable in quantity at a party. My feelings seem to reflect that of others here, as well."
"Drinks easy like a good lager does."
"Flavor is slightly sweet caramel up front with a bit of bitey grass hop in the middle and finishes grainy. The finish lingers for a bit as well. A very easy to drink beer."
"This beer poured a nice yellow/orange color with a nice thin white head that disapated rather quickly. The beer has a nice aroma of sweet malts and a bit of a bready nose to it. The taste is pretty much what you get with the aroma. A nice bit of sweet malts with the earthy, bread smell / taste. The taste does not linger in the mouth for very long but this is still a solid beer and very drinkable."
"This is another good beer from Victory Brewing. Keep up the great work!!!"
"Taste; pretty much follows it's aroma. It has a solid caramel malt presence, and a little bit of the spiciness makes an appearance. There's also a slight hop bite in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with fairly low carbonation. This is not the best O-fest by any means, but it's still a decent stab at the style."
"This beer came a dark burgundy with some orange highlights and no head. Smelled of a smoky sweet lager with some pasty oats and a slight nip of unobtrusive hops. Tasted of fruity raspberries, doughy and pasty oat malt with a nice bitter snap in the finish. Mouth feel was medium bodied with a sharp electric small bubbled carbonation."
"Crisp. Malts and hints of caramel up front with Earthy hop spice backing it up."
"Overall: Lovely Jubbly  one of the best US Oktoberfests that I have sampled to date. I picked this bottle up whilst in PA last month, its a real shame that this one doesnt come West with the other Victory brews. Recommended."
"Doesn't have the complexity and mouthfeel of the good to great O'fests out there, average all around."
"Pours a deep copper color with a small sparse head over top. Nose is sweet and toasty, almost sugary sweet. I'd like a bit more of the bready and toastyness to come through. Flavor is pretty nice. Fairly toasty with just a touch of sweetness and a very very light noble hop finish. Very clean. Nice american example of the style. Feel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. Pretty solid brew here. Tasty."
"Pours a cloudy amber color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is mostly caramel malt with some sweetness and possibly a little toasted. I'm not a huge fan of the flavor. It's comprised of caramel malt and some toastiness but there's a hop flavor in there as well - whatever hop it is, I'm not a fan of its flavor. Not necessarily something off in the beer, I just don't like this hop. Finish is sweet and slightly bitter and the mouthfeel is moderate. Drinkability is ok."
"Drinkable and tasty it is. Special? Not so much. Of course not every beer needs to be the greatest beer in the world. If I could get this locally I would drink it. It would be a no-brainer! Is this good enough for me too seek out in the future? No. I wouldnt turn one down though! I am very happy I could try it. Thank you RedHaze!"
"This Victory seasonal pours a darker copper color with a medium tan head. Aroma is mostly caramel and toasted grains. Sort of weak. Taste is also weak and watery for my liking. The flavors aren't bad but they're too weak. A light grainy sweetness is prevalent along with some nondescript malts. Finish is fruity and sweet. This beer is ok, probably a good session choice, but I was expecting more from Victory."
"Had it again a bit more than a year later and noted sourness as well as aggressive carbonation and peach colour.,"
"This Festbier poured a nice orange color with a slight off white head. Aroma is a bit bready/malty and a very mild hint of spice. Taste is upfront sweet malt and caramel and a slight dry finish. Smooth and creamy in the mouth and enjoyable to drink. Well done"
"Drinkability  This is a true session bier and one of the better efforts at the style from an American manufacturer."
"Very drinkable beer here. Tasty and mild this is easy to drink and is a fine everyday type of beer."
"Very enjoyable. I could drink this all day. Not too sweet like some Oktoberfest. A very well crafted brew!"
"A decent Marzen. True to design, it would serve as a good session/festival beer."
"As happens at times, the rather simple and thin flavor goes a long way toward making this quite quaffable. Its utterly inoffensive, and pretty much unremarkable as well. Still, its well better than just average, and it absolutely qualifies as satisfying. Its not likely to stand up well to much but the more mild food dishes, but as a standalone session beer it would be nicely recommended. You cant be amazed by every beer you try, but this one impresses just enough to make it desirable."
"This pours a nice copper color with a small white head that dissipates quickly. Smell is very mild and malty. Taste is almost all sweet malt with just a little hops kicking in for the finish. Medium bodied, maybe just a tiny bit thin but I think the mouthfeel is about right for this beer. This is extremely drinkable, it really begs to be drank in quantity. This won't blow you away, but it's a nice example of the style."
"Dirty brass with a small head that finally falls to nothing. Nose is sweaty malt and some butter notes. Taste picks up with a fine blend of malt and just a bit of hops for a dry(ing) finish. Mouthfeel is thin but it increases during the taste. Very drinkable. Not bad at all. Try it."
"Victory's brewing mastery resides outside of this beer, just try Storm King..."
"Pours a crystal clear orange, small off white head forms, some sporadic lacing. Smell is smoky and sweet, some grassy hops and a little bit of citrus. Taste is sweet and grassy, some caramel and citrus, light touch of smoke. Mouthfeel is light bodied, with medium carbonation. A fine example of Oktoberfest. Thanks DrJay!"
"Pours a clear medium-light amber with a small, off-white, foamy head with little retention. Only a little lacing as well. The aroma is malt-dominant of course, without smelling too sweet and bready. A pleasant nuttiness to it. The taste is a bit lacking at first with the malts coming off a little on the weak side. The hops only really make their presence known toward the finish. However, by the time I got halfway through the second bottle, I was enjoying it more. The mouthfeel is a bit watery and on the thin side. I dont know, I guess I have just grown to expect more from Victory. Its not bad by any means, but Ive had better Oktoberfests this year. And with the higher-than-average price tag, I wont be getting this again."
"Victory Festbier has nothing to set it apart from a large pack of American craft brewers who make Oktoberfest biers. This isn't necessarily meant as a criticism  Festbier is one of many well-executed versions of the style that are good, but not amazing. I'd give the nod to Brooklyn's Oktoberfest over this, but if I found Festbier on tap I'd happily order a pint."
"Clear caramel/amber with a short stand of fine, off-white bubbles that showed good retention and a bit of lacing. Malty aroma with some toasty caramel, a slight smokiness and faint hops. A malty, caramel flavoured brew, the moderate bitterness continued and increased into the finish. Overall, a very clean grain flavour with some toastiness that's balanced by moderate hop flavour. Very smooth texture, medium carbonation, some residual sweetness and sugar. Clean, malty, and tasty -- an enjoyable offering from Victory."
"It pours a copper shade in color, with a fizzy, pop-like head that almost immediately dissappears. The nose is packed with a rich, sweet malty scent. Smells delicious. The taste is also malty, but with a slight hop bitterness, or maybe tangy-ness, towards the end. The sip finishes with an odd aftertaste that I just cant seem to figure out. The mouthfeel is crappy. Maybe not terrible, but too thin and too fizzy when it first hits the palate. Drinkability is average. There are a lot better octoberfests out there, this one isnt terrible but it really isnt anything to get excited about."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. A good fall session beer. Less than 6% ABV and no overpowering flavor or body so as to make this tough to drink more than once. I could easily cozy up with a sixer and call it a night!"
"Pours an amber-orange color. Good head retention and lacing. Aroma mostly carmely malts, with a hint of grassy hops. Taste is again, mostly sweet carmel malts, with a cleansing and balancing hop finish. Carbonation helps with the clearing of the pallate. Clean beer all around. Maybe a touch higher FG for me. Perhaps my fall season, this IS the seission beer to have. I'm starting to like and appreciate Victory more and more."
"Light mouth feel and is generously carbonated."
"Pours orangish out of the bottle. Thin white layer forms on top, less than one finger head. Smell is malty with some spices mixed in. Taste is a little bitter with a stale taste. Not as malty as other Oktoberfests. Mouthfeel is a little thin and watery. Not one of Victory's better offerings."
"D - So so easy! The moutfeel and taste make this an easy drinker. You could only be so lucky as to be able to score a mini-keg of this as I did."
"I was a little dissapointed with this offering - though the color is good I found the nose a little soft, and had to really work it to bring out the character. First sip didn't deliver the roasted malt flavor I am used to from a Oktoberfest lager. Don't get me wrong, this is a nice fall beer, well made and very easy to drink - but I know Victory can do better. I typically look for more initial mouthfeel in alcohol and malt in a fest beer - the spice was faint, but there by the end."
"The body has a nice balance between the swet malts and the carbonation and hop combo. Best Okto I've had this year. Could drink it all night."
"Great deep copper color but crystal clear. Not much to speak of with the head but a nice level of carbonation gives it a little life. Smell is faint malt and some yeast bread tones. Taste is well balanced with some nutty tones but mostly just basic malt without being sweet. Nice mouthfeel with a good carbonation level. Very drinkable beer, i went through this 12 oz very quickly. The best of the oktoberfest i've had this year. Another solid offering from victory and highly recomended."
"A nice fall offering from Victory. Poured out to an orange color with a nice 1/4 inch head. Lacing was absent in this brew's presentation. Medium carbonation. Aromas of malts and bread are detected, as is grain and mild hops. Taste is robust, yet smooth; flavors of malt, hops and minor spice are all present, with a toasted like character filling the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was crisp and smooth, while remaining quite thirst quenching. Good drinkability. This could be a good football game day beer. Recommended."
"deep orange color, thin stream of lively carbonation and a respectable head of smooth velvet and coarse bubbles. solid lacing. aroma screams lager yeast with a perfectly subtle malt richness and the faintest hint of hops. so drinkable and refreshing. light black pepper notes and a crisp autumn malt sweetness are detectable.. full bodied but light in terms of gravity, this beer goes down in big gulps. so fresh... unbelievable. carbonation, freshness, hop spice and malt smokiness add a faux-sense of fall spice... when in reality, this is nothing more than a well crafted, four ingredient beer. mild hint of alcohol in the finish is the only negative i can see here. difficult beer to get right- bill and ron have done it."
"Copper colored brew with an off-white colored head. Not much retention of the head nor much lacing. Relatively transparent considering the color. I can't really detect anything with my nose. I smell malt and some dried fruit, but it's faint. The taste is a good representation of the style; smooth and refreshing without being overly sweet or bitter. A balanced beer that lacks both complexity and any distinct features. Overall an enjoyable beer during Oktoberfest, but not one that I would want to have often throughout the year."
"Slàinte!"
"A decent Octoberfest beir from one of my favorite breweries. It had a good fall oragne color with a clean white head that gives lacing in the glass. The smell is clean muted heavy malt and a bit of spciy acidic hops. It has the traditional Marzen taste that I have come to expect of these beers, but the malt seems weak a little. Overall it is a good clean beer that can be enjoy enmass and would be a solid session beir all session."
"A very good interpretation of the style. Although the aroma had me second guessing this one, I was pleasantly surprised with the taste and enjoy it as far as Oktoberfest's go (typically not my bag)."
"Pretty enjoyable."
"Very nice though somewhat on the darker side amber color. Not a lot of head. Big malty and sweet aroma. Malt dominates the flavor with a fair amount of sweetness. Low bitterness. Nice,creamy mouthfeel. Not to sure if this is to style but its very smooth and full. Good drinkability-a damn good lager. A bit heftier then an average fest beer but damn enjoyable."
"Overall: Not a great O-fest, definitely not my favorite Victory, but not a bad example to sneak in a mixed sixer of O-fests."
"I'm surprised how thick and heavy this is. The moutfeel is surprisingly creamy, and the beer goes down heavy. This is not what I wanted out of a marzen. The taste is grainy, with a little hops and a little maltiness. There's not much to say. It goes down hard, but the taste isn't complex enough or stron enough to explain why it goes down that way. Eh, Oktoberfest only comes once a year."
"Overall not much of a beer. Seems to be missing something. Maybe some more maltiness."
"Good Oktoberfest beer, certainly worth a try."
"Pours a clear bright copper with a finger of off-white head that quickly fades to a ring. Smell is a slightly roasted malt with a touch of nuttiness and maybe some cinammon. Taste is a big doughy malt extravaganza, laced with caramel and nuts, with a noticeable amount of flowery hops hitting at the end of a sip and lingering into the aftertaste. Medium bodied with a very smooth mouthfeel, this is a pleasure to drink. I've really been looking forward to Oktoberfest beers, and this one really hits the spot. I will be buying again this season."
"poured a clear deep amber color with creamy white head. Smell is nutty, malty, and bread-like. Taste follows through with a robust maltiness and toatsed nutts. Finishes big and malty with little hops present. A really good drinking session beer that I look forward to each year."
"Mouthfeel is bubbley, smooth, light. Drinkability is pretty decent on this guy, though maltyness could get to be too much after a few. Still, I'd drink this again."
"The malty sweetness takes a bit away from taste and drinkability in mine scoring but I could imagine this being in my fridge again."
"Biting, almost skunky hop aroma. Small, oatmeal colored head. Slightly sweet malt and biscuity flavors. Spicy hop flavors towards the middle. Transparent, light orange colored beer.Solid body, not too thick, very smooth and easy drinking. Solid flavor and feel, not much to look at and the aroma, while not bad, was not very appealing."
"D&N: I'm sitting here in front of my computer trying to finish this review before I finish this beer. Unbelievably drinkable, the tastes are just right, it feels good. The only faults I could spot were a bit of a weaker aroma than I was expecting, probably my fault for waiting so long to drink this. This is probably the best Marzen I've ever had."
"Easy to drink. Enjoyable enough but not among the many Victory brews I put at the top of the heap."
"Taste is full-mouth spiciness, like pine needle spiciness, edged with alcohol and sharp hops. Malts are sweet toasted cereals and corn, very flavorful, showing an aftertaste of toasted grain as well. Ample carbonation manages somehow to not be sharp at all. Refreshing and drinkable."
"it's not perfect, but especially fresh, this is an awesome session beer."
"This appeared the typical clear deep orange with good-sized white fluffy head on top. Decent lacing and head retention. Aroma was of sweet malt with a bit of caramel and breadiness and a touch of hops. Biscuity malt starts of the flavor with a bit of sweetness as well. Notes of grian and earthy hops were also in the background. Mouthfeel is about average here with nothing really standing out. Drinkability is good, this is a bit more flavorful than most O-fests and goes down easy."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a slightly hazy medium orange color with two fingers of head. There is a little bit of lacing. The smell is light and malty, with some caramel and a bit of hops. Nicely balanced, just a touch more on the malty side like it should be for this style. The taste is fairly malty as well. Some toasted malt and caramel. Hints of toffee and hops linger on the finish. The body is just a little bit light. The drinkability is great though. A decent Marzen."
"Bender Factor: Adheres to the O-fest style.Perfect to guidelines. Similar to Otter Creek without the metallic afttertaste."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"It's not a bad beer, the maltiness still pulls through, with almost a bit of nuttiness. Maybe Victory was trying something a bit different with this one."
"On-Tap at Victory. Dark amber like a marzen should be. A nice white head of foam as well that lasts and leaves nice lacing as well. The aromas are all sweet malts up front and nice green hops on the back. The taste is sweet and malty with a more pronounced caramel flavor than most marzens. There is also the lovely taste of bready malts and fresh hops as well. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and the drinkability is very good. This beer is very festive indeed! Good stuff."
"The beer pours a dark gold/amber color with a thin offwhite head that fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a musty and slightly malty scent that is dry and nutty. The taste is decent also. It has a complex, but not very good flavor. It is slightly malty with nutty hints and a dry lager yeast finish. It has a breadlike quality that detracts from the taste. There are hops in the aftertaste, but they are weak. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an average Festbier. It tries to be unique and it succeeds. It is uniquely average."
"Hmmm...was this a Victory brew? My first disappointment from this brewery. Smell was heavily malted...not pleasant. Taste was malt on the front with a light hop finish...very unspectacular. Mouthfeel was overly oily..once again..not great! Drinkability suffers likewise."
"Drinkability: This is a great Oktoberfest. It's tasty, refreshing and you can drink one after another (and you want to as well)."
"The mouthfeel was smooth at the start, and had a slightly dry and smooth finish. The caramel tones lasted briefly on the tongue after swallowing. Very drinakble and quite enjoyable."
"Supple and insanely smooth. Tongue is awash in sweet malt right up to the end when the hops take hold. About midbottle the hops grow in flavor (not a bad thing), and blend oh so perfectly with the malt. This is one of the best Oktoberfests I've ever encountered."
"This is not my favorite Victory brew, but it is very drinkable. It is light amber color with a small off-white head. The aroma is one of the barley malt and a kicker of hops. The taste is pretty much the same. By comparison with the good German Fest beers, this is not quite there. In contrast to the Spaten brews and the like, this is superior. It is a pretty thick feeling beer but is very drinkable. It goes down very smoothly leading to drinking more than one."
"A very nice offering from Victory - a bit thicker/chewier than its German counterparts, it fills the stomach quicker, but not without some great taste. Nice light caramel throughout with a dash of hops at the back to round out the flavor. Definitely a beer to have with food (pizza and/or pretzels come to mind) as well as on its own."
"This is one of the good festbiers. Nice sweet caramel malt gives it enough flavor to be worth drinking. It's a liquid caramel clear body with a decent head that is a bit fizzy. Easy drinking and another example that Victory is one of the better microbreweries when it comes to lagers."
"Draught @ Victory: This one pours a bit of a coppery color, with only a little head. Some lacing down the glass. A fairly decent malt nose. A trace of hops. The taste is pretty much along the same lines. There is a bit of a smokey, dry taste to it also. A very smooth, easy drinking beer. Good for session drinking."
"Another good Victory brew--thanks Andy"
"A true embodiment of that classic amber flavor of Oktoberfests, mainly because of the thin body and flavor profile. Quaffable and easy, yet a sipper too if you wish. Next to Paulaner, for me, as a great Oktoberfest beer."
"Drak, golden amber with a medium-coarse head. Pretty nice an sticky. Fresh hop taste and surprisingly grainy for a beer from these guys. Malt a bit less pronounced then I like and expected. Still, it had good balance and smooth, creamy carbonation. Not my 1st choice if in an Oktoberfest mood, but still a good, easy drinknig session beer."
"Poured this beer into a pint and my what a huge frothy head. The body was deep red amber. This looks the part, so how does it taste? This beer had an extremely clean and smooth, yet slightly sweet beginning. By my third sip, the beer's complexity becomes apparent. I started tasting that true caramel nut Oktoberfest. The beer ends gets a bit bitter, but smoothes out by the end. Enjoyable."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy medium orange color with a moderate dissipating tan head. The smell is a pleasant roastiness with a faint background hoppy aroma. The taste/mouthfeel is very slightly roasted maltiness with a mild hopiness which gives it a crisp clean finish. A drinkable clean octoberfest, while not the best it is very drinkable."
"Brilliant copper body topped by a creamy head. Sweet malt aroma with a hint of hops. Taste is very smooth, with well balanced malt sweetness, roasted flavor, and bitterness. Mouthfeel is solid and smooth. Drinkability is very good. A very nice fest beer."
"Prost!"
" The flavor is a bit lacking, but it is pretty good. Orange peels along with a little bit of hop bite give it a nice flavoring, just toned down. Some sweetness comes in, but it stays very well-balanced. Orange peels also add an interesting note. It is very drinkable, and it is definitely different from the other micro Oktobers I have had this year. A great session brew, but just a bit light for me."
"Appearance: Copper amber with an orange glow to it leaves a nice sized cream vanilla colored head with sufficient lacing left after the foam wains away. Aroma: Slight floral hop note lingers in there but more importantly a toasted malt character that is possibly the most delicate and pleasant from an Oktoberfest bier to this point mildly sweet Bavarian malts a blended so nicely here. Tase: Defines a well balanced beer, not tame or muted just made in an accurate approach toward the Oktoberfest or Marzen style that is consumed by the liter in Munich every year rolling syrup like malt sweetness with toasted nuts representing as the backbone of delicious tasty brew from Victory. Mouthfeel: Not watery but medium to light bodied has a slightly sticky texture that glides well down the palate. Drinkabilty: Must surely be the most drinkable example of an American made Ofest to date, wow just awesome beer everyone needs to sample this beer then go out and buy a case like I am going to."
"Slightly red-tinged amber, big white head that diminishes fairly quickly, and leaves very little lacing. Aroma is very light, some maltiness but not much else. Flavor is also fairly light, some caramel and other malt sweetness, and maybe a minimal hop hit at the end. Body is medium at best, mild carbonation, drinks easily, but is noting spectacular."
"A good beer, but not in the stratosphere like most of Victory's offerings."
"This seems to be one of the truer to the style Oktoberfests I have sampled. Draft pour left little head atop this amber/orangey brew. Bready aroma with a hint of alcohol in the nose. This beer seemed to have more of an alcohol character than the 5.6% showed. Bready malts balance this alcohol flavor nicely. Mouthfeel is slick and clean. Not a great fall seasonal, but Victory has stayed true to the style, as they usually do. This is a decent seasonal, but to me not worth seeking out."
"Copper in color with a thin white head that leaves a nice lace. Malty aroma with just a hint of hops. Taste is on the sweet side with a caramel flavor. It's easy drinkability makes it an excellent session beer. Another solid beer from victory. One of the better oktoberfests I've had."
"Straight 4's on this one,pours a nice amber color with a medium head that leaves a little lacing, aroma is of caramel toffee very appetizing.Taste is malty and doughy with some soapiness in the finish.Nice toasted malt flavor as well,pretty drinkable.Man I love this time of year!"
"Sweet maltiness abounds, with decoction like flavors and some slightly weird fruitiness that I can't quite figure out - it's not there when cold, and shows up when it's warm, a sort of fig like flavor? Very round flavor overall. Finishes a touch on the phenolic side, with a slightly numbing-the-tip-of-the-tongue effect alongside some green apple and toasted malt flavors. About 9/10 of the way to being an outstanding Ofest."
"Not the greatest Victory product, but would purchase again."
"Clear copper in color, with a thin, light tan head. The aroma is malty sweet, with doughy bread notes. Malt dominates the taste as well, starting off sweet and developing a pleasant toastiness mid-palate. Bit of a nutty flavor forms there too, and sticks around. Finish is lightly accented with herbal hop flavor, and the aftertaste is sweet. Medium-light in body, but well-carbonated and hopped well enough to prevent the taste from becoming cloying. Very drinkable."
"A better Oktoberfest beer, very malty and somewhat dry. There is a slight hop character. Very refreshing and a great beer to drink with almost any food. It is not overpowering and leads to being drank with ease and in copious amounts. Worth seeking out on tap as it is much better than the bottle version."
"Nice orangey glow and copper in color, good white head that stuck around the glass. Smell was all over the place, very complex for an Oktoberfest. Lots of sweet smelling hops and malts, some nutty notes and roasted barley and some pale citrus. Taste was pretty decent, not bad at all. Kinda sweet and malty bitter, very clean hop feel, a bit watery with a slight sweet twinge on the tongue. Its a drinkable fest, but this could be bolder and slightly heavier. Nothing really wrong with it, a bit of a different approach to the fest style then I'm use to."
"Clear orange-copper color, nice white foamy head. Has a light flowery and malty caremel aromas, sweet, balanced malts and clean tasting, light body, a little thin semi-watery mouthfeel, this is a decent oktoberfest, but nothing special, there are alot of other better ones out there."
"Creamy, bubbling, humdinger head; a perfect darkish amber color. Aroma: fresh, clean, floral, nuts, buttery and sweet, vanilla, bananas, soft spices. Little hops, heavy with malt. Incredibly sweet on the tongue, long and lovely finish. A tasty sizzle on the palate, very flavorful, and an unusually characterful lager. One of the more subtle, but satisfying Oktoberfests I've ever enjoyed."
"Orange-amber in color with a persistent white head. Sweetness and floral hops most noticeable in the nose. Balance is great with the floral hop flavors, carbonation, and nutty/toffee malts blending very well together. A very finely crafted brew that I wish were available in my area."
"In my opinion, one of the finest domestically brewed Oktoberfests; but more importantly, one that easily rivals those of Munich! It pours a clear reddish/orange-tinted amber body topped by a frothy ivory head that holds quite well and leaves some very nice lace. Clearly well-brewed! The aroma begs you to delve deeper with a softly sweet and mildly toasty (even gently bready) maltiness that's enhanced by a delicate floral hoppiness that's quite alluring! The mouthfeel is gently crisp from a fine carbonation, and slick across the palate with a medium/full maltiness. The flavor starts with a sweetish maltiness that expresses a soft toastiness and mild toffee notes as well as some lightly floral hop flavor. It sweetens slightly as it warms, but then finishes dry with some gentle bitterness and a lingering nutty and toasty 'crust of bread' note that gives it exceptional drinkability. It continually becons to you taste again! Exceptionally well-balanced and rich without being overbearing! As much as Victory is known for their heavy-handed beers (such as the hop drenched Prima Pils), they should also be recognized for their beers that display impeccable balance. This is one of them and it should not be overlooked!"
"This beer poured into the glass a amber/copper/orange color and was very clear, very bright, seemed to glow with the light. The head had an orange tint to its big foamy white mound. The aroma was of herbs, hops, bread (yeasty) malt and some hints of alcohol near the end, slight. The taste was of roasted bread malt, herbs, hops, caramel seemed to pick up near the middle of the tongue then ends with the nutty malt and slightly bitter hops flavor. A good example of this style of fest beer."
"This went perfectly with the meatless burger (surprisingly tasty) that I shared it with. They complemented each other very well."
"Musty malt/old sneaker smell. Crystal amber color. No lasting head at all. Sweet chewy malt flavor with a smidge of hops. Very dissapointing effort for one of my favorite breweries. The label says victory but the taste is not one of a victory product. Overly sweet, unbalenced, and no head retention at all. Like sweet syrup."
"Clear bright copper body with a fine, steady stream of carbonation. Head came foamy up, and quickly left, leaving behind the thinnest of tops. Aroma is of fresh bread from the bakery up the block, not strong, but there. Taste is of deep, toasted malts, a hint of dark chocolate. Not overly, cloyingly sweet. Just a whisper of hops, I believe they are there, but can't be sure. Second best domestic O'fest I've had this season."
"A malty, clean tasting 'fest that is highly drinkable....looks great in the glass....orangish...lace coats glass nicely...nose is of sweet malts...the body rates about medium....tastes of sweet malt and toasted grains...finishes on a dry, spicy note....very drinkable...very tasty....one of the better O'fests I've had this year..."
"Heaven knows Victory has more than enough great beers to keep us beer geeks more than happy.This one though is probably made to keep their less adventurous brewpub patrons content."
"Clear amber with full head that completely vanished. Aroma mostly of caramel malts. Victory has put forth a big sturdy malt base for this beer... and leaves it at that. No appetizing hop dryness, no traditional spiciness. Just a sweet syrup of a beer, hints of butter but cloying. Well-made but ho-hum, esp. for Victory. Drinkability low for a Fest, since the hops do not pull their weight in creating a dry tasty finish or spiciness. Not bad by any means, in fact those who don't warm to O'Fests might actually enjoy this especially if they roam around the dopplebock end of the spectrum. May also be good for cooking."
"Notes: Next time I have this beer I’m going to pair it up with a big fat juicy Ruben … extra kraut please. I think Victory tackled the style quite well with this one, a must try for any beer geek that makes their round of Oktoberfest Beers."
"Dark gold, light amber color with a low head.  Light spicy malt aroma and an awesome candy-like sweet flavor (reminiscent of smarties?).  There was a nutty character as time went on.  A medium bodied and creamy brew.  One of the best American style Oktoberfests in my tasting."
"This beer is a clear amber, but lacks a head.  Only a slight collar is present.  Aroma is full of a deep maltiness.  A bit of a candied like aroma is also present.  Has a medium full body.  And unlike many ofest, this one has a taste I can get in to.  I think it's got a little bit more of a munich and vienna characteristic than a lot of the other ofests.  The hebal hops accent very nicely as well.  This is a nicely put together oktoberfest.  Very clean tasting and highly drinkable.  Nice effort from the gang at Victory."
"Looks very much like an Am. version of style, in that greater attention to amber-orange color (it seems many German ones aren't so dark).  Big to huge full head.  Light toast, yet pleasantly sweet malt aroma.  Flavor is adequate for style, maltiness with roasty quality, yet non-distinct for many I've sampled this autumn.  Very nice creaminess to mouthfeel, with nice richness without being heavy, and not excessive in carbonation.  Finish is fairly long lasting with pleasing dryness of the malt and not bitter."
"352"
"Deep orangey color, 1/2 inch foam settles to a skim in about a minute.  Malty aroma, but a little tang in there.  Malty while not being overly sweet, good body early.  Proper sense of a good toast and a clean finish.  A little more hops than some, while lacking some nutty qualities.  There seems to be a variety of opinions on this beer, I found this suitable for style while a little hoppy and quite drinkable.  Aged properly, according to Marzen style."
"The color and head look promising. After that I'd have to agree with previous reviewers that this is sub-par for Victory. Not as clean as a Marzen should be IMHO. Some diacetyl is detected and I thought while drinking that it might be an ale. Just verified via the Victory site that it's indeed a lager. Not bad, but very unVictory like."
"Pours a smooth amber color as a Ofest should be. With a decent lasting, pillow like, off-white colored head. The aroma is mostly of Barvarian malts, slightly nutty, and caramel . On the palate more of the malts, caramel, german hops make a slight bite, toasty, slight graininess, not really complex but it has nice full flavor with depth, nice sweetness, smooth mouthfeel. This is a very good Ofest IMO"
"This is basically a solid, well made Marzen style beer, but not up to Victory's usual standards.  Carmel and mildly toasty sweetness dominate the brew.  At times the sweetness boarders on syrupy.  Not much of a head, and the aroma is understated.  Still, it's a good beer, but not typical of Victory."
"Taste is somewhat light, fresh and quick, basically sweet caramel-malt with a touch of very light hop bitterness to balance. Very clean soft mouthfeel, fades fast. A real good session beer."
